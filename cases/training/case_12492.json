    "summary": "<p>On May 16, 2007, an immigration detainee who had been held for more than six months without a bond hearing while in removal proceedings petitioned the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California for a writ of habeas corpus. Plaintiff claimed that, without a bond hearing, detention over six months violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the statutory requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Represented by private counsel, the ACLU of Southern California, and the ACLU Immigrants Rights Project, Plaintiff sought declaratory relief, as well as a court order requiring that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provide him with an individual hearing before an immigration judge at which DHS would bear the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that prolonged detention was warranted. The case was assigned to Judge Virginia A. Phillips and referred to Magistrate Judge Charles F. Eick.</p>\r\n<p>On May 29, 2007, Plaintiff filed an amended petition. On June 25, Plaintiff moved for class certification, seeking to certify a class of \"all people who (1) are or will be detained for longer than six months pursuant to the general immigration detention statutes pending completion of removal proceedings, including judicial review, (2) are not detained pursuant to one of the national security detention statutes, and (3) have not been afforded a hearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is justified.\"</p>\r\n<p>On August 8, 2007, the case was reassigned to Judge Terry J. Hatter, Jr. and referred to Magistrate Judge Robert N. Block.</p>\r\n<p>On March 19, 2008, the district court denied the motion for class certification without explanation. Plaintiffs appealed this denial to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On August 20, 2009, the Court of Appeals (Judge Betty Fletcher) reversed the district court's decision, stating that Defendants failed to provide any valid reason for denying class certification. 591 F.3d 1105.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently, Judge Hatter certified the class on April 5, 2010. On October 15, 2010, Plaintiffs petitioned the district court to certify subclasses determined by the specific INA section that authorized the class member's detention. Judge Hatter certified these subclasses on March 8, 2011. 2011 WL 13294658.</p>\r\n<p>On November 22, 2010, Defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. On January 27, 2011, Judge Hatter denied this motion, finding that the INA can be interpreted to require a bond hearing after a certain amount of time to avoid constitutional concerns. 2011 WL 13180220.</p>\r\n<p>On April 16, 2012, this case was consolidated with <em>Ngaywa v. Holder</em> (11-cv-01287) (the docket sheet is included in this case record, but the complaint is under seal and therefore unavailable).</p>\r\n<p>On June 25, 2012, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, requiring Defendants to begin providing members of the class with bond hearings. Judge Hatter granted this motion on September 13, 2012, requiring Defendants to identify all members of the subclasses according to INA sections 1225(b) and 1226(c), and to provide bond hearings in front of an immigration judge. 2012 WL 7653016. Defendants moved for an emergency stay of the preliminary injunction, which Judge Hatter denied on September 28, 2012. Defendants then appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the District Court's denial of the emergency stay on April 16, 2013 (Judge Kim Wardlaw). 715 F.3d 1127.</p>\r\n<p>In February and March of 2013, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On August 6, 2013, Judge Hatter granted Plaintiffs' motion, ruling all class members were entitled to a bond hearing by their 181st day of detention. 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135479. Judge Hatter also issued a permanent injunction, which permanently enjoined Defendants and required them to provide at least seven-day notice of an individual's hearing, hold a bond hearing for all class members who have been detained for more than 6 months within 30 days of the order, and submit a status report within 60 days describing all steps taken to timely identify all current and future class members to ensure that they would receive a proper bond hearing.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants appealed the summary judgment and injunction to the Ninth Circuit on September 30, 2013. On October 28, 2015, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion largely affirming the injunction. 804 F.3d 1060. They reversed and remanded to the district court, requiring the court to exclude non-citizens who had been ordered removed from the injunction as they were not members of the certified class (non-citizens detained pending removal proceedings). Defendants appealed, and on June 20, 2016, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. 579 U.S. 917.</p>\r\n<p>On July 20, 2016, both parties issued a Joint Status Report. According to the report, the parties continued to negotiate on a proposed draft of a modified permanent injunction order but reached an impasse on a number of issues. However, the parties agreed to defer briefing pending the Supreme Court's decision in this case, which was scheduled for argument during the October 2016 Term. The parties would submit a joint status report within 30 days of the Supreme Court's decision. The Supreme Court heard oral argument on November 30, 2016. After the oral argument, the Court asked for further briefing on the constitutionality of the detention of immigrants.</p>\r\n<p>On June 29, 2017, the parties issued another Joint Status Report. According to the report, on June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court issued an order setting this case for re-argument in the October 2017 Term. As a result, the parties submitted that no further action was required by the Court at that time.</p>\r\n<p>The Supreme Court heard reargument on October 3, 2017. On February 27, 2018, the Supreme Court issued a decision in this case. 583 U.S. 281. The Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's ruling that 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1225, 1226(a), and 1226(c) required bond hearings after six months of immigration detention as a matter of statutory construction. The Court declined to decide the constitutional claims in the first instance and remanded the case for further consideration of those claims. On remand, the Court directed the Ninth Circuit to first \"reexamine whether respondents could continue litigating their claims as a class\" in light of 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252(f)(1), Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=10697\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes</em></a>, 564 U. S. 338 (2011), which created a higher standard for class certification.</p>\r\n<p>The parties filed another Joint Status Report on March 5, 2018, agreeing that in light of the Supreme Court decision, the district court did not need to take any action at this time. The mandate would be issued no sooner than March 26, 2018. At that point, the Ninth Circuit would determine whether any of the remaining issues required further action. In the meantime, the parties agreed that the permanent injunction would remain in place in the Central District of California until vacated by some further action.</p>\r\n<p>On November 19, 2018, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion, remanding the case back to the district court for consideration of the plaintiffs' constitutional arguments in the first instance. 909 F.3d 252. The court also remanded the issue of reexamining class certification to the district court. The court did find that it had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' claims and declined to vacate the permanent injunction pending the district court's consideration of these issues.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 11, 2019. They added a new plaintiff, reasserted a statutory claim that had not been appealed previously, and added an Eighth Amendment claim. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on August 22. On November 7, 2019, the district court issued an order granting Defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to the newly added plaintiff and the revived statutory claim, but denying it with respect to the new Eighth Amendment Claim. 2019 WL 7840673. On November 18, Plaintiffs moved for clarification or reconsideration of that order. The district court later clarified that the permanent injunction remained in place.</p>\r\n<p>On November 27, 2019, Defendants moved to vacate the injunction and decertify the plaintiff class. On March 9, 2020, the court granted Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration and issued an order amending the order from November 7, 2019. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 263689. The amended order added that the Ninth Circuit had left the permanent injunction in place when it remanded the case and removed mention of the Supreme Court implicitly vacating the permanent injunction. On April 7, 2020, Defendants moved to reconsider the order. On May 28, 2020, the court denied the motion, denying both the motion to vacate the injunction and the motion to decertify the plaintiff class. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 269848.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants appealed the district court's May 28 order to the Ninth Circuit on July 27, 2020. On October 19, 2021, the Ninth Circuit issued a memorandum reversing the district court's order and remanded the case to the district court with instructions to vacate the permanent injunction. 2021 WL 4871067.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing as of March 2024 as both parties continue to engage in settlement negotiations.</p>",

The Supreme Court granted certiorari and on February 27, 2018, reversed the Ninth Circuit's ruling as to the plaintiffs' INA claims. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit for consideration of the plaintiffs' constitutional claims and for a reexamination of whether class certification continues to be proper.

Haddon, United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Montana, sitting by designation. \n        \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 582   Filed 10/19/21   Page 2 of 3   Page ID #:10643\npermanent injunction previously entered despite the subsequent vacatur of the \nunderlying judgment.  We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under 28 U.S.C. § \n1292(a)(1).  We remand this case to the district court with instructions to vacate the \npermanent injunction.   \n  1.  The district court misinterpreted our opinion in Rodriguez v. Marin \n(Rodriguez IV), 909 F.3d 252, 256 (2018) as an instruction to keep the permanent \ninjunction in place.   In Rodriguez IV we stated that: “Like the Supreme Court, we \ndo not vacate the permanent injunction pending the consideration of these vital \nconstitutional issues.”  909 F.3d at 256.  The district court interpreted that sentence \nas “instructions” to keep “the permanent injunction in place pending the \nconsideration of the constitutional issues” which it was “obligated to follow.”  As a \nresult, it denied the government’s motion to vacate the permanent injunction.    \n  We wish to resolve that misunderstanding.  We did not intend to instruct the \ndistrict court to maintain the permanent injunction based on plaintiffs’ now-defunct \nstatutory claims indefinitely.  Instead, we indicated that we did not lift the \ninjunction at the appellate level, like the Supreme Court, but were remanding for \nthe district court to do so when it considered how it planned to proceed on \nplaintiffs’ constitutional claims and other questions the Supreme Court asked it to \nconsider in Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 851–52 (2018).   \n2 \n      \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 582   Filed 10/19/21   Page 3 of 3   Page ID #:10644\n  2.  On remand, the permanent injunction must be vacated because it lacks \na basis in law.  A permanent injunction is valid only if, among other things, it is \nsupported by the plaintiff’s “actual success on the merits,” Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 784 (9th Cir. 2019) (citations omitted), and if it is tailored to address \nthe specific injury the plaintiff has successfully proved, Natural Resource Defense \nCouncil v. Winter, 508 F.3d 885, 886 (9th Cir. 2007). \n  When the district court issued the original permanent injunction, it was \nvalid: the plaintiffs had achieved “actual success” on the merits of their statutory \nclaims, and the court crafted an injunction designed to remedy those statutory \nviolations.  Since then, the nature of this case has been transformed.  The plaintiffs \nhave not only lost on the merits of their statutory claims, eliminating the entire \nfoundation for the permanent injunction and subsequent relief, they have filed an \namended complaint removing those claims from the case entirely.   \n3.  Therefore, we remand this case to the district court with instructions \nto vacate the permanent injunction.  Petitioners may, of course, move for a \npreliminary injunction based on their remaining claims.  We also direct the district \ncourt to follow the instructions we clearly laid out in Rodriguez IV, 909 F.3d at \n257, which comport with the Supreme Court’s instructions in Jennings, 138 S. Ct. \nat 851–52.   \nREVERSED AND REMANDED.  \n3 \n      ",

Petitioners Alejandro Rodriguez, Abdirizak Farah, Yussuf Abdikadir, Jose \n3  Farias Cornejo, Abel Perez Ruelas, and Angel Amaya are non-citizens who have been \n4  subjected to prolonged incarceration at the hands of the Immigration and Customs \n5  Enforcement division of the Department of Homeland Security (\"ICE\").  Each of \n6  them has been incarcerated for more than six months while their immigration \n7  proceedings have been on-going without a hearing where the government has had to \n8  justify their prolonged detention.  They challenge their prolonged detention without \n9  adequate process on statutory and constitutional grounds, on behalf of themselves and \nloa class of similarly-situated detainees. \n11  2.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over these claims pursuant to 28 \n12  U.S.C. 2241 (habeas corpus), 28 U.S.C. 1651 (All Writs Act), and the Suspension \n13  Clause of Article I of the U.S. Constitution.  INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 304 (2001); \n14  Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510,516-17 (2003).  This Court also has jurisdiction to hear \n15  this case under 28 U.S.C. 1331, which confers jurisdiction to consider federal \n16  questions.  Walters v. Reno, 145 FJd 1032, 1052 (9th Cir. 1998); cf. Wilkinson v. \n17  Dotson, 544 U.S. 74, 82 (2005) (challenges to parole release procedures cognizable \n18  under Section 1983).1 \n19  3.  This Court may grant relief under 28 U.S.C. 1331 (federal question), 28 U.S.C. \n20  1651 (All Writs Act), 28 U.S.C. 2241 and 2243 (habeas corpus), and 28 U.S.C. 2201-\n21  02 (declaratory relief). \n22  4.  Venue is proper in the Central District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n23  2241 (d) because Petitioners and all other class members are incarcerated at \n24  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities within this District. \n25 \n26  This action is both a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. \nJ \n27  1331 and a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. 2241, although for ease \nof reference the complaint refers to \"Petitioners\" and \"Respondents\" rather than \n28  \"Plaintiffs\" and \"Defendants.\" \n1 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 4 of 33   Page ID #:541 l. \n1  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1391(b) because a substantial part of the events \n2  giving rise to these claims occurred in this District. \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \n4  5.  Petitioner Alejandro Rodriguez is a citizen of Mexico who came to the United \n5  States at the age of one.  Prior to the filing of the original complaint in this case, he \n6  was detained for over three years without a hearing concerning whether his prolonged \n7  detention was justified.  During that time, the government refused even to consider \n8  him for release while he litigated his removal case, despite the fact that it presented a \n9  complex and novel question of law explicitly left open by the Supreme Court and the \n10  Ninth Circuit. \n11  6.  The government released Mr. Rodriguez shortly after he filed a motion for class \n12  certification in this case, but continued to subject him to serious restraints on his \n13  liberty without allowing him to challenge them in a detention hearing.  It then argued \n14  that his case was moot.  The Ninth Circuit disagreed, rejected the government's other \n15  objections, and found class certification warranted.  Rodriguez v. Hayes, 578 F.3d \n16  1032 (9th Cir. 2009). \n17  7.  This Court subsequently certified the class and directed the formation of sub-\n18  classes.  By this complaint, five other detainees now join Mr. Rodriguez as class \n19  representatives in this action.  Each of them has been detained for more than six \n20  months while their removal cases remain pending, yet none of them has been afforded \n21  a hearing where the government has had to justify their prolonged detention under \n22  sufficiently-rigorous procedures. \n23  8.  These detainees are far from alone.  On any given day, there are at least \n24  approximately 350 people, ifnot more, in immigration prisons throughout the Central \n25  District who have been incarcerated for more than six months - many of them for \n26 \n27 \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 5 of 33   Page ID #:542\n1  years - while their cases remain pending.2 \n2  9.  None of these people have received a hearing to determine whether their \n3  prolonged detention is warranted, and the vast majority have not received any hearing \n4  at all.3  Thus, the government routinely incarcerates people for months or years \n5  without demonstrating why their extended detention is necessary either to secure their \n6  presence at the time of removal or to protect the public safety  -- a dubious concern \n7  given that many class members have no criminal history, and even those who have \n8  been convicted have necessarily finished serving their sentences before their transfer \n9  to immigration detention. \n10  10.  Petitioners, like all the detainees they seek to represent, are purportedly \n11  detained under one of four general immigration detention statutes that govern the \n12  detention of most non-citizens whom the government is trying to remove.  See 8 \n13  U.S.C. 1225(b) (authorizing detention of aliens seeking admission); 8 U.S.C. 1226(a) \n14  (authorizing detention of aliens pending a determination of removability); 8 U.S.C. \n15  1226( c ) (authorizing \"mandatory\" detention, without hearings, of certain aliens who, \n16  inter alia, have been convicted of specified triggering offenses); 8 U.S.C. 1231(a) \n17 \nThis Court ordered the government to provide a list of detainees to Petitioner.  That \n2 \n18  list showed that over 350 people were detained in immigration prisons throughout the \n19  Central District as of April 21, 2010. \n20  Petitioners refer interchangeably throughout this complaint to a hearing to determine \n3 \nwhether \"prolonged detention\" is justified, a \"constitutionally-adequate\" hearing, and \n21 \nan \"adequate\" hearing to justify prolonged detention.  See Rodriguez, 578 F.3d at \n22  1039 (noting that \"Petitioner's requested relief includes ... providing all members of \n23  the class constitutionally-adequate individual hearings before an immigration judge\"). \nA hearing that is adequate to justify prolonged detention would include, at a \n24  minimum, notice to detainees of their right to the hearing, an adversarial, transcribed, \n25  in-person hearing before an immigration judge or other impartial adjudicator, counsel \nfor detainees who are unrepresented at that hearing, and a substantive standard \n26  requiring the government to show by clear and convincing evidence that no set of \n27  release conditions could reasonably assure the detainee's presence in the event of \nremoval or protect the community from serious danger, taking into account the length \n28  of detention at issue. \n3 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 6 of 33   Page ID #:543\n1  (authorizing detention of aliens with final orders of removal during and after the \n2  removal period).  In keeping with the Ninth Circuit's terminology, these four statutes \n3  are referred to herein as the \"general immigration detention statutes.\"  See generally \n4  Nadarajah v. Gonzales, 443 F.3d 1069,1078,1080-81 (9th Cir. 2006) (contrasting \n5  general immigration detention statutes that do not explicitly authorize prolonged \n6  detention with specific statutes at 8 U.S.C. 1226a and 8 U.S.C. 1531-37 that authorize \n7  prolonged detention on, inter alia, national security grounds). \n8  11.  Petitioners contend that because none of these general immigration detention \n9  statutes explicitly authorize prolonged detention, they cannot be interpreted to \n10  authorize detention of longer than six months absent a hearing where the government \n11  shows, under a suitably-rigorous standard, that further prolonged detention is justified. \n12  See generally Casas-Castrillon v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 535 F.3d 942, 950 (9th Cir. \n13  2008) (construing general detention statutes to require bond hearings where \n14  government bears burden of proof because \"[w]e conclude that prolonged detention \n15  without adequate procedural protections would raise serious constitutional concerns\"). \n16  Moreover, if these statutes did authorize prolonged detention they would violate the \n17  Due Process Clause, at least absent substantially greater procedural constraints.  See \n18  generally Zadyydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690-92 (2001) (finding \"severe and \n19  obvious\" problems with prolonged and indefinite detention under limited \n20  administrative procedures). \n21  12.  Respondents, in contrast, maintain a policy or general practice - which \n22  Petitioners contend is unlawful - of detaining people for prolonged time periods \n23  without providing them adequate hearings.  Pursuant to this unlawful policy or general \n24  practice, Respondents have incarcerated the Petitioners and each of the class members \n25  they represent pursuant to one of the general immigration detention statutes for more \n26  than six months.  Pursuant to Respondents' policy or general practice, during that time \n27  neither Petitioners nor any other similarly-situated person have had a hearing where \n28  the government has had to show that their prolonged detention remains justified. \n4 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 7 of 33   Page ID #:544\n1  Respondents' general policies and practices of prolonged detention without \n2  hearings are in violation of the statutory and constitutional rights of the Petitioners and \n3  other class members.  To remedy this on-going violation of the \"law, Petitioners bring \n4  this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and a \n5  class of similarly-situated persons. \n6  PARTIES \n7  13.  Petitioner Alejandro Rodriguez is a citizen of Mexico.  He was detained for \n8  over three years while litigating his removal case prior to the filing of the original \n9  complaint in this case.  He has never been afforded a hearing to determine whether his \n10  prolonged detention is justified.  He is currently residing in Los Angeles under \n11  extremely restrictive release conditions while his removal proceedings remain \n12  pending. \n13 \n14.  Petitioner Abdirizak Aden Farah is a Somalian refugee who has been \n14  incarcerated at Mira Lorna Detention Center for over eight months without a hearing \n15  to determine that his detention is warranted.  Indeed, he has received no explanation of \n16  any kind as to why he cannot be released pending completion of his removal hearings, \n17  despite having a close family friend in Minnesota willing to house him and no \n18  criminal history of any kind. \n19 \n15.  Petitioner Yussuf Abdikadir is another Somalian refugee who has been \n20  incarcerated by ICE for approximately six months without a hearing to determine \n21 \nwhether his detention is warranted.  He too has received no explanation of any kind as \n22  to why he cannot be released pending completion of his removal proceedings, despite \n23  having a sponsor in San Diego willing to house him and no criminal history of any \n24  kind. \n25 \n16.  Petitioner Abel Perez Ruelas is a Mexican national who entered the United \n26  States on a visitor's visa approximately eight years ago and is now married to a U.S. \n27  citizen.  He has been incarcerated for 16 months pending completion his removal \n28  proceedings.  He received a bond hearing where he bore the burden to prove that he \n5 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 8 of 33   Page ID #:545\n1  was not a danger or flight risk, but the judge denied bond, and later set it at an amount \n2  he could not pay.  Although he is without doubt eligible to adjust status, he remains \n3  detained, even though the government has never had to justify his prolonged \n4  detention. \n5  17.  Petitioner Jose Farias Cornejo is also a Mexican national, but is a lawful \n6  permanent resident of this country, where he has lived since before his first birthday. \n7  He has been convicted of relatively minor offenses, the most serious of which is \n8  possession of a controlled substance, for which he was sentenced to 180 days in jail. \n9  However, he has spent more than twice that amount of time in immigration prison \n10  while awaiting a final decision in his immigration case.  Although the government \n11  does not dispute that he is eligible for cancellation of removal and has stated in \n12  immigration court that it does not intend to oppose his application, he remains in \n13  detention awaiting a final decision in his case without having received a detention \n14  hearing of any kind.  As the government interprets the immigration laws, his drug \n15  conviction renders him ineligible even to be considered for release from detention, \n16  even though it does not bar him from obtaining relief to remain. \n17  18.  Petitioner Angel Armando Amaya is a citizen of El Salvador who has lived in \n18  the United States since the age of eleven.  He has never received a criminal sentence \n19  of longer than 90 days, but has been incarcerated by immigration authorities for over \n20  18 months while litigating his removal case.  During that time he has never seen an \n21  immigration judge, let alone been afforded an adequate bond hearing in light of his \n22  prolonged detention.  He is prima facie eligible for relief allowing him to become a \n23  lawful permanent resident, but remains detained while the Ninth Circuit considers \n24  whether his prior lawyer's failure to advise him as to the filing deadline constitutes \n25  ineffective assistance of counsel, such that his failure to meet it does not bar him from \n26  obtaining relief for which he is otherwise-eligible. \n27  19.  Respondent Eric Holder is the Attorney General of the United States and the \n28  head of the Department of Justice, which encompasses the Board of Immigration \n6 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 9 of 33   Page ID #:546\n1  Appeals (\"BIA\") and immigration judges as a subunit - the Executive Office of \n2  Immigration Review.  Mr. Holder shares responsibility for implementation and \n3  enforcement of the immigration laws along with Respondent Napolitano.  Mr. Holder \n4  is a legal custodian of Petitioner.  Mr. Holder is sued in his official capacity. \n5  20.  Respondent Janet Napolitano is the Secretary of Homeland Security and heads \n6  the Department of Homeland Security, the arm of the federal government responsible \n7  for enforcement of immigration laws.  Ms. Napolitano is the ultimate legal custodian \n8  of Petitioner.  Ms. Napolitano is sued in her official capacity. \n9  21.  Defendant Thomas G. Snow is the Acting Director for the Executive Office for \n10  Immigration Review (\"EOIR\"), which is the federal agency that operates the \n11  immigration courts.  Mr. Snow is responsible for the supervision of the Deputy \n12  Director, the Chairman of the BIA, the Chief Immigration Judge, the Chief \n13  Administrative Hearing Officer, and all agency personnel in the execution of their \n14  duties.  Mr. Snow is sued in his official capacity. \n15  22.  Respondent Timothy Robbins is the Field Office Director for the Los Angeles \n16  District of ICE.  In his official capacity, Mr. Robbins is authorized to release \n17  Petitioner and has legal custody of him.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n18  23.  Respondent Lee Baca is the Sheriff of Los Angeles County, and therefore the \n19  officer responsible for the operation of the Mira Lorna Detention Center in Lancaster, \n20  California.  Mira Lorna's website acknowledges that it houses immigration detainees. \n21  However, it states that \"[w  ]e function as a regular County jail with the exception that \n22  the individuals we house are identified as detainees.\"  Sheriff Baca is a legal custodian \n23  of people detained at that facility, and is sued in his official capacity. \n24  24.  Respondent Wesley Lee is the Officer-in-Charge at the Mira Lorna Detention \n25  Center, and therefore the highest-ranking ICE officer at the facility.  He is a legal \n26  custodian of a number of class members.  Mr. Lee is sued in his official capacity. \n27  25.  Respondent Rodney Penner is the Captain of the Mira Lorna Detention Center, \n28  and the highest ranking Sheriffs Department official at the facility.  Captain Penner is \n7 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 10 of 33   Page ID #:547\n1  a legal custodian of a number of class members, and is sued in his official capacity. \n2  26.  Respondent Sandra Hutchens is the Sheriff of Orange County, and therefore the \n3  officer responsible for the operation of the Theo Lacy Facility and the James Musick \n4  facility, both of which incarcerate class members in Orange County.  She is a legal \n5  custodian of people detained at those facilities, and is sued in her official capacity. \n6  27.  Respondent Officer Nguyen is the Officer-in-Charge at the Theo Lacy facility, \n7  and therefore the highest-ranking ICE officer at the facility.  He is a legal custodian of \n8  Mr. Amaya and other class members.  Mr. Nguyen is sued in his official capacity. \n9  28.  Respondent Captain Davis Nighswonger is the commander of the Theo Lacy \n10  Facility, which is, according to its own website, the largest \"correctional institution\" \n11  in Orange County.  Nonetheless, Theo Lacy incarcerates a number of immigration \n12  detainees, including Angel Amaya.  Captain Nighswonger is a legal custodian of Mr. \n13  Amaya and other class members, and is sued in his official capacity. \n14  29.  Respondent Captain Mike Kreuger manages the operations of the James A. \n15  Musick Facility, another prison in Orange County.  According to its website, the \n16  Musick facility incarcerates \"pre-trial and sentenced\" inmates.  Nonetheless, upon \n17  information and belief, it also houses class members, none of whom are criminal \n18  detainees.  Mr. Kreuger is a legal custodian of those class members, and is sued in his \n19  official capacity. \n20  30.  Respondent Arthur Edwards is the Officer-in-Charge at the Santa Ana City Jail \n21  and therefore the highest-ranking ICE officer at the facility.  He is a legal custodian of \n22  a number of class members.  Mr. Edwards is sued in his official capacity. \n23  31.  Respondent Russell Davis is the Jail Administrator of the Santa Ana City Jail, \n24  whose stated goal is to fulfill the \"incarceration needs\" of the Santa Ana Police \n25  Department.  Nonetheless, the Santa Ana Jail incarcerates several dozen class \n26  members on any given day.  Therefore, Mr. Davis is a legal custodian of a number of \n27 \n28 \n8 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 11 of 33   Page ID #:548\n1  class members, and is sued in his official capacity.4 \n2 \nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n3 \nAlejandro Rodriguez \n4 \n32.  Petitioner Alejandro Rodriguez was detained for over three years while he \n5 \nchallenged the government's efforts to deport him to Mexico, a country where he has \n6 \nnot lived since he was a baby. \n7 \n33.  Mr. Rodriguez came to this country in September 1979, when was one year old. \n8 \n5 \nHe became a lawful permanent resident on June 4, 1987, when he was nine years 01d.\n9 \n34.  On or about July 29, 1998, Mr. Rodriguez pled guilty to Unlawful Driving or \n10 \nTaking of a Vehicle under section 10851 (A) of the California Vehicle Code (CVC). \n11 \nFor this crime he was sentenced to two years.  Five years later, on or about October \n12 \n21, 2003, he pled no contest and was convicted of Possession of a Controlled \n13 \nSubstance under California Health and Safety Code section 1 I 377(A), for which he \n14 \nreceived formal probation of 5 years under the conditions of California Prop 36.  He \n15 \nwas transferred to DHS custody after his arrest, on April 10, 2004.  He was detained \n16 \nfor over three years after that transfer, until the government released him shortly after \n17 \nthe filing of the class certification motion in this case. \n18 \n35.  The government charged Mr. Rodriguez with being removable based on his \n19 \n20 \n4 The government has taken conflicting positions in detention litigation concerning \n21 \nwho the proper Respondent should be in habeas petitions challenging immigration \n22  detention.  Petitioners have sued every official who could constitute an appropriate \n23  respondent under the different theories advanced by the government, as well as the \nofficials who constitute the proper defendants for a complaint under Section 1331. \n24 \n25  5Mr. Rodriguez narrowly missed becoming a citizen due to events beyond his control. \nHe would have gained automatic citizenship, through his father, ifhis parents had \n26  legally separated prior to his 18th birthday, or if he had been under the age of 18 at the \n27  time of the enactment of the Child Citizenship Protection Act of2000.  However, his \nparents formally separated shortly after he turned 18, and he was 23 by the time the \n28  Act passed.  See 8 U.S.C. 1431. \n9 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 12 of 33   Page ID #:549\n1  drug offense on April 15, 2004.  At his removal hearing, Mr. Rodriguez contested that \n2  his conviction rendered him removable, and argued in the alternative that he was \n6 \n3  eligible for relief from removal. \n4  36.  The government received a continuance to alter the charging documents in his \n5  case, after which it charged Mr. Rodriguez with being deportable on an additional \n6  ground based on his 1998 conviction for theft.  Subsequently, on July 21, 2004, an \n7  immigration judge ordered him removed, holding that both his drug offense and his \n8  theft offense rendered him removable.  The Judge held that the drug offense was a \n9  controlled substance offense triggering removal and that the theft conviction was an \n10  aggravated felony, triggering mandatory removal. 7  The immigration judge ordered \n11  him deported to Mexico.  Mr. Rodriguez appealed that decision to the BIA. \n12  37.  On December 21, 2004, the Board reversed the Judge's decision that the drug \n13  possession conviction rendered Mr. Rodriguez removable, but upheld the decision that \n14  his theft conviction was an aggravated felony. \n15  38.  On December 28,2004, Mr. Rodriguez timely petitioned for review of the \n16  Board's decision to the Ninth Circuit, arguing inter alia that his crime was not an \n17  6An ICE officer initially deemed him eligible for release on bond, and set the bond at \n18  $15,000.  However, Mr. Rodriguez was unable to afford the bond in that amount, and \n19  an immigration judge denied his request to lower the bond amount. Shortly after the \nBIA decided his case in 2004, the government revoked that bond order and ordered \n20  him detained without bond under the mandatory detention provision codified at 8 \nU.S.C. 1226(c). \n21 \n22  Although not charged in the immigration charging document, the government also \n7 \n23  presented evidence from court records that, on or about October 24,2003, a man using \nthe name Alejandro Rodriguez (who also used another name as an alias) pled guilty to \n24  California Health and Safety Code section 1155 O( a), Under the Influence of a \n25  Controlled Substance, and was sentenced to 120 days in jail, which he served during \nthe same time that Mr. Rodriguez was released and reporting to the court for his \n26  conviction of October 21, 2003.  The date of conviction makes it highly unlikely that \n27  Mr. Rodriguez was in fact convicted of this offense.  Nonetheless, the IJ ruled that this \nconviction constituted a second drug offense, rendering Petitioner removable on the \n28  basis of the drug convictions. \n10 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 13 of 33   Page ID #:550\n1  aggravated felony as defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act.  Mr. Rodriguez \n2  then sought a stay of removal, which the government opposed.  Thereafter, the Ninth \n3  Circuit granted his request for a stay of removal, and therefore necessarily found that \n4  his case presents substantial legal claims.  See Maharaj v. Ashcroft, 295 F.3d 963,966 \n5  (9th Cir. 2002). \n6  39.  While Mr. Rodriguez's case was pending at the Ninth Circuit, that court decided \n7  another case holding that Mr. Rodriguez's theft conviction was not an aggravated \n8  felony.  The government then moved to hold his case in abeyance while it sought en \n9  banc review of that decision.  The Ninth Circuit granted the motion, even though he \n10  had already been detained for 15 months at that time._After en banc review failed, the \n11  government sought Supreme Court review in the other case, and again requested that \n12  Mr. Rodriguez's case be held.  After the Supreme Court granted cert, his case was \n13  held still further.  In the end, his case was held in abeyance for over two years, but \n14  none of the decisions for which it was held established that he was subject to \n15  mandatory removal, as the immigration courts had found. \n16  40.  Eventually, the government largely conceded that Mr. Rodriguez's convictions \n17  did not subject him to mandatory removal, and it agreed to remand his case to the \n18  immigration courts on this basis.  His case is now back before an immigration judge, \n19  who will consider his (exceedingly strong) application for cancellation of removal in \n20  January 2011. \n21  41.  During the three years of Mr. Rodriguez's detention, the government never held \n22  a hearing as to whether his prolonged detention is justified.  In fact, the only process \n23  Mr. Rodriguez received with respect to his detention was what the government calls \n24  \"File Custody Reviews.\"  The first of these occurred on March 10,2005, when an ICE \n25  agent presumably read through his file and issued a \"Decision to Continue Detention.\" \n26  No ICE official interviewed Mr. Rodriguez, let alone held a hearing, prior to making \n27  this decision.  Instead, ICE merely gave him a questionnaire to fill out, asking for \n28  information regarding family members, employment experience, and any outstanding \n11 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 14 of 33   Page ID #:551\n1  probation requirements.  Although Mr. Rodriguez documented his work as a dental \n2  assistant and his extensive family ties, including his U.S. citizen father and sister, and \n3  his lawful permanent resident mother and brother, ICE denied his request for release, \n4  stating simply that he would remain detained until the Ninth Circuit rendered its \n5  decision.  The notice offered no further explanation for the decision to continue \n6  detention, made no mention of how long Mr. Rodriguez had been detained (eleven \n7  months at that time), and offered no suggestions as to what steps he might take to \n8  effect a different outcome in any future decisions. \n9  42.  In September 2005, ICE conducted another file custody review, which it \n10  apparently denied for similar reasons, and in March 2006 the process was repeated \n11  again.  In each of these instances, the government did not even provide Mr. Rodriguez \n12  with a written decision as to why he would remain incarcerated for many more \n13  months.  In March 2007 the government chose to continue Mr. Rodriguez's detention \n14  again.  At the time of that last custody decision he had been detained for nearly three \n15  years, yet the decision made no mention of this fact.  Instead, the decision asserted \n16  that continued detention was justified because the Ninth Circuit would decide his case \n17  soon, which was entirely incorrect. \n18  43.  Shortly after the original class complaint in this case was filed, the government \n19  released Mr. Rodriguez from detention, but continued to subject him to severe \n20  restraints on his liberty which remain in effect, including a requirement that he abide \n21  by a strict curfew and wear an electronic monitoring device at all times.  The \n22  government has continued to require that he abide by these restrictions, and has never \n23  afforded him a hearing before an immigration judge to determine if they are necessary \n24  to ensure his appearance at his final removal hearing, where he will likely be granted \n25  cancellation of removal. \n26  Abdirizak Aden Farah \n27  44.  Abdirizak Aden Farah is a Somali refugee who has been detained for over eight \n28  months at the Mira Loma facility without any kind of hearing to determine whether \n12 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 15 of 33   Page ID #:552\n1  his detention is justified. \n2  45.  Mr. Farah was born on May 5, 1987 in Kismayo, Somalia.  His family lived in \n3  Mogadishu for the early part of his childhood.  Thousands of refugees have fled \n4  Somalia since the country's civil war erupted approximately twenty years ago.  Today, \n5  there is no functioning government in most of Somalia, and the country exists in a \n6  state of constant civil war and virtual anarchy.  The United Nations High Commission \n7  for Refugees issued guidelines in May 2010 largely advising against the return of \n8  anyone from central or southern Somalia, including even asylum seekers whose \n9  claims had been rejected.  With respect to the capital of Mogadishu (where Mr. Farah \n10  lived prior to suffering persecution), a Human Rights Watch researcher has stated that \n11  \"Mogadishu is one of the world's most dangerous places ... Returning people there is \n12  not just risky; it's a potential death sentence.\" \n13  46.  Mr. Farah first faced persecution in Somalia as a child, when his family was \n14  forced to flee Mogadishu because they were members of the minority Marehan clan \n15  who faced danger from members of the Hawiye, a powerful majority clan in Somalia. \n16  Eventually, the family was able to settle in Kismayo, a city in Somalia where the \n17  Hawiye were not powerful.  Several years later, his father was shot and killed by \n18  members of a Hawiye sub-clan when he returned briefly to Mogadishu to try to sell \n19  the family home. \n20  47.  Mr. Farah fled Somalia in April 2009 in order to escape the al-Shabaab, a \n21  militant Islamic organization that is trying to take over Somalia. Al-Shabaab militants \n22  shot and killed his brother Mohamed because he worked as a driver for the Somali \n23  Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in the summer of2007. These same militants \n24  nearly killed Mr. Farah in the same attack by slashing his wrist with a knife. \n25  Afterward, al-Shabaab members repeatedly accused him of working for the TFG and \n26  finally threatened to kill him ifhe did not join them. \n27  48.  After the last of these threats, Mr. Farah's uncle sent money for him to flee. \n28  With the assistance of several people, he arrived by a circuitous route at the southern \n13 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 16 of 33   Page ID #:553\n1  border of the United States, where he presented himself at the border and requested \n2  asylum on or about December 31, 2009.  An asylum officer found his claim credible, \n3  and referred him for a full asylum hearing before an immigration judge. \n4  49.  Mr. Farah has had several hearings in his immigration case, the first of which \n5  took place in March 2010.  At several of these, the immigration judge continued his \n6  hearing because he did not have a lawyer, while others were cancelled because the \n7  judge or the translator were not present.  His next hearing is scheduled for late \n8  October 2010. \n9  50.  Mr. Farah has applied for release on parole under 8 C.F.R. 212(d)(5)(A).  Under \n10  these procedures, the decision whether or not to release him is made by a single \n11  officer, with no appeal process, and without providing a hearing of any kind.  An ICE \n12  officer denied him release without meaningful explanation. \n13  51.  Mr. Farah's wife and baby daughter remain in Somalia.  He has been unable to \n14  establish any contact with them because of his detention. \n15  Yussuf Abdikadir \n16  52.  Yussuf Abdikadir is also a Somalian refugee.  He has been detained by \n17  immigration authorities since early March 2010, and also has not received a detention \n18  hearing of any kind. \n19  53.  Mr. Abdikadir was born on October 5, 1980.8  He lived with his family-\n20  including his parents and five siblings -- as a child in Mogadishu.  He is also a \n21  member of a minority clan in Somalia. \n22  54.  In 1991, as the Somali political structure disintegrated, a militia associated with \n23  a dominant clan, the Hawiye, attacked Mr. Abdikadir's family.  They killed his two \n24  older brothers, his father, and his grandmother.  They also severely mistreated other \n25  members of the family, and raped his mother. \n26  55.  Mr. Abdikadir and his surviving family members then fled to Kenya, where \n27 \n28  Yussufis his given name, while Abdikadir is his father's given name. \n8 \n14 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 17 of 33   Page ID #:554\n1  they lived in various refugee camps for most of the next two decades.  He married \n2  Shukri Hussein, also a Somalian refugee, while in the camps, and the couple had three \n3  children.  (Ms. Hussein also has a son from a prior relationship, who is now Mr. \n4  Abdikadir's step-son). \n5  56.  Life in the refugee camps was very hard for Mr. Abdikadir and his family. \n6  Kenya granted them no permanent status, and as a result they were forced to live in \n7  the camps and denied the right to work.  At the same time, the Kenyan government \n8  and international agencies failed to provide sufficient food for the refugees.  He and \n9  his family would have to wait for hours during the heat of the day to obtain their small \n10  food rations, and often were mistreated by the Kenyan authorities while waiting.  Mr. \n11  Abdikadir occasionally worked illegally in order to supplement his family's meager \n12  provisions, but Kenyan authorities arrested and punished him for doing so.  The \n13  Kenyan authorities also did little if anything to stop the bandits who would raid the \n14  camps at night, raping camp residents and pillaging their belongings. \n15  57.  After life in the camps became too difficult, Mr. Abdikadir's mother managed \n16  to sell some land the family owned in Somalia, and used these proceeds to procure \n17  funds to allow her son to escape.  Unable to return to Somalia or survive further life in \n18  the Kenyan refugee camps, Mr. Abdikadir fled.  He traveled a circuitous route in \n19  search of a country with refugee protections, and ultimately arrived at the southern \n20  border of the United States seeking asylum. \n21  58.  At the border crossing from Tijuana he presented a birth certificate and applied \n22  for asylum, entering ICE detention in March 2010.  He was sent to Mira Lorna shortly \n23  afterward, and passed his credible fear interview several weeks later, in approximately \n24  April 2010. \n25  59.  Mr. Abdikadir has been before an immigration judge several times since then, \n26  but has yet to even submit an application for asylum, because he was unable to find a \n27  lawyer to represent him and speaks virtually no English. \n28  60.  Mr. Abdikadir has also applied for release on parole under 8 C.F.R. \n15 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 18 of 33   Page ID #:555\n1  212(d)(5)(A).  As with Mr. Farah, the decision whether or not to release Mr. \n2  Abdikadir is made by a single officer, with no appeal process, and without a hearing \n3  of any kind.  Mr. Abdikadir requested release from this officer, and in doing so \n4  provided his birth certificate as well as a sworn affidavit from a friend of his who lives \n5  in San Diego and is willing to house and assist him.  Nonetheless, his parole request \n6  was denied.  The sole explanation provided was a check mark in a box next to a \n7  paragraph which states \"You have not established to ICE's satisfaction that you will \n8  appear as required for immigration hearings, enforcement appointments, or other \n9  matters, if you are paroled from detention.\"  Other than requesting a redetermination \n10  based on changed circumstances, Mr. Abdikadir has no recourse to any further process \n11  for appeal. \n12  61.  Mr. Abdikadir has suffered during his time in detention, not only because of the \n13  traumatic effects of detention in general on those who have suffered past persecution, \n14  but also because of his medical problems.  Mr. Abdikadir has some kind of problem \n15  concerning his eyes - perhaps tied to light sensitivity -- that causes them to be \n16  constantly red and irritated.  Although he has sought medical attention for this \n17  problem at the Mira Lorna Detention Center, the clinic there has not provided him \n18  with any medication that has addressed the problem. \n19  62.  Mr. Abdikadir has been unable to communicate with his family while in \n20  detention.  He awaits the opportunity to win his release and his status, so that he can \n21  begin to recover from the years of suffering he has faced, and also so that he can speak \n22  with and hopefully some day re-unite with his wife and children.  Given that he has \n23  not even submitted an asylum application yet, he will remain incarcerated without a \n24  hearing for months more absent this Court's intervention. \n25 \nAbel Perez Ruelas \n26 \n63.  Abel Perez Ruelas is a citizen of Mexico. He has been in immigration detention \n27 \nat Mira Lorna Detention Center for 17 months, since April 8, 2009. \n28 \n16 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 19 of 33   Page ID #:556\n1  64.  Mr. Perez Ruelas was born on January 25, 1967 in Jalisco, Mexico. In 1996, he \n2  met Maria del Rosario, with whom he had a daughter, Azirit Lessandra, one year later. \n3  65.  He was admitted to the United States in 2002 on a visitors' visa, two years after \n4  he broke up and lost contact with with Ms. del Rosario. \n5  66.  In approximately 2007, about five years after Mr. Perez-Ruelas came to live in \n6  the United States, he received a call from his mother, who told him that Ms. del \n7  Rosario had died in childbirth in Mexico, and that his daughter had been sent to live \n8  with her mother's parents.  Since then, Mr. Perez Ruelas has been living with the hope \n9  that one day he may bring his daughter to the United States to live with him. \n10  67.  On December 22,2008, Mr. Perez Ruelas married Maria Navichoque Perez, a \n11  U.S. citizen. She is a nurse at the Los Angeles Jewish Home, a non-profit senior living \n12  facility in Reseda, California.  The couple filed to adjust his status based on their \n13  marriage in approximately February 2009. \n14  68.  After his marriage, Mr. Perez Ruelas became the stepfather of Maria Perez's \n15  four children, all of whom are U.S. citizens by birth. The two youngest children, \n16  Hector and Emily, live with Mr. Perez Ruelas and his wife in their home in Reseda, \n17  California. \n18  69.  Mr. Perez Ruelas has lived and worked in the United States for almost eight \n19  years. He works in construction, primarily with cement and tiles.  Prior to his \n20  detention, he regularly attended church with his wife in Pacoima and Reseda. \n21  70.  Mr. Perez Ruelas has had three prior convictions for driving under the influence \n22  of alcohol, none for which he spent more than two months in jail. Mr. Perez Ruelas \n23  served three months of probation for his first offense in 1994; he served 10 days in jail \n24  for his second, a decade later in 2004; and he served 60 days in jail for his third, which \n25  occurred four years later.  Pursuant to his sentence for the last conviction, Mr. Perez \n26  Ruelas has diligently attended Alcoholics Anonymous for over a year, and has \n27  continued attending AA meetings even while in immigration detention. \n28  7l.  On or about April 8, 2009, Mr. Perez Ruelas was released from jail for his last \n17 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 20 of 33   Page ID #:557\n1  offense.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials immediately took him into \n2  immigration custody, notwithstanding his pending application to adjust his status \n3  based on his marriage.  At the time, Mr. Perez-Ruelas was in the process of becoming \n4  a lawful permanent resident of the United States. \n5  72.  Mr. Perez Ruelas was given a bond hearing on April 21, 2009, pursuant to 8 \n6  U.S.C. 1226(a), at which he bore the burden to prove that he was not a danger or flight \n7  risk.  Upon information and belief, the immigration judge knew that Mr. Perez Ruelas \n8  was married to a U.S. citizen and that he had a pending adjustment application, but \n9  nonetheless the judge denied him release on bail.  He told Mr. Perez Ruelas that his \n10  prior DUI convictions made him a danger to society, even though his sentence had \n11  long since expired. \n12  73.  With the assistance of his attorney, Mr. Perez Ruelas applied for a bond \n13  reduction in February 2010. At that hearing, the immigration judge set a bond of \n14  $5,000, an amount too high for Mr. Perez Ruelas's family to pay. \n15  74.  Because he could not pay, Mr. Perez Ruelas remained in immigration detention \n16  - where he has been for the past 16 months awaiting adjudication of his case.  His last \n17   hearing was over four months ago, on April 15, 2010. \n18  75.  On July 30,2010, Mr. Perez Ruelas and his wife received notice that their \n19  application to adjust his status had been approved, with a priority date of March 22, \n20  2009.  Although he is entitled to adjust status immediately and will no doubt \n21  ultimately prevail in his immigration case, he nonetheless remains detained for no \n22  apparent reason, merely because under the stringent standard applied at his bond \n23  hearing he cannot pay the bond that the immigration judge set in his case. \n24 \nJose Farias Cornejo \n25 \n26  76.  Jose Farias Cornejo is a citizen of Mexico and a lawful permanent resident of \n27  the United States. He has been in immigration detention at Mira Loma Detention \n28  Center for over eleven months, since September 14,2009. \n18 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 21 of 33   Page ID #:558\n1  77.  Mr. Farias Cornejo was born on August 14, 1984 in Michoacan, Mexico. He \n2  was brought to the United States prior to his first birthday by his parents, who were \n3  migrant farm workers. He has never left this country, and speaks fluent English. \n4  78.  Mr. Farias Cornejo has four siblings. All four are U.S. citizens.  Mr. Farias \n5  Cornejo's mother is also a lawful permanent resident of the United States. \n6  79.  Mr. Farias Cornejo spent his childhood years in Washington and his \n7  adolescence in California because his parents were migrant farm workers. He attended \n8  elementary school in San Diego for a few years before moving to Montclair, \n9  California to attend middle school and high school. He took special education classes \n10  at Montclair High School because of his diagnosed learning disability. \n11  80.  After graduating from high school, Mr. Farias Cornejo worked at various jobs \n12  near his hometown in California, including in construction -- manufacturing jacuzzis \n13  and landscaping. \n14  81.  Mr. Farias Cornejo has had several prior convictions. In 2007, he was convicted \n15  of possession of methamphetamine and was given the opportunity to receive \n16  substance abuse treatment as an alternative to incarceration under California \n17  Proposition 36.  Mr. Farias Cornejo diligently completed his drug treatment classes, \n18  but because he could not afford to pay the mandatory fine, he was sentenced to 180 \n19  days in jail. \n20  82.  Upon information and belief, in 2009 Mr. Farias Cornejo was convicted of a \n21  misdemeanor California theft offense, for which he spent 14 days in jail.  In that same \n22  year, he was convicted of being under the influence of a controlled substance, for \n23  which he spent 60 days in jail. \n24 \n83.  Shortly after serving his last sentence, in September 2009, federal immigration \n25 \nofficials initiated removal proceedings against him and placed him in immigration \n26 \ndetention, citing their authority to mandatorily detain any individual with a prior \n27 \ncontrolled substance offense under 8 U.S.C. 1226(c). \n28 \n19 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 22 of 33   Page ID #:559\n1  84.  Although the government contends that Mr. Farias Cornejo is subject to \n2  \"mandatory detention\" without a bond hearing under that provision, it has \n3  acknowledged that he is eligible for relief from removal in the form of cancellation of \n4  removal under 8 U.S.C. 1229b, because he has not been convicted of an \"aggravated \n5  felony.\" \n6  85.  Mr. Farias Cornejo was given a cancellation application on October of 2009, \n7  but struggled to find an attorney to assist him in completing it.  After five months in \n8  detention, he finally found an attorney, but that attorney did not file his application. \n9  Eventually Mr. Farias Cornejo found a different attorney to represent him, in June of \n10  this year.  Through his new attorney Mr. Farias Cornejo finally filed his cancellation \n11  application, nearly ten months after he was placed into immigration detention. \n12  86.  Upon information and belief, at his cancellation hearing on August 17,2010, \n13  the government stated that it had no objection to his application.  However, the \n14  immigration judge told Mr. Farias Cornejo that he had an outstanding warrant, and \n15  therefore refused to adjudicate the application.  Instead, the judge set his next court \n16  hearing for November 15,2010, apparently on the assumption that his warrant would \n17  be resolved prior to that time. \n18  87.  Although Mr. Farias Cornejo poses no flight risk, is not a danger to the \n19  community, and is eligible for relief from removal, he remains subject to continued \n20  detention. He has never had a hearing to determine whether his detention remains \n21  justified even though he has now been incarcerated for nearly a year. \n22  Angel Armando Amaya \n23  88.  Angel Armando Amaya is a citizen ofEl Salvador who was born on August 20, \n24 \n1976.  He came to the United States with his family at the age of eleven and has never \n25  left.  He attended junior high and high school in Southern California. \n26  89.  Prior to his arrest by immigration authorities, Mr. Amaya lived with his mother, \n27  Maria, who is a United States citizen, and was also frequently in touch with his \n28  brother and sister, both of whom live in Southern California.  (He also has an older \n20 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 23 of 33   Page ID #:560\n1  brother who lives in El Salvador). \n2  90.  Mr. Amaya has worked in the United States his entire adult life, engaging in a \n3  variety of construction-related jobs including forklift driving, materials handling, \n4  landscaping, and in shipping and receiving. \n5  91.  Immigration officials arrested Mr. Amaya in what apparently was a worksite \n6  raid in approximately 1994.  At that time, government officials detained him at the \n7  San Pedro Detention facility.  He eventually had a hearing before an immigration \n8  judge who ordered him released on bond because he was eligible for relief under the \n9  Nicaraguan and Cuban Adjustment Relief Act (\"NACARA\").  The judge instructed \n10   him to find a lawyer to help him apply. \n11  92.  Shortly afterward, when Mr. Amaya went to the federal immigration building, \n12  he met a man acting as an attorney named Jose Quinones.  Mr. Quinones offered to \n13  file Mr. Amaya's NACARA application for a fee. \n14  93.  Mr. Quinones eventually filed the application, which was based on Mr. \n15  Amaya's mother's eligibility for NACARA.  A hearing on the application was set for \n16  October 29, 1999. \n17  94.  Shortly before the hearing, Mr. Amaya's mother became seriously ill.  Because \n18  he had to take his mother to the hospital and attend to her, Mr. Amaya could not \n19  attend the court hearing.  At the hearing, the immigration judge ordered him removed \n20  in absentia, notwithstanding the fact that he was prima facie eligible for NACARA \n21  relief. \n22  95.  A few days after the hearing, after his mother's condition had stabilized, Mr. \n23  Amaya called Mr. Quinones to discuss his immigration case.  Mr. Quinones stated \n24  that the case now had to be re-opened, and that he would charge Mr. Amaya several \n25  thousand dollars to do this.  When Mr. Amaya stated that he did not have such funds \n26  available, Mr. Quinones told him to contact him when he had saved up the money.  He \n27  did not mention that Mr. Amaya had to file the motion within 180 days, as is required, \n28  or that he could be deported ifhe did not file the motion. \n21 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 24 of 33   Page ID #:561\n1  96.  Several years later, Mr. Quinones was suspended from practicing before the \n2  immigration courts by the Executive Office of Immigration Review.  Ifhe ever was a \n3  licensed attorney, he has presumably been disbarred. \n4  97.  Mr. Amaya continued to live and work in the United States for the ensuing \n5  decade.  Upon information and belief, he received several misdemeanor convictions \n6  for driving without a license during this time, but was not convicted of any other \n7  offense. \n8  98.  On February 14,2009, immigration authorities arrested Mr. Amaya at his home \n9  in Pomona, which he shares with his mother, based on his outstanding removal order \n10  from ten years earlier.  They transferred him to the Mira Lorna Detention Center. \n11  99.  With the assistance of non-profit legal service provider Catholic Charities, Mr. \n12  Amaya filed a motion to reopen his case based on ineffective assistance of counsel. \n13  However, the immigration judge denied the motion, and the BIA affirmed the \n14  decision, asserting that the motion was untimely and not subject to tolling based on \n15  ineffective assistance.  According to the Board, the attorney had no duty to inform Mr. \n16  Amaya of the filing deadline for the motion to reopen because the attorney never \n17  agreed to represent him with respect to the motion.  Thus, the Board declined to \n18  reopen his case, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Amaya is eligible for NACARA \n19  relief.9 \n20  100.  Mr. Amaya subsequently hired attorney Shan Potts, who now represents him \n21  before the Ninth Circuit.  The Ninth Circuit granted Mr. Amaya a stay of removal, but \n22  briefing has not yet begun in his petition for review of the BIA's decision.  His case \n23  will likely take well over a year to decide at the Ninth Circuit, given the court's \n24  substantial case backlog. \n25  101.  Mr. Amaya's incarceration has worked a great hardship on his U.S.-citizen \n26 \n27  Upon information and belief, Mr. Amaya has one misdemeanor conviction for drug \n9 \npossession from approximately 1996 and several convictions for driving without a \n28  license.  None of these render him ineligible for NACARA. \n22 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 25 of 33   Page ID #:562\n1  mother, with whom he lived prior to his arrest.  She has had difficulty paying rent for \n2  the apartment they shared, and also has suffered from the absence of his emotional \n3  support. \n4 \nCLASS-WIDE ALLEGATIONS \n5 \n102.  Petitioners are amongst approximately at least 350 detainees, ifnot more, in the \n6 \nCentral District on any given day whom the government has incarcerated for more \n7 \nthan six months without proving at an adequate hearing that their prolonged detention \n8 \nis justified.  Indeed, it is the government's policy or practice to detain non-citizens \n10 \n9 \nunder the general immigration detention statutes for prolonged periods of time \n10 \npending completion of their removal proceedings without providing them with such \n11 \nhearings. \n12 \n103.  In response, Petitioners bring this action on behalf of themselves and all other \n13 \npersons similarly-situated, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and \n14 \n23(b )(2), or in the alternative, as a representative action pursuant to a procedure \n15 \nanalogous to that provided in Rules 23(a) and 23(b )(2).  See Rodriguez v. Hayes, 578 \n16 \nF.3d 1032, 1047 (9th Cir. 2009) (allowing this case to proceed as a class action habeas \n17 \npetition). \n18 \n104.  Petitioners represent a class of all people within the Central District of \n19 \nCalifornia who 1) are or will be detained for longer than six months pursuant to the \n20 \ngeneral immigration detention statutes pending completion of removal proceedings, \n21 \n22  This Court ordered the government to produce a \"snapshot\" list of all class \n10 \n23  members on a particulate date, which the government produced for the date of April \n21,2010.  As of that day, there were 352 class members - people incarcerated in ICE \n24  custody in the Central District who had been in ICE custody for at least 180 days, and \n25  whose cases remained pending either before the immigration courts or before the \nfederal courts with a stay of removal in effect.  The list also included a number of \n26  people who were not class members because they were not incarcerated in detention \n27  centers at all, but rather in juvenile facilities, and also two people who were not class \nmembers because they were had final removal orders with no stay of removal in \n28  effect. \n23 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 26 of 33   Page ID #:563\n1  including judicial review, 2) are not detained pursuant to one of the national security \n2  detention statutes at 8 U.S.C. 1226a and 8 U.S.C. 1531-37 and 3) have not been \n3  afforded a hearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is justified. \n4  105.  The class includes people who were present in an ICE detention facility in the \n5  Central District on or after the date on which the original complaint was filed as long \n6  as they had been detained by ICE for more than six months at that time, even if they \n7  are no longer in the Central District; it therefore includes people subject to the mass \n8  transfer of detainees from the San Pedro Detention Facility in October 2007, as long \n9  as those people remain in an ICE detention facility somewhere and their cases remain \n10  pending. \n11  106.  The class excludes people who have a final order of removal and no stay of that \n12  removal order, such that the government has legal authority to remove them. \n13  107.  The class excludes people who have not been in a detention facility while in \n14  ICE custody; it therefore excludes minors living in foster-care institutions under ICE \n15  custody. \n16  108.  Pursuant to this Court's directive that the parties propose sub-classes, \n17  Petitioners propose that the Court also certify four sub-classes in this action, \n18  corresponding to each of the general detention statutes.  Petitioners propose to \n19  represent a sub-class of class members detained under 8 U.S.C. 1225(b) represented \n20  by Mr. Farah and Mr. Abdikadir, a sub-class of class members detained under 8 \n21  U.S.C. 1226(a) represented by Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Perez Ruelas, a sub-class of \n22  class members detained under 8 U.S.C. 1226(c) represented by Mr. Farias Cornejo, \n23  and a sub-class of class members detained under 8 U.S.C. 1231(a) represented by Mr. \n24  Amaya. \n25  109.  F or each putative sub-class and each detention statute, Petitioners' counsel \n26  estimates that there will be far more than forty other sub-class members in this District \n27  who, like each of the Petitioners, have been detained for more than six months, are \n28  detained under that particular general detention statute, and have not been afforded a \n24 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 27 of 33   Page ID #:564\n1  constitutionally-adequate hearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is \n2  justified.  Indeed, there may well be more than forty members of each sub-class \n3  detained in the Central District on any given single day. \n4  110. \n5  Ill.  The proposed class and sub-classes meet the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. \n6  23(a)(2).  For the class as a whole, there are several common questions of law and fact \n7  in the action.  These include 1) whether the government has a policy or general \n8  practice of detaining non-citizens in removal proceedings for longer than six months \n9  under the general immigration detention statutes without providing an adequate \n10  hearing to determine whether such prolonged detention is justified, 2) whether any \n11  general immigration detention statute authorizes this detention policy or practice, and \n12  3) whether this detention policy or practice violates the Due Process Clause. \n13  Rodriguez, 578 F.3d at 1048-49 (finding common questions). \n14  112.  There are additional common questions of law that pertain to each subclass. \n15  These include: for Subclass 1, whether 8 U.S.C. l225(b) authorizes the policy or \n16  general practice of detaining non-citizens in removal proceedings for longer than six \n17  months without providing a hearing where the government must establish that such \n18  detention is justified; for Subclass 2, whether 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) authorizes this \n19  detention policy or practice; for Subclass 3, whether 8 U.S.C. § l226(c ) authorizes this \n20  detention policy or practice; and for Subclass 4 whether § 1231(a) authorizes this \n21  detention policy or practice. \n22  113.  The claims of the named representative Petitioners are typical of the claims of \n23  each proposed sub-class and of the class as a whole.  Like all of the proposed class \n24  members, the named Petitioners will have been detained, pursuant to the \n25  government's policy and practice, for at least six months under the relevant general \n26  immigration detention statutes, without having been afforded an adequate hearing \n27  where the government has shown that their prolonged detention is justified. \n28  Rodriguez, 578 F.3d at 1048-50. \n25 \n\n. \n, \nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 28 of 33   Page ID #:565\n1  114.  The named Petitioners will fairly and adequately represent the interests of all \n2  members of the proposed class and sub-classes because they seek relief identical to \n3  the relief sought by all class members, and because they have no interests adverse to \n4  other class members.  Moreover, the named Petitioners are represented by pro bono \n5  counsel from the ACLU of Southern California, the ACLU Immigrants' Rights \n6  Project, the Stanford Law School Immigrants' Rights Clinic, and the law firm of \n7  Sidley Austin LLP.  These organizations and the attorneys working for them have \n8  extensive experience litigating on behalf of detained immigrants and broad experience \n9  litigating class actions.  Rodriguez, 578 F.3d at 1050. \n10  115.  Respondents have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class and to \n11  each subclass through their policy and practice of detaining non-citizens in removal \n12  proceedings for longer than six months under each of the general immigration \n13  detention statutes without providing an adequate hearing where the government has \n14  shown that their prolonged detention is justified, making class-wide declaratory and \n15  injunctive relief appropriate. \n16 \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \n17 \n116.  Petitioners argue that the government may not detain them for longer than six \n18 \nmonths without showing at an adequate hearing that their prolonged detention is \n19 \njustified.  Peititioners make this argument on both statutory and constitutional \n20 \ngrounds. \n21 \n117.  With respect to the statute, Petitioners argue that because their removal \n22 \nproceedings have exceeded an \"expeditious\" period, the general detention statutes \n23 \nunder which they are detained must be construed to require an individualized hearing \n24 \nas to whether or not their detention is justified.  Several decisions have already \n25 \nconstrued these statutes to authorize only reasonable detention, and to require \n26 \nindividualized hearings to ensure that detention under them remains reasonable.  See \n27 \ngenerally Nadarajah v. Gonzales, 443 F.3d 1069, 1078-79 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding \n28 \nthat because 8 U.S.C. 12 25(b) is one of \"the general immigration detention statutes\" it \n26 \n\n. \nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85'     Filed 09/08/10   Page 29 of 33   Page ID #:566\n1  authorizes detention only for a \"brief and reasonable\" period of time necessary to \n2  complete removal proceedings, presumptively six months); Tijani v. Willis, 430 F.3d \n3  1241 (9th Cir. 2005) (construing 8 U.S.C. 1226(c) to require mandatory detention \n4  only in cases of \"expeditious\" removal proceedings, and ordering a hearing to \n5  determine whether detention is justified); Casas-Castrillon v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., \n6  535 F.3d 942, 950 (9th Cir. 2008) (construing general detention statutes to require \n7  bond hearings where government bears burden of proof to validate prolonged \n8  detention).  Because none of the general detention statutes explicitly authorize \n9  prolonged detention without individualized hearings, they must all be construed to \n10  require such hearings to ensure that detention remains reasonable. \n11  118.  In the alternative, Petitioners argue that their prolonged detention without an \n12  adequate hearing to determine whether detention is justified violates the Due Process \n13  Clause.  \"Freedom from imprisonment -- from government custody, detention, or \n14  other forms of physical restraint -- lies at the heart of the liberty that [the Due Process] \n15  Clause protects.\"  Zadyydas, 533 U.S. at 690.  For this reason, detention must always \n16  be reasonable in relation to its purpose.  Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972). \n17  See also Demore, 538 U.S. at 527-29 (applying \"reasonable relation\" test). \n18  119.  In the immigration context, the primary purpose of detention is to effect the \n19  alien's deportation in the event that removal proceedings are finally concluded in the \n20  government's favor.  Zadyydas, 533 U.S. at 699 (holding that the \"statute's basic \n21  purpose\" is \"to assure the alien's presence at the moment of removal\"); Demore, 538 \n22  U.S. at 528 (upholding brief mandatory detention pending completion of removal \n23  proceedings because it \"serves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens \n24  from fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings. \"). \n25  120.  Because Petitioners and other class members suffer lengthy civil detention, they \n26  must be afforded rigorous procedures to ensure that their detention remains justified. \n27  Zadyydas, 533 U.S. at 690-92 (noting \"serious\" constitutional problem with prolonged \n28  and indefinite civil detention unless \"limited to specially dangerous individuals and \n27 \n\n. \n. \nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 8'5      Filed 09/08/10   Page 30 of 33   Page ID #:56,7 \n1  subject to strong procedural protections\") (emphasis added); Casas-Castrillon, 535 \n2  F.3d at 950 (holding that \"prolonged detention without adequate procedural \n3  protections would raise serious constitutional concerns\" and therefore that \"due \n4  process requires adequate procedural protections to ensure that the government's \n5  asserted justification for physical confinement outweighs the individual's \n6  constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint.\") (citing Zadyydas). \n7  121.  With respect to what procedures are required for a hearing to be adequate to \n8  justify prolonged detention for both statutory and constitutional purposes, the \n9  government must at a minimum provide advance notice to the detainee and then \n10  provide a transcribed hearing before an immigration judge where it bears the burden \n11  to show by \"clear and convincing\" evidence that \"no conditions of release\" are \n12  sufficient to protect the government's interests in preventing flight and danger.  See \n13  Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U.S. 348, 363 (1996) (\"due process places a heightened \n14  burden of proof on the State in civil proceedings in which the individual interests at \n15  stake ... are both particularly important and more substantial than mere loss of \n16  money.\") (internal quotations omitted); Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71 (1992) \n17  (requiring \"clear and convincing evidence\" for commitment of insanity acquittee \n18  beyond length of permissible sentence); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739,750 \n19  (1987) (recognizing that the \"no conditions of release\" standard strikes appropriate \n20  balance of interests).  In addition, a showing of particularly serious danger is required \n21  - given that detention may last for years -- and a detainee's criminal history alone is \n22  insufficient to make that showing.  Zadyydas, 533 U.S. at 690-91 (\"we have upheld \n23  preventive detention based on dangerousness only when limited to specially \n24  dangerous individuals and subject to strong procedural protections\").  Perhaps most \n25  important, the hearing must require a heightened showing based on the length of \n26  detention at issue.  Where a detainee has been detained for a long period of time and \n27  proceedings may not end in a brief time, the government must make more of a \n28  showing to justify the detention at issue.  United States v. Accetturo, 783 F.2d 382, \n28 \n\n. \n.. \nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 31 of 33   Page ID #:568\n1  388 (3d Cir. 1986) (stating in pre-trial detention context that \"[i]n some cases, the \n2  evidence admitted at the initial detention hearing, evaluated against the background of \n3  the duration of pretrial incarceration and the causes of that duration, may no longer \n4  justify detention.\"); Tijani v. Willis, 430 F. 3d 1241, 1242 (9th Cir. 2005) (ordering \n5  bond hearing where government bore burden of proof in part because the \"forseeable \n6  process [for resolution of Petitioner's removal case] in this Court\" was \"a year of \n7  more\"). \nI I \n8  122.  In addition, any unrepresented detainee would have to be afforded counsel at \n9  the government's expense at a hearing where prolonged detention was at stake.  See \n10   Lassiter v. Dept of Soc. Serv., 452 U.S. 18, 25 (1981) (noting that \"it is the \n11  defendant's interest in personal freedom, and not simply the special Sixth and \n12  Fourteenth Amendments right to counsel in criminal cases, which triggers the right to \n13  appointed counsel\"). \n14  123.  Absent the provision of such hearings, the government's detention of \n15  Petitioners and other class members violates both the immigration statutes and the \n16  Due Process Clause. \n17 \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n18 \nViolation of Immigration and Nationality Act and Regulations \n19 \n20  124.  Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every \n21  allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n22  125.  Respondents' continued detention of Petitioners and other putative class \n23 \nThis Court ordered hearings that largely comported with these requirements when it \nII \n24  granted preliminary injunctions for four individual prolonged detainees in litigation \n25  closely related to this case.  See, e.g., Order Granting Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction, Martinez v. Gonzales, CV06-7609 (C.D. Cal. January 4,2007) (ordering \n26  government to release detainee unless \"the government shows by clear and convincing \n27  evidence that he is a sufficient danger or risk of flight to justify his detention in light \nof how long he has been detained already and the likelihood of his case being finally \n28  resolved in favor of the government in the reasonably foreseeable future.\"). \n29 \n\n. \n'.  . \n1  I,  ..-c  , \nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 85    Filed 09/08/10   Page 32 of 33   Page ID #:569\n1  members under the general immigration detention statutes violates the Immigration \n2  and Nationality Act, insofar as the statutes under which they are detained do not \n3  authorize detention for a prolonged period of time absent an adequate hearing at \n4  which the government shows that their detention remains justified. \n5 \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n6 \n7  Violation of Fifth Amendment Due Process (Right to a Constitutionally Adequate \nCustody Hearing) \n8 \n9  126.  Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every \n10  allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n11  127.  Respondents' continued detention of Petitioners and other class members \n12  without an adequate hearing where the government shows that their prolonged \n13  detention remains justified violates the right to be free of prolonged non-criminal \n14  detention without adequate justification and sufficient procedural safeguards, as \n15  guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \n16  Constitution. \n17 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n18 \nWHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully request that the Court grant the \n19  following relief: \n20  a.  Assume jurisdiction of this matter; \n21  b.  Certify a class and sub-classes as appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23 \n22  (or other analogous procedures) consisting of all people within the Central District of \n23  California who 1) are or will be detained for longer than six months pursuant to the \n24  general immigration detention statutes pending completion of removal proceedings, \n25  including judicial review, 2) are not detained pursuant to one of the national security \n26  detention statutes at 8 U.S.C. 1226a and 8 U.S.C. 1531-37 and 3) have not been \n27  afforded a hearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is justified; \n28  c.

Appoint Petitioners' Counsel as Counsel for the Class and each subclass; \n7  e.  Order Respondents to provide, after giving notice, individual hearings \n8  before an immigration judge for Petitioners and each member of the class, at which \n9  Respondents will bear the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that no \n10  reasonable conditions will ensure the detainee's presence in the event of removal and \n11  protect the community from serious danger, despite the prolonged length of detention \n12  at issue; \n13  f.  Declare that Respondents' failure to provide Petitioners and the members \n14  of the class with adequate hearings violates the Immigration and Nationality Act and \n15  the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; \n16  g.  Enjoin Respondents from failing to provide Petitioner and each member \n17  of the Class, upon notice, with adequate hearings before an immigration judge (as \n18  specified above in subsection (e) of this Prayer); \n19  h.  Grant Petitioners reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and other \n20  disbursements pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. 2412; \n21  Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable. \n1. \n22  Respectfully submitted, \n23  ACLU OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA \n24  B~oY;/lf:t{z \n25  Dated:  September 7, 2010 \nCounsel for Petitioners \n26 \n27 \n28 \n31 ",

Hatter, Jr: DENYING AS MOOT 533 MOTION to \nVacate Order on Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Decertify class. Finally, \nwhile considering the procedural quagmire caused by the continuation of the \npermanent injunction, the Court simultaneously considered Respondents motion \nto de-certify the class. When the Court certified this case into sub-classes, it did so\npursuant to Rodriguez I. Thereafter, the certification of the class permeated all \naspects of this case. Indeed, the Courts original preliminary and permanent \ninjunctions ordered remedies based on class members membership in particular \nsub-classes. See Rodriguez II and III. Because the Ninth Circuit ordered the \npermanent injunction to remain in effect, the decertification of the class, at this \njuncture, would move this case backward rather than forward. As previously \nstated, that is not the direction the Court is attempting to move this case. \nConsequently, the motion to decertify the class must be denied.

FLETCHER, Senior Circuit Judge: \nPetitioner Alejandro Rodriguez (\"Petitioner\") seeks a writ \nof habeas corpus on behalf of himself and a class of aliens \ndetained in the Central District of California for more than six \nmonths without a bond hearing while engaged in immigration \nproceedings.  Petitioner requests  injunctive  and  declaratory \nrelief providing individual bond hearings to all members of \nthe class. Petitioner appeals the district court denial without \nexplanation of Petitioner's  request to  certify  the  proposed \nclass. Respondents, seeking to fill the gap left by the district \ncourt's conclusory order, assert that the district court's denial \nwas justified on any of the following grounds: 1) the proposed \nclass is undefined; 2) the claim of Petitioner is moot; 3) the \nclaims  of the  proposed class  are  unripe;  4)  class  relief is \nbarred by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f); 5) the court lacks jurisdiction \nover the claims of the proposed class in light of the holding \nin Rums/eld v.  Padilla; and 6) the proposed class does not \nmeet the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. \nWe have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1292. We conclude that none of the grounds \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 6 of 30   Page ID #:66\nRODRIGUEZ v. HAYES  11389 \noffered by  Respondents justify denial of class certification \nand that the class meets the requirements of Rule 23; accord \ningly, we reverse. \nI.  Background \nPetitioner is a citizen of Mexico who came to the United \nStates at the age of one in 1979. He became a lawful perma \nnent resident eight years later. Petitioner was arrested in April \n2004, charged with being removable based on past drug and \ntheft convictions, and detained thereafter by the Department \nof Homeland Security. Petitioner contested his removability \nbefore an immigration judge (\"IJ\"), who determined he was \nsubject to  mandatory  removal  based on  either of his  past \noffenses.  The  Board  of  Immigration  Appeals  (\"BIA\") \nreversed the IJ's finding that Petitioner was removable on the \nbasis of his drug offense, but upheld the IJ's finding that his \ntheft conviction was an aggravated felony requiring removal. \nPetitioner appealed the BIA's finding that his theft offense \nconstituted an aggravated felony and we stayed his removal \npending our decision. The appeal has been held in abeyance \npending  determination  of a  separate  appeal  to  the  United \nStates  Supreme  Court.  During  his  detention  Petitioner \nreceived three custody reviews from  Immigration and Cus \ntoms Enforcement that determined to continue his detention, \nthe latest occurring in September 2006. In conjunction with \nthese  reviews,  Petitioner  received  no  hearing  or  notice \nexplaining ICE's decision beyond mention that his Ninth Cir \ncuit appeal was pending.1 \nOn May 16, 2007, Petitioner filed the current Petition for \nWrit of Habeas Corpus against the secretaries of the Depart \nments  of Homeland  Security  and  Justice,  the  field  office \ndirector in the Central District of California for Immigration \n1Petitioner also was at one point deemed eligible for release on a bond \nof $15,000, which Petitioner could not pay. This bond order was later \nrevoked after the BIA determined his appeal. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 7 of 30   Page ID #:67\n11390  RODRIGUEZ V. HAYES \nand Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), and the head officials of \nvarious  alien  detention  facilities  in  the  district \n(\"Respondents\"). Petitioner seeks relief on behalf of himself \nand a class of aliens in the Central District of California \"who \n1) are or will be detained for longer than six months pursuant \nto one of the general immigration detention statutes pending \ncompletion of removal proceedings, including judicial review, \nand 2) have not been afforded a hearing to determine whether \ntheir  prolonged  detention  is  justified.\"  (Pet.  for  Writ  of \nHabeas Corpus ~ 39.) Petitioner asserts that the detention of \nthe members of the proposed class is not authorized by stat \nute, and, in the alternative, that if their detention is authorized \nit violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process. \nPetitioner's requested relief includes the certification of the \nproposed class, appointment of Petitioner's counsel as class \ncounsel, and injunctive and declaratory relief providing all \nmembers  of the  class  \"constitutionally-adequate  individual \nhearings before an immigration judge ... , at which Respon \ndents will bear the burden to prove by clear and convincing \nevidence that Petitioner and each class member is a sufficient \ndanger or risk of flight to justify his detention in light of how \nlong he has been detained already and the likelihood of his \ncase being finally resolved in favor of the government in the \nreasonably foreseeable future.\" (Pet. for Writ of Habeas Cor \npus 21.) \nOn June 25, 2007 Petitioner filed a Motion for Class Certi \nfication,  which was  opposed by Respondents  on the  same \ngrounds now raised in this appeal.  ICE released Petitioner \nfrom detention under an order of supervision approximately \na month later pursuant to 8 C.F .R. § 241.4. Respondents sub \nsequently  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  Petitioner's  action  on \nmootness grounds in light of his release. \nThe district court denied Petitioner's Motion for Class Cer \ntification and the Respondents' Motion to Dismiss on March \n19, 2008 in a two-sentence order. Petitioner filed the current \nappeal of the denial of class certification on July 17, 2008. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 8 of 30   Page ID #:68\nRODRIGUEZ v. HAYES  11391 \nII.  Standard of Review \nWe review a district court's decision to deny class certifica \ntion for abuse of discretion. Zinser v. AccuflX Research Inst., \n253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 2001), amended, 273 F.3d 1266 \n(9th  Cir.  2001).  However,  a district court's decision as  to \nclass  certification  is  not  afforded  the  \"'traditional  defer \nence' \" when it is not \"supported by sufficient findings.\" Mol \nski v.  Gleich,  318  F.3d 937,  946  (9th Cir.  2003)  (quoting \nLocal Joint Executive Bd of Culinary/Bartender Trust Fund \nv.  Las  Vegas  Sands,  Inc.,  244  F.3d  1152,  1161  (9th  Cir. \n2001». Here, where the district court made no findings what \nsoever in support of its denial of class certification, but the \nrecord before us is sufficiently developed, \"we may evaluate \nfor  ourselves\"  whether  the  class  should  be  certified.  Las \nVegas Sands, 244 F.3d at 1161.2 Respondents contend that we \nshould afford the full deference normally accorded the district \ncourt's order on the basis that its findings and reasoning can \nbe derived implicitly from Respondents' opposition to class \ncertification filed below. Respondents, however, offered mul \ntiple  reasons  for  denying class  certification.  We  would  be \nengaging in mere guesswork were we to assume the district \ncourt relied on any particular reason or reasons. We, there \nfore, follow Las Vegas Sands in reviewing the district court's \ndetermination. \nIII.  Definition of Proposed Class \n[1] Petitioner seeks to certify a class of detainees who are \nheld pursuant to what Petitioner labels the \"general immigra \ntion statutes.\" Respondents assert that Petitioner's use of the \nphrase \"general immigration statutes\" creates an  undefined \nclass. While not a model of clarity, Petitioner's habeas corpus \npetition and request for class certification together indicate \n2We do not opine on the appropriate course for the reviewing court \nwhen a district court makes some, but insufficient, findings, justifying its \nclass certification determination, as that is not the posture we face here. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 9 of 30   Page ID #:69\n11392  RODRIGUEZ v. HAYES \nthat  \"general  immigration  statutes\"  refers  narrowly  to  8 \nU.S.C. § 1226, 8 U.s.C. § 1225(b), and 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a). \nWhether 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A) is also included in the defi \nnition is ambiguous, as it is only referenced in Petitioner's \nsubsequent filings. This is of no practical importance, how \never, as Section 1182(d)(5)(A) merely provides for discretion \nary parole of detainees, which, upon revocation, returns the \ndetainees to the form of legal detention they were in prior to \nparole. 8 U.S.c. § 1182(d)(5); see Clarkv. Martinez, 543 U.S. \n371, 385-86 (2005) (discussing effect of Section 1182(d)(5) \non  detention status).  Hence,  we  conclude Petitioner's pro \nposed class is adequately defined for certification. \nIV.  Immigration Detention Statutes \nThe three immigration detention statutes implicated by the \nproposed class govern detention of aliens at different stages \nof the admission and removal process.  8 U.S.c.  § 1225(b) \nprovides for discretionary detention of aliens pending a deter \nmination of admissibility.3 8 U.S.C. § 1226 provides for both \ndiscretionary detention generally and mandatory detention for \ncertain narrow categories of aliens pending a determination of \ntheir removability.4 8 U.S.C.  § 1231(a) provides for manda-\n38 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(I)(B)(ii) provides: \nIf the [asylum] officer determines at the time of the interview \n[upon arrival in the United States] that an alien has a credible fear \nof persecution ... , the alien shall be detained for further consid \neration of the application for asylum. \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A) provides: \n[I]n the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the \nexamining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking \nadmission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admit \nted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section \n1229a of this title. \n48 U.S.C. § 1226(a) provides: \nOn a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be \narrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is \nto be removed from the United States. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 10 of 30   Page ID #:70\nRODRIGUEZ v. HAYES  11393 \ntory detention of aliens ordered removed during the 90 day \nremoval period and discretionary detention after the end of \nthe removal period.5 Petitioner's request for relief raises the \n8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) provides: \nThe Attorney General shall take into custody any alien who ... \nis inadmissible by reason of having committed any offense cov \nered in section 1 18 2(a)(2) of this title, ... is deportable by reason \nof  having  committed  any  offense  covered  in  section \n1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), (A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title, ... is \ndeportable under section I 227(a)(2)(A)(i) ofthis title on the basis \nof an offense for which the alien has been sentence [sic] to a term \nof imprisonment of at least 1 year, or ... is inadmissible under \nsection  1182(a)(3)(B) of this title or deportable under section \n1227(a)(4)(B) of this title, when the alien is released, without \nregard to  whether the alien is  released on parole,  supervised \nrelease, or probation, and without regard to whether the alien may \nbe arrested or imprisoned again for the same offense. \n58 U.S.c. § 123 1( a)(2) provides: \nDuring the removal period, the Attorney General shall detain the \nalien. Under no circumstance during the removal period shall the \nAttorney General release an alien who has been found inadmissi \nble under section  1182(a)(2) or  1182(a)(3)(B) of this  title or \ndeportable under section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title. \n8 U.S.C. § 123 I (a)(6) provides: \nAn alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under section \n1182  of this  title,  removable  under  section  12 27(a)(l)(C), \n1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(4) of this title or who has been determined \nby the Attorney General to be a risk to the community or unlikely \nto comply with the order of removal, may be detained beyond the \nremoval period and, if released, shall be subject to the terms of \nsupervision in paragraph (3). \n8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(l)(C) provides: \nThe removal period shall be extended beyond a period of 90 days \nand the alien may remain in  detention during such extended \nperiod if the alien fails or refuses to make timely application in \ngood faith for travel or other documents necessary to the alien's \ndeparture or conspires or acts to prevent the alien's removal sub \nject to an order of removal. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 11 of 30   Page ID #:71\n11394  RODRIGUEZ v. HAYES \nquestion of whether prolonged detention without a bond hear \ning is authorized under any of these statutes and, in the alter \nnative,  even if it  is  authorized,  whether such  detention  is \nconstitutional. These are not new questions for this court. In \na series of decisions, the Supreme Court and this court have \ngrappled  in  piece-meal  fashion  with  whether  the  various \nimmigration  detention  statutes  may  authorize  indefinite  or \nprolonged detention of detainees and, if so, may do so without \nproviding a bond hearing. Each decision has undertaken inter \npretation of the  immigration detention  statutes  against  the \nbackdrop of the serious constitutional issues raised by indefi \nnite or prolonged detention. We review these decisions to pro \nvide  the  necessary  context  to  aid  in  determining  the \nappropriateness of class relief. \nA.  Discretionary Detention \nIn Zadvydas v.  Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), the Supreme \nCourt first took up the question of whether an immigration \ndiscretionary detention statute authorized indefinite or pro \nlonged detention.  The alien there was detained pursuant to \nSection  1231 (a)( 6),  authorizing  discretionary  detention  of \naliens after the removal period. The Court held that a \"[a] stat \nute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would raise a \nserious constitutional problem.\" Id.  at 690. The Court found \nSection  1231(a)(6)  ambiguous  as  to  whether  it  authorized \nindefinite detention and, therefore, \"interpreting the statute to \navoid a serious constitutional threat,  . . . conclude[ d]  that, \nonce removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable, continued \ndetention is no longer authorized by statute.\" Id. at 699. The \nCourt determined that for six months following the beginning \nof the removal period an alien's detention was presumptively \nauthorized. Id.  at 701. However, after that period, \"once the \nalien provides good reason to believe that there is no signifi \ncant  likelihood  of removal  in  the  reasonably  foreseeable \nfuture, the Government must respond with evidence sufficient \nto rebut that showing\" in order to continue to detain the alien. \nId. Though Zadvydas dealt only with aliens detained pursuant \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 12 of 30   Page ID #:72\nRODRIGUEZ v. HAYES  11395 \nto  Section  1231(a)(6)  who  were  removable  under  Section \n1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4), the Supreme Court \nsubsequently extended its holding to the other two categories \nof aliens governed by the statute: aliens inadmissible under \nSection  1182  and  aliens  determined  by  the  Secretary  of \nHomeland Security to be a risk to the community or a flight \nrisk. See Clark, 543 U.S. at 378; see also Xi v. INS, 298 F.3d \n832, 834 (9th Cir. 2002). We have further extended the Zad \nvydas framework to discretionary detention pursuant to Sec \ntion  1225(b)  and  1226(a),  finding  that  indefinite  detention \nunder these statutes poses the same constitutional concerns \npresent in Zadvydas. See Prieto-Romero v.  Clark, 534 F.3d \n1053, 1062-63 (9th Cir. 2008); Nadarajah v.  Gonzales, 443 \nF.3d 1069, 1078-80 (9th Cir. 2006). \nHaving  applied  the  Zadvydas  framework  to  determine \nwhen  prolonged  discretionary  detention  is  authorized,  we \nhave also begun to determine what sort of bond hearing, if \nany, is needed to justify prolonged discretionary detention for \nindividual petitioners. As we stated in Prieto-Romero, even \nwhen detention is authorized by statute, \"due process requires \n'adequate procedural protections' to ensure that the govern \nment's asserted justification for physical confinement  'out \nweighs the individual's constitutionally protected interest in \navoiding physical restraint.' \" 534 F.3d at 1065 (quoting Zad \nvydas, 533  U.S. at 690-91). In Casas-Castrillon v.  Dep't of \nHomeland Sec.,  535  F.3d 942,  949-52  (9th Cir.  2008), we \ndetermined that Section 1226(a) authorized detention of the \npetitioner at issue and proceeded to discuss what bond hear \ning,  if any, he was entitled to.  We concluded that Section \n1226(a) provided authority for the Attorney General to release \nan alien detained under the section on bond following a bond \nhearing.  Id  \"Because the  prolonged detention  of an  alien \nwithout an individualized determination of his dangerousness \nor flight risk would be 'constitutionally doubtful,' \" we fur \nther concluded \"that § 1226(a) must be construed as requiring \nthe Attorney General to provide the alien with such a hear \ning.\" Id  (emphasis omitted).  Hence, we held that an alien \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 13 of 30   Page ID #:73\n11396  RODRIGUEZ v. HAYES \ndetained under Section 1226(a) \"is entitled to release on bond \nunless the government establishes that he is a flight risk or \nwill be a danger to the community.\" Id. at 951 (internal quota \ntion marks omitted); see also Flores-Torres v.  Mukasey,  548 \nF.3d 708, 709 n.2 (9th Cir. 2008); Prieto-Romero, 534 F.3d \nat 1065-66 (finding three bond hearings for Section 1226(a) \ndetainee  satisfied  due  process);  Tijani  v.  Willis,  430  F.3d \n1241, 1242 (9th Cir. 2005) (finding alien detained for nearly \nthree years could not be mandatorily detained under Section \n1226(c) and ordering bond hearing, impliedly finding  alien \nwas detained under Section 1226(a)). \nIn Diouf v.  Mukasey, 542 F.3d 1222 (9th Cir.  2008), by \ncontrast, we refused to reach the issue of whether a bond hear \ning  was  required  under  Section  1231(a)(6).  We  held  the \ndetention  of the  petitioner at  issue  beyond the  six  month \nperiod was authorized under Section 1231(a)(6). Id.  at 1233. \nWe then turned to the issue of what bond hearing, if any, the \npetitioner was entitled to for determining the necessity of his \ndetention.  We  concluded  that  while  release  on  bond  was \nclearly authorized by Section 1231 (a)( 6) and its implementing \nregulations,  it  was  unclear  whether  a  bond  hearing  was \nrequired under the statute for petitioner and what burden if \nany should be placed on the government at such a hearing. Id \nat 1234-35. Because the district court had not had an opportu \nnity to reach this question, we declined to reach it in the first \ninstance and remanded. Id. at 1235. However, in doing so we \nnoted that the issue was \"somewhat similar\" to that in Casas \nCastrillon, strongly implying that the district court's determi \nnation should at least be informed by its reasoning. Diouj, 542 \nF.3d at 1234-35. \nB.  Mandatory Detention \nWe have also dealt with indefinite or prolonged detention \nunder immigration mandatory detention provisions, including \nSections  1226(c),  1231(a)(2),  and  1231(a)(1)(c).  Section \n1226(c) provides for mandatory detention of criminal aliens \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 14 of 30   Page ID #:74\nRODRIGUEZ V. HAYES  11397 \nfor  expedited  removal.  The  Supreme  Court has  held  that \ndetention pursuant to Section 1226(c) does not raise any due \nprocess concerns. Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 531 (2003). \nHowever, in upholding Section 1226(c), the Court interpreted \nit  to  authorize  mandatory  detention  only  for  the  \"limited \nperiod of [the alien's] removal proceedings,\" which the Court \nestimated \"lasts roughly a month and a half in the vast major \nity of cases in which it is invoked, and about five months in \nthe minority of cases in which the alien chooses to appeal\" his \nremoval  order to  the  BIA.  Id  at 530-31.  We  have  subse \nquently clarified that, in order to avoid the serious constitu \ntional  questions  raised  by  indefinite  mandatory  detention, \ndetention of an alien beyond an expedited period ceases to be \nmandatory under Section 1226(c) and instead becomes discre \ntionary under Section 1226(a). See Casas-Castrillon, 535 F.3d \nat 951; Tijani, 430 F.3d at 1242. \nWe have additionally held that detention pursuant to Sec \ntion  1231(a)(2) poses  no  due  process  issues,  regardless  of \nwhether removal of the detained alien is foreseeable, because \nthe  statute  authorizes  detention  for  only  the  ninety-day \nremoval period and therefore does not create any danger of \nunconstitutionally  indefinite  detention.  Khotesouvan  v. \nMorones, 386 F.3d 1298, 1299-1301 (9th Cir. 2004). We have \ntaken the same view when an alien is detained pursuant to the \nrelated provision of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(I)(C), which allows \nthe removal period to be extended and detention to continue \nbeyond ninety days if an alien conspires or acts to prevent his \nown removal. Pelich v. INS, 329 F.3d 1057, 1058-61 (9th Cir. \n2003). The court, while \"expressly declin[ing] to endorse or \nreject  any  inferred  Zadvydas-inspired  limitation  to \n§ 1231(a)(I)(C)\" found  that,  in any case, \"an alien cannot \nassert a viable constitutional claim when his indefinite deten \ntion is due to his failure to cooperate with the INS's efforts \nto remove him.\" Id at 1060-61; see also Lema v.  INS, 341 \nF.3d 853, 857 (9th Cir. 2003) (\"We conclude that 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231(a)(I)(C) ... authorizes the INS's continued detention \nof a removable alien so long as the alien fails to cooperate \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 15 of 30   Page ID #:75\n11398  RODRIGUEZ V. HAYES \nfully and honestly with officials to obtain travel documents.\") \nKey to this determination was the court's view that \"[t]he risk \nof indefinite detention that motivated the  Supreme Court's \nstatutory interpretation in Zadvydas does not exist when an \nalien is the cause of his own detention.\" Pelich, 329 F.3d at \n1060. \nV.  Alleged Bars to Class Relief \nPetitioner seeks to end our piece-meal rulings  in habeas \nactions on the necessity of bond hearings to justify prolonged \ndetention  in  the  immigration  context  and  have  the  courts \naddress the issue on a class-wide basis across the various gen \neral immigration detention statutes. While \"ordinarily disfa \nvored,\" the Ninth Circuit has recognized that class actions \nmay be brought pursuant to habeas corpus. Cox v.  McCarthy, \n829 F.2d 800, 804 (9th Cir. 1987); see also Mead v. Parker, \n464 F.2d 1108, 1112-13 (9th Cir. 1972) (finding habeas relief \nto be appropriate in cases \"where the relief sought can be of \nimmediate benefit to a large and amorphous group\"). Respon \ndents assert, nonetheless, that various constitutional, statutory, \nand procedural bars to class relief exist in this case. \nA.  Mootness \n[2) Respondents initially challenge class certification on the \nground that Petitioner's individual claim has been rendered \nmoot by his release from detention. In fact, mootness of the \nPetitioner's claim is not a basis for denial of class certifica \ntion, but rather is a basis for dismissal of Petitioner's action. \nBecause the district court did not dismiss Petitioner's action, \nbut only denied class certification, we see no reason to con \nclude it based its denial on a finding of mootness. If it had \nmade such a finding, it would have been in error. Petitioner \nwas released pursuant to  8 C.F.R.  § 241.4, which provides \nthat  \"[t]he  Executive  Associate  Commissioner  shall  have \nauthority, in the exercise of discretion, to revoke release and \nreturn to  Service custody an alien previously approved for \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 16 of 30   Page ID #:76\nRODRIGUEZ V. HAYES  11399 \nrelease under the procedures in this section.\" 8 C.F .R. § 241.4 \n(1)(2). While the regulation provides the detainee some oppor \ntunity to respond to the reasons for revocation, it provides no \nother procedural and no meaningful substantive limit on this \nexercise of discretion as it allows revocation \"when, in the \nopinion of the revoking official ... [t]he purposes of release \nhave been served ... [or] [t]he conduct of the alien, or any \nother circumstance, indicates that release would no longer be \nappropriate.\" Id. § 241.4(1)(2) (i), (iv) (emphasis added). This \nplaces Petitioner in a position analogous to the petitioner chal \nlenging his prolonged detention in Clark v.  Martinez,  who \nwas released from detention pursuant to a discretionary parole \nprovision while  his  suit was  ongoing.  The Supreme  Court \nfound his case was not mooted: \nIf Benitez is correct, as his suit contends, that the \nGovernment lacks the authority to continue to detain \nhim, he would have to be released, and could not be \ntaken back into custody unless he violated the condi \ntions of release . . . or his detention became neces \nsary  to  effectuate  his  removal  .  .  .  . His  current \nrelease, however, is not only limited to one year, but \nsubject to the Secretary's discretionary authority to \nterminate . ... Thus, Benitez continue[s] to have a \npersonal stake in the outcome of his petition. \nClark, 543  U.S. at 376 n.3  (citations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted) (emphasis added). Petitioner asserts that the \ngovernment cannot detain him unless it can demonstrate by \nclear and convincing evidence at a hearing before an immi \ngration judge that he is a sufficient danger or flight risk to jus \ntify his detention. If Petitioner is successful in his petition he \nwould be entitled to such a hearing where the government \nwould  need  to  meet  its  burden  or  offer  him  a  non \ndiscretionary release until such time as it can make the requi \nsite showing or has an independent statutory basis to detain \nhim. This would place Petitioner in a far different situation \nfrom his current one, released pursuant to the government's \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 17 of 30   Page ID #:77\n11400  RODRIGUEZ v. HAYES \nindependent determination but subject to  revocation on the \ngovernment's  discretion  without  hearing  before  a  neutral \ndecision-maker  and  without  burden  of justification on  the \ngovernment.  Hence,  like the  petitioner in Clark,  Petitioner \nhere retains a personal stake in the determination of his claim \nsuch that it is not moot. \n[3] We further note that Petitioner's current release is sub \nject to a number of restrictions, including the requirements \nthat he remain within 50 feet of his home from 7:00 p.m. to \n7:00 a.m. every night and wear an ankle monitoring device at \nall times. Petitioner proposes that he receive a bond hearing \nto determine not only whether he should be released, but also \nunder what conditions  such release would take place.  The \nstrict limitations on Petitioner's freedom,  therefore, provide \nan additional reason why his case presents a live controversy. \nCj Cara/as v.  LaVallee, 391  U.S. 234, 238 (1968) (holding \nthat when habeas petitioner was released from custody, but \nhis felony conviction prevented him from engaging in certain \nbusinesses, voting, and serving on juries, underlying habeas \ncase still presented live controversy). \nB.  Ripeness \n[4]  Respondents additionally argue that class certification \nmust be denied because the claims of the proposed class are \nnot all yet ripe.6 \"[A] claim is not ripe for adjudication if it \nrests  upon contingent future  events that may  not occur as \n6Respondents assert that Petitioner waived any challenge to their ripe \nness argument by not raising it in his opening brief. This argument is \ngroundless. We have previously held that the failure of a party in its open \ning brief to challenge an alternate ground for a district court's ruling given \nby the district court waives that challenge. See United States v. Kama, 394 \nF.3d 1236, 1238 (9th Cir. 2005); MacKay v. Pfeil, 827 F.2d 540, 542 n.2 \n(9th Cir. 1987). Here, the district court did not cite ripeness or any other \nrationale for its denial of certification. Petitioner does not waive a chal \nlenge to any ground for denial of certification in its opening brief on \nappeal that was not relied on in the district court's order. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 18 of 30   Page ID #:78\nRODRIGUEZ v. HAYES  11401 \nanticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.\" Bova v.  City of \nMedford, 564 F.3d 1093, 1096 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal quota \ntion marks omitted). Respondents first argue that the claims \nof proposed  class  members  detained  pursuant  to  Section \n1226(a) are unripe because there is no indication yet that the \ngovernment  is  refusing  to  comply  with  Casas-Castrillon's \nruling.  This argument rests on a misunderstanding of what \nconstitutes membership in the proposed class. Members of the \nproposed  class  are  by  definition  aliens  who  have  been \ndetained without a bond hearing. If an alien who would other \nwise be a member of the class receives a bond hearing pursu \nant to Casas-Castrillon or any other ruling they would cease \nto be a member of the class. Hence, the government's full \ncompliance with Casas-Castrillon could reduce the size of the \nclass, but it could not render the claims of class members \nunripe. Respondents additionally argue that the proposed class \nsuffers from ripeness issues because it references future class \nmembers. The inclusion of future class members in a class is \nnot itself unusual or objectionable. See,  e.g., Probe v.  State \nTeachers'  Ret.  Sys.,  780  F.2d  776,  780  (9th  Cir.  1986); \nLaDuke v.  Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1321-26 (9th Cir.  1985). \nWhen the future persons referenced become members of the \nclass, their claims will necessarily be ripe. Hence, we con \nclude that the requirement of ripeness raises no bar to certifi \ncation of the class. \nu.s.c. \nC.  8  § 1252(f) \nRespondents  assert  that  8  U.S.C.  § 1252(1)(1),  Section \n306(a)  of the  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and  Immigrant \nResponsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), bars class certification in this \ncase. Section 1252(1)(1) provides: \nRegardless of the nature of the action or claim or of \nthe  identity  of the  party  or  parties  bringing  the \naction, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall \nhave jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the \noperation of the provisions of part IV of this sub-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 19 of 30   Page ID #:79\n11402  RODRIGUEZ v. HAYES \nchapter, as amended by [IIRIRA] , other than with \nrespect to the application of such provisions to an \nindividual  alien  against  whom  proceedings  under \nsuch part have been initiated. \n8 U.S.C.  § 1252(f)(1).  Part IV  includes  8 U.S.C.  §§ 1221-\n1231. See Catholic Soc.  Servs.,  Inc.  v.  INS, 232 F.3d 1139, \n1150 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc). Respondents argue that Sec \ntion  1252(f)  bars  the  proposed  class  from  receiving  any \ninjunctive relief, thereby requiring denial of class certifica \ntion. \n[5] Respondents are doubly mistaken. Section 1252(f) can \nnot bar certification of the class unless it bars the proposed \nclass  from  receiving  any  class  relief.  Respondents  do  not \nargue, and it is not the case, that Section 1252(f) bars Peti \ntioner from receiving declaratory relief on behalf of the class. \nThe Supreme Court has recognized as much:  \"By its plain \nterms, and even by its title, [Section 1252(f)] is nothing more \nor less than a limit on injunctive relief. It prohibits federal \ncourts from  granting classwide injunctive relief against the \noperation of §§ 1221-1231, but specifies that this ban does not \nextend  to  individual  cases.\"  Reno  v.  Am.-Arab  Anti \nDiscrimination  Comm.,  525  U.S.  471,  481-482  (9th  Cir. \n1999). Hence, for this reason alone, Section 1252(f)(1) did not \nprovide the district court with a basis to deny class certifica \ntion. \n[6] In addition, we conclude that Section 1252(f) does not \nbar injunctive relief for the proposed class. Section 1252(f) \nprohibits only injunction of \"the operation of' the detention \nstatutes, not injunction of a violation of the statutes. This is \na distinction we have made before in a decision vacated on \nunrelated grounds. See Ali v. Ashcroft, 346 F.3d 873, 886 (9th \nCir.  2003),  vacated on  unrelated grounds sub  nom.  Ali v. \nGonzales, 421 F.3d 795 (9th Cir. 2005). We held there: \n\"[Section]  1252(f)(1)  limits  the  district  court's \nauthority to enjoin the INS from carrying out legiti-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 20 of 30   Page ID #:80\nRODRIGUEZ v. HAYES  11403 \nmate removal orders. Where, however, a petitioner \nseeks to enjoin conduct that allegedly is not even \nauthorized by the statute, the court is not enjoining \nthe  operation of part IV  of subchapter II, and  § \n1252(f)(1) therefore is not implicated.\" \nId.  Analogously, Petitioner here does not seek to enjoin the \noperation of the immigration detention statutes, but to enjoin \nconduct it asserts is not authorized by the statutes. Petitioner \nargues  only that the  immigration detention  statutes,  to the \nextent they cannot be interpreted as requiring provision of a \nbond hearing, must be enjoined as unconstitutional. However, \nas this latter argument for relief may never be reached, it can \nnot be a basis for denial of class certification. \n[7] Respondents assert that we should not adopt the reason \ning of the vacated opinion in Ali, but instead follow our deci \nsion in Catholic Soc.  Servs., Inc.  v. INS,  182 F.3d 1053 (9th \nCir. 1999), aff'd in part and rev'd in part en banc, 232 F.3d \n1139 (9th Cir. 2000). There we found that injunctive relief for \na class asserting that the INS misinterpreted legalization pro \nvisions  of the  Immigration  Control  and  Reform  Act  was \nbarred by Section 1252(f). We stated: \n[R]egardless of the fact that the injunction provides \nrelief for a harm ostensibly created by the INS' mis \ninterpretation of the legalization provisions of part \nV, insofar as it would interfere with the operation of \npart IV, the injunction here is contrary to the plain \nlanguage of § 1252(f) and the district court lacked \nthe jurisdiction to enter it. \nId.  at 1062. We subsequently reversed this conclusion on en \nbanc review, however, on the basis that the ordered injunction \nwas issued under part V of the subchapter, rather than part IV \nand, therefore, not within the terms of Section 1252(f).

HAYES \ntrol here. The requested injunction at issue does not seek to \nenjoin the  operation of Part IV provisions to  relieve hann \ncaused by misinterpretation of other statutory provisions, but \nto enjoin conduct alleged not to be authorized by the proper \noperation of Part IV provisions. The sound reasoning of Ali \npersuades that this is not barred by the plain tenns of Section \n1252(f).7 \nD.  Rumsfeld v.  Padilla \n[8J  Finally, Respondents claim that the Supreme Court's \nholding in Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426 (2004), renders \nclass action relief inappropriate in this case. In Padilla, the \nSupreme  Court stated that \"longstanding practice  confinns \nthat  in  habeas  challenges  to  present  physical  confine \nment-' core challenges' -the default rule is that the proper \nrespondent is the warden of the facility where the prisoner is \nbeing held, not the Attorney General or some other remote \nsupervisory official.\" Id at 435. Respondents argue that this \nstatement mandates that the proper respondents for members \nof the proposed class are the various wardens overseeing their \nindividual custody. Respondents assert that this renders class \nrelief impossible because, \"at a jurisdictional minimum,\" all \nproposed class members must be under the immediate super \nvision of the  same custodian.  (Resp'ts Answering Br.  16.) \nRespondents  fail  to  recognize  that  Padilla  specifically \nreserved the  question of whether the  proper respondent in \nhabeas  challenges  brought  by  \"an  alien  detained  pending \ndeportation\" would be the immediate custodian of the alien. \nPadilla, 542 U.S. at 436 n.8. We need not reach it because, \neven were the Supreme Court's statement in Padilla applica \nble here, Respondents' argument is baseless. Respondents cite \n7Petitioner additionally argues that Section l252(t) properly interpreted \ndoes not apply to claims for habeas relief at all. We do not reach this argu \nment at this time, as it is sufficient to find that the district court may in \nsome scenario grant the proposed class some of the relief sought to deter \nmine that the class may be certified. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 22 of 30   Page ID #:82\nRODRIGUEZ V. HAYES  11405 \nno authority or rationale for the proposition that we do not \nhave jurisdiction to provide class relief in a habeas corpus \naction that meets  the  requirements  for  certification merely \nbecause class members are in the immediate custody of differ \nent facilities. Such actions have been maintained previously \nagainst single and multiple respondents. See Schall v. Martin, \n467 U.S. 253 (1984) (class of juveniles sought habeas corpus \nu.s. \nrelief from  pretrial detention under state law);  ex rei. \nSero v. Preiser, 506 F.2d 1115 (2d. Cir. 1974) (class of young \nadults sought habeas corpus relief from serving terms in state \nreformatories). Regardless of who the proper respondents for \nthe class are, we conclude certification of the class will not \npose any jurisdictional concerns. \nVI.  Rule 23 \n[9]  In  addition  to  ralSlng  various  bars  to  class  relief, \nRespondents assert that the proposed class fails  to comply \nwith the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, \ngoverning class certification. Rule 23(a) provides that a class \nmay be certified only if: \n(1)  the class  is  so  numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable; \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to \nthe class; \n(3)  the claims  or defenses of the  representative \nparties are typical of the claims or defenses of the \nclass; and \n(4) the representative parties will fairly and ade \nquately protect the interests of the class. \nFed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(a).  The party seeking certification must \nmeet all of these requirements and Rule 23(b) further provides \nthat for certification the class must fall into one of three cate-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 23 of 30   Page ID #:83\n11406  RODRIGUEZ V. HAYES \ngories. Zinser, 253 F.3d at 1186 (\"[T]he party seeking class \ncertification . . . bears the burden of demonstrating that she \nhas met each of the four requirements of Rule 23(a) and at \nleast one of the requirements of Rule 23(b ).\") Petitioner seeks \ncertification under the category provided for in Rule 23(b) (2), \nwhich requires that \"the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so \nthat final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief \nis appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\" Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(b)(2). Respondents challenge the proposed class's com \npliance with all  aspects  of Rule 23  except the numerosity \nrequirement, which Respondents concede is met. We discuss \nthe proposed class's compliance with the remaining require \nments individually. \nA.  Commonality \nThe  commonality  requirement  \"serves  chiefly  two  pur \nposes: (1) ensuring that absentee members are fairly and ade \nquately represented; and (2) ensuring practical and efficient \ncase management.\"  Walters  v.  Reno,  145  F.3d 1032,  1045 \n(9th Cir. 1998). We have construed this requirement \"permis \nsively.\" Hanlon v.  Chrysler Corp.,  150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th \nCir. 1998). It is not necessary that \"[a]ll questions of fact and \nlaw ... be common to satisfy the rule.\" Id.  We have found \n\"[t]he existence of shared legal issues with divergent factual \npredicates is sufficient, as is a common core of salient facts \ncoupled with disparate legal remedies within the class.\" Id.; . \nsee, e.g., Marisol A. v.  Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 376 (2d Cir. \n1997) (\"The commonality requirement is  met if plaintiffs' \ngrievances  share a  common question of law or of fact.\"); \nBaby Neal for & by Kanter v.  Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d. Cir. \n1994) (\"The commonality requirement will be satisfied if the \nnamed plaintiffs share at least one question of fact or law with \nthe grievances of the prospective class.\"). Nor does \"com \nmon\" as used in Rule 23(a){l) mean \"complete congruence.\" \nIn re First Alliance Mortg.  Co., 471 F.3d 977, 990 (9th Cir. \n2006). We find the claims of the class share sufficiently com-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 24 of 30   Page ID #:84\nRODRIGUEZ v. HAYES  11407 \nmon  questions  of law  to  meet  the  requirement  of Rule \n23(a)(1). \n[10] Respondents challenge the commonality of class mem \nbers' claims on the ground that class members suffer deten \ntion for different reasons and under the authority of different \nstatutes. Respondents assert that, as a result, the question of \nwhether individual class members' detention may be contin \nued without a bond hearing turns on divergent questions of \nstatutory interpretation and consideration of different factual \ncircumstances.  Respondents  are  undoubtedly  correct  that \nmembers of the proposed class do  not share every fact  in \ncommon  or completely  identical  legal  issues.  This  is  not \nrequired by Rule 23(a)(1). Instead, the commonality require \nments asks us to look only for some shared legal issue or a \ncommon core  of facts.  This the proposed members of the \nclass certainly have.  In each case in which we have  inter \npreted the scope of various statutes providing for both discre \ntionary and mandatory detention in the immigration context, \nour determinations have been guided, if not controlled, by the \nquestion of whether indefinite or prolonged detention generat \ning serious constitutional concerns is present. A form of that \nquestion is posed here: mayan individual be detained for over \nsix months without a bond hearing under a statute that does \nnot explicitly authorize detention for  longer than that time \nwithout generating serious constitutional concerns? This ques \ntion will be posed by the detention of every member of the \nclass and their entitlement to a bond hearing will largely be \ndetermined by its answer. See Casas-Castrillon, 535 F.3d at \n951 (\"Because the prolonged detention of an alien without an \nindividualized determination of his dangerousness or flight \nrisk  would  be  'constitutionally  doubtful,'  we  hold  that \n§ 1226(a) must be construed as requiring the Attorney Gen \neral to provide the alien with such a hearing.\" (emphasis omit \nted));  Tijani,  430  F.3d  at  1242  (interpreting  statutory \nframework to provide bond hearing because \"it is constitu \ntionally doubtful that Congress may authorize imprisonment \nof this duration for lawfully admitted resident aliens who are \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 25 of 30   Page ID #:85\n11408  RODRIGUEZ V. HAYES \nsubject  to  removal.\").  The  nature  of the  particular  statute \nauthorizing the  detention of individual class members  will \nplay some role in determining whether class members are \nentitled to relief, as well. Nonetheless, the constitutional issue \nat the heart of each class member's claim for relief is com \nmon. \nWe also note that a finding of commonality here serves the \npurposes of the requirement. Answering comprehensively in \na class setting the constitutional question that is at the center \nof the proposed class's claims will facilitate development of \na uniform framework for analyzing detainee claims to a bond \nhearing. This would render management of these claims more \nefficient for the courts. It would also benefit many of the puta \ntive class members by obviating the severe practical concerns \nthat would likely attend them were they forced to proceed \nalone. In many of the cases where we have adjudicated these \nimmigration  detention  claims,  the  petitioner  had  been \ndetained well beyond six months, the point at which counsel \ncontends that the putative class members should be entitled to \na bond hearing. See,  e.g., Tijani, 430 F.3d at 1242 (9th Cir. \n2005) (ordering a bond hearing after an alien was detained for \nnearly three years). Without certification, therefore, many of \nthe putative class members likely would not be able to adjudi \ncate their claimed need of a bond hearing after six months of \ndetention-that claim would become moot before the district \ncourt could come to a decision. Thus, for many of the putative \nclass members, class treatment in this case is likely necessary \nto provide the remedy sought. \nTo the extent there may be any concern that the differing \nstatutes authorizing detention of the various class members \nwill  render  class  adjudication  of class  members'  claims \nimpractical or undermine effective representation of the class, \nit may counsel the formation of subclasses. See Fed. R. Civ. \nP.  23(c)(5);  Marisol A.,  126  F.3d at 378-79  (finding sub \nclasses appropriate where groups of class members each had \n\"separate and discrete legal claims pursuant to particular fed-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 26 of 30   Page ID #:86\nRODRIGUEZ V. HAYES  11409 \neral and state constitutional, statutory, and regulatory obliga \ntions  of  the  defendants\").  Because  the  possibility  of \nsubclasses was not raised below, we leave it to the district \ncourt to reach it in the flrst instance. The parties may submit \nproposals for formation of subclasses on remand and the dis \ntrict court shall exercise its discretion to determine whether \nu.s. \nadoption  of any  proposal  would  be  appropriate.  See \nParole Comm 'n  v.  Geraghty, 445  U.S.  388, 407-08 (1980) \n(holding that court of appeals may order district court to con \nsider any proposals for subclasses made on remand). The dis \ntrict court, however, should not lose sight of the overarching \nissue:  The  circumstances,  if any,  that  would  warrant pro \nlonged detention without hearing. \nB.  Typicality \n[11]  The  typicality  requirement  looks  to  whether  \"the \nclaims of the class representatives [are] typical of those of the \nclass,  and  [is]  'satisfled when  each  class  member's  claim \narises from the same course of events, and each class member \nmakes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant's liabil \nity.' \" Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001) \n(quoting Marisol A., 126 F.3d at 376). Like the commonality \nrequirement, the typicality requirement is  \"permissive\" and \nrequires only that the representative's claims are \"reasonably \nco-extensive with those of absent class members; they need \nnot be substantially identical.\" Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020. We \nconclude that Petitioner's claim for a bond hearing is reason \nably co-extensive with the claims of the class. Though Peti \ntioner and some of the other members of the proposed class \nare detained under different statutes and are at different points \nin  the  removal  process  and  hence  do  not  raise  identical \nclaims,  they  all,  as  already  discussed,  raise  similar \nconstitutionally-based arguments and are alleged victims of \nthe same practice of prolonged detention while in immigration \nproceedings. Cf Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 869 (flnding typical \nity where class representatives suffered with rest of class \"a \nrefusal or failure to afford them accommodations as required \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 27 of 30   Page ID #:87\n11410  RODRIGUEZ v. HAYES \nby statute, and [were] objects of discriminatory treatment on \naccount of their disabilities\" in parole and parole revocation \nproceedings). \nRespondents argue that Petitioner's claims are not typical \nof the class because of his supervised release and because of \nhis aggravated felon status, currently under appeal. Both are \nimmaterial.  The  single  relevance  Petitioner's  supervised \nrelease has to his claim is to whether it renders Petitioner's \nclaim moot. Defenses unique to a class representative counsel \nagainst  class  certification  only  where  they  \"threaten  to \nbecome the focus of the litigation.\" Hanon v.  Dataproducts \nCorp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted). We have determined that Peti \ntioner's supervised release does not moot his claim and, there \nfore, no mootness defense particular to him will interfere with \nthe ongoing class litigation. \n[12] Petitioner's aggravated felon status is similarly of no \nsignificance to the typicality analysis. The claims of Petitioner \nand the class on the whole are that they are entitled to a bond \nhearing in which dangerousness and risk of flight are evalu \nated. While Petitioner's criminal history is currently central to \nthe question of whether Petitioner will ultimately be removed \nand will  almost certainly be relevant to  any bond hearing \ndetermination, the determination of whether Petitioner is enti \ntled to a bond hearing will rest largely on interpretation of the \nstatute authorizing his detention. The particular characteristics \nof the Petitioner or any individual detainee will not impact the \nresolution of this general statutory question and,  therefore, \ncannot render Petitioner's claim atypical. \nC.  Adequacy \n[13]  \"Whether the  class  representatives  satisfy  the  ade \nquacy requirement depends on 'the qualifications of counsel \nfor the representatives, an absence of antagonism, a sharing of \ninterests  between  representatives  and  absentees,  and  the \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 28 of 30   Page ID #:88\nRODRIGUEZ V. HAYES  11411 \nunlikelihood that the suit is collusive.' \" Walters, 145 F.3d at \n1046 (quoting Crawford v. Honig, 37 F.3d 485,487 (9th Cir. \n1994)). Petitioner alleged the qualifications of his counsel and \nthe lack of conflict or collusion in the court below. Respon \ndents do  not question these allegations.  Instead,  they chal \nlenge  Petitioner's  adequacy  only  by  re-asserting  their \ncommonality and typicality arguments. See Gen.  Tel.  Co.  of \nSw.  v.  Falcon, 457  U.S.  147,  157 n.B (1982) (noting that \ncommonality and typicality concerns also relate to a represen \ntative's adequacy). As we do not find that these arguments \nhave merit, Respondents have provided no reason to conclude \nthat class certification is properly denied for the reason that \nPetitioner is an inadequate class representative. \nD.  Rule 23(b)(2) \nRespondents challenge certification under Rule 23(b )(2) on \ngrounds parallel to their challenge under Rule 23(a). Respon \ndents  assert that as  class members are potentially detained \npursuant to different statutes, Respondents have not refused to \nact or acted on grounds generally applicable to the class. In \nparticular, Respondents note that some class members may \nnot ultimately be entitled to a bond hearing because they are \nproperly subject to mandatory detention and that the regula \ntions currently implementing the various discretionary deten \ntions statutes provide for a different burden of proof at bond \nhearings  than  that  found  to  be  required  by  us  in  Casas \nCastrillon for aliens detained pursuant to Section 1226(a). \n[14]  Respondents'  contentions  miss  the  point  of Rule \n23(b )(2).  \"Class certification under Rule 23(b )(2)\" requires \nthat \"the primary relief sought is declaratory or injunctive.\" \nZinser,  253  F.3d at  1195.  The rule does  not require us  to \nexamine the viability or bases of class members' claims for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, but only to look at whether \nclass members seek uniform relief from a practice applicable \nto all of them. As we have previously stated, \"it is sufficient\" \nto meet the requirements of Rule 23(b )(2) that \"class mem-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 51    Filed 01/12/10   Page 29 of 30   Page ID #:89\n11412  RODRIGUEZ v.

The fact that \nsome class members may have suffered no injury or different \ninjuries  from  the  challenged practice does  not prevent the \nclass from meeting the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).  Wal \nters, 145 F.3d at 1047; cf Gibson v.

The panel also held that the\npreliminary injunction is necessary to ensure that individuals\nwhom the government could not prove constitute a flight risk\nor danger to public safety are not needlessly detained, and\nthat appellees therefore clearly showed a risk of irreparable\nharm.\nCOUNSEL\nTheodore W.

ROBBINS 5\ntheir  continued  detention.1    The  district  court  entered  a\npreliminary injunction requiring the government to identify\nall class members detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(c)\nand 1225(b) (the “1226(c) subclass” and “1225(b) subclass,”\nrespectively), and to “provide each of them with a bond\nhearing before an Immigration Judge with power to grant\ntheir  release.”    Under  the  preliminary  injunction,  at  the\nconclusion of each bond hearing, the Immigration Judge\n(“IJ”) “shall release each Subclass member on reasonable\nconditions of supervision, including electronic monitoring if\nnecessary,  unless  the  government  shows  by  clear  and\nconvincing evidence that continued detention is justified\nbased on his or her danger to the community or risk of\nflight.”2  The government appeals that order, and we affirm.\n   1 The class consists of:\nall non-citizens within the Central District of California\nwho: (1) are or were detained for longer than six\nmonths pursuant to one of the general immigration\ndetention  statutes  pending  completion  of  removal\nproceedings, including judicial review, (2) are not and\nhave not been detained pursuant to a national security\ndetention statute, and (3) have not been afforded a\nhearing to determine whether their detention is justified.\n   2 The district court entered its order on September 13, 2012.  Thereafter,\na panel of our court stayed the injunction for 30 days, giving the\ngovernment until November 12, 2012 to comply with the preliminary\ninjunction.  At oral argument, government counsel represented that, since\nbond hearings began in mid-November of 2012, about 400 hearings have\nbeen conducted under the district court’s order.  Government counsel\nstated that about two-thirds of those hearings resulted in the release of the\nalien on bond.\n\n6 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nI.\nAt any given time, thousands of immigrants to the United\nStates  are  detained  while  they  await  the  conclusion  of\nadministrative and judicial proceedings that will determine\nwhether they may remain in this country.  According to the\nmost recently available statistics, over 429,000 detainees\nwere held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(“ICE”) over the course of fiscal year 2011; on average, over\n33,000 were detained on any given day.3  As of late 2011, the\nLos Angeles Field Office of ICE oversaw the detention of\nover 2,000 aliens, the great majority of whom were not\nsubject to a final order of removal.  Id. at 1.\nThis appeal concerns individuals detained in southern\nCalifornia for six months or longer under one of two federal\nimmigration statutes.  Section 1226(c) of Title 8 of the United\nStates Code (“Section 1226(c)” or “§ 1226(c)”) subjects\ncertain aliens who are deportable or inadmissible on account\nof their criminal history to mandatory detention pending\nproceedings to remove them from the United States.4  If an\n   3 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Enforcement and\nRemoval  Operations  Facts  and  Statistics  3  (2011),  available  at\nhttp://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ero-facts-and-statistics.pdf.\n   4 Mandatory detention under Section 1226(c) applies to aliens who are\ninadmissible on account of having committed a crime involving moral\nturpitude or a controlled substance offense, on account of having multiple\ncriminal convictions with an aggregate sentence of five years or more of\nconfinement, on account of connections to drug trafficking, prostitution,\nmoney laundering, or human trafficking, on account of having carried out\nsevere  violations  of  religious  freedom  while  serving  as  a  foreign\ngovernment official, or on account of having been involved in serious\ncriminal activity and asserting immunity from prosecution; aliens who are\ndeportable on account of having been convicted of two or more crimes\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 7\nICE official determines that an individual’s criminal history\ntriggers application of §1226(c), the alien is processed for\ndetention.  If the relevant ICE official is unsure whether\n§ 1226(c) applies to a certain individual, he may consult an\nICE  attorney  who  is  “embedded”  in  the  field  office.\nDetainees are permitted to ask an Immigration Judge to\nreconsider the applicability of mandatory detention, see 8\nC.F.R. § 1003.19(h)(2)(ii), but such review is limited in scope\nand addresses only whether the individual’s criminal history\nfalls within the statute’s purview.  See generally In re Joseph,\n22 I. & N. Dec. 799 (B.I.A. 1999).\nSection  1225(b)  of  Title  8  (“Section  1225(b)”  or\n“§  1225(b)”),  the  other  statute  at  issue  here,  applies  to\n“applicants for admission,” such as those apprehended at the\nborder or at a port of entry.  The statute provides that “if the\nexamining  immigration  officer  determines  that  an  alien\nseeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled\nto be admitted, the alien shall be detained” for removal\nproceedings.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A); see also 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV) (providing for mandatory detention\nof asylum seekers “pending a final determination of credible\nfear of persecution and, if found not to have such a fear, until\nremoved.”).  Although Section 1225(b) generally mandates\ninvolving moral turpitude, an aggravated felony, a controlled substance\noffense, certain firearm-related offenses, or certain other miscellaneous\ncrimes; aliens who are deportable on account of having committed a crime\nof moral turpitude within a certain amount of time since their date of\nadmission for which a sentence of one year or longer has been imposed;\nand aliens who are inadmissible or deportable because of connections to\nterrorism.    See  8  U.S.C.  §  1226(c)  (cross-referencing  8  U.S.C.\n§§  1182(a)(2),  1227(a)(2)(A)(ii),  1227(a)(2)(A)(iii),  1227(a)(2)(B),\n1227(a)(2)(C),  1227(a)(2)(D),  1227(a)(2)(A)(i),  1182(a)(3)(B),\n1227(a)(4)(B)).\n\n8 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nthe  detention  of  aliens  seeking  admission  pending  their\nremoval proceedings, individuals detained under the statute\nmay be eligible for discretionary parole from ICE custody.\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).5  In the Central District of\nCalifornia, detainees are notified that they will be reviewed\nfor parole and are asked to fill out a questionnaire and to\nsubmit to an interview with ICE officers  to probe their\nsuitability  for  parole.    The  agency  considers  the  alien’s\npotential dangerousness and criminal history, as well as flight\nrisk, in making parole determinations.  If a detainee is denied\nparole, he or she is notified orally and by a written form on\nwhich the explanation for the denial is conveyed through a\nchecked box.  Before the district court entered the preliminary\ninjunction, parole was the only possible release mechanism\navailable to most 1225(b) subclass members.\nAppellees  argue  that  prolonged  mandatory  detention\nunder these statutes without any possibility for review of the\ngovernment’s justification for their imprisonment by a neutral\n   5 Section 1182(d)(5)(A) provides:\nThe Attorney General may, except as provided in\nsubparagraph (B) or in section 1184(f) of this title, in\nhis discretion parole into the United States temporarily\nunder such conditions as he may prescribe only on a\ncase-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or\nsignificant  public  benefit  any  alien  applying  for\nadmission to the United States, but such parole of such\nalien shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien\nand when the purposes of such parole shall, in the\nopinion of the Attorney General, have been served the\nalien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody\nfrom which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall\ncontinue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of\nany other applicant for admission to the United States.\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 9\narbiter would raise grave constitutional concerns.  Thus,\nrelying  on  a  related  series  of  our  decisions,  Appellees\nrequested a preliminary injunction guaranteeing them, when\ntheir  detention  exceeds  six  months  in  duration,  an\nindividualized  determination  of  whether  their  continued\ndetention is necessitated by any flight risk or possible danger\nto the community.  The government argues that both statutes\nunambiguously require mandatory detention with no limit on\nthe duration of imprisonment and that the Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly affirmed the federal government’s constitutional\nand statutory authority to require such detention.  We agree\nwith the district court that, based on our precedent, the canon\nof  constitutional  avoidance  requires  us  to  construe  the\ngovernment’s statutory mandatory detention authority under\nSection 1226(c) and Section 1225(b) as limited to a six-\nmonth  period,  subject  to  a  finding  of  flight  risk  or\ndangerousness.\nII.\n“The district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction is\nreviewed for abuse of discretion and should be reversed if the\ndistrict court based its decision on an erroneous legal standard\nor on clearly erroneous findings of fact.”  Stormans, Inc. v.\nSelecky,  586  F.3d  1109,  1119  (9th  Cir.  2009)  (internal\nquotation marks omitted).  “The district court’s interpretation\nof the underlying legal principles, however, is subject to de\nnovo review.”  Id.  An overbroad injunction is an abuse of\ndiscretion.  Id.\nIII.\n“A  plaintiff  seeking  a  preliminary  injunction  must\nestablish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is\n\n10 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nlikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary\nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an\ninjunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. Natural Res.\nDef. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  To determine\nwhether the district court abused its discretion in entering the\npreliminary  injunction,  then,  we  consider  in  turn:\n(1)  Appellees’  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits;\n(2) whether they have established a likelihood of irreparable\nharm; (3) the balance of equities; and (4) where the public\ninterest lies.6\nA. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nAppellees claim that the federal immigration detention\nstatutes  must  be  construed  to  require  “rigorous  bond\n   6 The government suggests that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)\nrequires us to reverse and remand because the district court failed to make\nexplicit findings of fact and conclusions of law in its order.  Rule 52(a)\ndirects  that  “the  court  must  find  the  facts  specially  and  state  its\nconclusions of law separately.”  While in general “[a] district court must\nset forth findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting an order\ngranting an injunction,” we have held that “failure to comply with Rule\n52(a) does not require reversal unless a full understanding of the question\nis not possible without the aid of separate findings.” FTC v. Enforma\nNatural Prods., Inc., 362 F.3d 1204, 1212 (9th Cir. 2004).  In general, we\nwill remand only “where a district court’s findings and conclusions\nsupporting  the  preliminary  injunction  are  not  sufficient  to  permit\nmeaningful review.”  Id.  Here, by virtue of Appellees’ membership in the\nsubclasses at issue, the relevant facts are inherently undisputed: Each\nAppellee has been held for at least six months under one of the pertinent\nimmigration detention statutes without an opportunity to contest his\ndetention in a bond hearing.  As the government concedes, “[t]his case\npresents,  at  its  core,  a  question  of  statutory  and  constitutional\ninterpretation that does not turn on the facts of any individual Petitioner.”\nThe government offers no reason why meaningful review is not possible\non the current record.\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 11\nhearings” for members of the 1226(c) and 1225(b) subclasses.\nThey  urge  that,  because  prolonged  mandatory  detention\nwithout a bond hearing would raise grave constitutional\nconcerns, we must read the statutes in a way that permits the\npossibility of release on review by a neutral decision-maker.\nIt is “a cardinal principle” of statutory interpretation that, “if\na serious doubt of constitutionality is raised” by one possible\nconstruction  of  a  statute,  we  must  “ascertain  whether  a\nconstruction of the statute is fairly possible by which the\nquestion may be avoided.”  Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22,\n62 (1932).  “The canon favoring constructions of statutes to\navoid constitutional questions does not, however, license a\ncourt to usurp the policy-making and legislative functions of\nduly-elected representatives.”  Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S.\n728, 741 (1984).  Our task is therefore to determine whether\nthe government’s reading of Sections 1226(c) and 1225(b)\nraises  constitutional  concerns  and,  if  so,  whether  an\nalternative construction is plausible without overriding the\nlegislative intent of Congress.\nWe  begin  with  the  premise  that  “[f]reedom  from\nimprisonment—from government custody, detention, or other\nforms of physical restraint—lies at the heart of the liberty that\n[the Due Process] Clause protects.”  Zadvydas v. Davis,\n533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001).  Thus, the Supreme Court has held\nthat the indefinite detention of a once-admitted alien “would\nraise serious constitutional concerns.”  Id. at 682.  However,\nthe Supreme Court has also expressed a “longstanding view\nthat the Government may constitutionally detain deportable\naliens during the limited period necessary for their removal\nproceedings.”  Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 526 (2003).\nWe  therefore  must  determine  whether  the  government’s\nauthority to mandatorily detain aliens under Sections 1226(c)\nand 1225(b) for prolonged periods raises the constitutional\n\n12 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nconcerns identified by the Supreme Court in Zadvydas, or\nwhether  such  detention  is  consistent  with  Demore  and,\nthereby, permissible.\nThese are not entirely new questions for our court.  As\nnoted by the previous panel that reversed the district court’s\ndenial of class certification, in a series of decisions since\n2001, “the Supreme Court and this court have grappled in\npiece-meal fashion with whether the various immigration\ndetention  statutes  may  authorize  indefinite  or  prolonged\ndetention of detainees and, if so, may do so without providing\na bond hearing.”  Rodriguez v. Hayes (Rodriguez I), 591 F.3d\n1105, 1114 (9th Cir. 2010).  After Zadvydas and Demore, we\nheld in Tijani v. Willis, 430 F.3d 1241 (9th Cir. 2005), that\nthe detention under § 1226(c) of a lawfully admitted resident\nalien  subject  to  removal  for  over  32  months  was\n“constitutionally  doubtful.”    Id.  at  1242  (“Despite  the\nsubstantial powers that Congress may exercise in regard to\naliens,  it  is  constitutionally  doubtful  that  Congress  may\nauthorize imprisonment of this duration for lawfully admitted\nresident aliens who are subject to removal.”).  “To avoid\ndeciding  the  constitutional  issue,  we  interpret[ed]  the\nauthority conferred by § 1226(c) as applying to expedited\nremoval of criminal aliens” and held that “[t]wo years and\neight months of process is not expeditious.”  Id.  Thus, we\nremanded Tijani’s petition to the district court with directions\nto grant a writ of habeas corpus unless the government\nprovided a bail hearing within 60 days.  Id.\nWe expanded on this reasoning in Casas-Castrillon v.\nDepartment of Homeland Security (Casas), 535 F.3d 942 (9th\nCir. 2008).  In Casas, a lawful permanent resident (“LPR”)\nwho had been detained for seven years sought habeas relief\nwhile  his  petition  for  review  of  his  removal  order  was\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 13\npending before this court.  Id. at 944–45.  We interpreted\nDemore  to  hold  “that  §  1226(c)  was  intended  only  to\n‘govern[] detention of deportable criminal aliens pending\ntheir removal proceedings,’ which the Court emphasized\ntypically  ‘lasts  roughly  a  month  and  a  half  in  the  vast\nmajority of cases in which it is invoked, and about five\nmonths in the minority of cases in which the alien chooses to\nappeal’ his removal order to the BIA.”  Id. at 948 (alteration\nin original) (quoting  Demore, 538  U.S. at 527-28, 530)\n(emphasis  omitted).    Concluding  that  §  1226(c)  applies\nduring only administrative removal proceedings (i.e., up until\nthe  BIA  dismisses  an  alien’s  appeal  but  not  during  the\npendency of judicial review), we held “that Casas’ detention\nwas authorized during this period [while he awaited judicial\nreview] under the Attorney General’s general, discretionary\ndetention authority under § 1226(a).”7  Id.  In other words,\n   7 Section 1226(a) provides:\nOn a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien\nmay be arrested and detained pending a decision on\nwhether the alien is to be removed from the United\nStates. Except as provided in subsection (c) of this\nSection  and  pending  such  decision,  the  Attorney\nGeneral--\n(1) may continue to detain the arrested alien; and\n(2) may release the alien on--\n(A) bond of at least $1,500 with security approved\nby, and containing conditions prescribed by, the\nAttorney General; or\n(B) conditional parole; but\n(3) may not provide the alien with work authorization\n\n14 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\n§ 1226(c)’s mandatory detention provisions apply only until\nthe  BIA  affirms  a  removal  order,  at  which  point  the\ngovernment’s authority to detain the alien shifts to § 1226(a),\nwhere it remains until “we have rejected his final petition for\nreview or his time to seek such review expires.”  Id.\nHaving concluded that Casas’ continued detention was\n“authorized” under § 1226(a), we observed that “[t]here is a\ndifference between detention being authorized and being\nnecessary as to any particular person,” and thus held “that the\ngovernment may not detain a legal permanent resident such\nas Casas for a prolonged period without providing him a\nneutral  forum  in  which  to  contest  the  necessity  of  his\ncontinued detention.”  Id. at 949.  We further noted that while\n“[t]he  Supreme  Court  upheld  §  1226(c)’s  mandatory\ndetention provision in Demore, [it] did so with the specific\nunderstanding that § 1226(c) authorized mandatory detention\nonly  for  the  ‘limited  period  of  [the  alien’s]  removal\nproceedings,’” which the Court emphasized was brief.  Id. at\n950 (alteration in original) (quoting Demore, 538 U.S. at\n530).  Because Demore’s holding hinged on the brevity of\nmandatory detention, we concluded in Casas that “prolonged\ndetention of aliens is permissible only where the Attorney\nGeneral  finds  such  detention  individually  necessary  by\nproviding the alien with an adequate opportunity to contest\nthe necessity of his detention.”  Id. at 951.  We thus held that,\nunder § 1226(a)’s discretionary detention regime, a bond\n(including an “employment authorized” endorsement or\nother appropriate work permit), unless the alien is\nlawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise\nwould (without regard to removal proceedings) be\nprovided such authorization.\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 15\nhearing is required before the government may detain an alien\nfor a “prolonged” period.  Id.\nTwo  questions  left  unanswered  by  our  opinion  in\nCasas—the procedural requirements for bond hearings under\nCasas  and  the  precise  definition  of  “prolonged”\ndetention—have been answered in more recent opinions.\nFirst, in Singh v. Holder, 638 F.3d 1196 (9th Cir. 2011), we\nprovided  guidance  to  immigration  officials  as  to  the\nprocedures required at a Casas hearing.  With regard to the\nappropriate  burden  of  proof,  we  held  that,  “[g]iven  the\nsubstantial liberty interest at stake . . . the government must\nprove by clear and convincing evidence that an alien is a\nflight risk or a danger to the community to justify denial of\nbond at a Casas hearing.”  Singh, 638 F.3d at 1203.  We\nfurther held that, in considering whether the government has\nproven  dangerousness,  IJs  should  consider  the  factors\nidentified in In re Guerra, 24 I. & N. Dec. 37 (B.I.A. 2006),\nwhich include the extensiveness of an alien’s criminal record,\nthe recency of his criminal activity, and the seriousness of his\noffenses.  Singh, 638 F.3d at 1206 (citing Guerra, 24 I. & N.\nDec. at 40).  We also held that “due process requires a\ncontemporaneous  record  of  Casas  hearings,”  such  as  a\ntranscript or an audio recording available upon request.  Id. at\n1208.\nSecond, in Diouf v. Napolitano (Diouf II), 634 F.3d 1081\n(9th Cir. 2011), we addressed the definition of “prolonged”\ndetention  for  purposes  of  the  Casas  bond  hearing\nrequirement.  Diouf II first extended the holding of Casas to\n\n16 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\naliens discretionarily detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6).8\nId. at 1086.  Rejecting the government’s proferred bases for\ndistinguishing Casas, see id., we held that “an alien facing\nprolonged detention under § 1231(a)(6) is entitled to a bond\nhearing before an immigration judge and is entitled to be\nreleased from detention unless the government establishes\nthat  the  alien  poses  a  risk  of  flight  or  a  danger  to  the\ncommunity.”  Id. at 1092.  Importantly, we indicated that an\n“alien’s continuing detention becomes prolonged” at the 180-\nday mark.  Id. at 1091.\nWhen  detention  crosses  the  six-month\nthreshold  and  release  or  removal  is  not\nimminent, the private interests at stake are\nprofound.    Furthermore,  the  risk  of  an\nerroneous deprivation of liberty in the absence\nof a hearing before a neutral decisionmaker is\nsubstantial.    The  burden  imposed  on  the\ngovernment by requiring hearings before an\nimmigration  judge  at  this  stage  of  the\nproceedings is therefore a reasonable one.\nId. at 1091–92.\nWith  this  precedent  in  mind,  we  address  Appellees’\nlikelihood  of  success  on  the  merits.    Because  the  legal\n   8 Section 1231(a)(6) permits the continued detention, beyond the 90-day\nstatutory removal period that begins when a removal order becomes final,\nof “inadmissible aliens, criminal aliens, aliens who have violated their\nnonimmigrant status conditions, and aliens removable for certain national\nsecurity or foreign relations reasons, as well as any alien ‘who has been\ndetermined by the Attorney General to be a risk to the community or\nunlikely to comply with the order of removal.’”  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at\n688 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6)).\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 17\nconsiderations  applicable  to  the  1226(c)  and  1225(b)\nsubclasses differ in some respects, we separately analyze\nAppellees’  likelihood  of  success  with  respect  to  each\nsubclass.\n1. The 1226(c) subclass.\nIn addressing Section 1226(c), we do not write on a blank\nslate.  In Demore, an LPR who conceded deportability as an\naggravated  felon  raised  a  due  process  challenge  to  his\nmandatory detention under § 1226(c).  Demore, 538 U.S. at\n517–18, 523.  The Supreme Court first reviewed at some\nlength Congress’s stated reasons for mandating detention of\nthe aliens to whom Section 1226(c) applies, emphasizing\nconcerns about flight and recidivism under the prior regime.\nId. at 518–21.  Ultimately, the Demore majority held that the\ngovernment  was  not  required  to  provide  individualized\ndeterminations of an alien’s dangerousness or flight risk to\ndetain  him  during  his  removal  proceedings.    See  id.  at\n523–25.  Noting that the Zadvydas Court had already held\nthat the government’s authority to detain an alien indefinitely\npending removal would be constitutionally doubtful, the\nDemore majority distinguished Zadvydas on two principal\ngrounds.  Id. at 527 (citing Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 699).  First,\nwhile in Zadvydas the petitioners challenged their indefinite\ndetention  under  circumstances  where  removal  was  not\npracticable, thus undermining the government’s interest in\npreventing flight, see id. (citing Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690),\ndetention  under  Section  1226(c)  “necessarily  serves  the\npurpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing\nprior to or during their removal proceedings, thus increasing\nthe  chance  that,  if  ordered  removed,  the  aliens  will  be\nsuccessfully  removed.”    Id.  at  528.    Second,  Demore\nemphasized that unlike the detention at issue in Zadvydas,\n\n18 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nwhich had no clear termination point, Section 1226(c) applies\nonly during the pendency of removal proceedings and thus\nhas an inherent end point—the conclusion of proceedings:\nUnder § 1226(c), not only does detention have\na definite termination point, in the majority of\ncases it lasts for less than the 90 days we\nconsidered presumptively valid in Zadvydas.\nThe Executive Office for Immigration Review\nhas calculated that, in 85% of the cases in\nwhich  aliens  are  detained  pursuant  to\n§ 1226(c), removal proceedings are completed\nin an average time of 47 days and a median of\n30 days . . . .  In the remaining 15% of cases,\nin which the alien appeals the decision of the\nImmigration  Judge  to  the  Board  of\nImmigration Appeals, appeal takes an average\nof four months, with a median time that is\nslightly shorter.\nId. at 529 (footnote and citations omitted).  The Court thus\nupheld mandatory detention under § 1226(c), though the\nconcurring opinion of Justice Kennedy—whose vote created\na majority—noted that “a lawful permanent resident alien\nsuch as respondent could be entitled to an individualized\ndetermination as to his risk of flight and dangerousness if the\ncontinued detention became unreasonable or unjustified.”  Id.\nat 532 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (citing Zadvydas, 533 U.S.\nat 684–86).\nWe have addressed the question of how broadly Demore\nsweeps in several decisions over the past decade.  On each of\nthese occasions, we have consistently held that Demore’s\nholding is limited to detentions of brief duration.  See, e.g.,\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 19\nCasas,  535  F.3d  at  950  (“References  to  the  brevity  of\nmandatory  detention  under  §  1226(c)  run  throughout\nDemore.”); Tijani, 430 F.3d at 1242 (similar); Nadarajah v.\nGonzales, 443 F.3d 1069, 1081 (9th Cir. 2006) (“In Demore,\nthe Court grounded its holding by referencing a ‘brief period’\n. . . of ‘temporary confinement’ . . . .  There is no indication\nanywhere in Demore that the Court would countenance an\nindefinite detention.”) (citations omitted).  We are by no\nmeans the only court to interpret Demore in this way.  For\ninstance, in Diop v. ICE/Homeland Security, 656 F.3d 221\n(3d Cir. 2011), the Third Circuit construed Demore, in light\nof Justice Kennedy’s concurrence, as recognizing that “the\nconstitutionality of [mandatory detention] is a function of the\nlength of the detention.” Id. at 232 (“At a certain point,\ncontinued detention becomes unreasonable and the Executive\nBranch’s  implementation  of  §  1226(c)  becomes\nunconstitutional  unless  the  Government  has  justified  its\nactions  at  a  hearing  inquiring  into  whether  continued\ndetention is consistent with the law’s purposes of preventing\nflight  and  dangers  to  the  community.”);  see  also  Ly  v.\nHansen, 351 F.3d 263, 271 (6th Cir. 2003) (“[T]he Court’s\ndiscussion in Kim is undergirded by reasoning relying on the\nfact that Kim, and persons like him, will normally have their\nproceedings completed within . . . a short period of time and\nwill actually be deported, or will be released. That is not the\ncase here.”).\nThus, it is clear that while mandatory detention under\n§ 1226(c) is not constitutionally impermissible per se, the\nstatute cannot be read to authorize mandatory detention of\ncriminal aliens with no limit on the duration of imprisonment.\nAs we held in Casas, “the prolonged detention of an alien\nwithout an individualized determination of his dangerousness\nor flight risk would be constitutionally doubtful.”  535 F.3d\n\n20 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nat 951 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Consistent with\nour  previous  decisions,  we  conclude  that,  to  avoid\nconstitutional  concerns,  §  1226(c)’s  mandatory  language\nmust be construed “to contain an implicit ‘reasonable time’\nlimitation, the application of which is subject to federal-court\nreview.”  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 682.\nThe government relies heavily on Demore in advancing\nseveral arguments that the entry of the preliminary injunction\nwas improper, but none is ultimately persuasive.  First, the\ngovernment directs us to the statutory history of §1226(c),\narguing that by enacting the Illegal Immigration Reform and\nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), Congress\nintentionally  undid  provisions  of  the  1990  and  1991\namendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”)\nthat  previously  granted  some  discretion  to  the  Attorney\nGeneral to release criminal aliens pending removal.  The\ngovernment  cites  Demore’s  observation  that  Congress’s\nenactment of § 1226(c) hinged on its determination that the\nflight of aliens released pending removal proceedings, and\ncrimes perpetrated with frequency by those who absconded\nunder  the  prior  regime,  were  undermining  national\nimmigration  policy.    See  Demore,  538  U.S.  at  518–19.\nMoreover, the government argues that the statute’s use of the\nmandatory “shall” plainly contemplates mandatory detention\nwithout a bond hearing.  It notes that § 1226(a), which was\nenacted  contemporaneously  with  §  1226(c),  uses\ndiscretionary language and that § 1226(c)(2) provides for\nnarrow exceptions to mandatory detention for criminal aliens\nwho materially assist law enforcement.  These statutes, the\ngovernment contends, indicate that Congress knew how to\nprovide for release on bond if it wished to do so.  Finally, the\ngovernment  argues  that  under  Zadvydas  and  Demore,\nmandatory detention under 1226(c) without a bond hearing is\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 21\npermissible because such detention has a definite termination\npoint.\nWe are not convinced by the government’s reasoning,\nwhich relies on a broad reading of Demore foreclosed by our\npost-Demore cases.  Despite the Supreme Court’s holding\nthat  mandatory  detention  under  §  1226(c)  without  an\nindividualized determination of dangerousness or flight risk\nis constitutional under some circumstances, our subsequent\ndecisions applying Demore make clear that Demore’s reach\nis limited to relatively brief periods of detention.  See Casas,\n535  F.3d  at  951.    Nothing  about  the  district  court’s\npreliminary injunction order requires reading the mandatory\ndetention  requirement  out  of  §  1226(c),  because  “the\nmandatory, bureaucratic detention of aliens under § 1226(c)\nwas intended to apply for only a limited time,” after which\n“the  Attorney  General’s  detention  authority  rests  with\n§ 1226(a).”  Id. at 948.  In other words, the preliminary\ninjunction does not require that anyone held under § 1226(c)\nreceive a bond hearing.  Rather, under a fair reading of our\nprecedent, when detention becomes prolonged, § 1226(c)\nbecomes inapplicable.  “As a general matter, detention is\nprolonged when it has lasted six months and is expected to\ncontinue more than minimally beyond six months.”  Diouf II,\n634 F.3d at 1092 n.13.  Therefore, subclass members who\nhave been detained under § 1226(c) for six months are\nentitled to a bond hearing because the applicable statutory\nlaw, not constitutional law, requires one.  Thus, while the\ngovernment may be correct that reading §1226(c) as anything\nother than a mandatory detention statute is not a “plausible\ninterpretation[] of [the] statutory text,” Clark v. Martinez,\n543 U.S. 371, 381 (2005), it does not argue that reading an\nimplicit temporal limitation on mandatory detention into the\nstatute is implausible.  Indeed, it could not do so, because\n\n22 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nsuch an argument is foreclosed by our decisions in Tijani and\nCasas.\nThe  government’s  attempts  to  distinguish  our  post-\nDemore authority are unavailing.  It is certainly true, as the\ngovernment notes, that by its terms Casas concerned an alien\nwho had received an administratively final removal order,\nsought judicial review, and obtained a remand to the BIA;\nthus,  it  did  not  expressly  apply  to  aliens  awaiting  the\nconclusion of their initial administrative proceedings.  But\nthis seems to us a distinction without a difference, and the\ngovernment does not present a persuasive reason why the\nsame protections recognized in Casas should not apply to\npre-removal order detainees.  “Regardless of the stage of the\nproceedings, the same important interest is at stake—freedom\nfrom prolonged detention.”  Diouf II, 634 F.3d at 1087.\nIndeed, if anything, because LPRs detained prior to the entry\nof an administratively final removal order have not been\nadjudicated removable, they would seem to have a greater\nliberty interest than individuals detained pending judicial\nreview or the pendency of a motion to reopen before the\nagency, and thus a greater entitlement to a bond hearing.  See\nid. at 1086–87 (suggesting that a detainee who is subject to a\nfinal order of removal may have a “lesser liberty interest in\nfreedom from detention”).\nThe government is likewise correct that Diouf II by its\nterms addressed detention under § 1231(a)(6), not § 1226(c)\nor  §  1225(b).    But  Diouf  II  strongly  suggested  that\nimmigration detention becomes prolonged at the six-month\nmark regardless of the authorizing statute.  See, e.g., id. at\n1091–92 (“When detention crosses the six-month threshold\nand release or removal is not imminent, the private interests\nat stake are profound.”).  Even if Diouf II does not squarely\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 23\nhold that detention always becomes prolonged at six months,\nthat conclusion is consistent with the reasoning of Zadvydas,\nDemore, Casas and Diouf II, and we so hold.\nThe government’s remaining argument against what it\ncalls “a six-month blanket rule” is that such a rule would be\ncontrary to the decisions of other circuits and to the principle\nthat due process inherently must be determined through case-\nby-case  adjudication.    Neither  contention  is  compelling.\nFirst, the government cites the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Ly,\n351 F.3d at 271–73, and the Third Circuit’s decision in Diop,\n656 F.3d at 234, both of which declined to establish a bright-\nline time limit on detention without a bond hearing.  But both\nDiop and Ly held that there are substantive limits on the\nlength of detention under § 1226(c), and those cases are thus\ncontrary to the government’s position that Demore permits\nmandatory detention under § 1226(c) irrespective of duration.\nTo the extent Diop and Ly reject a categorical time limit, their\nreasoning in that respect is inapplicable here, both because\nthis petition is a class action (and thus relief will perforce\napply to all detainees) and because we already indicated in\nDiouf II that detention is presumptively prolonged when it\nsurpasses six months in duration.  More fundamentally, the\npreliminary injunction does not, as the government claims,\n“embrace  an  inflexible  blanket  approach  to  due  process\nanalysis.”  Rather, the injunction  requires individualized\ndecision-making—in the form of bond hearings that conform\nto the procedural requirements set forth in Singh.  Thus, the\n1226(c) subclass members are likely to succeed on the merits.\n2. The 1225(b) subclass.\nWe next address whether the prolonged detention of\n“applicants for admission” under Section 1225(b) raises the\n\n24 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nsame “serious constitutional concerns” that are implicated by\nprolonged  detention  of  other  detained  aliens.    The\ngovernment argues that the 1225(b) subclass members enjoy\nlesser constitutional protections than other detained aliens.\nOf course, if the statute does not raise constitutional concerns,\nthen  there  is  no  basis  for  employing  the  canon  of\nconstitutional avoidance.  See Ma v. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 1095,\n1106–07 (9th Cir. 2001).\nThe government emphasizes the “unique constitutional\nposition of arriving aliens” to argue that prolonged detention\nof  1225(b)  subclass  members  does  not  implicate\nconstitutional concerns.  This argument relies principally on\nShaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei (Mezei), 345 U.S.\n206 (1953) and Barrera-Echavarria v. Rison, 44 F.3d 1441\n(9th Cir. 1995) (en banc), superseded by statute as stated in\nXi v. I.N.S., 298 F.3d 832, 837–38 (9th Cir. 2002)).  In Mezei,\nthe Supreme Court rejected a constitutional challenge to the\nmulti-year detention on Ellis Island of an LPR returning from\na 19-month trip abroad.  See 345 U.S. at 214.  Adverting to\nthe now-defunct statutory distinction between “exclusion”\nand “deportation” proceedings, the Court held that:\n[A]liens who have once passed through our gates,\neven illegally, may be expelled only after proceedings\nconforming  to  traditional  standards  of  fairness\nencompassed in due process of law . . . .  But an alien\non the threshold of initial entry stands on a different\nfooting:  Whatever  the  procedure  authorized  by\nCongress is, it is due process as far as an alien denied\nentry is concerned.\nId. at 212 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  In\nBarrera-Echavarria,  we  applied  Mezei  to  uphold  the\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 25\nconstitutionality of prolonged detention of excludable aliens\nunder the pre-IIRIRA version of 8 U.S.C. § 1226(e).  44 F.3d\nat  1448.    We  held  that  the  “entry  fiction”  doctrine,  as\nexplained  by  the  Supreme  Court,  “squarely  precludes  a\nconclusion that [excludable aliens] have a constitutional right\nto be free from detention, even for an extended time.”  Id. at\n1449.\nIt seems clear that many, if not most, members of the\n1225(b)  subclass  would  fall  into  the  category  of  aliens\ndescribed in Mezei and Barrera-Echavarria as entitled to\nlimited due process protection.  See Barrera-Echavarria,\n44 F.3d at 1450 (“Mezei established what is known as the\n‘entry fiction,’ which provides that although aliens seeking\nadmission into the United States may physically be allowed\nwithin its borders pending a determination of admissibility,\nsuch aliens are legally considered to be detained at the border\nand hence as never having effected entry into this country\n. . . .  Noncitizens who are outside United States territories\nenjoy  very  limited  protections  under  the  United  States\nConstitution.”) (emphasis added) (internal quotations and\ncitations omitted).  Nonetheless, we have reason to question\nwhether Mezei and Barrera-Echavarria are squarely apposite\nto the inquiry before us.\nFirst, both cases were decided under pre-IIRIRA law.\nBecause  the  cases  apply  to  the  former  category  of\n“excludable aliens,” it is not clear that the class of aliens to\nwhom Mezei and Barrera-Echavarria applied is coextensive\nwith the 1225(b) subclass in this case.  As we explained in Xi:\nThe INA is no longer denominated in terms of\n“entry”  and  “exclusion.”  IIRIRA  replaced\nthese  terms  with  the  broader  concept  of\n\n26 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\n“admission.”  Section  1101(a)(13),  which\nformerly defined “entry” as “any coming of\nan alien into the United States, from a foreign\nport or place . . . ,” 8 U.S.C. [§] 1101(a)(13)\n(1994), now defines “admission” to mean “the\nlawful entry of [an] alien into  the  United\nStates after inspection and authorization by an\nimmigration  officer,”  8  U.S.C.  [§]\n1101(a)(13)(A)  (2002).  Concomitantly,\nIIRIRA  dropped  the  concept  of\n“excludability” and now uses the defined term\nof “inadmissibility.” Although the grounds for\nbeing  deemed  inadmissible  are  similar  to\nthose for being deemed excludable, compare\n8 U.S.C. § 1182 (1994) with 8 U.S.C. § 1182\n(2002),  there  are  substantial  differences\nbetween the two statutes.\n298 F.3d at 838.  Of course, this does not undermine Barrera-\nEchavarria’s reasoning as it relates to aliens in the 1225(b)\nsubclass to whom the entry fiction clearly applies (likely the\nvast majority).  But the Supreme Court has instructed that,\nwhere  one  possible  application  of  a  statute  raises\nconstitutional concerns, the statute as a whole should be\nconstrued through the prism of constitutional avoidance.  See\nClark, 543 U.S. at 380 (2005) (“It is not at all unusual to give\na statute’s ambiguous language a limiting construction called\nfor by one of the statute’s applications, even though other of\nthe statute’s applications, standing alone, would not support\nthe same limitation.  The lowest common denominator, as it\nwere, must govern.”).  Thus, the dispositive question is not\nwhether the government’s reading of § 1225(b) is permissible\nin some (or even most) cases, but rather whether there is any\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 27\nsingle application of the statute that calls for a limiting\nconstruction.9\nUnder current law, § 1225(b) applies to some LPRs\nreturning from abroad who have not been absent for the\nprolonged  period  described  in  Mezei.    See  8  U.S.C.\n§ 1101(a)(13)(C) (setting forth six categories of LPRs who\nmay be treated as seeking admission, only one of which\n   9 At oral argument, government counsel contended that the district court\nrecord is devoid of any evidence suggesting that members of the 1225(b)\nsubclass include returning LPRs.  This argument reveals a fundamental\nmisunderstanding of class actions litigated under Rule 23(b)(2) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, including this one.  See Rodriguez I,\n591 F.3d at 1125–26.  “The key to the (b)(2) class is ‘the indivisible nature\nof the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that the\nconduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all\nof the class members or as to none of them.’” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.\nDukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2557 (2011) (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class\nCertification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132\n(2009)).  It would be illogical for us to conclude that the government’s\nreading of the statute is permissible just because, by happenstance, there\nare currently no detainees in the Central District who possess the requisite\nconstitutional status to render ICE’s preferred practice illegal.  Nor could\nwe countenance such a result in light of the Supreme Court’s admonition\nthat, “when deciding which of two plausible statutory constructions to\nadopt, a court must consider the necessary consequences of its choice.  If\none of them would raise a multitude of constitutional problems, the other\nshould prevail—whether or not those constitutional problems pertain to\nthe particular litigant before the Court.”  Clark, 543 U.S. at 380–81.  In\nother words, if the canon of constitutional avoidance requires us to read\nthe statute such that bond hearings are available to individuals who have\nbeen detained for six months, then under Clark such hearings must be\navailable to everyone detained under the statute.\n\n28 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nrelates to prolonged absences from U.S. territory).10  “It is\nwell established that if an alien is a lawful permanent resident\nof the United States and remains physically present there, he\nis a person within the protection of the Fifth Amendment,”\nand an LPR whose absence is not prolonged is assimilated to\nthat same constitutional status.  Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding,\n344 U.S. 590, 596 (1953).  For instance, an LPR who left the\nUnited States briefly to undertake illegal activity abroad, such\n   10 Section 1101(a)(13)(C) provides:\nAn alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in\nthe United States shall not be regarded as seeking an\nadmission into the United States for purposes of the\nimmigration laws unless the alien–\n(i) has abandoned or relinquished that status,\n(ii)  has  been  absent  from  the  United  States  for  a\ncontinuous period in excess of 180 days,\n(iii) has engaged in illegal activity after having departed\nthe United States,\n(iv) has departed from the United States while under\nlegal process seeking removal of the alien from the\nUnited States, including removal proceedings under this\nchapter and extradition proceedings,\n(v) has committed an offense identified in section\n1182(a)(2) of this title, unless since such offense the\nalien has been granted relief under section 1182(h) or\n1229b(a) of this title, or\n(vi) is attempting to enter at a time or place other than\nas designated by immigration officers or has not been\nadmitted to the United States after inspection and\nauthorization by an immigration officer.\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 29\nas alien smuggling, would clearly be included in the 1225(b)\nsubclass; under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(iii), he would be\ntreated as an alien seeking admission on account of having\n“engaged in illegal activity after having departed the United\nStates.”  See United States v. Tsai, 282 F.3d 690, 696 & n.5\n(9th Cir. 2002).  But in Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21\n(1982), the Supreme Court specifically held that an LPR\narrested for alien smuggling upon return from a brief trip\nabroad  is entitled to due process protection, specifically\nbecause Mezei is inapplicable in such a scenario.  See id. at 34\n(holding that Mezei “did not suggest that no returning resident\nalien has a right to due process,” and that “it does not govern\nthis case, for Plasencia was absent from the country only a\nfew days”).  As such, it is clear that the 1225(b) subclass\nincludes at least some aliens who are not subject to the entry\nfiction doctrine, and thus under Clark the statute must be\nconstrued with these aliens in mind.11\nThis  conclusion  is  buttressed  by  the  fact  that  the\ngovernment’s  position  is  facially  inconsistent  with  our\nbinding holding in Nadarajah.  Nadarajah concerned an\nasylum seeker who had been granted relief but who remained\ndetained pending review of his case by the Attorney General.\n443 F.3d at 1071–75.  Although we examined Nadarajah’s\nclaims  under  the  paradigm  of  Zadvydas,  and  therefore\nconsidered only the possibility of “indefinite” (as opposed to\n“prolonged”) detention, we nonetheless held that § 1225(b)\nis susceptible to a saving construction to avoid constitutional\n   11 This analysis also disposes of the government’s reliance on Alvarez-\nGarcia v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 1094 (9th Cir. 2004), which involved an\nindividual petition for review brought by an alien who entered the United\nStates without inspection and thus clearly was subject to the doctrine\ndescribed in Mezei and Barrera-Echavarria.  See id. at 1095, 1097–98.\n\n30 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nconcerns.  See id. at 1076–78.  While this analysis does not\ndirectly answer the central question presented by this appeal,\ni.e. whether bond hearings are required at the six month mark,\nit  does  undermine  the  government’s  arguments  in  two\nimportant  respects.    First,  the  government  argues  that\n§  1225(b)  is  too  unambiguous  for  the  doctrine  of\nconstitutional avoidance to apply.  But it is not clear how this\ncould be so in light of Nadarajah, where we have already\napplied the canon to this very statute.  Second, and relatedly,\nthe government’s argument that there is no due process\n“floor” for the treatment of aliens subject to §1225(b) is\ndifficult to reconcile with a binding decision that already\nconstrued  the  statute  expressly  to  avoid  constitutional\nconcerns.    Thus,  read  together,  Plasencia,  Clark,  and\nNadarajah suggest that we must construe § 1225(b) to avoid\npotential constitutional concerns raised by its application to\nLPRs who enjoy due process protection.\nWith this premise in place, the likelihood of success of\nthe 1225(b) subclass is determined by the same analysis\napplicable to the 1226(c) subclass, which we conclude has\ndemonstrated a likelihood of success.  To the extent our\nholdings  in  Tijani, Casas, and Diouf II require that we\nconstrue mandatory immigration detention authority as time-\nlimited and that bond hearings occur when detention becomes\n“prolonged,” there is no basis for distinguishing between the\ntwo sub-classes in this regard.  Indeed, if anything it would\nappear that the LPRs who fall within § 1225(b)’s purview\nshould enjoy greater constitutional protections than criminal\naliens who have already failed to win relief in their removal\nproceedings,  as  in  Casas.    See  Johnson  v.  Eisentrager,\n339 U.S. 763, 770 (1950) (“The alien, to whom the United\nStates has been traditionally hospitable, has been accorded a\ngenerous and ascending scale of rights as he increases his\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 31\nidentity  with  our  society.    Mere  lawful  presence  in  the\ncountry creates an implied assurance of safe conduct and\ngives him certain rights; they become more extensive and\nsecure when he makes preliminary declaration of intention to\nbecome a citizen, and they expand to those of full citizenship\nupon naturalization.”).\nAppellees suggest two potential ways we could apply the\ncanon of constitutional avoidance in construing § 1225(b).\nFirst, we could simply read a bond hearing requirement into\nthe statute, as we did with regard to § 1231(a)(6) in the Diouf\nopinions.  See Diouf II, 634 F.3d at 1089; Diouf v. Mukasey\n(Diouf I), 542 F.3d 1222, 1234 (9th Cir. 2008) (“We have\nspecifically  construed  §  1231(a)(6)  to  permit  release  on\nbond.”) (citing Doan v. I.N.S., 311 F.3d 1160, 1162 (9th Cir.\n2002)).  This first suggestion, however, is problematic.  For\none thing, this reading would conflict with Department of\nHomeland Security regulations, at least as applied to some\nsubclass  members,  because  current  regulations\nunambiguously strip IJs of the authority to “redetermine\nconditions of custody imposed by the Service with respect to”\narriving  aliens.    See  8  C.F.R.  §  1003.19(h)(2)(i)(B).\nMoreover, it is difficult to distinguish the statute’s language\nfrom that of § 1226(c), which also provides that aliens who\nfall  within  its  scope  “shall”  be  detained  and  which  the\nSupreme Court has characterized as mandating detention.\nSee  Demore,  538  U.S.  at  513–14;  compare  8  U.S.C.\n§ 1226(c)(1) (“The Attorney General shall take into custody\nany alien who . . . .”), with id. § 1225(b)(2)(A) (“[I]f the\nexamining  immigration  officer  determines  that  an  alien\nseeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled\nto be admitted, the alien shall be detained . . . .”).  Appellees\nargue  that  the  existence  of  the  parole  scheme  itself\nundermines the government’s mandatory construction of the\n\n32 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nstatute, but § 1226(c) also contains a statutory exception to\nmandatory  detention.    See  8  U.S.C.  §  1226(c)(2)  (“The\nAttorney General may release an alien described in paragraph\n(1) only if the Attorney General decides . . . that release of the\nalien from custody is necessary to provide protection to a\nwitness, a potential witness, a person cooperating with an\ninvestigation into major criminal activity, or an immediate\nfamily member or close associate of a witness, potential\nwitness, or person cooperating with such an investigation, and\nthe alien satisfies the Attorney General that the alien will not\npose a danger to the safety of other persons or of property and\nis  likely  to  appear  for  any  scheduled  proceeding.”).    If\nanything,  the  existence  of  these  narrow  and  explicit\nexceptions to both statutes’ reach is evidence of their drafters’\nintent to make detention mandatory in all cases to which the\nexceptions are inapplicable.  Thus, Appellees’ first suggested\nconstruction is not a “fairly possible” reading of the statute as\nrequired for the canon of constitutional avoidance to apply.\nAppellees’  second  suggested  construction  fares\nconsiderably better.  Under this approach, we would simply\nfollow Casas and hold that, to the extent detention under\n§1225(b) is mandatory, it is implicitly time-limited.  This\napproach fits more naturally into our case law, which has\nsuggested that after Demore, brief periods of mandatory\nimmigration detention do not raise constitutional concerns,\nbut  prolonged  detention—specifically  longer  than  six\nmonths—does.    This  reading  also  has  the  advantage  of\nuniformity, which the Supreme Court has suggested is an\nimportant value in matters of statutory construction.  Cf.\nZadvydas, 533 U.S. at 680 (“In order to limit the occasions\nwhen courts will need to make the difficult judgments called\nfor by the recognition of this necessary Executive leeway, it\nis  practically  necessary  to  recognize  a  presumptively\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 33\nreasonable period of detention . . . .  [F]or the sake of uniform\nadministration  in  the  federal  courts,  six  months  is  the\nappropriate period.”).  Of course, the government’s detention\nauthority does not completely dissipate at six months; rather,\nthe mandatory provisions of § 1225(b) simply expire at six\nmonths, at which point the government’s authority to detain\nthe alien would shift to § 1226(a), which is discretionary and\nwhich we have already held requires a bond hearing.  See\nCasas, 535 F.3d at 948.\nFinally, we note that the discretionary parole system\navailable to § 1225(b) detainees is not sufficient to overcome\nthe constitutional concerns raised by prolonged mandatory\ndetention.  Indeed, any argument to that effect is clearly\nforeclosed by our holding in Singh, which held that bond\nhearings must be held before a neutral IJ with the government\nbearing the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence.\nSee 638 F.3d at 1203–04.  The parole process is purely\ndiscretionary and its results are unreviewable by IJs.  Cf.\nCasas, 535 F.3d at 949 (“We hold that the government may\nnot detain a legal permanent resident such as Casas for a\nprolonged period without providing him a neutral forum in\nwhich to contest the necessity of his continued detention.”\n(emphasis added)).  Moreover, release decisions are based on\nhumanitarian  considerations  and  the  public  interest,  see\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A), not whether the alien “is a flight\nrisk or will be a danger to the community.”  Singh, 638 F.3d\nat 1203 (quoting Casas, 535 F.3d at 951).  To the extent the\nprinciples of Tijani, Casas and Diouf II are applicable to the\n1225(b)  subclass,  the  constitutionally  grounded  hearing\nrequirements set forth in Singh are also applicable.  The\ngovernment  does  not,  and  could  not,  contend  that\ndiscretionary parole satisfies Singh.  Thus, Appellees are\nlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim that § 1225(b)\n\n34 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nmust be construed to authorize only six months of mandatory\ndetention, after which detention is authorized by § 1226(a)\nand a bond hearing is required.\nB. Irreparable Harm\nHaving determined that Appellees are likely to succeed on\nthe merits, we consider the remaining Winter factors.  We\nconclude that, here too, the Winter factors favor Appellees.\nAppellees clearly face irreparable harm in the absence of\nthe preliminary injunction.  “It is well established that the\ndeprivation  of  constitutional  rights  ‘unquestionably\nconstitutes  irreparable  injury.’”    Melendres  v.  Arpaio,\n695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Elrod v. Burns,\n427  U.S.  347,  373  (1976)).    Thus,  it  follows  from  our\nconclusion that the government’s reading of Sections 1226(c)\nand  1225(b)  raises  serious  constitutional  concerns  “that\nirreparable harm is likely, not just possible” in the absence of\npreliminary injunctive relief.  Alliance for the Wild Rockies\nv. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011).\nThere is no dispute that at least some individuals who\nwould be detained if not provided a bond hearing will be\ngranted conditional release under this injunction.  Moreover,\nthe government does not dispute that some subclass members\ndetained under § 1225(b) and § 1226(c) will win relief from\nremoval, further undermining any purported rationale for\ncontinued detention.  Thus, the preliminary injunction is\nnecessary to ensure that individuals whom the government\ncannot prove constitute a flight risk or a danger to public\nsafety, and sometimes will not succeed in removing at all, are\nnot needlessly detained.  Appellees have therefore clearly\nshown a risk of irreparable harm.\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 35\nC. Balance of the Equities\nThe government provides almost no evidence that it\nwould be harmed in any way by the district court’s order,\nother than its assertion that the order enjoins “presumptively\nlawful” government activity and is contrary to the plain\nmeaning of the statutes.  These arguments are obviously\npremised on the government’s view of the merits because it\ncannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an\nunlawful practice or reads a statute as required to avoid\nconstitutional concerns.  Cf. Zepeda v. I.N.S., 753 F.2d 719,\n727 (9th Cir. 1983) (“[T]he INS cannot reasonably assert that\nit is harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined\nfrom constitutional violations.”).12  Thus, in light of the major\nhardship posed by needless prolonged detention, we conclude\nthat the balance of the equities favors Appellees.\nD. The Public Interest\nThe government claims that “the government’s interest is\npresumed  to  be  the  ‘public’s  interest’  in  this  case.”    It\n   12 The government also contends that Appellees delayed in bringing their\nmotion for a preliminary injunction.  See Oakland Tribune, Inc. v.\nChronicle Publ’g Co., 762 F.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir. 1985) (“Plaintiff’s\nlong delay before seeking a preliminary injunction implies a lack of\nurgency and irreparable harm.”).  But the government identifies no\nprejudice that it has suffered as a result of this delay, and in any event the\ndistrict  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  by  declining  to  withhold\npreliminary relief from a constitutionally suspect government practice on\nthe basis that an injunction should have been requested sooner.  Moreover,\nas Appellees point out, the government declined to seek certiorari in Diouf\nII—on which Appellees’ motion relied—only in February of 2012.  The\nparties thereafter engaged in settlement negotiations, which apparently\nstalled in March.  Thus, Appellees’ June 2012 preliminary injunction\nmotion was not particularly belated.\n\n36 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\ncontends that the public interest is undermined by the heavy\nburden the injunction places on administrative resources and\nby the government’s potential inability to prepare for bond\nhearings in time to comply with the district court’s order.  But\nthe government’s arguments are flawed in several respects.\nFirst, it cites Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418 (2009), for the\ngeneral proposition that the public interest always militates\nagainst enjoining government practices.  But Nken does not\ncontain any such holding.  While the Court observed that\nthere is “always a public interest in prompt execution of\nremoval  orders,”  which  “may  be  heightened  by  the\ncircumstances . . . if, for example, the alien is particularly\ndangerous, or has substantially prolonged his stay by abusing\nthe processes provided to him,” id. at 436, it did not purport\nto create a blanket presumption in favor of the government in\nall preliminary injunction cases.  Moreover, the bond hearings\nthat  this  injunction  requires  are  intended  to  determine\nprecisely whether each individual alien is dangerous or a\nflight risk and to permit the conditional release only of those\nwho are not.  By its terms, the injunction does not require the\ngovernment to release anyone.  Thus, Nken does not support\nthe government’s position.\nThe government’s arguments regarding the resources\nrequired to implement the injunction are also not compelling.\nHundreds of hearings have already occurred under the district\ncourt’s order, belying any suggestion that the preliminary\ninjunction is prohibitively burdensome.  Moreover, even if\nthe  government  faced  severe  logistical  difficulties  in\nimplementing  the  order—a  premise  that  Appellees\ndispute—they  would  merely  represent  the  burdens  of\ncomplying with the applicable statutes, as construed to avoid\npractices occasioned by an interpretation of the statutes that\nrisks running afoul of the Constitution.  “Generally, public\n\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 37\ninterest concerns are implicated when a constitutional right\nhas  been  violated,  because  all  citizens  have  a  stake  in\nupholding the Constitution.”  Preminger v. Principi, 422 F.3d\n815, 826 (9th Cir. 2005).  It stands to reason that the public\ninterest  also  benefits  from  a  preliminary  injunction  that\nensures that federal statutes are construed and implemented\nin a manner that avoids serious constitutional questions.\nIV.\nContrary to the government’s rhetoric, this injunction will\nnot flood our streets with fearsome criminals seeking to\nescape the force of American immigration law.  The district\ncourt’s narrowly tailored order provides individuals, whose\nright to be present in the United States remains to be decided,\na hearing where a neutral decision-maker can determine\nwhether they might deserve conditional release from the\nprison-like setting where they might otherwise languish for\nmonths or years on end.  These hearings simply ensure that\n“the  nature  and  duration  of  commitment  bear  some\nreasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is\ncommitted.”  Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972).\n  “[F]reedom from physical restraint ‘has always been at\nthe core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause\nfrom arbitrary governmental action.’” Kansas v. Hendricks,\n521 U.S. 346, 356 (1997) (quoting Foucha v. Louisiana,\n504 U.S. 71, 80 (1992)).  While ICE is entitled to carry out its\nduty to enforce the mandates of Congress, it must do so in a\nmanner consistent with our constitutional values.\nAFFIRMED. ",

Good cause exists \n3\nfor the entry of a protective order because discovery in this action has and will \n4\n5\nresult in the disclosure by the parties of personal and confidential non-privileged \n6\ninformation, including electronic database information, possibly information from \n7\nalien files (or “A-Files”), and other information concerning members of the class \n8\n9\ncertified in this action and other individuals.  The parties having agreed to the \n10\nfollowing terms governing the treatment of confidential information, and the \n11\nCourt having found that good cause exists for issuance of an appropriately-tailored \n12\n13\nconfidentiality order governing the pre-trial phase of this action, it is \n14\nHEREBY ORDERED as follows: \n15\n16 1.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(11), this Stipulated Protective Order \n17\nauthorizes Respondents to produce private identifying information and other \n18\ninformation discoverable pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) that Petitioner seeks \n19\n20 without requiring officials of the United States to pre-screen each document for \n21\nobjections under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, and presenting those objections \n22\nto this Court for a decision regarding disclosure.    \n23\n24       2.  The terms of this Stipulated Protective Order will govern the parties’ \n25\nproduction of information in response to discovery requests, to the extent that such \n26\nproduction contains “Confidential Information” as defined in paragraph 3 and \n27\n28 designated in paragraph 4.  The terms of this Order shall also govern the \n  1 \n\n \n1\nsafeguarding of such information by all individuals referenced in paragraph 6. \n2\n  3.  As used in this Stipulated Protective Order, “Confidential \n3\nInformation” is defined as any information not publicly available that is disclosed \n4\n5\nby the parties in this action and which at or before the time of disclosure has been \n6\ndesignated as “Confidential” by the parties in accordance with paragraph 4.  The \n7\ndisclosure of all information that the parties previously agreed to keep confidential \n8\n9\nshall now be governed by this Stipulated Protective Order.  “Confidential \n10\nInformation” is the following: (a) the names, alien numbers, locations of, or any \n11\nother identifying information which would allow the identification of the \n12\n13\nparticular individual(s) to whom the information relates, (b) individual medical \n14\ninformation, (c) certain individual financial and tax information, (d) non-public \n15\n16 divorce decrees, (e) any information that is protected or restricted from disclosure \n17\nby statute or regulation, but which the Court has ordered to be produced, and (f) \n18\nany other category of information hereinafter given confidential status by the \n19\n20 Court.  If a designating party determines that information not described in this \n21\nparagraph should be designated as “Confidential Information,” the parties shall \n22\nnegotiate the appropriateness of that designation in good faith and endeavor to \n23\n24 resolve any dispute prior to the production of that information.  Information that is \n25\nnot “Confidential Information” includes, but is not limited to, aggregate \n26\ninformation concerning class members that does not permit the identification of \n27\n28 the particular individuals to whom the information relates. \n  2 \n\n \n1\n    4.  “Confidential Information” may be designated by the parties in one \n2\nor more of the following ways: \n3\n    a.   “Confidential Information” set forth in a response to an \n4\n5\ninterrogatory may be so designated by including the word “Confidential” in the \n6\nresponse. \n7\n   b.  “Confidential Information” contained in a document or part \n8\n9\nthereof may be so designated by marking the production of any “Confidential \n10\nInformation” with the words “CONFIDENTIAL” or “THIS DOCUMENT IS \n11\nSUBJECT TO A COURT ORDER IN RODRIGUEZ, ET AL. v. ROBBINS, ET \n12\n13\nAL., No. 07-cv-3239 (C.D. Cal.).  THIS DOCUMENT AND ITS CONTENTS \n14\nSHALL NOT BE USED, SHOWN OR DISTRIBUTED EXCEPT AS \n15\n16 PROVIDED IN THE PROTECTIVE ORDER ENTERED IN THIS ACTION.” \n17\n   c.  “Confidential Information” contained in any statement made \n18\nduring an oral deposition may be so designated through a statement made on the \n19\n20 record. \n21\n    d.    Information that is otherwise properly designated as \n22\n“Confidential Information” shall not be so designated or considered where the \n23\n24 detainee to whom the information refers has affirmatively consented to its \n25\ndisclosure. \n26\n  5.  If a Party disagrees with a designation of “Confidential Information,” \n27\n28 it shall provide the designating party written notice of its challenge.  If the parties \n  3 \n\n \n1\ncannot resolve this dispute, a non-designating party may object to and challenge \n2\nthe designation of any information as “Confidential Information” in a manner that \n3\ncomports with Local Rules 37-1 and 37-2.  The designating party bears the burden \n4\n5\nof showing that information is confidential.  Failure to challenge a designation \n6\nimmediately does not waive a party’s ability to bring a later challenge.   \n7\n  6.    Information designated as “Confidential Information,” including the \n8\n9\nportion of any document containing “Confidential” information, may be disclosed \n10\nby a non-designating party only to the following persons: \n11\n    a.  counsel for the parties to this action and any support staff and \n12\n13\nother employees of such counsel assisting in this action with an appropriate need \n14\nto know; \n15\n16     b.   any experts retained for this action by counsel to a party or \n17\nsupport staff or employees of such an expert, subject to paragraph 9; \n18\n    c.  any other person mutually authorized by the parties’ counsel to \n19\n20 examine such information, subject to paragraph 9;  \n21\n    d.  the Court and its personnel, including court reporters. \n22\n  7.  All persons listed in paragraph 6(a) to whom “Confidential” \n23\n24 information is disclosed are hereby prohibited from disclosing to, or otherwise \n25\ndiscussing with, any person other than those listed in paragraph 6(a)-(d), any \n26\ninformation designated as “Confidential Information,” except as provided in this \n27\n28 Stipulated Protective Order. \n  4 \n\n \n1\n  8.  All persons listed in paragraphs 6(b) and 6(c) to whom “Confidential \n2\nInformation” is disclosed shall first be required to read the terms of this Stipulated \n3\nProtective Order and sign a copy of the Acknowledgment of Protective Order \n4\n5\nform, attached hereto as Exhibit A, agreeing to be bound thereby.  This \n6\nrequirement does not apply to the disclosure of Confidential Information to the \n7\nCourt and its personnel, including court reporters.  \n8\n9\n  9.  In the event a party wishes to use any “Confidential Information” \n10\nproduced under this Stipulated Protective Order to move the Court to resolve a \n11\nmatter arising from litigating this action only, or to oppose such motion, such \n12\n13\npleadings shall be filed in accordance with Local Rule 79-5.       \n14\n  10.  If a party expects to use “Confidential Information” at any hearing, \n15\n16 trial, or appellate proceeding in this action, the non-designating party shall provide \n17\nthe designating party with sufficient opportunity to request that the Court exclude \n18\nthe information from the public record.   \n19\n20   11.  Except as provided in this paragraph or elsewhere in this Stipulated \n21\nProtective Order, all discovery produced or exchanged that contains designated \n22\n“Confidential Information” shall be used solely for the purposes of litigating this \n23\n24 action and for no other purpose whatsoever and shall not be disclosed, \n25\ndisseminated, or transmitted to any person, entity, or organization except in \n26\naccordance with the terms hereof.   \n27\n28\n  5 \n\n \n1\na.  Nothing in this Stipulated Protective Order shall preclude the \n2\ndisclosure of any “Confidential Information” with respect to a detainee who \n3\naffirmatively consents to the disclosure of that information.   \n4\n5\nb.  The limitations and restrictions on the disclosure of \n6\n“Confidential Information” under this Stipulated Protective Order shall not apply \n7\nto “Confidential Information” (1) that the Court has ordered Respondents to \n8\n9\nproduce, and (2) that comes from the requested A-File materials of an individual \n10\nwho presently is or will be a class member.  This exception does not apply to post-\n11\norder custody review worksheets that may be contained in an A-File.  Because the \n12\n13\nexception in this paragraph permits a class member to disclose the “Confidential \n14\nInformation” described in this paragraph without restriction or limitation, \n15\n16 including through class counsel with a class member’s authorization or consent, \n17\nthe exception described in this paragraph shall remain in effect only so long as \n18\ncounsel for Petitioners remain as counsel for the certified class in this action. \n19\n20 c.  The limitations and restrictions on “Confidential Information” \n21\nin this Stipulated Protective Order shall not apply with respect to information \n22\nobtained through a third-party source other than through discovery production.   \n23\n24 d.  This Stipulated Protective Order shall not preclude any party \n25\nfrom disclosing publicly-available information.   \n26\n  \n27\n28    \n  6 \n\n \n1\n  12.  The parties shall maintain “Confidential Information” as follows: \n2\n   a.  If the parties mutually agree that some “Confidential \n3\nInformation” relates to individuals who were never class members, Counsel for \n4\n5\nPetitioner shall destroy information related to those people within ten (10) days of \n6\ntheir mutual decision, and Counsel for Petitioner shall certify in writing to \n7\nCounsel for Respondents that such information has been destroyed.  If the parties \n8\n9\ndo not agree, and if the Court determines that “Confidential Information” relates \n10\nto individuals who were never class members, then within ten (10) days of the \n11\nCourt’s having made that determination, counsel for Petitioners shall destroy the \n12\n13\n“Confidential Information” related to non-class members, and certify in writing to \n14\nCounsel for Respondents that such information has been destroyed.   \n15\n16     b.  Petitioners and anyone to whom “Confidential Information” \n17\nhas been disclosed in accordance with paragraphs 6(a) through 6(c) shall maintain \n18\nall remaining “Confidential Information” pursuant to the terms of this Stipulated \n19\n20 Protective Order, subject to further order by this Court (this provision does not \n21\napply to Confidential Information disclosed to and maintained by the Court and its \n22\npersonnel, including court reporters).  Within ten (10) days after the final \n23\n24 disposition of this action, including any and all appeals, all discovery and copies \n25\nthereof in the possession of Petitioners and anyone to whom “Confidential \n26\nInformation” has been disclosed in accordance with paragraphs 6(a) – (c) shall be \n27\n28\n  7 \n\n \n1\nreturned to the producing parties or destroyed, at the option of the disclosing \n2\nparty, except as this Court may otherwise order.   \n3\n    c.  Notwithstanding subparagraph 12(b), counsel of record may \n4\n5\nmaintain a complete set of discovery for their records, provided that such counsel \n6\nmaintain the confidential nature of the discovery.   \n7\n  13.  Counsel for either party shall notify the other of any inadvertent \n8\n9\ndisclosure of information concerning any individual who is not a class member \n10\nand shall destroy information related to such individuals consistent with the terms \n11\nof paragraph 12(a).   \n12\n13\n  14.  Nothing in this Stipulated Protective Order shall be construed as a \n14\nwaiver of any defense, right or claim by either party, nor shall this Stipulated \n15\n16 Protective Order affect the right of Respondents to seek additional protection \n17\nagainst the disclosure of any documents or materials, or of Petitioner to seek \n18\nadditional disclosures. \n19\n20   15.  Any party may apply to this Court at any time, upon proper notice, \n21\nfor a modification of this Stipulated Protective Order with respect to the handling \n22\nor designation of any document or for any other purpose. \n23\n24   16.  Nothing in this Stipulated Protective Order shall be taken to authorize \n25\nthe disclosure of information otherwise barred from disclosure pursuant to Local \n26\nRule 79-5.4. \n27\n28\n  8 \n\n \n1\n  17.  This Stipulated Protective Order shall be binding upon any present or \n2\nfuture party to the Rodriguez, et al. v. Robbins, et al., No. 07-cv-3239-TJH \n3\n(RNBx) (C.D. Cal.), litigation. \n4\n5\n  18.  This Stipulated Protective Order shall be effective and enforceable \n6\nupon entry by the Court, except that the Parties may agree to abide by its terms \n7\nprior to entry of any order.   \n8\n9\n  19.  The terms of this Stipulated Protective Order shall survive the \n10\ntermination of this action proceeding after its final disposition for purposes of \n11\nenforcing this Stipulated Protective Order.  \n12\n13\n \n14\nDated: ___J_u_l_y_ _6_, 2011   ________________________________________               \n15\n      ROBERT  N.

Gould, Circuit Judges, and Sam E. \nHaddon,* District Judge. \n \n  In Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830 (2018), the Supreme Court held \nthat we misapplied the canon of constitutional avoidance to hold that certain \nimmigration detention statutes, namely 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b), 1226(a), and 1226(c), \nimplicitly contain a reasonableness determination after which due process concerns \nrequire that persons in prolonged mandatory detention are entitled to \nindividualized bond hearings and possibly, conditional release.  Although the \nCourt sought and received briefing on the straightforward constitutional question, \ni.e. without the implicit requirement of due process for persons in arbitrary \nprolonged detention, whether these detention statutes are constitutional, it declined \n                                           \n    *    The Honorable Sam E. Haddon, United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Montana, sitting by designation. \n   2     \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 495   Filed 11/19/18   Page 3 of 8   Page ID #:9861\nto reach the constitutional question.  The Court instead chose to answer only the \nquestion whether the statutory text itself included a limit on prolonged detention or \na requirement of individual bond hearings.  In an opinion authored by Justice Alito, \nthe Court concluded that as a matter of statutory construction, the only exceptions \nto indefinite detention were those expressly set forth in the statutes or related \nregulations.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A) (humanitarian parole); 8 U.S.C. § \n1226(a)(2)(A) (bond); 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c)(2) (witness protection); 8 C.F.R. §§ \n236.1(d)(1), 1236.1(d)(1) (bond hearing). \n  The Court then remanded the constitutional issues to our court, and we now, \ntaking our cue from it, likewise remand this case to the district court, which  \nhad no occasion to consider [petitioners’] constitutional arguments on \ntheir merits.  Consistent with our role as “a court of review, not of first \nview,” we do not reach those arguments.  Instead, we remand the case \nto the [district court] to consider them in the first instance. \n \nRodriguez, 138 S. Ct. at 851 (citation omitted). \n  The Court also decided to give us some homework on issues not raised by \nthe parties, asking us to reexamine whether the class should remain certified for \nconsideration of the constitutional issues and available class remedies and whether \na Rule 23(b)(2) class action remains the appropriate vehicle in light of Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338 (2011), and as a means for resolving \npetitioners’ due process clause claims.  The composition of the various subclasses \nmay also require reconsideration.  Because district courts have vastly more \n   3     \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 495   Filed 11/19/18   Page 4 of 8   Page ID #:9862\nexperience with class litigation than appellate courts, we also remand these \nquestions to the district court to be decided in the first instance. \n  For purposes of this analysis, the district court should determine “the \nminimum requirements of due process” for each subclass.  Morrissey v. Brewer, \n408 U.S. 471, 488–89 (1972) (requiring specific procedural protections in the \ncontext of parole revocations).  Although due process is a “flexible” concept, id. at \n481, certainly no process at all may be a common characteristic of each of the \nstatutes at issue.  “The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity \nto be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.”  Mathews v. \nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nThe district court should also reassess and reconsider both the clear and convincing \nevidence standard and the six-month bond hearing requirement. \nWe need not remand the question of jurisdiction over this habeas claim, as it \nis clear that we have jurisdiction over petitioners’ claims, as does the district court.  \nFirst, we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1), which states that “no court \n(other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or \nrestrain the operation of [§§ 1221–1232], other than with respect to the application \nof such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part \nhave been initiated.”  All of the individuals in the putative class are “individual[s] \nagainst whom proceedings under such part have been initiated” and are pursuing \n   4     \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 495   Filed 11/19/18   Page 5 of 8   Page ID #:9863\nhabeas claims, albeit as a class, which nowhere appear affected by § 1252(f)(1).  \nThe statute does not on its face bar class actions, and even if Reno v. American-\nArab Anti-Discrimination Committee forecloses the argument that § 1252(f)(1) \nallows classwide injunctive relief, it does not affect classwide declaratory relief.  \n525 U.S. 471, 481 (1999).  Section 1252(f)(1) also does not bar the habeas class \naction because it lacks a clear statement repealing the court’s habeas jurisdiction.1  \nI.N.S. v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 298 (2001) (relying on “the longstanding rule \nrequiring a clear statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction” \n(citation omitted)). \nSecond, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) does not preclude jurisdiction.  Section \n1252(b)(9) restricts “[j]udicial review of all questions of law and fact . . . arising \nfrom any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien,” except review of \nfinal orders of removal.  Here, Petitioners “are not asking for review of an order of \nremoval; they are not challenging the decision to detain them in the first place or to \n                                           \n1   The district court must decide in the first instance whether § 1252(f)(1) \nprecludes classwide injunctive relief, and if so, whether the availability of \ndeclaratory relief only can sustain the class.  Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. at 851.  The \ndistrict court must also consider whether a declaration that the detention statutes \nare unconstitutional because they contain no process for seeking bail is an \ninjunction or restraint on the operation of the detention statutes.  8 U.S.C. § \n1252(f)(1). \n   5     \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 495   Filed 11/19/18   Page 6 of 8   Page ID #:9864\nseek removal; and they are not even challenging any part of the process by which \ntheir removability will be determined.”  Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. at 841. \nFinally, 8 U.S.C. § 1226(e) does not preclude jurisdiction.  Section 1226(e) \nprohibits judicial review of the Attorney General’s “discretionary judgment,” \n“action,” or “decision” regarding the apprehension, detention, or release of a \nnoncitizen.  Here, “contesting the constitutionality of the entire statutory scheme \nunder the Fifth Amendment . . . is not a matter of discretionary judgment, action, \nor decision” and thus “falls outside of the scope of § 1226(e).”  Rodriguez, 138 S. \nCt. at 841 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n  Like the Supreme Court, we do not vacate the permanent injunction pending \nthe consideration of these vital constitutional issues.  We have grave doubts that \nany statute that allows for arbitrary prolonged detention without any process is \nconstitutional or that those who founded our democracy precisely to protect against \nthe government’s arbitrary deprivation of liberty would have thought so.  Arbitrary \ncivil detention is not a feature of our American government.  “[L]iberty is the \nnorm, and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited \nexception.”  United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 755 (1987).  Civil detention \nviolates due process outside of “certain special and narrow nonpunitive \n   6     \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 495   Filed 11/19/18   Page 7 of 8   Page ID #:9865\ncircumstances.”  Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).  As Justice Breyer wrote in Rodriguez,  \nThe Fifth Amendment says that “[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of \nlife, liberty, or property without due process of law.”  An alien is a \n“person.”    To  hold  him  without  bail  is  to  deprive  him  of  bodily \n“liberty.”  And, where there is no bail proceeding, there has been no \nbail-related “process” at all.  The Due Process Clause—itself reflecting \nthe language of the Magna Carta—prevents arbitrary detention. \n \n138 S. Ct. at 861 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (alteration in original) (citations omitted).2 \n  In conclusion, we therefore remand with instructions to the district court to \nconsider and determine: (1) whether the class certified by the district court should \nremain certified for consideration of the constitutional issue and available class \nremedies; (2) whether classwide injunctive relief is available under 8 U.S.C. § \n1252(f)(1); (3) whether a Rule 23(b)(2) class action (a) remains the appropriate \nvehicle in light of Walmart Stores, Inc. v. Duke, 564 U.S. 338 (2011), and (b) \nwhether such a class action is appropriate for resolving Petitioners’ due process \nclaims; (4) whether composition of the previously identified subclasses should be \nreconsidered; (5) the minimum requirements of due process to be accorded to all \nclaimants that will ensure a meaningful time and manner of opportunity to be \n                                           \n2   By referencing the issues spotted by the Rodriguez majority, we do not \nintend to restrict the district court from considering any other relevant issue, such \nas the scope of remedies available to the subclasses if the court should find a \nconstitutional violation. \n   7     \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 495   Filed 11/19/18   Page 8 of 8   Page ID #:9866\nheard; and (6) a reassessment and reconsideration of both the clear and convincing \nevidence standard and the six-month bond hearing requirement. \nREMANDED. \n \n \n   8     ",

See Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127 (9th Cir. 2013)\n8 [“Rodriguez II”].  Petitioners, then, moved for summary judgment and sought a\n9 permanent injunction, which this Court granted, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part\n10 and reversed in part.  See Rodriguez v. Robbins, 804 F.3d 1060 (9th Cir. 2015)\n11 [“Rodriguez III”].  The Ninth Circuit held that summary judgment and a permanent\n12 injunction were warranted as to three of Petitioner’s statutory claims and subclasses,\n13 but reversed as to Petitioners’ 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a) claim and subclass.  See Rodriguez\n14 III, 804 F.3d at 1090.  The Ninth Circuit reasoned that the class was certified only as\n15 to those individuals who were detained while waiting for a determination as to their\n16 potential removability, whereas § 1231(a) dealt with those whom the Government had\n17 already deemed removable and were merely waiting to be removed.  Rodriguez III, 804\n18 F.3d at 1085-1086.  The Government sought a writ of certiorari, which was granted. \n19 The Supreme Court reversed Rodriguez III and remanded this case to the Ninth\n20 Circuit to consider whether the class may continue based on Petitioners’ constitutional\n21 claims.  See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830 (2018).  Notably, the issue of\n22 whether Petitioners’ § 1231(a) claim and subclass were properly rejected by the Ninth\n23 Circuit was not appealed by Rodriguez and, therefore, never before the Supreme Court. \n24 The Ninth Circuit remanded the action to this Court for further proceedings, and left\n25 this  Court’s  permanent  injunction  in  place  “[ending  the  consideration  of  vital\n26 constitutional issues.”  \n27 On July 11, 2019, Petitioners filed a Fourth Amended Complaint [“FAC”]\n28 which, inter alia: (1) Added a new petitioner, Alex Cacho Castillo, who was detained\nAmended Order – Page 2 of 4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 547   Filed 03/09/20   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #:10484\n1 at the beginning of 2019, and released by May, 2019; (2) Reasserted a claim under §\n2 1231(a); and (3) Added an Eighth Amendment claim. \n3 Respondents, now, move to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (6). \n4 The party seeking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing that\n5 jurisdiction exists.  Scott v. Breeland, 792 F.2d 925, 927 (9th Cir. 1986).  A complaint\n6 will be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) if, inter alia, there is no case or\n7 controversy.  See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 198 (1962).  \n8 While a complaint need not include detailed factual allegations for each element\n9 of each claim, it must contain enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible\n10 on its face.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 570 (2007).  The Court\n11 must accept all allegations in a complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences\n12 from those allegations.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  A plaintiff\n13 cannot simply restate the elements of her claim, but, rather, must allege enough facts\n14 to allow the Court to draw a reasonable inference that a defendant is liable for the\n15 misconduct alleged.  See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  \n16 Respondents argued that because Cacho Castillo was detained for less than 6\n17 months,  he  cannot  serve  as  a  named  petitioner  or  be  a  member  of  this  class. \n18 Respondents are correct.  Given the class definition, Cacho Castillo was, indeed,\n19 misjoined.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(1).  Petitioners argued that because the Board of\n20 Immigration Appeals opinion that allowed for Cacho Castillo’s release may have been\n21 recently overturned, the Government may, at any time, cause him to be detained,\n22 again.  According to Petitioners, Cacho Castillo “likely would become” a class member\n23 in the near future.  The possibility of future injury is too speculative, here, to make\n24 Cacho Castillo’s claims ripe for adjudication.  See Wolfson v. Brammer, 616 F.3d\n25 1045, 1057 (9th Cir. 2010).   Because Cacho Castillo failed to allege a case or\n26 controversy ripe for adjudication, he must be dismissed.  See Baker, 369 U.S. at 198. \n27 Respondents, further, argued that Petitioners’ are barred from reasserting a\n28 claim, here, under § 1231(a) in light of Rodriguez III and the Supreme Court’s holding\nAmended Order – Page 3 of 4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 547   Filed 03/09/20   Page 4 of 4   Page ID #:10485",

ROBBINS 3\nSUMMARY***\nImmigration\nThe panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district\ncourt’s order granting summary judgment and a permanent\ninjunction in a class action lawsuit by non-citizens within\nthe  Central  District  of  California  challenging  their\nprolonged  detentions  under  civil  immigration  detention\nstatutes 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b), 1226(a), 1226(c), and 1231(a)\nwithout individualized bond hearings or determinations to\njustify continued detention.  \nThe  panel  affirmed  the  district  court’s  permanent\ninjunction insofar as it required automatic bond hearings and\nrequired  Immigration  Judges  to  consider  alternatives  to\ndetention.  The panel also held that IJs must consider the\nlength of detention and provide bond hearings every six\nmonths  for  class  members  detained  longer  than  twelve\nmonths,  but  rejected  the  class’s  request  for  additional\nprocedural requirements. \nThe  panel  held  that  subclass  members  subject  to\nprolonged  detention  under  mandatory  detention  statutes\n§§ 1225(b) and 1226(c) are entitled to bond hearings, and that\nsubclass members subject to discretionary detention under\n§ 1226(a) are entitled to automatic bond hearings after six\nmonths of detention.  In an issue this court had not previously\naddressed, the panel held that the government must provide\nperiodic bond hearings every six months for non-citizens to\n   *** This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

The panel, however,\nconcluded  that  no  certified  class-member  is  within  the\n§ 1231(a) subclass, defined as non-citizens detained pending\ncompletion of removal proceedings, and the panel therefore\nreversed the summary judgment and permanent injunction as\nto individuals detained under § 1231(a).  \nThe panel remanded for the district court to enter a\nrevised injunction consistent with its instructions.\nCOUNSEL\nSarah Stevens Wilson (argued), Theodore William Atkinson,\nHans Harris Chen, Alisa Beth Klein, Robert I.

As we noted in our prior decision\nin this case, Rodriguez v. Robbins (Rodriguez II), 715 F.3d\n1127 (9th Cir. 2013), thousands of immigrants to the United\nStates  are  locked  up  at  any  given  time,  awaiting  the\nconclusion of administrative and judicial proceedings that\nwill determine whether they may remain in this country.  In\n2014, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”)\nremoved 315,943 individuals, many of whom were detained\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 6 of 57   Page ID #:9637\n6 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nduring the removal process.1  According to the most recently\navailable  statistics,  ICE  detains  more  than  429,000\nindividuals over the course of a year, with roughly 33,000\nindividuals in detention on any given day.2\nAlejandro Rodriguez, Abdirizak Aden Farah, Jose Farias\nCornejo, Yussuf Abdikadir, Abel Perez Ruelas, and Efren\nOrozco (“petitioners”) represent a certified class of non-\ncitizens who challenge their prolonged detention pursuant to\n8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b), 1226(a), 1226(c), and 1231(a) without\nindividualized bond hearings and determinations to justify\ntheir continued detention.  Their case is now on appeal for the\nthird time.  After a three-judge panel of our court reversed the\ndistrict  court’s  denial  of  petitioners’  motion  for  class\ncertification, and after our decision affirming the district\ncourt’s entry of a preliminary injunction, the district court\ngranted  summary  judgment  to  the  class  and  entered  a\npermanent injunction.  Under the permanent injunction, the\ngovernment must provide any class member who is subject to\n“prolonged detention”—six months or more—with a bond\nhearing before an Immigration Judge (“IJ”).  At that hearing,\nthe government must prove by clear and convincing evidence\nthat the detainee is a flight risk or a danger to the community\nto justify the denial of bond.  The government appeals from\nthat judgment.  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n   1 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Enforcement and\nRemoval  Operations  Report  7  (2014),  https://www.ice.gov/doclib/\nabout/offices/ero/pdf/2014-ice-immigration-removals.pdf.\n   2 U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, ERO Facts and\nStatistics 3 (2011), http://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ero-facts-and-\nstatistics.pdf.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 7 of 57   Page ID #:9638\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 7\nI.  Background\nOn May 16, 2007, Alejandro Garcia commenced this case\nby filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Central\nDistrict of California.  Garcia’s case was consolidated with a\nsimilar case filed by Alejandro Rodriguez, and the petitioners\nmoved for class certification.  The motion was denied on\nMarch 21, 2008.\nA three-judge panel of our court reversed the district\ncourt’s  order  denying  class  certification.3    Rodriguez  I,\n591 F.3d 1105.  We held that the proposed class satisfied\neach requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23:  The\ngovernment  conceded  that  the  class  was  sufficiently\nnumerous; each class member’s claim turned on the common\nquestion of whether detention for more than six months\nwithout a bond hearing raises serious constitutional concerns;\nRodriguez’s claims were sufficiently typical of the class’s\nbecause “the determination of whether [he] is entitled to a\nbond hearing will rest largely on interpretation of the statute\nauthorizing  his  detention”;  and  Rodriguez,  through  his\ncounsel, adequately represented the class.  Id. at 1122–25. \nThe panel also noted that “any concern that the differing\nstatutes authorizing detention of the various class members\nwill  render  class  adjudication  of  class  members’  claims\nimpractical  or  undermine  effective  representation  of  the\nclass”  could  be  addressed  through  “the  formation  of\nsubclasses.”  Id. at 1123.\n   3 Judge Betty Binns Fletcher was on the panel as originally constituted\nand authored the opinion in Rodriguez v. Hayes (Rodriguez I), 578 F.3d\n1032 (9th Cir. 2009), amended by 591 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2010).  Judge\nWardlaw was selected by random draw to replace Judge B. Fletcher on the\npanel following her death in 2012.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 8 of 57   Page ID #:9639\n8 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nThe government petitioned our court for panel rehearing\nor rehearing en banc.  In response, the panel amended the\nopinion  to  expand  its  explanation  of  why  the  Illegal\nImmigration  Reform  and  Immigrant  Responsibility  Act\n(“IIRIRA”) does not bar certification of the class and, with\nthat  amendment,  unanimously  voted  to  deny  the\ngovernment’s petition.  The full court was advised of the\nsuggestion for rehearing en banc, and no judge requested a\nvote on whether to rehear the matter.  See Fed. R. App. P. 35. \nThe government did not file a petition for certiorari in the\nUnited States Supreme Court.\nOn remand, the district court certified a class defined as:\nall non-citizens within the Central District of\nCalifornia who: (1) are or were detained for\nlonger than six months pursuant to one of the\ngeneral  immigration  detention  statutes\npending completion of removal proceedings,\nincluding judicial review, (2) are not and have\nnot  been  detained  pursuant  to  a  national\nsecurity detention statute, and (3) have not\nbeen afforded a hearing to determine whether\ntheir detention is justified.\nThe district court also approved the proposed subclasses,\nwhich correspond to the four statutes under which the class\nmembers  are  detained—8  U.S.C.  §§  1225(b),  1226(a),\n1226(c), and 1231(a).  The class does not include suspected\nterrorists, who are detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1537. \nAdditionally, because the class is defined as non-citizens who\nare detained “pending completion of removal proceedings,”\nit excludes any detainee subject to a final order of removal.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 9 of 57   Page ID #:9640\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 9\nOn  September  13,  2012,  the  district  court  entered a\npreliminary injunction that applied to class members detained\npursuant to two of these four “general immigration detention\nstatutes”—§§ 1225(b) and 1226(c).  Under the preliminary\ninjunction, the government was required to “provide each\n[detainee] with a bond hearing” before an IJ and to “release\neach  Subclass  member  on  reasonable  conditions  of\nsupervision . . . unless the government shows by clear and\nconvincing evidence that continued detention is justified\nbased on his or her danger to the community or risk of flight.”\nThe government appealed, and on April 16, 2013, we\naffirmed.  See Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d 1127.  We applied the\nCourt’s preliminary injunction standard set forth in Winter v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008),\nwhich requires the petitioner to “establish that he is likely to\nsucceed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable\nharm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of\nequities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the\npublic interest.”  Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d at 1133.\nEvaluating  petitioners’  likelihood  of  success  on  the\nmerits, we began with the premise that “[f]reedom from\nimprisonment—from government custody, detention, or other\nforms of physical restraint—lies at the heart of the liberty that\n[the Due Process] Clause protects.”  Id. at 1134 (alterations\nin original) (quoting Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690\n(2001)).    “Thus,  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  the\nindefinite detention of a once-admitted alien ‘would raise\nserious constitutional concerns.’”  Id. (quoting Zadvydas,\n533 U.S. at 682).\nAddressing those concerns, we recognized that we were\nnot writing on a clean slate:  “[I]n a series of decisions since\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 10 of 57   Page ID\n #:9641\n10 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\n2001, ‘the Supreme Court and this court have grappled in\npiece-meal fashion with whether the various immigration\ndetention  statutes  may  authorize  indefinite  or  prolonged\ndetention of detainees and, if so, may do so without providing\na bond hearing.’”  Id. (quoting Rodriguez I, 591 F.3d at\n1114).  First, in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), the\nSupreme Court resolved statutory and due process challenges\nto indefinite detention under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6), which\ngoverns detention beyond the ninety-day removal period,\nwhere  removal  was  not  practicable—for  one  petitioner\nbecause he was stateless, and for another because his home\ncountry had no repatriation treaty with the United States.  See\nid. at 684–86.  Drawing on civil commitment jurisprudence,\nthe Court reasoned:\nA statute permitting indefinite detention of an\nalien  would  raise  a  serious  constitutional\nproblem.    The  Fifth  Amendment’s  Due\nProcess Clause forbids the Government to\n“depriv[e]” any “person . . . of . . . liberty . . .\nwithout due process of law.”  Freedom from\nimprisonment—from  government  custody,\ndetention,  or  other  forms  of  physical\nrestraint—lies at the heart of the liberty that\nClause protects.  See Foucha v. Louisiana,\n504 U.S. 71, 80, 112 S.Ct. 1780, 118 L.Ed.2d\n437 (1992).  And this Court has said that\ngovernment  detention  violates  that  Clause\nunless the detention is ordered in a criminal\nproceeding  with  adequate  procedural\nprotections,  see  United  States  v.  Salerno,\n481  U.S.  739,  746,  107  S.Ct.  2095,  95\nL.Ed.2d 697 (1987), or, in certain special and\n“narrow”  nonpunitive  “circumstances,”\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 11 of 57   Page ID\n #:9642\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 11\nFoucha, supra, at 80, 112 S.Ct. 1780, where\na  special  justification,  such  as  harm-\nthreatening  mental  illness,  outweighs  the\n“individual’s  constitutionally  protected\ninterest  in  avoiding  physical  restraint.” \nKansas  v.  Hendricks,  521  U.S.  346,  356,\n117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997).\nId. at 690 (alterations in original).  To avoid those “serious\nconstitutional concerns,” the Court held that § 1231(a)(6)\ndoes  not  authorize  indefinite  detention  without  a  bond\nhearing.  Id. at 682, 699.  Noting that the “proceedings at\nissue here are civil, not criminal,” id. at 690, the Court\n“construe[d] the statute to contain an implicit ‘reasonable\ntime’ limitation,” id. at 682, and recognized six months as a\n“presumptively reasonable period of detention,” id. at 701.\nAlthough in dissent, Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief\nJustice Rehnquist, disagreed with the majority’s application\nof the canon of constitutional avoidance and argued that the\nholding  would  improperly  interfere  with  international\nrepatriation negotiations, Justice Kennedy recognized that\n“both removable and inadmissible aliens are entitled to be\nfree from detention that is arbitrary or capricious.”  Id. at 721. \nJustice Kennedy further noted that although the government\nmay detain non-citizens “when necessary to avoid the risk of\nflight or danger to the community,” due process requires\n“adequate procedures to review their cases, allowing persons\nonce subject to detention to show that through rehabilitation,\nnew appreciation of their responsibilities, or under other\nstandards, they no longer present special risks or danger if put\nat large.”  Id.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 12 of 57   Page ID\n #:9643\n12 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nSecond, in Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510 (2003), the\nCourt  addressed  a  due  process  challenge  to  mandatory\ndetention under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c), which applies to non-\ncitizens convicted of certain crimes.  Id. at 517–18.  After\ndiscussing Congress’s reasons for establishing mandatory\ndetention,  namely,  high  rates  of  crime  and  flight  by\nremovable non-citizens, id. at 518–21, the Court affirmed its\n“longstanding view that the Government may constitutionally\ndetain deportable aliens during the limited period necessary\nfor their removal proceedings,” id. at 526.  Distinguishing\nZadvydas, the Court in Demore stressed that detention under\n§ 1226(c) has “a definite termination point” and typically\n“lasts for less than the 90 days we considered presumptively\nvalid in Zadvydas.”  Id. at 529.  Although the Court therefore\nupheld  mandatory  detention  under  §  1226(c),  Justice\nKennedy’s concurring opinion, which created the majority,\nreasoned that “a lawful permanent resident alien such as\nrespondent  could  be  entitled  to  an  individualized\ndetermination as to his risk of flight and dangerousness if the\ncontinued detention became unreasonable or unjustified.”  Id.\nat 532.\nAfter Zadvydas and Demore, our court decided several\ncases  that  provided  further  guidance  for  our  analysis  in\nRodriguez II.  In Tijani v. Willis, 430 F.3d 1241 (9th Cir.\n2005), we held that the constitutionality of detaining a lawful\npermanent resident under § 1226(c) for over 32 months was\n“doubtful.”    Id.  at  1242.    “To  avoid  deciding  the\nconstitutional issue, we interpret[ed] the authority conferred\nby § 1226(c) as applying to expedited removal of criminal\naliens” and held that “[t]wo years and eight months of process\nis not expeditious.”  Id.  We therefore remanded Tijani’s\nhabeas petition to the district court with directions to grant\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 13 of 57   Page ID\n #:9644\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 13\nthe writ unless the government provided a bond hearing\nbefore an IJ within sixty days.  Id.\nWe next considered civil detention in the immigration\ncontext  in Casas-Castrillon  v. Department of  Homeland\nSecurity (Casas), 535 F.3d 942 (9th Cir. 2008).  There, a\nlawful permanent resident who had been detained for nearly\nseven years under § 1226(c) and then § 1226(a) sought\nhabeas relief while his petition for review of his removal\norder was pending before our court.  Id. at 944–48.  Applying\nDemore, we reasoned that § 1226(c) “authorize[s] mandatory\ndetention only for the ‘limited period of [the non-citizen’s]\nremoval  proceedings,’  which  the  Court  estimated  ‘lasts\nroughly a month and a half in the vast majority of cases in\nwhich it is invoked, and about five months in the minority of\ncases in which the alien chooses to appeal’ his removal order\nto the [Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”)].”  Id. at 950\n(quoting Demore, 538 U.S. at 529).  We therefore concluded\nthat § 1226(c)’s mandatory detention provision applies only\nduring administrative removal proceedings—i.e. until the\nBIA affirms a removal order.  Id. at 951.  From that point\nuntil the circuit court has “rejected [the applicant’s] final\npetition for review or his time to seek such review expires,”\nthe government has discretionary authority to detain the non-\ncitizen pursuant to § 1226(a).  Id. at 948.  We noted, however,\nthat  “[t]here  is  a  difference  between  detention  being\nauthorized and being necessary as to any particular person.” \nId. at 949.  Because the Court’s holding in Demore turned on\nthe brevity of mandatory detention under § 1226(c), we\nconcluded  that  “the  government  may  not  detain  a  legal\npermanent resident such as Casas for a prolonged period\nwithout providing him a neutral forum in which to contest the\nnecessity of his continued detention.”  Id. at 949.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 14 of 57   Page ID\n #:9645\n14 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nSoon after, in Singh v. Holder, 638 F.3d 1196 (9th Cir.\n2011), we clarified the procedural requirements for bond\nhearings held pursuant to our decision in Casas (“Casas\nhearings”).  In light of “the substantial liberty interest at\nstake,” we held that “due process requires a contemporaneous\nrecord of Casas hearings,” and that the government bears the\nburden of proving “by clear and convincing evidence that an\nalien is a flight risk or a danger to the community to justify\ndenial of bond.”  Id. at 1203, 1208.  To evaluate whether the\ngovernment has met its burden, we instructed IJs to consider\nthe factors set forth in In re Guerra, 24 I. & N. Dec. 37 (BIA\n2006), in particular “the alien’s criminal record, including the\nextensiveness  of  criminal  activity,  the  recency  of  such\nactivity, and the seriousness of the offenses.”  Singh, 638 F.3d\nat 1206 (quoting Guerra, 24 I. & N. Dec. at 40).\nFinally, in Diouf v. Napolitano (Diouf II), 634 F.3d 1081\n(9th  Cir.  2011),  we  extended  the  procedural  protections\nestablished  in  Casas  to  individuals  detained  under\n§ 1231(a)(6).  Id. at 1086.  We held that “prolonged detention\nunder § 1231(a)(6), without adequate procedural protections,”\nlike  prolonged  detention  under  §  1226(a),  “would  raise\n‘serious  constitutional  concerns.’”    Id.  (quoting  Casas,\n535 F.3d at 950).  To address those concerns, we held that\n“an alien facing prolonged detention under § 1231(a)(6) is\nentitled to a bond hearing before an immigration judge and is\nentitled to be released from detention unless the government\nestablishes that the alien poses a risk of flight or a danger to\nthe community.”  Id. at 1092.\nIn Diouf II, we also adopted a definition of “prolonged”\ndetention—detention  that  “has  lasted  six  months  and  is\nexpected  to  continue  more  than  minimally  beyond  six\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 15 of 57   Page ID\n #:9646\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 15\nmonths”—for purposes of administering the Casas bond\nhearing requirement.  Id. at 1092 n.13.  We reasoned that:\nWhen  detention  crosses  the  six-month\nthreshold  and  release  or  removal  is  not\nimminent, the private interests at stake are\nprofound.    Furthermore,  the  risk  of  an\nerroneous deprivation of liberty in the absence\nof a hearing before a neutral decisionmaker is\nsubstantial.    The  burden  imposed  on  the\ngovernment by requiring hearings before an\nimmigration  judge  at  this  stage  of  the\nproceedings is therefore a reasonable one.\nId. at 1091–92.\nApplying these precedents to Rodriguez class members\ndetained under § 1226(c), which requires civil detention of\nnon-citizens previously convicted of certain crimes who have\nalready served their state or federal periods of incarceration,\nwe have concluded that “the prolonged detention of an alien\nwithout an individualized determination of his dangerousness\nor flight risk would be constitutionally doubtful.”  Rodriguez\nII, 715 F.3d at 1137 (quoting Casas, 535 F.3d at 951).  To\navoid these constitutional concerns, we held that “§ 1226(c)’s\nmandatory language must be construed ‘to contain an implicit\nreasonable time limitation, the application of which is subject\nto federal-court review.’”  Id. at 1138 (quoting Zadvydas,\n533 U.S. at 682).  “[W]hen detention becomes prolonged,”\ni.e.,  at  the  six-month  mark,  “§  1226(c)  becomes\ninapplicable”; the government’s authority to detain the non-\ncitizen shifts to § 1226(a), which provides for discretionary\ndetention; and detainees are then entitled to bond hearings. \nId.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 16 of 57   Page ID\n #:9647\n16 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nIn so holding, we rejected the government’s attempt to\ndistinguish Casas on the basis that “Casas concerned an alien\nwho had received an administratively final removal order,\nsought judicial review, and obtained a remand to the BIA,”\nwhereas this case involves “aliens awaiting the conclusion of\ntheir initial administrative proceedings.”  Id. at 1139.  We\nfound that this argument reflected “a distinction without a\ndifference”:  “‘Regardless of the stage of the proceedings, the\nsame important interest is at stake—freedom from prolonged\ndetention.’”  Id. (quoting Diouf II, 634 F.3d at 1087).\nWe also noted that our conclusion was consistent with the\ndecisions  of  the  two  other  circuits  that  have  directly\naddressed this issue.  In Diop v. ICE/Homeland Security,\n656 F.3d 221 (3d Cir. 2011), the Third Circuit, applying the\ncanon  of  constitutional  avoidance,  construed  §  1226(c)\nto“authorize[] detention for a reasonable amount of time,\nafter which the authorities must  make  an individualized\ninquiry into whether detention is still necessary to fulfill the\nstatute’s purposes of ensuring that an alien attends removal\nproceedings and that his release will not pose a danger to the\ncommunity.”  Id. at 231.  Applying that holding to the facts\nof  the  case,  the  Third  Circuit  held  that  the  petitioner’s\ndetention,  which  had  lasted  nearly  three  years,  “was\nunconstitutionally unreasonable and, therefore, a violation of\nthe Due Process Clause.”  Id. at 233.  Although the court\ndeclined to adopt a categorical definition of a “reasonable\namount of time” to detain a non-citizen without a bond\nhearing,  it  read  Demore  as  we  do—to  connect  the\nconstitutionality of detention to its length and to authorize\ndetention only for a “limited time.”  Id. at 233–34.\nLikewise, in Ly v. Hansen, 351 F.3d 263 (6th Cir. 2003),\nthe Sixth Circuit held that, to avoid a constitutional problem,\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 17 of 57   Page ID\n #:9648\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 17\nremovable non-citizens may be detained under § 1226(c) only\n“for a reasonable period of time required to initiate and\nconclude  removal  proceedings  promptly.”    Id.  at  273. \nFinding that the petitioner’s 500-day-long detention was\n“unreasonable,” the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s\ngrant of a writ of habeas corpus.  Id. at 265, 271.  While\nmaintaining that a “bright-line time limitation, as imposed in\nZadvydas, would not be appropriate for the pre-removal\nperiod,” the court recognized that Demore’s holding “rel[ies]\non the fact that Kim, and persons like him, will normally have\ntheir proceedings completed within a short period of time and\nwill actually be deported, or will be released.”  Id. at 271.\nAs to the Rodriguez subclass detained under § 1225(b),\nwe found “no basis for distinguishing between” non-citizens\ndetained under that section and under § 1226(c).  Rodriguez\nII,  715  F.3d  at  1143.    The  cases  relied  upon  by  the\ngovernment  for  the  proposition  that  arriving  aliens  are\nentitled  to  lesser  due  process  protections—namely,\nShaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206\n(1953) and Barrera–Echavarria v. Rison, 44 F.3d 1441 (9th\nCir. 1995) (en banc)—were decided under pre-IIRIRA law\nand, as such, were inapposite.  Id. at 1140–41.  We therefore\nheld  that  “to  the  extent  detention  under  §  1225(b)  is\nmandatory, it is implicitly time-limited.”  Id. at 1144.  As we\nhad with § 1226(c), we explained that “the government’s\ndetention  authority  does  not  completely  dissipate  at  six\nmonths; rather, the mandatory provisions of § 1225(b) simply\nexpire  at  six  months,  at  which  point  the  government’s\nauthority to detain the non-citizen would shift to § 1226(a),\nwhich  is  discretionary  and  which  we  have  already  held\nrequires a bond hearing.”  Id. (citing Casas, 535 F.3d at 948).\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 18 of 57   Page ID\n #:9649\n18 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nAfter establishing that class members detained under\n§ 1226(c) and § 1225(b) are entitled to bond hearings after six\nmonths  of  detention,  we  clarified  that  the  procedural\nrequirements set forth in Singh apply to those hearings.  Id. at\n1139,  1144  (citing  Singh,  638  F.3d  at  1203).    These\nrequirements include proceedings before “a neutral IJ” at\nwhich “the government bear[s] the burden of proof by clear\nand convincing evidence,” id. at 1144 (citing Singh, 638 F.3d\nat 1203–04), a lower burden of proof than that required to\nsustain a criminal charge.\nHaving found that the class was likely to succeed on the\nmerits, we turned to the other preliminary injunction factors. \nWe found that the class members “clearly face irreparable\nharm in the absence of the preliminary injunction” because\n“the  deprivation  of  constitutional  rights  unquestionably\nconstitutes irreparable injury.”  Id. (citations omitted).  The\npreliminary injunction safeguards constitutional rights by\nensuring that “individuals whom the government cannot\nprove constitute a flight risk or a danger to public safety, and\nsometimes  will  not  succeed in  removing  at  all,  are not\nneedlessly detained.”  Id. at 1145.  Similarly, we found that\nthe balance of equities favored the class members because\n“needless prolonged detention” imposes “major hardship,”\nwhereas  the  government  “cannot  suffer  harm  from  an\ninjunction that merely ends an unlawful practice or reads a\nstatute as required to avoid constitutional concerns.”  Id. \nFinally,  we  held  that  the  preliminary  injunction  was\nconsistent with the public interest, which is “implicated when\na constitutional right has been violated,” and “benefits from\na preliminary injunction that ensures that federal statutes are\nconstrued and implemented in a manner that avoids serious\nconstitutional questions.”  Id. at 1146.  We therefore affirmed\nthe district court’s order.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 19 of 57   Page ID\n #:9650\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 19\nDuring  the  pendency  of  Rodriguez  II,  the  parties\nconducted discovery, and class counsel adduced extensive\nevidence  detailing  the  circumstances  under  which  class\nmembers are detained.  The parties then filed cross-motions\nfor summary judgment, and the petitioners moved for a\npermanent injunction to extend and expand the preliminary\ninjunction.\nOn August 6, 2013, after we issued our decision in\nRodriguez II, the district court granted summary judgment to\nthe class members and entered a permanent injunction.  The\npermanent  injunction  applies  to  class  members  detained\nunder any of the four civil “general immigration detention\nstatutes”—§§ 1225(b), 1226(a), 1226(c), and 1231(a)—and\nrequires the government to provide each detainee with a bond\nhearing  by  his  195th  day  of  detention.    Applying  our\ndecisions in Casas, Singh, and Rodriguez II, the district court\nfurther ordered that bond hearings occur automatically, that\ndetainees  receive  “comprehendible  notice,”  that  the\ngovernment  bear  the  burden  of  proving  “by  clear  and\nconvincing evidence that a detainee is a flight risk or a danger\nto the community to justify the denial of bond,” and that\nhearings are recorded.  However, the district court declined\nto  order  IJs  to  consider  the  length  of  detention  or  the\nlikelihood of removal during bond hearings, or to provide\nperiodic hearings for detainees who are not released after\ntheir first hearing.\nThe  government  now  appeals  from  the  entry  of  the\npermanent injunction, arguing that the district court—and\nwe—erred in applying the canon of constitutional avoidance\nto each of the statutes at issue.  Relying on the Supreme\nCourt’s decisions in Zadvydas and Demore, the government\nargues that none of the subclasses are categorically entitled to\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 20 of 57   Page ID\n #:9651\n20 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nbond hearings after six months of detention.  Accordingly, the\ngovernment contends that we should decertify the class and\ninstead permit as-applied challenges to individual instances\nof prolonged detention, which could occur only through\nhabeas proceedings.  Petitioners counter that Rodriguez II is\nthe law of the case and law of the circuit, requiring us to\naffirm the permanent injunction as to the § 1225(b) and\n§ 1226(c) subclasses, and that non-citizens detained pursuant\nto § 1226(a) and § 1231(a) are entitled to bond hearings for\nreasons similar to those discussed in Rodriguez II.  Petitioners\ncross-appeal the district court’s order as to the procedural\nrequirements for bond hearings; they argue that the district\ncourt  erred in  declining  to  require  that  IJs  consider  the\nlikelihood of removal and the total length of detention, and in\ndeclining to require that non-citizens detained for twelve or\nmore  months  receive  periodic  bond  hearings  every  six\nmonths.\nII.  Nature of Civil Immigration Detention\nClass  members  spend,  on  average,  404  days  in\nimmigration detention.  Nearly half are detained for more\nthan one year, one in five for more than eighteen months, and\none in ten for more than two years.  In some cases, detention\nhas lasted much longer:  As of April 28, 2012, when the\ngovernment generated data to produce to the petitioners, one\nclass member had been detained for 1,585 days, approaching\nfour and a half years of civil confinement.4\n   4 The government challenges the accuracy of these figures, which are\ndrawn from petitioners’ expert report, based on disagreements with that\nexpert’s methodology.  Using the government’s preferred data set and\nprocess generates an average detention length of 347 days and a range of\n180 to 1,037 days of civil detention for each non-citizen.  Under either set\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 21 of 57   Page ID\n #:9652\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 21\nNon-citizens who vigorously pursue claims for relief from\nremoval face substantially longer detention periods than those\nwho concede removability.  Requesting relief from an IJ\nincreases the duration of class members’ detention by an\naverage of two months; appealing a claim to the BIA adds, on\naverage, another four months; and appealing a BIA decision\nto the Ninth Circuit typically leads to an additional eleven\nmonths  of  confinement.    Class  members  who  persevere\nthrough this lengthy process are often successful:  About 71%\nof class members have sought relief from removal, and\nroughly one-third of those individuals prevailed.  However,\nmany detainees choose to give up meritorious claims and\nvoluntarily leave the country instead of enduring years of\nimmigration detention awaiting a judicial finding of their\nlawful status.\nClass members frequently have strong ties to this country: \nMany immigrated to the United States as children, obtained\nlegal permanent resident status, and lived in this country for\nas  long  as  twenty  years  before  ICE  initiated  removal\nproceedings.  As a result, hundreds of class members are\nmarried to U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, and\nhave children who were born in this country.  Further, many\nclass members hold steady jobs—including as electricians,\nauto mechanics, and roofers—to provide for themselves and\ntheir  families.    At  home,  they  are caregivers  for  young\nchildren, aging parents, and sick or disabled relatives.  To the\nextent class members have any criminal record—and many\nhave no criminal history whatsoever—it is often limited to\nminor controlled substances offenses.  Accordingly, when\nclass members do receive bond hearings, they often produce\nof figures, typical class members are detained for well over 180 days.  The\ndifferences in precise numbers are not material to our decision.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 22 of 57   Page ID\n #:9653\n22 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nglowing letters of support from relatives, friends, employers,\nand clergy attesting to their character and contributions to\ntheir communities.\nProlonged detention imposes severe hardship on class\nmembers and their families.  Civil immigration detainees are\ntreated much like criminals serving time:  They are typically\nhoused in shared jail cells with no privacy and limited access\nto larger spaces or the outdoors.  Confinement makes it more\ndifficult  to  retain  or  meet  with  legal  counsel,  and  the\nresources in detention facility law libraries are minimal at\nbest, thereby compounding the challenges of navigating the\ncomplexities  of  immigration  law  and  proceedings.    In\naddition,  visitation  is  restricted  and  is  often  no-contact,\ndramatically  disrupting  family  relationships.    While  in\ndetention, class members have missed their children’s births\nand their parents’ funerals.  After losing a vital source of\nincome, class members’ spouses have sought government\nassistance, and their children have dropped out of college. \nLead  petitioner  Alejandro  Rodriguez’s  story  is\nillustrative.  Rodriguez came to the United States as an infant\nand has lived here continuously since then.  Rodriguez is a\nlawful permanent resident of the United States, and his entire\nimmediate family—including his parents, siblings, and three\nyoung children—also resides in the United States as citizens\nor  lawful  permanent  residents.    Before  his  removal\nproceedings began, Rodriguez worked as a dental assistant. \nIn 2003, however, Rodriguez was convicted of possession of\na  controlled  substance  and  sentenced  to  five  years  of\nprobation and no jail time.  He had one previous conviction,\nfor “joyriding.”\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 23 of 57   Page ID\n #:9654\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 23\nIn  2004,  ICE  commenced  removal  proceedings  and\nsubjected Rodriguez to civil detention.  An IJ determined that\nRodriguez’s prior conviction for “joyriding,” i.e. driving a\nstolen  vehicle,  qualified  as  an  “aggravated  felony”  that\nrendered him ineligible for relief in the form of cancellation\nof removal, and therefore ordered him removed.  Rodriguez\nappealed the IJ’s decision to the BIA, which affirmed, and\nthen to the Ninth Circuit.  In July 2005, a three-judge panel of\nour  court  granted  the  government’s  motion  to  hold\nRodriguez’s  case  in  abeyance  until  the  Supreme  Court\ndecided a related case, Gonzales v. Penuliar, 549 U.S. 1178\n(2007), which issued eighteen months later, in January 2007. \nIn Penuliar, the Supreme Court vacated our court’s opinion\nand remanded for further consideration in light of Gonzales\nv. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183 (2007), which held that\nviolating a California statute prohibiting taking a vehicle\nwithout the owner’s consent qualifies as a “theft offense.” \nBetween July 2005 and January 2007, while Rodriguez’s case\nwas in abeyance, ICE conducted four custody reviews on\nRodriguez and repeatedly determined that Rodriguez was\nrequired to remain in detention until our court issued a\ndecision on the merits of his claim.  In mid-2007, about a\nmonth after Rodriguez had moved for class certification,\nhowever, ICE released him.  At that point, Rodriguez had\nbeen detained for 1,189 days, roughly three years and three\nmonths.  In April 2008, in the related case on remand from\nthe Supreme Court, our court held that driving a stolen\nvehicle did not qualify as an aggravated felony.  Penuliar v.\nMukasey, 528 F.3d 603, 614 (9th Cir. 2008).  On motion of\nthe parties, we then remanded Rodriguez’s petition to the\nBIA,  which  granted  his  application  for  cancellation  of\nremoval,  vindicating  his  right  to  lawfully  remain  in  the\nUnited States.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 24 of 57   Page ID\n #:9655\n24 RODRIGUEZ V.

Chrysler Grp., LLC, 789 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.\n2015).  “A permanent injunction ‘involves factual, legal, and\ndiscretionary components,’ so we ‘review a decision to grant\nsuch relief under several different standards.’”  Vietnam\nVeterans of Am. v. C.I.A., 791 F.3d 1122, 1129 (9th Cir.\n2015) (quoting Momot v.

Discussion\nIn resolving whether the district court erred in entering\nthe  permanent injunction,  we  consider,  first,  petitioners’\nentitlement to bond hearings and, second, the procedural\nrequirements for such hearings.  Based on our precedents, we\nhold that the canon of constitutional avoidance requires us to\nconstrue the statutory scheme to provide all class members\nwho are in prolonged detention with bond hearings at which\nthe government bears the burden of proving by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the class member is a danger to the\ncommunity or a flight risk.  However, we also conclude that\nindividuals detained under § 1231(a) are not members of the\ncertified class.  We affirm the district court’s order insofar as\nit  requires  automatic  bond  hearings  and  requires  IJs  to\nconsider alternatives to detention because we presume, like\nthe  district  court,  that  IJs  are  already  doing  so  when\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 25 of 57   Page ID\n #:9656\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 25\ndetermining  whether  to  release  a  non-citizen  on  bond.5 \nBecause  the  same  constitutional  concerns  arise  when\ndetention approaches another prolonged period, we hold that\nIJs must provide bond hearings periodically at six month\nintervals for class members detained for more than twelve\nmonths.  However, we reject the class’s suggestion that we\nmandate additional procedural requirements.\nA. Civil Detention\n“In our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior to\ntrial  or  without  trial is  the carefully limited  exception.” \nUnited States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 755 (1987).  Civil\ndetention violates the Due Process Clause except “in certain\nspecial  and  narrow  nonpunitive  circumstances,  where  a\nspecial justification, such as harm-threatening mental illness,\noutweighs the individual’s constitutionally protected interest\nin avoiding physical restraint.”  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690\n(citations omitted).  Consistent with these principles, the\nSupreme  Court  has—outside  of  the  immigration\ncontext—found civil detention constitutional without any\nindividualized showing of need only when faced with the\nunique exigencies of global war or domestic insurrection.

ROBBINS\nUnited States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944); Moyer v. Peabody,\n212  U.S.  78  (1909).6    And  even  in  those  extreme\ncircumstances,  the  Court’s  decisions  have  been  widely\ncriticized.    See,  e.g.,  Eugene  V.  Rostow,  The  Japanese\nAmerican Cases—A Disaster, 54 Yale L.J. 489 (1945).  In all\ncontexts apart from immigration and military detention, the\nCourt  has  found  that  the  Constitution  requires  some\nindividualized process and a judicial or administrative finding\nthat a legitimate governmental interest justifies detention of\nthe person in question.\nFor example, in numerous cases addressing the civil\ndetention of mentally ill persons, the Court has consistently\nrecognized that such commitment “constitutes a significant\ndeprivation  of  liberty,”  and  so  the  state  “must  have  a\nconstitutionally  adequate  purpose  for  the  confinement.” \nJones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 361 (1983) (citations\nomitted).  Further, the “nature and duration of commitment”\nmust “bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which\nthe individual is committed.”  Jones, 463 U.S. at 368 (citation\nomitted).\nAccordingly, the state may detain a criminal defendant\nfound incapable of standing trial, but only for “the reasonable\nperiod of time necessary to determine whether there is a\nsubstantial probability that he will attain [the] capacity [to\nstand trial] in the foreseeable future.”  Jackson v. Indiana,\n   6 For a thorough discussion of civil detention jurisprudence and its\nbearing on the constitutionality of civil detention in the immigration\ncontext, see Farrin R. Anello, Due Process and Temporal Limits on\nMandatory Immigration Detention, 65 Hastings L.J. 363 (2014), and\nDavid Cole, In Aid of Removal: Due Process Limits on Immigration\nDetention, 51 Emory L.J. 1003 (2002).\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 27 of 57   Page ID\n #:9658\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 27\n406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972).  At all times, the individual’s\n“commitment must be justified by progress toward that goal.” \nId.  Likewise, the state may detain a criminal defendant\nfollowing an acquittal by reason of insanity in order to “treat\nthe individual’s mental illness and protect him and society\nfrom his potential dangerousness.”  Jones, 463 U.S. at 368. \nHowever, the detainee “is entitled to release when he has\nrecovered his sanity or is no longer dangerous.”  Id.; see also\nFoucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 78 (1992) (“[K]eeping\nFoucha against his will in a mental institution is improper\nabsent a determination in civil commitment proceedings of\ncurrent  mental  illness  and  dangerousness.”).    Further,\nalthough the state may detain sexually dangerous individuals\neven after they have completed their criminal sentences, such\nconfinement must “take[] place pursuant to proper procedures\nand evidentiary standards.”  Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S.\n346,  357  (1997).    To  “justify  indefinite  involuntary\ncommitment,” the state must prove both “dangerousness” and\n“some additional factor, such as a ‘mental illness’ or ‘mental\nabnormality.’” Id. at 358 (collecting cases).\nSimilarly, the Court has held that pretrial detention of\nindividuals charged with “the most serious of crimes” is\nconstitutional only because, under the Bail Reform Act, an\n“arrestee  is  entitled  to  a  prompt  detention  hearing”  to\ndetermine whether his confinement is necessary to prevent\ndanger to the community.  Salerno, 481 U.S. at 747.  Further,\n“the maximum length of pretrial detention is limited by the\nstringent time limitations of the Speedy Trial Act.”  Id.; see\nalso Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 263 (1984) (upholding a\nstatute that “permits a brief pretrial detention based on a\nfinding of a ‘serious risk’ that an arrested juvenile may\ncommit a crime before his return date”).\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 28 of 57   Page ID\n #:9659\n28 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nIn  addition,  the  Court  has  held  that  incarceration of\nindividuals held in civil contempt is consistent with due\nprocess  only  where  the  contemnor  receives  adequate\nprocedural protections and the court makes specific findings\nas to the individual’s ability to comply with the court order. \nSee Turner v. Rogers, 131 S. Ct. 2507, 2520 (2011).  If\ncompliance is impossible—for instance, if the individual\nlacks  the  financial  resources  to  pay  court-ordered  child\nsupport—then contempt sanctions do not serve their purpose\nof coercing compliance and therefore violate the Due Process\nClause.  See id.\nEarly cases upholding immigration detention policies\nwere  a  product  of  their  time.    See  Carlson  v.  Landon,\n342  U.S.  524  (1952)  (McCarthy  Era  deportation  of\ncommunists);  Ludecke  v.  Watkins,  335  U.S.  160  (1948)\n(removal of German enemy aliens during World War II);\nWong Wing v. United States, 163 U.S. 228 (1896) (Chinese\nexclusion).  Yet even these cases recognized some limits on\ndetention of non-citizens pending removal.  Such detention\nmay not be punitive—Congress may not, for example, impose\nsentences of “imprisonment at hard labor” on non-citizens\nawaiting deportation, Wong Wing, 163 U.S. at 235—and it\nmust be supported by a legitimate regulatory purpose.  Under\nthese  principles,  the  Court  authorized  the  “detention  or\ntemporary  confinement”  of  Chinese-born  non-citizens\n“pending the inquiry into their true character, and while\narrangements were being made for their deportation.”  Id. \nThe Court also upheld executive detention of enemy aliens\nafter the cessation of active hostilities because deportation is\n“hardly practicable” in the midst of war, and enemy aliens’\n“potency for mischief” continues “even when the guns are\nsilent.”  Ludecke, 335 U.S. at 166.  Similarly, the Court\napproved  detention  of  communists  to  limit  their\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 29 of 57   Page ID\n #:9660\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 29\n“opportunities to hurt the United States during the pendency\nof deportation proceedings.”  Carlson, 342 U.S. at 538.  The\nCourt recognized, however, that “purpose to injure could not\nbe imputed generally to all aliens subject to deportation.”  Id.\nat 538.  Rather, if the Attorney General wished to exercise his\ndiscretion to deny bail, he was required to do so at a hearing,\nthe results of which were subject to judicial review.  Id. at\n543.\nMore recently, the Supreme Court has drawn on decades\nof  civil  detention  jurisprudence to  hold  that  “[a]  statute\npermitting indefinite detention of an alien would raise a\nserious constitutional problem.”  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690. \nAlthough the state has legitimate interests in “ensuring the\nappearance of aliens at future immigration proceedings” and\n“protecting the community,” post–removal period detention\ndoes not uniformly “‘bear[] [a] reasonable relation to the\npurpose for which the individual [was] committed.’”  Id.\n(second and third alterations in original) (quoting Jackson,\n406 U.S. at 738).  To avoid constitutional concerns, the Court\nconstrued  8  U.S.C.  §  1231(a)(6),  the  statute  governing\npost–removal  period  detention,  to  “limit[]  an  alien’s\npost-removal-period  detention  to  a  period  reasonably\nnecessary to bring about that alien’s removal from the United\nStates.”  Id. at 689.  Detention beyond that point requires\n“strong procedural protections” and a finding that the non-\ncitizen is “specially dangerous.”  Id. at 691.\nSoon after Zadvydas, the Court rejected a due process\nchallenge to mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c),\nwhich applies to non-citizens convicted of certain crimes. \nDemore,  538  U.S.  at  517–18.    While  affirming  its\n“longstanding view that the Government may constitutionally\ndetain deportable aliens during the limited period necessary\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 30 of 57   Page ID\n #:9661\n30 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nfor  their  removal  proceedings,”  id.  at  526,  the  Court\nemphasized  that  detention  under  §  1226(c)  was\nconstitutionally  permissible  because  it  has  “a  definite\ntermination point” and typically “lasts for less than . . . 90\ndays,” id. at 529.\nSince Zadvydas and Demore, our court has “grappled in\npiece-meal fashion with whether the various immigration\ndetention  statutes  may  authorize  indefinite  or  prolonged\ndetention of detainees and, if so, may do so without providing\na bond hearing.”  Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d at 1134 (quoting\nRodriguez I, 591 F.3d at 1114).  As we recognized in Casas,\n“prolonged detention without adequate procedural protections\nwould  raise  serious  constitutional  concerns.”    Casas,\n535 F.3d at 950; see also Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d at 1144\n(discussing “the constitutional concerns raised by prolonged\nmandatory detention”); Singh, 638 F.3d at 1208 (“The private\ninterest  here—freedom  from  prolonged  detention—is\nunquestionably substantial.”); Diouf II, 634 F.3d at 1085\n(“When the period of detention becomes prolonged, ‘the\nprivate interest that will be affected by the official action’ is\nmore substantial; greater procedural safeguards are therefore\nrequired.”) (quoting Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335\n(1976)).  We have therefore held that non-citizens detained\npursuant to § 1226(a) and § 1231(a)(6) are entitled to bond\nhearings before an IJ when detention becomes prolonged. \nSee Casas, 535 F.3d at 949 (requiring bond hearings for\nindividuals detained under § 1226(a)); Diouf II, 634 F.3d at\n1084  (extending  Casas  to  individuals  detained  under\n§ 1231(a)(6)).\nWhile the government falsely equates the bond hearing\nrequirement to mandated release from detention or facial\ninvalidation of a general detention statute, our precedents\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 31 of 57   Page ID\n #:9662\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 31\nmake clear that there is a distinction “between detention\nbeing authorized and being necessary as to any particular\nperson.”  Casas, 535 F.3d at 949.  Bond hearings do not\nrestrict  the  government’s  legitimate  authority  to  detain\ninadmissible or deportable non-citizens; rather, they merely\nrequire the government to “justify denial of bond” with clear\nand convincing “evidence that an alien is a flight risk or\ndanger to the community.”  Singh, 638 F.3d at 1203.  And, in\nthe end, the government is required only to establish that it\nhas  a  legitimate  interest  reasonably  related to  continued\ndetention; the discretion to release a non-citizen on bond or\nother conditions remains soundly in the judgment of the\nimmigration judges the Department of Justice employs.\nPrior decisions have also clarified that detention becomes\n“prolonged”  at  the  six-month  mark.    In  Zadvydas,  the\nSupreme Court recognized six months as a “presumptively\nreasonable period of detention.”  533 U.S. at 701.  By way of\nbackground, the Court noted that in 1996, Congress had\n“shorten[ed] the removal period from six months to 90 days.” \nId. at 698.  The Court then explained:\nWhile an argument can be made for confining\nany presumption to 90 days, we doubt that\nwhen Congress shortened the removal period\nto  90  days  in  1996  it  believed  that  all\nreasonably  foreseeable  removals  could  be\naccomplished  in  that  time.    We  do  have\nreason  to  believe,  however,  that  Congress\npreviously  doubted  the  constitutionality  of\ndetention  for  more  than  six  months.\nConsequently,  for  the  sake  of  uniform\nadministration  in  the  federal  courts,  we\nrecognize that period.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 32 of 57   Page ID\n #:9663\n32 RODRIGUEZ V.

Following Zadvydas, we have defined detention\nas “prolonged” when “it has lasted six months and is expected\nto continue more than minimally beyond six months.”  Diouf\nII, 634 F.3d at 1092 n.13.7  At that point, we have explained,\n“the private interests at stake are profound,” and “the risk of\nan erroneous deprivation of liberty in the absence of a hearing\nbefore a neutral decisionmaker is substantial.”  Id. at 1092.\nB. Entitlement to a Bond Hearing\nWith  this  well-established  precedent of  the  Supreme\nCourt and our Court in mind, we review the district court’s\ngrant  of  summary  judgment  and  entry  of  a  permanent\ninjunction.    We  consider,  in  turn,  whether  individuals\ndetained under §§ 1226(c), 1225(b), 1226(a), and 1231(a) are\nentitled to bond hearings after they have been detained for six\nmonths.\n1. The § 1226(c) Subclass\nSection 1226(c) requires that the Attorney General detain\nany non-citizen who is inadmissible or deportable because of\n   7 As we noted in Rodriguez II, this holding does not conflict with the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Demore, 538 U.S. 510, which approved only\n“brief period[s]” of detention without individualized determinations as to\ndangerousness and flight risk.

It also applies to non-\ncitizens who are deportable on account of having been convicted of two\nor more crimes involving moral turpitude, an aggravated felony, a\ncontrolled substance offense, certain firearm-related offenses, or certain\nother miscellaneous crimes; having committed a crime of moral turpitude\nwithin a certain period of time since their date of admission for which a\nsentence of one year or longer has been imposed; or having connections\nto terrorism.

Dec. at 806, because the government retains discretionary\nauthority to detain the individual under § 1226(a).  Instead,\nsuch a determination allows the IJ to consider granting bond\nunder the § 1226(a) standards, namely, whether the detainee\nwould pose a danger or flight risk if released.  See id.; see\nalso Demore, 538 U.S. at 532 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\nAs a result of § 1226(c)’s mandatory language and the\nlimited  review  available  through  a  Joseph  hearing,\nindividuals are often detained for years without adequate\nprocess.  See, e.g., Tijani, 430 F.3d at 1242 (lawful permanent\nresident  detained  for  more  than  two  and  a  half  years). \nMembers of the § 1226(c) subclass also tend to be detained\nfor longer periods than other class members:  The longest-\ndetained class member was confined for 1,585 days and\ncounting as of April 28, 2012, and the average subclass\nmember  faces  detention  for  427  days.    These  lengthy\ndetention times bear no relationship to the seriousness of\nclass  members’  criminal  history  or  the  lengths  of  their\npreviously served criminal sentences.  In several instances\nidentified by class counsel, a class member was sentenced to\none  to  three  months  in  prison  for  a  minor  controlled\nsubstances  offense,  then  endured  one  or  two  years  in\nimmigration detention.  Nor do these detention durations bear\nany relation to the merits of the subclass members’ claims: \nOf the § 1226(c) subclass members who apply for relief from\nremoval, roughly 40% are granted such relief, a rate even\nhigher than that of the overall class.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 35 of 57   Page ID\n #:9666\nRODRIGUEZ V.

To avoid these “constitutional\nconcerns, § 1226(c)’s mandatory language must be construed\n‘to contain an implicit reasonable time limitation.’”  Id. at\n1138 (quoting Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 682).  Accordingly, at\nthe six-month mark, “when detention becomes prolonged,\n§  1226(c)  becomes  inapplicable,”  and  “the  Attorney\nGeneral’s detention authority rests with § 1226(a).”  Id.\n(citation omitted).  Under Casas, those detainees are then\nentitled  to  a  bond  hearing.    See  id.  (discussing  Casas,\n535 F.3d at 951).\nContrary to the government’s argument, this holding is\nconsistent with the text of § 1226(c), which requires that the\ngovernment detain certain non-citizens but does not mandate\nsuch detention for any particular length of time.  See id. at\n1138–39 (The government “does not argue that reading an\nimplicit temporal limitation on mandatory detention into the\nstatute is implausible.  Indeed, it could not do so, because\nsuch an argument is foreclosed by our decisions in Tijani and\nCasas.”) (alterations in original) (citation omitted).

The government also\nargues that any challenges to detention under § 1226(c) must be addressed\nthrough individual as-applied claims.  This argument is foreclosed by\nRodriguez  I,  which  reversed  the  district  court’s  denial  of  class\ncertification.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 39 of 57   Page ID\n #:9670\nRODRIGUEZ V.

As to all\nother applicants for admission, the statute provides that “if\nthe examining immigration officer determines that an alien\nseeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled\nto be admitted, the alien shall be detained” for removal\nproceedings.  Id. § 1225(b)(2)(A).\nUnder DHS regulations, non-citizens detained pursuant to\n§ 1225(b) are generally not eligible for release on bond. \n8 C.F.R. § 236.1(c)(2).  If there are “urgent humanitarian\nreasons or significant public benefit[s]” at stake,10 however,\nthe Attorney General has discretion to temporarily parole\nsuch an individual into the United States, provided that the\nindividual presents neither a danger nor a risk of flight. \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).  Because parole decisions under\n§ 1182 are purely discretionary, they cannot be appealed to\nIJs or courts.  This lack of review has proven especially\nproblematic when immigration officers have denied parole\nbased on blatant errors:  In two separate cases identified by\nthe petitioners, for example, officers apparently denied parole\nbecause they had confused Ethiopia with Somalia.  And in a\nthird case, an officer denied parole because he had mixed up\ntwo detainees’ files.\nAs with § 1226(c), the government often cites § 1225(b)’s\nmandatory  language  to  justify  indefinite  civil  detention\nwithout an individualized determination as to whether the\n   10 Under this standard, detainees are eligible for parole if they have\nserious medical conditions, are pregnant, are juveniles who meet certain\nconditions, or will be witnesses in judicial, administrative, or legislative\nproceedings.

ROBBINS\ndetainee would pose a danger or flight risk if released.  See,\ne.g., Nadarajah, 443 F.3d at 1071, 1076 (asylum seeker\ndetained for nearly five years).  Section 1225(b) subclass\nmembers have been detained for as long as 831 days, and for\nan average of 346 days each.  These individuals apply for and\nreceive relief from removal at very high rates:  94% apply,\nand of those who apply, 64% are granted relief.  In illustrative\ncases identified by the petitioners, non-citizens fled to the\nUnited States after surviving kidnapping, torture, and murder\nof their family members in their home countries.  Upon\narrival, these individuals were detained under § 1225(b), and\nthey remained in detention until the government granted their\nasylum applications hundreds of days later.\nIn Rodriguez II, we extended Casas and held that to avoid\nserious constitutional concerns, mandatory detention under\n§ 1225(b), like mandatory detention under § 1226(c), must be\nconstrued as implicitly time-limited.  Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d\nat  1144.    Accordingly,  “the  mandatory  provisions  of\n§ 1225(b) simply expire at six months, at which point the\ngovernment’s authority to detain the alien shifts to § 1226(a),\nwhich  is  discretionary  and  which  we  have  already  held\nrequires a bond hearing.”  Id. (citing Casas, 535 F.3d at 948).\nIn so holding, we recognized that many members of the\n§ 1225(b) subclass are subject to the “entry fiction” doctrine,\nunder which non-citizens seeking admission to the United\nStates “may physically be allowed within its borders pending\na determination of admissibility,” but “are legally considered\nto be detained at the border and hence as never having\neffected  entry  into  this  country.”    Id.  at  1140  (quoting\nBarrera-Echevarria, 44 F.3d at 1450).  Such non-citizens\ntherefore “enjoy very limited protections under the United\nStates constitution.”  Id. (quoting Barrera-Echevarria, 44\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 41 of 57   Page ID\n #:9672\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 41\nF.3d at 1450).  However, even if the majority of prolonged\ndetentions under § 1225(b) are constitutionally permissible,\n“the Supreme Court has instructed that, where one possible\napplication of a statute raises constitutional concerns, the\nstatute as a whole should be construed through the prism of\nconstitutional avoidance.”  Id. at 1141 (citing Clark, 543 U.S.\nat 380).  Section 1225(b) applies to several categories of\nlawful permanent residents who are not subject to the entry\nfiction doctrine but may be treated as seeking admission\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C).  See id. at 1141–42.11 \n   11 Section 1101(a)(13)(C) provides that:\nAn alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in\nthe United States shall not be regarded as seeking an\nadmission into the United States for purposes of the\nimmigration laws unless the alien—\n(i) has abandoned or relinquished that status,\n(ii) has been absent from the United States for a\ncontinuous period in excess of 180 days,\n(iii) has engaged in illegal activity after having departed\nthe United States,\n(iv) has departed from the United States while under\nlegal process seeking removal of the alien from the\nUnited States, including removal proceedings under this\nchapter and extradition proceedings,\n(v) has committed an offense identified in section\n1182(a)(2) of this title, unless since such offense the\nalien has been granted relief under section 1182(h) or\n1229b(a) of this title, or\n(vi) is attempting to enter at a time or place other than\nas designated by immigration officers or has not been\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 42 of 57   Page ID\n #:9673\n42 RODRIGUEZ V.

We\ntherefore construed the statutory scheme to require a bond\nhearing  after  six  months  of  detention  under  §  1225(b). \nRodriguez II, 715 F.3d at 1144.\nThe government now  argues that “[d]espite years of\ndiscovery, petitioners have not identified any member of the\nSection  1225(b)  subclass  who  is  a  [lawful  permanent\nresident].”  Petitioners represent that they have found lawful\npermanent residents who have been detained for more than\nsix months under § 1225(b), although their submissions do\nnot identify any specific individuals who fit that description. \nThe question, however, is whether “one possible application\nof [the] statute raises constitutional concerns.”  Rodriguez II,\n715 F.3d at 1141.  Because the government concedes that\ndetention of lawful permanent residents under § 1225(b) is\npossible under § 1101(a)(13)(C), “the statute as a whole\nshould  be  construed  through  the  prism  of  constitutional\navoidance.”  Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d at 1141; see also Clark,\n543 U.S. at 380 (“It is not at all unusual to give a statute’s\nambiguous language a limiting construction called for by one\nof the statute’s applications, even though other of the statute’s\napplications, standing alone, would not support the same\nlimitation.

ROBBINS 43\nThe  government  also  argues  that  lawful  permanent\nresidents treated as seeking admission are entitled to lesser\ndue  process  protections  than  other  lawful  permanent\nresidents.  But the government has not provided any authority\nto  support  that  proposition:    The  cases  cited  in  the\ngovernment’s  brief  address  statutory  and  regulatory\ndistinctions between lawful permanent residents treated as\napplicants  for  admission  and  other  lawful  permanent\nresidents; they do not reflect any constitutional distinction\nbetween  those  groups.    See  Gonzaga-Ortega  v.  Holder,\n736 F.3d 795, 8014 (9th Cir. 2013) (holding that lawful\npermanent residents treated as applicants for admission are\nnot  entitled  to  counsel  under  8  C.F.R.  §  292.5(b));\nToro-Romero v. Ashcroft, 382 F.3d 930, 936 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(explaining  that  different  statutes  govern  exclusion  of\ninadmissible non-citizens and removal of deportable non-\ncitizens); Raya-Ledesma v.

This  argument  relies  on  an  implausible\nconstruction of the statutes at issue.  Section 1225(b) applies\nto  “applicants  for  admission,”  and  §  1101  defines  six\ncategories  of  lawful  permanent residents  as  “seeking  an\nadmission  into  the  United  States  for  purposes  of  the\nimmigration laws.”  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C); see also\nGonzaga-Ortega, 736 F.3d at 801 (“Ordinarily a returning\n[lawful permanent resident] is not treated as an ‘applicant for\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 44 of 57   Page ID\n #:9675\n44 RODRIGUEZ V.

Chew\ninvolved a pre-IIRIRA immigration regulation that applied to\n“excludable” non-citizens.  Id. at 591 n.1.  Because the\nregulations were silent as to whether that category included\nlawful permanent residents returning from voyages abroad,\nthe Court distinguished between the “exclusion” of newly\narriving non-citizens and the “expulsion” of lawful permanent\nresidents,  thereby  holding  that  the  regulation  did  not\nauthorize the Attorney General to detain arriving lawful\npermanent residents without hearings.  Id. at 598–99.  Section\n1101(a)(13)(C)  forecloses  an  analogous  construction  of\n§ 1225(b) because it provides that “applicants for admission”\nincludes several groups of lawful permanent residents.  See\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C).  In any event, the government’s\nalternative construction of § 1225(b) was never raised before\nthe district court; the argument is therefore forfeited.  See\nMunns v. Kerry, 782 F.3d 402, 412 (9th Cir. 2015); Saldana\nv. Occidental Petrol. Corp., 774 F.3d 544, 554 (9th Cir.\n2014).\nAccordingly,  we  adhere  to  Rodriguez  II’s  holding\nregarding the § 1225(b) subclass as law of the case and law\nof the circuit.

ROBBINS 45\n3. The § 1226(a) Subclass\nSection 1226(a) authorizes detention “pending a decision\non whether the alien is to be removed from the United\nStates.”  8 U.S.C. § 1226(a).  The statute expressly authorizes\nrelease on “bond of at least $1,500” or “conditional parole.”13 \nId. § 1226(a)(2).  Following an initial custody determination\nby  DHS,  a  non-citizen  may  apply  for  a  review  or\nredetermination by an IJ, and that decision may be appealed\nto the BIA.  See 8 C.F.R. §§ 236.1, 1003.19.  At these\nhearings, the detainee bears the burden of establishing “that\nhe or she does not present a danger to persons or property, is\nnot a threat to the national security, and does not pose a risk\nof flight.”  Guerra, 24 I. & N.

The\ngovernment also argues that bond hearings are unnecessary because non-\ncitizens detained under § 1225(b) can be released on parole.

Because Rodriguez II involved pure questions of law,\nthis new evidence is not material and does not alter our conclusions.\n   13 “‘[C]onditional parole’ under §1226(a)(2)(B) is a ‘distinct and\ndifferent procedure’ from ‘parole’ under § 1182(d)(5)(A)).”  Garcia v.\nHolder,  659  F.3d  1261,  1268  (9th  Cir.  2011)  (quoting  In  re\nCastillo-Padilla, 25 I. & N.

As discussed\nabove, § 1182(d)(5)(A) authorizes the Attorney General to temporarily\nrelease non-citizens detained under  § 1225(b) “for urgent humanitarian\nreasons or significant public benefit.”  Conditional parole under § 1226(a),\nby contrast, provides for release from detention if the non-citizen “would\nnot pose a danger to property or persons” and “is likely to appear for any\nfurther proceeding.”  8 C.F.R. § 236.1(c)(8).\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 46 of 57   Page ID\n #:9677\n46 RODRIGUEZ V.

The government\nhas taken the position that additional time spent in detention\nis not a “changed circumstance” that entitles a detainee to a\nnew bond hearing.\nAlthough § 1226(a) provides for discretionary, rather than\nmandatory,  detention  and  establishes  a  mechanism  for\ndetainees to seek release on bond, non-citizens often face\nprolonged detention under that section.  See, e.g., Casas,\n535 F.3d at 944 (lawful permanent resident detained for seven\nyears); Singh, 638 F.3d at 1203 (lawful permanent resident\ndetained for nearly four years).  In an extreme case identified\nby the petitioners, a non-citizen with no criminal record\nentered the United States on a tourist visa and affirmatively\napplied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under\nthe  Convention  Against  Torture  shortly  after  that  visa\nexpired.    ICE  detained  him  throughout  the  ensuing\nproceedings before the IJ, the BIA, and the Ninth Circuit.  At\nthe  time  petitioners  generated  their  report,  he  had  been\ndetained for 1,234 days with no definite end in sight.\nThe district court’s decision regarding the § 1226(a)\nsubclass  was  squarely  controlled  by  our  precedents.   In\nCasas, we held that a non-citizen subjected to prolonged\ndetention under § 1226(a) is entitled to a hearing to establish\nwhether continued detention is necessary because he would\npose a danger to the community or a flight risk upon release. \n535  F.3d  at  949–52.    Since  deciding  Casas,  we  have\nrepeatedly affirmed its holding.  See Cole v. Holder, 659 F.3d\n762, 769 n.7 (9th Cir. 2011); Singh, 638 F.3d at 1200;\nAguilar-Ramos v.

App’x 328, 329–30 (9th\nCir. 2008) (non-precedential memorandum disposition).\nThe  government  does  not  contest  that  Casas  is  the\nbinding law of this circuit or that individuals detained under\n§  1226(a)  are  entitled  to  bond  hearings.    Instead,  the\ngovernment argues that § 1226(a) affords detainees the right\nto request bond hearings, see 8 C.F.R. § 236.1, so there is no\nbasis for requiring the government to automatically provide\nbond hearings after six months of detention.  This argument\nis foreclosed by Casas, which held that “§ 1226(c) must be\nconstrued as requiring the Attorney General to provide the\nalien with [a bond] hearing.”  535 F.3d at 951; see also\nRodriguez  II,  715  F.3d  at  1135  (citing  Casas  for  the\nproposition that under § 1226(a), “a bond hearing is required\nbefore the government may detain an alien for a ‘prolonged’\nperiod”).  The record evinces the importance of Casas’s\nholding on this point:  Detainees, who typically have no\nchoice but to proceed pro se, have limited access to legal\nresources, often lack English-language proficiency, and are\nsometimes illiterate.  As a result, many class members are not\naware of their right to a bond hearing and are poorly equipped\nto request one.  Accordingly, we conclude that class members\nare entitled to automatic bond hearings after six months of\ndetention.  We address the other procedural requirements for\nthese hearings in Section IV.B, infra.\n4. The § 1231(a) Subclass\nSection 1231(a) governs detention of non-citizens who\nhave been “ordered removed.”  8 U.S.C. § 1231(a).

Rather,\nthe Attorney General has discretion to detain certain classes\nof non-citizens and to impose conditions of release on others. \nId. § 1231(a)(3), (a)(6).14  Before releasing a detainee, the\ngovernment must conclude that removal is “not practicable or\nnot in the public interest,” that the detainee is “non-violent”\nand “not likely to pose a threat to the community following\n   14 To avoid “serious constitutional concerns,” we have previously\n“construe[d] § 1231(a)(6) as requiring an individualized bond hearing,\nbefore an immigration judge, for aliens facing prolonged detention under\nthat provision.”  Diouf II, 634 F.3d at 1086 (quoting Casas, 535 F.3d at\n950).\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 49 of 57   Page ID\n #:9680\nRODRIGUEZ V.

However, if a non-citizen\nhas received a stay of removal from the BIA pending further\nadministrative review, then the order of removal is not yet\n“administratively final.”  8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(B)(i).  The\nnon-citizen has not been “ordered removed,” and the removal\nperiod has not begun, so § 1231(a) is inapplicable.  See\nOwino v. Napolitano, 575 F.3d 952, 955 (9th Cir. 2009)\n(“[W]hile administrative proceedings are pending on remand,\nOwino will not be subject to a final order of removal, so\n§ 1231 cannot apply.”).  Similarly, as long as a non-citizen’s\nremoval order is stayed by a court pending judicial review,\nthat non-citizen is not subject to “the court’s final order.” \n8  U.S.C.  §  1231(a)(1)(B)(ii).    In  such  circumstances,\n§ 1231(a) is, again, inapplicable.  See Prieto-Romero v.\nClark, 534 F.3d 1053, 1059 (9th Cir. 2008) (“[Section]\n1231(a) does not provide authority to detain an alien . . .\nwhose removal has been stayed by a court of appeals pending\nits disposition of his petition for review.”); Casas, 535 F.3d\nat 947 (“If an alien has filed a petition for review with this\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 50 of 57   Page ID\n #:9681\n50 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\ncourt and received a judicial stay of removal, the ‘removal\nperiod’ under § 1231(a) does not begin until this court ‘denies\nthe petition and withdraws the stay of removal.’”) (quoting\nPrieto-Romero, 534 F.3d at 1060).15\nSimply put, the § 1231(a) subclass does not exist.  The\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment and permanent\ninjunction are therefore reversed to the extent they pertain to\nindividuals detained under § 1231(a).\nC. Procedural Requirements\nIn addition to challenging the class members’ entitlement\nto automatic bond hearings after six months of detention, the\ngovernment objects to the district court’s order regarding the\nburden  and  standard  of  proof  at  such  hearings.    The\ngovernment also appeals the district court’s ruling that IJs\nmust consider alternatives to detention.  Petitioners cross-\nappeal the district court’s rulings that IJs are not required to\nconsider the ultimate likelihood of removal, assess the total\nlength of detention, or conduct periodic hearings at six-month\nintervals.  We address each issue in turn.\n1. Burden and Standard of Proof\nThe government argues that the district court erred in\nrequiring the government to justify a non-citizen’s detention\n   15 “Such aliens may be detained, however, pursuant to § 1226(a), which\nallows the Attorney General to detain any alien ‘pending a decision on\nwhether the alien is to be removed from the United States.’” Prieto-\nRomero, 534 F.3d at 1059.  As noted, non-citizens subjected to prolonged\ndetention under § 1226(a) are entitled to bond hearings.  See Casas,\n535 F.3d at 944, 949–51.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 51 of 57   Page ID\n #:9682\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 51\nby clear and convincing evidence, an intermediate burden of\nproof that is more than a preponderance of the evidence but\nless than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  As we noted in\nRodriguez II, however, we are bound by our precedent in\nSingh, which held that “the government must prove by clear\nand convincing evidence that an alien is a flight risk or a\ndanger to the community to justify denial of bond at a Casas\nhearing.”  Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d at 1135 (quoting Singh,\n638 F.3d at 1203).\nIn Singh, we explained that the “Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly reaffirmed the principle that ‘due process places a\nheightened burden of proof on the State in civil proceedings\nin  which  the  individual  interests  at  stake  .  .  .  are both\nparticularly important and more substantial than mere loss of\nmoney.’”  638 F.3d at 1204 (alteration in original) (quoting\nCooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U.S. 348, 363 (1996) (criminal\ndefendant’s  competence  to  stand  trial))  (citing  Foucha,\n504  U.S.  at  80  (indefinite  confinement  of  a  criminal\ndefendant acquitted by reason of insanity); Woodby v. INS,\n385 U.S. 276, 285 (1966) (deportation of a lawful permanent\nresident); Chaunt v. United States, 364 U.S. 350, 353 (1960)\n(revocation  of  naturalized  citizenship)).    In  the  civil\ncommitment context, for example, the Supreme Court has\nrecognized “the state’s interest in committing the emotionally\ndisturbed,” but has held that “the individual’s interest in not\nbeing involuntarily confined indefinitely . . . is of such weight\nand gravity that due process requires the state to justify\nconfinement  by  proof  more  substantial  than  a  mere\npreponderance  of  the  evidence.”    Addington  v.  Texas,\n441 U.S. 418, 425–27 (1979).  Drawing on this jurisprudence,\nSingh  concluded  that  “a  clear  and  convincing  evidence\nstandard of proof provides the appropriate level of procedural\nprotection” in light of “the substantial liberty interest at\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 52 of 57   Page ID\n #:9683\n52 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nstake.”  638 F.3d at 1203–04 (citing Addington, 441 U.S. at\n427).\nThe government now contends that Singh was wrongly\ndecided.  However, it is well established that only a full court,\nsitting en banc, may overrule a three-judge panel decision. \nSee Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 900 (9th Cir. 2003). \nRight  or  wrong,  we  are  bound  to  follow  Singh  unless\nintervening Supreme Court authority is to the contrary.  Id.\n2. Restrictions Short of Detention\nThe government also argues that the district court erred in\n“determin[ing] that IJs are required to consider the use of\nalternatives to detention in making bond determinations.”  As\nthe district court’s order states, however, IJs “should already\nbe considering restrictions short of incarceration.”  Indeed,\nRodriguez II affirmed a preliminary injunction that directed\nIJs  to  “release  each  Subclass  member  on  reasonable\nconditions of supervision, including electronic monitoring if\nnecessary, unless the government” satisfied its burden of\njustifying continued detention.  715 F.3d at 1131 (emphasis\nadded).\nThe  government’s  objections  to  this  requirement are\nunpersuasive.  First, the government relies on Demore for the\nproposition that the government is not required “to employ\nthe  least  burdensome  means”  of  securing  immigration\ndetainees.  Demore, 538 U.S. at 528.  But Demore applies\nonly to “brief period[s]” of immigration detention.  Id. at 513,\n523.  “When the period of detention becomes prolonged, ‘the\nprivate interest that will be affected by the official action’ is\nmore substantial; greater procedural safeguards are therefore\nrequired.”  Diouf II, 634 F.3d at 1091 (quoting Mathews, 424\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 53 of 57   Page ID\n #:9684\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 53\nU.S. at 335).  Further, the injunction does not require that IJs\napply the least restrictive means of supervision; it merely\ndirects them to “consider” restrictions short of detention.  The\nIJ ultimately must decide whether any restrictions short of\ndetention  would  further  the  government’s  interest  in\ncontinued detention.\nSecond,  the  government  argues  that  IJs  are  not\nempowered  to  impose  conditions  of  release.    However,\nfederal  regulations  authorize  IJs  to  “detain  the  alien  in\ncustody, release the alien, and determine the amount of bond,\nif any, under which the respondent may be released” and to\n“ameliorat[e] the conditions” of release imposed by DHS.  8\nC.F.R. § 1236.1(d)(1).  Accordingly, if DHS detains a non-\ncitizen, an IJ is already empowered to “ameliorat[e] the\nconditions”  by  imposing  a  less  restrictive  means  of\nsupervision than detention.16\nFinally, the government argues that IJs lack the resources\nto engage in continuous monitoring of released individuals. \nHowever, the government fails to cite any law or evidence\nindicating that IJs, rather than DHS or ICE agents, would be\nresponsible  for  implementing  the  conditions  of  release. \nMoreover, the record indicates that Congress authorized and\nfunded an ICE alternatives-to-detention program in 2002, and\nDHS  has  operated  such  a  program,  called  the  Intensive\nSupervision and Appearance Program, since 2004.  It is\n   16 The authorities the government cites provide no support for this\nargument.  One discusses DHS officers’ authority to impose conditions of\nrelease and allows IJs to “ameliorat[e] those conditions,” see 8 C.F.R.\n§ 236.1; the other provides only that IJs may not grant relief from removal\nfor the purpose of fulfilling the United States’ treaty obligations, see In re\nG-K-, 26 I. & N. Dec. 88, 93 (BIA 2013).\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 54 of 57   Page ID\n #:9685\n54 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\nabundantly clear that IJs can and do17 consider conditions of\nrelease on bond when determining whether the government’s\ninterests can be served by detention only, and we conclude\nthat DHS will administer any such conditions, regardless of\nwhether they are imposed by DHS in the first instance or by\nan IJ upon later review.\n3. Length of Detention and Likelihood of Removal\nIn their cross-appeal, petitioners argue that the district\ncourt erred in failing to require IJs to consider the length of a\nnon-citizen’s past and likely future detention and, relatedly,\nthe likelihood of eventual removal from the United States.  In\nour prior decisions, we have not directly addressed whether\ndue process requires consideration of the length of future\ndetention at bond hearings.  We have noted, however, that\n“the due process analysis changes as ‘the period of . . .\nconfinement grows,’” and that longer detention requires more\nrobust procedural protections.  Diouf II, 634 F.3d at 1086\n(quoting Zadvydas, 634 F.3d 1081).  Accordingly, a non-\ncitizen detained for one or more years is entitled to greater\nsolicitude  than  a  non-citizen  detained  for  six  months. \n   17 On September 10, 2015, the government provided us with the only\ntranscript of a Rodriguez hearing in this record, which took place on April\n28, 2015, and concerned a Mr. Kaene Dean.  There, the IJ did consider\nand impose conditions of release in addition to bond, including monthly\nreporting to DHS and enrollment in a mental health treatment plan.  From\nthe transcript, it does not appear that the government presented any\nevidence that these conditions would be insufficient to prevent the risk of\ndanger to the community, or even any evidence at all.  However, the IJ’s\ndecision to release on bond a recidivist sexual offender whom the DOJ\nhad released twice before in proceedings unrelated to this case under\n§ 1226(a) and who had twice before violated the conditions of his release\non bond is not before us.  See October 2, 2015 Order.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 55 of 57   Page ID\n #:9686\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 55\nMoreover, Supreme Court precedent provides that “detention\nincidental to removal must bear a reasonable relation to its\npurpose.”  Tijani, 430 F.3d at 1249 (Tashima, J., concurring)\n(citing Demore, 538 U.S. at 527; Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690). \nAt some point, the length of detention could “become[] so\negregious that it can no longer be said to be ‘reasonably\nrelated’ to an alien’s removal.”  Id. (citation omitted).  An IJ\ntherefore must consider the length of time for which a non-\ncitizen has already been detained.\nAs to the likely duration of future detention and the\nlikelihood of eventual removal, however, those factors are too\nspeculative  and  too  dependent  upon  the  merits  of  the\ndetainee’s claims for us to require IJs to consider during a\nbond hearing.  We therefore affirm the district court’s ruling\nthat consideration of those factors “would require legal and\npolitical  analyses  beyond  what  would  otherwise  be\nconsidered  at  a  bond  hearing”  and  is  therefore  not\nappropriate.  We note that Zadvydas and its progeny require\nconsideration  of  the  likelihood  of  removal  in  particular\ncircumstances,18 but we decline to require such analysis as a\nthreshold inquiry in all bond hearings.\n   18 Several of our cases have addressed petitions for habeas relief under\nZadvydas, which requires a detainee to prove that he “is not significantly\nlikely to be removed.”  Owino, 575 F.3d at 955; see also Diouf v. Mukasey\n(Diouf I), 542 F.3d 1222, 1233 (9th Cir. 2008); Prieto-Romero, 534 F.3d\nat 1065; Nadarajah, 443 F.3d at 1080.  Those decisions instruct IJs to\nconsider the likelihood of removal when, for instance, a detainee is\nstateless.  See Owino, 575 F.3d at 955–56.  However, petitioners have not\nidentified, and we have not found, authority that supports requiring this\ninquiry in all bond hearings.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 56 of 57   Page ID\n #:9687\n56 RODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS\n4. Periodic Hearings\nThe record shows that many class members are detained\nwell beyond the six-month mark:  Almost half remain in\ndetention at the twelve-month mark, one in five at eighteen\nmonths, and one in ten at twenty-four months.  Petitioners\nargue that due process requires additional bond hearings at\nsix-month intervals for class members who are detained for\nmore than six months after their initial bond hearings.  We\nhave not had occasion to address this issue in our previous\ndecisions, and it has been a source of some contention in the\ndistrict courts.  See, e.g., Vivorakit v. Holder, No. 14-04515,\n2015  WL  4593545,  at  *4  (N.D.  Cal.  July  30,  2015);\nCastaneda v. Aitken, No. 15-01635, 2015 WL 3882755, at\n*10 (N.D. Cal. June 23, 2015).\nThe district court here did not address this proposed\nrequirement.  For the same reasons the IJ must consider the\nlength of past detention, we hold that the government must\nprovide periodic bond hearings every six months so that non-\ncitizens may challenge their continued detention as “the\nperiod of . . . confinement grows.”  Diouf II, 634 F.3d at 1091\n(quoting Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701).\nV.  Conclusion\nThis decision flows from the Supreme Court’s and our\nown precedent bearing on the constitutional implications of\nour government’s prolonged civil detention of individuals,\nmany of whom have the legal right to live and work in our\ncountry.    By  upholding  the  district  court’s  order  that\nImmigration Judges must hold bond hearings for certain\ndetained individuals, we are not ordering Immigration Judges\nto release any single individual; rather we are affirming a\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 459   Filed 10/28/15   Page 57 of 57   Page ID\n #:9688\nRODRIGUEZ V. ROBBINS 57\nminimal  procedural  safeguard—a  hearing  at  which  the\ngovernment bears only an intermediate burden of proof in\ndemonstrating danger to the community or risk of flight—to\nensure  that  after  a  lengthy  period  of  detention,  the\ngovernment continues to have a legitimate interest in the\nfurther deprivation of an individual’s liberty.  Immigration\nJudges,  a  specialized  and  experienced  group  within  the\nDepartment of Justice, are already entrusted to make these\ndeterminations, and need not release any individual they find\npresents a danger to the community or a flight risk after\nhearing and weighing the evidence.  Accordingly, we affirm\nall aspects of the district court’s permanent injunction, with\nthree exceptions:  We reverse as to the § 1231(a) subclass,\nand we hold that IJs must consider the length of detention and\nprovide bond hearings every six months.  We hereby remand\nto the district court to enter a revised injunction consistent\nwith our instructions.\nAFFIRMED  IN  PART;  REVERSED  IN  PART;\nREMANDED.",

This information will be obtained by searching government\n6 computer systems.  The production shall occur within seven (7) court days of entry\n7 of this order and an order certifying the class.1  This information may be released\n8 to Petitioners’ counsel without Respondents obtaining prior written consent of\n9 those individuals whose names and other identifying information may be present in\n10 that production.  Such disclosure is subject to the following conditions:\n11 1. The terms of this Stipulated Protective Order will govern\n12 Respondents’ entire production of information regarding the names, alien numbers,\n13 locations, and attorney contact information, if any, for all immigration detainees\n14 detained for six months or longer in the Central District of California, as well as\n15 the safeguarding of such information by all individuals referenced in paragraph 5. \n16\n17 2. Respondents’ production of the names, alien numbers, locations, and\n18 attorney contact information, if any, for all immigration detainees detained for six\n19 months or longer in the Central District of California is appropriately deemed\n20 “Confidential” information, as defined infra at paragraph 3.  Such “Confidential”\n21 information is subject to the restrictions of this Protective Order and may be used\n22 solely for purposes of this litigation.  \n23\n24 1  Petitioner believes that the Court should order production of this information\nregardless of whether or not it certifies the class, because Petitioner believes the\n25 Court’s minute order of Monday, March 22, 2010 requires production of this\ninformation regardless of whether or not the class is certified.  Respondents, \n26 however, believe that, consistent with Respondents’ position on this matter, the\nCourt expressed its intent at the March 22, 2010 status conference to certify the\n27 class prior to requiring disclosure of the information at issue in this order.  The\nparties request that the Court clarify this issue (unless it is rendered moot by entry\n28 of an order certifying the class prior to entering this protective order).\n1\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 78    Filed 04/19/10   Page 4 of 6   Page ID #:503\n1 3. “Confidential” is defined as any information contained in the roster of\n2 names and other information to be produced by Respondents, the use of which\n3 would allow the identification of the person to whom the information relates. \n4 “Confidential” information includes the names, alien numbers, or any other\n5 identifying information which would allow the identification of the person to\n6 whom the information relates. \n7 4. Respondents will affix to the production of any “Confidential”\n8 information the words “CONFIDENTIAL” “THIS DOCUMENT IS SUBJECT TO\n9 A COURT ORDER IN THE RODRIGUEZ, ET AL. v.

The signed\n3 Acknowledgment forms shall be maintained by counsel for Respondents. \n4 8. Any filings by Petitioners with the Court which contain\n5 “Confidential” information shall be made under seal, unless a release is obtained\n6 from the individual to whom the “Confidential” information pertains authorizing\n7 the disclosure of such information, or the “Confidential” information is\n8 appropriately redacted to prevent identifying information from being disclosed.\n9 9. No “Confidential” information shall be used by Petitioner at any\n10 hearing, trial or appellate proceeding in this action, unless provision shall be made\n11 for exclusion of the public, permission is obtained from the individual to whom the\n12 “Confidential” information pertains authorizing the disclosure of such information,\n13 the “Confidential” information is appropriately redacted to prevent identifying\n14 information from being disclosed, or, by agreement of the parties, some other\n15 reasonable provision to protect “Confidential” information has been made.  Where\n16 “Confidential” information is used by Petitioners at a hearing, trial or appellate\n17 proceeding in this action, the appropriate portion of the Court transcript containing\n18 such “Confidential” information shall be placed under seal.

Petitioners Alejandro Rodriguez, Abdirizak Farah, Yussuf Abdikadir, Jose \n3  Farias Cornejo, Abel Perez Ruelas, and Angel Ayala are non-citizens who have been \n4  subjected to prolonged incarceration at the hands of the Immigration and Customs \n5  Enforcement division of the Department of Homeland Security (\"ICE\").  Each of \n6  them has been incarcerated for more than six months while their immigration \n7  proceedings have been on-going without a hearing where the government has had to \n8  justify their prolonged detention.  They challenge their prolonged detention without \n9  adequate process on statutory and constitutional grounds, on behalf of themselves and \nloa class of similarly-situated detainees. \n11  2.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over these claims pursuant to 28 \n12  U.S.C. 2241 (habeas corpus), 28 U.S.C. 1651 (All Writs Act), and the Suspension \n13  Clause of Article I of the U.S. Constitution.  INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 304 (2001); \n14  Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 516-17 (2003).  This Court also has jurisdiction to hear \n15  this case under 28 U.S.C. 1331, which confers jurisdiction to consider federal \n16  questions.  Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1052 (9th Cir. 1998); cf. Wilkinson v. \n17  Dotson, 544 U.S. 74, 82 (2005) (challenges to parole release procedures cognizable \n18  under Section 1983).1 \n19  3.  This Court may grant relief under 28 U.S.C. 1331 (federal question), 28 U.S.C. \n20  1651 (All Writs Act), 28 U.S.C. 2241 and 2243 (habeas corpus), and 28 U.S.C. 2201-\n21  02 (declaratory relief). \n22  4.  Venue is proper in the Central District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n23  2241 (d) because Petitioners and all other class members are incarcerated at \n24  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities within this District. \n25 \n26  1 This action is both a complaint for declaratory and injunctive reliefunder 28 U.S.C. \n1331 and a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. 2241, although for ease \n27  of reference the complaint refers to \"Petitioners\" and \"Respondents\" rather than \n28  \"Plaintiffs\" and \"Defendants.\" \n1 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 4 of 34   Page ID\n #:1047\n1  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. l39l(b) because a substantial part of the events \n2  giving rise to these claims occurred in this District. \n3  INTRODUCTION \n4  5.  Petitioner Alejandro Rodriguez is a citizen of Mexico who came to the United \n5  States at the age of one.  Prior to the filing of the original complaint in this case, he \n6  was detained for over three years without a hearing concerning whether his prolonged \n7  detention was justified.  During that time, the government refused even to consider \n8  him for release while he litigated his removal case, despite the fact that it presented a \n9  complex and novel question of law explicitly left open by the Supreme Court and the \n10  Ninth Circuit. \n11  6.  The government released Mr. Rodriguez shortly after he filed a motion for class \n12  certification in this case, but continued to subject him to serious restraints on his \n13  liberty without allowing him to challenge them in a detention hearing.  It then argued \n14  that his case was moot.  The Ninth Circuit disagreed, rejected the government's other \n15  objections, and found class certification warranted.  Rodriguez v. Hayes, 578 F.3d \n16  1032 (9th Cir. 2009). \n17  7.  This Court subsequently certified the class and directed the formation of sub-\n18  classes.  By this complaint, five other detainees now join Mr. Rodriguez as class \n19  representatives in this action.  Each of them has been detained for more than six \n20  months while their removal cases remain pending, yet none of them has been \n21  afforded a hearing where the government has had to justify their prolonged detention \n22  under sufficiently-rigorous procedures. \n23  8.  These detainees are far from alone.  On any given day, there are at least \n24  approximately 350 people, ifnot more, in immigration prisons throughout the Central \n25  District who have been incarcerated for more than six months - many of them for \n26 \n27 \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 5 of 34   Page ID\n #:1048\n2 \n1  years - while their cases remain pending.\n2  9.  None of these people have received a hearing to determine whether their \n3  prolonged detention is warranted, and the vast majority have not received any hearing \n4  at all.3  Thus, the government routinely incarcerates people for months or years \n5  without demonstrating why their extended detention is necessary either to secure \n6  their presence at the time of removal or to protect the public safety  -- a dubious \n7  concern given that many class members have no criminal history, and even those who \n8  have been convicted have necessarily finished serving their sentences before their \n9  transfer to immigration detention. \n10  10.  Petitioners, like all the detainees they seek to represent, are purportedly \n11  detained under one of four general immigration detention statutes that govern the \n12  detention of most non-citizens whom the government is trying to remove.  See 8 \n13  U.S.C. 1225(b) (authorizing detention of aliens seeking admission); 8 U.S.C. 1226(a) \n14  (authorizing detention of aliens pending a determination of removability); 8 U.S.C. \n15  1226( c ) (authorizing \"mandatory\" detention, without hearings, of certain aliens who, \n16 \n17  This Court ordered the government to provide a list of detainees to Petitioner.  That \n2 \nlist showed that over 350 people were detained in immigration prisons throughout the \n18 \nCentral District as of April 21, 2010. \n19 \nPetitioners refer interchangeably throughout this complaint to a hearing to determine \n20  3 \nwhether \"prolonged detention\" is justified, a \"constitutionally-adequate\" hearing, and \n21 \nan \"adequate\" hearing to justify prolonged detention.  See Rodriguez, 578 F.3d at \n1039 (noting that \"Petitioner's requested relief includes ... providing all members of \n22 \nthe class constitutionally-adequate individual hearings before an immigration judge\"). \n23  A hearing that is adequate to justify prolonged detention would include, at a \n24  minimum, notice to detainees of their right to the hearing, an adversarial, transcribed, \nin-person hearing before an immigration judge or other impartial adjudicator, counsel \n25 \nfor detainees who are unrepresented at that hearing, and a substantive standard \n26  requiring the government to show by clear and convincing evidence that no set of \nrelease conditions could reasonably assure the detainee's presence in the event of \n27  removal or protect the community from serious danger, taking into account the length \n28  of detention at issue. \n3 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 6 of 34   Page ID\n #:1049\n1  inter alia, have been convicted of specified triggering offenses); 8 U.S.C. 123l(a) \n2  (authorizing detention of aliens with final orders of removal during and after the \n3  removal period).  In keeping with the Ninth Circuit's terminology, these four statutes \n4  are referred to herein as the \"general immigration detention statutes.\"  See generally \n5  Nadaraiah v. Gonzales, 443 F.3d 1069, 1078, 1080-81 (9th Cir. 2006) (contrasting \n6  general immigration detention statutes that do not explicitly authorize prolonged \n7  detention with specific statutes at 8 U.S.C. 1226a and 8 U.S.C. 1531-37 that \n8  authorize prolonged detention on, inter alia, national security grounds). \n9  11.  Petitioners contend that because none of these general immigration detention \n10  statutes explicitly authorize prolonged detention, they cannot be interpreted to \n11  authorize detention of longer than six months absent a hearing where the government \n12  shows, under a suitably-rigorous standard, that further prolonged detention is \n13  justified.  See generally Casas-Castrillon v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 535 F.3d 942, \n14  950 (9th Cir. 2008) (construing general detention statutes to require bond hearings \n15  where government bears burden of proof because \"[w]e conclude that prolonged \n16  detention without adequate procedural protections would raise serious constitutional \n17  concerns\").  Moreover, if these statutes did authorize prolonged detention they would \n18  violate the Due Process Clause, at least absent substantially greater procedural \n19  constraints.  See generally Zadyydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690-92 (2001) (finding \n20  \"severe and obvious\" problems with prolonged and indefinite detention under limited \n21  administrative procedures). \n22  12.  Respondents, in contrast, maintain a policy or general practice - which \n23  Petitioners contend is unlawful - of detaining people for prolonged time periods \n24  without providing them adequate hearings.  Pursuant to this unlawful policy or \n25  general practice, Respondents have incarcerated the Petitioners and each of the class \n26  members they represent pursuant to one of the general immigration detention statutes \n27  for more than six months.  Pursuant to Respondents' policy or general practice, \n28  during that time neither Petitioners nor any other similarly-situated person have had a \n4 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 7 of 34   Page ID\n #:1050\n1  hearing where the government has had to show that their prolonged detention remains \n2  justified. \n3  13.  Respondents' general policies and practices of prolonged detention without \n4  hearings are in violation of the statutory and constitutional rights of the Petitioners \n5  and other class members.  To remedy this on-going violation of the law, Petitioners \n6  bring this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and \n7  a class of similarly-situated persons. \n8 \nPARTIES \n9 \n14.  Petitioner Alejandro Rodriguez is a citizen of Mexico.  He was detained for \n10 \nover three years while litigating his removal case prior to the filing of the original \n11  complaint in this case.  He has never been afforded a hearing to determine whether \n12 \nhis prolonged detention is justified.  He is currently residing in Los Angeles under \n13 \nextremely restrictive release conditions while his removal proceedings remain \n14 \npending. \n15 \n15.  Petitioner Abdirizak Aden Farah is a Somalian refugee who has been \n16 \nincarcerated at Mira Lorna Detention Center for over eight months without a hearing \n17 \nto determine that his detention is warranted.  Indeed, he has received no explanation \n18 \nof any kind as to why he cannot be released pending completion of his removal \n19 \nhearings, despite having a close family friend in Minnesota willing to house him and \n20 \nno criminal history of any kind. \n21 \n16.  Petitioner Yussuf Abdikadir is another Somalian refugee who has been \n22 \nincarcerated by ICE for approximately six months without a hearing to determine \n23 \nwhether his detention is warranted.  He too has received no explanation of any kind \n24 \nas to why he cannot be released pending completion of his removal proceedings, \n25 \ndespite having a sponsor in San Diego willing to house him and no criminal history \n26 \nof any kind. \n27 \n17.  Petitioner Abel Perez Ruelas is a Mexican national who entered the United \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 8 of 34   Page ID\n #:1051\n1  States on a visitor's visa approximately eight years ago and is now married to a U.S. \n2  citizen.  He has been incarcerated for 16 months pending completion his removal \n3  proceedings.  He received a bond hearing where he bore the burden to prove that he \n4  was not a danger or flight risk, but the judge denied bond, and later set it at an \n5  amount he could not pay.  Although he is without doubt eligible to adjust status, he \n6  remains detained, even though the government has never had to justify his prolonged \n7  detention. \n8  18.  Petitioner Jose Farias Cornejo is also a Mexican national, but is a lawful \n9  permanent resident of this country, where he has lived since before his first birthday. \n10  He has been convicted of relatively minor offenses, the most serious of which is \n11  possession of a controlled substance, for which he was sentenced to 180 days in jail. \n12  However, he has spent more than twice that amount of time in immigration prison \n13  while awaiting a final decision in his immigration case.  Although the government \n14  does not dispute that he is eligible for cancellation of removal and has stated in \n15  immigration court that it does not intend to oppose his application, he remains in \n16  detention awaiting a final decision in his case without having received a detention \n17  hearing of any kind.  As the government interprets the immigration laws, his drug \n18  conviction renders him ineligible even to be considered for release from detention, \n19  even though it does not bar him from obtaining relief to remain. \n20  19.  Petitioner Angel Armando Ayala is a citizen ofEl Salvador who has lived in the \n21  United States since the age of eleven.  He has never received a criminal sentence of \n22  longer than 90 days, but has been incarcerated by immigration authorities for over 18 \n23  months while litigating his removal case.  During that time he has never seen an \n24  immigration judge, let alone been afforded an adequate bond hearing in light of his \n25  prolonged detention.  He is prima facie eligible for relief allowing him to become a \n26  lawful permanent resident, but remains detained while the Ninth Circuit considers \n27  whether his prior lawyer's failure to advise him as to the filing deadline constitutes \n28  ineffective assistance of counsel, such that his failure to meet it does not bar him \n6 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 9 of 34   Page ID\n #:1052\n1  from obtaining relief for which he is otherwise-eligible. \n2  20.  Respondent Eric Holder is the Attorney General of the United States and the \n3  head of the Department of Justice, which encompasses the Board of Immigration \n4  Appeals (\"BIA\") and immigration judges as a subunit - the Executive Office of \n5  Immigration Review.  Mr. Holder shares responsibility for implementation and \n6  enforcement of the immigration laws along with Respondent Napolitano.  Mr. Holder \n7  is a legal custodian of Petitioners.  Mr. Holder is sued in his official capacity. \n8  21.  Respondent Janet Napolitano is the Secretary of Homeland Security and heads \n9  the Department of Homeland Security, the arm of the federal government responsible \n10  for enforcement of immigration laws.  Ms. Napolitano is the ultimate legal custodian \n11  of Petitioners.  Ms. Napolitano is sued in her official capacity. \n12  22.  Defendant Thomas G. Snow is the Acting Director for the Executive Office for \n13  Immigration Review (\"EOIR\"), which is the federal agency that operates the \n14  immigration courts.  Mr. Snow is responsible for the supervision of the Deputy \n15  Director, the Chairman of the BIA, the Chief Immigration Judge, the Chief \n16  Administrative Hearing Officer, and all agency personnel in the execution of their \n17  duties.  Mr. Snow is sued in his official capacity. \n18  23.  Respondent Timothy Robbins is the Field Office Director for the Los Angeles \n19  District of ICE.  In his official capacity, Mr. Robbins is authorized to release \n20  Petitioners and has legal custody of him.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n21  24.  Respondent Lee Baca is the Sheriff of Los Angeles County, and therefore the \n22  officer responsible for the operation of the Mira Lorna Detention Center in Lancaster, \n23  California.  Mira Lorna's website acknowledges that it houses immigration detainees. \n24  However, it states that \"[w  ]e function as a regular County jail with the exception that \n25  the individuals we house are identified as detainees.\"  Sheriff Baca is a legal \n26  custodian of people detained at that facility, and is sued in his official capacity. \n27  25.  Respondent Wesley Lee is the Officer-in-Charge at the Mira Lorna Detention \n28  Center, and therefore the highest-ranking ICE officer at the facility.  He is a legal \n7 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 10 of 34   Page ID\n #:1053\n1  custodian of a number of class members.  Mr. Lee is sued in his official capacity. \n2  26.  Respondent Rodney Penner is the Captain of the Mira Lorna Detention Center, \n3  and the highest ranking Sheriffs Department official at the facility.  Captain Penner \n4  is a legal custodian of a number of class members, and is sued in his official capacity. \n5  27.  Respondent Sandra Hutchens is the Sheriff of Orange County, and therefore the \n6  officer responsible for the operation of the Theo Lacy Facility and the James Musick \n7  facility, both of which incarcerate class members in Orange County.  She is a legal \n8  custodian of people detained at those facilities, and is sued in her official capacity. \n9  28.  Respondent Officer Nguyen is the Officer-in-Charge at the Theo Lacy facility, \n10  and therefore the highest-ranking ICE officer at the facility.  He is a legal custodian \n11  ofMr. Ayala and other class members.  Mr. Nguyen is sued in his official capacity. \n12  29.  Respondent Captain Davis Nighswonger is the commander of the Theo Lacy \n13  Facility, which is, according to its own website, the largest \"correctional institution\" \n14  in Orange County.  Nonetheless, Theo Lacy incarcerates a number of immigration \n15  detainees, including Angel Ayala.  Captain Nighswonger is a legal custodian ofMr. \n16  Ayala and other class members, and is sued in his official capacity. \n17  30.  Respondent Captain Mike Kreuger manages the operations of the James A. \n18  Musick Facility, another prison in Orange County.  According to its website, the \n19  Musick facility incarcerates \"pre-trial and sentenced\" inmates.  Nonetheless, upon \n20  information and belief, it also houses class members, none of whom are criminal \n21  detainees.  Mr. Kreuger is a legal custodian of those class members, and is sued in his \n22  official capacity. \n23  31.  Respondent Arthur Edwards is the Officer-in-Charge at the Santa Ana City Jail \n24  and therefore the highest-ranking ICE officer at the facility.  He is a legal custodian \n25  of a number of class members.  Mr. Edwards is sued in his official capacity. \n26  32.  Respondent Russell Davis is the Jail Administrator of the Santa Ana City Jail, \n27  whose stated goal is to fulfill the \"incarceration needs\" of the Santa Ana Police \n28  Department.  Nonetheless, the Santa Ana Jail incarcerates several dozen class \n8 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 11 of 34   Page ID\n #:1054\n1  members on any given day.  Therefore, Mr. Davis is a legal custodian of a number of \n2  class members, and is sued in his official capacity.4 \n3 \nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n4 \nAlejandro Rodriguez \n5 \n33.  Petitioner Alejandro Rodriguez was detained for over three years while he \n6 \nchallenged the government's efforts to deport him to Mexico, a country where he has \n7 \nnot lived since he was a baby. \n8 \n34.  Mr. Rodriguez came to this country in September 1979, when was one year old. \n9 \nHe became a lawful permanent resident on June 4, 1987, when he was nine years \n10 \n5 \nold.\n11 \n35.  On or about July 29, 1998, Mr. Rodriguez pled guilty to Unlawful Driving or \n12 \nTaking ofa Vehicle under section 10851(A) of the California Vehicle Code (CVC). \n13 \nFor this crime he was sentenced to two years.  Five years later, on or about October \n14 \n21, 2003, he pled no contest and was convicted of Possession of a Controlled \n15 \nSubstance under California Health and Safety Code section 11377(A), for which he \n16 \nreceived formal probation of 5 years under the conditions of California Prop 36.  He \n17 \nwas transferred to DHS custody after his arrest, on April 10, 2004.  He was detained \n18 \nfor over three years after that transfer, until the government released him shortly after \n19 \n20 \n4 The government has taken conflicting positions in detention litigation concerning \n21 \nwho the proper Respondent should be in habeas petitions challenging immigration \n22  detention.  Petitioners have sued every official who could constitute an appropriate \nrespondent under the different theories advanced by the government, as well as the \n23  officials who constitute the proper defendants for a complaint under Section 1331. \n24 \n5Mr. Rodriguez narrowly missed becoming a citizen due to events beyond his control. \n25  He would have gained automatic citizenship, through his father, ifhis parents had \n26  legally separated prior to his 18th birthday, or ifhe had been under the age of 18 at the \ntime of the enactment of the Child Citizenship Protection Act of 2000.  However, his \n27  parents formally separated shortly after he turned 18, and he was 23 by the time the \n28  Act passed.  See 8 U.S.C. 1431. \n9 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 12 of 34   Page ID\n #:1055\n1  the filing of the class certification motion in this case. \n2  36.  The government charged Mr. Rodriguez with being removable based on his \n3  drug offense on April 15,2004.  At his removal hearing, Mr. Rodriguez contested \n4  that his conviction rendered him removable, and argued in the alternative that he was \n5  eligible for relief from removal.6 \n6  37.  The government received a continuance to alter the charging documents in his \n7  case, after which it charged Mr. Rodriguez with being deportable on an additional \n8  ground based on his 1998 conviction for theft.  Subsequently, on July 21, 2004, an \n9  immigration judge ordered him removed, holding that both his dnlg offense and his \n10  theft offense rendered him removable.  The Judge held that the drug offense was a \n11  controlled substance offense triggering removal and that the theft conviction was an \n12  aggravated felony, triggering mandatory removal.7  The immigration judge ordered \n13  him deported to Mexico.  Mr. Rodriguez appealed that decision to the BIA. \n14  38.  On December 21,2004, the Board reversed the Judge's decision that the drug \n15  possession conviction rendered Mr. Rodriguez removable, but upheld the decision \n16 \n17  An ICE officer initially deemed him eligible for release on bond, and set the bond at \n6 \n18  $15,000.  However, Mr. Rodriguez was unable to afford the bond in that amount, and \nan immigration judge denied his request to lower the bond amount. Shortly after the \n19  BIA decided his case in 2004, the government revoked that bond order and ordered \n20  him detained without bond under the mandatory detention provision codified at 8 \nU.S.C. 1226(c). \n21 \n22  Although not charged in the immigration charging document, the government also \n7 \npresented evidence from court records that, on or about October 24,2003, a man using \n23  the name Alejandro Rodriguez (who also used another name as an alias) pled guilty to \n24  California Health and Safety Code section 11550(a), Under the Influence of a \nControlled Substance, and was sentenced to 120 days in jail, which he served during \n25 \nthe same time that Mr. Rodriguez was released and reporting to the court for his \n26  conviction of October 21, 2003.  The date of conviction makes it highly unlikely that \nMr. Rodriguez was in fact convicted of this offense.  Nonetheless, the IJ ruled that this \n27  conviction constituted a second drug offense, rendering Petitioner removable on the \n28  basis of the drug convictions. \n10 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 13 of 34   Page ID\n #:1056\n1  that his theft conviction was an aggravated felony. \n2  39.  On December 28,2004, Mr. Rodriguez timely petitioned for review of the \n3  Board's decision to the Ninth Circuit, arguing inter alia that his crime was not an \n4  aggravated felony as defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act.  Mr. Rodriguez \n5  then sought a stay of removal, which the government opposed.  Thereafter, the Ninth \n6  Circuit granted his request for a stay of removal, and therefore necessarily found that \n7  his case presents substantial legal claims.  See Maharaj v. Ashcroft, 295 F.3d 963, \n8  966 (9th Cir. 2002). \n9  40.  While Mr. Rodriguez's case was pending at the Ninth Circuit, that court decided \n10  another case holding that Mr. Rodriguez's theft conviction was not an aggravated \n11  felony.  The government then moved to hold his case in abeyance while it sought en \n12  banc review of that decision.  The Ninth Circuit granted the motion, even though he \n13  had already been detained for 15 months at that time.  After en banc review failed, \n14  the government sought Supreme Court review in the other case, and again requested \n15  that Mr. Rodriguez's case be held.  After the Supreme Court granted cert, his case \n16  was held still further.  In the end, his case was held in abeyance for over two years, \n17  but none of the decisions for which it was held established that he was subject to \n18  mandatory removal, as the immigration courts had found. \n19  41.  Eventually, the government largely conceded that Mr. Rodriguez's convictions \n20  did not subject him to mandatory removal, and it agreed to remand his case to the \n21  immigration courts on this basis.  His case is now back before an immigration judge, \n22  who will consider his (exceedingly strong) application for cancellation of removal in \n23  January 2011. \n24  42.  During the three years ofMr. Rodriguez's detention, the government never held \n25  a hearing as to whether his prolonged detention is justified.  In fact, the only process \n26  Mr. Rodriguez received with respect to his detention was what the government calls \n27  \"File Custody Reviews.\"  The first of these occurred on March 10,2005, when an \n28  ICE agent presumably read through his file and issued a \"Decision to Continue \n11 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 14 of 34   Page ID\n #:1057\n1  Detention.\"  No ICE official interviewed Mr. Rodriguez, let alone held a hearing, \n2  prior to making this decision.  Instead, ICE merely gave him a questionnaire to fill \n3  out, asking for information regarding family members, employment experience, and \n4  any outstanding probation requirements.  Although Mr. Rodriguez documented his \n5  work as a dental assistant and his extensive family ties, including his U.S. citizen \n6  father and sister, and his lawful permanent resident mother and brother, ICE denied \n7  his request for release, stating simply that he would remain detained until the Ninth \n8  Circuit rendered its decision.  The notice offered no further explanation for the \n9  decision to continue detention, made no mention of how long Mr. Rodriguez had \n10  been detained (eleven months at that time), and offered no suggestions as to what \n11  steps he might take to effect a different outcome in any future decisions. \n12  43.  In September 2005, ICE conducted another file custody review, which it \n13  apparently denied for similar reasons, and in March 2006 the process was repeated \n14  again.  In each of these instances, the government did not even provide Mr. \n15  Rodriguez with a written decision as to why he would remain incarcerated for many \n16  more months.  In March 2007 the government chose to continue Mr. Rodriguez's \n17  detention again.  At the time of that last custody decision he had been detained for \n18  nearly three years, yet the decision made no mention of this fact.  Instead, the \n19  decision asserted that continued detention was justified because the Ninth Circuit \n20  would decide his case soon, which was entirely incorrect. \n21  44.  Shortly after the original class complaint in this case was filed, the government \n22  released Mr. Rodriguez from detention, but continued to subject him to severe \n23  restraints on his liberty which remain in effect, including a requirement that he abide \n24  by a strict curfew and wear an electronic monitoring device at all times.  The \n25  government has continued to require that he abide by these restrictions, and has never \n26  afforded him a hearing before an immigration judge to determine if they are \n27  necessary to ensure his appearance at his final removal hearing, where he will likely \n28  be granted cancellation of removal. \n12 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 15 of 34   Page ID\n #:1058\n1  Abdirizak Aden Farah \n2  45.  Abdirizak Aden Farah is a Somali refugee who has been detained for over eight \n3  months at the Mira Lorna facility without any kind of hearing to determine whether \n4  his detention is justified. \n5  46.  Mr. Farah was born on May 5, 1987 in Kismayo, Somalia.  His family lived in \n6  Mogadishu for the early part of his childhood.  Thousands of refugees have fled \n7  Somalia since the country's civil war erupted approximately twenty years ago. \n8  Today, there is no functioning government in most of Somalia, and the country exists \n9  in a state of constant civil war and virtual anarchy.  The United Nations High \n10  Commission for Refugees issued guidelines in May 2010 largely advising against the \n11  return of anyone from central or southern Somalia, including even asylum seekers \n12  whose claims had been rejected.  With respect to the capital of Mogadishu (where \n13  Mr. Farah lived prior to suffering persecution), a Human Rights Watch researcher has \n14  stated that \"Mogadishu is one of the world's most dangerous places ... Returning \n15  people there is not just risky; it's a potential death sentence.\" \n16  47.  Mr. Farah first faced persecution in Somalia as a child, when his family was \n17  forced to flee Mogadishu because they were members of the minority Marehan clan \n18  who faced danger from members of the Hawiye, a powerful majority clan in Somalia. \n19  Eventually, the family was able to settle in Kismayo, a city in Somalia where the \n20  Hawiye were not powerful.  Several years later, his father was shot and killed by \n21  members of a Hawiye sub-clan when he returned briefly to Mogadishu to try to sell \n22  the family home. \n23  48.  Mr. Farah fled Somalia in April 2009 in order to escape the al-Shabaab, a \n24  militant Islamic organization that is trying to take over Somalia. A1-Shabaab militants \n25  shot and killed his brother Mohamed because he worked as a driver for the Somali \n26  Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in the summer of 2007. These same militants \n27  nearly killed Mr. Farah in the same attack by slashing his wrist with a lmife. \n28  Afterward, al-Shabaab members repeatedly accused him of working for the TFG and \n13 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 16 of 34   Page ID\n #:1059\n1  finally threatened to kill him ifhe did not join them. \n2  49.  After the last of these threats, Mr. Farah's uncle sent money for him to flee. \n3  With the assistance of several people, he arrived by a circuitous route at the southern \n4  border of the United States, where he presented himself at the border and requested \n5  asylum on or about December 31, 2009.  An asylum officer found his claim credible, \n6  and referred him for a full asylum hearing before an immigration judge. \n7  50.  Mr. Farah has had several hearings in his immigration case, the first of which \n8  took place in March 2010.  At several of these, the immigration judge continued his \n9  hearing because he did not have a lawyer, while others were cancelled because the \n10  judge or the translator were not present.  His next hearing is scheduled for late \n11  October 2010. \n12  51.  Mr. Farah has applied for release on parole under 8 C.F.R. 212(d)(5)(A).  Under \n13  these procedures, the decision whether or not to release him is made by a single \n14  officer, with no appeal process, and without providing a hearing of any kind.  An ICE \n15  officer denied him release without meaningful explanation. \n16  52.  Mr. Farah's wife and baby daughter remain in Somalia.  He has been unable to \n17  establish any contact with them because of his detention. \n18  Yussuf Abdikadir \n19 \n53.  Yussuf Abdikadir is also a Somalian refugee.  He has been detained by \n20 \nimmigration authorities since early March 2010, and also has not received a detention \n21 \nhearing of any kind. \n22  54.  Mr. Abdikadir was born on October 5, 1980.8  He lived with his family-\n23 \nincluding his parents and five siblings -- as a child in Mogadishu.  He is also a \n24 \nmember of a minority clan in Somalia. \n25 \n55.  In 1991, as the Somali political structure disintegrated, a militia associated with \n26 \na dominant clan, the Hawiye, attacked Mr. Abdikadir's family.  They killed his two \n27 \n28  Yussufis his given name, while Abdikadir is his father's given name. \n8 \n14 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 17 of 34   Page ID\n #:1060\n1  older brothers, his father, and his grandmother.  They also severely mistreated other \n2  members of the family, and raped his mother. \n3  56.  Mr. Abdikadir and his surviving family members then fled to Kenya, where \n4  they lived in various refugee camps for most of the next two decades.  He married \n5  Shulai Hussein, also a Somalian refugee, while in the camps, and the couple had \n6  three children.  (Ms. Hussein also has a son from a prior relationship, who is now Mr. \n7  Abdikadir's step-son). \n8  57.  Life in the refugee camps was very hard for Mr. Abdikadir and his family. \n9  Kenya granted them no permanent status, and as a result they were forced to live in \n10  the camps and denied the right to work.  At the same time, the Kenyan government \n11  and international agencies failed to provide sufficient food for the refugees.  He and \n12  his family would have to wait for hours during the heat of the day to obtain their \n13  small food rations, and often were mistreated by the Kenyan authorities while \n14  waiting.  Mr. Abdikadir occasionally worked illegally in order to supplement his \n15  family's meager provisions, but Kenyan authorities arrested and punished him for \n16  doing so.  The Kenyan authorities also did little if anything to stop the bandits who \n17  would raid the camps at night, raping camp residents and pillaging their belongings. \n18  58.  After life in the camps became too difficult, Mr. Abdikadir's mother managed \n19  to sell some land the family owned in Somalia, and used these proceeds to procure \n20  funds to allow her son to escape.  Unable to return to Somalia or survive further life \n21  in the Kenyan refugee camps, Mr. Abdikadir fled.  He traveled a circuitous route in \n22  search of a country with refugee protections, and ultimately arrived at the southern \n23  border of the United States seeking asylum. \n24  59.  At the border crossing from Tijuana he presented a birth certificate and applied \n25  for asylum, entering ICE detention in March 2010.  He was sent to Mira Lorna \n26  shortly afterward, and passed his credible fear interview several weeks later, in \n27  approximately April 2010. \n28  60.  Mr. Abdikadir has been before an immigration judge several times since then, \n15 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 18 of 34   Page ID\n #:1061\n1  but has yet to even submit an application for asylum, because he was unable to find a \n2  lawyer to represent him and speaks virtually no English. \n3  61.  Mr. Abdikadir has also applied for release on parole under 8 C.F .R. \n4  2l2(d)(5)(A).  As with Mr. Farah, the decision whether or not to release Mr. \n5  Abdikadir is made by a single officer, with no appeal process, and without a hearing \n6  of any kind.  Mr. Abdikadir requested release from this officer, and in doing so \n7  provided his birth certificate as well as a sworn affidavit from a friend of his who \n8  lives in San Diego and is willing to house and assist him.  Nonetheless, his parole \n9  request was denied.  The sole explanation provided was a check mark in a box next to \n10  a paragraph which states \"You have not established to ICE's satisfaction that you will \n11  appear as required for immigration hearings, enforcement appointments, or other \n12  matters, if you are paroled from detention.\"  Other than requesting a redetermination \n13  based on changed circumstances, Mr. Abdikadir has no recourse to any further \n14  process for appeal. \n15  62.  Mr. Abdikadir has suffered during his time in detention, not only because of the \n16  traumatic effects of detention in general on those who have suffered past persecution, \n17  but also because of his medical problems.  Mr. Abdikadir has some kind of problem \n18  concerning his eyes - perhaps tied to light sensitivity -- that causes them to be \n19  constantly red and irritated.  Although he has sought medical attention for this \n20  problem at the Mira Lorna Detention Center, the clinic there has not provided him \n21  with any medication that has addressed the problem. \n22  63.  Mr. Abdikadir has been unable to communicate with his family while in \n23  detention.  He awaits the opportunity to win his release and his status, so that he can \n24  begin to recover from the years of suffering he has faced, and also so that he can \n25  speak with and hopefully some day re-unite with his wife and children.  Given that he \n26  has not even submitted an asylum application yet, he will remain incarcerated \n27  without a hearing for months more absent this Court's intervention. \n28 \n16 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 19 of 34   Page ID\n #:1062\n1  Abel Perez Ruelas \n2  64.  Abel Perez Ruelas is a citizen of Mexico. He has been in immigration detention \n3  at Mira Lorna Detention Center for 17 months, since April 8, 2009. \n4  65.  Mr. Perez Ruelas was born on January 25, 1967 in Jalisco, Mexico. In 1996, he \n5  met Maria del Rosario, with whom he had a daughter, Azirit Lessandra, one year \n6  later. \n7  66.  He was admitted to the United States in 2002 on a visitors' visa, two years after \n8  he broke up and lost contact with with Ms. del Rosario. \n9  67.  In approximately 2007, about five years after Mr. Perez-Ruelas came to live in \n10  the United States, he received a call from his mother, who told him that Ms. del \n11  Rosario had died in childbirth in Mexico, and that his daughter had been sent to live \n12  with her mother's parents.  Since then, Mr. Perez Ruelas has been living with the \n13  hope that one day he may bring his daughter to the United States to live with him. \n14  68.  On December 22,2008, Mr. Perez Ruelas married Maria Navichoque Perez, a \n15  U.S. citizen. She is a nurse at the Los Angeles Jewish Home, a non-profit senior \n16  living facility in Reseda, California.  The couple filed to adjust his status based on \n17  their marriage in approximately February 2009. \n18  69.  After his marriage, Mr. Perez Ruelas became the stepfather of Maria Perez's \n19  four children, all of whom are U.S. citizens by birth. The two youngest children, \n20  Hector and Emily, live with Mr. Perez Ruelas and his wife in their home in Reseda, \n21  California. \n22  70.  Mr. Perez Ruelas has lived and worked in the United States for almost eight \n23  years. He works in construction, primarily with cement and tiles.  Prior to his \n24  detention, he regularly attended church with his wife in Pacoima and Reseda. \n25  71.  Mr. Perez Ruelas has had three prior convictions for driving under the influence \n26  of alcohol, none for which he spent more than two months in jail. Mr. Perez Ruelas \n27  served three months of probation for his first offense in 1994; he served 10 days in \n28  jail for his second, a decade later in 2004; and he served 60 days in jail for his third, \n17 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 20 of 34   Page ID\n #:1063\n1  which occurred four years later.  Pursuant to his sentence for the last conviction, Mr. \n2  Perez Ruelas has diligently attended Alcoholics Anonymous for over a year, and has \n3  continued attending AA meetings even while in immigration detention. \n4  72.  On or about April 8, 2009, Mr. Perez Ruelas was released from jail for his last \n5  offense.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials immediately took him into \n6  immigration custody, notwithstanding his pending application to adjust his status \n7  based on his marriage.  At the time, Mr. Perez-Ruelas was in the process of becoming \n8  a lawful permanent resident of the United States. \n9  73.  Mr. Perez Ruelas was given a bond hearing on April 21, 2009, pursuant to 8 \n10  U.S.C. 1226(a), at which he bore the burden to prove that he was not a danger or \n11  flight risk.  Upon information and belief, the immigration judge lmew that Mr. Perez \n12  Ruelas was married to a U.S. citizen and that he had a pending adjustment \n13  application, but nonetheless the judge denied him release on bail.  He told Mr. Perez \n14  Ruelas that his prior DUI convictions made him a danger to society, even though his \n15  sentence had long since expired. \n16  74.  With the assistance of his attorney, Mr. Perez Ruelas applied for a bond \n17  reduction in February 2010. At that hearing, the immigration judge set a bond of \n18  $5,000, an amount too high for Mr. Perez Ruelas's family to pay. \n19  75.  Because he could not pay, Mr. Perez Ruelas remained in immigration detention \n20  - where he has been for the past 16 months awaiting adjudication of his case.  His \n21  last hearing was over four months ago, on April 15, 2010. \n22  76.  On July 30,2010, Mr. Perez Ruelas and his wife received notice that their \n23  application to adjust his status had been approved, with a priority date of March 22, \n24  2009.  Although he is entitled to adjust status immediately and will no doubt \n25  ultimately prevail in his immigration case, he nonetheless remains detained for no \n26  apparent reason, merely because under the stringent standard applied at his bond \n27  hearing he cannot pay the bond that the immigration judge set in his case. \n28 \n18 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 21 of 34   Page ID\n #:1064\n1  Jose Farias Cornejo \n2 \n77.  Jose Farias Cornejo is a citizen of Mexico and a lawful permanent resident of \n3  the United States. He has been in immigration detention at Mira Lorna Detention \n4 \nCenter for over eleven months, since September 14, 2009. \n5 \n78.  Mr. Farias Cornejo was born on August 14, 1984 in Michoacan, Mexico. He \n6 \nwas brought to the United States prior to his first birthday by his parents, who were \n7  migrant farm workers. He has never left this country, and speaks fluent English. \n8 \n79.  Mr. Farias Cornejo has four siblings. All four are U.S. citizens.  Mr. Farias \n9 \nCornejo's mother is also a lawful permanent resident of the United States. \n10 \n80.  Mr. Farias Cornejo spent his childhood years in Washington and his \n11  adolescence in California because his parents were migrant farm workers. He \n12 \nattended elementary school in San Diego for a few years before moving to Montclair, \n13 \nCalifornia to attend middle school and high school. He took special education classes \n14 \nat Montclair High School because of his diagnosed learning disability. \n15 \n81.  After graduating from high school, Mr. Farias Cornejo worked at various jobs \n16 \nnear his hometown in California, including in construction -- manufacturing jacuzzis \n17 \nand landscaping. \n18 \n82.  Mr. Farias Cornejo has had several prior convictions. In 2007, he was convicted \n19 \nof possession of methamphetamine and was given the opportunity to receive \n20 \nsubstance abuse treatment as an alternative to incarceration under California \n21 \nProposition 36.  Mr. Farias Cornejo diligently completed his drug treatment classes, \n22 \nbut because he could not afford to pay the mandatory fine, he was sentenced to 180 \n23 \ndays in jail. \n24 \n83.  Upon information and belief, in 2009 Mr. Farias Cornejo was convicted of a \n25 \nmisdelueanor California theft offense, for which he spent 14 days in jail.  In that \n26 \nsame year, he was convicted of being under the influence of a controlled substance, \n27 \nfor which he spent 60 days in jail. \n28 \n19 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 22 of 34   Page ID\n #:1065\n1  84.  Shortly after serving his last sentence, in September 2009, federal immigration \n2  officials initiated removal proceedings against him and placed him in immigration \n3  detention, citing their authority to mandatorily detain any individual with a prior \n4  controlled substance offense under 8 U.S.C. 1226(c). \n5  85.  Although the government contends that Mr. Farias Cornejo is subject to \n6  \"mandatory detention\" without a bond hearing under that provision, it has \n7  acknowledged that he is eligible for relief from removal in the form of cancellation of \n8  removal under 8 U.S.C. 1229b, because he has not been convicted of an \"aggravated \n9  felony.\" \n10  86.  Mr. Farias Cornejo was given a cancellation application on October of2009, \n11  but struggled to find an attorney to assist him in completing it.  After five months in \n12  detention, he finally found an attorney, but that attorney did not file his application. \n13  Eventually Mr. Farias Cornejo found a different attorney to represent him, in June of \n14  this year.  Through his new attorney Mr. Farias Cornejo finally filed his cancellation \n15  application, nearly ten months after he was placed into immigration detention. \n16  87.  Upon information and belief, at his cancellation hearing on August 17, 2010, \n17  the government stated that it had no objection to his application.  However, the \n18  immigration judge told Mr. Farias Cornejo that he had an outstanding warrant, and \n19  therefore refused to adjudicate the application.  Instead, the judge set his next court \n20  hearing for November 15,2010, apparently on the assumption that his warrant would \n21  be resolved prior to that time. \n22  88.  Although Mr. Farias Cornejo poses no flight risk, is not a danger to the \n23  community, and is eligible for relief from removal, he remains subject to continued \n24  detention. He has never had a hearing to determine whether his detention remains \n25  justified even though he has now been incarcerated for nearly a year. \n26  Angel Armando Ayala \n27 \n89.  Angel Armando Ayala is a citizen ofEl Salvador who was born on August 20, \n28 \n1976.  He carne to the United States with his family at the age of eleven and has \n20 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 23 of 34   Page ID\n #:1066\n1  never left.  He attended junior high and high school in Southern California. \n2  90.  Prior to his arrest by immigration authorities, Mr. Ayala lived with his mother, \n3  Maria, who is a United States citizen, and was also frequently in touch with his \n4  brother and sister, both of whom live in Southern California.  (He also has an older \n5  brother who lives in EI Salvador). \n6  91.  Mr. Ayala has worked in the United States his entire adult life, engaging in a \n7  variety of construction-related jobs including forklift driving, materials handling, \n8  landscaping, and in shipping and receiving. \n9  92.  Immigration officials arrested Mr. Ayala in what apparently was a worksite raid \nlOin approximately 1994.  At that time, government officials detained him at the San \n11  Pedro Detention facility.  He eventually had a hearing before an immigration judge \n12  who ordered him released on bond because he was eligible for relief under the \n13  Nicaraguan and Cuban Adjustment Relief Act (\"NACARA\").  The judge instructed \n14  him to find a lawyer to help him apply. \n15  93.  Shortly afterward, when Mr. Ayala went to the federal immigration building, he \n16  met a man acting as an attorney named Jose Quinones.  Mr. Quinones offered to file \n17  Mr. Ayala's NACARA application for a fee. \n18  94.  Mr. Quinones eventually filed the application, which was based on Mr. Ayala's \n19  mother's eligibility for NACARA.  A hearing on the application was set for October \n20  29, 1999. \n21  95.  Shortly before the hearing, Mr. Ayala's mother became seriously ill.  Because \n22  he had to take his mother to the hospital and attend to her, Mr. Ayala could not attend \n23  the court hearing.  At the hearing, the immigration judge ordered him removed in \n24  absentia, notwithstanding the fact that he was prima facie eligible for NACARA \n25  relief. \n26  96.  A few days after the hearing, after his mother's condition had stabilized, Mr. \n27  Ayala called Mr. Quinones to discuss his immigration case.  Mr. Quinones stated that \n28  the case now had to be re-opened, and that he would charge Mr. Ayala several \n21 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 24 of 34   Page ID\n #:1067\n1  thousand dollars to do this.  When Mr. Ayala stated that he did not have such funds \n2  available, Mr. Quinones told him to contact him when he had saved up the money. \n3  He did not mention that Mr. Ayala had to file the motion within 180 days, as is \n4  required, or that he could be deported if he did not file the motion. \n5  97.  Several years later, Mr. Quinones was suspended from practicing before the \n6  immigration courts by the Executive Office of Immigration Review.  If he ever was a \n7  licensed attorney, he has presumably been disbarred. \n8  98.  Mr. Ayala continued to live and work in the United States for the ensuing \n9  decade.  Upon information and belief, he received several misdemeanor convictions \n10  for driving without a license during this time, but was not convicted of any other \n11  offense. \n12  99.  On February 14,2009, immigration authorities arrested Mr. Ayala at his home \n13  in Pomona, which he shares with his mother, based on his outstanding removal order \n14  from ten years earlier.  They transferred him to the Mira Lorna Detention Center. \n15  100.  With the assistance of non-profit legal service provider Catholic Charities, Mr. \n16  Ayala filed a motion to reopen his case based on ineffective assistance of counsel. \n17  However, the immigration judge denied the motion, and the BIA affirmed the \n18  decision, asserting that the motion was untimely and not subject to tolling based on \n19  ineffective assistance.  According to the Board, the attorney had no duty to inform \n20  Mr. Ayala of the filing deadline for the motion to reopen because the attorney never \n21  agreed to represent him with respect to the motion.  Thus, the Board declined to \n22  reopen his case, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Ayala is eligible for NACARA \n23  relief.9 \n24  101.  Mr. Ayala subsequently hired attorney Shan Potts, who now represents him \n25  before the Ninth Circuit.  The Ninth Circuit granted Mr. Ayala a stay of removal, but \n26 \nUpon information and belief, Mr. Ayala has one misdemeanor conviction for drug \n9 \n27  possession from approximately 1996 and several convictions for driving without a \n28  license.  None of these render him ineligible for NACARA. \n22 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 25 of 34   Page ID\n #:1068\n1  briefing has not yet begun in his petition for review of the BIA's decision.  His case \n2  will likely take well over a year to decide at the Ninth Circuit, given the court's \n3  substantial case backlog. \n4  102.  Mr. Ayala's incarceration has worked a great hardship on his U.S.-citizen \n5  mother, with whom he lived prior to his arrest.  She has had difficulty paying rent for \n6  the apartment they shared, and also has suffered from the absence of his emotional \n7  support. \n8 \nCLASS-WIDE ALLEGATIONS \n9 \n103.  Petitioners are amongst approximately at least 350 detainees, ifnot more, in the \n10 \nCentral District on any given day whom the government has incarcerated for more \n11 \nthan six months without proving at an adequate hearing that their prolonged detention \n12 \nis justified.  Indeed, it is the government's policy or practice to detain non-citizens \n10 \n13 \nunder the general immigration detention statutes for prolonged periods of time \n14 \npending completion of their removal proceedings without providing them with such \n15 \nhearings. \n16 \n104.  In response, Petitioners bring this action on behalf of themselves and all other \n17 \npersons similarly-situated, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and \n18 \n23(b )(2), or in the alternative, as a representative action pursuant to a procedure \n19 \nanalogous to that provided in Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2).  See Rodriguez v. Hayes, 578 \n20 \nF.3d 1032,1047 (9th Cir. 2009) (allowing this case to proceed as a class action \n21 \n22  This Court ordered the government to produce a \"snapshot\" list of all class \n10 \nmembers on a particulate date, which the government produced for the date of April \n23  21,2010.  As of that day, there were 352 class members - people incarcerated in ICE \n24  custody in the Central District who had been in ICE custody for at least 180 days, and \nwhose cases remained pending either before the immigration courts or before the \n25  federal courts with a stay of removal in effect.  The list also included a number of \n26  people who were not class members because they were not incarcerated in detention \ncenters at all, but rather in juvenile facilities, and also two people who were not class \n27  members because they were had final removal orders with no stay of removal in \n28  effect. \n23 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 26 of 34   Page ID\n #:1069\n1  habeas petition). \n2  105.  Petitioners represent a class of all people within the Central District of \n3  California who 1) are or will be detained for longer than six months pursuant to the \n4  general immigration detention statutes pending completion of removal proceedings, \n5  including judicial review, 2) are not detained pursuant to one of the national security \n6  detention statutes at 8 U.S.C. 1226a and 8 U.S.C. 1531-37 and 3) have not been \n7  afforded a hearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is justified. \n8  106.  The class includes people who were present in an ICE detention facility in the \n9  Central District on or after the date on which the original complaint was filed as long \n10  as they had been detained by ICE for more than six months at that time, even if they \n11  are no longer in the Central District; it therefore includes people subject to the mass \n12  transfer of detainees from the San Pedro Detention Facility in October 2007, as long \n13  as those people remain in an ICE detention facility somewhere and their cases remain \n14  pending. \n15  107.  The class excludes people who have a final order of removal and no stay of that \n16  removal order, such that the government has legal authority to remove them. \n17  108.  The class excludes juveniles who are held under the care of the Office of \n18  Refugee Resettlement.  It also excludes people imprisoned pursuant to a criminal \n19  sentence, including individuals who complete removal proceedings and any judicial \n20  review while serving such sentences. \n21  109.  Pursuant to this Court's directive that the parties propose sub-classes, \n22  Petitioners propose that the Court also certify four sub-classes in this action, \n23  corresponding to each of the general detention statutes.  Petitioners propose to \n24  represent a sub-class of class members detained under 8 U.S.C. 1225(b) represented \n25  by Mr. Farah and Mr. Abdikadir, a sub-class of class members detained under 8 \n26  U.S.C. 1226(a) represented by Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Perez Ruelas, a sub-class of \n27  class members detained under 8 U.S.C. 1226(c) represented by Mr. Farias Cornejo, \n28  and a sub-class of class members detained under 8 U.S.C. 1231(a) represented by Mr. \n24 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 27 of 34   Page ID\n #:1070\n1  Ayala. \n2  110.  For each putative sub-class and each detention statute, Petitioners' counsel \n3  estimates that there will be far more than forty other sub-class members in this \n4  District who, like each of the Petitioners, have been detained for more than six \n5  months, are detained under that particular general detention statute, and have not \n6  been afforded a constitutionally-adequate hearing to determine whether their \n7  prolonged detention is justified.  Indeed, there may well be more than forty members \n8  of each sub-class detained in the Central District on any given single day. \n9  111.  The proposed class and sub-classes meet the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. \n10  23(a)(2).  For the class as a whole, there are several common questions of law and \n11  fact in the action.  These include 1) whether the government has a policy or general \n12  practice of detaining non-citizens in removal proceedings for longer than six months \n13  under the general immigration detention statutes without providing an adequate \n14  hearing to determine whether such prolonged detention is justified, 2) whether any \n15  general immigration detention statute authorizes this detention policy or practice, and \n16  3) whether this detention policy or practice violates the Due Process Clause. \n17  Rodriguez, 578 FJd at 1048-49 (finding common questions). \n18  112.  There are additional common questions of law that pertain to each subclass. \n19  These include: for Subclass 1, whether 8 U.S.C. 1225(b) authorizes the policy or \n20  general practice of detaining non-citizens in removal proceedings for longer than six \n21  months without providing a hearing where the government must establish that such \n22  detention is justified; for Subclass 2, whether 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) authorizes this \n23  detention policy or practice; for Subclass 3, whether 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) authorizes \n24  this detention policy or practice; and for Subclass 4 whether § 1231(a) authorizes this \n25  detention policy or practice. \n26  113.  The claims of the named representative Petitioners are typical of the claims of \n27  each proposed sub-class and of the class as a whole.  Like all of the proposed class \n28  members, the named Petitioners will have been detained, pursuant to the \n25 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 28 of 34   Page ID\n #:1071\n1  government's policy and practice, for at least six months under the relevant general \n2  immigration detention statutes, without having been afforded an adequate hearing \n3  where the government has shown that their prolonged detention is justified. \n4  Rodriguez, 578 FJd at 1048-50. \n5  114.  The named Petitioners will fairly and adequately represent the interests of all \n6  members of the proposed class and sub-classes because they seek relief identical to \n7  the relief sought by all class members, and because they have no interests adverse to \n8  other class members.  Moreover, the named Petitioners are represented by pro bono \n9  counsel from the ACLU of Southern California, the ACLU Immigrants' Rights \n10  Project, the Stanford Law School Immigrants' Rights Clinic, and the law firm of \n11  Sidley Austin LLP.  These organizations and the attorneys working for them have \n12  extensive experience litigating on behalf of detained immigrants and broad \n13  experience litigating class actions.  Rodriguez, 578 F .3d at 1050. \n14  115.  Respondents have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class and to \n15  each subclass through their policy and practice of detaining non-citizens in removal \n16  proceedings for longer than six months under each of the general immigration \n17  detention statutes without providing an adequate hearing where the government has \n18  shown that their prolonged detention is justified, making class-wide declaratory and \n19  injunctive relief appropriate. \n20 \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \n21 \n116.  Petitioners argue that the government may not detain them for longer than six \n22 \nmonths without showing at an adequate hearing that their prolonged detention is \n23 \njustified.  Peititioners make this argument on both statutory and constitutional \n24 \ngrounds. \n25 \n117.  With respect to the statute, Petitioners argue that because their removal \n26 \nproceedings have exceeded an \"expeditious\" period, the general detention statutes \n27 \nunder which they are detained must be construed to require an individualized hearing \n28 \n26 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 29 of 34   Page ID\n #:1072\n1  as to whether or not their detention is justified.  Several decisions have already \n2  construed these statutes to authorize only reasonable detention, and to require \n3  individualized hearings to ensure that detention under them remains reasonable.  See \n4  generally Nadarajah v. Gonzales, 443 F.3d 1069, 1078-79 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding \n5  that because 8 U.S.C. 1225(b) is one of \"the general immigration detention statutes\" \n6  it authorizes detention only for a \"brief and reasonable\" period of time necessary to \n7  complete removal proceedings, presumptively six months); Tijani v. Willis, 430 F.3d \n8  1241 (9th Cir. 2005) (construing 8 U.S.C. 1226(c) to require mandatory detention \n9  only in cases of \"expeditious\" removal proceedings, and ordering a hearing to \n10  determine whether detention is justified); Casas-Castrillon v. Dep't of Homeland \n11  Sec., 535 F.3d 942, 950 (9th Cir. 2008) (construing general detention statutes to \n12  require bond hearings where government bears burden of proof to validate prolonged \n13  detention).  Because none of the general detention statutes explicitly authorize \n14  prolonged detention without individualized hearings, they must all be construed to \n15  require such hearings to ensure that detention remains reasonable. \n16  118.  In the alternative, Petitioners argue that their prolonged detention without an \n17  adequate hearing to determine whether detention is justified violates the Due Process \n18  Clause.  \"Freedom from imprisonment -- from government custody, detention, or \n19  other forms of physical restraint --lies at the heart of the liberty that [the Due \n20  Process] Clause protects.\"  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690.  For this reason, detention \n21  must always be reasonable in relation to its purpose.  Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. \n22  715, 738 (1972).  See also Demore, 538 U.S. at 527-29 (applying \"reasonable \n23  relation\" test). \n24  119.  In the immigration context, the primary purpose of detention is to effect the \n25  alien's deportation in the event that removal proceedings are finally concluded in the \n26  government's favor.  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 699 (holding that the \"statute's basic \n27  purpose\" is \"to assure the alien's presence at the moment of removal\"); Demore, 538 \n28  U.S. at 528 (upholding brief mandatory detention pending completion of removal \n27 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 30 of 34   Page ID\n #:1073\n1  proceedings because it \"serves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens \n2  from fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings.\"). \n3  120.  Because Petitioners and other class members suffer lengthy civil detention, they \n4  must be afforded rigorous procedures to ensure that their detention remains justified. \n5  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690-92 (noting \"serious\" constitutional problem with \n6  prolonged and indefinite civil detention unless \"limited to specially dangerous \n7  individuals and subject to strong procedural protections\") (emphasis added); Casas-\n8  Castrillon, 535 F.3d at 950 (holding that \"prolonged detention without adequate \n9  procedural protections would raise serious constitutional concerns\" and therefore that \n10  \"due process requires adequate procedural protections to ensure that the government's \n11  asserted justification for physical confinement outweighs the individual's \n12  constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint.\") (citing Zadyydas). \n13  121.  With respect to what procedures are required for a hearing to be adequate to \n14  justify prolonged detention for both statutory and constitutional purposes, the \n15  government must at a minimum provide advance notice to the detainee and then \n16  provide a transcribed hearing before an immigration judge where it bears the burden \n17  to show by \"clear and convincing\" evidence that \"no conditions of release\" are \n18  sufficient to protect the government's interests in preventing flight and danger.  See \n19  Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U.S. 348, 363 (1996) (\"due process places a heightened \n20  burden of proof on the State in civil proceedings in which the individual interests at \n21  stake ... are both particularly important and more substantial than mere loss of \n22  money.\") (internal quotations omitted); Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71 (1992) \n23  (requiring \"clear and convincing evidence\" for commitment of insanity acquittee \n24  beyond length ofperrnissible sentence); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 750 \n25  (1987) (recognizing that the \"no conditions of release\" standard strikes appropriate \n26  balance of interests).  In addition, a showing ofparticularly serious danger is required \n27  - given that detention may last for years -- and a detainee's criminal history alone is \n28  insufficient to make that showing.  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690-91 (\"we have upheld \n28 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 31 of 34   Page ID\n #:1074\n1  preventive detention based on dangerousness only when limited to specially \n2  dangerous individuals and subject to strong procedural protections\").  Perhaps most \n3  important, the hearing must require a heightened showing based on the length of \n4  detention at issue.  Where a detainee has been detained for a long period of time and \n5  proceedings may not end in a brief time, the government must make more of a \n6  showing to justify the detention at issue.  United States v. Accetturo, 783 F.2d 382, \n7  388 (3d Cir. 1986) (stating in pre-trial detention context that \"[i]n some cases, the \n8  evidence admitted at the initial detention hearing, evaluated against the background \n9  of the duration of pretrial incarceration and the causes of that duration, may no longer \n10  justify detention.\"); Tijani v. Willis, 430 F. 3d 1241,1242 (9th Cir. 2005) (ordering \n11  bond hearing where government bore burden of proof in part because the \"forseeable \n12  process [for resolution of Petitioner's removal case] in this Court\" was \"a year of \n13  more\"). \n11 \n14  122.  In addition, any unrepresented detainee would have to be afforded counsel at \n15  the government's expense at a hearing where prolonged detention was at stake.  See \n16  Lassiter v. Dept of Soc. Serv., 452 U.S. 18,25 (1981) (noting that \"it is the \n17  defendant's interest in personal freedom, and not simply the special Sixth and \n18  Fourteenth Amendments right to counsel in criminal cases, which triggers the right to \n19  appointed counsel\"). \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23  This Court ordered hearings that largely comported with these requirements when it \n11 \n24  granted preliminary injunctions for four individual prolonged detainees in litigation \nclosely related to this case.  See, e.g., Order Granting Motion for Preliminary \n25  Injunction, Martinez v. Gonzales, CV06-7609 (C.D. Cal. January 4,2007) (ordering \n26  government to release detainee unless \"the government shows by clear and convincing \nevidence that he is a sufficient danger or risk of flight to justify his detention in light \n27  of how long he has been detained already and the likelihood of his case being finally \n28  resolved in favor of the government in the reasonably foreseeable future.\"). \n29 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 32 of 34   Page ID\n #:1075\n1  123.  Absent the provision of such hearings, the government's detention of \n2  Petitioners and other class members violates both the immigration statutes and the \n3  Due Process Clause. \n4 \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n5 \nViolation of Immigration and Nationality Act and Regulations \n6 \n7  124.  Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \n8  contained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n9  125.  Respondents' continued detention of Petitioners and other putative class \n10  members under the general immigration detention statutes violates the Immigration \n11  and Nationality Act, insofar as the statutes under which they are detained do not \n12  authorize detention for a prolonged period of time absent an adequate hearing at \n13  which the government shows that their detention remains justified. \n14 \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n15 \n16  Violation of Fifth Amendment Due Process (Right to a Constitutionally Adequate \n17  Custody Hearing) \n18  126.  Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \n19  contained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n20  127.  Respondents' continued detention of Petitioners and other class members \n21  without an adequate hearing where the government shows that their prolonged \n22  detention remains justified violates the right to be free of prolonged non-criminal \n23  detention without adequate justification and sufficient procedural safeguards, as \n24  guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \n25  Constitution. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n30 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 111    Filed 10/22/10   Page 33 of 34   Page ID\n #:1076\n1  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n2  WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully request that the Court grant the \n3 \nfollowing relief: \n4 \na.

Petland, Inc., 2010 WL\n4627893 (D. Kan. Nov. 3, 2010).  With re spect to the first factor, while nothing\ncontained in respondents’ motion for review persuades the Court that its ruling was\nclearly erroneous or contrary to law, it is possible that Judge Hatter will disagree.  With\nrespect to the second factor, the Court finds that respondents would suffer irreparable\nharm if they have to expend time and energy producing documents that the District Judge\nultimately concludes should not have been ordered produced.  With respect to the third\nfactor, the Court is not convinced that the limited stay sought by respondents, pending\nJudge Hatter’s ruling on their motion for review set for hearing on June 6, 2011, will\nsubstantially injure petitioners.

ROBBINS, et al.,\n16 Respondents.\n17\n18\n19 Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636, the Court has reviewed Petitioners’ motion for\n20 review of the Magistrate Judge’s order, together with moving and opposing papers,\n21 and the records on file. \n22 In the underlying class action, Petitioners challenge the constitutionality and\n23 legality of detaining immigrants in the Central District of California, pursuant to 8\n24 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b), 1226(a), 1226(c), 1231(a), for more than six months without a\n25 bond hearing.  Petitioners seek a writ of habeas corpus and request injunctive and\n26 declaratory relief providing an individual bond hearing for each class member.  On\nOrder – Page 1 of 9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 210    Filed 05/03/12   Page 2 of 9   Page ID #:2845\n1 April 5, 2010, the Court certified the class, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23(b)(2),\n2 and divided it into four subclasses of detainees, corresponding to each of the four\n3 immigration statutes at issue.\n4 Since  class  certification,  Petitioners  and  Respondents  have  disputed  the\n5 relevance and privileged nature of Petitioners’ discovery requests.  Petitioners seek\n6 production of specified information from the Department of Homeland Security’s\n7 [“DHS”] Administrative Files [“A-Files”], for every individual who would have met\n8 the class definition, starting from April 21, 2010.  This encompasses an estimated\n9 one thousand non-citizens.  From the A-Files, Petitioners seek: 1.  Documents\n10 exchanged between a class member and the federal courts, or the Department of\n11 Justice [“DOJ”], or the DHS (including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and\n12 Customs and Border Protection [“CBP”]), or the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration\n13 Services; 2. Post order custody review [“POCR”] worksheets concerning current\n14 and  former  class  members;  and  3.  Transcripts  of  any  statements  given  by  a\n“detainee” to the DOJ or DHS officials, such as transcripts of removal hearings or\n15\nCBP interviews. \n16\nWith respect to the parties’ relevance dispute, on July 29, 2011, the Court\n17\naffirmed the Magistrate Judge’s ruling that the requested information was relevant\n18\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 26(b).  Now, the parties dispute whether six statutory\n19\nconfidentiality provisions preclude judicial discovery.  The provisions govern the\n20\ndisclosure of immigrant applications for: Asylum, 8 C.F.R. § 208.6; Citizenship\n21\nunder the Violence Against Women Act [“VAWA”] and for “T” and “U” visas, 8\n22\nU.S.C. § 1367 [“VAWA, T & U”]; Battered spouse and children, 8 C.F.R. §\n23\n216.5(e)(3)(viii); Legalization, 8 U.S.C. § 1255a(c)(4)-(5); Special agricultural\n24\nworkers [“SAW”] 8 U.S.C. § 1160(b)(5)-(6); and Temporary protected status\n25\n[“TPS”], 8 C.F.R. § 244.16.  \n26\nOrder – Page 2 of 9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 210    Filed 05/03/12   Page 3 of 9   Page ID #:2846\n1 Petitioners have moved to compel production of the requested information\n2 while Respondents moved for a protective order.  On July 25, 2011, the Magistrate\n3 Judge granted and denied portions of each parties’ motion.  On August 15, 2011, on\n4 motion for reconsideration,  the Magistrate Judge confirmed and clarified the July\n5 25, 2011 ruling.  On August 29, 2011, Petitioners timely moved the Court to review\n6 the Magistrate Judge’s August 15, 2011 order, which encompasses the July 25, 2011\n7 order.\n8 Between the two orders at issue, the Magistrate Judge interpreted the asylum\n9 and VAWA, T & U provisions to mean the following:  The asylum provision\n10 precludes judicial discovery of information regarding the asylum application and any\n11 credible fear determination, unless the applicant provides his or her written consent. \n12 The VAWA, T & U provision precludes judicial discovery into an immigrant’s\n13 entire A-File if he or she applied for relief under the VAWA or for a “T” or “U”\n14 visa.  However, Petitioners may obtain such A-Files if:   The application was denied\non the merits and the immigrant exhausted all opportunities for appeal of the denial;\n15\nor The immigrant provided Petitioners with written consent.  The Magistrate Judge\n16\nbased the rulings on the statutory language of the respective provisions.\n17\nThe  Magistrate  Judge,  also,  interpreted  the  remaining  four  disputed\n18\nconfidentiality provisions to allow judicial discovery of applications for battered\n19\nspouse and children, legalization, SAW, and TPS, for class members currently\n20\ndetained, but not for former class members.  Disclosure of former class member\n21\ninformation would require written consent.  The Magistrate Judge did not state the\n22\nreason for distinguishing between current and former class members.\n23\nDistrict courts review a magistrate judge’s discovery order to determine if it\n24\nis “clearly erroneous or contrary to law.” United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667,\n25\n673-76, 100 S. Ct. 2406, 2411, 65 L. Ed. 2d 424, 431 (1980).\n26\nOrder – Page 3 of 9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 210    Filed 05/03/12   Page 4 of 9   Page ID #:2847\n1 The parties raise two issues with the Magistrate Judge’s orders that concern\n2 the interpretation of the statutory confidentiality provisions:  1. Whether the asylum\n3 and VAWA, T & U provisions preclude court-ordered judicial discovery; and 2.\n4 Whether the battered spouse and children, SAW, legalization, and TPS provisions\n5 preclude court-ordered judicial discovery of former class member information.  \n6 The asylum and VAWA, T & U confidentiality provisions do not foreclose\n7 court ordered discovery.  In general, Congress has used three forms of statutory\n8 confidentiality provisions:  Those that expressly bar disclosure in legal proceedings;\n9 Those that expressly allow disclosure in legal proceedings; and Those that are silent\n10 in this regard.  Zambrano v. I.N.S., 972 F.2d 112, 1125 (1992), overruled on other\n11 grounds in I.N.S. v. Zambrano, 509 U.S. 918, 113 S. Ct. 3028, 125 L. Ed. 2d 717,\n12 717-18 (1993).  The asylum provision falls somewhere between the second and third\n13 category, while the VAWA, T & U provision falls into the third category.\n14 Courts have a “duty to avoid a construction that would suppress otherwise\ncompetent evidence unless the statute, strictly construed, requires such a result.” \n15\nSt. Regis Paper Co. v. United States, 368 U.S. 208, 218, 82 S. Ct. 289, 295, 7 L.\n16\nEd. 2d 240, 248 (1961).  Thus, statutory provisions, generally forbidding disclosure\n17\nof information, do not bar judicial discovery absent an explicit prohibition against\n18\nsuch disclosure.  St. Regis Paper Co., 368 U.S. at 218, 82 S. Ct. at 295, 7 L. Ed.\n19\n2d at 248.  The asylum and VAWA, T & U provisions do not contain such an\n20\nexpress limitation.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.6; 8 U.S.C. § 1367. \n21\nAlthough no appellate court has addressed whether the asylum and VAWA,\n22\nT & U provisions prohibit a court from ordering discovery, the Ninth Circuit applied\n23\nthe  rule  established  in  St.  Regis  Paper  Co.,  368  U.S.  208  to  the  statutory\n24\nconfidentiality provision governing an immigrant’s application for legalization. \n25\nZambrano, 972 F.2d 112 (interpreting 8 U.S.C. § 1255a(c)(4)-(5)).  The court held\n26\nOrder – Page 4 of 9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 210    Filed 05/03/12   Page 5 of 9   Page ID #:2848\n1 that the provision did not prohibit judicial discovery because it lacked an explicit\n2 command so stating.  Zambrano, 972 F.2d at 1125-26.  The court further reasoned\n3 that disclosure facilitated, rather than frustrated, the statutory purpose to protect the\n4 interest of immigrants applying for legalization.  Zambrano, 972 F.2d at 1124-25. \n5 Congress intended the confidentiality provision to encourage aliens to apply for\n6 legalization by assuaging their fears that the government would use their information\n7 to deport them.  Zambrano, 972 F.2d at 1125.  In Zambrano, disclosure to class\n8 counsel was intended to protect and benefit the same group of people.  Zambrano,\n9 972 F.2d at 1124. \n10 In this case, disclosure furthers the purpose of the statutory provisions, while\n11 withholding the requested information undermines it.  Just as in Zambrano, 972 F.2d\n12 112, disclosure of class member information to class counsel, here, protects and\n13 benefits the same group of people that Congress intended to protect and benefit.  As\n14 the Fourth Circuit noted, Congress designed the asylum provision to prevent foreign\ngovernment  authorities  and  non-state  actors  from  retaliating  against  asylum\n15\napplicants and their families.  Anim v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d 243, 253 (4th Cir. 2008). \n16\nThe VAWA and “T” and “U” visas grant victims of domestic violence, certain\n17\nserious crimes, and human trafficking, legal status to remain in the United States. \n18\n8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(51), 1101(a)(15)(U), 1101(a)(15)(T).  Congress intended the\n19\nconfidentiality provision to prevent disclosure of an applicant’s information to the\n20\npersons who victimized the applicant.  Hawke v. United States Dep’t of Homeland\n21\nSec., 2008 WL 4460241, at *7 (N.D. Cal. 2008)(Whyte, J.); see 151 Cong. Rec.\n22\nE2605, E2607 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2005).  Neither provision was intended to shield\n23\nthe government from inquiry into its mistreatment of applicant-immigrants.  See\n24\nAnim, 535 F.3d at 253; Hawke, 2008 WL 4460241, at *7.  A special danger lurks\n25\nbehind allowing the government to define the scope of a privilege when it serves to\n26\nOrder – Page 5 of 9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 210    Filed 05/03/12   Page 6 of 9   Page ID #:2849\n1 hide the government’s misconduct.\n2 Not  only  does  the  asylum  provision  fail  to  explicitly  prohibit  judicial\n3 discovery, such court ordered disclosure squarely fits within one of its express\n4 exceptions.  8 C.F.R. § 208.6(c)(2)(ii) specifically allows disclosure in:  “any legal\n5 action ... [a]rising from the proceedings of which the asylum application ... is a\n6 part.”    The  asylum  application  “is  a  part”  of  the  detention  proceedings  that\n7 Petitioners challenge in this case.  The application and its supporting documents\n8 reveal the strength of the applicant’s claim against removal.  The merits of an\n9 asylum claim, also, weigh on the question of whether the government should release\n10 the applicant from detention while awaiting the determination of their removal.  That\n11 some applicants did not present evidence of the merits of their claim at a proceeding\n12 to argue their entitlement to release does not displace them from this exception.  The\n13 asylum applications still constitute “a part” of the immigration proceedings that\n14 Petitioners challenge here.\nRespondents point to no statutory language, legislative history, or case law to\n15\nsupport its position that Congress intended to limit subsection (ii) to proceedings in\n16\nwhich the confidential asylum information plays a “meaningful” role.  In effect,\n17\nRespondents wish to reduce subsection (ii) to nothing more than subsection (i).  If\n18\nthe  Court  humored  Respondents,  then  subsection  (ii)  would  be  completely\n19\nsuperfluous of subsection (i), which permits disclosure in a legal action, “[a]rising\n20\nfrom the adjudication of ... the asylum application.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.6(c)(2)(i). “It\n21\nis an elementary rule of construction that effect must be given, if possible, to every\n22\nword, clause and sentence of a statute.”  Spencer v. World Vision, Inc., 633 F.3d\n23\n723, 743 (9th Cir. 2011).  Congress intended subsection (ii) to encompass any legal\n24\naction arising from proceedings in which the asylum application merely constitutes\n25\nsome “part,” regardless of how active or meaningful the role it played.  8 C.F.R.\n26\nOrder – Page 6 of 9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 210    Filed 05/03/12   Page 7 of 9   Page ID #:2850\n1 § 208.6(c)(2)(ii).    Some one, or entity, need not actually litigate the merits of the\n2 application before a tribunal for it to be “part” of a “proceeding.” \n3 Nevertheless, the Court finds the information plays a significant role in these\n4 proceedings.  Not only does the information go directly to the due process inquiry\n5 before the Court, the protected documents, more often than not, constitute the only\n6 available source of information about a substantial number of class members. \n7 Asylum applicants compose a majority of the 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a) sub-class and\n8 about twenty five percent of all class members.  These applicants, generally, do not\n9 have any prior contact with immigration authorities and do not apply for other forms\n10 of relief. \n11 Similar to the asylum and VAWA, T & U provisions, the battered spouse and\n12 children, SAW, legalization, and TPS statutory confidentiality provisions do not\n13 foreclose  the  Court  from  compelling  Respondents  to  disclose  confidential\n14 information about former class members to Petitioners.  None of the confidentiality\nprovisions  at  issue  contain  an  express  prohibition  against  court-ordered  civil\n15\ndiscovery.  See 8 C.F.R. §§ 216.5(e)(3)(viii) (battered spouse and children), 244.16\n16\n(TPS); 8 U.S.C. §§ 1160(b)(5)-(6) (SAW), 1255a(c)(4)-(5) (legalization).  Thus, the\n17\nrequested  documents  are  not  privileged  so  as  to  preclude  class  counsel  from\n18\ndiscovering them.  See St. Regis Paper Co., 368 U.S. at 218, 82 S. Ct. at 295, 7 L.\n19\nEd. 2d at 248; Zambrano, 972 F.2d at 1125-26.\n20\nFurthermore, the structure of the case makes it impracticable to distinguish\n21\nbetween former and current class members at this stage in litigation.  Inevitably,\n22\nduring  the  litigation,  many,  if  not  all,  “current”  class  members  will  become\n23\n“former” class members.  By April 18, 2011, about one year prior to this date and\n24\none year after class certification, the government already released from custody sixty\n25\nfive percent of the class.  At this stage in the litigation, the distinction between\n26\nOrder – Page 7 of 9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 210    Filed 05/03/12   Page 8 of 9   Page ID #:2851\n1 current and former class members constitutes nothing more than a line drawn in the\n2 sand on a windy day.  The parties will needlessly expend resources attempting to\n3 separate scattered grains of sand, blowing about from one side of the line to the\n4 other, at much too early a stage in the litigation process for it to entail anything more\n5 than an utter waste of time and money for all involved. \n6 A  contrary  ruling  would  deprive  Petitioners  of  meaningful  discovery. \n7 Petitioners have almost no reasonable way of contacting former class members to\n8 obtain their written consent.  The sought-after information remains relevant even\n9 after the government releases a detainee.  See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 26(b).  Moreover,\n10 it would be inequitable for Respondents to retain the power to bury a file by simply\n11 releasing a detainee, changing his or her status from “current” to “former” class\n12 member.  \n13 In sum, the interpretation of the asylum and VAWA, T & U statutory\n14 confidentiality provisions, to preclude court ordered disclosure, constitutes clear\nerror.  It, also, constitutes clear error to distinguish between former and current\n15\nclass members, when it comes to Petitioners’ entitlement to discovery into persons\n16\nwho have met the class definition after certification, given the lack of a statutory\n17\nmandate against court-ordered judicial disclosure and the structure of this case.  A\n18\nprotective order from the Court, along with class counsel’s duty of confidentiality,\n19\nto current and former class members, will suffice to protect the confidentiality of\n20\ncurrent and former class members’ information.

The complexity is due, at least in part, to the fact\n25\nthat this case has ricocheted among this Court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and\n26\nthe United States Supreme Court.  \n27\nIn response to the instant motions, the Court has reviewed the entire record and,\n28\nOrder – Page 1 of 5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 555   Filed 05/28/20   Page 2 of 5   Page ID #:10538\n1 in particular, the orders issued by this Court, the Ninth Circuit, and the Supreme Court. \n2 Based on those orders, this case has been placed in a complicated, and unusual,\n3 procedural posture. \n4 The Court will, now, attempt to reconcile those orders so that this case can move\n5 forward toward a final resolution.  In reconciling those orders, the Court cannot\n6 overrule the orders issued by the Ninth Circuit or the Supreme Court.  Indeed, this\n7 Court is duty bound to respect, give meaning, reconcile and apply the orders of those\n8 higher courts. \n9 Initially, the Court denied Petitioners’ motion for class certification as to their\n10 statutory claims.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, noting that certification would be proper\n11 if the class were divided into subclasses.  See Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105 (9th\n12 Cir. 2010) [“Rodriguez I”].  On March 8, 2011, in light of Rodriguez I, this Court\n13 certified the class action and defined the class as “all non-citizens within the Central\n14 District of California who: (1) Are or will be detained for longer than six months\n15 pursuant to the general immigration detention statutes pending completion of removal\n16 proceedings, including judicial review; (2) Are not detained pursuant to a national\n17 security detention statute...; and (3) Have not been afforded a hearing to determine\n18 whether their prolonged detention is justified.”  The Court certified four subclasses;\n19 class members were divided into subclasses based on which immigration statute they\n20 were detained under – 18 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b), 1226(a), 1226(c), and 1231(a).   \n21 Petitioners, then, sought a preliminary injunction, which this Court granted, and\n22 the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  See Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127 (9th Cir. 2013)\n23 [“Rodriguez II”].  Petitioners, then, moved for summary judgment and sought a\n24 permanent injunction, which this Court granted, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part\n25 and reversed in part.  See Rodriguez v. Robbins, 804 F.3d 1060 (9th Cir. 2015)\n26 [“Rodriguez III”].  The Ninth Circuit held that summary judgment and the permanent\n27 injunction  were  warranted  as  to  three  of  Petitioner’s  statutory  claims  and  the\n28 corresponding subclasses, but reversed as to Petitioners’ 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a) claim and\nOrder – Page 2 of 5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 555   Filed 05/28/20   Page 3 of 5   Page ID #:10539\n1 the corresponding subclass.  See Rodriguez III, 804 F.3d at 1090.  The Government,\n2 then, sought a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court, which was granted.  The\n3 Supreme Court reversed Rodriguez III and remanded this case to the Ninth Circuit to\n4 consider whether the class action may continue based on Petitioners’ constitutional\n5 claims, which had not yet been considered by this Court.  See Jennings v. Rodriguez,\n6 138 S. Ct. 830 (2018) [“Jennings”].  The Supreme Court was silent as to the status of\n7 the permanent injunction.  On remand, the Ninth Circuit, in turn, remanded this case \n8 to this Court for it to consider Petitioner’s constitutional claims; the Ninth Circuit left\n9 this  Court’s  permanent  injunction  in  place  “pending  the  consideration  of  vital\n10 constitutional issues.”  See Rodriguez v. Marin, 909 F.3d 252, 256 (9th Cir. 2018)\n11 [“Marin”]. \n12 On July 10, 2019, the Court granted Petitioners’ motion for leave to file a Fourth\n13 Amended  Complaint.    After  Petitioners  filed  their  Fourth  Amended  Complaint, \n14 Respondents moved to dismiss. \n15 On November 7, 2019, the Court granted in part and denied in part Respondents’\n16 motion to dismiss Petitioners’ Fourth Amended Complaint.  That order included\n17 language indicating that the Supreme Court had implicitly vacated the permanent\n18 injunction in Jennings.  On November 18, 2019, Petitioners moved for reconsideration\n19 of the November 7, 2019, order, arguing that the Ninth Circuit expressly left in place\n20 the “permanent injunction pending the consideration of... vital constitutional issues.” \n21 See Marin, 909 F.3d at 256. \n22 On  November  27,  2019,  before  the  Court  had  an  opportunity  to  rule  on\n23 Petitioners’ motion for reconsideration, Respondents moved to vacate the preliminary\n24 injunction.  \n25 On March 9, 2020, the Court granted Petitioners’ motion for reconsideration and\n26 issued an amended order that, inter alia, omitted the language regarding the permanent\n27 injunction, pursuant to Marin.  \n28 On April 7, 2020, Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court’s\nOrder – Page 3 of 5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 555   Filed 05/28/20   Page 4 of 5   Page ID #:10540\n1 March 9, 2020, order and for an order vacating the permanent injunction, arguing that\n2 the Court’s March 9, 2020, order, inter alia, deprived Respondents of the opportunity\n3 to brief whether a permanent injunction should remain in place for the duration of the\n4 proceedings in this matter.  Respondents chose to file their motion to vacate the\n5 preliminary  injunction  before  the  Court  could  rule  on  Petitioners’  motion  for\n6 reconsideration, despite knowing that the status of the permanent injunction was in\n7 dispute.  \n8 Normally, a preliminary injunction remains in force until a case is finally\n9 resolved.  Here, after the Court granted summary judgment in favor of Petitioners, it\n10 issued a permanent injunction, which superceded the preliminary injunction.  Then, the\n11 Supreme Court reversed and vacated the summary judgment.  Consequently, this Court \n12 initially held that the Supreme Court had implicitly vacated the permanent injunction\n13 when it vacated this Court’s summary judgment.  However, because the Ninth Circuit,\n14 on remand from the Supreme Court, left the permanent injunction in place pending the\n15 consideration of the constitutional issues, Marin, 909 F.3d at 256, this Court is\n16 obligated  to  follow  those  instructions.    Accordingly,  Respondents’  motions  for\n17 reconsideration and to vacate the permanent injunction must be denied. \n18 Because of the orders from the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court, there, now,\n19 exists a procedural quagmire in that there is a permanent injunction in place without a\n20 corresponding final judgment on the merits supporting that permanent injunction.  Thus,\n21 this Court has been entrusted with the task of fitting the proverbial round peg into the\n22 square hole, while being duty bound to respect, give meaning, reconcile and apply the\n23 orders of the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court.  The most sensical resolution to this\n24 procedural quagmire, while maintaining due respect for the orders of the Ninth Circuit\n25 and the Supreme Court, is for this Court to deem its previously issued permanent\n26 injunction  to  be,  in  effect,  a  preliminary  injunction,  which  shall  supercede  the\n27 previously issued preliminary injunction, and which shall, now, remain in place pending\n28 a final resolution of Petitioners’ constitutional claims.  Accordingly, Respondents’\nOrder – Page 4 of 5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 555   Filed 05/28/20   Page 5 of 5   Page ID #:10541\n1 motion to vacate the preliminary injunction shall be denied as moot. \n2   Finally, while considering the procedural quagmire caused by the continuation\n3 of the permanent injunction, the Court simultaneously considered  Respondents’ motion\n4 to de-certify the class.  When the Court certified this case into sub-classes, it did so\n5 pursuant to Rodriguez I.  Thereafter, the certification of the class permeated all aspects\n6 of this case.  Indeed, the Court’s original preliminary and permanent injunctions\n7 ordered remedies based on class members’ membership in particular sub-classes.  See\n8 Rodriguez II and III.  Because the Ninth Circuit ordered the permanent injunction to\n9 remain in effect, the decertification of the class, at this juncture, would move this case\n10 backward rather than forward.  As previously stated, that is not the direction the Court\n11 is attempting to move this case.  Consequently, the motion to decertify the class must\n12 be denied.\n13\n14 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n15\n16 Date: May 28, 2020 \n17 __________________________________\n18 Terry J.

RODRIGUEZ ET AL., INDIVIDUALLY \nAND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE NINTH CIRCUIT \nNo. 15–1204.  Argued November 30, 2016—Reargued October 3, \n2017—Decided February 27, 2018 \nImmigration officials are authorized to detain certain aliens in the\ncourse of immigration proceedings while they determine whether \nthose aliens may be lawfully present in the country.  For example,\n§1225(b) of Title 8 of the U. S. Code authorizes the detention of cer-\ntain aliens seeking to enter the country.  Section 1225(b)(1) applies to\naliens initially determined to be inadmissible due to fraud, misrepre-\nsentation, or lack of valid documentation, and to certain other aliens \ndesignated  by  the  Attorney  General  in  his  discretion.    Section \n1225(b)(2) is a catchall provision that applies to most other appli-\ncants for admission not covered by §1225(b)(1).  Under §1225(b)(1), \naliens are normally ordered removed “without further hearing or re-\nview,” §1225(b)(1)(A)(i), but an alien indicating either an intention to \napply for asylum or a credible fear of persecution, §1225(b)(1)(A)(ii),\n“shall be detained” while that alien’s asylum application is pending,\n§1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  Aliens covered by §1225(b)(2) in turn “shall be de-\ntained for a [removal] proceeding” if an immigration officer “deter-\nmines that [they are] not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled” to ad-\nmission. §1225(b)(2)(A).\nThe Government is also authorized to detain certain aliens already\nin the country.  Section 1226(a)’s default rule permits the Attorney \nGeneral to issue warrants for the arrest and detention of these aliens \npending the outcome of their removal proceedings.  The Attorney \nGeneral “may release” these aliens on bond, “[e]xcept as provided in \nsubsection (c) of this section.”  Section 1226(c) in turn states that the\nAttorney General “shall take into custody any alien” who falls into\none of the enumerated categories involving criminal offenses and ter-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 3 of 92   Page ID #:9742\n2  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nSyllabus \nrorist activities, §1226(c)(1), and specifies that the Attorney General\n“may release” one of those aliens “only if the Attorney General de-\ncides” both that doing so is necessary for witness-protection purposes \nand that the alien will not pose a danger or flight risk, §1226(c)(2). \nAfter a 2004 conviction, respondent Alejandro Rodriguez, a Mexi-\ncan citizen and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, \nwas detained pursuant to §1226 while the Government sought to re-\nmove him.  In May 2007, while still litigating his removal, Rodriguez \nfiled a habeas petition, claiming that he was entitled to a bond hear-\ning to determine whether his continued detention was justified.  As \nrelevant here, he and the class of aliens he represents allege that \n§§1225(b), 1226(a), and 1226(c) do not authorize “prolonged” deten-\ntion in the absence of an individualized bond hearing at which the \nGovernment proves by clear and convincing evidence that detention\nremains justified.  The District Court entered a permanent injunc-\ntion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  Relying on the canon of consti-\ntutional  avoidance,  the  Ninth  Circuit  construed  §§1225(b)  and \n1226(c) as imposing an implicit 6-month time limit on an alien’s de-\ntention under those sections.  After that point, the court held, the \nGovernment may continue to detain the alien only under the authority\nof §1226(a).  The court then construed §1226(a) to mean that an alien\nmust be given a bond hearing every six months and that detention\nbeyond the initial 6-month period is permitted only if the Govern-\nment proves by clear and convincing evidence that further detention\nis justified. \nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. \n804 F. 3d 1060, reversed and remanded. \nJUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part\nII, concluding that §§1225(b), 1226(a), and 1226(c) do not give de-\ntained aliens the right to periodic bond hearings during the course of\ntheir detention.  The Ninth Circuit misapplied the canon of constitu-\ntional avoidance in holding otherwise.  Pp. 12–31.\n(a) The canon of constitutional avoidance “comes into play only\nwhen, after the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is\nfound to be susceptible of more than one [plausible] construction.” \nClark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 385.  The Ninth Circuit’s interpre-\ntations of the provisions at issue, however, are implausible.  Pp. 12– \n13. \n(b) Read most naturally, §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) mandate detention\nof applicants for admission until certain proceedings have concluded. \nUntil that point, nothing in the statutory text imposes a limit on the \nlength of detention, and neither provision says anything about bond \nhearings.  Pp. 13–19.\n(1) Nothing in the text of §1225(b)(1) or §1225(b)(2) hints that \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 4 of 92   Page ID #:9743\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  3 \nSyllabus \nthose provisions have an implicit 6-month time limit on the length of \ndetention.  Respondents must show that this is a plausible reading in\norder to prevail under the canon of constitutional avoidance, but they\nsimply invoke the canon without making any attempt to defend their \nreading.\nThe Ninth Circuit also all but ignored the statutory text, relying \ninstead on Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, as authority for grafting\na time limit onto §1225(b)’s text.  There, this Court invoked the \nconstitutional-avoidance canon, construing §1231(a)(6)—which pro-\nvides than an alien subject to a removal order “may be detained” be-\nyond the section’s 90-day removal period—to mean that the alien\nmay not be detained beyond “a period reasonably necessary to secure \nremoval,” id., at 699, presumptively six months, id., at 701.  The \nCourt detected ambiguity in the statutory phrase “may be detained”\nand noted the absence of any explicit statutory limit on the length of\npermissible detention following the entry of an order of removal. \nSeveral material differences distinguish the provisions at issue in \nthis case from Zadvydas’s interpretation of §1231(a)(6).  To start, the \nprovisions here, unlike §1231(a)(6), mandate detention for a specified\nperiod  of  time:  until  immigration  officers  have  finished  “consid-\ner[ing]” the asylum application, §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), or until removal\nproceedings have concluded, §1225(b)(2)(A).  Section 1231(a)(6) also\nuses the ambiguous “may,” while §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) use the une-\nquivocal mandate “shall be detained.”  There is also a specific provi-\nsion authorizing temporary parole from §1225(b) detention “for ur-\ngent  humanitarian  reasons  or  significant  public  benefit,” \n§1182(d)(5)(A), but no similar release provision applies to §1231(a)(6).\nThat express exception implies that there are no other circumstances \nunder  which  aliens  detained  under  §1225(b)  may  be  released. \nPp. 14–17. \n(2) Respondents also claim that the term “for” in §§1225(b)(1)\nand (b)(2) mandates detention only until the start of applicable pro-\nceedings.  That is inconsistent with the meanings of “for”—“[d]uring\n[or] throughout,” 6 Oxford English Dictionary 26, and “with the object \nor purpose of,” id., at 23—that make sense in the context of the statu-\ntory scheme as a whole.  Nor does respondents’ reading align with the\nhistorical use of “for” in §1225.  Pp. 17–19.\n(c) Section 1226(c)’s language is even clearer. By allowing aliens to\nbe released “only if ” the Attorney General decides that certain condi-\ntions are met, that provision reinforces the conclusion that aliens de-\ntained under its authority are not entitled to be released under any \ncircumstances other than those expressly recognized by the statute.\nTogether with §1226(a), §1226(c) makes clear that detention of aliens\nwithin its scope must continue “pending a decision” on removal.  Sec-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 5 of 92   Page ID #:9744\n4  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nSyllabus \ntion 1226(c) is thus not silent as to the length of detention.  See \nDemore v. Kim, 538 U. S. 510, 529.  The provision, by expressly stat-\ning that covered aliens may be released “only if ” certain conditions \nare met, also unequivocally imposes an affirmative prohibition on re-\nleasing them under any other conditions.  Finally, because §1226(c)\nand the PATRIOT Act apply to different categories of aliens in differ-\nent ways, adopting §1226(c)’s plain meaning will not make any part\nof the PATRIOT Act, see §1226a(a)(3), superfluous.  Pp. 19–22. \n(d) Nothing in §1226(a), which authorizes the Attorney General to \narrest and detain an alien “pending a decision” on removal and which\npermits the Attorney General to release the alien on bond, supports \nthe imposition of periodic bond hearings every six months in which\nthe Attorney General must prove by clear and convincing evidence \nthat continued detention is necessary.  Nor does it hint that the \nlength of detention prior to the bond hearing must be considered in\ndetermining whether an alien should be released.  Pp. 22–23.\n(e) The Ninth Circuit should consider the merits of respondents’\nconstitutional arguments in the first instance.  But before doing so, it\nshould also reexamine whether respondents can continue litigating\ntheir claims as a class.

Immigra-\ntion officials must also determine on a daily basis whether \nthere are grounds for removing any of the aliens who are \nalready present inside the country.  The vast majority of \nthese determinations are quickly made, but in some cases \ndeciding whether an alien should be admitted or removed \nis not as easy.  As a result, Congress has authorized immi-\ngration officials to detain some classes of aliens during the \ncourse  of  certain  immigration  proceedings.    Detention \nduring those proceedings gives immigration officials time \nto determine an alien’s status without running the risk of \nthe  alien’s  either  absconding  or  engaging  in  criminal \n—————— \n* JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins only Part III–C of this opinion. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 7 of 92   Page ID #:9746\n2  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nactivity before a final decision can be made.\nIn this case we are asked to interpret three provisions of \nU. S. immigration law that authorize the Government to\ndetain aliens in the course of immigration proceedings. \nAll parties appear to agree that the text of these provi-\nsions, when read most naturally, does not give detained \naliens the right to periodic bond hearings during the course \nof their detention.  But by relying on the constitutional-\navoidance canon of statutory interpretation, the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit held that detained aliens\nhave a statutory right to periodic bond hearings under the \nprovisions at issue.\nUnder the constitutional-avoidance canon, when statu-\ntory language is susceptible of multiple interpretations, a\ncourt  may  shun  an  interpretation  that  raises  serious \nconstitutional doubts and instead may adopt an alterna-\ntive that avoids those problems.  But a court relying on \nthat canon still must interpret the statute, not rewrite it. \nBecause the Court of Appeals in this case adopted implau-\nsible constructions of the three immigration provisions at\nissue,  we  reverse  its  judgment  and  remand  for  further\nproceedings. \nI \nA \nTo implement its immigration policy, the Government \nmust be able to decide (1) who may enter the country and \n(2) who may stay here after entering. \n1 \nThat process of decision generally begins at the Nation’s\nborders and ports of entry, where the Government must \ndetermine whether an alien seeking to enter the country is\nadmissible.  Under 122 Stat. 867, 8 U. S. C. §1225, an\nalien who “arrives in the United States,” or “is present” in \nthis country but “has not been admitted,” is treated as “an \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 8 of 92   Page ID #:9747\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  3 \nOpinion of the Court \napplicant  for  admission.”  §1225(a)(1).    Applicants  for\nadmission must “be inspected by immigration officers” to\nensure that they may be admitted into the country con-\nsistent with U. S. immigration law.  §1225(a)(3). \nAs relevant here, applicants for admission fall into one \nof two categories, those covered by §1225(b)(1) and those \ncovered  by  §1225(b)(2).  Section  1225(b)(1)  applies  to\naliens  initially  determined  to  be  inadmissible  due  to \nfraud, misrepresentation, or lack of valid documentation.\nSee §1225(b)(1)(A)(i) (citing §§1182(a)(6)(C), (a)(7)).  Sec-\ntion 1225(b)(1) also applies to certain other aliens desig-\nnated  by  the  Attorney  General  in  his  discretion.  See \n§1225(b)(1)(A)(iii).  Section 1225(b)(2) is broader.  It serves \nas a catchall provision that applies to all applicants for \nadmission not covered by §1225(b)(1) (with specific excep-\ntions not relevant here).  See §§1225(b)(2)(A), (B).\nBoth §1225(b)(1) and §1225(b)(2) authorize the deten-\ntion of certain aliens.  Aliens covered by §1225(b)(1) are \nnormally  ordered  removed  “without  further  hearing  or \nreview”  pursuant  to  an  expedited  removal  process. \n§1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  But  if  a  §1225(b)(1)  alien  “indicates \neither an intention to apply for asylum . . . or a fear of \npersecution,”  then  that  alien  is  referred  for  an  asylum\ninterview.  §1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).  If  an  immigration  officer\ndetermines after that interview that the alien has a credi-\nble fear of persecution, “the alien shall be detained for \nfurther  consideration  of  the  application  for  asylum.” \n§1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  Aliens  who  are  instead  covered  by\n§1225(b)(2) are detained pursuant to a different process. \nThose aliens “shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding” \nif an immigration officer “determines that [they are] not \nclearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted” into \nthe country.  §1225(b)(2)(A). \nRegardless  of  which  of  those  two  sections  authorizes \ntheir detention, applicants for admission may be tempo-\nrarily released on parole “for urgent humanitarian reasons \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 9 of 92   Page ID #:9748\n4  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nor significant public benefit.”  §1182(d)(5)(A); see also 8 \nCFR  §§212.5(b),  235.3  (2017).    Such  parole,  however,\n“shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien.”  8 \nU. S. C. §1182(d)(5)(A).  Instead, when the purpose of the \nparole has been served, “the alien shall forthwith return\nor be returned to the custody from which he was paroled\nand thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in \nthe same manner as that of any other applicant for admis-\nsion to the United States.”  Ibid. \n2 \nEven once inside the United States, aliens do not have \nan absolute right to remain here.  For example, an alien\npresent in the country may still be removed if he or she \nfalls “within one or more . . . classes of deportable aliens.” \n§1227(a).  That includes aliens who were inadmissible at \nthe time of entry or who have been convicted of certain\ncriminal offenses since admission.  See §§1227(a)(1), (2). \nSection 1226 generally governs the process of arresting\nand detaining that group of aliens pending their removal.\nAs relevant here, §1226 distinguishes between two differ-\nent categories of aliens.  Section 1226(a) sets out the de-\nfault rule: The Attorney General may issue a warrant for\nthe arrest and detention of an alien “pending a decision on \nwhether  the  alien  is  to  be  removed  from  the  United \nStates.”  §1226(a).  “Except as provided in subsection (c) of \nthis section,” the Attorney General “may release” an alien \ndetained under §1226(a) “on bond . . . or conditional pa-\nrole.”  Ibid. \nSection 1226(c), however, carves out a statutory category \nof aliens who may not be released under §1226(a).  Under \n§1226(c), the “Attorney General shall take into custody \nany alien” who falls into one of several enumerated cate-\ngories involving criminal offenses and terrorist activities.\n§1226(c)(1).  The Attorney General may release aliens in\nthose categories “only if the Attorney General decides . . . \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 10 of 92   Page ID\n #:9749\nCite as: 583 U.

Any \nrelease under those narrow conditions “shall take place in \naccordance with a procedure that considers the severity of\nthe offense committed by the alien.”  Ibid.1 \nIn sum, U. S. immigration law authorizes the Govern-\nment to detain certain aliens seeking admission into the \ncountry under §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2).  It also authorizes \nthe Government to detain certain aliens already in the \ncountry  pending  the  outcome  of  removal  proceedings \nunder §§1226(a) and (c).  The primary issue is the proper \ninterpretation of §§1225(b), 1226(a), and 1226(c). \nB \nRespondent Alejandro Rodriguez is a Mexican citizen.\nSince 1987, he has also been a lawful permanent resident \nof the United States.  In April 2004, after Rodriguez was \nconvicted  of  a  drug  offense  and  theft  of  a  vehicle,  the\nGovernment  detained  him  under  §1226  and  sought  to \nremove him from the country.  At his removal hearing,\nRodriguez argued both that he was not removable and, in\nthe alternative, that he was eligible for relief from removal.\nIn July 2004, an Immigration Judge ordered Rodriguez\ndeported to Mexico.  Rodriguez chose to appeal that deci-\nsion to the Board of Immigration Appeals, but five months \n—————— \n1Anyone who believes that he is not covered by §1226(c) may also ask\nfor what is known as a “Joseph hearing.”  See Matter of Joseph, 22 \nI. & N. Dec. 799 (BIA 1999).  At a Joseph hearing, that person “may\navoid mandatory detention by demonstrating that he is not an alien,\nwas not convicted of the predicate crime, or that the [Government] is \notherwise substantially unlikely to establish that he is in fact subject to\nmandatory detention.”  Demore v. Kim, 538 U. S. 510, 514, n. 3 (2003). \nWhether respondents are entitled to Joseph hearings is not before this\nCourt. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 11 of 92   Page ID\n #:9750\n6  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nlater  the  Board  agreed  that  Rodriguez  was  subject  to \nmandatory removal.  Once again, Rodriguez chose to seek \nfurther review, this time petitioning the Court of Appeals \nfor the Ninth Circuit for review of the Board’s decision. \nIn May 2007, while Rodriguez was still litigating his\nremoval in the Court of Appeals, he filed a habeas petition \nin the District Court for the Central District of California, \nalleging that he was entitled to a bond hearing to deter-\nmine  whether  his  continued  detention  was  justified.\nRodriguez’s case was consolidated with another, similar \ncase  brought  by  Alejandro  Garcia,  and  together  they \nmoved for class certification. The District Court denied \ntheir motion, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit reversed.  See Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F. 3d 1105, \n1111 (2010).  It concluded that the proposed class met the \ncertification requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure, and it remanded the case to the Dis-\ntrict Court.  Id., at 1111, 1126. \nOn remand, the District Court certified the following\nclass: \n“[A]ll non-citizens within the Central District of Cali-\nfornia who: (1) are or were detained for longer than \nsix months pursuant to one of the general immigra-\ntion detention statutes pending completion of removal \nproceedings, including judicial review, (2) are not and \nhave not been detained pursuant to a national security \ndetention statute, and (3) have not been afforded a\nhearing to determine whether their detention is justi-\nfied.”  Class Certification Order in Rodriguez v. Hayes, \nCV 07–03239 (CD Cal., Apr. 5, 2010). \nThe District Court named Rodriguez as class representa-\ntive of the newly certified class, ibid., and then organized\nthe class into four subclasses based on the four “general\nimmigration  detention  statutes”  under  which  it  under-\nstood the class members to be detained: Sections 1225(b), \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 12 of 92   Page ID\n #:9751\nCite as: 583 U.

Holder, \nCV 07–03239 (CD Cal., Mar. 8, 2011) (2011 Order); Rodri-\nguez v. Robbins, 715 F. 3d 1127, 1130–1131 (CA9 2013).\nEach of the four subclasses was certified to pursue declar-\natory and injunctive relief.  2011 Order.  On appeal, the\nCourt of Appeals held that the §1231(a) subclass had been\nimproperly certified, but it affirmed the certification of the \nother  three  subclasses.   See  Rodriguez  v. Robbins,  804 \nF. 3d 1060, 1074, 1085–1086 (CA9 2015). \nIn their complaint, Rodriguez and the other respondents \nargued that the relevant statutory provisions—§§1225(b),\n1226(a), and 1226(c)—do not authorize “prolonged” deten-\ntion in the absence of an individualized bond hearing at \nwhich  the  Government  proves  by  clear  and  convincing\nevidence that the class member’s detention remains justi-\nfied.  Absent such a bond-hearing requirement, respond-\nents continued, those three provisions would violate the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  In their \nprayer  for  relief,  respondents  thus  asked  the  District \nCourt to require the Government “to provide, after giving\nnotice, individual hearings before an immigration judge\nfor . . . each member of the class, at which [the Govern-\nment] will bear the burden to prove by clear and convinc-\ning evidence that no reasonable conditions will ensure the\ndetainee’s presence in the event of removal and protect the \ncommunity  from  serious  danger,  despite  the  prolonged\nlength of detention at issue.”  Third Amended Complaint \nin Rodriguez v. Holder, CV 07–03239, p. 31 (CD Cal., Oct. \n20,  2010).  Respondents  also  sought  declaratory  relief. \nIbid. \nAs relevant here, the District Court entered a perma-\nnent injunction in line with the relief sought by respond-\nents, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  See 804 F. 3d, at \n1065.  Relying  heavily  on  the  canon  of  constitutional\navoidance, the Court of Appeals construed §§1225(b) and \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 13 of 92   Page ID\n #:9752\n8  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of ALITO, J. \n1226(c) as imposing an implicit 6-month time limit on an\nalien’s detention under these sections.  Id., at 1079, 1082. \nAfter that point, the Court of Appeals held, the Govern-\nment  may  continue  to  detain  the  alien  only  under  the\nauthority of §1226(a).  Ibid.  The Court of Appeals then \nconstrued §1226(a) to mean that an alien must be given a\nbond hearing every six months and that detention beyond \nthe initial 6-month period is permitted only if the Gov-\nernment  proves  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that\nfurther detention is justified.  Id., at 1085, 1087. \nThe Government petitioned this Court for review of that\ndecision, and we granted certiorari.  579 U. S. ___ (2016). \nII \nBefore reaching the merits of the lower court’s interpre-\ntation, we briefly address whether we have jurisdiction to\nentertain respondents’ claims.  We discuss two potential\nobstacles, 8 U. S. C. §§1252(b)(9) and 1226(e). \nA \n  Under §1252(b)(9): \n“Judicial review of all questions of law and fact, in-\ncluding interpretation and application of constitutional\nand  statutory  provisions,  arising  from  any  action\ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from\nthe United States under this subchapter [including\n§§1225 and 1226] shall be available only in judicial \nreview of a final order under this section.” \nThis provision does not deprive us of jurisdiction.  We \nare  required  in  this  case  to  decide  “questions  of  law,”\nspecifically, whether, contrary to the decision of the Court\nof Appeals, certain statutory provisions require detention \nwithout a bond hearing.  We assume for the sake of argu-\nment that the actions taken with respect to all the aliens \nin  the  certified  class  constitute  “action[s]  taken  . . .  to \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 14 of 92   Page ID\n #:9753\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  9 \nOpinion of ALITO, J. \nremove [them] from the United States.”2  On that assump-\ntion, the applicability of §1252(b)(9) turns on whether the\nlegal  questions  that  we  must  decide  “aris[e]  from”  the\nactions taken to remove these aliens. \nIt may be argued that this is so in the sense that if those \nactions had never been taken, the aliens would not be in \ncustody  at  all.    But  this  expansive  interpretation  of \n§1252(b)(9) would lead to staggering results.  Suppose, for\nexample, that a detained alien wishes to assert a claim\nunder Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 \nU. S. 388 (1971), based on allegedly inhumane conditions\nof confinement.  See, e.g., Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U. S. ___, \n___–___ (2017) (slip op., at 23–29).  Or suppose that a \ndetained alien brings a state-law claim for assault against \na guard or fellow detainee.  Or suppose that an alien is\ninjured when a truck hits the bus transporting aliens to a\ndetention facility, and the alien sues the driver or owner of \nthe truck.  The “questions of law and fact” in all those \ncases could be said to “aris[e] from” actions taken to re-\nmove the aliens in the sense that the aliens’ injuries would \nnever have occurred if they had not been placed in deten-\ntion.  But cramming judicial review of those questions into\nthe review of final removal orders would be absurd. \nInterpreting “arising from” in this extreme way would\nalso make claims of prolonged detention effectively unre-\nviewable.  By the time a final order of removal was even-\ntually  entered,  the  allegedly  excessive  detention  would \nhave already taken place.  And of course, it is possible that\nno such order would ever be entered in a particular case,\ndepriving  that  detainee  of  any  meaningful  chance  for\njudicial review.\nIn past cases, when confronted with capacious phrases \n—————— \n2It is questionable whether this is true for aliens who are detained\nunder 8 U. S. C. §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) for consideration of their asylum \napplications. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 15 of 92   Page ID\n #:9754\n10  JENNINGS v.

S. 471, 482 (1999), we took \nthis approach in construing the very phrase that appears \nin §1252(b)(9).  A neighboring provision of the Immigra-\ntion and Nationality Act refers to “any cause or claim by or\non behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action \nby the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudi-\ncate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien\nunder this chapter.”  8 U. S. C. §1252(g) (emphasis added).\nWe did not interpret this language to sweep in any claim \nthat can technically be said to “arise from” the three listed\nactions of the Attorney General.  Instead, we read the \nlanguage to refer to just those three specific actions them-\nselves.  American-Arab  Anti-Discrimination  Comm.,  su-\npra, at 482–483. \nThe parties in this case have not addressed the scope of \n§1252(b)(9), and it is not necessary for us to attempt to \nprovide  a  comprehensive  interpretation.    For  present\npurposes, it is enough to note that respondents are not \nasking for  review of an order of removal; they are not \nchallenging the decision to detain them in the first place \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 16 of 92   Page ID\n #:9755\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  11 \nOpinion of ALITO, J. \nor to seek removal; and they are not even challenging any \npart of the process by which their removability will be\ndetermined.  Under these circumstances, §1252(b)(9) does\nnot present a jurisdictional bar.3 \nB \nWe likewise hold that §1226(e) does not bar us from\nconsidering respondents’ claims.\nThat provision states: \n“The  Attorney  General’s  discretionary  judgment  re-\ngarding the application of [§1226] shall not be subject \nto review.  No court may set aside any action or deci-\nsion by the Attorney General under this section re-\ngarding the detention or release of any alien or the \ngrant,  revocation,  or  denial  of  bond  or  parole.”\n§1226(e). \nAs we have previously explained, §1226(e) precludes an\nalien from “challeng[ing] a ‘discretionary judgment’ by the \nAttorney General or a ‘decision’ that the Attorney General\nhas made regarding his detention or release.”  Demore v. \nKim, 538 U. S. 510, 516 (2003).  But §1226(e) does not \npreclude  “challenges  [to]  the  statutory  framework  that \npermits [the alien’s] detention without bail.”  Id., at 517. \nRespondents mount that second type of challenge here. \n—————— \n3The concurrence contends that “detention is an ‘action taken . . . to \nremove’ an alien” and that therefore “even the narrowest reading of \n‘arising from’ must cover” the claims raised by respondents.  Post, at 6. \nWe do not follow this logic.  We will assume for the sake of argument\nthat detention is an action taken “to remove an alien,” i.e., for the \npurpose of removing an alien, rather than simply an action aimed at\nensuring that the alien does not flee or commit a crime while his\nproceedings are pending.  But even if we proceed on the basis of that \nassumption, we do not see what it proves.  The question is not whether \ndetention is an action taken to remove an alien but whether the legal \nquestions in this case arise from such an action.  And for the reasons \nexplained above, those legal questions are too remote from the actions \ntaken to fall within the scope of §1252(b)(9). \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 17 of 92   Page ID\n #:9756\n12  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nFirst and foremost, they are challenging the extent of the\nGovernment’s  detention  authority  under  the  “statutory\nframework” as a whole.  If that challenge fails, they are \nthen contesting the constitutionality of the entire statutory \nscheme under the Fifth Amendment.  Because the extent \nof the Government’s detention authority is not a matter of\n“discretionary judgment,” “action,” or “decision,” respond-\nents’ challenge to “the statutory framework that permits \n[their] detention without bail,” ibid., falls outside of the \nscope of §1226(e).  We may therefore consider the merits of \ntheir claims. \nIII \nWhen “a serious doubt” is raised about the constitution-\nality of an act of Congress, “it is a cardinal principle that\nthis Court will first ascertain whether a construction of \nthe statute is fairly possible by which the question may be\navoided.”  Crowell  v.  Benson,  285  U. S.  22,  62  (1932). \nRelying  on  this  canon  of  constitutional  avoidance,  the\nCourt of Appeals construed §§1225(b), 1226(a), and 1226(c) \nto  limit  the  permissible  length  of  an  alien’s  detention \nwithout a bond hearing.  Without such a construction, the \nCourt of Appeals believed, the “‘prolonged detention with-\nout adequate procedural protections’” authorized by the \nprovisions “‘would raise serious constitutional concerns.’”  \n804 F. 3d, at 1077 (quoting Casas-Castrillon v. DHS, 535 \nF. 3d 942, 950 (CA9 2008)).\nThe canon of constitutional avoidance “comes into play\nonly when, after the application of ordinary textual analy-\nsis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one \nconstruction.”    Clark  v.  Martinez,  543  U. S.  371,  385 \n(2005).  In the absence of more than one plausible con-\nstruction, the canon simply “‘has no application.’”  Warger \nv. Shauers, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 10) (quot-\ning United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coopera-\ntive, 532 U.

S. ____ (2018)  13 \nOpinion of the Court \nThe Court of Appeals misapplied the canon in this case\nbecause its interpretations of the three provisions at issue\nhere are implausible.  In Parts III–A and III–B, we hold \nthat,  subject  only  to  express  exceptions,  §§1225(b)  and \n1226(c)  authorize  detention  until  the  end  of  applicable\nproceedings.  And in Part III–C, we hold that there is no \njustification for any of the procedural requirements that \nthe Court of Appeals layered onto §1226(a) without any \narguable statutory foundation. \nA \nAs noted, §1225(b) applies primarily to aliens seeking \nentry into the United States (“applicants for admission” in \nthe language of the statute).  Section 1225(b) divides these\napplicants into two categories.  First, certain aliens claim-\ning a credible fear of persecution under §1225(b)(1) “shall \nbe detained for further consideration of the application for \nasylum.”  §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  Second, aliens falling within \nthe scope of §1225(b)(2) “shall be detained for a [removal] \nproceeding.”  §1225(b)(2)(A).\nRead most naturally, §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) thus man-\ndate detention of applicants for admission until certain\nproceedings have concluded.  Section 1225(b)(1) aliens are \ndetained for “further consideration of the application for \nasylum,” and §1225(b)(2) aliens are in turn detained for \n“[removal]  proceeding[s].”    Once  those  proceedings  end, \ndetention under §1225(b) must end as well.  Until that \npoint, however, nothing in the statutory text imposes any \nlimit on the length of detention.  And neither §1225(b)(1)\nnor  §1225(b)(2)  says  anything  whatsoever  about  bond \nhearings.\nDespite the clear language of §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2),\nrespondents argue—and the Court of Appeals held—that \nthose provisions nevertheless can be construed to contain \nimplicit limitations on the length of detention.  But nei-\nther  of  the  two  limiting  interpretations  offered  by  re-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 19 of 92   Page ID\n #:9758\n14  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nspondents is plausible. \n1 \nFirst,  respondents  argue  that  §§1225(b)(1)  and  (b)(2)\ncontain an implicit 6-month limit on the length of deten-\ntion.  Once  that  6-month  period  elapses,  respondents\ncontend, aliens previously detained under those provisions\nmust instead be detained under the authority of §1226(a),\nwhich allows for bond hearings in certain circumstances. \nThere  are  many  problems  with  this  interpretation.\nNothing in the text of §1225(b)(1) or §1225(b)(2) even hints\nthat those provisions restrict detention after six months,\nbut respondents do not engage in any analysis of the text. \nInstead,  they  simply  cite  the  canon  of  constitutional \navoidance and urge this Court to use that canon to read a\n“six-month reasonableness limitation” into §1225(b).  Brief \nfor Respondents 48.\nThat is not how the canon of constitutional avoidance \nworks.   Spotting a  constitutional issue does not give  a \ncourt  the  authority  to  rewrite  a  statute  as  it  pleases.\nInstead, the canon permits a court to “choos[e] between\ncompeting plausible interpretations of a statutory text.” \nClark, supra, at 381 (emphasis added).  To prevail, re-\nspondents must thus show that §1225(b)’s detention provi-\nsions may plausibly be read to contain an implicit 6-month\nlimit.  And they do not even attempt to defend that read-\ning of the text.\nIn much the same manner, the Court of Appeals all but\nignored the statutory text.  Instead, it read Zadvydas v. \nDavis,  533  U. S.  678  (2001),  as  essentially  granting  a \nlicense  to  graft  a  time  limit  onto  the  text  of  §1225(b). \nZadvydas, however, provides no such authority. \nZadvydas concerned §1231(a)(6), which authorizes the \ndetention  of  aliens  who  have  already  been  ordered  re-\nmoved from the country.  Under this section, when an \nalien is ordered removed, the Attorney General is directed \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 20 of 92   Page ID\n #:9759\nCite as: 583 U.

After  that  time  elapses,  however,\n§1231(a)(6)  provides  only  that  certain  aliens  “may  be \ndetained”  while  efforts  to  complete  removal  continue. \n(Emphasis added.)\nIn Zadvydas, the Court construed §1231(a)(6) to mean \nthat an alien who has been ordered removed may not be\ndetained beyond “a period reasonably necessary to secure\nremoval,” 533 U. S., at 699, and it further held that six \nmonths is a presumptively reasonable period, id., at 701. \nAfter that, the Court concluded, if the alien “provides good\nreason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of \nremoval in the reasonably foreseeable future,” the Gov-\nernment must either rebut that showing or release the\nalien.  Ibid.\n  The  Zadvydas  Court  justified  this  interpretation  by \ninvoking  the  constitutional-avoidance  canon,  and  the \nCourt defended its resort to that canon on the ground that\n§1231(a)(6) is ambiguous.  Specifically, the Court detected \nambiguity  in  the  statutory  phrase  “may  be  detained.” \n“‘[M]ay,’”  the  Court  said,  “suggests  discretion”  but  not\nnecessarily “unlimited discretion.  In that respect the word \n‘may’ is ambiguous.”  Id., at 697.  The Court also pointed \nto the absence of any explicit statutory limit on the length \nof permissible detention following the entry of an order of \nremoval.  Ibid. \nZadvydas represents a notably generous application of \nthe constitutional-avoidance canon, but the Court of Ap-\npeals in this case went much further.  It failed to address \nwhether Zadvydas’s reasoning may fairly be applied in\nthis case despite the many ways in which the provision in\nquestion in Zadvydas, §1231(a)(6), differs materially from\nthose at issue here, §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2).  Those dif-\nferences  preclude  the  reading  adopted  by  the  Court  of \nAppeals. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 21 of 92   Page ID\n #:9760\n16  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nTo  start,  §§1225(b)(1)  and  (b)(2),  unlike  §1231(a)(6),\nprovide for detention for a specified period of time.  Sec-\ntion 1225(b)(1) mandates detention “for further considera-\ntion of the application for asylum,” §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), and \n§1225(b)(2)  requires  detention  “for  a  [removal]  proceed-\ning,” §1225(b)(2)(A).  The plain meaning of those phrases \nis that detention must continue until immigration officers\nhave finished “consider[ing]” the application for asylum,\n§1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), or until removal proceedings have con-\ncluded,  §1225(b)(2)(A).  By  contrast,  Congress  left  the\npermissible length of detention under §1231(a)(6) unclear. \n  Moreover,  in  Zadvydas,  the  Court  saw  ambiguity  in\n§1231(a)(6)’s use of the word “may.”  Here, by contrast,\n§§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) do not use the word “may.”  In-\nstead,  they  unequivocally  mandate  that  aliens  falling \nwithin their scope “shall” be detained.  “Unlike the word \n‘may,’ which implies discretion, the word ‘shall’ usually \nconnotes a requirement.”  Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. \nv. United States, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).\nThat  requirement  of  detention  precludes  a  court  from \nfinding ambiguity here in the way that Zadvydas found \nambiguity in §1231(a)(6). \nZadvydas’s reasoning is particularly inapt here because \nthere  is  a  specific  provision  authorizing  release  from \n§1225(b) detention whereas no similar release provision \napplies to §1231(a)(6).  With a few exceptions not relevant \nhere, the Attorney General may “for urgent humanitarian\nreasons or significant public benefit” temporarily parole \naliens detained under §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2).  8 U. S. C. \n§1182(d)(5)(A).  That express exception to detention im-\nplies that there are no other circumstances under which \naliens detained under §1225(b) may be released.  See A. \nScalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 107 (2012) (“Negative-\nImplication Canon[:] The expression of one thing implies \nthe  exclusion  of  others  (expressio  unius  est  exclusio  al-\nterius)”).

S. ____ (2018)  17 \nOpinion of the Court \nimplicit  time  limit  on  detention  that  we  found  in \nZadvydas.4 \nIn short, a series of textual signals distinguishes the \nprovisions at issue in this case from Zadvydas’s interpre-\ntation of §1231(a)(6).  While Zadvydas found §1231(a)(6) to \nbe ambiguous, the same cannot be said of §§1225(b)(1) and \n(b)(2): Both provisions mandate detention until a certain\npoint and authorize release prior to that point only under\nlimited circumstances.  As a result, neither provision can\nreasonably be read to limit detention to six months. \n2 \nIn this Court, respondents advance an interpretation of\nthe  language  of  §§1225(b)(1)  and  (b)(2)  that  was  never \nmade below, namely, that the term “for,” which appears in\nboth provisions, mandates detention only until the start of \napplicable proceedings rather than all the way through to\ntheir conclusion.  Respondents contrast the language of\n§§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) authorizing detention “for” further \nproceedings  with  another  provision’s  authorization  of \ndetention “pending” further proceedings.  See 8 U. S. C. \n§1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV)  (“Any  alien  . . .  shall  be  detained \npending a final determination of credible fear of persecu-\ntion and, if found not to have such a fear, until removed”).\nAccording to respondents, that distinction between “for”\nand “pending” makes an enormous difference.  As they see\nthings, the word “pending” authorizes detention through-\nout subsequent proceedings, but the term “for” means that\ndetention  authority  ends  once  subsequent  proceedings \n—————— \n4According to the dissent, we could have applied the expressio unius \ncanon in Zadvydas as well because there was also an “alternative \navenue for relief, namely, bail,” available for aliens detained under \n§1231(a)(6).  Post, at 25 (opinion of BREYER, J.).  But the dissent over-\nlooks the fact that the provision granting bail was precisely the same\nprovision that the Court purported to be interpreting, so the canon was \nnot applicable. See 533 U. S., at 683. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 23 of 92   Page ID\n #:9762\n18  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nbegin.  As a result, respondents argue, once the applicable \nproceedings commence, §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) no longer \nauthorize  detention,  and  the  Government  must  instead \nlook to §1226(a) for continued detention authority.\nThat interpretation is inconsistent with ordinary Eng-\nlish usage and is incompatible with the rest of the statute. \nTo be sure, “for” can sometimes mean “in preparation for \nor anticipation of.”  6 Oxford English Dictionary 24 (2d ed. \n1989).  But “for” can also mean “[d]uring [or] throughout,” \nid., at 26, as well as “with the object or purpose of,” id., at \n23;  see  also  American  Heritage  Dictionary  709  (3d  ed.\n1992) (“Used to indicate the object, aim, or purpose of an \naction or activity”; “Used to indicate amount, extent, or \nduration”); Random House Dictionary of the English Lan-\nguage 747 (2d ed. 1987) (“with the object or purpose of ”;\n“during the continuance of ”); Webster’s Third New Inter-\nnational Dictionary 886 (1993) (“with the purpose or object \nof ”; “to the . . . duration of ”).  And here, only that second\nset of definitions makes sense in the context of the statu-\ntory scheme as a whole.\nFor  example,  respondents  argue  that,  once  detention\nauthority ends under §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2), aliens can be\ndetained only under §1226(a).  But that section authorizes \ndetention only “[o]n a warrant issued” by the Attorney\nGeneral leading to the alien’s arrest.  §1226(a).  If re-\nspondents’ interpretation of §1225(b) were correct, then\nthe Government could detain an alien without a warrant \nat the border, but once removal proceedings began, the \nAttorney General would have to issue an arrest warrant in\norder to continue detaining the alien.  To put it lightly, \nthat makes little sense. \nNor does respondents’ interpretation of the word “for”\nalign with the way Congress has historically used that \nword in §1225.  Consider that section’s text prior to the \nenactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immi-\ngrant  Responsibility  Act  of  1996,  110  Stat.  3009–546. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 24 of 92   Page ID\n #:9763\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  19 \nOpinion of the Court \nUnder the older version of §1225(b), “[e]very alien” within\nits scope “who may not appear . . . to be clearly and beyond \na doubt entitled to [entry] shall be detained for further\ninquiry to be conducted by a special inquiry officer.”  8 \nU. S. C. §1225(b) (1994 ed.).  It would make no sense to \nread “for further inquiry” as authorizing detention of the \nalien only until the start of the inquiry; Congress obviously \ndid not mean to allow aliens to feel free to leave once \nimmigration officers asked their first question.\nIn sum, §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) mandate detention of\naliens throughout the completion of applicable proceedings \nand not just until the moment those proceedings begin.  Of \ncourse,  other  provisions  of  the  immigration  statutes  do\nauthorize detention “pending” other proceedings or “until” \na certain point.  See post, at 22–23 (BREYER, J., dissenting) \n(quoting §1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV)).  But there is no “canon of \ninterpretation  that  forbids  interpreting  different  words \nused in different parts of the same statute to mean roughly \nthe same thing.”  Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., \n568 U. S. 519, 540 (2013).  We decline to invent and apply\nsuch a canon here. \nB \nWhile the language of §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) is quite\nclear, §1226(c) is even clearer.  As noted, §1226 applies to\naliens  already  present  in  the  United  States.    Section \n1226(a) creates a default rule for those aliens by permit-\nting—but  not  requiring—the  Attorney  General  to  issue \nwarrants for their arrest and detention pending removal\nproceedings.  Section 1226(a) also permits the Attorney \nGeneral to release those aliens on bond, “[e]xcept as pro-\nvided in subsection (c) of this section.”  Section 1226(c) in\nturn  states  that  the  Attorney  General  “shall  take  into \ncustody any alien” who falls into one of the enumerated\ncategories involving criminal offenses and terrorist activi-\nties.  8 U. S. C. §1226(c)(1).  Section 1226(c) then goes on \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 25 of 92   Page ID\n #:9764\n20  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nto specify that the Attorney General “may release” one of \nthose aliens “only if the Attorney General decides” both \nthat doing so is necessary for witness-protection purposes \nand that the alien will not pose a danger or flight risk.\n§1226(c)(2) (emphasis added). \nLike §1225(b), §1226(c) does not on its face limit the\nlength of the detention it authorizes.  In fact, by allowing\naliens to be released “only if ” the Attorney General de-\ncides that certain conditions are met, §1226(c) reinforces\nthe conclusion that aliens detained under its authority are\nnot entitled to be released under any circumstances other \nthan those expressly recognized by the statute.  And to-\ngether with §1226(a), §1226(c) makes clear that detention \nof aliens within its scope must continue “pending a deci-\nsion on whether the alien is to be removed from the United \nStates.”  §1226(a).\nIn a reprise of their interpretation of §1225(b), respond-\nents argue, and the Court of Appeals held, that §1226(c) \nshould be interpreted to include an implicit 6-month time\nlimit on the length of mandatory detention.  Once again,\nthat interpretation falls far short of a “plausible statutory\nconstruction.” \nIn defense of their statutory reading, respondents first \nargue that §1226(c)’s “silence” as to the length of detention \n“cannot be construed to authorize prolonged mandatory \ndetention, because Congress must use ‘clearer terms’ to \nauthorize ‘long-term detention.’”  Brief for Respondents 34\n(quoting Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 697).  But §1226(c) is not \n“silent” as to the length of detention.  It mandates deten-\ntion  “pending  a  decision  on  whether  the  alien  is  to  be\nremoved from the United States,” §1226(a), and it expressly \nprohibits release from that detention except for narrow,\nwitness-protection purposes.  Even if courts were permit-\nted to fashion 6-month time limits out of statutory silence,\nthey  certainly  may  not  transmute  existing  statutory\nlanguage  into  its  polar  opposite.    The  constitutional-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 26 of 92   Page ID\n #:9765\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  21 \nOpinion of the Court \navoidance  canon  does  not  countenance  such  textual \nalchemy.\nIndeed,  we  have  held  as  much  in  connection  with \n§1226(c) itself.  In Demore v. Kim, 538 U. S., at 529, we \ndistinguished  §1226(c)  from  the  statutory  provision  in \nZadvydas by pointing out that detention under §1226(c) \nhas “a definite termination point”: the conclusion of re-\nmoval proceedings.  As we made clear there, that “definite \ntermination  point”—and  not  some  arbitrary  time  limit \ndevised  by  courts—marks  the  end  of  the  Government’s\ndetention authority under §1226(c). \nRespondents  next  contend  that  §1226(c)’s  limited  au-\nthorization  for  release  for  witness-protection  purposes\ndoes not imply that other forms of release are forbidden,\nbut this argument defies the statutory text.  By expressly \nstating that the covered aliens may be released “only if ” \ncertain  conditions  are  met,  8  U. S. C.  §1226(c)(2),  the \nstatute expressly and unequivocally imposes an affirma-\ntive prohibition on releasing detained aliens under any \nother conditions. \nFinally, respondents point to a provision enacted as part\nof the PATRIOT Act5 and contend that their reading of\n§1226(c) is needed to prevent that provision from being \nsuperfluous.   That  argument,  however,  misreads  both\nstatutory provisions.  Although the two provisions overlap \nin part, they are by no means congruent.\nTwo  differences  stand  out.    First,  §1226(c)  and  the\nPATRIOT Act cover different categories of aliens.  Both \napply  to  certain  terrorist  suspects,  but  only  §1226(c) \nreaches aliens convicted of other more common criminal \noffenses.  See §§1226(c)(1)(A)–(C) (aliens inadmissible or \ndeportable  under  §1182(a)(2);  §§1227(a)(2)(A)(ii),  (A)(iii), \n—————— \n5See Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate\nTools  Required  to  Intercept  and  Obstruct  Terrorism  Act  of  2001 \n(PATRIOT Act), 115 Stat. 272. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 27 of 92   Page ID\n #:9766\n22  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \n(B), (C), and (D); and §1227(a)(2)(A)(i) under certain condi-\ntions).  For its part, the PATRIOT Act casts a wider net \nthan §1226(c) insofar as it encompasses certain threats \nto  national  security  not  covered  by  §1226(c).    See \n§1226a(a)(3)  (aliens  described  in  §§1182(a)(3)(A)(i),  (iii), \nand 1227(a)(4)(A)(i), (iii), as well as aliens “engaged in any \nother activity that endangers the national security of the \nUnited States”).  In addition, the Government’s detention \nauthority under §1226(c) and the PATRIOT Act is not the \nsame.  Under §1226(c), the Government must detain an\nalien until “a decision on whether the alien is to be re-\nmoved” is made.  §1226(a) (emphasis added).  But, subject \nto exceptions not relevant here, the PATRIOT Act author-\nizes the Government to detain an alien “until the alien is \nremoved.”  §1226a(a)(2) (emphasis added). \nFar  from  being  redundant,  then,  §1226(c)  and  the\nPATRIOT  Act  apply  to  different  categories  of  aliens  in \ndifferent ways.  There is thus no reason to depart from the\nplain meaning of §1226(c) in order to avoid making the \nprovision superfluous.\nWe hold that §1226(c) mandates detention of any alien\nfalling within its scope and that detention may end prior \nto the conclusion of removal proceedings “only if ” the alien \nis released for witness-protection purposes. \nC \nFinally,  as  noted,  §1226(a)  authorizes  the  Attorney\nGeneral to arrest and detain an alien “pending a decision\non whether the alien is to be removed from the United \nStates.”  §1226(a).  As long as the detained alien is not \ncovered by §1226(c), the Attorney General “may release” \nthe alien on “bond . . . or conditional parole.”  §1226(a). \nFederal  regulations  provide  that  aliens  detained  under \n§1226(a) receive bond hearings at the outset of detention.\nSee 8 CFR §§236.1(d)(1), 1236.1(d)(1). \nThe Court of Appeals ordered the Government to pro-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 28 of 92   Page ID\n #:9767\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  23 \nOpinion of the Court \nvide procedural protections that go well beyond the initial\nbond hearing established by existing regulations—namely, \nperiodic  bond  hearings  every  six  months  in  which  the \nAttorney  General  must  prove  by  clear  and  convincing\nevidence that the alien’s continued detention is necessary.\nNothing  in  §1226(a)’s  text—which  says  only  that  the\nAttorney General “may release” the alien “on . . . bond”—\neven remotely supports the imposition of either of those\nrequirements.  Nor does §1226(a)’s text even hint that the\nlength of detention prior to a bond hearing must specifically \nbe considered in determining whether the alien should be\nreleased. \nIV \nFor these reasons, the meaning of the relevant statutory \nprovisions is clear—and clearly contrary to the decision of \nthe Court of Appeals.  But the dissent is undeterred.  It \nbegins by ignoring the statutory language for as long as\npossible, devoting the first two-thirds of its opinion to a \ndisquisition  on  the  Constitution.    Only  after  a  19-page\nprologue does the dissent acknowledge the relevant statu-\ntory provisions. \nThe  dissent  frames  the  question  of  interpretation  as\nfollows: Can §§1225(b), 1226(c), and 1226(a) be read to \nrequire bond hearings every six months “without doing \nviolence to the statutory language,” post, at 20 (opinion of \nBREYER, J.)?  According to the dissent, the answer is “yes,”\nbut the dissent evidently has a strong stomach when it\ncomes to inflicting linguistic trauma.  Thus, when Con-\ngress  mandated  that  an  “alien  shall  be  detained,” \n§1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), what Congress really meant, the dissent\ninsists, is that the alien may be released from custody \nprovided only that his freedom of movement is restricted\nin some way, such as by “the imposition of a curfew,” post,\nat 21.  And when Congress stressed that “[t]he Attorney\nGeneral may release an alien . . . only if . . . release . . . \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 29 of 92   Page ID\n #:9768\n24  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nfrom custody is necessary” to protect the safety of a wit-\nness, §1226(c)(2) (emphasis added), what Congress meant, \nthe dissent tells us, is that the Attorney General must \nrelease an alien even when no witness is in need of protec-\ntion—so long as the alien is neither a flight risk nor a\ndanger to the community, see post, at 25–27.  The contor-\ntions needed to reach these remarkable conclusions are a \nsight to behold.\nLet us start with the simple term “detain.”  According to\nthe dissent, “detain” means the absence of “unrestrained \nfreedom.”  Post, at 21.  An alien who is subject to any one\nof  “numerous  restraints”—including  “a  requirement  to \nobtain medical treatment,” “to report at regular intervals,”\nor even simply to comply with “a curfew”—is “detained” in\nthe dissent’s eyes, even if that alien is otherwise free to\nroam the streets.  Ibid. \nThis interpretation defies ordinary English usage.  The \ndictionary cited by the dissent, the Oxford English Dic-\ntionary (OED), defines “detain” as follows: “[t]o keep in\nconfinement or under restraint; to keep prisoner.”  4 OED \n543  (2d  ed.  1989)  (emphasis  added);  see  also  OED  (3d \ned.  2012),  http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/51176  (same).\nOther general-purpose dictionaries provide similar defini-\ntions.

S. ____ (2018)  25 \nOpinion of the Court \nHow does the dissent attempt to evade the clear mean-\ning of “detain”?  It resorts to the legal equivalent of a\nsleight-of-hand trick.  First, the dissent cites a passage in \nBlackstone stating that arrestees could always seek re-\nlease on bail.  Post, at 8–9.  Then, having established the \nobvious point that a person who is initially detained may \nlater be released from detention, the dissent reasons that \nthis means that a person may still be regarded as detained \neven after he is released from custody.  Post, at 21.  That, \nof course, is a nonsequitur.  Just because a person who is\ninitially detained may later be released, it does not follow \nthat the person is still “detained” after his period of deten-\ntion comes to an end. \nIf there were any doubt about the meaning of the term \n“detain” in the relevant statutory provisions, the context \nin which they appear would put that doubt to rest.  Title 8 \nof the United States Code, the title dealing with immigra-\ntion, is replete with references that distinguish between \n“detained”  aliens  and  aliens  who  are  free  to  walk  the \nstreets in the way the dissent imagines.  Section 1226(a),\nfor instance, distinguishes between the power to “continue\nto detain the arrested alien” and the power to “release the \nalien on . . . bond.”  But if the dissent were right, that\ndistinction would make no sense: An “alien released on \nbond” would also be a “detained alien.”  Here is another \nexample: In §1226(b), Congress gave the Attorney General\nthe power to “revoke” at any time “a bond or parole au-\nthorized under subsection (a) of this section, rearrest the \nalien under the original warrant, and detain the alien.”  It \nbeggars belief that Congress would have given the Attor-\nney General the power to detain a class of aliens who, \nunder  the  dissent’s  reading,  are  already  “detained”  be-\ncause they are free on bond.  But that is what the dissent \nwould have us believe.  Consider, finally, the example of \n§1226(c).  As noted, that provision obligates the Attorney \nGeneral  to  “take  into  custody”  certain  aliens  whenever \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 31 of 92   Page ID\n #:9770\n26  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nthey are “released, without regard to whether the alien is \nreleased on parole, supervised release, or probation.”  On \nthe  dissent’s  view,  however,  even  aliens  “released  on \nparole, supervised release, or probation” are “in custody”—\nand so there would be no need for the Attorney General to\ntake them into custody again.6 \nStruggling to prop up its implausible interpretation, the \ndissent looks to our prior decisions for aid, but that too \nfails.  The best case it can find is Tod v. Waldman, 266 \nU. S. 547 (1925), a grant of a petition for rehearing in \nwhich the Court clarified that “[n]othing in [its original] \norder . . . shall prejudice an application for release on bail \nof the respondents pending compliance with the mandate\nof this Court.”  Id., at 548.  According to the dissent, that\ntwo-page decision from almost a century ago supports its\nreading  because  the  underlying  immigration  statute  in \nthat  case—like  some  of  the  provisions  at  issue  here—\nmandated that the relevant class of aliens “‘shall be de-\ntained’”  pending  the  outcome  of  an  inspection  process. \n—————— \n6As the dissent notes, §1158(d)(2) regulates employment authoriza-\ntion for certain “applicant[s] for asylum.”  Were all asylum applicants\ndetained, the dissent says, that provision would make no sense, because \ndetained aliens do not need work authorizations.  Post, at 23–24.  But \n§1158(d)(2) applies not only to aliens seeking asylum status “in accord-\nance with . . . section 1225(b)” (and thus aliens who are detained), but\nalso to all aliens already “physically present in the United States.” \n§1158(a)(1).  Many of those aliens will be in the country lawfully, and\nthus they will not be detained and will be able to work pending the\noutcome of their asylum application.  For example, an alien may apply\nfor asylum after being admitted into the country on a short-term visa. \nWhile the application is pending, §1158 may offer a way for that alien\nto find employment.\nIn response, the dissent accuses us of “apply[ing] this provision to \nsome asylum applicants but not the ones before us.”  Post, at 23–24. \nThat  is  not  remotely  what  we  are  doing.    We  do  not  doubt  that \n§1158(d)(2) “applies” to all “applicant[s] for asylum” as it says, even if \nsome of those applicants are not as likely to receive an employment \nauthorization (for instance, because they are detained) as others. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 32 of 92   Page ID\n #:9771\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  27 \nOpinion of the Court \nSee post, at 21–22 (quoting Act of Feb. 5, 1917, §16, 39\nStat. 886).\nThat reads far too much into Waldman.  To start, the \nCourt did not state that the aliens at issue were entitled to \nbail or even that bail was available to them.  Instead, the \nCourt merely noted that its decision should not “prejudice”\nany application the aliens might choose to file.  That is \nnotable, for in their petition for rehearing the aliens had \nasked the Court to affirmatively “authorize [them] to give \nbail.”  Petition for Rehearing in Tod v. Waldman, O.T. \n1924, No. 95, p. 17 (emphasis added).  By refusing to do so, \nthe Court may have been signaling its skepticism about\ntheir request.  But it is impossible to tell.   That is precisely \nwhy we, unlike the dissent, choose not to go beyond what \nthe sentence actually says.  And Waldman says nothing \nabout how the word “detain” should be read in the context \nof §§1225(b), 1226(c), and 1226(a).7\n  Neither does Zadvydas.  It is true, as the dissent points \nout, that Zadvydas found “that the words ‘“may be de-\ntained”’ [are] consistent with requiring release from long-\nterm detention,” post, at 23 (quoting 533 U. S., at 682), but \nthat is not because there is any ambiguity in the term\n“detain.”  As we have explained, the key statutory provi-\nsion in Zadvydas said that the aliens in question “may,” \nnot “shall,” be detained, and that provision also failed to\nspecify how long detention was to last.  Here, the statutory \nprovisions  at  issue  state  either  that  the  covered  aliens\n“shall” be detained until specified events take place, see 8 \nU. S. C.  §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii)  (“further  consideration  of  the \n—————— \n7It should not be surprising by this point that even the aliens in \nWaldman understood “detention” in contradistinction to “bail.”  See \nPetition for Rehearing in Tod v.

RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \napplication  for  asylum”);  §1225(b)(2)(A)  (“a  [removal] \nproceeding”), or provide that the covered aliens may be\nreleased “only if ” specified conditions are met, §1226(c)(2).\nThe term that the Zadvydas Court found to be ambiguous \nwas “may,” not “detain.”  See 533 U. S., at 697.  And the \nopinion in that case consistently used the words “detain” \nand “custody” to refer exclusively to physical confinement\nand restraint.  See id., at 690 (referring to “[f]reedom from\nimprisonment—from  government  custody,  detention,  or \nother forms of physical restraint” (emphasis added)); id., at \n683 (contrasting aliens “released on bond” with those “held \nin custody”).8 \nThe  dissent  offers  no  plausible  interpretation  of \n§§1225(b), 1226(c), and 1226(a).  But even if we were to \naccept  the  dissent’s  interpretation  and  hold  that  “de-\ntained” aliens in the “custody” of the Government include\naliens released on bond, that would still not justify the \ndissent’s proposed resolution of this case.  The Court of \nAppeals held that aliens detained under the provisions at\nissue must be given periodic bond hearings, and the dis-\nsent agrees.  See post, at 2 (“I would interpret the statute\nas requiring bail hearings, presumptively after six months\nof  confinement”).  But  the  dissent  draws  that  6-month \nlimitation out of thin air.  However broad its interpreta-\ntion of the words “detain” and “custody,” nothing in any of \nthe relevant provisions imposes a 6-month time limit on \ndetention without the possibility of bail.  So if the dissent’s \ninterpretation  is  right,  then  aliens  detained  under \n§§1225(b), 1226(c), and 1226(a) are entitled to bail hear-\nings  as  soon  as  their  detention  begins  rather  than  six \n—————— \n8The dissent argues that because “the question at issue [in Zadvydas]\nwas release from detention,” “the key word was consequently ‘may.’ ” \nPost, at 23. We agree but fail to see the point.  If, as the dissent admits, \nZadvydas  was  about  “release  from  detention”  and  not  about  what \nqualifies as “detention,” then it is unclear why the dissent thinks that\ndecision supports its unorthodox interpretation of the word “detention.” \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 34 of 92   Page ID\n #:9773\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  29 \nOpinion of the Court \nmonths  later.  “Detained”  does  not  mean  “released \non  bond,”  and  it  certainly  does  not  mean  “released  on \nbond  but  only  after  six  months  of  mandatory  physical\nconfinement.” \nThe dissent’s utterly implausible interpretation of the \nstatutory  language  cannot  support  the  decision  of  the \ncourt below. \nV \nBecause  the  Court  of  Appeals  erroneously  concluded\nthat periodic bond hearings are required under the immi-\ngration  provisions  at  issue  here,  it  had  no  occasion  to \nconsider  respondents’  constitutional  arguments  on  their\nmerits.  Consistent with our role as “a court of review, not \nof first view,” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 \n(2005), we do not reach those arguments.  Instead, we \nremand the case to the Court of Appeals to consider them \nin the first instance. \nBefore  the  Court  of  Appeals  addresses  those  claims, \nhowever,  it  should  reexamine  whether  respondents  can\ncontinue  litigating  their  claims  as  a  class.    When  the \nDistrict Court certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, it had their statutory \nchallenge primarily in mind.  Now that we have resolved \nthat challenge, however, new questions emerge.\nSpecifically,  the  Court  of  Appeals  should  first  decide\nwhether it continues to have jurisdiction despite 8 U. S. C.\n§1252(f)(1).  Under that provision, “no court (other than \nthe Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to\nenjoin  or  restrain  the  operation  of  [§§1221–1232]  other \nthan with respect to the application of such provisions to \nan individual alien against whom proceedings under such\npart have been initiated.”  Section 1252(f)(1) thus “prohib-\nits federal courts from granting classwide injunctive relief \nagainst the operation of §§1221–123[2].”  American-Arab \nAnti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S., at 481.  The Court \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 35 of 92   Page ID\n #:9774\n30  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nof Appeals held that this provision did not affect its juris-\ndiction over respondents’ statutory claims because those \nclaims did not “seek to enjoin the operation of the immi-\ngration detention statutes, but to enjoin conduct . . . not \nauthorized by the statutes.”  591 F. 3d, at 1120.  This \nreasoning does not seem to apply to an order granting \nrelief on constitutional grounds, and therefore the Court of \nAppeals should consider on remand whether it may issue \nclasswide injunctive relief based on respondents’ constitu-\ntional claims.  If not, and if the Court of Appeals concludes \nthat it may issue only declaratory relief, then the Court of\nAppeals should decide whether that remedy can sustain\nthe class on its own.  See, e. g., Rule 23(b)(2) (requiring \n“that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\nrelief  [be]  appropriate  respecting  the  class  as  a  whole” \n(emphasis added)).\nThe Court of Appeals should also consider whether a \nRule 23(b)(2) class action continues to be the appropriate \nvehicle for respondents’ claims in light of Wal-Mart Stores, \nInc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. 338 (2011).  We held in Dukes that \n“Rule  23(b)(2)  applies  only  when  a  single  injunction  or \ndeclaratory judgment would provide relief to each member \nof the class.”  Id., at 360.  That holding may be relevant on \nremand  because  the  Court  of  Appeals  has  already\nacknowledged that some members of the certified class \nmay not be entitled to bond hearings as a constitutional \nmatter.  See, e. g., 804 F. 3d, at 1082; 715 F. 3d, at 1139– \n1141 (citing, e. g., Shaughnessy  v. United  States ex rel. \nMezei, 345 U. S. 206 (1953)).  Assuming that is correct, \nthen  it  may  no  longer  be  true  that  the  complained-of \n“‘conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared un-\nlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of\nthem.’”  Dukes, supra, at 360 (quoting Nagareda, Class \nCertification  in  the  Age  of  Aggregate  Proof,  84 \nN.

S. ____ (2018)  3 \nOpinion of THOMAS, J. \nII \nA  \nAlthough  neither  party  raises  §1252(b)(9),  this  Court \nhas an “independent obligation” to assess whether it de-\nprives us and the lower courts of jurisdiction.  Arbaugh v. \nY & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006).  This Court has \ndescribed §1252(b)(9) as a “‘zipper’ clause.”  See Reno v. \nAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, \n483 (1999) (AADC); INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 313 \n(2001).  That description is apt because, when an alien\nraises a claim related to his removal, §1252(b)(9) closes all\nbut two avenues for judicial review: \n“Consolidation of questions for judicial review\n“Judicial review of all questions of law and fact, in-\ncluding  interpretation  and  application  of  constitu-\ntional and statutory provisions, arising from any action\ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from\nthe  United  States  under  [8  U.

Except as otherwise provided \nin this section, no court shall have jurisdiction, by ha-\nbeas corpus under section 2241 of title 28 or any other\nhabeas corpus provision, by section 1361 or 1651 of\nsuch title, or by any other provision of law (statutory\nor  nonstatutory),  to  review  such  an  order  or  such \nquestions of law or fact.”  (Emphasis added.) \nThe text of this provision is clear.  Courts generally lack\njurisdiction over “all questions of law and fact,” both “con-\nstitutional” and “statutory,” that “aris[e] from” an “action \ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien.”  If an \nalien raises a claim arising from such an action or proceed-\ning, courts cannot review it unless they are reviewing “a\nfinal  order”  under  §1252(a)(1)  or  exercising  jurisdiction \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 40 of 92   Page ID\n #:9779\n4  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of THOMAS, J. \n“otherwise provided” in §1252.2  Neither “habeas corpus” \nnor  “any  other  provision  of  law”  can  be  used  to  avoid \n§1252(b)(9)’s jurisdictional bar.  In short, if a claim arises \nfrom an action taken to remove an alien, §1252(b)(9) per-\nmits judicial review in only two circumstances: in connec-\ntion with review of a final removal order and via a specific \ngrant of jurisdiction in §1252.\nRespondents  do  not  argue  that  any  specific  grant  of\njurisdiction applies here, and they do not seek review of a \nfinal removal order under §1252(a)(1).  Thus, a court may \nreview  respondents’  claims  only  if  they  can  show  that\n§1252(b)(9)’s jurisdictional bar does not apply in the first\nplace because their claims do not “aris[e] from any action \ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien.”\nRespondents  cannot  make  that  showing.    Section \n1252(b)(9)  is  a  “general  jurisdictional  limitation”  that\napplies  to “all  claims  arising  from  deportation  proceed-\nings” and the “many . . . decisions or actions that may be \npart of the deportation process.”  AADC, supra, at 482– \n483.  Detaining  an  alien  falls  within  this  definition—\nindeed, this Court has described detention during removal\nproceedings  as  an  “aspect  of  the  deportation  process.” \nDemore v. Kim, 538 U. S. 510, 523 (2003); see also Carlson \nv. Landon, 342 U. S. 524, 538 (1952) (“Detention is neces-\nsarily a part of [the] deportation procedure”).  As the Court \nexplains today, Congress either mandates or permits the\ndetention of aliens for the entire duration of their removal \nproceedings.  See  ante,  at  12–23.    This  detention,  the \n—————— \n2Section 1252 provides a few specific grants of jurisdiction beyond\n§1252(a)(1)'s general grant of jurisdiction over final removal orders and\nall other related questions of law and fact.  Section 1252(b)(7), for\nexample, allows an alien to challenge the validity of his removal order \nduring criminal proceedings if he is charged with willfully failing to \ndepart the United States.  And §1252(e)(2) allows an alien who is\ndenied admission to the United States and ordered removed to raise \ncertain claims in habeas corpus proceedings. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 41 of 92   Page ID\n #:9780\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  5 \nOpinion of THOMAS, J. \nCourt further explains, is meant to ensure that the Gov-\nernment  can  ultimately  remove  them.  See  ante,  at  1; \naccord, Demore, supra, at 528 (explaining that detention\nduring removal proceedings “necessarily serves the pur-\npose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing \nprior to or during their removal proceedings, thus increas-\ning the chance that, if ordered removed, the aliens will be \nsuccessfully removed”).  The phrase “any action taken . . . \nto remove an alien from the United States” must at least \ncover congressionally authorized portions of the deporta-\ntion process that necessarily serve the purpose of ensuring \nan alien’s removal.  Claims challenging detention during \nremoval  proceedings  thus  fall  within  the  heartland  of \n§1252(b)(9). \nB \nThe plurality, the dissent, and respondents each offer\nreasons why §1252(b)(9) does not apply to this case.  The \nplurality reasons that applying §1252(b)(9) to detention \nclaims requires an overly expansive reading of “arising \nfrom.”  See  ante,  at  9–10.  The  dissent  contends  that \n§1252(b)(9) applies only to challenges to the removal order \nitself.  Post,  at  31.    And  respondents  argue  that,  if \n§1252(b)(9)  applies  to  their  claims,  they  will  have  no\nmeaningful way to challenge their detention during their \nremoval proceedings.3  Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.  But our “independent obligation” to evalu-\nate jurisdiction, Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006),\nmeans that we cannot accept the Government’s concessions on this \npoint. See King Bridge Co. v. Otoe County, 120 U.

RODRIGUEZ \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \nents’ claims only if the words “arising from” are given an \n“expansive interpretation.”  Ante, at 9.  I am of a different \nview.  Even if “arising from” is read narrowly, §1252(b)(9)\nstill covers the claims at issue in this case.  That is be-\ncause  detention  is  an  “action  taken  . . .  to  remove”  an \nalien.  And even the narrowest reading of “arising from”\nmust  cover  claims  that  directly  challenge  such  actions. \nSee AADC, 525 U. S., at 482–483. \nThe main precedent that the plurality cites to support \nits  narrow  reading  of  “arising  from”  demonstrates  that\n§1252(b)(9) applies here.  See ante, at 10 (citing AADC, \n525 U. S., at 482–483).  In AADC, the Court explained\nthat §1252(b)(9) covers “all claims arising from deporta-\ntion proceedings” and the “many . . . decisions or actions \nthat may be part of the deportation process.”  Ibid.  The \nCourt  even  listed  examples  of  the  type  of  claims  that \nwould be covered, including challenges to the decision “to\nopen  an  investigation”  and  the  decision  “to  surveil  the \nsuspected  [immigration-law]  violator.”  Id.,  at  482.  If \nsurveilling a  suspected  violator  falls  under the  statute, \nthen the detention of a known violator certainly does as\nwell. \nThe plurality dismisses my “expansive interpretation” \nbecause it would lead to “staggering results,” supposedly \nbarring claims that are far afield from removal.  See ante, \nat 9 (describing lawsuits challenging inhumane conditions \nof confinement, assaults, and negligent driving).  But that \nis not the case.  Unlike detention during removal proceed-\nings, those actions are neither congressionally authorized \nnor meant to ensure that an alien can be removed.  Thus, \nmy conclusion that §1252(b)(9) covers an alien’s challenge\nto the fact of his detention (an action taken in pursuit of \nthe lawful objective of removal) says nothing about whether \nit  also  covers  claims  about  inhumane  treatment,  as-\nsaults,  or  negligently  inflicted  injuries  suffered  during \ndetention (actions that go beyond the Government’s lawful \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 43 of 92   Page ID\n #:9782\nCite as: 583 U.

S. 520, 536–539 (1979) (drawing a similar distinction). \n2 \nThe dissent takes a different approach.  Relying on the\nprefatory clause to §1252(b), it asserts that §1252(b)(9) “by \nits terms applies only ‘[w]ith respect to review of an order\nof removal under [§1252(a)(1)].’”  Post, at 31 (quoting 8 \nU. S. C. §1252(b)).  The dissent reads the prefatory clause \nto  mean  that  §1252(b)(9)  applies  only  to  a  “challenge \n[to] an order of removal.”  Post, at 31.  That reading is \nincorrect. \nSection  1252(b)(9)  is  not  restricted  to  challenges  to \nremoval orders.  The text refers to review of “all questions\nof law and fact” arising from removal, not just removal \norders.  (Emphasis  added.)  And  it  specifies  that \n§1252(a)(1) provides the only means for reviewing “such\nan order or such questions of law or fact.”  Ibid. (emphasis\nadded).  The term “or” is “‘almost always disjunctive, that\nis, the words it connects are to be given separate mean-\nings.’”  Loughrin v. United States, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) \n(slip op., at 6) (quoting United States v. Woods, 571 U. S. \n31, 45–46 (2013)).  By interpreting §1252(b)(9) as govern-\ning only removal orders, the dissent reads “or such ques-\ntions of law or fact” out of the statute.  It also renders \nsuperfluous §1252(a)(5), which already specifies that the\nreview made available under §1252(a)(1) “shall be the sole \nand  exclusive  means  for  judicial  review  of  an  order  of \nremoval.”  This Court typically disfavors such interpreta-\ntions.  See AADC, supra, at 483. \nThe prefatory clause of §1252(b) does not change the\nmeaning of §1252(b)(9).  The prefatory clause states that \nthe  subparagraphs  of  §1252(b),  including  §1252(b)(9),\nimpose requirements “[w]ith respect to review of an order\nof  removal  under  subsection  (a)(1).”  The  phrase  “with\nrespect to” means “referring to,” “concerning,” or “relating \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 44 of 92   Page ID\n #:9783\n8  JENNINGS v.

Read together, the prefatory clause\nand §1252(b)(9) mean that review of all questions arising \nfrom removal must occur in connection with review of a \nfinal removal order under §1252(a)(1), which makes sense \ngiven  that  §1252(b)(9)  is  meant  to  “[c]onsolidat[e]  . . . \nquestions for judicial review.”  Tellingly, on the two previ-\nous occasions when this Court interpreted §1252(b)(9), it \ndid not understand §1252(b)(9) as limited to challenges to\nremoval orders.  See AADC, supra, at 482–483 (stating \nthat  §1252(b)(9)  is  a  “general  jurisdictional  limitation”\nthat applies to “all claims arising from deportation pro-\nceedings” and “the many . . . decisions or actions that may\nbe part of the deportation process”); St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at \n313, n. 37 (clarifying that §1252(b)(9) requires “claims that\nwere viewed as being outside of a ‘final order’” to be “con-\nsolidated in a petition for review and considered by the\ncourts  of  appeals”  in  their  review  of  the  final  removal\norder under §1252(a)(1)).  Thus,  despite  the  dissent’s \nassertion to the contrary, the prefatory clause plainly does\nnot  change  the  scope  of  §1252(b)(9),  which  covers  “all \nquestions of law or fact” arising from the removal process. \n3 \nAt  oral  argument,  respondents  asserted  that,  if \n§1252(b)(9) bars their lawsuit, then the only review avail-\nable would be “a petition for review of [a] final removal \norder” under §1252(a)(1), which takes place “after all the \ndetention has already happened.”4  Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.

This argument is \nunpersuasive and foreclosed by precedent.\nThe Constitution does not guarantee litigants the most \neffective means of judicial review for every type of claim \nthey  want  to  raise.    See AADC,  525  U. S.,  at  487–492 \n(rejecting  a  similar  argument);  Heikkila  v.  Barber,  345 \nU. S. 229, 237 (1953) (explaining that limitations on judi-\ncial review of deportation must be followed “despite [their]\napparent inconvenience to the alien”).  This is especially\ntrue in the context of deportation, where limits on the\ncourts’  jurisdiction  have  existed  for  almost  as  long  as\nfederal immigration laws, and where this Court has re-\npeatedly affirmed the constitutionality of those limits.5 \nIndeed, this Court has already rejected essentially the\nsame argument that respondents raise here.  In AADC, \nthe  Court  held  that  §1252(g),  a  provision  similar  to \n§1252(b)(9), barred the aliens’ claim that the Government \nwas violating the First Amendment by selectively enforc-\n—————— \nto obtain review of their detention before it is complete.

RODRIGUEZ \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \ning the immigration laws against them.  525 U. S., at 487– \n492.  The  aliens  argued  that  constitutional  avoidance \nrequired the Court to interpret §1252(g) as not applying to \ntheir claims because the only remaining avenue for re-\nview—a petition for review of a final removal order under \n§1252(a)(1)—would be “unavailing” and would “come too \nlate  to  prevent  the  ‘chilling  effect’  upon  their  First\nAmendment rights.”  Id., at 487–488.  The Court rejected \nthis argument because “an alien unlawfully in this coun-\ntry has no constitutional right to assert selective enforce-\nment as a defense against his deportation.”  Id., at 488. \nThe Court further explained that it had a duty to enforce \nCongress’ limitations on judicial review, except perhaps in \n“a rare case in which the alleged basis of discrimination is\nso outrageous that the foregoing considerations [justifying \nlimited review could] be overcome.”  Id., at 491. \n  Like in AADC, respondents’ lack-of-meaningful-review \nargument does not allow us to ignore the jurisdictional\nlimitations that Congress has imposed.  This Court has \nnever held that detention during removal proceedings is\nunconstitutional.  To the contrary, this Court has repeat-\nedly recognized the constitutionality of that practice.  See \nDemore, 538 U. S., at 523 (explaining that detention is “a\nconstitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process”); \naccord,  Reno  v.  Flores,  507  U.

Nor does this \nlawsuit  qualify  as  the  “rare  case  in  which  the  alleged\n[executive action] is so outrageous” that it could thwart\nthe jurisdictional limitations in §1252(b)(9).  AADC, supra, \nat  491.  The  Government’s  detention  of  respondents  is \nentirely routine and indistinguishable from the detention\nthat we have repeatedly upheld in the past.

I, §9, cl. 2 (“The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas\nCorpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of \nRebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it”).  It \ndoes  not.  Even  assuming  the  Suspension  Clause  bars \nCongress from stripping habeas jurisdiction over respond-\nents’ claims, but see St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 337–346 (Sca- \nlia, J., dissenting), this case does not involve a habeas \npetition.\nRespondents do not seek habeas relief, as understood by \nour precedents.  Although their complaint references the \ngeneral habeas statute, see Third Amended Complaint, at\n1, it is not a habeas petition.  The complaint does not\nrequest that the District Court issue any writ.  See id., at \n31–32.  Rather, it seeks a declaration and an injunction\nthat would provide relief for both present and future class\nmembers,  including  future  class  members  not  yet  de-\ntained.  Ibid.  Indeed, respondents obtained class certifica-\ntion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), which \napplies only when the class seeks “final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief.”7 \n—————— \n6I take no position on whether some of the respondents will face other\njurisdictional hurdles, even on review of their final removal orders. \nSee, e.g., §§1252(a)(2)(A), (B).  I also continue to agree with Justice \nO’Connor’s concurring opinion in Demore v. Kim, 538 U. S. 510 (2003), \nwhich explained that §1226(e) “unequivocally deprives federal courts of \njurisdiction to set aside ‘any action or decision’ by the Attorney Gen-\neral” regarding detention.  Id., at 533 (opinion concurring in part and \nconcurring in judgment). \n7This Court has never addressed whether habeas relief can be pur-\nsued in a class action.  See Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 261, n. 10 \n(1984) (reserving this question).  I take no position on that issue here, \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 48 of 92   Page ID\n #:9787\n12  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of THOMAS, J. \nNor did respondents obtain habeas relief.  When their \ncase concluded, respondents obtained a classwide perma-\nnent injunction.  See Order, Judgment, and Permanent \nInjunction, at 5–6.  That classwide injunction looks noth-\ning like a typical writ.  It is not styled in the form of a \nconditional  or  unconditional  release  order.  Cf.  United \nStates v. Jung Ah Lung, 124 U. S. 621, 622 (1888) (de-\nscribing habeas relief as “order[ing] the discharge from\ncustody of the person in whose behalf the writ was sued\nout”); Chin Yow v. United States, 208 U. S. 8, 13 (1908)\n(awarding  habeas  relief  by  ordering  the  release  of  the \nalien if certain conditions were not satisfied).  It applies to\nfuture class members, including individuals who were not\nin custody when the injunction was issued.  Cf. 28 U. S. C. \n§2241(c) (generally precluding issuance of the writ unless\nthe petitioner is “in custody”).  And it is directed to at least \none individual, the Director for the Executive Office for \nImmigration Review, who is not a custodian.  Cf. Rumsfeld \nv. Padilla, 542 U. S. 426, 434 (2004) (explaining that “the \nproper respondent to a habeas petition is ‘the person who \nhas  custody  over  [the  petitioner]’”  (quoting  28  U. S. C. \n§2242)).\nImmigration law has long drawn a distinction between \nthe  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  that  respondents\nsought here and habeas relief.  In Heikkila, for instance, \nthis Court distinguished habeas relief from “injunctions,\ndeclaratory  judgments  and  other  types  of  relief ”  that \n“courts ha[d] consistently rejected” in immigration cases.\n345 U. S., at 230.  The Court rejected the alien’s request \nfor “injunctive and declaratory relief ” because Congress\nhad authorized courts to grant relief only in habeas pro-\nceedings.  Id., at 230, 237.  We reaffirmed this distinction \nin St. Cyr, where we noted that the 1961 Immigration and \n——————  \nsince I conclude that respondents are not seeking habeas relief in the  \nfirst place.  \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 49 of 92   Page ID\n #:9788\nCite as: 583 U.

S., at 309–310; see also Shaugh-\nnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U. S. 48, 49, 52–53 (1955) (holding \nthat the Administrative Procedure Act, which authorizes \ncourts to grant declaratory and injunctive relief, author-\nized “judicial review of deportation orders other than by \nhabeas  corpus”  (emphasis  added)).  And  Congress  has \nconfirmed this distinction in its immigration statutes by \nallowing one form of relief, but not the other, in particular\ncircumstances.    Compare,  e.g.,  §1252(e)(1)  (prohibiting \ncourts  from  granting  “declaratory,  injunctive,  or  other \nequitable relief in any action pertaining to an order to \nexclude an alien in accordance with section 1225(b)(1)”) \nwith §1252(e)(2) (allowing “judicial review . . . in habeas\ncorpus proceedings” of particular “determination[s] made \nunder section 1225(b)(1)”).\nRespondents’ suit for declaratory and injunctive relief,\nin sum, is not a habeas petition.  The Suspension Clause \nprotects “[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus,” not \nrequests for injunctive relief.  Because respondents have\nnot sought a writ of habeas corpus, applying §1252(b)(9) to \nbar their suit does not implicate the Suspension Clause. \n*  *  * \nBecause §1252(b)(9) deprives courts of jurisdiction over \nrespondents’ claims, we should have vacated the judgment\nbelow and remanded with instructions to dismiss this case \nfor lack of jurisdiction.

Each of these individuals believes he or \nshe has the right to enter or to remain within the United\nStates.  The question is whether several statutory provi-\nsions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U. S. C. \n§1101 et seq., forbid granting them bail. \nThe noncitizens at issue are asylum seekers, persons \nwho have finished serving a sentence of confinement (for a \ncrime), or individuals who, while lacking a clear entitle-\nment to enter the United States, claim to meet the criteria \nfor admission, see infra, at 20, 25–26, 29–30.  The Gov-\nernment has held all the members of the groups before us\nin  confinement  for  many  months,  sometimes  for  years, \nwhile it looks into or contests their claims.  But ultimately \nmany members of these groups win their claims and the\nGovernment  allows  them  to  enter  or  to  remain  in  the \nUnited States.  Does the statute require members of these \ngroups to receive a bail hearing, after, say, six months of\nconfinement, with the possibility of release on bail into the \ncommunity provided that they do not pose a risk of flight\nor a threat to the community’s safety? \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 51 of 92   Page ID\n #:9790\n2  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nThe Court reads the statute as forbidding bail, hence \nforbidding a bail hearing, for these individuals.  In my\nview, the majority’s interpretation of the statute would\nlikely render the statute unconstitutional.  Thus, I would \nfollow this Court’s longstanding practice of construing a \nstatute “so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is\nunconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score.” \nUnited States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394, 401 (1916). \nAnd I would interpret the statute as requiring bail hear-\nings, presumptively after six months of confinement.  Cf. \nZadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 701 (2001). \nI \nThe Respondents \nBecause of their importance to my conclusion, I shall\nrepeat, with references to record support, the key charac-\nteristics of the groups of noncitizens who appear before us. \nFirst, as I have said, the respondents in this case are\nmembers of three special classes of noncitizens, the most \nimportant of whom (1) arrive at our borders seeking asy-\nlum or (2) have committed crimes but have finished serv-\ning their sentences of imprisonment.  We also consider \nthose  who  (3)  arrive  at  our  borders  believing  they  are \nentitled to enter the United States for reasons other than \nasylum seeking, but lack a clear entitlement to enter. \nSecond,  all  members  of  the  first  group,  the  asylum \nseekers,  have  been  found  (by  an  immigration  official) \nto have a “credible fear of persecution” in their home coun-\ntry should the United States deny them admittance.  8 \nU. S. C.  §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  All  members  of  the  second \ngroup have, as I have said, finished serving their criminal \nsentences of confinement.  §1226(c)(1).  All members of the \nthird group may have (or may simply believe they have) a \nstrong claim for admittance, but they are neither “clearly \nand beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted” nor conclu-\nsively determined to be inadmissible by an immigration \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 52 of 92   Page ID\n #:9791\nCite as: 583 U.

See Brief for 46 Social Science Researchers \nand Professors as Amici Curiae 6, 8 (identifying, in 2015,\n7,500 asylum seekers and 12,220 noncitizens who have\nfinished  serving  sentences  of  criminal  confinement,  a\nportion of whom are class members detained for more than \nsix months). \nFourth, detention is often lengthy.  The classes before us \nconsist of people who were detained for at least six months\nand on average one year.  App. 92, 97.  The record shows \nthat the Government detained some asylum seekers for \n831 days (nearly 2½ years), 512 days, 456 days, 421 days,\n354 days, 319 days, 318 days, and 274 days—before they \nwon their cases and received asylum.  Id., at 97, 228–236. \nIt also shows that the Government detained one nonciti-\nzen for nearly four years after he had finished serving a\ncriminal  sentence,  and  the  Government  detained  other \nmembers of this class for 608 days, 561 days, 446 days,\n438 days, 387 days, and 305 days—all before they won\ntheir cases and received relief from removal.  Id., at 92, \n213–220. \nFifth,  many  of  those  whom  the  Government  detains \neventually obtain the relief they seek.  Two-thirds of the \nasylum  seekers  eventually  receive  asylum.

Moreover, those noncitizens would have no oppor-\ntunity to obtain bail while they pursue their claims, but if \nthey lose their claims, the Government must release them, \ntypically within six months, if the Government can find no\nother country willing to take them.  See Zadvydas, supra, \nat 701. \nEighth, all the respondents are held in detention within\nthe geographical boundaries of the United States, either in \nfacilities  controlled  by  United  States  Immigration  and\nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) or in state or local jails that \nhold them on ICE’s behalf.

The  Government  detains  them, \noften for many months while it determines the merits of,\nor contests, their claims.  To repeat the question before us:\nDoes the statute entitle an individual member of one of \nthese classes to obtain, say, after six months of detention, \na bail hearing to decide whether he or she poses a risk of \nflight or danger to the community and, if not, to receive\nbail? \nII \nThe Constitutional Question \nThe majority reads the relevant statute as prohibiting \nbail and hence prohibiting a bail hearing.  In my view, the \nrelevant constitutional language, purposes, history, tradi-\ntion, and case law all make clear that the majority’s inter-\npretation  at  the  very  least  would  raise  “grave  doubts” \nabout the statute’s constitutionality.  See Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 U. S., at 401. \nA \nConsider the relevant constitutional language and the\nvalues that language protects.  The Fifth Amendment says\nthat “[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or \nproperty without due process of law.”  An alien is a “per-\nson.”  See Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 237– \n238 (1896).  To hold him without bail is to deprive him of\nbodily “liberty.”  See United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. \n739, 748–751 (1987).  And, where there is no bail proceed-\ning, there has been no bail-related “process” at all.  The \nDue Process Clause—itself reflecting the language of the\nMagna  Carta—prevents  arbitrary  detention.    Indeed, \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 55 of 92   Page ID\n #:9794\n6  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \n“[f]reedom from bodily restraint has always been at the\ncore of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause\nfrom arbitrary governmental action.”  Foucha v. Louisi-\nana, 504 U. S. 71, 80 (1992); see also Demore v. Kim, 538 \nU. S.  510,  532  (2003)  (KENNEDY,  J.,  concurring); \nZadvydas, 533 U. S., at 718 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\nThe Due Process Clause foresees eligibility for bail as \npart of “due process.”  See Salerno, supra, at 748–751; \nSchilb v. Kuebel, 404 U. S. 357, 365 (1971); Stack v. Boyle, \n342 U. S. 1, 4 (1951).  Bail is “basic to our system of law.” \nSchilb, supra, at 365.  It not only “permits the unham-\npered preparation of a defense,” but also “prevent[s] the\ninfliction of punishment prior to conviction.”  Stack, supra, \nat 4.  It consequently limits the Government’s ability to \ndeprive a person of his physical liberty where doing so is\nnot needed to protect the public, see Salerno, supra, at \n750–751, or to assure his appearance at, say, a trial or the \nequivalent,  see  Stack,  supra,  at  4–5.  Why  would  this\nconstitutional language and its bail-related purposes not \napply to members of the classes of detained persons at \nissue here? \nThe  Eighth  Amendment  reinforces  the  view  that  the\nFifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause does apply.  The \nEighth Amendment forbids “[e]xcessive bail.”  It does so in \norder to prevent bail being set so high that the level itself\n(rather than the reasons that might properly forbid re-\nlease on bail) prevents provisional release.  See Carlson v. \nLandon, 342 U. S. 524, 545 (1952) (explaining that the\nEnglish clause from which the Eighth Amendment was\ncopied was understood “to provide that bail shall not be \nexcessive in those cases where it is proper to grant bail”). \nThat rationale applies a fortiori to a refusal to hold any \nbail hearing at all.  Thus, it is not surprising that this\nCourt  has  held  that  both  the  Fifth  Amendment’s  Due \nProcess  Clause  and  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  Excessive\nBail Clause apply in cases challenging bail procedures. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 56 of 92   Page ID\n #:9795\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  7 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nSee, e.g., Salerno, supra, at 746–755; Carlson, supra, at \n537–546. \nIt is clear that the Fifth Amendment’s protections ex-\ntend  to  “all  persons  within  the  territory  of  the  United \nStates.” Wong Wing, supra, at 238.  But the Government \nsuggests that those protections do not apply to asylum\nseekers or other arriving aliens because the law treats \narriving aliens as if they had never entered the United \nStates; hence they are not held within its territory.\nThis last-mentioned statement is, of course, false.  All of \nthese  noncitizens  are  held  within  the  territory  of  the\nUnited States at an immigration detention facility.  Those \nwho enter at JFK airport are held in immigration deten-\ntion facilities in, e.g., New York; those who arrive in El \nPaso are held in, e.g., Texas.  At most one might say that \nthey are “constructively” held outside the United States: \nthe  word  “constructive”  signaling  that  we  indulge  in  a\n“legal fiction,” shutting our eyes to the truth.  But once we \nadmit to uttering a legal fiction, we highlight, we do not\nanswer, the relevant question: Why should we engage in \nthis legal fiction here?\nThe legal answer to this question is clear.  We cannot \nhere engage in this legal fiction.  No one can claim, nor \nsince  the  time  of  slavery  has  anyone  to  my  knowledge \nsuccessfully claimed, that persons held within the United\nStates  are  totally  without  constitutional  protection.\nWhatever  the  fiction,  would  the  Constitution  leave  the \nGovernment free to starve, beat, or lash those held within \nour boundaries?  If not, then, whatever the fiction, how \ncan the Constitution authorize the Government to imprison\narbitrarily  those  who,  whatever  we  might  pretend,  are\nin reality right here in the United States?  The answer is \nthat the Constitution does not authorize arbitrary deten-\ntion.  And the reason that is so is simple: Freedom from \narbitrary detention is as ancient and important a right as \nany  found  within  the  Constitution’s  boundaries.    See \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 57 of 92   Page ID\n #:9796\n8  JENNINGS v.

Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Im-\nprovement Co., 18 How. 272, 277 (1856).  A brief look at \nBlackstone makes clear that at the time of the American \nRevolution the right to bail was “settled”—in both civil \nand criminal cases. \nBlackstone  tells  us  that  every  prisoner  (except  for  a \nconvict serving his sentence) was entitled to seek release \non bail.  4 Commentaries on the Laws of England 296–297 \n(1769).  This right applied in every criminal case.  Ibid.  A \nnoncapital defendant could seek bail from a local magis-\ntrate;  a  capital  defendant  could  seek  bail  at  a  hearing \nbefore the Court of King’s Bench.  See ibid.  Although a\ncapital defendant had no right to obtain bail, he could \nalways seek it, because “the court of king’s bench . . . may \nbail for any crime whatsoever, be it treason, murder, or \nany other offense, according to the circumstances of the \ncase.”  Id., at 296.  And although King Charles I initially \nclaimed the right to hold a prisoner without bail on secret\nnational security grounds, see Darnel’s Case, 3 How. St. \nTr. 1 (K. B. 1627), Parliament responded by extracting \nfrom the King (via the 1628 Petition of Right) a promise to \ncease such detention.  See 2 W. Hawkins, A Treatise of the \nPleas of the Crown 107–110 (4th ed. 1771).  From then on, \nbail was available even when a prisoner was held on the \npersonal command of the King.  Ibid.  That is why Black-\nstone says that the King’s Bench or its judges “may bail in \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 58 of 92   Page ID\n #:9797\nCite as: 583 U.

See  3  Blackstone,  Commentaries  290 \n(1768).  And bail was likewise an alternative to detention \nwhere a judgment debtor was unable to pay a civil judg-\nment  in  the  era  of  debtor’s  prison.    See,  e.g.,  Beers  v. \nHaughton, 9 Pet. 329, 356 (1835) (explaining that under \nOhio law, “if a defendant, upon a [writ of] capias, does not \ngive sufficient appearance bail, he shall be committed to\nprison”); Hamilton v. Dunklee, 1 N. H. 172 (1818). \nAmerican history makes clear that the settlers brought \nthis practice with them to America.  The Judiciary Act of \n1789  conferred  rights  to  bail  proceedings  in  all  federal \ncriminal cases.  §33, 1 Stat. 91.  It said that for a noncapi-\ntal defendant “bail shall be admitted” and for a capital \ndefendant  bail  may  be  admitted  in  the  discretion  of  a\ndistrict judge, a circuit judge, or a Justice of the Supreme\nCourt, taking account of “the offence, and of the evidence, \nand the usages of law.”  Ibid.  Congress enacted this law \nduring its debate over the Bill of Rights, which it subse-\nquently sent to the States for ratification.  See 1 Annals of \nCong.  90  (1789);  see  also  Martin  v.  Hunter’s  Lessee,  1 \nWheat. 304, 351 (1816) (Members of the First Congress\nwere “men of great learning and ability, . . . who had acted \na principal part in framing, supporting, or opposing” the\nConstitution itself).  Colonial law had been similarly, or in \nsome  instances  even  more,  protective.    See  Foote,  The \nComing Constitutional Crisis in Bail: I, 113 U. Pa. L. Rev. \n959, 974–977 (1965). \nSimilar  laws  have  consistently  remained  part  of  our \nlegal tradition.  In all federal criminal cases federal Acts \nhave provided for bail proceedings.  Bail Reform Act of \n1984, 18 U. S. C. §3141 et seq.; Bail Reform Act of 1966, 18 \nU. S. C. §3146 et seq. (1964 ed., Supp. II).  Every State has \nsimilar or more generous laws.  See Appendix B, infra. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 59 of 92   Page ID\n #:9798\n10  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nStandards  for  granting  bail  have  changed  somewhat \nover time.  Initially the sole factor determining the out-\ncome of a bail proceeding was risk of flight.  See Stack, 342 \nU. S., at 4–5 (interpreting the 1789 bail law, applied to a\nnoncapital defendant and in light of the Eighth Amend-\nment, to require bail no higher than required to provide \n“adequate assurance” that the defendant “will stand trial \nand  submit  to  sentence  if  found  guilty,”  “based  upon\nstandards relevant to the purpose of assuring the presence\nof that defendant”).\nCongress gradually added community safety as a bail\nfactor.  In 1966, Congress provided that for capital de-\nfendants and convicted defendants pursuing appeals, bail\nwould be granted unless the appeal was frivolous or a\ncourt had “reason to believe that no one or more conditions \nof release will reasonably assure that the person will not \nflee or pose a danger to any other person or to the commu-\nnity.”  Bail Reform Act of 1966 §3148.  In 1984, Congress\nmodified the bail standard for noncapital defendants by \nadding concern for community safety.  §3142(e)(1).  This \nCourt, applying the Due Process Clause and the Excessive \nBail  Clause  to  these changes,  found  that  the  1984  Act \npassed constitutional muster.  See Salerno, 481 U. S., at \n746–755.  Again, the States typically apply roughly simi-\nlar or more generous standards.  See Appendix B, infra. \nThe cases before us, however, are not criminal cases. \nDoes that fact make a difference?  The problem is that \nthere are not many instances of civil confinement (aside\nfrom  immigration  detention,  which  I  address  below).\nMental illness does sometimes provide an example.  Indi-\nviduals  dangerous  to  themselves  or  to  others  may  be \nconfined  involuntarily  to  a  mental  hospital.  See,  e.g., \nUnited States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. 126 (2010); Kansas v. \nHendricks, 521 U. S. 346 (1997).  Those persons normally\ndo not have what we would call “a right to a bail hearing.” \nBut they do possess equivalent rights: They have the right \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 60 of 92   Page ID\n #:9799\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  11 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nto a hearing prior to confinement and the right to review\nof  the  circumstances  at  least  annually.  See  Comstock, \nsupra, at 130–131 (initial hearing followed by review every \nsix  months);  Hendricks,  supra,  at  353  (initial  hearing\nfollowed by yearly review).  And the mentally ill persons \ndetained under these schemes are being detained because \nthey are dangerous.  That being so, there would be no\npoint in providing a bail hearing as well.  See Salerno, \nsupra, at 748–749 (analogizing denial of bail to dangerous \nindividuals to the civil commitment of the mentally ill).\nBut there is every reason for providing a bail proceeding to \nthe noncitizens at issue here, because they have received \nno individualized determination that they pose a risk of \nflight or present a danger to others, nor is there any evi-\ndence that most or all of them do. \nThis Court has also protected the right to a bail hearing \nduring  extradition  proceedings.  Wright  v.  Henkel,  190 \nU. S. 40 (1903), concerned the arrest and confinement of \nWhitaker Wright, an American citizen, pending extradi-\ntion for a crime that Wright was accused of having com-\nmitted in Great Britain.  Wright sought bail.  Id., at 43. \nSince the federal bail laws applied only to those charged \nwith committing crimes against the United States, they\ndid not cover Wright’s confinement.  Id., at 61–62.  The \nrelevant extradition statute said nothing about bail.  Id., \nat 62.  Its language (stronger than the language at issue \nhere)  said  that  the  individual  was  “to  remain”  in  “the \nproper  jail”  until  the  “surrender  shall  be  made”  to  the \nnation seeking extradition; and it added that he was “to\nremain” in custody “until delivered up”—though after two\nmonths he could seek release.  Rev. Stat. §§5270, 5273. \nIn an opinion by Chief Justice Fuller, this Court unani-\nmously wrote that, despite the lack of express statutory \nauthorization  and  the  risk  of  “embarrassment”  to  the \nUnited States if Wright fled, Wright could seek release on\nbail prior to the expiration of the 2-month period.  Wright, \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 61 of 92   Page ID\n #:9800\n12  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \n190 U. S., at 62–63.  Given the universal entitlement to \nbail under English law, the Court was “unwilling to hold \nthat . . . courts may not in any case, and whatever the\nspecial  circumstances,  extend  that  relief ”  to  prisoners\nawaiting extradition.  Id., at 63.  It consequently read a \nsilent statute as authorizing bail proceedings (though the \nCourt went on to hold that, under applicable standards,\nWright’s request for bail should be denied).  Ibid. \nThe strongest basis for reading the Constitution’s bail\nrequirements as extending to these civil, as well as crimi-\nnal, cases, however, lies in the simple fact that the law \ntreats like cases alike.  And reason tells us that the civil \nconfinement at issue here and the pretrial criminal con-\nfinement that calls for bail are in every relevant sense\nidentical.  There is no difference in respect to the fact of\nconfinement itself.  And I can find no relevant difference \nin respect to bail-related purposes.\nWhich class of persons—criminal defendants or asylum\nseekers—seems  more likely  to  have  acted  in  a  manner \nthat typically warrants confinement?  A person charged\nwith a crime cannot be confined at all without a finding of \nprobable cause that he or she committed the crime.  And \nthe majority of criminal defendants lose their cases.  See \nDept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, B. Reaves,\nFelony  Defendants  in  Large  Urban  Counties,  2009–\nStatistical Tables, p. 24 (Dec. 2013) (reporting that 66% of \nfelony defendants were convicted).  A high percentage of\nthe  noncitizens  before  us,  however,  ultimately  win  the\nright they seek, the right to be in the United States. \nNor  am  I  aware  of  any  evidence  indicating  that  the\nnoncitizens  seeking  to  enter,  or  to  remain  within,  the \nUnited States are more likely than criminal defendants to \nthreaten the safety of the community if released.  In any\nevent, this is a matter to be determined, case by case, at\nbail hearings. \nWhich group is more likely to present a risk of flight? \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 62 of 92   Page ID\n #:9801\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  13 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nAgain,  I  can  find  no  evidence  suggesting  that  asylum\nseekers or other noncitizens generally present a greater \nrisk of flight than persons imprisoned for trial where there \nis probable cause to believe that the confined person has \ncommitted a crime.  In any event, this matter too is to be\ndetermined, case by case, at bail hearings.\nIf there is no reasonable basis for treating these con-\nfined noncitizens worse than ordinary defendants charged\nwith crimes, 18 U. S. C. §3142; worse than convicted crim-\ninals  appealing  their  convictions,  §3143(b);  worse  than \ncivilly  committed  citizens,  supra,  at  10–11;  worse  than \nidentical noncitizens found elsewhere within the United \nStates, supra, at 4; and worse than noncitizens who have \ncommitted crimes, served their sentences, and been defini-\ntively ordered removed (but lack a country willing to take \nthem), supra, at 4, their detention without bail is arbi-\ntrary.  Thus, the constitutional language, purposes, and \ntradition that require bail in instances of criminal con-\nfinement also very likely require bail in these instances of \ncivil confinement.  That perhaps is why Blackstone wrote \nthat the law provides for the possibility of “bail in any case \nwhatsoever.”  4 Analysis of the Laws of England, at 148. \nC \nMy examination of the cases from this Court that con-\nsidered detention of noncitizens and bail suggests that this\nCourt, while sometimes denying bail to individuals, gen-\nerally has not held that bail proceedings are unnecessary.\nIndeed, it almost always has suggested the contrary.\n1. In 1882 Congress enacted two laws that restricted\nimmigration: The first prohibited the entry of “Chinese\nlaborers.”  The Chinese Exclusion Act, ch. 126, 22 Stat. 58. \nThe second prohibited the entry of “any convict, lunatic,\nidiot, or any person unable to take care of himself or her-\nself without becoming a public charge.”  Act of Aug. 3,\n1882, 22 Stat. 214.  Neither said a word about bail.  But in \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 63 of 92   Page ID\n #:9802\n14  JENNINGS v.

In re Ah Moy, 21 F. 808 (CC Cal. 1884). \nJustice Field, sitting as a Circuit Judge, wrote that the\ncourt lacked the authority to order bail because doing so \nwould allow her to enter the United States—just what the\nstatute forbade.  Id., at 809.  The other sitting Circuit\nJudge (Judge Sawyer) disagreed.  Id., at 810 (dissenting \nopinion).  He pointed out that the alien would remain “in\nthe custody and control of the law while lawfully on bail.” \nIbid.  He added that it “would be a great hardship, not to\nsay a gross violation of her personal rights,” to refuse bail \nfor 15 days before her ship arrived as long as she could \nprovide “security satisfactory to the court” that she would\nindeed depart when it did.  Id., at 809–810.  Two other \nCircuit Judges noted their agreement with Judge Sawyer. \nId., at 809, n. 1.  But they did not participate in the case, \nibid., the two participating judges split 1 to 1, and so the \nviews  of  presiding  Justice  Field  prevailed.  The  alien \nappealed to this Court, Cheong Ah Moy v. United States, \n113 U. S. 216 (1885), but before this Court could decide, \nthe ship departed with Cheong Ah Moy aboard. \n2. In Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228 (1896), \nthe Court struck down as unconstitutional a statute that \nsaid alien Chinese laborers should be “imprisoned at hard \nlabor” for up to a year before being deported.  Id., at 235. \nIn doing so, the Court wrote that although a sentence to \nhard labor was unlawful, “detention, or temporary con-\nfinement,”  was  constitutional,  because  “[d]etention  is  a \nusual feature of every case of arrest on a criminal charge,\neven  when  an  innocent  person  is  wrongfully  accused.” \nIbid.

She then petitioned for a writ\nof habeas corpus on the grounds that (1) as a religious\nrefugee she was exempt from the literacy requirement; (2) \nin any event, she need read only one language, not two; (3)\nher daughter was not disabled; and (4) the Department of \nLabor should have allowed her to appeal administratively. \nId., at 114–115. \nThe relevant statutory provisions, just like the present \nstatute, see infra, at 20, 29, said that an arriving person,\nunless “clearly and beyond a doubt entitled” to land, “shall \nbe detained for examination . . . by a board of special in-\nquiry.”  Act of Feb. 5, 1917, §16, 39 Stat. 886 (emphasis \nadded).  By the time the case reached this Court, however, \nthe  family  had  been  allowed  bail.  See  Waldman,  266 \nU. S., at 117.  This Court ordered the Department of Labor \nto  provide  the  family  with  an  administrative  appeal. \nThen, after initially “remand[ing] the petitioners to the \ncustody of immigration authorities” pending the outcome \nof the appeal, id., at 120, the Court clarified in a rehearing\norder that “[n]othing in the order of this Court shall prej-\nudice an application for release on bail of the respondents\npending compliance with the mandate of this Court.”  Tod \nv. Waldman, 266 U. S. 547, 548 (1925).  This statement is \ninconsistent  with  the  earlier  opinion  of  Justice  Field, \nsitting as a Circuit Judge, because it shows that even an\nalien challenging her exclusion could be released on bail. \nSupra, at 14. \n4. In Carlson v. Landon, 342 U. S. 524 (1952), this Court \nupheld the denial of bail to noncitizen Communists being \nheld pending deportation, despite a statute that permitted \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 65 of 92   Page ID\n #:9804\n16  JENNINGS v.

It \nsaid  nothing  to  suggest  that  bail  proceedings  were \nunnecessary.\n5. In Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 \nU. S.  206  (1953),  the  Attorney  General  had  ordered  a\nnoncitizen permanently excluded from the United States \non the ground that his “entry would be prejudicial to the \npublic interest for security reasons.”  Id., at 208; see Sub-\nversive Activities Control Act of 1950, §§22–23, 64 Stat.\n1006–1012.  He “sat on Ellis Island because this country\nshut him out and others were unwilling to take him in.” \n345 U. S., at 209.  After 21 months in confinement he filed \na  petition  for  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  seeking  judicial \nreview of the exclusion decision or release on bail until he \ncould be removed to another country.  Id., at 207, 209. \nThis Court refused to review the exclusion decision on the \nground  that  the  security  matter  fell  totally  within  the \nPresident’s authority, pursuant to an express congressional\ndelegation of power.  Id., at 210.  The Court also denied \nMezei a bail proceeding because in an “exclusion proceed-\ning grounded on danger to the national security . . . nei-\nther the rationale nor the statutory authority for” release \non bail exists.  Id., at 216.  It denied bail, however, after \nthe Attorney General had already found, on an individual-\nized basis, not only that Mezei was a security risk and\nconsequently not entitled to either admission or bail, but \nalso that he could be denied a hearing on the matter be-\ncause the basis for that decision could not be disclosed \nwithout harm to national security.  Id., at 208–209.  The \nrespondents in this case have been the subject of no such\nindividualized findings.  And unlike Mezei, who was re-\nquesting bail after his exclusion proceedings had ended\n(while the Attorney General searched for a country that\nwould take him—a matter that we again confronted in \nZadvydas), the respondents here continue to litigate the \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 66 of 92   Page ID\n #:9805\nCite as: 583 U.

Thus, Mezei, but not \nthe respondents here, was in a sense in the position of a \nconvicted criminal who had lost his appeal, not a criminal \nawaiting trial (or the results of an appeal). \n6. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678 (2001), concerned a\nnoncitizen who had lawfully resided in this country, com-\nmitted a serious crime, completed his prison sentence, and \nwas then ordered deported.  Id., at 684.  Zadvydas sought\nrelease on bail during the time the Government searched\nfor a country that would take him.  Id., at 684–685.  The \ngoverning statute said an alien such as Zadvydas “may be\ndetained”  pending  his  removal  to  another  country.  8 \nU. S. C. §1231(a)(6).  We interpreted those words as re-\nquiring release from detention once it became clear that\nthere  was  “no  significant  likelihood  of  removal  in  the \nreasonably  foreseeable  future”—presumptively  after  a\nperiod of confinement of six months.  533 U. S., at 701. \nWe read the statute as requiring this release because a\n“statute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would \nraise a serious constitutional problem.”  Id., at 690. \nFrom a constitutional perspective, this case follows a \nfortiori from Zadvydas.  Here only a bail hearing is at \nissue, not release on bail, much less permanent release.\nAnd here there has been no final determination that any\nof the respondents lacks a legal right to stay in the United\nStates—the  bail  hearing  at  issue  concerns  conditional\nrelease pending that final determination.  It is immaterial \nthat  detention  here  is  not  literally  indefinite,  because \nwhile  the  respondents’  removal  proceedings  must  end \neventually, they last an indeterminate period of at least \nsix months and a year on average, thereby implicating the \nsame  constitutional  right  against  prolonged  arbitrary \ndetention that we recognized in Zadvydas. \n7. In Demore v. Kim, 538 U. S. 510 (2003), we held that \nthe Government could constitutionally hold without bail \nnoncitizens who had committed certain crimes, had com-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 67 of 92   Page ID\n #:9806\n18  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \npleted their sentences, and were in removal proceedings.\nSee §1226(c).  But we based our holding on the short-term\nnature of the confinement necessary to complete proceed-\nings.  See id., at 529–530.  The Court wrote that the “de-\ntention at stake . . . lasts roughly a month and a half in\nthe vast majority of cases in which it is invoked, and about \nfive months in the minority of cases in which the alien\nchooses to appeal.”  Id., at 530.  We added: \n“[I]n 85% of the cases in which aliens are detained\n[pursuant to the relevant statute], removal proceed-\nings are completed in an average time of 47 days and \na median of 30 days.  In the remaining 15% of cases, \nin which the alien appeals the decision of the immi-\ngration judge to the Board of Immigration Appeals, \nappeal takes an average of four months, with a median\ntime that is slightly shorter.”  Id., at 529 (citation \nomitted). \nDemore himself, an outlier, was detained for six months. \nId., at 530–531. \nThe Court then found detention constitutional “during\nthe limited period” necessary to arrange for removal, and \nwe contrasted that period of detention with the detention\nat issue in Zadvydas, referring to the detention in Demore \nas being “of a much shorter duration.”  538 U. S., at 526, \n528.  JUSTICE KENNEDY stated in a concurrence that the \nDue Process Clause might require bail hearings “if the\ncontinued detention became unreasonable or unjustified.” \nId., at 532.  Dissenting, I wrote that, had I believed that \nDemore  “had  conceded  that  he  [was]  deportable,”  then,\ndespite Zadvydas, “I would conclude that the Government \ncould detain him without bail for the few weeks ordinarily \nnecessary for formal entry of a removal order.”  538 U. S., \nat 576 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nThe Government now tells us that the statistics it gave\nto the Court in Demore were wrong.  Detention normally \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 68 of 92   Page ID\n #:9807\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  19 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nlasts twice as long as the Government then said it did. \nAnd, as I have pointed out, thousands of people here are\nheld for considerably longer than six months without an\nopportunity to seek bail.  See supra, at 3.  We deal here \nwith prolonged detention, not the short-term detention at\nissue in Demore.  Hence Demore, itself a deviation from \nthe history and tradition of bail and alien detention, can-\nnot help the Government.\nThe  upshot  is  the  following:  The  Constitution’s  lan-\nguage, its basic purposes, the relevant history, our tradi-\ntion, and many of the relevant cases point in the same \ninterpretive direction.  They tell us that an interpretation\nof the statute before us that would deny bail proceedings\nwhere detention is prolonged would likely mean that the \nstatute violates the Constitution.  The interpretive princi-\nple that flows from this conclusion is clear and longstand-\ning: “‘[A]s between two possible interpretations of a stat-\nute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by\nthe other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which will \nsave the Act.’”  Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 190 (1991) \n(quoting  Blodgett  v.  Holden,  275  U. S.  142,  148  (1927) \n(opinion of Holmes, J.)).  Moreover, a “statute must be \nconstrued, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the \nconclusion  that  it  is  unconstitutional,  but  also  grave\ndoubts upon that score.”  Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S., at 401. \nThese  legal  principles  reflect  a  realistic  assumption, \nnamely, that Congress—particularly a Congress that did not\nconsider  a  constitutional  matter—would  normally  have \npreferred a constitutional interpretation to an interpreta-\ntion that may render a statute an unconstitutional nullity.\nAnd that is so even where the constitutional interpreta-\ntion departs from the most natural reading of the statute’s\nlanguage.  See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf \nCoast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, \n575 (1988); see also National Federation of Independent \nBusiness v. Sebelius, 567 U. S. 519, 563, 574–576 (2012) \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 69 of 92   Page ID\n #:9808\n20  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \n(majority opinion and opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). \nIII \nThe Statutory Provisions \nThe question remains whether it is possible to read the\nstatute as authorizing bail.  As desirable as a constitu-\ntional interpretation of a statute may be, we cannot read it \nto say the opposite of what its language states.  The word \n“animal” does not include minerals, no matter how strongly\none  might  wish  that  it  did.    Indeed,  where  “‘Congress\nhas made its intent in the statute clear, we must give\neffect to that intent,’” even if doing so requires us to con-\nsider  the  constitutional  question,  and  even  if  doing  so \nmeans  that  we  hold  the  statute  unconstitutional. \nZadvydas, 533 U. S., at 696 (quoting Miller v. French, 530 \nU. S. 327, 336 (2000)).  In my view, however, we can, and \nshould, read the relevant statutory provisions to require\nbail proceedings in instances of prolonged detention with-\nout  doing  violence  to  the  statutory  language  or  to  the\nprovisions’ basic purposes. \nA \nAsylum Seekers \nThe  relevant  provision  governing  the  first  class  of \nnoncitizens, the asylum seekers, is §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  It \nsays  that,  if  an  immigration  “officer  determines  at  the\ntime” of an initial interview with an alien seeking to enter \nthe United States “that [the] alien has a credible fear of \npersecution . . . , the alien shall be detained for further \nconsideration of the application for asylum.”  See Appen-\ndix A–1, infra.  I have emphasized the three key words,\nnamely, “shall be detained.”  Do those words mean that \nthe asylum seeker must be detained without bail? \nThey do not.  First, in ordinary English and in light of\nthe  history  of  bail,  the  word  “detain”  is  ambiguous  in\nrespect to the relevant point.  The Oxford English Diction-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 70 of 92   Page ID\n #:9809\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  21 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nary (OED), surveying the history of the word, notes that \nEdward  Hall,  a  famous  16th-century  legal  scholar  and \nauthor of Hall’s Chronicle, wrote: “A traytor . . . is appre-\nhended and deteigned in prisone for his offence,” a use of \nthe word, as we know from Blackstone, that is consistent \nwith bail.  See supra, at 8–9; OED (3d ed., Dec. 2012),\nhttp://www.oed.com/view/Entry/51176  (annot.  to  def.  1).\nDavid  Hume,  the  famous  18th-century  historian  and \nphilosopher,  writes  of  being  “detained  in  strict  confine-\nment,” thereby implying the existence of detention without \nstrict confinement.  Ibid.  A 19th-century novelist writes,\n“‘Beg your pardon, sir,’ said the constable, . . . ‘I shall be \nobliged to detain you till this business is settled’”—again a\nuse of “detain” that we know (from Blackstone) is con-\nsistent with bail.  Ibid.  And the OED concludes that the \nprimary meaning of “detain” is “[t]o keep in confinement \nor  under  restraint;  to  keep  prisoner.”    Ibid.  (emphasis \nadded).  To  grant  bail,  we  know,  is  not  to  grant  unre-\nstrained freedom.  Rather, where the Act elsewhere ex-\npressly permits bail, it requires “bond of at least $1,500\nwith  security  approved  by,  and  containing  conditions\nprescribed  by,  the  Attorney  General.”   8  U. S. C. \n§1226(a)(2)(A).  Similarly  in  the  criminal  context,  bail\nimposes numerous restraints, ranging from the provision \nof a bond, to restrictions on residences and travel, to the \nimposition of a curfew, to a requirement to obtain medical\ntreatment, to report at regular intervals, or even to return \nto  custody  at  specified  hours.  See  18  U. S. C. \n§3142(c)(1)(B) (listing possible conditions for the pretrial \nrelease of federal criminal defendants).\nAt  the  very  least,  because  the  word  “detain”  in  this\ncontext refers to a comparatively long period of time, it can \nreadily coexist with a word such as “bail” that refers to a \nshorter period of conditional release.  For instance, there \nis nothing inconsistent in saying: During his exile, he was \npermitted to pay short visits to his home country; during \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 71 of 92   Page ID\n #:9810\n22  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nthe period of active hostilities, the soldiers would lay down \ntheir arms and fraternize on Christmas Day; during his\noverseas detention, he was allowed home to see his sick \nmother; or during his detention pending proceedings, he \nwas permitted bail. \nSecond, our precedent treats the statutory word “detain” \nas consistent with bail.  In Waldman, 266 U. S. 547, we \nconsidered an immigration statute that stated (in respect \nto arriving aliens) that “[e]very alien who may not appear\nto the examining inspector at the port of arrival to be \nclearly and beyond a doubt entitled to land shall be de-\ntained for examination in relation thereto by a board of \nspecial inquiry.”  Act of Feb. 5, 1917, §16, 39 Stat. 886 \n(emphasis  added).    The  Court  indicated  that  bail  was \navailable, stating that “[n]othing in the order of this court \nshall prejudice an application for release on bail.”  266 \nU. S., at 548.  In so stating, the Court was simply follow-\ning precedent, such as Wright v. Henkel, where the Court \nwrote that bail is available even where not “specifically \nvested by statute.”  190 U. S., at 63; see supra, at 11–12. \nWhen Congress passed the relevant provisions of the Act\nin 1996, it legislated against this historical backdrop, at a\ntime when the precise language that it adopted had been\ninterpreted by this Court to permit bail.  See Monessen \nSouthwestern R. Co. v. Morgan, 486 U. S. 330, 338 (1988) \n(“Congress’ failure to disturb a consistent judicial inter-\npretation of a statute may provide some indication that \n‘Congress at least acquiesces in, and apparently affirms,\nthat  [interpretation]’”  (quoting  Cannon  v.  University  of \nChicago, 441 U. S. 677, 703 (1979))). \nThird, the Board of Immigration Appeals reads the word\n“detain” as consistent with bail, for it has held that its \nregulations, implementing the same statutory provision as \nis before us, allow bail for asylum seekers who are appre-\nhended inside the United States within 100 miles of the \nborder, rather than at a border crossing.  See In re X-K-, \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 72 of 92   Page ID\n #:9811\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  23 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \n23  I. & N.  Dec.,  at  732,  734–735  (discussing  8  CFR \n§1003.19(h)(2)(i)  (2004)).    The  same  statute,  same  lan-\nguage applies to the detention of those asylum seekers and \nthe ones before us, so the statute must be consistent with \nbail in the Board of Immigration Appeals’ view. \nFourth, in Zadvydas we found (to avoid similar constitu-\ntional questions) that the words “‘may be detained’” were\nconsistent with requiring release from long-term deten-\ntion.  533 U. S., at 682 (quoting 8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(6)).\nThe majority correctly notes that here the language sub-\nstitutes the word “shall” for the word “may.”  Ante, at 14– \n16.  But the majority is wrong to distinguish Zadvydas on \nthis basis.  There the Court did not emphasize the word\n“detain,” for the question at issue was release from deten-\ntion.  And the key word was consequently “may,” suggest-\ning discretion.  Here the question concerns the right to a \nbail  hearing  during  detention.    And  the  key  linguistic\nambiguity concerns the word “detention.”  Is that word \nconsistent  with  bail  proceedings?  The  answer,  for  the \nreasons I have stated, is “yes.” \nFifth,  the  statute  does  not  even  mention  long-term\ndetention without bail.  Whether the statute speaks in \nterms of discretion (“may,” as in Zadvydas) or mandatory\naction (“shall,” as in this case), the Government’s argu-\nment is wrong for the same reason: Congress does not\nunambiguously authorize long-term detention without bail \nby failing to say when detention must end.  As we recog-\nnized in Zadvydas, Congress anticipated long-term deten-\ntion elsewhere in the Act, providing for review every six \nmonths  of  terrorist  aliens  detained  under  8  U. S. C. \n§1537(b)(2)(C), but it did not do so here.  See 533 U. S., at \n697. \nSixth, the Act provides that an asylum applicant whose\nproceedings  last  longer  than  six  months  may  be  given \nwork  authorization.    §1158(d)(2).    The  majority  would \napply this provision to some asylum applicants but not the \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 73 of 92   Page ID\n #:9812\n24  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nones before us.  Ante, at 26, n. 6.  Of course, the statute \ndoes not contain that limitation.  Read most naturally, the\nprovision  offers  some  indication  that  Congress,  in  the \nsame statute, did not require asylum seekers to remain\nconfined without bail at the 6-month mark. \nSeventh,  there  is  a  separate  statutory  provision  that \npurports to do precisely what the majority says this one \ndoes, providing that certain aliens “shall be detained . . . \nuntil removed.”  §1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV) (emphasis added); \nante,  at  16  (detention  must  continue  until  proceedings\n“have finished”).  The problem for the majority is that this \nother provision applies only to those who, unlike the re-\nspondents, have no credible fear of persecution.  The pro-\nvision that applies here lacks similar language. \nLinguistic ambiguity, while necessary, is not sufficient.\nI would also ask whether the statute’s purposes suggest a\ncongressional refusal to permit bail where confinement is \nprolonged.  The answer is “no.”  There is nothing in the\nstatute or in the legislative history that reveals any such\ncongressional intent.  The most likely reason for its ab-\nsence is that Congress, like the Government when it ap-\npeared before us in Demore, believed there were no such \ninstances, or at least that there were very few.  Indeed, \nthe Act suggests that asylum proceedings ordinarily finish\nquickly.  See §1158(d)(5)(A) (providing that absent “excep-\ntional  circumstances,”  final  administrative  adjudication\n(not  including  appeal)  must  be  completed  “within  180\ndays,” and any appeal must be filed “within 30 days” of the\ndecision).  And for those proceedings that last longer than \nsix months, we know that two-thirds of asylum seekers \nwin  their  cases.  Thus,  legislative  silence  suggests  not\ndisapproval of bail, but a lack of consideration of the mat-\nter.  For present purposes that is sufficient.  It means that \nCongress did not intend to forbid bail.  An interpretation\nthat permits bail—based upon history, tradition, statutory \ncontext,  and  precedent—is  consistent,  not  inconsistent, \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 74 of 92   Page ID\n #:9813\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  25 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nwith what Congress intended the statutory provision to\ndo. \nThe majority apparently finds a contrary purpose in the \nfact that other provisions of the statute permit the Attor-\nney  General  to  release  an  alien  on  parole  “‘for  urgent \nhumanitarian reasons or significant public benefit’” and\nimpose bail-like conditions.  Ante, at 16–17 (discussing 8 \nU. S. C. §1182(d)(5)(A)).  Yet under the majority’s inter-\npretation of “detain,” the same argument could have been\nmade in Zadvydas.  We held that noncitizens presump-\ntively are entitled to release after six months of detention,\nnotwithstanding an available alternative avenue for relief, \nnamely, bail.  533 U. S., at 683.  There is no reason to \nreach  a  different  result  here.    While  the  Government \nhistorically used this provision to take account of tradi-\ntional bail factors (flight risk, safety risk), the President\nsince  issued  an  Executive  Order  directing  parole  to  be\ngranted  “in  all  circumstances  only  when  an  individual \ndemonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a signifi-\ncant public benefit.”  Exec. Order. No. 13767, 82 Fed. Reg. \n8793 (2017).  And besides, Congress’ provision of parole to\npermit, for example, release for the purpose of medical \ncare or to testify in a court proceeding—which adds to the \ncircumstances under which a noncitizen can be released \nfrom confinement—says nothing about whether Congress\nintended to cut back on those circumstances in respect to\nthe meaning of “detain” and the historical understanding \nthat detention permits bail. \nB \nCriminals Who Have Served Their Sentences \nThe relevant statutory provision, §1226(c), says in para-\ngraph (1) that the “Attorney General shall take into cus- \ntody any alien who . . . is deportable [or inadmissible] by\nreason  of  having  committed  [certain  crimes]  when  the \nalien is released,” presumably (or ordinarily) after having \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 75 of 92   Page ID\n #:9814\n26  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nserved his sentence.  It then goes on to say, in paragraph \n(2), that the “Attorney General may release [that] alien . . . \nonly if the Attorney General decides pursuant to section\n3521 of title 18 that release of the alien from custody is \nnecessary to provide protection to a witness [or to certain \nrelated others].”  See Appendix A–2, infra. \nI  have  emphasized  the  relevant  phrases:  “take  into \ncustody” in the first paragraph, and “may release [that] \nalien . . . only if ” in the second paragraph.  We have long\ninterpreted “in custody” as “not requir[ing] that a prisoner\nbe physically confined.”  Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488, \n491 (1989) (per curiam).  In the habeas context, we have \nheld that “a person released on bail or on his own recogni-\nzance” is “‘in custody’ within the meaning of the statute.” \nHensley v. Municipal Court, San Jose-Milpitas Judicial \nDist., Santa Clara Cty., 411 U. S. 345, 349 (1973); Justices \nof Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, 466 U. S. 294, 300– \n301 (1984) (same).  The reason is simple, as I already have \nexplained, supra, at 21: A person who is released on bail \n“is subject to restraints ‘not shared by the public gener-\nally.’”  Hensley, supra, at 351 (quoting Jones v. Cunning-\nham, 371 U. S. 236, 240 (1963)); see also Maleng, supra, at \n491 (“[A] prisoner who had been placed on parole was still\n‘in custody’” because his “release from physical confine-\nment . . . was not unconditional; instead, it was explicitly \nconditioned on his reporting regularly to his parole officer, \nremaining in a particular community, residence, and job, \nand refraining from certain activities” (citing Jones, supra, \nat 242)).\nMoreover,  there  is  no  reason  to  interpret  “custody”\ndifferently than “detain.”  The OED defines “custody” as\n“[t]he state of being detained,” http://www.oed.com/view/\nEntry/46305  (def.  5).  “Detained,”  as  I  have  previously\npointed out, can be read consistently with bail.  See supra,\nat 20–23.  The OED also defines the statutory phrase, \n“take (a person) into custody,” as “to arrest and imprison \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 76 of 92   Page ID\n #:9815\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  27 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \n(a person),” http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/46305 (def. 5). \nAnd we know from the history, tradition, case law, and \nother sources earlier discussed, including Blackstone, that \narresting and imprisoning a person is consistent with a \nbail hearing and a subsequent grant of bail, even where a \nstatute contains words such as “commitment” or “detain.” \nSee supra, at 5–19 (citing, e.g., Wright, 190 U. S., at 62 \n(reading as consistent with a bail proceeding the statutory\nlanguage “‘shall issue [a] warrant for the commitment . . . \nto the proper jail, there to remain’” until “‘surrender’” for \nextradition)). \nBut  what  about  the  second  phrase,  stating  that  the\nAttorney General “may release [that] alien . . . only if the \nAttorney General decides pursuant to section 3521 of title \n18 that release of the alien from custody is necessary to\nprovide protection to a witness”?  Does the presence of the \nwords “only if ” show that the statute automatically denies\nbail for any other reason?\nIt does not.  That is because the phrase has nothing to \ndo with bail.  It has to do with a special program, the\nWitness  Protection  Program,  set  forth  in  18  U. S. C. \n§3521.  That  program  allows  the  Attorney  General  to \nrelocate the witness, to give him an entirely new identity,\nto help his family similarly, and to pay him a stipend,\namong other things.  §§3521(a)(1), (b)(1).  The Attorney \nGeneral may “take such action as [he] determines to be\nnecessary to protect the person,” presumably even free the\nwitness from whatever obligations might require him to \nreport  to  an  immigration  or  judicial  authority.\n§3521(b)(1).  Accordingly,  when  the  Attorney  General \n“release[s]” an alien under 8 U. S. C. §1226(c)(2), he does \nnot grant bail; he may well do far more, freeing the wit-\nness from a host of obligations and restraints, including \nthose  many  obligations  and  restraints  that  accompany\nbail.  See supra, at 21. \nThis understanding of “release” in §1226(c) is consistent \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 77 of 92   Page ID\n #:9816\n28  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nwith  the  OED’s  definition  of  “release”  as  “to  free  from \nrestraint” or even “to liberate from . . . an obligation” (not \nsimply “to free from . . . captivity”), http://www.oed.com/ \nview/Entry/161859 (def. 6(a)).  And it is consistent with \nour earlier reading of the word “detain.”  Supra, at 20–24. \nFollowing the OED’s definition of “detain” as “under re-\nstraint,” we have understood the word “detention” to in-\nclude the state of being “under” those “restraints” that\ntypically accompany bail.  Supra, at 20–24.  That is to say,\nboth the individual on bail and the individual not on bail \nare  “detained”;  and  the  Attorney  General,  through  his \nWitness Protection Program powers can free the individual\nfrom both.  To repeat: The provision at issue means that\nthe Attorney General “may release” the detained person \nfrom the restraints that accompany detainment—whether\nthat individual has been detained with, or without, bail. \nSo understood the phrase has nothing to do with the\nissue before us: whether a confined individual is, or is not, \nentitled to bail or a bail hearing.  It simply means that the\nAttorney  General  cannot  free  that  person  from  all,  or \nmost, restraining conditions (including those that accom-\npany bail) unless the alien is placed in the Witness Protec-\ntion Program.  So read, the words “only if ” neither favor\nnor disfavor a reading of the statute consistent with the \nright to a bail proceeding. \nThe  purpose-related  reasons  that  argue  for  a  bail-\nfavorable reading are also applicable here.  Congress did\nnot consider the problem of long-term detention.  It wrote \nthe statute with brief detention in mind.  See H. R. Rep. \nNo. 104–469, pt. 1, p. 123, and n. 25 (1996) (stating that\nthe “average stay [was] 28 days”).  Congress did not know\n(for apparently the Government did not know in Demore)\nthat the average length of detention for this class would \nturn out to be about a year.  Nor did Congress necessarily\nknow that about 40% of class members eventually obtain \nthe right to remain in the United States. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 78 of 92   Page ID\n #:9817\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  29 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nI should add that reading the statute as denying bail to \nthose whose detention is prolonged is anomalous.  Those \nwhose removal is legally or factually questionable could be\nimprisoned indefinitely while the matter is being decided.\nThose  whose  removal  is  not  questionable  (for  they  are \nunder a final removal order) could be further imprisoned \nfor no more than six months.  See supra, at 4, 17.  In fact, \neven  before  our  decision  in  Zadvydas,  the  Government \ngave bail hearings to noncitizens under a final order of \nremoval after six months of detention.  See 533 U. S., at \n683. \nC \nOther Applicants for Admission \nThe statutory provision that governs the third category \nof  noncitizens  seeking  admission  at  the  border  is \n§1225(b)(2)(A).  It says that “if the examining immigration\nofficer determines that an alien seeking admission is not \nclearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the \nalien  shall  be  detained  for  a  proceeding  under  section\n1229a of this title.”  See Appendix A–3, infra. \nThe Government tells us that this miscellaneous cate- \ngory consists of persons who are neither (1) clearly eligible \nfor admission, nor (2) clearly ineligible.  Pet. for Cert. 3–4. \nA clearly eligible person is, of course, immediately admit-\nted.  A clearly ineligible person—someone who lacks the\nrequired  documents,  or  provides  fraudulent  ones—is \n“removed  . . .  without  further  hearing  or  review.” \n§1225(b)(1)(A)(i);  see  §§1182(a)(6)(C),  (a)(7).  But  where \nthe matter is not clear, i.e., where the immigration officer \ndetermines  that  an  alien  “is  not  clearly  and  beyond  a \ndoubt entitled to be admitted,” he is detained for a re-\nmoval proceeding.  §1225(b)(2)(A).  Like all respondents, this\nclass has been detained for at least six months.  It may \ninclude persons returning to the United States who have\nwork  permits  or  other  documents  seemingly  entitling \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 79 of 92   Page ID\n #:9818\n30  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nthem to entry, but whom an immigration officer suspects \nare inadmissible for some other reason, such as because \nthey may have incomplete vaccinations or have committed\nstudent visa abuse or a crime of “moral turpitude.”  See \n§1182(a) (delineating classes of aliens ineligible for admis-\nsion).  For instance, the Federal Register is replete with\nexamples  of  offenses  that  immigration  authorities  have\nthought are crimes of moral turpitude but that the courts\nof appeals later determine are not.  See, e.g., Goldeshtein \nv. INS, 8 F. 3d 645, 648 (CA9 1993) (structuring financial \ntransactions to avoid currency reports); Nunez v. Holder, \n594 F. 3d 1124, 1138 (CA9 2010) (indecent exposure).  It \nalso  may  include  individuals  who  claim  citizenship  by \nvirtue  of  birth  or  parentage  but  who  lack  documents \nclearly proving their claim. \nThe critical statutory  words are the same as those I \nhave just discussed in the context of the asylum seekers—\n“shall be detained.”  There is no more plausible reason \nhere than there was there to believe those words foreclose \nbail.  See supra, at 20–24.  The constitutional considera-\ntions, the statutory language, and the purposes underlying \nthe statute are virtually the same.  Thus, the result should \nbe the same: Given the constitutional considerations, we \nshould interpret the statute as permitting bail. \nIV \nThe majority concludes in Part V, ante, at 29–31, by\nsaying that, before considering bail-related constitutional \narguments, the lower courts “should reexamine whether \nrespondents  can  continue  litigating  their  claims  as  a \nclass.”  Ante, at 29.  Relying on dicta in Reno v. American-\nArab  Anti-Discrimination  Comm.,  525  U. S.  471  (1999) \n(AADC), it then suggests that the respondents may not be \nable to continue litigating because the Act says that \n“no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have \njurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the oper-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 80 of 92   Page ID\n #:9819\nCite as: 583 U.

S. C. \n§1252(f)(1). \nWere the majority’s suggestion correct as to this juris-\ndictional question, it would have shown, at most, that we\nshould decide the constitutional question here and now. \nWe have already asked for and  received briefs on that\nquestion.  But I do not believe the majority is correct.\nEvery member of the classes before us falls within the\nprovision’s exception.  Every one of them is an “individual\nalien  against  whom  proceedings  under  such  part  have\nbeen initiated.”  Ibid.  The Court in AADC did not con-\nsider, and had no reason to consider, the application of \n§1252(f)(1) to such a class.  Regardless, a court could order \ndeclaratory relief.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) \npermits  a  class  action  where  “final  injunctive  relief  or \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting\nthe class as a whole.”  (Emphasis added.)  And the Advisory \nCommittee  says  that  declaratory  relief  can  fall  within\nthe Rule’s term “corresponding” if it “serves as a basis for\nlater  injunctive  relief.”  Notes  on  Rule  23(b)(2)–1966\nAmendment, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 812. \nJurisdiction also is unaffected by 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9),\nwhich by its terms applies only “[w]ith respect to review of\nan order of removal under [§1252(a)(1)].”  §1252(b).  Re-\nspondents challenge their detention without bail, not an\norder of removal. \n  Neither does Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. \n338 (2011), bar these class actions.  Every member of each\nclass seeks the same relief (a bail hearing), every member\nhas been denied that relief, and the differences in situa-\ntion among members of the class are not relevant to their \nentitlement to a bail hearing. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 81 of 92   Page ID\n #:9820\n32  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nAt a minimum I can find nothing in the statute or in the\ncases to which the majority refers that would prevent the\nrespondents from pursuing their action, obtaining a de-\nclaratory  judgment,  and  then  using  that  judgment  to\nobtain relief, namely, a bail hearing, in an individual case.\nThus, I believe the lower courts are free to consider the \nconstitutionality  of  the  relevant  statutory  provisions  as\nthe majority now interprets them. \nV \nConclusion \nThe relevant constitutional language, purposes, history,\ntraditions, context, and case law, taken together, make it \nlikely that, where confinement of the noncitizens before us \nis prolonged (presumptively longer than six months), bail\nproceedings  are  constitutionally  required.    Given  this \nserious  constitutional  problem,  I  would  interpret  the \nstatutory provisions before us as authorizing bail.  Their \nlanguage  permits  that  reading,  it  furthers  their  basic \npurposes, and it is consistent with the history, tradition, \nand constitutional values associated with bail proceedings.\nI believe that those bail proceedings should take place in \naccordance with customary rules of procedure and burdens \nof proof rather than the special rules that the Ninth Cir-\ncuit imposed.\nThe bail questions before us are technical but at heart \nthey are simple.  We need only recall the words of the\nDeclaration of Independence, in particular its insistence \nthat  all  men  and  women  have  “certain  unalienable \nRights,” and that among them is the right to “Liberty.”\nWe  need merely  remember  that  the  Constitution’s  Due\nProcess Clause protects each person’s liberty from arbi-\ntrary deprivation.  And we need just keep in mind the fact\nthat, since Blackstone’s time and long before, liberty has\nincluded the right of a confined person to seek release on \nbail.  It is neither technical nor unusually difficult to read \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 82 of 92   Page ID\n #:9821\nCite as: 583 U.

The parties each submitted a proposed protective order following a \n4\n5\ndecision issued on May 3, 2012, in which the District Court ordered the \n6\nGovernment to disclose what is hereinafter designated as “Highly Confidential \n7\nInformation,” based on that court’s factual and legal conclusions that such \n8\n9\ndisclosure is consistent with statutory and regulatory language found in 8 U.S.C. § \n10\n1367 and 8 C.F.R. § 208.6.    Good cause exists for the entry of a protective order \n11\nbecause discovery in this action has and will result in the disclosure by the parties \n12\n13\nof information from electronic databases, administrative files (or “A-Files”), and \n14\nother sources concerning members of the class certified in this action and other \n15\n16 individuals, including (1) confidential personal and non-privileged information \n17\nand (2) certain categories of highly confidential information generally restricted \n18\nfrom unauthorized disclosure by statute or regulation.  The Court having found \n19\n20 that good cause exists for issuance of an appropriately-tailored confidentiality \n21\norder governing the pre-trial phase of this action, it is \n22\nHEREBY ORDERED that this Court’s July 6, 2011 Protective Order (ECF \n23\n24 188) is hereby superseded as follows: \n25\nI.  Authorization to Produce Information Protected by the Privacy Act – \n26\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(11), this Order authorizes Respondents to produce \n27\n28 private identifying information and other information discoverable pursuant to \n  1 \n\n \n1\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) that Petitioners seek without requiring officials of the United \n2\nStates to pre-screen each document for objections under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \n3\n§ 552a, and present those objections to this Court for a decision regarding \n4\n5\ndisclosure.    \n6\n      II.  Scope – The terms of this Order will govern the parties’ production \n7\nof information in response to discovery requests, to the extent that such production \n8\n9\ncontains information designated as “Confidential Information” or “Highly \n10\nConfidential Information” as defined in this Order.  The terms of this Order shall \n11\nalso govern the safeguarding of such information by all individuals referenced in \n12\n13\nthis Order.    \n14\n  III.  Definitions and Designation of Protected Information – \n15\n16    (a).  Definitions – \n17\n    (1).   “Confidential Information” – As used in this Order, \n18\n“Confidential Information” is defined as any information not publicly available \n19\n20 that is disclosed by the parties in this action and which at or before the time of \n21\ndisclosure has been designated as “Confidential Information” by the parties in \n22\naccordance with paragraph III(b).  The disclosure of all information that the \n23\n24 parties previously agreed to keep confidential, or which was designated as \n25\n“Confidential Information” under the July 6, 2011 Protective Order [ECF 188], \n26\nshall now be governed by this Order.  “Confidential Information” is the following: \n27\n28 (1) the names, alien numbers, locations of, or any other identifying information \n  2 \n\n \n1\nwhich would allow the identification of the particular individual(s) to whom the \n2\ninformation relates, (2) individual medical information, (3) certain individual \n3\nfinancial and tax information, (4) non-public divorce decrees, (5) identity \n4\n5\ninformation on law enforcement officials; (6) any information the parties \n6\npreviously agreed to include within the definition of “Confidential Information,” \n7\nand (7) any other category of information hereinafter given confidential status by \n8\n9\nthe Court.  If a designating party determines that information not described in this \n10\nparagraph should be included within the definition of “Confidential Information,” \n11\nthe parties shall negotiate the appropriateness of that designation in good faith and \n12\n13\nendeavor to resolve any dispute prior to the production of that information.  \n14\nInformation that is not “Confidential Information” includes, but is not limited to, \n15\n16 aggregate information concerning class members that does not permit the \n17\nidentification of the particular individuals to whom the information relates.   \n18\n      (2).  “Highly Confidential Information” – As used in this \n19\n20 Order, “Highly Confidential Information” is defined as any information not \n21\npublicly available that is disclosed by the parties in this action and which at or \n22\nbefore the time of disclosure has been designated as “Highly Confidential \n23\n24 Information” by the parties in accordance with paragraph III(b).  “Highly \n25\nConfidential Information” is the following:  (1) information contained in or \n26\npertaining to asylum claims or applications, including applications for relief under \n27\n28 the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”) and refugee information; (2) information \n  3 \n\n \n1\ncontained in or pertaining to legalization applications under 8 U.S.C. § 1255a; (3) \n2\ninformation contained in or pertaining to Special Agricultural Worker applications \n3\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1160; (4) information contained in or pertaining to applications \n4\n5\nfor temporary protected status (“TPS”) under 8 U.S.C. § 1254a; (5) information \n6\ncontemplated by 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(C) concerning any abused alien spouse or \n7\nchild, including information regarding the whereabouts of such spouse or child \n8\n9\n(see 8 C.F.R. §§ 216.5(a)(1)(iii) and 1216.5(a)(1)(iii); 8 U.S.C. § \n10\n1154(a)(1)(A)(iii), (iv), (v), and (vi); 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(B)(ii), (iii) and (iv)); \n11\nand (6) any other category of information hereinafter given “Highly Confidential” \n12\n13\nstatus by the Court.  Information that is not “Highly Confidential Information” \n14\nincludes, but is not limited to, aggregate information concerning class members \n15\n16 that does not permit the identification of the particular individuals to whom the \n17\ninformation relates.  If a designating party determines that information not \n18\ndescribed in this paragraph should be designated as “Highly Confidential \n19\n20 Information,” the parties shall negotiate the appropriateness of that designation in \n21\ngood faith and endeavor to resolve any dispute prior to the production of that \n22\ninformation.   \n23\n24       (b).  Designation – “Confidential Information” and “Highly \n25\nConfidential Information” may be designated by the parties in one or more of the \n26\nfollowing ways: \n27\n28\n  4 \n\n \n1\n      (1).   “Confidential Information” set forth in a response to an \n2\ninterrogatory may be so designated by including the word “Confidential” in the \n3\nresponse.  “Highly Confidential Information” set forth in a response to an \n4\n5\ninterrogatory may be so designated by including the words “Highly Confidential \n6\nInformation” in the response. \n7\n    (2).   “Confidential Information” contained in a document or \n8\n9\npart thereof may be so designated by marking the production of any “Confidential \n10\nInformation” with the words “CONFIDENTIAL.”  “Highly Confidential \n11\nInformation” contained in a document or part thereof shall be so designated by \n12\n13\nmarking the production of any “Highly Confidential Information” with the words \n14\n“HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY”.  The \n15\n16 designating party may also mark the production with the words “THIS \n17\nDOCUMENT IS SUBJECT TO A COURT ORDER IN RODRIGUEZ, ET AL. v. \n18\nROBBINS, ET AL., No. 07-cv-3239 (C.D. Cal.).  THIS DOCUMENT AND ITS \n19\n20 CONTENTS SHALL NOT BE USED, SHOWN OR DISTRIBUTED EXCEPT \n21\nAS PROVIDED IN THE PROTECTIVE ORDER ENTERED IN THIS \n22\nACTION.” \n23\n24     (3).   “Confidential Information” or “Highly Confidential \n25\nInformation” contained in any statement made during an oral deposition may be so \n26\ndesignated through a statement made on the record. \n27\n28\n  5 \n\n \n1\n      (4).    Information that is otherwise properly designated as \n2\n“Confidential Information” or “Highly Confidential Information” shall not be so \n3\ndesignated or considered where the detainee to whom the information refers has \n4\n5\naffirmatively consented to the non-confidential treatment of the disclosed \n6\ninformation, and that consent is presented in writing to the designating party prior \n7\nto disclosure.     \n8\n9\n   (c).  Contesting Designation– If a party disagrees with a designation \n10\nof “Confidential Information” or “Highly Confidential Information,” it shall \n11\nprovide the designating party written notice of its challenge.  If the parties cannot \n12\n13\nresolve this dispute, a non-designating party may object to and challenge the \n14\ndesignation of any information as “Confidential Information” or “Highly \n15\n16 Confidential Information” in a manner that comports with Local Rules 37-1 and \n17\n37-2.  The designating party bears the burden of showing that information is \n18\nconfidential.  Failure to challenge a designation immediately does not waive a \n19\n20 party’s ability to bring a later challenge.   \n21\n  IV.    Permitted Disclosure of Protected Information  –  \n22\n   (a).  Information designated as “Confidential Information,” \n23\n24 including the portion of any document containing “Confidential Information,” \n25\nmay be disclosed by a non-designating party only to the following persons: \n26\n27\n28\n  6 \n\n \n1\n    (1).

Rodriguez v. Hayes (Rodriguez I), 591 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2010). \n22\nThe class is defined as:\n23\nAll non-citizens within the Central District of California who:  (1) Are or\n24\nwere detained for longer than six months pursuant to one of the general\n25\nimmigration detention statutes pending completion of removal proceedings,\n26\nincluding judicial review; (2) Are not and have not been detained pursuant\n27\nto a national security detention statute; and (3) Have not been afforded a\n28\nOrder, Judgment & Permanent Injunction – Page 1 of 6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 353   Filed 08/06/13   Page 2 of 6   Page ID #:8278\nhearing to determine whether their detention is justified. \n1\n“General immigration statutes” in the class definition refers to 8 U.S.C. §§  1225(b),\n2\n1226 and 1231(a).  See Rodriguez I, 591 F.3d at 1113.   “Removal proceedings” does\n3\nnot narrowly refer to its use in 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, but to any proceedings to determine\n4\nwhether persons detained pursuant to the general immigration statutes, as defined in\n5\nRodriguez I, will be removed from the United States. \n6\nFor organizational purposes, the class is divided into four subclasses, as follows:\n7\n1. Class members detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b);\n8\n2. Class members detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a); \n9\n3. Class members detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c); and\n10\n4. Class members detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a).\n11\nThe Court provided for no exceptions to the definitions of class membership, yet\n12\nRespondents have unilaterally excluded certain detainees.  Consequently,\n13\n14 It is Ordered  that there are no exceptions, express or implied, to the class\nmembership definitions.\n15\n16 It is further Ordered  that class membership includes, inter alia, detainees\nincarcerated  for  restatement  under  8  U.S.C.  §  1231(a)(5),  detainees  held  for\n17\nproceedings initiated by an administrative removal order under 8 U.S.C. § 1228(b); and\n18\ndetainees held under the general immigration statutes after entering the United States\n19\nthrough the Visa Waiver Program.  \n20\nThere are no genuine issues of material fact, and neither party contests that those\n21\ndetained under § 1231 or § 1226(a) have a right to a bond hearing after six months of\n22\ndetention.  Most  of Respondents’s arguments were previously addressed by this Court\n23\nand affirmed by the Circuit in Rodriguez v. Robbins (Rodriguez II), 715 F.3d 1127 (9th\n24\nCir. 2013).  However, Respondents raises one new argument.  Respondents argue that\n25\nconstitutional concerns are not implicated because the Rodriguez II panel did not\n26\nconsider evidence that “a large number of aliens” extend the term of their own\n27\ndetention through their own actions, such as requests for continuances.  For this\n28\nOrder, Judgment & Permanent Injunction – Page 2 of 6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 353   Filed 08/06/13   Page 3 of 6   Page ID #:8279\nargument, Respondents rely on Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 526, 123 S. Ct. 1708,\n1\n1719, 155 L. Ed. 724, 739 (2003), which the Ninth Circuit explicitly construed to only\n2\nsupport brief periods of detention.  Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d at 1135.\n3\nThe procedural requirements for bond hearings are well settled in the Ninth\n4\nCircuit.  See Casas–Castrillon v. Department of Homeland Security, 535 F.3d 942 (9th\n5\nCir.  2008).    In  Rodriguez  II,  the  Ninth  Circuit  reaffirmed  that  the  procedural\n6\nrequirements for a Casas bond hearing are those articulated in Singh v. Holder, 638\n7\nF.3d 1196, 1203-10 (9th Cir. 2011).  Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d at 1135-36.  The\n8\ngovernment must prove by clear and convincing evidence that a detainee is a flight risk\n9\nor a danger to the community to justify the denial of bond at a Casas hearing. \n10\nRodriguez II, 715 F.3d at 1136.  Additionally, due process requires a contemporaneous\n11\nrecord of Casas hearings, so that a transcript or audio recording is available upon\n12\nrequest.  Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d at 1136.\n13\nPetitioners, now, request four additional procedural safeguards.  First, Petitioners\n14\nrequest that an Immigration Judge be required to consider whether the detainee will ever\n15\nbe removed.  Second, Petitioners request that an Immigration Judge be required to\n16\nconsider conditions short of incarceration.  Third, Petitioners request that the bond\n17\nhearings be automatically provided, rather than placing the burden on the detainee to\n18\nrequest the hearing.  Finally, Petitioners request that notice of the hearing be provided\n19\nto each detainee in plain language, reasonably calculated to inform a person unfamiliar\n20\nwith English and the United States legal system of the pendency of the hearing. \n21\nThe  first  and  second  proposed  procedural  additions  –  consideration  of  the\n22\nlikelihood of removal during a bond hearing, and consideration of alternatives to\n23\nincarceration – fall outside the ambit of Casas, Singh, and Rodriguez II.   Rodriguez II\n24\naffirmed that the purpose of a Casas bond hearing is to determine a detainee’s flight risk\n25\nand dangerousness.  Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d at 1135-36.  Accordingly, Petitioners’\n26\nrequest that Immigration Judges consider the likelihood of detainees’ ultimate removal\n27\nas a factor at bond hearings would drastically expand the scope and purpose of bond\n28\nOrder, Judgment & Permanent Injunction – Page 3 of 6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 353   Filed 08/06/13   Page 4 of 6   Page ID #:8280\nhearings.  Such a requirement would require legal and political analyses beyond what\n1\nwould otherwise be considered at a bond hearing, and would place an unreasonable\n2\nburden on overly burdened Immigration Judges.  As to the second request,  Immigration\n3\nJudges should already be considering restrictions short of incarceration,  including\n4\nhouse arrest with electronic monitoring, in determining a detainee’s flight risk and\n5\ndangerousness.  Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d at 1131.\n6\nOn the other hand, Petitioners’ request that the bond hearings be provided\n7\nautomatically and that the notice to detainees of the bond hearings be provided in plain\n8\nlanguage are consistent with the due process concerns of Casas, Singh, and Rodriguez\n9\nII. The bond hearing process would be fraught with peril if the Court were to place the\n10\nburden on detainees to request a bond hearing when the government is constitutionally\n11\nobligated to provide those hearings.  Accordingly, comprehendible notice must be\n12\nprovided to detainees for that notice to pass constitutional review. \n13\nPetitioners are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Members of all four\n14\nsubclasses – Sections 1231, 1226(a), 1226(c), and 1225(b) – should be afforded bond\n15\nhearings after six months of detention, consistent with Rodriguez II.  The procedural\n16\nrequirements of the bond hearings should be consistent with the findings of the Ninth\n17\nCircuit in Singh, and Rodriguez II.  Additionally, bond hearings should be provided\n18\nautomatically, and plain language notice, in writing, of the bond hearings should be\n19\nprovided to detainees prior to the hearing.\n20\n21 It is further Ordered that Petitioners’ motion for summary judgment be, and\n22 hereby is, Granted. \n23 It is further Ordered that Respondents’ motion for summary judgment be, and\n24 hereby is, Denied.\n25 It is further Ordered, Adjudged and Decreedt hat Judgment be, and hereby is,\n26 Entered in favor of Petitioners and against Respondents. \n27 It is further Ordered that Respondents and their agents, employees, assigns, and\n28 all those acting in concert with them be, and hereby are, Permanently Enjoined as follows:\nOrder, Judgment & Permanent Injunction – Page 4 of 6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 353   Filed 08/06/13   Page 5 of 6   Page ID #:8281\n1.  Respondents shall provide each class member, by the class member’s 181st\n1\nday of detention, with a a bond hearing before an Immigration Judge consistent with the\n2\nsubstantive and procedural requirements set forth in this Order and Casas, Singh, and\n3\nRodriguez II.\n4\n2.  The bond hearings shall be recorded or transcribed so that a written record\n5\ncan be made available if an appeal is taken.\n6\n3. At least seven days prior to providing any bond hearing conducted pursuant\n7\nto this Order, Respondents shall provide written notice, in plain language, to the \n8\ndetainee of his or her upcoming bond hearing.  For notice to be sufficient, Respondents\n9\nmust take reasonable steps to ensure receipt of the notice by the class member and class\n10\ncounsel. \n11\n4. For class members who have already been detained for more than six\n12\nmonths as of the date of this order, but who have not yet received a bond hearing\n13\npursuant to this Court’s preliminary injunction, Respondents shall provide a bond\n14\nhearing before an Immigration Judge consistent with the requirements of this Order and\n15\nCasas, Singh, and Rodriguez II,within 30 days of the date of this Order.\n16\n5. Within 60 days of the date of this Order, Respondents shall file a status\n17\nreport describing the steps taken to timely identify all current and future class members\n18\nand to ensure that they receive bond hearings and notice of those hearings.  Along with\n19\nthe status report, Respondents shall file under seal (with a copy served on class counsel)\n20\na list containing each class member’s name and alien number, the date of any scheduled\n21\nor completed bond hearing, whether the class member is or was represented, the\n22\nImmigration Judge who conducted or will conduct the hearing, the bond amount set, if\n23\nany, and whether any appeal has been taken. Respondents shall file and serve an\n24\nupdated status report and class member list every 90 days thereafter until August 1,\n25\n2015.  The updated reports and lists shall include the information for all class members\n26\nin detention as of the date of the prior report.  \n27\n6.  If Respondents determine that an individual is not a class member even\n28\nOrder, Judgment & Permanent Injunction – Page 5 of 6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 353   Filed 08/06/13   Page 6 of 6   Page ID #:8282\nthough that individual (a) is detained in Respondents’ custody within the Central\n1\nDistrict, (b) has been detained by Respondents for six months or longer, (c) is not\n2\ndetained under 8 U.S.C. § 1226a or 8 U.S.C. § 1531-37, and (d) remains detained even\n3\nthough the government does not have present authority to deport that individual,\n4\nRespondents shall notify class counsel of that individual’s circumstances and the reason\n5\nRespondents believe that individual is not a class member.\n6\n7. For class members in detention as of the date of this Order, Respondents\n7\nshall provide class counsel with notice of class member bond hearings at the same time\n8\nthat they provide notice to class members directly. \n9\n10\nDate: August 6, 2013\n11\n___________________________________\n12\n13 Terry J.

When considering the motion,\n26 the court may only take into account allegations and facts in the complaint and\nOrder – Page 1 of 4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 155    Filed 01/27/11   Page 2 of 4   Page ID #:1783\n1 answer.  Amfac Mortg. Corp. v. Arizona Mall of Tempe, Inc., 583 F.2d 426, 429\n2 (9th Cir. 1978).\n3\n4 Under the Entry Fiction Doctrine, those aliens who are not yet considered to\n5 be  on  American  soil  do  not  possess  constitutional  rights  with  regard  to  their\n6 application for admission.  Alvarez-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 1094, 1097 (9th\n7 Cir. 2004).  However, this doctrine only deals with the procedure for admitting\n8 aliens, not their substantive rights.  Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952,\n9 974 (9th Cir. 2004).  Non-admitted aliens are able to bring substantive Fourteenth\n10 Amendment claims, such as equal protection and due process.  Kwai Fun Wong, 373\n11 F.3d at 974.  Therefore, the Entry Fiction Doctrine does not preclude Plaintiff from\n12 bringing procedural due process claims under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b), regardless of the\n13 sub-class’s immigration status.\n14\n15 Mandatory detainment under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) does not require a bond\n16 hearing to satisfy due process.  Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 529 123 S. Ct. 1708,\n17 1721, 155 L. Ed. 2d 724, 732 (2003).  However, when an alien does not concede\n18 deportability,  this section only applies to expedited removal proceedings.  Tijani v.\n19 Willis, 430 F.3d 1241, 1242 (9th Cir. 2005).  When the Board of Immigration\n20 Appeals affirms the order of removal and administrative proceedings are complete,\n21 authority to detain the immigrant under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) ends, and the detention\n22 falls under the purview of 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a).  Casas-Castrillon v. DHS, 535 F.3d\n942, 948 (9th Cir. 2008).  At that point, a bond hearing must be held.  Casas-\n23\nCastrillon,  535  F.3d  at  950.    Otherwise,  this  prolonged  detention  of  a  legal\n24\npermanent resident would raise constitutional concerns.  Casas-Castrillon, 535 F.3d\n25\nat 950.\n26\nOrder – Page 2 of 4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 155    Filed 01/27/11   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #:1784\n1 Though due process does not require a bond hearing under 8 U.S.C. §\n2 1226(c), the authority to detain immigrants is limited.  Casas-Castrillon, 535 F.3d\n3 at 950.  Consequently, each immigrant detained under 1226(c) must receive a\n4 hearing, as, at some point, the authority to detain switches from 1226(c) to 1226(a),\n5 when all administrative hearings are complete.  Casas-Castrillon, 535 F.3d at 948. \n6 Thus, the statute can be interpreted to require a bond hearing after a certain amount\n7 of time, not only to comply with precedent, but to avoid constitutional concerns as\n8 well.  As such, Plaintiff’s claim would succeed.  \n9 Furthermore, the facts, as alleged, indicate that hundreds of immigrants are\n10 held for years under the authority of the other sections, without an individualized\n11 determination of their flight risk or danger to society.  Without a bond hearing, this\n12 prolonged detention raises due process issues, considering the aliens do not have an\n13 opportunity to contest their detainment.  The statute must be interpreted to avoid any\n14 potential due process issues.  Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 381, 125 S. Ct. 716,\n15 724, 160 L. Ed. 2d 734, 743 (2005).  As such, if the above facts are taken as true,\n16 there are due process concerns.  To avoid these issues, the court could hold the\n17 detention statute mandates bond hearings after a certain, reasonable period of time.\n18 Additionally, the Ninth Circuit has indicated this Court should determine in\n19 which fact scenarios bond hearings would be appropriate.  Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591\n20 F.3d 1105, 1115 (9th Cir. 2010).  The Circuit has, also, held that bond hearings are\n21 required when detention becomes prolonged, in order to avoid due process issues. \n22 Casas-Castrillon, 535 F.3d at 950.  Since many immigrants are held without a\nhearing for years, it is incumbent on this Court to construe the statute to require\n23\nbond hearings when detention becomes unreasonable. As such, the Court can grant\n24\nrelief to the class as a whole by interpreting the statute to require bond hearings after\n25\ndetainment has lasted an unreasonable length of time, in which case, Plaintiff has a\n26\nOrder – Page 3 of 4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 155    Filed 01/27/11   Page 4 of 4   Page ID #:1785\n1 remedy at law.  \n2\n3 It is Ordered that Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings be,\n4 and hereby is, Denied.\n5\n6 Date:   January 27, 2011\n7 ___________________________________\n8 Terry J.

HOLDER, et al., [101]\n16 Respondents.\n17\n18 The Court has considered Plaintiff’s motion for class certification, together\n19 with the moving papers and Respondents’ statement of non-opposition.\n20 To certify a class, it must satisfy commonality, typicality, numerosity, and\n21 adequacy requirements.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  For subclasses to exist, each\n22 subclass must meet these requirements as well.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(5).  The first\n23 requirement,  commonality,  ensures  that  all  absent  members  of  the  class  are\n24 adequately represented.  Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1045 (9th Cir. 1998).\n25 This requirement has been construed permissively, as in, it is not necessary for all\n26 questions of law and fact to be exactly the same.  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150\n   Order – Page 1 of 3\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 161    Filed 03/08/11   Page 2 of 3   Page ID #:1806\n1 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998).  It is only necessary that there be a common core\n2 of operative facts and legal issues.  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1019.  \n3 The second requirement, typicality, looks to whether the claims of the class\n4 representative adequately represent the claims of the class as a whole.  Armstrong\n5 v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001).  The claims must, also, share parallel\n6 legal arguments.  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 849.  Typicality is construed permissively\n7 as well, and only requires that the claims be reasonably similar, rather than identical.\n8 Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  \n9 Numerosity is satisfied if joinder of all parties is impractical.  Fed. R. Civ.\n10 P. 23(a).  A large number of plaintiffs generally satisfies this requirement.  Jordan\n11 v. Los Angeles County, 669 F.2d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir. 1982).  \n12 Finally, adequacy is fulfilled if the counsel for each named representative is\n13 sufficiently qualified, there is a shared interest between representatives and absent\n14 class members, and it is unlikely the suit is collusive.  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1046.\nAdditionally, the Circuit already determined that the class satisfies Rule 23(b)(2)’s\n15\nrequirements, given that the class as a whole seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.\n16\nRodriguez v. Holder, 951 F.3d 1105, 1125-26 (9th Cir. 2010). \n17\nAs  for  numerosity,  Plaintiff  conducted  a  random  sampling  from  the\n18\ngovernment’s list of 352 class members, and the result indicated that each subclass\n19\nwould contain at least forty five immigrants.  Joinder of all of these people would\n20\nbe  impractical,  and  thus  the  subclasses  satisfy  numerosity.    The  adequacy\n21\nrequirement is met, also, given that counsel consists of lawyers from the American\n22\nCivil Liberties Union, and each named plaintiff is seeking identical relief as the\n23\nabsentee class members.\n24\nThe proposed subclasses share a common question of law and fact, as well.\n25\nThe subclasses are divided along statutory lines, with each section containing a\n26\n   Order – Page 2 of 3\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 161    Filed 03/08/11   Page 3 of 3   Page ID #:1807\n1 subclass.  Therefore, each subclass member shares a similar factual pattern, having\n2 been detained under that section’s authority.  Though most situations are not exactly\n3 the same, commonality does not mandate that the fact patterns be identical.  Hanlon,\n4 150 F.3d at 1019.  Additionally, the questions of law under each section are the\n5 same:  Whether that section can be interpreted to require a bond hearing after six\n6 months, or, conversely, whether the procedures already in place satisfy due process.\n7 Therefore, the commonality requirement is met.\n8 As for the typicality requirement, each named representative has been detained\n9 under the authority of the various sections for over six months.  Thus, the named\n10 plaintiff shares a common underlying fact pattern with the absent class members,\n11 otherwise he would be detained under a different section.  Furthermore, the remedy\n12 the named plaintiff is seeking is identical to the other class members: Declaratory\n13 and injunctive relief, mandating a bond hearing after a detention of more than six\n14 months.  Therefore, typicality is satisfied.  Thus, all the requirements of Rule 23 are\nmet for each subclass. \n15\n16 It is Ordered that Plaintiff’s motion for class certification shall be, and hereby\n17 is, Granted.\n18\nDate:   March 8, 2011\n19\n___________________________________\n20\n21 Terry J.

RODRIGUEZ ET AL., INDIVIDUALLY \nAND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE NINTH CIRCUIT \nNo. 15–1204.  Argued November 30, 2016—Reargued October 3, \n2017—Decided February 27, 2018 \nImmigration officials are authorized to detain certain aliens in the\ncourse of immigration proceedings while they determine whether \nthose aliens may be lawfully present in the country.  For example,\n§1225(b) of Title 8 of the U. S. Code authorizes the detention of cer-\ntain aliens seeking to enter the country.  Section 1225(b)(1) applies to\naliens initially determined to be inadmissible due to fraud, misrepre-\nsentation, or lack of valid documentation, and to certain other aliens \ndesignated  by  the  Attorney  General  in  his  discretion.    Section \n1225(b)(2) is a catchall provision that applies to most other appli-\ncants for admission not covered by §1225(b)(1).  Under §1225(b)(1), \naliens are normally ordered removed “without further hearing or re-\nview,” §1225(b)(1)(A)(i), but an alien indicating either an intention to \napply for asylum or a credible fear of persecution, §1225(b)(1)(A)(ii),\n“shall be detained” while that alien’s asylum application is pending,\n§1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  Aliens covered by §1225(b)(2) in turn “shall be de-\ntained for a [removal] proceeding” if an immigration officer “deter-\nmines that [they are] not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled” to ad-\nmission. §1225(b)(2)(A).\nThe Government is also authorized to detain certain aliens already\nin the country.  Section 1226(a)’s default rule permits the Attorney \nGeneral to issue warrants for the arrest and detention of these aliens \npending the outcome of their removal proceedings.  The Attorney \nGeneral “may release” these aliens on bond, “[e]xcept as provided in \nsubsection (c) of this section.”  Section 1226(c) in turn states that the\nAttorney General “shall take into custody any alien” who falls into\none of the enumerated categories involving criminal offenses and ter-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 3 of 92   Page ID #:9742\n2  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nSyllabus \nrorist activities, §1226(c)(1), and specifies that the Attorney General\n“may release” one of those aliens “only if the Attorney General de-\ncides” both that doing so is necessary for witness-protection purposes \nand that the alien will not pose a danger or flight risk, §1226(c)(2). \nAfter a 2004 conviction, respondent Alejandro Rodriguez, a Mexi-\ncan citizen and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, \nwas detained pursuant to §1226 while the Government sought to re-\nmove him.  In May 2007, while still litigating his removal, Rodriguez \nfiled a habeas petition, claiming that he was entitled to a bond hear-\ning to determine whether his continued detention was justified.  As \nrelevant here, he and the class of aliens he represents allege that \n§§1225(b), 1226(a), and 1226(c) do not authorize “prolonged” deten-\ntion in the absence of an individualized bond hearing at which the \nGovernment proves by clear and convincing evidence that detention\nremains justified.  The District Court entered a permanent injunc-\ntion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  Relying on the canon of consti-\ntutional  avoidance,  the  Ninth  Circuit  construed  §§1225(b)  and \n1226(c) as imposing an implicit 6-month time limit on an alien’s de-\ntention under those sections.  After that point, the court held, the \nGovernment may continue to detain the alien only under the authority\nof §1226(a).  The court then construed §1226(a) to mean that an alien\nmust be given a bond hearing every six months and that detention\nbeyond the initial 6-month period is permitted only if the Govern-\nment proves by clear and convincing evidence that further detention\nis justified. \nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. \n804 F. 3d 1060, reversed and remanded. \nJUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part\nII, concluding that §§1225(b), 1226(a), and 1226(c) do not give de-\ntained aliens the right to periodic bond hearings during the course of\ntheir detention.  The Ninth Circuit misapplied the canon of constitu-\ntional avoidance in holding otherwise.  Pp. 12–31.\n(a) The canon of constitutional avoidance “comes into play only\nwhen, after the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is\nfound to be susceptible of more than one [plausible] construction.” \nClark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 385.  The Ninth Circuit’s interpre-\ntations of the provisions at issue, however, are implausible.  Pp. 12– \n13. \n(b) Read most naturally, §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) mandate detention\nof applicants for admission until certain proceedings have concluded. \nUntil that point, nothing in the statutory text imposes a limit on the \nlength of detention, and neither provision says anything about bond \nhearings.  Pp. 13–19.\n(1) Nothing in the text of §1225(b)(1) or §1225(b)(2) hints that \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 4 of 92   Page ID #:9743\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  3 \nSyllabus \nthose provisions have an implicit 6-month time limit on the length of \ndetention.  Respondents must show that this is a plausible reading in\norder to prevail under the canon of constitutional avoidance, but they\nsimply invoke the canon without making any attempt to defend their \nreading.\nThe Ninth Circuit also all but ignored the statutory text, relying \ninstead on Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, as authority for grafting\na time limit onto §1225(b)’s text.  There, this Court invoked the \nconstitutional-avoidance canon, construing §1231(a)(6)—which pro-\nvides than an alien subject to a removal order “may be detained” be-\nyond the section’s 90-day removal period—to mean that the alien\nmay not be detained beyond “a period reasonably necessary to secure \nremoval,” id., at 699, presumptively six months, id., at 701.  The \nCourt detected ambiguity in the statutory phrase “may be detained”\nand noted the absence of any explicit statutory limit on the length of\npermissible detention following the entry of an order of removal. \nSeveral material differences distinguish the provisions at issue in \nthis case from Zadvydas’s interpretation of §1231(a)(6).  To start, the \nprovisions here, unlike §1231(a)(6), mandate detention for a specified\nperiod  of  time:  until  immigration  officers  have  finished  “consid-\ner[ing]” the asylum application, §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), or until removal\nproceedings have concluded, §1225(b)(2)(A).  Section 1231(a)(6) also\nuses the ambiguous “may,” while §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) use the une-\nquivocal mandate “shall be detained.”  There is also a specific provi-\nsion authorizing temporary parole from §1225(b) detention “for ur-\ngent  humanitarian  reasons  or  significant  public  benefit,” \n§1182(d)(5)(A), but no similar release provision applies to §1231(a)(6).\nThat express exception implies that there are no other circumstances \nunder  which  aliens  detained  under  §1225(b)  may  be  released. \nPp. 14–17. \n(2) Respondents also claim that the term “for” in §§1225(b)(1)\nand (b)(2) mandates detention only until the start of applicable pro-\nceedings.  That is inconsistent with the meanings of “for”—“[d]uring\n[or] throughout,” 6 Oxford English Dictionary 26, and “with the object \nor purpose of,” id., at 23—that make sense in the context of the statu-\ntory scheme as a whole.  Nor does respondents’ reading align with the\nhistorical use of “for” in §1225.  Pp. 17–19.\n(c) Section 1226(c)’s language is even clearer. By allowing aliens to\nbe released “only if ” the Attorney General decides that certain condi-\ntions are met, that provision reinforces the conclusion that aliens de-\ntained under its authority are not entitled to be released under any \ncircumstances other than those expressly recognized by the statute.\nTogether with §1226(a), §1226(c) makes clear that detention of aliens\nwithin its scope must continue “pending a decision” on removal.

RODRIGUEZ \nSyllabus \ntion 1226(c) is thus not silent as to the length of detention.  See \nDemore v. Kim, 538 U. S. 510, 529.  The provision, by expressly stat-\ning that covered aliens may be released “only if ” certain conditions \nare met, also unequivocally imposes an affirmative prohibition on re-\nleasing them under any other conditions.  Finally, because §1226(c)\nand the PATRIOT Act apply to different categories of aliens in differ-\nent ways, adopting §1226(c)’s plain meaning will not make any part\nof the PATRIOT Act, see §1226a(a)(3), superfluous.  Pp. 19–22. \n(d) Nothing in §1226(a), which authorizes the Attorney General to \narrest and detain an alien “pending a decision” on removal and which\npermits the Attorney General to release the alien on bond, supports \nthe imposition of periodic bond hearings every six months in which\nthe Attorney General must prove by clear and convincing evidence \nthat continued detention is necessary.  Nor does it hint that the \nlength of detention prior to the bond hearing must be considered in\ndetermining whether an alien should be released.  Pp. 22–23.\n(e) The Ninth Circuit should consider the merits of respondents’\nconstitutional arguments in the first instance.  But before doing so, it\nshould also reexamine whether respondents can continue litigating\ntheir claims as a class.

Immigra-\ntion officials must also determine on a daily basis whether \nthere are grounds for removing any of the aliens who are \nalready present inside the country.  The vast majority of \nthese determinations are quickly made, but in some cases \ndeciding whether an alien should be admitted or removed \nis not as easy.  As a result, Congress has authorized immi-\ngration officials to detain some classes of aliens during the \ncourse  of  certain  immigration  proceedings.    Detention \nduring those proceedings gives immigration officials time \nto determine an alien’s status without running the risk of \nthe  alien’s  either  absconding  or  engaging  in  criminal \n—————— \n* JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins only Part III–C of this opinion. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 7 of 92   Page ID #:9746\n2  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nactivity before a final decision can be made.\nIn this case we are asked to interpret three provisions of \nU. S. immigration law that authorize the Government to\ndetain aliens in the course of immigration proceedings. \nAll parties appear to agree that the text of these provi-\nsions, when read most naturally, does not give detained \naliens the right to periodic bond hearings during the course \nof their detention.  But by relying on the constitutional-\navoidance canon of statutory interpretation, the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit held that detained aliens\nhave a statutory right to periodic bond hearings under the \nprovisions at issue.\nUnder the constitutional-avoidance canon, when statu-\ntory language is susceptible of multiple interpretations, a\ncourt  may  shun  an  interpretation  that  raises  serious \nconstitutional doubts and instead may adopt an alterna-\ntive that avoids those problems.  But a court relying on \nthat canon still must interpret the statute, not rewrite it. \nBecause the Court of Appeals in this case adopted implau-\nsible constructions of the three immigration provisions at\nissue,  we  reverse  its  judgment  and  remand  for  further\nproceedings. \nI \nA \nTo implement its immigration policy, the Government \nmust be able to decide (1) who may enter the country and \n(2) who may stay here after entering. \n1 \nThat process of decision generally begins at the Nation’s\nborders and ports of entry, where the Government must \ndetermine whether an alien seeking to enter the country is\nadmissible.  Under 122 Stat. 867, 8 U. S. C. §1225, an\nalien who “arrives in the United States,” or “is present” in \nthis country but “has not been admitted,” is treated as “an \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 8 of 92   Page ID #:9747\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  3 \nOpinion of the Court \napplicant  for  admission.”  §1225(a)(1).    Applicants  for\nadmission must “be inspected by immigration officers” to\nensure that they may be admitted into the country con-\nsistent with U. S. immigration law.  §1225(a)(3). \nAs relevant here, applicants for admission fall into one \nof two categories, those covered by §1225(b)(1) and those \ncovered  by  §1225(b)(2).  Section  1225(b)(1)  applies  to\naliens  initially  determined  to  be  inadmissible  due  to \nfraud, misrepresentation, or lack of valid documentation.\nSee §1225(b)(1)(A)(i) (citing §§1182(a)(6)(C), (a)(7)).  Sec-\ntion 1225(b)(1) also applies to certain other aliens desig-\nnated  by  the  Attorney  General  in  his  discretion.  See \n§1225(b)(1)(A)(iii).  Section 1225(b)(2) is broader.  It serves \nas a catchall provision that applies to all applicants for \nadmission not covered by §1225(b)(1) (with specific excep-\ntions not relevant here).  See §§1225(b)(2)(A), (B).\nBoth §1225(b)(1) and §1225(b)(2) authorize the deten-\ntion of certain aliens.  Aliens covered by §1225(b)(1) are \nnormally  ordered  removed  “without  further  hearing  or \nreview”  pursuant  to  an  expedited  removal  process. \n§1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  But  if  a  §1225(b)(1)  alien  “indicates \neither an intention to apply for asylum . . . or a fear of \npersecution,”  then  that  alien  is  referred  for  an  asylum\ninterview.  §1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).  If  an  immigration  officer\ndetermines after that interview that the alien has a credi-\nble fear of persecution, “the alien shall be detained for \nfurther  consideration  of  the  application  for  asylum.” \n§1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  Aliens  who  are  instead  covered  by\n§1225(b)(2) are detained pursuant to a different process. \nThose aliens “shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding” \nif an immigration officer “determines that [they are] not \nclearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted” into \nthe country.  §1225(b)(2)(A). \nRegardless  of  which  of  those  two  sections  authorizes \ntheir detention, applicants for admission may be tempo-\nrarily released on parole “for urgent humanitarian reasons \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 9 of 92   Page ID #:9748\n4  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nor significant public benefit.”  §1182(d)(5)(A); see also 8 \nCFR  §§212.5(b),  235.3  (2017).    Such  parole,  however,\n“shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien.”  8 \nU. S. C. §1182(d)(5)(A).  Instead, when the purpose of the \nparole has been served, “the alien shall forthwith return\nor be returned to the custody from which he was paroled\nand thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in \nthe same manner as that of any other applicant for admis-\nsion to the United States.”  Ibid. \n2 \nEven once inside the United States, aliens do not have \nan absolute right to remain here.  For example, an alien\npresent in the country may still be removed if he or she \nfalls “within one or more . . . classes of deportable aliens.” \n§1227(a).  That includes aliens who were inadmissible at \nthe time of entry or who have been convicted of certain\ncriminal offenses since admission.  See §§1227(a)(1), (2). \nSection 1226 generally governs the process of arresting\nand detaining that group of aliens pending their removal.\nAs relevant here, §1226 distinguishes between two differ-\nent categories of aliens.  Section 1226(a) sets out the de-\nfault rule: The Attorney General may issue a warrant for\nthe arrest and detention of an alien “pending a decision on \nwhether  the  alien  is  to  be  removed  from  the  United \nStates.”  §1226(a).  “Except as provided in subsection (c) of \nthis section,” the Attorney General “may release” an alien \ndetained under §1226(a) “on bond . . . or conditional pa-\nrole.”  Ibid. \nSection 1226(c), however, carves out a statutory category \nof aliens who may not be released under §1226(a).  Under \n§1226(c), the “Attorney General shall take into custody \nany alien” who falls into one of several enumerated cate-\ngories involving criminal offenses and terrorist activities.\n§1226(c)(1).  The Attorney General may release aliens in\nthose categories “only if the Attorney General decides . . . \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 10 of 92   Page ID\n #:9749\nCite as: 583 U.

Any \nrelease under those narrow conditions “shall take place in \naccordance with a procedure that considers the severity of\nthe offense committed by the alien.”  Ibid.1 \nIn sum, U. S. immigration law authorizes the Govern-\nment to detain certain aliens seeking admission into the \ncountry under §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2).  It also authorizes \nthe Government to detain certain aliens already in the \ncountry  pending  the  outcome  of  removal  proceedings \nunder §§1226(a) and (c).  The primary issue is the proper \ninterpretation of §§1225(b), 1226(a), and 1226(c). \nB \nRespondent Alejandro Rodriguez is a Mexican citizen.\nSince 1987, he has also been a lawful permanent resident \nof the United States.  In April 2004, after Rodriguez was \nconvicted  of  a  drug  offense  and  theft  of  a  vehicle,  the\nGovernment  detained  him  under  §1226  and  sought  to \nremove him from the country.  At his removal hearing,\nRodriguez argued both that he was not removable and, in\nthe alternative, that he was eligible for relief from removal.\nIn July 2004, an Immigration Judge ordered Rodriguez\ndeported to Mexico.  Rodriguez chose to appeal that deci-\nsion to the Board of Immigration Appeals, but five months \n—————— \n1Anyone who believes that he is not covered by §1226(c) may also ask\nfor what is known as a “Joseph hearing.”  See Matter of Joseph, 22 \nI. & N. Dec. 799 (BIA 1999).  At a Joseph hearing, that person “may\navoid mandatory detention by demonstrating that he is not an alien,\nwas not convicted of the predicate crime, or that the [Government] is \notherwise substantially unlikely to establish that he is in fact subject to\nmandatory detention.”  Demore v. Kim, 538 U. S. 510, 514, n. 3 (2003). \nWhether respondents are entitled to Joseph hearings is not before this\nCourt. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 11 of 92   Page ID\n #:9750\n6  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nlater  the  Board  agreed  that  Rodriguez  was  subject  to \nmandatory removal.  Once again, Rodriguez chose to seek \nfurther review, this time petitioning the Court of Appeals \nfor the Ninth Circuit for review of the Board’s decision. \nIn May 2007, while Rodriguez was still litigating his\nremoval in the Court of Appeals, he filed a habeas petition \nin the District Court for the Central District of California, \nalleging that he was entitled to a bond hearing to deter-\nmine  whether  his  continued  detention  was  justified.\nRodriguez’s case was consolidated with another, similar \ncase  brought  by  Alejandro  Garcia,  and  together  they \nmoved for class certification. The District Court denied \ntheir motion, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit reversed.  See Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F. 3d 1105, \n1111 (2010).  It concluded that the proposed class met the \ncertification requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure, and it remanded the case to the Dis-\ntrict Court.  Id., at 1111, 1126. \nOn remand, the District Court certified the following\nclass: \n“[A]ll non-citizens within the Central District of Cali-\nfornia who: (1) are or were detained for longer than \nsix months pursuant to one of the general immigra-\ntion detention statutes pending completion of removal \nproceedings, including judicial review, (2) are not and \nhave not been detained pursuant to a national security \ndetention statute, and (3) have not been afforded a\nhearing to determine whether their detention is justi-\nfied.”  Class Certification Order in Rodriguez v. Hayes, \nCV 07–03239 (CD Cal., Apr. 5, 2010). \nThe District Court named Rodriguez as class representa-\ntive of the newly certified class, ibid., and then organized\nthe class into four subclasses based on the four “general\nimmigration  detention  statutes”  under  which  it  under-\nstood the class members to be detained: Sections 1225(b), \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 12 of 92   Page ID\n #:9751\nCite as: 583 U.

Holder, \nCV 07–03239 (CD Cal., Mar. 8, 2011) (2011 Order); Rodri-\nguez v. Robbins, 715 F. 3d 1127, 1130–1131 (CA9 2013).\nEach of the four subclasses was certified to pursue declar-\natory and injunctive relief.  2011 Order.  On appeal, the\nCourt of Appeals held that the §1231(a) subclass had been\nimproperly certified, but it affirmed the certification of the \nother  three  subclasses.   See  Rodriguez  v. Robbins,  804 \nF. 3d 1060, 1074, 1085–1086 (CA9 2015). \nIn their complaint, Rodriguez and the other respondents \nargued that the relevant statutory provisions—§§1225(b),\n1226(a), and 1226(c)—do not authorize “prolonged” deten-\ntion in the absence of an individualized bond hearing at \nwhich  the  Government  proves  by  clear  and  convincing\nevidence that the class member’s detention remains justi-\nfied.  Absent such a bond-hearing requirement, respond-\nents continued, those three provisions would violate the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  In their \nprayer  for  relief,  respondents  thus  asked  the  District \nCourt to require the Government “to provide, after giving\nnotice, individual hearings before an immigration judge\nfor . . . each member of the class, at which [the Govern-\nment] will bear the burden to prove by clear and convinc-\ning evidence that no reasonable conditions will ensure the\ndetainee’s presence in the event of removal and protect the \ncommunity  from  serious  danger,  despite  the  prolonged\nlength of detention at issue.”  Third Amended Complaint \nin Rodriguez v. Holder, CV 07–03239, p. 31 (CD Cal., Oct. \n20,  2010).  Respondents  also  sought  declaratory  relief. \nIbid. \nAs relevant here, the District Court entered a perma-\nnent injunction in line with the relief sought by respond-\nents, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  See 804 F. 3d, at \n1065.  Relying  heavily  on  the  canon  of  constitutional\navoidance, the Court of Appeals construed §§1225(b) and \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 13 of 92   Page ID\n #:9752\n8  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of ALITO, J. \n1226(c) as imposing an implicit 6-month time limit on an\nalien’s detention under these sections.  Id., at 1079, 1082. \nAfter that point, the Court of Appeals held, the Govern-\nment  may  continue  to  detain  the  alien  only  under  the\nauthority of §1226(a).  Ibid.  The Court of Appeals then \nconstrued §1226(a) to mean that an alien must be given a\nbond hearing every six months and that detention beyond \nthe initial 6-month period is permitted only if the Gov-\nernment  proves  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that\nfurther detention is justified.  Id., at 1085, 1087. \nThe Government petitioned this Court for review of that\ndecision, and we granted certiorari.  579 U. S. ___ (2016). \nII \nBefore reaching the merits of the lower court’s interpre-\ntation, we briefly address whether we have jurisdiction to\nentertain respondents’ claims.  We discuss two potential\nobstacles, 8 U. S. C. §§1252(b)(9) and 1226(e). \nA \n  Under §1252(b)(9): \n“Judicial review of all questions of law and fact, in-\ncluding interpretation and application of constitutional\nand  statutory  provisions,  arising  from  any  action\ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from\nthe United States under this subchapter [including\n§§1225 and 1226] shall be available only in judicial \nreview of a final order under this section.” \nThis provision does not deprive us of jurisdiction.  We \nare  required  in  this  case  to  decide  “questions  of  law,”\nspecifically, whether, contrary to the decision of the Court\nof Appeals, certain statutory provisions require detention \nwithout a bond hearing.  We assume for the sake of argu-\nment that the actions taken with respect to all the aliens \nin  the  certified  class  constitute  “action[s]  taken  . . .  to \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 14 of 92   Page ID\n #:9753\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  9 \nOpinion of ALITO, J. \nremove [them] from the United States.”2  On that assump-\ntion, the applicability of §1252(b)(9) turns on whether the\nlegal  questions  that  we  must  decide  “aris[e]  from”  the\nactions taken to remove these aliens. \nIt may be argued that this is so in the sense that if those \nactions had never been taken, the aliens would not be in \ncustody  at  all.    But  this  expansive  interpretation  of \n§1252(b)(9) would lead to staggering results.  Suppose, for\nexample, that a detained alien wishes to assert a claim\nunder Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 \nU. S. 388 (1971), based on allegedly inhumane conditions\nof confinement.  See, e.g., Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U. S. ___, \n___–___ (2017) (slip op., at 23–29).  Or suppose that a \ndetained alien brings a state-law claim for assault against \na guard or fellow detainee.  Or suppose that an alien is\ninjured when a truck hits the bus transporting aliens to a\ndetention facility, and the alien sues the driver or owner of \nthe truck.  The “questions of law and fact” in all those \ncases could be said to “aris[e] from” actions taken to re-\nmove the aliens in the sense that the aliens’ injuries would \nnever have occurred if they had not been placed in deten-\ntion.  But cramming judicial review of those questions into\nthe review of final removal orders would be absurd. \nInterpreting “arising from” in this extreme way would\nalso make claims of prolonged detention effectively unre-\nviewable.  By the time a final order of removal was even-\ntually  entered,  the  allegedly  excessive  detention  would \nhave already taken place.  And of course, it is possible that\nno such order would ever be entered in a particular case,\ndepriving  that  detainee  of  any  meaningful  chance  for\njudicial review.\nIn past cases, when confronted with capacious phrases \n—————— \n2It is questionable whether this is true for aliens who are detained\nunder 8 U. S. C. §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) for consideration of their asylum \napplications. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 15 of 92   Page ID\n #:9754\n10  JENNINGS v.

S. 471, 482 (1999), we took \nthis approach in construing the very phrase that appears \nin §1252(b)(9).  A neighboring provision of the Immigra-\ntion and Nationality Act refers to “any cause or claim by or\non behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action \nby the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudi-\ncate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien\nunder this chapter.”  8 U. S. C. §1252(g) (emphasis added).\nWe did not interpret this language to sweep in any claim \nthat can technically be said to “arise from” the three listed\nactions of the Attorney General.  Instead, we read the \nlanguage to refer to just those three specific actions them-\nselves.  American-Arab  Anti-Discrimination  Comm.,  su-\npra, at 482–483. \nThe parties in this case have not addressed the scope of \n§1252(b)(9), and it is not necessary for us to attempt to \nprovide  a  comprehensive  interpretation.

Under these circumstances, §1252(b)(9) does\nnot present a jurisdictional bar.3 \nB \nWe likewise hold that §1226(e) does not bar us from\nconsidering respondents’ claims.\nThat provision states: \n“The  Attorney  General’s  discretionary  judgment  re-\ngarding the application of [§1226] shall not be subject \nto review.  No court may set aside any action or deci-\nsion by the Attorney General under this section re-\ngarding the detention or release of any alien or the \ngrant,  revocation,  or  denial  of  bond  or  parole.”\n§1226(e). \nAs we have previously explained, §1226(e) precludes an\nalien from “challeng[ing] a ‘discretionary judgment’ by the \nAttorney General or a ‘decision’ that the Attorney General\nhas made regarding his detention or release.”  Demore v. \nKim, 538 U. S. 510, 516 (2003).  But §1226(e) does not \npreclude  “challenges  [to]  the  statutory  framework  that \npermits [the alien’s] detention without bail.”  Id., at 517. \nRespondents mount that second type of challenge here. \n—————— \n3The concurrence contends that “detention is an ‘action taken . . . to \nremove’ an alien” and that therefore “even the narrowest reading of \n‘arising from’ must cover” the claims raised by respondents.  Post, at 6. \nWe do not follow this logic.  We will assume for the sake of argument\nthat detention is an action taken “to remove an alien,” i.e., for the \npurpose of removing an alien, rather than simply an action aimed at\nensuring that the alien does not flee or commit a crime while his\nproceedings are pending.  But even if we proceed on the basis of that \nassumption, we do not see what it proves.  The question is not whether \ndetention is an action taken to remove an alien but whether the legal \nquestions in this case arise from such an action.  And for the reasons \nexplained above, those legal questions are too remote from the actions \ntaken to fall within the scope of §1252(b)(9). \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 17 of 92   Page ID\n #:9756\n12  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nFirst and foremost, they are challenging the extent of the\nGovernment’s  detention  authority  under  the  “statutory\nframework” as a whole.  If that challenge fails, they are \nthen contesting the constitutionality of the entire statutory \nscheme under the Fifth Amendment.  Because the extent \nof the Government’s detention authority is not a matter of\n“discretionary judgment,” “action,” or “decision,” respond-\nents’ challenge to “the statutory framework that permits \n[their] detention without bail,” ibid., falls outside of the \nscope of §1226(e).  We may therefore consider the merits of \ntheir claims. \nIII \nWhen “a serious doubt” is raised about the constitution-\nality of an act of Congress, “it is a cardinal principle that\nthis Court will first ascertain whether a construction of \nthe statute is fairly possible by which the question may be\navoided.”  Crowell  v.  Benson,  285  U. S.  22,  62  (1932). \nRelying  on  this  canon  of  constitutional  avoidance,  the\nCourt of Appeals construed §§1225(b), 1226(a), and 1226(c) \nto  limit  the  permissible  length  of  an  alien’s  detention \nwithout a bond hearing.  Without such a construction, the \nCourt of Appeals believed, the “‘prolonged detention with-\nout adequate procedural protections’” authorized by the \nprovisions “‘would raise serious constitutional concerns.’”  \n804 F. 3d, at 1077 (quoting Casas-Castrillon v. DHS, 535 \nF. 3d 942, 950 (CA9 2008)).\nThe canon of constitutional avoidance “comes into play\nonly when, after the application of ordinary textual analy-\nsis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one \nconstruction.”    Clark  v.  Martinez,  543  U. S.  371,  385 \n(2005).  In the absence of more than one plausible con-\nstruction, the canon simply “‘has no application.’”  Warger \nv. Shauers, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 10) (quot-\ning United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coopera-\ntive, 532 U.

S. ____ (2018)  13 \nOpinion of the Court \nThe Court of Appeals misapplied the canon in this case\nbecause its interpretations of the three provisions at issue\nhere are implausible.  In Parts III–A and III–B, we hold \nthat,  subject  only  to  express  exceptions,  §§1225(b)  and \n1226(c)  authorize  detention  until  the  end  of  applicable\nproceedings.  And in Part III–C, we hold that there is no \njustification for any of the procedural requirements that \nthe Court of Appeals layered onto §1226(a) without any \narguable statutory foundation. \nA \nAs noted, §1225(b) applies primarily to aliens seeking \nentry into the United States (“applicants for admission” in \nthe language of the statute).  Section 1225(b) divides these\napplicants into two categories.  First, certain aliens claim-\ning a credible fear of persecution under §1225(b)(1) “shall \nbe detained for further consideration of the application for \nasylum.”  §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  Second, aliens falling within \nthe scope of §1225(b)(2) “shall be detained for a [removal] \nproceeding.”  §1225(b)(2)(A).\nRead most naturally, §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) thus man-\ndate detention of applicants for admission until certain\nproceedings have concluded.  Section 1225(b)(1) aliens are \ndetained for “further consideration of the application for \nasylum,” and §1225(b)(2) aliens are in turn detained for \n“[removal]  proceeding[s].”    Once  those  proceedings  end, \ndetention under §1225(b) must end as well.  Until that \npoint, however, nothing in the statutory text imposes any \nlimit on the length of detention.  And neither §1225(b)(1)\nnor  §1225(b)(2)  says  anything  whatsoever  about  bond \nhearings.\nDespite the clear language of §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2),\nrespondents argue—and the Court of Appeals held—that \nthose provisions nevertheless can be construed to contain \nimplicit limitations on the length of detention.  But nei-\nther  of  the  two  limiting  interpretations  offered  by  re-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 19 of 92   Page ID\n #:9758\n14  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nspondents is plausible. \n1 \nFirst,  respondents  argue  that  §§1225(b)(1)  and  (b)(2)\ncontain an implicit 6-month limit on the length of deten-\ntion.  Once  that  6-month  period  elapses,  respondents\ncontend, aliens previously detained under those provisions\nmust instead be detained under the authority of §1226(a),\nwhich allows for bond hearings in certain circumstances. \nThere  are  many  problems  with  this  interpretation.\nNothing in the text of §1225(b)(1) or §1225(b)(2) even hints\nthat those provisions restrict detention after six months,\nbut respondents do not engage in any analysis of the text. \nInstead,  they  simply  cite  the  canon  of  constitutional \navoidance and urge this Court to use that canon to read a\n“six-month reasonableness limitation” into §1225(b).  Brief \nfor Respondents 48.\nThat is not how the canon of constitutional avoidance \nworks.   Spotting a  constitutional issue does not give  a \ncourt  the  authority  to  rewrite  a  statute  as  it  pleases.\nInstead, the canon permits a court to “choos[e] between\ncompeting plausible interpretations of a statutory text.” \nClark, supra, at 381 (emphasis added).  To prevail, re-\nspondents must thus show that §1225(b)’s detention provi-\nsions may plausibly be read to contain an implicit 6-month\nlimit.  And they do not even attempt to defend that read-\ning of the text.\nIn much the same manner, the Court of Appeals all but\nignored the statutory text.  Instead, it read Zadvydas v. \nDavis,  533  U. S.  678  (2001),  as  essentially  granting  a \nlicense  to  graft  a  time  limit  onto  the  text  of  §1225(b). \nZadvydas, however, provides no such authority. \nZadvydas concerned §1231(a)(6), which authorizes the \ndetention  of  aliens  who  have  already  been  ordered  re-\nmoved from the country.  Under this section, when an \nalien is ordered removed, the Attorney General is directed \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 20 of 92   Page ID\n #:9759\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  15 \nOpinion of the Court \nto complete removal within a period of 90 days, 8 U. S. C.\n§1231(a)(1)(A), and the alien must be detained during that\nperiod,  §1231(a)(2).    After  that  time  elapses,  however,\n§1231(a)(6)  provides  only  that  certain  aliens  “may  be \ndetained”  while  efforts  to  complete  removal  continue. \n(Emphasis added.)\nIn Zadvydas, the Court construed §1231(a)(6) to mean \nthat an alien who has been ordered removed may not be\ndetained beyond “a period reasonably necessary to secure\nremoval,” 533 U. S., at 699, and it further held that six \nmonths is a presumptively reasonable period, id., at 701. \nAfter that, the Court concluded, if the alien “provides good\nreason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of \nremoval in the reasonably foreseeable future,” the Gov-\nernment must either rebut that showing or release the\nalien.  Ibid.\n  The  Zadvydas  Court  justified  this  interpretation  by \ninvoking  the  constitutional-avoidance  canon,  and  the \nCourt defended its resort to that canon on the ground that\n§1231(a)(6) is ambiguous.  Specifically, the Court detected \nambiguity  in  the  statutory  phrase  “may  be  detained.” \n“‘[M]ay,’”  the  Court  said,  “suggests  discretion”  but  not\nnecessarily “unlimited discretion.  In that respect the word \n‘may’ is ambiguous.”  Id., at 697.  The Court also pointed \nto the absence of any explicit statutory limit on the length \nof permissible detention following the entry of an order of \nremoval.  Ibid. \nZadvydas represents a notably generous application of \nthe constitutional-avoidance canon, but the Court of Ap-\npeals in this case went much further.  It failed to address \nwhether Zadvydas’s reasoning may fairly be applied in\nthis case despite the many ways in which the provision in\nquestion in Zadvydas, §1231(a)(6), differs materially from\nthose at issue here, §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2).  Those dif-\nferences  preclude  the  reading  adopted  by  the  Court  of \nAppeals. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 21 of 92   Page ID\n #:9760\n16  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nTo  start,  §§1225(b)(1)  and  (b)(2),  unlike  §1231(a)(6),\nprovide for detention for a specified period of time.  Sec-\ntion 1225(b)(1) mandates detention “for further considera-\ntion of the application for asylum,” §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), and \n§1225(b)(2)  requires  detention  “for  a  [removal]  proceed-\ning,” §1225(b)(2)(A).  The plain meaning of those phrases \nis that detention must continue until immigration officers\nhave finished “consider[ing]” the application for asylum,\n§1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), or until removal proceedings have con-\ncluded,  §1225(b)(2)(A).  By  contrast,  Congress  left  the\npermissible length of detention under §1231(a)(6) unclear. \n  Moreover,  in  Zadvydas,  the  Court  saw  ambiguity  in\n§1231(a)(6)’s use of the word “may.”  Here, by contrast,\n§§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) do not use the word “may.”  In-\nstead,  they  unequivocally  mandate  that  aliens  falling \nwithin their scope “shall” be detained.  “Unlike the word \n‘may,’ which implies discretion, the word ‘shall’ usually \nconnotes a requirement.”  Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. \nv. United States, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).\nThat  requirement  of  detention  precludes  a  court  from \nfinding ambiguity here in the way that Zadvydas found \nambiguity in §1231(a)(6). \nZadvydas’s reasoning is particularly inapt here because \nthere  is  a  specific  provision  authorizing  release  from \n§1225(b) detention whereas no similar release provision \napplies to §1231(a)(6).  With a few exceptions not relevant \nhere, the Attorney General may “for urgent humanitarian\nreasons or significant public benefit” temporarily parole \naliens detained under §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2).  8 U. S. C. \n§1182(d)(5)(A).  That express exception to detention im-\nplies that there are no other circumstances under which \naliens detained under §1225(b) may be released.  See A. \nScalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 107 (2012) (“Negative-\nImplication Canon[:] The expression of one thing implies \nthe  exclusion  of  others  (expressio  unius  est  exclusio  al-\nterius)”).

S. ____ (2018)  17 \nOpinion of the Court \nimplicit  time  limit  on  detention  that  we  found  in \nZadvydas.4 \nIn short, a series of textual signals distinguishes the \nprovisions at issue in this case from Zadvydas’s interpre-\ntation of §1231(a)(6).  While Zadvydas found §1231(a)(6) to \nbe ambiguous, the same cannot be said of §§1225(b)(1) and \n(b)(2): Both provisions mandate detention until a certain\npoint and authorize release prior to that point only under\nlimited circumstances.  As a result, neither provision can\nreasonably be read to limit detention to six months. \n2 \nIn this Court, respondents advance an interpretation of\nthe  language  of  §§1225(b)(1)  and  (b)(2)  that  was  never \nmade below, namely, that the term “for,” which appears in\nboth provisions, mandates detention only until the start of \napplicable proceedings rather than all the way through to\ntheir conclusion.  Respondents contrast the language of\n§§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) authorizing detention “for” further \nproceedings  with  another  provision’s  authorization  of \ndetention “pending” further proceedings.  See 8 U. S. C. \n§1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV)  (“Any  alien  . . .  shall  be  detained \npending a final determination of credible fear of persecu-\ntion and, if found not to have such a fear, until removed”).\nAccording to respondents, that distinction between “for”\nand “pending” makes an enormous difference.  As they see\nthings, the word “pending” authorizes detention through-\nout subsequent proceedings, but the term “for” means that\ndetention  authority  ends  once  subsequent  proceedings \n—————— \n4According to the dissent, we could have applied the expressio unius \ncanon in Zadvydas as well because there was also an “alternative \navenue for relief, namely, bail,” available for aliens detained under \n§1231(a)(6).  Post, at 25 (opinion of BREYER, J.).  But the dissent over-\nlooks the fact that the provision granting bail was precisely the same\nprovision that the Court purported to be interpreting, so the canon was \nnot applicable. See 533 U. S., at 683. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 23 of 92   Page ID\n #:9762\n18  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nbegin.  As a result, respondents argue, once the applicable \nproceedings commence, §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) no longer \nauthorize  detention,  and  the  Government  must  instead \nlook to §1226(a) for continued detention authority.\nThat interpretation is inconsistent with ordinary Eng-\nlish usage and is incompatible with the rest of the statute. \nTo be sure, “for” can sometimes mean “in preparation for \nor anticipation of.”  6 Oxford English Dictionary 24 (2d ed. \n1989).  But “for” can also mean “[d]uring [or] throughout,” \nid., at 26, as well as “with the object or purpose of,” id., at \n23;  see  also  American  Heritage  Dictionary  709  (3d  ed.\n1992) (“Used to indicate the object, aim, or purpose of an \naction or activity”; “Used to indicate amount, extent, or \nduration”); Random House Dictionary of the English Lan-\nguage 747 (2d ed. 1987) (“with the object or purpose of ”;\n“during the continuance of ”); Webster’s Third New Inter-\nnational Dictionary 886 (1993) (“with the purpose or object \nof ”; “to the . . . duration of ”).  And here, only that second\nset of definitions makes sense in the context of the statu-\ntory scheme as a whole.\nFor  example,  respondents  argue  that,  once  detention\nauthority ends under §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2), aliens can be\ndetained only under §1226(a).  But that section authorizes \ndetention only “[o]n a warrant issued” by the Attorney\nGeneral leading to the alien’s arrest.  §1226(a).  If re-\nspondents’ interpretation of §1225(b) were correct, then\nthe Government could detain an alien without a warrant \nat the border, but once removal proceedings began, the \nAttorney General would have to issue an arrest warrant in\norder to continue detaining the alien.  To put it lightly, \nthat makes little sense. \nNor does respondents’ interpretation of the word “for”\nalign with the way Congress has historically used that \nword in §1225.  Consider that section’s text prior to the \nenactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immi-\ngrant  Responsibility  Act  of  1996,  110  Stat.  3009–546. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 24 of 92   Page ID\n #:9763\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  19 \nOpinion of the Court \nUnder the older version of §1225(b), “[e]very alien” within\nits scope “who may not appear . . . to be clearly and beyond \na doubt entitled to [entry] shall be detained for further\ninquiry to be conducted by a special inquiry officer.”  8 \nU. S. C. §1225(b) (1994 ed.).  It would make no sense to \nread “for further inquiry” as authorizing detention of the \nalien only until the start of the inquiry; Congress obviously \ndid not mean to allow aliens to feel free to leave once \nimmigration officers asked their first question.\nIn sum, §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) mandate detention of\naliens throughout the completion of applicable proceedings \nand not just until the moment those proceedings begin.  Of \ncourse,  other  provisions  of  the  immigration  statutes  do\nauthorize detention “pending” other proceedings or “until” \na certain point.  See post, at 22–23 (BREYER, J., dissenting) \n(quoting §1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV)).  But there is no “canon of \ninterpretation  that  forbids  interpreting  different  words \nused in different parts of the same statute to mean roughly \nthe same thing.”  Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., \n568 U. S. 519, 540 (2013).  We decline to invent and apply\nsuch a canon here. \nB \nWhile the language of §§1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) is quite\nclear, §1226(c) is even clearer.  As noted, §1226 applies to\naliens  already  present  in  the  United  States.    Section \n1226(a) creates a default rule for those aliens by permit-\nting—but  not  requiring—the  Attorney  General  to  issue \nwarrants for their arrest and detention pending removal\nproceedings.  Section 1226(a) also permits the Attorney \nGeneral to release those aliens on bond, “[e]xcept as pro-\nvided in subsection (c) of this section.”  Section 1226(c) in\nturn  states  that  the  Attorney  General  “shall  take  into \ncustody any alien” who falls into one of the enumerated\ncategories involving criminal offenses and terrorist activi-\nties.  8 U. S. C. §1226(c)(1).  Section 1226(c) then goes on \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 25 of 92   Page ID\n #:9764\n20  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nto specify that the Attorney General “may release” one of \nthose aliens “only if the Attorney General decides” both \nthat doing so is necessary for witness-protection purposes \nand that the alien will not pose a danger or flight risk.\n§1226(c)(2) (emphasis added). \nLike §1225(b), §1226(c) does not on its face limit the\nlength of the detention it authorizes.  In fact, by allowing\naliens to be released “only if ” the Attorney General de-\ncides that certain conditions are met, §1226(c) reinforces\nthe conclusion that aliens detained under its authority are\nnot entitled to be released under any circumstances other \nthan those expressly recognized by the statute.  And to-\ngether with §1226(a), §1226(c) makes clear that detention \nof aliens within its scope must continue “pending a deci-\nsion on whether the alien is to be removed from the United \nStates.”  §1226(a).\nIn a reprise of their interpretation of §1225(b), respond-\nents argue, and the Court of Appeals held, that §1226(c) \nshould be interpreted to include an implicit 6-month time\nlimit on the length of mandatory detention.  Once again,\nthat interpretation falls far short of a “plausible statutory\nconstruction.” \nIn defense of their statutory reading, respondents first \nargue that §1226(c)’s “silence” as to the length of detention \n“cannot be construed to authorize prolonged mandatory \ndetention, because Congress must use ‘clearer terms’ to \nauthorize ‘long-term detention.’”  Brief for Respondents 34\n(quoting Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 697).  But §1226(c) is not \n“silent” as to the length of detention.  It mandates deten-\ntion  “pending  a  decision  on  whether  the  alien  is  to  be\nremoved from the United States,” §1226(a), and it expressly \nprohibits release from that detention except for narrow,\nwitness-protection purposes.  Even if courts were permit-\nted to fashion 6-month time limits out of statutory silence,\nthey  certainly  may  not  transmute  existing  statutory\nlanguage  into  its  polar  opposite.    The  constitutional-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 26 of 92   Page ID\n #:9765\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  21 \nOpinion of the Court \navoidance  canon  does  not  countenance  such  textual \nalchemy.\nIndeed,  we  have  held  as  much  in  connection  with \n§1226(c) itself.  In Demore v. Kim, 538 U. S., at 529, we \ndistinguished  §1226(c)  from  the  statutory  provision  in \nZadvydas by pointing out that detention under §1226(c) \nhas “a definite termination point”: the conclusion of re-\nmoval proceedings.  As we made clear there, that “definite \ntermination  point”—and  not  some  arbitrary  time  limit \ndevised  by  courts—marks  the  end  of  the  Government’s\ndetention authority under §1226(c). \nRespondents  next  contend  that  §1226(c)’s  limited  au-\nthorization  for  release  for  witness-protection  purposes\ndoes not imply that other forms of release are forbidden,\nbut this argument defies the statutory text.  By expressly \nstating that the covered aliens may be released “only if ” \ncertain  conditions  are  met,  8  U. S. C.  §1226(c)(2),  the \nstatute expressly and unequivocally imposes an affirma-\ntive prohibition on releasing detained aliens under any \nother conditions. \nFinally, respondents point to a provision enacted as part\nof the PATRIOT Act5 and contend that their reading of\n§1226(c) is needed to prevent that provision from being \nsuperfluous.   That  argument,  however,  misreads  both\nstatutory provisions.  Although the two provisions overlap \nin part, they are by no means congruent.\nTwo  differences  stand  out.    First,  §1226(c)  and  the\nPATRIOT Act cover different categories of aliens.  Both \napply  to  certain  terrorist  suspects,  but  only  §1226(c) \nreaches aliens convicted of other more common criminal \noffenses.  See §§1226(c)(1)(A)–(C) (aliens inadmissible or \ndeportable  under  §1182(a)(2);  §§1227(a)(2)(A)(ii),  (A)(iii), \n—————— \n5See Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate\nTools  Required  to  Intercept  and  Obstruct  Terrorism  Act  of  2001 \n(PATRIOT Act), 115 Stat. 272. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 27 of 92   Page ID\n #:9766\n22  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \n(B), (C), and (D); and §1227(a)(2)(A)(i) under certain condi-\ntions).  For its part, the PATRIOT Act casts a wider net \nthan §1226(c) insofar as it encompasses certain threats \nto  national  security  not  covered  by  §1226(c).    See \n§1226a(a)(3)  (aliens  described  in  §§1182(a)(3)(A)(i),  (iii), \nand 1227(a)(4)(A)(i), (iii), as well as aliens “engaged in any \nother activity that endangers the national security of the \nUnited States”).  In addition, the Government’s detention \nauthority under §1226(c) and the PATRIOT Act is not the \nsame.  Under §1226(c), the Government must detain an\nalien until “a decision on whether the alien is to be re-\nmoved” is made.  §1226(a) (emphasis added).  But, subject \nto exceptions not relevant here, the PATRIOT Act author-\nizes the Government to detain an alien “until the alien is \nremoved.”  §1226a(a)(2) (emphasis added). \nFar  from  being  redundant,  then,  §1226(c)  and  the\nPATRIOT  Act  apply  to  different  categories  of  aliens  in \ndifferent ways.  There is thus no reason to depart from the\nplain meaning of §1226(c) in order to avoid making the \nprovision superfluous.\nWe hold that §1226(c) mandates detention of any alien\nfalling within its scope and that detention may end prior \nto the conclusion of removal proceedings “only if ” the alien \nis released for witness-protection purposes. \nC \nFinally,  as  noted,  §1226(a)  authorizes  the  Attorney\nGeneral to arrest and detain an alien “pending a decision\non whether the alien is to be removed from the United \nStates.”  §1226(a).  As long as the detained alien is not \ncovered by §1226(c), the Attorney General “may release” \nthe alien on “bond . . . or conditional parole.”  §1226(a). \nFederal  regulations  provide  that  aliens  detained  under \n§1226(a) receive bond hearings at the outset of detention.\nSee 8 CFR §§236.1(d)(1), 1236.1(d)(1). \nThe Court of Appeals ordered the Government to pro-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 28 of 92   Page ID\n #:9767\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  23 \nOpinion of the Court \nvide procedural protections that go well beyond the initial\nbond hearing established by existing regulations—namely, \nperiodic  bond  hearings  every  six  months  in  which  the \nAttorney  General  must  prove  by  clear  and  convincing\nevidence that the alien’s continued detention is necessary.\nNothing  in  §1226(a)’s  text—which  says  only  that  the\nAttorney General “may release” the alien “on . . . bond”—\neven remotely supports the imposition of either of those\nrequirements.  Nor does §1226(a)’s text even hint that the\nlength of detention prior to a bond hearing must specifically \nbe considered in determining whether the alien should be\nreleased. \nIV \nFor these reasons, the meaning of the relevant statutory \nprovisions is clear—and clearly contrary to the decision of \nthe Court of Appeals.  But the dissent is undeterred.  It \nbegins by ignoring the statutory language for as long as\npossible, devoting the first two-thirds of its opinion to a \ndisquisition  on  the  Constitution.    Only  after  a  19-page\nprologue does the dissent acknowledge the relevant statu-\ntory provisions. \nThe  dissent  frames  the  question  of  interpretation  as\nfollows: Can §§1225(b), 1226(c), and 1226(a) be read to \nrequire bond hearings every six months “without doing \nviolence to the statutory language,” post, at 20 (opinion of \nBREYER, J.)?  According to the dissent, the answer is “yes,”\nbut the dissent evidently has a strong stomach when it\ncomes to inflicting linguistic trauma.  Thus, when Con-\ngress  mandated  that  an  “alien  shall  be  detained,” \n§1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), what Congress really meant, the dissent\ninsists, is that the alien may be released from custody \nprovided only that his freedom of movement is restricted\nin some way, such as by “the imposition of a curfew,” post,\nat 21.  And when Congress stressed that “[t]he Attorney\nGeneral may release an alien . . . only if . . . release . . . \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 29 of 92   Page ID\n #:9768\n24  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nfrom custody is necessary” to protect the safety of a wit-\nness, §1226(c)(2) (emphasis added), what Congress meant, \nthe dissent tells us, is that the Attorney General must \nrelease an alien even when no witness is in need of protec-\ntion—so long as the alien is neither a flight risk nor a\ndanger to the community, see post, at 25–27.  The contor-\ntions needed to reach these remarkable conclusions are a \nsight to behold.\nLet us start with the simple term “detain.”  According to\nthe dissent, “detain” means the absence of “unrestrained \nfreedom.”  Post, at 21.  An alien who is subject to any one\nof  “numerous  restraints”—including  “a  requirement  to \nobtain medical treatment,” “to report at regular intervals,”\nor even simply to comply with “a curfew”—is “detained” in\nthe dissent’s eyes, even if that alien is otherwise free to\nroam the streets.  Ibid. \nThis interpretation defies ordinary English usage.  The \ndictionary cited by the dissent, the Oxford English Dic-\ntionary (OED), defines “detain” as follows: “[t]o keep in\nconfinement or under restraint; to keep prisoner.”  4 OED \n543  (2d  ed.  1989)  (emphasis  added);  see  also  OED  (3d \ned.  2012),  http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/51176  (same).\nOther general-purpose dictionaries provide similar defini-\ntions.  See, e.g., Webster’s Third New International Dic-\ntionary 616 (1961) (“to hold or keep in or as if in custody \n<~ed  by  the  police  for  questioning>”);  Webster’s  New \nInternational Dictionary 710 (2d ed. 1934) (“[t]o hold or \nkeep as in custody”); American Heritage Dictionary 508 \n(def. 2) (3d ed. 1992) (“To keep in custody or temporary \nconfinement”);  Webster’s  New  World  College  Dictionary\n375 (3d ed. 1997) (“to keep in custody; confine”).  And legal \ndictionaries define “detain” the same way.  See, e.g., Bal-\nlentine’s Law Dictionary 343 (3d ed. 1969) (“To hold; to\nkeep in custody; to keep”); Black’s Law Dictionary 459 (7th ed.\n1999) (“The act or fact of holding a person in custody;\nconfinement or compulsory delay”). \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 30 of 92   Page ID\n #:9769\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  25 \nOpinion of the Court \nHow does the dissent attempt to evade the clear mean-\ning of “detain”?  It resorts to the legal equivalent of a\nsleight-of-hand trick.  First, the dissent cites a passage in \nBlackstone stating that arrestees could always seek re-\nlease on bail.  Post, at 8–9.  Then, having established the \nobvious point that a person who is initially detained may \nlater be released from detention, the dissent reasons that \nthis means that a person may still be regarded as detained \neven after he is released from custody.  Post, at 21.  That, \nof course, is a nonsequitur.  Just because a person who is\ninitially detained may later be released, it does not follow \nthat the person is still “detained” after his period of deten-\ntion comes to an end. \nIf there were any doubt about the meaning of the term \n“detain” in the relevant statutory provisions, the context \nin which they appear would put that doubt to rest.  Title 8 \nof the United States Code, the title dealing with immigra-\ntion, is replete with references that distinguish between \n“detained”  aliens  and  aliens  who  are  free  to  walk  the \nstreets in the way the dissent imagines.  Section 1226(a),\nfor instance, distinguishes between the power to “continue\nto detain the arrested alien” and the power to “release the \nalien on . . . bond.”  But if the dissent were right, that\ndistinction would make no sense: An “alien released on \nbond” would also be a “detained alien.”  Here is another \nexample: In §1226(b), Congress gave the Attorney General\nthe power to “revoke” at any time “a bond or parole au-\nthorized under subsection (a) of this section, rearrest the \nalien under the original warrant, and detain the alien.”  It \nbeggars belief that Congress would have given the Attor-\nney General the power to detain a class of aliens who, \nunder  the  dissent’s  reading,  are  already  “detained”  be-\ncause they are free on bond.  But that is what the dissent \nwould have us believe.  Consider, finally, the example of \n§1226(c).  As noted, that provision obligates the Attorney \nGeneral  to  “take  into  custody”  certain  aliens  whenever \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 31 of 92   Page ID\n #:9770\n26  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nthey are “released, without regard to whether the alien is \nreleased on parole, supervised release, or probation.”  On \nthe  dissent’s  view,  however,  even  aliens  “released  on \nparole, supervised release, or probation” are “in custody”—\nand so there would be no need for the Attorney General to\ntake them into custody again.6 \nStruggling to prop up its implausible interpretation, the \ndissent looks to our prior decisions for aid, but that too \nfails.  The best case it can find is Tod v. Waldman, 266 \nU. S. 547 (1925), a grant of a petition for rehearing in \nwhich the Court clarified that “[n]othing in [its original] \norder . . . shall prejudice an application for release on bail \nof the respondents pending compliance with the mandate\nof this Court.”  Id., at 548.  According to the dissent, that\ntwo-page decision from almost a century ago supports its\nreading  because  the  underlying  immigration  statute  in \nthat  case—like  some  of  the  provisions  at  issue  here—\nmandated that the relevant class of aliens “‘shall be de-\ntained’”  pending  the  outcome  of  an  inspection  process. \n—————— \n6As the dissent notes, §1158(d)(2) regulates employment authoriza-\ntion for certain “applicant[s] for asylum.”  Were all asylum applicants\ndetained, the dissent says, that provision would make no sense, because \ndetained aliens do not need work authorizations.  Post, at 23–24.  But \n§1158(d)(2) applies not only to aliens seeking asylum status “in accord-\nance with . . . section 1225(b)” (and thus aliens who are detained), but\nalso to all aliens already “physically present in the United States.” \n§1158(a)(1).  Many of those aliens will be in the country lawfully, and\nthus they will not be detained and will be able to work pending the\noutcome of their asylum application.  For example, an alien may apply\nfor asylum after being admitted into the country on a short-term visa. \nWhile the application is pending, §1158 may offer a way for that alien\nto find employment.\nIn response, the dissent accuses us of “apply[ing] this provision to \nsome asylum applicants but not the ones before us.”  Post, at 23–24. \nThat  is  not  remotely  what  we  are  doing.    We  do  not  doubt  that \n§1158(d)(2) “applies” to all “applicant[s] for asylum” as it says, even if \nsome of those applicants are not as likely to receive an employment \nauthorization (for instance, because they are detained) as others. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 32 of 92   Page ID\n #:9771\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  27 \nOpinion of the Court \nSee post, at 21–22 (quoting Act of Feb. 5, 1917, §16, 39\nStat. 886).\nThat reads far too much into Waldman.  To start, the \nCourt did not state that the aliens at issue were entitled to \nbail or even that bail was available to them.  Instead, the \nCourt merely noted that its decision should not “prejudice”\nany application the aliens might choose to file.  That is \nnotable, for in their petition for rehearing the aliens had \nasked the Court to affirmatively “authorize [them] to give \nbail.”  Petition for Rehearing in Tod v. Waldman, O.T. \n1924, No. 95, p. 17 (emphasis added).  By refusing to do so, \nthe Court may have been signaling its skepticism about\ntheir request.  But it is impossible to tell.   That is precisely \nwhy we, unlike the dissent, choose not to go beyond what \nthe sentence actually says.  And Waldman says nothing \nabout how the word “detain” should be read in the context \nof §§1225(b), 1226(c), and 1226(a).7\n  Neither does Zadvydas.  It is true, as the dissent points \nout, that Zadvydas found “that the words ‘“may be de-\ntained”’ [are] consistent with requiring release from long-\nterm detention,” post, at 23 (quoting 533 U. S., at 682), but \nthat is not because there is any ambiguity in the term\n“detain.”  As we have explained, the key statutory provi-\nsion in Zadvydas said that the aliens in question “may,” \nnot “shall,” be detained, and that provision also failed to\nspecify how long detention was to last.  Here, the statutory \nprovisions  at  issue  state  either  that  the  covered  aliens\n“shall” be detained until specified events take place, see 8 \nU. S. C.  §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii)  (“further  consideration  of  the \n—————— \n7It should not be surprising by this point that even the aliens in \nWaldman understood “detention” in contradistinction to “bail.”  See \nPetition for Rehearing in Tod v.

S., at 697.  And the \nopinion in that case consistently used the words “detain” \nand “custody” to refer exclusively to physical confinement\nand restraint.  See id., at 690 (referring to “[f]reedom from\nimprisonment—from  government  custody,  detention,  or \nother forms of physical restraint” (emphasis added)); id., at \n683 (contrasting aliens “released on bond” with those “held \nin custody”).8 \nThe  dissent  offers  no  plausible  interpretation  of \n§§1225(b), 1226(c), and 1226(a).  But even if we were to \naccept  the  dissent’s  interpretation  and  hold  that  “de-\ntained” aliens in the “custody” of the Government include\naliens released on bond, that would still not justify the \ndissent’s proposed resolution of this case.  The Court of \nAppeals held that aliens detained under the provisions at\nissue must be given periodic bond hearings, and the dis-\nsent agrees.  See post, at 2 (“I would interpret the statute\nas requiring bail hearings, presumptively after six months\nof  confinement”).  But  the  dissent  draws  that  6-month \nlimitation out of thin air.  However broad its interpreta-\ntion of the words “detain” and “custody,” nothing in any of \nthe relevant provisions imposes a 6-month time limit on \ndetention without the possibility of bail.  So if the dissent’s \ninterpretation  is  right,  then  aliens  detained  under \n§§1225(b), 1226(c), and 1226(a) are entitled to bail hear-\nings  as  soon  as  their  detention  begins  rather  than  six \n—————— \n8The dissent argues that because “the question at issue [in Zadvydas]\nwas release from detention,” “the key word was consequently ‘may.’ ” \nPost, at 23. We agree but fail to see the point.  If, as the dissent admits, \nZadvydas  was  about  “release  from  detention”  and  not  about  what \nqualifies as “detention,” then it is unclear why the dissent thinks that\ndecision supports its unorthodox interpretation of the word “detention.” \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 34 of 92   Page ID\n #:9773\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  29 \nOpinion of the Court \nmonths  later.  “Detained”  does  not  mean  “released \non  bond,”  and  it  certainly  does  not  mean  “released  on \nbond  but  only  after  six  months  of  mandatory  physical\nconfinement.” \nThe dissent’s utterly implausible interpretation of the \nstatutory  language  cannot  support  the  decision  of  the \ncourt below. \nV \nBecause  the  Court  of  Appeals  erroneously  concluded\nthat periodic bond hearings are required under the immi-\ngration  provisions  at  issue  here,  it  had  no  occasion  to \nconsider  respondents’  constitutional  arguments  on  their\nmerits.  Consistent with our role as “a court of review, not \nof first view,” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 \n(2005), we do not reach those arguments.  Instead, we \nremand the case to the Court of Appeals to consider them \nin the first instance. \nBefore  the  Court  of  Appeals  addresses  those  claims, \nhowever,  it  should  reexamine  whether  respondents  can\ncontinue  litigating  their  claims  as  a  class.    When  the \nDistrict Court certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, it had their statutory \nchallenge primarily in mind.  Now that we have resolved \nthat challenge, however, new questions emerge.\nSpecifically,  the  Court  of  Appeals  should  first  decide\nwhether it continues to have jurisdiction despite 8 U. S. C.\n§1252(f)(1).  Under that provision, “no court (other than \nthe Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to\nenjoin  or  restrain  the  operation  of  [§§1221–1232]  other \nthan with respect to the application of such provisions to \nan individual alien against whom proceedings under such\npart have been initiated.”  Section 1252(f)(1) thus “prohib-\nits federal courts from granting classwide injunctive relief \nagainst the operation of §§1221–123[2].”  American-Arab \nAnti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S., at 481.  The Court \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 35 of 92   Page ID\n #:9774\n30  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of the Court \nof Appeals held that this provision did not affect its juris-\ndiction over respondents’ statutory claims because those \nclaims did not “seek to enjoin the operation of the immi-\ngration detention statutes, but to enjoin conduct . . . not \nauthorized by the statutes.”  591 F. 3d, at 1120.  This \nreasoning does not seem to apply to an order granting \nrelief on constitutional grounds, and therefore the Court of \nAppeals should consider on remand whether it may issue \nclasswide injunctive relief based on respondents’ constitu-\ntional claims.  If not, and if the Court of Appeals concludes \nthat it may issue only declaratory relief, then the Court of\nAppeals should decide whether that remedy can sustain\nthe class on its own.  See, e. g., Rule 23(b)(2) (requiring \n“that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\nrelief  [be]  appropriate  respecting  the  class  as  a  whole” \n(emphasis added)).\nThe Court of Appeals should also consider whether a \nRule 23(b)(2) class action continues to be the appropriate \nvehicle for respondents’ claims in light of Wal-Mart Stores, \nInc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. 338 (2011).  We held in Dukes that \n“Rule  23(b)(2)  applies  only  when  a  single  injunction  or \ndeclaratory judgment would provide relief to each member \nof the class.”  Id., at 360.  That holding may be relevant on \nremand  because  the  Court  of  Appeals  has  already\nacknowledged that some members of the certified class \nmay not be entitled to bond hearings as a constitutional \nmatter.  See, e. g., 804 F. 3d, at 1082; 715 F. 3d, at 1139– \n1141 (citing, e. g., Shaughnessy  v. United  States ex rel. \nMezei, 345 U. S. 206 (1953)).  Assuming that is correct, \nthen  it  may  no  longer  be  true  that  the  complained-of \n“‘conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared un-\nlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of\nthem.’”  Dukes, supra, at 360 (quoting Nagareda, Class \nCertification  in  the  Age  of  Aggregate  Proof,  84 \nN.

Arbaugh v. \nY & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006).  This Court has \ndescribed §1252(b)(9) as a “‘zipper’ clause.”  See Reno v. \nAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.

S. C.  §§1151–1382] \nshall be available only in judicial review of a final or-\nder under this section.  Except as otherwise provided \nin this section, no court shall have jurisdiction, by ha-\nbeas corpus under section 2241 of title 28 or any other\nhabeas corpus provision, by section 1361 or 1651 of\nsuch title, or by any other provision of law (statutory\nor  nonstatutory),  to  review  such  an  order  or  such \nquestions of law or fact.”  (Emphasis added.) \nThe text of this provision is clear.  Courts generally lack\njurisdiction over “all questions of law and fact,” both “con-\nstitutional” and “statutory,” that “aris[e] from” an “action \ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien.”  If an \nalien raises a claim arising from such an action or proceed-\ning, courts cannot review it unless they are reviewing “a\nfinal  order”  under  §1252(a)(1)  or  exercising  jurisdiction \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 40 of 92   Page ID\n #:9779\n4  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of THOMAS, J. \n“otherwise provided” in §1252.2  Neither “habeas corpus” \nnor  “any  other  provision  of  law”  can  be  used  to  avoid \n§1252(b)(9)’s jurisdictional bar.  In short, if a claim arises \nfrom an action taken to remove an alien, §1252(b)(9) per-\nmits judicial review in only two circumstances: in connec-\ntion with review of a final removal order and via a specific \ngrant of jurisdiction in §1252.\nRespondents  do  not  argue  that  any  specific  grant  of\njurisdiction applies here, and they do not seek review of a \nfinal removal order under §1252(a)(1).  Thus, a court may \nreview  respondents’  claims  only  if  they  can  show  that\n§1252(b)(9)’s jurisdictional bar does not apply in the first\nplace because their claims do not “aris[e] from any action \ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien.”\nRespondents  cannot  make  that  showing.    Section \n1252(b)(9)  is  a  “general  jurisdictional  limitation”  that\napplies  to “all  claims  arising  from  deportation  proceed-\nings” and the “many . . . decisions or actions that may be \npart of the deportation process.”  AADC, supra, at 482– \n483.  Detaining  an  alien  falls  within  this  definition—\nindeed, this Court has described detention during removal\nproceedings  as  an  “aspect  of  the  deportation  process.” \nDemore v. Kim, 538 U. S. 510, 523 (2003); see also Carlson \nv. Landon, 342 U. S. 524, 538 (1952) (“Detention is neces-\nsarily a part of [the] deportation procedure”).  As the Court \nexplains today, Congress either mandates or permits the\ndetention of aliens for the entire duration of their removal \nproceedings.  See  ante,  at  12–23.    This  detention,  the \n—————— \n2Section 1252 provides a few specific grants of jurisdiction beyond\n§1252(a)(1)'s general grant of jurisdiction over final removal orders and\nall other related questions of law and fact.  Section 1252(b)(7), for\nexample, allows an alien to challenge the validity of his removal order \nduring criminal proceedings if he is charged with willfully failing to \ndepart the United States.  And §1252(e)(2) allows an alien who is\ndenied admission to the United States and ordered removed to raise \ncertain claims in habeas corpus proceedings. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 41 of 92   Page ID\n #:9780\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  5 \nOpinion of THOMAS, J. \nCourt further explains, is meant to ensure that the Gov-\nernment  can  ultimately  remove  them.  See  ante,  at  1; \naccord, Demore, supra, at 528 (explaining that detention\nduring removal proceedings “necessarily serves the pur-\npose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing \nprior to or during their removal proceedings, thus increas-\ning the chance that, if ordered removed, the aliens will be \nsuccessfully removed”).  The phrase “any action taken . . . \nto remove an alien from the United States” must at least \ncover congressionally authorized portions of the deporta-\ntion process that necessarily serve the purpose of ensuring \nan alien’s removal.  Claims challenging detention during \nremoval  proceedings  thus  fall  within  the  heartland  of \n§1252(b)(9). \nB \nThe plurality, the dissent, and respondents each offer\nreasons why §1252(b)(9) does not apply to this case.  The \nplurality reasons that applying §1252(b)(9) to detention \nclaims requires an overly expansive reading of “arising \nfrom.”  See  ante,  at  9–10.  The  dissent  contends  that \n§1252(b)(9) applies only to challenges to the removal order \nitself.  Post,  at  31.    And  respondents  argue  that,  if \n§1252(b)(9)  applies  to  their  claims,  they  will  have  no\nmeaningful way to challenge their detention during their \nremoval proceedings.3  Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.  None of these \narguments persuades me. \n1 \nThe  plurality  asserts  that  §1252(b)(9)  covers  respond- \n—————— \n3Respondents also asserted at oral argument that the Government\n“has  said  repeatedly”  that  §1252(b)(9)  does  not  apply  to  detention \nclaims.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.  But our “independent obligation” to evalu-\nate jurisdiction, Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006),\nmeans that we cannot accept the Government’s concessions on this \npoint. See King Bridge Co. v. Otoe County, 120 U. S. 225, 226 (1887). \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 42 of 92   Page ID\n #:9781\n6  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \nents’ claims only if the words “arising from” are given an \n“expansive interpretation.”  Ante, at 9.  I am of a different \nview.  Even if “arising from” is read narrowly, §1252(b)(9)\nstill covers the claims at issue in this case.  That is be-\ncause  detention  is  an  “action  taken  . . .  to  remove”  an \nalien.  And even the narrowest reading of “arising from”\nmust  cover  claims  that  directly  challenge  such  actions. \nSee AADC, 525 U. S., at 482–483. \nThe main precedent that the plurality cites to support \nits  narrow  reading  of  “arising  from”  demonstrates  that\n§1252(b)(9) applies here.  See ante, at 10 (citing AADC, \n525 U. S., at 482–483).  In AADC, the Court explained\nthat §1252(b)(9) covers “all claims arising from deporta-\ntion proceedings” and the “many . . . decisions or actions \nthat may be part of the deportation process.”  Ibid.  The \nCourt  even  listed  examples  of  the  type  of  claims  that \nwould be covered, including challenges to the decision “to\nopen  an  investigation”  and  the  decision  “to  surveil  the \nsuspected  [immigration-law]  violator.”  Id.,  at  482.  If \nsurveilling a  suspected  violator  falls  under the  statute, \nthen the detention of a known violator certainly does as\nwell. \nThe plurality dismisses my “expansive interpretation” \nbecause it would lead to “staggering results,” supposedly \nbarring claims that are far afield from removal.  See ante, \nat 9 (describing lawsuits challenging inhumane conditions \nof confinement, assaults, and negligent driving).  But that \nis not the case.  Unlike detention during removal proceed-\nings, those actions are neither congressionally authorized \nnor meant to ensure that an alien can be removed.  Thus, \nmy conclusion that §1252(b)(9) covers an alien’s challenge\nto the fact of his detention (an action taken in pursuit of \nthe lawful objective of removal) says nothing about whether \nit  also  covers  claims  about  inhumane  treatment,  as-\nsaults,  or  negligently  inflicted  injuries  suffered  during \ndetention (actions that go beyond the Government’s lawful \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 43 of 92   Page ID\n #:9782\nCite as: 583 U.

S. 520, 536–539 (1979) (drawing a similar distinction). \n2 \nThe dissent takes a different approach.  Relying on the\nprefatory clause to §1252(b), it asserts that §1252(b)(9) “by \nits terms applies only ‘[w]ith respect to review of an order\nof removal under [§1252(a)(1)].’”  Post, at 31 (quoting 8 \nU. S. C. §1252(b)).  The dissent reads the prefatory clause \nto  mean  that  §1252(b)(9)  applies  only  to  a  “challenge \n[to] an order of removal.”  Post, at 31.  That reading is \nincorrect. \nSection  1252(b)(9)  is  not  restricted  to  challenges  to \nremoval orders.  The text refers to review of “all questions\nof law and fact” arising from removal, not just removal \norders.  (Emphasis  added.)  And  it  specifies  that \n§1252(a)(1) provides the only means for reviewing “such\nan order or such questions of law or fact.”  Ibid. (emphasis\nadded).  The term “or” is “‘almost always disjunctive, that\nis, the words it connects are to be given separate mean-\nings.’”  Loughrin v. United States, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) \n(slip op., at 6) (quoting United States v. Woods, 571 U. S. \n31, 45–46 (2013)).  By interpreting §1252(b)(9) as govern-\ning only removal orders, the dissent reads “or such ques-\ntions of law or fact” out of the statute.  It also renders \nsuperfluous §1252(a)(5), which already specifies that the\nreview made available under §1252(a)(1) “shall be the sole \nand  exclusive  means  for  judicial  review  of  an  order  of \nremoval.”  This Court typically disfavors such interpreta-\ntions.  See AADC, supra, at 483. \nThe prefatory clause of §1252(b) does not change the\nmeaning of §1252(b)(9).  The prefatory clause states that \nthe  subparagraphs  of  §1252(b),  including  §1252(b)(9),\nimpose requirements “[w]ith respect to review of an order\nof  removal  under  subsection  (a)(1).”  The  phrase  “with\nrespect to” means “referring to,” “concerning,” or “relating \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 44 of 92   Page ID\n #:9783\n8  JENNINGS v.

Read together, the prefatory clause\nand §1252(b)(9) mean that review of all questions arising \nfrom removal must occur in connection with review of a \nfinal removal order under §1252(a)(1), which makes sense \ngiven  that  §1252(b)(9)  is  meant  to  “[c]onsolidat[e]  . . . \nquestions for judicial review.”  Tellingly, on the two previ-\nous occasions when this Court interpreted §1252(b)(9), it \ndid not understand §1252(b)(9) as limited to challenges to\nremoval orders.  See AADC, supra, at 482–483 (stating \nthat  §1252(b)(9)  is  a  “general  jurisdictional  limitation”\nthat applies to “all claims arising from deportation pro-\nceedings” and “the many . . . decisions or actions that may\nbe part of the deportation process”); St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at \n313, n. 37 (clarifying that §1252(b)(9) requires “claims that\nwere viewed as being outside of a ‘final order’” to be “con-\nsolidated in a petition for review and considered by the\ncourts  of  appeals”  in  their  review  of  the  final  removal\norder under §1252(a)(1)).  Thus,  despite  the  dissent’s \nassertion to the contrary, the prefatory clause plainly does\nnot  change  the  scope  of  §1252(b)(9),  which  covers  “all \nquestions of law or fact” arising from the removal process. \n3 \nAt  oral  argument,  respondents  asserted  that,  if \n§1252(b)(9) bars their lawsuit, then the only review avail-\nable would be “a petition for review of [a] final removal \norder” under §1252(a)(1), which takes place “after all the \ndetention has already happened.”4  Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.

This argument is \nunpersuasive and foreclosed by precedent.\nThe Constitution does not guarantee litigants the most \neffective means of judicial review for every type of claim \nthey  want  to  raise.    See AADC,  525  U. S.,  at  487–492 \n(rejecting  a  similar  argument);  Heikkila  v.  Barber,  345 \nU. S. 229, 237 (1953) (explaining that limitations on judi-\ncial review of deportation must be followed “despite [their]\napparent inconvenience to the alien”).  This is especially\ntrue in the context of deportation, where limits on the\ncourts’  jurisdiction  have  existed  for  almost  as  long  as\nfederal immigration laws, and where this Court has re-\npeatedly affirmed the constitutionality of those limits.5 \nIndeed, this Court has already rejected essentially the\nsame argument that respondents raise here.  In AADC, \nthe  Court  held  that  §1252(g),  a  provision  similar  to \n§1252(b)(9), barred the aliens’ claim that the Government \nwas violating the First Amendment by selectively enforc-\n—————— \nto obtain review of their detention before it is complete.

RODRIGUEZ \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \ning the immigration laws against them.  525 U. S., at 487– \n492.  The  aliens  argued  that  constitutional  avoidance \nrequired the Court to interpret §1252(g) as not applying to \ntheir claims because the only remaining avenue for re-\nview—a petition for review of a final removal order under \n§1252(a)(1)—would be “unavailing” and would “come too \nlate  to  prevent  the  ‘chilling  effect’  upon  their  First\nAmendment rights.”  Id., at 487–488.  The Court rejected \nthis argument because “an alien unlawfully in this coun-\ntry has no constitutional right to assert selective enforce-\nment as a defense against his deportation.”  Id., at 488. \nThe Court further explained that it had a duty to enforce \nCongress’ limitations on judicial review, except perhaps in \n“a rare case in which the alleged basis of discrimination is\nso outrageous that the foregoing considerations [justifying \nlimited review could] be overcome.”  Id., at 491. \n  Like in AADC, respondents’ lack-of-meaningful-review \nargument does not allow us to ignore the jurisdictional\nlimitations that Congress has imposed.  This Court has \nnever held that detention during removal proceedings is\nunconstitutional.  To the contrary, this Court has repeat-\nedly recognized the constitutionality of that practice.  See \nDemore, 538 U. S., at 523 (explaining that detention is “a\nconstitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process”); \naccord,  Reno  v.  Flores,  507  U.

I, §9, cl. 2 (“The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas\nCorpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of \nRebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it”).  It \ndoes  not.  Even  assuming  the  Suspension  Clause  bars \nCongress from stripping habeas jurisdiction over respond-\nents’ claims, but see St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 337–346 (Sca- \nlia, J., dissenting), this case does not involve a habeas \npetition.\nRespondents do not seek habeas relief, as understood by \nour precedents.  Although their complaint references the \ngeneral habeas statute, see Third Amended Complaint, at\n1, it is not a habeas petition.  The complaint does not\nrequest that the District Court issue any writ.  See id., at \n31–32.  Rather, it seeks a declaration and an injunction\nthat would provide relief for both present and future class\nmembers,  including  future  class  members  not  yet  de-\ntained.  Ibid.  Indeed, respondents obtained class certifica-\ntion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), which \napplies only when the class seeks “final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief.”7 \n—————— \n6I take no position on whether some of the respondents will face other\njurisdictional hurdles, even on review of their final removal orders. \nSee, e.g., §§1252(a)(2)(A), (B).  I also continue to agree with Justice \nO’Connor’s concurring opinion in Demore v. Kim, 538 U. S. 510 (2003), \nwhich explained that §1226(e) “unequivocally deprives federal courts of \njurisdiction to set aside ‘any action or decision’ by the Attorney Gen-\neral” regarding detention.  Id., at 533 (opinion concurring in part and \nconcurring in judgment). \n7This Court has never addressed whether habeas relief can be pur-\nsued in a class action.  See Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 261, n. 10 \n(1984) (reserving this question).  I take no position on that issue here, \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 48 of 92   Page ID\n #:9787\n12  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nOpinion of THOMAS, J. \nNor did respondents obtain habeas relief.  When their \ncase concluded, respondents obtained a classwide perma-\nnent injunction.  See Order, Judgment, and Permanent \nInjunction, at 5–6.  That classwide injunction looks noth-\ning like a typical writ.  It is not styled in the form of a \nconditional  or  unconditional  release  order.  Cf.  United \nStates v. Jung Ah Lung, 124 U. S. 621, 622 (1888) (de-\nscribing habeas relief as “order[ing] the discharge from\ncustody of the person in whose behalf the writ was sued\nout”); Chin Yow v. United States, 208 U. S. 8, 13 (1908)\n(awarding  habeas  relief  by  ordering  the  release  of  the \nalien if certain conditions were not satisfied).  It applies to\nfuture class members, including individuals who were not\nin custody when the injunction was issued.  Cf. 28 U. S. C. \n§2241(c) (generally precluding issuance of the writ unless\nthe petitioner is “in custody”).  And it is directed to at least \none individual, the Director for the Executive Office for \nImmigration Review, who is not a custodian.  Cf. Rumsfeld \nv. Padilla, 542 U. S. 426, 434 (2004) (explaining that “the \nproper respondent to a habeas petition is ‘the person who \nhas  custody  over  [the  petitioner]’”  (quoting  28  U. S. C. \n§2242)).\nImmigration law has long drawn a distinction between \nthe  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  that  respondents\nsought here and habeas relief.  In Heikkila, for instance, \nthis Court distinguished habeas relief from “injunctions,\ndeclaratory  judgments  and  other  types  of  relief ”  that \n“courts ha[d] consistently rejected” in immigration cases.\n345 U. S., at 230.  The Court rejected the alien’s request \nfor “injunctive and declaratory relief ” because Congress\nhad authorized courts to grant relief only in habeas pro-\nceedings.

S. 48, 49, 52–53 (1955) (holding \nthat the Administrative Procedure Act, which authorizes \ncourts to grant declaratory and injunctive relief, author-\nized “judicial review of deportation orders other than by \nhabeas  corpus”  (emphasis  added)).  And  Congress  has \nconfirmed this distinction in its immigration statutes by \nallowing one form of relief, but not the other, in particular\ncircumstances.    Compare,  e.g.,  §1252(e)(1)  (prohibiting \ncourts  from  granting  “declaratory,  injunctive,  or  other \nequitable relief in any action pertaining to an order to \nexclude an alien in accordance with section 1225(b)(1)”) \nwith §1252(e)(2) (allowing “judicial review . . . in habeas\ncorpus proceedings” of particular “determination[s] made \nunder section 1225(b)(1)”).\nRespondents’ suit for declaratory and injunctive relief,\nin sum, is not a habeas petition.  The Suspension Clause \nprotects “[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus,” not \nrequests for injunctive relief.  Because respondents have\nnot sought a writ of habeas corpus, applying §1252(b)(9) to \nbar their suit does not implicate the Suspension Clause. \n*  *  * \nBecause §1252(b)(9) deprives courts of jurisdiction over \nrespondents’ claims, we should have vacated the judgment\nbelow and remanded with instructions to dismiss this case \nfor lack of jurisdiction.

C. \n§1101 et seq., forbid granting them bail. \nThe noncitizens at issue are asylum seekers, persons \nwho have finished serving a sentence of confinement (for a \ncrime), or individuals who, while lacking a clear entitle-\nment to enter the United States, claim to meet the criteria \nfor admission, see infra, at 20, 25–26, 29–30.  The Gov-\nernment has held all the members of the groups before us\nin  confinement  for  many  months,  sometimes  for  years, \nwhile it looks into or contests their claims.  But ultimately \nmany members of these groups win their claims and the\nGovernment  allows  them  to  enter  or  to  remain  in  the \nUnited States.  Does the statute require members of these \ngroups to receive a bail hearing, after, say, six months of\nconfinement, with the possibility of release on bail into the \ncommunity provided that they do not pose a risk of flight\nor a threat to the community’s safety? \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 51 of 92   Page ID\n #:9790\n2  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nThe Court reads the statute as forbidding bail, hence \nforbidding a bail hearing, for these individuals.  In my\nview, the majority’s interpretation of the statute would\nlikely render the statute unconstitutional.  Thus, I would \nfollow this Court’s longstanding practice of construing a \nstatute “so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is\nunconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score.” \nUnited States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394, 401 (1916). \nAnd I would interpret the statute as requiring bail hear-\nings, presumptively after six months of confinement.  Cf. \nZadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 701 (2001). \nI \nThe Respondents \nBecause of their importance to my conclusion, I shall\nrepeat, with references to record support, the key charac-\nteristics of the groups of noncitizens who appear before us. \nFirst, as I have said, the respondents in this case are\nmembers of three special classes of noncitizens, the most \nimportant of whom (1) arrive at our borders seeking asy-\nlum or (2) have committed crimes but have finished serv-\ning their sentences of imprisonment.  We also consider \nthose  who  (3)  arrive  at  our  borders  believing  they  are \nentitled to enter the United States for reasons other than \nasylum seeking, but lack a clear entitlement to enter. \nSecond,  all  members  of  the  first  group,  the  asylum \nseekers,  have  been  found  (by  an  immigration  official) \nto have a “credible fear of persecution” in their home coun-\ntry should the United States deny them admittance.  8 \nU. S. C.  §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  All  members  of  the  second \ngroup have, as I have said, finished serving their criminal \nsentences of confinement.  §1226(c)(1).  All members of the \nthird group may have (or may simply believe they have) a \nstrong claim for admittance, but they are neither “clearly \nand beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted” nor conclu-\nsively determined to be inadmissible by an immigration \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 52 of 92   Page ID\n #:9791\nCite as: 583 U.

See Brief for 46 Social Science Researchers \nand Professors as Amici Curiae 6, 8 (identifying, in 2015,\n7,500 asylum seekers and 12,220 noncitizens who have\nfinished  serving  sentences  of  criminal  confinement,  a\nportion of whom are class members detained for more than \nsix months). \nFourth, detention is often lengthy.  The classes before us \nconsist of people who were detained for at least six months\nand on average one year.  App. 92, 97.  The record shows \nthat the Government detained some asylum seekers for \n831 days (nearly 2½ years), 512 days, 456 days, 421 days,\n354 days, 319 days, 318 days, and 274 days—before they \nwon their cases and received asylum.  Id., at 97, 228–236. \nIt also shows that the Government detained one nonciti-\nzen for nearly four years after he had finished serving a\ncriminal  sentence,  and  the  Government  detained  other \nmembers of this class for 608 days, 561 days, 446 days,\n438 days, 387 days, and 305 days—all before they won\ntheir cases and received relief from removal.  Id., at 92, \n213–220. \nFifth,  many  of  those  whom  the  Government  detains \neventually obtain the relief they seek.  Two-thirds of the \nasylum  seekers  eventually  receive  asylum.  Id.,  at  98 \n(Table 28); id., at 135 (Table 38); App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a. \nNearly 40% of those who have served criminal sentences \nreceive relief from removal, because, for example, their\nearlier conviction involved only a short sentence.  See App.\n95 (Table 23); id., at 135 (Table 38).  See also App. to Pet. \nfor Cert. 34a; App. 210, 216–217, 312–313 (between one-\nhalf and two-thirds of the class served sentences less than \nsix months, e.g., a 2-month sentence for being under the\ninfluence of a controlled substance, or an 8-day jail term \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 53 of 92   Page ID\n #:9792\n4  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nfor a minor firearms offense). \nSixth, these very asylum seekers would have received\nbail hearings had they first been taken into custody within\nthe United States rather than at the border.  See In re \nX-K-, 23 I. & N. Dec. 731, 734–735 (BIA 2005); 8 U. S. C.\n§1226(a). \nSeventh, as for those who have finished serving their \nsentences (for crimes), some of those who are less danger-\nous would (on the majority’s view) be held without bail the\nlongest, because their claims will take longer to adjudi-\ncate.  Moreover, those noncitizens would have no oppor-\ntunity to obtain bail while they pursue their claims, but if \nthey lose their claims, the Government must release them, \ntypically within six months, if the Government can find no\nother country willing to take them.  See Zadvydas, supra, \nat 701. \nEighth, all the respondents are held in detention within\nthe geographical boundaries of the United States, either in \nfacilities  controlled  by  United  States  Immigration  and\nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) or in state or local jails that \nhold them on ICE’s behalf.  App. 302–304; see ICE, Deten-\ntion  Facility  Locator,  online  at  http://www.ice.gov/\ndetention-facilities (all Internet materials as last visited \nFeb. 21, 2018). \nNinth, the circumstances of their detention are similar, \nso far as we can tell, to those in many prisons and jails.\nAnd in some cases the conditions of their confinement are \ninappropriately  poor.    See  Dept.  of  Homeland  Security \n(DHS), Office of Inspector General (OIG), DHS OIG In-\nspection  Cites  Concerns  With  Detainee  Treatment  and\nCare  at  ICE  Detention  Facilities  (2017)  (reporting  in-\nstances  of  invasive  procedures,  substandard  care,  and \nmistreatment,  e.g.,  indiscriminate  strip  searches,  long\nwaits for medical care and hygiene products, and, in the \ncase of one detainee, a multiday lock down for sharing a \ncup of coffee with another detainee). \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 54 of 92   Page ID\n #:9793\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  5 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nThese record-based facts make evident what I said at \nthe outset: The case concerns persons whom immigration \nauthorities believe are not citizens and may not have a \nright to enter into, or remain within, the United States. \nNonetheless they likely have a reasonable claim that they \ndo  have  such  a  right.    The  Government  detains  them, \noften for many months while it determines the merits of,\nor contests, their claims.  To repeat the question before us:\nDoes the statute entitle an individual member of one of \nthese classes to obtain, say, after six months of detention, \na bail hearing to decide whether he or she poses a risk of \nflight or danger to the community and, if not, to receive\nbail? \nII \nThe Constitutional Question \nThe majority reads the relevant statute as prohibiting \nbail and hence prohibiting a bail hearing.  In my view, the \nrelevant constitutional language, purposes, history, tradi-\ntion, and case law all make clear that the majority’s inter-\npretation  at  the  very  least  would  raise  “grave  doubts” \nabout the statute’s constitutionality.  See Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 U. S., at 401. \nA \nConsider the relevant constitutional language and the\nvalues that language protects.  The Fifth Amendment says\nthat “[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or \nproperty without due process of law.”  An alien is a “per-\nson.”  See Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 237– \n238 (1896).  To hold him without bail is to deprive him of\nbodily “liberty.”  See United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. \n739, 748–751 (1987).  And, where there is no bail proceed-\ning, there has been no bail-related “process” at all.  The \nDue Process Clause—itself reflecting the language of the\nMagna  Carta—prevents  arbitrary  detention.    Indeed, \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 55 of 92   Page ID\n #:9794\n6  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \n“[f]reedom from bodily restraint has always been at the\ncore of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause\nfrom arbitrary governmental action.”  Foucha v. Louisi-\nana, 504 U. S. 71, 80 (1992); see also Demore v. Kim, 538 \nU. S.  510,  532  (2003)  (KENNEDY,  J.,  concurring); \nZadvydas, 533 U. S., at 718 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\nThe Due Process Clause foresees eligibility for bail as \npart of “due process.”  See Salerno, supra, at 748–751; \nSchilb v. Kuebel, 404 U. S. 357, 365 (1971); Stack v. Boyle, \n342 U. S. 1, 4 (1951).  Bail is “basic to our system of law.” \nSchilb, supra, at 365.  It not only “permits the unham-\npered preparation of a defense,” but also “prevent[s] the\ninfliction of punishment prior to conviction.”  Stack, supra, \nat 4.  It consequently limits the Government’s ability to \ndeprive a person of his physical liberty where doing so is\nnot needed to protect the public, see Salerno, supra, at \n750–751, or to assure his appearance at, say, a trial or the \nequivalent,  see  Stack,  supra,  at  4–5.  Why  would  this\nconstitutional language and its bail-related purposes not \napply to members of the classes of detained persons at \nissue here? \nThe  Eighth  Amendment  reinforces  the  view  that  the\nFifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause does apply.  The \nEighth Amendment forbids “[e]xcessive bail.”  It does so in \norder to prevent bail being set so high that the level itself\n(rather than the reasons that might properly forbid re-\nlease on bail) prevents provisional release.  See Carlson v. \nLandon, 342 U. S. 524, 545 (1952) (explaining that the\nEnglish clause from which the Eighth Amendment was\ncopied was understood “to provide that bail shall not be \nexcessive in those cases where it is proper to grant bail”). \nThat rationale applies a fortiori to a refusal to hold any \nbail hearing at all.  Thus, it is not surprising that this\nCourt  has  held  that  both  the  Fifth  Amendment’s  Due \nProcess  Clause  and  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  Excessive\nBail Clause apply in cases challenging bail procedures. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 56 of 92   Page ID\n #:9795\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  7 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nSee, e.g., Salerno, supra, at 746–755; Carlson, supra, at \n537–546. \nIt is clear that the Fifth Amendment’s protections ex-\ntend  to  “all  persons  within  the  territory  of  the  United \nStates.” Wong Wing, supra, at 238.  But the Government \nsuggests that those protections do not apply to asylum\nseekers or other arriving aliens because the law treats \narriving aliens as if they had never entered the United \nStates; hence they are not held within its territory.\nThis last-mentioned statement is, of course, false.  All of \nthese  noncitizens  are  held  within  the  territory  of  the\nUnited States at an immigration detention facility.  Those \nwho enter at JFK airport are held in immigration deten-\ntion facilities in, e.g., New York; those who arrive in El \nPaso are held in, e.g., Texas.  At most one might say that \nthey are “constructively” held outside the United States: \nthe  word  “constructive”  signaling  that  we  indulge  in  a\n“legal fiction,” shutting our eyes to the truth.  But once we \nadmit to uttering a legal fiction, we highlight, we do not\nanswer, the relevant question: Why should we engage in \nthis legal fiction here?\nThe legal answer to this question is clear.  We cannot \nhere engage in this legal fiction.  No one can claim, nor \nsince  the  time  of  slavery  has  anyone  to  my  knowledge \nsuccessfully claimed, that persons held within the United\nStates  are  totally  without  constitutional  protection.\nWhatever  the  fiction,  would  the  Constitution  leave  the \nGovernment free to starve, beat, or lash those held within \nour boundaries?  If not, then, whatever the fiction, how \ncan the Constitution authorize the Government to imprison\narbitrarily  those  who,  whatever  we  might  pretend,  are\nin reality right here in the United States?  The answer is \nthat the Constitution does not authorize arbitrary deten-\ntion.  And the reason that is so is simple: Freedom from \narbitrary detention is as ancient and important a right as \nany  found  within  the  Constitution’s  boundaries.    See \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 57 of 92   Page ID\n #:9796\n8  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nZadvydas,  supra,  at  720–721  (KENNEDY,  J.,  dissenting)\n(“inadmissible aliens” who are “stopped at the border” are \n“entitled  to  be  free  from  detention  that  is  arbitrary  or \ncapricious”). \nB \nThe Due Process Clause, among other things, protects \n“those settled usages and modes of proceeding existing in\nthe common and statute law of England, before the emi-\ngration of our ancestors,” and which were brought by them\nto this country.  Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Im-\nprovement Co., 18 How. 272, 277 (1856).  A brief look at \nBlackstone makes clear that at the time of the American \nRevolution the right to bail was “settled”—in both civil \nand criminal cases. \nBlackstone  tells  us  that  every  prisoner  (except  for  a \nconvict serving his sentence) was entitled to seek release \non bail.  4 Commentaries on the Laws of England 296–297 \n(1769).  This right applied in every criminal case.  Ibid.  A \nnoncapital defendant could seek bail from a local magis-\ntrate;  a  capital  defendant  could  seek  bail  at  a  hearing \nbefore the Court of King’s Bench.  See ibid.  Although a\ncapital defendant had no right to obtain bail, he could \nalways seek it, because “the court of king’s bench . . . may \nbail for any crime whatsoever, be it treason, murder, or \nany other offense, according to the circumstances of the \ncase.”  Id., at 296.  And although King Charles I initially \nclaimed the right to hold a prisoner without bail on secret\nnational security grounds, see Darnel’s Case, 3 How. St. \nTr. 1 (K. B. 1627), Parliament responded by extracting \nfrom the King (via the 1628 Petition of Right) a promise to \ncease such detention.  See 2 W. Hawkins, A Treatise of the \nPleas of the Crown 107–110 (4th ed. 1771).  From then on, \nbail was available even when a prisoner was held on the \npersonal command of the King.  Ibid.  That is why Black-\nstone says that the King’s Bench or its judges “may bail in \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 58 of 92   Page ID\n #:9797\nCite as: 583 U.

See  3  Blackstone,  Commentaries  290 \n(1768).  And bail was likewise an alternative to detention \nwhere a judgment debtor was unable to pay a civil judg-\nment  in  the  era  of  debtor’s  prison.    See,  e.g.,  Beers  v. \nHaughton, 9 Pet. 329, 356 (1835) (explaining that under \nOhio law, “if a defendant, upon a [writ of] capias, does not \ngive sufficient appearance bail, he shall be committed to\nprison”); Hamilton v. Dunklee, 1 N. H. 172 (1818). \nAmerican history makes clear that the settlers brought \nthis practice with them to America.  The Judiciary Act of \n1789  conferred  rights  to  bail  proceedings  in  all  federal \ncriminal cases.  §33, 1 Stat. 91.  It said that for a noncapi-\ntal defendant “bail shall be admitted” and for a capital \ndefendant  bail  may  be  admitted  in  the  discretion  of  a\ndistrict judge, a circuit judge, or a Justice of the Supreme\nCourt, taking account of “the offence, and of the evidence, \nand the usages of law.”  Ibid.  Congress enacted this law \nduring its debate over the Bill of Rights, which it subse-\nquently sent to the States for ratification.  See 1 Annals of \nCong.  90  (1789);  see  also  Martin  v.  Hunter’s  Lessee,  1 \nWheat. 304, 351 (1816) (Members of the First Congress\nwere “men of great learning and ability, . . . who had acted \na principal part in framing, supporting, or opposing” the\nConstitution itself).  Colonial law had been similarly, or in \nsome  instances  even  more,  protective.    See  Foote,  The \nComing Constitutional Crisis in Bail: I, 113 U. Pa. L. Rev. \n959, 974–977 (1965). \nSimilar  laws  have  consistently  remained  part  of  our \nlegal tradition.  In all federal criminal cases federal Acts \nhave provided for bail proceedings.  Bail Reform Act of \n1984, 18 U. S. C. §3141 et seq.; Bail Reform Act of 1966, 18 \nU. S. C. §3146 et seq. (1964 ed., Supp. II).  Every State has \nsimilar or more generous laws.  See Appendix B, infra. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 59 of 92   Page ID\n #:9798\n10  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nStandards  for  granting  bail  have  changed  somewhat \nover time.  Initially the sole factor determining the out-\ncome of a bail proceeding was risk of flight.  See Stack, 342 \nU. S., at 4–5 (interpreting the 1789 bail law, applied to a\nnoncapital defendant and in light of the Eighth Amend-\nment, to require bail no higher than required to provide \n“adequate assurance” that the defendant “will stand trial \nand  submit  to  sentence  if  found  guilty,”  “based  upon\nstandards relevant to the purpose of assuring the presence\nof that defendant”).\nCongress gradually added community safety as a bail\nfactor.  In 1966, Congress provided that for capital de-\nfendants and convicted defendants pursuing appeals, bail\nwould be granted unless the appeal was frivolous or a\ncourt had “reason to believe that no one or more conditions \nof release will reasonably assure that the person will not \nflee or pose a danger to any other person or to the commu-\nnity.”  Bail Reform Act of 1966 §3148.  In 1984, Congress\nmodified the bail standard for noncapital defendants by \nadding concern for community safety.  §3142(e)(1).  This \nCourt, applying the Due Process Clause and the Excessive \nBail  Clause  to  these changes,  found  that  the  1984  Act \npassed constitutional muster.  See Salerno, 481 U. S., at \n746–755.  Again, the States typically apply roughly simi-\nlar or more generous standards.  See Appendix B, infra. \nThe cases before us, however, are not criminal cases. \nDoes that fact make a difference?  The problem is that \nthere are not many instances of civil confinement (aside\nfrom  immigration  detention,  which  I  address  below).\nMental illness does sometimes provide an example.  Indi-\nviduals  dangerous  to  themselves  or  to  others  may  be \nconfined  involuntarily  to  a  mental  hospital.  See,  e.g., \nUnited States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. 126 (2010); Kansas v. \nHendricks, 521 U. S. 346 (1997).  Those persons normally\ndo not have what we would call “a right to a bail hearing.” \nBut they do possess equivalent rights: They have the right \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 60 of 92   Page ID\n #:9799\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  11 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nto a hearing prior to confinement and the right to review\nof  the  circumstances  at  least  annually.  See  Comstock, \nsupra, at 130–131 (initial hearing followed by review every \nsix  months);  Hendricks,  supra,  at  353  (initial  hearing\nfollowed by yearly review).  And the mentally ill persons \ndetained under these schemes are being detained because \nthey are dangerous.  That being so, there would be no\npoint in providing a bail hearing as well.  See Salerno, \nsupra, at 748–749 (analogizing denial of bail to dangerous \nindividuals to the civil commitment of the mentally ill).\nBut there is every reason for providing a bail proceeding to \nthe noncitizens at issue here, because they have received \nno individualized determination that they pose a risk of \nflight or present a danger to others, nor is there any evi-\ndence that most or all of them do. \nThis Court has also protected the right to a bail hearing \nduring  extradition  proceedings.  Wright  v.  Henkel,  190 \nU. S. 40 (1903), concerned the arrest and confinement of \nWhitaker Wright, an American citizen, pending extradi-\ntion for a crime that Wright was accused of having com-\nmitted in Great Britain.  Wright sought bail.  Id., at 43. \nSince the federal bail laws applied only to those charged \nwith committing crimes against the United States, they\ndid not cover Wright’s confinement.  Id., at 61–62.  The \nrelevant extradition statute said nothing about bail.  Id., \nat 62.  Its language (stronger than the language at issue \nhere)  said  that  the  individual  was  “to  remain”  in  “the \nproper  jail”  until  the  “surrender  shall  be  made”  to  the \nnation seeking extradition; and it added that he was “to\nremain” in custody “until delivered up”—though after two\nmonths he could seek release.  Rev. Stat. §§5270, 5273. \nIn an opinion by Chief Justice Fuller, this Court unani-\nmously wrote that, despite the lack of express statutory \nauthorization  and  the  risk  of  “embarrassment”  to  the \nUnited States if Wright fled, Wright could seek release on\nbail prior to the expiration of the 2-month period.  Wright, \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 61 of 92   Page ID\n #:9800\n12  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \n190 U. S., at 62–63.  Given the universal entitlement to \nbail under English law, the Court was “unwilling to hold \nthat . . . courts may not in any case, and whatever the\nspecial  circumstances,  extend  that  relief ”  to  prisoners\nawaiting extradition.  Id., at 63.  It consequently read a \nsilent statute as authorizing bail proceedings (though the \nCourt went on to hold that, under applicable standards,\nWright’s request for bail should be denied).  Ibid. \nThe strongest basis for reading the Constitution’s bail\nrequirements as extending to these civil, as well as crimi-\nnal, cases, however, lies in the simple fact that the law \ntreats like cases alike.  And reason tells us that the civil \nconfinement at issue here and the pretrial criminal con-\nfinement that calls for bail are in every relevant sense\nidentical.  There is no difference in respect to the fact of\nconfinement itself.  And I can find no relevant difference \nin respect to bail-related purposes.\nWhich class of persons—criminal defendants or asylum\nseekers—seems  more likely  to  have  acted  in  a  manner \nthat typically warrants confinement?  A person charged\nwith a crime cannot be confined at all without a finding of \nprobable cause that he or she committed the crime.  And \nthe majority of criminal defendants lose their cases.  See \nDept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, B. Reaves,\nFelony  Defendants  in  Large  Urban  Counties,  2009–\nStatistical Tables, p. 24 (Dec. 2013) (reporting that 66% of \nfelony defendants were convicted).  A high percentage of\nthe  noncitizens  before  us,  however,  ultimately  win  the\nright they seek, the right to be in the United States. \nNor  am  I  aware  of  any  evidence  indicating  that  the\nnoncitizens  seeking  to  enter,  or  to  remain  within,  the \nUnited States are more likely than criminal defendants to \nthreaten the safety of the community if released.

In any event, this matter too is to be\ndetermined, case by case, at bail hearings.\nIf there is no reasonable basis for treating these con-\nfined noncitizens worse than ordinary defendants charged\nwith crimes, 18 U. S. C. §3142; worse than convicted crim-\ninals  appealing  their  convictions,  §3143(b);  worse  than \ncivilly  committed  citizens,  supra,  at  10–11;  worse  than \nidentical noncitizens found elsewhere within the United \nStates, supra, at 4; and worse than noncitizens who have \ncommitted crimes, served their sentences, and been defini-\ntively ordered removed (but lack a country willing to take \nthem), supra, at 4, their detention without bail is arbi-\ntrary.  Thus, the constitutional language, purposes, and \ntradition that require bail in instances of criminal con-\nfinement also very likely require bail in these instances of \ncivil confinement.  That perhaps is why Blackstone wrote \nthat the law provides for the possibility of “bail in any case \nwhatsoever.”  4 Analysis of the Laws of England, at 148. \nC \nMy examination of the cases from this Court that con-\nsidered detention of noncitizens and bail suggests that this\nCourt, while sometimes denying bail to individuals, gen-\nerally has not held that bail proceedings are unnecessary.\nIndeed, it almost always has suggested the contrary.\n1. In 1882 Congress enacted two laws that restricted\nimmigration: The first prohibited the entry of “Chinese\nlaborers.”  The Chinese Exclusion Act, ch. 126, 22 Stat. 58. \nThe second prohibited the entry of “any convict, lunatic,\nidiot, or any person unable to take care of himself or her-\nself without becoming a public charge.”  Act of Aug. 3,\n1882, 22 Stat. 214.  Neither said a word about bail.  But in \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 63 of 92   Page ID\n #:9802\n14  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \none instance, an excluded Chinese woman was detained in \njail in San Francisco pending her return to China.  She \nsought bail.  In re Ah Moy, 21 F. 808 (CC Cal. 1884). \nJustice Field, sitting as a Circuit Judge, wrote that the\ncourt lacked the authority to order bail because doing so \nwould allow her to enter the United States—just what the\nstatute forbade.  Id., at 809.  The other sitting Circuit\nJudge (Judge Sawyer) disagreed.  Id., at 810 (dissenting \nopinion).  He pointed out that the alien would remain “in\nthe custody and control of the law while lawfully on bail.” \nIbid.  He added that it “would be a great hardship, not to\nsay a gross violation of her personal rights,” to refuse bail \nfor 15 days before her ship arrived as long as she could \nprovide “security satisfactory to the court” that she would\nindeed depart when it did.  Id., at 809–810.  Two other \nCircuit Judges noted their agreement with Judge Sawyer. \nId., at 809, n. 1.  But they did not participate in the case, \nibid., the two participating judges split 1 to 1, and so the \nviews  of  presiding  Justice  Field  prevailed.  The  alien \nappealed to this Court, Cheong Ah Moy v. United States, \n113 U. S. 216 (1885), but before this Court could decide, \nthe ship departed with Cheong Ah Moy aboard. \n2. In Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228 (1896), \nthe Court struck down as unconstitutional a statute that \nsaid alien Chinese laborers should be “imprisoned at hard \nlabor” for up to a year before being deported.  Id., at 235. \nIn doing so, the Court wrote that although a sentence to \nhard labor was unlawful, “detention, or temporary con-\nfinement,”  was  constitutional,  because  “[d]etention  is  a \nusual feature of every case of arrest on a criminal charge,\neven  when  an  innocent  person  is  wrongfully  accused.” \nIbid.  But an analogy to criminal detention is an analogy \nto instances in which bail hearings are required. \n3. In Tod v. Waldman, 266 U.

They  were  detained\nbecause  the  immigration  inspector  believed  the  mother\nilliterate, one of the daughters disabled, and the whole \nfamily likely to become public charges.  They appealed to\nthe  Labor  Department,  which  ordered  Mrs.  Waldman\nretested for literacy, requiring her to read both Yiddish \nand Hebrew.  She could not.  She then petitioned for a writ\nof habeas corpus on the grounds that (1) as a religious\nrefugee she was exempt from the literacy requirement; (2) \nin any event, she need read only one language, not two; (3)\nher daughter was not disabled; and (4) the Department of \nLabor should have allowed her to appeal administratively. \nId., at 114–115. \nThe relevant statutory provisions, just like the present \nstatute, see infra, at 20, 29, said that an arriving person,\nunless “clearly and beyond a doubt entitled” to land, “shall \nbe detained for examination . . . by a board of special in-\nquiry.”  Act of Feb. 5, 1917, §16, 39 Stat. 886 (emphasis \nadded).  By the time the case reached this Court, however, \nthe  family  had  been  allowed  bail.  See  Waldman,  266 \nU. S., at 117.  This Court ordered the Department of Labor \nto  provide  the  family  with  an  administrative  appeal. \nThen, after initially “remand[ing] the petitioners to the \ncustody of immigration authorities” pending the outcome \nof the appeal, id., at 120, the Court clarified in a rehearing\norder that “[n]othing in the order of this Court shall prej-\nudice an application for release on bail of the respondents\npending compliance with the mandate of this Court.”  Tod \nv. Waldman, 266 U. S. 547, 548 (1925).  This statement is \ninconsistent  with  the  earlier  opinion  of  Justice  Field, \nsitting as a Circuit Judge, because it shows that even an\nalien challenging her exclusion could be released on bail. \nSupra, at 14. \n4.

It \nsaid  nothing  to  suggest  that  bail  proceedings  were \nunnecessary.\n5. In Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 \nU. S.  206  (1953),  the  Attorney  General  had  ordered  a\nnoncitizen permanently excluded from the United States \non the ground that his “entry would be prejudicial to the \npublic interest for security reasons.”  Id., at 208; see Sub-\nversive Activities Control Act of 1950, §§22–23, 64 Stat.\n1006–1012.  He “sat on Ellis Island because this country\nshut him out and others were unwilling to take him in.” \n345 U. S., at 209.  After 21 months in confinement he filed \na  petition  for  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  seeking  judicial \nreview of the exclusion decision or release on bail until he \ncould be removed to another country.  Id., at 207, 209. \nThis Court refused to review the exclusion decision on the \nground  that  the  security  matter  fell  totally  within  the \nPresident’s authority, pursuant to an express congressional\ndelegation of power.  Id., at 210.  The Court also denied \nMezei a bail proceeding because in an “exclusion proceed-\ning grounded on danger to the national security . . . nei-\nther the rationale nor the statutory authority for” release \non bail exists.  Id., at 216.  It denied bail, however, after \nthe Attorney General had already found, on an individual-\nized basis, not only that Mezei was a security risk and\nconsequently not entitled to either admission or bail, but \nalso that he could be denied a hearing on the matter be-\ncause the basis for that decision could not be disclosed \nwithout harm to national security.  Id., at 208–209.  The \nrespondents in this case have been the subject of no such\nindividualized findings.  And unlike Mezei, who was re-\nquesting bail after his exclusion proceedings had ended\n(while the Attorney General searched for a country that\nwould take him—a matter that we again confronted in \nZadvydas), the respondents here continue to litigate the \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 66 of 92   Page ID\n #:9805\nCite as: 583 U.

Thus, Mezei, but not \nthe respondents here, was in a sense in the position of a \nconvicted criminal who had lost his appeal, not a criminal \nawaiting trial (or the results of an appeal). \n6. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678 (2001), concerned a\nnoncitizen who had lawfully resided in this country, com-\nmitted a serious crime, completed his prison sentence, and \nwas then ordered deported.  Id., at 684.  Zadvydas sought\nrelease on bail during the time the Government searched\nfor a country that would take him.  Id., at 684–685.  The \ngoverning statute said an alien such as Zadvydas “may be\ndetained”  pending  his  removal  to  another  country.  8 \nU. S. C. §1231(a)(6).  We interpreted those words as re-\nquiring release from detention once it became clear that\nthere  was  “no  significant  likelihood  of  removal  in  the \nreasonably  foreseeable  future”—presumptively  after  a\nperiod of confinement of six months.  533 U. S., at 701. \nWe read the statute as requiring this release because a\n“statute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would \nraise a serious constitutional problem.”  Id., at 690. \nFrom a constitutional perspective, this case follows a \nfortiori from Zadvydas.  Here only a bail hearing is at \nissue, not release on bail, much less permanent release.\nAnd here there has been no final determination that any\nof the respondents lacks a legal right to stay in the United\nStates—the  bail  hearing  at  issue  concerns  conditional\nrelease pending that final determination.  It is immaterial \nthat  detention  here  is  not  literally  indefinite,  because \nwhile  the  respondents’  removal  proceedings  must  end \neventually, they last an indeterminate period of at least \nsix months and a year on average, thereby implicating the \nsame  constitutional  right  against  prolonged  arbitrary \ndetention that we recognized in Zadvydas. \n7.

S. 510 (2003), we held that \nthe Government could constitutionally hold without bail \nnoncitizens who had committed certain crimes, had com-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 67 of 92   Page ID\n #:9806\n18  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \npleted their sentences, and were in removal proceedings.\nSee §1226(c).  But we based our holding on the short-term\nnature of the confinement necessary to complete proceed-\nings.  See id., at 529–530.  The Court wrote that the “de-\ntention at stake . . . lasts roughly a month and a half in\nthe vast majority of cases in which it is invoked, and about \nfive months in the minority of cases in which the alien\nchooses to appeal.”  Id., at 530.  We added: \n“[I]n 85% of the cases in which aliens are detained\n[pursuant to the relevant statute], removal proceed-\nings are completed in an average time of 47 days and \na median of 30 days.  In the remaining 15% of cases, \nin which the alien appeals the decision of the immi-\ngration judge to the Board of Immigration Appeals, \nappeal takes an average of four months, with a median\ntime that is slightly shorter.”  Id., at 529 (citation \nomitted). \nDemore himself, an outlier, was detained for six months. \nId., at 530–531. \nThe Court then found detention constitutional “during\nthe limited period” necessary to arrange for removal, and \nwe contrasted that period of detention with the detention\nat issue in Zadvydas, referring to the detention in Demore \nas being “of a much shorter duration.”  538 U. S., at 526, \n528.  JUSTICE KENNEDY stated in a concurrence that the \nDue Process Clause might require bail hearings “if the\ncontinued detention became unreasonable or unjustified.” \nId., at 532.  Dissenting, I wrote that, had I believed that \nDemore  “had  conceded  that  he  [was]  deportable,”  then,\ndespite Zadvydas, “I would conclude that the Government \ncould detain him without bail for the few weeks ordinarily \nnecessary for formal entry of a removal order.”  538 U. S., \nat 576 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nThe Government now tells us that the statistics it gave\nto the Court in Demore were wrong.  Detention normally \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 68 of 92   Page ID\n #:9807\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  19 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nlasts twice as long as the Government then said it did. \nAnd, as I have pointed out, thousands of people here are\nheld for considerably longer than six months without an\nopportunity to seek bail.  See supra, at 3.  We deal here \nwith prolonged detention, not the short-term detention at\nissue in Demore.  Hence Demore, itself a deviation from \nthe history and tradition of bail and alien detention, can-\nnot help the Government.\nThe  upshot  is  the  following:  The  Constitution’s  lan-\nguage, its basic purposes, the relevant history, our tradi-\ntion, and many of the relevant cases point in the same \ninterpretive direction.  They tell us that an interpretation\nof the statute before us that would deny bail proceedings\nwhere detention is prolonged would likely mean that the \nstatute violates the Constitution.  The interpretive princi-\nple that flows from this conclusion is clear and longstand-\ning: “‘[A]s between two possible interpretations of a stat-\nute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by\nthe other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which will \nsave the Act.’”  Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 190 (1991) \n(quoting  Blodgett  v.  Holden,  275  U. S.  142,  148  (1927) \n(opinion of Holmes, J.)).  Moreover, a “statute must be \nconstrued, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the \nconclusion  that  it  is  unconstitutional,  but  also  grave\ndoubts upon that score.”  Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S., at 401. \nThese  legal  principles  reflect  a  realistic  assumption, \nnamely, that Congress—particularly a Congress that did not\nconsider  a  constitutional  matter—would  normally  have \npreferred a constitutional interpretation to an interpreta-\ntion that may render a statute an unconstitutional nullity.\nAnd that is so even where the constitutional interpreta-\ntion departs from the most natural reading of the statute’s\nlanguage.  See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf \nCoast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, \n575 (1988); see also National Federation of Independent \nBusiness v. Sebelius, 567 U.

RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \n(majority opinion and opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). \nIII \nThe Statutory Provisions \nThe question remains whether it is possible to read the\nstatute as authorizing bail.  As desirable as a constitu-\ntional interpretation of a statute may be, we cannot read it \nto say the opposite of what its language states.  The word \n“animal” does not include minerals, no matter how strongly\none  might  wish  that  it  did.    Indeed,  where  “‘Congress\nhas made its intent in the statute clear, we must give\neffect to that intent,’” even if doing so requires us to con-\nsider  the  constitutional  question,  and  even  if  doing  so \nmeans  that  we  hold  the  statute  unconstitutional. \nZadvydas, 533 U. S., at 696 (quoting Miller v. French, 530 \nU. S. 327, 336 (2000)).  In my view, however, we can, and \nshould, read the relevant statutory provisions to require\nbail proceedings in instances of prolonged detention with-\nout  doing  violence  to  the  statutory  language  or  to  the\nprovisions’ basic purposes. \nA \nAsylum Seekers \nThe  relevant  provision  governing  the  first  class  of \nnoncitizens, the asylum seekers, is §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  It \nsays  that,  if  an  immigration  “officer  determines  at  the\ntime” of an initial interview with an alien seeking to enter \nthe United States “that [the] alien has a credible fear of \npersecution . . . , the alien shall be detained for further \nconsideration of the application for asylum.”  See Appen-\ndix A–1, infra.  I have emphasized the three key words,\nnamely, “shall be detained.”  Do those words mean that \nthe asylum seeker must be detained without bail? \nThey do not.  First, in ordinary English and in light of\nthe  history  of  bail,  the  word  “detain”  is  ambiguous  in\nrespect to the relevant point.  The Oxford English Diction-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 70 of 92   Page ID\n #:9809\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  21 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nary (OED), surveying the history of the word, notes that \nEdward  Hall,  a  famous  16th-century  legal  scholar  and \nauthor of Hall’s Chronicle, wrote: “A traytor . . . is appre-\nhended and deteigned in prisone for his offence,” a use of \nthe word, as we know from Blackstone, that is consistent \nwith bail.  See supra, at 8–9; OED (3d ed., Dec. 2012),\nhttp://www.oed.com/view/Entry/51176  (annot.  to  def.  1).\nDavid  Hume,  the  famous  18th-century  historian  and \nphilosopher,  writes  of  being  “detained  in  strict  confine-\nment,” thereby implying the existence of detention without \nstrict confinement.  Ibid.  A 19th-century novelist writes,\n“‘Beg your pardon, sir,’ said the constable, . . . ‘I shall be \nobliged to detain you till this business is settled’”—again a\nuse of “detain” that we know (from Blackstone) is con-\nsistent with bail.  Ibid.  And the OED concludes that the \nprimary meaning of “detain” is “[t]o keep in confinement \nor  under  restraint;  to  keep  prisoner.”    Ibid.  (emphasis \nadded).  To  grant  bail,  we  know,  is  not  to  grant  unre-\nstrained freedom.  Rather, where the Act elsewhere ex-\npressly permits bail, it requires “bond of at least $1,500\nwith  security  approved  by,  and  containing  conditions\nprescribed  by,  the  Attorney  General.”   8  U. S. C. \n§1226(a)(2)(A).  Similarly  in  the  criminal  context,  bail\nimposes numerous restraints, ranging from the provision \nof a bond, to restrictions on residences and travel, to the \nimposition of a curfew, to a requirement to obtain medical\ntreatment, to report at regular intervals, or even to return \nto  custody  at  specified  hours.  See  18  U. S. C. \n§3142(c)(1)(B) (listing possible conditions for the pretrial \nrelease of federal criminal defendants).\nAt  the  very  least,  because  the  word  “detain”  in  this\ncontext refers to a comparatively long period of time, it can \nreadily coexist with a word such as “bail” that refers to a \nshorter period of conditional release.  For instance, there \nis nothing inconsistent in saying: During his exile, he was \npermitted to pay short visits to his home country; during \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 71 of 92   Page ID\n #:9810\n22  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nthe period of active hostilities, the soldiers would lay down \ntheir arms and fraternize on Christmas Day; during his\noverseas detention, he was allowed home to see his sick \nmother; or during his detention pending proceedings, he \nwas permitted bail. \nSecond, our precedent treats the statutory word “detain” \nas consistent with bail.  In Waldman, 266 U. S. 547, we \nconsidered an immigration statute that stated (in respect \nto arriving aliens) that “[e]very alien who may not appear\nto the examining inspector at the port of arrival to be \nclearly and beyond a doubt entitled to land shall be de-\ntained for examination in relation thereto by a board of \nspecial inquiry.”  Act of Feb. 5, 1917, §16, 39 Stat. 886 \n(emphasis  added).    The  Court  indicated  that  bail  was \navailable, stating that “[n]othing in the order of this court \nshall prejudice an application for release on bail.”  266 \nU. S., at 548.  In so stating, the Court was simply follow-\ning precedent, such as Wright v. Henkel, where the Court \nwrote that bail is available even where not “specifically \nvested by statute.”  190 U. S., at 63; see supra, at 11–12. \nWhen Congress passed the relevant provisions of the Act\nin 1996, it legislated against this historical backdrop, at a\ntime when the precise language that it adopted had been\ninterpreted by this Court to permit bail.  See Monessen \nSouthwestern R. Co. v. Morgan, 486 U. S. 330, 338 (1988) \n(“Congress’ failure to disturb a consistent judicial inter-\npretation of a statute may provide some indication that \n‘Congress at least acquiesces in, and apparently affirms,\nthat  [interpretation]’”  (quoting  Cannon  v.  University  of \nChicago, 441 U. S. 677, 703 (1979))). \nThird, the Board of Immigration Appeals reads the word\n“detain” as consistent with bail, for it has held that its \nregulations, implementing the same statutory provision as \nis before us, allow bail for asylum seekers who are appre-\nhended inside the United States within 100 miles of the \nborder, rather than at a border crossing.  See In re X-K-, \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 72 of 92   Page ID\n #:9811\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  23 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \n23  I. & N.  Dec.,  at  732,  734–735  (discussing  8  CFR \n§1003.19(h)(2)(i)  (2004)).    The  same  statute,  same  lan-\nguage applies to the detention of those asylum seekers and \nthe ones before us, so the statute must be consistent with \nbail in the Board of Immigration Appeals’ view. \nFourth, in Zadvydas we found (to avoid similar constitu-\ntional questions) that the words “‘may be detained’” were\nconsistent with requiring release from long-term deten-\ntion.  533 U. S., at 682 (quoting 8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(6)).\nThe majority correctly notes that here the language sub-\nstitutes the word “shall” for the word “may.”  Ante, at 14– \n16.  But the majority is wrong to distinguish Zadvydas on \nthis basis.  There the Court did not emphasize the word\n“detain,” for the question at issue was release from deten-\ntion.  And the key word was consequently “may,” suggest-\ning discretion.  Here the question concerns the right to a \nbail  hearing  during  detention.    And  the  key  linguistic\nambiguity concerns the word “detention.”  Is that word \nconsistent  with  bail  proceedings?  The  answer,  for  the \nreasons I have stated, is “yes.” \nFifth,  the  statute  does  not  even  mention  long-term\ndetention without bail.  Whether the statute speaks in \nterms of discretion (“may,” as in Zadvydas) or mandatory\naction (“shall,” as in this case), the Government’s argu-\nment is wrong for the same reason: Congress does not\nunambiguously authorize long-term detention without bail \nby failing to say when detention must end.  As we recog-\nnized in Zadvydas, Congress anticipated long-term deten-\ntion elsewhere in the Act, providing for review every six \nmonths  of  terrorist  aliens  detained  under  8  U. S. C. \n§1537(b)(2)(C), but it did not do so here.  See 533 U. S., at \n697. \nSixth, the Act provides that an asylum applicant whose\nproceedings  last  longer  than  six  months  may  be  given \nwork  authorization.    §1158(d)(2).    The  majority  would \napply this provision to some asylum applicants but not the \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 73 of 92   Page ID\n #:9812\n24  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nones before us.  Ante, at 26, n. 6.  Of course, the statute \ndoes not contain that limitation.  Read most naturally, the\nprovision  offers  some  indication  that  Congress,  in  the \nsame statute, did not require asylum seekers to remain\nconfined without bail at the 6-month mark. \nSeventh,  there  is  a  separate  statutory  provision  that \npurports to do precisely what the majority says this one \ndoes, providing that certain aliens “shall be detained . . . \nuntil removed.”  §1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV) (emphasis added); \nante,  at  16  (detention  must  continue  until  proceedings\n“have finished”).  The problem for the majority is that this \nother provision applies only to those who, unlike the re-\nspondents, have no credible fear of persecution.  The pro-\nvision that applies here lacks similar language. \nLinguistic ambiguity, while necessary, is not sufficient.\nI would also ask whether the statute’s purposes suggest a\ncongressional refusal to permit bail where confinement is \nprolonged.  The answer is “no.”  There is nothing in the\nstatute or in the legislative history that reveals any such\ncongressional intent.  The most likely reason for its ab-\nsence is that Congress, like the Government when it ap-\npeared before us in Demore, believed there were no such \ninstances, or at least that there were very few.  Indeed, \nthe Act suggests that asylum proceedings ordinarily finish\nquickly.  See §1158(d)(5)(A) (providing that absent “excep-\ntional  circumstances,”  final  administrative  adjudication\n(not  including  appeal)  must  be  completed  “within  180\ndays,” and any appeal must be filed “within 30 days” of the\ndecision).  And for those proceedings that last longer than \nsix months, we know that two-thirds of asylum seekers \nwin  their  cases.  Thus,  legislative  silence  suggests  not\ndisapproval of bail, but a lack of consideration of the mat-\nter.  For present purposes that is sufficient.  It means that \nCongress did not intend to forbid bail.  An interpretation\nthat permits bail—based upon history, tradition, statutory \ncontext,  and  precedent—is  consistent,  not  inconsistent, \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 74 of 92   Page ID\n #:9813\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  25 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nwith what Congress intended the statutory provision to\ndo. \nThe majority apparently finds a contrary purpose in the \nfact that other provisions of the statute permit the Attor-\nney  General  to  release  an  alien  on  parole  “‘for  urgent \nhumanitarian reasons or significant public benefit’” and\nimpose bail-like conditions.  Ante, at 16–17 (discussing 8 \nU. S. C. §1182(d)(5)(A)).  Yet under the majority’s inter-\npretation of “detain,” the same argument could have been\nmade in Zadvydas.  We held that noncitizens presump-\ntively are entitled to release after six months of detention,\nnotwithstanding an available alternative avenue for relief, \nnamely, bail.  533 U. S., at 683.  There is no reason to \nreach  a  different  result  here.    While  the  Government \nhistorically used this provision to take account of tradi-\ntional bail factors (flight risk, safety risk), the President\nsince  issued  an  Executive  Order  directing  parole  to  be\ngranted  “in  all  circumstances  only  when  an  individual \ndemonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a signifi-\ncant public benefit.”  Exec. Order. No. 13767, 82 Fed. Reg. \n8793 (2017).  And besides, Congress’ provision of parole to\npermit, for example, release for the purpose of medical \ncare or to testify in a court proceeding—which adds to the \ncircumstances under which a noncitizen can be released \nfrom confinement—says nothing about whether Congress\nintended to cut back on those circumstances in respect to\nthe meaning of “detain” and the historical understanding \nthat detention permits bail. \nB \nCriminals Who Have Served Their Sentences \nThe relevant statutory provision, §1226(c), says in para-\ngraph (1) that the “Attorney General shall take into cus- \ntody any alien who . . . is deportable [or inadmissible] by\nreason  of  having  committed  [certain  crimes]  when  the \nalien is released,” presumably (or ordinarily) after having \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 75 of 92   Page ID\n #:9814\n26  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nserved his sentence.  It then goes on to say, in paragraph \n(2), that the “Attorney General may release [that] alien . . . \nonly if the Attorney General decides pursuant to section\n3521 of title 18 that release of the alien from custody is \nnecessary to provide protection to a witness [or to certain \nrelated others].”  See Appendix A–2, infra. \nI  have  emphasized  the  relevant  phrases:  “take  into \ncustody” in the first paragraph, and “may release [that] \nalien . . . only if ” in the second paragraph.  We have long\ninterpreted “in custody” as “not requir[ing] that a prisoner\nbe physically confined.”  Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488, \n491 (1989) (per curiam).  In the habeas context, we have \nheld that “a person released on bail or on his own recogni-\nzance” is “‘in custody’ within the meaning of the statute.” \nHensley v. Municipal Court, San Jose-Milpitas Judicial \nDist., Santa Clara Cty., 411 U. S. 345, 349 (1973); Justices \nof Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, 466 U. S. 294, 300– \n301 (1984) (same).  The reason is simple, as I already have \nexplained, supra, at 21: A person who is released on bail \n“is subject to restraints ‘not shared by the public gener-\nally.’”  Hensley, supra, at 351 (quoting Jones v. Cunning-\nham, 371 U. S. 236, 240 (1963)); see also Maleng, supra, at \n491 (“[A] prisoner who had been placed on parole was still\n‘in custody’” because his “release from physical confine-\nment . . . was not unconditional; instead, it was explicitly \nconditioned on his reporting regularly to his parole officer, \nremaining in a particular community, residence, and job, \nand refraining from certain activities” (citing Jones, supra, \nat 242)).\nMoreover,  there  is  no  reason  to  interpret  “custody”\ndifferently than “detain.”  The OED defines “custody” as\n“[t]he state of being detained,” http://www.oed.com/view/\nEntry/46305  (def.  5).  “Detained,”  as  I  have  previously\npointed out, can be read consistently with bail.  See supra,\nat 20–23.  The OED also defines the statutory phrase, \n“take (a person) into custody,” as “to arrest and imprison \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 76 of 92   Page ID\n #:9815\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  27 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \n(a person),” http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/46305 (def. 5). \nAnd we know from the history, tradition, case law, and \nother sources earlier discussed, including Blackstone, that \narresting and imprisoning a person is consistent with a \nbail hearing and a subsequent grant of bail, even where a \nstatute contains words such as “commitment” or “detain.” \nSee supra, at 5–19 (citing, e.g., Wright, 190 U. S., at 62 \n(reading as consistent with a bail proceeding the statutory\nlanguage “‘shall issue [a] warrant for the commitment . . . \nto the proper jail, there to remain’” until “‘surrender’” for \nextradition)). \nBut  what  about  the  second  phrase,  stating  that  the\nAttorney General “may release [that] alien . . . only if the \nAttorney General decides pursuant to section 3521 of title \n18 that release of the alien from custody is necessary to\nprovide protection to a witness”?  Does the presence of the \nwords “only if ” show that the statute automatically denies\nbail for any other reason?\nIt does not.  That is because the phrase has nothing to \ndo with bail.  It has to do with a special program, the\nWitness  Protection  Program,  set  forth  in  18  U. S. C. \n§3521.  That  program  allows  the  Attorney  General  to \nrelocate the witness, to give him an entirely new identity,\nto help his family similarly, and to pay him a stipend,\namong other things.  §§3521(a)(1), (b)(1).  The Attorney \nGeneral may “take such action as [he] determines to be\nnecessary to protect the person,” presumably even free the\nwitness from whatever obligations might require him to \nreport  to  an  immigration  or  judicial  authority.\n§3521(b)(1).  Accordingly,  when  the  Attorney  General \n“release[s]” an alien under 8 U. S. C. §1226(c)(2), he does \nnot grant bail; he may well do far more, freeing the wit-\nness from a host of obligations and restraints, including \nthose  many  obligations  and  restraints  that  accompany\nbail.  See supra, at 21. \nThis understanding of “release” in §1226(c) is consistent \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 77 of 92   Page ID\n #:9816\n28  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nwith  the  OED’s  definition  of  “release”  as  “to  free  from \nrestraint” or even “to liberate from . . . an obligation” (not \nsimply “to free from . . . captivity”), http://www.oed.com/ \nview/Entry/161859 (def. 6(a)).  And it is consistent with \nour earlier reading of the word “detain.”  Supra, at 20–24. \nFollowing the OED’s definition of “detain” as “under re-\nstraint,” we have understood the word “detention” to in-\nclude the state of being “under” those “restraints” that\ntypically accompany bail.  Supra, at 20–24.  That is to say,\nboth the individual on bail and the individual not on bail \nare  “detained”;  and  the  Attorney  General,  through  his \nWitness Protection Program powers can free the individual\nfrom both.  To repeat: The provision at issue means that\nthe Attorney General “may release” the detained person \nfrom the restraints that accompany detainment—whether\nthat individual has been detained with, or without, bail. \nSo understood the phrase has nothing to do with the\nissue before us: whether a confined individual is, or is not, \nentitled to bail or a bail hearing.  It simply means that the\nAttorney  General  cannot  free  that  person  from  all,  or \nmost, restraining conditions (including those that accom-\npany bail) unless the alien is placed in the Witness Protec-\ntion Program.  So read, the words “only if ” neither favor\nnor disfavor a reading of the statute consistent with the \nright to a bail proceeding. \nThe  purpose-related  reasons  that  argue  for  a  bail-\nfavorable reading are also applicable here.  Congress did\nnot consider the problem of long-term detention.  It wrote \nthe statute with brief detention in mind.  See H. R. Rep. \nNo. 104–469, pt. 1, p. 123, and n. 25 (1996) (stating that\nthe “average stay [was] 28 days”).  Congress did not know\n(for apparently the Government did not know in Demore)\nthat the average length of detention for this class would \nturn out to be about a year.  Nor did Congress necessarily\nknow that about 40% of class members eventually obtain \nthe right to remain in the United States. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 78 of 92   Page ID\n #:9817\nCite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)  29 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nI should add that reading the statute as denying bail to \nthose whose detention is prolonged is anomalous.  Those \nwhose removal is legally or factually questionable could be\nimprisoned indefinitely while the matter is being decided.\nThose  whose  removal  is  not  questionable  (for  they  are \nunder a final removal order) could be further imprisoned \nfor no more than six months.  See supra, at 4, 17.  In fact, \neven  before  our  decision  in  Zadvydas,  the  Government \ngave bail hearings to noncitizens under a final order of \nremoval after six months of detention.  See 533 U. S., at \n683. \nC \nOther Applicants for Admission \nThe statutory provision that governs the third category \nof  noncitizens  seeking  admission  at  the  border  is \n§1225(b)(2)(A).  It says that “if the examining immigration\nofficer determines that an alien seeking admission is not \nclearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the \nalien  shall  be  detained  for  a  proceeding  under  section\n1229a of this title.”  See Appendix A–3, infra. \nThe Government tells us that this miscellaneous cate- \ngory consists of persons who are neither (1) clearly eligible \nfor admission, nor (2) clearly ineligible.  Pet. for Cert. 3–4. \nA clearly eligible person is, of course, immediately admit-\nted.  A clearly ineligible person—someone who lacks the\nrequired  documents,  or  provides  fraudulent  ones—is \n“removed  . . .  without  further  hearing  or  review.” \n§1225(b)(1)(A)(i);  see  §§1182(a)(6)(C),  (a)(7).  But  where \nthe matter is not clear, i.e., where the immigration officer \ndetermines  that  an  alien  “is  not  clearly  and  beyond  a \ndoubt entitled to be admitted,” he is detained for a re-\nmoval proceeding.  §1225(b)(2)(A).  Like all respondents, this\nclass has been detained for at least six months.  It may \ninclude persons returning to the United States who have\nwork  permits  or  other  documents  seemingly  entitling \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 79 of 92   Page ID\n #:9818\n30  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nthem to entry, but whom an immigration officer suspects \nare inadmissible for some other reason, such as because \nthey may have incomplete vaccinations or have committed\nstudent visa abuse or a crime of “moral turpitude.”  See \n§1182(a) (delineating classes of aliens ineligible for admis-\nsion).  For instance, the Federal Register is replete with\nexamples  of  offenses  that  immigration  authorities  have\nthought are crimes of moral turpitude but that the courts\nof appeals later determine are not.  See, e.g., Goldeshtein \nv. INS, 8 F. 3d 645, 648 (CA9 1993) (structuring financial \ntransactions to avoid currency reports); Nunez v. Holder, \n594 F. 3d 1124, 1138 (CA9 2010) (indecent exposure).  It \nalso  may  include  individuals  who  claim  citizenship  by \nvirtue  of  birth  or  parentage  but  who  lack  documents \nclearly proving their claim. \nThe critical statutory  words are the same as those I \nhave just discussed in the context of the asylum seekers—\n“shall be detained.”  There is no more plausible reason \nhere than there was there to believe those words foreclose \nbail.  See supra, at 20–24.  The constitutional considera-\ntions, the statutory language, and the purposes underlying \nthe statute are virtually the same.  Thus, the result should \nbe the same: Given the constitutional considerations, we \nshould interpret the statute as permitting bail. \nIV \nThe majority concludes in Part V, ante, at 29–31, by\nsaying that, before considering bail-related constitutional \narguments, the lower courts “should reexamine whether \nrespondents  can  continue  litigating  their  claims  as  a \nclass.”  Ante, at 29.  Relying on dicta in Reno v. American-\nArab  Anti-Discrimination  Comm.,  525  U. S.  471  (1999) \n(AADC), it then suggests that the respondents may not be \nable to continue litigating because the Act says that \n“no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have \njurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the oper-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 80 of 92   Page ID\n #:9819\nCite as: 583 U.

S. C. \n§1252(f)(1). \nWere the majority’s suggestion correct as to this juris-\ndictional question, it would have shown, at most, that we\nshould decide the constitutional question here and now. \nWe have already asked for and  received briefs on that\nquestion.  But I do not believe the majority is correct.\nEvery member of the classes before us falls within the\nprovision’s exception.  Every one of them is an “individual\nalien  against  whom  proceedings  under  such  part  have\nbeen initiated.”  Ibid.  The Court in AADC did not con-\nsider, and had no reason to consider, the application of \n§1252(f)(1) to such a class.  Regardless, a court could order \ndeclaratory relief.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) \npermits  a  class  action  where  “final  injunctive  relief  or \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting\nthe class as a whole.”  (Emphasis added.)  And the Advisory \nCommittee  says  that  declaratory  relief  can  fall  within\nthe Rule’s term “corresponding” if it “serves as a basis for\nlater  injunctive  relief.”  Notes  on  Rule  23(b)(2)–1966\nAmendment, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 812. \nJurisdiction also is unaffected by 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9),\nwhich by its terms applies only “[w]ith respect to review of\nan order of removal under [§1252(a)(1)].”  §1252(b).  Re-\nspondents challenge their detention without bail, not an\norder of removal. \n  Neither does Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. \n338 (2011), bar these class actions.  Every member of each\nclass seeks the same relief (a bail hearing), every member\nhas been denied that relief, and the differences in situa-\ntion among members of the class are not relevant to their \nentitlement to a bail hearing. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 479   Filed 02/27/18   Page 81 of 92   Page ID\n #:9820\n32  JENNINGS v. RODRIGUEZ \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nAt a minimum I can find nothing in the statute or in the\ncases to which the majority refers that would prevent the\nrespondents from pursuing their action, obtaining a de-\nclaratory  judgment,  and  then  using  that  judgment  to\nobtain relief, namely, a bail hearing, in an individual case.\nThus, I believe the lower courts are free to consider the \nconstitutionality  of  the  relevant  statutory  provisions  as\nthe majority now interprets them. \nV \nConclusion \nThe relevant constitutional language, purposes, history,\ntraditions, context, and case law, taken together, make it \nlikely that, where confinement of the noncitizens before us \nis prolonged (presumptively longer than six months), bail\nproceedings  are  constitutionally  required.    Given  this \nserious  constitutional  problem,  I  would  interpret  the \nstatutory provisions before us as authorizing bail.  Their \nlanguage  permits  that  reading,  it  furthers  their  basic \npurposes, and it is consistent with the history, tradition, \nand constitutional values associated with bail proceedings.\nI believe that those bail proceedings should take place in \naccordance with customary rules of procedure and burdens \nof proof rather than the special rules that the Ninth Cir-\ncuit imposed.\nThe bail questions before us are technical but at heart \nthey are simple.  We need only recall the words of the\nDeclaration of Independence, in particular its insistence \nthat  all  men  and  women  have  “certain  unalienable \nRights,” and that among them is the right to “Liberty.”\nWe  need merely  remember  that  the  Constitution’s  Due\nProcess Clause protects each person’s liberty from arbi-\ntrary deprivation.  And we need just keep in mind the fact\nthat, since Blackstone’s time and long before, liberty has\nincluded the right of a confined person to seek release on \nbail.

Petitioners Alejandro Rodriguez, Abdirizak Farah, Yussuf Abdikadir, Jose \n3  Farias Cornejo, Abel Perez Ruelas, Angel Ayala, and Alex Cacho Castillo are non-\n4  citizens who have been subjected to prolonged incarceration at the hands of the \n5  Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the Department of Homeland \n6  Security (“ICE”). Each of them has been or likely will be incarcerated for more than \n7  six months while their immigration proceedings have been on-going without a hearing \n8  where the government has had to justify their prolonged detention. They challenge \n9  prolonged imprisonment without adequate process on constitutional grounds, on \n10  behalf of themselves and a class of similarly-situated non-citizens.  \n11  2.  Prior to the injunctions in this case, on any given day there were several \n12  hundred non-citizens who, like the Petitioners, were detained for prolonged periods \n13  without adequate custody hearings in the Central District of California. All such \n14  individuals were incarcerated by ICE for more than six months while their \n15  immigration proceedings remained on-going.  \n16  3.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Petitioners’ constitutional claims \n17  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2241 (habeas corpus), 28 U.S.C. 1651 (All Writs Act), and the \n18  Suspension Clause of Article I of the U.S. Constitution. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, \n19  304 (2001); Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 516-17 (2003). This Court also has \n20  jurisdiction to hear this case under 28 U.S.C. 1331, which confers jurisdiction to \n21  consider federal questions. Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1052 (9th Cir. 1998); cf. \n22  Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U.S. 74, 82 (2005) (challenges to parole release procedures \n23  cognizable under Section 1983).1 \n24  4.  This Court may grant relief under 28 U.S.C. 1331 (federal question), 28 U.S.C. \n25  1651 (All Writs Act), 28 U.S.C. 2241 and 2243 (habeas corpus), and 28 U.S.C. 2201-\n26                                             \n1 This action is both a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. \n27 \n1331 and a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. 2241. For ease of \n28  reference the complaint refers to “Petitioners” and “Respondents.”  \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 4 of 36   Page ID #:9986\n \n1  02 (declaratory relief). \n2  5.  Venue is proper in the Central District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n3  2241(d) because Petitioners and all other class members are incarcerated at \n4  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) prisons within this District. Venue is \n5  proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1391(b) because a substantial part of the events giving \n6  rise to these claims occurred in this District. \n \n7  INTRODUCTION \n8  6.  Petitioner Alejandro Rodriguez is a citizen of Mexico who came to the United \n9  States at the age of one. Prior to the filing of the original complaint in this case, he \n10  was imprisoned for over three years without a hearing concerning whether his \n11  prolonged incarceration was justified. During that time, the government refused even \n12  to consider him for release while he litigated his removal case, despite the fact that it \n13  presented a complex and novel question of law explicitly left open by the Supreme \n14  Court and the Ninth Circuit. \n15  7.  The government released Mr. Rodriguez shortly after he filed a motion for class \n16  certification in this case, but continued to subject him to serious restraints on his \n17  liberty without allowing him to challenge them in a bond hearing. It then argued that \n18  his case was moot. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, rejected the government’s other \n19  objections, and found class certification warranted. Rodriguez v. Hayes (Rodriguez I), \n20  591 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2010). \n21  8.   This Court subsequently certified the class and directed the formation of sub-\n22  classes, after which Petitioners amended the complaint. See Dkt. 77, Class \n23  Certification Order. This Court then granted a preliminary injunction, (Dkt. 255, \n24  Order and Preliminary Injunction), which the Ninth Circuit affirmed in Rodriguez v. \n25  Robbins (Rodriguez II), 715 F.3d 1127 (9th Cir. 2013). This Court then granted \n26  summary judgment for Petitioners in part. See Dkt. 353, Order, Judgement and \n27  Permanent Injunction. The Ninth Circuit largely affirmed. Rodriguez v. Robbins \n28  (Rodriguez III), 804 F.3d 1060 (9th Cir. 2015). The Supreme Court then granted \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 5 of 36   Page ID #:9987\n \n1  certiorari. After two oral arguments, the Court reversed the Ninth Circuit’s holding \n2  that the immigration statutes must be construed to require adequate bond hearings, \n3  but remanded for consideration of Petitioners’ constitutional claims, as well as certain \n4  questions related to class certification. Jennings v. Rodriguez (Rodriguez IV), 138 \n5  S.Ct. 830 (2018). On remand, the Ninth Circuit in turn remanded to this Court, while \n6  also providing some guidance on the remanded questions. Rodriguez v. Marin \n7  (Rodriguez V), 909 F.3d 252 (9th Cir. 2018). Neither the Supreme Court nor the \n8  Ninth Circuit vacated this Court’s permanent injunction, which remains in place. \n9  9.  Prior to the injunctions, on any given day, there were at least approximately 350 \n10  people, if not more, in immigration prisons throughout the Central District who had \n11  been incarcerated for more than six months – many of them for years – while their \n12  cases remained pending.  \n13  10.  None of these people had received a hearing to determine whether their \n14  prolonged incarceration was warranted, and the vast majority had not received any \n15  hearing at all.2 Thus, the government routinely incarcerated people for months or \n16  years without demonstrating why their extended imprisonment was necessary either \n17  to secure their presence at the time of removal or to protect the public safety – a \n18  dubious concern given that many class members have no criminal history, and even \n19 \n                                           \n2 Petitioners refer interchangeably throughout this complaint to a hearing to determine \n20 \nwhether “prolonged incarceration” is justified, a “constitutionally-adequate” hearing, \n21 \nand an “adequate” hearing to justify prolonged incarceration. See Rodriguez I, 591 \n22  F.3d at 1112 (noting that “Petitioner’s requested relief includes . . . providing all \nmembers of the class constitutionally-adequate individual hearings before an \n23 \nimmigration judge”). A hearing that is adequate to justify prolonged detention would \n24  include, at a minimum, notice to detainees of their right to the hearing, an adversarial, \ntranscribed, in-person hearing before an immigration judge or other impartial \n25 \nadjudicator, counsel for detainees who are unrepresented at that hearing, and a \n26  substantive standard requiring the government to show by clear and convincing \nevidence that no set of release conditions could reasonably assure the detainee’s \n27 \npresence in the event of removal or protect the community from serious danger, taking \n28  into account the length of detention at issue.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 6 of 36   Page ID #:9988\n \n1  those who have been convicted have necessarily finished serving their sentences \n2  before their transfer to immigration   custody. \n3  11.   This Court’s permanent injunction has fundamentally changed the lives of class \n4  members. Since the injunction, all class members receive a hearing before an \n5  immigration judge to determine whether their continued imprisonment is warranted \n6  within 180 to 195 days of their initial incarceration. See Dkt. 425, Order. Based on \n7  government statistics, immigration judges have found that approximately 70% of \n8  class members who receive hearings under the injunction are not a danger or flight \n9  risk warranting detention, and have ordered their release on bond and other \n10  conditions. See Request for Judicial Notice, Exhibit B at 1-2, Rodriguez v. Robbins, \n11  Nos. 13-56706, 13-56755 (9th Cir. Sept. 22, 2014) ECF 24-4. Of these class \n12  members, approximately 70% post bond and have been released. Id.     \n13  12.  Petitioners and all the detainees they represent are held under one of four \n14  general immigration detention statutes that govern the incarceration of most non-\n15  citizens whom the government is trying to remove. See 8 U.S.C. 1225(b) (authorizing \n16  detention of non-citizens seeking admission); 8 U.S.C. 1226(a) (authorizing detention \n17  of non-citizens pending a determination of removability); 8 U.S.C. 1226(c) \n18  (authorizing “mandatory” detention, without hearings, of certain non-citizens who, \n19  inter alia, have been convicted of specified triggering offenses); 8 U.S.C. 1231(a) \n20  (authorizing detention of   non-citizens with final orders of removal during and after \n21  the removal period).   \n22  13.     Prior to the Court’s injunctions, Respondents maintained a policy or general \n23  practice – which Petitioners contend is unlawful – of imprisoning people for \n24  prolonged periods without providing them adequate hearings. Pursuant to this \n25  unlawful policy or general practice, Respondents had incarcerated the Petitioners and \n26  each class member pursuant to one of the statutes described above for more than six \n27  months. Pursuant to Respondents’ policy or general practice, during that time neither \n28  Petitioners nor any other class member had received a hearing where the government \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 7 of 36   Page ID #:9989\n \n1  had to show that their prolonged incarceration remained justified. \n2  14.  Respondents’ general policies and practices of prolonged incarceration without \n3  hearings violate the constitutional rights of the Petitioners and other class members. \n4  To remedy this on-going violation of the law, Petitioners bring this action seeking \n5  declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly-\n6  situated persons. \n7  PARTIES \n8  15.  Petitioner Alejandro Rodriguez is a citizen of Mexico. He was imprisoned for \n9  over three years while litigating his removal case prior to the filing of the original \n10  complaint in this case. He never received a hearing to determine whether his \n11  prolonged imprisonment was justified. He ultimately won his removal proceedings. \n12  16.  Petitioner Abdirizak Aden Farah is a Somali refugee who was incarcerated at \n13  Mira Loma Detention Center for over eight months without a hearing to determine \n14  that his imprisonment was warranted. He received no explanation of any kind as to \n15  why he could not be released pending completion of his removal hearings, despite \n16  having a close family friend in Minnesota willing to house him and no criminal \n17  history of any kind. He eventually gave up, as he was unwilling to bear further \n18  imprisonment, and returned to Somalia.  \n19  17.   Petitioner Yussuf Abdikadir is another Somali refugee who was incarcerated by \n20  ICE for approximately six months without a hearing to determine whether his \n21  imprisonment was warranted. He too has received no explanation of any kind as to \n22  why he could not be released pending completion of his removal proceedings, despite \n23  having a sponsor in San Diego willing to house him and no criminal history of any \n24  kind.  \n25  18.  Petitioner Abel Perez Ruelas is a Mexican national who entered the United \n26  States on a visitor’s visa approximately eight years ago and is now married to a U.S. \n27  citizen. He was incarcerated for at least 16 months pending completion of his \n28  removal proceedings. He received a bond hearing where he bore the burden to prove \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 8 of 36   Page ID #:9990\n \n1  that he was not a danger or flight risk, but the judge denied bond, and later set it at an \n2  amount he could not pay. Although he was plainly eligible to adjust status in removal \n3  proceedings, he remained incarcerated without a hearing before ultimately winning \n4  his immigration case. He ultimately won his removal case.  \n5  19.  Petitioner Jose Farias Cornejo is also a Mexican national, but was a lawful \n6  permanent resident of this country, where he had lived since before his first birthday. \n7  He has been convicted of relatively minor offenses, the most serious of which was \n8  possession of a controlled substance, for which he was sentenced to 180 days in jail. \n9  However, he spent more than twice that amount of time in immigration prison while \n10  awaiting a final decision in his immigration case. Although the government never \n11  disputed his eligibility for cancellation of removal and stated in immigration court \n12  that it did not intend to oppose his application, he remained incarcerated without a \n13  hearing  until he won his case.  \n14  20.   Petitioner Angel Armando Ayala is a citizen of El Salvador who had lived in \n15  the United States since the age of eleven. He had never received a criminal sentence \n16  of longer than 90 days, but was nonetheless incarcerated by immigration authorities \n17  for over 18 months while litigating his removal case. He was never permitted to seek \n18  release on bond before an immigration judge  during that time. He was ultimately \n19  deported.   \n20  21.    Petitioner Alex Cacho Castillo is a citizen of Honduras. He fled that country \n21  due to gang violence and harm he suffered as a member of the Garifuna minority. He \n22  entered the United States without inspection, was apprehended by Border Patrol \n23  officials, passed a credible fear interview, and is now in removal proceedings. He has \n24  been imprisoned for nearly five months in Orange County Jail facilities operated \n25  under contract with ICE. He is currently incarcerated at the Theo Lacy facility. He \n26  has never received a hearing to determine whether his prolonged imprisonment is \n27  justified. He is eligible to receive one under the injunction currently entered in this \n28  case.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 9 of 36   Page ID #:9991\n \n1  22.  Respondent William Barr is the Attorney General of the United States and the \n2  head of the Department of Justice, which encompasses the Board of Immigration \n3  Appeals (“BIA”) and immigration judges as a subunit – the Executive Office of \n4  Immigration Review. Mr. Barr shares responsibility for implementation and \n5  enforcement of the immigration laws along with Respondent McAleenan. Mr. Barr is \n6  a legal custodian of Petitioners. Mr. Barr is sued in his official capacity. \n7  23.  Respondent Kevin McAleenan is the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security \n8  and heads the Department of Homeland Security, the arm of the federal government \n9  responsible for enforcement of immigration laws. Mr. McAleenan is the ultimate \n10  legal custodian of Petitioners. Mr. McAleenan is sued in his official capacity. \n11  24.    Defendant James McHenry is the Director for the Executive Office for \n12  Immigration Review (“EOIR”), which is the federal agency that operates the \n13  immigration courts. Mr. McHenry is responsible for the supervision of the Deputy \n14  Director, the Chairman of the BIA, the Chief Immigration Judge, the Chief \n15  Administrative Hearing Officer, and all agency personnel in the execution of their \n16  duties. Mr. McHenry is sued in his official capacity. \n17  25.  Respondent David Marin is the Field Office Director for the Los Angeles \n18  District of ICE. In his official capacity, Mr. Marin is authorized to release Petitioners \n19  and has legal custody of him. He is sued in his official capacity. \n20  26.   Respondent Don Barnes is the Sheriff of Orange County, and therefore the \n21  officer responsible for the operation of the Theo Lacy Facility and the James A. \n22  Musick Facility in Orange, California. The Theo Lacy Facility and James A. Musick \n23  Facility websites acknowledge that they house immigration detainees.  Sheriff Barnes \n24  is a legal custodian of people detained at that facility, and is sued in his official \n25  capacity.         \n26  27.  Respondent Officer Nguyen is the Officer-in-Charge at the Theo Lacy facility, \n27  and therefore the highest-ranking ICE officer at the facility. He is a legal custodian of \n28  people detained at that facility. Mr. Nguyen is sued in his official capacity. \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 10 of 36   Page ID\n #:9992\n \n1  28.   Respondent Captain Luke South is the commander of the Theo Lacy Facility, \n2  which is, according to its own website, the largest “correctional institution” in Orange \n3  County. Nonetheless, Theo Lacy incarcerates a number of immigration detainees. \n4  Captain South is a legal custodian of people detained at that facility, and is sued in \n5  his official capacity. \n6  29.  Respondent Captain Lisa Von Nordheim manages the operations of the James A. \n7  Musick Facility, another prison in Orange County. According to its website, the \n8  Musick facility incarcerates “pre-trial and sentenced” inmates. Nonetheless, upon \n9  information and belief, it also houses class members, none of whom are criminal \n10  detainees. Ms. Von Nordheim is a legal custodian of people detained at that facility, \n11  and is sued in her official capacity. \n12  30.   Respondent Terry Nelson is the Assistant Field Office Director at the Adelanto \n13  Detention Facility, and therefore the highest-ranking ICE officer at the facility. He is \n14  a legal custodian of people detained at that facility. Mr. Nelson is sued in his official \n15  capacity. \n16  31.   Respondent James Janecka is the Warden of the Adelanto Detention \n17  Facility in Adelanto, California. Warden Janecka is a legal custodian of people \n18  detained at that facility, and is named in his official capacity.3  \n19    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n20  Alejandro Rodriguez \n21  32.  Petitioner Alejandro Rodriguez was imprisoned for over three years while he \n22  challenged the government’s efforts to deport him to Mexico, a country where he has \n23  not lived since he was a baby.  \n24 \n                                           \n25 \n3 The government has taken conflicting positions in detention litigation concerning \n26  who the proper Respondent should be in habeas petitions challenging immigration \ndetention. Petitioners have sued every official who could constitute an appropriate \n27 \nrespondent under the different theories advanced by the government, as well as the \n28  officials who constitute the proper defendants for a complaint under Section 1331.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 11 of 36   Page ID\n #:9993\n \n1  33.  Mr. Rodriguez came to this country in September 1979, when was one year old. \n2  He became a lawful permanent resident on June 4, 1987, when he was nine years \n3  old.4 \n4  34.  On or about July 29, 1998, Mr. Rodriguez pled guilty to Unlawful Driving or \n5  Taking of a Vehicle under section 10851(A) of the California Vehicle Code (CVC). \n6  For this crime he was sentenced to two years. Five years later, on or about October \n7  21, 2003, he pled no contest and was convicted of Possession of a Controlled \n8  Substance under California Health and Safety Code section 11377(A), for which he \n9  received formal probation of 5 years under the conditions of California Prop 36. He \n10  was transferred to DHS custody after his arrest, on April 10, 2004. He was \n11  imprisoned for over three years after that transfer, until the government released him \n12  shortly after the filing of the class certification motion in this case. \n13  35.  The government charged Mr. Rodriguez with being removable based on his \n14  drug offense on April 15, 2004. At his removal hearing, Mr. Rodriguez contested that \n15  his conviction rendered him removable, and argued in the alternative that he was \n16  eligible for relief from removal.5  \n17  36.  The government received a continuance to alter the charging documents in his \n18  case, after which it charged Mr. Rodriguez with being deportable on an additional \n19  ground based on his 1998 conviction for theft. Subsequently, on July 21, 2004, an \n20                                             \n4 Mr. Rodriguez narrowly missed becoming a citizen due to events beyond his control. \n21 \nHe would have gained automatic citizenship, through his father, if his parents had \n22  legally separated prior to his 18th birthday, or if he had been under the age of 18 at the \ntime of the enactment of the Child Citizenship Protection Act of 2000. However, his \n23 \nparents formally separated shortly after he turned 18, and he was 23 by the time the \n24  Act passed. See 8 U.S.C. 1431.  \n5An ICE officer initially deemed him eligible for release on bond, and set the bond at \n25 \n$15,000. However, Mr. Rodriguez was unable to afford the bond in that amount, and \n26  an immigration judge denied his request to lower the bond amount. Shortly after the \nBIA decided his case in 2004, the government revoked that bond order and ordered \n27 \nhim detained without bond under the mandatory detention provision codified at 8 \n28  U.S.C. 1226(c). \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 12 of 36   Page ID\n #:9994\n \n1  immigration judge ordered him removed, holding that both his drug offense and his \n2  theft offense rendered him removable. The Judge held that the drug offense was a \n3  controlled substance offense triggering removal and that the theft conviction was an \n4  aggravated felony, triggering mandatory removal.6 The immigration judge ordered \n5  him deported to Mexico. Mr. Rodriguez appealed that decision to the BIA.  \n6  37.  On December 21, 2004, the Board reversed the Judge’s decision that the drug \n7  possession conviction rendered Mr. Rodriguez removable, but upheld the decision \n8  that his theft conviction was an aggravated felony.  \n9  38.  On December 28, 2004, Mr. Rodriguez timely petitioned for review of the \n10  Board’s decision to the Ninth Circuit, arguing inter alia that his crime was not an \n11  aggravated felony as defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act. Mr. Rodriguez \n12  then sought a stay of removal, which the government opposed. Thereafter, the Ninth \n13  Circuit granted his request for a stay of removal, and therefore necessarily found that \n14  his case presents substantial legal claims. See Maharaj v. Ashcroft, 295 F.3d 963, 966 \n15  (9th Cir. 2002).  \n16  39.  While Mr. Rodriguez’s case was pending at the Ninth Circuit, that court \n17  decided another case holding that Mr. Rodriguez’s theft conviction was not an \n18  aggravated felony. The government then moved to hold his case in abeyance while it \n19  sought en banc review of that decision. The Ninth Circuit granted the motion, even \n20  though he had already been imprisoned for 15 months at that time. After en banc \n21 \n                                           \n22  6Although not charged in the immigration charging document, the government also \npresented evidence from court records that, on or about October 24, 2003, a man using \n23 \nthe name Alejandro Rodriguez (who also used another name as an alias) pled guilty to \n24  California Health and Safety Code section 11550(a), Under the Influence of a \nControlled Substance, and was sentenced to 120 days in jail, which he served during \n25 \nthe same time that Mr. Rodriguez was released and reporting to the court for his \n26  conviction of October 21, 2003. The date of conviction makes it highly unlikely that \nMr. Rodriguez was in fact convicted of this offense. Nonetheless, the IJ ruled that this \n27 \nconviction constituted a second drug offense, rendering Petitioner removable on the \n28  basis of the drug convictions.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 13 of 36   Page ID\n #:9995\n \n1  review failed, the government sought Supreme Court review in the other case, and \n2  again requested that Mr. Rodriguez’s case be held. After the Supreme Court granted \n3  cert, his case was held still further. In the end, his case was held in abeyance for over \n4  two years, but none of the decisions for which it was held established that he was \n5  subject to mandatory removal, as the immigration courts had found.  \n6  40.  Eventually, the government largely conceded that Mr. Rodriguez’s convictions \n7  did not subject him to mandatory removal, and it agreed to remand his case to the \n8  immigration courts on this basis. He ultimately won cancellation of removal, over \n9  seven years after his removal proceedings began.  \n10  41.  During the three years of Mr. Rodriguez’s confinement, the government never \n11  held a hearing as to whether his prolonged incarceration was justified. In fact, the \n12  only process Mr. Rodriguez received with respect to his detention was what the \n13  government calls “File Custody Reviews.” The first of these occurred on March 10, \n14  2005, when an ICE agent presumably read through his file and issued a “Decision to \n15  Continue Detention.” No ICE official interviewed Mr. Rodriguez, let alone held a \n16  hearing, prior to making this decision. Instead, ICE merely gave him a questionnaire \n17  to fill out, asking for information regarding family members, employment \n18  experience, and any outstanding probation requirements. Although Mr. Rodriguez \n19  documented his work as a dental assistant and his extensive family ties, including his \n20  U.S. citizen father and sister, and his lawful permanent resident mother and brother, \n21  ICE denied his request for release, stating simply that he would remain detained until \n22  the Ninth Circuit rendered its decision. The notice offered no further explanation for \n23  the decision to continue incarceration, made no mention of how long Mr. Rodriguez \n24  had been imprisoned (eleven months at that time), and offered no suggestions as to \n25  what steps he might take to effect a different outcome in any future decisions.      \n26  42.  In September 2005, ICE conducted another file custody review, which it \n27  apparently denied for similar reasons, and in March 2006 the process was repeated \n28  again. In each of these instances, the government did not even provide Mr. Rodriguez \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 14 of 36   Page ID\n #:9996\n \n1  with a written decision as to why he would remain incarcerated for many more \n2  months. In March 2007 the government chose to continue Mr. Rodriguez’s \n3  imprisonment yet again. At the time of that last custody decision he had been \n4  incarcerated for nearly three years, yet the decision made no mention of this fact. \n5  Instead, the decision asserted that continued detention was justified because the Ninth \n6  Circuit would decide his case soon, which was incorrect. \n7  43.  Shortly after the original class complaint in this case was filed, the government \n8  released Mr. Rodriguez from confinement, but continued to subject him to severe \n9  restraints on his liberty, including a requirement that he abide by a strict curfew and \n10  wear an electronic monitoring device at all times.  \n11  44.   Over seven years after his removal proceedings began, Mr. Rodriguez won \n12  cancellation of removal and was permitted to retain his lawful permanent resident \n13  status. \n14  Abdirizak Aden Farah \n15  45.  Abdirizak Aden Farah is a Somali refugee who was incarcerated for over eight \n16  months at the Mira Loma facility without any kind of hearing to determine whether \n17  his imprisonment was justified.  \n18  46.   Mr. Farah was born on May 5, 1987 in Kismayo, Somalia. His family lived in \n19  Mogadishu for the early part of his childhood. Thousands of refugees have fled \n20  Somalia since the country’s civil war erupted nearly thirty years ago. Widespread \n21  conflict and human rights violations continue to this day. The United Nations High \n22  Commission for Refugees issued guidelines in May 2010 largely advising against the \n23  return of anyone from central or southern Somalia, including even asylum seekers \n24  whose claims had been rejected. With respect to the capital of Mogadishu (where Mr. \n25  Farah lived prior to suffering persecution), a Human Rights Watch researcher stated \n26  “Mogadishu is one of the world's most dangerous places . . . Returning people there \n27  is not just risky; it's a potential death sentence.”  \n28  47.   Mr. Farah first faced persecution in Somalia as a child, when his family was \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 15 of 36   Page ID\n #:9997\n \n1  forced to flee Mogadishu because they were members of the minority Marehan clan \n2  who faced danger from members of the Hawiye, a powerful majority clan in Somalia. \n3  Eventually, the family was able to settle in Kismayo, a city in Somalia where the \n4  Hawiye were not powerful. Several years later, his father was shot and killed by \n5  members of a Hawiye sub-clan when he returned briefly to Mogadishu to try to sell \n6  the family home.  \n7  48.   Mr. Farah fled Somalia in April 2009 in order to escape the al-Shabaab, a \n8  militant Islamic organization. Al-Shabaab militants shot and killed his brother \n9  Mohamed because he worked as a driver for the Somali Transitional Federal \n10  Government (TFG) in the summer of 2007. These same militants nearly killed Mr. \n11  Farah in the same attack by slashing his wrist with a knife. Afterward, al-Shabaab \n12  members repeatedly accused him of working for the TFG and finally threatened to \n13  kill him if he did not join them. \n14  49.   After the last of these threats, Mr. Farah’s uncle sent money for him to flee. \n15  With the assistance of several people, he arrived by a circuitous route at the southern \n16  border of the United States, where he presented himself at the border and requested \n17  asylum on or about December 31, 2009. An asylum officer found his claim credible, \n18  and referred him for a full asylum hearing before an immigration judge. \n19  50.   Mr. Farah had several hearings in his immigration case, the first of which took \n20  place in March 2010. At several of these, the immigration judge continued his \n21  hearing because he did not have a lawyer, while others were cancelled because the \n22  judge or the translator were not present.  \n23  51.   Mr. Farah applied for release on parole under 8 C.F.R. 212(d)(5)(A). Under \n24  these procedures, release decisions are made by a single officer, with no appeal \n25  process, and without providing a hearing of any kind. An ICE officer denied him \n26  release without meaningful explanation.  \n27  52.   After approximately 15 months of incarceration, Mr. Farah could no longer \n28  bear the hardships of continued imprisonment, including his inability to contact his \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 16 of 36   Page ID\n #:9998\n \n1  wife and child while detained. He decided he could no longer continue with his case, \n2  and was subsequently deported. \n3  Yussuf Abdikadir \n4  53.  Yussuf Abdikadir was also a Somali refugee. He was imprisoned by \n5  immigration authorities in early March 2010, and also never received a detention \n6  hearing of any kind. \n7  54.   Mr. Abdikadir was born on October 5, 1980.7 He lived with his family – \n8  including his parents and five siblings -- as a child in Mogadishu. He is also a \n9  member of a minority clan in Somalia.   \n10  55.  In 1991, as the Somali political structure disintegrated, a militia associated with \n11  a dominant clan, the Hawiye, attacked Mr. Abdikadir’s family. They killed his two \n12  older brothers, his father, and his grandmother. They also severely mistreated other \n13  members of the family, and raped his mother.  \n14  56.   Mr. Abdikadir and his surviving family members then fled to Kenya, where \n15  they lived in various refugee camps for most of the next two decades. He married \n16  Shukri Hussein, also a Somali refugee, while in the camps, and the couple had three \n17  children. (Ms. Hussein also has a son from a prior relationship, who is now Mr. \n18  Abdikadir’s step-son).  \n19  57.   Life in the refugee camps was very hard for Mr. Abdikadir and his family. \n20  Kenya granted them no permanent status, and as a result they were forced to live in \n21  the camps and denied the right to work. At the same time, the Kenyan government \n22  and international agencies failed to provide sufficient food for the refugees. He and \n23  his family would have to wait for hours during the heat of the day to obtain their \n24  small food rations, and often were mistreated by the Kenyan authorities while \n25  waiting. Mr. Abdikadir occasionally worked illegally in order to supplement his \n26  family’s meager provisions, but Kenyan authorities arrested and punished him for \n27 \n                                           \n28  7 Yussuf is his given name, while Abdikadir is his father’s given name. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 17 of 36   Page ID\n #:9999\n \n1  doing so. The Kenyan authorities also did little if anything to stop the bandits who \n2  would raid the camps at night, raping camp residents and pillaging their belongings.  \n3  58.   After life in the camps became too difficult, Mr. Abdikadir’s mother managed \n4  to sell some land the family owned in Somalia, and used these proceeds to procure \n5  funds to allow her son to escape. Unable to return to Somalia or survive further life in \n6  the Kenyan refugee camps, Mr. Abdikadir fled. He traveled a circuitous route in \n7  search of a country with refugee protections, and ultimately arrived at the southern \n8  border of the United States seeking asylum.  \n9  59.   At the border crossing from Tijuana he presented a birth certificate and applied \n10  for asylum, entering ICE detention in March 2010. He was sent to Mira Loma shortly \n11  afterward, and passed his credible fear interview several weeks later, in \n12  approximately April 2010.  \n13  60.  Mr. Abdikadir faced substantial delays that prevented him from even submitting \n14  an application for asylum, including because he was unable to find a lawyer to \n15  represent him and speaks virtually no English.  \n16  61.  Mr. Abdikadir also applied for release on parole under 8 C.F.R. 212(d)(5)(A). \n17  As with Mr. Farah, the decision refusing to release Mr. Abdikadir was made by a \n18  single officer, with no appeal process, and without a hearing of any kind. Mr. \n19  Abdikadir requested release from this officer, and in doing so provided his birth \n20  certificate as well as a sworn affidavit from a friend of his who lives in San Diego \n21  and was willing to house and assist him. Nonetheless, his parole request was denied. \n22  The sole explanation provided was a check mark in a box next to a paragraph which \n23  states “You have not established to ICE’s satisfaction that you will appear as required \n24  for immigration hearings, enforcement appointments, or other matters, if you are \n25  paroled from detention.” Other than requesting a redetermination based on changed \n26  circumstances, Mr. Abdikadir had no recourse to any further process for appeal.  \n27  62.  Mr. Abdikadir suffered during his time in immigration prison, not only because \n28  of the traumatic effects of incarceration in general on those who have suffered past \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 18 of 36   Page ID\n #:10000\n \n1  persecution, but also because of his medical problems. Mr. Abdikadir had some kind \n2  of problem concerning his eyes – perhaps tied to light sensitivity -- that caused them \n3  to be constantly red and irritated. Although he sought medical attention for this \n4  problem at the Mira Loma Detention Center, the clinic there provided him no \n5  medication that addressed the problem.  \n6  63.  Mr. Abdikadir was also unable to communicate with his family while in \n7  immigration prison.  \n8  Abel Perez Ruelas \n9  64.   Abel Perez Ruelas is a citizen of Mexico. He was imprisoned at Mira Loma \n10  Detention Center for more than 17 months, starting on April 8, 2009.  \n11  65.  Mr. Perez Ruelas was born on January 25, 1967 in Jalisco, Mexico. In 1996, he \n12  met Maria del Rosario, with whom he had a daughter, Azirit Lessandra, one year \n13  later. \n14  66.  He was admitted to the United States in 2002 on a visitors’ visa, two years after \n15  he broke up and lost contact with with Ms. del Rosario. \n16  67.  In approximately 2007, about five years after Mr. Perez-Ruelas came to live in \n17  the United States, he received a call from his mother, who told him that Ms. del \n18  Rosario had died in childbirth in Mexico, and that his daughter had been sent to live \n19  with her mother’s parents. Since then, Mr. Perez Ruelas has been living with the hope \n20  that one day he may bring his daughter to the United States to live with him. \n21  68.  On December 22, 2008, Mr. Perez Ruelas married Maria Navichoque Perez, a \n22  U.S. citizen. She is a nurse at the Los Angeles Jewish Home, a non-profit senior \n23  living facility in Reseda, California. The couple filed to adjust his status based on \n24  their marriage in approximately February 2009.  \n25  69.  After his marriage, Mr. Perez Ruelas became the stepfather of Maria Perez’s \n26  four children, all of whom are U.S. citizens by birth.  \n27  70.   Mr. Perez Ruelas lived and worked in the United States for almost eight years \n28  prior to his imprisonment. He worked in construction, primarily with cement and \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 19 of 36   Page ID\n #:10001\n \n1  tiles. Prior to his incarceration, he regularly attended church with his wife in Pacoima \n2  and Reseda. \n3  71.  Mr. Perez Ruelas has had three prior convictions for driving under the influence \n4  of alcohol, none for which he spent more than two months in jail. Mr. Perez Ruelas \n5  served three months of probation for his first offense in 1994; he served 10 days in \n6  jail for his second, a decade later in 2004; and he served 60 days in jail for his third, \n7  which occurred four years later. Pursuant to his sentence for the last conviction, Mr. \n8  Perez Ruelas diligently attended Alcoholics Anonymous for over a year, and \n9  continued attending AA meetings even while in immigration prison. \n10  72.  On or about April 8, 2009, Mr. Perez Ruelas was released from jail for his last \n11  offense. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials immediately took him into \n12  immigration custody, notwithstanding his pending application to adjust his status \n13  based on his marriage. At the time, Mr. Perez-Ruelas was in the process of becoming \n14  a lawful permanent resident of the United States. \n15  73.  Mr. Perez Ruelas was given a bond hearing on April 21, 2009, pursuant to 8 \n16  U.S.C. 1226(a), at which he bore the burden to prove that he was not a danger or \n17  flight risk. Upon information and belief, the immigration judge knew that Mr. Perez \n18  Ruelas was married to a U.S. citizen and that he had a pending adjustment \n19  application, but nonetheless the judge denied him release on bond. He told Mr. Perez \n20  Ruelas that his prior DUI convictions made him a danger to society, even though his \n21  sentence had long since expired.  \n22  74.  With the assistance of his attorney, Mr. Perez Ruelas applied for a bond \n23  reduction in February 2010. At that hearing, the immigration judge set a bond of \n24  $5,000, an amount too high for Mr. Perez Ruelas’s family to pay. \n25  75.  Because he could not pay, Mr. Perez Ruelas remained in immigration prison –\n26  for over 16 months while awaiting adjudication of his case.  \n27  76.  On July 30, 2010, Mr. Perez Ruelas and his wife received notice that their \n28  application to adjust his status had been approved, with a priority date of March 22, \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 20 of 36   Page ID\n #:10002\n \n1  2009. Although he was entitled to adjust status immediately at that time, Defendants \n2  continued to imprison him for no apparent reason. \n3  77.   On December 3, 2010, after approximately 20 months in immigration prison, \n4  Mr. Perez Ruelas’s application to adjust status was granted. He thereby defeated the \n5  government’s charges of removability and was permitted to remain in the United \n6  States.  \n7   Jose Farias Cornejo \n8  78.  Jose Farias Cornejo is a citizen of Mexico. He spent over one year in \n9  immigration prison at Mira Loma Detention Center, starting on September 14, 2009.  \n79.  Mr. Farias Cornejo was born on August 14, 1984 in Michoacan, Mexico. He \n10 \nwas brought to the United States prior to his first birthday by his parents, who were \n11 \nmigrant farm workers. He speaks fluent English.  \n12 \n80.  Mr. Farias Cornejo has four siblings. All four are U.S. citizens. Mr. Farias \n13 \nCornejo’s mother is also a lawful permanent resident of the United States. \n14 \n81.  Mr. Farias Cornejo spent his childhood years in Washington and his \n15 \nadolescence in California because his parents were migrant farm workers. He \n16 \nattended elementary school in San Diego for a few years before moving to Montclair, \n17 \nCalifornia to attend middle school and high school. He took special education classes \n18 \nat Montclair High School because of his diagnosed learning disability. \n19 \n82.  After graduating from high school, Mr. Farias Cornejo worked at various jobs \n20 \nnear his hometown in California, including in construction -- manufacturing jacuzzis \n21 \nand landscaping. \n22 \n83.  Mr. Farias Cornejo had several prior convictions. In 2007, he was convicted of \n23 \npossession of methamphetamine and received substance abuse treatment as an \n24 \nalternative to incarceration under California Proposition 36. Mr. Farias Cornejo \n25 \ndiligently completed his drug treatment classes, but because he could not afford to \n26 \npay the mandatory fine, he was sentenced to 180 days in jail. \n27 \n28  84.  Upon information and belief, in 2009 Mr. Farias Cornejo was convicted of a \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 21 of 36   Page ID\n #:10003\n \n1  misdemeanor California theft offense, for which he spent 14 days in jail. In that same \n2  year, he was convicted of being under the influence of a controlled substance, for \n3  which he spent 60 days in jail.  \n4  85.  Shortly after serving his last sentence, in September 2009, federal immigration \n5  officials initiated removal proceedings against him and placed him in immigration \n6  prison, citing their authority to mandatorily detain any individual with a prior \n7  controlled substance offense under 8 U.S.C. 1226(c). \n8  86.  Although the government contended that Mr. Farias Cornejo was subject to \n9  “mandatory detention” without a bond hearing under that provision, it also \n10  acknowledged that he was eligible for relief from removal in the form of cancellation \n11  of removal under 8 U.S.C. 1229b, because he had not been convicted of an \n12  “aggravated felony.”  \n13  87.  Mr. Farias Cornejo was given a cancellation application on October of 2009, \n14  but struggled to find an attorney to assist him in completing it. After five months in \n15  confinement, he finally found an attorney, but that attorney did not file his \n16  application. Eventually Mr. Farias Cornejo found a different attorney to represent \n17  him, in June of this year. Through his new attorney Mr. Farias Cornejo finally filed \n18  his cancellation application, nearly ten months after he was first placed in \n19  immigration prison. \n20  88.  Upon information and belief, at his cancellation hearing on August 17, 2010, \n21  the government stated that it had no objection to his application. However, the \n22  immigration judge told Mr. Farias Cornejo that he had an outstanding warrant, and \n23  therefore refused to adjudicate the application. Instead, the judge set his next court \n24  hearing for November 15, 2010, apparently on the assumption that his warrant would \n25  be resolved prior to that time. \n26  89.  Mr. Farias Cornejo finally had his hearing in January 2011, at which the IJ \n27  granted him cancellation of removal. He was then released. He never had a hearing to \n28  determine whether his imprisonment remained warranted despite being incarcerated \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 22 of 36   Page ID\n #:10004\n \n1  for over a year.  \n2  Angel Armando Ayala \n3  90.   Angel Armando Ayala is a citizen of El Salvador who was born on August 20, \n4  1976. He came to the United States with his family at the age of eleven. He attended \n5  junior high and high school in Southern California.  \n6  91.   Prior to his arrest by immigration authorities, Mr. Ayala lived with his mother, \n7  Maria, who is a United States citizen, and was also frequently in touch with his \n8  brother and sister, both of whom live in Southern California.   \n9  92.   Mr. Ayala worked in the United States his entire adult life, engaging in a \n10  variety of construction-related jobs including forklift driving, materials handling, \n11  landscaping, and in shipping and receiving.  \n12  93.   Immigration officials arrested Mr. Ayala in what apparently was a worksite raid \n13  in approximately 1994. At that time, government officials imprisoned him at the San \n14  Pedro Detention facility. He eventually had a hearing before an immigration judge \n15  who ordered him released on bond because he was eligible for relief under the \n16  Nicaraguan and Cuban Adjustment Relief Act (“NACARA”). The judge instructed \n17  him to find a lawyer to help him apply. \n18  94.   Shortly afterward, when Mr. Ayala went to the federal immigration building, he \n19  met a man acting as an attorney named Jose Quinones. Mr. Quinones offered to file \n20  Mr. Ayala’s NACARA application for a fee.   \n21  95.   Mr. Quinones eventually filed the application, which was based on Mr. Ayala’s \n22  mother’s eligibility for NACARA.  A hearing on the application was set for October \n23  29, 1999.  \n24  96.   Shortly before the hearing, Mr. Ayala’s mother became seriously ill. Because \n25  he had to take his mother to the hospital and attend to her, Mr. Ayala could not attend \n26  the court hearing. At the hearing, the immigration judge ordered him removed in \n27  absentia, notwithstanding the fact that he was prima facie eligible for NACARA \n28  relief.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 23 of 36   Page ID\n #:10005\n \n1  97.   A few days after the hearing, after his mother’s condition had stabilized, Mr. \n2  Ayala called Mr. Quinones to discuss his immigration case. Mr. Quinones stated that \n3  the case now had to be re-opened, and that he would charge Mr. Ayala several \n4  thousand dollars to do this. When Mr. Ayala stated that he did not have such funds \n5  available, Mr. Quinones told him to contact him when he had saved up the money. \n6  He did not mention that Mr. Ayala had to file the motion within 180 days, as is \n7  required, or that he could be deported if he did not file the motion.  \n8  98.   Several years later, Mr. Quinones was suspended from practicing before the \n9  immigration courts by the Executive Office of Immigration Review. If he ever was a \n10  licensed attorney, he has presumably been disbarred. \n11  99.  Mr. Ayala continued to live and work in the United States for the ensuing \n12  decade. Upon information and belief, he received several misdemeanor convictions \n13  for driving without a license during this time, but was not convicted of any other \n14  offense.  \n15  100.   On February 14, 2009, immigration authorities arrested Mr. Ayala at his home \n16  in Pomona, which he shared with his mother, based on his outstanding removal order \n17  from ten years earlier. They transferred him to the Mira Loma Detention Center.  \n18  101.  With the assistance of non-profit legal service provider Catholic Charities, Mr. \n19  Ayala filed a motion to reopen his case based on ineffective assistance of counsel. \n20  However, the immigration judge denied the motion, and the BIA affirmed the \n21  decision, asserting that the motion was untimely and not subject to tolling based on \n22  ineffective assistance. According to the Board, the attorney had no duty to inform Mr. \n23  Ayala of the filing deadline for the motion to reopen because the attorney never \n24  agreed to represent him with respect to the motion. Thus, the Board declined to \n25  reopen his case, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Ayala was eligible for NACARA \n26 \n27 \n28 \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 24 of 36   Page ID\n #:10006\n \n1  relief.8   \n2  102.  Mr. Ayala subsequently hired attorney Shan Potts, who represented him before \n3  the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit granted Mr. Ayala a stay of removal, but \n4  ultimately denied his petition  , after which Mr. Ayala was removed.  \n5  103.  Mr. Ayala’s incarceration worked a great hardship on his U.S.-citizen mother, \n6  with whom he lived prior to his arrest. She had difficulty paying rent for the \n7  apartment they shared, and also suffered from the absence of his emotional support. \n8   Alex Cacho Castillo \n9  104.  Alex Cacho Castillo is a citizen of Honduras. He has been in ICE custody – \n10  thus far in jails in Orange County – for nearly 5 months, starting on or about January \n11  25, 2019. He is currently incarcerated at the Theo Lacy facility.  \n12  105.  Mr. Cacho Castillo was born on November 17, 2000 in the municipality of \n13  Iriona, department of Colon, in northeastern Honduras. \n14  106.  Mr.  Cacho  Castillo  is  a  member  of  the  Garifuna  minority  in  Honduras. \n15  Although he speaks some Spanish, his best language is Garifuna.  \n16  107.  Mr. Cacho Castillo entered the United States without inspection near Mexicali. \n17  He was apprehended several miles inside the United States on the same day, by \n18  Border Patrol agents.  \n19  108.  An asylum officer conducted a credible fear interview for Mr. Cacho Castillo \n20  on February 11, 2019. According to notes taken by the officer, gang members killed \n21  his father when Mr. Cacho Castillo was about 15 years old. Roughly three years later \n22  they threatened to kill him as well, and he fled for his life. After interviewing Mr. \n23  Cacho Castillo, the asylum officer found him credible and attributed the threats of \n24  violence against him in part to his being the son of his father, and in part to his being \n25  a member of the Garifuna minority.  \n26                                             \n8 Upon information and belief, Mr. Ayala has one misdemeanor conviction for drug \n27 \npossession from approximately 1996 and several convictions for driving without a \n28  license. None of these rendered him ineligible for NACARA. \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 25 of 36   Page ID\n #:10007\n \n1  109.  After he passed the credible fear interview, the government placed Mr. Cacho \n2  Castillo in full removal proceedings by charging him in a Notice to Appear issued on \n3  February 11, 2019. He has since had two hearings in immigration court: a master \n4  calendar hearing on March 5, 2019, and a second one on April 3, 2019, which was \n5  apparently rescheduled because the government failed to provide an interpreter. His \n6  next hearing is set for May 24, 2019.  \n7  110.  Mr. Cacho Castillo’s aunt lives in New York. The government has her name \n8  and contact information. She has stated her willingness to house and support Mr. \n9  Cacho Castillo if he were released.  \n10  111.  Mr. Cacho Castillo has no criminal history of any kind.  \n11  112.  Despite the fact that he has a sponsor willing to support and house him and no \n12  criminal history, ICE has chosen not to release Mr. Cacho Castillo.  \n13  113.  Mr. Cacho Castillo has suffered greatly while incarcerated by Defendants. He is \n14  only slightly over age 18 and has never previously spent any time imprisoned. His \n15  incarceration has caused him severe emotional distress and taken a substantial toll on \n16  his psychological well-being. \n17  CLASS-WIDE ALLEGATIONS \n18  114.  Petitioners were amongst approximately 350 detainees, if not more, in the \n19  Central District on any given day prior to the injunction whom the government \n20  incarcerated for more than six months without proving at an adequate hearing that \n21  their prolonged imprisonment was justified.9 It is the government’s policy or practice \n22  to incarcerate non-citizens under the immigration statutes for prolonged periods of \n23 \n                                           \n24  9 This Court ordered the government to produce a “snapshot” list of all class members \non a particulate date, which the government produced for the date of April 21, 2010. \n25 \nAs of that day, there were 352 class members – people incarcerated in ICE custody in \n26  the Central District who had been in ICE custody for at least 180 days, and whose \ncases remained pending either before the immigration courts or before the federal \n27 \ncourts with a stay of removal in effect.  Subsequent data provided by the government \n28  showed approximately 1,000 such people over the course of a year.   \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 26 of 36   Page ID\n #:10008\n \n1  time pending completion of their removal proceedings without providing them with \n2  such hearings. It would resume that policy and practice in the Central District were \n3  this Court to vacate the permanent injunction.  \n4  115.  Petitioners bring this action on behalf of themselves and all other persons \n5  similarly-situated, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2), or \n6  in the alternative, as a representative habeas action pursuant to a procedure analogous \n7  to that provided in Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2). See Rodriguez I, 591 F.3d at 1126 \n8  (allowing this case to proceed as a class action habeas petition).  \n9  116.  Petitioners represent a class of all people within the Central District of \n10  California who 1) are incarcerated for longer than six months pursuant to the general \n11  immigration detention statutes (i.e., 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), 1226(a), 1226(c), and \n12  1231(a)) while their removal cases (including judicial review) remain pending and \n13  the government lacks authority to effectuate their removal, and 2) have not been \n14  afforded a hearing to determine whether their prolonged imprisonment is justified.   \n15  117.  The class includes people who were present in an ICE detention facility in the \n16  Central District on or after the date on which the original complaint was filed as long \n17  as they had been detained by ICE for more than six months at that time, even if they \n18  are no longer in the Central District  \n19  118.  The class excludes people who have a final order of removal and no stay of that \n20  removal order, such that the government has legal authority to remove them.  \n21  119.  The class excludes juveniles who are held under the care of the Office of \n22  Refugee Resettlement. It also excludes people imprisoned pursuant to a criminal \n23  sentence, including individuals who complete removal proceedings and any judicial \n24  review thereof while serving such sentences.      \n25  120.  Petitioners propose that the Court also certify four sub-classes in this action, \n26  corresponding to the release procedures available to each group.  \n27  a.   Petitioners propose Mr. Farah and Mr. Abdikadir to represent a sub-class of \n28  class members imprisoned after they arrived at a port of entry, requested asylum, and \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 27 of 36   Page ID\n #:10009\n \n1  passed a credible fear interview (the  “Parole” Subclass). They have no mechanism to \n2  obtain their liberty other than through the discretionary parole process. Such \n3  individuals are imprisoned under 8 U.S.C. 1225(b).  \n4  b.   Petitioners propose Mr. Rodriguez, Mr. Perez Ruelas, and Mr. Cacho Castillo to \n5  represent a sub-class of class members imprisoned after being apprehended within \n6  the United States and receiving a bond hearing before an Immigration Judge that did \n7  not provide the procedural protections Petitioners seek (the “Bond Hearing” sub-\n8  class). Such individuals are typically imprisoned under color of 8 U.S.C. 1226(a).  \n9  c.   Petitioners propose Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Farias Cornejo to represent a sub-\n10  class of class members imprisoned without any opportunity for release other than \n11  through the narrow witness protection exception provided in 8 U.S.C. 1226(c) and \n12  the hearing established by Matter of Joseph, 22 I&N Dec. 799 (BIA 1999) (the \n13  “Mandatory” Subclass).   \n14  d.   Petitioners propose Mr. Ayala to represent a sub-class of class members who, \n15  on the government’s view, can be imprisoned without any opportunity for release \n16  other than through the “Post-Order Custody Review” process (the “Post-order” \n17  Subclass). Such individuals are incarcerated under color of 8 U.S.C. 1231(a) and did \n18  not receive bond hearings before Immigration Judges until the Ninth Circuit’s \n19  decision in Diouf v. Napolitano (Diouf II), 634 F.3d 1081 (9th Cir. 2011).  \n20  121.  For each putative sub-class, the number of sub-class members is too large to \n21  make joinder practicable. For each of them, there will likely be more than forty other \n22  sub-class members in this District who, like each of the Petitioners, have been \n23  imprisoned for more than six months and have not been afforded a constitutionally-\n24  adequate hearing to determine whether their prolonged  incarceration is justified. \n25  Petitioners’ counsel conducted a random sampling to assess numerosity in support of \n26  their Motion for Class and Subclass Certification, and at that time each subclass \n27  easily met Rule 23’s numerosity requirements. See Dkt. 101-2, Exhibit 26, Decl. of \n28  Jennifer Stark.   \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 28 of 36   Page ID\n #:10010\n \n1  122.  The proposed class and sub-classes meet the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. \n2  23(a)(2). For the class as a whole, there are several common questions of law and fact \n3  in this case. These include 1) whether the government has a policy or general practice \n4  of imprisoning non-citizens in removal proceedings for longer than six months while \n5  their cases remain pending without providing an adequate hearing to determine \n6  whether such prolonged incarceration is justified, and 2) whether this policy or \n7  practice violates the Constitution. Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1122-24 (finding common \n8  questions).  \n9  123.  There are additional common questions of law that pertain to each subclass. \n10  These include: for the Parole Subclass, whether those subclass members are entitled \n11  to be free from prolonged arbitrary imprisonment under the Fifth or Eighth \n12  Amendments; for the Bond Hearing Subclass, whether the bond hearing they \n13  received comports with the Constitution’s procedural requirements, and in particular \n14  the requirement that the government prove by clear and convincing evidence that no \n15  alternative to detention can satisfy its interests in continued incarceration; for the \n16  Mandatory Subclass, whether the Constitution permits their prolonged imprisonment \n17  without any bond hearing based solely on their prior convictions; and for the Post-\n18  Order Subclass, whether the Constitution permits their imprisonment without a bond \n19  hearing merely because they have a removal order, notwithstanding the fact that the \n20  removal order does not presently confer authority to physically remove them from the \n21  United States.10  \n22  124.  The claims of the named representative Petitioners are typical of the claims of \n23  each proposed sub-class and of the class as a whole. Like all of the proposed class \n24  members, the named Petitioners will have been imprisoned, pursuant to the \n25                                             \n10 The class and subclasses described here are identical in scope to those certified by \n26  this Court in 2011, see Dkt. 161, Order, see also Dkt. 122 at 3, Respondents’ \nResponse to Motion for Class and Subclass Certification (Respondents’ brief \n27  conceding certification appropriate for constitutional as well as statutory claims), \nexcept that the “Parole Subclass” as now defined does not include lawful permanent \n28  residents returning from brief travel abroad. See 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(A). \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 29 of 36   Page ID\n #:10011\n \n1  government’s policy and practice, for at least six months without having been \n2  afforded an adequate hearing where the government has shown that their prolonged \n3  incarceration is warranted. Rodriguez I, 591 F.3d at 1022-24.   \n4  125.  The named Petitioners will fairly and adequately represent the interests of all \n5  members of the proposed class and sub-classes because they seek relief identical to \n6  the relief sought by all class members, and because they have no interests adverse to \n7  other class members. Moreover, the named Petitioners are represented by pro bono \n8  counsel from the ACLU of Southern California, the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights \n9  Project, the Stanford Law School Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, and the law firm of \n10  Sidley Austin LLP. These organizations and the attorneys working for them have \n11  extensive experience litigating on behalf of imprisoned immigrants, including in class \n12  actions. They have ably represented this class for over twelve years.  \n13  126.  Respondents have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class and to \n14  each subclass through their policy and practice of imprisoning non-citizens in \n15  removal proceedings for longer than six months without providing an adequate \n16  hearing where the government has shown that their prolonged incarceration is \n17  justified, making class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief appropriate.   \n18  LEGAL BACKGROUND \n19  127.  Petitioners argue that the government may not imprison them under color of the \n20  immigration laws for longer than six months without showing at an adequate hearing \n21  that their prolonged incarceration is justified. Petitioners make this argument on \n22  constitutional grounds.  \n23  128.  “Freedom from imprisonment -- from government custody, detention, or other \n24  forms of physical restraint -- lies at the heart of the liberty that [the Due Process] \n25  Clause protects.” Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690. For this reason, detention must always \n26  be reasonable in relation to its purpose. Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 \n27  (1972). See also Demore, 538 U.S. at 527-29 (applying “reasonable relation” test).  \n28  129.  In the immigration context, the primary purpose of detention is to effect the \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 30 of 36   Page ID\n #:10012\n \n1  alien’s deportation in the event that removal proceedings are finally concluded in the \n2  government’s favor. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 699 (holding that the “statute’s basic \n3  purpose” is “to assure the alien’s presence at the moment of removal”); Demore, 538 \n4  U.S. at 528 (upholding brief mandatory detention pending completion of removal \n5  proceedings because it “serves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens \n6  from fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings.”). \n7  130.  Because Petitioners and other class members suffer lengthy civil confinement, \n8  they must be afforded rigorous procedures to ensure that their imprisonment remains \n9  justified. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690-92 (noting “serious” constitutional problem with \n10  prolonged and indefinite civil detention unless “limited to specially dangerous \n11  individuals and subject to strong procedural protections”) (emphasis added); Casas-\n12  Castrillon, 535 F.3d at 950 (holding that “prolonged detention without adequate \n13  procedural protections would raise serious constitutional concerns” and therefore that \n14  “due process requires adequate procedural protections to ensure that the government's \n15  asserted justification for physical confinement outweighs the individual’s \n16  constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint.”) (citing Zadvydas). \n17  131.  With respect to what procedures are required for a hearing to be adequate to \n18  justify prolonged incarceration, the government must at a minimum provide advance \n19  notice to the prisoner and then provide a transcribed hearing before an immigration \n20  judge where it bears the burden to show by “clear and convincing” evidence that “no \n21  conditions of release” are sufficient to protect the government’s interests in \n22  preventing flight and danger. See Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U.S. 348, 363 (1996) \n23  (“due process places a heightened burden of proof on the State in civil proceedings in \n24  which the individual interests at stake . . . are both particularly important and more \n25  substantial than mere loss of money.”) (internal quotations omitted); Foucha v. \n26  Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71 (1992) (requiring “clear and convincing evidence” for \n27  commitment of insanity acquittee beyond length of permissible sentence); United \n28  States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 750 (1987) (recognizing that the “no conditions of \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 31 of 36   Page ID\n #:10013\n \n1  release” standard strikes appropriate balance of interests). In addition, the \n2  Immigration Judge must specifically consider the viability of alternatives to \n3  detention, including intensive supervision programs. And the hearing must require a \n4  heightened showing based on the length of confinement at issue. Where a class \n5  member has been incarcerated for a long period of time and proceedings may not end \n6  soon, the government must make more of a showing to justify continued \n7  confinement. United States v. Accetturo, 783 F.2d 382, 388 (3d Cir. 1986) (stating in \n8  pre-trial detention context that “[i]n some cases, the evidence admitted at the initial \n9  detention hearing, evaluated against the background of the duration of pretrial \n10  incarceration and the causes of that duration, may no longer justify detention.”); \n11  Tijani v. Willis, 430 F. 3d 1241, 1242 (9th Cir. 2005) (ordering bond hearing where \n12  government bore burden of proof in part because the “forseeable process [for \n13  resolution of Petitioner’s removal case] in this Court” was “a year of more”). And \n14  where a class member has been imprisoned for an additional six months, due process \n15  requires an additional periodic hearing, because the showing required to incarcerate \n16  someone for six months may not suffice to incarcerate them for six years. Cf. \n17  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701 (“for detention to remain reasonable, as the period of prior \n18  postremoval confinement grows, what counts as the \"reasonably foreseeable future\" \n19  conversely would have to shrink”).11  \n20  132.  Respondents’ prolonged incarceration of Petitioners also violates the Eighth \n21  Amendment. Jurists have long recognized that absolute denial of a bail hearing \n22 \n                                           \n23 \n11 This Court ordered hearings that largely comported with these requirements when it \n24  granted the preliminary injunction in this case. Dkt. 255, aff’d by Rodriguez II, 715 \nF.3d at 1127. See also Order Granting Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Martinez v. \n25 \nGonzales, CV06-7609 (C.D. Cal. January 4, 2007) (ordering government to release \n26  detainee unless “the government shows by clear and convincing evidence that he is a \nsufficient danger or risk of flight to justify his detention in light of how long he has \n27 \nbeen detained already and the likelihood of his case being finally resolved in favor of \n28  the government in the reasonably foreseeable future.”). \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 32 of 36   Page ID\n #:10014\n \n1  violates the right and renders the clause meaningless. See Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 862 \n2  (Breyer, J., dissenting) (“The Eighth Amendment forbids ‘[e]xcessive bail.’ . . . That \n3  rationale applies a fortiori to a refusal to hold any bail hearing at all.”);12 Sellers v. \n4  United States, 89 S. Ct. 36, 38 (1968) (Black, J., in chambers) (“The command of the \n5  Eighth Amendment that ‘Excessive bail shall not be required’ at the very least \n6  obligates judges passing upon the right to bail to deny such relief only for the \n7  strongest of reasons.”); Castañeda v. Souza, 810 F.3d 15, 44 (1st Cir. 2015) (en banc) \n8  (Torruella, J., concurring) (§ 1226(c) detention is “ongoing, institutionalized \n9  infringement of the right to bail”).  \n10  133.  The history of the Excessive Bail Clause confirms that the Bill of Rights \n11  requires a judicial determination regarding bail, and that it applies in deportation \n12  cases. See Caleb Foote, The Coming Constitutional Crisis in Bail: I, 113 U. Pa. L. \n13  Rev. 959, 969 (1965) (An interpretation that Congress may categorically deny access \n14  to bail proceedings “would constitute an anomaly in the American Bill of Rights . . \n15  .”); Kayla Gassman, Unjustified Detention: The Excessive Bail Clause in Removal \n16  Proceedings, American University Criminal Law Brief 4, no. 1 (2009): 35-50 \n17  (concluding that the history of the Excessive Bail Clause renders it applicable to \n18  immigration detention). \n19  134.  Therefore, absent the provision of constitutionally-adequate bond hearings, the \n20  government’s incarceration of Petitioners and other class members violates the \n21  Constitution.   \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n22 \nViolation of Immigration and Nationality Act and Regulations \n23 \n24  135.

Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \n9  contained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n10  138.  Respondents’ continued imprisonment of Petitioners and other class members \n11  without an adequate hearing where the government shows that their prolonged \n12  incarceration remains justified violates the right to be free of prolonged non-criminal \n13  detention without adequate justification and sufficient procedural safeguards, as \n14  guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \n15  Constitution.  \n16  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n17  Violation of Fifth Amendment Due Process  \n18  (Right to Procedural Protections at Custody Hearings)  \n19  139.  Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \n20  contained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n21  140.  Respondents’ continued imprisonment of Petitioners and other class members \n22  without an adequate hearing where the government shows that their prolonged \n23  incarceration remains justified violates the right to be free of prolonged non-criminal \n24  detention without adequate justification and sufficient procedural safeguards, as \n25  guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \n26  Constitution.  \n27                                             \n13 The Supreme Court has rejected this claim as to all but the Post-Order Custody \n28  Review sub-class.

The Due Process Clause requires that Class members imprisoned for longer than \n2  six months receive bond hearings periodically, each six months, where the \n3  government bears the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence, and that \n4  such hearings be recorded for transcription.  \n5  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n6  Violation of Eighth Amendment Right to Bail  \n7  142.  Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \n8  contained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n9  143.  Respondents’ continued imprisonment of Petitioners and other class members \n10  without an adequate hearing where the government shows that their prolonged \n11  incarceration remains justified violates the right to bail as guaranteed by the Eighth \n12  Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \n13    PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n14    WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully request that the Court grant the \n15  following relief: \n16  a.  Assume jurisdiction of this matter and issue declaratory and injunctive relief as \n17  follows: \n18    1.   Certify a class and sub-classes as appropriate under Fed. R. Civ.

Appoint Petitioners’ Counsel as Counsel for the Class and each subclass;  \n22  4.  Order Respondents to provide, after giving notice, individual hearings \n23  before an immigration judge for Petitioners and each member of the \n24  class, at which Respondents will bear the burden to prove by clear and \n25  convincing evidence that no reasonable conditions will ensure the \n26  detainee’s presence in the event of removal and protect the community \n27  from danger, despite the prolonged length of confinement at issue; to \n28  provide such hearings every six months for so long as individuals remain \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 35 of 36   Page ID\n #:10017\n \n1  class members; and to record those hearings for transcription;  \n2  5.  Declare that Respondents’ failure to provide Petitioners and other class \n3  members with adequate hearings violates the Immigration and \n4  Nationality Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and \n5  the Right to Bail under the Eighth Amendment; \n6  6.  Enjoin Respondents from failing to provide Petitioners and each member \n7  of the Class, upon notice, with adequate hearings before an immigration \n8  judge (as specified above in this Prayer);  \n9  7.

Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable. \n13  b.     Alternatively, assume jurisdiction over this matter and issue habeas  \n14  relief, as follows: \n15  1.   Grant the writ of habeas corpus; \n16  2.   Certify a class and sub-classes as appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23 \n17  or other analogous procedures for representative habeas litigation, as defined above;  \n18  3.   Order the release of Petitioners and all class members unless \n19  Respondents provide, after giving notice, individual hearings before an immigration \n20  judge for Petitioners and each member of the class every six months, at which \n21  Respondents will bear the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that no \n22  reasonable conditions will ensure the detainee’s presence in the event of removal \n23  and protect the community from danger, despite the prolonged length of \n24  confinement at issue; and unless those hearings are recorded for transcription; \n25  4.   Grant Petitioners reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and other \n26  disbursements pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. 2412; \n27   \n28   \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 515   Filed 07/11/19   Page 36 of 36   Page ID\n #:10018\n \n1  5.

On April 5, 2010, in light of Rodriguez I, this Court\n2 certified the class as “all non-citizens within the Central District of California who: (1)\n3 Are or were detained for longer than six months pursuant to one of the general\n4 immigration detention statutes pending completion of removal proceedings, including\n5 judicial review; (2) Are not and have not been detained pursuant to a national security\n6 detention statute; and (3) Have not been afforded a hearing to determine whether their\n7 detention is justified.”  \n8 Petitioners, then, sought a preliminary injunction, which this Court granted, and\n9 the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  See Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127 (9th Cir. 2013)\n10 [“Rodriguez II”].  Petitioners, then, moved for summary judgment and sought a\n11 permanent injunction, which this Court granted, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part\n12 and reversed in part.  See Rodriguez v. Robbins, 804 F.3d 1060 (9th Cir. 2015)\n13 [“Rodriguez III”].  The Ninth Circuit held that summary judgment and a permanent\n14 injunction were warranted as to three of Petitioner’s statutory claims and subclasses,\n15 but reversed as to Petitioners’ 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a) claim and subclass.  See Rodriguez\n16 III, 804 F.3d at 1090.  The Ninth Circuit reasoned that the class was certified only as\n17 to those individuals who were detained while waiting for a determination as to their\n18 potential removability, whereas § 1231(a) dealt with those whom the Government had\n19 already deemed removable and were merely waiting to be removed.  Rodriguez III, 804\n20 F.3d at 1085-1086.  The Government sought a writ of certiorari, which was granted. \n21 The Supreme Court reversed Rodriguez III and remanded this case to the Ninth\n22 Circuit to consider whether the class may continue based on Petitioners’ constitutional\n23 claims.  See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830 (2018).  Notably, the issue of\n24 whether Petitioners’ § 1231(a) claim and subclass were properly rejected by the Ninth\n25 Circuit was not appealed by Rodriguez and, therefore, never before the Supreme Court. \n26 The Ninth Circuit remanded the action to this Court for further proceedings.  \n27 Although neither the Supreme Court nor the Ninth Circuit expressly vacated the\n28 permanent injunction, the Supreme Court implicitly did so because it reversed as to the\nOrder – Page 2 of 5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 527   Filed 11/07/19   Page 3 of 5   Page ID #:10083\n1 merits on summary judgment.  See Paige v. State of Cal., 102 F.3d 1035, 1040 (9th\n2 Cir. 1996).  However, the preliminary injunction remains in place.  \n3 On July 11, 2019, Petitioners filed a Fourth Amended Complaint [“FAC”]\n4 which, inter alia: (1) Added a new petitioner, Alex Cacho Castillo, who was detained\n5 at the beginning of 2019, and released by May, 2019; (2) Reasserted a claim under §\n6 1231(a); and (3) Added an Eighth Amendment claim. \n7 Respondents, now, move to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (6). \n8 The party seeking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing that\n9 jurisdiction exists.  Scott v. Breeland, 792 F.2d 925, 927 (9th Cir. 1986).  A complaint\n10 will be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) if, inter alia, there is no case or\n11 controversy.  See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 198 (1962).  \n12 While a complaint need not include detailed factual allegations for each element\n13 of each claim, it must contain enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible\n14 on its face.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 570 (2007).  The Court\n15 must accept all allegations in a complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences\n16 from those allegations.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  A plaintiff\n17 cannot simply restate the elements of her claim, but, rather, must allege enough facts\n18 to allow the Court to draw a reasonable inference that a defendant is liable for the\n19 misconduct alleged.  See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  \n20 Respondents argued that because Cacho Castillo was detained for less than 6\n21 months,  he  cannot  serve  as  a  named  petitioner  or  be  a  member  of  this  class. \n22 Respondents are correct.  Given the class definition, Cacho Castillo was, indeed,\n23 misjoined.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(1).  Petitioners argued that because the Board of\n24 Immigration Appeals opinion that allowed for Cacho Castillo’s release may have been\n25 recently overturned, the Government may, at any time, cause him to be detained,\n26 again.  According to Petitioners, Cacho Castillo “likely would become” a class member\n27 in the near future.  The possibility of future injury is too speculative, here, to make\n28 Cacho Castillo’s claims ripe for adjudication.  See Wolfson v. Brammer, 616 F.3d\nOrder – Page 3 of 5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 527   Filed 11/07/19   Page 4 of 5   Page ID #:10084\n1 1045, 1057 (9th Cir. 2010).   Because Cacho Castillo failed to allege a case or\n2 controversy ripe for adjudication, he must be dismissed.  See Baker, 369 U.S. at 198. \n3 Respondents, further, argued that Petitioners’ are barred from reasserting a\n4 claim, here, under § 1231(a) in light of Rodriguez III and the Supreme Court’s holding\n5 in Jennings.   Indeed, the  Ninth  Circuit  reversed this Court’s grant of summary\n6 judgment on Petitioners’ § 1231(a) claim and held that the § 1231(a) claim and subclass\n7 “does not exist” within this action.  See Rodriguez III, 804 F.3d at 1090.  Nevertheless,\n8 Petitioners argued that the § 1231(a) claim can move forward because the Ninth\n9 Circuit’s decision in Rodriguez III was incorrectly decided because it is inconsistent\n10 with a prior Ninth Circuit case, Diouf v. Napolitano, 634 F.3d 1081, 1091 (9th Cir.\n11 2011).  Petitioners’ argument is misplaced.  If Petitioners thought that the Ninth Circuit\n12 erred in deciding Rodriguez III, they should have petitioned the Ninth Circuit for\n13 reconsideration or a hearing en banc, or sought review from the Supreme Court. \n14 Rodriguez III is the law of the case to the extent that it resolved Petitioners’ § 1231(a)\n15 claim and subclass, and Petitioners cannot reassert their § 1231(a) claim, here, where\n16 Rodriguez III so clearly resolved that claim.  See Rodriguez III, 804 F.2d at 1080.  \n17 Respondents, finally, argued that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over\n18 Petitioners’ newly alleged Eighth Amendment claim because the new claim exceeded\n19 the scope of the Supreme Court’s remand in Jennings.  The Supreme Court’s remand\n20 and its corresponding instructions were addressed to the Ninth Circuit, not to this\n21 Court.  Indeed, this Court is not limited to the scope set forth by the Supreme Court\n22 to the Ninth Circuit, especially when the Ninth Circuit’s subsequent remand to this\n23 Court expressly instructed this Court to consider, inter alia, “any other relevant issue.” \n24\n25 Accordingly, \n26\n27 It is Ordered that the motion to dismiss be, and hereby is, Granted as to\n28 Petitioner Alex Cacho Castillo and Petitioners’ § 1231 claim. \nOrder – Page 4 of 5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB   Document 527   Filed 11/07/19   Page 5 of 5   Page ID #:10085",
