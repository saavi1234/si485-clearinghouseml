Because the parties differ in their interpretations of my ruling, I write now to clarify. Documents that pre-date the implementation of I.O. 23 and are predecisional and deliberative as to I.O. 23 itself, are properly privileged. Documents that relate to the development of training materials, whether they predate or post-date the implementation of I.O. 23, and whether they are in draft or final form, are not privileged. Training materials do not constitute an agency policy or decision for the purposes of the deliberative process privilege. (Signed by Judge Shira A.

Defendants shall make available for deposition an ICO from one of the Police Service Areas that arrested one of the named plaintiffs; the deposition shall be limited to sevenhours, not the one hour that the City suggests; and, given expert report deadlines it shall take place by June 22. The deposition shall not be limited to the topics in the Reports all of the ICOs' duties are appropriate subjects of investigation. The deadlines for the production of expert reports and the submission of summary judgment briefs will not be extended as a result of this Order. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Shira A.

          "description": "OPINION & ORDER: #103248 On March 28, 2013, this Court issued the second part of its ruling on the parties' motions for summary judgment. The March 28 Opinion noted that plaintiffs had offered [a] sample of decline to prosecute forms [DP forms] from various District Attorneys offices in support of \"the conclusion that the City has a persistent and widespread practice of performing unconstitutional trespass stops and arrests in NYCHA buildings.\" Defendant the City of New 2 York argued in a reply brief that the DP forms are inadmissible hearsay. I invited further briefing, which has now been submitted. In Ligon v. City of New York, another case related to the NYPDs stop and frisk practices, I allowed the admission of DP forms describing stops outside TAP buildings as evidence of the NYPDs stop practices. Unlike in this case, however, the City had conceded the admissibility of the records for that limited purpose. I have already ruled in this case that DP forms are admissible for the purpose of showing notice to the City of allegedly unconstitutional practices. Atissue now is plaintiffs request to use the DP forms as evidence in support of their class certification motion.

By October 19, 2018, the parties shall submit a joint proposal for a pilot program, to be overseen by the Monitor, to study requiring patrol officers to activate BWCs during Level 1 encounters under De Bour. The proposal shall consider social science best practices. In developing the proposal, the parties shall consult with experts and the Monitor. After consulting with the parties or their experts, the Monitor shall also consider whether it is feasible to integrate this pilot program into the BWC Pilot, or whether it must be conducted separately. 2. The proposal shall include: a. A timeline for the planning, implementation, and analysis of the data gathered during the implementation of the program; b. A plan for monitoring the program during the implementation stage; c. A plan for assessing whether requiring activation of BWCs during Level 1 encounters enhances the NYPD's ability to capture on BWCs encounters that escalate to Level 2 or Level 3; and d. A plan for considering the privacy implications and effect on police-community relations of activating BWCs during Level 1 encounters. 3. After consulting the parties, the Monitor shall report the study's findings to the Court. The City shall bear the cost of the pilot program.

          "description": "OPINION & ORDER: #103248 On March 28, 2013, this Court issued the second part of its ruling on the parties' motions for summary judgment. The March 28 Opinion noted that plaintiffs had offered [a] sample of decline to prosecute forms [DP forms] from various District Attorneys offices in support of \"the conclusion that the City has a persistent and widespread practice of performing unconstitutional trespass stops and arrests in NYCHA buildings.\" Defendant the City of New 2 York argued in a reply brief that the DP forms are inadmissible hearsay. I invited further briefing, which has now been submitted. In Ligon v. City of New York, another case related to the NYPDs stop and frisk practices, I allowed the admission of DP forms describing stops outside TAP buildings as evidence of the NYPDs stop practices. Unlike in this case, however, the City had conceded the admissibility of the records for that limited purpose. I have already ruled in this case that DP forms are admissible for the purpose of showing notice to the City of allegedly unconstitutional practices. Atissue now is plaintiffs request to use the DP forms as evidence in support of their class certification motion. For the reasons set forth below, the DP forms are admissible subject to the limitations described below. For the foregoing reasons, the DP forms are admissible as evidence of the NYPDs trespass enforcement practices in and around NYCHA buildings. Pursuant to the Citys request, plaintiffs are ordered to identify the specific DP forms summarized in plaintiffs submission. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Shira A. Scheindlin on 5/24/2013) (rsh) Modified on 6/7/2013 (jab). (Entered: 05/24/2013)"

By October 19, 2018, the parties shall submit a joint proposal for a pilot program, to be overseen by the Monitor, to study requiring patrol officers to activate BWCs during Level 1 encounters under De Bour. The proposal shall consider social science best practices. In developing the proposal, the parties shall consult with experts and the Monitor. After consulting with the parties or their experts, the Monitor shall also consider whether it is feasible to integrate this pilot program into the BWC Pilot, or whether it must be conducted separately. 2. The proposal shall include: a. A timeline for the planning, implementation, and analysis of the data gathered during the implementation of the program; b. A plan for monitoring the program during the implementation stage; c. A plan for assessing whether requiring activation of BWCs during Level 1 encounters enhances the NYPD's ability to capture on BWCs encounters that escalate to Level 2 or Level 3; and d. A plan for considering the privacy implications and effect on police-community relations of activating BWCs during Level 1 encounters. 3. After consulting the parties, the Monitor shall report the study's findings to the Court. The City shall bear the cost of the pilot program.

Because the parties differ in their interpretations of my ruling, I write now to clarify. Documents that pre-date the implementation of I.O. 23 and are predecisional and deliberative as to I.O. 23 itself, are properly privileged. Documents that relate to the development of training materials, whether they predate or post-date the implementation of I.O. 23, and whether they are in draft or final form, are not privileged. Training materials do not constitute an agency policy or decision for the purposes of the deliberative process privilege. (Signed by Judge Shira A.

ENDORSEMENT: On November 11, 2021, the Court, through Deputy Monitor Richard Jerome, invited both sides to participate in the monitor selection process by proposing, by November 24, 2021, three candidates each to succeed the late Peter Zimroth. Plaintiffs have thus far declined to do so.

Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 29 F.3d 40, 44 (2d Cir. 1994) (per curiam). Nor shall the Court adopt, midstream, a selection process that will delay the monitorship's ongoing work.

    "summary": "<p>This is one of four ongoing cases challenging the constitutionality of the New York Police Department's \"Stop and Frisk\" program. See: <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floyd v. City of New York</a>; <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daniels v. City of New York</a>; and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12496\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ligon v. City of New York</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On January 28, 2010, the plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the City of New York and the New York City Housing Authority. The plaintiffs included Black and Latino New York City Housing Authority tenants and their guests who were arrested while visiting. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, the Legal Aid Society, and the NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory damages and attorney's fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs brought their claim under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1981, alleging violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000(d); the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 3601 et seq.; the United States Housing Act, 42, U.S.C. &sect; 1437, et seq.; the Constitution and laws of the state of New York; and the New York City Human Rights Law.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the City of New York and the New York City Housing Authority (\"NYCHA\"), through the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\"), maintained an unlawful patrol and trespass arrest policy that resulted in a pattern and practice of illegal stops, seizures, questioning, searches, and false arrests of residents of, and authorized visitors to, NYCHA residences. The NYPD conducted vertical patrols, which are top-to-bottom walk-through patrols or \"sweeps\" of hallways, stairwells, rooftops and landings, elevators, and other common areas of a NYCHA residence. The complaint alleged that the police stopped and questioned residents and their visitors without objective individualized suspicion of crime and unlawfully arrested them for trespass without probable cause. The plaintiffs further alleged that the trespass laws were being enforced in and around NYCHA residences on the basis of race, ethnicity, and/or national origin in an intentionally discriminatory manner, because the patrols focused on NYCHA residences, who were predominantly African American and Latino.</p>\r\n<p>According to the complaint, at least one resident of the building was arrested for \"trespass\" (although charges against him were never prosecuted). Numerous plaintiffs who were arrested for trespass while visiting building residents suffered negative employment effects due to their arrest and detention, including missed job interviews, suspension or limitation of employment, or full termination.</p>\r\n<p>Nine of the original eighteen plaintiffs accepted offers for settlement. (Four accepted on October 4, 2010 and five accepted on December 20, 2010).</p>\r\n<p>On May 4, 2011, the Court (Judge Shira A. Scheindlin) issued an order compelling the city to provide documents for discovery. The Court ordered the City to produce documents characterized as \"drafts of the training curriculum/training scenarios\" and as \"deliberations about substantiated CCRB complaints concerning the legality of stops and arrests on NYCHA properties,\" and to submit a more detailed privilege log with respect to other documents.</p>\r\n<p>On July 5, 2011, the Judge Scheindlin denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. 812 F. Supp. 2d 333. On October 17, 2011, Judge Scheindlin awarded attorneys' fees and costs to those plaintiffs who had accepted settlement offers.</p>\r\n<p>Discovery battles ensued, and, in several opinions, Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman further compelled production of documents and Judge Scheindlin compelled the appearance of an Integrity Control Officer for deposition.</p>\r\n<p>On October 4, 2012, Judge Scheindlin granted in part and denied in part defendants' motions for summary judgment. This opinion adjudicated only the individual circumstances of plaintiffs' arrests and tenancies; it did not adjudicate defendants' practices and policies. The Court did not rule definitively on the Equal Protection claims against the City, the Title VI claims, the Fair Housing Act claims, the state and city law claims against NYCHA, nor the United States Housing Act claim against NYCHA because those issues required further briefing. The Court granted summary judgment in favor of NYCHA regarding the equal protection claims (because plaintiffs did not show that NYCHA was liable for the arrests), to the City on state and city human rights law violations, and to defendants on the substantive due process claims (because the Court found them duplicative). The court denied summary judgment on &sect; 1981 claims regarding two plaintiffs and denied summary judgment on plaintiff's request for injunctive relief.</p>\r\n<p>On March 28, 2013, Judge Scheindlin granted in part and denied in part defendants' motions for summary judgement. This opinion granted NYCHA's motion for summary judgement on all remaining NYSC claims as well as granting summary judgement on the remaining race discrimination claims. The Court denied summary judgment on section 1981, FHA, Fourth Amendment, Equal Protection, and USHA claims. 959 F.Supp.2d 324.</p>\r\n<p>On August 29, 2013, Judge Scheindlin certified the \"Stopped Class\" and \"Resident Class\" under Rule 23(b)(2). 2013 WL 4712501. The parties entered into settlement talks. After two years, the parties finally reached a settlement agreement in January 2015. The NYPD agreed to revise their Patrol Guide on vertical (or interior) patrols in NYC public housing and the related NYPD training materials regarding vertical patrols and enforcement of NYCHA rules. The settlement also imposed a documentation requirement for all trespass arrests in NYC public housing, and modified certain NYCHA rules concerning residents&rsquo; cooperation with police and the prohibited activity of &ldquo;lingering.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Upon final court approval, the Davis case would become part of the court monitoring process that was ordered in the lawsuit that successfully challenged the NYPD&rsquo;s stop-and-frisk policies (<em>Floyd v. City of New York</em>). This settlement would be overseen by the monitor as the one in <em>Floyd</em> and <em>Ligon</em>.</p>\r\n<p>On April 28, 2015, the court approved the settlement and retained jurisdiction of the case to enforce the settlement. On this day, the case was also transferred to Judge Torres, who was in charge of the other stop-and-frisk cases. see <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floyd v. City of New York</a> for the implementation and monitoring proceedings of the settlement agreements.</p>\r\n<p>On August 1, 2019, The parties filed a proposed stipulation and order to incorporate new terms into the settlement. According to the stipulation and order, issued by Judge Torres that same day, the new terms included, \"the duties of the Monitor and the Joint Remedial Process, for the purpose of enforcing the Stipulation of Settlement and Order as it pertains to reforms to the NYPD's practices that relate to trespass enforcement in or around NYCHA residences, including training, supervision, monitoring, and discipline of officers.\"</p>\r\n<p>On May 26, 2020, the Davis, Floyd, and Ligon plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for relief, alleging that the NYPD's discriminatory social-distancing enforcement practices in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City violated the court's orders, the NYPD&rsquo;s Court-approved racial profiling policy, and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. In their brief, the plaintiffs cited a statistical analysis prepared by The Legal Aid Society showing that the police executed the the majority of arrests in predominantly Black and Latinx precincts, despite those precincts accounting for less than half of the social distancing complaints. Judge Torres denied the emergency motion on July 8. 2020 WL 3819566. She found that the COVID claims alleged by the plaintiffs did not \"fall squarely within the scope of the policies and practices adjudicated in this litigation.\" Further, Judge Torres noted that the plaintiffs' requested blanket injunction would interfere with lawful police enforcement.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.: \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs bring suit, on bthalf of themselves and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals, against the City of New York (the \"City\") and the New York \nCity Housing Authority (\"NYCHA\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"), asserting a \ncontinuing violation of their rights pursuant to 42 U.S.c. § 1983,42 U.S.c. § 1981, \nthe Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Title VI \n1 \n\n\nofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964,1 Title VIII ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1968 (''Fair \nHousing Act\")/ the United States Housing Act,3 the Constitution and laws ofthe \nState ofNew York, and the New York City Human Rights Law (\"NYCHRL,,).4 \nPlaintiffs have sought the production ofcertain documents, which the \nCity has refused to produce, asserting that those documents are protected by the \ndeliberative process privilege.  For the reasons stated below, the City is ordered to \nproduce some ofthe documents, and to submit a more detailed privilege log with \nrespect to certain other documents. \nII.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs allege that defendants, \"operating through and in \nconjunction with the New York City Police Department (''NYPD''), have \nimplemented and continue to conduct, enforce and sanction an unlawful vertical \npatrol and trespass arrest policy which has resulted in a pattern and practice of \nillegal stops, seizures, questioning, searches, and false arrests ofresidents of, and \nauthorized visitors to, NYCHA residences.\"s  At the time this suit was instituted, \n42 U.S.C. § 2000(d). \n2  Id.  § 3601, et seq. \n3  Id. § 1437, et seq. \n4  N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-101, et seq. \nS  Complaint (\"Comp!.\") ~ 2. \n2 \n\nthe NYPD policy at issue was reflected, in part, in section 212-60 of the NYPD \nPatrol Guide (\"P.G. 212-60\"), entitled \"Interior Vertical Patrol of Housing \nAuthority Bui1dings.,i) \nIn response to complaints to the Civilian Complaint Review Board \n(\"CCRB\") about the legality of stops and arrests in NYCHA buildings and similar \nconcerns raised by NYCHA representatives and tenant leaders, the NYPD \nleadership decided to \"provid[e] additional guidance to police officers patrolling \nNYCHA properties.,,7  In the fall of2009, NYPD Police Commissioner Raymond \nKelly delegated to S. Andrew Schaffer, NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Legal \nMatters, the task of revising P.G. 212-60 in amsultation with high-ranking NYPD \ns \npersonnel and attorneys from the New York City Corporation Counse1. On July 8, \n2010, P.G. 212-60 was replaced by Interim Order number 23 (\"1.0. 23\").9 \nAlthough 1.0.23 contains much of the same information as its predecessor, it \n6  Id. ~ 3.

Andrew Schaffer, NYPD Deputy \nCommissioner for Legal Matters (\"Schaffer Dec1.\"), attached to City Letter ~ 4. \n8  See id. ,-r,-r 3, 5; City Letter at 1-2. \n9  See Schaffer Dec1. ~~ 3, 8; City Letter at 2; 1.0. 23, dated 6/8/1 0, Ex. \nC to City Letter. \n3 \n\n\ndiffers in that it \"discusses in enhanced detail when 'a uniformed member ofthe \nservice may approach and question persons who may be violating Housing \nAuthority rules and regulations, including potentially unauthorized persons found \nin Housing Authority buildings. \n\",10 \n1.0.23 was issued after the commencement of this suit, but plaintiffs \nassert that their claims \"challenge[] generally Defendants' overall vertical patrol \npolicies and trespass enforcement practices, including LO. 23.,,11  Plaintiffs have \naccordingly demanded that the City produce, as part ofits discovery obligations, \n\"any drafts, correspondence or memoranda concerning the development and \nimplementation ofInterim Order 23\" and \"any drafts, correspondence or \nmemoranda concerning the development and implementation of the corresponding \ntraining curriculum, as well as all revisions to the curriculum.\" \n12 \nThe City has withheld four categories ofdocuments, which it asserts \n10  Schaeffer Decl. ~ 11 (quoting 1.0. 23 ~3). \n3/29111 Letter Briefby plaintiffs (''PI. Letter\") at 7.  The City contests \n11 \nplaintiffs' position, arguing, H[a]s the Interim Order literally did not exist on the \ndate the complaint was filed, it could not have been the subject ofplaintiffs' \nclaims.\"  City Letter at 6 n.3.  However, the City is splitting hairs.  Plaintiffs \nclearly mean that they seek to challenge defendants' overall vertical patrol policies \nand trespass enforcement practices.  Plaintiffs' position is that those policies have \nbeen and remain discriminatory, regardless ofwhether they are manifested in P.O. \n212-60, LO. 23, or any other policy document. \n12  See City Letter at 1. \n4 \n\n\nall relate to the revision of P.G. 212-60: '0) legal memoranda and NYPD Legal \nBureau analysis ofvertical patrols in NYCHA developments; (2) correspondence \nand draft revisions to P[. ]G[.] 212-60; (3) drafts ofthe training curriculum/training \nscenarios concerning revised P[.]G[.] 212-60; (4) and deliberations about \nsubstantiated CCRB complaints concerning the legality of stops and arrests on \nNYCHA properties.\"13  The City claims that these documents are predecisional and \ndeliberative and as such, their release would \"inaccurately reflect the basis for final \nagency policy and chill the candor ofNYPD officials in the future.,,14  In support of \nits assertions ofprivilege, the City has submitted a declaration from S.

The City's privilege logs also reflect assertions of the \n14 \nattorney-client and attorney work product privileges.

However, in revising its privilege logs in accordance with this \nOpinion and Order, the City is also ordered to review its assertions ofthose two \nprivileges and ensure that its assertions are proper. \nSee Schaffer Decl.; 2/25111 City's Privilege Log (\"2/25 Log\"), Ex.

DISCUSSION \nAs a preliminary matter, I find that Deputy Commissioner Schaffer is \na proper party to assert the deliberative process privilege on behalf ofthe NYPD. \nAlthough plaintiffs correctly point out that the City has failed to establish explicitly \nthat Schaffer has been delegated the authority to assert the privilege in accordance \nwith agency guidelines, it is evident from the City's submissions that Schaffer is a \nsubordinate ofhigh authority who was delegated the task ofrevising P.G. 212-60.34 \nThus Schaffer is in the best position to assess the NYPD's need for deliberative \nconfidentiality surrounding theP.G. 212-60 revision, whether or not he was \n3!

Sufficiency of Privilege Logs \nOn the whole, the privilege logs submitted by the City are \ninsufficiently detailed to allow the Court to assess the legitimacy and scope of its \nassertion of the deliberative process privilege.  The City's privilege logs include \nthe headings \"Start Bates,\"  \"End Bates,\"  \"Author,\"  \"Recipient,\"  \"Document Date,\" \n\"Subject,\" and \"Privilege.\"  There is nothing improper, in principle, with a \nprivilege log that utilizes these categories, which are fairly standard.  However, \nthere are two major deficiencies in the City's logs that renders them inadequate. \nFirst, one or more columns is marked \"NIA\" for a significant number \nof entries.  Second, the City too often employs vague, confusing, or conclusory \ndescriptions in the \"Subject\" column.  The use of \"NIA\" may in certain \ncircumstances be appropriate.  I understand, for example, that the \"Recipient\" \ncolumn might not apply where a document was distributed broadly, or not \ndistributed at all; that it might not be possible to complete the \"Author\" column \nwhen the document was unattributed and unsigned; or that the \"Document Date\" \ncolumn might be left blank when a document was left undated.  However, a \nCf Resolution Trust OJrp., 137 F.RD. at 641 (finding \"that the \n35 \ndecision to assert the privilege was made not by agency policymakers in \nconsideration of the agency's interest in deliberative confidentiality, but by its \noutside counsel as a matter oflitigation strategy\"). \n10 \n\n\nmissing date, recipient, and/or author, combined with a vague description ofthe \nsubject matter of the document, leaves the Court unable to assess whether a given \ndocument is an inter- or intra-agency document, and whether it is deliberative \nand/or predecisional.  In a few instances, the City has even left the \"Privilege\" \ncolumn blank, leaving the Court in the dark as to which, ifany, privilege is being \n36 \nasserted.\nGiven the volume of documents that the City is seeking to withhold, I \nwill not specifically address each and every entry in the logs.  Instead, I mention a \nfew illustrative examples, and instruct the City to apply the principles I set forth \nhere in revising its logs.  The very first entry in the 2/25 Log lists a one-page \ndocument, authored by \"NYPD Counsel,\" with no recipient, no document date, and \nthe subject description \"Comm Zoland Housing Verticals Patrols Folder - Deborah \nZoland.\"37  While that form of shorthand may be comprehensible to NYPD \npersonnel, I cannot decipher such language in order to determine whether the \nprivilege applies. \nAnother series ofdocuments, also lacking recipients or dates, are \nSee Priv00130l-PrivOOl308 (which is dated 9/27110 but ha-; \"N/A\" \n36 \nfor author, recipient, and subject, while privilege is left blank); Priv000135­\nPrivOOO138. \n37 \n11 \n\n\ndescribed as \"Third Endorsement - IDC # 064-299-0479,\"38 followed by \"Second \nEndorsement - IDC # 064-299-0479,\"39 and \"First Endorsernent.\"40  Without any \ninfoffilation as to what \"IDC # 064-299-0479\" is, the Court is left to speculate as to \nwhat exactly has been endorsed.  Yet another document lacks an author, a \nrecipient, or a document date, and its subject matter is described in the vaguest of \nterms as \"Patrol Guide - NYCHA Bldgs.,,41  That description in no way satisfies \nthe City's burden to establish that the deliberative process privilege should apply. \nAnother document lacking an author or recipient, and dated September 15, 2010, \nafter the issuance of 1.0. 23, is described merely as \"Five Changes.\"42  Based on \nthat two-word description, I cannot evaluate whether the five changes were \nproposed or enacted, by whom, to what, or anything else that would help determine \nwhether the document is predecisional or deliberative.  In view of opaque \n\"descriptions\" such as these, it is perhaps worth reminding the City that the \npurpose of a privilege log is to enable the opposing party and the Court to test the \nasserted privilege.  The paltry descriptions provided by the City prevent either \n38 \nPriv_  Paper_  0000064. \n39 \nPriv_  Paper_  0000065. \n40 \nPriv_ Paper_ 0000066. \n41 \nPriv_  Paper_  0000540. \n42 \nPriv_Paper_0000552. \n12 \n\n\n43 \nplaintiffs or the Court from performing any such test.\nFurthennore, it is difficult for the Court to believe that every single \none ofthe several hundred documents included in the City's two privilege logs are \nproperly privileged in their entirety.  The law is clear that the privilege does not \nprotect \"purely factual material.,,44  Thus any factual recitations that can be \ndisentangled from deliberative analyses must be released.  It does not appear that \nthe City has attempted to make any such distinction.  The City is therefore ordered \nto release those portions of the requested documents that are factual and can be \nseparated from the deliberative portions of the documents. \nCertain entries in the log reflect a blatant abuse of the assertion of \nprivilege.  A prime example is a document authored by John B. Rhea, the \nChairman ofNYCHA, to Raymond Kelly, NYPD Chief, dated December 23, 2009. \n43  To provide some additional guidance to the City, I will identify a few \nofthe entries that I do consider sufficiently detailed and covered by the \ndeliberative process privilege: Priv_  Paper_  0000554-0000557 (\"Draft Interim \nOrder - Revision of Patrol Guide 212-60 Interior Vertical Patrol of Housing \nAuthority Buildings - Number Draft 1\" ); Priv_  Paper  0000562-0000563 (,'Latest \nRevision to P.G. 212-60 Intcrior Vertical Patrol ofHousing AuthorityBuildings\"); \nPriv  Paper_00006l3 (''Proposed Language to Add to Patrol Guide Procedure No \n212-60 (Interior Vertical Patrol of Housing Authority Buildings) under Additional \nData\"). \nGrand Cent. P'ship, 166 F.3d at 482.  Accord Jackson v.  City ofNew \n44 \nYork, No. 05 Civ. 721, 2006 WL 2789990, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27,2006) \n(\"[s]egregab1e factual material is not covered by the privilege\" (citation omitted)). \n13 \n\n\nThe subject is described as \"[Discussions are Essential to Further Mutual Goal of \nProviding for Safe and Comfortable Housing Environ~nt for NYCHA \nResidents].\"  The City asserts that this document is protected from disclosure by \nthe attorney-client and deliberative process privileges.45  Based on this information \nalone, it is obvious that this document cannot be an attorney-client communication, \nas it does not involve communications between an attorney and his client, but \nrather between the heads oftwo City agencies.  Additionally, the subject \ndescription fails to make clear whether and in what way the document is, in whole \nor in part, predecisional or deliberative.  Thus while I do not rule here on the \napplicability of the attorney-client or attorney work product privileges as they have \nnot been briefed, the City is cautioned to reassess its assertion of all privileges \ncarefully prior to resubmitting the logs.  If a random in camera review of a selected \ngroup ofdocuments on the privilege logs reveals that the assertion ofprivilege was \nbaseless, the Court will not hesitate to find that the City has waived any claim of \nprivilege with regard to the remainder of the documents. \nB.  Category One and Category Two \nAny documents that properly fall into Category One  to the extent \nthat such documents pertain to the revisions of P.G. 212-60 - or into Category Two \n45 \n14 \n\n\nare most likely privileged.  However, the City has failed to provide adequate \ninformation about each document for the Court to ascertain whether the documents \nso described properly fall within those categories.  Additionally, to the extent that \ndocuments in Category One do not relate to the revisions ofP.G. 212-60, but raher \nconstitute analysis ofNYPD's past policy and practice of vertical patrols in \nNYCHA developments, they cannot be considered predecisional.  Therefore the \nCity is ordered to revise its privilege logs with more detailed information about \nwhat is actually contained in the documents subsumed under Category One and \nCategory Two so that plaintiffs and the Court can assess the propriety ofthe \nassertions ofprivilege.  Not every entry must be revised; however, a significant \nportion likely will, in accordance with the principles laid out above. \nC.  Category Three \nIn its letter brief, the City argues that all of the documents it seeks to \nwithhold are predecisional with respect to the development of the policy ultimately \ncrystallized in 1.0.23.46  However, that cannot be the case with the documents in \nCategory Three, characterized as \"drafts of the training curriculum/training \nscenarios concerning revised P.G. 212-60,\" or Category Four, characterized as \n\"deliberations about substantiated CCRB complaints concerning the legality of \n46  City Letter at 1, 7. \n15 \n\nstops and arrests on NYCHA properties.,,47  The City apparently believes that by \nusing the word \"draft\" or \"deliberations,\" the privilege automatically attaches.  The \nCity is mistaken.  A draft may be covered by the privilege, to the extent that it \n\"reflects the personal opinions of the writer rather than the policy of the agency.,,48 \nHowever, the fact that something is a draft does not eliminate the City's obligation \n49 \nto specify the particular policy or decision to which the document relates.\nFurthermore, the City fails to include information about the draft documents \"such \nas their 'function and significance in the agency's decisionmaking process,,,,50 \nwhich is necessary to justify the assertion ofthe deliberative process privilege. \nTo the extent that the City acknowledges that the documents in \nCategory Three are \"drafts ofthe training curriculumltraining scenarios concerning \nrevised P.G. 212-60,\"51 such drafts were necessarily developed after the \ncompletion ofthe P. G. 212-60 revision.  It seems unlikely that the NYPD would \n47 \n[d. at 3-4. \n\n48 \n\nTigue, 312 F.3d at 80. \nSee New York Times Co. v.  United States Dep 't ofDe!, 499 F.

Thus such documents were certainly not predecisional with respect \nto revisions ofP.G. 212-60, and the City acknowledges as much in its reply. \nRather, the City argues that the draft training curriculum are predecisional because \n\"(1) they precede, in temporal sequence, the final training curriculum; and (2) they \nreflect proposals, suggestions and recommendations on how to 'provide [] \nadditional guidance to police officers patrolling NYCHA properties. \",52 \nThe City's arguments are premised on the idea that a training \ncurriculum and other \"guidance\" documents constitute an agency policy or \ndecision.  The law is clear that \"[t]he privilege ... does not extend to materials \nrelated to the explanation, interpretation or application of an existing policy.\"53 \nHowever, whether training materials can be considered a policy or decision in the \ncontext ofthe deliberative process privilege is an issue of first impression.  Not \nevery minor question that is contemplated by an agency or employee thereof, and \nthe way that question is answered, can be considered an agency policy or decision. \n\"'The [p]rivilege is properly limited to communications relating to policy \nformulation at the higher levels of government; it does not operate indiscriminately \n52  City Reply at 5 (quoting unknown source). \nResolution Trust Corp., 137 F.RD. at 641 (quoting Mobil Oil Chrp., \n53 \n102 F.R.D. at 5). \n17 \n\nto shield all decision-making by public officials. \n\",54 \nDocuments written to train officers in the implementation of1.0. 23 \ndo not constitute a policy, but rather are materials intended to explain an existing \npolicy - 1.0. 23.  While high-ranking NYPD officers were involved in designing \nthe training curriculum, their involvement is not enough to transform their \nexplanations of the policy into the equivalent of a policy or decision.55  Thus \nCategory Three documents are not covered by the deliberative process privilege, as \nthey are not predecisional to an agency policy.  It may be that certain of the \ndocuments are covered by the attorney-client privilege or constitute attorney work \nproduct.  If so, the City should designate them as such, providing sufficient detail \nto analyze the assertion of those privileges. \n56 \nVelez v.

Dec. 3, 1992). \n55  See Schaeffer Dec!. ~~ 5, 6. \nIn view of footnote 2 in the City's Reply, which misconstrues \n56 \nplaintiffs' argument about attorney-client privilege as an argument about attorney \nwork product, the City is reminded that attorney work product only pertains to \ndocuments prepared in anticipation for litigation, although the definition of \nattorney-client privilege is significantly broader.  Compare New York Times Co., \n499 F. Supp. 2d at 517 (\"The attorney work product privilege protects the files and \nthe mental impressions of an attorney ... prepared in anticipation of litigation.\") \n(quotation marks and citation omitted), and In re County ofErie, 473 F.3d 4l3, \n18 \n\nD.  Category Four \nThe documents that fall into Category Four - \"deliberations about \nsubstantiated CCRB complaints concerning the legality of stops and arrests on \nNYCHA properties,,57 - are clearly not covered by the deliberative process \nprivilege.  Again, the City believes that by using the word \"deliberation,\" it has \nestablished the privilege.  However, courts have consistently held that \n\"recommendations concerning disciplinary review ofa discrete incident do not \ninvolve the policy formulations protected under the deliberative process \nprivilege.\"58  Category Four documents, as described by the City, fall precisely into \nthis area of non-privileged communications. \nAs noted in the discussion of Category Three above, it may be that \ncertain of these documents are covered by the attorney-client privilege or the work \nproduct privilege.  The City is ordered to reevaluate the documents in Category \nFour with the Court's TIlling in mind, to release those documents that do not fall \nunder any of the privileges, and to redraft a privilege log to include those \n418 (2d Cir. 2007) (\"The attorney-client privilege protects most confidential \ncommunications between government counsel and their clients that are made for \nthe purpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance.\"). \n57 \nCity Letter at 4. \n\n58 \n\nVelez, 2010 WL 2265443 at *4. \n19 \n\n\ndocuments that the City still considers privileged under the attorney-client or work \nproduct privileges. \nv. \nCONCLUSION \nIn accordance with the Court's instructions above, the City is ordered \nto review its assertions ofprivilege; revise and resubmit its privilege logs by May \n20, 2011; and release the requested documents that are not covered by the \ndeliberative process privilege, or any other privilege, in view of the Court's \nrulings, whether in their entirety or in redacted form as appropriate. \nDated:  New York, New York \nMay 4,2011 \n20 \n\n\nAppearances \nFor Plaintiffs: \nlohnathan Smith, Esq. \n\nJohanna B.

SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.: \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs bring this putaive class action against the City of New York \n(the \"City\") and the New York City Housing Authority (\"NYCHA\") (collectively, \n\"Defendants\"), alleging a pattern and practice of unlawful stops, seizures, and \narrests for trespass in NYCHA buildings in violation of sections 1983 and 1981 of \ntitle forty-two of the United States Code, the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments \n1 \n\nto the United States Constitution, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,1 Title\nVIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (“Fair Housing Act”),2 the United States\nHousing Act,3 the Constitution and laws of the State of New York, and the New\nYork City Human Rights Law (“NYCHRL”).4  Plaintiffs seek equitable relief in\nthe form of (1) a declaration that Defendants’ acts, practices, policies, and\nomissions in connection with patrol and arrest activities on NYCHA property are\nunlawful, and (2) an injunction against their continued application.5\nThe City now moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiffs’\nclaims for equitable relief, asserting that it has taken actions since the\ncommencement of litigation to address Plaintiffs’ allegations and that these actions\nhave rendered Plaintiffs’ claims moot.  For the reasons set forth below, the City’s\nmotion is denied in its entirety. \nII. BACKGROUND\nA. Plaintiffs’ Allegations \nThe New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) is responsible for\n1 See 42 U.S.C. § 2000(d).\n2 See id. § 3601, et seq.\n3 See id. § 1437, et seq.\n4 See N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-101, et seq. \n5 See Complaint (“Compl.”) ¶ 53.\n2\n\npatrolling public housing facilities operated by NYCHA, with the stated purpose of\npreventing crime and enforcing NYCHA rules and regulations.6  The inspection of\nthe interior of a NYCHA building is referred to as a “vertical patrol.”7  Plaintiffs\ncommenced the instant action on January 28, 2010, alleging that Defendants,\noperating through and in conjunction with the NYPD, “have implemented and\ncontinue to conduct, enforce and sanction an unlawful vertical patrol and trespass\narrest policy which has resulted in a pattern and practice of illegal stops, seizures,\nquestioning, searches, and false arrests of residents of, and authorized visitors to,\nNYCHA residences.”8  \nPlaintiffs contend that the NYPD improperly utilizes “checkpoints” on\nNYCHA property where “officers indiscriminately stop and question every person\nthey observe, without objective individualized suspicion of a crime, and unlawfully\narrest individuals for trespass without probable cause.”9  Additionally, Plaintiffs\nassert that the City has “failed to supervise and discipline officers” who are\n6 See Defendants’ Statement of Undisputed Facts Pursuant to Local\nRule 56.1 (“Def. 56.1”) ¶ 1; Plaintiffs’ Reply Statement of Undisputed Facts\nPursuant to Local Rule 56.1 (“Pl. 56.1”) ¶ 1.\n7 Def. 56.1 ¶ 5; Pl. 56.1 ¶ 5. \n8 Compl. ¶ 2.\n9 Id. ¶ 3.\n3\n\ninvolved in these incidents, does not monitor these incidents, and has not\n“instituted any follow up procedure or disciplinary action when charges are\ndismissed or where it is otherwise established that an individual was arrested\nwithout probable cause.”10\nB. Developments Since the Commencement of the Action\n1. Changes to NYPD Policy \nAt the time this suit was instituted, the NYPD policy at issue was\nreflected, in part, in section 212-60 of the NYPD Patrol Guide (“P.G. 212-60”),\nentitled “Interior Vertical Patrol of Housing Authority Buildings.”11  However,\nchanges to the policy were already being contemplated: in the summer of 2009,\nagainst the backdrop of complaints by the Civilian Complaint Review Board\n(“CCRB”), NYCHA representatives, and tenant leaders concerning the legality of\nstops and arrests in NYCHA buildings, the NYPD leadership decided to revise\nP.G. 212-60 in order to “provid[e] additional guidance to police officers patrolling\nNYCHA properties.”12 \n10 Id. ¶ 147.\n11 Id. ¶ 3.  Despite its title, P.G. 212-60 is not restricted to vertical\npatrols and discusses overall NYPD responsibilities throughout NYCHA property. \nSee Def. 56.1 ¶ 8; Pl. 56.1 ¶ 8. \n12 Def. 56.1 ¶ 17; Pl. 56.1 ¶  17. \n4\n\nAs part of the revision process, the NYPD held a meeting on October\n15, 2009 with high-ranking NYCHA personnel, including NYCHA Chairman John\nB. Rhea, and the Citywide Council of Presidents (“CCOP”), NYCHA’s elected\ntenant association.13  The attendees agreed to establish a permanent Safety and\nSecurity Task Force (“SSTF”), co-chaired by Chairman Rhea and the President of\nthe CCOP, to address NYPD and NYCHA resident relations, security on NYCHA\nproperty, and other matters of community concern.14  \nThe first SSTF meeting was held on December 10, 2009, with\nmeetings occurring at least once a month thereafter.15  Additionally, at its first\nmeeting, SSTF formed five subcommittees to address specific designated topics;\nthese subcommittees each hold regular additional meetings of their own.16  The two\nsubcommittees most pertinent to NYPD patrols of NYCHA property are the\nNYPD’s Policies and Relationships with Residents and the NYCHA Rules and\nRegulations subcommittees — together, these subcommittees address which\nNYCHA rules need to be implemented and enforced.17  Through the\n13 See Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 13-17; Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 13-17. \n14 See Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 24-25, 37; Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 24-25, 37. \n15 See Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 26, 33; Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 26, 33. \n16 See Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 29, 30, 34; Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 29, 30, 34.\n17 See Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 30, 31; Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 30, 31.\n5\n\nsubcommittees and SSTF, the NYPD, NYCHA, and NYCHA residents\ndiscussed the proposed revisions to NYPD’s vertical patrol policy and reviewed\nthe material that was ultimately incorporated into the final policy.18 \nOn June 8, 2010, P.G. 212-60 was replaced by Interim Order Number\n23 (“I.O. 23”).19  The express purpose of I.O. 23 is “[t]o assist the Housing\nAuthority in enforcing its rules, limiting criminal activity, providing a safe and\nsecure environment and ensuring the habitability of its residential buildings for\nHousing Authority residents and their guests by performing interior vertical\npatrols.”20  It seeks to “provide uniformed members of the service additional\nguidance concerning situations occurring within Housing Authority facilities [and\nto] illustrate[] appropriate action to be taken with consideration afforded to the\nuniqueness and totality of the circumstances surrounding each encounter.”21 \nSpecifically, I.O. 23 discusses when “a uniformed member of the service may\napproach and question persons who may be violating Housing Authority rules and\nregulations, including potentially unauthorized persons found in Housing\n18 See Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 40, 43; Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 40, 43. \n19 See Def. 56.1 ¶ 3; Pl. 56.1 ¶ 3.\n20 Def. 56.1 ¶ 9; Pl. 56.1 ¶ 9.\n21 Def. 56.1 ¶ 5; Pl. 56.1 ¶ 5.\n6\n\nAuthority buildings.”22\nThe NYPD developed a ninety-minute training curriculum for I.O. 23\n(“I.O. Training”), with input allegedly incorporated from the NYPD Policies and\nRelationships with Residents Subcommittee.23  The training covers: (1) “the\npurpose and rationale for conducting interior vertical patrols within Housing\nAuthority property,” (2) “the importance of proper interactions between police\nofficer and Housing Authority residents,” and (3) “the revision to Patrol Guide\nsection 212-60, ‘Interior Vertical Patrol of Housing Authority Buildings,’” with\nchanges between P.G. 212-60 and its successor underlined.24  \nThe I.O. Training was implemented in early fall 2010.25  According to\nDefendants, the training is to be rolled out in two stages:  Phase I training includes\n“all uniform members of the Housing Bureau of all rank, including executives, as\nwell as members of the Patrol Services Bureau assigned to precinct housing\nteams;” while Phase II training includes “police officers, sergeants, and lieutenants\n22 Def. 56.1 ¶ 11; Pl. 56.1 ¶ 11.\n23 See Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 45, 51; Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 45, 51.\n24 Def. 56.1 ¶ 46; Pl. 56.1 ¶ 46.\n25 See Def. 56.1 ¶ 70; Pl. 56.1 ¶ 70.\n7\n\nassigned to the Patrol Services Bureau and not within a precinct housing team.”26 \nDefendants report that about ninety percent of Phase I has been completed, with\nover eighteen hundred officers trained, with the remaining ten percent to be trained\nover the next few months.27  Phase II training has yet to begin, but Defendants\nassert that it will be completed within the next twelve months and will occur at the\nrequired annual training sessions for officers, sergeants and lieutenants.28  As a\nresult, those officers trained during Phase I are expected to be trained again as part\nof Phase II.29  The NYPD intends to provide the training to recruits in the future, as\nwell as higher-level supervisors not currently captured in Phase I or Phase II.30  \nThe total anticipated cost of the training is about $2.7 million dollars.31\nIII. LEGAL STANDARD\nA. Summary Judgment\n26 Def. 56.1 ¶ 53; Pl. 56.1 ¶ 53.  According to Defendants, officers in\nPhase II interact far less frequently, if at all, with individuals on NYCHA property. \nSee Def. 56.1 ¶ 58.\n27 See Def. 56.1 ¶ 53.  Plaintiffs assert that the relevant discovery has not\nbeen provided, and they can neither admit nor deny statements pertaining to the\ndetails of the I.O. Training.  See Pl. 56.1 ¶ 53.\n28 See Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 57, 61, 63.\n29 See id. ¶ 64. \n30 See id. ¶ 65.\n31 See id. ¶ 68.   \n8\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions,\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if\nany, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”32  “An issue of fact is genuine if\n‘the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the\nnonmoving party.’  A fact is material if it ‘might affect the outcome of the suit \nunder the governing law.’”33  “[T]he burden of demonstrating that no material fact\nexists lies with the moving party . . . .”34  “When the burden of proof at trial would\nfall on the nonmoving party, it ordinarily is sufficient for the movant to point to a\nlack of evidence . . . on an essential element of the nonmovant’s claim.”35  In turn,\nto defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must raise a\n32 Fed.

APPLICABLE LAW\n“Mootness is a doctrinal restriction stemming from the Article III\nrequirement that federal courts decide only live cases or controversies; a case is\nmoot if the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the case.”42  \nAs the Supreme Court has explained, \n[t]he underlying concern [of the mootness doctrine] is\nthat, when the challenged conduct ceases such that there\nis no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be\nrepeated, then it becomes impossible for the court to\ngrant any effectual relief whatever to [the] prevailing\nparty.  In that case, any opinion as to the legality of the\nchallenged action would be advisory.43\nBecause mootness deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction, it may be\n41 Pyke v.

DISCUSSION\nDefendants argue that “Interim Order 23 and the NYCHA Patrol\nTraining have entirely eliminated the basis for [P]laintiffs’ Monell claim against\nthe City.”50  Defendants assert that I.O. 23 and the I.O. Training constitute\n“comprehensive” reforms that exceed Plaintiffs’ constitutional demands for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, even if they do not satisfy Plaintiffs’ “rather\nextensive wish list of procedures and processes that they would like to see the\nNYPD implement.”51  Moreover, Defendants argue that there is no reasonable\nexpectation that the NYPD will resume its allegedly unlawful practices, given the\n48 Id.

Accordingly, Defendants\ncontend that they have met their burden of establishing that “(1) there is no\nreasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur, and (2) interim relief or\nevents have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged\nviolation.”52  I disagree.\nA. Reasonable Expectation of Recurrence\nIn order for the development and implementation of I.O. 23 and the\nI.O. Training to moot the case, these events must make it “absolutely clear” that the\nNYPD’s allegedly unlawful practices on NYCHA property could not reasonably be\nexpected to recur.53  Yet Plaintiffs assert that they cannot evaluate the status and\nsubstance of I.O. 23 and the I.O. 23 Training, on the grounds that “the relevant\ndiscovery has not been produced.”54  It appears that Plaintiffs have not yet had\nsufficient opportunity to corroborate Defendants’ assertions that I.O. 23 and the\nI.O. 23 Training are fully compliant with legal requirements.  To the extent that\nPlaintiffs have had access to the new policy and training materials, Plaintiffs\nidentify various deficiencies that, in their view, “both fail to remedy the pre-\n52 Lamar Advertising of Penn.

Accordingly,  the efficacy\nof the new policy guide and training curriculum is, at this stage of the litigation,\neither unknown or disputed.56  Under these circumstances, Defendants cannot meet\neither the standard for mootness or summary judgment. \nAs a threshold matter, the parties do not even agree that the\nchallenged conduct has in fact ceased.  Defendants argue that their representations\nof voluntary cessation must be credited by virtue of their governmental status.  Yet\nwhile “[s]ome deference must be accorded to a state’s representations that certain\nconduct has been discontinued,”57  Defendants are not entitled to a complete\nexemption from their “formidable” burden of proof.58  As Plaintiffs point out,\n55 Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for\nSummary Judgment on Their Claims for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (“Pl.\nMem.”) at 4.\n56  See Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 167 (holding that claims by\nenvironmental groups for alleged violations by the holder of a pollutant discharge\npermit were not mooted where defendant had previously achieved substantial\ncompliance with its permit requirements and defendant closed the offending\nfacility following plaintiffs’ appellate victory, because the effect of these events\nwas a disputed fact question — particularly as defendant retained its permit and\ncould ostensibly reopen another offending facility). \n57 Harrison, 981 F.2d at 59. \n58 Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 191. \n15\n\nDefendants have provided no “admissible evidence, statistics, or reports\ndemonstrating that the violations articulated in the Complaint have been resolved,”\nlet alone completely and irrevocably eradicated.59  Indeed, Defendants concede that\nthe implementation of the I.O. Training is incomplete, with ten percent of Phase I\nremaining and Phase II yet to begin.  By implication then, the practices associated\nwith P.G. 212-60 are still, in some measure, extant within the NYPD.   \nEven assuming that the challenged conduct has ceased, Plaintiffs have\nno concrete assurances that Defendants will not resume their allegedly unlawful\narrest and trespass enforcement practices.  As the Second Circuit has opined, the\n“determination of whether there is a reasonable expectation that the wrong will be\nrepeated is not foreclosed by expressions of intention by [government] officials.”60 \nThis is particularly so where, as here, Defendants have a history of similar\nwrongful behavior;61 have not admitted to any constitutional or statutory violation;\n59 Pl. Mem. at 4.\n60 Armstrong v. Ward, 529 F.2d 1132, 1136 (2d Cir. 1976).  Accord\nHilton v. Wright, 235 F.R.D. 40, 48 n.6 (N.D.N.Y. 2006) (rejecting state official’s\nargument that his change in policy and unconditional statement that he will not\nreinstitute the offending policy eliminates any reasonable expectation that the\npolicy wll be reinstated). \n61 See Ahrens v. Bowen, 852 F.2d 49, 53 (2d Cir. 1988) (rejecting a\nmootness claim by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services\nwhere, inter alia, the underlying third-party conduct giving rise to the suit could\nreasonably be repeated and the Secretary could again attempt to preclude the suit\n16\n\nand have refused to enter into any kind of “binding, judicially enforceable\nagreement.”62  While Defendants argue that it is highly improbable that they will\nresume any alleged unlawful behavior in light of the resources they have\ncommitted to the I.O. 23 transition, they have revealed only the projected $2.7\nmillion cost of the training, rather than the amount spent to date.  In effect, the\nNYPD has modified certain internal documents that do not carry the weight of a\nregulation or statute, and which do not bind future officials under a different\nadministration.  In other words, Defendants are “free to return to [their] old\nways.”63  Granting summary judgment at this stage of the litigation would\nforeclose any opportunity for judicial review precisely where it may be needed the\nmost — in the context of alleged continuing constitutional violations by the entities\nentrusted with protecting the public interest. \nby granting last-minute relief to plaintiffs).

Revisions to the Patrol Guide Do Not Fully Address\nPlaintiffs’ Monell Claims\nPerhaps most fatal to Defendants’ mootness motion is the inescapable\nfact that allegations pertaining to NYPD policy constitute only one aspect of\nPlaintiffs’ claim.  As Plaintiffs point out, “the Complaint never equates the\nNYPD’s written vertical patrol policy with the City’s larger trespass enforcement\nand arrest practices.”64  For example, Plaintiffs allege that the City does not\n“monitor improper stops, seizures, and searches for trespass” and does not\nsupervise, discipline, or otherwise follow-up with officers who do not comport\nwith NYPD procedures.65  Any amendments to the NYPD’s patrol guide or officer\ntraining would not address these issues.  As a result, the City’s remedial measures\ndo not fully respond to Plaintiffs’ allegations of wrongdoing, and therefore cannot\nreasonably ensure either that the conduct at issue will not recur in the future or that\nits effects have been eradicated. \nNotably, a Monell claim does not restrict municipal liability to official\npolicies that were adopted and promulgated by City officials, but encompasses\ninformal customs or “‘practices . . . so permanent and well settled as to constitute a\n64 Pl. Mem. at 3.\n65 Compl. ¶ 147.\n18\n\ncustom or usage with the force of law.’”66  As the Supreme Court explained in\nMonell,\nLocal governing bodies . . . can be sued directly under §\n1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where\n.  . . the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional\nimplements  or executes a po licy  statement,  ordinance,\nregulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated\nby that body’s officers. . . .  [They can also be sued for]\ndeprivations visited pursuant to governm ental ‘custom’\neven  though such a custom   has not recei ved  formal\napproval  through the body’s official decisionm aking\nchannels.67\nIn other words, even granting that I.O. 23 and the I.O. Training represent\ncomprehensive and adequate reforms of NYPD policy, Defendants cannot establish\nthat there is no contrary practice or custom for which Plaintiffs may be entitled to\nequitable relief.  The question of whether NYPD officers actually adhere to the\nnew policy articulated in I.O. 23 — and the extent to which the City may tacitly\n66 Monell v. Department of Soc.

SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.: \nPlaintiffs brought this putative class action, on behalf of themselves \nand a class of similarly situated persons, against the City of New York (the \"City\") \nand the New York City Housing Authority (\"NYCHA\") to remedy the continuing \nviolation of various constitutional rights secured by 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (\"section \n1983\").  Nine of the sixteen original plaintiffs, hereafter referred to as the \"Settling \nPlaintiffs,\" accepted offers ofjudgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \n\nProcedure 68 (“Rule 68”)1 and took Judgments Pursuant to Rule 68 (“Rule 68\nJudgments”) against the City on February 7, 2011.2  On July 8, 2011, the Settling\nPlaintiffs moved for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs which the City opposed. \nFor the following reasons, the Settling Plaintiffs’ motion is granted but not in the\namount sought.\n1 Rule 68 states, in relevant part, as follows: “At least 14 days before\nthe date set for trial, a party defending against a claim may serve on an opposing\nparty an offer to allow judgment on specified terms, with the costs then accrued.”\nFed. R. Civ. P. 68(a).\n2 The parties dispute whether the Rule 68 Judgments also release\nNYCHA from the claims brought by the Settling Plaintiffs.  The Rule 68\nJudgments state that “this judgment shall act to release and discharge defendants\nThe City of New York, their successors and/or assigns; and all past and present\nofficials, employees, representatives, and agents of the City of New York, or any\nagency thereof, from any and all claims that were or could have been alleged by\n[the Settling Plaintiff.]”  (emphasis added).   NYCHA is not an agency of the City\nof New York.  Rather, NYCHA “is ‘a body corporate and politic’ created by state\nlaw.”  Romero v. Keeney. 168 F.R.D. 483, 484 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (quoting N.Y. Pub.\nHous. Law § 401) (“[T]he New York City Housing Authority, although its\nmembers are appointed by the mayor, is not an agency of the City of New York.”). \nAccord McLaughlin v. Hernandez, 782 N.Y.S.2d 589, 592 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Co.\n2004) (“NYCHA was created as a public housing authority by act of the State\nLegislature to address the widespread and growing need for adequate low-income\nhousing in New York City.”).  Although NYCHA is not an agency of the City of\nNew York, it is the parties’ intent that will control the scope of the Rule 68\nJudgments.  I do not address this issue at this time.\n2\n\nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs3 filed the instant action on January 28, 2010, alleging\nviolations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States\nConstitution, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,4 Title VIII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1968,5 the United States Housing Act,6, the Constitution and laws of\nthe State of New York, and the New York City Human Rights Law.7  Plaintiffs\nallege that defendants, operating through the New York City Police Department\n(“NYPD”), were engaged in a pattern and practice of “illegal stops, seizures,\nquestioning, searches, and false arrests” of residents and visitors to housing\ndevelopments maintained by the NYCHA.8  In particular, plaintiffs complain about\n3 The original sixteen plaintiffs in this action include Kelton Davis,\nWilliam Turner, Altagracia Hernandez, Edwin Larregui, Roman Jackson, Kristin\nJohnson, Eleanor Britt, Anthony Anderson, Lashaun Smith, Shawne Jones, Hector\nSuarez, Adam Cooper, Andrew Washington, P.L. by his parent Lisa Piggott, David\nWilson and Geneva Wilson.  On September 23, 2010, Altagracia Hernandez\nvoluntarily withdrew all of her claims against defendants.  See Docket Entry # 22.\n4 42 U.S.C. § 2000(d) et seq.\n5 Id. § 3601 et seq. (the “Fair Housing Act”).\n6 Id. § 1437 et seq.\n7 See Complaint ¶ 1.\n8 See id. ¶ 2.\n3\n\nthe use of allegedly unlawful “vertical patrols.”9  These vertical patrols consist of\n“roving pedestrian checkpoints in and around NYCHA residences, wherein [police\nofficers] indiscriminately stop and question every person they observe, without\nobjective individualized suspicion of a crime, and unlawfully arrest individuals for\ntrespass without probable cause.”10  Plaintiffs further allege that “[d]efendants\nimplement and apply these policies, practices, and customs in an intentionally\ndiscriminatory and race-based manner . . . .”11  According to plaintiffs, defendants’\npolicies are “not explained or justified by underlying crime levels in NYCHA\nresidences” but instead are based on the “race, ethnicity, and/or national origin” of\nthe residents and visitors of NYCHA buildings.12  To remedy these constitutional\nviolations, plaintiffs seek class certification “for the purpose of obtaining\ninjunctive and declaratory relief only.”13  Plaintiffs also seek “compensatory\ndamages for their individual claims[.]”14  \n9 See id.\n10 Id. ¶ 3.\n11 Id. ¶ 7.\n12 Id. ¶¶ 8-9.\n13 Id. ¶ 13.\n14 Id. \n4\n\nNine of the sixteen original plaintiffs accepted Rule 68 offers.  Four\nSettling Plaintiffs – Anthony Anderson, Edwin Larregui, William Turner and\nDavid Wilson – were extended Rule 68 offers on September 20, 2010, which they\naccepted on October 4, 2010.15  Five other Settling Plaintiffs – Adam Cooper,\nKelton Davis, Shawne Jones, Hector Suarez and Geneva Wilson – were extended \nRule 68 offers on December 7, 2010, which they accepted December 20, 2010.16 \nWhen the Settling Plaintiffs accepted the Rule 68 offers, they agreed to dismiss all\nclaims in exchange for specified dollar amounts.  Thus, the Settling Plaintiffs did\nnot obtain class certification, injunctive relief, or declaratory relief.\nIn their motion for attorneys’ fees and costs, the Settling Plaintiffs\nsubmitted bills for seven attorneys, four from the Legal Aid Society (“LAS” or\n“Legal Aid”) and three from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund,\nInc. (“LDF” or the “Fund”).  Initially, the Settling Plaintiffs sought a total award of\n$277,255.58, consisting of $114,102.20 in fees for Legal Aid, $151,109.63 in fees\nfor LDF, and $12,043.75 in costs for LDF.  In their reply papers, the Settling\nPlaintiffs seek an additional $5,418.75 in attorneys’ fees for Legal Aid and\n15 See Judgment Pursuant to Rule 68, Ex. B to the Declaration of\nMorgan D. Kunz, Assistant Corporation Counsel, in Opposition to Plaintiffs’\nMotion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs (“Kunz Decl.”).\n16 See Judgment Pursuant to Rule 68, Ex. C to the Kunz Decl.\n5\n\n$19,370.00 in attorneys’ fees for LDF.17  When the other adjustments proposed by\nthe Settling Plaintiffs are taken into account,18 the revised amounts sought in\nattorneys’ fees is $118,883.45 for Legal Aid and $138,450.88 for LDF, with the\nsame costs of  $12,043.75 for LDF.19\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nA “prevailing party” in a civil rights action is entitled to an award of\nattorneys’ fees and costs.20  The Second Circuit has held that plaintiffs who accept\nRule 68 offers of judgment qualify as “prevailing parties” entitled to attorneys’\nfees and costs.21  Furthermore, a prevailing party is also entitled to reimbursement\n17 See Attorney Declaration of Nancy Rosenbloom in Support of\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs (“Rosenbloom\nDecl.”) ¶ 4.\n18 The Settling Plaintiffs propose the following reductions to the amount\nof fees sought: $637.50 (Legal Aid) and $3,071.25 (LDF) for duplicate entries;\n$26,422.50 (LDF) for post-Rule 68 work; and $2,535.00 (LDF) for block billing\nentries.  See id. ¶¶ 5, 6 and 7.\n19 See id. ¶ 8.\n20 See 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) (stating that “the court, in its discretion, may\nallow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee\nas part of the costs” in civil rights actions).  See also Raishevich v. Foster, 247 F.3d\n337, 344 (2d Cir. 2001) (“Although a district court typically has wide discretion in\nchoosing whether to deny attorneys’ fees, . . . this discretion is narrowed by a\npresumption that successful civil rights litigants should ordinarily recover\nattorneys’ fees unless special circumstances would render an award unjust.”).\n21 See Lyte v. Sara Lee Corp., 950 F.2d 101, 103-04 (2d Cir. 1991) (“A\nplaintiff involved in litigation ultimately resolved by settlement may still be\n6\n\nfor time reasonably expended in preparing its attorneys’ fee application.22  Thus,\n“absent unreasonably dilatory conduct by the prevailing party in ‘any portion’ of\nthe litigation, which would justify denying fees for that portion, a fee award\npresumptively encompasses all aspects of the civil action,” including litigation\nover attorneys’ fees.23  “The district court has broad authority to depart from this\nbasic assumption” where, for example, “the fee claims are exorbitant or the time\ndevoted to presenting them is unnecessarily high.”24\nDistrict courts are afforded considerable discretion in determining the\namount of attorneys’ fees in any given case.25  In calculating a reasonable fee\naward, the Second Circuit has adopted the “presumptively reasonable fee”\nentitled to an award of attorneys’ fees.” (citing Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122, 129\n(1980));  Baird v. Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP, 219 F. Supp. 2d 510, 518\n(S.D.N.Y. 2002) (“The Second Circuit has also found that a plaintiff who accepts a\nRule 68 offer of judgment can qualify to be a ‘prevailing party’ entitled to\nattorneys’ fees and costs.”) (citing Sara Lee, 950 F.2d at 104). \n22 See Weyant v. Okst, 198 F.3d 311, 316 (2d Cir. 1999) (“[A]\nreasonable fee should be awarded for time reasonably spent in preparing and\ndefending an application for § 1988 fees.”).\n23 Commissioner, INS v.

The Second Circuit has recently stated that\n[w]hile a court may, in exceptional circumstances, adjust\nthe lodestar, it may not disregard it entirely.  Especially for\nclaims where the financial recovery is likely to be sm all,\ncalculating attorneys’ fees as a proportion of damages runs\ndirectly contrary to the purpose of fee-shifting statutes:\nassuring that civil rights claims of modest cash value can\nattract  competent  counsel. The whole purpose of\nfee-shifting statutes is to generate attorneys’ fees that are\ndisproportionate to the plaintiff’s recovery.  Thus, the\ndistrict court abused its di scretion when it ignored the\nlodestar and calculated the attorneys’ fees as a proportion\nof the damages awarded.33\n30 Gierlinger v. Gleason, 160 F.3d 858, 882 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting\nBlum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 896 n.11 (1984)).\n31 Marisol A. ex rel. Forbes v. Giuliani, 111 F.

Accord Kassim v. City of Schenectady, 415 F.3d 246, 252 (2d Cir. 2005)\n9\n\nThe Second Circuit has stated, however, “that ‘the most critical factor’\nin a district court’s determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney’s fees in\na given case ‘is the degree of success obtained’ by the plaintiff.”34  The “degree of\nsuccess” inquiry “is not limited to inquiring whether a plaintiff prevailed on\nindividual claims.”35  “Both the quantity and quality of relief obtained, as\ncompared to what the plaintiff sought to achieve as evidenced in her complaint, are\nkey factors in determining the degree of success achieved.”36  “‘If a plaintiff has\nachieved only partial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably expended\non the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive\namount . . . even where the plaintiff’s claims were interrelated, non-frivolous, and\nraised in good faith.’”37   Accordingly, “a district judge’s authority to reduce the\nfee awarded to a prevailing plaintiff below the lodestar by reason of the plaintiff’s\n(“Reasoning that a rule calling for proportionality between the fee and the\nmonetary amount involved in the litigation would effectively prevent plaintiffs\nfrom obtaining counsel in cases where deprivation of a constitutional right caused\ninjury of low monetary value, we have repeatedly rejected the notion that a fee may\nbe reduced merely because the fee would be disproportionate to the financial\ninterest at stake in the litigation.”). \n34 Barfield, 537 F.3d at 152 (quoting Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103,\n114 (1992)).\n35 Id. (citing Kassim, 415 F.3d at 254). \n36 Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n37 Id. (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436).\n10\n\n‘partial or limited success’ is not restricted either to cases of multiple discrete\ntheories or to cases in which the plaintiff won only a nominal or technical\nvictory.”38\n“Congress did not intend the calculation of fee awards to vary\ndepending on whether plaintiff was represented by private counsel or by a\nnonprofit legal services organization.”39  In furtherance of such parity, the Supreme\nCourt offered the following guidance within the context of the federal civil rights\nfee-shifting statute:\nCases may be overstaffed, and the skill and experience of\nlawyers vary widely.  Counsel for the prevailing party\nshould make a good faith effort to exclude from  a fee\nrequest hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise \nunnecessary, just as a lawyer in private practice ethically is\nobligated to exclude such hours from his fee submission. \nIn the private sector, “billing judgm ent” is an important\ncomponent in fee setting.  It is no less im portant here. \nHours that are not properly billed to one’s  client also are\nnot properly billed to one’sa  dversary pursuant to statutory\nauthority.40\n38 Kassim, 415 F.3d at 256.\n39 Blum, 465 U.S. at  894.\n40 Hensley, 461 at 434 (quotation marks and citation omitted, emphasis\nin original).\n11\n\nThus, “[i]n determining what fee is reasonable, the court takes account of claimed\nhours that it views as ‘excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.’”41  In \ndoing so, “the district court does not play the role of an uninformed arbiter but may\nlook to its own familiarity with the case and its experience generally as well as to\nthe evidentiary submissions and arguments of the parties.”42  Moreover, the\n“presumptively reasonable fee” is subject to further reduction due to plaintiffs’\nlimited success.43  “In lieu of making minute adjustments to individual timekeeping\nentries, a court may make across-the-board percentage cuts in the number of hours\nclaimed, ‘as a practical means of trimming fat from a fee application.’”44   \n41 Bliven v.

The February Proposal did not\ninclude any attorneys’ fees or costs for work done by the Paul Weiss attorneys. \nThe February Proposal was intended to only include fees for work through\nDecember 7, 2010, the date of the City’s second round of Rule 68 offers.  The\nFebruary Proposal states:\nBecause these settlements are limited to individual damages\nand are for a subset of Plaintiffs, our present application is\nlimited to fees that we attribute to work done on behalf of\nthe Rule 68 Plaintiffs’ individual damages only.  As such,\nthis application does not seek fees for work done solely in\nfurtherance  of the  Monell  claims  or injunctiv e  relief. \nMoreover, where the work is attributable to all o f the\nPlaintiffs, we have discounted the amount in half since this\napplication  is on behalf of  approximately  half of the\nPlaintiffs.45\nThe February Proposal sought $41,041.50 in attorneys’ fees for the following\nattorneys: Amanda Moretti, Steve Wasserman, Nancy Rosenbloom, Johanna\nSteinberg, and Jih Hee Lee.46\n45 2/25/11 Letter from Katharine E.G. Brooker, attorney at Paul Weiss,\nto Tonya Jenerette and Bradford C. Patrick of the Special Federal Litigation\nDivision of the Office of the Corporation Counsel at 1.\n46 See id., Attorney Hours Summary.\n13\n\nIncluded in the declarations of attorneys William Gibney and Johanna\nB. Steinberg in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees and\nCosts is an identical Exhibit B which contains time entries associated with the\nSettling Plaintiffs’ individual claims.47  Although the City apparently “absolutely\nrefused to negotiate a bifurcated fee settlement,”48 this Court finds that the fees\nassociated with plaintiffs’ pattern and practice claims should be deferred, pending\nthe ultimate resolution of this action.  To allocate a portion of such fees to the\nSettling Plaintiffs at this stage of the litigation makes little sense given that the\ndegree of plaintiffs’ success with regard to their pattern and practice claims has not\nyet been determined.  The degree of plaintiffs’ success is perhaps the most crucial\nfactor to be considered when determining the amount of fees to be awarded. \nAccordingly, this Court will confine the present fee request to the fees associated\nwith the Settling Plaintiffs’ individual claims for money damages.  \nIn determining the appropriate amount of such fees, the supporting\ndocumentation found in Exhibit B – detailing each attorneys’ time charges for the\n47 See Ex. B to Declaration of William Gibney in Support of Plaintiffs’\nMotion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs (“Gibney Decl.”); Ex. B to\nDeclaration of Johanna B. Steinberg in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for an Award\nof Attorneys’ Fees and Costs (“Steinberg Decl.”).\n48 Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ Application for an\nAward of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs (“Pl. Mem.”) at 5.\n14\n\nSettling Plaintiffs’ claims – will be relied upon and reviewed.   Because of a\nprevious mathematical error in the amount of attorneys’ fees originally included in\nExhibit B, plaintiffs submitted a revised Exhibit B on October 3, 2011.  The\namount of fees included in the revised Exhibit B is $38,032.50.\n  B. Hourly Rates\nThe City argues that there is a “disconnect” between the hourly rates\nsought for the attorneys seeking fees and the level of experience for those\nattorneys.  The following chart summarizes the  information found  in Exhibit B.49\nAttorney Hour Rate  Total Adjusted  Adj.\nTotal Hrs\nLAS Moretti 27.25 $425 $11,581.25   $7,596.88 17.88\nWasserman 23.25 $425   $9,881.25   $8,659.38 20.38\nRosenbloom   1.50 $425      $637.50      $637.50   1.50\nLDF Steinberg\n Pre 7/1/10 47.25 $360 $17,010.00 $10,890.00 30.63\n Post 7/1/10  25.10 $390   $8,287.50   $7,848.75 23.90\nLee 11.00 $400   $4,400.00   $2,400.00   6.00\nTotals $38,032.51\n49 The last column, Adjusted Hours, is arrived at by dividing the\nAdjusted Total by the attorney’s hourly rate.  For example, the Adjusted Total for\nMoretti is $7,596.88.  Dividing that amount by Moretti’s hourly rate of $425 yields\n17.88 in Adjusted Hours.  Finally, the “Adjusted Total” column differs from the\n“Total” column because, as stipulated to by the parties, the attorneys only billed\nfifty percent (50%) for those time entries applicable to all plaintiffs as opposed to\none-hundred percent (100%) for those time entries specifically identifying one or\nmore of the Settling Plaintiffs by name.\n15\n\nThe hourly rates sought by the Settling Plaintiffs, the rates proposed \nby the City,  and the rates determined by this Court are summarized in below.\nAttorney Years Hourly Rate Hourly Rate Hourly Rate\nExperience Sought Proposed Set by Court\nWasserman 31 $425 $400 $425\nMoretti 20 $425 $350 $400\nRosenbloom 24 $425 $350 $400\nSteinberg -                                                                  \npre 7/1/10 9 $360 $300 $350\nSteinberg -\npost 7/1/10 9 $390 $300 $375\nLee 11 $400 $300 $375\nWasserman has the most experience, thirty-one years, and is therefore\nentitled to the highest rate sought by the Settling Plaintiffs.  Moretti and\nRosenbloom have considerably less experience than Wasserman, twenty and\ntwenty-four years respectively, but the  Settling Plaintiffs seek the same hourly rate\nof $425 per hour for both attorneys.50  To account for the differences in experience,\nthis Court finds that a small reduction, to  $400 per hour, is appropriate for these\n50 In their reply papers, plaintiffs suggest that “[i]f the Court finds that\ndifferent rates are appropriate, it would be more appropriate to raise the rates of the\nmost senior attorneys rather than reduce the rates of the next most experienced.” \nReply Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ Application for an Award of\nAttorneys’ Fees and Costs (“Reply”) at 3.  Because the most experienced attorney\nis being compensated at an appropriate level, this Court declines plaintiffs’\nsuggestion.\n16\n\nattorneys.  Finally, Steinberg and Lee have roughly half of the experience of\nMoretti and Rosenbloom yet the Settling Plaintiffs seek rates of $360/$390 and\n$400 per hour for these attorneys.  Surely, a reasonable paying client would not\npay an attorney with ten years experience the same hourly rate he would pay an\nattorney with twenty or thirty years experience.  Accordingly, the Court sets the\nrates for Steinberg and Lee at $350 per hour.  The rates established above are in\naccord with relevant case law.51     \nC. Pre-Complaint Work\nThe City objects to a number of time entries that pre-date the filing of\nthe Complaint on the ground that the work billed must be expended on the\nlitigation itself.52  In Webb v. Board of Education of Dyer County, Tennessee, the\n51 See, e.g., Handschu v. Special Servs. Div., 727 F. Supp. 2d 239, 246\n(S.D.N.Y. 2010) (approving $400 per hour for seasoned civil rights attorneys\nadmitted to the bar in the 1960s and 1970s) (citing Simmonds v. New York City\nDep’t of Corr., No. 06 Civ. 5298, 2008 WL 4303474, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 16,\n2008) (where, in the context of a Title VII civil rights case, the court relied upon\nher “independent knowledge of the rates charged by attorneys for similar services\nand of recent awards in the district for complex civil rights matters” in\ncompensating the two lead attorneys at $425 per hour)); Rahman v. Smith &\nWollensky Rest. Grp., Inc., No. 06 Civ. 6198, 2008 WL 1899938, at *4 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 29, 2008) (compensating an attorney with ten years experience at $350 per\nhour); Heng Chan, 2007 WL 1373118, at *4 (finding $400 per hour to be a\nreasonable rate for an attorney at the Urban Justice Center who had fifteen years of\ncivil rights litigation experience). \n52 See Defendant City of New York’s Memorandum of Law in\nOpposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs (“Def. Mem.”) at\n17\n\nSupreme Court noted that “[t]he time that is compensable under § 1988 is that\n‘reasonably expended on the litigation.’”53  The Supreme Court suggested that the\nstandard to use to determine if pre-complaint work is compensable is whether the\nwork “was both useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance the civil rights\nlitigation to the stage it reached before settlement.”54  The question, then, is how\nmuch of the work performed prior to the filing of the complaint was useful to\nadvance the federal claims subsequently asserted herein.\nWasserman’s time charges begin on January 15, 2009 and end on\nDecember 10, 2009.55  Thus, for purposes of the instant fee award, all of\nWasserman’s time is pre-complaint.  Steinberg’s time charges begin on May 27,\n2009, and continue through January 22, 2010.56  According to the supporting\ndocumentation, the vast majority of Wasserman’s time entries list the actual\n16-17.\n53 471 U.S. 234, 242 (1985) (emphasis in original).\n54 Id. at 243.\n55 See Attorney Time Detail – Steve Wasserman (LAS), Ex. B to the\nGibney and Steinberg Decls.\n56 See Attorney Time Detail –Johanna Steinberg (LDF), Ex. B to the\nGibney and Steinberg Decls.\n18\n\nplaintiff with whom the work was associated.57  For those entries that do not\nidentify a particular plaintiff, the Settling Plaintiffs allocate half the amount as\ncompensable, in accordance with the parties’s stipulation.58  Conversely, most of\nSteinberg’s pre-complaint time entries do not identify a particular plaintiff.59  As\nwith Wasserman, the Settling Plaintiffs include only fifty percent of Steinberg’s\nunidentifiable pre-complaint work in the instant fee request. \nThis Court finds that most of Wasserman’s and Steinberg’s pre-\ncomplaint work was relevant and related to the instant litigation and is thus\ncompensable.  However, for those time entries that relate to “potential plaintiffs,”\nthe following adjustments are needed:  Wasserman – 2.50 hours (8/24/09), 1.25\nhours (8/26/09) (3.75 hours total reduction);  Steinberg – 2.50 hours (8/24/09),\n1.25 hours (8/26/09), 0.50 hours (9/5/09) (4.25 hours total reduction, all pre\n7/1/10).60\n57 See, e.g., 1/15/09 (Adam Cooper: conferred with Legal Aid Attorney);\n4/18/09 (Anthony Anderson; wrote letter to Plaintiff); 5/27/09 (met with Edwin\nLarregui).\n58 See 8/24/09; 8/26/09; 10/14/09.\n59 The time entries that do identify a particular plaintiff include 6/10/09;\n11/23/09; 1/19/10; 1/22/10.  The remaining entries are described in terms more\ngeneral such as “plaintiffs,” “potential plaintiffs,” and “clients.”\n60 The fact that only minor adjustments were made to adjust for pre-\ncomplaint work is not intended to bind this Court with respect to any future fee\n19\n\nD. Travel Time\nThe City acknowledges that the Settling Plaintiffs seek compensation\nfor travel time at fifty percent (50%) of their normal rates.  Nonetheless, the City\nargues that “given the wide availability of electronic means of communication, . . .\na reasonable paying client would not agree to pay for travel time.”61  The City has\ntherefore identified two areas for possible deductions: (1) those time entries\nspecifically designated as travel time only, for which a 100% reduction is\nsuggested; and (2) those time entries that list meetings held in outside offices but\ndo not contain separate entries for travel time, for which a 33% reduction is\nproposed.62\nThis Court rejects the City’s proposal to eliminate, in their entirety,\nthose time entries specifically designated as travel only, which were billed at fifty\npercent (50%) of the attorneys’ normal rates.  Courts in this district typically allow\nrequests, where more substantial reductions may be necessary for work not\nreasonably expended on the litigation, pre-complaint and otherwise.  Furthermore,\nthis Court does not intend for this Opinion and Order to have any res\njudicata/collateral estoppel effect or otherwise affect the objections, challenges,\nand/or defenses that could be raised by the defendants in the future.\n61 Def. Mem. at 15-16.\n62 See id. at 16.\n20\n\nfor travel time at fifty percent.63  However, this Court agrees with  the second\ncategory of adjustments but does not agree with the suggested discount rate of\n33%.  Accordingly, the following adjustments, in hours, are needed to discount\ntravel time: Moretti – 0.50 hours (5/24/10); 0.50 hours (9/24/10) (1 hour total\nreduction); Wasserman – 1.00 hours (4/18/09), 0.50 hours (5/27/09) (1.50 hours\ntotal reduction); Steingberg – 1.00 hours (11/5/09), 1.00 hours (11/23/09), 0.50\nhours (8/17/10), 1.00 hours (9/23/10) (3.5 hours total reduction, 2 hours pre 7/1/10\nand 1.5 hours post 7/1/10); Lee - 0.50 hours (5/25/10), 0.50 hours (8/17/09) (1 hour\ntotal reduction). \nE. Class Certification\nAttorney Jin Hee Lee charged one hour on October 26, 2010 for\n“Draft class cert declaration for S. Jones.”   The Settling Plaintiffs, however,\nachieved no class-wide relief, only money damages for their individual claims. \nThus, work related to class certification did not advance the settlement efforts of\nthe Settling Plaintiff and is therefore non-compensable.  Accordingly, one hour of\n63 See, e.g., Colburn Family Found. v. Chabad’s Children of Chernobyl,\nNo. 06 Civ. 2351, 2011 WL 1758639, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 12, 2011); In re\nPainewebber Ltd. P’ships Litig., No. 94 Civ. 8547, 2003 WL 21787410, at *4\n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2003) (“When determining attorneys’ fees, courts in the\nSouthern District of New York generally do not credit travel time at the attorney’s\nfull hourly rate and customarily reduce the amount awarded for travel to at least\n50% of that rate.”). \n21\n\nLee’s time will be deducted from the instant award.\nF. Revised Summary of Charges\nIn light of the adjustments made above, to both the hourly rates and\nthe number of hours, the following chart summarizes the attorneys’ fees that relate\nto the litigation of the Settling Plaintiffs’ claims.64\n                              Adjusted Adjusted  Adjusted\nAttorney Hours Rates Fees\nAmanda Moretti 16.88 $400   $6,752.00\nSteve Wasserman 15.13 $425   $6,430.25\nNancy Rosenbloom 1.5 $400      $600.00\nJohanna Steinberg -  24.38 $350   $8,533.00\npre 7/1/10\npost 7/1/10 22.4 $375   $8,400.00\nJin Hee Lee 4 $375   $1,500.00\nTotal $32,215.25\nThe Settling Plaintiffs also seek attorneys’ fees relating to the filing of\nthe instant fee application.  The hours requested, and the adjusted rates, are as\nfollows: Lee - 7 hours at $375 per hour ; Rosenbloom - 12.75 hours at $400 per\n64 Because this award encompasses only the fees relating to the\nindividual damages claims, the City’s suggestion of an across-the-board reduction\ndue to plaintiffs’ limited success and vague and block billing is unnecessary.\n22\n\nhour; Smith - 45.25 hours at $280 per hour;65 Steinberg - 10.00 hours at $375 per\nhour.  The corresponding amounts are as follows: Lee - $2,625.00; Rosenbloom -\n$5,100.00; Smith - $12,670.00; Steinberg - $3,750.00, all of which total\n$24,145.00.\nG. Expert Fees\nPursuant to section 1988, courts only have the discretion to tax expert\nfees as costs in actions brought under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1981a, not section\n1983.66   The Supreme Court has held that section 1988 does not authorize courts to\nshift expert fees to the losing party as part of a “reasonable attorney’s fee” in a\nsection 1983 case.67  “After Casey, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1991,\nwhich amended 42 U.S.C. § 1988 to give courts discretion to shift expert fees to\nthe losing party in cases arising under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1981(a).  As\n65 Jonathan Smith has four years experience and, as such, his hourly rate\nof $280 per hour is appropriate.\n66 See 42 U.S.C. § 1988(c) (“In awarding an attorney’s fee under\nsubsection (b) of this section in any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of\nsection 1981 or 1981a of this title, the court, in its discretion, may include expert\nfees as part of the attorney’s fee.”); Tatum v. City of New York, No. 06 Civ. 4290,\n2010 WL 334975, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, 2010) (“Finally, the law is clear that\ncounsel may not recover under Section 1988 for expert fees paid in connection\nwith a Section 1983 action.”) (citing Wilder v. Bernstein, 975 F. Supp. 276, 287\n(S.D.N.Y. 1997)).\n67 See West Virginia Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S. 83, 102\n(1991).\n23\n\nCongress explicitly limited the amendment to cases arising under § 1981, Casey \nstill prohibits the award of expert fees in § 1983 cases.\"68  Consequently, plaintiffs \ncannot recover any amounts paid in expert witness fees. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, the Settling Plaintiffs are awarded \n$56,360.25 in attorneys' fees ($32,215.25 in litigation fees and $24,145.00 in fees \nrelated to the fee application) and zero costS.69  The Clerk of the Court is directed \nto close the motion for attorneys' fees (Docket Entry # 80). \nSO ORDERED: \nDated: \t New York, New York \nOctober 17,2011 \n68  Wilder, 975 F.

These constitutional injuries \nstem directly from the City's official policy, as stated, in part, in Interim Order 23  (\"1.0. 23\") \nand related instructional materials.  That policy requires NYCHA residents and guests, who are \nby definition under the policy not suspected of criminal activity,  to either:  (1) affirmatively \nestablish their right to be in a NYCHA building or (2) leave the premises upon request by an \nNYPD  officer.  The  refusal to meet these two  demands  can result  in  an  arrest for  criminal \ntrespass, even where there is no independent evidence giving rise to reasonable suspicion-let \nalone probable cause-that the person was trespassing.  This policy is in blatant violation of the \nFourth Amendment. \nAn individual who  is  not  suspected of engaging in criminal conduct has the right to \nrefuse to answer a police officer's questions, provide identification, or explain his or her business \nwithout fear  of criminal arrest.  See Brown v.  Texas,  443  U.S.  47,  53  (1979).  That is true \nanywhere in New York City-whether it be in a NYCHA or private residence, or on the street. \nThe City, however, treats public housing differently.  According to the City's own policy, which \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS-HBP   Document 241    Filed 12/15/12   Page 3 of 11\nis not in dispute, residents of, and visitors to, NYCHA apartments cannot simply go about their \nbusiness and ignore an NYPD officer's inquiries, even in situations where they are not suspected \nof any criminal activity.  In essence, NYCHA residents and visitors are forced to surrender their \nFourth Amendment rights-or risk arrest-for simply being in public housing. \nRELEVANT FACTS \nThe New York State criminal trespass laws provide that: \nA person is guilty of criminal trespass in the third degree when he \nknowingly enters or remains unlawfully in a building or upon real \nproperty ... \n( e)  where  the  building  is  used  as  a  public  housing  project  in \nviolation of conspicuously posted rules or regulations governing \nentry and use thereof; or \n(f) where a building is used as a public housing project in violation \nof a personally communicated request to leave the premises from a \nhousing police officer or other person in charge thereof ... \nN.Y. Penal Law § 140.10(e)-(f) (McKinney 2012) (emphasis added). \nPursuant to a 1994 Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") between Defendants City \nand NYCHA, the City agreed to provide NYCHA with services over and above routine police \nservices, including vertical patrols, in consideration for a substantial annual payment.  PIs. 56.1 ~ \n1.  In addition to enforcing criminal laws,  such as criminal trespass, NYPD officers also are \n\"empowered to enforce such NYCHA rules and regulations and perform such other duties as \nshall be determined ... by the City and NYCHA.\"  PIs. 56.1 ~ 2.  Consistent with the MOU, the \nNYPD purports to have inherited \"custodial authority for NYCHA property.\"  PIs. 56.1 ~ 17. \nThe  City's  trespass  enforcement  policy  in  NYCHA  developments  is  set  forth  and \nincorporated in NYPD  Patrol  Guide  Section 212-60  (\"PG 212-60\"),  as  revised,  and  related \ninstructional materials.  See Monell v. Dep 't of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690 (1978) (explaining \n2 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS-HBP   Document 241    Filed 12/15/12   Page 4 of 11\nthat  a  municipal  policy  includes  any  \"policy  statement [ s],  ordinance[ s],  regulation[ s],  or \ndecision[s] officially adopted and promulgated by that body's officers\"). \nBefore the instant litigation was filed, PG 212-60 merely directed officers to \"[b]e alert \nfor persons loitering within the buildings,  or suspicious conditions.\"  PIs.  56.1  ~ 4.  In June \n20 1O  -after the filing of this lawsuit-the City revised PG 212-60 with 1.0.23, which added two \nprotocols  relevant  to  this  motion:  (1)  an  approach-and-question  protocol  for  officers  who \nencounter individuals, including \"potentially unauthorized person[s],\" who may be violating the \nHouse Rules; and (2) a protocol for arresting individuals who refuse to leave the premises when \nasked to do so by NYPD officers.  PIs. 56.1 ~5, 11 and 13. \nPursuant to 1.0. 23, NYPD officers policing NYCHA developments are directed to \"be \nalert  for  persons  who  may  be  violating  Housing  Authority  rules  and  regulations,  including \npotentially unauthorized persons within NYCHA Property.\"  PIs. 56.1 ~ 10.  Upon encountering \nsuch persons, the City's trespass enforcement policy directs officers to approach the person and \nask three questions: \n(1) If he or she lives in the building \n(2) If he or she is visiting someone in the building \n(3) If he or she has business in the building. \nPIs. 56.1 ~ 11. \n1.0. 23 does not require an officer to have reasonable suspicion before \"approaching\" and \nengaging  in  this  questioning  protocol.  PIs.  56.1  ~ 22.  Moreover,  1.0.  23  and  the  related \ninstructional materials state that a person's silence or refusal to explain his or her presence in the \nbuilding,  alone,  cannot be used to escalate the encounter or establish reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause.  PIs. 56.1 ~ 19; Davis, 2012 WL 4813837, at *14. \n3 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS-HBP   Document 241    Filed 12/15/12   Page 5 of 11\nAccording to La. 23, \"[i]f a person refuse[s] to explain or is unable to explain his or her \npresence  in the building,  the  officer  may  instruct the  person that  he  or she  must  leave the \nbuilding or be subject to arrest for trespass.\"  PIs.  56.1 ~ 13.  La. 23 authorizes an arrest if the \n\"person refuses to exit the building and does not promptly establish a right to be in the building.\" \nId.  Officers are not required to have reasonable suspicion or probable cause of criminal trespass \nbefore asking that person to leave NYCHA premises.  (La. 23, Training, Sweet/Anderson.)  The \nbasis  for  arresting  someone  refusing  to  leave  a  NYCHA  residence  is  the  \"violation  of a \npersonally communicated request to leave the premises\" by the NYPD officer pursuant to N.Y. \nPenal Law § 140.10(f); accord Pis. 56.1 ~ 26.) \nThe  City  prepared  instructional  materials  for  NYPD  officers  who  patrol  NYCHA \nresidences (the \"Lesson\").  This Lesson, which is contained both in an internal Lesson Plan as \nwell  as  a PowerPoint presentation,  presents the following  hypothetical  scenario as consistent \nwith the City's policy: \nAn officer on vertical patrol in a NYCHA building is filling out a \nField  Report  indicating  a  broken  front  door  lock  when  she \nobserves a person enter the building through the unlocked door. \nThe officer approaches the person and asks if he is a resident of the \nbuilding.  The person says he lives in Apartment 6C.  The officer \nasks the person if he has identification or a key to the front door. \nHe says that he left both in his Apartment.  The officer then asks \nthe  man  if he  would  mind  coming  with  her  to  6C.  The  man \nrefuses.  The officer advises the man he must establish a right to be \nin the building or leave the location. 1  [T]he man refuses to \n.... \nleave  the  building,  tells  the  officer  he  is  going  nowhere,  and \nremains  in  the  lobby.  The  officer  arrests  the  man  for  criminal \ntrespass  . . . [W]hen the  officer returns to the  stationhouse  she \nnotices that the man's identification shows that he was in fact a \nresident  of the building.  The  officer should  follow  appropriate \npolice procedures to void the arrest .... \nUp until this point, the Lesson states that there is no reasonable suspicion or probable \n1 \ncause that a crime has been or is being committed during the encounter. \n4 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS-HBP   Document 241    Filed 12/15/12   Page 6 of 11\nPIs. 56.1 ~ 21,23 and 25.  Thus, 1.0. 23 expressly authorizes NYPD officers to ask an individual, \nwho may be a resident, to leave a NYCHA apartment building when there is no evidence of \ncriminality, and to arrest that potential NYCHA resident for refusing to do so. \nARGUMENT \nThe power ofNYPD officers-whether they are acting on behalf of NYCHA, pursuant to \ntheir independent mandate to enforce criminal laws, or both-is subject to the limitations of the \nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Yet, the City is circumventing the Fourth \nAmendment by instructing NYPD officers via I. O.  23  that they can arrest people for trespass \nwithout independent probable cause that they are trespassing or committing any other crime. \nThe  scheme  constructed  by  1.0.  23  operates  as  follows:  without  reasonable  suspicion  or \nprobable cause, NYPD officers can command people to affirmatively establish their right to be in \na NYCHA residence or leave the premises, and then arrest those who refuse to comply.  As the \nSupreme Court has recognized, such a policy \"is an unjustified impairment of liberty.\" See City \nof Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 59 (1999). \nThe City's policy authorizes an end-run around the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment \nby  impermissibly  shifting  the  burden  onto  the  NYCHA resident  or  guest  to  affirmatively \ndisprove trespass, or risk arrest, without any indicia of criminality.  In addition, NYPD officers \nrely  on  their  purported  custodial  authority  to  act  outside  the  boundaries  of the  Fourth \nAmendment, resulting in unfettered discretion to request that individuals leave the premises, or \nrisk arrest, despite the absence of reasonable suspicion or probable cause. \nThe constitutional flaws in the City's policy are evident not only in the language of I. O. \n23 itself, but also in the Lesson, including the hypothetical described above.  As the City's own \n5 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS-HBP   Document 241    Filed 12/15/12   Page 7 of 11\nLesson makes abundantly clear, it is City policy that NYCHA residents who elect not to answer \nan NYPD officer's inquiries, or whose answers fail to satisfy the officer, can be expelled from \ntheir own buildings-or, worse, arrested-in the complete absence of reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause that they are trespassing.  The City's policy proposes a solution to such unlawful \narrests:  voiding  the  arrest  once  the  individual's  residence  has  been  established  at  the \nstationhouse.  That  is  unacceptable.  A  voided  arrest  denies  the  magnitude  of the  Fourth \nAmendment violation sustained by an innocent NYCHA resident or guest, who has suffered the \nindignity  and  injury  of being  unlawfully  stopped  and  questioned,  arrested without  probable \ncause, and taken into custody by law enforcement officers. \nThe City contends that the arrest of a person who refuses to leave a NYCHA residence is \npermissible pursuant to its \"custodial authority\" for NYCHA property and the powers imbued \nunder N.Y.  Penal  Law  §  140.10(f),  which  makes  it  a crime to remain  in  a public  housing \nbuilding in \"violation of a personally communicated request to leave the premises\" by an NYPD \nofficer.  (PIs.  56.1  ~ 26.)  But Section 140.10(f) or the City's policy,  either separately or in \ncombination, cannot pass constitutional muster where it does not require the officer to have any \nindicia of criminality, let alone indicia of trespassing, to make the request to leave. \nThis raises a concern implicated by the City's policy:  the unconstitutional burden on the \nNYCHA resident or guest to affirmatively disprove trespass, or risk arrest, without any indicia of \ncriminality.  The City acknowledges, in both 1.0. 23 and the Lesson, that citizens have a right not \nto respond to police inquiries, and that refusal will not provide an officer reasonable suspicion to \neffect a stop,  let alone probable cause to arrest.  See Florida v.  Bostick,  501  U.S.  429, 437 \n(1991) (holding that refusal to cooperate, without more, does not furnish the minimal level of \nobjective justification needed for a detention or a seizure); Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 497-\n6 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS-HBP   Document 241    Filed 12/15/12   Page 8 of 11\n98 (1983) (where officer approaches individual without reasonable suspicion or probable cause, \nindividual has the right to ignore the police and go about his business); PIs. 56.1 ~ 19.  And as \nthis Court recognized in its ruling on the City's and NYCHA's most recent motions for summary \njudgment, \"[t]here is no probable cause to arrest a person if the only facts known to the police \nare that the person says she does not live in the building and refuses to say more about her \nlicense or privilege to be there.\"  Davis v.  City of New  York,  No.  10  Civ.  0699,  2012 WL \n4813837, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 9,  2012).  \"[I]t is the state's burden to prove that an invitee does \nnot have privilege or license to remain on the premises.\"  Id.  at *13.  Nevertheless, the City's \npolicy improperly shifts the burden to the person being questioned by the police to affirmatively \njustify his or her license to be on the premises. \nThe City's policy also empowers NYPD officers, as purported custodians of NYCHA \nproperty,  to  approach  anyone  they  believe  \"may be  violating  Housing  Authority  rules  and \nregulations,  including potentially unauthorized persons,\"  and  expel  on pain of arrest not just \nthose who refuse to justify their presence, but also those who fail to justify it to the satisfacation \nof the officer.  PIs. 56.1 ~ 10.  Courts have struck down statutes in similar circumstances where a \ncitizen was required to \"identify himself' or \"give a reasonably credible account of his conduct \nand purposes,\" holding that they invite arbitrary enforcement because the \"enforcement of [such \na policy] depends entirely upon whether the arresting officer is satisfied that a suspect has given \nan acceptable account of his presence.\"  People v.  Bright, 71 N.Y.2d 376, 385 (1988) (citations \nand  internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  Here,  where  there  are  also  \"no  standard[s]  for \ndetermining what a suspect has to do  in order to  satisfy the requirement,\" the City's policy \nimpermissibly vests \"virtually complete discretion in the hands of the police.\"  Id.  (citations and \ninternally quotation marks omitted).  See United States v.  Buenaventura-Ariza, 615 F.2d 29, 31 \n7 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS-HBP   Document 241    Filed 12/15/12   Page 9 of 11\n(2d Cir.  1980) (\"[T]here must be a line separating investigatory stops supported by 'specific, \nobjective facts' from those stops occurring essentially at the 'unfeterred discretion of officers in \nthe field\" (quoting Brown, 443 U.S. at 51)). \nThat an NYPD officer purports to act as NYCHA's custodian or agent when issuing a \ndispersal  order  does  not  vitiate  the  Fourth  Amendment's  protections  against  an  officer's \nunfettered discretion.  See  United States v.  Santiago,  950 F.Supp.  590,  596 (S.D.N.Y.  1996) \n(policy for conducting safety checks involving livery taxi impermissible where it \"results in an \nend  run  around  the  Fourth  Amendment\").  The  NYPD  officers  patrolling  public  housing \nresidences are  not akin to  doormen or other custodians in  private buildings:  Unlike private \nindividuals or security guards,  officers must comply with the Fourth Amendment and cannot \ncircumvent constitutional constraints merely because they are acting on behalf of NYCHA.  The \nCity's policy, if left in place, will affect hundreds of thousands oflaw-abiding New Yorkers who \ncall NYCHA home,  as well  as their family  and  friends,  by  subjecting them to constitutional \nviolations for merely living in or visiting public housing. \nCONCLUSION \nFor all  of the  foregoing  reasons,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request that this  Court grant \nPlaintiffs'  motion  for  partial  summary  judgment  against  the  City  on  Plaintiffs'  Fourth \nAmendment claim. \n8 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS-HBP   Document 241    Filed 12/15/12   Page 10 of 11\nDated:  New York, New York \nDecember 14, 2012 \nNAACP LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATIONAL \nFUND, INC. \nBy:  sf Johanna B.

MUTUAL AGREEMENT OF PRINCIPLES \n1.  The Parties agree that NYCHA residents and their authorized visitors have \nthe same legal rights as the residents and authorized visitors of any other residential building in \n6 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-AT-HBP   Document 330   Filed 02/04/15   Page 7 of 20\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS-HBP  Document 322-1  Filed 01/07/15  Page 7 of 20 \nNew York City,  and deserve the utmost courtesy and respect during their interactions with \nNYPD officers. \n2.  The Parties agree that further development of cooperative and trusting \nrelationships between NYPD officers and NYCHA residents facilitates effective policing, and \nthat negative interactions between NYPD officers and NYCHA residents and their authorized \nvisitors can have a long-lasting, harmful impact on those relationships. \n3.  The  Parties  agree  that the  secured  access  of building  entryways  and \neffective  policing within the  building  are  important to  maintain the  safety  and  security  of \nNY CHA residences. \n4.  The  Parties  agree  that  in  performing  patrols  in  or  around  NYCHA \nresidences, the NYPD's primary role is to  provide a safe and secure living environment for \nNY CHA residents and their guests. \n5.  The Parties agree that the proper enforcement of New York State trespass \nlaw is an important component of the maintenance and security ofNYCHA residences. \n6.  The Parties agree that the enforcement of New York State trespass law \nmust, at all times, comply with the United States Constitution and all other relevant state and \nfederal laws. \n(a)  Plaintiffs and the City agree that NYPD officers must have at least \nan \"objective credible reason\" in order to approach any person in \nor around a NYCHA residence, and that simply entering, being in, \nor exiting a NYCHA residence does not constitute an \"objective \ncredible reason.\" \n7 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-AT-HBP   Document 330   Filed 02/04/15   Page 8 of 20\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS-HBP  Document 322-1  Filed 01/07/15  Page 8 of 20 \n(b)  Plaintiffs  and  the  City  agree  that  NYPD  officers  who  request \ninformation from any person in or around a NYCHA residence, \nbased on an \"objective credible reason,\" as defined in People v. De \nBour, 40 N.Y.2d 210 (1976) and its progeny, cannot question that \nperson in an accusatory manner. \n( c)  Plaintiffs  and  the  City  agree  that NYPD  officers  must have  a \n\"founded suspicion\" of criminal activity, as defined in People v. \nDe Bour, 40 N.Y.2d 210 (1976) and its progeny, in order to ask \nany person in or around a NYCHA residence pointed or accusatory \nquestions that would cause a person to reasonably believe that he \nor she  is  suspected of a  crime,  but officers may not ask  such \nquestions in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to \nbelieve that he or she cannot terminate the encounter and walk \naway. \n(d )  Plaintiffs  and  the  City  agree  that NYPD  officers  must  have  a \n\"reasonable suspicion\" of criminal activity in order to stop and/or \ndetain any person in or around a NYCHA residence such that a \nreasonable person would believe that he or she cannot terminate \nthe encounter and walk away. \n(e)  Plaintiffs  and  the  City  agree  that  NYPD  officers  must  have \n\"probable cause\" of criminal activity in order to arrest any person \nin or around a NYCHA residence. \n8 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-AT-HBP   Document 330   Filed 02/04/15   Page 9 of 20\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS-HBP  Document 322-1  Filed 01/07/15  Page 9 of 20 \n7.  The  Parties  agree  that  it  is  imperative  to  have  rules,  policies,  and \nprocedures to prevent NYCHA residents and their authorized guests from being subjected to a \nrequest for information without objective credible reasons, accusatory questions without founded \nsuspicion that criminal activity is afoot,  stops or detentions without reasonable suspicion, or \narrests without probable cause. \n8.  The  Parties  agree  that  proper  and  sufficient  training,  supervision, \nmonitoring, and disciplining of NYPD  officers are  necessary to prevent unlawful stops and \narrests in or around NYCHA residences. \nD.

The revisions to the Trespass Crime Fact Sheet, to which both Plaintiffs \nand the City agree, are attached as Exhibit F to this Stipulation. \nG.  REVISIONS TO NYCHA'S HOUSE RULES \n1.  Plaintiffs and NYCHA have negotiated revisions to the terms of the House \nRules regarding cooperation with NYPD inquiries and the prohibition against lingering. \n2.

Plaintiffs and the City stipulate that, for purposes of resolving Plaintiffs' \nclaims  in  the  above-captioned  action,  the  Court-Ordered  Monitoring  related  to  trespass \nenforcement in or around NYCHA residences will be identical to the Court Ordered Monitoring \n10 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-AT-HBP   Document 330   Filed 02/04/15   Page 11 of 20\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS-HBP  Document 322-1  Filed 01/07/15  Page 11of20 \nin the Floyd Remedies Opinion, including the duration of the Court-Ordered Monitoring.

SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.: \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nIn an Opinion issued today 1 found the City of New York liable in the Floyd case \nfor violating the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the plaintiff class because of the \nway the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") has conducted stops and frisks over the \npast decade (the \"Liability Opinion\").  In an Opinion issued in January 2013, I found that the \nLigon plaintiffs, representing a putative class of people stopped outside buildings participating in \n1  \n\nCC(cid:38)aa(cid:68)ss(cid:86)ee(cid:72)  1(cid:3)1(cid:20)::1(cid:29)1(cid:19)00(cid:27)--(cid:16)cc(cid:70)vv(cid:89)--(cid:16)00(cid:19)00(cid:20)66(cid:19)99(cid:22)99(cid:23)--(cid:16)SA(cid:54)AT(cid:36)S-(cid:54)H-(cid:16)HB(cid:43)BP(cid:37)P (cid:51)   D (cid:3) (cid:3)D(cid:3)o(cid:39)co(cid:82)uc(cid:70)mu(cid:88)me(cid:80)ne(cid:72)tn (cid:81)3t (cid:87)33(cid:3)(cid:22)02(cid:26)-21(cid:21)- (cid:3)2 (cid:3) (cid:3) F(cid:3) (cid:41) iFl(cid:76)e(cid:79)i(cid:72)lde(cid:71) d0(cid:3)(cid:19) 20(cid:27)/10(cid:18)(cid:20)/40(cid:21)/71(cid:18)(cid:20)/51(cid:22) 5 (cid:3) (cid:3) P(cid:3) (cid:51) Pa(cid:68)ga(cid:74)eg(cid:72) e3(cid:3)(cid:21)  3o(cid:3)(cid:82) fo (cid:73)1(cid:3)f(cid:22) 44(cid:28)40\nthe Trespass Affidavit Program (“TAP”) in the Bronx, were entitled to preliminary injunctive\nrelief based on violations of their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nThe purpose of this Opinion (the “Remedies Opinion”) is to determine what\nremedies are appropriate in these cases.  I address both cases in one Opinion because the\nremedies necessarily overlap.  Each requires that the NYPD reform practices and policies related\nto stop and frisk to conform with the requirements of the United States Constitution.  I stress, at\nthe outset, that the remedies imposed in this Opinion are as narrow and targeted as possible.  To\nbe very clear: I am not ordering an end to the practice of stop and frisk.  The purpose of the\nremedies addressed in this Opinion is to ensure that the practice is carried out in a manner that\nprotects the rights and liberties of all New Yorkers, while still providing much needed police\nprotection.\nII. REMEDIES IN FLOYD\nA. The Court Has the Power to Order Broad Equitable Relief\n1. Plaintiffs Satisfied the Requirements for a Permanent Injunction\nPlaintiffs seeking a permanent injunction must demonstrate: (1) that they have\nsuffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are\ninadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between\nthe plaintiffs and the defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest\nwould not be disserved by a permanent injunction.1  Plaintiffs may satisfy the first two factors by\ndemonstrating that they are likely to be deprived of their constitutional rights in the future by the\n1 See World Wide Polymers, Inc. v.

That is, the burden on the plaintiff class of continued unconstitutional stops and frisks\nfar outweighs the administrative hardships that the NYPD will face in correcting its\nunconstitutional practices.4\nThe right to physical liberty has long been at the core of our nation’s\ncommitment to respecting the autonomy and dignity of each person:  “No\nright is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law,\nthan the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own\nperson, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and\nunquestionable authority of law.”5\n2 See New York State Nat’l Org. for Women v.

In addition to the significant intrusion on liberty that results\nfrom any stop, increased contact with the police leads to increased opportunities for arrest, even\nwhen the reason for the arrest was not the reason for the stop.  As a result, targeting racially\ndefined groups for stops —  even when there is reasonable suspicion —  perpetuates the\nstubborn racial disparities in our criminal justice system.6  Although the costs of complying with\nthe permanent injunction in Floyd will be significant, they are clearly outweighed by the urgent\nneed to curb the constitutional abuses described in the Liability Opinion.\nWith regard to the public interest, the City has expressed concern that interference\nin the NYPD’s stop and frisk practices may have a detrimental effect on crime control.7 \nHowever, as previously noted, I am not ordering an end to stop and frisk.  Moreover, it has been\nwidely reported that as the number of recorded stops has decreased over the past year, the crime\n6 See, e.g., MICHELLE ALEXANDER, THE NEW JIM CROW 6–7 (2010) (“No other\ncountry in the world imprisons so many of its racial or ethnic minorities. . . .  In Washington,\nD.C., . . . it is estimated that three out of four young black men (and nearly all those in the\npoorest neighborhoods) can expect to serve time in prison.”).  Another collateral consequence of\nstops was highlighted in the recently settled case of Lino v. City of New York, No. 106579/10,\n2011 WL 2610501 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Co. June 24, 2011), in which the NYPD agreed to purge\npersonal information from its stop database.

Fostering trust in the police will “promote, rather than hinder,\n[the] NYPD’s mission of safely and effectively fighting crime.”10\nFurthermore, as in Ligon, it is “‘clear and plain’” that the public interest in liberty\nand dignity under the Fourth Amendment, and the public interest in equality under the\nFourteenth Amendment, trumps whatever modicum of added safety might theoretically be\ngained by the NYPD making unconstitutional stops and frisks.11  This Opinion does not call for\nthe NYPD to abandon proactive policing and return to an earlier era of less effective police\npractices.  Rather, the relief ordered below requires the NYPD to be even more proactive: \n8  See, e.g., Tamer El-Ghobashy & Michael Howard Saul, New York Police Use of\nStop-and-Frisk Drops: Plummet in Disputed Tactic Tracks Overall Decrease in Crime, WALL\nST.

I note,\nhowever, that the number of unrecorded stops may have increased over the same period as a\nresult of misleading training at the NYPD’s new stop and frisk refresher course at Rodman’s\nNeck.

Equitable Relief\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d) requires that “[e]very order granting an\ninjunction . . . must: (A) state the reasons why it issued; (B) state its terms specifically; and (C)\ndescribe in reasonable detail — and not by referring to the complaint or other document — the\nact or acts restrained or required.”23  These specificity provisions are “‘no mere technical\nrequirements,’” but were “‘designed to prevent uncertainty and confusion on the part of those\nfaced with injunctive orders, and to avoid the possible founding of a contempt citation on a\n21 6/12/13 Defendant’s Post-Trial Memorandum of Law (“Def. Mem.”) at 24–25. \nAccord Def. Inj. Mem. at 7–18.  The City also argues that no remedy is required because\nimproper stops can be addressed by individual suits for damages.  See Def. Inj. Mem. at 6.  The\nDOJ counters that if individual suits were an effective remedy for police misconduct, courts\nwould not have found it necessary to impose injunctive relief in so many police misconduct\ncases.  See DOJ Inj. Mem. at 9 & n.5 (also citing arguments from Daryl J. Levinson, Making\nGovernment Pay: Markets, Politics, and the Allocation of Constitutional Costs, 67 U. CHI. L.\nREV. 345, 354–57 (2000)).  I note that individual suits for damages are particularly ineffective as\na remedy for unconstitutional stops, where individuals often do not know what the basis for their\nstop was, and thus cannot know whether the stop lacked a legal basis or was influenced\nimproperly by race.  In addition, while the indignity of an unconstitutional stop is a serious harm,\nfew of those stopped will be motivated to dedicate their time and resources to filing a lawsuit —\nespecially where the standard for recovery may require proof of Monell liability.\n22 See, e.g., Bailey v.

Mem. at 9 (noting DOJ settlement agreements and consent decrees with\ndozens of law enforcement agencies nationwide).  The City’s resistance to reform in this case\nmay reflect a more general skepticism toward judicial interpretation of the Constitution and the\nlimits it imposes on municipalities.

Thus, while the sections below refer to NYPD documents\nthat must be revised, the ordered relief is contained entirely within the four corners of this\nOpinion.27\n1. Appointment of a Monitor to Oversee Reforms\nBecause of the complexity of the reforms that will be required to bring the\nNYPD’s stop and frisk practices into compliance with the Constitution, it would be impractical\nfor this Court to engage in direct oversight of the reforms.

A court-appointed monitor in this case would help the Court ensure\nthat . . . any pattern or practice . . . is effectively and sustainably remedied.30\nThe appointment of a monitor will serve the interests of all stakeholders, including the City, by\nfacilitating the early and unbiased detection of non-compliance or barriers to compliance.  By\nidentifying problems promptly, the Monitor will save the City time and resources.31\nI also note that the Monitor will have a distinct function from the other oversight\nentities identified by the City, such as the NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau, federal prosecutors,\nthe Civilian Complaint Review Board, and “the public electorate.”32  The Monitor will be\nspecifically and narrowly focused on the City’s compliance with reforming the NYPD’s use of\nstop and frisk — although this will inevitably touch on issues of training, supervision,\nmonitoring, and discipline.  Finally, the Monitor will operate in close coordination with this\n30 DOJ Inj.

The Monitor’s duties,\nresponsibilities, and authority will be no broader than necessary to end the constitutional\nviolations in the NYPD’s stop and frisk practices described in the Liability Opinion.  \n3. The Monitor’s initial responsibility will be to develop, based on consultation with the\nparties, a set of reforms of the NYPD’s policies, training, supervision, monitoring, and\ndiscipline regarding stop and frisk.  These reforms (the “Immediate Reforms”) are\noutlined below in Part II.A.2.  They will be developed as soon as practicable and\nimplemented when they are approved by the Court.\n4. After the completion of the Joint Remedial Process, described below in Part II.A.4, the\nMonitor will work with the Facilitator and the parties to develop any further reforms\nnecessary to ending the constitutional violations described in the Liability Opinion. \nThese reforms (“Joint Process Reforms”) will be implemented upon approval by the\nCourt.\n5. The Monitor will inform the City of the milestones the City must achieve in order to\ndemonstrate compliance and bring the monitoring process to an end.\n6. The Monitor will regularly conduct compliance and progress reviews to assess the extent\n33 The Monitor’s role will also be distinct from the broad advisory role of the NYPD\nInspector General envisioned in N.Y.

The Monitor will work with the parties to address any barriers to compliance.  To the\nextent possible, the Monitor should strive to develop a collaborative rather than\nadversarial relationship with the City.\n9. The Monitor may request the Court to modify the Immediate and Joint Process Reforms,\nif evidence shows that such modifications are warranted.\n10. The Monitor may request technical assistance from outside experts.  He may also employ\nstaff assistance as he finds reasonable and necessary.  \n11.

Encounters\ninvolving nothing more than commands or accusatory questions can and routinely do rise to the\nlevel of stops, provided that the commands and questions would lead a reasonable person to\nconclude that he was not free to terminate the encounter.38\nIn order to conduct a stop, an officer must have individualized, reasonable\nsuspicion that the person stopped has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. \nThe officer must be able to articulate facts establishing a minimal level of objective justification\n37 See Liability Opinion at Part III.B; Ligon, 2013 WL 628534, at *41–42.\n38 There could be a simple way to ensure that officers do not unintentionally violate\nthe Fourth Amendment rights of pedestrians by approaching them without reasonable suspicion\nand then inadvertently treating them in such a way that a reasonable person would not feel free\nto leave.  Officers could, for example, begin De Bour Level 1 and 2 encounters by informing the\nperson that he or she is free to leave.  There is no constitutional requirement for officers to\ninform people that they are free to leave.  Cf. Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U.S. 33, 35 (1996) (holding\nthat the Fourth Amendment does not require “that a lawfully seized defendant must be advised\nthat he is ‘free to go’ before his consent to search will be recognized as voluntary”); Schneckloth\nv. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 227 (1973) (“While knowledge of the right to refuse consent is one\nfactor to be taken into account, the government need not establish such knowledge as the sine\nqua non of an effective consent.”).  Nevertheless, the Constitution does not prohibit a police\ndepartment from adopting this policy or a court from ordering it as a means of avoiding\nunconstitutional stops, where — as here — officers have been incorrectly trained on the\ndefinition of a stop.\n15\n\nCC(cid:38)aa(cid:68)ss(cid:86)ee(cid:72)  1(cid:3)1(cid:20)::1(cid:29)1(cid:19)00(cid:27)--(cid:16)cc(cid:70)vv(cid:89)--(cid:16)00(cid:19)00(cid:20)66(cid:19)99(cid:22)99(cid:23)--(cid:16)SA(cid:54)AT(cid:36)S-(cid:54)H-(cid:16)HB(cid:43)BP(cid:37)P (cid:51)   D (cid:3) (cid:3)D(cid:3)o(cid:39)co(cid:82)uc(cid:70)mu(cid:88)me(cid:80)ne(cid:72)tn (cid:81)3t (cid:87)33(cid:3)(cid:22)02(cid:26)-21(cid:21)- (cid:3)2 (cid:3) (cid:3) F(cid:3) (cid:41) iFl(cid:76)e(cid:79)i(cid:72)lde(cid:71) d0(cid:3)(cid:19) 20(cid:27)/10(cid:18)(cid:20)/40(cid:21)/71(cid:18)(cid:20)/51(cid:22) 5 (cid:3) (cid:3) P(cid:3) (cid:51) Pa(cid:68)ga(cid:74)eg(cid:72) e1(cid:3)(cid:20) 71(cid:25) 7o(cid:3)(cid:82) fo (cid:73)1(cid:3)f(cid:22) 44(cid:28)40\nfor making the stop, which means more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or\nhunch.  “Furtive movements” are an insufficient basis for a stop or frisk if the officer cannot\narticulate anything more specific about the suspicious nature of the movement.  The same is true\nof merely being present in a “high crime area.”  Moreover, no person may be stopped solely\nbecause he matches a vague or generalized description — such as young black male 18 to 24 —\nwithout further detail or indicia of reliability.\nTo proceed from a stop to a frisk, the police officer must reasonably suspect that\nthe person stopped is armed and dangerous.  The purpose of a frisk is not to discover evidence\nof crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence.  Thus, the\nfrisk must be strictly limited to whatever is necessary to uncover weapons that could harm the\nofficer or others nearby.  When an officer lawfully pats down a suspect’s outer clothing and feels\nan object whose contour or mass makes its identity as contraband immediately apparent, the\nofficer may seize the contraband.  If an officer reasonably suspects that a felt object in the\nclothing of a suspect is a weapon, then the officer may take whatever action is necessary to\nexamine the object and protect himself, including removing the object from the clothing of the\nstopped person.\nThe erroneous or misleading training materials identified in the Liability Opinion\nmust be corrected, including the Police Student Guide’s overbroad definition of “furtive\nbehavior;” the misleading training on “unusual firearms” implying that the presence of a wallet,\ncell phone, or pen could justify a frisk, or search; the complete lack of training on the\nconstitutional standard for a frisk — reasonable suspicion that a stopped person is “armed and\ndangerous;” and the failure to include self-initiated stops (which make up 78% of street stops) in\n16\n\nCC(cid:38)aa(cid:68)ss(cid:86)ee(cid:72)  1(cid:3)1(cid:20)::1(cid:29)1(cid:19)00(cid:27)--(cid:16)cc(cid:70)vv(cid:89)--(cid:16)00(cid:19)00(cid:20)66(cid:19)99(cid:22)99(cid:23)--(cid:16)SA(cid:54)AT(cid:36)S-(cid:54)H-(cid:16)HB(cid:43)BP(cid:37)P (cid:51)   D (cid:3) (cid:3)D(cid:3)o(cid:39)co(cid:82)uc(cid:70)mu(cid:88)me(cid:80)ne(cid:72)tn (cid:81)3t (cid:87)33(cid:3)(cid:22)02(cid:26)-21(cid:21)- (cid:3)2 (cid:3) (cid:3) F(cid:3) (cid:41) iFl(cid:76)e(cid:79)i(cid:72)lde(cid:71) d0(cid:3)(cid:19) 20(cid:27)/10(cid:18)(cid:20)/40(cid:21)/71(cid:18)(cid:20)/51(cid:22) 5 (cid:3) (cid:3) P(cid:3) (cid:51) Pa(cid:68)ga(cid:74)eg(cid:72) e1(cid:3)(cid:20) 81(cid:26) 8o(cid:3)(cid:82) fo (cid:73)1(cid:3)f(cid:22) 44(cid:28)40\nthe role-playing at Rodman’s Neck.39  These training reforms will be in addition to those\ndiscussed below in the section of this Opinion relating to Ligon.40\nSecond, the NYPD should revise its policies and training regarding racial\nprofiling to make clear that targeting “the right people” for stops, as described in the Liability\nOpinion, is a form of racial profiling and violates the Constitution.41  Racially defined groups\nmay not be targeted for stops in general simply because they appear more frequently in local\ncrime suspect data.  Race may only be considered where the stop is based on a specific and\nreliable suspect description.  When an officer carries out a stop based on reasonable suspicion\nthat a person fits such a description, the officer may consider the race of the suspect, just as the\nofficer may consider the suspect’s height or hair color.  When a stop is not based on a specific\nsuspect description, however, race may not be either a motivation or a justification for the stop. \nIn particular, officers must cease the targeting of young black and Hispanic males for stops\nbased on the appearance of these groups in crime complaints.  It may also be appropriate to\nconduct training for officers on the effect of unconscious racial bias.\nThird, it is unclear at this stage whether Operations Order 52 (“OO 52”), which\ndescribes the use of performance objectives to motivate officers, requires revision in order to\nbring the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk into compliance with the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendments.  The evidence at trial showed that OO 52’s use of “performance goals” created\npressure to carry out stops, without any system for monitoring the constitutionality of those\n39 See Liability Opinion at Part IV.C.5.\n40 See infra Part III.\n41 See Liability Opinion at Parts IV.C.3, V.B.1.\n17\n\nCC(cid:38)aa(cid:68)ss(cid:86)ee(cid:72)  1(cid:3)1(cid:20)::1(cid:29)1(cid:19)00(cid:27)--(cid:16)cc(cid:70)vv(cid:89)--(cid:16)00(cid:19)00(cid:20)66(cid:19)99(cid:22)99(cid:23)--(cid:16)SA(cid:54)AT(cid:36)S-(cid:54)H-(cid:16)HB(cid:43)BP(cid:37)P (cid:51)   D (cid:3) (cid:3)D(cid:3)o(cid:39)co(cid:82)uc(cid:70)mu(cid:88)me(cid:80)ne(cid:72)tn (cid:81)3t (cid:87)33(cid:3)(cid:22)02(cid:26)-21(cid:21)- (cid:3)2 (cid:3) (cid:3) F(cid:3) (cid:41) iFl(cid:76)e(cid:79)i(cid:72)lde(cid:71) d0(cid:3)(cid:19) 20(cid:27)/10(cid:18)(cid:20)/40(cid:21)/71(cid:18)(cid:20)/51(cid:22) 5 (cid:3) (cid:3) P(cid:3) (cid:51) Pa(cid:68)ga(cid:74)eg(cid:72) e1(cid:3)(cid:20) 91(cid:27) 9o(cid:3)(cid:82) fo (cid:73)1(cid:3)f(cid:22) 44(cid:28)40\nstops.  However, the use of performance goals in relation to stops may be appropriate, once an\neffective system for ensuring constitutionality is in place.42  Because the perspective of police\nofficers and police organizations will be particularly valuable to clarifying the role of\nperformance goals in the reform of stop and frisk, these issues should be addressed as part of the\nJoint Remedial Process rather than the Immediate Reforms.\nFinally, I note that where legitimate uncertainty exists regarding the most\nefficient means of reform, and the parties have differing views, it may be feasible for the\nMonitor to test the alternatives by applying them in different precincts and studying the results. \nIn some contexts, the size of the NYPD makes it possible, and desirable, to resolve practical\ndisagreements through the rigorous testing and analysis of alternatives at the precinct level\nbefore applying these reforms to the department as a whole.\nb.

Quarterly audits of\nthese memo book entries have revealed significant deficiencies in record keeping practices in\nvirtually every precinct throughout the City.44  The proper use of activity logs to record stop and\nfrisk activity must be emphasized in training, as well as enforced through supervision and\ndiscipline.  I first address the UF-250 and then the activity logs.\ni. UF-250 \nAs described in the Liability Opinion, the current UF-250 consists mainly of\ncheckboxes that officers can and often do check by rote,45 thus facilitating post-hoc justifications\nfor stops where none may have existed at the time of the stop.  The UF-250 must be revised to\ninclude a narrative section where the officer must record, in her own words, the basis for the\nstop.  The narrative will enable meaningful supervisory oversight of the officer’s decision to\nconduct the stop, as well as create a record for a later review of constitutionality.\nAs an independent monitor of the New Orleans Police Department (“NOPD”)\nrecently noted, “the overwhelming belief of experts [is] that a narrative field in which the\nofficers describe the circumstances for each stop would be the best way to gather information\nthat will be used to analyze reasonable suspicion” and, relatedly, “prevent[] racially biased\n43 See 5/16 Tr. at 7457 (Walker).\n44 See Pl.

The evidence at trial revealed that people were routinely\nsubjected to these intrusions when no objective facts supported reasonable suspicion that they\nwere armed and dangerous.  It is apparent that some officers consider frisks to be a routine part\nof a stop.  Because this misconception is contrary to law, the revised UF-250 should include a\nseparate section requiring officers to explain why the stopped person was suspected of being\n46 SUSAN HUTSON, INDEPENDENT POLICE MONITOR, REVIEW OF THE NEW ORLEANS\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT’S FIELD INTERVIEW POLICIES, PRACTICES, AND DATA: FINAL REPORT 45\n(Mar. 12, 2013) (footnote omitted).\n47 Id. at 46.\n48 Id.\n49 See id.\n50 See 5/16 Tr. at 7456–7458 (Walker).

It may also be necessary to reduce the\nnumber of “stop factor” boxes in order to permit easier analyses of patterns in the\nconstitutionality of stops.53\nIn addition to changing the UF-250, officers should be further trained in its use. \nAs discussed in the Liability Opinion, some officers check certain boxes (or combinations of\nboxes) reflexively as part of “scripts,” including “Furtive Movements” and “Area Has High\n51 See Pl.

Activity Logs\nAll uniformed officers are required to provide narrative descriptions of stops in\ntheir activity logs whenever a UF-250 is prepared.55  In practice, this does not take place. \nEvidence at trial showed that throughout the class period, officers consistently failed to record\nstops in their logs, or provided insufficient detail for a supervisor to meaningfully review the\nconstitutionality of the stop.  This problem is best addressed through training, supervision, and\nmonitoring.56\n54 Suspicious Bulge is another factor — albeit less often used than Furtive\nMovements and High Crime Area — that should require greater specificity or a narrative\ndescription.\n55 See Operations Order 44 (9/11/08), PX 96.  In addition, the Chief of Patrol\nrecently directed all officers in the patrol borough to include nine categories of information in\nevery activity log entry for a stop.  The categories include: the date, time and location of the\nstop; the name and pedigree of the person stopped; the suspected felony or penal law\nmisdemeanor; an explanation of the suspicion that led to the stop (such as “looking into\nwindows,” or “pulling on doorknobs”); whether the suspect was frisked; the sprint or job\nnumber, if applicable; and the disposition of the stop.  The Chief of Patrol’s memo also requires\nofficers to elaborate the basis for a stop in the “Additional Circumstances/Factors” section of the\nUF-250, to photocopy every activity log entry for a stop, and to attach the photocopy to the UF-\n250 before submitting it to a supervisor.  See DX J13.\n56 See infra Part II.B.2.c.  I recognize the risk of inefficiency if officers record the\nsame information on UF-250s and in their activity logs.

The NYPD is further ordered, again with\nthe assistance of the Monitor, to ensure that activity logs are completed with the required\nspecificity, and to implement measures to adequately discipline officers who fail to comply with\nthese requirements.\nc. Changes to Supervision, Monitoring, and Discipline\nAn essential aspect of the Joint Process Reforms will be the development of an\nimproved system for monitoring, supervision, and discipline.  Professor Walker testified that\ncomprehensive reforms may be necessary to ensure the constitutionality of stops, including\nrevisions to written policies and training materials, improved documentation of stops and frisks,\ndirect supervision and review of stop documentation by sergeants, indirect supervision and\nreview by more senior supervisors and managers, improved citizen complaint procedures,\nimproved disciplinary procedures, department-wide audits, and perhaps even an early\nintervention system based on a centralized source of information regarding officer misconduct. \nAccording to Professor Walker, “[a] comprehensive approach is absolutely essential, because if\nany one of the components is absent or weak and ineffective, the entire accountability system\nbegins to collapse.”57\n57 5/15 Tr. at 7440.

However, to the extent that the Monitor can\nwork with the parties to develop reforms that can be implemented immediately, the Monitor is\nencouraged to include those reforms in the proposed Immediate Reforms.  \nFor example, based on the findings in the Liability Opinion, there is an urgent\nneed for the NYPD to institute policies specifically requiring sergeants who witness, review, or\ndiscuss stops to address not only the effectiveness but also the constitutionality of those stops,\nand to do so in a thorough and comprehensive manner.58  To the extent that Integrity Control\nOfficers witness or review stops, they too must be instructed to review for constitutionality.59 \nThe Department Advocate’s Office must improve its procedures for imposing discipline in\nresponse to the Civilian Complaint Review Board’s (“CCRB”) findings of substantiated\nmisconduct during stops.  This improvement must include increased deference to credibility\ndeterminations by the CCRB, an evidentiary standard that is neutral between the claims of\ncomplainants and officers, and no general requirement of corroborating physical evidence. \nFinally, the Office of the Chief of Department must begin tracking and investigating complaints\npurpose not only as policing effectively, but policing constitutionally as well.  If so, the NIJ’s\nfirst recommendation for improving the integrity of a department is to “[a]ddress and discipline\nminor offenses so officers learn that major offenses will be disciplined too.”  Id. \n58 See Liability Opinion at Part IV.C.4.b.\n59 See id.\n24\n\nCC(cid:38)aa(cid:68)ss(cid:86)ee(cid:72)  1(cid:3)1(cid:20)::1(cid:29)1(cid:19)00(cid:27)--(cid:16)cc(cid:70)vv(cid:89)--(cid:16)00(cid:19)00(cid:20)66(cid:19)99(cid:22)99(cid:23)--(cid:16)SA(cid:54)AT(cid:36)S-(cid:54)H-(cid:16)HB(cid:43)BP(cid:37)P (cid:51)   D (cid:3) (cid:3)D(cid:3)o(cid:39)co(cid:82)uc(cid:70)mu(cid:88)me(cid:80)ne(cid:72)tn (cid:81)3t (cid:87)33(cid:3)(cid:22)02(cid:26)-21(cid:21)- (cid:3)2 (cid:3) (cid:3) F(cid:3) (cid:41) iFl(cid:76)e(cid:79)i(cid:72)lde(cid:71) d0(cid:3)(cid:19) 20(cid:27)/10(cid:18)(cid:20)/40(cid:21)/71(cid:18)(cid:20)/51(cid:22) 5 (cid:3) (cid:3) P(cid:3) (cid:51) Pa(cid:68)ga(cid:74)eg(cid:72) e2(cid:3)(cid:21) 62(cid:24) 6o(cid:3)(cid:82) fo (cid:73)1(cid:3)f(cid:22) 44(cid:28)40\nit receives related to racial profiling.60\nd. FINEST Message\nAs soon as practicable, the NYPD should transmit a FINEST message explaining\nthe outcome of the Floyd litigation and the need for the reforms described above.61  The FINEST\nmessage should summarize in simple and clear terms the basic constitutional standards\ngoverning stop and frisk, the constitutional standard prohibiting racial profiling, and the relation\nbetween these standards and New York state law.  The message should order all NYPD\npersonnel to comply immediately with those standards.\n3. Body-Worn Cameras\nThe subject of police officers wearing “body-worn cameras” was inadvertently\nraised during the testimony of the City’s policing expert, James K. Stewart.  The following\ndiscussion took place:\nA. . . . But what happens is the departments a lot of times may not have . . .\nexpertise and they may need some technical assistance like body worn\ncameras is an example and how much technology and where you store the\ninformation and stuff like that.

In evaluating the constitutionality of individual stops, I\nexplained the difficulty of judging in hindsight what happened during an encounter between a\ncivilian and the police.63  The only contemporaneous records of the stops in this case were UF-\n250s and short memo book entries — which were sometimes not prepared directly after a stop,\nand which are inherently one-sided.  Thus, I was forced to analyze the constitutionality of the\nstops based on testimony given years after the encounter, at a time when the participants’\nmemories were likely colored by their interest in the outcome of the case and the passage of\ntime.  The NYPD’s duty to monitor stop and frisk activity is similarly hamstrung by supervisors’\ninability to review an objective representation of what occurred.64 \nVideo recordings will serve a variety of useful functions.  First, they will provide\na contemporaneous, objective record of stops and frisks, allowing for the review of officer\nconduct by supervisors and the courts.  The recordings may either confirm or refute the belief of\nsome minorities that they have been stopped simply as a result of their race, or based on the\nclothes they wore, such as baggy pants or a hoodie.65  Second, the knowledge that an exchange is\nbeing recorded will encourage lawful and respectful interactions on the part of both parties.66 \nThird, the recordings will diminish the sense on the part of those who file complaints that it is\n63 See Liability Opinion at Part IV.D.\n64 See id. at Part IV.C.4.\n65 By creating an irrefutable record of what occurred during stops, video recordings\nmay help lay to rest disagreements that would otherwise remain unresolved.\n66 If, in fact, the police do, on occasion, use offensive language —  including racial\nslurs — or act with more force than necessary, the use of body-worn cameras will inevitably\nreduce such behavior.\n26\n\nCC(cid:38)aa(cid:68)ss(cid:86)ee(cid:72)  1(cid:3)1(cid:20)::1(cid:29)1(cid:19)00(cid:27)--(cid:16)cc(cid:70)vv(cid:89)--(cid:16)00(cid:19)00(cid:20)66(cid:19)99(cid:22)99(cid:23)--(cid:16)SA(cid:54)AT(cid:36)S-(cid:54)H-(cid:16)HB(cid:43)BP(cid:37)P (cid:51)   D (cid:3) (cid:3)D(cid:3)o(cid:39)co(cid:82)uc(cid:70)mu(cid:88)me(cid:80)ne(cid:72)tn (cid:81)3t (cid:87)33(cid:3)(cid:22)02(cid:26)-21(cid:21)- (cid:3)2 (cid:3) (cid:3) F(cid:3) (cid:41) iFl(cid:76)e(cid:79)i(cid:72)lde(cid:71) d0(cid:3)(cid:19) 20(cid:27)/10(cid:18)(cid:20)/40(cid:21)/71(cid:18)(cid:20)/51(cid:22) 5 (cid:3) (cid:3) P(cid:3) (cid:51) Pa(cid:68)ga(cid:74)eg(cid:72) e2(cid:3)(cid:21) 82(cid:26) 8o(cid:3)(cid:82) fo (cid:73)1(cid:3)f(cid:22) 44(cid:28)40\ntheir word against the police, and that the authorities are more likely to believe the police.67 \nThus, the recordings should also alleviate some of the mistrust that has developed between the\npolice and the black and Hispanic communities, based on the belief that stops and frisks are\noverwhelmingly and unjustifiably directed at members of these communities. Video recordings\nwill be equally helpful to members of the NYPD who are wrongly accused of inappropriate\nbehavior. \nBecause body-worn cameras are uniquely suited to addressing the constitutional\nharms at issue in this case, I am ordering the NYPD to institute a pilot project in which body-\nworn cameras will be worn for a one-year period by officers on patrol in one precinct per\nborough — specifically the precinct with the highest number of stops during 2012.  The Monitor\nwill establish procedures for the review of stop recordings by supervisors and, as appropriate,\nmore senior managers.  The Monitor will also establish procedures for the preservation of stop\nrecordings for use in verifying complaints in a manner that protects the privacy of those stopped. \nFinally, the Monitor will establish procedures for measuring the effectiveness of body-worn\ncameras in reducing unconstitutional stops and frisks.  At the end of the year, the Monitor will\nwork with the parties to determine whether the benefits of the cameras outweigh their financial,\nadministrative, and other costs, and whether the program should be terminated or expanded.  The\nCity will be responsible for the costs of the pilot project.\nIt would have been preferable for this remedy to have originated with the NYPD,\nwhich has been a leader and innovator in the application of technology to policing, as Compstat\nillustrates.

Even\nwith only half of the 54 uniformed patrol officers wearing cameras at any given time, the\ndepartment over all had an 88 percent decline in the number of complaints filed against officers,\ncompared with the 12 months before the study.”68  While the logistical difficulties of using body-\nworn cameras will be greater in a larger police force, the potential for avoiding constitutional\nviolations will be greater as well.\n4. Joint Remedial Process for Developing Supplemental Reforms\nA community input component is increasingly common in consent decrees and\nsettlements directed at police reform.69  The DOJ has recognized the importance of community\ninput in its recent consent decrees and other agreements with police departments.70  The\nlandmark Collaborative Agreement approved in 2002 by Judge Susan J.

The communities most affected by the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk have a distinct\nperspective that is highly relevant to crafting effective reforms.  No amount of legal or policing\nexpertise can replace a community’s understanding of the likely practical consequences of\nreforms in terms of both liberty and safety.  \nIt is important that a wide array of stakeholders be offered the opportunity to be\nheard in the reform process: members of the communities where stops most often take place;\nrepresentatives of religious, advocacy, and grassroots organizations; NYPD personnel and\nrepresentatives of police organizations; the District Attorneys’ offices; the CCRB;\nrepresentatives of groups concerned with public schooling, public housing, and other local\ninstitutions; local elected officials and community leaders; representatives of the parties, such as\nthe Mayor’s office, the NYPD, and the lawyers in this case; and the non-parties that submitted\nbriefs: the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ, Communities United for Police Reform, and the\nBlack, Latino, and Asian Caucus of the New York City Council. \nIf the reforms to stop and frisk are not perceived as legitimate by those most\naffected, the reforms are unlikely to be successful.72  Neither an independent Monitor, nor a\nmunicipal administration, nor this Court can speak for those who have been and will be most\naffected by the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk.73  The 2007 RAND report, relied on by the City at\n72 Cf. 5/16 Tr. at 7522 (Professor Walker discussing the legitimacy of reforms).

REMEDIES IN LIGON\nIn a January 8, 2013 Opinion and Order, amended on February 14, 2013, I\ngranted the Ligon plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, and proposed entering several\nforms of preliminary relief.77  I postponed ordering that relief until after a consolidated remedies\nhearing could be held in Ligon and Floyd.78  That hearing has now concluded.  The defendants in\nLigon have submitted drafts of the documents discussed in the proposed relief section of the\nFebruary 14 Opinion, the Ligon plaintiffs have proposed revisions to those drafts, and the\ndefendants have responded to the proposed revisions.79\nHaving reviewed the parties’ submissions, I am now imposing the final order of\npreliminary injunctive relief in Ligon.  The reasons for the ordered relief, which must be stated\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d)(1)(A), are the reasons stated in the February\n77 See Ligon, 2013 WL 628534, at *41–44; Ligon v.

Attorney’s fees and costs\nwill be rewarded as appropriate on application.  With regard to policies and procedures, I am\nordering the proposed relief from the February 14 Opinion as elaborated below.\nWith regard to the remaining two categories of relief — supervision and training\n— I am ordering the proposed relief from the February 14 Opinion, as restated below, and I am\nalso appointing the Monitor from Floyd, Mr. Zimroth, to oversee the detailed implementation of\nthese orders.  I am delegating the oversight of the Ligon remedies regarding supervision and\ntraining to the Monitor because there is substantial overlap between these remedies and the\ninjunctive relief concerning supervision and training in Floyd.  For example, both sets of\nremedies will require alterations to supervisory procedures for reviewing stops, as well as the\nrevision of the NYPD Legal Bureau’s slide show at Rodman’s Neck.  \nThe purpose of consolidating the remedies hearings in Ligon and Floyd was to\navoid inefficiencies, redundancies, and inconsistencies in the remedies process.80  This purpose\ncan best be fulfilled by placing both the preliminary injunctive relief in Ligon and the permanent\ninjunctive relief in Floyd under the direction and supervision of the Monitor.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Monitor is directed to oversee the City’s\ncompliance with the following orders.\nA.  Policies and Procedures \nFirst, as proposed in the February 14 Opinion, the NYPD is ordered to adopt a\n80 Ligon, 2013 WL 227654, at *4.\n33\n\nCC(cid:38)aa(cid:68)ss(cid:86)ee(cid:72)  1(cid:3)1(cid:20)::1(cid:29)1(cid:19)00(cid:27)--(cid:16)cc(cid:70)vv(cid:89)--(cid:16)00(cid:19)00(cid:20)66(cid:19)99(cid:22)99(cid:23)--(cid:16)SA(cid:54)AT(cid:36)S-(cid:54)H-(cid:16)HB(cid:43)BP(cid:37)P (cid:51)   D (cid:3) (cid:3)D(cid:3)o(cid:39)co(cid:82)uc(cid:70)mu(cid:88)me(cid:80)ne(cid:72)tn (cid:81)3t (cid:87)33(cid:3)(cid:22)02(cid:26)-21(cid:21)- (cid:3)2 (cid:3) (cid:3) F(cid:3) (cid:41) iFl(cid:76)e(cid:79)i(cid:72)lde(cid:71) d0(cid:3)(cid:19) 20(cid:27)/10(cid:18)(cid:20)/40(cid:21)/71(cid:18)(cid:20)/51(cid:22) 5 (cid:3) (cid:3) P(cid:3) (cid:51) Pa(cid:68)ga(cid:74)eg(cid:72) e3(cid:3)(cid:22) 53(cid:23) 5o(cid:3)(cid:82) fo (cid:73)1(cid:3)f(cid:22) 44(cid:28)40\nformal written policy specifying the limited circumstances in which it is legally permissible to\nstop a person outside a TAP building on a suspicion of trespass.  Specifically, the NYPD is\nordered to amend Interim Order 22 of 2012 (“IO 22”) by deleting the paragraph labeled “NOTE”\non page 2 of IO 22,81 and inserting the following paragraphs in its place:\nA uniformed member of the service may approach and ask questions of a\nperson (that is, conduct a Level 1 request for information under DeBour) if\nthe uniformed member has an objective credible reason to do so.  However,\nmere presence in or outside a building enrolled in the Trespass Affidavit\nProgram is not an “objective credible reason” to approach.  A uniformed\nmember of the service may not approach a person merely because the person\nhas entered or exited or is present near a building enrolled in the Trespass\nAffidavit Program.\nUnder the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a person is\nstopped (temporarily detained) if under the circumstances a reasonable\nperson would not feel free to disregard the police and walk away.  A\nuniformed member of the service may not stop a person on suspicion of\ntrespass unless the uniformed member reasonably suspects that the person\nwas in or is in the building without authorization.  \nMere presence near, entry into, or exit out of a building enrolled in the\nTrespass Affidavit Program, without more, is not sufficient to establish\nreasonable suspicion for a stop on suspicion of trespass.\nThe NYPD is ordered to draft a FINEST message explaining the revisions to IO\n22 and the need for those revisions.  The FINEST message attached as Exhibit 1 to the Ligon\nPlaintiffs’ Brief Concerning Defendants’ Remedial Proposals will serve as a model.  The draft\nwill be provided to the Monitor and then to the Court for approval prior to transmission, with a\ncopy to plaintiffs’ counsel.\nB.

Plaintiffs do not object to many of the draft revisions submitted by the\nCity in response to the proposed orders.82  Where the parties disagree, the Monitor is authorized\nto resolve the dispute by submitting a proposed order for the Court’s approval.\nAs a model for resolving the parties’ disputes, the Monitor may use this Court’s\nrevision of IO 22, as presented above.83  In arriving at a compromise between the parties’\nproposed language, I aimed to articulate the relevant legal standards as simply and clearly as\npossible.  The goal must be to communicate the law to officers in a way that will be understood,\nremembered, and followed.  In general, plaintiffs’ proposed revisions to the City’s draft\nmaterials make the achievement of this goal more likely.84  I note that the Monitor may depart\nfrom the City’s draft materials even when they do not contain legally erroneous language, if\ndoing so would decrease the likelihood of constitutional violations.\n1.  Supervision\nFirst, the City is ordered to develop procedures for ensuring that UF-250s are\ncompleted for every trespass stop outside a TAP building in the Bronx.  A “stop” is defined as\nany police encounter in which a reasonable person would not feel free to terminate the\nencounter.\nSecond, the City is ordered to develop and implement a system for reviewing the\nconstitutionality of stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx.  Needless to say, any system\n82 See Ligon Def. Rem. at Exs. B–F; Ligon Pl. Rem. at 4–16.\n83 For the materials used in drafting the Court’s revision, see Ligon Def. Rem. at Ex.\nA; Ligon Pl.

To the extent that\nsupervisory review reveals that a stop has not conformed with the revised version of IO 22\ndescribed above, the supervisor will ensure that the officer has a proper understanding of what\nconstitutes a stop and when it is legitimate to make a stop. Copies of all reviewed UF-250s shall\nbe provided to plaintiffs’ counsel.\n2. Training\nThe City is ordered to revise the NYPD’s training materials and training programs\nto conform with the law as set forth in the February 14 Opinion.  The instruction must be\nsufficient to uproot the longstanding misconceptions that have affected stops outside of TAP\nbuildings in the Bronx.  It must include, but need not be limited to, the following reforms: \n(1) The revised version of IO 22 described above must be distributed to each Bronx NYPD\nmember, and then redistributed two additional times at six-month intervals.  (2) The stop and\nfrisk refresher course at Rodman’s Neck must be altered to incorporate instruction specifically\ntargeting the problem of unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP buildings.  Training\nregarding stops outside TAP buildings must also be provided to new recruits, as well as any\nofficers who have already attended the Rodman’s Neck refresher course and are not scheduled to\ndo so again.  (3) Chapter 16 of the Chief of Patrol Field Training Guide must be revised to\nreflect the formal written policy governing trespass stops outside TAP buildings described\nabove.  (4) SQF Training Video No. 5 must be revised to conform with the law set forth in the\nFebruary 14 Opinion and must be coordinated with the relief ordered in Floyd.  The revised\nvideo must state that the information contained in the earlier video was incorrect and explain\nwhy it was incorrect.\n36\n\nCC(cid:38)aa(cid:68)ss(cid:86)ee(cid:72)  1(cid:3)1(cid:20)::1(cid:29)1(cid:19)00(cid:27)--(cid:16)cc(cid:70)vv(cid:89)--(cid:16)00(cid:19)00(cid:20)66(cid:19)99(cid:22)99(cid:23)--(cid:16)SA(cid:54)AT(cid:36)S-(cid:54)H-(cid:16)HB(cid:43)BP(cid:37)P (cid:51)   D (cid:3) (cid:3)D(cid:3)o(cid:39)co(cid:82)uc(cid:70)mu(cid:88)me(cid:80)ne(cid:72)tn (cid:81)3t (cid:87)33(cid:3)(cid:22)02(cid:26)-21(cid:21)- (cid:3)2 (cid:3) (cid:3) F(cid:3) (cid:41) iFl(cid:76)e(cid:79)i(cid:72)lde(cid:71) d0(cid:3)(cid:19) 20(cid:27)/10(cid:18)(cid:20)/40(cid:21)/71(cid:18)(cid:20)/51(cid:22) 5 (cid:3) (cid:3) P(cid:3) (cid:51) Pa(cid:68)ga(cid:74)eg(cid:72) e3(cid:3)(cid:22) 83(cid:26) 8o(cid:3)(cid:82) fo (cid:73)1(cid:3)f(cid:22) 44(cid:28)40\nIV.

Be alert for persons who may be violating Housing Authority rules and \nregulations,  including  potentially  unauthorized  persons  within  NYCHA \nproperty.\n14. Upon encountering persons who are violating a Housing Authority rules, \ntake appropriate police action pursuant to P.G. 207-29, “Field Reports,”\nunless there is a basis for criminal enforcement.\na. Officers may not conduct a reasonable suspicion stop pursuant to P.G. \n212-11  “Stop  and Frisk”  or  arrest  any  person  for  a  violation  of \nHousing Authority rules, unless the rule violation is also a criminal \noffense.  Mere lingering in a common area, without more, is not a \ncriminal  offense  for  which  a  person  may  be  stopped  or  arrested.  \nHowever,  an  officer’s  observation  of  a  violation  of  any  Housing \nAuthority rule, regardless of whether it is also a criminal offense, \nmay, at a minimum, provide an officer with a credible reason to \napproach the person to inquire further and thereafter complete a Field \nReport.\nb. A person is stopped, or temporarily detained, if a reasonable person \nunder the facts and circumstances presented would feel that he or she \nis not free to disregard the police and continue on their way.\nNOTE All officer inquiries, interactions, and enforcement activities in Housing Authority \nbuildings must be conducted with the courtesy, professionalism, and respect to \nwhich all persons are entitled in their own homes.\n15. Be alert for persons who may be engaged in criminal activity (including \npotential  trespassers),  based  on  observed  behavior  or other  credible \ninformation, and upon encountering such persons:\na. Approach the person(s) and ask:\n(1) If he or she lives in the building\n(2) If he or she is visiting someone in the building\n(3) If he or she has business in the building.\nb.

Reasonable  suspicion  is  required  to  detain  a  person.    The  person \nquestioned  is  under  no  legal  obligation  to  answer  the  officer’s \nquestions  and  is  free  to  leave  the  building  unless  the  officer  has \nreasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the  person  has  committed,  is \ncommitting,  or  is  about  to  commit  a  Penal  Law  felony  or\nmisdemeanor.\nd. Probable cause is required to make an arrest for trespass. If unable to \ndetermine whether the person is authorized to be in the building, the \nofficer may instruct the person that he or she must leave the building, \nand that a refusal to comply may result in an arrest for trespass. If the \nofficer remains unable to determine whether the person is authorized \nto be in the building, and the person refuses to exit the building, the \nofficer may arrest the person for trespass.\nNOTE Mere presence near, entry into or exit out of a Housing Authority building, without \nmore, is not sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion for a stop on suspicion of \ntrespass nor is it an objective credible reason to approach and question any \nperson.\nA person’s  silence  or  refusal  to  provide  information  or  identification  when \nquestioned by the police does not support reasonable suspicion to stop or probable \ncause to arrest.\n16. Restricted Areas:\na. Restricted areas are limited to those areas specifically designated as \nrestricted by Housing Authority Rules and Regulations.\nb. Do not arrest a person on the basis of trespassing in a restricted area \nof a building – including the roof, roof landing or boiler room – in \nthe absence of conspicuously posted rules, unless the officer knows \nor has other credible information that the person knows that their \npresence in the restricted area is prohibited (e.g. the officer knows \nthat  the  person  has  been  previously  found  in  that  same  type  of \nrestricted area of a Housing Authority development, notwithstanding \nthe fact it may have been a different Housing Authority development, \nbased  on  the  officer’s  prior  experiences  with  the  person  or \nNEW (cid:121) YORK (cid:121) CITY (cid:121) POLICE (cid:121) DEPARTMENT\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:100-c-cvv-0-000669999-A-STA-HSB-HPB  P D  o Dcuomcuemnte 3n3t 03-219  - 1F i l eFdil e0d2 /0024//0145/ 1  5P  a Pgea g4e8  5o fo 1f 474\nPATROL GUIDE\nPROCEDURENUMBER: DATEEFFECTIVE: REVISIONNUMBER: PAGE:\n212-60 4of6\ninformation communicated to the officer).\nc.

Any person may be arrested for trespassing on a roof or roof landing \nor in a boiler room or in any other restricted area if he or she refuses\nto leave after instructed.\n17. An officer may not take police action pursuant to P.G.212-11, “Stop and \nFrisk” unless there is reasonable suspicion to believe that a person has committed, \nis committing or is about to commit a Penal Law felony or misdemeanor.\na. If  a  person  is  stopped,  a  STOP,  QUESTION  AND  FRISK \nREPORT WORKSHEET (PD344-151A) shall be prepared pursuant \nto P.G. 212-11, “Stop and Frisk” and an ACTIVITY LOG entry shall \nbe made in order to document the encounter.\nb. If  a  person  is  stopped  on  suspicion  of  trespass,  take  reasonable \nmeasures to investigate, including but not limited to:\n(1) Inspecting, and returning, identification; and/or\n(2) Requesting a key to the building entrance doors or apartment \ndoor; and/or\n(3) Communicating  with  a  building  resident  with  whom  the \nperson claims to be visiting through the intercom system or in person; \nand/or\n(4) Allowing the person stopped to call a resident to appear and \nverify his or her presence in the building; and/or\n(5) Consulting  with  a  Housing  Authority  employee  who  is \nfamiliar with residents.\nNOTE Merely passing through a door that has a broken lock or that has been propped \nopen does not, alone, constitute reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\n18.

They feel a little nervous about \nbeing in the enclosed subway car all by themself. At the far end of the car \nthey hear the doors open and in walks a police officer patrolling the train. All \nof a sudden they feel their anxiety disappear and they start to relax. This \nexperience is shared by thousands of New York’s citizens every day. \nWhether it’s in the subway, on a jogging path in central park, or on a street \ncorner in Queens, the NYPD’s patrol force makes New Yorkers feel safe. \n         Over the past fifteen years we have seen a historic drop in crime in \nNew York City. Many factors have contributed to this, but one fact cannot\nbe disputed, the men and women who walk a foot post or cruise a patrol \nsector are no doubt the root cause of this drop in crime. A key element in \ncrime prevention is police officers’ relationships with community members, \nwho are valuable sources of information and assistance. It is, therefore, \nimperative to maintain good relations with Housing Authority residents and \nguests. All officer inquiries, interactions, and enforcement activities in \nHousing Authority buildings must be conducted with the courtesy, \nprofessionalism, and respect all persons are entitled to in their own homes.    \nAt the conclusion of this lesson, the student will be able to:\n(cid:120) Describe the events which occur at roll call.\n(cid:120) Identify and discuss Precinct and Transit patrol.\n(cid:120) Explain the proper procedure for interior patrol and its legal \nimplications:\nA.

Conducting  “Ride-Throughs”  in  Subway  Cars  with  Full \nWidth Train Operator Cabs\na)Uniformed members of the service assigned to the \nTransit Bureau are often called upon to conduct “ride-\nthrough”.  A ride-through is performed by riding in the \nfront of the lead car of a train and instructing the Train \n       \n                                    CITY OF NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT                      PAGE   9                  \n\nCCaassee  11::1100--ccvv--0000669999--SAATS-H-HBBPP    D  Docoucmumenetn 3t 3302-91- 2   F  iFleilde d0 20/20/40/41/51 5   P  Pagaeg e6 21 2o fo 1f 4546\nLESSON:  PATROL OPERATIONS INSTRUCTOR \nCUES:\nOperator to proceed at a low rate of speed, visually \nsearching  the  tunnel  and  track  area  for  any \nunauthorized  persons  or  suspicious  items.    A  ride-\nthrough  is  conducted  for  a  variety  of  reasons \nincluding  searching  a  tunnel  area  for  perpetrators, \nand performing “sweeps” for suspicious persons or\npackages, particularly in under water tubes.\nb)To properly conduct a ride-through the member of the \nservice must have a clear and unobstructed view of \nthe track area.  On the new subway cars, this view is \nobstructed by train operator’s cab which occupies the \nentire  width  of  the  subway  car.    Members  of  the \nservice cannot effectively conduct a ride-through by \nlooking  through  the  Train  Operator’s  cab  on  these \ntrain cars. In train cars with this design, the uniformed \nmember  of  the  service  must  enter  the  Train \nOperator’s cab to conduct a ride through.  The Transit \nBureau  has  reached  an  agreement  with  New  York \nCity Transit to allow officers this access.  However, \nbefore a Train Operator will allow a UMOS into the \ncab, the following must be taken:\n(1) The UMOS conducting the ride-through MUST \nbe in uniform.\n(2) The  UMOS  MUST  identify  him/herself  to  the \nTrain  Operator  and  provide  a  shield  number \nbefore entry into the Train Operator’s cab.\nc) When conducting a ride-through safety is paramount.  \nUMOS  should  exercise  good  judgment  and  sound \ntactics at all times.  UMOS should also avoid placing \nNew  York  City  Transit  personnel  at  risk \nunnecessarily.\n4. Train Order Maintenance Sweep (T.O.M.S.)\na)Train  Order  Maintenance  Sweep  is  a  patrol  tactic \ninvolving  the  deployment  of  optimally  one  (1) \nsupervisor and eight (8) police officers to a subway \nplatform,  where  they  will  conduct  aggressive  train \ninspections.    During  a  T.O.M.S.,  the  officers  are \nspread along the platform so that the entire train may \nbe quickly inspected.  For instance, one (1) officer at \neach of the first four cars and one (1) officer at each \nof the last four cars, with the supervisor at the center \n       \n                                    CITY OF NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT                      PAGE   10                 \n\nCCaassee  11::1100--ccvv--0000669999--SAATS-H-HBBPP    D  Docoucmumenetn 3t 3302-91- 2   F  iFleilde d0 20/20/40/41/51 5   P  Pagaeg e6 31 3o fo 1f 4546\nLESSON:  PATROL OPERATIONS INSTRUCTOR \nCUES:\ntwo cars and conductor position.  The supervisor will \nusually  request  the  conductor  to  announce  to \npassengers, “The train will be momentarily delayed \nfor a police inspection.”  This provides omnipresence \nto  passengers  and  permits  observations  and \ncorrections  of  disorder  and  unlawful  behavior.    In \naddition,  T.O.M.S.  is  an  effective  counterterrorism \ntool.\n5.

EXPLAIN  THE  PROPER  PROCEDURE  FOR  INTERIOR  PATROL \nAND ITS LEGAL IMPLICATIONS\nA. Describe the purpose and rationale for conducting interior patrols \nwithin Housing Authority property.\n1. NYCHA and the New York City Police Department collaborate \nto provide residents with decent and affordable housing in a \nsafe and secure living environment throughout the five \nboroughs.  The NYC Police Department inherited \nresponsibility for NYCHA property from the Housing Authority \npolice.  Although NYC Police Department Members of the \nService are not employees of NYCHA, they act on behalf of \nNYCHA in providing security for NYCHA buildings and \ngrounds.\n2. In performing interior patrols (also sometimes referred to as \n“vertical patrols”), the New York City Police Department’s \nprimary role is providing a safe and secure living environment \nfor NYCHA residents by ensuring the habitability of NYCHA \nbuildings, enforcing NYCHA rules, providing access control for \nNYCHA buildings, and deterring criminal behavior.  The \nproper performance of these functions will create a safe and \nsecure environment to protect residents from crime and \n       \n                                    CITY OF NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT                      PAGE   15                 \n\nCCaassee  11::1100--ccvv--0000669999--SAATS-H-HBBPP    D  Docoucmumenetn 3t 3302-91- 2   F  iFleilde d0 20/20/40/41/51 5   P  Pagaeg e6 81 8o fo 1f 4546\nLESSON:  PATROL OPERATIONS INSTRUCTOR \nCUES:\nrespect the rights they possess as residents.\n3. In order for the NYC Police Department to be effective in \nachieving such goals, it is important that all members of the \ndepartment understand the legal boundaries that accompany \ntheir role.  Understanding these legal boundaries, and \nconducting all interactions in a courteous, professional and \nrespectful manner, are critical parts of building a positive \nrelationship with NYCHA residents.  As with any residential \narea, there are residents who abide by rules and laws under \nwhich they are bound and there are those who do not.  Our \njob is to fairly and impartially enforce laws and regulations to \ncreate a safe and orderly residential environment.  \n4. The main purpose of this lesson is to demonstrate a \nmethodical procedure for officers to:\na) Identify problems with NYCHA buildings that need to \nbe brought to the attention of NYCHA management, \nincluding hazardous conditions, conditions in need of \nrepair, and improper signage.\nb) Identify potential NYCHA rule violations, and provide \naccess control for NYCHA buildings.\nc) Identify when to prepare Field Reports to document \nunsafe conditions and rule violations, so as to apprise \nNYCHA management of their existence.\nd) Identify potential criminal behavior, and approach, \nforcibly stop, and arrest individuals when appropriate.\ne) Perform these functions in a residential setting without\nexceeding their legal authority, and in a respectful, \ncourteous and professional manner. \nB.  Describe the importance of proper interactions between police \nofficers and Housing Authority residents and guests.\n1. It is often the goal of the police officer to gain voluntary \ncompliance amongst the public in regard to sets of laws and \nrules and regulations.  This is especially true in relation to this \nlesson.  Officers enforcing the regulations that will be \ndiscussed in this lesson must ensure that their inquiries,\ninteractions, and enforcement activities are conducted in a \ncourteous, professional and respectful manner.  The \nimportance of tactical communication is preeminent in these \nsituations because these interactions routinely take place in \nthe common areas of resident’s homes, and successful \npolicing of NYCHA buildings depends upon consistently \npositive interactions with residents.\n       \n                                    CITY OF NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT                      PAGE   16                 \n\nCCaassee  11::1100--ccvv--0000669999--SAATS-H-HBBPP    D  Docoucmumenetn 3t 3302-91- 2   F  iFleilde d0 20/20/40/41/51 5   P  Pagaeg e6 91 9o fo 1f 4546\nLESSON:  PATROL OPERATIONS INSTRUCTOR \nCUES:\n2. Why are positive interactions important?\na) The public trusts (or should trust) us to come into their \nlives when conditions require it to help them.\nb) Oftentimes a resident may become an ally and offer \ninformation on residents who are creating negative \nimpacts on the development by their actions.\nc) A single negative interaction can make a lasting\nimpression on individuals that may cause them to \ndistrust police in all future interactions.\nd) The incidence of CCRB complaints and resultant \ndisciplinary actions in founded cases may be reduced \nby the use of Courtesy, Professionalism, and Respect \nand Tactical Communication processes.\n3. How may officers have the best chance that their interactions \nwith the public will be positive?\na) Use professional language.\nb) Be sharp, neat, well spoken….not sloppy, belligerent or \nhostile.\nc) Look and sound professional to attain respect from the \npublic.\nd) Improve communication skills and tone of voice (lose \nthe attitude).\ne) Do not fall into the trap of considering all interactions to \nbe with the criminal element.  This is especially true \nwhen officers approach persons to determine their \njustification for being in a NYCHA building.  The vast \nmajority of persons present in public housing are law \nabiding residents and their guests.  These persons \nwant to live in or visit an orderly, crime free \nenvironment and they should not be subject to \naccusatory questions in their own homes unless an \nofficer has an articulable reason for believing that \ncriminal activity is afoot.\nf) Remember that by de-escalating a situation, you are \nhelping yourself stay in control of the interaction.\nNOTE: In all cases, remember that proper, professional and \ntactically sound interactions reduce needless complaints and \nenhance the Police Department’s ability to work with \nresidents to control crime, reduce disorder and trespassing \nin housing developments and enhance their quality of life.\nC.

Level 1:\nThe officer approaches the person and, in a non- Request for\naccusatory manner, asks if he lives in the building.  The  Information\nperson says, “No, I was visiting my friend John in \napartment 3B.”  The officer explains that residents are \nconcerned about unauthorized people being in the \nbuilding and asks the person if he would come with him \nto 3B.  The person says he is waiting for a cab and he \nwould rather not leave the lobby.  Although the officer is \nunable to determine if the person is authorized to be in \nthe building and may therefore instruct the person that \nhe must leave the building and that a refusal to comply \nmay result in an arrest for trespass, the officer elects to \nwait with the man.

The officer then \nexplains that he has no way of knowing whether or not \nthe man is actually a resident, which is why he is asking \nfor identification or a key.  The man voluntarily shows \nhis identification, indicating that he is a resident.  An \nActivity Log entry was made, and no further action was \nneeded.\nWhy is this action appropriate?\nThe officer recognized that he escalated the situation by \nquestioning the man in an aggressive, accusatory manner. \nIn order to achieve the primary goal of confirming the man’s \nresidency, the officer changed his tone to speak more \npolitely and carefully explained the purpose of his questions \nand his overall concerns for the man’s safety as a resident.\ne) An officer on an interior patrol in a NYCHA building  Level 1:\nobserves a woman approach the front door with a set of  Request for \nkeys in her hand.

If the person said he was not visiting someone in the \nbuilding or otherwise authorized to be in the building there would \nhave been Probable Cause to arrest.\nSame facts as above, but the person says that he is visiting a \nresident in the building.  The officer accompanies the person to \nthe apartment, but no one is home.  The officer then arrests the \nperson for criminal trespass\nWhat was wrong with the above scenario?\nThe fact that a resident is not home does not necessarily mean \nthat the person was not authorized to be in the building.  An \nauthorized visitor should not be arrested for trespassing simply \nbecause the resident happens not to be at home when the person \nis trying to visit.\nWhat would have made the scenario acceptable?\nSince the person’s stated purpose for being in the building was to \nvisit a resident, and that resident was not home, the officer should \nhave asked the person to leave the building.  If, after giving the \nperson the opportunity to leave the building, the person still \nrefused to leave, the officer may have arrested the person for \ncriminal trespass\nF.

The radio dispatcher will notify the patrol supervisor for \nall building fire assignments whether received through \n911 or as a pick-up assignment and the supervisor \nassigned must respond to all fires.\nBuilding Entry/Elevator Use:\n6. Upon entering the building, note the distance of the \nstairwell to the elevator and note the locations of all \nexits in the event of an evacuation or tactical retreat \nbecomes necessary.\n7. If multiple UMOS are entering the building at the same \ntime, UMOS should utilize separate \nstairwells/elevators.\n8. Whenever possible UMOS will utilize stairs and walk \nup to the floor reported to be affected by fire.\n9. Prior to deciding to use the elevator to ascend to the \nfire, UMOS will inspect the elevator shaft for signs of \nsmoke by directing their flashlights through any visible \nspace between the elevator and the open shaft.\n10.If smoke is detected in the elevator shaft DO NOT\nuse the elevator as a method of ascent.\n11.UMOS should stop the elevator on every 5th floor on \nthe way up to the reported fire to repeat the visual \ninspection of the shaft.\n12.If there is no smoke detected in the elevator shaft , \nthe UMOS may elect to use the elevator, but must exit \nthe elevator at least 2 floors below the affected floor \nand proceed cautiously via the stairs to the affected \nfloor.\n13.UMOS should transmit the chosen method of ascent, \neither  stairs  or  elevator,  to  the  communications \ndispatcher prior to advancing to the affected floor.\nNOTE:  UMOS must be aware that fires can spread rapidly and \n       \n                                    CITY OF NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT                      PAGE   44                 \n\nCCaassee  11::1100--ccvv--0000669999--SAATS-H-HBBPP    D  Docoucmumenetn 3t 3302-91- 2   F  iFleilde d0 20/20/40/41/51 5   P  Pagaeg e9 74 7o fo 1f 4546\nLESSON:  PATROL OPERATIONS INSTRUCTOR \nCUES:\nexpand to other floors.  In addition, smoke in these fires may \ncontain  poisons  and  carcinogens.    UMOS  should  proceed \ncautiously  at  all  times;  maintain  communication  with  the  radio \ndispatcher to relay their locations and to ascertain the estimated \ntime of arrival of the Fire Department.\n14.Upon arrival to the floor of the reported fire, UMOS must first \nconduct a visual inspection of the hallway through the window \nof the stairwell door, if possible.  Next, touch the stairwell door \nto detect the presence of heat in the hallway.\n15.If heat is detected, adjust tactics accordingly prior to entering \nthe hallway, including but not limited to retreating to a floor \nbelow the reported fire.  \nNOTE:  An unusually warm door or the presence of smoke are \nindicators that there is a fire in the hallway or in an apartment \nwhere a door has been left open.  This can be an extremely \ndangerous condition.  Therefore, whether or not UMOS decide to \nenter the hallway, ensure that the door between the stairwell and \nthe hallway remains closed to reduce the risk of the chimney \neffect which can draw fire to the stairwell and cause the fire to \nspread.\n16. If UMOS suddenly encounter smoke and heat, drop to your \nknees,  move      closer  to  the  wall  and  retreat  to  a \npredetermined exit.  \nD. Natural Gas Hazards\n1. It is important that a UMOS know how to recognize a \ngas leak and what to do if you encounter a suspected \ngas leak while responding to a call for service. Signs \nof a gas leak includes:\na)Smell  – A  distinctive  strong  odor  similar  to \nrotten eggs.\nb)See  – White  cloud,  mist,  fog,  bubbles  in \nstanding water, blowing dust or vegetation that \nappears to be dead or dying for no reason.\nc) Hear – Roaring, hissing, or whistling.\n2.

A challenge from \nthe rear allows more time for the challenging officer to \nevaluate the subject’s reaction and also gives the \nchallenging officer a tactical advantage.  A challenge \nfrom the side reduces response time.\n6. Challenging Officer\na)Immediately take cover to the rear, not to the \nside of the person being challenged, if possible\nIdentify self (Police!

However, uniformed members of \nthe service do not have to carry their shields \nwhen unarmed.\nH. Tactical Considerations\n1. When challenged; DO NOT simultaneously reach \nfor  your  identification  and  tell  the  challenging \nofficer who you are. DO NOT turn and face the \nchallenging  officer  with  a  firearm  in  hand.  DO \nNOT move your hands in any manner that can be \ninterpreted as a hostile or menacing movement. It \nis a natural reaction to turn when challenged from\nbehind, you should resist this urge.\n2. The on duty and/or uniformed officer must ensure \nthat they are aware of important information that \nmay prove vital during a confrontation situation.  Stress that Color of \nOne such piece of information is the COLOR OF  the Day is not to be \nTHE DAY. All officers must be made aware of the  given over the \ncolor of the day upon turnout by the supervisor.  radio.\nThe  color  of  the  day  is  transmitted  via  the \nFINEST terminal on a daily basis. Non-uniformed \nmembers of the service are required to wear the \ncolor  of  the  day  when  performing  enforcement \nduty so that it is visible to all patrol officers in the \nevent of a confrontation with uniformed members\nof  the  service.  The  colors  of  the  day  may  be: \nGreen, White, Yellow, Red, or Orange rotated on \na daily basis.\n3. Use  extreme  caution  in  judging  the  challenged \nofficer's response to commands. Do not fall victim \nto  the  \"Symbolic  Opponent  Syndrome”  -\nPreconceived notion that places a suspect into a \n\"criminal\" category because of race, nationality, \ngrooming,  or  mode  of  dress.  Looks  can  be \ndeceiving and should not form the basis for action \nto  be  taken.  Do  not  reach  any  definite \nconclusions that may lead to irreversible police \naction, because of a suspect's appearance. P.G. 212-31, Threats \nAgainst Members of \nI.

For many citizens, security is \nknowing the cop on patrol.  The objective is to establish ties and relations \nwith the public.  Police Officers should feel, and be perceived as, part of the \ncommunity that they serve.  The citizens’ concerns should be their \nconcerns.  The Police officer’s job is to protect life and property, and to \nactively pursue violators of the law.  Police department cannot accomplish \nthis task without the support of the citizens of this city; it is through daily \nvigilant patrol that police officer gain that support.\nMANDATORY PATROL GUIDE READING\n(cid:120) P.G. 202-21 Police Officer – Duties and Responsibilities\n(cid:120) P.G. 202-22 Radio Motor Patrol Operator – Duties and \nResponsibilities\n(cid:120) P.G. 202-23 Radio Motor Patrol Recorder – Duties and \n       \n                                    CITY OF NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT                      PAGE   52                 \n\nCCaassee  11::1100--ccvv--0000669999--ASTA-SH-BHPB P  D   oDcoucmuemnet n3t3 302-19 - 2 F  i lFeidle 0d2 0/024/0/145/1  5 P   aPgaeg 1e0 555 o of f1 5464\nLESSON:  PATROL OPERATIONS INSTRUCTOR \nCUES:\nResponsibilities\n(cid:120) P.G. 202-40 Police Attendant – Duties and Responsibilities\n(cid:120) P.G. 207-29 Field Reports\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-01 Roll Call Formations\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-03 Expiration of Tour\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-10 Interrupted Patrol\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-16              Evacuations of New York City Transit Trains\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-17              Procedures at Scenes of Critical Situations on \n                                  New York City Transit   \n(cid:120) P.G. 212-18              Searches for Armed/Dangerous Persons on \n                                  New York City Transit Tracks\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-19              Animals on New York City Public Transportation\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-20 Ejection from New York City Transit Property\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-21              Photography in New York City Transit Property\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-23              Inspection of Rapid Transit Station on Post\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-24 Removal of Power in the Subway\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-25 Revenue Escorts\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-26              Inspection of New York City Housing Authority\n                                 Facilities\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-28 Disabled Housing Authority Elevator Car With \nPassengers\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-31 Threats Against Members of the Service\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-33              Confrontation  Situations\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-43 Vacate Orders for Residential Buildings\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-58 Fire\n(cid:120) P.G. 215-15              Confiscation of New York City Transit Student \nMetroCards\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-59              Interior Patrol of Trespass Affidavit Buildings\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-60              Interior Patrol of Housing Authority Buildings\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-76              New York City Housing Authority Trespass \nNotice Program\n(cid:120) P.G. 212-77              Processing Arrests Made Pursuant to the New \nYork city Housing Authority Trespass Notice \nProgram\n(cid:120) P.G. 216-09              Animal Bites\n(cid:120) P.G. 219-01              Inspection of Department Vehicles Each Tour \nby Operator\nAt the conclusion of this lesson, the student will be able to:\n(cid:120) Describe the events which occur at roll call.\n(cid:120) Identify and discuss Precinct and Transit patrol.\n(cid:120) Explain the proper procedure for interior patrol and its legal \n       \n                                    CITY OF NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT                      PAGE   53                 \n\nCCaassee  11::1100--ccvv--0000669999--ASTA-SH-BHPB P  D   oDcoucmuemnet n3t3 302-19 - 2 F  i lFeidle 0d2 0/024/0/145/1  5 P   aPgaeg 1e0 566 o of f1 5464\nLESSON:  PATROL OPERATIONS INSTRUCTOR \nCUES:\nimplications:\nA.

Officers \nenforcing the regulations that will be discussed in this lesson must \nensure that their inquiries, interactions, and enforcement activities \nare conducted in a courteous, professional and respectful manner.  \nThe  importance  of  tactical  communication  is preeminent  in  these \nsituations because  these  interactions  routinely  take  place  in  the \ncommon  areas  of  residents’ homes,  and  successful  policing  of \nNYCHA  buildings  depends  upon  consistently  positive  interactions \nwith residents.\nWhy are positive interactions important?\nA) The public trusts (or should trust) us to come into their \nlives when conditions require it to help them.\nB) Oftentimes a resident may become an ally and offer \ninformation  on  residents  who  are  violating  NYCHA \nrules or committing other crimes.\nC) Exhibiting  Courtesy,  Professionalism  and  Respect \nduring  encounters  and employing  Tactical \nCommunications  when  interacting  with  NYCHA \nresidents will reduce the incidence of CCRB complaints \nand the discipline that sometimes results.\nHow can officers ensure positive interactions?\nA) Use professional language.\nB) Be sharp, neat, well spoken….not sloppy, belligerent or \nhostile.\nC) Look and sound professional to attain respect from the \npublic.\nD) Improve communication skills and tone of voice (lose \nthe attitude).\nE) Do not fall into the trap of considering all interactions to \nbe with the criminal element.  This is especially true \nwhen  officers  approach  persons  to  determine  their \njustification for being in a NYCHA building.  The vast \nmajority of persons present in public housing are law \nabiding  residents  and  their  guests.    These  persons \nwant  to  live  in  or  visit  an  orderly,  crime  free \nenvironment.\nCITY OF NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT                           PAGE 4\n\nCCaassee 1 1:1:100-c-cvv-0-000669999-A-STA-HSB-HPB  P D  o Dcuomcuemnte 3n3t 03-219  - 3F i l eFdil e0d2 /0024//0145/ 1  5P  a Pgea g1e1 37  ooff  11494\nLESSON: INSTRUCTOR \nNYCHA Rules & Regulations CUES:\nF) Remember that by de-escalating a situation, you are \nhelping yourself stay in control of the interaction.\nNOTE: In all cases, remember that proper, professional and tactically \nsound interactions reduce needless complaints and enhance \nthe  Police  Department’s  ability  to  work  with  residents  to \ncontrol crime, reduce disorder and trespassing in housing \ndevelopments and enhance their quality of life.

List and define the Rules & Regulations contained on the posted \nsigns that applies to both NYCHA residents and non-residents \nand locations for where the rules are enforced.\nA. Trespassing is prohibited.  NYCHA premises are for the use \nof  residents,  invited  guests,  and  persons  with  legitimate \nbusiness.  For the purpose of this training program, residents \ninclude  individuals  residing  in  the  household  even  if  not \nregistered  with  NYCHA.    All  such  persons  are  asked  to \ncooperate with inquiries from NYCHA Management, Security \nGuards,  Resident  Watch,  and the  NYC  Police  Department \nregarding  their  presence  or  conduct  in  any  building  or  on \ndevelopment  grounds.  All  such  persons  are  not,  however, \nrequired  to  cooperate  with  inquiries  from  the  NYC  Police \nDepartment.  Mere failure to answer questions or cooperate \non  its  own  does  not  give  rise  to  reasonable  suspicion  or \nprobable cause of trespassing.  Unless a person is stopped \nbased on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, that person \nis free to walk away when questioned.\n**NOTE: DEVELOPMENT GROUNDS are\n1. All NYCHA buildings, apartments, manager’s offices, \nmaintenance areas, storage rooms, etc.\n2.

The signs will be posted at the \nbuilding entrances or elsewhere where the resident has to \npass  or  posted  adjacent  to  an  area  that  has  been \ndesignated as restricted. Even if there is probable cause \nto  arrest  a  person  for  trespassing  in  a  restricted  area, \nofficers  may  exercise  their  discretion  to  refrain  from \narresting that person.\n(cid:120) Discretion  is  the  authority  to  decide  how  to  resolve \nsituations in different ways.  A police officer cannot take \naction or refrain from taking action because of a person’s \ngender,  race,  class,  ethnicity,  sexual  orientation,  or \nreligion.  Instead, a police officer must base his or her \nactions  only  on  such  objective  considerations  as  the \nindividual’s  actions  and/or  information  the  officer  may \nhave  received  from  sources  such  as  members  of  the \nCITY OF NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT                           PAGE 9\n\nCCaassee  11::1100--ccvv--0000669999--ASTA-SH-BHPB P  D   oDcoucmuemnet n3t3 302-19 - 3 F  i lFeidle 0d2 0/024/0/145/1  5 P   aPgaeg 1e1 182 o of f1 1494\nLESSON: INSTRUCTOR \nNYCHA Rules & Regulations CUES:\npublic, other officers, and the radio dispatcher.\n(cid:120) When  an  officer  encounters  a  person  trespassing  in  a \nrestricted area, the officer may exercise discretion given \nthe circumstances and not arrest that person and instead \ninstruct that person to leave the restricted area, or the \nbuilding, under appropriate circumstances.  \n(cid:120) For example, a non-English speaker may not have been \nable to read a conspicuously posted sign that was not \nwritten in his or her native language and, thus, may not \nhave known the area was restricted.\n(cid:120) If an officer encounters a building resident in a restricted \narea, such as the roof or roof landing, and there is no \nother  basis  to  arrest  such  person,  the  officer  should \nexercise such discretion and ask the resident to leave the \nrestricted area.

The primary purpose of these locations is to enable entrance \nto and exit from the building as well as movement within the building.\nActivities  associated  with  the  primary  purpose  of  such  locations  are \npermissible,  including  but  not  limited  to: standing  and  talking  for  a \nreasonable  period  of  time; waiting  for  food  deliveries,  visitors,  and \ntransportation; meeting and greeting neighbors and friends; picking up \nand dropping off children; checking mailboxes, and any similar activity \nthat occurs in the ordinary course of entrance, exit and movement within \nthe building.\n** Members of the Service are directed to use common sense and good \njudgment  when  addressing  this  NYCHA  Rule  violation.    Officers  are \nfurther reminded that Lingering in and of itself is NOT a violation of law.\nExample of “Lingering” is:\n(cid:120) (Stairway) Three people are sitting on the stairs in a stairwell.\n** Since the purpose of the stairs is to allow people to walk from one \nfloor to another, a group of people sitting in the stairwell would be \n“Lingering” and subject to a Field Report.  \n** NOTE  A person cannot be arrested for mere lingering in a \nstairwell.\nThe following examples would NOT be “Lingering”:\n(cid:120) (Lobby) - Someone is standing in the lobby engaging in a brief \nconversation with another person while getting their mail from the \nmail box.\n** This is not lingering.

A  UMOS  may  NOT  stop  (temporarily  detain)  a \nsuspected trespasser unless the officer reasonably \nsuspects that the person is in the building without \nvalid justification.\n3. If a person is stopped on suspicion of trespass, take \nreasonable  measures  to  investigate  (ask  for  keys, \nverify with resident, allow person to call resident for \nverification, consult with NYCHA employee)\n4. NOTE: Be mindful that residents may be alarmed \nor  intimidated  when  a  police  officer  questions \nthem in their homes, especially when an officer \ngoes to their apartment.  Thus, when verifying a \nperson’s  authority  to  be  in  the  building,  take \nreasonable measures to avoid such intimidation \nby first using the intercom system to contact the \nresident or permitting the stopped person to call \nthe resident by phone.\n5.

NOTE - Probable cause is required to make an arrest \nfor  trespass.    If  unable  to  determine  whether  the \nperson is authorized to be in the building, the officer \nmay instruct the person that he or she must leave the \nbuilding, and that a refusal to comply may result in an \narrest for trespass.  If the officer remains unable to \ndetermine whether the person is authorized to be in \nthe  building,  and  the  person  refuses  to  exit  the \nbuilding,  the  officer  may  arrest  the  person  for \ntrespass.\n      J.

If  an  officer  has  probable  cause  to  arrest  a \nbuilding resident for being in a restricted area, \nsuch as the roof or roof landing, and the officer \nhas not seen the resident in that area before and \nhas no other reason to believe that the resident \nhas actual knowledge that the area is restricted, \nthe  officer  should  exercise  discretion  and  ask \nthe resident to leave the restricted area as long \nas  there  is  no  other  basis  to  arrest  such  a \nperson.\n8.

Inability to \nimmediately  verify  a  person’s  status  as  a \nresident  or  visitor  does  not  alone  provide \nprobable cause to arrest for trespassing.\n9. A  person’s  silence  when  questioned,  alone, \ndoes not support reasonable suspicion to stop or \nprobable cause to arrest.\nConclusion\nPolice officers must be aware of the specific procedures for policing \nNYC Housing Authority developments, including the non-criminal Rules\n& Regulations.\nIn  enforcing  these  Rules  &  Regulations,  the  New  York  City  Police \nDepartment’s  primary  role  is  providing  a  safe  and  secure  living \nenvironment for NYCHA residents.\nSuccessful policing of NYCHA buildings requires positive interactions \nbetween police officers and residents.  This can only be achieved by \nconducting  all  interactions  in  NYCHA  buildings  with  the  courtesy, \nprofessionalism  and  respect  all  persons  are  entitled  to  in  their  own \nCITY OF NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT                           PAGE 16\n\nCCaassee  11::1100--ccvv--0000669999--ASTA-SH-BHPB P  D   oDcoucmuemnet n3t3 302-19 - 3 F  i lFeidle 0d2 0/024/0/145/1  5 P   aPgaeg 1e2 159 o of f1 1494\nLESSON: INSTRUCTOR \nNYCHA Rules & Regulations CUES:\nhomes.\nBy properly conducting police activity on NYCHA property, officers will \nassist the NYC Housing Authority in enforcing its rules, limiting criminal \nactivity,  and  ultimately  providing  a  safe  and  secure  environment  for \nresidents and their guests.\nAt the end of this lesson the student will be able to:\nI.

The document is intended to remind NYCHA residents of these important requirements. \nNote that this document is NOT a lease and NOT a lease addendum. \nThe act of signing this document will not grant any rights of tenancy or authorized occupancy. \nThis document does not waive any lease provision, rule or policy not included here. All provisions of other NYCHA \nrules, policy or lease clauses not mentioned here remain in full force and effect. \nContact your development housing assistant for more details. \n \nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \n1  Annual Review: Every household must submit to NYCHA every year the Annual Review booklet. \nThis lists both the tenants (person(s) who signed the lease) and family members who did not sign the lease but \nare authorized by NYCHA to reside in the household. \nInclude in the booklet income information for ALL household members. Examples of income include: \nemployment wages, Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), pension, public assistance, \nunemployment benefits and income from a business. \nNYCHA verifies the accuracy of the information reported through US Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) databases and other sources. \n2  Rent: Rent is based on the income of all household members. Rent is based on 30% of household income (less \nallowable deductions) or the welfare rent, and cannot go higher than any rent ceiling in effect. \n3  Rent Due: Rent for the entire month is due the first day of the month and must be paid entirely, unless the \nfamily pays by automatic rent payment (see #5 below), where rent can be paid twice a month. \n4  Rent Payment Options: Rent is paid once a month, due on the first of the month: \n(cid:120)  by mail: mail your check or money order along with the monthly rent bill, \n(cid:120)  by phone: call (866) 942-3104, \n(cid:120)  with cash at a bank, or \n(cid:120)  with cash at a check cashing store: At Pay-O-Matic. \n5  Automatic Rent Payment Options – rent is paid twice a month: \n(cid:120)  Payroll Rent Deduction: available to most New York City municipal employees, including NYCHA \nemployees \n(cid:120)  Automatic Rent set up by computer: available to any resident whose source of income (for example: \nwages, pension, Social Security) is directly deposited to their bank account and the resident signs up for \nautomatic rent payment (go to www.nyc.gov/nycha and select “Online Rent payment”). \n(cid:120)  Public Assistance: PA recipients whose rent is paid by the Department of Social Services twice monthly. \nAPARTMENT INFORMATION \n6  Repairs and Inspection: Report needed repairs and emergencies to the Customer Contact Center (CCC) at \n(718) 707-7771. Residents must help facilitate repairs and inspections by providing access to their apartment \nas needed. \n7  Window Guards: Every window in every apartment must have a window guard, even if you don’t have \nchildren living in your apartment. If you remove a window guard to install an air conditioner (A/C), you must \ncall the development office because NYCHA must inspect the window to see that the A/C is securely installed.  \n8  Major Appliances: If you want to get a major appliance (air conditioner, freezer, dishwasher or clothes \nwashing machine) you must contact the development office and sign a special appliance agreement. There \nmay be a small electricity or water usage fee involved. Clothes dryers are prohibited. \n9  Occupancy: Only the tenant(s) and people authorized by NYCHA may reside in your apartment. \nUnauthorized occupants are not permitted.

This process will \nbe overseen by the Court. \nUpon approval by the Court, the Settlement Agreement will resolve and release \npending claims of the Plaintiff Class against Defendant City and Defendant NYCHA \nrelating to trespass enforcement that have been or, could have been, asserted in Davis, et \nal. v. City of New York, et al. prior to the date that the Settlement Agreement goes into \neffect.

For the reasons stated \nbelow, the motion is DENIED. \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-AT-HBP   Document 528   Filed 07/08/20   Page 2 of 11\nBACKGROUND \nI.  Ligon, Floyd, and Davis Cases \n  This long-running litigation addresses the NYPD’s stop, frisk, search, and trespass \nenforcement policies and practices.   \n  In Ligon v. City of New York, after a seven-day evidentiary hearing, on January 8, 2013, \nthe Court issued a preliminary injunction against the City of New York (the “City”), finding that \nthe plaintiffs would likely succeed in proving that the City, by its deliberate indifference, had a \npolicy of conducting unconstitutional stops in or near Bronx apartment buildings enrolled in the \nTrespass Affidavit Program (“TAP”), which permits the NYPD to patrol private buildings with \ntheir owners’ consent.  925 F. Supp. 2d 478, 486 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), amending and superseding \nLigon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. 2274, 2013 WL 71800 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2013).  In Floyd \nv. City of New York, after years of litigation culminating in a nine-week trial, on August 12, \n2013, the Court issued an opinion holding that the City had a policy of conducting race-based \nstops and frisks that ran afoul of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments (the “Liability \nOpinion”).  Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 540, 562 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).   \n  Given the similarities in the City’s constitutional violations in Floyd and Ligon, the Court \nthen directed the NYPD to institute certain reforms to remedy the unconstitutional stop-and-frisk \npractices in both cases (the “Remedial Order”).  Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 668, \n671 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).  The Court appointed an independent monitor (the “Monitor”) to oversee \nthose reforms, and directed the parties to participate in a community-input process under the \nguidance of a neutral facilitator (the “Facilitator”) to develop additional reforms.  Id. at 686–88.1 \n                                                \n1 On July 19, 2017, the parties in Ligon settled the outstanding claims, agreeing to significant reforms to the \nNYPD’s trespass enforcement practices, documentation, and training, and agreeing to continued participation in the \nremedial process.  See Ligon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. 2274 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2017), ECF No. 296. \n2 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-AT-HBP   Document 528   Filed 07/08/20   Page 3 of 11\n  In Davis v. City of New York, the plaintiffs alleged unlawful, race-based enforcement of \ntrespass laws in New York City Housing Authority (“NYCHA”) developments.  The parties \nsettled the case on February 4, 2015, agreeing, among other things, that they would participate in \nthe Floyd and Ligon remedial process, and that orders issued in that process would be \nincorporated into the settlement.  Davis v. City of New York, No. 10 Civ. 699 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, \n2015), ECF No. 330 at 9–11. \n  Since this Court’s issuance of the Liability Opinion and Remedial Order, the Facilitator \ncompleted his Final Report and Recommendation, ECF No. 597, and the Monitor has submitted \nten reports detailing the progress of the monitorship.  See Tenth Report of the Monitor, ECF No. \n754.2 \nII.  COVID-19 Pandemic \n  In March of this year, with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, government officials \nbegan taking measures to address the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus.  After declaring a \nstatewide emergency on March 7, 2020, N.Y. Exec. Order No. 202 (Mar. 7, 2020),3 Governor \nAndrew M.

N.Y.C. Emer. Exec. Order No. 108 (Apr. 19, 2020).7  \n  On June 1, 2020, the Mayor imposed a City-wide curfew prohibiting all persons from \nbeing in public except for police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and other \nessential workers.  N.Y.C. Emer. Exec. Order No. 117 (June 1, 2020).8  Also excluded were \nhomeless people, and individuals seeking medical treatment or supplies.  Id.  Mayor de Blasio \nstated that the curfew was necessary because large gatherings increase potential spread of the \nvirus, and also because peaceful demonstrations in response to the death of George Floyd had \nbeen “escalated” by individuals accused of property damage and other crimes.  Id.  The curfew \nbegan on June 1, id., and was set to expire on June 8, 2020, N.Y.C. Emer. Exec. Order No. 119 \n(June 2, 2020).9  The Mayor, however, terminated the curfew one day early.  N.Y.C. Emer. Exec. \nOrder No. 122 (June 7, 2020).10  \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n  On May 26, 2020, Plaintiffs filed an “emergency motion” alleging that the NYPD has \nengaged in racially discriminatory enforcement of social distancing directives in violation of \nthree of the Court’s prior orders related to unconstitutional, race-based policing.  Proposed Order \nto Show Cause (“OSC”) at 1, ECF No. 759.11  Plaintiffs cite racial disparities in arrests and the \nissuance of summonses, and allege that the police have used excessive force in enforcing \nCOVID-19 rules.12  Floyd and Davis Pl. Mem. at 1, ECF No. 760.  Plaintiffs also express a \n                                                \n7 Cooper Decl., Ex. I, ECF No. 773-1 at 38–39.   \n8 Cooper Decl., Ex.

Supp. 2d 540, 562 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (the Liability Opinion); Floyd v. City of \nNew York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 668, 671 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (the Remedial Order); Floyd v. City of New York, No. 08 Civ. \n1034, 517 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2015), ECF No. 517 (order approving changes to the NYPD Patrol Guide). \n12 The challenged COVID-19 enforcement includes the NYPD’s enforcement of social distancing and mask-wearing \nrequirements and the stay-at-home orders.  Floyd and Davis Pl. Mem. at 2 n.1. \n4 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-AT-HBP   Document 528   Filed 07/08/20   Page 5 of 11\nconcern that the NYPD’s enforcement of the curfew was “likewise facilitating discrimination \nagainst Black and Latinx people.”  Floyd and Davis Pls. Supp. Ltr. at 1, 3, ECF No. 768. \n  Plaintiffs have submitted a statistical analysis prepared by The Legal Aid Society, which \nindicates that “18 of the 20 precincts with the highest rates of known social distancing arrests or \nsummonses per 10,000 people are in majority Black and Latin[x] precincts,” even though \n“slightly less than half (46.2%) of [31113 social distancing] complaints concerned violations” in \nthose areas.  Day Decl. ¶ 9, ECF No. 761; see also id. (“While four of the five precincts \nreceiving the most social distancing complaints through 311 were in neighborhoods that are \nmajority white, four of the five precincts with the most COVID-19 related arrests and \nsummonses were in neighborhoods that are majority Black and Latinx.  In this vein, 78.9% of \nsummonses and 74.1% of arrests for which The Legal Aid Society was able to identify a precinct \noccurred [in those areas].” (citations omitted)).  Plaintiffs also point to information released by \nthe Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office indicating that between March 17 and May 4, 2020, “of \n[the] 40 people arrested for social distancing violations in Brooklyn . . . [35] were Black, four \nwere Hispanic, and one was white.”  Id. ¶ 15.  Further, they present reports of encounters \nbetween police and Black or Latinx individuals where NYPD officers made allegedly \nunjustifiable arrests or used excessive force.14  Id. ¶¶ 17–26. \n  Plaintiffs request four forms of relief.  First, they seek a declaration that the NYPD’s \nenforcement of COVID-19 rules constitutes a violation of the Liability Opinion, Remedial Order, \nand an order approving changes to the NYPD’s patrol guide.15  Floyd and Davis Pls. Mem. at 1.  \nSecond, they ask the Court to direct the Monitor to investigate, and file a report evaluating the \n                                                \n13 “311 serves the public and handles all requests for government and non-emergency services . . . .”  NYC 311, New \nYork State (last visited July 8, 2020), https://www.ny.gov/agencies/nyc-311. \n14 The City disputes the facts of many of these encounters.  See City Opp. at 36–39, ECF No. 771. \n15 See ECF No. 517 (approving revisions to Patrol Guide 212.11, regarding “Stop and Frisk,” and Patrol Guide \n203.25, regarding “Department Policy Prohibiting Racial Profiling”). \n5 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-AT-HBP   Document 528   Filed 07/08/20   Page 6 of 11\nlegality of, the NYPD’s COVID-19 and curfew enforcement practices.  Id. at 23.  Third, they \nrequest an order prohibiting the NYPD from further enforcement pending the Monitor’s report \nand the Court’s determination on whether enforcement may continue.  Id.  And fourth, they seek \ndiscovery from the City, including officers’ written reports and body-worn camera videos, data \non summonses and arrests, and NYPD training and supervisory material related to COVID-19 \nand curfew enforcement.  Id. at 21–22; Floyd and Davis Pls. Supp. Ltr. at 1.  The Ligon Plaintiffs \njoin in the second and fourth requests.  Ligon Pls. Ltr. at 1–2, No. 12 Civ. 2274, ECF No. 420 \n(S.D.N.Y. June 2, 2020). \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Legal Standards \n  “Once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court’s equitable \npowers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable \nremedies.”  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971).  “Although a \ndistrict court has a wide range of discretion in framing an injunction in terms it deems reasonable \nto prevent wrongful conduct, it is nonetheless the essence of equity jurisdiction that a court is \nonly empowered to grant relief no broader than necessary to cure the effects of the harm caused \nby the violation.”  City of New York v. Mickalis Pawn Shop, LLC, 645 F.3d 114, 144 (2d Cir. \n2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Thus, “[a]n injunction is overbroad when \nit seeks to restrain the defendants from engaging in legal conduct, or from engaging in illegal \nconduct that was not fairly the subject of litigation.”  Id. at 145.  And a court does not have the \npower to restrain “acts unlike or unrelated to those originally judged unlawful.”  Id. (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).16  For subjects that fall within the scope of prior litigation, \n                                                \n16 It is not clear what legal authority Plaintiffs rely upon in their request for relief.  They claim to be seeking an order \n“pursuant to Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,” which concerns discovery, and “this Court’s inherent \nequitable power to enforce its own orders and judgments.”  OSC at 1.  The Second Circuit has noted that neither the \n6 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-AT-HBP   Document 528   Filed 07/08/20   Page 7 of 11\nthe determination of what measures are necessary and appropriate to enforce its orders is \ncommitted to the district court’s sound discretion.  See In re Tronox Inc., 855 F.3d 84, 112 (2d \nCir. 2017) (“The [d]istrict court plainly had jurisdiction to interpret and enforce its own prior \norder . . . .  The court’s choice of how to enforce the order is reviewed for abuse of discretion.” \n(internal quotation marks, citation, and alterations omitted)). \n  “The Court has the relevant authority as part of its inherent power to enforce its \njudgments, and it is clear that appropriate discovery should be granted where significant \nquestions regarding noncompliance with a court order have been raised.”  Abdi v. McAleenan, \nNo. 17 Civ. 721, 2019 WL 1915306, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2019) (internal quotation marks, \ncitation, and alterations omitted) (collecting cases). \nII.  Analysis \nA. Request for Declaration, Investigation, and Injunction  \n  Plaintiffs allege that during street encounters related to COVID-19 enforcement, the \nNYPD engaged in race-based discrimination.  Floyd and Davis Pls. Mem. at 2.  As examples of \nthis discrimination, they allege (1) racial disparity in the issuance of summonses and arrests in \npredominantly Black and Latinx neighborhoods as compared to lax enforcement of social \ndistancing in “crowded parks, synagogues, and bars frequented by white persons,” id. at 3–6, 18; \n(2) racial disparity in social distancing arrests as evidenced by data released by the Brooklyn \nDistrict Attorney’s Office indicating that between March 17 and May 4, 2020, 35 of 40 people \narrested for social distancing violations in Brooklyn were Black, four were Latinx, and one was \n                                                \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure nor case law permit a freestanding “motion to enforce,” and that although there are \nvarious methods for enforcement of a class action settlement (or an injunction), “[e]ach one of these (or other) \npossibilities, however, carries its own procedures, its own standards for granting relief by the district court, and its \nown standards of review . . . thus making identification of the precise nature of the motion an essential for \n[appellate] review (and, we believe, for the district court’s decision in the first instance).”  Martens v. Thomann, 273 \nF.3d 159, 172 (2d Cir. 2001).  At a minimum, however, a party requesting an order enforcing prior rulings must \nshow that the conduct complained of falls within the scope of the litigation.  \n7 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-AT-HBP   Document 528   Filed 07/08/20   Page 8 of 11\nwhite, Day Decl. ¶ 15; (3) use of excessive force in enforcement of social distancing against \n“Black and Latinx persons only,” Def. Mem. at 14–15; (4) stopping of individuals “with little or \nno apparent justification” in “situations [that] frequently started with social distancing and then \nescalated to stops and the use of force against bystanders,” id. at 15; and (5) contrast in “posture \nof the police toward the community” as evidenced by the tone and language of the public service \nannouncements broadcast by the NYPD in Queensbridge, a public housing development in \nQueens with predominantly Black and Latinx residents, as compared to those used in Nolita, a \nneighborhood in Manhattan with few Black or Latinx residents, id.17  \n  To be sure, some of the alleged police conduct described by Plaintiffs falls squarely \nwithin the ambit of Floyd v. City of New York.18  In that case, the Court determined that the \nCity’s policy of conducting suspicionless and racially motivated stops and frisks violated the \nConstitution, see Liability Opinion, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 658–60; Remedial Order, 959 F. Supp. 2d \nat 671, and ordered the NYPD to make changes to its policies, training, supervision, auditing, \nperformance evaluation system, and disciplinary process.  Remedial Order, 959 F. Supp. 2d at \n677–78.  The Court appointed the Monitor to assist the parties in developing and implementing \nreforms, and to report on the NYPD’s progress in complying with the Court’s mandates.  Id. at \n676–78, 686–87.  The Monitor’s work is ongoing and encompasses all suspicionless and race-\n                                                \n17 Approximately 48% and 33% of Queensbridge residents are Black and Latinx, respectively.  Census Tract 25, \nQueens, NY, Census Reporter (last visited June 29, 2020), https://censusreporter.org/profiles/14000US36081002500 \n-census-tract-25-queens-ny.  In Nolita, approximately 80% of residents are white or Asian, and approximately 10% \nare Black and Latinx.  Nolita (North of Little Italy) Neighborhood in New York, New York (NY), 10012 Detailed \nProfile, City-Data.Com (last visited June 29, 2020), http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Nolita-New-York-\nNY.html.  The Court takes judicial notice of the demographics of these neighborhoods.  See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b) \n(“The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally known \nwithin the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose \naccuracy cannot be reasonably questioned.”); see also United States v. Alvarado, 923 F.2d 253, 256 (2d Cir. 1991) \n(taking judicial notice of population statistics in the Eastern District of New York and accepting them as a proxy for \ncorresponding statistics about venire).   \n18 Plaintiffs do not allege that the NYPD engaged in racially discriminatory COVID-19 or curfew enforcement with \nrespect to NYCHA or TAP buildings, as would be required to bring their motion within the scope of the Davis and \nLigon cases, respectively. \n8 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-AT-HBP   Document 528   Filed 07/08/20   Page 9 of 11\nbased stops, including those which may have taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic.19  The \nCourt is not inclined to short-circuit that process. \n  Much of the police conduct alleged by Plaintiffs, however, extends beyond the \nsuspicionless and racially motivated stops and frisks addressed by the Court in Floyd.  For \nexample, Plaintiffs claim that in the course of enforcement related to COVID-19 rules, police \nofficers have disproportionately arrested and employed excessive force against Black and Latinx \nindividuals.  Floyd and Davis Pls. Mem. at 14–18, 20–21.  Plaintiffs also allege that the City and \nNYPD leadership have willfully ignored this conduct.  Id. at 19.  These claims are deeply \ntroubling.  But, whatever their merits, they do not fall squarely within the scope of the policies \nand practices adjudicated in this litigation.  Likewise, the request for a blanket injunction barring \nthe NYPD from COVID-19 enforcement, see Floyd and Davis Pls. Mem. at 1, would interfere \nwith a wide range of police conduct that is outside the bounds of this case, and would halt even \nlawful enforcement.  If individuals have been injured by racial bias in the NYPD’s making of \narrests or use of force in the context of COVID-19 or curfew enforcement, they have the right to \npursue those allegations in a plenary action.  But, in its discretion, the Court concludes that \nPlaintiffs’ motion seeking to apply the Court’s prior orders in the Ligon, Floyd, and Davis cases \nis not an appropriate vehicle to redress those claims.   \n  Pointing to two cases, Plaintiffs argue that a court can expand on the terms of a previous \ninjunction to address further violations of a similar type.  Floyd and Davis Pls. Mem. at 10–12; \nsee Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 684–85 (1978); Handschu v. Police Dep’t of New York, 219 \nF. Supp. 3d 388, 392–93 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).  It is true that “[i]n fashioning a remedy, [the Court \n                                                \n19 The Monitor has already committed to requesting from the City “information necessary to evaluate stops, frisks, \nsearches and trespass enforcement in the course of” COVID-19 and curfew enforcement, and to “assess and report \non that information in the ways, and to the extent, consistent with his mandate.”  Monitor Ltr. at 23, ECF No. 785.  \nThe City has agreed to comply with the Monitor’s requests.  Id. \n9 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-AT-HBP   Document 528   Filed 07/08/20   Page 10 of 11\nhas] ample authority to go beyond earlier orders and to address each element contributing to the \nviolation.”  Hutto, 437 U.S. at 687.  And this Court has done so by issuing a number of orders \naddressing factors that contributed to the constitutional violations identified in the Liability \nOpinion.  See, e.g., ECF No. 662 (directing the NYPD to “implement a program for \nsystematically receiving, assessing, and acting on information regarding adverse findings on the \nconduct of police officers involving illegal stops or illegal trespass enforcements” (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted)); ECF No. 767 (setting out required NYPD procedures for \nearly intervention to correct officer behavior that suggests a risk of engaging in illegal stops or \nillegal trespass enforcement).  But it is not within this Court’s authority to amplify its prior \nrulings to encompass a different set of potentially unconstitutional practices. \n  Accordingly, that portion of Plaintiffs’ motion seeking an order declaring that the City \nand NYPD are in violation of this Court’s earlier orders, directing the Monitor to investigate \nCOVID-19 and curfew enforcement involving police conduct outside the scope of this litigation, \nand enjoining the NYPD from participating in COVID-19 enforcement is DENIED. \nB.  Request for Discovery \n  To the extent that Plaintiffs’ request for information is related to alleged police stops, \nfrisks, searches, and trespass enforcement, such requests are already being addressed by the \nMonitor.  See Floyd and Davis Pls. Mem. at 21–22; Ligon Pls. Ltr. at 1–2.  Insofar as their \nrequests reach beyond that, however, Plaintiffs have failed to show that ordering such discovery \nfalls within, or would be an appropriate use of, the Court’s inherent power to enforce its \njudgments. \n  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion to compel discovery is DENIED. \n \n10 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-AT-HBP   Document 528   Filed 07/08/20   Page 11 of 11\nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ requests for an order (1) declaring that the NYPD’s \nenforcement of COVID-19 rules violates the Court’s prior orders, (2) directing the Monitor to \ninvestigate COVID-19 and curfew enforcement involving police conduct outside the scope of \nthis litigation, (3) enjoining the NYPD from enforcing COVID-19 rules, and (4) compelling \ndiscovery are DENIED.  See No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 759; No. 10 Civ. 699, ECF No. 502.  \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 430 in case number 12 Civ. \n2274. \nSO ORDERED. \n \nDated: July 8, 2020 \n  New York, New York                                                                                               \n11 ",

(Moses, Matthew) (Entered: \n05/03/2013) \n05/24/2013  275   OPINION & ORDER: #103248 On March 28, 2013, this Court issued the \nsecond part of its ruling on the parties' motions for summary judgment. \nThe March 28 Opinion noted that plaintiffs had offered [a] sample of \ndecline to prosecute forms [DP forms] from various District Attorneys \noffices in support of \"the conclusion that the City has a persistent and \nwidespread practice of performing unconstitutional trespass stops and \narrests in NYCHA buildings.\" Defendant the City of New 2 York argued \nin a reply brief that the DP forms are inadmissible hearsay. I invited \nfurther briefing, which has now been submitted. In Ligon v. City of New \nYork, another case related to the NYPDs stop and frisk practices, I \nallowed the admission of DP forms describing stops outside TAP \nbuildings as evidence of the NYPDs stop practices. Unlike in this case, \nhowever, the City had conceded the admissibility of the records for that \nlimited purpose. I have already ruled in this case that DP forms are \nadmissible for the purpose of showing notice to the City of allegedly \nunconstitutional practices. Atissue now is plaintiffs request to use the DP \nforms as evidence in support of their class certification motion. For the \nreasons set forth below, the DP forms are admissible subject to the \nlimitations described below. For the foregoing reasons, the DP forms are \nadmissible as evidence of the NYPDs trespass enforcement practices in \nand around NYCHA buildings. Pursuant to the Citys request, plaintiffs \nare ordered to identify the specific DP forms summarized in plaintiffs \n\nsubmission. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Shira A.

SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.: \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nThis putative class action challenges the policies and practices that the \nNew York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") and the New York City Housing \nAuthority (\"NYCHA\") use to enforce prohibitions against trespassing on  public \nhousing property.  The lawsuit alleges that defendants' actions have resulted in a \nwidespread pattern of unlawful stops, questioning, frisks, searches, and arrests of \n1 \n\nNYCHA residents and their invited guests.1\nThis is the second of three lawsuits before this Court that challenge\nthe NYPD’s stop and frisk practices.2  Like the other two cases, and like many of\nits predecessors, this suit “thrusts to the fore difficult and troublesome issues\nregarding a sensitive area of police activity.”3  Nearly forty-five years ago, faced\nwith a rising tide of urban violence and what Justice William O. Douglas called\n“powerful hydraulic pressures”4 to give police an upper hand, the Supreme Court\nfirst confronted “the practical and constitutional arguments pressed with great\nvigor on both sides of the public debate over the power of the police to ‘stop and\nfrisk’ – as it is sometimes euphemistically termed – suspicious persons.”5\nIn Terry v. Ohio, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution permits\nstops when the police have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.  But the\nprecise contours of the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable\nstops remain fiercely debated in the courts, the newspapers, and the streets. \n1 See Amended Complaint (“Am. Compl.”) ¶ 2.\n2 See Floyd v. City of New York, No. 08 Civ. 1034; Ligon v. City of New\nYork, No. 12 Civ. 2274.\n3 Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 9 (1968).\n4 Id. at 39 (dissenting). \n5 Id. at 9-10.\n2\n\nBecause they focus on people residing or present in public housing,\nthe practices at issue in this lawsuit are more narrow than those addressed in either\nTerry or Floyd v. City of New York, both of which involved street stops.  But they\nare no less consequential.  Indeed, for many residents, the tension at the heart of\nthis lawsuit is also a central part of their daily lives: what one scholar has called the\n“decades-long battle by NYCHA tenants for a life both dignified and safe.”6 \nThe perspective of plaintiff Eleanor Britt highlights this challenge.\nBritt, a sixty-four year old African American woman, has lived in NYCHA\nhousing for more than thirty-five years.7  Like generations of NYCHA residents\nbefore her, she is a member of an anti-crime tenant organization.8  She testified at\nher deposition that she would like the police to conduct more vertical patrols\n6 Fritz Umbach, The Last Neighborhood Cops: The Rise and Fall of\nCommunity Policing in New York Public Housing 5 (2010).\n7 See Am. Compl. ¶ 103.\n8 See Deposition of Eleanor Britt (“Britt Dep.”) at 42:8-10 (“The\nTenant’s League, what we do, we have tenant patrol to try to monitor the people\ncoming and going in and out of our building and to try to keep the building safe.”).\nSee also Last Neighborhood Cops at 6 (“Anticrime organizing by public housing\nresidents in New York City was in many ways representative of the kinds of\nunheralded grassroots activism that took place around the country after World War\nII . . . . The activists, most of whom were women, understood their efforts in terms\nof civil rights. They believed that securing their fair share of municipal services,\nincluding police protection, was a fundamental right and that working for safe\nbuildings and courtyards was a chapter in the long history of working-class self-\nhelp movements.”).\n3\n\nthrough her building, because “it helps us keep the building safe . . . . [T]he more\ntheir presence is seen, the less problems we would have.”9  But Britt has also\nwitnessed serious police misconduct: \nI have seen the police approach young men in the building and I\nhave seen them just grab them and thrown them up against the\nwall and frisk them . . . . [I]t seems like there is a disparity in the\nway they deal with Black as opposed to White . . . . [I]t is a little\nexcessive when they are dealing with people of color.10\nEnsuring both dignity and safety may be challenging but it is\nabsolutely necessary.  The police officers who patrol NYCHA buildings must act\nwithin the limits imposed by the federal and state constitutions.  This lawsuit\npresents difficult and close questions.  The key one is this: are defendants acting\nwithin constitutional limits in their presumably sincere efforts to provide a safe\nenvironment for the residents of public housing?  Or, in their zeal to provide that\n9 Britt Dep. at 65:22-24.  Britt’s sentiment, according to Umbach’s\nextensive history, is both emblematic and underappreciated: “If the role of\nconservative groups in promoting law-and-order politics is well documented, the\nefforts of non-elite groups like public housing activists to mobilize around crime in\nways that also challenged some of urban liberalism’s ideals is often left\nunexamined.”  Last Neighborhood Cops at 10.\n10 Britt Dep. at 67:6-20.  “[B]efore the merger [of the NYCHA Police\nand the NYPD], we had one officer that was stationed in our building.  He knew all\nthe residents.  If there was a problem, and he would come to the parent and discuss\nwhatever the problem was and he would talk to the young men in the building and\nthere was a mutual respect we had for one another.  We don’t have that anymore, it\nis so impersonal . . . .”  Id. at 201:16-22.\n4\n\nprotection, are they violating the rights of the very residents (and guests) whom\nthey seek to protect?  \nNine of the original eighteen plaintiffs settled their claims.  Of the\nremaining nine, eight have been arrested for trespass by the NYPD11 and five live\nin NYCHA housing.12  They have brought twelve causes of action against the\nNYPD and NYCHA under federal, state, and local laws and under the United\nStates and New York State constitutions.  Defendants have moved for partial\nsummary judgment on most of these claims.  The parties agreed to brief these\nmotions in two parts: the first part, adjudicated here, addresses the individual\ncircumstances of plaintiffs’ arrests and tenancies.13  The second part, which has yet\n11 These plaintiffs, whom the parties call the “arrested plaintiffs,” are\nRoman Jackson, Kristin Johnson, Lashaun Smith, Andrew Washington, Patrick\nLittlejohn, Raymond Osorio, Vaughn Frederick, and Rikia Evans.  Eleanor Britt is\nthe only remaining plaintiff who was never arrested.\n12 These “resident plaintiffs” are Eleanor Britt, Rikia Evans, Patrick\nLittlejohn, Andrew Washington, and Vaughn Frederick.  Washington and\nFrederick are not authorized by NYCHA to be tenants.\n13 The parties have made the following submissions: Defendant City of\nNew York’s Memorandum of Law in Support of Its Motion for Summary\nJudgment Based on Plaintiffs’ Individual Circumstances (“City Mem.”),\nMemorandum of Law of Defendant New York City [Housing] Authority in\nSupport of Its Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff’s (sic) Individual Claims\n(“NYCHA Mem.”), Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants’\nMotions for Partial Summary Judgment (“Pl. Mem.”), Defendant City of New\nYork’s Memorandum of Law in Further Support of Its Motion for Summary\nJudgment Based on Plaintiffs’ Individual Circumstances (“City Rep. Mem.”), and\n5\n\nto be briefed, will address defendants’ practices and policies.  For the reasons\nexplained below, defendants’ motions are granted in part and denied in part.\nII. LEGAL STANDARD ON A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nSummary judgment in defendants’ favor is appropriate only if they\nshow “that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [that they are]\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.”14  “An issue of fact is genuine if the\nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving\nparty.  A fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit.”15  \nBecause they are moving for summary judgment, defendants “bear[]\nthe burden of establishing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact.”16  To\nReply Memorandum of Law of Defendant New York City Housing Authority in\nFurther Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs’ Individual\nClaims (“NYCHA Rep. Mem.”).  In addition, they have submitted Defendant City\nof New York’s Local Civil Rule 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Facts (“City 56.1”),\nLocal Rule 56.1 Statement in Support of Defendant New York City Housing\nAuthority’s Motion for Summary Judgment (“NYCHA 56.1”), and Plaintiffs’\nLocal Rule 56.1 Counterstatement of Additional Material Facts (“Pl. Counter\n56.1”).  Plaintiffs’ responses to defendants’ 56.1 statements are abbreviated as “Pl.\nCity 56.1” and “Pl. NYCHA 56.1,” respectively.\n14 Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n15 Fincher v.

City of Bridgeport Police Dep’t, 613 F.3d 336, 340 (2d Cir.\n2010). \n6\n\ndefeat defendants’ motions, plaintiffs “‘must do more than simply show that there\nis some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,’”17 and “may not rely on\nconclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation.”18\nIn deciding these motions, I must “construe the facts in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party,” that is, to plaintiffs, “and must resolve all\nambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant[s],” that is,\nagainst defendants.19  However, “‘[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the\nevidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury\nfunctions, not those of a judge.’”20  “The role of the court is not to resolve disputed\nissues of fact but to assess whether there are any factual issues to be tried.”21 \nIII.

I address the\nlegal standards applicable to each of these claims below.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. The Arrested Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment Claims Against the\nCity for Unlawful Terry Stops and False Arrest\n1. Legal Standard for a Stop\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees that “[t]he right of the people to\nbe secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon\nprobable cause.”22  “‘[T]he police can stop and briefly detain a person for\ninvestigative purposes if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by\narticulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot, even if the officer lacks\n22  In one of his most popular songs, the rapper Jay-Z – who grew up in\nNYCHA’s Marcy Houses in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn –\nshowcased his knowledge of these Fourth Amendment rights.  See 99 Problems,\nThe Black Album (Roc-A-Fella Records 2003).  See also Caleb Mason, Jay-Z’s 99\nProblems, Verse 2: A Close Reading with Fourth Amendment Guidance for Cops\nand Perps, 56 St. Louis L.J. 567 (2012).\n8\n\nprobable cause.’”23  This form of investigative detention is now known as a Terry\nstop.24  “While ‘reasonable suspicion’ is a less demanding standard than probable\ncause and requires a showing considerably less than preponderance of the\nevidence, the Fourth Amendment requires at least a minimal level of objective\njustification for making the stop.”25  “‘The officer [making a Terry stop] . . . must\nbe able to articulate something more than an inchoate and unparticularized\nsuspicion or hunch.’”26  “Reasonable suspicion is an objective standard; hence, the\nsubjective intentions or motives of the officer making the stop are irrelevant.”27 \nIt is sometimes the case that a police officer may observe, “a series of\nacts, each of them perhaps innocent in itself, but which taken together warrant[]\nfurther investigation.”28  “An individual’s presence in an area of expected criminal\nactivity, standing alone, is not enough to support a reasonable, particularized\n23 United States v. Swindle, 407 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting\nUnited States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7 (1989)).  Under New York law, the\njustifications required for different levels of police intrusion were established in\nPeople v. DeBour, 40 N.Y.2d 210 (1976).\n24 See Terry, 392 U.S. 1.\n25 Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 123 (2000).\n26 Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 329 (1990) (quoting Sokolow, 490\nU.S. at 7).\n27 United States v. Bayless, 201 F.3d 116, 133 (2d Cir. 2000).\n28 Terry, 392 U.S. at 22.\n9\n\nsuspicion that the person is committing a crime.”29  However, “the fact that the stop\noccurred in a ‘high crime area’ [may be] among the relevant contextual\nconsiderations in a Terry analysis.”30  A court “must look at the totality of the\ncircumstances of each case to see whether the detaining officer has a particularized\nand objective basis for suspecting legal wrongdoing.”31  “[T]he proper inquiry is\nnot whether each fact considered in isolation denotes unlawful behavior, but\nwhether all the facts taken together support a reasonable suspicion of\nwrongdoing.”32\n2. Legal Standard for an Arrest\nThe Fourth Amendment prohibits arrests in the absence of probable\ncause.  Such cause exists “when the officers have knowledge or reasonably\ntrustworthy information of facts and circumstances that are sufficient to warrant a\nperson of reasonable caution in the belief that the person to be arrested has\ncommitted or is committing a crime.”33  “While probable cause requires more than\n29 Wardlow, 528 U.S. at 124 (citing Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47\n(1979)).\n30 Id. (quoting Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 144, 147-48 (1972)).\n31 United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 273 (2002) (quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n32 United States v. Lee, 916 F.2d 814, 819 (2d Cir. 1990).\n33 Weyant v. Okst, 101 F.3d 845, 852 (2d Cir. 1996).\n10\n\n‘mere suspicion’ of wrongdoing, its focus is on ‘probabilities,’ not ‘hard\ncertainties.’”34 “[N]o probable cause exists to arrest where a suspect’s actions are\ntoo ambiguous to raise more than a generalized suspicion of involvement in\ncriminal activity.”35  The lawfulness of an arrest does not require an ultimate\nfinding of guilt.36  “The question of whether or not probable cause existed may be\ndeterminable as a matter of law if there is no dispute as to the pertinent events and\nthe knowledge of the officers . . . or may require a trial if the facts are in dispute.”37\n3. Raymond Osorio’s Stop and Arrest\nPlaintiff Raymond Osorio testified at his deposition that he left the\nNYCHA apartment of his friend, Andre Smith, in the late afternoon of November\n18, 2010.  When he was about six steps out of the building, three officers\n“charged” him, asked him what he was doing, and then grabbed him and brought\nhim back into the lobby of the building.38  Although the City disputes these facts, it \nacknowledges that summary judgment regarding the stop is inappropriate because,\n34 Selinger v. City of New York, 453 Fed. App’x 93, 94 (2d Cir. 2011)\n(quoting Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 454 (1957); Illinois v. Gates, 462\nU.S. 213, 231 (1983)). \n35 United States v. Valentine, 539 F.3d 88, 94 (2d Cir. 2008).\n36 See Weyant, 101 F.3d at 852.\n37 Id.\n38 Deposition of Raymond Osorio (“Osorio Dep.”) at 39-42, 83-86.\n11\n\nif true, Osorio’s version of events describes an unlawful stop.39  Nevertheless, the\nCity argues that the following events, as described by Osorio, provide probable\ncause to justify an arrest.40\nOsorio testified that once back in the lobby, he told the officers that he\nhad been visiting Smith in apartment 5C and gave them his photo ID.41  Two\nofficers went upstairs to investigate while two others stayed with Osorio in the\nlobby.  When the officers returned, they informed Osorio that a woman in\napartment 5C said that she had not seen Osorio in an hour and that he had therefore\nbeen trespassing.  Osorio believed that the woman was Andre Smith’s sister,\nKeisha Smith, and he explained to the officers that because Keisha had been in the\nback room of the apartment, she had not seen him for an hour even though he had\n39 See City Mem. at 8.\n40 In criminal prosecutions, the “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine\ngenerally requires that evidence obtained through an unlawful stop be suppressed. \nBut the Second Circuit has determined that the doctrine is not applicable in section\n1983 lawsuits.  That is, if police officers develop probable cause after having\nconducted an unlawful stop, they will be liable only for the unlawful stop, not any\nsubsequent arrest or imprisonment.  See Townes v. City of New York, 176 F.3d 138,\n145 (2d Cir. 1999) (establishing this rule).  Accord DiMascio v. City of Albany,\n205 F.3d 1322 (2d Cir. 2000) (unpublished opinion). Therefore, I must determine\nwhether the officers developed probable cause to arrest Osorio, notwithstanding\nthe fact that material disputes of fact prevent summary judgment regarding the\nlegality of his stop. \n41 See Pl. Counter 56.1 ¶¶ 103-105 (citing Osorio Dep. at 92-96).\n12\n\njust left the apartment a few minutes earlier.  Despite this explanation, the officers\narrested Osorio. \nOne of the two officers who went upstairs, Ruben Arroyo-Perez,\ntestified at his deposition that he took Osorio’s ID and went to apartment 5C,\nshowed the ID to Keisha Smith, and asked her if Osorio had been visiting with her\nor had been in her apartment.42  She told him no.  He asked if Andre Smith was\npresently in the apartment because (as he explained later) he “wanted to speak to\n[Osorio’s] friend, if his friend was actually there.”43  Keisha said that Andre was\nnot there.\nPlaintiffs argue that there are disputes of fact regarding whether\nArroyo-Perez actually asked Keisha Smith if Andre Smith was in the apartment. \nBut the facts in the record establish no genuine dispute.44  After speaking with\n42 See Deposition of Ruben Arroyo-Perez (“Arroyo-Perez Dep.”) at\n89:9-11.\n43 Id. at 89:25-90:3.  \n44 Plaintiffs attempt to create a material dispute of fact by highlighting\nArroyo-Perez’s deposition statement that he was only “pretty sure” that he had\nasked Keisha Smith whether Andre Smith was in the apartment.  See Pl. Mem. at\nn.9 (citing to Arroyo-Perez Dep. at 89:21).  Immediately after using the phrase\n“pretty sure,” however, Arroyo-Perez used unequivocal language (“a hundred\npercent sure”), and then, upon being asked to clarify, he again answered in the\naffirmative. Arroyo-Perez Dep. at 89:21-90:7.  Plaintiffs argue that “[n]either\nKeisha Smith nor Andre Smith provided testimony in this action, and Officer\nArroyo-Perez’s account of the arrest lacks credibility.”  Pl.

These facts gave officer Arroyo-Perez probable cause to arrest Osorio\nfor trespass.\nOsorio’s Fourth Amendment claim for an unlawful seizure survives\nbut summary judgment is granted to defendants on his Fourth Amendment claim\nfor unlawful arrest.45   \n4. Patrick Littlejohn’s Stop and Arrest\nPatrick Littlejohn testified at his deposition that he and his friend\nDavid were waiting for the elevator in the lobby of the NYCHA building at 3020\nYates Avenue on January 14, 2009.46  David lived in the building and the two\nyoung men were going to his apartment.  Police Officers Carmelo Quiles and\nHowever, the absence of testimony from either Keisha or Andre does not establish\na material dispute of fact and plaintiffs’ statement regarding the credibility of\nArroyo-Perez’ testimony is conclusory and unsupported by any evidence.  In any\nevent, the Court may not assess credibility at the summary judgment stage.\n45 See Townes, 176 F.3d at 145 (noting that an unlawful stop, even if\nfollowed by a lawful arrest, “might at most support slight or nominal damages”).\n46 See Deposition of Patrick Littlejohn (“Littlejohn Dep.”) at 110:22-\n113:2. \n14\n\nGranit Selimaj entered the building and approached Littlejohn.  According to\nLittlejohn:\nQuiles says “what are you doing here, where are you going?”  I’m\nlike “I’m going to go with him to his house.”  He asked David “do\nyou got ID?”  David said “yeah.”  He showed him his ID.  “Is he\nwith you?”  He said “yeah.”  Then he told David to go upstairs  \n. . . . [H]is partner Selimaj was like “what you going to do with\nhim?”  He’s like “taking him in.”  Selimaj was telling him “we not\ngoing to take him in.”  He’s like “there’s nothing that we got on\nthem.”  Then he’s like, “no, I’m taking this one in, I’m taking this\none.”  Quiles tells me to turn around he put the cuffs on me.47 \nAlthough Quiles arrested Littlejohn for trespass,48 the City does not\nargue that he had probable cause to do so.  Instead, it argues that Quiles had\nprobable cause to arrest Littlejohn for truancy.  The Supreme Court has made clear\nthat the inquiry into whether or not probable cause existed to make an arrest is an\nobjective one that does not turn on the state of mind of the arresting officer and\nthat if there was probable cause to arrest for any offense, then there is no viable\nclaim for false arrest.49  Thus, Littlejohn’s arrest was lawful if there was objective\n47 Id. at 112:11-22 (quotation marks and question marks added for\nclarity).  According to this testimony, Littlejohn was stopped and arrested at the\nsame moment.\n48  See City 56.1 ¶ 196.\n49 Devenpeck v. Alford, 543 U.S. 146, 153 (2004).  Accord Jaegly v.\nCouch, 439 F.3d 149, 152 (2d Cir. 2006) (“[A] claim for false arrest turns only on\nwhether probable cause existed to arrest a defendant, and . . . it is not relevant\nwhether probable cause existed with respect to each individual charge, or, indeed,\n15\n\nprobable cause to arrest him for any offense.50\nIf Littlejohn’s account of the interaction is true, however, there was no\nsuch probable cause.  The arrest took place between noon and 1:00 p.m. on a\nschool day, which in many schools is the standard lunch hour.  As plaintiffs\npersuasively argue:\n[I]n their brief encounter with Mr. Littlejohn, neither officer asked\nMr. Littlejohn his age to determine whether he was of mandatory\nschool age, whether he was enrolled in school, was home for\nlunch, or had any of several other valid reasons to be away from\nschool.  There is simply no evidence that “school” was even\nmentioned in the encounter.51 \nany charge actually invoked by the arresting officer at the time of arrest.”).\n50 The parties debate whether or not officers are empowered to make a\n“criminal” arrest for truancy under New York Education Law § 3213(2)(a) or\nmerely to make a noncriminal seizure.  In Matter of Shannon B., 70 N.Y.2d 458,\n464 (1987), the New York Court of Appeals affirmed the power of police officers\nto enforce that truancy law.  Plaintiffs point to Matter of Julio R., 492 N.Y.S.2d\n912, 914 (Fam. Ct. Richmond Co. 1985) in which the court explained that the\nEducation Law authorizes “a noncriminal detention, rather than an arrest in the\nclassic, criminal law sense.”  Both according to the case law that plaintiffs cite and\nthe NYPD Patrol Guide, officers should take youths suspected of truancy to school\nor the Department of Education, not to jail.  See Patrol Guide § 215-07, Ex. 36 to\nDeclaration of Katharine Brooker, plaintiffs’ counsel (“Brooker Decl.”); In re\nD’Angelo H., 584 N.Y.S.2d 699, 700 (4th Dep’t 1992).  Defendants argue that the\nappropriate post-arrest protocol is irrelevant to the Fourth Amendment question of\nwhether Quiles had probable cause to arrest Littlejohn for truancy.  Ultimately, this\ndebate is immaterial to my holding.\n51 Pl. Mem. at 15.  Plaintiffs point out that in Shannon B., 70 N.Y.2d\n458, the New York Court of Appeals found sufficient factual basis for a seizure\nbased on truancy when the middle school-aged girl was standing less than a block\n16\n\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Devenpeck v. Alford, “[w]hether\nprobable cause exists depends upon the reasonable conclusion to be drawn from\nthe facts known to the arresting officer at the time of the arrest.”52  At the time of\nhis arrest, Littlejohn was sixteen years old (a fact that the officers do not claim they\nknew) and was over six feet tall.53  Although the officers knew that Littlejohn lived\nin the area, defendants have not shown that either Quiles or Selimaj knew specific\nfacts that would lead to the reasonable conclusion that Littlejohn was truant from\nschool.54  A reasonable juror could conclude that there was no probable cause for\nthis arrest.  Summary judgment in defendants’ favor on Littlejohn’s Fourth\nAmendment claim is denied.\n5. Lashaun Smith’s Stop and Arrest\nPlaintiff Lashaun Smith testified at his deposition that he spent the \nfrom school at 10:15 a.m. and was unable to explain why she was not in school.\n52 543 U.S. at 152.\n53 See Pl. Mem. at n.14.  In New York City, education is compulsory\n“until the last day of session in the school year in which the student becomes\nseventeen years of age.”  N.Y. Educ. L. § 3205; N.Y.C.

As he reached the bottom of the stairs, a uniformed officer\ncame into the stairway and asked him if he lived in the building.57  According to\nSmith: \nI said no, I was visiting; he asked me do I have ID; I said yes; I\nshow him my [current Virginia] ID, and then I showed him my\nother ID, my old [expired] New York ID, and that was it, and he\nasked me to step into the lobby, and I step into the lobby; that’s\nwhen I encountered there was two more officers, a lady and a\nmale.58\na. Smith’s Terry Stop \nPlaintiffs argue that Smith was seized in the stairway when the officer\nencountered him and immediately questioned him.59  Defendants argue that Smith\n55 See Deposition of Lashaun Smith (“Smith Dep.”) at 67-68.\n56 See Pl. Counter 56.1 ¶¶ 119-129.\n57 Smith Dep. at 80:10-81:5.\n58 Id. at 80:14-19.  The police officers recount a significantly different\nnarrative, see City 56.1 ¶¶ 136-168 (recounting many facts on the basis of the\nofficers’ testimony despite Smith’s contradictory testimony), but summary\njudgment is only appropriate on the basis of undisputed facts.\n59 See Pl. Mem. at 7.\n18\n\nwas only seized after he provided the two ID cards and was told to step into the\nlobby.60  The Supreme Court has explained that \n[e]ven  when  law  enforcement  officers  have  no  basis  for\nsuspecting a particular individual, they may pose questions, ask\nfor  identification,  and  request  consent  to  search  luggage  —\nprovided they do not induce cooperation by coercive means. See\nFlorida  v.  Bostick,  501  U.S.  429,  434-35  (1991)  (citations\nomitted). If a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the\nencounter, then he or she has not been seized.61\nDefendants argue that because the officer’s tone of voice was normal62\nand because Smith testified that seeing the officer did not make him nervous or\nscared,63 the encounter was not coercive.64  Plaintiffs argue that a reasonable jury\ncould find that, in the confines of a stairwell, a reasonable person would not feel\nfree to walk past the officer and terminate the encounter.65  \nI need not resolve this dispute because both parties agree Smith was\nseized once the officer returned Smith’s expired New York ID, held on to Smith’s\n60 See City Rep. Mem. at 2.\n61 United States v. Drayton, 536 U.S. 194, 201 (2002).\n62 See Smith Dep. at 84:13-18.\n63 See id. at 81:6-12.\n64 See City Rep. Mem. at 1 n.4.\n65 See Pl. Mem. at 9.\n19\n\nVirginia ID, and asked him to step into the lobby.66  He was not free to leave\nbecause the officer had taken his identification.  Under Smith’s version of events,\nat the time of the seizure the officer knew that (1) the building was in a high crime\narea,67 (2) Smith said he was a visitor in the building, and (3) Smith produced two\nIDs (with matching names and photos of him), one of which was expired and one\ncurrent.  Defendants also argue that Smith’s “behavior and demeanor” was\nsomehow suspicious, but they cite to no undisputed facts for that claim.68  The facts\nof the encounter, as described by Smith, are insufficient to establish reasonable\n66 See City Mem. at 10 (conceding that Smith was “stopped” at that\npoint).\n67 Plaintiffs acknowledge that the building was in an NYPD “Impact\nZone” and Smith testified that he had lived in the area for a while and said “it’s a\nvery bad neighborhood.”  Pl. City 56.1 ¶¶ 139-140; Smith Dep. at 60:16-25. \nPlaintiffs argue that based on various findings of this court in Floyd v. City of New\nYork, No. 08 Civ. 1034, I should not credit the officers’ statements regarding the\narea’s high crime. See Pl. Mem. at 10-11.  Nonetheless, assuming, arguendo, that\nSmith’s account is true, there would still be no reasonable suspicion for this stop\neven if the area were “high crime.”\n68 See City Mem. at 9.  Defendants’ primary evidence supporting\nSmith’s nervousness, as detailed at page 9 of the City’s Memorandum of Law, is\nflatly contradicted by Smith’s version of events.  But even if defendants could cite\nto undisputed actions that Smith took, courts should look skeptically on any claim\nthat an individual appeared nervous or furtive.  See United States v. Broomfield,\n417 F.3d 654, 655 (7th Cir. 2005) (Posner, J.) (“Whether you stand still or move,\ndrive above, below, or at the speed limit, you will be described by the police as\nacting suspiciously should they wish to stop or arrest you. Such subjective,\npromiscuous appeals to an ineffable intuition should not be credited.”).\n20\n\nsuspicion for a stop.  There is nothing suspicious about a person walking down the\nstairs of a NYCHA building in a high crime area. There is nothing suspicious about\na person stating that he was visiting a friend in a NYCHA building.  And there is\nnothing suspicious about a person having two ID cards, one expired and one\ncurrent, from two different states.  If a juror credited Smith’s testimony, she could\nconclude that there was no reasonable suspicion to justify stopping him.  Summary\njudgment in defendants’ favor on Smith’s Fourth Amendment claim for an\nunlawful stop is therefore denied. \nb. Smith’s Arrest\nAccording to Smith, there were two other officers waiting in the lobby\nwhen he and the first officer emerged from the stairwell: \nOne of the officers asked Mr. Smith which apartment he had been\nvisiting, and he responded Apartment 6D.  Officer Mumper left\nthe  lobby  to  investigate.    Officer  Mumper  returned  several\nminutes later and reported that the person who answered the door\n[of Apartment 6D] could not identify Mr. Smith.  Mr. Smith asked\nOfficer Mumper if “[a] guy with dreads answered the door?”\nOfficer Mumper [said yes].  Mr. Smith explained that Tarion\nWashington was blind and would not be able to identify him from\na photo ID.  Mr. Smith asked the officers to take him upstairs so\nthat Tarion Washington could identify him by his voice.  The\nofficers handcuffed Mr. Smith and placed him under arrest for\ncriminal trespass.69 \n69 Pl. Counter 56.1 ¶¶ 133-148 (accurately summarizing Smith Dep. at\n84:24-88:23). \n21\n\nNeither party solicited the testimony of Tarion Washington, the blind\nman with dreads who answered the door.  The only admissible evidence regarding\nthat conversation comes from the following deposition testimony of Officer\nMumper:\nQ: Is there anything about your interaction with the man who\ncame to the door that led you to believe that he might be\nblind?\nA: No, not that I can recall.\nQ: What did you say to this man when he opened the door?\nA: I introduced myself as Officer Mumper. I asked him if he\nknew a Lashaun Smith and he said no. I asked him if\nmaybe he knew him as Shaun Smith and he said no.  And\nI asked him one more time . . . and he said no.\n. . . \nQ: Did you attempt to show Mr. Washington . . . Mr. Smith’s\nID that you had brought?\nA: . . . I did hold it up to him for him to look at the picture.\n. . . \nQ: But you asked him to look at the picture?\nA: I think so, yes.\nQ: Did he appear to be looking at the picture?\nA: To the best of my recollection, yes.\nQ: Yes. Did he say anything about whether he recognized the\nperson in the picture?\nA: No.\nQ: Did you ask Mr. Washington if he lived in the apartment?\nA: No.70\n70 Deposition of James Mumper (“Mumper Dep.”) at 114:14-116:3. \nPlaintiffs cite to the testimony of Smith’s friend (and Washington’s sister) Shawne\nJones to support the notion that Mumper failed to describe Smith to Washington\nwith enough specificity “so that Tarion Washington could reasonably identify Mr.\nSmith.”  Pl. City 56.1 ¶ 162.  But Jones’ testimony regarding what Washington\ntold her about the conversation he had with Mumper is hearsay and inadmissible\n22\n\nDefendants argue that Mumper had probable cause to arrest Smith because the\nperson who answered the door of Apartment 6D did not know anybody who went\nby Smith’s name, which made it likely that Smith had not in fact been visiting that\napartment, as he had claimed, and was trespassing.  Plaintiffs respond with the\nfollowing argument: “After Mr. Smith demonstrated his familiarity with the\nresidents of apartment 6D by indicating that the person who answered the door\nwould be blind and would be wearing dreadlocks, a reasonable jury could find that\nOfficer Mumper lacked probable cause.”71  For support, plaintiffs cite to the\nSecond Circuit’s statement in Panetta v. Crowley that “an officer may not\ndisregard plainly exculpatory evidence.”72\nAs defendants note, the Second Circuit has simultaneously made clear\nthat “‘[t]he fact that an innocent explanation may be consistent with the facts\nalleged . . . does not negate probable cause,’”73 and that \nfor the truth of the matter asserted (that is, the content of Washington’s\nconversation with Mumper).\n71 Pl. Mem. at 11.\n72 Panetta v. Crowley, 460 F.3d 388, 395 (2d Cir. 2006).  Accord\nKerman v. City of New York, 261 F.3d 229, 241 (2d Cir. 2001); Kuehl v. Burtis,\n173 F.3d 646, 650 (8th Cir. 1999).\n73 Panetta, 460 F.3d at 395 (quoting United States v. Fama, 758 F.2d\n834, 838 (2d Cir. 1985)).\n23\n\nonce a police officer has a reasonable basis for believing there is\nprobable cause, he is not required to explore and eliminate every\ntheoretically plausible claim of innocence before making an arrest. \nAlthough  a  better  procedure  may  [be]  for  the  officers  to\ninvestigate  plaintiff’s  version  of  events  more  completely,  the\narresting officer does not have to prove plaintiff’s version wrong\nbefore arresting him.74\nThe inquiry is therefore highly fact specific.  Although police officers need not\n“believe with certainty that the arrestee will be successfully prosecuted,” they also\nmay not ignore clearly exculpatory evidence.75\nIn this case, Mumper ignored two important pieces of evidence.  The\nfact that Smith knew that Washington would answer the door at apartment 6D\nstrongly corroborated his earlier statement that he had just been in the apartment. \nAnd the fact that Smith told the officer that Washington was blind significantly\nundercut the probative value of Mumper’s act of showing the ID to Washington. \nMumper’s investigation was also extremely cursory: according to his own\ntestimony, he failed to find out if Washington recognized the person in the ID,\nfailed to observe that Washington was blind, failed to determine whether\nWashington was the tenant of the apartment, failed to ask Washington if anybody\nhad recently left the apartment, and refused Smith’s request to accompany the\n74 Curley v. Village of Suffern, 268 F.3d 65, 70 (2d Cir. 2001).\n75 Id.\n24\n\nofficer upstairs so that Washington could identify him by voice.  If Mumper had\nconducted a more thorough investigation, he would surely have discovered that\nSmith had just left the apartment and was an invitee.  “Probable cause requires an\nofficer to have ‘knowledge or reasonably trustworthy information sufficient to\nwarrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been\ncommitted by the person to be arrested.’”76  If a juror believes Smith’s version of\nevents, she could reasonably conclude that Mumper ignored clearly exculpatory\nevidence and was insufficiently cautious when arresting Smith without conducting\na thorough investigation.  Summary judgment in the City’s favor on Smith’s\nFourth Amendment claim based on his arrest is therefore denied.\n6. Roman Jackson and Kristin Johnson’s Stop and Arrest\na. Facts \nThe undisputed facts relating to the arrest of Roman Jackson and\nKristin Johnson are as follows.77  On January 31, 2009, Jackson was a tenant at the\nNYCHA building at 131 St. Nicholas Avenue.  Johnson came to visit him and he\nsuggested that they sit in the stairwell.  They took the elevator to the seventeenth\nfloor (the highest floor of the building) and then sat on the platform at the top of\n76 Panetta, 460 F.3d at 395 (quoting Martinez v. Simonetti, 202 F.3d\n625, 634 (2d Cir. 2000) (emphasis added)).\n77 See Pl. City 56.1 ¶¶ 6-38.\n25\n\nthe stairwell that is connected to the roof through a door.78  Approximately twenty\nminutes later, three police officers arrived.  Jackson testified at his deposition that\none of the officers asked Jackson and Johnson what they were doing there; Jackson\npolitely greeted the officers and told them that he was a resident and was having a\nconversation with his friend; the officer told Jackson and Johnson that they were\nnot supposed to be there; the officers ordered them against a wall and frisked them;\nJackson told the officers that they or he could retrieve his identification from his\ngrandmother, who was at home at the time, in order to verify his residence and said\nthat he did not understand how he could be trespassing in his own building; the\nofficers told Jackson and Johnson that they were trespassing and arrested them.79 \nb. Legal Background\nNew York Penal Law section 140.10(e) reads as follows: \nA person is guilty of criminal trespass in the third degree when he\nknowingly enters or remains unlawfully in a building or upon real\nproperty . . . (e) where the building is used as a public housing\nproject in violation of conspicuously posted rules or regulations\ngoverning entry and use thereof. (Emphasis added.)\nThus, it is a crime, even for tenants, to knowingly remain unlawfully\n78 The parties debate whether this location is properly described as a\n“roof landing,” although the City acknowledges that the question is ultimately\nimmaterial.  See City Rep. Mem. at 3 n.12. I refer to the location as the top of the\nstairwell.\n79 See Deposition of Roman Jackson (“Jackson Dep.”) at 108-32.  \n26\n\nin a NYCHA building in violation of conspicuously posted rules.  There is no\ndispute that on the day Jackson and Johnson were arrested, there was a sign posted\nin the lobby of 131 St. Nicholas Avenue stating that “loitering and trespassing in\nlobby, roof, hallway and stairs is not permitted.”80  There is a dispute about\nwhether such a sign was posted in the location where Jackson and Johnson were\nsitting.81  In order to prevail on summary judgment, the City must show that there\nwere conspicuously posted rules that put Jackson on notice that he was prohibited\nfrom sitting at the top of the stairwell for twenty minutes.82 \nAlthough defendants provide evidence that the tops of stairwells are\n80 Pl. Mem. at 23 (citing City Ex. H).\n81 The City has produced a photograph of a sign that Police Officer\nHector Jimenez states is posted on a door at the top of the B stairwell, where\nJackson and Johnson were arrested.  See Declaration of Hector Jimenez in Support\nof Def. Rep. Mem. ¶ 13.  He does not state that he took the photograph, however,\nand three named plaintiffs (Jackson, Johnson, and Jackson’s grandmother Eleanor\nBritt) testified at their depositions that there was no such sign posted in the area\nwhere Jackson and Johnson were sitting, and that the photograph is of a sign in a\ndifferent stairwell.  See Pl. Counter 56.1 ¶ 12.  Because there is a dispute of fact on\nthis issue, I cannot accept defendants’ version as true for the purpose of summary\njudgment.\n82 See People v. James, 902 N.Y.S.2d 293 (Crim. Ct. N.Y. Co. 2010)\n(noting that such signs must be “posted strategically or conspicuously enough to\nafford adequate notice of the prohibited conduct”).\n27\n\ndangerous locations,83 the NYCHA rule as posted cannot reasonably be read to\nmean that residents are prohibited from ever being there.  The signs prohibit\n“trespassing and loitering” in “lobby, roof, hallway and stairs” and if those words\nmeant that merely being present in those locations was prohibited, residents would\nhave no way of getting to or from their apartments.  Defendants’ only plausible\nargument, therefore, is that the signs adequately put residents on notice that they\nmay not “loiter” in those locations.  \nProhibitions on loitering have a long and ugly history in New York\nCity84 and across the United States.85  One of New York State’s prohibitions on\n83 See City Mem. at 4; City 56.1 ¶¶ 19-21 (summarizing testimony of\nPolice Chiefs Edward Delatorre and Joanne Jaffee).\n84 See Casale v. Kelly, 710 F. Supp. 2d 347, 347 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (“The\nCity of New York, operating principally through the [NYPD], has continuously\nenforced three unconstitutional loitering statutes for decades following judicial\ninvalidation of those laws and despite numerous court orders to the contrary . . . .\nThe human toll, of course, has been borne by the tens of thousands of individuals\nwho have, at once, had their constitutional rights violated and been swept into the\npenal system.”).\n85 See Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972)\n(recounting the history of vagrancy statutes, from early English law through the\ntwentieth century, and striking down Jacksonville’s vagrancy ordinance with the\nexplanation that “[o]f course, vagrancy statutes are useful to the police. Of course,\nthey are nets making easy the roundup of so-called undesirables.  But the rule of\nlaw implies equality and justice in its application. Vagrancy laws of the\nJacksonville type teach that the scales of justice are so tipped that even-handed\nadministration of the law is not possible.

Bright, 71 N.Y.2d 376, 379 (1988) (striking down Penal\nLaw § 240.35(7), which provided that “[a] person is guilty of loitering when he . . .\n[loiters] or remains in any transportation facility, or is found sleeping therein, and\nis unable to give a satisfactory explanation of his presence.”).\n87 Id. at 382 (quoting United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617\n(1954)).\n88 Harriss, 347 U.S. at 617.\n29\n\n[t]he absence of objective standards to guide those enforcing the\nlaws permits the police to make arrests based upon their own\npersonal, subjective idea of right and wrong.  A vague statute \n“confers on police a virtually unrestrained power to arrest and\ncharge persons with a violation” (Lewis v. City of New Orleans,\n415 U.S. 130, 135 (1974) [Powell, J., concurring]), and “furnishes\na convenient tool for ‘harsh and discriminatory enforcement by\nlocal prosecuting officials, against particular groups deemed to\nmerit their displeasure’” (Papachristou, 405 U.S. at 170 (quoting\nThornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 97-98 (1940))).89\nThe criminal statute at issue in this case is not vague.  It states that a\nperson present in a NYCHA building is guilty of trespass if he fails to comply with\n“conspicuously posted rules or regulations governing entry and use thereof.”90  But\nif NYCHA rules are to be incorporated into the State’s criminal laws then the\nconstitutional limits governing vagueness must apply to those rules as well.  And\nNew York’s Court of Appeals has made clear that, in general, prohibitions on\n“loitering” are unconstitutionally vague:\nThe term “loiter” or “loitering” has a commonly accepted meaning\nthat has evolved over the years, and connotes the act of remaining\nabout or hanging around a place without any apparent purpose   \n. . . .  However, a statute that merely prohibits loitering, without\nmore, is unconstitutionally vague.  Such a generalized law fails to\ndistinguish between conduct calculated to cause harm and conduct\nthat is essentially innocent, thereby failing to give adequate notice\nof  what  conduct  is  prohibited.  Further,  such  a  statute\nimpermissibly  places  complete  discretion  in  the  hands  of  the\n89 Bright, 71 N.Y.2d at 383.\n90 N.Y. Pen. L. § 140.10(e).\n30\n\npolice to determine whom they will arrest.91 \nThe Court of Appeals has been more forgiving of loitering statutes\nthat prohibit “loitering in a specific place of restricted public access,” such as\nschools or waterfronts, “since these locations were not open to the public, were\nplaces where illegal activity was notorious, and were normally frequented only by\nthose who are affiliated with the activity being carried on there.”92  \nc. Analysis\nProhibiting trespass and loitering on NYCHA property by uninvited\nstrangers is understandably important to many residents: the buildings are their\nhomes.  The Legislature has reasonably determined that, for the safety and well-\nbeing of NYCHA residents, access to the buildings should be restricted to residents\nand their invited guests.\nBut a prohibition on “loitering” by a resident is unconstitutionally\nvague.93  The sign relied upon by the City prohibits loitering “in lobby, roof,\nhallway, and stairs.”  According to that sign, may two neighbors, meeting each\n91 Bright, 71 N.Y.2d at 383-84.\n92 Id. at 384.\n93 I am not aware of any cases that address the arrest of a NYCHA\nresident for trespass in his or her own building pursuant to the building’s\nprohibition on loitering.\n31\n\nother in the hallway outside their apartments, talk for fifteen minutes about the\nAmerican League pennant race?  Or would doing so subject them to lawful arrest? \nIf it is cold outside, may an elderly woman wait in the lobby of her building for ten\nminutes while her son hails a cab?  Or may she too be punished by up to three\nmonths in prison?94  Because the sign prohibits a vast swath of “conduct that is\ninherently innocent,” it fails to give NYCHA residents notice of what precise\nconduct is prohibited and it “places complete discretion in the hands of the police\nto determine whom they will arrest.”95\n94 Trespass in the third degree is a Class B misdemeanor, N.Y. Pen. L. §\n140.10, which is punishable by a definite sentence not to exceed three months, id. §\n70.15(2).  Roman Jackson and Kristin Johnson chose to sit on the top of the\nstairwell instead of on a bench outside because it was the middle of a cold winter. \nSee Pl. Counter 56.1 ¶ 8.\n95 Bright, 71 N.Y.2d at 383, 384.  It is also worth noting that the sign\nuses confusing language: it prohibits “loitering and trespassing” not “loitering or\ntrespassing” and says that “loitering and trespassing” “is” prohibited, not “are\nprohibited.”  Both of these semantic choices suggest that the rules prohibit the\nsingle unified act of “loitering and trespassing,” not each of the separate acts of\nloitering and of trespassing, and therefore suggest that a resident like Jackson who\nis loitering but not trespassing will not have violated the rule.  See Crooks v.\nHarrelson, 282 U.S. 55, 58 (1930) (“We find nothing in the context or in other\nprovisions of the statute which warrants the conclusion that the word ‘and’ was\nused otherwise than in its ordinary [conjunctive] sense.”); Reese Bros., Inc. v.\nUnited States, 447 F.3d 229, 235-36 (3d Cir. 2006) (“The usual meaning of the\nword ‘and,’ however, is conjunctive, and unless the context dictates otherwise, the\n‘and’ is presumed to be used in its ordinary sense” (quotation and citation\nomitted)).  But no tenant should be expected to perform such a close reading in\norder to determine what behavior is and is not permitted in his own building; it is\ndefendants’ obligation to put tenants on clear notice of what constitutes unlawful\n32\n\nSubsequent to the arrest of Jackson and Johnson, NYCHA issued a\nnew document entitled “Highlights of House Rules, Lease Terms and Policy” that\nexpressly prohibits residents’ presence on roof landings, that is, at the top of\nstairwells.96  The document also says that “the lobby or stairwell is meant for\nresident use to either go in or out of the building or to walk from floor to floor,”\nand says that “lingering” is prohibited in “the lobby, corridors, and stairwell.”97  I\nsympathize with the desire of NYCHA residents (including plaintiff Eleanor Britt,\nJackson’s grandmother) to keep their homes safe.98  But, as written, the\nprohibitions do not clearly distinguish between harmful and innocuous activity –\nindeed, Britt’s act of sitting at the Tenant Patrol table in the lobby of buildings and\nrequesting that all visitors sign a log book could itself fall under the criminal\nprohibition against “loitering” or “lingering” in the lobby because she is not using\nthe lobby “to either go in or out of the building.”  The vagueness of the terms (and\nthe discretionary enforcement that accompanies it) may be acceptable in the\nconduct.\n96 See Highlights of House Rules, Lease Terms and Policy, Ex. 28 to\nBrooker Decl., at 2.\n97 Id.\n98 See Britt Dep. at 42:2-44:2, 59:24-66:2 (describing her efforts through\nthe Tenant’s League to improve the quality of life in her building and her support\nfor a higher police presence).\n33\n\ncontext of residential leases, where landlords and tenants need flexibility and are\nentitled to a measure of discretion.  But it is unconstitutional when incorporated\ninto the criminal statutes.  \nBecause a reasonable jury could find that there was no probable cause\nto arrest Jackson or Johnson, defendants’ motion for summary judgment on their\nFourth Amendment claim is denied.\n7. Rikia Evans’ Stop and Arrest\na. Facts\nAccording to Rikia Evans, the facts of her arrest are as follows: she\nwas standing in the doorway of the lobby of 175 Alexander Avenue at\napproximately 11:45 p.m. on October 16, 2010, looking to see if her friend was\ncoming to the building to pick her up and walk her home as they had arranged.99 \nOfficer Keith Devine, who was there conducting a patrol, exited the building and\nsaid to Evans “either in or out.”  Evans complied with his directive by walking into\nthe building and toward the elevator.100  Before she reached the elevator, Devine\nsaid “hey, come back, you heard me call you three times.”101  Evans then stopped\n99 See Pl. Counter 56.1 ¶¶ 50, 52, 56 (citing to Deposition of Rikia\nEvans (“Evans Dep.”)).\n100 See id. ¶¶ 57-58.\n101 Id. ¶ 61.\n34\n\nand told Devine that he had not called her three times.102  Devine asked whether\nshe lived in the building; she said that she lived on Jackson Avenue; Devine said\nthat she was trespassing; Evans said, “I’m not trespassing, my aunt lives here.”103 \nEvans told Devine that her aunt lived on the twelfth floor; he asked her what\napartment and she did not respond.  In her deposition, she explained the interaction\nas follows: \nQ: What do you mean when you say you didn’t tell him?\nA:  I didn’t answer.\nQ: Did you know the apartment number?\nA: Yes.\nQ: But you decided not to tell him?\nA: Yes.\nQ: Why did you make that decision?\nA:  Because I didn’t want no trouble.\nQ: You didn’t want any trouble?\nA: Yes.\nQ: You thought that by not telling him your aunt’s apartment\nnumber, then you would avoid having any trouble?\nA: Yes.\nQ: Why did you believe that?\nA: I just thought if I didn’t say anything that he would leave me\nalone.104\nAt that point, according to Evans, Devine started screaming at her that\nshe was trespassing and asked for her aunt’s apartment number two or three times;\n102 See Evans Dep. at 126:13-128:7.\n103 Id. at 126:25-130:1.\n104 Id. at 130:7-23.\n35\n\nshe refused to provide it.  He asked for identification and although she had it with\nher, she refused to provide it because “[she] didn’t think he needed to see it.”105 \nShe then tried to walk away, but Devine’s supervisor, Lieutenant Christopher\nAllen, grabbed her by the jacket, pushed her against a wall, and asked Devine if\nthey should “take her in.”106  Evans then told the officers that she “could call [her]\naunt to come down” but the officers told her “No, to hang up the phone.”107  She\nthen started crying and the officers told her she was under arrest.108\nb. Legal Background\nEvans’ arrest squarely presents an important and discrete Fourth\nAmendment question: whether the police are permitted to rely on a visitor’s refusal\nto answer questions about her destination in order to establish probable cause for a\ntrespass arrest.  New York State courts appear to have reached conflicting answers\nabout whether probable cause exists to arrest a person who acknowledges that he is\nnot a tenant but does not identify whom he is visiting.109  \n105 Id. at 132:10.\n106 Id. at 142:11-17.\n107 Id. at 142:23-143:2.\n108 See id. at 143:3-11.\n109 In these cases, the courts generally have examined whether the\nprosecutor’s charging instrument provides  “reasonable cause” to believe that the\ndefendant committed a crime. As the Second Circuit has explained, “‘[r]easonable\n36\n\ncause’ under the Criminal Procedure Law is substantially the same as ‘probable\ncause’ within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.” Williams v. Ward, 845 F.2d\n374, 387 (2d Cir. 1988).  Accord Stinson v. City of New York, No. 10 Civ. 4228,\n2012 WL 1450553, at *16 (S.D.N.Y.

Hendricks, 841 N.Y.S.2d 94, 96 (1st Dep’t 2007) (“Once\nthe officer determined defendant was not a resident, he was justified in asking if\ndefendant was visiting someone in the building and who that someone was.

Co. 2007) (charging instrument was facially sufficient when it alleged that\ndefendant was found in lobby and “was unable to name any tenant by whom he\nhad been invited into the premises.” (emphasis added)).  Cf. People v. Sanders, 568\nN.Y.S.2d 77 (1st Dep’t 1991) (upon inquiry by police officer, defendants’ response\nthat they were “just passing through” the lobby of a building did not give rise to\n37\n\nJudge Robert Mandelbaum of the New York Criminal Court has\nconcluded that the relevant distinction is between individuals who are unable to\nidentify the tenant whom they are visiting and those who remain silent or refuse to\nprovide the information.  If a woman is unable to identify the tenant or location\nthat she is visiting, Judge Mandelbaum reasoned, then the police have probable\ncause to believe that she is trespassing.  In contrast, “a failure to cooperate by\nidentifying oneself or answering questions cannot ‘be the predicate for an arrest\nabsent other circumstances constituting probable cause.’”110  Thus, “evidence that a\ndefendant, when approached by police in the lobby of an apartment building,\nadvised the officer that he did not live in the building and was just ‘hanging out,’ is\nlegally insufficient to establish criminal trespass” because “although the accused\n‘did not offer an explanation for his presence, it was not his obligation to do\nso.’”111 \nLast year, Judge Kevin McGrath of Brooklyn Criminal Court\nprobable cause for trespass arrest).\n110 People v. Easton, 841 N.Y.S.2d 827, at *4 (Crim. Ct. N.Y. Co. 2007)\n(quoting People v. Howard, 50 N.Y.2d 583, 586 (1980)).\n111 Id. (quoting Matter of Daniel B., 768 N.Y.S.2d at 231). \n38\n\naddressed the same question in People v. Messina.112  Messina was standing in the\nlobby of a NYCHA building when a police officer approached him and asked\nwhether he was a tenant; he responded that he was visiting a friend but did not\nprovide an apartment number.113  Judge McGrath began by explaining that\nit is beyond dispute that the defendant has a right not to answer\nquestions posed to him by law enforcement personnel (see U.S.\nConst. Amend. V) and that the invocation of that right may not\ngive rise to criminal consequences (see Brown v. Mississippi, 297\nU.S. 278, 286 (1936)). It is equally clear to this court that no\nessential element of a prima facie case can be established, at the\npleading stage, by an allegation that the defendant declined to\nrespond to a police inquiry.114\nHowever, Judge McGrath cited a recent New York Court of Appeals\ncase to support his holding that because the police knew Messina was not a tenant\nin the building, it was his burden to establish that he was there by invitation.  In\nPeople v. Davis, the Court of Appeals considered a trespassing rule that prohibits\npresence in a New York City park after its closing time, unless “‘upon order by a\nPolice Officer or designated [Parks] Department employee.’”115  Davis sought to\n112 919 N.Y.S.2d 814, 820 (Crim. Ct. Kings Co. 2011).\n113 It is unclear whether the defendant was unable to or chose not to\nprovide an apartment number.\n114 Messina, 919 N.Y.S.2d at 818.\n115 13 N.Y.3d 17 (2009) (quoting 56 R.C.N.Y. 1-03[c][2]).\n39\n\ndismiss the charge on the grounds that the state could not establish that he did not\nhave the permission of a police officer or parks department employee to be in the\npark.  The question, according to the Court of Appeals, was whether the law’s\nreference to the “order by a Police Officer” was “a true ‘exception’ that must be\npleaded by the People or whether it operates as a ‘proviso’ that defendant was\nrequired to raise as a bar to prosecution.”116  According to the Court, the answer\ndepends on the legislative intent, and it concluded that\nthe City’s Parks Department [which promulgated the rule] did not\nintend that the People plead and prove that no police officer or\nParks Department employee had authorized defendant to ignore \na posted closing time.  Such information is uniquely within a\ndefendant’s knowledge, and to require the People to plead and\nnegate the existence of the relevant permission would require\nthem  to  go  to  “intolerable  lengths,”  including  innumerable\ninterviews of officers and employees in the area during the date in\nquestion.117 \nIn Messina, Judge McGrath concluded that when charging trespass in\na NYCHA building under section 140.10(e), the prosecution has the burden of\nestablishing (or, in the case of an information, alleging) that an individual is not a\ntenant in the building.  However, relying on Davis, he held that a non-tenant has\nthe burden of establishing that he is an invited guest:\n116 Id. at 31.\n117 Id. at 31-32 (quotation omitted).\n40\n\nIn order for the People to adequately allege facts that would\nestablish that the defendant was not an invited guest inside the\nbuilding, the police officer who observed the defendant would be\nforced to question each and every resident of that building in order\nto determine that the defendant had, in fact, not been invited into\nthe building . . . . [M]uch like the knowledge that the defendant in\nDavis was authorized to ignore the posted park rules, information\nconcerning whether the instant defendant was an invited guest of\none of the building’s tenants was peculiarly within the defendant’s\nknowledge.118\nMuch of Judge McGrath’s reasoning is persuasive.  He did not,\nhowever, consider the two cases that I believe are most relevant to the analysis. \nFirst, in People v. Brown, the New York Court of Appeals considered Brown’s\nchallenge of his conviction for criminal trespass.  The court overturned the\nconviction because the prosecution had failed in its “burden of proving each and\nevery element of [trespass] . . . specifically, the absence or loss of a statutory\nprivilege or license to enter and remain.”119  This determination applied specifically\n118 Messina, 919 N.Y.S.2d at 820 (“[T]he existence of such an invitation\ncan be raised as a defense at trial and must be proven by the defendant.  To the\nextent that Daniel B. and James C. have held to the contrary, this court believes\nthat the Court of Appeals’s holding in Davis overruled those holdings.”).   See also\nPeople v. Richardson, No. 2011 NY 2298, 2012 WL 1939971 (Crim. Ct. N.Y. Co.\nApr. 23, 2011) (following Messina where defendant’s identification card listed a\ndifferent residence and he was unable to identify an apartment to which he was\ninvited).\n119 People v. Brown, 25 N.Y.2d 374, 377 (1969) (Fuld, C.J.).  The statute\ndefined criminal trespass as follows: “A person is guilty of criminal trespass in the\nsecond degree when he knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in a building or\nupon real property which is fenced or otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to\n41\n\nto the trespassing statute, which for these purposes has not changed since 1969.120 \nIn its Davis decision addressing presence in the park, the Court of Appeals did not\nmention Brown and I have no reason to believe that Brown is no longer good law. \nThe Court of Appeals’ interpretation of state law settles the question: it is the\nstate’s burden to prove that an invitee does not have privilege or license to remain\non the premises.  Because it is an element of the crime, officers must have probable\ncause to believe that a person does not have permission to be where she is before\nthey arrest her for trespass: “Probable cause must extend to every element of the\ncrime for which a person is arrested.”121  And, of course, the state cannot rely on a\nperson’s exercise of her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent in order to satisfy\nthat burden.122\nexclude intruders.” N.Y. Pen. L. § 140.10.  Further, “Section 140.00 (subd. 5)\ndefines the phrase ‘enter or remain unlawfully’ as follows: ‘A person ‘enters or\nremains unlawfully’ in or upon premises when he is not licensed or privileged to\ndo so.’” Brown, 25 N.Y.2d at 377.  That definition remains the same as it did in\n1969.\n120 The addition of subdivision (e), which criminalizes the failure to\ncomply with NYCHA rules and regulations, does not affect the question of\nwhether the prosecution bears the burden of proving that a person has “enter[ed] or\nremain[ed] unlawfully” in the building.\n121 Alhovsky v. Paul, 406 Fed. App’x 535, 536 (2d Cir. 2011). \n122 See People v. Howard, 50 N.Y.2d 583, 590-92 (1980) (“[W]hile the\npolice had the right to make the [Terry] inquiry, defendant had a constitutional\nright not to respond . . . . Nor can the failure to stop or co-operate by identifying\n42\n\nThe United States Supreme Court’s recent dicta in Hiibel v. Sixth\nJudicial District Court supports this conclusion.123  In that case, the Supreme Court\nconsidered the constitutionality of a Nevada statute that criminalized the refusal to\nidentify oneself when stopped by the police.124  Hiibel challenged his conviction,\narguing that the Fifth Amendment protected his right not to answer any questions\nby police officers, including their demand that he identify himself.  The Supreme\nCourt rejected Hiibel’s argument because it found that a disclosure of one’s name\nwould not tend to incriminate him:\nWhile we recognize petitioner’s strong belief that he should not\nhave  to  disclose  his  identity,  the  Fifth  Amendment  does  not\noverride the Nevada Legislature’s judgment to the contrary absent\na reasonable belief that the disclosure would tend to incriminate\nhim.125\nThe Court’s determination turned on the limited nature of the statute: \noneself or answering questions be the predicate for an arrest absent other\ncircumstances constituting probable cause.”).  Accord Bright, 71 N.Y.2d at 385\n(“Requiring a person suspected of violating the loitering statute [to] provide a\n‘satisfactory explanation’ to avoid arrest is also violative of a citizen’s right not to\nanswer questions posed by law enforcement officers.”).\n123 542 U.S. 177 (2004).\n124 Although New York permits police officers to “demand of [any\nperson stopped on reasonable suspicion] his name, address and an explanation of\nhis conduct,” unlike Nevada it does not criminalize the refusal to provide that\ninformation.  See Howard, 50 N.Y.2d at 590-92.\n125 Hiibel, 542 U.S. at 190-91 (emphasis added).\n43\n\nThe narrow scope of the disclosure requirement is also important.\nOne’s identity is, by definition, unique; yet it is, in another sense,\na universal characteristic. Answering a request to disclose a name\nis likely to be so insignificant in the scheme of things as to be\nincriminating only in unusual circumstances.126\nc. Analysis\nThe present circumstances are different from those in Hiibel. \nDefendants argue that Evans could be arrested because she refused to identify her\naunt’s apartment number.  According to their argument (and Judge McGrath’s\nconclusion in Messina), a person has the obligation not only to disclose her name\nbut also to disclose the name and apartment number of her host.  This information,\nhowever, is often incriminating.  Numerous cases, including the arrests of Osorio\nand Smith in this case, involve situations in which a person who was stopped by\npolice officers is arrested because they do not believe that his or her answer to the\nquestion “where are you going?” was credible.  Although police may obviously\nconsider a person’s lies when assessing probable cause, the Supreme Court’s\nlimiting language in Hiible strongly suggests that the Fifth Amendment prohibits\npolice from arresting an individual for refusing to provide “testimonial” evidence.\nThe New York Court of Appeals’ holding in Brown and the Supreme\nCourt’s dicta in Hiibel support the conclusion that New York City police officers\n126 Id. at 191.\n44\n\nmay not arrest a person for trespass in a NYCHA building solely on the basis of\nher refusal to identify the resident who has given her permission to be in the\nbuilding, even if they know that she herself is not a resident.127  With the preceding\nlegal analysis in mind, I turn to its application in this case.\ni.  Evans’ Terry Stop\nEvans alleges that she was both stopped (that is, “seized”) and\narrested unlawfully.  Evans was seized, for the purpose of the Fourth Amendment,\nwhen  she attempted to walk to the elevator, was told to “come back” by Officer\nDevine, and stopped walking.  The Second Circuit has held that “[a] seizure occurs\nwhen [] a person obeys a police officer’s order to stop.”128  Devine’s order to\n“come back” was an order to stop and Evans obeyed the order.  \nRather than argue that Devine had reasonable suspicion to stop Evans\nat that time, the City describes Devine’s words as merely a “request” that Evans\n127 I fully understand Judge McGrath’s concern that this determination\nmakes enforcement of the trespass statute more difficult.  But respect for the\nindividual liberties protected by our Constitution often makes criminal law\nenforcement more difficult.  Police officers and judges alike are required to ensure\ncompliance with criminal and constitutional law.  There are surely a number of\nways in which the legislature and/or NYCHA might amend the law and regulations\nso as to facilitate constitutional enforcement of the trespass statute.\n128 United States v. Simmons, 560 F.3d 98, 105 (2d Cir. 2009).\n45\n\ncome back and argue that it did not constitute a seizure.129  The City cites to two\nstate court decisions holding that police may instruct a person to “stop” without\nhaving seized them under the Fourth Amendment and Terry.130  These cases do\nsupport defendants’ position but they are squarely contradicted by the Second\nCircuit’s decision in United States v. Simmons.  It is the Second Circuit, not the\nAppellate Division or the New York Court of Appeals, whose interpretations of the\nFourth Amendment are binding on this Court.  When told by a police officer to\n“come back” in the lobby of a building, a reasonable person would believe that he\nwas not free to leave.  According to the facts as she describes them, Evans was\nseized when she complied with the order.131\nIf a juror were to believe Evans’ version of events, she could\nreasonably conclude that at the time of the seizure Devine did not have reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that Evans was committing a crime.  The only information\n129 City Rep. Mem. at 4.\n130 See People v. Reyes, 199 A.D.2d 153 (1st Dep’t 1993), aff’d, 83\nN.Y.2d 945 (1994); People v. Mitchell, 637 N.Y.S.2d 450 (2d Dep’t 1996).\n131  See United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980) (“We\nconclude that a person has been ‘seized’ within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a\nreasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.”).\n46\n\navailable to Devine was that, late at night in an allegedly high-crime area,132 Evans\nhad been waiting in the doorway of the lobby for approximately three minutes and\nwent inside the building after Devine told her “either in or out.”  There is nothing\nsuspicious about waiting in a lobby for three minutes (even in a high-crime area at\nnight)133 and there is nothing suspicious about complying with an officer’s\ninstruction to go “either in or out.”  Because these facts, if true, may establish that\nEvans was stopped unlawfully, summary judgment on Evans’ claim for an\nunlawful stop is denied.\nii. Evans’ Arrest\nAccording to Evans’ testimony, at the time that Devine told her that\nshe was under arrest, he knew the following facts: (1) Evans said she did not live in\nthe building, (2) Evans said her aunt lived on the twelfth floor, (3) Evans\nrepeatedly refused to tell him what apartment number her aunt lived in, and (4)\nEvans offered to call her aunt to come down to the lobby.  For the reasons just\ndiscussed, if a jury were to believe this version of events, it could reasonably\n132 See City Rep. Mem. at 4 (citing to Declaration of Erik Hernandez,\nNYPD Captain, regarding crime rates near the building where Evans was arrested).\n133 See United States v. Bellamy, 592 F. Supp. 2d 308, 317 (E.D.N.Y.\n2009) (“the fact that an individual appears to be waiting for someone [in the\nvestibule of a building] does not establish reasonable suspicion that an individual is\nengaged in criminal activity” even if the building is in a high-crime, drug-prone\narea and the person makes “furtive gestures”).\n47\n\nconclude that these facts did not establish probable cause to arrest Evans for\ntrespass.  \nThere is no probable cause to arrest a person if the only facts known\nto the police are that the person says she does not live in the building and refuses to\nsay more about her license or privilege to be there.  Even if the burden is on the\nvisitor to identify the resident who has given her permission to be in the building, a\njury crediting Evans’ testimony could reasonably find that there was no probable\ncause to arrest Evans.  She identified her aunt’s floor and offered to call her aunt\ndown to the lobby to verify her authorization to be there.  This offer would have\nmade it easy for the police officers to evaluate her claims, which fully addresses\nthe pragmatic concerns raised by Judge McGrath in Messina.  Instead, the officers\nimproperly chose to “disregard plainly exculpatory evidence” and arrested\nEvans.134  \nAdditionally, in Hiibel the Supreme Court addressed Hiibel’s concern\nthat the Nevada statute “circumvents the probable-cause requirement, in effect\nallowing an officer to arrest a person for being suspicious” by pointing to “the\nrequirement that a Terry stop must be justified at its inception” and that “an officer\nmay not arrest a suspect for failure to identify himself if the request for\n134 Panetta, 460 F.3d at 395.\n48\n\nidentification is not reasonably related to the circumstances justifying the stop.”135 \nThe officers in this case (allegedly) arrested Evans after making an unlawful stop\nso their reliance on her silence is squarely foreclosed by Hiibel.\nEvans’ testimony, if credited by the trier of fact, establishes that she\nwas arrested unlawfully.  Accordingly, defendants’ motion for summary judgment\non this claim is denied.\nB. The Arrested Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection Claims Against the City\nfor Unlawful Terry Stops and False Arrest\nThe City seeks summary judgment on the arrested plaintiffs’ claim \nthat their stops and arrests were based on their race and therefore violated the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1 of the New\nYork Constitution.136  The City argues that “there is no evidence in the record that\n135 542 U.S. at 188 (emphasis added).\n136 See City Mem. at 13-14; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 245-250, 275-280.  Plaintiffs\nargue that even plaintiff Eleanor Britt, who has never been stopped or arrested, is\n“subjected to Defendants’ racially discriminatory trespass enforcement policies on\na daily basis” and thus has standing to bring equal protection claims against the\nCity.  See Pl. Mem. at 39.  But plaintiffs put forward no evidence showing that\nBritt has been subject to discrimination or injured in a concrete way.  See id. at 24-\n25 (discussing only the arrested plaintiffs); Pl. City 56.1 ¶¶ 30-31 (acknowledging\nthe undisputed fact that Britt has eight grandchildren who visit her regularly and\nthat she “testified that her visitors have never mentioned that they do not want to\nvisit her because they are intimidated by the police.”).  She has not proffered any\nevidence that would permit a juror to find that the City has discriminated against\nher. Summary judgment is therefore granted to the City on Britt’s equal protection\nclaims.\n49\n\nthe Arrested Plaintiffs’ stops and/or arrests were motivated by racial animus by the\nindividual officers.”137  The statement is incorrect,138 but even if it were true it\nwould be insufficient to establish the City’s entitlement to summary judgment.  \nThe Fourteenth Amendment prohibits intentional discrimination on\nthe basis of race, not government action that has a disproportionate racial impact.139 \nThus, in order to survive summary judgment, the arrested plaintiffs must proffer\nevidence that would support a jury’s determination that the officers stopped and\narrested them “at least in part because of” their race.140  As the Second Circuit and\nthe Supreme Court have explained:\nBecause discriminatory intent is rarely susceptible to direct proof,\nlitigants may make “a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial\nand direct evidence of intent as may be available.  The impact of\nthe official action – whether it bears more heavily on one race\nthan another – may provide an important starting point.”  Village\nof Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252,\n266 (1977).141\n137 City Mem. at 13.\n138 As the City acknowledges, both Washington and Evans testified that\nthe officers who arrested them referred to them as “nigger.”  See City 56.1 ¶¶ 80,\n219.  Whether that testimony is credible or not – see City Rep. Mem. at 8 n.26 – is\na question for the jury, not for a court at summary judgment. \n139 See Washington v.

The inquiry is practical. What a legislature or any official\nentity is ‘up to’ may be plain from the results its actions achieve, or the results they\navoid.”142 \nPlaintiffs argue correctly that the existence (or absence) of a City-\nwide statistically significant racial disparity in stops and arrests on NYCHA\nproperty would constitute circumstantial evidence regarding the intent of the\narresting officers.  As the late Judge Robert Carter explained in 2006, a plaintiff\ncan establish his equal protection claim if he can “show a causal connection\nbetween the unconstitutional policy and the violation of his rights.”143  If the\nplaintiff can raise an issue of fact regarding “the NYPD’s practice of wrongfully\nstopping and detaining African-Americans,” then evidence that the stop was\ncross motions for summary judgment on the equal protection claims for race-based\nstops).\n142 Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 279 n.24.  “An invidious\ndiscriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts,\nincluding the fact, if it is true, that the [practice] bears more heavily on one race\nthan another.”  Washington v.

The first part, adjudicated here, involves only those questions\npertaining to the plaintiffs’ individual circumstances.  The second part will address\ndefendants’ Monell liability.  Plaintiffs state that they intend to present statistical\nevidence showing “substantial, statistically significant racial differences in terms of\nwho is stopped and/or arrested on NYCHA property.”145  The City will surely\ndispute the probative value of this evidence.  But because such evidence – if\nadmissible – would provide important context to the jury, I cannot rule on the\nCity’s motion for summary judgment regarding plaintiffs’ claims of racial\ndiscrimination without it.  Thus, the City’s motion is denied without prejudice and\nwith leave to renew subject to further briefing with respect to plaintiffs’ Monell\nclaims.\nC. The Arrested Plaintiffs’ Claims Against NYCHA for Violations of\n144 Id.  Accord Floyd v. City of New York, 813 F. Supp. 2d 417, 446\n(S.D.N.Y. 2011) (“Because a reasonable jury could find that [plaintiff’s] stop was\nunconstitutional [under the Fourth Amendment], and that the stop occurred in the\ncontext of citywide racial disparities in stop-and-frisk patterns unexplainable by\nchance, crime patterns, or officer deployment patterns, there is a triable issue of\nfact as to whether [his] stop was racially motivated.”).\n145 Pl. Mem. at 26\n52\n\nEqual Protection\nThe arrested plaintiffs have brought their federal and state\nconstitutional claims for false arrest against only the City, not NYCHA.146  But the\nclaims under the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article\nI, Section 11 of the New York Constitution were brought by “All Plaintiffs against\nAll Defendants.”147  Plaintiffs’ argument on these claims focuses exclusively on the\narrested plaintiffs (that is, every plaintiff but Britt) and does not explain how\nNYCHA could be liable for a false arrest based on racial discrimination if it had no\nliability for the arrest to begin with.148  NYCHA’s motion for summary judgment\non plaintiffs’ second and eighth claims for relief is therefore granted. \nD. Resident Plaintiffs’ Contract-Based Claims Under Title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, the Fair Housing Act,\nand the New York State and New York City Human Rights Laws\nThe resident plaintiffs bring a host of claims alleging that defendants’\ndiscriminatory policing practices have diminished their ability to enjoy the benefits\nof their homes.  Although the claims are brought under an array of contract,\nhousing, and civil/human rights laws, they are founded on the same basic\n146 See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 237-244; 281-286.\n147 Id. ¶¶ 245, 275.\n148 See Pl. Mem. at 24-27.\n53\n\nallegation, namely that the resident plaintiffs \nhave been denied the enjoyment of the benefits, privileges, terms,\nand conditions of their contractual relationship with NYCHA,\nbecause they are limited in their ability to enter and exit their own\nhomes, and in their ability to receive guests, due to Defendants’\ntrespass enforcement policies and practices, which are conducted\nin a [racially] discriminatory and unlawful manner.149 \nOnly the resident plaintiffs maintain these claims.150  Although their\nbrief displays some confusion about the matter, the only remaining plaintiffs who\nare lawful tenants of NYCHA apartments are Britt, Littlejohn, and Evans.151  All of\n149 Am. Compl. ¶ 267 (specifically addressing plaintiffs’ claim under 42\nU.S.C. § 1981 for deprivation of the right to enjoy the benefits of contracts free\nfrom racial discrimination).\n150 Although the Title VI claim was initially brought on behalf of all\nplaintiffs, it has only been pursued on behalf of the resident plaintiffs.  See Pl.\nMem. at 28 n.33.\n151 According to plaintiffs, the “Resident Plaintiffs are Eleanor Britt,\nPatrick Littlejohn, Andrew Washington, Shawne Jones, Hector Suarez, and\nVaughn Frederick.”  Pl. Mem. at 28 n.32.  Jones and Suarez settled their claims\nagainst the City on February 7, 2011.  See Judgment Pursuant to Rule 68 [Docket\nNo. 59].  It is undisputed that Washington and Frederick are not authorized\nNYCHA tenants.  See Pl. City 56.1 ¶¶ 200, 217.  Plaintiffs explicitly concede that\nthis status precludes Washington and Frederick from asserting claims under the\nUnited States Housing Act, Pl. Mem. at 33 n.36, and they fail to make any\nargument regarding the ability of Washington and Frederick to bring other\nresidency-based claims.  Such arguments are therefore waived and defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment on Washington and Frederick’s residency-based\nclaims is granted.  Plaintiffs’ list of “resident plaintiffs” omits Rikia Evans, but the\nCity acknowledges that she is an authorized NYCHA tenant and plaintiffs address\nher residency-based claims. \n54\n\ntheir residency claims appear to depend on the following limited set of facts:\nBoth  Ms.  Evans’s  father  and  uncle  have  been  stopped  while\nvisiting her.  After he was stopped, Ms. Evans’s uncle’s visits\ndeclined from twice weekly to fewer than three times per month. \nSimilarly, Ms. Evans’s father no longer visits Ms. Evans at her\nresidence; instead, he meets her outside her apartment building. \nAfter Ms. Evans was arrested for trespass while visiting a close\nfamily friend, whom she considers an aunt, she stopped her daily\nvisits.  In addition, Ms. Evans has stopped visiting other friends\nwho  live  in  NYCHA  developments  and  no  longer  has  close\nfriends who are NYCHA residents . . . .152\nMr. Washington and Mr. Littlejohn, both residents of NYCHA’s\nEastchester Gardens development, have been close friends since\nchildhood.    While  Mr.  Washington  previously  visited  Mr.\nLittlejohn “all the time,” after he was arrested while visiting Mr.\nLittlejohn, he now visits only “once in a while.”  Because both\nMr. Washington and Mr. Littlejohn live in NYCHA housing,\nDefendants’ practices completely inhibit them from visiting one\nanother  in  the  safe  havens  of  their  homes.    Mr.  Washington\ntestified that his inability to visit a friend “next door” leaves him\nwith “no freedom at all.”153\nPlaintiffs point to no evidence regarding the impairment of Britt’s\nresidency-based rights beyond those under the United States Housing Act that\nguarantee the provision of a reasonable residential lease.  With these facts in mind,\nI turn to the evaluation of each of the plaintiffs’ residency-based claims.    \n1. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n152 Pl. Mem. at 31 (citations to 56.1 statements, Evans’ deposition, and\n7/17/12 Declaration of Rikia Evans (“Evans Decl.”) omitted). \n153 Id. at 32 (citations to Pl. Counter 56.1 omitted).\n55\n\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that “[n]o person in the\nUnited States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded\nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination\nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”154  The\nresident plaintiffs allege that they are “unable to use and enjoy their residences\nbecause Defendants’ vertical patrol and trespass enforcement practices are\nconducted in such a consistently unlawful and discriminatory manner that the\nresidents are not free to come and go as they wish.”155\nThe City argues that Title VI creates a cause of action only for\ndiscrimination by grant recipients, not for discrimination by third parties.156 \n154 42 U.S.C. § 2000d.\n155 Am. Compl. ¶ 252.  This claim was brought on behalf of all plaintiffs\nbut non-resident plaintiffs now acknowledge that it cannot be brought on their\nbehalf.  See Pl. Mem. at 28 n.33.  Summary judgment for defendants is therefore\ngranted on the Title VI claims of non-resident plaintiffs Jackson, Johnson, Smith,\nOsorio, Washington, and Frederick.\n156 See City Mem. at 15 (citing Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ.\n(“Monroe”), 526 U.S. 629, 640 (1999) (“a recipient of federal funds may be liable\nin damages under Title IX only for its own misconduct”); Fitzgerald v. Barnstable\nSch. Comm., 555 U.S. 246, 258 (2009) (“Congress modeled Title IX after Title VI\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . . . and passed Title IX with the explicit\nunderstanding that it would be interpreted as Title VI was.”)).  The City’s reliance\non Monroe is misplaced: in that case, the Supreme Court held that a school could\nnot be directly liable for one student’s sexual harassment of another student.  But\nthe offending student in Monroe was not acting as the school’s agent.  Here, the\n56\n\nBecause NYCHA is the grant recipient and the City merely provides policing\nservices to NYCHA, the City argues that it cannot be held liable under Title VI. \nThe statutory language at issue is convoluted.  Stripped of its subsections and\nsemicolons, the statue says that the non-discrimination provisions apply to “all of\nthe operations of [] a department . . . of a local government . . . any part of which is\nextended Federal financial assistance.”157  Both parties cite to Alfano v. Bridgeport\nAirport Services, in which Judge Janet Arterton of Connecticut District Court\nanalyzed the claims of a disabled worker under a federal law prohibiting\ndiscrimination “under any program or activity receiving Federal financial\nassistance.”158  After a thorough review of the caselaw, Judge Arterton explained\nthat \n[w]hile an indirect recipient of federal aid is covered by [the anti-\nCity receives funding from NYCHA to help NYCHA fulfill its statutory duties and\nit is therefore NYCHA’s agent.   \n157 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-4a.\n158 373 F. Supp. 2d 1, 3 (D. Conn. 2005) (quoting section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)).  Judge Arterton was interpreting the\nRehabilitation Act, not Title VI.  According to the Supreme Court, the same\nstandard governs analysis of these laws’ nondiscrimination provisions: “Under the\nprogram-specific statutes, Title VI, Title IX, and § 504, Congress enters into an\narrangement in the nature of a contract with the recipients of the funds: the\nrecipient’s acceptance of the funds triggers coverage under the nondiscrimination\nprovision.”  United States Dep’t of Transp. v.

Whether financial payment may\nbe  deemed  a  government  subsidy  or  mere  compensation  for\nservices, however, is a complex question that depends on the\nparticular facts and circumstances of the contract and project at\nissue.159\nBecause this round of briefing dealt only with plaintiffs’ individual circumstances,\nthe parties have not submitted evidence regarding the nature of NYCHA’s contract\nwith the NYPD.  I cannot at this point determine whether the City is “extended\nFederal financial assistance” pursuant to that contract and cannot determine\nwhether it is amenable to suit under Title VI, let alone whether there is a material\ndispute of fact regarding its compliance with the nondiscrimination mandates of\nTitle VI.  Thus, defendants’ motion for summary judgment on this claim is denied\nwithout prejudice and with leave to renew at the second round of summary\njudgment briefing on plaintiffs’ Monell claims.\n2. 42 U.S.C. § 1981\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866, now codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1981,\nprotects the rights of all persons “to make and enforce contracts” free from\ndiscrimination on the basis of race.  After the Supreme Court reaffirmed a narrow\n159 Alfano, 373 F. Supp. 2d at 6.\n58\n\nconstruction of that provision in 1989,160 Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of\n1991, which, among other changes, added section 1981(b):\nFor  purposes  of  this  section,  the  term  “make  and  enforce\ncontracts” includes the making, performance, modification, and\ntermination  of  contracts,  and  the  enjoyment  of  all  benefits,\nprivileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\n(Emphasis added).\nSection 1981 “offers relief when racial discrimination . . . impairs an\nexisting contractual relationship, so long as the plaintiff has or would have rights\nunder the existing or proposed contractual relationship.”161  Evans, Littlejohn, and\nBritt are authorized residents on a lease (that is, a contract) with NYCHA.  There is\nno doubt that the three resident plaintiffs have rights under the existing contractual\nrelationship.  The question is whether that relationship has been impaired because\nof racial discrimination.\nThe City and NYCHA argue that Evans, Littlejohn, and Britt cannot\nmake out a claim under section 1981:  Any evidence that they are merely limited in\ntheir ability to enter and exit their homes and to receive guests is insufficient\nbecause “there is no record evidence to establish that any of the Resident Plaintiffs\n160 See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 171 (1989)\n(section 1981 “does not apply to conduct which occurs after the formation of a\ncontract and which does not interfere with the right to enforce established contract\nobligations”).\n161 Domino’s Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald, 546 U.S. 470, 476 (2006).\n59\n\nhave actually lost the ability to enter and exit their own homes and/or receive any\nguests.”162  As defendants point out correctly, the plaintiffs “continue to enter and\nexit their homes” and “continue to receive guests.”163\nAccording to plaintiffs, “[d]efendants’ suggestion that Resident\nPlaintiffs’ § 1981 claims must be dismissed because the Resident Plaintiffs do not\nlive in complete seclusion is contrary to law.”164  Plaintiffs point out that Congress\nintended the 1991 amendments “to bar all race discrimination in contractual\nrelations,”165 not merely discrimination that impairs contracts completely.  For\nexample, the law reaches discriminatory disparities in salaries, not only a\ndiscriminatory failure to pay any salary whatsoever.166  The City’s support for its\nposition that section 1981 prohibits only complete evisceration of a contract, and\nnot merely partial impairment of the terms or conditions of a contract, is\nparticularly weak: it cites to an unpublished Third Circuit decision that rejected a\n162 City Mem. at 16; NYCHA Mem. at 20-21.\n163 Id. at 17.\n164 Pl. Mem. at 28.\n165 Hawkins v. 1115 Legal Serv. Care, 163 F.3d 684, 693 (2d Cir. 1998)\n(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 102-40, at 92 (1991)) (emphasis added).\n166 See Kim v. Dial Serv. Int’l, No. 97 Civ. 9142, 1998 WL 514297 (2d\nCir. June 11, 1998) (affirming applicability of section 1981 to claims for\ndiscriminatory pay scales); Longmire v. Wyser-Pratte, No. 05 Civ. 6725, 2007 WL\n2584662 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 6, 2007).\n60\n\nplaintiff’s section 1981 claim because he had not “sought to enter into a contract\nfor goods or services” with the defendants.167  That decision is not relevant to the\nfacts here, where the three resident plaintiffs clearly do have contractual rights.  \nPlaintiffs’ residential leases must entitle them to come and go as they\nwish.  Under federal regulations, NYCHA is required to include in its leases a\nprovision for the “reasonable accommodation of guests.”168  The Second Circuit\nhas held that this right is constitutional, not merely statutory: the Constitution\nprotects public housing residents’ “freedom to have whomever they want[] visit\ntheir homes,” subject only to narrowly tailored intrusions that advance the\ngovernment’s “legitimate interests in maintaining safe, decent housing and in\nkeeping track of occupancy and eligibility in public housing.”169  Both the right to\ncome and go as they please and the right to accommodate guests are material to\n167 Crane v. Cumberland County, 64 Fed. App’x 838, 841 (3d Cir. 2003). \nThe City’s citation to Garrett v. Tandy Corp., 295 F.3d 94 (1st Cir. 2002) is\nsimilarly unavailing: in that case a plaintiff attempted to show the existence of an\nongoing contract arising out of the purchase of electronics because he had the right\nto return the items.  The court held that “a complaint must allege the actual loss of\na contract interest, not simply the theoretical loss of a possible future opportunity\nto modify the contract.”  Id. at 102.  In neither of these cases did the plaintiff\npresent evidence of impairment of an existing contract.\n168 24 C.F.R. § 966.f(d)(1).\n169 McKenna v. Peekskill Housing Authority, 647 F.2d 332, 335 (2d Cir.\n1981).\n61\n\nplaintiffs’ contracts; whether those contracts have been legally impaired is a fact-\nintensive inquiry.\nPlaintiffs Evans and Littlejohn have proffered concrete evidence\nshowing that since their arrests, they feel less free to come and go from their\nbuildings and to have guests visit them.  Evans has testified that police officers\nreferred to her as “nigger” when she was arrested and Littlejohn testified that his\nfriend Washington was also called a “nigger” in Littlejohn’s building while he was\nattempting to visit Littlejohn.170  If she believes plaintiffs’ testimony, a reasonable\njuror could find that the City has impaired Evans’ and Littlejohn’s residential leases\nin violation of section 1981.  Summary judgment on this claim is therefore denied.  \nIn contrast, plaintiffs have offered no evidence regarding the alleged\nimpairment of Britt’s contract.171  Therefore, defendants’ motions for summary\njudgment on Britt’s section 1981 claim is granted.  \n3. Fair Housing Act\nSection 3604(b) of the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) makes it unlawful to\n“discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or\nrental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services of facilities in connection\n170 See Pl. Counter 56.1 ¶¶ 78, 185.\n171 See Pl. Mem. at 28-29, 31-33 (failing even to mention Britt’s contract\nimpairment claim); NYCHA Mem. at 20-21.\n62\n\ntherewith.”172  Plaintiffs rely on this provision to support their allegation against the\nCity for discrimination in the provision of police services.  The City argues that this\nclaim fails because “section 3604 does not, in the absence of proof of constructive or\nactual eviction, reach post-acquisition conduct” – that is, the provision prohibits only\ndiscrimination prior to and at the time of the sale or initial rental of a dwelling, not\nduring the term of lease.173  The Second Circuit has not addressed this question, and\nother circuits have reached differing conclusions.174\n172 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b).\n173 City Mem. at 22.\n174 Compare Cox v. City of Dallas, 430 F.3d 734, 745 (5th Cir. 2005)\n(finding that the law does not prohibit post-acquisition discrimination unless there\nhas been constructive eviction), with Committee Concerning Cmty. Improvement v.\nCity of Modesto (“Modesto”), 583 F.3d 690, 711 (9th Cir. 2009) (holding that the\nlaw does apply to post-acquisition discrimination).  See also Bloch v. Frischholz,\n587 F.3d 771, 779 (7th Cir. 2009) (agreeing with Cox in dicta but holding that the\nlaw prohibits post-acquisition discriminatory practices if they are incorporated into\nthe terms and conditions of the initial sale or lease).  Defendants attempt to tip the\nscales in their favor by citing to Clifton Terrace Assoc. v. United Techs. Corp., 929\nF.2d 714, 719 (D.C. Cir. 1991) and Jersey Heights Neighborhood Ass’n v.\nGlendening, 174 F.3d 180, 192 (4th Cir. 1999), but both of these cases support\nplaintiffs’ position.  In Clifton Terrace, the D.C. Circuit determined that the owner\nof a low-income housing complex could not sue a company that had installed\nelevators in the complex for failure to provide elevator maintenance.  The court\ndetermined that the FHA imposed no obligation on the elevator company to\nprovide non-discriminatory elevator maintenance services.  But it did not base its\nholding on the pre- versus post-acquisition question.  Indeed, in dicta, the court\nvery clearly explained that section 3604(b) does apply to post-acquisition conduct\nby landlords: it explained that the law is “directed at those who provide housing\nand then [that is, post-acquisition] discriminate in the provision of attendant\n63\n\nFor three reasons, I conclude that the law is best understood to\nprohibit post- as well as pre-acquisition discrimination in the provision of housing-\nrelated services.  First, the statute prohibits discrimination “in the terms,\nconditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in provision of services\nor facilities in connection therewith.”  As Judge Louis Pollock (siting by\ndesignation for the Ninth Circuit) explained, \nthe inclusion of the word ‘privileges’ implicates continuing rights,\nsuch as the privilege of quiet enjoyment of the dwelling . . . .\n[Furthermore, t]here are few ‘services or facilities’ provided at the\nmoment  of  sale,  but  there  are  many  ‘services  or  facilities’\nprovided to the dwelling associated with the occupancy of the\ndwelling.175\nservices or facilities, or those who otherwise control the provision of housing\nservices and facilities. In the case of rental units, the provision of such services\nprimarily falls under the control of the provider of housing – the owner or manager\nof the property.”  Id. at 720 (emphasis added).  Clifton Terrace may support the\nargument (which no party has raised) that NYCHA – and not the NYPD – is liable\nunder the FHA, but it does not support the City’s post-acquisition argument.\nIn Jersey Heights, the Fourth Circuit rejected plaintiffs’ claim that\nMaryland’s decision to site a new highway near their homes violated section\n3604(b) because the decision was “too remotely related to the housing interests that\nare protected by the Fair Housing Act.”  174 F.3d at 192.  But, again, the court’s\nexplanation strongly suggested that it would apply the law to post-acquisition\nhousing services: “This provision by its terms extends only to housing and\nhousing-related services. . . . [It] simply requires that such things as garbage\ncollection and other services of the kind usually provided by municipalities not be\ndenied on a discriminatory basis.

It would not\nbe a violation, for example, “to refuse to provide maintenance to [] Hispanic tenants\n. . . [or] to sexually harass a tenant or to raise the rent of only Jewish tenants.”177  Such\na construction makes little sense.\nFinally, this reading comports with the interpretation of the Department\nof Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and with the interpretation of the\nDepartment  of  Justice.    24  C.F.R.  §  100.65,  entitled  “Discrimination  in  terms,\nconditions and privileges and in services and facilities,” says that “(b) Prohibited\nactions under this section include . . . failing or delaying maintenance or repairs [and]\nlimiting the use of privileges, services or facilities associated with a dwelling.”  Both\nof these phrases address post-acquisition activity178 and “the Supreme Court has . . .\nrecognized that HUD’s views about the meaning of the FHA are entitled to ‘great\n176 Cabrera v.

I am therefore denying defendants’ motion at this time without\nprejudice and with leave to renew at the second stage of briefing.\n4. New York State and New York City Human Rights Laws\nPlaintiffs’ eleventh claim is for violations of the New York State \nHuman Rights Law (“NYSHRL”), which prohibits racial discrimination “in the\nterms, conditions or privileges of any publicly-assisted housing accommodations\nor in the furnishing of facilities or services in connection therewith” by any\n179 Id. (citing Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 210\n(1972)).\n180  Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae at 15, Bloch v.\nFrischholz, No. 06-3376 (7th Cir. Jan. 16, 2009).\n181 See, e.g., Cox, 430 F.3d at 746 (the FHA “does not require proof of\nboth discriminatory impact and intent”).\n66\n\n“person having the right of ownership or possession” to those accommodations.182 \nThe City argues that because NYCHA – and not the City – is the owner of the\npublic housing at issue in this lawsuit, the City is not susceptible to suit under the\nNYSHRL.183  Plaintiffs respond by arguing that because the NYPD controls certain\nportions of NYCHA developments – on which it operates its bases – it has the\nrequisite “right of . . . possession” to be sued under the law.184 But, as the City\nproperly notes, the police bases that the City controls do not fit the statute’s\ndefinition of “housing accommodations” because they are not “intended, arranged\nor designed to be used or occupied, as the home, residence or sleeping place of one\nor more human beings.”185  Because plaintiffs have proffered no evidence that the\nCity is in possession of housing accommodations, summary judgment is granted to\nthe City on plaintiffs’ NYSHRL claim.\nPlaintiffs’ twelfth claim is for violations of the New York City Human\nRights law, which, like the FHA, prohibits discrimination “in the terms, conditions\nor privileges of the sale, rental or lease of any such housing accommodation or an\ninterest therein or in the furnishing of facilities or services in connection\n182 N.Y. Exec. L. § 296(2-a).\n183 See City Mem. at 25.\n184 See Pl. Mem. at 30.\n185  N.Y. Exec. L. § 292(10).\n67\n\ntherewith.”186  Plaintiffs acknowledge that this claim cannot be maintained against\nthe City,187 and the City’s motion for summary judgment on this claim is therefore\ngranted.\nNYCHA raises two general objections to plaintiffs’ State and City law\nclaims: First, NYCHA argues that plaintiffs have presented no evidence of racial\ndiscrimination.  As with the summary judgment motions on the other\ndiscrimination claims, NYCHA’s motion is denied without prejudice and with\nleave to renew.  Second, NYCHA argues that the plaintiffs failed to file a notice of\nclaim prior to bringing suit and that their claims are therefore barred.188  But the\nNew York Court of Appeals has determined that notice of claim requirements do\nnot apply to \nactions that are brought to protect an important right, which seek\nrelief  for  a  similarly  situated  class  of  the  public,  and  whose\nresolution would directly affect the rights of that class or group\n186  N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-105(2).\nSee Pl. Mem. at 30 n.34.\n187 \nSee NYCHA Mem. at 24 (quoting N.Y. Pub. Housing L. § 157(1),\n188 \nwhich states: “In every action or special proceeding, for any cause whatsoever,\nprosecuted or maintained against an authority, other than a claim arising out of a\ncondemnation proceeding, the complaint or necessary moving papers shall contain\nan allegation that at least thirty days have elapsed since the demand, claim or\nclaims upon which such action or special proceeding is founded were presented to\nthe authority for adjustment and that it has neglected or refused to make an\nadjustment or payment thereof for thirty days after such presentment.”). \n68\n\n[because these actions] are deserving of special treatment. The\ninterests in their resolution on the merits override the State’s\ninterest in receiving timely notice before commencement of an\naction.189  \nThe cases cited by NYCHA to support its argument that the notice of\nclaim requirement nonetheless applies here were brought by individuals on their\nown behalf.190  This class action, involving matters of grave public concern, is\nentirely different.  NYCHA’s motion for summary judgment based on plaintiffs’\nfailure to file a notice of claim is therefore denied.\nE. United States Housing Act Claim\n \nThe Amended Complaint’s fifth claim, based on the resident\nplaintiffs’ rights under the United States Housing Act (“USHA”) and brought\npursuant to section 1983, is maintained only against NYCHA.191  Plaintiffs allege\nthat NYCHA contravenes the USHA’s prohibition on “unreasonable terms and\nconditions” in its leases by including the following two elements in the document\nMills v. County of Monroe, 59 N.Y.2d 307, 311 (1983).\n189 \nSee, e.g., 423 South Salina St., Inc. v. Syracuse, 68 N.Y.2d 474, 493\n190 \n(1986) (distinguishing between the case at bar (involving a corporation’s lawsuit\nagainst Syracuse regarding back taxes), which required a notice of claim, and\n“class action type proceedings normally involving a private Attorney-General type\nof action,” which do not).\nSee Pl. Mem. at 33 n.36.\n191 \n69\n\nthat accompanies NYCHA’s leases192: First, the document mandates that all\npersons are “expected to cooperate with inquiries from . . . the police regarding\ntheir presence or conduct in any building,” which plaintiffs argue pressures tenants\nto interact with police officers without regard to the Fifth Amendment right to\nremain silent.  Second, it prohibits “lingering” in common areas, as discussed\nearlier in this Opinion.  Because their tenancies are subject to termination for the\nviolation of these provisions, plaintiffs argue, they are unreasonable lease terms.  \nIn addition to their allegation regarding unreasonable lease terms,\nplaintiffs argue that because their leases “do not contain the required provision for\nthe reasonable accommodation of guests,” the leases violate HUD’s implementing\nregulations.193  NYCHA seeks summary judgment on these claims, arguing that\nbecause plaintiffs do not have a private right under 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(l), they may\n192 The parties dispute whether NYCHA’s “Highlights of House Rules,\nLease Terms and Policy,” Ex. 28 to Brooker Decl., is a lease addendum.  The\ndocument says that it “is NOT a lease and NOT a lease addendum.”  Id. at 1.  But\nby its own terms, the document “is intended to remind NYCHA residents of these\nimportant requirements.”  Id.

Mem. at 37.\n70\n\nnot sue under section 1983, and that, even if they do have such a private right, it\nhas not been infringed.194  \nSection 1983 creates a cause of action for “the deprivation of any\nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.”  The\nSupreme Court has \ntraditionally looked at three factors when determining whether a\nparticular statutory provision gives rise to a federal right.  First,\nCongress must have intended that the provision in question benefit\nthe  plaintiff.  Wright  v.  Roanoke  Redevelopment  &  Housing\nAuthority, 479 U.S. 418, 430 (1987).  Second, the plaintiff must\ndemonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not\nso “vague and amorphous” that  its enforcement would strain\njudicial competence.  Id., at 431-432.  Third, the statute must\nunambiguously impose a binding obligation.  In other words, the\nprovision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in\nmandatory rather than precatory terms.195\nMore recently, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the legislative inquiry must\nexamine whether a law has “unambiguously conferred [a] right to support a cause\nof action brought under § 1983.”196  “The ultimate question, in respect to whether\nSee NYCHA Mem. at 15-17; NYCHA Rep.

Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 283 (2002).\n71\n\nprivate individuals may bring a lawsuit to enforce a federal statute, through 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 or otherwise, is a question of congressional intent.”197\nIn Gonzaga University v. Doe, the Supreme Court considered a\nlawsuit brought by a student against his university because it had disclosed\nconfidential information about him (namely, that he had been accused of sexual\nmisconduct) to a prospective employer.  The Court determined that the Family\nEducational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), which provides federal funding\nfor educational institutions contingent upon the institutions’ compliance with\nfederal mandates regarding student privacy, did not confer an individual right to\nthat privacy.198  The Court concluded that \nthe provisions entirely lack the sort of “rights-creating” language\ncritical to showing the requisite congressional intent to create new\nrights.  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 288-89 (2001);\nCannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 690 n.13 (1979). \nUnlike the individually focused terminology of Titles VI and IX\n(“no  person  shall  be  subjected  to  discrimination”),  FERPA’s\nprovisions speak only to the Secretary of Education, directing that\n“no funds shall be made available” to any “educational agency or\n197 Id. at 291 (Breyer, J. concurring).\n198 The statute, in relevant part, read: “No funds shall be made available\nunder any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a\npolicy or practice of permitting the release of education records (or personally\nidentifiable information contained therein . . . ) of students without the written\nconsent of their parents to any individual, agency, or organization.”  20 U.S.C. §\n1232g(b)(1).\n72\n\ninstitution” which has a prohibited “policy or practice.”  20 U.S.C.\n§ 1232g(b)(1).  This focus is two steps removed from the interests\nof individual students and parents and clearly does not confer the\nsort  of  “individual  entitlement”  that  is  enforceable  under  §\n1983.199\nWith the Supreme Court’s guidance in mind, I now examine the\nHousing Act’s relevant provision, section 1437d(l)(2), which reads:\n§ 1437d.  Contract provisions and requirements; loans and annual\ncontributions . . . \n. . . \n(l) Leases; terms and conditions; maintenance; termination. \nEach public housing agency shall utilize leases which –\n. . . \n(2) do not contain unreasonable terms and conditions.\nThis statutory language satisfies the first and third prongs of the\nBlessing test: it benefits a specific group of individuals (NYCHA residents) and it\nis phrased in mandatory rather than precatory terms.  The application of Blessing’s\nsecond prong is less clear.  The statute’s requirement that leases not contain\nunreasonable terms is not so “so ‘vague and amorphous’ that its enforcement\nwould strain judicial competence.”200   But it is not especially concrete either. \nIn its 1987 decision Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment & Housing\nAuthority, the Supreme Court determined that 42 U.S.C. § 1437a, which sets\n199 Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287. \n200 Blessing, 520 U.S. at 341.\n73\n\nceilings on the percentage of a family’s income that it must pay in monthly rent for\na public housing dwelling unit, does create an individual right enforceable under\nsection 1983.201  As the Court later summarized in the Gonzaga decision, “[t]he\nkey to our inquiry [in Wright] was that Congress spoke in terms that ‘could not be\nclearer,’ and conferred entitlements ‘sufficiently specific and definite to qualify as\nenforceable rights.’”202  The language of section 1437a is more focused on\nindividual tenants than is the language of section 1437d(l)(2).  The former\ndelineates which families are included under the law and how much those families\n“shall pay”; the latter, under which plaintiffs sue, specifies certain terms and\nconditions that public housing agencies must include in their leases. \nThe preceding subsection of the law, section 1437d(k), which\nplaintiffs do not invoke, provides detailed administrative grievance protections to\nwhich tenants are entitled when a housing agency seeks to take adverse action\nagainst them.203  Multiple courts have held that subsection 1437d(k)\n201 479 U.S. 418 (1987).  At the time, section 1437a read: “Dwelling\nunits assisted under this chapter shall be rented only to families who are lower\nincome . . . . A family shall pay as rent for a dwelling unit . . . .”\n202 536 U.S. at 280.\n203 “The Secretary shall by regulation require each public housing agency\nreceiving assistance under this Act to establish and implement an administrative\ngrievance procedure under which tenants will--\n   (1) be advised of the specific grounds of any proposed adverse public housing\n74\n\nunambiguously confers enforceable rights.204  Both subsections 1437d(k) and\n1427d(l) were enacted by Congress in 1983 as part of a supplemental\nappropriations bill in a section entitled “Lease and Grievance Procedures.”205\nSubsection 1437d(l)(2) sits somewhere between the provisions at\nsection 1437a (Wright) and section 1437d(k) (Stevenson and other cases), on the\none hand, and the provisions of FERPA, which the Supreme Court addressed in\nGonzaga, on the other.206  Plaintiffs correctly note that in Gonzaga, the Supreme\nagency action;\n   (2) have an opportunity for a hearing before an impartial party upon timely\nrequest within any period applicable under subsection (l) . . . \n   (4) be entitled to be represented by another person of their choice at any\nhearing.” 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(k) (emphasis added).\n204 See Stevenson v.

In contrast, section 1437d(l)(2) states that housing authorities shall\nutilize leases that do not contain unreasonable terms and conditions; it is an\naffirmative command mandating that housing authorities contract with tenants in a\nparticular way, not an indirect command to the federal agency overseeing the\nhousing authorities to withhold funding if the agencies have certain policies. \nIsolated from the section’s other provisions, section 1437d(l)(2) may \nappear to impose duties on housing agencies rather than confer rights upon tenants. \nBut I find that it does establish an individual right to a reasonable lease because it\nrequirements provided in the statute and the regulations.”); and Herring v.

The preceding sentence, in section 1437d(l)(1), requires\nthat leases be automatically renewed and “that nothing in this title shall prevent a\nresident from seeking timely redress in court for failure to renew”; two sentences\nlater, in section 1437d(l)(4), the law requires that housing agencies give notice a\nspecific number of days prior to the termination of leases; and, most importantly,\nsection 1437d(k) ensures procedural protections for tenants who are being evicted\nfor violations of the lease provisions governed by section 1437d(l)(2).208  It would\nmake little sense for Congress to give tenants federal rights to procedural\nprotections before they are evicted but no substantive right not to be evicted on\nunreasonable grounds.  The text of these subsections is most reasonably read as\nproviding tenants of public housing important substantive and procedural rights.\nThis lawsuit alleges that NYCHA has included in its lease addendum\nunreasonable terms and conditions, not that NYCHA has violated the terms or\nconditions of the lease.  Because section 1437d(l)(2) gives the resident plaintiffs a\nright to a lease free from unreasonable terms and conditions, the suit alleges an\ninfringement of a federal right actionable under section 1983.209\n208 “42 U.S.C. § 1437d(k) mandates the creation of procedural rights for\ntenants faced with adverse action.

There is also a dispute of\nfact as to whether the provisions in that document – mandating that tenants\ncooperate with police officers and avoid “lingering” in common areas – are\nunreasonable.  Because the question of these provisions’ reasonableness involves\nan inquiry into NYCHA’s practices and policies rather than into plaintiffs’\nindividual circumstances, the parties have not fully briefed the issue.  Based on my\nevaluation of the arrest of Jackson and Johnson at the top of the stairwell and the\ncorresponding vagueness of the prohibition against “lingering” in common areas, I\nam skeptical that NYCHA will be able to prevail at summary judgment. \nNevertheless, so that both parties have the full opportunity to present their case,\nNYCHA’s motion is denied without prejudice and with leave to renew.\nF.

United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 618 (1984).  Some cases implicate\none of the two concerns and some implicate both.

Williams, in which the Second\nCircuit explained that \n“where  a  particular  Amendment  ‘provides  an  explicit  textual\nsource of constitutional protection’ against a particular sort of\ngovernment behavior, ‘that Amendment, not the more generalized\nnotion  of  ‘substantive  due  process,’  must  be  the  guide  for\nanalyzing these claims.’” Albright v.

(quoting Graham v.\nConnor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 (1989)). “Substantive due process\nanalysis is therefore inappropriate in this case . . . if [the] claim is\n‘covered by’ the Fourth Amendment.” County of Sacramento v.\nLewis, 523 U.S. 833, 843 (1998).220\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees that “the right of the people to be\nsecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches\nand seizures, shall not be violated.”  The force of the Amendment is at its zenith in\nthe context of the home:\n219 See McKenna, 647 F.2d 332 (public housing authority’s policy\nrequiring tenants to register their guests and obtain permission for overnight\nvisitors unlawfully impinged upon tenants’ freedom of association); Patel v.\nSearles, 305 F.3d 130 (2d Cir. 2002) (plaintiff claimed that police concocted false\nevidence about him, leading to the complete ostracization of his family, but he was\nnever arrested). \n220 193 F.3d 581, 599 (2d Cir. 1999).\n81\n\nSince we hold to the “centuries-old principle of respect for the\nprivacy of the home,” Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 610 (1999),\n“it is beyond dispute that the home is entitled to special protection\nas the center of the private lives of our people,” Minnesota v.\nCarter, 525 U.S. 83, 99 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). We\nhave,  after  all,  lived  our  whole  national  history  with  an\nunderstanding of “the ancient adage that a man’s house is his\ncastle [to the point that t]he poorest man may in his cottage bid\ndefiance to all the forces of the Crown,” Miller v. United States,\n357 U.S. 301, 307 (1958) (internal quotation marks omitted).221\nRespect for the privacy of the home is the “central value of the Fourth\nAmendment.”222  Plaintiffs are both residents and non-residents of NYCHA; they\nallege a pattern and practice of violating the Fourth Amendment; they intend to\nseek certification as representatives of a class of similarly situated people.  Because\nthe Fourth Amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional\nprotection against the government behavior that plaintiffs allege has interfered with\ntheir most intimate relationships, their substantive due process allegations are\nduplicative and unnecessary.  Summary judgment is therefore granted to\ndefendants on plaintiffs’ seventh claim for relief.\nG.

Randolph, 547 U.S. 103, 115 (2006).\n222 Id.\n82\n\nrelief because they cannot show that they are threatened with real and immediate –\nnot conjectural or hypothetical – future injury.223  I addressed this issue extensively\nin Floyd v. City of New York and the same analysis applies here.224 \n NYCHA does not suggest that the resident plaintiffs lack standing to\nseek prospective relief regarding their residency-based claims.  However, for the\nreasons articulated in Floyd, plaintiffs also have standing to seek injunctive relief\nregarding unlawful stops and arrests.  Plaintiff Andrew Washington has been\nstopped inside a NYCHA building two times and arrested once.225  This is\nsufficient, as “the presence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy Article\nIII’s case-or-controversy requirement.”226  In addition, I note that defendants’\npolicies are targeted at NYCHA residents and people present on NYCHA property;\nthe fact that plaintiffs are members of that relatively narrow community is relevant\n223 See NYCHA Mem. at 23 (citing to City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461\nU.S. 95 (1983)).\n224 82 Fed. R. Serv. 3d 833, at *37 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).\n225 See Pl. Mem. at 38 n.43.  “The possibility of recurring injury ceases to\nbe speculative when actual repeated incidents are documented.”  Nicacio v.

BY HIS PARENT \nLISA PIGGOTT, DAVID WILSON, AND \n[Class Action] \nGENEVA WILSON, individually and on behalf of a \nclass of all others similarly situated; \nDEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \nPlaintiffs, \n-against-\nTHE CITY OF NEW YORK and NEW YORK \nCITY HOUSING AUTHORITY; \nc^smzv,s \nDefendants. \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT  ,  -\n1.  This is a civil rights action in which Plaintiffs  Kelton Davis, William Tume^Altagracia \nHernandez,  Edwin  Larregui,  Roman  Jackson,  Kristin  Johnson,  Eleanor  Britt,  Anthony \nAnderson,  Lashaun  Smith,  Shawne  Jones,  Hector  Suarez,  Adam  Cooper,  Andrew \nWashington,  P.L.,  by  his  parent  Lisa  Piggott,  David  Wilson,  and  Geneva  Wilson, \n(collectively, \"Named Plaintiffs\"), on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated \nindividuals, seek to remedy the continuing violation of their rights secured by 42 U.S.C. § \n1983; 42 U.S.C.  § 1981; the Fourth  and Fourteenth Amendments to the United  States \nConstitution; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,42 U.S.C. § 2000(d); Title VIII of the \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 2 of 56\nCivil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. (\"Fair Housing Act\"); the United States \nHousing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1437, et seq:, the Constitution and laws of the State of New York; \nand the New York City Human Rights Law. \n2.  The Defendants, the City of New York (\"City\") and the New York City Housing Authority \n(\"NYCHA\")  (collectively,  \"Defendants\"),  operating through  and in conjunction  with the \nNew York City Police Department (\"NYPD\"), have implemented and continue to conduct, \nenforce and sanction an unlawful vertical patrol and trespass arrest policy which has resulted \nin a pattern and practice of illegal stops, seizures, questioning, searches, and false airests of \nresidents of, and authorized visitors to, NYCHA residences. \n3.  A vertical patrol is a top-to-bottom walk-through patrol or \"sweep\" of hallways, stairwells, \nrooftops and landings, elevators, and other common areas of a NYCHA residence.  (NYPD \nPatrol  Guide 212-59  and  212-60).  Under the vertical  patrol  policy  and trespass  arrest \npractices, New York City Police Department officers conduct roving pedestrian checkpoints \nin and around NYCHA residences, wherein they indiscriminately stop and question every \nperson they observe, without objective individualized suspicion of a crime, and unlawfully \narrest individuals for trespass without probable cause. \n4.  In addition to organized and directed vertical patrols in NYCHA residences, some trespass \narrests are the result of less formal sweeps. \n5.  As a result, the number of trespass arrests in NYCHA residences has increased dramatically \nin recent years, without any reasoned justification  or correlative rise in criminal  activity. \nInstead,  people  with  a  legitimate  reason  for  being  on  NYCHA  property  are  being \nunconstitutionally detained and/or arrested on a routine basis. \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 3 of 56\n6.  Defendants  enforce  the trespass laws in NYCHA residences in an unlawful  manner, and \nwithout adequate training and controls, based on the race, ethnicity, and/or national origin of \nNYCHA residents and visitors. \n7.  Defendants implement and apply these policies, practices, and customs in an intentionally \ndiscriminatory and race-based manner by focusing the patrols and trespass arrest practices \nentirely on communities of color, such as NYCHA residences, where historically entrenched \nracial  segregation  ensures  that  African  Americans  and  Latinos  will  bear  the brunt  of \nDefendants' unlawful actions.  Defendants also discriminatorily acquiesce in, ratify, and fail \nto monitor or rectify NYPD officers' widespread unlawful practices because the victims are \noverwhelmingly African Americans and Latinos. \n8.  The rate of trespass  stops, arrests, and  enforcement  in predominantly minority NYCHA \nresidences is, on average, three times higher than surrounding areas with similar rates of \ncrime.  The decision to enforce trespass laws in this disproportionate way is not explained or \njustified by underlying crime levels in NYCHA residences.  Moreover, where predominantly \nminority  NYCHA  residences  are  located  in  predominantly  white  or  gentrifying \nneighborhoods, the disparities in trespass arrest rates increase even further. \n9.  The vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices do not affect  only visitors who are \nstopped, seized, questioned, searched, and/or arrested; they also intimidate, threaten, and \ninterfere with NYCHA residents' enjoyment of their homes on the basis of race, ethnicity, \nand/or national origin.  In addition, Defendants'  vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest \npractices interfere with the rights of NYCHA residents to freely associate with individuals \nwhom they invite to their homes. \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 4 of 56\n10. The mandate of the NYPD is to safeguard community members from  crime by providing \nsecurity and otherwise delivering police services.  Yet NYCHA residents are not provided \nprotection on the same terms as other community members - instead, they and their invited \nguests are subject to police harassment and unfounded stops, seizures, questioning, searches, \nand arrests when merely trying to enter and leave their own homes. A recent report delivered \nto  the  NYPD  Commissioner  by  NYCHA  tenant  leaders  critiqued  NYPD  trespass \nenforcement  and noted  that residents  feel  like they live in \"penal  colonies.\"  Citywide \nCouncil of Presidents of NYCHA, The Public Housing Police and Public Housing Resident \nPerceptions (Nov. 30, 2009) (\"CCOP Statement\").  The tenant leaders decried this type of \n\"dehumanized policing\" which, they allege, has become the norm instead of the exception in \nNYCHA residences. Id. \n11. The  vertical  patrol  policy  and  trespass  arrest  practices,  as  applied,  are  unreasonable \nconditions that deny NYCHA residents their rights to exclusive use and occupancy of their \nleased unit, and their right to entertain guests in their home. \n12. The pattern and practice of police activity in NYCHA buildings is so aggressive and well \nknown that some people are afraid  to visit NYCHA residents.  As such, this policy has \nprevented  many  NYCHA  residents  from  maintaining  and  fostering  close  familial  and \npersonal relationships without unjustified government interference. \n13. The  Named  Plaintiffs  seek  to  represent  a  certified  class  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining \ninjunctive and declaratory relief only.  Specifically, the Named Plaintiffs seek a class-wide \njudgment  declaring that Defendants'  policies, practices, and/or customs described herein \nviolate Plaintiffs' statutory and constitutional rights under federal, state, and local law.  The \nNamed  Plaintiffs  further  request  a  class-wide  injunction  enjoining  Defendants  from \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 5 of 56\ncontinuing such policies, practices, and/or customs.  In addition, the Named Plaintiffs seek \ncompensatory damages for their individual claims, an award of attorneys' fees and costs, and \nsuch other relief as this Court deems equitable and just. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n14. Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1343(a)(4), as \nthis  action  seeks  redress  for  violations  of  Plaintiffs'  rights  under  the  United  States \nConstitution and federal civil rights laws; and by 42 U.S.C. § 3613(a), as Plaintiffs seek relief \nwith respect to discriminatory housing practices in violation of the Fair Housing Act. \n15. Plaintiffs'  claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \nand 2202. \n16. This Court also has supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), over the \nPlaintiffs'  claims under state and local laws because they are so related to the claims within \nthe original jurisdiction of this Court that they form part of the same case or controversy. \n17. Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), because a substantial part of the events that gave rise to the \nclaims alleged in this complaint occurred in the Counties of the Bronx and New York.  In \naddition, Defendants conduct business and maintain their principal place of business in the \nCounties of the Bronx and New York. \nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n18. The Plaintiff Class consists of two subclasses:  the \"Arrested Plaintiffs\" and the \"Resident \nPlaintiffs.\" \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 6 of 56\n19. Arrested Plaintiffs are African-American and Latino NYCHA residents or family members, \nguests or visitors of NYCHA residents, who were or will be unlawfully  stopped, seized, \nquestioned, searched and/or falsely arrested for trespass in or around a NYCHA residence \nwithout any reasonable, articulable suspicion or probable cause that they were engaging in \ncriminal activity and on the bases of their race, ethnicity, and/or national origin.  All of the \nArrested Plaintiffs are still subject to Defendants' unlawful conduct because they continue to \nlawfully reside in, or visit, NYCHA residences. \n20. The Resident Plaintiffs  are African-American  and Latino NYCHA residents who live in \nbuildings subject to the vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices.  They, their family \nmembers, guests, and authorized visitors have been, or will be, unlawfully stopped, seized, \nquestioned, searched and/or arrested for trespass by NYPD officers when visiting Resident \nPlaintiffs  in NYCHA residences and on the bases of their race, ethnicity, and/or national \norigin. \n21. Plaintiff KELTON DAVIS is an African-American resident of 480 St. Nicholas Avenue in \nthe City of New York, Borough of Manhattan. \n22. Plaintiff WILLIAM TURNER is an African-American resident of 77 Locust Hill Avenue in \nthe City of Yonkers, New York. \n23. Plaintiff ALTAGRACIA HERNANDEZ is a Latina resident of the NYCHA Carver Houses \nat 60 East 102nd Street in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan. \n24.

Plaintiff LASHAUN SMITH is an African-American resident of 441 Frizzell Avenue in the \nCity of Norfolk, Virginia. \n30. Plaintiff ANTHONY ANDERSON is an African-American resident of 348 East 110th Street \nin the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan. \n31. Plaintiff HECTOR SUAREZ is a Latino resident of the NYCHA Louis H. Pink Houses at \n1211 Loring Avenue in the City of New York, Borough of Brooklyn. \n32. Plaintiff  ADAM  COOPER  is an  African-American  resident  of NYCHA  Louis H. Pink \nHouses at 1260 Loring Avenue in the City of New York, Borough of Brooklyn. \n33. Plaintiff P.L., by his parent LISA PIGGOTT, is an African-American resident of NYCHA's \nEastchester Gardens at 1236 Burke Avenue in the City of New York, Borough of the Bronx. \n34. Plaintiff  ANDREW  WASHINGTON  is  an  African-American  resident  of  NYCHA's \nEastchester Gardens at 1240 Burke Avenue in the City of New York, Borough of the Bronx. \n35.

Defendant  City is a municipal entity created and authorized under the laws of the State of \nNew York.  It is authorized under the laws of the State of New York to maintain, operate, \nand govern a police department,  the NYPD, which acts  as its agent in the area of law \nenforcement and for which it is ultimately responsible.  The law enforcement activities of \nNYPD and NYCHA are supported in part by federal funds. \n38. Defendant NYCHA is a public housing authority in the City that owns and operates housing \nfor low-income residents in all five boroughs of New York City.  NYCHA is responsible for \nthe design  and implementation  of policing and security policies in NYCHA residences. \nNYCHA's principal offices are located at 250 Broadway, New York, New York 10007. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n39. The Named Plaintiffs  bring this action on behalf of themselves, and all others similarly \nsituated, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n40. The Plaintiff Class includes two subclasses described above at paragraphs 19-21. \n41. The  Named  Plaintiffs  representing  the  Resident  Plaintiffs  are:  KELTON  DAVIS; \nALTAGRACIA  HERNANDEZ;  ROMAN  JACKSON;  ELEANOR  BRITT;  ANDREW \nWASHINGTON;  P.L.  by  his  parent  LISA  PIGGOTT;  SHAWNE  JONES;  HECTOR \nSUAREZ, and GENEVA WILSON. \n42. The  Named  Plaintiffs  representing  the  Arrested  Plaintiffs  are:  WILLIAM  TURNER; \nEDWIN  LARREGUI;  ROMAN  JACKSON;  KRISTIN  JOHNSON;  ANDREW \nWASHINGTON; P.L. by his parent LISA PIGGOTT; LASHAUN  SMITH; ANTHONY \nANDERSON; ADAM COOPER, and DAVID WILSON. \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 9 of 56\n43. This action is properly maintainable as a class action because the requirements of Rules 23(a) \nand 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are met, as explained below. \n44. The class and each subclass are so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \nUpon  information  and  belief,  there  are  presently  over  400,000  residents  in  NYCHA \nresidences, over 95% of whom are nonwhite.  In 2008 alone, there were thousands of arrests \nfor trespass in NYCHA residences and the overwhelming majority of those arrested were \nAfrican American or Latino. \n45. Joinder is also impracticable because, upon information and belief, many potential members \nof the class are not aware that their constitutional, statutory, and common law rights have \nbeen violated and that they have the right to seek redress in court.  Further, future members \nof the class are unknown and therefore cannot practically be joined individually.  There is no \nappropriate avenue for the protection of these potential class members' constitutional and \nstatutory rights other than a class action. \n46. The claims alleged on behalf of the Named Plaintiffs as class representatives raise questions \nof law or fact common to the Plaintiffs, and each subclass, and these questions predominate \nover individual  questions.  These common questions include, but are not limited to: (a) \nwhether NYPD officers  engage in a policy, practice and/or custom of stopping, seizing, \nquestioning, searching, and/or arresting members of the class for trespass in the absence of \nreasonable,  articulable  suspicion  or  probable  cause;  (b)  whether  the  NYPD  has  a \ndiscriminatory  policy,  practice,  and/or  custom  of  unconstitutional  stops,  seizures, \nquestioning,  searches,  and  arrests  in  NYCHA  housing  that  is  motivated  by  the  class \nmembers' race, ethnicity and/or national origin; (c) whether Defendant City has encouraged, \nsanctioned, and failed to rectify unconstitutional stops and false arrests for trespass by NYPD \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 10 of 56\nofficers, and whether such acts and omissions have caused constitutional violations against \nclass members; (d) whether Defendant  City has failed to adequately train, supervise, and \ndiscipline NYPD  officers  in connection with unconstitutional  stops  and false  arrests  for \ntrespass, and whether such acts and omissions have caused constitutional violations against \nclass  members;  (e)  whether  Defendants  City  and  NYCHA  have  discriminated  against \nAfrican-American and Latino residents in the provision of services in connection with their \nrental of a dwelling because of their race; (f) whether Defendants  City and NYCHA have \ndiscriminated  against African-American  and Latino residents of NYCHA by intimidating, \nthreatening, and/or interfering with their enjoyment of a dwelling because of their race; (g) \nwhether  Defendants'  vertical  patrol  policy  and  trespass  arrest  practices  in  NYCHA \nresidences unreasonably interfere with tenants' ability to entertain guests and visitors; and (h) \nwhether  Defendants'  vertical  patrol  policy  and  trespass  arrest  practices  in  NYCHA \nresidences unconstitutionally interfere with familial, business, and other relationships. \n47. The claims of the Named Plaintiffs  are typical of the class and each subclass they seek to \nrepresent, as they all allege violations related to the existence and implementation of the \nNYPD's  vertical  patrol  policy  and  trespass  arrest  practices  in  and  around  NYCHA \nresidences. \n48. The legal theories under which the Plaintiffs  seek declaratory and injunctive relief are the \nsame or similar to those on which all members of the class and each subclass will rely, and \nthe harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered by all members of the \nclass and each subclass. \n49. The Named Plaintiffs  are all African-American or Latino residents of NYCHA housing or \nfrequent  guests of NYCHA residents.  As long as the Defendants  continue their policy, \n10 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 11 of 56\npractice, and/or custom of discriminatorily targeting NYCHA residences for unconstitutional \nstops, seizures, questioning, searches, and arrests, the named Plaintiffs are, and will remain, \nat high risk of being illegally stopped, seized, questioned, searched, or arrested by the NYPD. \n50. The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of other class members. \nPlaintiffs' counsel includes attorneys from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, \nInc., the Legal Aid Society of New York, and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison \nLLP  —  all  of  whom  are  experienced  in  federal  class-action  litigation,  including \nconstitutional  and civil rights litigation, and have the resources necessary to pursue this \nlitigation. \n51. This action is properly maintainable as a class action under Rule 23(b)(1)(A) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure because prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class \nmembers  would  create  a  risk  of  inconsistent  or  varying  adjudications  with  respect  to \nindividual  class members that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the \nparty opposing the class. \n52. This action is properly maintainable as a class action under Rule 23(b)(1)(A) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure because prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class \nmembers would create a risk of adjudications with respect to individual class members that, \nas a practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to \nthe individual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect \ntheir interests. \n53. This action is properly maintainable as a class action under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure because Defendants have acted and/or refused to act on grounds \ngenerally  applicable  to  the  class,  thereby  making  appropriate  final  injunctive  relief  or \n11 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 12 of 56\ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the Named Plaintiffs  and the class as a \nwhole.  The class  members  are  entitled  to  injunctive  relief  to  end  Defendants'  policy, \npractice, and custom of unconstitutional, discriminatory,  and otherwise unlawful  trespass \nenforcement. \n54. This action is also properly maintainable as a class action under Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure because the questions of law and fact common to members of the \nclass predominate over questions affecting  only individual members and a class action is \nsuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient resolution of this controversy. \nFACTS \nI. Facts Regarding the Named Plaintiffs \nA.  Plaintiffs Kelton Davis and William Turner \n55. Kelton Davis is a 42-year-old African-American male who lived in NYCHA public housing \nfor over nine years.  Mr. Davis lived in NYCHA's Drew Hamilton Houses at 2698 Eighth \nAvenue, Apt. 5G, in the Borough of Manhattan. \n56. Mr. Davis is confined to a wheelchair.  Many friends and visitors come to his home due to \nhis limited mobility.  On repeated occasions, Mr. Davis's friends and visitors have been \nunjustifiably  stopped,  seized,  questioned,  searched,  and/or  arrested  for  trespass  while \nlawfully visiting, or attempting to visit, Mr. Davis. \n57. William Turner is a 39-year-old African-American male.  Mr. Turner is a consultant to the \nNew  York  Department  of  Education,  and  has  been  employed  in  this  capacity  since \napproximately 1999. Mr. Turner is a friend of, and authorized visitor to, Kelton Davis. \n58. On January 27, 2008, Mr. Turner visited Mr. Davis at his apartment in the Drew Hamilton \nHouses.  At approximately 11:30 p.m., Mr. Turner left Mr. Davis's apartment.  Shortly after \n12 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 13 of 56\nexiting the elevator in Mr. Davis's building, Mr. Turner was approached and stopped in the \nlobby of the building by four NYPD officers.  At the time, Mr. Davis was merely walking out \nof the building and was not engaged in any activity that might indicate or imply that criminal \nactivity was afoot. \n59. One of the police officers  immediately  asked Mr. Turner to present identification.  Mr. \nTurner complied with this request.  The same officer asked Mr. Turner where he was coming \nfrom.  Mr. Turner explained that he had just left Mr. Davis's apartment and showed the \npolice officers  a CD he had recorded during his visit.  Surrounded by four armed NYPD \nofficers, Mr. Turner did not believe he was free to leave and asked the officer who initially \napproached him whether there was a problem.  The officer told him to \"shut up.\"  The officer \nthen pushed Mr. Turner against a wall and proceeded to search him.  The officer did not find \nanything in the search.  Mr. Turner was arrested and charged with trespass. \n60. None of the NYPD officers  who questioned, detained, and ultimately arrested Mr. Turner \never knocked on Mr. Davis's door to verify that Mr. Turner was, in fact, a visitor of Mr. \nDavis and had just left Mr. Davis's apartment.  Mr. Davis did not become aware of Mr. \nTurner's arrest until the following day when Mr. Turner informed him of the arrest following \nhis release. \n61. Mr. Turner was handcuffed, arrested, taken to the 32nd Precinct and placed in a holding cell \nwith at least five other people from approximately midnight on January 28, 2008 until 5:00 \na.m. the next day, when he was given a desk appearance ticket and released.  Mr. Turner had \nto appear in court approximately four times over a six-month period before the case was \nultimately dismissed. \n13 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 14 of 56\n62. As a direct result of the arrest, Mr. Turner suffered  a loss of income and work opportunity, \nincluding, but not limited to, teaching with the New York City Board of Education.  Because \nof Mr. Turner's arrest, he was placed on the Department of Education's \"ineligible inquiry \nlist\" and was suspended from all work with the Department of Education pending resolution \nof the case.  For almost eight months, between his arrest in January 2008 and the dismissal of \nhis case in August 2008, Mr. Turner lost the wages he would have earned as a consultant to \nthe New York City Department of Education.  Mr. Turner was also prohibited from his \nregular paying work with various youth organizations.  After his case was dismissed, Mr. \nTurner resumed work with the Department of Education but the volume of his work and \nhours decreased significantly and never returned to the level of January 2008.  Mr. Turner \nsuffered pain, suffering, humiliation, emotional distress, and loss of liberty as a result of his \nunlawful arrest and Defendants' actions. \n63. Many of Mr. Davis's visitors have been stopped and detained by NYPD officers in the lobby \nand hallways of his apartment building.  In rare instances, an NYPD officer will knock on \nMr. Davis's door to verify that someone recently left his apartment or was coming to visit \nhim.  On numerous occasions, however, as was the case with Mr. Turner's arrest, NYPD \nofficers did not attempt to verify that Mr. Davis had a visitor or was expecting a visitor.  As a \nresult of the recurrent unlawful  stops and searches in his building, several of Mr. Davis's \nvisitors  have been  arrested  for  trespass,  and numerous  visitors  refused  to return  to his \nbuilding.  His relationship with Mr. Turner, in particular, suffered significantly because Mr. \nTurner was hesitant to return to Mr. Davis's building for fear of being subjected to another \nunlawful stop and/or arrest. \n14 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 15 of 56\n64. On several occasions, Mr. Davis has been stopped and detained in his own lobby at the Drew \nHamilton Houses during a vertical patrol.  During these encounters, Mr. Davis has had to \nprove his identity and his place of residence in order to avoid arrest and enter his own \napartment.  Mr. Davis has suffered pain, suffering, humiliation, and emotional distress as a \nresult of Defendants' actions. \nB.  Plaintiffs Roman Jackson, Kristin Johnson, and Eleanor Britt \n65. Roman  Jackson  is  a 25-year-old  African-American  male  who  lived  in NYCHA  public \nhousing for over 20 years.  At the time of his arrest, Mr. Jackson lived with his grandmother, \nEleanor Britt, in NYCHA's St. Nicholas Houses at 131 St. Nicholas Avenue, in the Borough \nof Manhattan. \n66. Although Mr. Jackson is now employed with the Annenberg Foundation in Los Angeles, \nCalifornia, at the time of his arrest he was employed as a research assistant with the Harlem \nChildren's Zone, a non-profit education organization in New York City. \n67. Kristin Johnson is a 23-year-old African-American female who lived at 1738 Crotona Park in \nthe City of New York, Borough of the Bronx, at the time of her arrest.  Mr. Jackson and Ms. \nJohnson are friends. \n68. Eleanor Britt is a 61-year-old African-American  woman who has lived in NYCHA public \nhousing for over 33 years.  Ms. Britt is the grandmother and former guardian of Roman \nJackson.  She still lives in the building where Mr. Jackson was arrested. \n69. On January 31, 2009, Kristin Johnson, was an invited guest to Mr. Jackson's home.  When \nMr. Jackson and Ms. Johnson were outside the apartment, they were approached and stopped \nby three NYPD officers.  The officers  asked Mr. Jackson what he and Ms. Johnson were \ndoing, and he explained that he was a building resident and that he and Ms. Johnson were \n15 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 16 of 56\nsimply having a conversation.  Neither Mr. Jackson nor Ms. Johnson was engaged in any \nactivity that might indicate that criminal activity was afoot.  The officers demanded that Mr. \nJackson and Ms. Johnson stand up and put their hands up against the wall.  The officers then \npatted them both down and searched Ms. Johnson's bags.  At no time during their interaction \nwith the officers  did Mr. Jackson or Ms. Johnson feel free to leave.  The officers  did not \nrecover any contraband from Mr. Jackson or Ms. Johnson. \n70. One of the officers then asked Mr. Jackson and Ms. Johnson for identification.  Mr. Jackson \nexplained  that  he  did  not  have his  identification  on his  person, but  that  it  was  in his \napartment, which was located in the building.  Mr. Jackson offered to take the officers to his \napartment in order to provide them with the requested identification and demonstrate that he \nwas a building resident.  The officer denied this request.  Ms. Johnson provided the officers \nwith her identification. \n71. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Johnson were handcuffed  and placed under arrest for trespass.  The \nofficers took them outside and placed them into a police van.  Once they were inside of the \nvan, Mr. Jackson again tried to explain to the officers that he was a building resident and that \nhis identification was in his apartment. \n72. Two of the officers exited the van and went to retrieve Mr. Jackson's identification from his \napartment.  When the officers  went to the apartment, Mr. Jackson's grandmother, Eleanor \nBritt, opened the door and explained that Mr. Jackson was her grandson and that he lived in \nher home.  Ms. Britt gave the officers Mr. Jackson's New York State driver's license, which \nplainly stated that Mr. Jackson lived in the building. \n73. Despite the fact that the arresting officers had determined that Mr. Jackson was a building \nresident, Mr. Jackson and Ms. Johnson were transported to the police station for processing. \n16 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 17 of 56\nThey were fingerprinted, photographed, and locked in a holding cell with other people for \nalmost six hours until they were eventually issued desk appearance tickets.  On March 2, \n2009, the New  York  County  District  Attorney's  Office  declined  to prosecute the cases \nagainst Mr. Jackson and Ms. Johnson. \n74. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Johnson suffered pain, suffering, humiliation, emotional distress, and \nloss of liberty emanating from  their unlawful  arrests and Defendants'  actions.  Ms. Britt \nsuffered  pain,  suffering,  humiliation,  and  emotional  distress  as  a result  of  Defendants' \nactions. \nC.  Plaintiffs Edwin Larregui and Altagracia Hernandez \n75. Edwin Larregui is a 39-year-old Latino male who lived at 1265 Girard Avenue in the City of \nNew York, Borough of the Bronx, at the time of his arrest. \n76. Altagracia Hernandez is the grandmother of Edwin Larregui's wife.  She has lived in the \nNYCHA Carver Houses at 60 East 102nd Street for 35 years. \n77. On the evening of November 9, 2008, Mr. Larregui was visiting Altagracia Hernandez at her \nhome.  As he was leaving Ms. Hernandez' building, Mr. Larregui was stopped by three \nundercover NYPD officers  immediately outside of the building lobby.  As Mr. Larregui \nattempted to walk by the officers, he was directed to stop.  One officer grabbed Mr. Larregui \nby the arm and walked him back into the building lobby where he was surrounded by all \nthree officers.  Mr. Larregui was seized and detained by the officers, and did not feel free to \nleave. \n78. Although Mr. Larregui was merely leaving Ms. Hernandez's building and was not engaged \nin any activity that might indicate that criminal activity was afoot, he was asked by one of the \nofficers if he was on the NYCHA premises to buy drugs. Mr. Larregui explained that he was \n17 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 18 of 56\nvisiting Ms. Hernandez, in Apartment 6A. Nonetheless, the officers grabbed him, threw him \nagainst a wall and searched inside his pockets. \n79. After the officers failed to find contraband on Mr. Larregui*s person, Mr. Larregui presented \nhis  identification.  At  the  time  of  this  incident,  Mr.  Larregui  still  carried  out-of-state \nidentification. \n80. Mr. Larregui was detained in the lobby while one officer stated that he was going to check \napartment 6A to determine whether Mr. Larregui was an authorized visitor.  Officers went to \nthe apartment but did not ask to speak to Altagracia Hernandez; nor did they identify Mr. \nEdwin Larregui to the individual who answered the door. \n81. Mr. Larregui was handcuffed  and arrested for trespass.  Mr. Larregui was then taken to a \npolice precinct  and strip searched.  Nothing was recovered pursuant to the search.  Mr. \nLarregui was then taken to a second police precinct where he was strip searched for a second \ntime.  Again, nothing was recovered.  Mr. Larregui was then taken to Central Booking where \nhe was strip searched for a third time and placed in a holding cell. \n82. Mr. Larregui was arrested at approximately 7:00 p.m. on November 9, 2008. He remained in \npolice custody and did not see a judge until the afternoon of November 10, 2008, at which \ntime he was released. \n83. As a result of his arrest, Mr. Larregui was unable to attend work on November  10, 2008 \nbecause he was in police custody. He was suspended from his job for two weeks as a result. \nMr. Larregui suffered humiliation, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of liberty \nemanating from Defendants' actions including, but not limited to, his unlawful  seizure and \narrest, as well as the three consecutive strip searches. \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 19 of 56\n84. Other  family  members  of  Ms.  Hernandez,  including  her  daughter,  have  been  similarly \nstopped,  questioned,  and  detained  by  NYPD  officers  on  NYCHA  premises  without \nindividualized  reasonable  suspicion  that  she  was  engaged  in  criminal  activity.  Ms. \nHernandez suffered  pain and suffering,  humiliation, and emotional distress as a result of \nDefendants' actions. \nD.  Plaintiffs Lashaun Smith and Shawne Jones \n85.  Shawne Jones is a 34-year-old African-American female who has lived in NYCHA public \nhousing all of her life.  Ms. Jones has been a resident of the NYCHA Langston Hughes \nApartments at 301 Sutter Avenue, Apartment 6D for 20 years. \n86. Lashaun Smith is a 31-year-old African-American male who lived in New York City for over \n29 years. Mr. Smith currently resides in Norfolk, Virginia. \n87. Mr. Smith spent the night at Ms. Jones' home on May 10, 2009.  When leaving Ms. Jones' \napartment on the morning of May 11, 2009, Mr. Smith was stopped by a police officer on the \nfirst floor of the building.  Mr. Smith was not engaged in any behavior that might indicate \nthat criminal activity was afoot. \n88. The officer seized and detained Mr. Smith, then escorted him into the lobby of the building, \nwhere two other NYPD officers were waiting. The three officers questioned Mr. Smith about \nwhere he was coming from, and he explained that he had just left the home of his friend, \nShawne Jones, in Apartment 6D. \n89. Shawne  Jones was  still  asleep  and  did  not  go to  the door  when  officers  came to her \napartment.  If the officers had spoken to Ms. Jones, she would have verified that Mr. Smith \nwas an authorized visitor who had just spent the night at her apartment.  The officers arrested \nMr. Smith for trespass. \n19 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 20 of 56\n90. Mr. Smith was arrested at approximately 10:30 a.m. on May 11, 2009. Mr.  Smith  spent \nthe entire night in jail and first saw a judge at approximately 8:00 a.m. on May 12, 2009. \nThe charges were dismissed at arraignment. \n91. Due to his arrest and delayed return to Virginia, Mr. Smith missed work. As a result, Mr. \nSmith had his hours at his job reduced from approximately 35 hours per week to one shift or \nless per week.  Mr. Smith suffered pain and suffering, humiliation, emotional distress, and \nloss of liberty as a result of his unlawful  stop, seizure, and arrest and Defendants' actions. \nMs. Jones suffered  pain and suffering,  humiliation,  and emotional distress as a result of \nDefendants' actions. \nE.  Plaintiff Anthony Anderson \n92. Anthony Anderson lives a few blocks from NYCHA's Thomas Jefferson Houses at 325 East \n112th Street, where his sister-in-law lives with her two children. \n93. Mr. Anderson routinely picks up and drops off his niece and nephew at his sister-in-law's \nhome. \n94. On January 18th, 2009, Mr. Anderson had spent the day with his 10-year-old niece and then \ndropped her off at his sister-in-law's apartment.  As he exited the building, he held the door \nfor three NYPD officers who were entering the building.  Mr. Anderson was not engaged in \nany  activity that  might  indicate  criminal  activity  was  afoot.  Nevertheless,  the  officers \nstopped, seized, and detained Mr. Anderson, made him step back into the building and then \nasked him where he was coming from.  From that point forward, Mr. Anderson did not feel \nfree to leave.  Mr. Anderson explained to the officers that he had just left his sister-in-law's \napartment and identified her apartment number for the officers who were questioning him. \n20 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 21 of 56\n95. A police officer  asked for Mr. Anderson's identification.  As Mr. Anderson pulled out his \nwallet, he asked the officer to look at his identification.  The officer immediately placed Mr. \nAnderson  in handcuffs.  Upon information  and belief, the officers  never  looked  at Mr. \nAnderson's identification. \n96. While Mr. Anderson was detained in the lobby, two police officers went to his sister-in-law's \napartment and asked if she was expecting anybody.  She said she was expecting her son, who \nwas outside at the time, but did not mention Mr. Anderson since he had already departed and \nshe therefore was no longer expecting him. \n97. The officers returned downstairs and Mr. Anderson was placed under arrest for trespass.  Mr. \nAnderson was taken into custody and incarcerated for nearly two weeks. The charges against \nhim were ultimately dismissed. \n98. At the  time of this incident,  Mr.  Anderson  was  employed  as a private  security  guard. \nBecause he missed 12 days of work while he was incarcerated, Mr. Anderson's employment \nwas terminated.  He has been unemployed since his release from jail in January.  In addition \nto the loss of employment, Mr. Anderson suffered pain and suffering, humiliation, emotional \ndistress, and loss of liberty emanating from his unlawful stop, seizure, and arrest. \nF.  Plaintiffs Adam Cooper and Hector Suarez \n99. Hector Suarez is a 55-year-old Latino male who has lived in NYCHA public housing for 14 \nyears.  Mr. Suarez is a resident of the NYCHA Louis H. Pink Houses at 1211 Loring Avenue \nin the City of New York, in the Borough of Brooklyn. \n100.  Adam Cooper is a 32-year-old African-American male who has lived in NYCHA public \nhousing for over three years.  Mr. Cooper currently resides in NYCHA's Louis Pink Houses \nat 1260 Loring Avenue. Mr. Cooper lives with his girlfriend, who is Hector Suarez's niece. \n21 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 22 of 56\n101.  In December of 2008, Mr. Suarez suffered serious back injuries for which he underwent \nregular hospital treatment.  As a result, his mobility was limited and he often depended on \nfamily members and friends to deliver meals to his home. \n102.  On December 14, 2008, upon Mr. Suarez's request, Mr. Cooper delivered a hot meal to \nMr. Suarez's apartment at approximately 6:00 p.m.  As Mr. Cooper was leaving the building \nhe was stopped by three NYPD officers and asked where he was coming from. Mr. Cooper \npossessed no contraband and was simply leaving the building after delivering a meal to his \nfriend, Mr. Suarez.  He was not engaged in any behavior that might indicate criminal activity \nwas afoot.  At no time during his interaction with the officers  did Mr. Cooper feel free to \nleave. \n103.  Mr. Cooper explained that he was coming from visiting his girlfriend's uncle upstairs and \ntold officers  the apartment number.  Mr. Cooper began to leave and the NYPD  officers \nseized and detained him by pulling on his coat.  The officers failed to go upstairs and check \nwith Mr. Suarez.  Instead they arrested Mr. Cooper and charged him with trespass. \n104.  Mr. Cooper was in police custody for three days. The charges were later dismissed.  As a \ndirect result of his arrest, Mr. Cooper missed work, as he was still in police custody.  Mr. \nCooper  suffered  pain  and  suffering,  humiliation,  emotional  distress,  and  loss  of  liberty \nemanating  from  his  unlawful  stop,  seizure,  and  arrest.  Mr.  Suarez  suffered  pain  and \nsuffering, humiliation, and emotional distress as a result of Defendants' actions. \nG.  Plaintiffs Andrew Washington and P.L. by his parent Lisa Piggott \n105. Lisa Piggott is the mother and legal guardian of P.L., a 17-year-old African-American male \nwho has lived in NYCHA housing  for his entire life.  P.L. lives in NYCHA's  Eastchester \nGardens at 1236 Burke Avenue with his mother, Ms. Piggott. \n22 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 23 of 56\n106. Andrew  Naiku  Washington  is  an  18-year-old  African-American  male who has lived  in \nNYCHA public housing for his entire life.  Mr. Washington lives in NYCHA's Eastchester \nGardens at 1240 Burke Avenue with his grandmother, Regina McCray. \n107. P.L. and Andrew Washington are lifelong friends and neighbors.  They are both currently \nenrolled as high school students.  P.L. and Mr. Washington often travel between each other's \nhomes.  Although they have different addresses, P.L. and Mr. Washington actually live in the \nsame physical building with separate entrances across a shared courtyard. \n108. On the afternoon of June 29, 2009, P.L. spent time with Mr. Washington in his apartment. \nWhen Mr. Washington left, he was stopped by two NYPD officers as he was exiting the lobby \nof P.L.'s building.  Mr. Washington was not engaged in any behavior that might indicate \ncriminal activity was afoot.  Without making any inquiry of Mr. Washington, the  officers \nstopped Mr. Washington, pushed him back into the building and immediately placed  one \nhandcuff on his wrist.  Officers seized and detained Mr. Washington who, at that point, did not \nfeel free to leave. \n109. After placing one handcuff on Mr. Washington, the officers began questioning him.  The \nofficers  asked where Mr. Washington  was  coming  from.  He explained that he had been \nvisiting his friend in Apartment 5B.  The officers then escorted Mr. Washington upstairs to \nApartment 5B. \n110. Lisa Piggott, P.L.'s  mother,  answered  the door when the police officers  knocked.  The \nofficers asked Ms. Piggott if she knew Mr. Washington and she identified Mr. Washington as \nan authorized visitor.  Officers continued to question Ms. Piggott, however, and asked her to \nidentify Mr. Washington by name.  Unaware that Mr. Washington had identified himself as \n\"Andrew,\" to the officers,  Ms. Piggott  identified  Mr. Washington  by his commonly used \n23 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 24 of 56\nmiddle name, Naiku.  Noting the discrepency, the officers took Mr. Washington into a nearby \nstairwell where he was frisked and arrested for trespass.  Mr. Washington was never given the \nopportunity to show the officers identification demonstrating that he lived in the section of the \nbuilding located across the courtyard. \n111. Mr. Washington has been stopped and questioned routinely by NYPD officers in Eastchester \nGardens while going to and from his own home and the homes of his friends and neighbors. \nHe still lives in the same building and visits P.L. regularly. \n112. Mr. Washington's  case was ultimately dismissed.  Mr. Washington  was held in custody \novernight.  Mr. Washington suffered pain and suffering, humiliation, emotional distress, and \nloss of liberty emanating from his unlawful stop, seizure, and arrest. \n113. P.L.was also unlawfully arrested for trespass in June 2009 when visiting a nearby friend in a \nNYCHA  residence.  His  case  was  also  dismissed.  P.L.  suffered  pain  and  suffering, \nhumiliation, emotional distress, and loss of liberty emanating from his unlawful stop, seizure, \nand arrest. \nH.  David Wilson and Geneva Wilson \n114. David Wilson is a 53-year-old African-American male who lived at 55 Brooklyn Avenue in \nthe City of New York, Borough of Brooklyn, at the time of his arrest. \n115. Geneva Wilson is the 79-year-old aunt of David Wilson.  She lives at 255 West 114th Street \nin the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan.  She has lived on that block for over 40 years. \n116. In light of his aunt's advanced age, Mr. Wilson regularly visits her to make sure she has \neverything she needs and to help her manage her day-to-day activities. \n24 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 25 of 56\n117.  On the night of November 14, 2009, Mr. Wilson was going to visit his aunt at her home. \nBefore he could  get there, however, Mr. Wilson was stopped by two plainclothes NYPD \nofficers. \n118. The NYPD officers asked Mr. Wilson where he was going, at which point Mr. Wilson told \nthe NYPD officers about his aunt.  The NYPD officers kept asking Mr. Wilson questions and \nwould not let him go.  He also showed the NYPD officers his identification.  Mr. Wilson did \nnot feel free to leave. \n119. One of the NYPD officers  told Mr. Wilson they were going to his aunt's house.  At this \npoint, Mr. Wilson was placed in handcuffs and detained with the other officer. \n120. Geneva Wilson was home at the time and no NYPD officer knocked on her door or rang her \ndoorbell. \n121. The NYPD officer, however, alleged that nobody was home at Geneva Wilson's apartment \nand the NYPD officers proceeded to place Mr. Wilson under arrest. \n122. Mr. Wilson was searched and no contraband was recovered.  His bags were searched and no \ncontraband was recovered. \n123. Mr. Wilson remained in policy custody and did not see a judge until the following day. \n124. On November  19, 2009, the charges against Mr. Wilson were dismissed when his aunt, \nGeneva Wilson,  came to the courthouse to verify  that he was visiting her.  He remained \nincarcerated until the charges were dismissed. \n125. While Mr. Wilson was incarcerated, he missed a job interview.  Mr. Wilson suffered pain \nand suffering, humiliation, emotional distress, and loss of liberty emanating from his unlawful \nseizure and arrest.  Ms. Wilson suffered pain and suffering, humiliation, and emotional diress \nas a result of Defendants' actions. \n25 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 26 of 56\nII.  Vertical Patrols and a Pattern and Practice of Unconstitutional Stops, Seizures, \nand Arrests in NYCHA buildings \n126.  The experiences of the Named Plaintiffs  are the direct result of the NYPD's policy, \npractice,  and  custom  of  operating  roving  pedestrian  checkpoints,  otherwise  known  as \n\"vertical patrols\" or \"vertical sweeps,\" in NYCHA residences. \n127.  The NYPD first implemented vertical patrols in  1991.  The protocol was adopted to \naddress crime, and specifically  drug activity, in NYCHA residences.  It is considered an \n\"important  component  of  the  [NYPD^s  drug  control  strategy.\"  (NYPD  Patrol  Guide \nProcedure 212-59). \n128.  In the course of a vertical patrol, multiple NYPD officers approach anyone they observe \nin the common areas of a building and require them either to present identification proving \ntheir residency in the building or to affirmatively establish a connection to a specific building \nresident.  If an individual stopped and seized pursuant to a vertical patrol fails to identify \nhimself to the satisfaction of the officer, or is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the \nofficer that he or she is going to, or coming from, a visit to a resident or his or her own home, \nhe or she is  arrested  for  trespass.  If the individual  has not  already been  searched  for \ncontraband pursuant to the seizure, they are subjected to a search for contraband pursuant to \ntheir arrest. \n129.  Defendants' policy amounts to a roving pedestrian checkpoint wherein NYPD  officers \nindiscriminately stop, seize, question, and even search individuals in the common areas of \nNYCHA residences in the absence of individualized objective facts. \n130.  In 2005, the NYPD Housing Bureau  alone conducted  approximately  181,000 vertical \npatrols in NYCHA residences, and an average of 142,000 annually over the previous six \n26 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 27 of 56\nyears.  Testimony of Chief Joanne Jaffe, NYPD Housing Bureau, New York City Council \nCommittee on Public Safety and Subcommittee on Public Housing (November 2, 2006) at \n24.  These figures understate the actual number of vertical patrols, however, since NYPD \nofficers outside of the Housing Bureau also patrol NYCHA residences, also conduct vertical \npatrols in NYCHA residences, and also arrest people for trespass in NYCHA residences. \n131.  In  addition  to  directed  or  organized  vertical  sweeps  in  NYCHA  residences, NYPD \nofficers also sweep NYCHA residences for alleged trespassers on an informal basis. \n132.  Trespassing in public housing is a Class B misdemeanor under subsection (e) of NYPL \n§140.10,  which  was  enacted  in  1992,  shortly  after  the  inception, of the vertical  patrol \nprogram. (L. 1992 ch.434). \n133.  The number of trespass arrests in NYCHA residences has surged.  The City has not \nprovided any legitimate and neutral explanation for this rise in the arrest rate. \n134.  Officers  who make trespass arrests are now required by the local District  Attorney's \noffice to complete a special supporting deposition that sets forth the officer's  observations \nand basis for stopping, seizing, and arresting an individual.  See, e.g.. Supporting Deposition \nSD-4 for NYPL  §§  140.15, 140.10 (e) and  140.05, rev'd 04/06/2009 (\"Manhattan  SD\"); \nSupporting Deposition SD-4 for NYPL §§ 140.15 & 140.10(e), rev'd 06/05/2007 (\"Bronx \nSD\"); Supporting Deposition; Criminal Trespass Fact Sheet (\"Brooklyn SD\"). \n135.  In Manhattan and the Bronx, the \"Observations\" section of the supporting deposition \nmerely lists the location where the defendant was observed, the existence of conspicuously \nposted signs, and whether the entry was locked.  Id. at fflf 1-3.  An officer is not required to \nidentify individualized, objective facts supporting suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. \nThese  supporting  depositions  are reflective  of,  and  consistent  with, Defendants'  policy, \n27 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 28 of 56\npractice and custom of indiscriminately stopping, questioning, and seizing every person they \nobserve in NYCHA residences without individualized reasonable suspicion. \n136.  The NYPD Patrol Guide on vertical patrols provides NYPD officers no guidance on who \nis to be stopped,  seized, questioned,  searched or arrested for trespass.  It simply directs \nuniformed  patrol  officers  to  \"take  note  of  unauthorized  persons  remaining  in  lobbies, \nbasements, stair cases and roof landings and take appropriate police action when necessary.\" \n(NYPD Patrol  Guide 212-60).  Yet the vertical patrol provision  contains no criteria  for \ndetermining who is - and who is not - an \"unauthorized person.\" \n137.  The vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices implemented by NYPD  officers \nfails to require that an arresting officer act upon observed behavior that reliably differentiates \na suspected trespasser or \"unauthorized person\" in a NYCHA hallway from a lawful visitor \nin transit, or a building resident enjoying the common area of his own home.  Given the large \nnumber  of  people  legally  permitted  in  a  NYCHA  residence,  a  police  officer  who  is \nunfamiliar with building residents and visitors cannot consistently or reliably  differentiate \nbetween a suspected trespasser and a building resident, visitor, permittee, or licensee based \non this policy. \n138.  Defendants' failure to provide adequate guidance, training, and support to NYPD officers \nregarding how to conduct vertical patrols, including whom to stop, question, seize, search \nand arrest for trespass, results in a de facto roving checkpoint and a pattern and practice of \nunlawful stops, seizures, and arrests. \n139.  The only guiding principles provided to NYPD officers are consistent with, and reflective \nof, a policy, practice, and custom of reckless arrests based on less than probable cause.  In \nManhattan and the Bronx, the supporting deposition requires NYPD officers  to select an \n28 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 29 of 56\n\"arrest element\" for the arrestee's \"reason for presence in the building.\"  Manhattan SD at If \n5; Bronx SD «[| 5.  Some of the reasons include, but are not limited to: (a) defendant admitted \nhe was not a resident and did not know the surname or apartment number of a tenant; (b) \ndefendant identified the person and apartment they were visiting but the officer \"could not \nlocate\" the person; or (c) a defendant gives no reason, is not on the tenant roster, and the \nofficer \"could not locate\" anyone who gave them permission to enter. Id. \n140.  Under this policy, as written, people are or can be arrested for trying to visit someone \nwho is not at home or based solely on their mere presence in or around a NYCHA residence. \nPeople are also arrested in instances in which they only know their friend's first name or \nnickname, or only know the apartment by the location rather than by number.  Individuals \nwho remain silent upon questioning for trespass by NYPD officers are subject to arrest.  This \nis true even if the only basis for the NYPD officer's questioning is the fact that the individual \nwas present in a common area of a NYCHA residence. \n141.  Defendants'  vertical  patrol  policy  and  trespass  arrest  practices,  even  if  diligently \nfollowed, cause a pattern and practice of false arrests of many people who are lawfully on the \npremises.  Without probable cause to suspect criminal activity, the individual is forced to \ndefeat a presumption of guilt with the presentation of documents or witnesses at the time of \narrest. \n142.  In  addition  to  screening  for  suspected  trespassers,  another purported  purpose  of the \nvertical patrol program and trespass arrest practices is to screen and police the NYCHA \nresidents themselves.  According to Inspector  Michael  C. Phipps, Commanding  Officer, \nHousing Bureau Manhattan, the NYPD has the authority to arrest building residents and \ncharge them with second degree trespass for entering certain areas of their own building, \n29 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 30 of 56\n\"namely, the roof landings, the rooftops, store rooms, maintenance areas and basements.\" \nTestimony oflnsp.  Michael C. Phipps, New York City Council Committee on Public Safety \nand  Subcommittee  on  Public  Housing  (April  29,  2004)  at  24  (\"Phipps  Testimony\"). \nInspector  Phipps  testified  that  \"[w]hen  tenants  sign  lease  agreements  with the  Housing \nAuthority, they are advised not to enter\" these areas in their buildings. Id. \n143.  In fact,  NYCHA  leases  do not  contain  any  such  clause.  A NYCHA  lease merely \nprovides that, when  given proper notice, tenants must  comply with  all lawful  rules and \nregulations promulgated by the Landlord.  For example, signs posted in or around the lobbies \nof NYCHA residences, if any, may state \"No Trespassing\" or \"Loitering and trespassing in \nlobby,  roof,  hallway  and  stairs  is  not  permitted.  Violators  are  subject  to  arrest  and \nprosecution by Police Department.\" \n144.  Trespass is an offense  which requires that  a person unlawfully  enter or remain in a \nprohibited area.  There is no law prohibiting a resident's mere presence in or around the \nstairwells, hallways, roofs, or roof landings in his or her own apartment building.  Indeed, \nthere could be no lawful regulation or notice provision prohibiting entirely a resident's mere \npresence in his or her own hallway or stairwell. \n145.  Loitering also requires a specified unlawful purpose for being present at a location, such \nas  \"begging,\"  P.L.  §  240.35(1);  gambling,  P.L.  §  240.35(2);  sexual  conduct,  P.L.  § \n240.35(3); possessing a controlled substance,\" P.L. § 240.36 or engaging in prostitution, P.L. \n§ 240.37. \n146.  Thus, there is no legal basis for wholesale stopping, seizing, questioning, searching, and \narresting individuals, including residents, for mere presence in lobbies, roofs, hallways, and \n30 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 31 of 56\nstairwells in and around NYCHA residences.  Yet Defendants have enforced,  promoted, \nencouraged and sanctioned these customs and practices. \n147.  Defendants have failed to supervise and discipline NYPD officers who unlawfully stop, \nquestion,  seize,  search,  and  arrest  individuals  for  trespass.  On information  and belief. \nDefendants do not monitor improper stops, seizures, and searches for trespass.  Nor have \nDefendants  instituted  any follow  up  procedure  or  disciplinary  action  when  charges  are \ndismissed  or  where  it  is  otherwise  established  that  an  individual  was  arrested  without \nprobable cause. \n148.  As tenant leaders recently noted to NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly, the trend of \n\"dehumanizing policing\" in NYCHA residences is no longer about \"isolated incidences [but] \nhas become the norm in [their] communities.\" CCOP Statement. \nIII.  The  Vertical  Patrol  Policy  and  Trespass  Arrest  Practices  are  Racially \nDiscriminatory \n149.  Defendants  have  chosen  to  enforce  the  trespass  laws  in NYCHA  residences  in  an \nunlawful manner, and to do so without adequate training and controls, because of the race of \nNYCHA residents and visitors.  Defendants apply this unlawful vertical sweep policy and \ntrespass arrest practices in an intentionally discriminatory and race-based manner by focusing \nvertical patrols and trespass arrests on communities of color. \n150.  For  example,  Defendants  choose  to  target  NYCHA  residences  where  historically \nentrenched racial and residential segregation ensures that African Americans and Latinos will \nbear the brunt  of NYPD  sweeps  and  trespass  arrests.  According  to  demographic  data \nmaintained by NYHCA, over 95% of their residents are nonwhite. \n31 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 32 of 56\n151.  The rate of trespass  stops is significantly  higher in predominantly minority NYHCA \nresidences than in surrounding areas or in the rest of the city.  The disparities in arrest rates \nare even more extreme.  These disparities are not explained or justified by underlying crime \nlevels. \n152.  The role that race plays in Defendants' enforcement and officer deployment decisions is \nfurther  illustrated by the fact that the rate of trespass stops and arrests is higher, and the \ndisparity in arrest rates increases, when there is a substantial difference between the racial \ncomposition of a housing development and the population in its surrounding neighborhood. \nThus,  where  predominantly  minority  NYCHA  residences  are  in  white  or  gentrifying \nneighborhoods, there is a greater difference in trespass arrests and total enforcement.  This \nremains true after controlling for other relevant factors. \n153.  These disparities are the result of a unique and separate enforcement process consistent \nwith intentional targeting based on race.  Essentially, the enforcement practices in NYCHA \nresidences are not related to the enforcement practices in the surrounding areas.  This too is \ntrue after controlling for other relevant factors or possible explanations. \n154.  Because  vertical  patrols  and  trespass  arrests  are  conducted  in  an  intentionally \ndiscriminatory fashion, the overwhelming majority of persons arrested for trespass in New \nYork  City are African  American or Latino, despite the fact  that African  Americans and \nLatinos constitute only 54% of the city's population.  This disparity has increased over time. \n155.  African Americans are more likely to be stopped for suspicion of trespass and more likely \nto be arrested for trespass. This is true in NYCHA residences just as it is true in communities \nof color throughout the city. \n32 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 33 of 56\n156.  African Americans in New York City are stopped for trespass approximately 19 times \nmore often  than whites.  Within NYCHA residences, African  Americans are stopped on \nsuspicion of trespass 2 V2 more often as whites. \n157.  African  Americans in New York City are arrested for trespass almost ten times more \noften  than whites.  In NYHCA residences, African  Americans have over a 25% higher \nchance of being arrested for trespass. \n158.  Although whites represent 45% of the citywide population, they are only 4% of those \nstopped on suspicion of trespass and 6.7% of those arrested for trespass. \n159.  Although African Americans represent approximately 25% of the citywide population, \n61.5% of trespass  stops are of African  Americans  and 51.6% of trespass  arrests  are of \nAfrican Americans. \n160.  Defendants'  policy, practice,  and  custom  of  stopping  individuals  without  reasonable \nsuspicion,  and  arresting  individuals  for  trespass  without  probable  cause  in  NYCHA \nresidences, also has an easily foreseeable discriminatory impact on African Americans and \nLatinos. \n161.  Defendants  are aware of these constitutional violations and their disparate impact on \nminority residents of NYCHA and their visitors.  See, e.g.. People v. Ruiz, 2007 N.Y. Misc. \nLEXIS 3530, at *4 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2007); Citywide Council of Presidents of NYCHA, The \nPublic Housing Police and Public Housing Resident Perceptions (Nov. 30, 2009); New York \nLawyers for  the Public  Interest, No Place Like Home: A Preliminary Report on Police \nInteractions with Public Housing Residents in New York City 10 (2008); Barbara Ehrenreich, \nIs It Now a Crime to Be Poor?, N.Y.

Chris Fabricant, \nRousting the cops: One man stands up to the NYPD's apartheid-like trespassing crackdown. \n33 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 34 of 56\nVill.

Nevertheless,  Defendants  intentionally  allow  the  constitutional  violations  to  persist \nbecause  of  the  race,  ethnicity,  and/or  national  origin  of  NYCHA  residents  and  visitors. \nFurther, the City does not pursue similar law enforcement policies, practices, or customs, or \npermit similar levels of constitutional violations by NYPD officers in white communities. \n163.  The reckless and unregulated character of vertical patrols, and the discriminatory nature \nof Defendants'  trespass arrest practices, are well-illustrated by the recent trespass arrest of \nNYPD  Sargeant Reginald McReynolds on October 26, 2009.  Cop:  I  Was Profiled,  N.Y. \nDaily News, Dec. 30, 2009, at 21.  Sargeant McReynolds, who is assigned to the NYPD \nQuality Assurance Division, said \"[t]his incident has opened my eyes ...  I can think of no \nother reason for being stopped but my skin color.\"  Id. \n164.  The NYPD has  a long history of conducting high numbers of stop-and-frisks  in  New \nYork  City neighborhoods  largely populated  by racial  minorities.  The NYPD's  efforts  to \naggressively police \"high-crime\" areas have included  stop-and-frisks  resulting in repeated \nlitigation and close scrutiny of policing practices. \n34 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 35 of 56\n165.  African Americans are over six times more likely to be stopped and frisked by NYPD \nofficers than are whites. (1999 Office of the Attorney General \"Stop & Frisk\" Report (\"OAG \nReport\") at 95.)  In addition, stop-and-frisks  in predominantly minority precincts in New \nYork City happen at a significantly higher rate than stops in predominantly white precincts. \n(OAG Report at 101.)  When stops do occur in white neighborhoods, the disparity between \nracial  minority  and  white  \"stop\" rates  is pronounced.  (OAG  Report  at  106.)  Racial \nminorities are also more likely to be unjustly stopped, insofar as stops of racial minorities are \nless likely to lead to arrests than stops of whites.  (OAG Report at 92-3.) \n166.  According to the New  York  City Civilian  Complaint  Review  Board  (\"CCRB\"),  the \nnumber  of  complaints  received  by the  CCRB regarding unjustified  stop-and-frisks  now \ncomprises a majority  of complaints received by the CCRB.  In  1999, there were  1,240 \ncomplaints for unjustified stops and frisks. That number increased to 5,089 in 2006. \n167.  In 1999, the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a class action lawsuit, Daniels, et al. v. \nCity of New  York, et al,  No. 99-1695  (S.D.N.Y. filed 1999) {\"Daniels\"), on behalf of \nAfrican-American  and  Latino plaintiffs  challenging  the NYPD's  policy  and practice  of \nstopping-and-frisking  people of color without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity as \nrequired  by the Fourth  Amendment.  The plaintiffs  further  alleged  that  NYPD  officers \nselectively  targeted  them  on the basis  of their race, ethnicity,  and/or national  origin  in \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n168.  After that lawsuit settled, updated data revealed that there was a demonstrable increase in \nstop-and-frisks from 2002 to 2006, including extreme disparities in \"stop\" rates based on \nrace, ethnicity, or national origin.  In the first half of 2008 alone, the NYPD conducted over \n270,000 stops, a pace that would make this rate of stops the highest ever.  Statement of Marc \n35 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 36 of 56\nKrupanski, Center for Constitutional Rights, New York City Council Committee on Public \nSafety (January 29, 2009) at 2.  From 2005 through the first half of 2008, 80% of NYPD \nstops  were  of  African  Americans  and  Latinos;  85% of NYPD  frisks  were  of  African \nAmericans and Latinos; only 2.6% of stops resulted in the discovery of contraband; stops of \nwhites were more likely to yield contraband; and only 4-6% of stops resulted in an arrest. \nRacial Disparity in NYPD Stops-and-Frisks, Center for Constitutional Rights Report at 1-2. \n169.  In response to this updated data, another class-action lawsuit was filed against the City, \nFloyd v. City of New York, No. 08-1034 (S.D.N.Y. filed 2008), challenging the NYPD's \npervasive policy, custom and/or practice of stop-and-frisks under the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States and New York Constitutions. \nIV.  NYCHA's  Express  Approval  and  Adoption  of  the  Vertical  Patrol  Policy  and \nTrespass Arrest Practices \n170.  NYCHA is a public entity that receives federal financial assistance.  It owns and operates \napproximately 340 public housing developments encompassing more than 2,600 residential \nbuildings in New York City, which house more than 400,000 residents. \n171.  NYCHA's mission is to provide decent and affordable housing in a safe and secure living \nenvironment for low- and moderate-income residents throughout the five boroughs in New \nYork  City.  See,  http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycha/html/about/about.shtml  (last  visited  on \nJanuary 7, 2009). \n172.  The  NYPD's  vertical  patrol  policy  and  trespass  arrest  practices  are  specifically \nauthorized by NYCHA.  NYCHA \"has given the Police Department permission to enter \n[NYCHA] buildings and inquire of those they encounter the reasons for them being there. If \nan  unauthorized  person  is  found  there,  the  Housing  Authority  has  granted  the  Police \n36 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 37 of 56\nDepartment permission to act as a complainant on their behalf and to arrest that violator for \nthe crime of trespass.\" Phipps Testimony at 23-4. \n173.  Prior to 1995, NYCHA maintained its own police services, the Housing Authority Police \nDepartment (\"HAPD\").  Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding entered into by the \nCity Council and then-Mayor Rudy Guiliani, the HAPD merged with NYPD in 1995.  See \nPublic Safety in Public Housing Report by Committee on Public Safety and Subcommittee \non Public Housing, p. 2. \n174.  This Memorandum of Understanding required NYCHA to make annual payments to the \nNYPD equal to NYCHA's previous HAPD expenditures, adjusted for inflation. See NYCHA \nHousing: Access Granted, A Staff Report by the Council of the City of New York to the \nCommittee on Oversight and Investigations and the Sub-Committee on Public Housing, p. 4. \nThe agreement provides for NYPD to provide a level of policing that is \"over and above \nbaseline services.\" \n175.  These payments from NYCHA to the NYPD ranged from $58 million to $88 million \nannually, between  1995 and 2008. See generally id. at 4; see also Testimony of Molly \nWasow Park, Senior Analyst, Before the City Council Committee on Public Safety And the \nSubcommittee on Public Housing on Public Safety in Public Housing, April 29, 2004, p. 1 \n(\"Park\"); FY 2008 Budget Presentation, NYCHA Website. The cost of staffing the vertical \npatrols  has  been  defrayed  with  United  States  Housing  and  Urban  Development  funds \nreceived by NYCHA and transferred to the NYPD as part of a program known as \"Operation \nSafe Home\"(1995 Memorandum of Understanding, \"Operation Safe Home\"). \n176.  The NYPD maintains a dedicated Housing Bureau to police NYCHA residences.  More \nthan 1,700 uniformed officers  were assigned to the Housing Bureau as of 2004.  NYCHA \n37 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 38 of 56\nresidences receive additional police services from other NYPD officers and units, sometimes \nthrough programs such as Operation Impact. See NYCHA Housing: Access Granted, A Staff \nReport  by  the  Council  of  the  City of New  York  to  the  Committee  on  Oversight  and \nInvestigations and the Sub-Committee on Public Housing, p. ii. \n177.  Residents of NYCHA are unable to use and enjoy their residences because the vertical \npatrol policy and trespass arrest practices are conducted in such a consistently unlawful and \ndisproportionate manner that the residents are not free to come and go as they wish and their \nfamily, friends, and guests are constantly harassed and intimidated by NYPD officers. \n178.  The NYPD's policy and practice of conducting its vertical patrol policy and trespass \narrest practices within NYCHA hallways, stairwells, and other common  areas frequently \ndisrupts the domestic lives of NYCHA residents.  A door-to-door survey of 181 households \nin the Thomas Jefferson  Houses in East Harlem and the Walt Whitman Houses in Fort \nGreene, Brooklyn demonstrated that 30% of these households include a person who has been \ncharged with trespass.  In addition, 72% of households in the Thomas Jefferson  Houses \nreported that, in 2008, they and their regular visitors have been stopped by police between 5 \nto 20 times that year.  \"No Place Like Home: A Preliminary Report on Police Interactions \nwith Public Housing Residents in New York City (New York Lawyers for the Public Interest \nCommunity  Oversight  of  Policing  Project,  Sept.,  2008)  p.  2,10,  16-17,  available at \nhttp://stage.nylpi.org/pub/2008NOPLACELIKEHOMEREPORT. \n179.  The recent statement delivered to the NYPD Commissioner Kelly by NYCHA tenant \nleaders critiqued NYPD trespass enforcement and noted that residents feel like they live in \n\"penal colonies\" instead of public housing communities.  CCOP Statement. \n38 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 39 of 56\n180.  Defendants'  policy, practice,  and custom  of conducting vertical patrols  and  trespass \narrests practices in NYCHA residences disproportionately violates the rights of minorities \nliving in or visiting residences controlled by Defendant NYCHA. NYPD officers engage in a \npattern  and  practice  of  indiscriminately  stopping,  seizing,  questioning,  and  searching \nindividuals in the common areas of NYCHA residences in the absence of individualized \nobjective  facts  suggestive  of  criminality.  Coupled  with  Defendants  failure  to  provide \nadequate guidance, training and support to NYPD officers, this causes a pattern or practice of \nimproper stops, seizures, searches, and arrests of residents and visitors who are lawfully on \nthe premises of NYCHA housing. \n181.  Defendants have enforced, promoted, encouraged  and sanctioned the  above-described \npolicy of vertical patrols and trespass arrests practices and continue to do so.  As a result, \nover 90% of people arrested for trespass in New York City are African American or Latino, \ndespite the fact that African  Americans and Latinos only account for 54% of New York \nCity's  population.  Residents  of NYCHA  are unable  to  enjoy  their residences  because \nDefendants'  vertical  patrol  policy  and trespass  arrest practices  are  conducted  in  such a \nmanner that the residents are not free to come and go as they wish and their family, friends \nand guests are constantly harassed, intimidated and arrested by NYPD officers. \n182.  Because the vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices target African-American \nand Latino individuals for unlawful stops and false arrests in areas where Arrested Plaintiffs \nand/or Resident Plaintiffs  reside and/or visit, a real and immediate threat  exists that the \nFourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the Arrested Plaintiffs and Resident \nPlaintiffs  and  other  class  members  will  be  violated  by  NYPD  officers  in  the  future. \n39 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 40 of 56\nSimilarly, there is a real and immediate threat that NYPD officers will violate the Arrested \nPlaintiffs' and Resident Plaintiffs' rights under federal and state civil rights laws. \n183.  Moreover, because Defendants'  policies, practices and/or customs subject  the Named \nPlaintiffs  and other class members to stops, seizures, questions, and searches without any \nreasonable  articulable  suspicion  of criminality,  including on the basis of race,  ethnicity, \nand/or national  origin,  the Named  Plaintiffs  and  other  class members  cannot  alter  their \nbehavior to avoid future  violations of their constitutional  and civil rights at the hands of \nDefendants without sacrificing fundamental rights. \n184.  The Plaintiffs  and other members of the class have no adequate remedy at law and will \ncontinue to suffer  serious and irreparable harm to their constitutional  and statutory rights \nunless Defendants are enjoined from continuing the NYPD's policy, practice and/or custom \nof the present vertical  patrol  policy  and trespass  arrest practices, which  encourages and \nauthorizes NYPD officers to stop, seize, question, and search individuals without reasonable \nsuspicion  that  criminal  activity  is  afoot,  and  to  arrest  people  without  probable  cause, \nincluding on the basis of race, ethnicity, and/or national origin. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFirst Claim for Relief \nViolations of the Fourth Amendment \n(All Plaintiffs against the City) \n185.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 184 above. \n186.  The vertical  patrol  policy  and  trespass  arrest  practices  involve  systematic  stopping, \nseizing, questioning, and searching of any and all persons observed in common areas of \nNYCHA residences absent individualized suspicion.  Thus, each vertical patrol involves a \n40 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 41 of 56\nseries of temporary  seizures  that implicate the Fourth Amendment  to the United  States \nConstitution. \n187.  By adopting and implementing the vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices in \nthis manner, the City has enforced, promoted, encouraged and sanctioned a policy, practice \nand/or  custom  of roving pedestrian  checkpoints  for  general  crime control  wherein  they \nindiscriminately stop and seize individuals in the absence of objective, individualized criteria \nin violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n188.  By adopting and implementing the vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices in \nthis manner, the City has enforced, promoted, encouraged and sanctioned a policy, practice \nand/or  custom  of  stopping,  seizing,  questioning,  and  searching  Resident  and  Arrested \nPlaintiffs,  and  the members  of the  class they  seek to represent, without  the  reasonable \narticulable suspicion of criminality required by the Fourth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \n189.  By adopting and implementing the vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices in \nthis manner, the City has enforced, promoted, encouraged and sanctioned a policy, practice \nand/or custom of arresting Resident and Arrested Plaintiffs for trespass, and the members of \nthe class they seek to represent, without probable cause to establish that a criminal  offense \nhas been or is being committed, as required by the Fourth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \n190.  By sanctioning and enforcing the vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices in this \nmanner, the City intentionally and under color of state law has stopped, seized, questioned, \nsearched and/or arrested Resident and Arrested Plaintiffs, without reasonable suspicion or \n41 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 42 of 56\nprobable cause that a crime has been committed, in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution. \n191.  These constitutional abuses and violations were, and are, directly and proximately caused \nby policies, practices and/or customs devised, implemented, enforced, promoted, encouraged \nand sanctioned by the City, including but not limited to: (a) the failure to adequately and \nproperly  screen,  train,  and  supervise  NYPD  officers;  (b)  the  failure  to  properly  and \nadequately monitor and discipline NYPD officers; and (c) the overt and tacit encouragement \nand sanctioning of,  and the failure  to rectify,  the NYPD's  suspicionless  stops, seizures, \nquestions, searches and arrests for trespass. \n192.  The City has acted with deliberate indifference  to the Fourth Amendment rights of the \nResident and Arrested Plaintiffs and other members of the class.  As a direct and proximate \nresult of the acts and omissions of the City, Resident and Arrested Plaintiffs, and members of \nthe  class  they  seek  to  represent,  have  been  deprived  of  their  rights  under  the  Fourth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nSecond Claim for Relief \nViolations of the Equal Protection Clause \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n193.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 192 above. \n194.  Acting under color of state law, Defendants have applied the vertical patrol policy and \ntrespass  arrest  practices  against  All  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  individuals  in  an \nintentionally discriminatory and race-based manner.  Defendants have focused  enforcement \nof the vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices in African-American  and Latino \ncommunities. \n42 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 43 of 56\n195.  Defendants have targeted communities of color, such as NYCHA residences, for focused \nimplementation  of vertical  patrols  and  trespass  arrest  enforcement,  as residents  in, and \nvisitors to, these buildings are inhabited almost entirely by African Americans and Latinos. \nThis pattern of targeted enforcement is not explained or justified by underlying crime rates in \nNYCHA residences. \n196.  Defendants have acquiesced in, ratified, and failed to check widespread violations of the \nPlaintiffs'  constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, because \nof the Plaintiffs' race. \n197.  These constitutional abuses were and are directly and proximately caused by policies, \npractices and/or customs devised, implemented, enforced, encouraged, and sanctioned by the \nCity and NYCHA, including: (a) targeted implementation of vertical sweeps and trespass \narrests in communities of color; (b) the discriminatory failure to adequately and properly \nscreen,  train,  support,  and  supervise  NYPD  officers;  (c)  the  discriminatory  failure  to \nadequately and properly monitor and discipline the NYPD officers. \n198.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  Defendants'  practices,  Resident  and  Arrested \nPlaintiffs, and members of the class they seek to represent, have been deprived of their right \nto Equal  Protection  of the laws under the Fourteenth  Amendment  to the United  States \nConstitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nThird Claim for Relief \nClaims under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000(d), et seq. \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n199.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 198 above. \n43 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 44 of 56\n200.  Residents of NYCHA are unable to use and enjoy their residences because Defendants' \nvertical  patrol  policy  and  trespass  arrest  practices  are  conducted  in  such  a  consistently \nunlawful and disproportionate manner that the residents are not free to come and go as they \nwish.  Residents'  family,  friends,  and guests are harassed  and intimidated by  Defendant \nNYPD. \n201.  Plaintiffs are among the intended beneficiaries of Defendants' programs and/or activities \nreceiving federal financial assistance.  The Defendants' discriminatory practices prevent the \nPlaintiffs .from fully participating in and receiving the benefits of the programs and activities \nsupported by federal  funds.  Resident Plaintiffs  are unable to enjoy the normal rights and \nprivileges associated with tenancy in NYCHA residences.  All Plaintiffs, who are entitled to \nreceive police protection from the NYPD, are instead victimized by the NYPD's unlawful \nand discriminatory police activities. \nFourth Claim for Relief \nUnlawful Discrimination Under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (Title VIII) \n(Resident Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n202.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 201 above. \n203.

Discriminating on the basis of race, ethnicity, and/or national origin in the exercise or \nenjoyment of a dwelling by coercion, intimidation, or interference, in violation of 42 \nU.S.C. § 3617 and implementing regulations. \n204.  By the actions described above. Defendants have engaged in, and continue to engage in, a \npolicy, pattern, and practice of discrimination against African American and Latino NYCHA \nresidents due to their race, or the racial composition of their building, in violation of the Fair \nHousing Act. \n205.  The past and continuing acts and conduct of Defendants described above, were and are \nintentional, and have been carried out with deliberate indifference to the federally protected \nrights of the Resident Plaintiffs and the members of the class they seek to represent. \n206.  Defendants' policies, patterns, and practices have had, and continue to have, an adverse \nand  discriminatory  impact  on  African  Americans  and  Latinos  that  is  not justified  by \nnecessity. \n207.

Residents of NYCHA are unable to use and enjoy their residences and accommodate \nguests because Defendants' vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices are conducted \nin such an oppressive manner that the residents are not free to come and go as they wish and \ntheir family, friends, and guests are constantly harassed and intimidated. \n211.  The past and continuing acts and conduct of Defendants, described above, were and are \nintentional, and have been carried out with deliberate indifference to the federally protected \nrights of the Resident Plaintiffs and the members of the class they seek to represent. \n212.  Defendants' policies, patterns, and practices interfere with Resident Plaintiffs'  ability to \naccommodate guests because their family, friends, and guests are harassed, intimidated and \narrested by Defendants.  Defendants' policies are unreasonable and have had, and continue to \nhave, an adverse impact on African Americans and Latinos that is not justified by necessity. \n213.  Defendants  have intentionally, knowingly,  and  continuously  engaged in the practices \ndescribed above, with the intent of denying adequate housing to the Resident Plaintiffs and \nthe members of the class they seek to represent. \nSixth Claim for Relief \nUnlawful Discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n214.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 213 above. \n215.  By the actions described above, Defendants have continually denied Resident Plaintiffs, \nand the members of the class they seek to represent, the same right to make and enforce \ncontracts as is enjoyed by white citizens of the United States, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § \n1981.  Resident Plaintiffs have been denied the enjoyment of the benefits, privileges, terms. \n46 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 47 of 56\nand conditions of their contractual relationship with NYCHA, because they are limited in \ntheir ability to enter and exit their own homes, and in their ability to receive guests, due to the \nDefendants' discriminatory and unlawful vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices. \n216.  By the actions described above, Defendants have also denied all Plaintiffs the full and \nequal benefit  of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is \nenjoyed by white citizens, and have subjected them to disparate fonns of punishment, pains, \npenalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions, as compared to white citizens of the United States, \nin violation of 42 U.S.C.  §  1981.  All Plaintiffs  have been injured  by the  Defendants' \ndiscriminatory and unlawful vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices. \n217.  By the actions described above. Defendants have engaged in, and continue to engage in, a \npolicy, pattern, and practice of discrimination against African-American and Latino NYCHA \nresidents due to their race, or the racial composition of their building, in violation of 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983. \n218.  The past and continuing acts and conduct of the Defendants, described above, were and \nare  intentional,  and  have been  carried  out with  deliberate  indifference  to  the  federally \nprotected rights of the Resident Plaintiffs and the members of the class they seek to represent. \n219.  Defendants  have intentionally, knowingly,  and continuously  engaged in the practices \ndescribed  above, with the intent of denying equal housing opportunities to the Resident \nPlaintiffs and the members of the class they seek to represent. \nSeventh Claim for Relief \nViolation of Due Process Under the Fourteenth Amendment \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n220.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 219 above. \n47 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 48 of 56\n221.  Defendants' vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices, as written and as applied, \nviolates  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution, in that it authorizes and causes NYPD officers to stop, seize, question, search, \nand  arrest  individuals  for  the mere  exercise of their  constitutional rights to freedom of \nassociation  and  assembly  and  their  constitutional  rights  to  intimate  association,  in  the \nabsence of constitutionally required procedural protections. \n222.  By enforcing  the unconstitutional  vertical  patrol  policy  and trespass  arrest  practices \nthrough the initiation  and pursuit  of criminal  charges against  certain Arrested  Plaintiffs, \nwhich charges have directly resulted in arrest and detention of certain Arrested  Plaintiffs, \nDefendants  intentionally and under color of law have denied Plaintiffs  their right to due \nprocess of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nEighth Claim \nViolation of the New York Constitution, Article 1, Section 11 \n(All Plaintiffs against All Defendants) \n223.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 222 above. \n224.  Defendants have applied the vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices against All \nPlaintiffs and similarly situated individuals in an intentionally discriminatory and race-based \nmanner.  Defendants have focused  enforcement  of the vertical patrol policy and trespass \narrest practices in African-American and Latino communities. \n225.  Defendants have targeted communities of color such as NYCHA residences for focused \nimplementation of vertical patrols and trespass arrest enforcement because residents in, and \nvisitors to, these buildings are almost entirely African Americans and Latinos. \n48 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 49 of 56\n226.  Defendants have acquiesced in, ratified, and failed to address widespread violations of \nthe  Plaintiffs'  constitutional  rights  to be free from  unreasonable  searches  and  seizures, \nbecause of the Plaintiffs' race. \n227.

By adopting and implementing the vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices in \nthis manner, the City has enforced, promoted, encouraged and sanctioned a policy, practice \n49 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-00699-SAS   Document 1    Filed 01/28/10   Page 50 of 56\nand/or custom of arresting Arrested Plaintiffs for trespass, and the members of the class they \nseek to represent, without probable cause to establish that a criminal offense has been or is \nbeing committed as required by the Constitution and laws of New York. \n232.  By sanctioning and enforcing the vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices in this \nmanner, the City intentionally and under color of state law has stopped, seized, questioned, \nsearched, and/or arrested Arrested Plaintiffs, without reasonable suspicion or probable cause \nthat a crime has been committed, in violation of the Constitution and laws of the State of \nNew York. \n233.  These constitutional abuses and violations were, and are, directly and proximately caused \nby policies, practices and/or customs devised, implemented, enforced, promoted, encouraged \nand sanctioned by the City, including but not limited to: (a) the failure to adequately and \nproperly  screen,  train,  and  supervise  NYPD  officers;  (b)  the  failure  to  properly  and \nadequately monitor and discipline NYPD officers; and (c) the overt and tacit encouragement \nand sanctioning of, and the failure to rectify, the NYPD's suspicionless questioning and false \narrest practices. \n234.  As a direct and proximate result of the acts and omissions of the City, Resident and \nArrest Plaintiffs, and members of the class they seek to represent, have been deprived of their \nrights under the Constitution and laws of the State of New York. \nTenth Claim \nRespondeat Superior for False Arrest and False Imprisonment \n(Arrested Plaintiffs Against the City) \n235.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 234 above. \n236.

The  unjustifiable  and  unlawful  stops,  seizures,  questioning,  searches,  arrests,  and \nimprisonments were carried out without a warrant. \n238.  At all times mentioned, the unlawful  false arrests and imprisonments of the Arrested \nPlaintiffs were without probable cause, were forcible, and against their will. \n239.  All of the foregoing occurred without any fault on the part of Arrested Plaintiffs. \n240.  At all relevant times, these NYPD officers were employees of the City and were acting \nfor, upon, and in furtherance  of the business of their employer and within the scope of their \nemployment. \n241.  Consequently,  the City is liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for  their \ntortious actions. \nEleventh Claim \nViolation of the New York State Human Rights Law \n(Resident Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n242.

Introduction\nIn an Opinion and Order dated February 27, 2012 (\"Feb.\n27, 2012 Order\")(Docket Item 153), familiarity with which is\nassumed, I granted in part, and denied in part, plaintiffs'\nmotion seeking to compel the production of certain documents that\ndefendant City of New York (the \"City\") was withholding on the\nbasis of the attorney-client and the deliberative-process privi-\nleges (Docket Item 119).  Davis v. City of N.Y., 10 Civ. 699\n(SAS)(HBP), 2012 WL 612794 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2012).\n The City requests reconsideration of certain portions\nof the Feb. 27, 2012 Order; plaintiffs oppose the City's request\nfor reconsideration and seek reconsideration of a different\nportion of the Feb. 27, 2012 Order.  For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, both requests for reconsideration are denied in all\nrespects.\nII.  Facts\nA. Background\nThis is a civil rights action brought pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1983, and other federal and state laws, in which the\nplaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly\nsituated individuals, seek injunctive and declaratory relief and\ndamages resulting from the allegedly unlawful trespass enforce-\nment policies and practices of the defendants, the City and the\nNew York City Housing Authority (\"NYCHA\"), working together with\nthe New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\").1  \nAt the time this suit was commenced, the relevant NYPD\npolicy was reflected in Section 212-60 of the NYPD Patrol Guide\n(\"P.G. 212-60\").  Because of complaints and litigation, S. Andrew\nSchaffer, the NYPD Deputy Commission for Legal Matters undertook\nthe task of revising P.G. 212-60.  After working together with\n1 Plaintiffs' allegations are set forth in greater detail in\nan opinion issued by the Honorable Shira A. Scheindlin, United\nStates District Judge, denying the City's motion for partial\nsummary judgement.  Davis v. City of N.Y., 10 Civ. 699 (SAS),\n2011 WL 2652433 (S.D.N.Y. July 5, 2011).\n2\n\nhigh-ranking NYPD personnel and attorneys from the New York City\nCorporation Counsel's office, P.G. 212-60 was replaced by Interim\nOrder number 23 (\"I.O. 23\").  \nTwo categories of documents concerning the revisions to\nP.G. 212-60 were at issue in the Feb. 27, 2012 Order:  \"(1) legal\nmemoranda and NYPD Legal Bureau analysis of vertical patrols in\nNYCHA developments; [and] (2) correspondence and draft revisions\nto PG 212–60\" (\"Category One\" and Category Two,\" respectively)\n(Letter Brief of Tonya Jenerette, counsel to the City, dated Mar.\n15, 2011 (\"City's Letter Brief\"), at 3). \nThe Honorable Shira A. Scheindlin, United States\nDistrict Judge, in an Order, dated May 5, 2011 (\"May 5, 2011\nOrder\") found several deficiencies in the City's privilege logs\nand ordered the City to submit revised logs.  Davis v. City of\nN.Y., 10 Civ. 699 (SAS), 2011 WL 1742748 (S.D.N.Y. May 5, 2011). \nJudge Scheindlin noted that \"[c]ertain entries in the [City's\nprivilege] log reflect a blatant abuse of the assertion of\nprivilege,\" and issued the following instruction to the City:\nThus while I do not rule here on the applicability of\nthe attorney-client . . . privilege[] as [it has] not\nbeen briefed, the City is cautioned to reassess its\nassertion of all privileges carefully prior to resub-\nmitting the logs.  If a random in camera review of a\nselected group of documents on the privilege logs\nreveals that the assertion of privilege was baseless,\nthe Court will not hesitate to find that the City has\n3\n\nwaived any claim of privilege with regard to the re-\nmainder of the documents.\nDavis v. City of N.Y., supra, 2011 WL 1742748 at *4. \nPursuant to Judge Scheindlin's May 5, 2011 Order, the\nCity submitted a revised privilege log on May 27, 2011, as well\nas a \"redlined\" version illustrating the revisions made to the\noriginal privilege log.  On October 21, 2011, plaintiffs moved to\ncompel the production of 125 documents which the City asserted\nwere protected by the deliberative-process privilege, the\nattorney-client privilege, or both (see Exhibit J to the Declara-\ntion of Judson Vickers in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to\nCompel Production of Documents, dated Nov. 9, 2011 (\"Vickers\nDecl.\")(Docket Item 128)).2    \nThe City asserted the deliberative-process privilege as\nto 107 documents; the plaintiffs challenged the assertion of this\nprivilege as to 19 of these documents, on the ground that the\nCity had not established, through the information provided in the\nrevised privilege log, or through other evidence, the applicabil-\nity of the privilege.  The plaintiffs also argued that all 107\ndocuments withheld on the basis of the deliberative-process\n2 For the purposes of this Opinion and Order, I shall use\nthe document numbers from Exhibit J to the Vickers Declaration to\nrefer to the individual documents, rather then referring to the\ndocuments by Bates number.\n4\n\nprivilege should be produced because the plaintiffs' need for the\ndocuments, outweighed the publics' interest in nondisclosure.   \nThe City also asserted the attorney-client privilege as\nto all 125 documents; the plaintiffs challenged that assertion\nwith respect to 124 of those documents, either on the ground that\nthe City has provided insufficient information in its revised\nprivilege log to support the assertions of privilege, or on the\nground that the information in the privilege log did not suggest\na communication to a client containing legal advice.      \nIn my Feb. 27, 2012 Order, I first found that the\ndescriptions in the privilege log with respect to 18 of the 19\ndocuments3 withheld on the basis of the deliberative-process\nprivilege, and challenged by plaintiffs, were insufficient to\nshow the applicability of the privilege.  Davis v. City of N.Y.,\nsupra, 2012 WL 612794 at *6.  I also held that the City had\nwaived the deliberative-process privilege as to these documents\nby its failure to comply with Judge Scheindlin's May 5, 2011\nOrder directing it to revise the privilege log to address a\ndeficiency in the descriptions.  Davis v. City of N.Y., supra,\n2012 WL 612794 at *6.  I further found the dispute to be moot\n3 These are Documents 2, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 24, 25, 46, 50,\n51, 54, 55, 60, 68, 73, 74, and 105 on Exhibit J to the Vickers\nDecl.\n5\n\nwith respect to the remaining putative deliberative-process\ndocuments, because the plaintiffs did not also challenge the\nCity's assertion of the attorney-client privilege with respect to\nthese documents.4  Davis v. City of N.Y., supra, 2012 WL 612794\nat *6. \nNext, I held that plaintiffs had not shown a sufficient\nbasis to pierce the deliberative-process privilege with respect\nto the 88 documents5 which were otherwise unchallenged:\nAlthough the burden of persuasion continues to\nrest with the party seeking to prevent disclosure, and\nthe allegations at issue in this litigation are very\nserious, after considering the nature of these docu-\nments, the City's proffered reasons for withholding\nthem, the lack of allegations which would bring the\ndeliberations directly in issue and the lack of a\nsufficiently articulated need for these documents, I\nfind that, on balance, the plaintiffs' need does not\noutweigh the \"public interest in nondisclosure.\"\nDavis v. City of N.Y., supra, 2012 WL 612794 at *10 (footnote\nomitted). \n4 Document 96.\n5 These are Documents 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,\n13, 14, 18, 20, 22, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,\n38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 52, 56, 57, 58, 59,\n63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 70, 71, 72, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82,\n83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 106, 107,\n108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120,\nand 121.\n6\n\nConsequently, I also found plaintiffs' challenge to the\nCity's assertion of the attorney-client privilege to be moot as\nto these documents. \nStill in dispute were thirty-six documents,6 with\nrespect to which the City either asserted only the attorney-\nclient privilege, or the City asserted both privileges but had\nfailed to sustain its assertion of the deliberative-process\nprivilege.  \nWith respect to ten of the remaining documents,7 \"I\nf[ound] that the City ha[d] met its burden [of] providing a\ndescription sufficient to demonstrate either the giving of legal\nadvice, or the creation of a document which most likely contains\nclient confidences disclosed in connection with a request for\nlegal advice.\"  Davis v. City of N.Y., supra, 2012 WL 612794 at\n*10 (footnotes omitted).\nI also added the following in a footnote:\nThe plaintiffs argue that the City's revised privilege\nlog does not indicate a communication between a client\nand an attorney, but rather a communication between\nattorneys at the NYPD Legal Bureau and that these\ndocuments are, therefore, not protected by the\n6 These are Documents 2, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26,\n46, 50, 51, 53, 54, 55, 60, 61, 62, 68, 69, 73, 74, 97, 98, 99,\n100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 122, 123, 124, and 125 on Exhibit J\nto the Vickers Declaration.\n7 These are Documents 2, 15, 19, 24, 25, 46, 50, 55, 60, and\n105.\n7\n\nattorney-client privilege (see Memo. in Support at 12-\n15, citing Jackson v.

However, with respect to government\nlawyers, it is not uncommon for attorneys to partici-\npate in the provision of legal advice in dual capaci-\nties –- both giving legal advice to agency employees\nand requesting legal advice from in-house or outside\ncounsel.  See In re the County of Erie, 473 F.3d 413,\n421 (2d Cir. 2007).  Here, because it is the NYPD as an\nentity which is the client and the holder of the privi-\nlege, see United States v. Int'l Bhd. Of Teamsters, 119\nF.3d 210, 214-15 (2d Cir. 1997), it is likely that\ncertain members of the NYPD Legal Bureau, such as\nDeborah Zoland, Assistant Deputy Commissioner for Legal\nMatters, were essentially functioning as the requester\nof legal advice.  The fact that Ms. Zoland or others\nmay have played the role as the requester of legal\nadvice on behalf of the NYPD is especially likely\nconsidering the delegation of all matters related to\nthe revisions of P.G. 212-60 to S. Andrew Schaffer,\nhead of the NYPD legal bureau and Ms. Zoland's supervi-\nsor.  Additionally, documents created by attorneys\nwhich contain client confidences obtained in the course\nof rendering legal advice, even if not a communication\nbetween attorney and client, are properly privileged. \nECDC Envtl., L.C. v.

Application\n1. The City's Motion\nFor Reconsideration\nThe City asserts two purported bases for reconsidera-\ntion.  Neither are meritorious.\nFirst, the City argues that reconsideration of Docu-\nments 17, 21, 51, and 54, by way of in camera review, is appro-\npriate because plaintiffs did not challenge these documents on\nthe ground that the privilege log is inadequate, merely on the\nground that the documents contain \"communications . . . between\n13\n\nlawyers, with no indication of communicating legal advice to\nclient\" (City's Letter Brief 2).\nThe City mischaracterizes the arguments plaintiffs\nasserted with respect to these four documents.  In their motion\nto compel, plaintiffs made two arguments challenging the asser-\ntion of the attorney-client privilege.  First, the plaintiffs\nargued that the \"Court-Ordered privilege logs do not provide\nsufficient information about the authors or recipients of the\nchallenge documents to support [the assertion of the] attorney-\nclient privilege\" (Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs'\nMotion to Compel Production of Documents, dated Oct. 21, 2011\n(\"Memo. in Support\")(Docket Item 120), at 10).  Second, plain-\ntiffs argued that the \"attorney-client privilege does not apply\"\nto these documents because they appear to be \"communications\nbetween lawyers that do not indicate the provision of legal\nadvice to a client\" (Memo. in Support 12).  Reading plaintiffs'\nMemo. in Support together with the charts of challenged documents\nplaintiffs attached to the Amended Declaration of Jon Hee Lee in\nSupport of Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents,\ndated Oct. 26, 2011 (Docket Item 122)(\"Lee Decl.\"), it is clear\nthat plaintiffs challenged these four documents only on the\nlatter ground (Exhibit F to Lee Decl.).  However, notwithstanding\nthe title of Exhibit F to the Lee Decl. -- \"Challenged Entries\n14\n\nAsserting Attorney-Client Privilege (Attorney-Attorney Communica-\ntions Not Conveyed To A Client)\" -- plaintiffs' latter argument\nhad two distinct parts.  First, plaintiffs argued that these\ndocuments cannot be protected by the attorney-client privilege\nbecause they appear to be communications shared between attorneys\nat the NYPD Legal Bureau that were never transmitted to a client\n–- a claim I expressly rejected.  See Davis v. City of N.Y.,\nsupra, 2012 WL 612794 at *11 n.15.  However, the plaintiffs also\nargued that these documents should be produced because \"in order\nfor the attorney-client privilege to apply to the Challenged\nDocuments, the City must demonstrate that the documents consti-\ntute requests for, or the provision of, legal advice. . . .  The\nCourt-Ordered Privilege Logs to not indicate that . . . the\nChallenged Documents were a . . . communication where the 'pre-\ndominant purpose . . . is to render or solicit legal advice'\"\n(Memo. in Support 14-15, quoting In re County of Erie, 473 F.3d\n413, 419 (2d Cir. 2007)).  It was on basis of this aspect of the\nplaintiffs' second argument that I directed the City to produce\nthese documents.  See Davis v. City of N.Y., supra, 2012 WL\n612794 at *11 (\"The City's descriptions simply to not suggest\nthat an attorney's legal skills were involved in the preparation\nof these documents. . . .  Because the proponent of the privilege\nbears the burden of proof, where it is not clear that a document\n15\n\ninvolved a legal communication and a client confidence, produc-\ntion must be ordered.\").        \nThe City also argues that reconsideration is warranted\nbecause any omissions from the subject-matter descriptions are\n\"relatively minor, given the author's status as an attorney in\nthe office of [NYPD] Legal Affairs, as well as the timing of the\ncreation of these (and similar) memorandum\" with \"[s]uch omis-\nsions includ[ing] Defendant's failure to indicate the memorandum\nin question is a memorandum of law, as opposed to a memorandum\"\n(City's Letter Brief 2).  \nHere too, the City fails to show that I overlooked\ncontrolling decisions or factual matters that were put before me\non the motion.  In opposition to the plaintiffs' motion to\ncompel, the City argued that:\n[P]laintiffs argue that the documents listed in\nLee Dec. Exhibit F are not protected by the attorney-\nclient privilege because . . . (2) they constitute\ngeneral legal analysis rather than specific legal\nadvice.  Plaintiffs Brief at 14-15.\nPlaintiffs are wrong.  As previously noted, the\nvast majority of these documents are classic legal\nmemoranda addressing a variety of legal issues relating\nto NYCHA vertical patrols, PG 212-60 revisions, tres-\npassing on NYCHA property and NYCHA rulemaking.  As\nsuch, they should be afforded the same attorney-client\nprivilege protections such documents would possess in\nthe context of litigation involving non-governmental\nparties\n16\n\n(Defendant City of New York's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents, dated Nov.\n9, 2011 (\"Memo. in Opp.\")(Docket Item 127), at 12 (emphasis\nadded)(footnote and citation omitted)).\nAfter considering the City's argument, reviewing the\nprivilege log entries, and bearing in mind Judge Scheindlin's May\n5, 2011 Order in which she gave the City a second opportunity to\nsubmit a privilege log with descriptions sufficient to support\nthe asserted privileges, I found some entries to be sufficient\nand some to be insufficient.  The City appears to be requesting\nthat I reevaluate that decision without pointing to facts or law\nwhich I have overlooked.9  Accordingly, the City's motion for\nreconsideration is denied.10    \n9 The City also fails to articulate any basis for\nreconsidering my holding declining to review the challenged\ndocuments in camera.\n10 The City, implicitly acknowledging the weakness with the\ngrounds on which it seeks reconsideration, cites National Council\nof La Raza v. Department of Justice, 03 Civ. 2559 (LAK), 2004 WL\n2314455 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 14, 2004) as \"persuasive legal authority\"\nin support of its request for reconsideration.  In National\nCouncil, the Honorable Lewis A. Kaplan, United States District\nJudge, reconsidered an order directing a party to produce\npurportedly privileged documents after in camera review, despite\na finding that \"strict application of Rule 6.3 would require\ndenial of the motion for reconsideration,\" because \"the\ndeliberative process privilege, and FOIA Exemption 5, serve\nimportant public interests.\"  2004 WL 2314455 at *1.  Considering\nthe multiple opportunities the City had to update its privilege\nlog or supplement its assertion of privilege with affidavits or\n(continued...)\n17\n\n2. Plaintiffs' Motion\nFor Reconsideration\nThe plaintiffs move for reconsideration of my Feb. 27,\n2012 Order, to the extent I declined to compel the production of\nten documents, on the basis that I erred in my legal analysis and\nconclusions.11 \nPlaintiffs argue that my finding that \"the City has met\nits burden in providing a description sufficient to demonstrate\neither the giving of legal advice, or the creation of a document\nwhich most likely contains client confidences disclosed in\nconnection with a request for legal advice,\" Davis v. City of\nN.Y., supra, 2012 WL 612794 at *11, was error because \"there is\nno indication that a client requested and/or received the infor-\nmation\" (Plaintiffs' Letter Brief 4).  Plaintiffs also contend\nthat my finding that the attorney-client privilege applies even\nthough the documents were transmitted between attorneys working\nin the NYPD Legal Bureau was error (Plaintiffs' Letter Brief 4). \n10(...continued)\nother evidence, and considering the more narrow interests\ninvolved in disputes over the attorney-client privilege, rather\nthan the deliberative-process privilege and FOIA Exemption 5, I\ndecline to grant the City the same leeway Judge Kaplan granted\nthe defendant in National Council.  \n11 These are Documents 2, 15, 19, 24, 25, 46, 50, 55, 60,\nand 105.\n18\n\nThey argue that my decision warrants reconsideration because\nthere is no case law on point which supports the proposition that\ncommunications between government attorneys within one agency's\nlegal department can be protected by the attorney-client privi-\nlege and because the descriptions in the City's privilege log do\nnot demonstrate that NYPD Legal Bureau attorneys were functioning\nin dual capacities with some attorneys functioning as representa-\ntives of the NYPD entity, while others, functioning as legal\nadvisors to the NYPD (Plaintiffs' Letter Brief 4-5).\nPlaintiffs do not cite any controlling facts or legal\nauthorities that were called to my attention in connection with\nthe underlying motion that I overlooked.  Rather, the plaintiffs'\nmotion treats my Feb. 27, 2012 Order as if it were an invitation\nto further discussion and merely attempts to debate further the\nissues resolved by that Order.  Thus, the plaintiffs' motion for\nreconsideration also fails. \n19\n\nIV.  Conclusion \nThe  City's  and  the  plaintiffs'  motions  for  reconsidera­\ntion are  denied  in  their entirety. \nDated: \t New  York,  New  York \nJune  4,  2012 \nSO  ORDERED \nIL..~P~ \nHENRY  PlMAN \nUnited  States  Magistrate  Judge \nCopies  transmitted  to: \nJohnathan  J.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n-------------------------------------------------------)( \nKELTON DAVIS, et ai., individually and on \nbehalf of a class of all others similarly \nsituated, \nMEMORANDUM \n\nPlaintiffs,  OPINION AND ORDER \n\n- against- 10 Civ. 0699 (SAS) \n\nTHE CITY OF NEW YORK and NEW \nYORK CITY HOUSING AUTHORITY, \nDefendants. \n-------------------------------------------------------)( \nSHIRA A. SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.: \nAfter the close of fact discovery and as they are preparing their \nsummary judgment briefs, the parties have presented the Court with the latest in a \nlong line of discovery disputes. \nOn May 11,2012, plaintiffs asked the Court to order production of \nthe NYPD Housing Bureau's Reports of Self-Initiated Cases (\"Reports\"), which \nare summaries of investigations conducted by Integrity Control Officers CICOs\") \ninto police misconduct.1  They argued that these reports were crucial to determine \n\"the scope of the City's supervision and disciplining of Housing Bureau officers \nSee 5/11/12 Letter from Johnathan Smith (Plaintiffs' Counsel) to \nCourt (\"May 11 Letter\"). \n1 \n\nconducting unlawful stops and arrests.\"2  The City ofNew York (\"City\") \nresponded by saying that \"such documents do not exist ... ICOs do not have \njurisdiction over review of trespass arrests; complaints regarding false arrests, \nabuse of authority, discourtesy and offensive language are handled by [the \nCivilian Complaint Review Board] and complaints regarding corruption are \nhandled by [the Internal Affairs Bureau].\"3  The City cited the testimony of Chief \nDelatorre to support its argument that the Reports \"concern[] ICO oversight of \npolice officer conduct that has nothing to do with the claims asserted in this \nlawsuit.,,4  It went on to explain that \"when asked whether ICO self-initiated cases \nwere ever used to determine whether officers were conducting proper arrests Chief \nDelatorre testified that he 'can't tell you that we have looked at that specifically. \",5 \nThe City therefore objected to the production of the reports because it would be \n\"speculative and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible \nevidence.,,6 \n2  Id. at 1. \n3  5/14112 Letter from Brenda Cooke (Counsel to City) to Court  (\"May \n14 Letter\") at 1. \n4  Id. at 2. \n5  Id. \n6  Id. \n2 \n\n\nIn order to resolve the dispute, I examined two ofthe Reports in \ncamera.  I marked the portions ofReports that related to the claims in this lawsuit \nand ordered the City to tum them over to plaintiffs, along with similar material \nfrom the other Reports.7 \nPreviously, on December 21, 2011, I orally denied plaintiffs' request \nto depose an lCO because I determined that other depositions ofNYPD officials \nhad already provided plaintiffs with sufficient information about the lCOs' \nresponsibilities and that \"it is not entirely clear that the lCOs' functions... have to \ndo with this lawsuit .... [T]hese people don't investigate unlawful stops or arrests \nbecause that goes to lAB and CCRB.\"g  That decision was based on the City's \nstatement that \"most ofthe lCOs' functions have nothing to do with the issues in \nthis lawsuit.\"9 \nPlaintiffs now seek reconsideration ofmy decision; a deposition of \nan lCO is merited, they argue, because \"the newly-produced information in the \nredacted [Reports] contradicts the City's representations to the Court, and \nconfirms Plaintiffs' understanding that lCOs play an important role in monitoring, \n7  See 5/24112 Email from Court to Parties. \n\ng \n12/21111 Conference Tr. at 9:14-17. \n\n9  12119/11 Letter from Tonya Je~erette (Counsel to City) to Court. \n3 \n\ninvestigating, and/or identifying possible problems with officers' enforcement \nactivity.\"IO  The City again objects, arguing, in sum, that \"[a]mple additional \ndiscovery relevant to ICOs' actions regarding claims in this lawsuit and the \nsupervision and discipline ofHousing Bureau officers regarding the same has been \nprovided to plaintiffs.\"!! \nIt is indeed true that plaintiffs have obtained significant documentary \nand testimonial evidence regarding the ICOs.  Given that fact discovery was \nscheduled to end long ago, a case can be made that an additional deposition would \nbe \"unreasonably cumulative or duplicative\" and that \"the burden or expense of the \nproposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.\"!2 But denying plaintiffs the \ndeposition would reward the City when it in fact deserves admonishment. \nAccording to the City, the Reports it produced after my in camera \nreview contain information about 71 investigations, over a five year period, \naddressing complaints filed with the CCRB, the completion ofUF-250 forms \ndescribing stops and frisks, the execution of vertical patrols, and officers' failure \n6/8/12 Letter from Jin Hee Lee (Plaintiffs' Counsel) to Court (\"June 8 \n10 \nLetter\") at 1. \n6/11/12 Letter from Brenda Cooke (Counsel to City) to Court (June \n11 \n11 Letter\") at 2. \n12  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b )(2)(C). \n\n4 \n\n\n13 \nto comply with enforcement activity performance standards. This information is \nnot merely \"discoverable\" - i.e., \"reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of \nadmissible evidence\" - but in fact goes to the very heart ofplaintiffs' allegations. \nThese Reports should have been produced (in redacted fonn to \ninclude only relevant infonnation) at the beginning of discovery in 2010.  Had \nthey been produced, plaintiffs could have sought an ICO deposition long ago and, \nif faced with the City's resistence, could have shown the Reports to the Court. \nInstead, I denied plaintiffs' request for the deposition in part because neither they \nnor I had complete infonnation about the scope of the lCOs' role. 14 \nThe City's representations to the Court in its May 14 letter were false. \nIt is not true that Reports containing infonnation regarding the supervision and \ndiscipline of officers for unlawful stops and arrests \"do not exist\" or that the lCO \noversight relates only to \"conduct that has nothing to do with the claims asserted \nin this lawsuit.,,15  The selective and blatantly misleading quotation from Chief \n13  See June 11 Letter at 1. \n14  The City's December 19 statement that \"most of the lCOs' functions \nhave nothing to do with the issues in this lawsuit\" was technically correct.  But it \nis now clear that a not-insignificant portion of the reos' functions are relevant to \nplaintiffs' allegations. \n15 \nMay 14 Letter at 1-2. \n5 \n\n\nDelatorre's deposition, documented in full on page two ofplaintiffs , June 8 letter, \nis particularly flagrant: in contrast to the City's representation, Chief Delatorre \nstated that, \"for sure,\" the ICOs would open an investigation \"if there is an \nindication that the officer didn't understand the laws of arrest or anything along \nthose lines.\"16 \nBecause the Reports should have been produced long ago, because \nthe City has been less than forthright with the Court about the content of these \nReports and the role oflCOs, and because a deposition of an ICO is likely to lead \nto the discovery of admissible evidence, plaintiffs' request is granted.  Defendants \nshall make available for deposition an ICO from one of the Police Service Areas \nthat arrested one of the named plaintiffs; the deposition shall be limited to seven \nhours, not the one hour that the City suggests; and, given expert report deadlines, \nit shall take place by June 22.  The deposition shall not be limited to the topics in \nthe Reports  all of the ICOs' duties are appropriate subjects of investigation.\n17 \nThe deadlines for the production of expert reports and the submission of summary \n16 \nDeposition of01iefDelatorre at 479. \nAdditionally, the City is ordered to provide plaintiffs with the total \n17 \nnumber of cases listed in each Report.  Plaintiffs convincingly explain why thi s \n\"denominator\" information is relevant.  If it is easier to do so, defendants may \nsimply inform plaintiffs of these numbers without providing ne.vly-redacted \nversions of the Reports. \n6 \n\njudgment briefs will not be extended as a result of this Order. \nDated: \t New York, New York \nJune 13,2012 \n7 \n\n\nAppearances \nFor Plaintiffs: \nJohnathan Smith, Esq. \n\nJin Hee Lee, Esq. \n\nNAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc. \n\n99 Hudson Street, 16th Floor \n\nNew York, New York 10013 \n\n(212) 965-2200 \nNancy Rosenbloom, Esq. \nLegal Aid Society ofNew York \n199 Water Street \nNew York, New York 10038 \n(212) 577-3300 \nMatthew Moses, Esq. \nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP \n1285 Avenue of the Americas \nNew York, New York 10019 \n(212) 373-3000 \nFor Defendant City of New York:  For Defendant NYCHA: \nBrenda Cooke  Steven Jay Rappaport, Esq. \nJudson Vickers  New York City Housing Authority \nPernell Telfort  250 Broadway, 9th Floor \nGeorge Soterakis  New York, New York 10007 \nAssistant Corporation Counsel  (212) 776-5152 \nNew York City Law Department \n100 Church Street \nNew York, New York 10007 \n(212) 788-0993 \n8 \n",

On  reconsideration,  I  grant  the  City's \napplication  for  in  camera  review  and  upon  reviewing  the  documents \nin  camera,  I  deny  plaintiff's  application  to  compel  produc­\ntion. \nThe  first  three  documents  are  draft  memoranda  prepared \nby  a  Police  Department  attorney  to  an  Assistant  Deputy  Commis­\nsioner  addressing  several  legal  issues  that  arise  in  connection \nwith  vertical  patrol  stops  in  NYCHA-owned  buildings,  with  hand­\nwr  marginalia.  The  principal  issue  that  I  had  with  the \nCity's  listings  for  these  memoranda  in  its  index  of  privileged \n\ndocuments  was  that  the  descriptions  did  not  suggest  that  legal \nskills  had  been  involved  in  the  preparation  of  the  memoranda. \nNot  every  utterance  or  memo  from  an  attorney  to  a  client  is \nleged.  For  example,  attorneys  routinely  author  documents \nsuch  as  transmittal  letters,  memos  seeking  to  schedule  meetings, \nmemos  advising  when  meetings  will  be  held  and  memos  reporting  on \nthe  outcome  of  legal  proceedings.  None  of  these  documents  would \nbe  privileged unless  they  contained  legal  advice  or  analysis  or \nreflected a  client  con  communicated  for  the  purpose  of \nobtaining  legal  advice.  If  the  City  had  been  more  forthcoming  in \nits descriptions  of  these  three  documents  and  disclosed \nthat  they  were  dra  I  analyses,  much  time  and  trouble  could \nhave  been  avoided. \nThe  fourth  document  is  also  a  draft  memorandum  prepared \nby  a  Police  attorney  to  an  Assistant  Deputy  Commis­\nsioner  addressing  numerous  legal  issues  in  connection  with  NYCHA \nrulemaking.  It also  reflects  the  author's  legal  ysis  and  is, \ntherefore,  privi \n2 \n\n\nAccordingly,  on  recons  ration,  plainti  ,  motion  to \ncompel  product  of  documents  17,  21,  51  and  54  is denied. \nDated: \t New  York,  New  York \nJune  26,  2012 \nSO  ORDERED \nHENRY  Pl  MAN \nUnited  States  Magistrate  Judge \nCopies  transmitted  to: \nJohnathan  J.

SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.: \nI.

This \nI \nSee Davis v.  City ofNew York (\"Davis If'), No.1 0 Civ. 0699,2013 \n*\nWL 1288176, at  1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28,2013).  This case is one of three putative or \n1 \n\n\nCourt has granted in part and denied in part the parties’ motions for summary\njudgment.2  Plaintiffs now move for certification of the following class and\nsubclass:\nClass: All African-American and Latino NYCHA residents and/or\nfamily  members,  authorized  guests  or  visitors  of  NYCHA\nresidents, who, since January 28, 2007, have been or will be\nunlawfully stopped, seized, questioned, frisked, searched, and/or\narrested  for  trespass  by  New  York  City  Police  Department\n(“NYPD”) officers in or around NYCHA residences, including on\nthe basis of race and/or ethnicity.\nResident Subclass: All members of the class who are authorized\nNYCHA residents.3\nBecause plaintiffs satisfy the legal standard for class certification,\ntheir motion is granted, subject to amendment of the class definition as described\ncertified class actions challenging aspects of the NYPD’s “stop and frisk”\npractices.

Mem.”) at 2.\n2\n\nbelow.\nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nAt the class certification stage, district courts must engage in a\nrigorous analysis of the underlying facts in order to determine whether the\nplaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Rule 23. The following factual\nfindings, based on a preponderance of the evidence, are made only for the purpose\nof adjudicating this motion and will not be binding on the jury at trial.4\nA. Evidence of Unlawful Trespass Enforcement Policies and\nPractices\nThe City provides policing services to NYCHA under a 1994\nMemorandum of Understanding.  As part of these services, NYPD officers conduct\nvertical patrols in NYCHA buildings.  The procedures for conducting vertical\npatrols are described in the NYPD’s Interim Order 23 of 2010 (“IO 23 of 2010”)\nand associated training materials.  These materials direct officers to approach and\nquestion individuals in NYCHA buildings without reasonable suspicion of\ntrespass, and to arrest for trespass those who fail to leave or affirmatively establish\ntheir right to be in a NYCHA residence.5\n4 See In re Initial Pub. Offerings Sec. Litig. (“IPO”), 471 F.3d 24, 41\n(2d Cir. 2006).\n5 See Davis II, 2013 WL 1288176, at *7, *20 (discussing Memorandum\nof Understanding).  For the purposes of class certification, the City “proceeds on\n3\n\nThe procedures for conducting trespass enforcement in and around\nNYCHA buildings are chosen and implemented through the NYPD’s centralized\nand hierarchical institutional structure, which regulates officer activity through\nthe assumption (except where otherwise stated) that the Court’s two most-recent\nsummary judgment decisions sufficiently and accurately state and summarize the\nevidence and law relating to this case.”  6/7/13 Defendant City of New York’s\nMemorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification\n(“Def. Mem.”) at 2.  The primary factual issue that the City contests in its\nsubmission is plaintiffs’ characterization of certain anecdotal evidence.  See id. \nBecause the City for the most part does not contest plaintiffs’ characterization of\nthe evidence for the purposes of class certification, this Opinion’s summary of the\nevidence is brief.\nI note that New York’s Appellate Division, First Department recently\nclarified the standard under De Bour for approaching and questioning an individual\nin a NYCHA building regarding trespass.  See State v. Johnson, 2013 NY Slip Op.\n05723 (1st Dep’t Aug. 27, 2013) (holding that “an individual’s desire to avoid\ncontact with police” — as expressed by stopping on the stairs at the sight of\nofficers — does not constitute an objective credible reason to approach and\nquestion under De Bour Level 1, even in a high-crime or drug-prone location such\nas the NYCHA building where defendant was stopped).  When the officer was\nasked why he had engaged Johnson in conversation, the officer began to testify: \n“It is a NYCHA building and we’re allowed to ask anybody inside the building—” \nAs the court sustained an objection, the officer interjected, “It is a prone drug [sic]\nlocation.”  Id.  \nIn another case whose dismissal was recently reversed by the Second\nCircuit on procedural grounds, the plaintiff alleged that he entered a NYCHA\nbuilding to visit a friend, eased himself out of his wheelchair, and began to pull his\nway up a small flight of stairs.  Two officers stopped him on suspicion of trespass,\nallegedly without reasonable suspicion, and then searched his wheelchair, also\nallegedly without legal basis.  He was then arrested in part for trespass, although all\ncharges were later dismissed.  See Askins v. City of New York, No. 10 Civ. 2230,\nSlip Op. at 1–4, 8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2012), rev’d sub nom. Askins v. Doe No. 1,\nNo. 12 Civ. 0877, 2013 WL 4488698 (2d Cir. Aug. 23, 2013).\n4\n\ntraining, supervision, monitoring, and discipline.6  The record evidence at this stage\nshows that the NYPD’s trespass enforcement policies and practices have resulted\nin thousands of trespass stops that apparently lacked reasonable suspicion,7 as well\nas large numbers of apparently unjustified trespass arrests.8  Anecdotal evidence\nsuggests that the apparently unlawful stops and arrests display factual similarities\nresulting from common features of officers’ training and supervision.9\nIn addition, individual testimony and the testimony of community\nleaders confirm that the NYPD’s trespass enforcement activities in NYCHA\nbuildings have resulted in a large number of NYCHA residents being impeded in\ncoming and going freely from their homes and having guests.10  Finally, plaintiffs’\n6 See Pl. Mem. at 4–5 (collecting sources); Floyd Liability Opin., 2013\nWL 4046209, at *24–47 (describing institutional evidence of deliberate\nindifference regarding unconstitutional stops in general); Floyd v. City of New York\n(“Floyd Class Cert.”), 283 F.R.D. 153, 162–66 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (describing\ncentralized and hierarchical structure of NYPD in general).\n7 See Pl. Mem. at 6–7 (collecting statistical evidence).\n8 See id. at 7–8 (collecting evidence from prosecution declinations).\n9 See, e.g., Davis v. City of New York, No. 10 Civ. 0699, 2013 WL\n2298165, at *2–3 (S.D.N.Y. May 24, 2013) (quoting decline-to-prosecute forms\nthat appear to describe trespass stops based merely on entering and/or exiting\nNYCHA buildings); Davis I, 902 F. Supp. 2d at 412–13 (description of Raymond\nOsorio’s trespass stop, which appears to have been based merely on his exiting a\nNYCHA building).\n10 See Pl. Mem. at 8–11 (collecting sources).\n5\n\nstatistical and anecdotal evidence of racial disparities in enforcement is sufficient\nfor the purposes of class certification.11\nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS\nA.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)\nRule 23(a) permits individuals to sue as representatives of an\naggrieved class.  To be certified, a putative class must first meet all four\nprerequisites set forth in Rule 23(a), generally referred to as numerosity,\ncommonality, typicality, and adequacy.12  District courts have broad discretion in\ndeciding whether to certify a proposed class under Rule 23.13\n11 See id. at 9–10 (collecting statistical evidence); Davis II, 2013 WL\n1288176, at *16–20 (discussing evidence of racial disparities in NYCHA trespass\nenforcement); Davis I, 902 F. Supp. 2d at 435 (anecdotal evidence); Floyd Liability\nOpin., 2013 WL 4046209, at *72–75 (concluding that the NYPD’s policy of\ntargeting “the right people” for stops in general constitutes a form of indirect racial\nprofiling in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment).\n12 See Teamsters Local 445 Freight Div. Pension Fund v. Bombardier\nInc., 546 F.3d 196, 201–02 (2d Cir. 2008).  In full, Rule 23(a) reads:\nPrerequisites. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued\nas representative parties on behalf of all members only if: (1) the\nclass is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;\n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the\nclaims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the\nclaims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties\nwill fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\n13 See Parker v. Time Warner Entm’t Co. L.P., 331 F.3d 13, 28 (2d Cir.\n2003).\n6\n\n“Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard.  A party seeking\nclass certification must affirmatively demonstrate [its] compliance with the Rule —\nthat is, [it] must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous\nparties, common questions of law or fact, etc.”14  Plaintiffs seeking class\ncertification bear the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence\nthat the proposed class meets each of the requirements set forth in Rule 23(a).15 \nWhen assessing whether plaintiffs have met this burden, courts must take into\naccount “all of the relevant evidence admitted at the class certification stage.”16  A\ncourt may certify a class only after determining that “whatever underlying facts are\nrelevant to a particular Rule 23 requirement have been established.”17  This\nrigorous analysis requires examining the facts of the dispute, not merely the\npleadings, and it will frequently “entail some overlap with the merits of the\nplaintiff’s underlying claim.”18 \n14 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011)\n(emphasis in original). \n15 See Teamsters, 546 F.3d at 202.\n16 IPO, 471 F.3d at 42.\n17 Id. at 41.\n18 Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551.  “Nor is there anything unusual about\nthat consequence: The necessity of touching aspects of the merits in order to\nresolve preliminary matters, e.g., jurisdiction and venue, is a familiar feature of\nlitigation.”  Id. at 2552.\n7\n\nAt the class certification stage, “a district judge should not assess any\naspect of the merits unrelated to a Rule 23 requirement.”19  The court’s\n“determination as to a Rule 23 requirement is made only for purposes of class\ncertification and is not binding on the trier of facts, even if that trier is the class\ncertification judge.”20\n1. Numerosity\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that a class be “so numerous that joinder of all\nmembers is impracticable.”  In the Second Circuit, sufficient numerosity can be\npresumed at a level of forty members or more.21  “The numerosity requirement in\nRule 23(a)(1) does not mandate that joinder of all parties be impossible — only\nthat the difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members of the class make use of\nthe class action appropriate.”22  Courts do not require “evidence of exact class size\n19 Shahriar v. Smith & Wollensky Rest. Grp., Inc., 659 F.3d 234, 251 (2d\nCir. 2011) (quotation marks and citation omitted).  Courts must ensure “that a class\ncertification motion does not become a pretext for a partial trial of the merits.” \nIPO, 471 F.3d at 41.\n20 IPO, 471 F.3d at 41.\n21 See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473, 483\n(2d Cir. 1995) (holding that “numerosity is presumed at a level of 40 members”).\n22 Central States Se. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund v. Merck-\nMedco Managed Care, LLC, 504 F.3d 229, 244–45 (2d Cir. 2007).\n8\n\nor identity of class members to satisfy the numerosity requirement.”23\n2. Commonality\nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common\nto the class.”  Commonality thus requires plaintiffs “to demonstrate that the class\nmembers ‘have suffered the same injury.’”24  Commonality further requires that the\nclaims asserted “must depend upon a common contention . . . of such a nature that\nit is capable of classwide resolution — which means that determination of its truth\nor falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the\nclaims in one stroke.”25  \n3. Typicality\n“Typicality ‘requires that the claims of the class representatives be\ntypical of those of the class, and is satisfied when each class member’s claim arises\nfrom the same course of events[] and each class member makes similar legal\narguments to prove the defendant’s liability.’”26  The typicality requirement may be\n23 Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 (2d Cir. 1993).\n24 Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (quoting General Tel. Co. of Sw. v.\nFalcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 (1982)).\n25 Id.\n26 Central States, 504 F.3d at 245 (quoting Robinson v. Metro-N.\nCommuter R.R. Co., 267 F.3d 147, 155 (2d Cir. 2001)).\n9\n\nsatisfied where “injuries derive from a unitary course of conduct by a single\nsystem.”27  \nThe purpose of typicality is to ensure that class representatives “have\nthe incentive to prove all the elements of the cause of action which would be\npresented by the individual members of the class were they initiating\nindividualized actions.”28  A lack of typicality may be found in cases where the\nnamed plaintiff “was not harmed by the [conduct] he alleges to have injured the\nclass”29 or the named plaintiff’s claim is subject to “specific factual defenses”\natypical of the class.30\n4. Adequacy\n“Adequacy is twofold: the proposed class representative must have an\ninterest in vigorously pursuing the claims of the class, and must have no interests\nantagonistic to the interests of other class members.”31  Thus, the question of\nadequacy “entails inquiry as to whether: 1) plaintiffs’ interests are antagonistic to\n27 Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 377 (2d Cir. 1997).\n28 In re NASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., 169 F.R.D. 493, 510\n(S.D.N.Y. 1996).\n29 Newman v. RCN Telecom Servs., Inc., 238 F.R.D. 57, 64 (S.D.N.Y.\n2006). \n30 Oshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472 F.3d 506, 514 (7th Cir. 2006).\n31 Denney v. Deutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253, 268 (2d Cir. 2006).\n10\n\nthe interest of other members of the class and 2) plaintiffs’ attorneys are qualified,\nexperienced and able to conduct the litigation.”32  In order to defeat a motion for\ncertification, any conflicts between the class representative and members of the\nputative class must be “fundamental.”33\n5. Implied Requirement of Ascertainability\nSome courts have added an “implied requirement of ascertainability”34\nto the express requirements of Rule 23(a).  These courts have refused to certify a\nclass “unless the class description is sufficiently definite so that it is\nadministratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular individual\nis a member.”35  However, where the primary relief sought is injunctive rather than\ncompensatory, as here, “it is not clear that the implied requirement of definiteness\nshould apply to Rule 23(b)(2) class actions at all.”36 \nB. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2)\n32 Baffa v. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Sec. Corp., 222 F.3d 52, 60 (2d\nCir. 2000).\n33 In re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. Sec. Litig., 574 F.3d 29, 35 (2d Cir.\n2009).\n34 IPO, 471 F.3d at 30.\n35 Casale v. Kelly, 257 F.R.D. 396, 406 (S.D.N.Y. 2009).\n36 WILLIAM B. RUBENSTEIN ET AL., NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS § 3:7\nat 1-172 (2011).\n11\n\nIf the requirements of Rule 23(a) are met, the court “must next\ndetermine whether the class can be maintained under any one of the three\nsubdivisions of Rule 23(b).”37  Plaintiffs seek certification under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23(b)(2) (“Rule 23(b)(2)”).  To certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2),\nplaintiffs must show that defendants “acted or refused to act on grounds that apply\ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\nrelief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  As the Supreme Court\nexplained in Wal-Mart, Rule 23(b)(2) is intended to cover cases such as this one:\nWhen a class seeks an indivisible injunction benefitting all its\nmembers at once, there is no reason to undertake a case-specific\ninquiry into whether class issues predominate or whether class\naction  is  a  superior  method  of  adjudicating  the  dispute.\nPredominance and superiority are self-evident.38\n“[C]laims for individualized monetary damages preclude class certification under\nRule 23(b)(2)” unless the claims are “merely ‘incidental’ to the requested\ndeclaratory or injunctive relief.”39\n37 McLaughlin v. American Tobacco Co., 522 F.3d 215, 222 (2d Cir.\n2008).\n38 131 S. Ct. at 2558.  Accord Amchem Prods., Inc. v.

Co. v. Haddock, 460 Fed. App’x 26, 29 (2d Cir.\n2012) (quoting Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557–60).\n12\n\nC. The Galvan Doctrine\nUnder the doctrine established by the Second Circuit’s decision in\nGalvan v. Levine, certification of a Rule 23(b)(2) class is unnecessary when\n“prospective relief will benefit all members of a proposed class to such an extent\nthat the certification of a class would not further the implementation of the\njudgment.”40\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Claims Against the City\n1.  Plaintiffs Satisfy the Four Prerequisites of Rule 23(a)\nThe City’s argument against class certification focuses almost entirely\non the issue of commonality.41  I address that issue first, then turn to the remaining\nthree prerequisites for class certification under Rule 23(a).\na. Commonality\nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common\nto the class.”  This requires plaintiffs “to demonstrate that the class members ‘have\n40 Berger v.

(affirming denial of\ncertification of a 23(b)(2) class after the government “withdrew the challenged\npolicy” and “stated it did not intend to reinstate the policy”)).\n41 See Pl.

They are required to monitor, document, and\n42 Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 157).\n43 Id. at 2547.\n44 Id. at 2555.\n14\n\nreport their stop and frisk activity to headquarters using a uniform\nsystem;  all  officers  are  subject  to  centralized  stop  and  frisk\ntraining; performance standards are obligatory and a recognized\npart of productivity evaluations in all precincts.45\nIn addition, I noted that plaintiffs’ documentary and testimonial evidence of\nunconstitutional stops and frisks was far more extensive than the proof of\ndiscrimination rejected in Wal-Mart.46\nThe analysis that led to class certification in Floyd applies even more\nstrongly here.  Because Floyd dealt with stops, frisks, and searches of pedestrians\nin general, it involved a broader range of factual scenarios, policies, and customs\nthan are at issue in this case, which is solely concerned with the NYPD’s trespass\nenforcement activities in and around NYCHA buildings.  While the City in Floyd\nresisted the notion that stop and frisk could be described as a “program,”47 the City\ndoes not and could not dispute that the NYPD has a specific, uniform program of\ntrespass enforcement in and around NYCHA buildings.  The NYPD has a written\npolicy, IO 23 of 2010, that specifies how officers are to conduct patrols in NYCHA\n45 Floyd Class Cert., 283 F.R.D. at 173–74.\n46 See id. at 174 n.137.\n47 See, e.g., 12/20/11 Defendant City of New York’s Memorandum of\nLaw in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, Floyd v. City of\nNew York, No. 08 Civ. 1034, at 24 (stating that the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk is\nnot “a specific police interdiction program with rules and procedures”).\n15\n\nbuildings, with particular emphasis on the procedures for stopping and arresting\ntrespassers.48  This policy is embedded in a web of other policies and practices for\ntraining, supervising, monitoring, and disciplining officers who conduct trespass\nenforcement in and around NYCHA buildings.49  Unlike the delegation of\ndiscretion in Wal-Mart, these policies and practices are promulgated by senior\nofficials and determine the specific ways in which officers perform NYCHA\ntrespass enforcement.\nMoreover, because plaintiffs’ putative class is limited to residents or\nauthorized visitors who have been unlawfully subject to enforcement activities for\ntrespassing in or around NYCHA residences, the class is not overly broad.  If\nplaintiffs succeed in establishing they suffered unlawful enforcement for\ntrespassing, their legal injuries will have resulted from the NYPD’s centralized,\nhierarchical program of trespass enforcement in and around NYCHA buildings. \n48 See IO 23 of 2010, Ex. O to 12/4/12 Declaration of Brenda E. Cooke,\nAttorney for the City, in Support of the City’s Motion for Summary Judgment on\nPlaintiffs’ Claims Against the City.\n49 These policies and practices provide more than enough “glue” to hold\ntogether the individual decisions by officers and supervisors that led directly to\nplaintiffs’ alleged legal injuries.  See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552 (requiring that\nthere be “some glue” holding together the millions of employment decisions, so\nthat it will be possible “to say that examination of all the class members’ claims for\nrelief will produce a common answer to the crucial question why was I\ndisfavored”).\n16\n\nAs plaintiffs note, the claims of the putative Class and Resident Subclass are united\nby several common questions of law and fact that are susceptible to common\nproof.50  In the terminology of Wal-Mart, a class-wide proceeding here will\n“generate common answers” to these questions that are “apt to drive the resolution\nof the litigation.”51  \nb.  Numerosity, Typicality, Adequacy\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that a class be “so numerous that joinder of all\nmembers is impracticable.”  Plaintiffs have presented statistical evidence of\nthousands of apparently unjustified trespass stops in and around NYCHA buildings\nbetween 2009 and 2011, which is only a portion of the class period.52  Plaintiffs\nhave also presented sufficient testimonial and anecdotal evidence to support the\ninference that far more than forty of NYCHA’s over 360,000 African-American or\nLatino residents have been impeded in coming and going freely from their homes\n50 These questions include, for example:  “Do NYPD officers stop . . .\nindividuals for criminal trespass in and around NYCHA residences in the absence\nof reasonable, articulable suspicion . . . ?”  “Do NYPD officers stop . . . individuals\nfor criminal trespass in and around NYCHA residences at least in part because of\nrace and/or ethnicity?”  “Has the City failed to adequately train, supervise, and/or\ndiscipline officers in connection with trespass enforcement in and around NYCHA\nresidences, and have such acts and omissions caused . . . the constitutional\nviolations against Class members?”  Pl. Mem. at 17.\n51 131 S. Ct. at 2551.\n52 See Pl. Mem. at 6, 15.\n17\n\nand having guests.53\nThe City offers no arguments specifically directed at typicality or\nadequacy.54  In practice, the “‘commonality and typicality requirements of Rule\n23(a) tend to merge,’” and “‘[t]hose requirements . . . also tend to merge with the\nadequacy-of-representation requirement, although the latter requirement also raises\nconcerns about the competency of class counsel and conflicts of interest.’”55  The\nCity does not dispute the competence of plaintiffs’ attorneys to represent the\ninterests of the class.56\n2.  Class Certification Is Proper Under Rule 23(b)(2)\nLike the plaintiffs in Floyd, plaintiffs in this case have established that\nthey are entitled to class certification under Rule 23(b)(2).57  The City’s trespass\n53 See id. at 16; 6/21/13 Plaintiffs’ Reply Memorandum of Law in\nFurther Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (“Pl. Reply”) at 6.\n54 See Def. Mem. at 19, 21.  See also Pl. Mem. at 21–23 (addressing\ntypicality); id. at 23–24 (addressing adequacy).\n55 Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 n.5 (quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 157–58\n& n.13).  Accord Marisol A., 126 F.3d at 376  (stating that commonality and\ntypicality “tend to merge into one another, so that similar considerations animate\nanalysis of Rules 23(a)(2) and (3)”).\n56 See Def. Mem. at 21.  I also note that the class definition, as amended\nbelow, is clear enough to make proposed class members sufficiently ascertainable\nfor the purposes of Rule 23(b)(2).\n57 See Floyd Class Cert., 283 F.R.D. at 177–78.  Indeed, the City’s\nopposition to plaintiffs’ motion does not explicitly challenge the appropriateness of\n18\n\nenforcement activities in and around NYCHA buildings have affected the class\ngenerally, “so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is\nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.”58  If plaintiffs establish that the City’s\nNYCHA trespass enforcement policies and practices caused their injuries, a\nuniform injunctive remedy involving reforms to the City’s policies and practices\nwill provide appropriate relief.\n3. Class and Subclass Definitions\nFinally, the City is correct that plaintiffs’ proposed Class and Resident\nSubclass differ from the class structure proposed in the Amended Complaint.59  In\nparticular, the class in the Amended Complaint included not only residents and\nvisitors who have been or will be subject to unlawful trespass enforcement, but\nalso residents “whose family members, guests, and/or authorized visitors have been\nor will be unlawfully stopped, seized, questioned, searched and/or arrested for\ntrespass by NYPD officers when visiting NYCHA residents.”60  The class that\nplaintiffs now move to certify omits the latter category.  As the City observes, this\nclass certification under Rule 23(b)(2).  See Def. Mem. at i, 8–9, 11, 13–14 & n.19.\n58 Rule 23(b)(2).\n59 See Def. Mem. at 20–21.  Compare Pl. Mem. at 2, with Davis II, 2013\nWL 1288176, at *3 (citing Amended Complaint (“Am. Compl.”) ¶¶ 21–23).\n60 Am. Compl. ¶ 21.\n19\n\nomission is problematic, because plaintiffs include in the Resident Subclass\nresidents of NYCHA buildings who have never been stopped or arrested, such as\nEleanor Britt — with the result that the Resident Subclass contains individuals who\nare not members of the Class.61  \nThere are a number of ways to resolve the confusion in plaintiffs’\nproposed class structure, which is ultimately more a problem of phrasing than of\nsubstance.  Rather than certifying plaintiffs’ proposed Class and Resident Subclass,\nI am amending the proposed class definition into two overlapping classes, as\nfollows:\nStopped  Class:  All  African-American  and  Latino  NYCHA\nresidents and/or family members, authorized guests or visitors of\nNYCHA residents, who, since January 28, 2007, have been or will\nbe  unlawfully  stopped,  seized,  questioned,  frisked,  searched,\nand/or arrested for trespass by New York City Police Department\n(“NYPD”) officers in or around NYCHA residences, including on\nthe basis of race and/or ethnicity.\nResident Class: All authorized NYCHA residents who belong to\nthe Stopped Class or whose family members, authorized guests or\nvisitors, since January 28, 2007, have been or will be unlawfully\nstopped, seized, questioned, frisked, searched, and/or arrested for\ntrespass by NYPD officers in or around NYCHA residences,\nincluding on the basis of race and/or ethnicity.\nB. Claim Against NYCHA\nNYCHA does not dispute that for the purposes of plaintiffs’ USHA\n61 See Def. Mem. at 21 n.29.\n20\n\nclaims against NYCHA, resident plaintiffs satisfy the requirements for a class\nunder Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(2).62  Instead, NYCHA argues that class\ncertification is unnecessary under the Galvan doctrine, which permits courts to\ndecline class certification when “prospective relief will benefit all members of a\nproposed class to such an extent that the certification of a class would not further\nthe implementation of the judgment.”63  As plaintiffs note, however, NYCHA’s\nrefusal to withdraw, amend, or clarify the challenged House Rules argues against\nthe application of Galvan.64  This is not a case where “‘withdrawal of the\nchallenged action or non-enforcement of the challenged statute’” renders class\ncertification unnecessary.65\nV. CONCLUSION\n62 See 6/7/13 Memorandum of Law of Defendant New York City\n[Housing] Authority in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification at\n2–5.  For plaintiffs’ USHA claims against NYCHA, see generally Davis II, 2013\nWL 1288176, at *24–26.  Of course, NYCHA directs its arguments against\nplaintiffs’ proposed Resident Subclass rather than the Court’s amended Resident\nClass as defined in the previous section.  But for the purposes of plaintiffs’ USHA\nclaims, the difference between the two classes is immaterial.  \n63 Berger, 771 F.2d at 1566 (citing Galvan, 490 F.2d at 1261).\n64 See Pl.

SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.: \nThis short Memorandum Opinion and Order accompanies the Final \nOrder of Approval of Settlement and Dismissal with Prejudice filed together with \nthis Order.  I write solely to note that I am ordering the transfer of this case to \nJudge Analisa Torres - at the request of all parties - because this case is \nundoubtedly related to two other cases now pending before her - Floyd v.  City of \nNew York, and Ligon v.  City ofN  ew York. \n1 \n\nA brief history is in order.  Daniels v.  City ofN  ew York was filed in \n1999. 1  That ca:se re:sulted ln the entry of' a Stlpubtlon of' Settlement, ln whlch the \nCity agreed to maintain a written anti-racial profiling policy that complies with the \nU.S. and New York State Constitutions, to audit officers who engage in stop and \nfrisks, and to provide the results of these audits to plaintiffs' attorneys.  This Court \nretained jurisdiction over the performance of the Stipulation for four years.  Near \nthe end of that period, the Daniels plaintiffs alleged that the City was not \ncomplying with the Stipulation.  Their complaint could have been heard as a \ncontempt proceeding or as a new and related lawsuit challenging the City's \ncompliance with this Court's order in Daniels.  The latter course was chosen and \nFloyd was filed in 2008.2  Davis was filed two years later in 2010,3 and Ligon two \nyears after that in 2012.4  All three cases challenged the City's allegedly \nunconstitutional implementation of stop and frisk policies by the New York City \nPolice Department.  Floyd and Ligon were resolved after a trial and a preliminary \ninjunction hearing respectively, in which certain remedies were ordered.  These \nNo. 99 Civ. 1695 (filed March 8, 1999). \n2  No. 08 Civ. 1034 (filed January 31, 2008). \n3  No. 10 Civ. 699 (filed January 28, 2010). \n4  No. 12 Civ. 2274 (filed March 28, 2012). \n2 \n\nremedies are now known as the \"Joint Remedial Process.\"  The City initially \nordered the cases reassigned to a new judge. 5  While the appellate court suggested \nthat the cases were improperly accepted as related to Daniels,6 it nonetheless \nreassigned the two cases in tandem. 7  The City announced its intent to withdraw its \nappeals when a new administration took office in January 2014.  When the \nwithdrawal of the appeals was finalized, the Joint Remedial Process began. \nNow that the Davis case has been settled, and this Court has found \nthat the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, the parties have jointly \nrequested that the Davis case be transferred to Judge Torres as it is related to Floyd \nand Ligon and all parties believe that the three related cases should be part of one \nremedial process. 8  I, too, believe that there should be one remedial process as the \n5  Ligon v.  City ofN  ew York, 736 F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2013). \n6  See id. at 124-26. \n7  See id. at 129. \n8  See Stipulation of Settlement and Order at 10 [Dkt. 330].  See also \nTranscript of Fairness Hearing, April 22, 2015, Remarks of Jin Hee Lee, counsel \nfor Plaintiffs, at 7-8 (\"And, perhaps most importantly, this settlement calls for the \nplaintiffs' participation as equal parties in the court monitoring process that was \nordered in the related case of Floyd v.  City ofN  ew York.\") (emphasis added).  See \nalso id. at 8 (\"And through this court monitoring process plaintiffs will work in \ncollaboration with the City, the court monitor and the plaintiffs in both Floyd and \nalso the other related case, L[i}gon v.  City ofN  ew York, to implement systemic \n3 \n\ncases all challenged the same conduct and the remedies imposed by this Court will \nbenefit the p1airnLL'i's ln a11 three cases. \nI am transferring the Davis case with regret as it would have been \nmost appropriate for the judge that supervised this case - and the related cases -\nfor more than five years to supervise the implementation of the remedies imposed \nby the Court or agreed to by the parties.  Nonetheless, I do so because it is most \nimportant that the parties work together in one Joint Remedial Process to repair the \ndamage that was done during the years that the defendants in these cases violated \nthe plaintiffs' constitutional rights.  The Joint Remedial Process is underway and \nlike all New Yorkers I have the highest hopes for its success. \nSO ORDERED: \nDated:  New York, New York \nApril 28, 2015 \nreform of the NYPD.\") (emphasis added). \n4 \n\nAppearances \nFor Plaintiffs: \nElana R.

Introduction\nThis is a civil rights action brought pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1983, and other federal and state laws, in which the\nplaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly\nsituated individuals, seek injunctive and declaratory relief and\ndamages resulting from defendants' allegedly unlawful trespass\nenforcement policies and practices.  \nBy notice of motion dated October 21, 2011, plaintiffs\nmove for an Order pursuant to Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, compelling the production of certain documents1\n1 A list of the documents plaintiffs challenge is attached\nas Exhibit B to the Amended Declaration of Jon Hee Lee in Support\nof Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents, dated\nOct. 26, 2011 (Docket Item 122)(\"Lee Decl.\").\n\nthat defendants are withholding on the basis of the attorney-\nclient and the deliberative process privileges (Docket Item 119). \nFor the reasons set forth below, plaintiffs' motion is granted in\npart and denied in part.\nII.  Facts\nA. Background\nPlaintiffs allege that defendants, the City of New York\n(the \"City\") and the New York City Housing Authority (\"NYCHA\"),\n\"operating through and in conjunction with the New York City\nPolice Department (\"NYPD\"), conduct, enforce and sanction unlaw-\nful trespass arrest policies and practices [which] result in a\npattern and practice of unlawful stops, seizures, questioning,\nfrisks, searches, and arrests of residents of, and authorized\nvisitors to, NYCHA public housing residential property\" (Amended\nComplaint, dated May 27, 2011 (Docket Item 69) at ¶ 2).  Plain-\ntiffs' allegations are set forth in greater detail in an opinion\nissued by the Honorable Shira A. Scheindlin, United States\nDistrict Judge, denying the City's motion for partial summary\njudgement.  Davis v. City of N.Y., 10 Civ. 699 (SAS), 2011 WL\n2652433 (S.D.N.Y. July 5, 2011).  Judge Scheindlin summarized the\n2\n\nfacts relevant to the present discovery dispute in an Order,\ndated May 5, 2011, as follows:  \nAt the time this suit was instituted, the NYPD policy\nat issue was reflected, in part, in section 212–60 of\nthe NYPD Patrol Guide (\"P.G. 212–60\"), entitled \"Inte-\nrior Vertical Patrol of Housing Authority Buildings.\" \nIn response to complaints [and] concerns . . . .\nNYPD Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly delegated to S.\nAndrew Schaffer, NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Legal\nMatters, the task of revising P.G. 212–60 in consulta-\ntion with high-ranking NYPD personnel and attorneys\nfrom the New York City Corporation Counsel.  On July 8,\n2010, P.G. 212–60 was replaced by Interim Order number\n23 (\"I.O. 23\").  Although I.O. 23 contains much of the\nsame information as its predecessor, it differs in that\nit \"discusses in enhanced detail when 'a uniformed\nmember of the service may approach and question persons\nwho may be violating Housing Authority rules and regu-\nlations, including potentially unauthorized persons\nfound in Housing Authority buildings.'\"\nI.O. 23 was issued after the commencement of this\nsuit, but plaintiffs assert that their claims \"chal-\nlenge[ ] generally Defendants' overall vertical patrol\npolicies and trespass enforcement practices, including\nI.O. 23.\"  Plaintiffs have accordingly demanded that\nthe City produce, as part of its discovery obligations,\n\"any drafts, correspondence or memoranda concerning the\ndevelopment and implementation of Interim Order 23\" and\n\"any drafts, correspondence or memoranda concerning the\ndevelopment and implementation of the corresponding\ntraining curriculum, as well as all revisions to the\ncurriculum.\"\nDavis v.

May 5, 2011)(footnotes omitted). \nTwo categories of documents concerning the revisions to\nP.G. 212-60 are at issue here:  \"(1) legal memoranda and NYPD\n3\n\nLegal Bureau analysis of vertical patrols in NYCHA developments;\n[and] (2) correspondence and draft revisions to PG 212–60\"\n(\"Category One\" and Category Two,\" respectively) (Letter Brief of\nTonya Jenerette, counsel to the City, dated Mar. 15, 2011\n(\"City's Letter Brief\"), at 3).  In support of its assertions of\nprivilege, the City submitted a declaration from S. Andrew\nSchaffer, dated March 15, 2011, two privilege logs dated February\n25, 2011 and April 7, 2011, and a copy of P.G. 212-60 and I.O. 23\n(see City's Letter Brief and attached exhibits) .\nJudge Scheindlin, in her May 5 Order addressing the\nCity's assertion of the deliberative process privilege, held that\n\"[o]n the whole, the privilege logs submitted by the City are\ninsufficiently detailed to allow the Court to assess the legiti-\nmacy and scope of its assertion of the deliberative process\nprivilege.\"  Davis v. City of N.Y., supra, 2011 WL 1742748 at *3. \nJudge Scheindlin noted \"two major deficiencies in the City's logs\nthat render them inadequate.  First, one or more columns [are]\nmarked 'N/A' for a significant number of entries.  Second, the\nCity too often employs vague, confusing, or conclusory descrip-\ntions in the 'Subject' column.\"  Davis v. City of N.Y., supra,\n2011 WL 1742748 at *3.  Judge Scheindlin noted that, although\n\"[t]he use of \"'N/A' may in certain circumstances be appropriate,\n[when] combined with a vague description of the subject matter of\n4\n\nthe document, [the index submitted by defendants] leave[s] the\nCourt unable to assess\" whether the assertion of a privilege, as\nto a given document, is proper.  Davis v. City of N.Y., supra,\n2011 WL 1742748 at *3. \nNext, Judge Scheindlin noted that documents that fall\nwithin Categories One and Two \"are most likely\" privileged\npursuant to the deliberative process privilege.  However, \"to the\nextent that documents in Category One do not relate to the\nrevisions of P.G. 212-60 [which is the operative policy under\ndeliberation during the relevant period], but rather constitute\nanalysis of NYPD's past policy and practice of vertical patrols\nin NYCHA developments, they cannot be considered predecisional,\"\nand would not, therefore, be protected by the deliberative\nprocess privilege.  Davis v. City of N.Y., supra, 2011 WL 1742748\nat *5.  Accordingly, Judge Scheindlin ordered the City to \"revise\nits privilege logs [and provide] more detailed information about\nwhat is actually contained in the documents subsumed under\nCategory One . . . so that plaintiffs and the Court can assess\n5\n\nthe propriety of the assertions of privilege.\"2  Davis v. City of\nN.Y., supra, 2011 WL 1742748 at *5.\nFinally, Judge Scheindlin noted that \"[c]ertain entries\nin the [City's privilege] log reflect a blatant abuse of the\nassertion of privilege,\" and issued the following instruction to\nthe City:\nThus while I do not rule here on the applicability of\nthe attorney-client . . . privilege[] as [it has] not\nbeen briefed, the City is cautioned to reassess its\nassertion of all privileges carefully prior to resub-\nmitting the logs.  If a random in camera review of a\nselected group of documents on the privilege logs\nreveals that the assertion of privilege was baseless,\nthe Court will not hesitate to find that the City has\nwaived any claim of privilege with regard to the re-\nmainder of the documents.\nDavis v. City of N.Y., supra, 2011 WL 1742748 at *4. \n     B. The Present \nDiscovery Dispute\nPursuant to Judge Scheindlin's May 5 Order, the City\nsubmitted a revised privilege log on May 27, 2011, as well as a\n\"redlined\" version illustrating the revisions made to the origi-\n2 Judge Scheindlin also ordered the City to revise its\nprivilege logs with respect to Category Two documents; however,\nplaintiffs do not presently challenge the assertion of the\ndeliberative process privilege with respect to Category Two\ndocuments (Exhibit D to the Lee Decl.).  Plaintiffs do argue,\nhowever, that they have a substantial need for the Category Two\ndocuments sufficient to overcome the deliberative process\nprivilege (see infra Part III.A.4).  \n6\n\nnal privilege log (Amended Declaration of Jon Hee Lee in Support\nof Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents, dated\nOct. 26, 2011 (\"Lee Decl.\")(Docket Item 122), at ¶¶ 3-4).  125\ndocuments are at issue in this motion; the City asserts they are\nprotected by the deliberative process privilege, the attorney-\nclient privilege, or both (see Exhibit J to the Declaration of\nJudson Vickers in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel\nProduction of Documents, dated Nov. 9, 2011 (\"Vickers\nDecl.\")(Docket Item 128)).3\n The City asserts the deliberative process privilege as\nto 107 documents; the plaintiffs challenge the assertion of this\nprivilege as to 19 of these documents, on the grounds that the\nCity has not established, through the information provided in the\nrevised privilege log, or through other evidence, that these\ndocuments are predecisional and deliberative –- the two essential\nelements of the deliberative process privilege.  The plaintiffs\nalso argue that all 107 documents withheld on the basis of the\ndeliberative process privilege should be produced because the\n3 The index contained in Exhibit J to the Vickers\nDeclaration effectively summarizes the privilege log entries in\nissue here, as well as plaintiffs' arguments as to each entry. \nAccordingly, for the purposes of this Opinion and Order, I shall\nuse the document numbers from Exhibit J to the Vickers\nDeclaration to refer to the individual documents, rather then\nreferring to the documents by Bates number.\n7\n\nplaintiffs' need for the documents, outweighs the publics'\ninterest in nondisclosure (Exhibit J to Vickers Decl.).   \nThe City also asserts the attorney-client privilege as\nto all 125 documents in issue; the plaintiffs challenge that\nassertion with respect to 124 of those documents, either on the\nground that the City has provided insufficient information in its\nrevised privilege log to support the assertions of privilege, or\non the ground that the information in the privilege log does not\nsuggest a communication to a client containing legal advice\n(Exhibit J to Vickers Decl.). \nIII.  Analysis\nA. Deliberative  \nProcess Privilege\n1. Legal Principals\nRelated to the Deliberate \nProcess Privilege\nQuestions of privilege in federal civil rights cases\nare governed by federal law.  Fed. R. Evid. 501; von Bulow by\nAuersperg v. von Bulow, 811 F.2d 136, 141 (2d Cir. 1987).  The\ndeliberative process privilege was comprehensively described by\nthe Honorable Richard J. Sullivan, United States District Judge,\n8\n\nin MacNamara v. City of N.Y., 249 F.R.D. 70, 77-78 (S.D.N.Y.\n2008):\n\"The deliberative process privilege is designed to\npromote the quality of agency decisions by preserving\nand encouraging candid discussion between officials. It\nis based on 'the obvious realization that officials\nwill not communicate candidly among themselves if each\nremark is a potential item of discovery and front page\nnews.'\"  Nat'l Council of La Raza v. Dep't of Justice,\n411 F.3d 350, 356 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting Dep't of\nInterior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass'n, 532\nU.S. 1, 8-9, 121 S.Ct. 1060, 149 L.Ed.2d 87 (2001)). \nAn \"inter- or intra-agency document\" may be subject to\nthe privilege if it is both (1) \"predecisional\" and (2)\n\"deliberative.\"  La Raza, 411 F.3d at 356 (quoting\nGrand Cent. P'ship, Inc. v. Cuomo, 166 F.3d 473, 482\n(2d Cir. 1999)) (additional internal citations omit-\nted).\nA document is predecisional \"when it is prepared\nin order to assist an agency decisionmaker in arriving\nat his decision.\"  Tigue v. United States Dep't of\nJustice, 312 F.3d 70, 80 (2d Cir. 2002).  The Second\nCircuit has noted some factors to consider in determin-\ning whether a document is \"predecisional,\" including\nwhether the organization asserting the privilege can\n(1) \"pinpoint the specific . . . decision to which the\ndocument correlates\" and (2) \"verify that the document\nprecedes, in temporal sequence, the 'decision' to which\nit relates.\"  Grand Cent. P'ship, 166 F.3d at 482\n(quoting Providence Journal Co. v. United States Dep't\nof the Army, 981 F.2d 552, 557 (1st Cir. 1992)).\nA document is deliberative when it is \"actually .\n. . related to the process by which policies are formu-\nlated.\"  Grand Cent. P'ship, 166 F.3d at 482 (citing\nHopkins, 929 F.2d at 84) (additional citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).  In other words,\n\"the privilege does not protect a document which is\nmerely peripheral to actual policy formation; the\nrecord must bear on the formulation or exercise of\npolicy-oriented judgment.\" Tigue, 312 F.3d at 80 (in-\nternal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Thus,\n9\n\nthe privilege \"focus[es] on documents 'reflecting\nadvisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations\ncomprising part of a process by which governmental\ndecisions and policies are formulated.'\"  Grand Cent.\nP'ship, 166 F.3d at 482 (quoting Hopkins, 929 F.2d at\n84-85) (additional internal quotation marks and cita-\ntion omitted).  In particular, it is well-settled that\n\"[d]raft documents, by their very nature, are typically\npredecisional and deliberative.  They reflect only the\ntentative view of their authors; views that might be\naltered or rejected upon further deliberation either by\ntheir authors or by superiors.\"  Exxon Corp. v. Dep't\nof Energy, 585 F. Supp. 690, 698 (D.D.C. 1983) (inter-\nnal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also\nNat'l Council of La Raza v. Dep't of Justice, 339 F.\nSupp. 2d 572, 573 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (\"Drafts and comments\non documents are quintessentially predecisional and\ndeliberative.\").\nNevertheless, a document is not \"deliberative\"\nwhere it concerns \"purely factual\" information regard-\ning, for example, investigative matters or factual\nobservations.  See Grand Cent. P'ship, 166 F.3d at 482;\nHopkins v. U.S. Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev., 929 F.2d\n81, 85 (2d Cir. 1991).  \"Thus, factual findings and\nconclusions, as opposed to opinions and recommenda-\ntions, are not protected.\"  E.B. v. New York City Bd.\nof Educ., 233 F.R.D. 289, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n10\n\n2. The Requirement of\nan Index of Documents \nWithheld on the \nGround of Privilege\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure Section 26(b)(5)4 and\nLocal Civil Rule 26.25 both require a party withholding documents\n4 Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(5) provides: \nWhen a party withholds information otherwise\ndiscoverable by claiming that the information is\nprivileged or subject to protection as trial\npreparation material, the party must: \n(i)  expressly make the claim; and \n(ii) describe the nature of the documents,\ncommunications, or tangible things not produced or\ndisclosed -- and do so in a manner that, without\nrevealing information itself privileged or\nprotected, will enable other parties to assess the\nclaim.\n5 Local Civil Rule 26.2 provides:\n(a) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or\ndirected by the Court, where a claim of privilege is\nasserted in objecting to any means of discovery or\ndisclosure . . . and an answer is not provided on the\nbasis of such assertion, \n(1) the person asserting the privilege shall\nidentify the nature of the privilege (including\nwork product) which is being claimed and, if the\nprivilege is governed by state law, indicate the\nstate's privilege rule being invoked; and \n(2) the following information shall be\nprovided in the objection . . . unless divulgence\nof such information would cause disclosure of the\nallegedly privileged information:\n(continued...)\n11\n\non the basis of a privilege to prepare an index of the withheld\ndocuments.  In order to satisfy the requirements of these rules,\nthe index of documents withheld must, \"as to each document, . . .\nset[ ] forth specific facts that, if credited, would suffice to\nestablish each element of the privilege or immunity that is\nclaimed.\"  Golden Trade, S.r.L. v.

As the parties asserting privilege,\ndefendants have the burden of establishing through its privilege\nlog, affidavits, or other evidentiary material that the elements\nof the privilege exist.  See Johnson Matthey, Inc. v. Research\nCorp., 01 Civ. 8115 (MBM)(FM), 2002 WL 31235717 at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nOct. 3, 2002) (Mass, M.J.) (\"[W]here the information in the\nprivilege log is insufficient to establish a factual basis for\nthe privilege, the proponent of the privilege bears the burden of\nshowing its applicability, a gap which often is filled through an\naffidavit or deposition testimony.\").\n3. Plaintiffs' Specific\nChallenges to \nthe Assertion of the\nDeliberative\nProcess Privilege\nThe plaintiffs' argue that, as to 19 of the documents\nin issue,6 \"[t]he City has not established that [they] are both\npredecisional and deliberative\" (Memorandum of Law in Support of\n6 These are Documents 2, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 24, 25, 46, 50,\n51, 54, 55, 60, 68, 73, 74, 96, and 105 on Exhibit J to the\nVickers Decl.\n13\n\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents, dated Oct.\n21, 2011 (\"Memo. in Support\")(Docket Item 120), at 5).\nExcept for Document 96, each of these documents appears\nto fall within Category One –- \"legal memoranda and NYPD Legal\nBureau analysis of vertical patrols in NYCHA developments.\" \nJudge Scheindlin, in her May 5 Order, specifically directed the\nCity to \"revise its privilege logs with more detailed information\nabout what is actually contained in the documents subsumed under\nCategory One,\" because, \"to the extent that documents in Category\nOne do not relate to the revisions of P.G. 212-60, but rather\nconstitute analysis of NYPD's past policy and practice of verti-\ncal patrols in NYCHA developments, they cannot be considered\npredecisional.\"  Davis v. City of N.Y., supra, 2011 WL 1742748 at\n*5.  \nA review of the \"redlined\" version of City's Court-\nordered revised privilege log clearly demonstrates that the City\nhas made only the slightest revisions to the descriptions of some\nof the Category One documents,7 while others were not revised at\n7 For example, in Documents 17 and 51, the City merely added\na parentheses stating \"w/Handwritten Notations\" to the \"Subject\"\ndescription; in Document 54, the City removed the word \"issues\"\nfrom the \"Subject\" description; and in Document 74, the City\nadded the word \"Draft\" to the \"Subject\" description.  None of\nthese changes addressed Judge Scheindlin's request for more\nsubstantive information related to the nature of the document.   \n14\n\nall.8  It appears as though the City made no attempt to comply\nwith Judge Scheindlin's Order and provide the Court with informa-\ntion it can use to determine whether the \"legal memoranda\" and\n\"analysis\" in these Category One documents relate to past poli-\ncies, or future revisions to a policy under deliberation.  \nGiven the insufficient information provided in the\nrevised privilege log, I find that the City has failed to meet\nits burden in establishing the deliberative process privilege\nwith respect to Documents 2, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 24, 25, 46, 50,\n51, 54, 55, 60, 68, 73, 74, and 105.9  See Local Civil Rule 26.2;\n8 Documents 2, 15, 21, 24, 25, 50, 60, and 105. \n9 Although the City has offered to make the documents in\nissue available for in camera review, this is not an adequate or\nappropriate cure for the deficiencies in the City's privilege\nlog.  First, Judge Scheindlin ordered the City to supplement its\nprivilege log.  She did not give the City an option of electing\neither to supplement its privilege log or submit the withheld\ndocuments for in camera review.  Second, if in camera review were\nan adequate remedy to a deficient privilege log, there would be\nlittle reason for litigants to comply with the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure and the Local Rules and prepare an index of\ndocuments withheld on the ground of privilege.  Litigants could\nmerely submit the documents to the Court and let the Court try to\nguess what privileges might be applicable and why, while the\nadverse party would have no meaningful opportunity to participate\nor to be heard.  Third, in camera review of documents withheld on\nthe ground of privilege is only conducted in exceptional cases. \n\"In camera inspection is the exception rather than the rule . . .\n.\"  American S.S.

The\ncritical factor is frequently whether the government's delibera-\ntions, motivations, or thought process themselves are genuinely\nin issue in the case.  The privilege is routinely found to be\ninapplicable where the agency deliberations are central to the\ncase.  See, e.g., MacNamara v. City of N.Y., 04 Civ. 9612\n(KMK)(JCF), 2007 WL 755401 at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 2007)\n(Francis, M.J.)

(\"Where the decision-making process itself\nis the subject of the litigation, the deliberative privilege may\nnot be raised as a bar against disclosure of critical informa-\ntion.\").  Other courts have found it to be a critical factor in a\nbalancing of interests test.  See, e.g., In re Delphi Corp. v.\nUnited States, supra, 276 F.R.D. at 85-86 (\"Where the delibera-\ntive or decisionmaking process is the 'central issue' in the\ncase, the need for the deliberative documents will outweigh the\npossibility that disclosure will inhibit future candid debate\namong agency decision-makers.\"); Resolution Trust Corp. v.\nDiamond, supra, 773 F. Supp. at 605 (\"[T]he considerations that\nRTC took into account in its deliberations are directly in issue\nin this case, making the contested evidence highly relevant by\nthe very fact that it is deliberative.\"). \nHere, the plaintiffs do not contest the applicability\nof the deliberative process privilege to the requested documents;\n20\n\nrather, they argue that they have substantial need for these\ndocuments and that their need is sufficient to overcome the\nprivilege (Memo. in Support at 7).  I find that the plaintiffs\nhave not \"demonstrated a sufficiently 'strong need' for the\nmaterials to overcome the privilege.\"  Ingles v. City of N.Y., 01\nCiv. 8279 (DC), 2004 WL 2274653 at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 8, 2004)\n(Chin, then D.J., now Cir. J.); see also Otterson v. Nat. R.R.\nPassenger Corp., supra, 228 F.R.D. at 209.  The NYPD Deputy\nCommissioner for Legal Matters S. Andrew Schaffer, states in his\nDeclaration that:\n[t]he personal views and opinions expressed are not\nreflective of the ultimate reasons and rationales for\nissuing Interim Order 23 . . . .  The disclosure of\nthis information would create confusion as to the\nultimate basis for revising the Patrol Guide.  In\naddition, disclosure would inhibit the frank and candid\nexchange of opinions that are part of the deliberative\nprocess and which best inform final agency decisions\n[and] would inhibit ongoing and future consultations\nand deliberations that take place in the Department's\nreview of its procedures.\n \n(Schaffer Decl. ¶¶ 13-14).  These concerns are the precise\nreasons the deliberative process privilege has been recognized. \nSee MacNamara v. City of N.Y., supra, 249 F.R.D. at 77-78 (\"[The\nprivilege] is based on the obvious realization that officials\nwill not communicate candidly among themselves if each remark is\na potential item of discovery and from page news.\" (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted)).  \n21\n\n  Although the Court in MacNamara v. City of N.Y.,\nsupra, 249 F.R.D. at 83, was not ultimately persuaded by the\nargument that disclosure of protected documents would chill\ninternal candor, I find Deputy Commissioner Schaffer's concerns\nto be compelling.  The City was faced with complaints about the\nNYPD's practices which were brought before the Civilian Complaint\nReview Board and raised by NYCHA representatives and tenant\nleaders, and later, raised in the context of the current litiga-\ntion (Schaffer Decl. ¶ 4).  The NYPD, therefore, sought to modify\nits official policy so as to provide enhanced guidance to its\nofficers (Schaffer Decl. ¶ 11).  Deputy Commissioner Schaffer\ndoes not claim that discussions about modifying policy will never\noccur in the future; rather, he believes that openness in future\ndiscussions will be made more difficult if public disclosure in\nlitigation is a real possibility.  See In re Methyl Tertiary\nButyl Ether (MTBE) Prods. Liab. Litig., supra, 643 F. Supp. 2d at\n114 (\"There is a danger that a fear of public disclosure could\nchill candid debate among the case team members, resulting in\ninefficient or ineffective site remediation decisions.\" (footnote\nomitted)).\nMoreover, unlike MacNamara, this is not a case in which\nthe deliberations themselves are in issue.  The plaintiffs are\nnot arguing, for example, that the City intentionally designed\n22\n\nI.O. 23 to set impermissibly vague standards for NYPD officers,\nand, thereby, sanction illegal trespass enforcement policies and\npractices.  Rather, the plaintiffs argue that the \"[d]efendants\nimplemented and applied vertical patrol policies and trespass\nenforcement practices in violation of state and federal law and\n'in an intentionally discriminatory and race-based manner'\"\n(Memo. in Support at 7, citing Amended Complaint ¶¶ 198-216, 249)\n(emphasis added).11\nIn addition, the plaintiffs fail to sufficiently\narticulate a need for the draft documents.  Because plaintiffs\nhave not alleged the unlawfulness of I.O. 23 independent of its\napplication and implementation, and considering the fact that\nplaintiffs have a copy of I.O. 23, there is no apparent need for\ndocuments reflecting the underlying deliberations.  See Methyl\nTertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Prods. Liab. Litig., supra, 643 F.\nSupp. 2d at 114 (\"Evaluation of the propriety of the NJDEP's\nactions can be made through the use of non-privileged information\n11 Additionally, Judge Scheindlin held, in her May 5 Order,\nthat the plaintiffs were not challenging the legality of I.O. 23\nitself, but rather \"seek to challenge defendants' overall\nvertical patrol policies and trespass enforcement practices. \nPlaintiffs' position is that those practices have been and remain\ndiscriminatory, regardless of whether they are manifested in P.O.\n212-60, I.O. 23, or any other policy.\"  Davis v. City of N.Y.,\nsupra, 2011 WL 1742748 at *1 n.11; see also Letter Brief of\nJohnathan Smith, counsel to the plaintiffs, dated Mar. 29, 2011,\nat 7. \n23\n\n–- access to internal communications is unnecessary to advance\nthe argument that the NJDEP's orders did not constitute appropri-\nate remediation.\").  Although the information in the withheld\ndocuments may be relevant under the Federal Rules of Evidence,\nthe plaintiffs have not shown why these documents are critical or\nnecessary to their case.  \nAlthough the burden of persuasion continues to rest\nwith the party seeking to prevent disclosure, and the allegations\nat issue in this litigation are very serious, after considering\nthe nature of these documents, the City's proffered reasons for\nwithholding them, the lack of allegations which would bring the\ndeliberations directly in issue and the lack of a sufficiently\narticulated need for these documents, I find that, on balance,\nthe plaintiffs' need does not outweigh the \"public interest in\nnondisclosure.\"12\nBecause plaintiffs have not demonstrated an adequate\nbasis to pierce the deliberative process privilege, I need not\naddress the validity of the City's assertion of the attorney-\n12 Although the Court in MacNamara v. City of N.Y., 249\nF.R.D. at 83, suggests that protective orders can be useful to\nminimize the risk of chilling internal candor, I find that,\nconsidering the overall balance of interests in this case,\nordering disclosure of these documents subject to a protective\norder would not adequately protect the interests that underlie\nthe deliberative process privilege. \n24\n\nclient privilege, as to these documents.

Accordingly,\nthe plaintiffs' motion to compel the following documents, is\ndenied:  1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20, 22,\n27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42,\n43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 52, 56, 57, 58, 59, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67,\n70, 71, 72, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87,\n88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111,\n112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, and 121.  \nB. Attorney-Client\nPrivilege\nStill in dispute are thirty-six documents, with respect\nto which either the City asserts only the attorney-client privi-\nlege, or the City asserts both privileges but has failed to meet\nits burden and waived, the deliberative process privilege.13\n  \n1. Applicable\nLegal Principles\nThe elements of the attorney-client privilege are well\nsettled:\n13 These are Documents 2, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25,\n26, 46, 50, 51, 53, 54, 55, 60, 61, 62, 68, 69, 73, 74, 97, 98,\n99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 122, 123, 124, and 125 on\nExhibit J to the Vickers Declaration.  \n25\n\n\"The [attorney-client] privilege applies only if (1)\nthe asserted holder of the privilege is or sought to\nbecome a client; (2) the person to whom communication\nwas made (a) is a member of the bar of a court, or his\nsubordinate and (b) in connection with this communica-\ntion is acting as a lawyer; (3) the communication\nrelates to a fact of which the attorney was informed\n(a) by his client (b) without the presence of strangers\n(c) for the purpose of securing primarily either (i) an\nopinion on law or (ii) legal services or (iii) assis-\ntance in some legal proceeding, and not (d) for the\npurpose of committing a crime or tort; and (4) the\nprivilege has been (a) claimed and (b) not waived by\nthe client.\"\nBank Brussels Lambert v. Credit Lyonnais (Suisse) S.A., 160\nF.R.D. 437, 441 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (Francis, M.J.), quoting United\nStates v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 89 F. Supp. 357, 358–59 (D.\nMass. 1950); see United States v. Davis, 131 F.R.D. 391, 398\n(S.D.N.Y. 1990) (Conboy, D.J.).  The privilege \"exists to protect\nnot only the giving of professional advice to those who can act\non it, but also the giving of information to the lawyer to enable\nhim to give sound and informed advice.\"  Upjohn Co. v. United\nStates, 449 U.S. 383, 390 (1981).  Therefore, \"[i]t is now [also]\nwell established that the privilege attaches not only to communi-\ncations by the client to the attorney, but also to advice ren-\ndered by the attorney to the client, at least to the extent that\nsuch advice may reflect confidential information conveyed by the\nclient.\"  Bank Brussels Lambert v. Credit Lyonnais (Suisse) S.A.,\nsupra, 160 F.R.D. at 441–42; see also O'Brien v. Board of Educ.,\n26\n\n86 F.R.D. 548, 549 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (Leval, then D.J., now Cir.\nJ.); SCM Corp. v. Xerox Corp., 70 F.R.D. 508, 520–22 (D. Conn.\n1976).\n\"'[T]he burden is on a party claiming the protection of\na privilege to establish those facts that are the essential\nelements of the privileged relationship.'\"  von Bulow by\nAuersperg v. von Bulow, supra, 811 F.2d at 144, quoting In re\nGrand Jury Subpoena Dated Jan. 4, 1984, 750 F.2d 223, 224 (2d\nCir. 1984).  Thus, the party seeking to invoke the privilege must\nestablish all elements of the privilege.  Bowne of NYC, Inc. v.\nAmBase Corp., 150 F.R.D. 465, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (Dolinger,\nM.J.) (collecting cases).\n2. Application\nWith respect to ten of the remaining documents,14 I\nfind that the City has met its burden in providing a description\nsufficient to demonstrate either the giving of legal advice, or\nthe creation of a document which most likely contains client\nconfidences disclosed in connection with a request for legal\nadvice.  As to each of these documents, the City has identified\nthe author and recipient, and has provided a description of the\n14 These are Documents 2, 15, 19, 24, 25, 46, 50, 55, 60,\nand 105.\n27\n\ndocument which either includes a legal term of art, such as\n\"administrative stops,\" or some other language suggesting the\ndocument relates to legal advice.15  Accordingly, I find the City\nhas sustained its burden as to Documents 2, 15, 19, 24, 25, 46,\n50, 55, 60, and 105 and the plaintiffs motion to compel, as to\nthese documents, is denied.  See MacNamara v. City of N.Y.,\nsupra, 2007 WL 755401 at *7. \n15 The plaintiffs argue that the City's revised privilege\nlog does not indicate a communication between a client and an\nattorney, but rather a communication between attorneys at the\nNYPD Legal Bureau and that these documents are, therefore,  not\nprotected by the attorney-client privilege (see Memo. in Support\nat 12-15, citing Jackson v. City of N.Y., 05 Civ. 721 (RWS)(MHD),\n2006 WL 2789990 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2006) (Dolinger, M.J.)). \nHowever, with respect to government lawyers, it is not uncommon\nfor attorneys to participate in the provision of legal advice in\ndual capacities –- both giving legal advice to agency employees\nand requesting legal advice from in-house or outside counsel. \nSee In re the County of Erie, 473 F.3d 413, 421 (2d Cir. 2007). \nHere, because it is the NYPD as an entity which is the client and\nthe holder of the privilege, see United States v. Int'l Bhd. Of\nTeamsters, 119 F.3d 210, 214-15 (2d Cir. 1997), it is likely that\ncertain members of the NYPD Legal Bureau, such as Deborah Zoland,\nAssistant Deputy Commissioner for Legal Matters, were essentially\nfunctioning as the requester of legal advice.  The fact that Ms.\nZoland or others may have played the role as the requester of\nlegal advice on behalf of the NYPD is especially likely\nconsidering the delegation of all matters related to the\nrevisions of P.G. 212-60 to S. Andrew Schaffer, head of the NYPD\nlegal bureau and Ms. Zoland's supervisor.  Additionally,\ndocuments created by attorneys which contain client confidences\nobtained in the course of rendering legal advice, even if not a\ncommunication between attorney and client, are properly\nprivileged.  ECDC Envtl., L.C. v. N.Y. Marine Gen. Ins. Co., 96\nCiv. 6033 (BSJ)(HBP), 1998 WL 614478 at *10-*11 (S.D.N.Y. June 4,\n1998) (Pitman, M.J.). \n28\n\nAs to the remaining twenty-six documents,16 I find the\ndescription of each document is insufficient to sustain an\nassertion of privilege.  Some documents describe the subject\nmatter as \"Memo re: Vertical Patrol Stops in NYCHA Owned Build-\nings (s/Handwritten Notations),\" or \"Handwritten Notes Regarding\nVertical Patrols\" with no indication that legal advice was\nrequested or given.  Other documents in this category are insuf-\nficiently described because the log does not identify the author\nand intended or actual recipients—required information under\nLocal Civil Rule 26.2.  Still other documents indicate \"revi-\nsions\" to \"Lesson: Policing Housing Developments Including\nConducting Interior Vertical Patrols,\" without indicating who\ncreated the underlying document or the nature of the revisions.17 \nThe City's descriptions simply do not suggest that an attorney's\nlegal skills were involved in the preparation of these documents. \nAn attorney and client can have many communications which are not\nprivileged, for example, correspondence advising of the date and\ntime of meetings, correspondence transmitting documents, memo-\n16 These are Documents 16, 17, 21, 23, 26, 51, 53, 54, 61,\n62, 68, 69, 73, 74, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 122,\n123, 124, 125. \n17 Although I conclude that even non-legal revisions to a\ndocument which itself was privileged, would be privileged, there\nis no information provided as to the nature of the underlying\n\"Lesson\" document.  \n29\n\nranda containing purely factual material, and non-substantive\nedits and revisions to a draft document.  Because the proponent\nof the privilege bears the burden of proof, where it is not clear\nthat a document involves a legal communication and a client\nconfidence, production must be ordered.\nGiven the insufficient information provided in the\nrevised privilege log, and Judge Scheindlin's strict instructions\nin her May 5 Order, I find that the City has failed to meet its\nburden in establishing the attorney-client privilege with respect\nto Documents 16, 17, 21, 23, 26, 51, 53, 54, 61, 62, 68, 69, 73,\n74, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 122, 123, 124, and 125,\nand that these documents should be produced.

INTRODUCTION\nThis case, filed in 2010, is one of three cases currently before this\nCourt challenging aspects of the City of New York’s “stop and frisk” practices.1 \n1 Floyd v. City of New York, filed in 2008, challenges the NYPD’s stop\nand frisk practices for pedestrians, arguing among other things that the NYPD is\nsystematically violating the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution.  See Floyd v. City of New York, 283 F.R.D. 153, 159 (S.D.N.Y.\n2\n\nWhat distinguishes this case from the other two is its focus on stop and frisk\npractices at public housing properties owned and operated by the New York City\nHousing Authority (“NYCHA”).  Plaintiffs argue that the New York City Police\nDepartment (“NYPD”) uses unlawful stops, searches, and arrests to enforce the\nprohibition against trespassing in NYCHA buildings.2  According to plaintiffs, the\nNYPD’s practices violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution,\nwhich guarantees “[t]he right of the people to be secure . . . against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures.”  Plaintiffs also argue that the NYPD’s practices are based\non racial discrimination against African Americans and Latinos, and thus violate\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees “the equal protection of the laws.”\n  As the Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly affirmed,\n2012) (granting class certification); Floyd v. City of New York, 813 F. Supp. 2d 417\n(S.D.N.Y. 2011), on reconsideration, 813 F. Supp. 2d 457 (S.D.N.Y. 2011)\n(granting in part and denying in part defendants’ motion for summary judgment). \nLigon v. City of New York, filed in 2012, deals with trespass stops and arrests in\nand around privately owned buildings enrolled in the Trespass Affidavit Program\n(“TAP”).  See Ligon v. City of New York, — F. Supp. 2d —, No. 12 Civ. 2274,\n2013 WL 628534, at *44 n.461 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2013) (granting plaintiffs’\nmotion for preliminary injunction, but staying relief pending consolidated remedies\nhearing in Floyd and Ligon).\n2 See Davis v. City of New York (“Davis I”), — F. Supp. 2d —, No. 10\nCiv. 0699, 2012 WL 4813837, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2012) (granting in part and\ndenying in part defendants’ motions for summary judgment regarding individual\nplaintiffs’ arrests and tenancies).\n3\n\n“the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness.’”3  In Terry\nv. Ohio, the Supreme Court held that under the Fourth Amendment, it is\nconstitutionally reasonable for the police to “stop and briefly detain a person for\ninvestigative purposes if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by\narticulable facts that criminal activity ‘may be afoot,’ even if the officer lacks\nprobable cause.”4  This form of investigative detention is now known as a Terry\nstop.5 \nIn the years since Terry, the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit\nhave developed and refined the balance under the Fourth Amendment “‘between\nthe public interest and the individual’s right to personal security free from arbitrary\n3 Brigham City, Utah v.

Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19 (1968))).  In\njudging reasonableness, a court balances “‘the gravity of the public concerns\nserved by the seizure, the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest,\nand the severity of the interference with individual liberty.’”  Illinois v. Lidster,\n540 U.S. 419 (2004) (quoting Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47, 51 (1979)). \n4 United States v. Swindle, 407 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting\nUnited States v.

How would you feel\nabout that?\n. . .\nWhen this type of practice is instituted and done to people\non a regular basis . . . I use the term “penal colony,” it’s almost\nlike we have been colonized for a decade.9\nAt the same time, many NYCHA tenants have expressed a desire for\ngreater security services from the police, including “more officers on foot patrol\nlike we used to have when officers walked around, knew residents and built\nrelationships with them.”10  As I noted in an earlier opinion in this case, there is a\nEng.

As the\nSupreme Court recently noted, “the enshrinement of constitutional rights\nnecessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.”12  Just as public schools face\nconstitutional constraints on religious expression that do not apply to private\nschools, and public employers face constitutional restrictions that do not apply to\nprivate employers, so public security in public housing must operate within\nconstitutional limitations that would not apply in a purely private context.  NYPD\nofficers on patrol in NYCHA buildings are members of the City’s police force.  As\na result, they must operate in accord with constitutional rules that would not apply\n11 Davis I, 2012 WL 4813837, at *1 n.8 (quoting FRITZ UMBACH, THE\nLAST NEIGHBORHOOD COPS: THE RISE AND FALL OF COMMUNITY POLICING IN\nNEW YORK PUBLIC HOUSING 5 (2010)).\n12 Heller, 554 U.S. at 636.

The NYPD may not, for example, forcibly\nstop and question every person who enters a NYCHA building, as a doorman in a\nprivate building is free to do.\nIt is against this backdrop that I address plaintiffs’ and defendants’\nmotions for summary judgment.  The parties agreed to brief these motions in two\nparts.  The first part, adjudicated in October 2012, addressed the individual\ncircumstances of plaintiffs’ arrests and tenancies.13  The second part, adjudicated\nhere, addresses defendants’ practices and policies.  \nFor the reasons set forth below, the parties’ motions for summary\njudgment are granted in part and denied in part.  A summary of the Court’s\ndecisions appears in the Conclusion to this Opinion.\nII. BACKGROUND\nI begin by offering a brief summary of the procedural background to\nplaintiffs’ pending claims against the City and NYCHA.  Plaintiffs’ Amended\nComplaint identified the putative plaintiff class in this case as consisting of two\noverlapping subclasses, the “arrested plaintiffs” and the “resident plaintiffs.”14 \nPlaintiffs identified the following thirteen plaintiffs as representing the arrested\n13 See Davis I, 2012 WL 4813837.\n14 See Amended Complaint (“Am. Compl.”) ¶¶ 21–23. \n8\n\nplaintiffs:  Anthony Anderson, Adam Cooper, Rikia Evans, Vaughn Frederick,\nRoman Jackson, Kristin Johnson, Edwin Larregui, Patrick Littlejohn, Raymond\nOsorio, Lashaun Smith, William Turner, Andrew Washington, and David Wilson.15 \nPlaintiffs identified the following eight plaintiffs as representing the resident\nplaintiffs:  Eleanor Britt, Kelton Davis, Frederick, Shawne Jones, Littlejohn,\nHector Suarez, Washington, and Evans.16  Plaintiff Geneva Wilson, a NYCHA\nresident and aunt of David Wilson who was eighty years old at the time of the\nAmended Complaint, was not listed as representing either subclass.17 \nPrior to the filing of the Amended Complaint, nine of the named\nplaintiffs accepted offers of judgment from the City pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 68, but continued to assert their claims against NYCHA: \nAnderson, Cooper, Davis, Jones, Larregui, Suarez, Turner, David Wilson, and\nGeneva Wilson.18   \nIn the Amended Complaint, plaintiffs brought the following claims:\n15 See id. ¶ 46.  \n16 See id. ¶ 47.  \n17 See id. ¶¶ 46–47, 89–100.\n18 See id. ¶ 1 n.1; Davis v.

Oct. 18, 2011) (awarding attorney’s fees to settling\nplaintiffs).\n9\n\n(1) The  arrested  plaintiffs  who  had  not  accepted  offers  of\njudgment  from  the  City  (Evans,  Frederick,  Jackson,\nJohnson,  Littlejohn,  Osorio,  Smith,  and  Washington)\nbrought Fourth Amendment, New York State Constitution\n(“NYSC”) article 1 section 12 (which guarantees security\nagainst  unreasonable  searches  and  seizures),  and\nrespondeat superior claims against the City.19  Plaintiffs\nalso  alleged  violations  of  resident  plaintiffs’  Fourth\nAmendment rights, but did not plead a claim based on these\nviolations.20 \n(2) The resident plaintiffs brought claims against the City and\nNYCHA under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968\n(the  “Fair  Housing  Act”  or  “FHA”),  the  United  States\nHousing Act (the “USHA”), the Civil Rights Act of 1866\n(42 U.S.C. § 1981, or “section 1981”), and the New York\nState and City Human Rights Laws (the “NYSHRL” and\n“NYCHRL”).21 \n(3) All plaintiffs brought claims against the City and NYCHA\nunder the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI of the Civil\nRights  Act  of  1964  (“Title  VI”),  and  NYSC  article  1\nsection 11 (which guarantees equal protection).22 \nBecause it was undisputed in Davis I that Frederick and Washington are not\n19 See Am.

LEGAL STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n“Summary judgment is designed to pierce the pleadings to flush out\nthose cases that are predestined to result in a directed verdict.”32  Thus, summary\njudgment is appropriate “only where, construing all the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the non-movant and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party’s\nfavor, there is ‘no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.’”33  “A fact is material if it might affect the\noutcome of the suit under the governing law, and an issue of fact is genuine if the\nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving\nparty.”34  \n32 Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., 110 F.3d 898, 907 (2d Cir. 1997).\n33 Rivera v. Rochester Genesee Reg’l Transp. Auth., 702 F.3d 685, 692\n(2d Cir. 2012) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)) (other quotations omitted).\n34 Windsor v. United States, 699 F.3d 169, 192 (2d Cir. 2012)\n(quotations and alterations omitted).\n13\n\n“[T]he burden of demonstrating that no material fact exists lies with\nthe moving party . . . .”35  “When the burden of proof at trial would fall on the non-\nmoving party, it ordinarily is sufficient for the movant to point to a lack of\nevidence to go to the trier of fact on an essential element of the non[-]movant’s\nclaim.”36  In turn, to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party\nmust raise a genuine issue of material fact.37  The non-moving party “‘must do\nmore than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material\nfacts,’”38 and cannot “rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated\nspeculation.”39  \nIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, “[t]he role of the court is\nnot to resolve disputed issues of fact but to assess whether there are any factual\nissues to be tried.”40  “‘Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence,\n35 Miner v. Clinton Cnty., N.Y., 541 F.3d 464, 471 (2d Cir. 2008)\n(citation omitted).\n36 Jaramillo v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 536 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 2008).\n37 See id.\n38  Brown v.

MONELL LIABILITY\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“section 1983”) creates “‘a species of tort\nliability’” for, among other things, certain violations of constitutional rights.42  As\nthe Supreme Court established in Monell v. New York City Department of Social\nServices,43 in order to have recourse against a municipality or other local\ngovernment under section 1983, plaintiffs “must prove that ‘action pursuant to\nofficial municipal policy’ caused the alleged constitutional injury.”44  “In other\n41 Redd v.

Interpreting the language of section 1983 and\nthe legislative history surrounding its passage in the Civil Rights Act of 1871, the\nCourt in Monell held that local governing bodies could be held liable either on the\nbasis of formally approved policies or on the basis of “‘customs’” or “‘usages.’” \nId. at 690–91 (quoting Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 167–68\n(1970)).\n44 Cash v. County of Erie, 654 F.3d 324, 333 (2d Cir. 2011), cert.\ndenied, 132 S. Ct. 1741 (2012) (quoting Connick v. Thompson, 131 S. Ct. 1350,\n1359 (2011), in turn quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 691 (quotation marks omitted)). \nCases after Monell “considerably broadened the concept of official municipal\naction.”  Amnesty Am. v. Town of W. Hartford, 361 F.3d 113, 125 (2d Cir. 2004)\n(Sotomayor, J.). \n15\n\nwords, municipalities are ‘responsible only for their own illegal acts,’ and cannot\nbe held ‘vicariously liable under § 1983 for their employees’ actions.’”45  In\ngeneral, “[o]fficial municipal policy includes the decisions of a government’s\nlawmakers, the acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so persistent and\nwidespread as to practically have the force of law.”46  Such policies “may be\npronounced or tacit and reflected in either action or inaction.”47\nOne way to establish the existence of a municipal policy is through a\nshowing of “deliberate indifference” by high-level officials.  “‘[W]here a\npolicymaking official exhibits deliberate indifference to constitutional deprivations\ncaused by subordinates, such that the official’s inaction constitutes a deliberate\nchoice, that acquiescence may be properly thought of as a city policy or custom\nthat is actionable under § 1983.’”48  “Deliberate indifference” requires “‘proof that\na municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.’”49\n45 Cash, 654 F.3d at 333 (quoting Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1359) (certain\nquotation marks omitted).\n46 Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1359 (citing Monell, 436 U.S. at 694; Pembaur\nv. Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 479 (1986); Adickes, 398 U.S. at 167–68).\n47 Cash, 654 F.3d at 334.\n48 Id. (quoting Amnesty, 361 F.3d at 126).\n49 Connick, 131 S.

Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 410 (1997)).\n16\n\nRecognizing that “deliberate indifference” is “a stringent standard of\nfault,” the Second Circuit requires “that the policymaker’s inaction was the result\nof ‘conscious choice’ and not ‘mere negligence.’”50  The Second Circuit has also\nheld that municipal liability can be established “by demonstrating that the actions\nof subordinate officers are sufficiently widespread to constitute the constructive\nacquiescence of senior policymakers.”51  \nA municipality may incur Monell liability based on deliberate\n50 Cash, 654 F.3d at 334 (quoting Connick, 131 S.Ct at 1360; Amnesty,\n361 F.3d at 128). \n51 Sorlucco v.

DISCUSSION\nA.  Fourth Amendment Claims Against the City\nBoth Davis I and the preliminary injunction opinion in Ligon included\ndetailed discussions of the law of seizures.55  As the Supreme Court reaffirmed in\nFlorida v. Bostick, the test for determining whether a Terry stop has taken place “is\nwhether a reasonable person would feel free to decline the officers’ requests or\notherwise terminate the encounter.”56  Whether a stop has taken place depends on\n“whether, taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter,\nthe police conduct would ‘have communicated to a reasonable person that he was\nnot at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.’”57  \nWhile the Supreme Court explicitly refrained from determining\nCash, 654 F.3d at 334.  “Where the plaintiff establishes all three elements, then . . .\nthe policymaker should have known that inadequate training or supervision was ‘so\nlikely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the policymakers of the\ncity can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.’” \nWalker, 974 F.2d at 298 (quoting Canton, 489 U.S. at 390).  In order to establish\nMonell liability based on the Walker test, plaintiffs must also, of course, show that\nthe training or supervision was in fact inadequate and that this inadequacy caused\nplaintiffs’ constitutional injuries.  See Reynolds, 506 F.3d at 193.\n55 See Ligon, 2013 WL 71800, at *28–29, *41–42; Davis I, 2012 WL\n4813837, at *2–15.\n56 501 U.S. 429, 436 (1991).\n57 Id. at 437 (quoting Michigan v.

(collecting cases) (emphasis added and citations omitted).  Accord\nINS v. Delgado, 466 U.S. 210, 216 (1984) (“[P]olice questioning, by itself, is\nunlikely to result in a Fourth Amendment violation . . . [u]nless the circumstances\nof the encounter are so intimidating as to demonstrate that a reasonable person\nwould have believed he was not free to leave if he had not responded.” (emphasis\nadded)).  The Supreme Court did not rule in Bostick, nor in Delgado, that\nquestioning, or a request for identification, cannot rise to the level of a Terry stop. \nRather, the Court affirmed that the manner and context of police conduct are\nrelevant to the inquiry into whether a reasonable person would have felt free to\nterminate the encounter.  As the Second Circuit has noted, this inquiry is\nessentially “an objective assessment of the overall coercive effect of the police\nconduct.”  United States v. Lee, 916 F.2d 814, 819 (2d Cir. 1990) (citing\nChesternut, 486 U.S. at 573–74).\n20\n\nthrough “‘an intimidating show of authority.’”61\nThe Second Circuit has held that the following factors are indicative\nof a “seizure,” a term that encompasses both Terry stops and arrests:\nthe  threatening  presence  of  several  officers;  the  display  of  a\nweapon;  the  physical  touching  of  the  person  by  the  officer;\nlanguage or tone indicating that compliance with the officer was\ncompulsory; prolonged retention of a person’s personal effects,\nsuch as airplane tickets or identification; and a request by the\nofficer to accompany him to the police station or a police room.62\nIn Ligon, I noted two examples of police encounters that the Second Circuit held to\nbe Terry stops, despite their arguably low level of coercion:\nThe Second Circuit has held . . . that a stop took place where an\nofficer twice ordered a person to “hold on a second,” and after the\nsecond order the person stopped.  The Second Circuit also held\nthat a stop occurred where an officer pointing a spotlight at a\nperson said, “What, are you stupid?  Come here.  I want to talk to\n61 Bostick, 501 U.S. at 438 (quoting Bostick, 501 U.S. at 447 (Marshall,\nJ., dissenting)) (emphasis omitted).\n62 United States v.

Drayton, 536 U.S. 194, 203–04\n(2002) (concluding, under Bostick framework, that reasonable passenger on bus\nwould feel free to leave, where “officers gave the passengers no reason to believe\nthat they were required to answer the officers’ questions,” and officer asking\nquestions of passengers “did not brandish a weapon or make any intimidating\nmovements,” “left the aisle free so that respondents could exit,” and “spoke to\npassengers one by one and in a polite, quiet voice”).

De Bour\nand its progeny,74 a few words regarding the relationship between De Bour and the\nFourth Amendment will be useful.  I highlight one important difference between\nDe Bour and the Fourth Amendment:  these two sources of law draw the line\nbetween permissible and impermissible police encounters in different ways; as a\nresult, De Bour is in some respects more protective of liberty from governmental\n70 Illinois v.

LAFAVE, SEARCH & SEIZURE § 9.5(c) (5th ed. 2012).\n72 United States v. Bayless, 201 F.3d 116, 133 (2d Cir. 2000).\n73 See City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 37 (2000) (citing\nChandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 308 (1997)).\n74 People v. De Bour, 40 N.Y.2d 210 (1976).  See, e.g., City Mem. at 6;\nLigon, 2013 WL 628534, at *35–39.\n24\n\nintrusion than the Fourth Amendment, and in other respects less.75\n75 In the words of the Second Circuit, as already noted, whether a stop\nhas taken place under the Fourth Amendment depends on “an objective assessment\nof the overall coercive effect of the police conduct.”  Lee, 916 F.2d at 819 (citing\nChesternut, 486 U.S. at 573–74).  The line between constitutional and\nunconstitutional police questioning — in the absence of reasonable suspicion —\nmay depend on how threatening or intimidating an officer’s behavior was during\nthe encounter.  See id. (collecting cases).  Thus, the Fourth Amendment places\ngreat weight on the manner in which police officers carry out questioning, because\nan officer’s manner can convey the message that the questioned person is not free\nto terminate the encounter.  See Bostick, 501 U.S. at 436–39.\nBy contrast, De Bour and its progeny tend to emphasize the content of\npolice questioning, not its manner.  In People v. Hollman, the New York Court of\nAppeals reaffirmed De Bour and stated that “as a general matter, . . . basic,\nnonthreatening questions regarding, for instance, identity, address or destination\n. . . need be supported only by an objective credible reason not necessarily\nindicative of criminality.”  79 N.Y.2d 181, 185 (1992).  Accord id. at 191 (“[A]\nrequest for information is a general, nonthreatening encounter in which an\nindividual is approached for an articulable reason and asked briefly about his or her\nidentity, destination, or reason for being in the area.”).  Only if an officer poses\n“more pointed questions” is a founded suspicion of criminality required.  Id. at\n185.  As the Court of Appeals concluded:  “To some extent, . . . our distinction\nrests on the content of the questions, the number of questions asked, and the degree\nto which the language and nature of the questions transform the encounter from a\nmerely unsettling one to an intimidating one.”  Id. at 192.  In other words, the\ndistinction rests, for the most part, on what questions the police ask, not how they\napproach and ask them.\nDe Bour’s largely content-based approach to police questioning is\ndistinct from the more manner-based approach of the Fourth Amendment.  An\nofficer could conceivably comply with De Bour but violate the Fourth Amendment\nby, for example, approaching and questioning a NYCHA resident, without\nreasonable suspicion, in a hostile, aggressive manner that would make a reasonable\nperson not feel free to terminate the encounter — but asking only questions\nconcerning identity, address, and destination.  On the other hand, an officer might\ncomply with the Fourth Amendment but violate De Bour by, for example,\napproaching and questioning a NYCHA resident, without a founded suspicion of\ncriminality, in a polite, respectful, and non-coercive manner — but asking\n25\n\n1.  Plaintiffs’ Claim of an Unconstitutional Policy\nThe City and plaintiffs have both moved for summary judgment on\nplaintiffs’ claim that the City’s written trespass enforcement policies (as opposed\nto the City’s unwritten practices) violate the Fourth Amendment.  I will discuss\nplaintiffs’ motion first, and then turn to the City’s motion.  For the reasons stated\nbelow, both motions for partial summary judgment are denied.\na. Plaintiffs’ Motion\nPlaintiffs’ motion argues that it is undisputed that the City’s policy, as\nembodied in Interim Order 23 of 2010 (“IO 23”) and associated training materials,\ninstructs NYPD officers that they may do the following:  “without reasonable\nsuspicion or probable cause, NYPD officers can command people to affirmatively\nestablish their right to be in a NYCHA residence or leave the premise, and then\narrest those who refuse to comply.”76  Plaintiffs argue that this scheme authorizes\nNYPD officers to stop NYCHA residents and guests without reasonable suspicion,\nquestions whose contents fell outside the scope of a “request for information”\nunder Hollman.\n76 12/15/12 Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment (“Pl. Mem. (Policy)”) at 5.  The City presents IO 23 as\nthe policy that has governed “vertical patrols” in NYCHA buildings since 2010. \nSee 12/4/12 Defendant City of New York’s Statement of Facts Pursuant to Local\nRule 56.1 ¶ 118.  IO 23 should not to be confused with Interim Orders 22 and 23 of\n2012, which concern vertical patrols in private TAP buildings.  See Ligon, 2013\nWL 628534, at *24–25.\n26\n\nand to arrest NYCHA residents and lawful guests for criminal trespass without\nprobable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.77 \nThe City presents plaintiffs’ challenge to the stop and arrest policies\nof IO 23 as a facial rather than as-applied challenge.78  Plaintiffs’ challenge is facial\nat least in the sense that plaintiffs focus exclusively on the language of IO 23 and\nrelated training materials, and do not argue that they are entitled to summary\njudgment based on undisputed evidence of how IO 23 is applied.79  The Second\n77 Because neither party has argued otherwise, I assume in the following\ndiscussion that the same constitutional standards govern police encounters during a\nvertical patrol and when patrolling a sidewalk.  Neither party has argued, for\nexample, that under the reasonableness analysis of the Fourth Amendment,\ndifferent standards should apply to vertical patrols in NYCHA buildings, just as\nspecial standards apply for vehicle checkpoints.  See Edmond, 531 U.S. at 45–46\n(“[P]rogrammatic purposes may be relevant to the validity of Fourth Amendment\nintrusions undertaken pursuant to a general scheme without individualized\nsuspicion.” (collecting cases)); Terry, 392 U.S. at 15 (“[O]f course, our approval of\nlegitimate and restrained investigative conduct undertaken on the basis of ample\nfactual justification should in no way discourage the employment of other remedies\nthan the exclusionary rule to curtail abuses for which that sanction may prove\ninappropriate.”); Ligon, 2013 WL 628534, at *35 n.398.\n78 See, e.g., City Opp. (Policy) at 10.\n79 The distinction between facial and as-applied challenges is not always\nclear, and has been defined in various ways.  See, e.g., Richard H. Fallon, Jr., Fact\nand Fiction about Facial Challenges, 99 CAL. L. REV. 915 (2011) (defining facial\nchallenges as “ones that, if accepted, would establish that a statute has no valid\napplications whatsoever,” and on this basis, concluding that the Supreme Court has\nupheld facial challenges under an “astonishingly large number of constitutional\nprovisions,” but also noting that “it is sometimes difficult to differentiate facial\nfrom as-applied challenges, partly but not exclusively because the Court is often\n27\n\nCircuit has stated that in order to succeed on a facial challenge to a statute, at least\noutside of the First Amendment context, the challenger must show that “‘no set of\ncircumstances exists under which the [statute] would be valid, i.e., that the law is\nunconstitutional in all of its applications,’ or at least that it lacks a ‘plainly\nlegitimate sweep.’”80  Thus, in the present case, plaintiffs must show, at minimum,\nthat there is no set of circumstances under which the undisputed stop and arrest\nscheme laid out in IO 23 and related training materials, as described above, would\nbe valid, or at least that the scheme lacks a plainly legitimate sweep.\ni. Plaintiffs’ Challenge to IO 23 Arrest Policy\nThe City correctly argues that plaintiffs lack standing for their facial\nchallenge of IO 23’s arrest policy, because no plaintiff has been subjected to the\nkind of arrest that plaintiffs contest.81  That is, no plaintiff has been arrested for\ncriminal trespass in a NYCHA building simply based on refusal to answer an\nofficer’s questions and refusal to leave when requested by an officer.\ninattentive to the distinction”).  As I have previously stated, “[t]here are few areas\nof the law that are as confused and conflicted as the law governing facial\nchallenges.”  In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Prods.

Washington State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442,\n449 (2008) (quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n81 See City Opp. (Policy) at 10.\n28\n\n“To establish Article III standing, an injury must be ‘concrete,\nparticularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action;\nand redressable by a favorable ruling.’”82  No plaintiff has suffered an actual,\nconcrete injury from the IO 23 arrest policy that is the focus of plaintiffs’ facial\nchallenge.  Plaintiffs’ reply brief points to Rikia Evans, a guest in a NYCHA\nbuilding who was arrested for trespass after refusing to answer an officer’s\nquestions and refusing to provide her identification on request.83  But Evans\nspecifically alleged that she was not offered the opportunity to exit the building\nafter she refused to establish her right to be there.84  Because plaintiffs have offered\nno evidence of any person being arrested under IO 23’s arrest policy simply for\nrefusing to answer questions and refusing to leave on request, plaintiffs’ injuries\nare insufficient to confer standing.85\n82 Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, — S. Ct. —, 2013 WL 673253, at *7\n(2013) (quoting Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 130 S. Ct. 2743, 2752\n(2010)).\n83 See 1/18/13 Plaintiffs’ Reply Memorandum of Law in Further Support\nof Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (“Pl. Reply (Policy)”) at 5; Davis I, 2012\nWL 4813837, at *10–15.\n84 See Davis I, 2012 WL 4813837, at *11.\n85 I note, however, that the constitutionality of IO 23’s arrest policy\ncould be relevant to the deliberate indifference analysis of plaintiffs’ Monell claim. \nIf, hypothetically, the City were to cite the development and implementation of IO\n23 as evidence that it has not been deliberately indifferent to earlier, problematic\n29\n\narrest practices, then any authorization of unconstitutional conduct in IO 23 would\nweaken the City’s argument.  In order to avoid repetition if the issue of the\nconstitutionality of IO 23’s arrest policy arises again in this case, I offer the\nfollowing observations on the arguments already presented in the parties’ briefs: \nThe City defends IO 23’s arrest policy in part by suggesting that\nNYPD officers have authority under New York Penal Law section 140.10(f) to\nrevoke the permission of any person to be inside a NYCHA building.  See City\nOpp. (Policy) at 6–8.  The City analogizes section 140.10(f) to section 140.10(d),\nwhich is similarly phrased but involves trespass on school property “in violation of\na personally communicated request to leave the premises from a principal,\ncustodian, school board member or trustee, or other person in charge thereof.” \nCourts have held that under section 140.10(d), a principal or other person in charge\nwho makes a personally communicated request to leave the premises thereby\nrevokes whatever privilege the person had to be on the premises.  See Matter of\nMax X., 717 N.Y.S.2d 773, 774–75 (3d Dep’t 2000) (“[A]ny license or privilege\nthat respondent may have had at the time he entered the school building was\nrevoked when the principals advised him that he had no right to be on the school\npremises and was required to leave.”); Arum v. Miller, 331 F. Supp. 2d 99, 109–10\n(E.D.N.Y. 2004) (concluding that when “a person capable of revoking permission\nto be in the school” asks a visiting parent to leave, and the parent does not comply,\nthis is “sufficient to create probable cause for a police officer to arrest an individual\nfor criminal trespass in the third degree” under section 140.10(d)).\nBut the City provides no basis for concluding that an NYPD officer\nhas the legal authority to revoke a person’s privilege to be in a NYCHA building,\nas a principal does in a school.  In support of the NYPD’s authority to revoke\npermission to be in a NYCHA building, the City cites People v. Brown, which\nstates:  “Since it is clear that defendant lawfully entered the premises, a conviction\ncould be had only if the prosecution established that (1) a lawful order not to\nremain was personally communicated to the defendant and (2) that he defied such a\nlawful order.”  306 N.Y.S.2d 449, 452 (1969).  Similarly, the City cites a case in\nwhich a tenant revoked whatever privilege a guest might have had to be in her\napartment.  See People v. Randolph, 795 N.Y.S.2d 782, 783 (3d Dep’t 2005). \nRather than answering the question of when, if ever, an NYPD officer has the legal\nauthority to revoke someone’s privilege to be in a NYCHA building, however,\nthese citations beg the question.  Both deal with circumstances in which the person\nrevoking the privilege clearly had the legal right to do so. \nUnless NYPD officers have some legal authority, as yet unidentified,\n30\n\nii. Plaintiffs’ Challenge to IO 23 Stop Policy\nIO 23 states that upon encountering “persons who may be violating\nHousing Authority rules and regulations, including potentially unauthorized\npersons within NYCHA property,” officers are to “[a]pproach the person(s) and\nask: (1) If he or she lives in the building[;] (2) If he or she is visiting someone in\nthe building[;] (3) If he or she has business in the building.”86  IO 23 then states, in\nitalics:  “When a person’s authority to be present in the building is in question,\ntake reasonable measures to verify such authority (e.g., asking for identification, a\nkey to the building entrance doors, etc.).”87  IO 23 explicitly warns that “an officer\nmay not stop (temporarily detain) a suspected trespasser unless the officer\nreasonably suspects that the person is in the building without authority.”88  The\nCity acknowledges in its brief that IO 23 authorizes police to approach and\nto revoke at will the privilege to be inside a NYCHA building, the refusal to obey\nan officer’s request to leave cannot constitute probable cause for a trespass arrest. \nA person’s refusal to obey a request to leave a NYCHA building from someone\nwho has no authority to revoke the privilege to be in the building provides no\nevidence that the person is not lawfully in the building.\n86 IO 23, Ex.

First, not every\npolice encounter involving the kinds of questions and requests described in IO 23\ninevitably constitutes a Terry stop.  The test for whether a police encounter rises to\nthe level of a Terry stop is whether, in light of the totality of the circumstances, a\nreasonable person would “feel free to decline the officers’ requests or otherwise\nterminate the encounter.”91  Because questions and requests concerning purpose\nand identity could be carried out in such a manner that a reasonable person would\nfeel free to terminate the encounter, such questioning is neither categorically inside\nor outside the scope of Fourth Amendment protection.  The level of coercive effect\nwill depend on the totality of the circumstances, including, for example, “‘the\n89 See City Opp. (Policy) at 4.\n90 Although some of plaintiffs’ stops occurred before the promulgation\nof IO 23, others occurred after.  See, e.g., Davis I, 2012 WL 4813837, at *3–4\n(Osorio’s November 18, 2010 stop), *10–15 (Evans’ October 16, 2010 stop). \nEvans continues to live in NYCHA housing.

Accord Ligon, 2013 WL\n628534, at *17 (concluding that a plaintiff had not provided adequate evidence that\nthe police conveyed a message that compliance with their requests was required,\nwhere officers approached and asked questions politely and without coercion).  It\nis true that based on the evidence at the preliminary injunction hearing in Ligon, I\nexpressed skepticism as to whether an expansive program of suspicionless police\nencounters involving intrusive field interrogations and ID requests could avoid\nresulting in widespread constitutional violations — especially where officers\nreceived inaccurate training on the Fourth Amendment.  As I stated there:\nIf  the  difference  between  a  Terry  stop  and  a  less  intrusive\nencounter hinges on indefinite factors such as the demeanor and\npositioning of the officers; and if it is safe to assume that officers\nroutinely display their authority and power through aggressive\nbehavior, as many of the officers did in their encounters with\nplaintiffs in the instant case; then a training program that invites\nofficers to approach large numbers of people and question them\nwithout reasonable suspicion will inevitably result in frequent\nTerry  stops  that  lack  reasonable  suspicion,  effectively\n33\n\non IO 23 do not rise to the level of stops;94 plaintiffs argue the contrary.95  The\ndispute between the parties represents a genuine issue of material fact that will\nhave to be resolved by a fact-finder based on evidence of actual police encounters,\nnot based simply on a textual analysis of IO 23.96\nSecond, it is true, as plaintiffs argue, that IO 23 contains no criteria for\nidentifying either persons who may be violating Housing Authority rules or\npersons whose authority to be in the building is questionable, yet presents both of\nguaranteeing  the  commission  of  widespread  constitutional\nviolations.\nId. at *38.  For evidence that the NYPD’s training misconstrues the Fourth\nAmendment, see id. at *35–39.  Ligon also shows, however, that determining\nwhether a practice of suspicionless police encounters has actually resulted in\nsuspicionless Terry stops is a fact-intensive inquiry.  See, e.g., id. at *10–19,\n*28–30 (factual analyses of individual plaintiffs’ stops).\n94 See City Opp. (Policy) at 1, 3–6, 9.\n95 See Pl. Mem. (Policy) at 1–2; Pl. Reply (Policy) at 2–3.\n96 I note that plaintiffs may succeed at trial on an as-applied challenge to\nthe stop policy in IO 23 even though they are not entitled to summary judgment on\ntheir facial challenge.  This is so because the stop policy directs officers to engage\nin behavior that is constitutional (that is, suspicionless encounters that a reasonable\nperson would feel free to terminate), but is ambiguous as to whether it directs\nofficers to engage in additional, unconstitutional behavior (that is, suspicionless\nTerry stops).  A facial challenge to the policy must fail because the policy may be\ninterpreted, in practice, as directing only the former, constitutional behavior.  But\nif evidence shows — again, in practice — that officers interpret the ambiguous\naspect of the policy as directing them to engage in unconstitutional behavior, and\nas a result they do so, then the policy would be at least partially unconstitutional.\n34\n\nthese factors as justifications to approach and question a person.97  As a result, it\nappears that NYPD officers have complete discretion under IO 23 to approach and\nquestion anyone in a NYCHA building.  This discretion, however, is not\nproblematic if the NYPD officers approach and question individuals in ways that\ndo not implicate their Fourth Amendment (or other constitutional) rights.  But\nwhether this is the case, again, cannot be determined from the face of IO 23 and its\nassociated training materials.\nFor the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment\non the unconstitutionality of IO 23’s stop policy is denied.\nb.  The City’s Motion\nThe City moves for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ claim that the\nNYPD has a policy of making unconstitutional stops or arrests for trespass on\nNYCHA property.98  Based on the analysis above, the City’s motion is rejected\nwith regard to the stop policy in IO 23 and its associated training materials.  A\nreasonable juror could conclude that the NYPD’s policy for trespass enforcement\n97 See IO 23; Pl. Reply (Policy) at 4–5 (arguing that IO 23 stop policy\n“fails to establish appropriate limits on officers’ discretion”).  Accord NYCHA\nRules & Regulation Training PowerPoints, Bates Nos.

U\nto Cooke Decl., at NYC0022020 (offering no criteria for determining when a\nperson’s right to be in the building is in question).\n98 See City Mem. at 2.\n35\n\nin NYCHA buildings is to conduct both constitutionally permissible non-coercive\nquestioning and constitutionally impermissible suspicionless Terry stops.  Such a\npolicy could form the basis for Monell liability whether it was implemented with\nthe intent to violate the Constitution, or merely out of ignorance of the\nConstitution’s requirements.99\nThe City’s motion for summary judgment is also denied with regard\nto the NYPD’s trespass arrest policies in NYCHA buildings.  While plaintiffs lack\nstanding to challenge the constitutionality of the conjectural type of trespass arrest\ndescribed above — that is, an arrest based solely on refusing to answer questions\nand refusing to leave after being requested to do so by a police officer — plaintiffs\nhave also argued that the NYPD’s trespass enforcement policy is unconstitutional\nbecause it “permits the arrest of NYCHA residents and their guests just for being\npresent in areas designated as ‘prohibited’ by NYCHA, such as roofs and roof\n99 A policy may be unconstitutional and a source of Monell liability\nunder section 1983 even if municipal policymakers believed in good faith that the\npolicy was constitutional, or even if the constitutionality of the policy was not yet\nclearly established.  See Skehan v. Village of Mamaroneck, 465 F.3d 96, 109 (2d\nCir. 2006) (“Municipalities are not entitled to qualified immunity for their actions,\neven where the individual officers who acted on the municipality’s behalf would\nbe.”), overruled on other grounds by Appel v. Spiridon, 531 F.3d 138 (2d Cir.\n2008).\n36\n\nlandings, without adequate notice.”100  Plaintiffs have standing to challenge this\ntype of arrest.  Two plaintiffs, Roman Jackson and Kristin Johnson, were arrested\nin January 2009 for trespass based on sitting at the top of a stairwell in a NYCHA\nbuilding.  Jackson was a tenant in the building at the time, and Johnson was his\nguest.  The parties dispute whether the top of the stairwell was a “roof landing,”\nwhich has been defined as a prohibited area.  The parties also dispute whether there\nwas a sign at the top of the stairwell:  plaintiffs have presented testimony that there\nwas no sign; the City has argued that there was a sign stating that “loitering and\ntrespassing in lobby, roof, hallway and stairs is not permitted.”101  \nIn Davis I, I held that the City was not entitled to summary judgment\non Jackson’s and Johnson’s Fourth Amendment claims based on the circumstances\nof their arrest, because a reasonable juror could find that their arrest lacked\nprobable cause.102  I did not reach the issue of Monell liability.  In order to survive\nthe City’s motion for summary judgment on Monell liability regarding IO 23’s\narrest policy, plaintiffs must show not only that a reasonable juror could conclude\nthat Jackson’s and Johnson’s arrest lacked probable cause, but that Jackson’s and\n100 1/7/13 Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants’\nMotions for Partial Summary Judgment (“Pl. Opp.”) at 3.\n101 Davis I, 2012 WL 4813837, at *8.\n102 See id. at *8–10. \n37\n\nJohnson’s constitutional injuries resulted from a municipal policy.103\nPlaintiffs have offered sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact as to whether the NYPD has a policy of arresting the residents of\nNYCHA buildings for trespass in areas that lack the requisite “conspicuously\nposted rules or regulations” defining them as prohibited areas.104  There is also\n103 See Cash, 654 F.3d at 333.  I note that in Davis I, I assumed based on\nthe parties’ briefing that Jackson and Johnson had been arrested for loitering in the\nstairway, in violation of the prohibition on such loitering contained in the sign that\nthe City alleges was conspicuously posted at the top of the stairway.  See Davis I,\n2012 WL 4813837, at *8–10.  Proceeding from this assumption, I analyzed the\nconstitutionality of applying the sign’s loitering prohibition to a resident and\nconcluded that the prohibition was unconstitutionally vague and thus could not\nprovide a basis for probable cause or punishment.  See id.  \nIt now appears that there is uncertainty regarding why Jackson and\nJohnson were arrested.  The City argues that Jackson and Johnson “fit the\ncircumstances” of someone who has been arrested for “being in a prohibited area,”\nand not for loitering.  1/18/13 Defendant City of New York’s Reply Memorandum\nof Law in Further Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs’\nClaims Against the City (“City Reply”) at 1 n.2.  If Jackson and Johnson were\narrested not for violating a prohibition on loitering but for violating a prohibition\non trespassing in prohibited spaces, my earlier discussion of the vagueness of the\nloitering prohibition may no longer be material to the analysis of named plaintiffs’\nindividual circumstances.\n104 See, e.g., Pl.

See, e.g., People v. Quinones, No. 01-371, 2002 WL\n432917, at *1 (1st Dep’t Mar. 5, 2002); People v. Delossantos, 924 N.Y.S.2d 258,\n260 (Crim. Ct. N.Y.

Plaintiffs’ Claim of an Unconstitutional Custom and\nPractice\nThe preceding sections addressed the parties’ motions for summary\njudgment on plaintiffs’ claim that the City bears Monell liability for its express\ntrespass enforcement policies in NYCHA buildings.  I now turn to plaintiffs’ claim\nthat the City bears Monell liability for its trespass enforcement practices in\nNYCHA buildings.  Plaintiffs argue (1) that the City’s unconstitutional trespass\nenforcement practices are sufficiently widespread to serve as a basis for Monell\nliability, either based on a theory of constructive acquiescence, or based on actual\nacquiescence;108 and (2) that the City has displayed deliberate indifference to the\n107 The City also argues that even if Jackson’s and Johnson’s arrest was\nunconstitutional, plaintiffs have failed to provide evidence of a pattern of arrests\nlike theirs, which the City argues would be necessary to show that the City’s policy\nis unconstitutional.  See City Reply at 1 n.2 (citing Connick, 131 S. Ct. at\n1360–61).  In Connick, the Supreme Court stated:  “A pattern of similar\nconstitutional violations by untrained employees is ‘ordinarily necessary’ to\ndemonstrate deliberate indifference for purposes of failure to train.”  131 S. Ct. at\n1360 (quoting Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 409).  This rule has no bearing on the\ncurrent discussion, which addresses plaintiffs’ policy theory of Monell liability, not\nits deliberate indifference theory.  “[O]nce a municipal policy is established, ‘it\nrequires only one application . . . to satisfy fully Monell’s requirement that a\nmunicipal corporation be held liable only for constitutional violations resulting\nfrom the municipality’s official policy.’”  Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 478 n.6 (quoting\nTuttle, 471 U.S. at 822).\n108 See Pl. Opp. at 4 & n.8.  The City contends that plaintiffs waived\nsome or all of their “custom” theory of Monell liability by not including the phrase\n41\n\nconstitutional rights of NYCHA residents and guests based on its failure “to\nsupervise, discipline, and train its police officers to ensure lawful trespass\nenforcement, despite an obvious need to do so.”109  The former argument focuses\non the City’s widespread practices, while the latter argument focuses on the City’s\ndeliberate indifference.\nAs an initial matter, the implementation of IO 23 and its associated\ntraining after the commencement of this litigation creates complications regarding\nthe temporal scope of plaintiffs’ claim.  Some of plaintiffs’ evidence of unlawful\nstops and arrests predates IO 23, while other evidence postdates the policy.  In the\nLigon preliminary injunction hearing, I addressed a similar issue involving the\neven more recent implementation of new policies and training.  In that case, I\nconducted a two-stage analysis.  First, I analyzed plaintiffs’ evidence of deliberate\n“constructive acquiescence” in their Amended Complaint.  See City Mem. at 2 n.5. \nHowever, plaintiffs clearly pleaded both policy-based and custom-based Monell\nclaims, and the parties have argued these claims throughout the years of litigation. \nSee, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶¶ 238–242; Davis v. City of New York, 812 F. Supp. 2d\n333, 341 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).  The City has cited no basis for concluding that the term\n“constructive acquiescence” must be recited in every custom-based claim of\nMonell liability based on the prevalence of unconstitutional practices.  As noted\nabove, if a municipality engages in sufficiently persistent and widespread\nunconstitutional practices, Monell liability will attach, even in the absence of direct\nevidence of acquiescence by policymakers.  See Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1359 (citing\nAdickes, 398 U.S. at 167); Canton, 489 U.S. at 390 n.10; Ligon, 2013 WL 628534,\nat *4 n.32 (discussing Jones, 691 F.3d at 82).\n109 Pl. Opp. at 9.\n42\n\nindifference arising prior to the new policies and training.  Second, I analyzed\nwhether defendants had rebutted plaintiffs’ evidence of deliberate indifference\nbased on the recent steps taken by the NYPD.110\nA two-stage analysis may also be appropriate here.  I reserve decision\non that issue, however, because plaintiffs have raised a genuine issue of material\nfact as to whether IO 23 and its associated training significantly altered the\nNYPD’s trespass enforcement practices in NYCHA buildings.111  Drawing all\nreasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs, as I must, I assume in the following\ndiscussion that IO 23 and its associated training materials did not significantly alter\nthe NYPD’s trespass enforcement practices.  As a result, evidence of\nunconstitutional practices before the implementation of IO 23 remains relevant to\ndetermining whether the NYPD continues to engage in unconstitutional practices.\n110 See Ligon, 2013 WL 628534, at *28.\n111 See Pl. Opp. at 7 & n.15, 9 (noting that NYCHA residents and guests\ntestified to unlawful stops and arrests after the introduction of IO 23, that two\nnamed plaintiffs raised genuine issues of material fact regarding post-IO 23\nunlawful stops, and that one did so regarding a post-IO 23 unlawful arrest).  More\nthan one officer testified that IO 23 did not change either the NYPD’s stop policy\nor trespass enforcement practices in general.  See, e.g., Excerpts from 11/29/11\nDeposition of Police Officer Keith Devine, Ex. 5 to Lee Decl., at 192–193.  In\naddition, plaintiffs offer evidence that more than two years after the introduction of\nIO 23, the Bronx District Attorney’s Office announced a policy that was intended\nin part to address the problem of NYCHA “‘tenants and invited guests . . . being\nprosecuted unlawfully’” for trespass.  Pl. Opp. at 9 (quoting PAF ¶ 42).\n43\n\na.  Widespread Practice\ni. Documentary and Testimonial Evidence\nPlaintiffs offer various forms of documentary and testimonial\nevidence supporting the conclusion that the City has a persistent and widespread\npractice of performing unconstitutional trespass stops and arrests in NYCHA\nbuildings.  In addition to the testimony of named plaintiffs discussed in Davis I,\nplaintiffs’ evidence includes the following: \n(1) According to plaintiffs, the City’s Civilian Complaint Review\nBoard (“CCRB”) became concerned about complaints that officers were stopping\npeople without reasonable suspicion in and around NYCHA buildings.  In many\ncases, the officers stated that they could stop anyone inside a NYCHA building. \nThe CCRB conducted a study that revealed substantiated complaints regarding\nsuspicionless stops in and around NYCHA and TAP buildings at a thirty-two\npercent rate, nearly three times the substantiation rate for similar complaints in\nother locations.112  \nThe City does not meaningfully contest these allegations in its brief.113 \nRather, the City argues that the CCRB study predates the implementation of IO 23\n112 See Pl. Opp. at 6–7.  For convenience, I cite the parties’ briefs, which\nin turn cite evidence in the record.\n113 See City Reply at 2–3.\n44\n\nand its associated training materials, and thus can no longer provide evidence of\nthe City’s practices.  As I noted above, however, there is at minimum a genuine\nissue of material fact as to whether IO 23 significantly changed the City’s\npractices.114\n(2) A sample of decline to prosecute forms from various District\nAttorney’s offices provides further evidence of NYPD officers stopping\nindividuals merely for exiting a NYCHA building.115  According to plaintiffs’\nanalysis, “[o]f the 64 DP Forms for trespass arrests on NYCHA Property, 24 DP\nForms indicate that the ‘individual was observed exiting a New York City Housing\nAuthority building.  Based on this information, the individual was stopped and\nquestioned.’”116\nThe City argues that these forms are inadmissible hearsay.117  “The\nFederal Rules of Evidence define hearsay as a declarant’s out-of-court statement\n114 See Pl. Opp. at 7–9 & n.15.\n115 See id. at 7.\n116 1/7/13 Declaration of Katharine E.G. Brooker, counsel for plaintiffs\n(“Brooker Decl.”), at ¶ 9 (quoting and citing, as an example, the Decline to\nProsecute form at Ex. A to Brooker Decl.).\n117 See City Reply at 3.\n45\n\n‘offer[ed] in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.’”118 \nThe decline to prosecute forms, which contain written assertions by out-of-court\ndeclarants and are offered in evidence to prove the truth of those assertions, are\nhearsay, but may be admissible under one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.  \nBecause the City’s hearsay argument is made in its reply brief,\nplaintiffs have not yet had an opportunity to respond.  In Ligon, I allowed the\nadmission of decline to prosecute forms describing stops outside TAP buildings, as\nrebuttable evidence of the basis for the stops.119  Unlike in this case, however, the\nCity had conceded the admissibility of the records for that limited purpose.120\nBased on the record at this stage, I am inclined to allow the admission\nof the decline to prosecute forms in this case as well, based either on the public\nrecords exception under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(A)(iii),121 or on the\n118 United States v. Dupree, 706 F.3d 131, 136 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting\nFed. R. Evid. 801(c)).\n119 See Ligon, 2013 WL 628534, at *7–8.\n120 See id.\n121 “The following are not excluded by the rule against hearsay,\nregardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness: . . .

(iii) in a\ncivil case . . ., factual findings from a legally authorized investigation; and (B)\nneither the source of information nor other circumstances indicate a lack of\ntrustworthiness.”  Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)(A)(iii).\n46\n\nresidual hearsay exception under Rule 807.122  But I reserve any final decision until\nthe parties have had an opportunity to make further arguments specifically\naddressing the issue of whether the decline to prosecute forms are inadmissible\nhearsay.123  In any case, the admission or exclusion of the decline to prosecute\nforms is not dispositive of any issue at the summary judgment stage.\n(3) According to plaintiffs, the testimony of officers, as well as\n122 Rule 807 states:\n(a) In General.  Under the following circumstances, a hearsay\nstatement is not excluded by the rule against hearsay even if the\nstatement is not specifically covered by a hearsay exception in\nRule 803 or 804:\n(1)  the  statement  has  equivalent  circumstantial  guarantees  of\ntrustworthiness;\n(2) it is offered as evidence of a material fact;\n(3) it is more probative on the point for which it is\noffered than any other evidence that the proponent\ncan obtain through reasonable efforts; and\n(4) admitting it will best serve the purposes of these\nrules and the interests of justice.\n123 In support of the City’s argument that decline to prosecute forms\ncannot be relied on to infer that a stop lacked reasonable suspicion or that an arrest\nwas made without probable cause, the City cites an unreported three-page 2003\nopinion from the Eastern District, which quite correctly concluded that a\nprosecutor’s decision not to prosecute a charge against a section 1983 plaintiff\n“provides no indication that plaintiff’s arrest was without probable cause.”  Quinn\nv.

To say that the decision to decline to prosecute is\ninsufficient to support a section 1983 claim for false arrest is quite different from\nsaying that the information contained in decline to prosecute forms is irrelevant to\nan analysis of police practices.\n47\n\nNYCHA residents and guests, further corroborates the existence of an\nunconstitutional practice of stops and arrests in and around NYCHA buildings.124 \nPlaintiffs have offered abundant testimony regarding residents and guests, young\nand old, male and female, being stopped and arrested without basis in and around\nNYCHA buildings.125\nii.

Plaintiffs have\n134 Dr. Fagan assumes that the narrative “loitering” does not indicate\napparent justification for a trespass stop in a NYCHA building.  See PAF ¶ 9;\nFagan Report at 86 tbl. 27.  I note that neither my prior opinions in Floyd nor\nDavis I addressed the difficult question of whether, on a UF-250 form recording a\ntrespass stop in a NYCHA building, the narrative “loitering” could indicate that an\nofficer apparently had reasonable suspicion.  Even if “loitering” outdoors in a\npublic space most likely does not provide reasonable suspicion of any crime, see\nFloyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 299, and a general criminal prohibition on “loitering” by\na resident in her own NYCHA building is unconstitutionally vague, see Davis I,\n2012 WL 4813837, at *8–10, behavior that could reasonably be described as\n“loitering” in a NYCHA building could conceivably provide a sufficient basis for a\nTerry stop during a vertical patrol.  NYCHA buildings are the homes of NYCHA\nresidents, not public streets for “‘carefree . . . fellow[s]’” to use as they “walk or\nloaf or loiter or stroll,” to borrow some of Justice William O. Douglas’ celebrated\nlanguage from Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 171 (1972)\n(extolling public idleness and other “amenities of life,” and quoting Anthony\nAmsterdam, Federal Constitutional Restrictions on the Punishment of Crimes of\nStatus, Crimes of General Obnoxiousness, Crimes of Displeasing Police Officers,\nand the Like, 3 CRIM.

Dr. Fagan’s study attempts to quantify the magnitude of such\nstops and arrests.  It is hard to see what connection the City finds lacking: based on\nplaintiffs’ evidence, a reasonable juror could find that the constitutional injuries\nsuffered by named plaintiffs are the same injuries quantified by Dr. Fagan’s report\nand further supported by the other documentary and testimonial evidence discussed\nabove.137\nThe City also reiterates its longstanding arguments against the use of\n137 The City also attempts to analogize the instant case to Connick, where\nthe Supreme Court determined that a district attorney’s office may not be “held\nliable under § 1983 for failure to train based on a single Brady violation.” \nConnick, 131 S. Ct. at 1356.  See City Mem. at 3 (citing Connick, 131 S. Ct. at\n1360).  In Connick, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff did “not contend that\nhe proved a pattern of similar Brady violations,” and that the four other Brady\nviolations noted by the plaintiff were “not similar to the violation at issue” and thus\n“could not have put [the municipality] on notice that specific training was\nnecessary to avoid this constitutional violation.”  Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1360.\nThe City’s reliance on Connick is puzzling.  Connick delimits the\nperiphery of custom-based municipal liability under section 1983, in order to\nprevent Monell from becoming a back door to respondeat superior liability for\naberrant constitutional torts by rogue municipal employees.  See Connick, 131 S.\nCt. at 1365 & n.12.  That risk is not remotely present in the current case.  While\nConnick involved an individual plaintiff’s claim regarding a single Brady violation,\nthe instant case is a putative class action based on evidence of tens of thousands of\nsimilar Fourth Amendment violations over a number of years, during which the\nalleged violations were the subject of frequent and intense public dispute.  The\nallegations in this case lie close to the core of custom-based Monell liability, not at\nthe periphery like the claim in Connick.\n51\n\nUF-250 data as evidence of the rough magnitude of unconstitutional stops and\narrests.138  I have repeatedly emphasized that it would be inappropriate to rely on a\nUF-250 form alone to definitively determine the legality or illegality of an\nindividual stop.139  But given the unfeasibility of taking live testimony regarding a\nsufficient sample of the stops and arrests in this case, “it would be an injustice to\nprevent the jury from hearing about the extremely rich and informative material”\ncontained in the UF-250 database.140  The City cites three cases where courts have\nexpressed skepticism regarding the use of statistics in drawing conclusions\nregarding the constitutionality of criminal justice practices.141  All three cases,\nhowever, involved equal protection claims where plaintiffs attempted to prove\ndiscriminatory intent through statistics indicating disparate impact.142  None of\nthese cases address the validity of relying on statistical evidence to estimate the\nmagnitude of an ostensible practice involving stops and arrests in violation of the\n138 See City Mem. at 3–5.\n139 See, e.g., Floyd, 861 F.

This dictum, however, appeared in the context of a defense of the\nprobative value of statistics regarding arrest rates.  The Tenth Circuit concluded\nthat the plaintiff’s failure to include statistical data regarding probable cause was\nnot fatal to the plaintiff’s use of arrest rate statistics, because there was no feasible\nway for the plaintiff to provide statistical evidence of probable cause.  See id. \nPresumably if the plaintiff or the defendants had succeeded in offering reliable\nstatistical evidence regarding probable cause, the Tenth Circuit would have\nconsidered this evidence just as it considered the statistical evidence that was\nintroduced.\n144 Even in the distinct and highly sensitive context of equal protection\nclaims, the Supreme Court “has accepted statistics as proof of intent to\ndiscriminate in certain limited contexts.”  McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 293.\n145 See, e.g., City Mem. at 3–5, 3 n.7; City Reply at 2.  The City is\nincorrect to suggest that there is an inconsistency between Dr. Fagan’s analysis of\nthe text strings offered as “Other” stop justifications and my conclusion in Floyd\nthat it would mislead the jury to admit “expert testimony that makes\ngeneralizations about the level of reasonable suspicion indicated by the forms [that\ncontain only an ‘Other’ factor on Side 1].”  Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 299–300. \nThis statement appeared in the context of my rejection of Dr. Fagan’s initial\nconclusion “that all . . . of the UF-250s on which the only box checked on Side 1 is\n‘Other’ are ‘Indeterminate.’”  Id. at 296.  I continue to hold that it would mislead\nthe jury if experts were to testify about the general character of the forms that\n53\n\nissues that argue in favor of, rather than against, submitting the case to a jury.146 \nWhether Dr. Fagan’s conclusions are persuasive is a mixed question of fact and\nlaw for the jury, not a question susceptible to legal resolution by this Court.147\nIn sum, based on plaintiffs’ documentary and testimonial evidence, as\nwell as Dr. Fagan’s opinions, a reasonable juror could conclude that the City has\ncontain only an “Other” factor on Side 1 — for example, by describing these forms\nas “Indeterminate,” “Presumptively Justified,” “Apparently Unjustified,” or under\nany other general label.  But the Daubert decision in Floyd did not prohibit expert\ntestimony based on a closer inspection of the “Other” text strings.  To the contrary,\nI stated that “one can make certain determinations” regarding “a particular UF-\n250” containing “Other” text strings “with the same or more confidence” as one\ncan make such determinations regarding other UF-250s.  Id.  Accord Fagan\nRebuttal at 31 n.71.  In Ligon, I relied in part on the analysis of “Other” text\nstrings, see Ligon, 2013 WL 628534, at *31–34, and Dr. Fagan’s text string\nanalysis is no less relevant in Davis.  Finally, to the extent that the City’s argument\nrests on the quality of Dr. Fagan’s sampling of text strings and inferences based on\nthem, see City Reply at 4, the City’s arguments have not yet shown in what sense\nDr. Fagan’s methods depart from reliable, garden-variety random sampling and\nstatistical inference.  Such proof may be developed at trial.\n146 See, e.g., City Mem. at 4; City Reply at 2 n.4.  Even if there were\nmerit to some of the City’s criticisms of Dr. Fagan’s analysis, it would be\ninappropriate to grant summary judgment to the City on the basis of such\narguments, because the magnitude of unconstitutional stops identified by Dr.\nFagan leaves significant room for error.  Cf. Ligon, 2013 WL 628534, at *33–34\n(accepting for the sake of argument that some of the City’s criticisms might have\nmerit, but noting that even then, “plaintiffs have succeeded in showing a clear\nlikelihood that they will be able to prove that the City of New York and its agents\ndisplayed deliberate indifference toward the violation of the constitutional rights of\nhundreds and more likely thousands of individuals”).\n147 See Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 287, 300. \n54\n\nengaged in a practice of making unconstitutional stops and arrests in and around\nNYCHA buildings as part of its trespass enforcement practices, and that this\npractice is sufficiently persistent and widespread to serve as a basis for Monell\nliability.  Plaintiffs have raised genuine issues of material fact regarding their\nwidespread practice claim.  Thus, the City’s motion for partial summary judgment\non this claim is denied.\nb. Deliberate Indifference \nIf a jury were to find either that the City has a policy of making\nunconstitutional stops and arrests in NYCHA buildings, or that the City has a\nsufficiently persistent and widespread practice of making such stops and arrests to\nestablish Monell liability, it would be unnecessary to reach the issue of deliberate\nindifference.  At the same time, in turning to this issue, I must draw all reasonable\ninferences in favor of plaintiffs.  As a result, I will assume in the following\nanalysis, as I did earlier, that a reasonable juror could conclude that IO 23 and its\nassociated training materials represent an unconstitutional trespass enforcement\npolicy, and that the widespread practice of making unconstitutional trespass stops\nand arrests in NYCHA buildings both preceded and followed the introduction of\nIO 23.  The only questions remaining under the deliberate indifference analysis\nwould be (1) whether the City had sufficient notice of the unconstitutionality of its\n55\n\npractices, either constructively through the obviousness of the unconstitutionality,\nor based on actual notice,148 and (2) whether the City failed “‘to make meaningful\nefforts to address the risk of harm to plaintiffs.’”149\n148 See Cash, 654 F.3d at 334.  On the issue of notice, the City is\nincorrect to suggest that plaintiffs must show the City “had notice that a particular\ntraining or other supervisory flaw was obviously causing such violations.”  City\nMem. at 5.  Actual notice that a training program is causing constitutional\nviolations is sufficient:  such notice by itself makes the need for more or different\ntraining obvious.  It is only in the absence of actual notice that the deficiencies of a\ntraining program must be “obvious” in order to satisfy the requirements of Monell\nliability.  See Cash, 654 F.3d at 334 (noting that “deliberate indifference requires\nproof that [a] ‘municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his\naction’” (quoting Brown, 520 U.S. at 407) (emphasis added)).\nThe City is also incorrect to suggest that plaintiffs have not identified\nthe inadequacies in the City’s training with sufficient specificity.  See City Mem. at\n5 (citing Reynolds, 506 F.3d at 193).  As discussed in the following paragraphs,\nplaintiffs have offered abundant evidence that adequate training, supervision, and\ndiscipline of officers who engage in vertical patrols in NYCHA buildings could\nhave prevented the constitutional harms allegedly suffered by plaintiffs, but that\nthe City chose not to provide that training.  It would also be incorrect to suggest\nthat plaintiffs must point to one or more particular elements of the NYPD’s\ntraining program that specifically cause officers to perform unconstitutional stops\nor arrests.  Deliberate indifference does not require that officers be trained to\ncommit constitutional violations.  Rather, “where ‘the need for more or better\nsupervision to protect against constitutional violations [is] obvious,’” Cash, 654\nF.3d at 334 (quoting Vann, 72 F.3d at 1049), mere failure to “‘make meaningful\nefforts to address the risk of harm to plaintiffs,’” Cash, 654 F.3d at 334 (quoting\nReynolds, 506 F.3d at 192), is enough.  If a “‘city’s policy of inaction in light of\nnotice that its program will cause constitutional violations is the functional\nequivalent of a decision by the city itself to violate the Constitution,’” Cash, 654\nF.3d at 334 (quoting Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1360), then a fortiori a city’s policy of\ninaction in light of notice that its program has caused, continues to cause, and will\ncause widespread constitutional violations is sufficient to establish Monell liability.\n149 Cash, 654 F.3d at 334 (quoting Reynolds, 506 F.3d at 192).\n56\n\nDrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs, both questions\nraise triable issues of fact.  With regard to notice, a reasonable juror could find that\nthe NYPD had actual notice from numerous sources of a widespread pattern of\nunconstitutional trespass stops and arrests in NYCHA buildings of precisely the\nkind that plaintiffs allege in this case.  Not only did the City receive notice of the\nunconstitutionality of its practices through individual CCRB reports and the CCRB\nstudy noted above, but plaintiffs have offered evidence that “NYCHA residents\nand tenant leaders have, for years, publicly complained about the City’s unlawful\npractices in NYCHA residences.”150  Plaintiffs also cite the abundant media\ncoverage over several years of alleged unconstitutional trespass enforcement\npractices at NYCHA buildings.151  Indeed, based on this and other evidence,152 it is\nquestionable whether any reasonable juror could find the City failed to receive\nactual notice of the alleged constitutional infirmities at issue in this case.\nWith regard to whether the City took meaningful efforts to address the\nrisk of harm, plaintiffs bear a heavy burden in establishing the inadequacy of the\n150 Pl. Opp. at 10 n.21 (citing PAF ¶¶ 25–30). \n151 See id.\n152 See generally id. at 9–10.\n57\n\nNYPD’s supervision, discipline, and training of its officers.153  For the purposes of\nsurviving summary judgment, however, plaintiffs have cited sufficient evidence to\nraise a genuine issue of material fact on this point.  For nearly every laudatory-\nsounding supervisory, disciplinary, or training procedure cited by the City in its\nbrief, plaintiffs cite evidence that the procedure does not operate as described, is\nineffective, or fails to address the allegedly unconstitutional practices at issue in\nthis case.154\nPlaintiffs do not dispute that in recent years the City has made various\npolicy and training changes that relate to stops and arrests in NYCHA buildings. \nThe City developed IO 23 and its associated training materials, revised other\n153 “A municipality’s culpability for a deprivation of rights is at its most\ntenuous where a claim turns on a failure to train.”  Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1359\n(citing Tuttle, 471 U.S. at 822–23).\n154 Compare, e.g., City Mem. at 7 (citing evidence that Integrity Control\nOfficers (“ICOs”) ensure that officers follow rules and policies), and id. (citing\nevidence that supervisors verify arrests at the scene and review paperwork to\nensure proper officer performance), with, e.g., Pl. Opp. at 11–12 (citing evidence\nthat no supervising officer deposed in this case testified to having ever observed a\nstop that lacked reasonable suspicion or an arrest that lacked probable cause), and\nid. at 11–12 (citing evidence that ICOs do not behave as the City describes). \nSimilar disputes of fact regarding training, monitoring, supervising, and\ndisciplining appeared in the Floyd summary judgment briefing, with a similar\nresult.  See Floyd, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 429–35 (detailing a sample of the “numerous\ndisputed issues of fact as to the constitutional sufficiency of the NYPD’s practice\nof training, monitoring, supervising, and disciplining its officers for stops and\nfrisks conducted in violation of the Fourth Amendment” (footnote omitted)).\n58\n\ntraining materials and procedures, and in 2012 implemented a refresher course at\nRodman’s Neck on Stop, Question and Frisk in general.155  However, for many of\nthe same reasons that IO 23 and its associated training materials may constitute\nunconstitutional policies, as discussed above,156 plaintiffs have at minimum raised\na genuine issue of material fact as to whether the City’s response to its alleged\nnotice of unconstitutional stops and arrests was sufficient to avoid Monell\nliability.157  I also note that some of the training materials at issue in this case are\nthe same as those I criticized in the Ligon preliminary injunction opinion.158\n155 See City Mem. at 5–7.\n156 See supra Part V.A.1.\n157 See also Pl. Opp. at 15–16.  Plaintiffs criticize the City’s production\nof “instructional materials relating to the 2012 . . . training at Rodman’s Neck and\nthe 2012 training on NYCHA rules and regulations,” which “were produced only\nin response to Plaintiffs’ demand on October 23, 2012, after learning about their\nexistence while observing the Ligon preliminary injunction hearing.”  Id. at 15\nn.26.  I accept the City’s representation that the latter training was not finalized\nuntil October and was produced on November 20, 2012.  See City Reply at 1 n.1. \nWhile the City’s failure to produce the Rodman’s Neck instructional materials until\nafter they had already appeared in the Ligon hearing is troubling, it is not\nsufficiently problematic to justify granting plaintiffs’ request to preclude the City\nfrom relying on these materials in its summary judgment motion.  See Pl. Opp. at\n15 n.26.\n158 See Ligon, 2013 WL 628534, at *35–39.  I note with concern that the\nCity’s briefs point to evidence of training on the four levels of De Bour, see City\nMem. at 6, but make no reference to training on what constitutes a stop under the\nFourth Amendment.  See Ligon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. 2274, 2013 WL\n227654, at *2 n.23 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2013) (“If [the City] accept[s] that Bostick’s\n59\n\nIn evaluating plaintiffs’ claim that the City has displayed deliberate\nindifference to a widespread practice of constitutional violations, a reasonable juror\nmight also note that the City continues to contest in this litigation whether a\nconstitutionally problematic practice of trespass stops and arrests in NYCHA\nbuildings has ever existed.159  The City is not arguing that its police officers\nengaged in constitutional violations in the past, but that the City was unaware of\nthis, and that as soon as it received notice of the violations, it altered its policies\nand training to prevent them, and therefore is not deliberately indifferent.  Rather,\nthe City argues that plaintiffs have failed to offer reliable evidence of constitutional\nviolations,160 and that any changes to policy and training in recent years have\nview of the Fourth Amendment governs the NYPD, then the NYPD should train its\nofficers in accordance with that standard.”).  I am also concerned that at least some\nof the City’s most recent training materials direct officers to complete a UF-250\nonly when they have reasonable suspicion, rather than each time they have made a\nTerry stop.  Compare Ligon, 2013 WL 628534, at *38–39 (criticizing training\nmaterials), with, e.g., 12/4/12 Declaration of Michele Irizarry, counsel to City\n(including as exhibits training materials that are similar or identical to those\ncriticized in Ligon).  The City draws attention in its briefs to the recent decline in\napparently unjustified stops, according to Dr. Fagan’s own metrics.  See, e.g., City\nMem. at 11–12, 14.  If this decline, however, is attributable to officers interpreting\nthe NYPD’s new policies as an instruction not to fill out UF-250 forms when a\nTerry stop was not based on reasonable suspicion, then the decline would not\nnecessarily show an improvement in the NYPD’s practices.\n159 See City Mem. at 2–9; City Reply at 1–4.\n160 See City Mem. at 1 n.3 (arguing that named plaintiffs’ stops and\narrests complied with constitutional standards), 3–4 (arguing that Dr. Fagan’s\n60\n\nsimply “improved the quality” of stops and arrests.161\nFinally, the City argues that plaintiffs have failed to provide evidence\nof “actual causation,” that is, evidence that “specific deficiencies in the City’s\ntraining and/or supervision program(s) actually caused their alleged constitutional\ndeprivations.”162  The City argues that plaintiffs bear the “burden of ruling out\nthose causes of the alleged [Fourth Amendment] violations that would not support\nCity liability, such as negligent program administration or officers’ negligent or\nintentional disregard of training.”163  But a reasonable juror could conclude that\nplaintiffs have adequately shown causation.  As discussed above, plaintiffs have\nprovided evidence that NYPD officers have engaged in a widespread practice of\nunconstitutional trespass stops and arrests in NYCHA buildings as a result of\nreceiving inadequate training and supervision regarding constitutional standards,\nand inadequate discipline in response to violations of those standards.  As the\nanalysis shows no pattern of constitutional violations); City Reply at 1–2 (further\narguments against Dr. Fagan’s analysis), 2 (acknowledging that CCRB study\nidentified “concerns,” but not acknowledging the validity of those concerns), 3\n(denying that decline to prosecute forms provide evidence of unlawful stops or\narrests).\n161 City Reply at 3.\n162 Id. at 4 (citing Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1358 n.5).  See also City Mem.\nat 9.  \n163 City Mem. at 9 (citing Amnesty Am., 361 F.3d at 130).  \n61\n\nSupreme Court phrased the causation issue in City of Canton v. Harris:  “Would\nthe injury have been avoided had the employee been trained under a program that\nwas not deficient in the identified respect?”164  Plaintiffs have clearly raised a\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether the unconstitutional stops and arrests in\nthis case would have been avoided had NYPD officers received adequate training,\nsupervision, and discipline relating to the constitutional standards governing\ntrespass stops and arrests in NYCHA buildings.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the City’s motion for summary judgment\non plaintiffs’ deliberate indifference claims, like the City’s motion for summary\njudgment on plaintiffs’ widespread practice claims, is denied.\nB.  Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Claims Against the City \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits\nintentional discrimination on the basis of race, not government action that has a\ndisproportionate racial impact.165  Plaintiffs argue that the City bears Monell\nliability for violations of the equal protection rights of African-American and\nLatino residents and guests of NYCHA buildings based on the City’s alleged\n164 489 U.S. at 391.  \n165 See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976).\n62\n\nracially discriminatory trespass enforcement practices.166  In order to succeed on\ntheir equal protection claims, plaintiffs must show that the City’s practices (1) have\nan “‘adverse effect’” on African-American and Latino residents and guests in\nNYCHA buildings,167 and (2) that the practices were “‘motivated by discriminatory\nanimus.’”168  In other words, plaintiffs must prove both disproportionate impact\nand discriminatory purpose.169  \nAs noted above, the plaintiffs who maintain Fourteenth Amendment\nclaims against the City are the remaining arrested plaintiffs, and two of the\nremaining resident plaintiffs, Evans and Littlejohn, who also happen to be arrested\nplaintiffs.  The City argues that all the resident plaintiffs conceded any equal\nprotection claim by failing to respond to the City’s arguments during the first stage\nof summary judgment briefing.170  Plaintiffs deny such a concession and argue that\n166 Plaintiffs do not argue that the City’s trespass enforcement policies\ncontain express racial classifications, nor that the City bears Monell liability based\non having a policy of carrying out NYCHA trespass enforcement in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner.  Rather, plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment claims against\nthe City are based on the City’s alleged practices.  See Pl. Opp. at 16–17.\n167 Pyke v. Cuomo, 567 F.3d 74, 76 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting Pyke v.\nCuomo, 258 F.3d 107, 110 (2d Cir. 2001)).\n168 Id.\n169 See Hayden v.

Because Jones and Suarez withdrew their claims against the\nCity, they cannot serve as representative resident plaintiffs against the City.  On the\nother hand, Evans and Littlejohn have not withdrawn their equal protection claims\nagainst the City and remain valid representatives of both the arrested and resident\nplaintiffs’ putative subclasses.  As I stated in denying the City’s motion for\nsummary judgment on Evans’ and Littlejohn’s section 1981 claims, they have both\nproffered concrete evidence showing that since their arrests, they\nfeel less free to come and go from their buildings and to have\nguests visit them.  Evans has testified that police officers referred\nto her as “nigger” when she was arrested and Littlejohn testified\nthat  his  friend  Washington  was  also  called  a  “nigger”  in\nLittlejohn’s building while he was attempting to visit Littlejohn.172\nEvans and Littlejohn were both arrested as NYCHA residents, and are both\nAfrican-American.173  They are entitled to proceed on their equal protection claims\nas representatives of both the arrested and resident plaintiffs’ putative subclasses.\nCircumstances at 14; 8/3/12 City’s Reply Memorandum of Law in Further Support\nof Its Motion for Summary Judgment Based on Plaintiffs’ Individual\nCircumstances at 7 n.22); City Reply at 4 n.8.\n171 Pl.

Compl. ¶¶ 38, 41.\n64\n\nTurning now to the Monell aspects of plaintiffs’ equal protection\nclaims:  with regard to discriminatory purpose, plaintiffs need not prove that the\n“‘challenged action rested solely on racially discriminatory purposes,’”174 or even\nthat a discriminatory purpose “was the ‘dominant’ or ‘primary’ one.”175  Rather,\nplaintiffs must prove that “a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor”\nin the City’s acts.176  That is, plaintiffs must show that the City “selected or\nreaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in\nspite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.”177  As the Second Circuit\nand the Supreme Court have explained:\nBecause discriminatory intent is rarely susceptible to direct proof,\nlitigants may make “a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial\nand direct evidence of intent as may be available.  The impact of\nthe official action — whether it bears more heavily on one race\nthan another — may provide an important starting point.”178\nThe consequences of government action are sometimes evidence of the\n174 Hayden, 594 F.3d at 163 (quoting Village of Arlington Heights v.\nMetropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265 (1977)).\n175 Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265.\n176 Id. at 265–66 (emphasis added).\n177 Hayden, 594 F.3d at 163 (quoting Personnel Adm’r of Mass. v.\nFeeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979) (citation and footnote omitted)) (certain\nquotation marks omitted).\n178 Id. (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266).\n65\n\ngovernment’s intent: “proof of discriminatory intent must necessarily usually rely\non objective factors . . . . The inquiry is practical. What a legislature or any official\nentity is ‘up to’ may be plain from the results its actions achieve, or the results they\navoid.”179  “Once it is shown that a decision was motivated at least in part by a\nracially discriminatory purpose, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the\nsame result would have been reached even without consideration of race.”180\nWith regard to disproportionate impact, plaintiffs rely primarily on\nDr. Fagan’s study.181  Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs, the\nstudy shows that the level of “law enforcement activity” — defined as the ratio of\nstops to crime complaints — is greater in NYCHA buildings than in the\nsurrounding areas.  Because there are higher concentrations of African Americans\nand Latinos in NYCHA buildings than in the surrounding areas, the presence of\ngreater law enforcement activity in the former would by itself create a racial\ndisparity.  Dr. Fagan also found that the racial disparity in enforcement activity is\n179 Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 279 n.24.  “An invidious\ndiscriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts,\nincluding the fact, if it is true, that the [practice] bears more heavily on one race\nthan another.”  Washington, 426 U.S. at 242.\n180 United States v.

Opp. at 17–18.\n66\n\ngreatest in NYCHA residences with the highest concentration of African-American\nresidents, and that the disparity in all residences is greatest for stops on suspicion\nof trespass.  Indeed, based on multivariate regression analysis, Dr. Fagan found\nthat the racial composition of NYCHA buildings is a better predictor of trespass\nenforcement disparities than any racially neutral policy-rationalizing variables,\nincluding crime, policing activity, vertical patrols, or socioeconomic conditions.182  \nThe City argues that there are non-discriminatory law enforcement\nrationales for dedicating disproportionate law enforcement resources to NYCHA\nbuildings.183  Indeed, there could be good, racially neutral reasons for dedicating\nlaw enforcement resources to certain areas out of proportion to those areas’ crime\nrates, and this could result in higher stop-to-crime ratios in those areas.  In theory,\nrace may even be correlated with some racially neutral factor that would justify\n182 See id. (citing PAF ¶¶ 18–20).  I reject the City’s unsupported\nargument that Dr. Fagan’s comparison between NYCHA buildings and the areas\nsurrounding them is not “statistically appropriate” as a matter of law, or that Dr.\nFagan has failed as a matter of law to identify a “statistically appropriate\ncomparator.”  City Mem. at 9–10 n.13; City Reply at 10.\n183 See City Mem. at 13; City Reply at 5 n.9.  The City also raises valid\npoints for a jury to consider involving the relatively small size of the difference in\nracial composition between NYCHA buildings and surrounding areas, see id. at\n10–12 n.15, the negative correlation between stop-to-crime ratios and the\nconcentration of Hispanics in NYCHA residences, see id. at 11–12, and recent\nchanges in the enforcement statistics cited by Dr. Fagan, see id. at 12.\n67\n\nincreased law enforcement activity, and for which Dr. Fagan has not controlled.184 \nBut the City has not yet proven the existence of such a factor, and in any case this\ndiscussion is more relevant to the question of discriminatory purpose than\ndisproportionate impact.  Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs, a\nreasonable juror could find based on Dr. Fagan’s study that the City’s stop\npractices and its trespass enforcement practices in NYCHA buildings\ndisproportionately impact African Americans and Latinos.\nOn the issue of discriminatory purpose, the City offers similar\narguments to those it offered in favor of its motion for summary judgment in\nFloyd.  There, I concluded that “[t]he statistical evidence in the instant case, while\nstrong enough to show a disparate impact, is not strong enough to show\ndiscriminatory purpose standing alone.  However, plaintiffs have presented other\nproof in addition to the statistical evidence — [including] the inadequacy of the\n184 Perhaps, as the City suggests in another context, the NYPD’s\ndeployment of its resources can be explained in racially neutral terms by a decision\nto focus on crime in buildings with high population density or entrenched\ncriminality.  See City Mem. at 11.  Of course, even if the City were to produce\nevidence that the correlation between law enforcement activity and racial\nconcentration disappears once population density and entrenched criminality are\ncontrolled for, the plausibility of these explanations for the NYPD’s law\nenforcement activity, as opposed to a race-based explanation, would still have to be\nweighed by a jury.\n68\n\nCity’s efforts to take remedial steps to reduce the racial disparity of stops . . . .”185  I\nalso stated:\nThis is clearly not a situation in which the City has taken no\nremedial steps.  Nonetheless, considering the statistical evidence\nin  conjunction  with  the  narrative  evidence  of  significant\nshortcomings in the ways that the City’s policies have been put\ninto practice, I find that there is a triable issue of fact  as  to\nwhether the NYPD leadership has been deliberately indifferent to\nthe need to train, monitor, supervise, and discipline its officers\nadequately  in  order  to  prevent  a  widespread  pattern  of\nsuspicionless and race-based stops.186\nAlthough plaintiffs’ evidence of discriminatory purpose in the present\ncase is more tenuous than in Floyd, I conclude that a similar analysis ultimately\napplies.  Plaintiffs’ statistical evidence of racial disparities is likely not strong\nenough to support an inference of discriminatory purpose, standing alone,187 but it\nprovides a “starting point” for an examination of “circumstantial and direct\nevidence of intent.”188  \nFirst, while there is nothing inherently problematic in the City\n185 Floyd, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 452–53.\n186 Id. at 456.\n187 See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266 (citing, as examples of rare\ncases where “a clear pattern, unexplainable on grounds other than race, emerges\nfrom the effect of the state action,” Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), and\nGomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960)).\n188 Id.\n69\n\ndedicating disproportionate resources to policing in NYCHA buildings, and indeed\nresidents may favor such an approach, the City offers no explanation of why it\nmight be desirable or how it might be non-discriminatory to dedicate greater law\nenforcement attention to NYCHA residences with greater concentrations of\nAfrican Americans.189  In the absence of any racially neutral explanation for this\ncorrelation, a reasonable juror could draw the troubling inference that the NYPD\nregards crimes by African Americans in NYCHA housing as a source of greater\nconcern than identical crimes by similarly situated non-African Americans, and\ntreats similar crime levels more aggressively when they occur in NYCHA\nbuildings containing a higher proportion of African Americans.  Dr. Fagan’s\nstatistical study thus represents a circumstantial starting point for at least a prima\nfacie finding of discriminatory intent.\nSecond, plaintiffs argue that “the City was fully aware of residents’\npublic complaints about its racially discriminatory trespass enforcement activities\nin NYCHA residences,” but failed to take adequate steps to address those\ncomplaints, leading to an inference that it intended the racially discriminatory\npractices to continue.190  None of the materials cited by plaintiffs includes evidence\n189 See Pl. Opp. at 17; PAF ¶ 18.\n190 Pl. Opp. at 19.\n70\n\nof NYHCA residents making public complaints, or complaints to the NYPD, that\nexplicitly allege racially discriminatory trespass enforcement activities.191  Other\nexhibits provided by plaintiffs, however, adequately make this showing.  For\nexample, Pearl Barkley, a fifty-seven year old African-American woman who has\nlived in NYCHA housing in East Harlem for approximately fourteen years,\ntestified that “[b]ased on my experience, young black and Latino men living in the\nJefferson Houses suffer the most from these abusive NYPD practices,” and that\n“[a]s a result of what I have seen and experienced, I attended a number of meetings\nwith NYPD officials to complain about the way in which the officers patrol\nNYCHA property, and the way they treat young people who reside in the Jefferson\n191 See id. (citing PAF ¶¶ 25–30, 83).  In fact, of these citations, the only\none that explicitly alleges racial discrimination is the following, a declaration from\na sixty-seven year old African-American woman who has been a NYCHA resident\nsince 1975 and a tenant patrol supervisor for ten years:\nI have heard many complaints about the ways in which [NYPD]\nofficers interact with people in the Smith Houses.  The NYPD\nofficers are often very rude and disrespectful to the people who\nlive in the Smith Houses, particularly young black and Latino\nmale residents.  In my opinion, officers often stop, question, and\nharass people based on what they are wearing, and not because\nthey are doing anything illegal. \n1/23/12 Declaration of Mary Baez, Tenant Patrol/Resident Watch Supervisor in\nNYCHA Smith Houses, Ex. 19 to Lee Decl., ¶ 3.  Because the declaration does not\ninclude evidence that Baez’s allegation of racial discrimination was conveyed to\nthe NYPD, it does not by itself provide evidence of notice to the City of a racially\ndiscriminatory practice by the NYPD.\n71\n\nHouses.”192  A reasonable juror drawing all inferences in favor of plaintiffs could\nfind that such testimony, alongside the factual allegations in the Davis litigation\nitself, shows that the City was on notice of possible racially discriminatory trespass\nenforcement activities in NYCHA buildings.193  A reasonable juror could also\nconclude that the City’s response to these allegations has been insufficient to\nnegate the inference of discriminatory intent.  Other than a cursory reference to IO\n23, whose relevance to the issue of racial discrimination is not explained, the City\nprovides no evidence that it has attempted to address the racially discriminatory\npractices alleged in plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, or even acknowledges their\nexistence.194\nThird, and most importantly, as plaintiffs note, the alleged racial\ndisparities in Davis “exist in the context of the NYPD’s long history of biased stop,\nquestion, and frisk activity.”195  The overlap and similarities between this litigation\nand the Floyd case, which is now on trial, provide an independently sufficient\nground for denying summary judgment on the issue of discriminatory intent.  The\n192 1/26/12 Declaration of Pearl Barkley, Resident of NYCHA Jefferson\nHouses, Ex. 13 to Lee Decl., ¶¶ 3, 8.\n193 See Am.

Opp. at 18.\n72\n\nDavis plaintiffs, following Dr. Fagan’s approach, have focused their arguments for\nthe most part on evidence of differences between law enforcement practices in and\naround NYCHA buildings and practices beyond those buildings.196  If the Floyd\nplaintiffs succeed in showing that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating\nfactor for the NYPD’s stop and frisk practices in general, however, it is possible\nthat the Davis plaintiffs could show a discriminatory purpose in part based on\nevidence of similarities and connections between the NYPD’s trespass\nenforcement program in NYCHA buildings and the stop and frisk policies outside\nof those buildings.197 \nFor the foregoing reasons, the City’s motion for summary judgment\non plaintiffs’ equal protection claims is denied.\nC.  Title VI Claims Against the City\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that “[n]o person in the\nUnited States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded\n196 See id. at 17.\n197 As an example of evidence of the City’s notice of racially\ndiscriminatory police practices involving stop and frisk generally, plaintiffs cite the\nfollowing report: OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF NEW\nYORK, CIVIL RIGHTS BUREAU, NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT’S “STOP &\nFRISK” PRACTICES: A REPORT TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK 174\n(1999) (stating that racial minorities have been subjected to more intrusive stops). \nSee Pl.

Supp. 2d at 5–6; Paralyzed Veterans, 477 U.S. at\n605–06 (“By limiting coverage to recipients, Congress imposes the obligations of\n§ 504 upon those who are in a position to accept or reject those obligations as part\nof the decision whether or not to ‘receive’ federal funds.”).\n202 See City Mem. at 16–17; MOU, Ex. B to 12/5/12 Declaration of Brian\nP. Clarke, ¶¶ 13–18; NYCHA’s Rule 56.1 Statement in Support of Its Motion for\nSummary Judgment (“NYCHA 56.1”) ¶ 31.  The MOU clearly envisions NYCHA\nand the NYPD working together to apply for federal money for the NYPD’s police\nservices in NYCHA buildings.  See, e.g., MOU ¶ 19 (“NYCHA and the City agree\nto work together in the preparation of applications for grants and subsidies under\nexisting and future federal and state programs that may provide funding for public\nhousing safety and law enforcement functions . . . .”).  This general commitment\nappears immediately after a series of specific commitments by NYCHA to seek\nfederal funding for the NYPD’s police services in NYCHA buildings, which\nNYCHA will then pay to the NYPD.  See id. ¶¶ 13–18.  The MOU also envisions\n“that the parties shall comply with all such laws and regulations in the expenditure\nof monies deriving from federal and state grant and subsidy programs.”  Id. ¶ 25.\n75\n\nthe employment of security personnel; [or] (2) reimbursement of local law\nenforcement agencies for additional security and protective services . . . .”203 \nCongress clearly intended and authorized public housing agencies to distribute\nPIHDEP funds to local law enforcement agencies, just as NYCHA agreed to\ndistribute PIHDEP funds to the NYPD under the MOU.204  Under Department of\nJustice regulations implementing Title VI, the “primary recipient” of federal\nfinancial assistance is “any recipient which is authorized or required to extend\nFederal financial assistance to another recipient.”205  Thus, under the MOU,\nNYCHA is the “primary recipient” of PIHDEP funding, and the NYPD, through\nNYCHA, is “another recipient,” no less bound by the non-discrimination\nrequirements of Title VI.  \nThe NYPD is not, like the airlines in Paralyzed Veterans that\nbenefitted from federal aid to airports for construction projects, a mere\n“beneficiary” of federal financial assistance given to a recipient of aid.206  Nor is\n203 42 U.S.C. § 11903(a)(1)–(2).\n204 See MOU ¶ 16.\n205 28 C.F.R. § 42.102g (emphasis added); id. § 42.102f (defining\n“recipient”).\n206 See Paralyzed Veterans, 477 U.S. at 607.\n76\n\nthe NYPD’s receipt of funding simply an “‘economic ripple effect[]’”207 of\nNYCHA’s use of its federal financial assistance.  Rather, through PIHDEP and\nother programs, Congress intended to subsidize police services for public housing. \nAs a law enforcement agency providing police services to public housing, the\nNYPD is an intended recipient of Congress’s subsidies.208\nSecond, the NYPD could have rejected the federal financial assistance\nenvisioned in the MOU.  The NYPD was free to avoid the burdens of non-\ndiscrimination by not entering into the MOU, and remains free to reject the federal\nfinancial assistance it receives through NYCHA.  The City’s position is quite\ndifferent from that of the airlines in Paralyzed Veterans, who never received “a\nsingle penny of the money” distributed to airport operators and therefore could not\n207 Id.

Bell, 465 U.S. 555, 572 (1984)\n(finding that a college was Congress’s intended recipient of federal money despite\nchecks being sent to individual students, who then used money to pay tuition)).\n208 Because the statutory language of PIHDEP is particularly clear in its\nauthorization of indirect financial assistance to local law enforcement, and because\nplaintiffs need only establish that the City’s police services in NYCHA are\nsupported by some federal funding, it is unnecessary to address congressional\nintent under the other sources of federal funding invoked in the MOU.  But I note\nthat a similar analysis would apply to, for example, 42 U.S.C. § 1437g(e)(1)(C)\n(authorizing public housing agencies to use federal financial assistance to pay “the\ncosts of providing adequate security for public housing residents, including\nabove-baseline police service agreements”).  See also id. § 1437g(d)(1)(I)\n(authorizing “capital expenditures to improve the security and safety of residents”);\nMOU ¶ 14 (agreeing to transfer funding from NYCHA to the NYPD under a\npredecessor of this provision).\n77\n\nrefuse it.209 \nBased on the preceding analysis, which is based on undisputed facts, I\nconclude that the City is a recipient of federal financial assistance for Title VI\npurposes.  There is, however, a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the\nCity has violated Title VI by providing police services in NYCHA buildings in a\ndiscriminatory manner.  “[T]he reach of Title VI’s protection extends no further\nthan the Fourteenth Amendment,”210 but it extends just as far.  As I stated above\nwith regard to plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment claims under section 1983, a\nreasonable juror drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs could\nconclude that the City has failed to negate the inference that a discriminatory\npurpose played a role in its police services in NYCHA buildings.  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the City’s motion for summary judgment\non plaintiffs’ Title VI claims is denied.\nD. Section 1981 Claims Against the City\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866, now codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1981\n(“section 1981”), protects the rights of all persons “to make and enforce contracts”\n209 Paralyzed Veterans, 477 U.S. at 605.\n210 United States v.

After the Supreme Court reaffirmed\na narrow construction of that provision in 1989,211 Congress passed the Civil\nRights Act of 1991, which, among other changes, added section 1981(b):\nFor  purposes  of  this  section,  the  term  “make  and  enforce\ncontracts” includes the making, performance, modification, and\ntermination  of  contracts,  and  the  enjoyment  of  all  benefits,\nprivileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\n(Emphasis added).\nSection 1981 “offers relief when racial discrimination . . . impairs an\nexisting contractual relationship, so long as the plaintiff has or would have rights\nunder the existing or proposed contractual relationship.”212  As I noted in Davis I,\nthe remaining resident plaintiffs\nare  authorized  residents  on  a  lease  (that  is,  a  contract)  with\nNYCHA.  There is no doubt that [they] have rights under the\nexisting contractual relationship.  The question is whether that\nrelationship has been impaired because of racial discrimination.213\n211 See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 171 (1989)\n(stating that section 1981 “does not apply to conduct which occurs after the\nformation of a contract and which does not interfere with the right to enforce\nestablished contract obligations”).\n212 Domino’s Pizza, Inc. v.

The City’s brief does not contest\nthat the City may be liable under section 1981 for impairing plaintiffs’ contract\nwith NYCHA based on racial discrimination.  Indeed, even if NYCHA were not a\ndefendant in this case, there is precedent for concluding that the City could be held\nliable for such interference.  See Ginx, Inc. v. Soho Alliance, 720 F.

Contrary to the\nCity’s suggestion, there is no need as a matter of law for plaintiffs to produce\nstatistical evidence regarding the proportion of NYCHA residents whose\ncontractual rights have been impaired by the City’s practices.215  Of course, the\nCity will be free to argue that plaintiffs have not provided persuasive evidence that\nthe contractual rights of the putative class of NYCHA residents have in fact been\nrelationship between Plaintiffs and someone other than Defendants does not bar a\nclaim under § 1981” (citing Sullivan v.

FHA Claims Against the City\nSection 3604(b) of the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) makes it unlawful\nto “discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or\nrental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection\ntherewith.”217  In Davis I, I concluded that the law is best understood to prohibit\npost- as well as pre-acquisition discrimination in the provision of housing-related\nservices.218  I also noted that the FHA is generally interpreted as allowing claims\nbased on disparate impact, even in the absence of evidence of discriminatory\nintent.219  Plaintiffs have now stated that they “consent to the dismissal of their\n216 See Davis I, 2012 WL 4813837, at *19.\n217 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b).\n218 See Davis I, 2012 WL 4813837 at *20.

Plaintiffs offer no defense to\nthis challenge.  See Pl. Opp. at 28 n.46 (noting that this Court did not reach the\nsection 3617 claims in Davis I, but offering no defense of the claims).  Plaintiffs’\nsection 3617 claims against the City are therefore also dismissed.\n221 Smith, 410 Fed. App’x at 406 (quoting Regional Econ. Cmty. Action\nProgram, Inc. v. City of Middletown, 294 F.3d 35, 49 (2d Cir. 2002)).  “If the\nplaintiffs make out a prima facie case, then the burden of production shifts to the\ndefendants to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for their decision.” \nMiddletown, 294 F.3d at 49 (explaining how the burden-shifting framework\nproceeds under various evidentiary showings).\n82\n\nrentals.222  \nFor the same reasons that a reasonable juror could find plaintiffs’\nevidence in support of their equal protection claim, discussed above, to be\nsufficient to show that racial animus was a significant factor in the City’s provision\nof police services in NYCHA buildings, the City’s motion for summary judgment\non the FHA claims of the remaining plaintiffs bringing these claims (Evans and\nLittlejohn) is denied.\nF. NYSC Article I Section 12 Claims Against the City\nPlaintiffs now consent to the dismissal of their equal protection claims\nunder Article I section 11 of the New York Constitution as duplicative.223  As a\nresult, plaintiffs’ only remaining claims under the New York Constitution are\nunder Article I section 12, which provides similar but in some circumstances\n222 The City also argues that plaintiffs’ claim must fail because section\n3604 “only remedies conduct that affects housing opportunities or availability.”\nCity Mem. at 15 (emphasis omitted).  As plaintiffs correctly note, this issue was\nresolved in Davis I, 2012 WL 4813837, at *20–21.  To be sure, plaintiffs’ claims\nwould be more closely bound to the FHA’s core concern with housing availability\nfor protected groups if plaintiffs had offered statistical evidence of African\nAmericans and Latinos leaving, or not entering, NYCHA housing in order to avoid\nthe City’s allegedly racially discriminatory police services there.  At the same time,\nwhere the choice may be between public housing and no housing at all, it would\nsurely be contrary to the FHA’s goals to require protected groups to opt for the\nlatter in order to demonstrate the severity of a discriminatory post-acquisition\npractice.\n223 See Pl. Opp. at 29 n.51.\n83\n\nbroader protections than the Fourth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution.224  The Court of Appeals of New York has “demonstrated its\nwillingness to adopt more protective standards” under Article I section 12 than\nthose that exist under the Fourth Amendment “when doing so best promotes\n‘predictability and precision in judicial review of search and seizure cases and the\nprotection of the individual rights of our citizens.’”225\nOn the other hand, “New York courts will only imply a private right\nof action under the state constitution where no alternative remedy is available to\nthe plaintiff.”226  In order to survive summary judgment, plaintiffs must at least\nshow that they have suffered constitutional injuries under Article I section 12 that\nare not recognized under the Fourth Amendment.  Plaintiffs have failed to do so. \nPlaintiffs argue, persuasively, that the City’s trespass enforcement practices in\nNYCHA buildings may involve both conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment,\nand conduct that does not violate the Fourth Amendment but does violate the New\n224 See Evans v. Solomon, 681 F. Supp. 2d 233, 255 (E.D.N.Y. 2010).\n225 People v. Torres, 74 N.Y.2d 224, 228 (1989) (quoting People v. P.

Hollman, however, De Bour and its progeny are\nrooted not in federal or state constitutional law, but in state common law.228\nFor the foregoing reasons, the City’s motion for summary judgment\non plaintiffs’ NYSC claims is granted.229\nG. Race Discrimination Claims Against NYCHA\nResident plaintiffs have brought race discrimination claims against\nNYCHA under a number of laws, including some of those discussed above:  Title\nVI, the FHA, section 1981, and the NYSHRL and NYCHRL.230  NYCHA argues,\n227 See Pl. Opp. at 29–30; People v. Ventura, 913 N.Y.S.2d 543, 547\n(Sup. Ct. N.Y. Co. 2010) (“To the extent that . . . in public housing the police\nroutinely engage in random, unjustified questioning — and there is evidence that\nthey do — the practice would amount to a systematic violation of De Bour.” (citing\nAdam Carlis, The Illegality of Vertical Patrols, 109 COLUM. L.REV. 2002 (2009)).\n228 See Hollman, 79 N.Y.2d at 195–96 (affirming De Bour “as a matter of\nState common law”).\n229 Because I conclude that plaintiffs have failed to show how section\n1983 does not provide an adequate alternative remedy for their NYSC claims, I do\nnot reach the City’s argument that plaintiffs’ claims are barred under the New York\nState law doctrine of “governmental immunity.”  See City Mem. at 19–20 (citing\nLynch ex rel. Lynch v. City of Mount Vernon, 567 F. Supp. 2d 459, 470 (S.D.N.Y.\n2008)).\n230 See Pl. Opp. at 20.  Plaintiffs do not dispute that all of their claims\nagainst NYCHA under these laws depend, at minimum, on a showing that NYCHA\nengaged in race discrimination, either directly through its own acts or indirectly\nthrough its relationship with the City.  Compare Memorandum of Law of\n85\n\nand plaintiffs do not contest, that plaintiffs must show a racially discriminatory\npurpose in order to succeed on their Title VI, section 1981, and NYSHRL and\nNYCHRL claims.231  In addition, because plaintiffs have now abandoned their\ndisparate impact claims against both the City and NYCHA under the FHA,232\nplaintiffs must also show intentional discrimination in order to succeed on their\nFHA claims.  Thus, all of plaintiffs’ race-discrimination claims against NYCHA\nrequire that plaintiffs show NYCHA engaged in intentional racial discrimination.\nPlaintiffs’ brief in opposition to NYCHA’s motion for summary\njudgment on the race-discrimination claims is remarkably lacking in legal\nargument.  Plaintiffs criticize NYCHA for having failed to provide safe and secure\npremises to its residents, and for empowering NYPD officers to act “with\nunfettered discretion” as NYCHA’s agents despite NYCHA’s alleged knowledge\nthat the NYPD’s stop and arrest practices are racially discriminatory.233  Plaintiffs\ndo not explain, however, how this proves intentional race discrimination.234\nDefendant New York City [Housing] Authority in Support of Its Motion for\nSummary Judgment (“NYCHA Mem.”) at 9, with Pl. Opp. at 20.\n231 See NYCHA Mem. at 9–10 (collecting cases).  \n232 See Pl. Opp. at 28 n.48.\n233 Id. at 20.\n234 Plaintiffs’ only legal citations are to two cases involving state and\nmunicipal liability under section 1983 for equal protection violations.  See id. at\n86\n\nEven if plaintiffs are able to prove that NYCHA has failed to provide\nsafe and secure premises to its residents, the fact that “over 90% of the affected\nresident community is African American or Latino”235 would not, by itself, convert\nNYCHA’s failure into a form of intentional race discrimination.  According to\nplaintiffs’ logic, nearly any shortcoming by NYCHA would provide evidence of\nracial bias — because NYHCA knows that nine out of ten of the people who will\nbe affected by the shortcoming are African Americans and Latinos.  This cannot be\ncorrect.  Yet plaintiffs provide no other argument in support of their claim that\nNYCHA discriminates based on race through failing to provide adequate safety\nand security.236\nPlaintiffs have also failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to\nwhether NYCHA displayed racial bias by empowering the NYPD to conduct\nvertical patrols and other services in NYCHA buildings.  Plaintiffs’ argument is\nbased on the premise that “the City’s unlawful and discriminatory stop and arrest\n22–23 (citing City of Yonkers, 96 F.3d at 613–14; Comer v. Cisneros, 37 F.3d 775,\n804 (2d Cir. 1994)).  NYCHA is a municipal agency, see United States v. Torres,\n703 F.3d 194, 202 (2d Cir. 2012), but I dismissed plaintiffs’ equal protection\nclaims against NYCHA in Davis I, 2012 WL 4813837, at *16.\n235 Pl. Opp. at 20.\n236 For its part, NYCHA has provided uncontested evidence of a Non-\nDiscrimination Policy and related procedures, as well as of numerous security\nmeasures.  See NYCHA Mem. at 7–8, 10–14.\n87\n\npractices are well-known to NYCHA officials.”237  While I denied summary\njudgment, above, on plaintiffs’ claim that the City’s trespass enforcement practices\nin NYCHA buildings discriminate in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, I\nnoted that plaintiffs’ evidence was tenuous.  Plaintiffs’ attempt to establish\nNYCHA’s liability for various race discrimination claims based on NYCHA’s\nknowledge of the City’s equal protection violations is a step too far.  Even if a jury\nwere to find that the City’s trespass enforcement practices violate the Equal\nProtection Clause, plaintiffs cite no evidence that NYCHA continued to rely on the\nCity’s services despite constructive or actual notice that the City’s practices were\ndiscriminatory.238  All of plaintiffs’ evidence of notice to NYCHA of unlawful\ntrespass enforcement practices concerns notice of stops and arrests based on\ninadequate legal justification under the Fourth Amendment, not based on race\ndiscrimination.239\nFor the foregoing reasons, NYCHA’s motion for summary judgment\non plaintiffs’ remaining race discrimination claims is granted.240  \n237 Pl. Opp. at 20.\n238 See id. at 20–23.\n239 See id. at 21 (citing sources contained in PAF ¶¶ 29–30, 84–85).\n240 As noted above, I already granted summary judgment to NYCHA on\nplaintiffs’ equal protection claims in Davis I, 2012 WL 4813837, at *16.\n88\n\nH. USHA Claims Against NYCHA\nIn Davis I, I concluded that because 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(l)(2) “gives\nthe resident plaintiffs a right to a lease free from unreasonable terms and\nconditions, [plaintiffs’] suit alleges an infringement of a federal right actionable\nunder section 1983.”241  I went on to note:\nA dispute of fact exists about whether the “Highlights of\nHouse  Rules,  Lease  Terms  and  Policy”  constitutes  a  lease\naddendum.  There is also a dispute of fact as to whether the\nprovisions in that document — mandating that tenants cooperate\nwith police officers and avoid “lingering” in common areas — are\nunreasonable. . . .  Based on my evaluation of the arrest of Jackson\nand Johnson at the top of the stairwell and the corresponding\nvagueness of the prohibition against “lingering” in common areas,\nI am skeptical that NYCHA will be able to prevail at summary\njudgment.    Nevertheless,  so  that  both  parties  have  the  full\nopportunity to present their case, NYCHA’s motion is denied\nwithout prejudice and with leave to renew.242\nNYCHA has renewed its motion for summary judgment on resident\nplaintiffs’ USHA claims, and the parties have submitted briefing on whether the\nprovisions in the Highlights document are unreasonable.  NYCHA also renews its\nargument that the Highlights document is not a part of the lease.243  Based on the\n241 Id. at *24.\n242 Id. at *25.  See also id. at *22 n.192 (detailing dispute over\n“Highlights”).\n243 See NYCHA Mem. at 14–16.  \n89\n\nparties’ submissions, there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether\nthe requirements in the Highlights document were effectively incorporated into the\nstandard NYCHA lease for the purposes of the USHA.  \nAs I suggested in Davis I, the Highlights document is highly\nambiguous.244  On the one hand, the Highlights document states, in bold, near the\ntop of the first page:  “Note that this document is NOT a lease and NOT a lease\naddendum.”245  In addition, NYCHA argues that lease changes and the adoption of\nformal rules and regulations require various procedures that were not followed in\nissuing the Highlights document.246  NYCHA concludes that the Highlights\ndocument cannot have been incorporated into the standard NYCHA lease under\nparagraph 12d of that lease, which requires all tenants to “abide by all necessary\nand reasonable regulations promulgated from time to time by the Landlord, which\nshall be posted in the Property Management Office and incorporated by reference\nin this Lease.”247 \n244 See Davis I, 2012 WL 4813837, at *22 n.192.\n245 Highlights of House Rules, Lease Terms and Policy (“Highlights”),\nEx. 28 to 7/20/12 Declaration of Katharine E.G. Brooker, at 1.  \n246 See NYCHA Mem. at 15–16 (citing 24 C.F.R. § 966.3; New York\nPublic Housing Law § 56).  \n247 NYCHA Resident Lease Agreement (“NYCHA Lease”), Ex. B to\n12/5/12 Declaration of Alan Pelikow, counsel for NYCHA (“Pelikow Decl.”),\n90\n\nOn the other hand, the top of the Highlights document presents the\ndocument as containing “requirements” for “NYCHA residents.”248  The document\nin fact contains a list of apparently legally binding requirements, was mailed to all\nNYCHA residents in December 2010, and states on its final page that “NYCHA\nrequires” that all tenants and household members sign the document.249  The\nwarning on the first page that the document is not a lease or lease addendum could\nbe read, in context, not as implying that the requirements are optional, but rather as\nclarifying that signing the Highlights document confers no legal rights:  the next\nline states that “[t]he act of signing this document will not grant any rights of\ntenancy or authorized occupancy.”250  Plaintiffs also argue that the Highlights\ndocument was incorporated into the lease under paragraph 12bb, which requires all\ntenants to “comply with and obey all rules and regulations prescribed from time to\ntime by the Landlord concerning the use and care of the Leased Premises or any\ncommon or community spaces . . . .”251  The distinction between the word\n“prescribed” in paragraph 12bb and “promulgated” in paragraph 12d may suggest\n¶ 12d.\n248 Highlights at 1. \n249 Id. at 4; Pelikow Decl. at ¶ 17. \n250 Highlights at 1.  \n251 Pl. Opp. at 23 (citing NYCHA Lease ¶ 12bb).  \n91\n\nthat two different types of rules are at issue, both legally binding under the terms of\nthe lease and for the purpose of the USHA’s “unreasonable terms” prohibition, but\nonly one requiring the formal procedures laid out in 24 C.F.R. § 966.3 and New\nYork Public Housing Law § 56.\nAs noted above, section 1437d(l)(2) of the USHA states that “[e]ach\npublic housing agency shall utilize leases which . . . do not contain unreasonable\nterms and conditions.”  Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs, the\npreceding evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether some or all\nof the requirements listed in the Highlights document are “contained” in the\nstandard NYCHA lease by way of paragraph 12bb.  A public housing agency may\nnot evade the requirements of section 1437d(l)(2) simply by introducing\nunreasonable lease terms and conditions for tenants in a document that nominally\npurports not to be a lease or lease addendum.  On the other hand, there is a\nquestion as to whether a public housing agency exposes itself to liability under the\nUSHA if it deliberately conveys to residents the belief that a set of rules are legally\nbinding requirements and could result in eviction, while at the same time knowing\nthat the rules have no legal status or practical effect.  Extrinsic evidence will likely\nbe decisive in determining the meaning and effect of the Highlights document, as\neven NYCHA seems to acknowledge, implicitly, by encouraging the Court to\n92\n\ninterpret the Highlights document based on a detailed factual declaration\naccompanying NYCHA’s brief.252  The significance and credibility of this extrinsic\nevidence is for a jury, and cannot be determined as a matter of law.\nAssuming that a reasonable juror could find that some or all of the\nHighlights document rules were “contained” in the standard NYCHA lease for the\npurposes of the USHA, I now turn to what constitutes an “unreasonable term or\ncondition” under section 1437d(l)(2).  At least one court has held that section\n1437d(l)(2) “require[s] that lease terms be rationally related to a legitimate\nhousing purpose.”253  Courts have looked to statutes, legislative history, and HUD\nregulations for evidence of relevant housing purposes.254  “Lease provisions which\nare arbitrary and capricious, or excessively overbroad or under-inclusive, will be\ninvalidated” as unreasonable.255  The possibility of applying a rule “in an arbitrary\nor discriminatory manner” may weigh in favor of finding unreasonableness.256\n252 See NYCHA Mem. at 14–16 (citing Pelikow Decl.).  \n253 Richmond Tenants Org., Inc. v. Richmond Redevelopment, 751 F.\nSupp. 1204, 1205 (E.D. Va. 1990) (emphasis added), aff’d, 947 F.2d 942 (4th Cir.\n1991) (unreported) (per curiam).\n254 See, e.g., Thompson v. Ashe, 250 F.3d 399, 409 (6th Cir. 2001).\n255 Richmond, 751 F. Supp. at 1205.  Accord Cabrini-Green Local\nAdvisory Council v. Chicago Hous. Auth., No. 29 C 6949, 2007 WL 294253, at *2\n(N.D. Ill. Jan. 29, 2007) (citing Richmond, 751 F. Supp. at 1205–06).\n256 Richmond, 751 F. Supp. at 1206.\n93\n\nPlaintiffs argue that two of the rules in the Highlights document are\nunreasonable.  First, plaintiffs argue that the rule prohibiting “lingering” in “the\nlobby, corridors, and stairwell” and mandating that “[t]he lobby or stairwell is\nmeant for resident use to either go in or out of the building or to walk from floor to\nfloor” is excessively overbroad and invites arbitrary or discriminatory\nenforcement.257  Second, plaintiffs argue that the rule requiring residents to\n“cooperate with inquiries from . . . the police regarding their presence or conduct in\nany building” unreasonably pressures residents to interact with NYPD officers\nwithout regard to their constitutional rights, including the Fifth Amendment right\nto remain silent.258\nNYCHA does not meaningfully defend the reasonableness of either\nrule.  Instead, NYCHA continues its earlier argument that the rules in the\nHighlights document are not enforceable lease terms, and indeed are of little\nconsequence.  Perhaps NYCHA means to imply that the rules challenged by\nplaintiffs cannot be unreasonable terms, because they have no unreasonable effects. \nNYCHA argues that under IO 23, NYPD officers who observe a resident violating\na NYCHA rule can, at most, fill out a “Field Report” and submit it to NYCHA\n257 See Pl. Opp. at 24 (citing Highlights ¶ 21).\n258 See id. at 25 (citing Highlights ¶ 18).\n94\n\nManagement, which might then call the resident “to ascertain the\ncircumstances.”259  NYCHA also notes that New York’s criminal trespassing laws\ndo not permit NYPD officers to stop or arrest someone for violating NYCHA’s\nrule against “lingering.”  NYCHA suggests that if Dr. Fagan’s study shows that\nmany officers have, in fact, stopped many people in NYCHA buildings based on\nlingering, the officers did so prior to the issuance of the Highlights document and\nnot based on the rule against lingering contained in it.260  Finally, NYCHA states\nthat a Field Report based on lingering cannot lead to the termination of tenancy.261\nNYCHA’s disavowals of the practical significance of the Highlights\ndocument provide further evidence in support of finding that the rules in the\ndocument are not contained in the standard NYCHA lease for the purposes of the\nUSHA.  Nevertheless, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs, a\nreasonable juror could reject NYCHA’s evidence that the Highlights rules have\nlittle or no effect,262 and could also conclude that the rules are unreasonable for the\n259 Pelikow Decl. at ¶ 25.  See NYCHA Mem. at 16, 18.\n260 See NYCHA Mem. at 16–18.\n261 See id. at 18.\n262 For example, the Highlights document states that “NYCHA may start\na proceeding to terminate tenancy if a tenant or family member . . . breaches\nNYCHA rules.”  Highlights ¶ 28.

CONCLUSION\nThe City’s, NYCHA’s, and plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment\nare granted in part and denied in part:  \n(1)  The  City’s  and  plaintiffs’  motions  for  summary  judgment on\nplaintiffs’  Fourth  Amendment  claims  are  denied,  leaving  the\nremaining arrested plaintiffs with viable claims. \n(2) The  City’s  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  the  remaining\narrested plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment equal protection claims\nis denied.\n(3)  The City’s motion for summary judgment on resident plaintiffs’\nFourteenth Amendment equal protection, Title VI, section 1981,\nand FHA claims is denied, leaving Evans and Littlejohn with\nviable claims. \n(4)  The City’s motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ remaining\nNYSC claims is granted. \nmay only be evicted based on rules violations where the rules have been formally\npromulgated).\n263 My conclusion is unaffected by the issue, discussed above, of whether\nJackson and Johnson were stopped for presence in a prohibited area or for loitering\nor lingering.
