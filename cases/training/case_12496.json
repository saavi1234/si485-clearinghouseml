The Unions' motions to intervene are DENIED for three reasons: (1) the motions are untimely; (2) the Unions have no significant protectable interests relating to the subject of the litigation that would warrant intervention; and (3) even if their alleged interests were cognizable, the Unions lack standing to vindicate those interests on appeal. The parties' motion for an order modifying the Remedial Order is GRANTED. The modification shall be set forth in a separate order to be issued forthwith. The Unions' request to participate in the settlement of Floyd and Ligon is, therefore, DENIED as moot. The Unions' request to participate in the remedial phase of Floyd is also DENIED as moot because the Remedial Order already offers \"police organizations\" the opportunity to participate in the development of reforms to NYPD stop-and-frisk policies and procedures through the \"Joint Remedial Process.\" To the extent the Unions request to participate in the remedial phase of Ligon, that request is DENIED for the same reasons the Court denies their motion to intervene for the purpose of appealing the Remedial Order. Having resolved the motions to intervene, and having approved the terms of the parties' proposed resolution of the City's appeals, the Court has continuing jurisdiction only \"insofar as is necessary to effectuate a settlement.\" Ligon, 743 F.3d at 365. Accordingly, by August 6, 2014, the City shall submit a letter to the Court indicating the status of its pending appeals. This Court shall take no further action unrelated to effectuating the parties' settlement unless and until the Court of Appeals dissolves the stay or otherwise returns jurisdiction to the District Court. The Clerk of Court shall terminate the motions at ECF Nos. 436 and 441 in Floyd and ECF No. 171 in Ligon. (Signed by Judge Analisa Torres on 7/30/2014) (tro) (Entered: 07/30/2014)"

For the reasons stated in an Opinion and Order of even date, and pursuant to the directive of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to \"effectuate a settlement,\" Mandate and Opinion, (Feb. 21, 2014), Floyd, ECF No. 426; Ligon, ECF No. 166, IT IS ORDERED that paragraph 12 on page 13 of the Remedial Order, Floyd, ECF No. 372; Ligon, ECF No. 120, is deleted and the following is substituted in its place: 12. a. The Monitor's position will come to an end in Floyd no sooner than three years after the Court's entry of the final order approving the Immediate Reforms to be developed in Floyd and if and only if the City can show by a preponderance of the evidence at that time that it has achieved substantial compliance with all of the Immediate and Joint Process Reforms to be approved and so-ordered by the Court in Floyd. If the City fails to make such showing, the Monitor's position will continue until such time as the City can make the required showing of substantial compliance. b. The Monitor's position with respect to the preliminary injunctive relief in Ligon will come to an end no sooner than three years after the Court's entry of the final order approving the preliminary injunctive relief set forth in Section III of this Order, entitled \"Remedies in Ligon\" (the \"Ligon Preliminary Injunctive Relief\") and if and only if the City can show by a preponderance of the evidence at that time that it has achieved substantial compliance with all of the Ligon Preliminary Injunctive Relief. If the City fails to make such showing, the Monitor's position will continue until such time as the City can make the required showing of substantial compliance. c. \"Substantial compliance\" in Floyd shall be defined as compliance with all material aspects of the Immediate and Joint Process Reforms to be approved and so-ordered by the Court. \"Substantial compliance\" in Ligon shall be defined as compliance with all material aspects of the Ligon Preliminary Injunctive Relief. In either case, noncompliance with mere technicalities, or temporary failure to comply during a period of otherwise sustained compliance will not constitute a failure of substantial compliance. However, temporary compliance during a period of otherwise sustained non-compliance shall not constitute substantial compliance. d. Substantial compliance shall be measured using the milestones to be set by the Monitor pursuant to paragraph 5 above. The Clerk of Court shall terminate the motions at ECF No. 456 in Floyd and ECF No. 188 in Ligon. (Signed by Judge Analisa Torres on 7/30/2014) (tro) (Entered: 07/30/2014)"

A plan for monitoring the program during the implementation stage; c. A plan for assessing whether requiring activation of BWCs during Level 1 encounters enhances the NYPD's ability to capture on BWCs encounters that escalate to Level 2 or Level 3; and d.

Kelly, Kieron Ramdeen, Miguel Santiago, City of New York, Joseph Koch, Johnny Blasini, Joseph Bermudez, John Does 1-12 USCA Case Number 13-3123. Pending before the Court is a motion filed by Appellants City of New York et al. seeking a stay of the District Court's August 12, 2013 remedial order and preliminary injunction (\"Remedies Opinion\"). It is hereby ORDERED that the District Courts January 8, 2013 \"Opinion and Order,\" as well as the August 12, 2013 \"Liability Opinion\" and \"Remedies Opinion,\" each of which may or will have the effect of causing actions to be taken by defendants or designees of the District Court, or causing restraints against actions that otherwise would be taken by defendants, are STAYED pending the disposition of these appeals. The appeal by defendants in both (consolidated) actions shall continue in the normal course, under the following schedule: Defendants shall perfect their appeals by January 24, 2014. Plaintiffs shall file by February 28, 2014. Defendants shall reply by March 14, 2014. Oral argument shall be heard on a date after March 14, 2014, to be set by the Court in due course. The cause is REMANDED to the District Court for the sole purpose of implementation of this Order, and the mandate shall otherwise remain with this Court until the completion of the appeals process. Upon review of the record in these cases, we conclude that the District Judge ran afoul of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, Canon 2 (\"A judge should avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities.\"); see also Canon 3(C)(1) (\"A judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned....\"), and that the appearance of partiality surrounding this litigation was compromised by the District Judge's improper application of the Court's \"related case rule,\" see Transfer of Related Cases, S.D.N.Y. & E.D.N.Y. Local Rule 13(a), and by a series of media interviews and public statements purporting to respond publicly to criticism of the District Court. Accordingly, we conclude that, in the interest, and appearance, of fair and impartial administration of justice, UPON REMAND, these cases shall be assigned to a different District Judge, chosen randomly under the established practices of the District Court for the Southern District of New York. This newly-designated District Judge shall implement this Court's mandate staying all proceedings and otherwise await further action by the Court of Appeals on the merits of the ongoing appeals. In taking these actions, we intimate no view on the substance or merits of the pending appeals, which have yet to be fully briefed and argued. The mandate shall ISSUE FORTHWITH for the sole purpose of implementation of this Order and shall otherwise remain in this Court.In the interest of judicial economy, any question, application, or further appeal regarding the scope of this Order or its implementation shall be directed to this panel, which will hear the case on the merits in due course.

          "description": "MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER: #101911 This putative class action challenges the New York City Police Department's implementation of Operation Clean Halls, a program pursuant to which police officers patrol inside and around thousands of private residential apartment buildings throughout New York City. Plaintiffs allege that they and their minor children have been unlawfully stopped, questioned, frisked, and/or arrested in or around their homes or their family members' homes. The parties' first discovery dispute involves defendants' request for the unsealing of records relating to any prior arrests of plaintiffs. Defendants have no legitimate reason to examine paperwork from an old arrest for possession of drugs or disorderly conduct that terminated in a plaintiff's favor and was sealed pursuant to important state privacy law. When it can, the federal interest in broad discovery should accommodate this New York privilege. Defendants must be provided access to prior arrest records and paperwork only for charges of trespass or related crimes for the past ten years. Plaintiffs should also disclose to defendants the length of time that they were detained and incarcerated as a result of any prior arrests and any emotional or physical injuries that they suffered as a result of those arrests. This disclosure may be made in a sworn affidavit, but does not require the unsealing of arrest records. If, despite this guidance, the parties still disagree about the unsealing of particular arrest files, I will adjudicate the disputes on a case-by-case basis. (Signed by Judge Shira A. Scheindlin on 6/12/2012) (rjm) Modified on 6/13/2012 (jab). (Entered: 06/12/2012)"

Plaintiffs in Floyd and Ligon promptly requested until September 6, 2013 to submit letters in opposition to the City's motion. The City opposed plaintiffs' requests, arguing that plaintiffs should be granted no more than three days to draft an opposition letter, because this is the time normally allotted for responses to pre-motion letters under this Court's Individual Rules. The City's stay request is a motion, not a pre-motion letter, and the City had fifteen days to prepare its motion. Plaintiffs will have ten days, including the Labor Day weekend, to prepare their opposition letter. Thus, plaintiffs' opposition will be due by September 6, 2013. The City's reply will be due by September 12, 2013, pursuant to the City's request. (Signed by Judge Shira A. Scheindlin on 8/29/2013) (rsh) (Entered: 08/29/2013)"

The Opinion stated that the Joint Remedial Process would be guided by a Facilitator to be named by the Court. I am now appointing Nicholas Turner, President and Director of the VERA Institute of Justice, as the Facilitator. After previously working at VERA for nine years, Mr. Turner was recently named as the Institute's fifth President... Based in New York City, the VERA Institute is widely recognized for its use of rigorous testing and broad-based collaboration to help governments plan, implement, and evaluate improvements to the justice system... VERA has a long history of working to improve public safety by strengthening the ties between police and the community. In the early 1980s, VERA partnered with the NYPD to develop the Community Patrol Officer Program, one of the first community policing programs in the country. A 1999 study of two police precincts in the South Bronx examined approaches to respectful and effective policing in minority communities. SO ORDERED. (See Order). (Signed by Judge Shira A.

Kelly, Kieron Ramdeen, Miguel Santiago, City of New York, Joseph Koch, Johnny Blasini, Joseph Bermudez, John Does 1-12 USCA Case Number 13-3123-cv; 14-2834-cv. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, Judge Torres's July 30, 2014 decision is AFFIRMED as being an appropriate exercise of her discretion, the police unions' motions to intervene in the appeals are DENIED, the City's motion for voluntary dismissal of the appeals with prejudice is GRANTED, and the causes are REMANDED for such further proceedings before Judge Torres as may be appropriate in the circumstances. The mandate shall issue seven days from the date of the filing of this opinion. Nothing that we have written here, or that the parties have suggested, should foreclose any reliance by the unions on collective bargaining rights afforded to them under the Labor Management Relations Act and state and local law. Moreover, in view of the possible relevance of the unions perspectives in any ongoing District Court proceedings, nothing in this opinion should be construed to inhibit the District Court from considering the interests of the unions, either as amici curiae, or on such other terms as the District Court may deem appropriate.

          "description": "ORDER: The Monitor his submitted recommendations regarding training to be given at roll call regarding enforcement activities in and near residences enrolled in the Trespass Affidavit Program (\"TAP\"). ECF No. 260. Plaintiffs object to the Monitor's recommendation with respect to the voice-over script for slide 17 of the proposed training. ECF No. 261. In particular, Plaintiffs worry that the training \"would permit officers who lack probable cause to believe a person is trespassing nonetheless to order the person to leave and then to use a failure to comply with that order to justify an arrest.\" Id. at 1. Additional letters were filed by Defendants, Plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs in Davis v. City of New York, No. 10 Civ. 699. ECF Nos. 269, 271, 273. In June 2016, the Court approved revisions to Patrol Guide (\"P.G.\") 212-59, which sets forth the procedures governing interactions between the police and the public in and around TAP buildings. ECF No. 249. All parties supported the approval of these revisions. Id. at 6. The proposed voice-over script for slide 17 includes some but not all of the language in P.G. 212-59. The Court finds that the addition of language from P.G. 212-59 to the proposed voice-over script for slide 17 clarifies the probable cause requirement. Accordingly, the Monitor's recommendation is APPROVED with the following modification of the proposed voice-over script for slide 17: Now let's discuss how you can deal with a person who is uncooperative and won't answer your questions, or where you can't verify a person's authority to be in the building. At Levels 1 and 2, when individuals are free to walk away, a person's decision to leave the building, remain silent, or refuse to provide information or identification when questioned by the police does not give you reasonable suspicion to stop or probable cause to arrest. Even at Level 3, you may detain the person but he or she is still not required to answer your questions. Remember, the burden of proving that an individual does not have authority to be in the building rests on the Police. The individual is not required to answer questions, not even about his or her authority to be in the building. If you suspect the person does not have authority to be in the building, but the person cannot or refuses to explain his or her presence in the building, and you are unable to verify the person's authority to be in the building, you may instruct that person that he or she must leave the building, and that refusal may result in arrest for Criminal Trespass. However, you may only arrest the person if there is probable cause to believe that the person committed a trespass. A reasonable investigation is ordinarily necessary to determine whether probable cause exists. A person's refusal or inability to produce identification or provide information does not elevate the level of the encounter.

ENDORSEMENT: On November 11, 2021, the Court, through Deputy Monitor Richard Jerome, invited both sides to participate in the monitor selection process by proposing, by November 24, 2021, three candidates each to succeed the late Peter Zimroth. Plaintiffs have thus far declined to do so. The Court shall not abdicate to the public its responsibility to appoint an individual qualified to continue the work of the monitor, which is years underway. United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 29 F.3d 40, 44 (2d Cir. 1994) (per curiam). Nor shall the Court adopt, midstream, a selection process that will delay the monitorship's ongoing work. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' request is DENIED. The Court reiterates its invitation to Plaintiffs to recommend three candidates by November 29, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Analisa Torres on 11/22/2021) (kv) (Entered: 11/22/2021)"

By Supplemental Order dated September 4, 2013, the Court appointed Nicholas Turner as Facilitator to guide the Joint Remedial Process. Due to professional obligations that have arisen since his appointment, Mr. Turner has withdrawn as Facilitator. The Court now appoints as Facilitator the Honorable Ariel E. Belen, a retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, Second Department, currently serving as a neutral mediator and arbitrator at JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution (\"ADR\") provider. Justice Belen, a graduate of Cornell Law School, began his legal career as a public defender with the Legal Aid Society of New York (1981-1990). At Legal Aid, he represented indigent criminal defendants, frequently participating in suppression hearings concerning, among other issues, stop-and-frisk violations. Later, at the City of New York Law Department, he worked as an Assistant Corporation Counsel (1990-1993), Deputy Chief of the Brooklyn Tort Division (1993-1994), and Chief of the Bronx Borough Office (1994), representing police officers sued for alleged civil rights violations, unlawful detentions, and the use of excessive force. Beginning in 1995, Justice Belen served in Kings County as a New York State Supreme Court Justice in various capacities, including in the trial court, at the Appellate Term, and as Administrative Judge of the Civil Term. Justice Belen was appointed to the Appellate Division, Second Department in 2008. In 2012, he joined JAMS. Justice Belen chairs the ADR Committee of the New York County Lawyers' Association and is a Member of the Executive Advisory Committee of the International Institute for Conflict Prevention & Resolution Panel of Distinguished Neutrals.

          "description": "AMENDED OPINION & ORDER #102768: This case, filed in 2012, is one of three cases currently before this Court challenging aspects of the New York City Police Department's \"stop and frisk\" practices. Of the three cases, this case is the most narrow. It deals only with stops made by the police on suspicion of trespass outside of certain privately-owned buildings in the Bronx. But the legal issues raised by this case have roots that stretch back decades. For the reasons explained herein, plaintiffs' motion is granted, although the full extent of the relief has not yet been determined. No action is required by the Clerk of the Court, because plaintiffs' motion has already been closed. (Signed by Judge Shira A. Scheindlin on 2/14/2013) (ja) Modified on 2/19/2013 (rsh).

Scheindlin, from Alexis Karteron, dated 7/2/2013, re: request a pre-motion conference concerning a motion for an extension of time to serve Johnny Blasini, a retired NYPD officer who was named as a defendant in the Complaint in this matter. Although the 120-day period for service under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m) has expired, this Court may extend the time for service. The plaintiffs submit that the Court should do so here because granting the extension of time would conserve judicial resources without prejudicing Mr. Blasini.

          "description": "SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER: This Order supplements the Remedies Opinion of August 12, 2013, which ordered the parties to engage in a community-based remedial process (the \"Joint Remedial Process\") to develop sustainable reforms to the stop and frisk practices of the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\"). The Opinion stated that the Joint Remedial Process would be guided by a Facilitator to be named by the Court. On September 4, 2013, I appointed Nicholas Turner, President and Director of the VERA Institute of Justice, as the Facilitator. To help the Facilitator and the Monitor in their challenging tasks, I am appointing an Academic Advisory Council consisting of professors from area law schools. These professors have generously agreed to provide their expertise in a pro bono capacity. The Chair of the Council is Professor Bennett Capers of Brooklyn Law School. The other members of the Advisory Council are: Ian Ayres, William K. Townsend Professor Law, Yale Law School; Alafair S. Burke, Professor of Law, Maurice A. Deane School of Law at Hofstra University; Miriam Gohara, Visiting Assistant Professor, Columbia Law School; Taja-Nia Y. Henderson, Associate Professor of Law, Rutgers School of Law-Newark; Tanya K.

Kelly, Kieron Ramdeen, Miguel Santiago, City of New York, Joseph Koch, Johnny Blasini, Joseph Bermudez, John Does 1-12. USCA Case Number 13-3088; 13-3123.These cases, motions of which were argued in tandem and decided on October 31, 2013, and which concern the so-called \"stop-and-frisk\" policies of the New York City Police Department, have, quite apart from the underlying merits, raised a number of unusual procedural issues. In a separate opinion published contemporaneously with this one, we explain the basis of our prior, brief order reassigning these cases from Judge Shira A. Scheindlin to a new district judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, to be chosen randomly. In this opinion, we address the unprecedented motion filed by Judge Scheindlin herself, through counsel, to appear and seek reconsideration of our order of reassignment. The motion, submitted substantially in the form of a brief in favor of reconsideration, presents the threshold question whether, in the circumstances presented, a district judge may participate as a party, as an intervenor, or as an amicus curiae in an appeal of her decisions. For the reasons set forth below, we DENY Judge Scheindlin's motion to appear in this Court in support of retaining authority over these cases.

    "summary": "<p>This is one of four ongoing cases challenging the constitutionality of the New York Police Department's \"Stop and Frisk\" program. See: <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floyd v. City of New York</a>; <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12023/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daniels v. City of New York</a>; and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12494/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Davis v. City of New York</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On March 28, 2012, twelve New York City residents and one former New York City resident filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the City of New York and the New York City Police Department (NYPD) on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals. They challenged the city's \"Operation Clean Halls\" initiative (later renamed the \"Trespass Affidavit Program\"), which allowed police officers to patrol in and around private residential apartment buildings, and allegedly resulted in thousands of illegal stops, searches, summons (citations), and arrests. The plaintiffs were represented by a group of public interest lawyers from the New York Civil Liberties Union, Bronx Defenders and LatinoJustice. They filed the lawsuit under the Fair Housing Act and state law, alleging violations of the Federal and State Constitutions. The plaintiffs asked for a declaration that the NYPD's practices were unlawful and an injunction against those practices.</p>\r\n<p>Operation Clean Halls had the stated purpose of combating illegal activity in apartment buildings with records of high crime. In Manhattan alone, there were at least 3,895 Clean Halls buildings. Searches and seizures occurred in public areas such as courtyards, lobbies, and sidewalks, and NYPD officers engaged in vertical patrols (floor-by-floor sweeps), much like those that were challenged in litigation surrounding New York City Housing Authority residences. The plaintiffs alleged that they had been stopped without suspicion of unlawful behavior, and that they had been arrested or issued summons (citations) without probable cause. In multiple instances, plaintiffs were arrested for trespassing despite having another resident vouch for them. The plaintiffs alleged that these incidents were part of a larger pattern and practice in buildings enrolled in Operation Clean Halls, without meaningful correlations to actual crime levels. The residents of Clean Hall buildings were disproportionately Black and Latino. The plaintiffs also alleged that the City had been deliberately indifferent to these violations in their failure to train and supervise the NYPD.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs asked for a class certification for all residents of Clean Hall buildings and their families, guests, and visitors and for all individuals who had been or were likely to be unlawfully stopped or arrested for being in or around buildings in the Operation Clean Halls initiative. The plaintiffs claimed violations of the Fourth Amendment; First and Fourteenth Amendments (free association and due process); the Fair Housing Act (discriminatory implementation); the New York Constitution; and New York Common Law (false arrest and malicious prosecution). The plaintiffs asked for a declaration that these laws had been violated. The plaintiffs also demanded an injunction that required the defendants to refrain from these violations, to establish citywide standards regarding Operation Clean Halls, to establish a system for tracking and monitoring NYPD practices (with care paid to tracking race, national origin, and geography), develop appropriate training for NYPD officers; and report to the plaintiffs and the court about the steps taken to cure the violations. The plaintiffs also asked for compensatory damages and attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>On June 12, 2012, the Court (Shira A. Scheindlin, J.) issued a memorandum opinion and order. Ligon v. City of New York, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81526, 2012 WL 2125989 (S.D.N.Y. June 12, 2012). The defendants wanted access to paperwork on the plaintiffs' prior arrests, even if they were terminated in the plaintiffs' favor and were now sealed pursuant to state law. Judge Scheindlin ruled that there was no legitimate reason for the defendants to access those files unless they were for charges of trespass or related crimes in the past ten years. The Court also ruled that the plaintiffs must make other disclosures about the length of time they were incarcerated and any injuries they suffered as a result of prior arrests, but that that could be done by sworn affidavit.</p>\r\n<p>On August 21, 2012, Judge Scheindlin issued an opinion and order allowing the plaintiffs' evidentiary hearing to proceed, regarding their request for a preliminary injunction. Ligon v. City of New York, 2012 WL 3597066 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2012). The defendants had asked the Court to deny the plaintiffs' motion summarily, prior to a hearing. The defendants had argued (among other reasons) that there was overlap in the plaintiff classes between this case and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floyd</a>, so there was a risk of inconsistent adjudications. The Court pointed out that both matters were assigned to the same judge and gave the defendants a choice: they could cease delaying <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floyd</a> with interlocutory appeals or they could agree to let these plaintiffs pursue preliminary injunctive relief. The Court wrote: \"the City cannot have it both ways.\" This case went forward with the preliminary injunction proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>The preliminary injunction hearing took place in October and November 2012. On January 8, 2013, Judge Scheindlin ruled for the plaintiffs, finding that they had demonstrated the likelihood that they would prevail on the merits, and proved the city's deliberate indifference toward a widespread practice of unconstitutional trespass stops by the NYPD outside TAP buildings in the Bronx. Judge Scheindlin summarized that her conclusion was based on five categories of evidence:</p>\r\n<p>(1) the testimony of a Bronx Assistant District Attorney that the NYPD frequently made trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx for no reason other than that the officer had seen someone enter and exit or exit the building;</p>\r\n<p>(2) a sample of \"decline to prosecute\" forms prepared by the Bronx District Attorneys' Office, which revealed the alarming frequency of unlawful trespass stops in the vicinity of TAP buildings in the Bronx;</p>\r\n<p>(3) the testimony of eight plaintiffs and a non-party witness, who described remarkably similar encounters with the police when stopped in the vicinity of TAP buildings in the Bronx;</p>\r\n<p>(4) the analysis by Dr. Jeffrey Fagan, plaintiffs' expert, of an NYPD database of recorded stops, which provided further evidence of the frequency of apparently unlawful trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx; and</p>\r\n<p>(5) NYPD training materials that misstated the minimal constitutional standards for making stops.</p>\r\n<p>The Court issued a preliminary injunction, ordering the NYPD to immediately cease performing trespass stops (in which a reasonable person would not feel free to terminate the encounter) outside TAP buildings in the Bronx without reasonable suspicion of trespass. In addition, Judge Scheindlin set out proposed relief, and consolidated a hearing on it with the already-scheduled remedial hearing in the related <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floyd</a> litigation. The proposed relief included requirements to develop constitutionally adequate policy guidance on stops, to collect data on each such stop, and to improve supervision and training. Ligon v. City of New York, 2013 WL 71800 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2013).</p>\r\n<p>On January 11, 2013, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. On January 22, 2013, District Judge Scheindlin granted the defendants' stay of relief, pending their appeal in the circuit court.</p>\r\n<p>On February 11, 2013, Judge Scheindlin granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification solely for the purpose of preliminary injunctive relief. The class included \"all individuals who have been or are at risk of being stopped outdoors without legal justification by NYPD officers on suspicion of trespassing in Bronx apartment buildings enrolled in the NYPD's Trespass Affidavit Program (commonly referred to as \"Operation Clean Halls\"). Ligon v. City of New York, 2013 WL 500272 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 11, 2013).</p>\r\n<p>After a nine-week bench trial, on August 12, 2013, Judge Scheindlin issued an order in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floyd</a>, finding that the City had violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by acting with &ldquo;deliberate indifference&rdquo; toward the NYPD's practice of making suspicion-less &ldquo;stops&rdquo; and &ldquo;frisks&rdquo; and by adopting &ldquo;a policy of indirect racial profiling by targeting racially defined groups&rdquo; for &ldquo;stops&rdquo; and &ldquo;frisks.&rdquo; That same day, Judge Scheindlin issued an order imposing remedies in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floyd</a> and Ligon in the form of various &ldquo;reforms&rdquo; to the NYPD's &ldquo;stop and frisk&rdquo; practices to be overseen by a court-appointed monitor. The Court appointed Peter Zimroth, former New York Corporation Counsel and former First Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan, to oversee the implementation of the relief. With respect to specific remedies, the Court ordered the NYPD to adopt a written policy spelling out the specific circumstances where stopping a person suspected of trespass outside a TAP building is legal. Additionally, the Court ordered the city (1) to develop procedures to ensure proper paperwork is completed for each stop outside a Bronx TAP building; (2) to develop and adopt a system for reviewing the legality of stops outside Bronx TAP buildings; and (3) to revise the NYPD's training materials and training programs to enter conformity with the law. Additionally, the Court ordered that attorney's fees and costs be rewarded on appropriate application. The City appealed in both cases and sought a stay.</p>\r\n<p>In September 2013, four police unions filed notices of appeal and motions to intervene in the District Court. Three of the unions moved to intervene in both Floyd and Ligon. One union only moved to intervene in Floyd.</p>\r\n<p>On October 31, 2013, the Second Circuit granted the City&rsquo;s motion for a stay and ordered that the cases be reassigned from Judge Scheindlin to another district judge. The Second Circuit wrote that the \"District Judge ran afoul of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges\" in (a) speaking to the press and (b) encouraging the plaintiffs' counsel in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12023/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daniels</a> to file the <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floyd</a> litigation, separately, rather than litigating racial profiling as part of <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12023/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daniels</a> -- particularly in stating that she would treat the new case as related. 538 F. App'x 101 (2d Cir. 2013).</p>\r\n<p>After the Second Circuit ruled, both <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floyd</a> and Ligon were reassigned (as related) to District Judge Analisa Torres. On November 13, 2013, the Court of Appeals rejected Judge Scheindlin's motion asking to be heard on the disqualification issue and clarified the reason for reassigning the case. The Second Circuit held that the rationale for the reassignment was an appearance of impropriety, not its actual presence. 736 F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2013).</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio was elected, and took a very different approach to these cases. The city moved for limited remand from the Second Circuit to the district court for the purpose of exploring settlement. On February 21, 2014, the Second Circuit granted the City&rsquo;s motion to remand to the district court to explore settlement for 45 days. The Second Circuit declined to decide the police unions' motion to intervene, preferring to let the district court decide that motion first. 743 F.3d 362 (2d Cir. 2014).</p>\r\n<p>On March 4, 2014, the parties informed Judge Torres that they had &ldquo;reached an agreement in principle for resolving the City's appeals in both Floyd and Ligon. The City agreed to substantially comply with the injunctive relief set forth in Judge Scheindlin's August 12, 2013, remedial order, subject to the parties' application to Judge Torres to limit the term of the court-appointed monitor to three years. When the monitor&rsquo;s term ended, the City agreed to authorize the Inspector General of the NYPD to take over monitoring and reporting responsibilities. The parties agreed that the agreement could be terminated once the City has maintained compliance for two years. On July 30, 2014, Judge Torres granted the parties' joint motion to modify the remedial order and to enter it as an embodiment of their agreements.</p>\r\n<p>On July 30, 2014, Judge Torres also issued an order denying the police unions' motions to intervene, finding, inter alia, that the motions were untimely and that the police unions did not assert a legally protectable interest. 302 F.R.D. 69 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). The police unions appealed.</p>\r\n<p>However, on August 6, 2014, with the consent of the plaintiffs in Floyd and Ligon, the City moved to voluntarily dismiss its remaining appeals, with prejudice, stating that the parties had reached an agreement that resolved all the issues raised by the City's appeals in both Floyd and Ligon, and cleared the way for the parties to begin the remedial process and settlement negotiations.</p>\r\n<p>On October 31, 2014, the Second Circuit granted the City&rsquo;s request to voluntarily dismiss all appeals, with prejudice. In addition, the Second Circuit held that the unions&rsquo; motions to intervene were untimely and that the unions failed to establish legally protectable interests, as required to allow intervention. 770 F.3d 1051 (2d Cir. 2014).</p>\r\n<p>The parties continued to work with the monitor on developing appropriate reforms. On February 3, 2015, Judge Torres issued an order regarding the procedure for the monitor to develop and the City to implement the reforms of NYPD&rsquo;s stop-and-frisk activities. The monitor would consult with the parties to create a final recommendations for the implementation of remedies. Then, the court would approve or deny the final recommendations.</p>\r\n<p>First, on February 23, 2015, the monitor submitted and Judge Torres approved, a memo that was read by the NYPD at 10 consecutive roll calls in all precincts detailing the reforms ordered by Judge Scheindlin in Floyd. The memo was also posted in police stations and provided to all officers. The document detailed the constitutional standards governing stop and frisks, explicitly prohibited racial profiling by police, ordered officers to include a narrative explanation for stops in their UF250 forms, and ordered the start of a pilot program outfitting police officers with body cameras.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, on March 18, 2015, the City suggested a way for all five police unions to participate in the remedial process. Under the City's approach, the City would share proposals with the unions before providing them to the monitor and the plaintiffs. The unions could then offer their comments, which the City would convey to the monitor. This approach would afford the unions an opportunity to inform the monitor of their viewpoints before the monitor reached conclusions and submitted the final recommendations to the Court. On March 19, 2015, Judge Torres issued an order approving this framework.</p>\r\n<p>On August 7, 2015, the monitor submitted his final recommendations for reforms on racial profiling and street encounters. The new racial profiling policy imposed a categorical prohibition on racial and national origin profiling; it also prohibited other forms of biased policing not covered in the NYPD&rsquo;s current policy, such as profiling on the basis of religion, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, and housing status. The new street encounters policy regarding placed clearer legal limits on stops and frisks. It required supervisory review of officer conduct to ensure compliance with the Constitution. On August 24, 2015, Judge Torres approved the final recommendations.</p>\r\n<p>On December 8, 2015, Judge Torres issued an order modifying the remedial order&rsquo;s requirement that NYPD institute a pilot project in which body-worn cameras would be used for a one-year period. Judge Torres modified the order so that the NYPD would use a randomized experimental design for the body-worn camera pilot program.</p>\r\n<p>By February 2017, the parties had a settlement agreement and began the formal process for court approval of a class-action settlement. Judge Torres approved the stipulation of settlement on July 19, 2017. The settlement includes payment to the named plaintiffs totaling $235,000 and attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses totaling $2,640,533. The stipulation also articulates specific standards for stopping, frisking, searching, arresting, and issuing summonses in and around TAP buildings and requires the NYPD to implement and consistently adhere to those standards. In addition to the specific reforms outlined in the settlement, it provides that further reforms will be developed as part of the remedial process described in the August 2013 Floyd/Ligon joint remedial order.</p>\r\n<p>While the settlement of the claims in this case was being negotiated, the joint remedial process, part of the 2013 remedial order, included a comprehensive input process regarding recommended reforms. The input process concluded in April 2017, and in January 2018 the plaintiffs, describing the parties' impasse regarding the remedial process, requested that the facilitator issue a report and the parties hold a status conference. In an order of January 29, 2018, Judge Torres provided a schedule for the parties to work with the facilitator regarding reforms under the joint remedial process. Monitoring is ongoing in this case; see <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floyd</a>&nbsp;for the implementation and monitoring proceedings of the settlement agreements.</p>\r\n<p>In February of 2018, the monitor filed proposed training materials for newly promoted lieutenants and sergeants. The materials involved guidebooks and powerpoint presentations that would be used during a four week training course (for lieutenants) and a six week training course (for sergeants). The next month, Judge Torres approved the materials. In June 2018, the monitor filed additional training materials regarding In-Service Stop and Frisks by Patrol Officers, which were approved by Judge Torres the next month.</p>\r\n<p>On July 19, 2018, Judge Torres issued an order about the recommendation to document police-citizen encounters. The order stated that by September 13, 2018, the parties must submit a joint proposal for a pilot program to study the electronic recording of first- and second-level police-citizen encounters, to be overseen by the monitor. The proposal shall consider social science best practices. In developing the proposal, the parties shall consult with experts and the monitor. The monitor shall report to the Court whether the benefits of recording lower-level encounters outweigh the financial, administrative, and other costs, and whether the program should be expanded or terminated.</p>\r\n<p>On July 27, 2018, the monitor filed a report on the use of body cameras by NYPD officers that outlines how the data from the pilot program will be used to analyze police/civilian interactions, police activity, and police lawfulness.</p>\r\n<p>On August 13, 2018, Judge Torres approved a stipulation of fees for the time period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. The City agreed to pay fees of $275,149.00 to the New York Civil Liberties Union Foundation.</p>\r\n<p>In December of 2018, the monitor issued a report recommending the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) Guide on Processing and Investigating Complaints of Profiling and Bias-Based Policing Patrol, and two Internal Investigations courses on profiling and police bias as training materials. Judge Torres granted these recommendations in January 2019.</p>\r\n<p>On May 9, 2019, Judge Torres approved a stipulation of fees for the time period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. The City agreed to pay fees of $85,352.00 to the New York Civil Liberties Union Foundation.</p>\r\n<p>On May 28, 2019, the monitor made a recommendation regarding training materials for Housing Bureau members, including housing one-day training scenarios on lobby trespass, stairwell trespass, shots fired interior patrol, and roof trespass, which the Judge granted the next day.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Torres approved a proposed confidentiality order regarding the pilot study, which severely restricted public access to data collected on police encounters with civilians. The confidentiality order will protect the information that is obtained and created by trained observers studying officer behavior in the NYPD pilot study from disclosure to anyone other than the monitor and his team. In the related <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floyd</a> case, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the confidentiality order, and Judge Torres denied this motion on October 25, 2019. Floyd v. City of New York, 2019 WL 5537875 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 25, 2019).</p>\r\n<p>On June 2, 2020, Judge Torres issued an order instructing the NYPD to systematically obtain and report various categories of information. This information included declinations of prosecutions by district attorneys in New York, suppression decisions by courts excluding evidence as a result of unlawful stops and searches, court findings of incredible testimony by police officers, denials of indemnification and/or representation of police officers by the New York City Law Department, and judgments and settlements against police officers in civil cases where, in the opinion of the New York City Law Department, there exists evidence of police malfeasance. This information will be compiled regularly by the NYPD and sent to a committee, who will review the information and make assessments of individual officers, as well as the extent and manner of the intervention to be applied. This committee will also track metrics to evaluate the efficacy of the program. The committee, in conjunction with the monitor, will also develop a program for receiving and assessing information regarding adverse conduct of police officers, and this information will be provided to the Police Commissioner.</p>\r\n<p>In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, on June 2, 2020 the plaintiffs filed a motion to compel the defendants to produce information about the NYPD's use of investigative encounters and social distancing enforcement practices. The city has filed its opposition brief in response to this motion, and the monitor filed a letter opposing the plaintiffs' motion. On June 12, Judge Torres denied the plaintiffs' motion.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

Introduction \nIn August 2016, the monitor filed its Third Report: Interim Briefing on Body-Worn \nCamera Pilot Program.  That report described the research design for a randomized control trial \nof  body-worn  cameras  (BWCs)  in  the  New  York  City  Police  Department  (NYPD),  to  be \nimplemented pursuant to the requirements of the amended remedial order in Floyd v. City of New \nYork, 959 F. Supp. 2d 668 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (Remedial Order at Floyd Dkt. No. 372, Amended \nRemedial Order at Floyd Dkt. No. 522) \nIn June 2017, the monitor filed its Sixth Report, The NYPD’s Body-Worn Camera Pilot: \nResearch and Evaluation Plan.  That report described the monitor’s research and evaluation \ndesign for the BWC pilot, providing details about how the camera and control precincts were \nselected and matched and how the results of the camera experiment would be judged.  The \nNYPD launched the BWC pilot program in April 2017 and by November 2017 the pilot was \nfully implemented, with approximately 1,200 officers in 20 precincts wearing cameras for a one-\nyear period.  Those 20 precincts were matched with 20 precincts where officers were not wearing \ncameras.  The goal of the pilot program is to assess the costs and benefits of deploying cameras \nand whether deployment results in reducing unconstitutional stops and frisks.  \nOfficers in NYPD’s Housing Bureau patrolling NYCHA public housing developments in \nPolice Service Areas (PSA) were not included in the randomized control trial.  This Eighth \nReport describes the monitor’s research plan for evaluating BWCs for Housing Bureau officers. \nThe report explains the rationale and design for the evaluation as well as its limitations.  This \nreport includes technical language describing the PSA BWC quasi-experiment.  It is important to \n1 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 330-1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 4 of 19\ninclude the technical details of the research design so that outside experts can examine the design \nand, if they wish, run their own analyses with data to be made available at a later date. \nII. Randomized Control Trial of Body Worn Cameras  \nThe remedial opinion in Floyd v. City of New York and Ligon v. City of New York noted \nthe potential benefits of outfitting NYPD officers with body-worn cameras.  These potential \nbenefits included the creation of objective records of stop-and-frisk encounters, encouraging \nlawful and respectful police-citizen interaction when both parties know exchanges are recorded, \nalleviating  mistrust  between  the  NYPD  and  the  public,  and  offering  a  way  to  substantiate \nwhether NYPD officers are wrongly or rightly accused of misconduct.  The court order required \nthe federal monitor to establish procedures for the review of stop recordings by supervisors and \nsenior managers, the preservation of stop recordings, and the measurement of effectiveness of \nBWCs in reducing unconstitutional stops and frisks.  The court order also mandated the NYPD \nto work with the federal monitor to conduct a one-year pilot BWC program to determine whether \nthe benefits of the cameras outweigh their financial, administrative, and other costs and whether \nthe program should be expanded or terminated.\nThe federal monitor team developed a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the \nimplementation of BWCs in the Patrol Services Bureau (PSB).1  Briefly, 40 NYPD precincts \nwith the highest number of Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) complaints were matched \ninto 20 similar pairs based on policing, crime, and neighborhood characteristics.  All NYPD \npatrol  officers  working  in  the  third  platoon  (3  PM  –  11  AM  shift)  and  anti-crime  unit \nassignments in these 20 matched pairs were eligible to participate in the cluster randomized \n1 The Patrol Services Bureau is the bureau in the NYPD that includes patrol officers and other NYPD members \nassigned to the 77 precincts in New York City.  The Housing Bureau is the bureau within the Department that \nincludes patrol officers and other NYPD members who work in the nine PSAs in New York City.  The details of the \ncluster-randomized controlled trial design are available at http://nypdmonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017-\n06-29-MonitorsSixthReport.pdf (accessed 2/25/2018). \n2 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 330-1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 5 of 19\nexperiment.  One precinct of each matched precinct pair was randomly designated the treatment \nprecinct and assigned BWCs for a one-year study time period.  The other precinct in the matched \npair was designated the control precinct and did not receive cameras.  The implementation of the \nBWC cluster randomized experiment began on April 24, 2017 in the 34 Precinct.  The remaining \ntreatment precincts received the BWC technology in a staggered manner with the final treatment \nprecinct, Precinct 121, receiving BWCs on November 14, 2017. \nNYPD Housing Bureau officers working in the nine PSAs were scheduled to receive \nBWCs as part of a citywide rollout plan launched after the implementation of the PSB cluster \nrandomized controlled trial.  Given the small number of PSAs and the complexities associated \nwith citywide BWC implementation, it was not possible to design a randomized experimental \nevaluation of the placement of BWCs on NYPD PSA officers.  As detailed in Section V below, \nthe federal monitor team will be using two separate quasi-experimental designs to evaluate BWC \nimpacts on the provision of police services at the PSA command level and the individual officer \nlevel.  Quasi-experimental designs seek to approximate characteristics of a true experiment \nwithout the benefit of random allocation of units to treatment and control conditions.2  As such, \nquasi-experiments  do  not  have  the  same  high  degree  of  internal  validity  as  randomized \ncontrolled trials.  Nonetheless, well-designed quasi-experiments can sometimes produce results \nthat are of similar quality to randomized controlled trials.3\nIII.

In  the  58  Precincts  with  NYCHA  housing \ndevelopments, the NYPD Housing Bureau provides policing services to housing developments in \n33 Precincts (56.9% of 58) while the remaining 25 Precincts are served by the PSB.  \nFigure 1.  \nSource: New York City Police Department \nThere are 343 NYCHA housing developments4 spread throughout New York City’s five \nboroughs, covering 3.794 total square miles of land area (Table 1).  The NYPD Housing Bureau \n4 Following the structure of the data file provided to the monitor team by the NYPD (12/27/2017), the development \ncounts  were  based  on  unique  Tenant  Data  System  (TDS)  numbers  that  NYCHA  uses  to  distinguish  tenant \napplications to specific housing developments.  As such, these counts included housing developments with related \n4 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 330-1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 7 of 19\nprovides policing services to residents in 258 NYCHA housing developments (75% of 343) in 33 \nprecincts through nine PSAs in four boroughs: Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan, and Queens.  This \nincludes some 333,977 residents in 149,684 apartments.  The NYPD PSB provides policing \nservices to residents in 85 NYCHA housing developments (25% of 343) in 25 precincts in the \nfive boroughs (including the Staten Island Housing Unit).  This includes some 59,401 residents \nin 28,385 apartments. \nThe 85 NYCHA housing developments that receive policing services from the PSB \nthrough  25  precincts  are  part  of  the  cluster  randomized  controlled  trial  evaluating  the \nimplementation of BWCs on patrol officers.  Since the NYPD Housing Bureau does not provide \npatrol services through the PSAs in these precincts, these 85 housing developments will not be \nincluded in the PSA evaluation plan. \nTable 1.

Timing of the Body-Worn Camera Treament in PSAs \nThe NYPD placed BWCs on patrol officers working the third platoon (3 PM – 11 PM \nshift) and anti-crime units in 20 treatment precincts6 during their “Phase 1” implementation to \nsatisfy the requirements of the randomized experimental evaluation.  Phase 1 implementation \nstarted on April 24, 2017 and ended November 14, 2017.  During the “Phase 2” implementation, \nthe NYPD will place BWCs on all officers (including the first and second platoons) in the \nremaining commands.  Officers in the 20 control precincts matched to the 20 treatment precincts \nwill not receive BWCs until at least one full year after the implementation of BWCs in the \ntreatment precinct within their matched pairs.  Phase 2 implementation started the week of \nDecember 4, 2017 and will continue through the week of December 30, 2018. \nNYPD Housing Bureau officers in the nine PSAs will be equipped with BWCs over the \ncourse of a nearly 11-month time period (Table 4).  The PSA implementation began the week of \nFebruary 12, 2018 (PSA 8) and will end the week of December 16, 2018 (PSA 9).  The \nimplementation date of BWCs in each PSA represents the initiation of the direct treatment on \nofficers within each of these Housing Bureau commands.  As shown in Figure 1, PSA officers \ndeliver policing services to housing developments within precincts.  As such,  NYPD Housing \nBureau officers can also receive indirect treatment via their presence within a precinct that has \n6 These 20 treatment precincts are the 13, 18 (MTN), 25, 30, 34, 42, 43, 44, 47, 48, 60, 63, 67, 71, 72, 79, 102, 105, \n115, and 120.  \n8 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 330-1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 11 of 19\nalready adopted BWCs on its officers as part of the Phase 1 and 2 implementations.  The \npresence of precinct officers with BWCs at calls for service in housing developments (e.g., \nproviding back-up to PSA officers) may influence PSA officer and citizen behavior during these \nencounters.  The evaluation plan needs to consider both direct and indirect effects of BWCs on \nselected outcomes. \nTable 4.

Quasi-Experimental Designs to Estimate BWC Impacts \nThe  implementation  of  the  BWC  treatment  for  PSAs  faciliates  the  use  of  a  non-\nrandomized cluster stepped-wedge evaluation design.7  Figure 2 illustrates the basic structure of \na stepped-wedge design where all clusters eventually move from the no-treatment control group \nto the treatment group.8  In the PSA BWC evaluation, the design will include a pre-intervention \nperiod in which no PSA commands (“clusters” of officers) are exposed to the BWC treatment.  \nSubsequently, at regular intervals (the “steps”), one PSA command will cross from the no-\ntreatment control group to the BWC intervention group under evaluation.  This process will \ncontinue until all nine PSAs have crossed over to be exposed to the BWC intervention.  At the \nend of the study, there will be a period when all PSA commands are exposed to the BWC \nintervention.  Data collection will continue throughout the evaluation, so that each PSA will \ncontribute observations under both control and treatment periods. \nThe evaluation will rely on the timing of BWC treatment in PSAs and will control for \ndifferences between areas that are fixed during the study interval, such as size of housing \ndevelopments and surrounding neighborhood poverty.  Two complementary quasi-experimental \nanalyses will be used to estimate the impact of the placement of BWCs on NYPD officers \nassigned to PSAs on selected outcome measures.  The first analysis estimates BWC impacts at \nthe PSA command level by using panel regression models to analyze direct effects associated \nwith the implementation of BWCs in PSAs and indirect effects associated with the adoption of \nPSAs in surrounding precincts.   The second  analysis also  uses  panel regression models  to \nestimate  BWC  impacts  at  the  PSA  officer  level  by  exploiting  the  natural  variation  in  the \n7  Hu,  Y.,  &  Hoover,  D.R.

We  use  CCRB  complaints  as  an  exemplar \noutcome measure in the description of our quasi-experimental designs below in subsections V.A \nand V.B.9  The full range of outcome measures to be analyzed in the BWC PSA evaluation is \ndescribed in the final section.\nFigure 2. \nA. PSA Command-Level Analysis \nQuasi-experimental  interrupted  time  series  analysis,  involving  before  and  after \nmeasurements  for  a particular dependent variable, represents  a  common type of evaluation \nresearch found in criminology and criminal justice.  One of the intended purposes for doing this \ntype of quasi-experimental research is to capture longer time periods and a sufficient number of \n9 CCRB complaints are rare events and, as such, count regression models will be used to estimate the impact of the \ntreatment.  See Berk, R. and MacDonald, J. 2008. “Overdispersion and Poisson Regression.” Journal of Quantitative \nCriminology, 24 (3): 269 – 284.  The models described below serve as examples to illustrate the logic of our \nanalytical approach.  We will adjust the analyses as appropriate given the distributions of the various outcome \nvariables (e.g., we may use ordinary least squares panel regressions for normally distributed outcome measures or \nwe may decide to change monthly counts to quarterly counts if zero counts prove to be extensive in the officer data). \n11 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 330-1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 14 of 19\ndifferent events to control for various threats to validity and reliability.10  The established before-\ntreatment trend allows evaluators to predict what might have happened without the intervention.   \nThe difference between what actually happened after the intervention and the predicted outcome \nbased on the before-treatment trend helps to determine the actual treatment effect.  However, the \nestimation of BWC impacts will be limited by the absence of a no-treatment control group to \naccount for confounding factors not specified in the models below.  \nThe units of analysis in this quasi-experimental evaluation are “PSA-months” over a four \nyear period.  Monthly counts of CCRB complaints will be collected for three pre-intervention \nyears and one intervention year (N = 9 PSAs * 12 months * 4 years = 432 PSA-months).  We \nwill then use panel regression models to analyze the monthly change in complaint counts for \neach PSA command before and after the BWCs are adopted in the PSA command and in the \nsurrounding precincts, controlling for other covariates.  As such, a simplified version of the \nproposed panel regression model is as follows: \nwhere i= 1(…1) 9\t\t\t \tP�S��A= c�o�m+ma�n�d�s�, �w�it�h P��S�A+ i� c�o�n�s�is�t�in�g� �o�f� t =� �1�,+ …�,� n�� m+o�n�th+ly� o�b+se�rv��ations, and \ni\nY  is the outcome variable indicating the monthly count of CCRB complaints in a specific PSA i\nit\nduring month-year t.  The regressor PSABWC is a dummy variable identifying whether a PSA \ncommand adopted BWCs (1) or not (0), while PrecinctBWC is a dummy variable identifying \nwhether a precinct that intersects or contains the PSA adopted BWCs (1) or not (0).  The \ncoefficients β  and β  are the estimates of direct and indirect BWC treatment, respectively, on \n1 2\nCCRB complaints.  The model will also control for factors that change each month within PSAs \nthat may be correlated with CCRB complaints, such as calls for service and crime, and β\n10 Shadish, W., Cook, T., & Campbell, D.

Fixed effects for PSA (α) and year-\nit i\nmonth (δ) are included to control for common trends to all PSAs in a given month-year and \nt\nunmeasured differences between PSAs that are stable over the four-year time period.  Robust \nstandard errors clustered by PSA-month-year will be used to assure that estimates are robust to \nheteroscedasticity and unmeasured dependence at the PSA level over time. \nB. PSA Officer-Level Analysis \nThe units of analysis in this quasi-experimental evaluation are “officer-quarters” over a \nfour  year  period.    Quarterly  counts  of  CCRB  complaints  will  be  collected  for  three  pre-\nintervention years and one intervention year (N = ~2,000 PSA officers * 4 quarters * 4 years = \n96,000 officer-months).  We will then use panel regression models to analyze the quarterly \nchange in complaint counts for each PSA officer before and after the BWCs are adopted in their \nrespective PSA commands and in the surrounding precincts, controlling for other covariates. As \nsuch, a simplified version of the proposed panel regression model is as follows:   \n(2)\t\t\t\t���� = �� +����������� +��������������� +���� +μ� +�� +�� +���\nWhere i= 1… n  officers in j=1…9 PSA commands, t = 1, …, n quarterly observations, and Y\ni t ijt\nis the outcome variable indicating the count of CCRB complaints for an individual officer in a \nspecific PSA i during quarter t.  The regressor PSABWC is a dummy variable identifying whether \na  PSA  command  adopted  BWCs  (1)  or  not  (0),  while  PrecinctBWC  is  a  dummy  variable \nidentifying whether a precinct that intersects or contains the PSA adopted BWCs (1) or not (0).  \nThe coefficient β  and β  are the officer-specific effect of BWC and the indirect BWC treatment \n1 2\neffect, respectively, on CCRB complaints.  In this model β represents the vector of estimates \nrepresenting the vector of covariates that change each quarter for each officer (X), such as shift \nand area assignment.  Fixed effects for officer (µ), PSA (α), and year-quarter (δ) are included to \ni j t\n13 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 330-1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 16 of 19\ncontrol for common trends to individual officers, PSAs, and time.  Robust standard errors \nclustered by officer-PSA-quarter-year will be used. \nWe recognize that officers assigned to the nine PSAs during the one-year intervention \nperiod  may  have  had  varying  assignments  and  service  times  during  the  three-year  pre-\nintervention period.  For instance, officers may have had previous assignments that make them \nmore or less likely to use force in the execution of their duties or generate citizen complaints.  \nSome officers may not have three full years of NYPD service before assignment to the PSAs.  \nThe NYPD will provide the monitor team with pre-PSA service length and assignment duty data \nso we can adjust our individual-level panel regression models (e.g., including pre-intervention \naverages for each officer) as appropriate to consider these varying pre-intervention experiences. \nC. Outcome Measures \nThe PSA quasi-experimental designs will measure the impact of BWCs on three sets of \noutcome  measures:  the  civility  of  police-citizen  interactions,  police  activity,  and  police \nlawfulness.  The data for the study’s outcome measures will be available through official data \nsystems of the NYPD and the CCRB.  As described above, the primary analyses of these \noutcomes will involve the collection of data from  36-month pre-implementation (pre-test) and \n12-month implementation (post-test) time periods.  \n1. Impact of BWCs on the Civility of Police-Citizen Interactions \nThe available research suggests that putting BWCs on officers will improve the civility of \npolice-citizen interactions by deterring undesirable behaviors (i.e., not wanting to be recorded on \nvideo  doing  something  inappropriate  or  illegal)  and  stimulating  desirable  behaviors  (i.e., \n14 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 330-1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 17 of 19\nremembering to treat others with respect).11  Pre-test and post-test data will be collected and \nanalyzed for the following “civility/de-escalation” outcomes:  \n• CCRB complaints \n• Officer arrests with force reports \n• Officer injury reports \n• Resisting arrest data  \n• Disorderly Conduct and Obstructing Government Administration arrests and summonses \nSpecific variables in these datasets will be analyzed to determine whether BWCs influence the \ntypes of CCRB complaints, the types of force (hand strike, baton, etc.), and other relevant \nsubcategories for treatment officers and control officers over the course of the study time period.  \n2. Impact of BWCs on Police Activity \nSome observers have suggested that BWCs might cause officers to be less active or more \nreluctant to initiate contacts with citizens, instead focusing most of their time on dispatched \ncalls.12  Police officers in treatment and comparison groups will be compared over pre-test and \npost-test time periods to determine whether BWCs impact their policing activity.  Police activity \nmetrics will include:  \n• Monthly number of responses to citizen calls for service (data available by unit only \nrather than by individual officer) \n• Monthly number of officer-initiated calls (data available by unit only rather than by \nindividual officer) \n• Monthly number of complaints by citizens of crime (61 reports) \n• Monthly number of domestic incident reports \n• Monthly number of arrests  \n• Monthly number of summons \n11 Barak Ariel, William Farrar, and Alex Sutherland. 2015.

The monitor team will also examine whether the BWCs influence the likelihood of an \narrest or summons in situations where a crime complaint report has been made, comparing \ntreatment officers to control officers. \n3. Impact of BWCs on Police Lawfulness \nStop reports provide an opportunity to examine whether BWCs impact the lawfulness of \npolice interactions with citizens.  The monitor team will be auditing stop reports to ensure NYPD \ncompliance with the Constitution and provisions of the Floyd., Ligon, and Davis orders.  The \nmonitor team will use cluster random sampling techniques to select stop reports each quarter to \nensure a representative sample of stop reports from the annual citywide population of stop \nreports.   \nIn order to assess the impact of BWCs on police lawfulness in the PSAs, it will be \nessential to include stop reports prepared in the PSAs during one-year pre-intervention and one-\nyear intervention periods.  The monitor team will select random samples of 300 pre-intervention-\nperiod and 300 intervention-period stop reports that are representative of overall PSA stop \nreports during these two periods.  The monitor team will analyze the results of reviews of PSA \nstop reports completed in pre-intervention and intervention periods to determine whether BWCs \ninfluence the justifications  provided for the stops,  frisks,  and searches of subjects  in these \ninteractions (examining potential Fourth Amendment issues).   \nThe  monitor  team  will  also  use  stop  report  data  to  examine  patterns  in  the  racial \ncomposition of stopped subjects to determine whether the presence of BWCs influences the \nshare of minority residents  stopped by officers  in the PSAs  during the intervention period \n16 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 330-1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 19 of 19\nrelative to the pre-intervention period (examining potential Fourteenth Amendment issues).  We \nwill examine other subject characteristics, such as gender, age, and stop justification.  Our BWC \nimpact analyses will build upon models and methods used in prior research appraising racial \ndisparities in NYPD stop reports in PSAs and immediately surrounding neighborhoods.13\nWith  respect  to  trespass  enforcement,  the  monitor  team  will  be  examining  trespass \nenforcement in the PSAs during the pre-intervention and intervention periods.  This examination \nwill depend in part on the availability of data in a readily available format.  Accounting for this \ncaveat, the monitor team is planning to look at the percentage of trespass arrests for which there \nwas  a completed Trespass Crimes  Fact Sheet; counts  of declined prosecutions  for trespass \narrests; trespass arrests identified by QAD as starting as a stop, but for which a stop report was \nnot completed; trespass arrest reports identified by QAD as not containing prima facie evidence \nof probable cause; and reports of stops for trespass in TAP and NYCHA buildings.  The monitor \nteam will also analyze the results of QAD audits of police-initiated enforcement arrests to \ndetermine whether there are any differences in the number of unrecorded stops in the PSAs \nduring the pre-intervention and intervention periods. \n13 See Jeffrey Fagan, Garth Davies, and Adam Carlis. 2012.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND \nThis is the court-appointed monitor’s first report regarding the work \ndone pursuant to court orders in three federal lawsuits concerning New York \nPolice  Department  (NYPD  or  Department)  practices  and  policies  with \nrespect to encounters between the police and civilians.   \nSpecifically,  the  three  cases  challenged  the  NYPD’s  practices  and \npolicies concerning “stop, question and frisk,” and also criminal trespass \nenforcement  in  and  around  certain  private  multiple  dwelling  buildings \nenrolled in the Trespass Affidavit Program (TAP) and in New York City \nHousing Authority (NYCHA) buildings.  Floyd v. City of New York, Ligon \nv. City of New York, and Davis v. City of New York.  TAP (also known as \nOperation Clean Halls) is a program in which building owners authorize the \nNYPD  to  conduct  patrol  activities  inside  and  around  their  buildings, \nincluding,  in  some  buildings,  floor-to-floor  inspections,  called  interior \npatrols or vertical patrols. \nIn 2013, the district court ruled that the NYPD’s “stop, question and \nfrisk” practices violated the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment, \nand ordered remedial measures.  The court named a monitor, Peter Zimroth, \nto develop and implement those remedies in consultation with the NYPD \n1 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 12 of 97\nI. Introduction and Background  \nand the plaintiffs and to assess and report to the court on compliance.  The \nCity appealed the district court’s actions and obtained a stay of the remedial \norder.  In early 2014, the City and the plaintiffs resolved the Floyd case and \npart of the Ligon case.  The City moved to withdraw its appeal without \ncontesting liability or the court’s related findings. \nThe City and the plaintiffs agreed that the measures set out in the \ndistrict court’s 2013 order would be implemented  but with an additional \nprovision  removing  the  monitor’s  and  court’s  supervision  after  specified \nperiods of time if substantial compliance is achieved.  The NYPD’s five \nunions moved to intervene to obtain the status of parties and continue the \nCity’s appeal.  On October 31, 2014, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals \naffirmed the district court’s denial of the unions’ motion to intervene and \nremanded the case back to the district court, which accepted the parties’ \nresolution.   \nThe monitorship, which had been on hold for more than a year, began \nits  work  again  in  early  November  2014.    Judge  Analisa  Torres  is  now \noverseeing the implementation of the Floyd and Ligon remedies. \nThe City and the plaintiffs have now settled the Davis case, and the \ncourt gave final approval to the Davis settlement on April 28, 2015.  The \nDavis  case  is  now  part  of  the  remedial  process  underway  in  Floyd  and \n2 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 13 of 97\nI. Introduction and Background  \nLigon.  Although there is substantial overlap among the issues raised in \nDavis, Floyd and Ligon, the Davis case also focuses on officers’ interactions \nwith residents and guests in public housing and on the interplay between the \nenforcement of criminal trespass laws and the enforcement of NYCHA’s \n“House Rules.” \nThe measures required by the court orders in Ligon and Floyd include \nrevisions  to  NYPD  policies,  training,  supervision,  auditing,  handling  of \ncomplaints and discipline, and performance objectives, and a pilot program \nfor body-worn cameras.  Remedies in the Davis case are consistent with the \nremedies  in  Ligon  and  Floyd  but  also  include  remedies  relating  to \nenforcement of the criminal trespass laws, including a revised NYPD form \nfor trespass arrests and changes in NYCHA’s “House Rules.”   \nIn  addition  to  these  measures,  which  the  court  labeled  as  the \n“Immediate  Reforms,”  the  court  included  a  “Joint  Remedial  Process”  to \nobtain  input  from  the  community  and  criminal  justice  stakeholders  on \nadditional potential reforms, which is being overseen by Judge Ariel Belen \n(ret.).    \nThis effort has begun at a difficult and contentious period in police-\ncommunity  relations.    This  is  also  a  moment  of  opportunity.    Police \nCommissioner  William  J.  Bratton  has  acknowledged  that  the  NYPD’s \n3 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 14 of 97\nI. Introduction and Background  \noveruse  and  misuse  of  stop,  question  and  frisk  helped  to  fuel  mistrust \nbetween  the  NYPD  and  minority  and  immigrant  communities,  and \nrecognized the need to repair the breach.   \nGetting “stop, question and frisk” right is a vital step in the healing \nprocess.  \nThese  are  some  principles  and  observations  that  have  guided  the \nmonitor’s work so far: \n1.  The NYPD and the plaintiffs have agreed that certain changes \nin  NYPD  policies  and  practices  need  to  be  made.    The  roles  of  the \nparticipants in the current remedial process differ from what they would be \nif  these  cases  were  still  in  litigation.  The  goal  of  this  process  is  not  to \nadvance adversarial positions.  It is to implement the changes agreed to and \nincorporated in the court orders and to improve how the police function as \nguardians in a democratic society.  This is a responsibility shared by the \npolice and all other participants in the remedial process. \n \n2.  As the court orders make clear, the monitor’s role is not to \ndisplace the police commissioner.  Under the City’s charter, one person is \ncharged  with  running  the  NYPD—the  police  commissioner,  who  is \nappointed by the City’s chief executive officer, the mayor.   \n4 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 15 of 97\nI. Introduction and Background  \n3.  Although the monitor and his team are not substitutes for police \nofficials,  the  team  is  willing  to  provide  technical  support  and  assistance \nwhen desired by the NYPD.  Members of the monitor team have substantial \nexperience in law enforcement, including as police officers and executives.  \nThe academic members of the team have worked with police departments \nthroughout the country (including the NYPD) and have expertise in areas \nrelated to the court’s orders.  Substantive assistance has already been given, \nfor example, in planning for the implementation of the pilot program on \nbody-worn cameras. \n \n4.  Achieving  the  agreed-upon  changes  of  NYPD  policy  and \npractices will not be easy.  The basic outlines of these changes have already \nbeen agreed to by the NYPD and have been incorporated in the court orders.  \nThe work of the monitor involves filling in the outlines consistent with those \norders and  in  consultation  with  the parties.    It is primarily  the  NYPD’s \nresponsibility to generate proposals to meet the requirements of the court \norders.  The plaintiffs can suggest revisions or generate proposals of their \nown, as they have already done.   \nThe monitor will seek agreement among the parties, but ultimately it \nis  the  monitor’s  responsibility  to  decide  which  recommendations  are \n5 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 16 of 97\nI. Introduction and Background  \nsubmitted to the court for approval.  This task will be informed by what the \nmonitor team has learned and will learn about the organizational and other \nlegitimate needs of the NYPD and its officers, as well as by the comments \nand insights of plaintiffs.  The monitor will also need to conduct periodic \naudits and other reviews and advise the court on progress. \n \n5.  It is critical as well to obtain input from others who have a stake \nin the implementation of the changes.  To this end, the monitor and his team \nhave  met  with  union  officials,  individual  police  officers  and  groups  of \nofficers, community groups and community leaders, elected and appointed \nofficials,  advocacy  organizations  and  their  clientele,  minority  police \nfraternal organizations, and individuals (and their families) who have had \npersonal experience with the NYPD’s “stop, question and frisk” practices \nand trespass arrests.   \n \n6.  The court did not order the cessation of stop, question and frisk.  \nSince at least as early as 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court has permitted this \nlaw  enforcement  technique  so  long  as  the  officer’s  actions  meet  the \nrequirements of the U.S. Constitution.  When used lawfully and wisely, it \ncan be an important tool for police officers.  Nor do the court orders mandate \n6 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 17 of 97\nI. Introduction and Background  \nan end to the City’s programs for policing public and some private housing.  \nAlthough  the  court  orders  do  require  some  changes  in  the  way  these \nprograms are carried out, the orders have not changed federal constitutional \nlaw in these areas.  Rather, the orders require clearer statements of the law \nso that officers can better understand what is and is not permissible, and call \nfor more robust ways for the Department to oversee those practices.  \n \n7.  We are mindful that since 2011 the number of stop, question \nand frisk encounters as reported by the NYPD has diminished significantly.  \nHowever, that reported decline in numbers does not “fix” the problem.  The \nfocus  should  not  be  on  the  number  of  stops  per  se,  but  rather  on  the \nlawfulness of those stops and whether these law enforcement encounters are \nconducted  in  accordance  with  the  Department’s  principles  of  “courtesy, \nprofessionalism and respect.”    \nIt is not the monitor’s role to determine whether there are too many or \ntoo  few  stops.    That  said,  in  our  work  thus  far,  we  have  heard  two \nexplanations for the decline in numbers that do relate to our work.   \nFirst, one concern is that the data being reported may not be entirely \naccurate  because  some  officers  are  making  stops  without  appropriately \ndocumenting them.  Recent NYPD audit results show that this is happening, \n7 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 18 of 97\nI. Introduction and Background  \nat least to some extent.  (See Section II.E.1 below.)  The NYPD recognizes \nthat undocumented stops are a serious issue and that more work needs to be \ndone  to  determine  the  extent  of  the  problem  and  ensure  proper  record-\nkeeping.  The monitor team will have continued involvement in this matter.  \nThe integrity of the data being reported by the Department is essential to its \ncredibility and therefore its proper functioning in a democratic society. \nSecond, in interviews and informal conversations, the monitor and \nmembers of his team have been told by officers at ranks from patrol officer \nto supervisor that officers on the street may be declining to stop, question \nand frisk when it would be lawful and prudent to make the stop.  Among the \nreasons  suggested  are  that  officers  are  not  confident  or  have  been \nmisinformed  about,  among  other  things,  what  they  are  authorized  to  do \nunder the law, what their supervisors expect of them, what their personal \nlegal  liability  might  be  and  under  what  circumstances  discipline  will  be \nadministered.  \nWe do not know the extent to which officers may be declining to \nmake lawful, appropriate stops because of these uncertainties.  To the extent \nit is happening, though, it is not a healthy state of affairs for police officers \nor communities.  One of the goals of the court orders and agreements, and \ntherefore this monitorship, is to clarify areas of uncertainty so that police \n8 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 19 of 97\nI. Introduction and Background  \nofficers can go about their difficult tasks with a clearer understanding of \ntheir lawful authority. \n \n8.  Making the necessary changes will take time.  The NYPD is a \ncomplex  organization  with  roughly  35,000  sworn  officers  and  17,000 \ncivilian  employees.    The  process  for  making  changes  in  policy  can \nsometimes be difficult and cumbersome.  Implementing new policies in the \nfield is harder still.  Whether written policies actually affect conduct on the \nstreet  depends  on,  among  other  things,  how  35,000  officers  (plus  some \ncivilians) are trained, the incentives and disincentives officers have to follow \nthe  new  policies  and  the  expectations  that  their  superiors  communicate.  \nThen the NYPD needs to find ways to measure implementation: whether the \nchanges are actually being carried out by the officers on the street and by \ntheir supervisors.  These are among the significant challenges that the NYPD \nhas committed itself to meet.  \nThis report describes the work thus far, assessing that work and the \nsteps ahead.   Of course, there is still much to be done—accomplishing \n9 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 20 of 97\nI. A. Monitor Team \nchange in this sphere is a large and complex undertaking.  It is the monitor’s \nview that this initial period has seen good progress.  \nA.  The Monitor Team \nThe monitor team consists of people with substantial experience in \nareas directly related to the court orders and the parties’ agreement.  Peter \nZimroth has been a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the \nSouthern  District  of  New  York,  the  chief  assistant  district  attorney  in \nManhattan and the City’s corporation counsel, as well as a defense lawyer.  \nRichard Jerome was the deputy monitor in two police reform settlements in \nCincinnati, a deputy associate attorney general in the U.S. Department of \nJustice and a project manager for the Pew Charitable Trusts for its public \nsafety performance project.  Anthony Braga is Professor of Evidence-Based \nCriminology at Rutgers University and a senior research fellow in criminal \njustice  policy  at  Harvard  University.    Edward  Davis  was  the  police \ncommissioner for the Boston Police Department for seven years and before \nthat was the superintendent of the Lowell Police Department.  In his thirty-\nfive years of policing, Davis rose through the ranks of the Lowell Police \nDepartment, holding positions as a patrol officer, detective supervisor, and \nhead of a local, state and federal narcotics and organized crime task force.\n10 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 21 of 97\nI. B. Monitor’s Activities \n  Jennifer Eberhardt is a social psychologist at Stanford University and a \nnational expert on implicit bias.  John MacDonald is chair of the Department \nof Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania and previously was at the \nRAND Corporation.  James McCabe held several significant posts in the \nNYPD, including commanding officer of the Police Academy, and is now a \nprofessor at Sacred Heart University.  Jane Perlov began her policing career \nat the NYPD as a patrol officer, commanded two precincts in Manhattan and \nserved as chief of detectives in Queens.  After retiring from the NYPD, she \nserved  as  the  Secretary  of  Public  Safety  for  the  Commonwealth  of \nMassachusetts and as the police chief in Raleigh, North Carolina.   More \ncomplete biographies are in Appendix 1.   \nB.  The Monitor’s Activities \nSoon after beginning his work, the monitor convened a meeting of \ncounsel for the NYPD, the City and the plaintiffs (the first of monthly all-\nparties  meetings).   The  monitor  worked  with  the  parties  to  agree  on \nmilestones to be met to satisfy the requirements of the court orders.  The \ngoal  was  to  make  sure  that  the  parties  and  the  monitor  had  the  same \nunderstanding of those requirements. \nThe parties also agreed on a process for the development of remedial \nmeasures, and the court issued orders dealing with how and when court \n11 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 22 of 97\nI. B. Monitor’s Activities \napproval should be sought.  Drafts of new or modified policies, procedures, \ntraining  materials  or  other  changes  are  initially  proposed  by  the  NYPD.  \nThose  drafts  are  sent  to  the  monitor  and  plaintiffs’  counsel,  who,  after \nconsulting  their  experts,  make  comments  and  suggestions  or  submit \nproposals of their own.  Sometimes those suggestions are adopted by the \nNYPD.  When they are not, the monitor decides what to recommend to the \ncourt for approval.  Any party then has the right to object to the monitor’s \nrecommendation, in which case the court decides.   \nDuring  this  process,  the  monitor  and  the  parties  communicate \nfrequently with one another to make sure that all parties understand why \neach  party  has  made  a  suggestion  or  has  not  agreed  to  one.  This \ncommunication helps to minimize misinformation and lower the level of \npossible mistrust among the parties.   \nIn addition, it was important to find ways for other stakeholders to \nprovide input without making the process unduly cumbersome and without \ntransforming  the  remedial  process  into  continued  litigation.    With  the \nconsent of the monitor and the NYPD, and with appropriate confidentiality \nassurances, plaintiffs’ counsel have been permitted to share draft documents \nwith some of their constituent client groups and then use that input to inform \nrecommendations made to the NYPD and the monitor.  Likewise, under \n12 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 23 of 97\nI. B. Monitor’s Activities \nsimilar  confidentiality  provisions,  the  NYPD  may  provide  drafts  to  the \npolice unions to seek their input.  Independently, the monitor has met with \nall  the  police  unions  and  with  many  advocacy  groups,  including  those \nconsulted by the plaintiffs.   \nSince the monitor began his work in November 2014, he and the other \nmembers of the team have spent significant time with NYPD executives and \nmembers  of the service  at  every  level, from  the police  commissioner to \npatrol  officers.    In  the  fall  of  2014,  the  NYPD  created  a  new  Risk \nManagement  Bureau  to  establish  a  centralized  compliance  and  risk \nassessment function at the Department and identify and correct weaknesses \nin  policies,  procedures  and  practices.   The  Risk  Management  Bureau  is \nresponsible for coordinating the Department’s responses to the monitor’s \nrequests  and  has  set  up  meetings  and  collected  the  data  and  documents \nneeded for the monitoring effort.  Meetings with NYPD executives and units \nhave included the First Deputy Commissioner, Chief of Department, Chief \nof Patrol, Housing Bureau, Police Academy, Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB), \nOffice  of  Management  Analysis  and  Planning  (OMAP),  Information \nTechnology,  Department  Advocates  Office  (DAO),  Trials,  Collaborative \nPolicing, Performance Analysis Unit, Community Affairs, Operations, Labor \nRelations and Legal Bureau, among others.  \n13 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 24 of 97\nI. B. Monitor’s Activities \nIn addition to the meetings with police executives, the monitor team \nhas visited precincts and spoken to officers at all levels from commanding \nofficer to patrol officer, attended focus groups of police officers to hear their \nconcerns, observed training of recruits and officers as well as training of \nPolice Academy staff, and gone on ride-alongs.  All this has allowed the \nteam to learn more about the operations of the Department and understand \nhow  remedial  measures  might  be  implemented  and  their  impact  on \noperations.  The monitor has also met with representatives of each of the \nNYPD’s  unions,  the  Civilian  Complaint  Review  Board  (CCRB),  the \nInspector General, the director of the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, \nCity  Council  members  and  members  of  the  NYPD’s  Training  Advisory \nCommittee.  The monitor and his team, sometimes with Judge Belen, have \nmet with more than 100 community  members and organizations, elected \nofficials,  district  attorneys,  public  defenders  and  other  stakeholders \nthroughout the city.  The monitor also meets regularly with counsel for the \nplaintiffs,  the  NYPD  and  the  City  Law  Department  to  discuss  progress, \naddress issues and discuss the next steps to be taken.   \nIn  addition  to  these  meetings,  the  monitor  team  has  obtained  its \ninformation in other ways.  A significant amount of the monitor’s work has \ninvolved  reviewing  NYPD  policies,  procedures,  operations  orders  and \n14 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 25 of 97\nII. Requirements of the Court Orders  \n    A. Finest Message for Floyd and Ligon \nmemoranda,  forms,  reports,  files,  and  other  documents  and  data.    The \nmonitor  team  will  be  reviewing,  among  others,  the  Department’s  stop \nreports (previously called UF-250s), memo books and activity logs, trespass \ncrime  fact  sheets  and  other  data  on  trespass  arrests,  reports  of  citizen \ncomplaint  investigations,  and  documentation  of  any  interventions  or \ndisciplinary  actions  taken  in  response  to  unconstitutional  actions.    The \nmonitor  team  will  develop  an  appropriate  sampling  methodology  for \nselecting files and reports to review and analyze.  The team has also begun \nreviewing the NYPD’s audits and monitoring of its own procedures, files \nand recordings.  \nII.  THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COURT ORDERS,  \nPRELIMINARY FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS \nA.  Finest Messages for Floyd and Ligon \nThe NYPD was required to issue a message to all members of the \nservice describing the reforms and the constitutional standards for stops and \nfrisks.  The court directed that the NYPD transmit two “Finest” messages, to \nbe read at successive roll calls of officers, describing the changes agreed \nupon in Floyd and Ligon.  A Finest message is one way the Department \ncommunicates with its officers.  \nThe  NYPD  drafted  the  two  messages  and  submitted  them  to  the \nmonitor and the parties for review.  After a significant number of drafts and\n15 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 26 of 97\nII. B. Department Policies and Procedures \n    1. Written Policies Concerning Stops and Frisks  \ncomments from the parties and the monitor, the parties agreed on Finest \nmessages  for  Floyd  and  Ligon,  which  were  approved  by  the  court  in \nFebruary.  The NYPD began publishing these messages in early March.  The \nDepartment reports that each message was read at ten consecutive roll calls \nso that they were presented to all members of the service.  The NYPD also \nsent the Finest messages to every officer at the rank of captain and above via \nthe  NYPD’s  email  system.    Members of  the  monitor  team  observed the \nFinest message being read at roll calls in two precincts.  \n The  NYPD  has  met  the  requirements  for  this  remedial  measure.  \nHaving observed the Finest message being read, however, both the monitor \nand  the  NYPD  recognize  that  there  may  be  more  effective  ways  of \npresenting materials to officers at roll calls and in other venues. \nB.  Department Policies and Procedures \n1.  Written Policies Concerning Stops and Frisks \nIn 1968, in Terry v. Ohio, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the \npolice practice of stopping and detaining individuals and frisking them for \nweapons or other dangerous items was lawful as long as the police met the \nrequirements of the Constitution.  That federal constitutional principle is \nbeing applied in these cases.  Following Terry, in People v. DeBour, the \nNew York State Court of Appeals adopted standards for police encounters \n16 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 27 of 97\nII. B. Department Policies and Procedures \n    1. Written Policies Concerning Stops and Frisks  \nless intrusive than a stop or an arrest.  The Court of Appeals described the \nlevels of knowledge required by the officer and the amount of interference \npermissible for a police officer to approach and question a person.  For \nexample, in order to approach a person simply to ask him or her questions (a \n“request for information”), the officer does not have to suspect criminality \nbut does need an “objective credible reason” (that is, a reason not based on \nwhim or bias).  If the officer wants to ask “accusatory” questions (“common \nlaw right of inquiry”), the officer needs further justification—i.e., that there \nmay  be  “criminal  activity  afoot.”    These  guidelines  for  encounters  less \nintrusive than stops govern situations not addressed in Terry and therefore \nadd some complexity.  The Court of Appeals’ decision in DeBour created \nthe  standards  by  which  all  investigative  encounters  in  New  York  are \nassessed—(1) requests for information, (2) common law right of inquiry, (3) \nstops, questions and frisks, and (4) arrests.  \nThe court in Floyd dealt primarily with “stop, question and frisk,” and \nrecognized  that  it  could  be  an  important  tool  to  further  public  safety.  \nConsistent  with  Terry,  the  court  did  not  hold  that  the  practice  was \nimpermissible or prohibit its use.  The court held that the practice had to \nmeet the requirements of the Constitution.   \n17 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 28 of 97\nII. B. Department Policies and Procedures \n    1. Written Policies Concerning Stops and Frisks  \nThus, the changes required to be made to the NYPD’s written policies \nand procedures are not new legal requirements: the court orders require only \nthat the legal standards be stated correctly and clearly.  Clarity is important \nbecause officers  should have  confidence  that they  understand  when it  is \npermissible to stop, question and frisk people and when it is not.  If officers \nare uncertain about their lawful authority, they may stop someone when they \nshould not, or forgo stopping someone when it would be lawful and prudent \nto do so.  Both these outcomes lead to a diminution of public safety and \nconfidence in the police.  \nMilestones \nThe NYPD’s policy regarding stop, question and frisk is written in \nSection 212-11 of the NYPD Patrol Guide (P.G.).  This Patrol Guide section \ndescribes the procedures to be followed when an officer stops a person based \non reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, is committing or is \nabout to commit a felony or Penal Law misdemeanor.  The current version \nfocuses almost entirely on the steps officers and superiors should take after \nwhat is assumed to be a lawful stop.  The procedures do not give guidance \nabout the legal standards or the degree of knowledge an officer must have to \nmake a stop lawful, do not give guidance about the degree of knowledge \nnecessary  for  the  encounters  governed  by  DeBour,  do  not  distinguish \n18 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 29 of 97\nII. B. Department Policies and Procedures \n    1. Written Policies Concerning Stops and Frisks  \nbetween the legal requirements governing stops and those governing frisks \nand  searches,  and  give  only  limited  guidance  as  to  the  responsibility  of \nsupervisors.  In short, as the NYPD itself recognizes, the current version of \nP.G.  212-11  is  not  sufficiently  helpful  to  officers  on  the  street  or  their \nsupervisors.   \nThe changes required by the agreed-upon court orders include:  \n(1) The Patrol Guide must state what constitutes a stop; when a stop \nmay be conducted; when a frisk may be conducted; and when a search may \nbe conducted.  \n(2)  The  Patrol  Guide  must  include  a  definition  of  “reasonable \nsuspicion,” the standard needed for a stop based on Terry (that the person \nhas committed, is committing or is about to commit a felony or Penal Law \nmisdemeanor). \n(3)  The  Patrol  Guide  must  state  clearly  that  officers  must  have \nseparate reasonable suspicion that a person is armed and dangerous in order \nto conduct a frisk of that person.  The court noted that some officers were \nnot aware of the different standards for a stop and for a frisk, and some \nofficers assumed that reasonable suspicion for a stop automatically provided \nthe basis for a frisk.  \n19 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 30 of 97\nII. B. Department Policies and Procedures \n    1. Written Policies Concerning Stops and Frisks  \n(4) The Patrol Guide must require officers to document the stop and \nreasonable suspicion, and, if conducted, the frisk, on both a stop report form \n(formerly called a UF-250) and in their activity logs. \n(5)  The  Patrol  Guide  must  require  supervisory  review  of  stops, \nincluding review of the constitutionality of the stop, not just that a stop \nreport  form  was  filled  out.    The  Patrol  Guide  must  also  provide  for \nsupervisors  to  identify  officers  needing  further  training  and/or  potential \ndiscipline.  \nStatus and Assessment \nThe NYPD has drafted a revised P.G. 212-11, and the monitor and \nplaintiffs have reviewed the draft and worked with the NYPD to reach an \nagreed-upon procedure.  The revised P.G. 212.11 is close to being completed \nas a final recommendation of the monitor and submitted to the court for \napproval.  Once the new procedure is approved, it will be published and \ndisseminated to members of the service, and officers will be trained on the \nnew policy.  There will be additional training for all of the new procedures \ndeveloped by the NYPD and approved by the court. \nThe  draft  P.G.  212-11  currently  under  review  deals  with  the \ninadequacies  of  the  current  Patrol  Guide  section  and  provides  guidance \nabout  the  degree  of  knowledge  necessary  for  the  different  levels  of \n20 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 31 of 97\nII.

It requires documentation of \nall stops and makes more explicit the responsibilities of supervising officers \nup the  chain  of command.    And  it  makes clear  that  officers  in  need of \ntraining  or  possible  discipline  should  be  identified,  but  also  states  that, \nordinarily, isolated cases of good-faith mistakes made by officers trying to \ndo their jobs will be dealt with by training at the command level and not by \ndiscipline.   \n2.  Racial Profiling Policies \nMilestones \nThe NYPD’s policy prohibiting racial profiling is set out in Section \n203-25 of the Patrol Guide.  The court orders provide that the revised Patrol \nGuide procedure must include a definition of racial  profiling stating that \nrace, ethnicity or national origin may be considered by officers in taking \npolice enforcement action only when it is part of a specific and reliable \nsuspect description.  This is not new law; it is based on the Fourteenth \nAmendment of the U.S. Constitution.  \nStatus and Assessment \nThe NYPD has prepared a revised P.G. 203-25 and the parties and \nmonitor have provided comments.  The Patrol Guide procedure prohibiting \nracial profiling is close to being completed and submitted to the court for \n21 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 32 of 97\nII. B. Department Policies and Procedures \n                      \n          3. Trespass Affidavit Policies    \n \napproval as a final recommendation of the monitor.  The revised P.G. 203-25 \ncurrently under review addresses the requirements of the court’s orders.  The \nnew procedure will state that police action, including stops, frisks, arrests or \nother law enforcement actions, may not be motivated, even in part, by the \nactual or perceived color, ethnicity or national origin of an individual.  Race \nmay be used only if it is part of a reliable and specific suspect description \nthat  includes  not  just  race,  gender  and  age,  but  other  identifying \ncharacteristics or information. \nThe new procedure will also include a description of Section 14-151 \nof the New York City Administrative Code prohibiting bias-based profiling. \nThe  Administrative Code includes demographic categories  in  addition to \nrace, color and national origin:  creed, age, alienage or citizenship status, \ngender, sexual orientation, disability and housing status. \n3.  Trespass Affidavit Program (TAP) Policies \nMilestones \nThe court orders require a revised NYPD procedure that specifies the \ncircumstances  in  which  it  is  permissible  for  an  officer  to  stop  a  person \noutside a building enrolled in the TAP on suspicion of criminal trespass.  \nStops inside and outside TAP buildings must comply with the revised stop, \nquestion  and  frisk  policies  noted  above  (P.G.  212-11).    The  orders  also \n22 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 33 of 97\nII. B. Department Policies and Procedures \n                     \n               4. Documenting a Stop on a Stop Report Form     \n \nrequire the NYPD to amend its procedures to state that “mere presence” in a \nTAP building, or entry into or exit from a TAP building, does not constitute \nan “objective credible reason” for a DeBour Level 1 approach and request \nfor information.  Section 212-59 is the Patrol Guide section that governs \nstops in and around TAP buildings.   \nStatus and Assessment \nThe current P.G. 212-59 does not include the language required by the \ncourt orders and the parties’ agreements.  The NYPD has prepared a revised \nP.G. 212-59 to address this requirement, and the plaintiffs have provided the \nmonitor with their comments and suggested edits to the procedures.  The \nrevised Patrol Guide will apply not just to the Bronx—the borough to which \nthe preliminary injunction issued in Ligon was limited—but citywide. \nThe court’s decision on the preliminary injunction in Ligon applied \nonly to criminal trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx.  The \nLigon plaintiffs and the City and NYPD are still in negotiations over other \nissues not yet resolved by the court’s orders.  The completion of a new P.G. \n212-59 may be deferred while those negotiations are ongoing.   \n4.  Documenting a Stop on a Stop Report Form  \nThe court orders require changes to the documentation of stops by \nNYPD officers.  The current P.G. 212-11 requires officers to complete a stop \n23 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 34 of 97\nII. B.

The current form contains a \nseries of checkboxes used to describe the basis for the stop.  The court found \nthat these checkboxes, standing alone, did not provide sufficient information \nto  determine  whether  a  stop  was  based  on  reasonable  suspicion.    In \nparticular, the court found the checkboxes for “furtive movement” and “high \ncrime  area,”  which  had  been  used  excessively,  do  not  provide  that \ninformation.   \nThe court orders require the NYPD to revise the stop report form to \naddress  the  deficiencies  identified  at  trial,  including  the  addition  of  a \nnarrative section on the form where the officer must record, in his or her \nown words, the basis for the stop and a separate narrative section supporting \nthe  basis  for  the  frisk,  if  one  was  conducted.    Although  these  narrative \nsections are a change from the current stop report form, similar narratives \nwere included in prior stop forms used by the NYPD; and the officer is \ncurrently required to write similar narratives in his or her activity log. \nDocumenting an officer’s actions in making a stop is important for \nseveral reasons.  Proper documentation provides detail so that an officer will \nhave sufficient information to refresh his or her memory if called to testify \nabout the incident.  It enables the officer’s direct supervisor and others in the \nNYPD  to  review  the  stop  and  assess  whether  the  officer  had  sufficient \n24 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 35 of 97\nII.

For  example,  requiring  more  information  has \nbenefits for review and analysis; but that will make the form more difficult \nfor officers to use in the field—the form will take more time to complete and \nperhaps need to be larger, which, in turn, might create logistical challenges \nfor officers using it on patrol.  Compliance with the court orders is essential, \nbut there is no one right way to design a stop report form, and it should not \nbe more complicated than necessary.  \nMilestones \nIn accordance with the court orders and the parties’ agreements, the \nnew stop report form must include space for narratives describing (1) the \nreasons for the stop, (2) the reasons for the frisk, if conducted, and (3) the \nreasons for the search, if conducted.  The court orders also require that the \ncheckboxes for “Reasons for the Stop” be simplified and improved and that \n25 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 36 of 97\nII.

Documenting a Stop on a Stop Report Form                         \n \nthe check boxes “furtive movement” and “high crime area” be eliminated.  \nThese boxes did not describe in any detail the reasons why the officer found \nthe person’s movement suspicious or what “area” was referred to.  The form \nwill provide other places for the officer to record his or her observations \nconcerning these factors—for example, in the narrative sections.  In addition \nto revising the stop report form, the NYPD must also require officers to \ninclude in their activity logs the reasons for the stop and, if conducted, the \nfrisk.  \nThe  court  also  urged  the  NYPD  to  consider  a  receipt  or  card  to \nprovide a person stopped with the reason for the stop and the officer’s badge \nnumber, and information about how and where to file a complaint.  The \nNYPD currently has a receipt form, but it does not include the officer’s \nname or badge number and does not provide the specific reason for the stop.  \nIt states only “common reasons for a stop.”  This form began as part of a \npilot program in 2009 and was implemented citywide in 2010.  All precincts \nare supposed to have these forms available for officers, but it is not required \nthat officers use them and it is not clear to what extent they do.   \nStatus and Assessment \nTwo versions of a new stop report form have been drafted and will be \npiloted in seven commands: five precincts, one housing police service area \n26 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 37 of 97\nII.

Documenting a Stop on a Stop Report Form                         \n \n(PSA)  and  one  transit  district  (TD).    Both  forms  include  the  same \ninformation, but they are different sizes.  One is the same size as the existing \nform and fits into an officer’s memo book without being folded.  The larger \nversion is 8 x 14 inches and will need to be folded into four to fit in the \nmemo book.  It has  more space for the narratives and contains detailed \ninstructions on the back of the form, but it may be more difficult for officers \nto use.  (The two stop report forms are attached as Appendix 2.) \nThe pilot program will evaluate which size works best, how the forms \nare completed, whether one format or the other is easier to use, and whether \nofficers are more likely to use one form or the other.  The evaluation will \ninclude officer surveys, focus group discussions, review of the reports for \naccuracy, legibility and completeness, and an analysis of the description of \nthe basis for the stop and any frisk.   \nThe pilot started  in July and is expected to last for ninety days.  The \nNYPD has conducted training in the pilot precincts for officers, supervisors, \ndata entry staff and staff of the Quality Assurance Division (QAD).  QAD \nwill use this pilot to test ways in which it can perform more robust audits.  \nThe training for the pilot includes a refresher on the law of stop, question \nand frisk, as well as instruction on the completion and processing of the \nform.\n27 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 38 of 97\nII.

Davis/NYCHA Policies    \n \nThe NYPD also has prepared a revised “tear-off receipt.”  Under the \ncurrent NYPD stop procedures, P.G. 212-11, officers are given the option of \nproviding  the  receipt  to  persons  stopped;  after  the  new  P.G.  212-11  is \napproved,  officers  will  offer  the  form  to  persons  stopped  who  are  not \narrested or given a summons (absent exigent circumstances).  Officers in the \npilot  precincts  testing  the  new  stop  report  form  will  also  pilot  the  new \nreceipt.   \nThe NYPD’s stop report pilot will assess whether the current draft of \nthe new stop report form should be revised in any way before it is finalized.  \nA final version of the new stop report will be proposed to the monitor and \nplaintiffs’ counsel and ultimately submitted to the court for approval.  Once \nthe  court  approves  a  new  form,  the  NYPD  will  use  it  throughout  the \nDepartment.   \n5.  Davis/NYCHA Policies \nIn the Davis settlement, the City, the NYPD and the plaintiffs agreed \nthat residents of NYCHA buildings and their authorized visitors have the \nsame  legal  rights  as  the  residents  and  visitors  of  any  other  residential \nbuilding in New York City.  The parties agreed that developing cooperative \nand trusting relationships between NYPD officers and NYCHA residents \nadvances effective policing.  \n28 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 39 of 97\nII. B. Department Policies and Procedures \n                           \n              5.  Davis/NYCHA Policies    \n \nMilestones \nThe Davis settlement requires a new Patrol Guide provision for the \ninterior  patrol  of  NYCHA  buildings  (P.G.  212-60)  that  promotes \nconstitutional interactions between NYPD officers and persons encountered \nduring interior patrols.  The new provision deals with encounters governed \nby  DeBour  (described  in  Section  II.B.1).    Among  other  things,  the new \nprovision states that, without more, entering, being in or exiting a NYCHA \nbuilding  is  not  an  “objective  credible  reason”  justifying  an  officer’s \napproach and request for information.  The settlement also requires a new \nform documenting all trespass arrests in NYCHA buildings (the Trespass \nCrimes Fact Sheet).  The agreed-upon order also modifies certain NYCHA \nrules requesting residents’ cooperation with police inquiries and defining \n“lingering,” which NYCHA rules prohibit in its buildings.1 \nStatus and Assessment \nThe language of P.G. 212-60 was agreed to as part of the settlement \nand has been approved by the court.  The NYPD and the plaintiffs in Davis, \nLigon and Floyd all agree that the procedures for NYCHA patrols (P.G. 212-\n60) should align when possible with procedures for patrol of TAP buildings \n(P.G. 212-59) and should be consistent with the stop procedures applicable \n                                           \n1  NYCHA was also a defendant in Davis and reached a settlement with the Davis \nplaintiffs. \n29 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 40 of 97\nII.

Because the submission of a final \nrecommendation  for  a  revised  P.G.  212-59  has  been  deferred  while  the \nparties in Ligon continue their negotiations, the publication of P.G. 212-60 \nmay also be deferred so both procedures can be issued at the same time.   \nC.  Training \nAn important focus of attention for the parties and monitor in the first \nmonths of this remedial effort has been training for the current police recruit \nclass that started in January 2015 and recently graduated.  The monitor, the \nNYPD and the plaintiffs recognized that a new class of approximately 890 \nrecruits could not be trained at the Police Academy using materials that the \ncourt and the NYPD had determined to be inadequate.  The parties worked \nto develop new student guides, lesson plans, PowerPoint presentations and \nscenarios  for  several  subjects,  including  Policing  Legally—Street \nEncounters; Policing Impartially; and Patrolling Housing Facilities.   \nThe  revisions  to  training  materials  do  not  reflect  any  changes  in \nfederal constitutional law.  Much of the recruit training materials were the \nsame  as  those  used  in  prior  classes.    Changes  were  made  to  the  extent \nrequired by the court orders, and there were additional revisions that the \nNYPD wanted to make.  Recruit training may undergo further review and \nmodifications for future recruit classes.  \n30 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 41 of 97\nII. C. Training                          \n         \n                \n \nRecruit training is just one piece of the larger training effort needed \nfor this remedial effort.  All 35,000 NYPD members of the service will need \nto be trained on the new policies and procedures to be put into place.  This \nwill require significant time, coordination and resources.  The Department \nwill be developing roll-call training for precincts, PSAs and TDs, and more \nin-depth annual in-service training that will include lectures, discussions and \nrole-play  scenarios.    In  addition  to  recruit  training,  revisions  to  training \nrequired by the court orders and parties’ agreements include the following \nelements: \n  Changes to the Field Training Officer (FTO) guide and training for \nthe  field  training  officers  who  will  be  working  with  the  newly \ngraduated recruits in July; \n  Roll-call training on the following topics: \no   New Patrol Guide procedures on stop, question and frisk (P.G. \n212-11); \no  New procedures prohibiting racial profiling (P.G. 203-25); \no  New procedures on interior patrols in NYCHA housing (P.G. \n212-60); \no  New procedures on interior patrols in TAP buildings (P.G. 212-\n59); \n31 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 42 of 97\nII. C. Training                          \n         \n                \n \no  New Stop Report Form (formerly UF-250);  \no  New  Trespass  Crimes  Fact  Sheet,  to  be  completed  for  each \ntrespass arrest; \n  Training  on  changes  to  NYCHA  House  Rules,  including  the \ndefinition of lingering;  \n  Promotional training for supervisors; and \n  In-service training for all NYPD members of the service.  \nSeparate from the court orders, the NYPD recognizes that its training, \nboth recruit and in-service, is due for comprehensive review.  The NYPD \nwants to move to a curriculum that relies more on scenarios and interactive \ntraining.  The Department has opened a new Police Academy building in \nCollege Point, Queens, which is a consolidated training campus for new \nrecruits,  officers  and  civilians.    The  Department  established  a  civilian \nTraining  Advisory  Committee  to  assist  the  NYPD  in  reviewing  and \nobserving training. \nThe NYPD also has identified the need for more in-service training in \naddition to the training needed for this remedial effort.  In 2015, the NYPD \nbegan a new three-day training curriculum on use of force and de-escalation \ntactics for all officers.  This training focuses on how an officer can avoid a \nphysical  confrontation  when  dealing  with  a  suspect,  and  how  to  take  a \n32 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 43 of 97\nII.

Training on Stop, Question and Frisk    \n \nsuspect into custody safely while minimizing the possibility of harm to the \nindividual and the officer.  The training is designed to reinforce skills and \ntactics  to  maintain  safety  in  often  difficult  and  dangerous  situations. \nAlthough much of this training goes beyond what is required by the court \norders in these cases, there are elements that are relevant to the court orders, \nincluding material relating to procedural justice.   \nTraining is essential to the success of the remedial efforts.  Officers at \nevery level should feel comfortable that they understand what the law and \nNYPD policy require and permit.  Unless that happens, the Department will \nfind it difficult to ensure that stop, question and frisk and trespass arrests are \nused when they should be and not used when they shouldn’t be.   \n1.  Training on Stop, Question and Frisk \nMilestones \nA recruit training class entitled “Policing Legally—Street Encounters” \ncovers the legal standards governing when an officer may stop, question and \nfrisk a person.  The  court orders require that this course underscore that \nofficers need to articulate specific facts describing why they had reasonable \nsuspicion,  so  that  they  avoid  using  boilerplate  language  or  “scripts”  in \ndescribing the basis for a stop.  The training should also emphasize that the \nlegal authority for a stop does not automatically provide the authority for a \n33 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 44 of 97\nII.

To frisk a person, the officer must have reasonable suspicion that the \nperson stopped is armed and presently dangerous.  The court also found that \nthe  description  of  “furtive  behavior”  in  the  prior  training  materials  was \nvague, and that the language on “unusual firearms” was misleading.  The \nnew training materials will also include scenarios involving self-initiated \nstops in addition to stops based on radio runs. \nStatus and Assessment \nThe NYPD worked with the monitor and the plaintiffs in revising the \nrecruit training materials.  The revisions were designed to clarify this area of \nthe  law  and  expand  the  discussion  of  the  constitutional  standards.    The \ntraining materials stress that an encounter between a civilian and an officer \nis considered a “stop” under the law when a reasonable person would not \nfeel free to disregard the officer and walk away.  Such an encounter requires \nthe officer to have reasonable suspicion that the person was engaged in or is \nabout to be engaged in criminal conduct.  The course covers Terry and the \nfour levels of DeBour encounters.  \nThe revised training materials for this subject included a student guide \nand  PowerPoint  presentation,  an  instructors’  lesson  plan,  scenarios  and \nworkshops involving encounters at each of the levels of DeBour encounters, \nand exam questions.  \n34 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 45 of 97\nII. C. Training                                      \n    1. Training on Stop, Question and Frisk    \n \nOn  April  24,  2015,  the  court  approved  the  monitor’s  final \nrecommendations on the training materials submitted, and training began on \nMay 11, 2015.  The monitor team has observed training classes; one of the \nplaintiffs’ experts accompanied the monitor team in observing some of the \ntraining classes. \nAlthough the NYPD has made changes to the written recruit training \nmaterials required by the orders, the parties agree that it was not possible for \nthe NYPD to rewrite and restructure the recruit curriculum completely in the \nshort time available for preparing the materials for this recruit class.  The \nNYPD, the monitor and the plaintiffs will learn from the training of this first \nrecruit class, and revisions to training for future classes can incorporate the \nlessons learned.   \nIn conducting its evaluation, the monitor team sat in on many recruit \nclasses and participated in “train the trainer” sessions, which also were focus \ngroups  about  how  the  curriculum  could  be  better  taught.    We  spoke  to \nindividual teachers and had many conversations and meetings with those \nconcerned  with  training—including  the  First  Deputy  Commissioner,  the \ncommanding officer of the Police Academy, many of the staff in charge of \nparticular aspects of training, the civilian Training Advisory Committee, and \noutside consultants to the NYPD whose tasks include providing advice about \n35 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 46 of 97\nII.

Members of the monitor team have had substantial experience in \neducation and in training police officers, and we shared with the Department \nsome preliminary impressions and thoughts about how training could be \nimproved.  These comments related to increasing and improving teacher \ntraining,  increasing  the  use  of  hands-on  training,  and  rethinking  how \nteachers are chosen for the Academy and how they are evaluated once there.   \n2.  Training on Racial Profiling \nAs the student guide for the “Policing Impartially” course states: “As \na police officer, you are required to enforce the law impartially without \nregard to actual or perceived race, class, ethnicity, culture, religion, age, \ngender, sexual orientation, disability, immigration or housing status.  At the \nsame  time,  we  are  members  of  a  larger  society  in  which  bias  and \ndiscrimination against certain groups of people are matters of historical and \nstatistical  fact….    As  noted  in  a  recent  speech  by  Police  Commissioner \nBratton, American policing has been part of the best of American history, \nbut  unfortunately  some  of  the  worst  parts  as  well.    Understanding  this \nhistory and how it has shaped perceptions will help you become a better, \nmore effective police officer.”   \n \n36 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 47 of 97\nII.

Training on Bias-Free Policing  \nMilestones \nThe court orders require new training on the NYPD’s prohibition of \nracial profiling.  Under that policy, officers may not use race as a motivating \nfactor, even in part, for law enforcement action, unless the action is based on \na reliable and specific suspect description.  A general suspect description, \nsuch as “young, black male,” is not sufficient; in addition, the fact that a \nparticular group may appear more frequently in local crime statistics is not \nenough information for there to be reasonable suspicion for a stop.  \nStatus and Assessment \nThe NYPD prepared a student guide and PowerPoint presentation for \nthe “Policing Impartially” recruit course and the plaintiffs provided their \ncomments.  The monitor submitted and the court approved these materials \nfor this recruit class.  These written materials included what was required by \nthe court orders and the parties’ agreements.  In addition, the NYPD worked \nwith the plaintiffs and the monitor to prepare the instructors’ lesson plan, \nscenarios,  workshops  and  exam  questions.    The  material  includes \ninformation regarding bias and police history and how knowledge of this \nhistory can help officers be more effective.  Most of the training material in \nthis course was previously included in prior recruit training classes and was \n37 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 48 of 97\nII.

The  monitor  team  observed  that  the  recruit  class \nbenefited greatly from the diversity of the class itself and their personal \nexperiences with police encounters.  Further changes may be made for future \nclasses  based  on  experience  from  this  training  class  and  from  the \ncomprehensive review of training materials being undertaken by the NYPD.  \nIn-service training for officers in the field also will be conducted after the \nPatrol Guide procedure on racial profiling is approved by the court. \nb.  Training on Implicit Bias and Procedural \nJustice \nMilestones \nTraining on implicit bias and procedural justice are two important \nareas of education.  The Department has recognized that police officers will \nbe much more effective and safer if they are aware of their own unconscious \nbiases as well as those of others with whom they interact—e.g., community \nresidents,  witnesses  and  complainants,  prosecutors,  lawyers  and  judges.  \nIncorporating training on implicit bias into the NYPD training curriculum \nwill inform new recruits and officers about how stereotypes and unconscious \nattitudes (some developed during police work) can sometimes improperly \ninfluence their perceptions.   \n38 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 49 of 97\nII.

Training on Implicit Bias and Procedural Justice \n \nThe Department has committed itself to “procedural justice” training, \na well-known training tool.  The U.S. Justice Department describes the core \nvalues  of  procedural  justice  as  “(1)  fairness  and  consistency  in  rule \napplication, (2) impartiality and unbiased decision making, (3) providing \nvoice and representation, and (4) demonstrating transparency and openness.” \nwww.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/taskforce/Procedural-Justice-and-Legitimacy-LE-\nReview-Summary.pdf.    A  benefit  of  procedural  justice  is  that  voluntary \ncompliance  is  furthered  when  individuals  believe  they  are  being  treated \nfairly, respectfully and within the law.  Police officers will be more effective \nand  safer  when  civilians  comply  voluntarily  with  law  enforcement \ndirectives.  Another tenet of procedural justice is that police officers are \nmore effective when they believe they are being treated by their superiors \nfairly, respectfully and within the law.  \nStatus and Assessment \nPreparing training on implicit bias and procedural justice will take \ntime.  The monitor and parties agree that it should be included for the recruit \nclass starting in July 2015, if possible, or for the following 2016 recruit \nclass.  The NYPD is hiring consultants with expertise in policing, implicit \nbias and procedural justice to assist in reviewing NYPD training and NYPD \npolicies,  and  in  developing  revised  training  materials.  \n39 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 50 of 97\nII.

Training on TAP Policies (Ligon) \nMilestones \nThe  agreed-upon  orders  require  the  NYPD  to  revise  its  training \nregarding how officers conduct interior patrols (sometimes called “vertical \npatrols”) inside or near apartment buildings enrolled in TAP.  The training \nmust  emphasize  that  mere  presence  in,  entry  into  or  exit  from  a  TAP \nbuilding  is  not  sufficient  to  stop  an  individual  on  suspicion  of  criminal \ntrespass; nor is it an “objective credible reason” to approach a person to \nrequest information.  \nStatus and Assessment \nThe court has approved the study guide and PowerPoint presentation \non TAP policies for the current recruit class.  The NYPD worked with the \nplaintiffs and the monitor to develop the instructors’ lesson plan, exams and \nscenarios.  The training covers stops both outside and inside TAP buildings \nand is not limited to buildings in the Bronx.  The written TAP training \nmaterials include the changes required.  The monitor team will continue to \nobserve NYPD training on this topic.  In-service and roll-call training on this \ntopic will be reviewed after the Patrol Guide procedures are approved by the \ncourt.\n40 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 51 of 97\nII.

Training on Patrols in NYCHA Buildings (Davis) \nMilestones \nAs  part  of  the  Davis  settlement,  the  NYPD  and  plaintiffs  have \ndeveloped  an  instructors’  lesson  plan  for  recruits  on  interior  patrols  in \nNYCHA buildings, which has been approved by the court.  In-service and \nroll-call training also will need to be developed. \nStatus and Assessment \nThe  court-approved  lesson  plan  was  incorporated  into  the  Police \nAcademy recruit training for the January 2015 recruit class.  The NYPD also \ndeveloped  a  student  guide,  PowerPoint  presentation  and  other  materials \nconsistent with the lesson plan.   \nThe  NYPD  incorporated  the  court-approved  training  materials  two \nweeks after the April 28 approval of the Davis settlement, although it was \nnot  required  for  the  January–July  2015  recruit  class.    The  monitor  has \nobserved recruit training on this topic.

Training for Supervisors \nMilestones \nOne of the significant changes to NYPD procedures is that front-line \nsupervisors  will  be  responsible  for  reviewing  the  legality  of  stops  and \ntrespass  arrests.    NYPD  supervisors  must  be  trained  on  these  new \nresponsibilities.  Promotional training for each of the ranks from sergeant to \ncaptain must be revised to include training on the new responsibilities of \nsupervisors and the chain of command.  In addition, the officers who will be \npartnering  with  the  recruits  who  graduated  in  July  2015  under  the  FTO \nprogram also must be trained so that they are familiar with the training \nprovided to the recruits.  The FTO Field Guide also must be revised with \nrespect  to  stops  and  interior  patrols  of  NYCHA  buildings  and  buildings \nenrolled in TAP. \nStatus and Assessment  \nThe NYPD has prepared revisions to the FTO Field Guide and drafted \ntraining materials for FTOs.  The parties have not agreed on whether any \nadditional  revisions  to  the  Field  Training  Guide  are  needed  to  meet  the \nrequirements of the court orders, and the monitor will be reviewing this \nissue.  Additional training materials will be prepared after court approval of \nnew stop, question and frisk Patrol Guide procedures.  These materials will \ninclude roll-call training for supervisors on the Patrol Guide procedures, in-\n42 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 53 of 97\nII. D.

The monitor will \nreport on training for supervisors after the revised NYPD procedures are \napproved by the court and training is developed. \nD.  Supervision  \nOne of the findings of the court in Floyd was that NYPD supervisors \ndid not review the constitutionality of the stops made by officers under their \nsupervision.  Under the existing Patrol Guide procedures, officers submit \ntheir stop report forms to the desk sergeant, not to their direct supervisor \n(usually the patrol sergeant).  In addition, to the extent that the desk sergeant \nor any other supervisor in the NYPD chain of command reviews an officer’s \nstop report form, it is only to assess whether the form is fully completed—\nthat is, whether all the captions are filled out.  Furthermore, there is little \nreview of an officer’s activity log, and no assessment of whether the activity \nlog  describes  a  constitutional  stop  and/or  frisk,  based  on  appropriate \nreasonable suspicion.   \nFront-line supervision was emphasized by the court because there is \nconsensus  among  police  agencies  that  these  supervisors  play  the  most \nimportant  role  affecting  the  culture  of  the  organization.    An  engaged \n43 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 54 of 97\nII. D.

Misfeasance  is  best  identified  and  corrected,  and  good  conduct \nrecognized and rewarded, at this level of the organization.   \nMilestones \nThe court orders require that front-line supervisors review officers’ \nstop report forms and activity logs not just for their completeness but also \nfor the constitutionality of the stop, the constitutionality of the frisk and/or \nsearch,  if  conducted,  and  the  reasonableness  of  any  use  of  force.    The \nprocedures must also include a description of supervisory actions taken or to \nbe taken if an officer’s actions are not appropriate.  In the Ligon case, the \ncourt orders require that the NYPD implement a system for reviewing the \nconstitutionality of stops for criminal trespass outside TAP buildings in the \nBronx, consistent with the supervisory reforms ordered in Floyd.  Under the \nDavis  settlement,  the  NYPD  must  ensure  that  supervisors  review  their \nofficers’  interactions  with  NYCHA  residents  and  guests  when  making \narrests for trespass, when making stops and when enforcing NYCHA rules.  \nThe  review  will  be  to  ensure  the  lawfulness  of  the  interaction  and  that \nofficers prepare the appropriate documentation.   \n \n \n \n44 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 55 of 97\nII.

The draft \nrevised Patrol Guide procedures for stops (P.G. 212-11) include supervisory \nreview  and  responsibility  for  taking  appropriate  action.    An  officer’s \nimmediate supervisor (usually the patrol sergeant) will conduct a substantive \nreview of the constitutionality of the stop and, if conducted, the frisk or \nsearch.  In addition, the procedures provide for the sergeants’ reviews of \nstops to be assessed by the precinct’s Integrity Control Officer (ICO) and the \nExecutive Officer.  \nThese  responsibilities  will  be  included  in  the  new  Patrol  Guide \nsections and will also be documented on the new stop report form.  The \nrevised stop report form (now in draft) requires supervisors to document \nwhether the stop was supported by reasonable suspicion and, separately, \nwhether the frisk, if conducted, was supported by reasonable suspicion.  If \nnot,  the  supervisor  must  then  document  what  action,  if  any,  was  taken:  \nwhether the report was corrected or the officer was instructed, referred for \ntraining or disciplined.  The monitor also will review the NYPD procedures \ncovering  supervisory  actions  relating  to  trespass  enforcement.\n45 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 56 of 97\n  II.

Auditing \nUnder  the  court  orders,  the  monitor  will  “regularly  conduct \ncompliance and progress reviews” to assess the extent to which the NYPD \nhas implemented the required remedial measures.  It is even more important, \nhowever, that the NYPD itself monitor and audit its conduct to ensure that \nthe reforms are carried out.   \nThere are several ways the NYPD audits and monitors its officers’ \nactions.    At  the  precinct  level,  each  command  has  an  ICO,  who  must \nperform inspections and reviews to identify misconduct by officers.  QAD is \nresponsible  for  ensuring  that  the  Department  complies  with  its  written \npolicies and procedures.  With respect to NYPD stop and frisk practices, the \ncourt found that the Department’s monitoring and audit procedures were \ninadequate.  Supervisors, ICOs and QAD reviewed the paperwork to assess \nhow the stop report forms were filled out but did not conduct reviews to \nensure that the stops were lawful.  \n1.  Quality Assurance Division (QAD)  \nMilestones \nThe court orders require that the NYPD develop auditing protocols for \nstops  and  frisks  that  ensure  compliance  with  legal  standards,  not  just \ndocumentation  requirements.    In  addition,  the  NYPD  must  develop \n46 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 57 of 97\n  II. E. Auditing  \n                            1.

QAD \nevaluates compliance in many different performance areas: stop, question \nand frisk is one of them.   \nCurrently, QAD is continuing to conduct audits of stops and oversee \nself-inspections mostly as it did before the court orders, without the changes \nthe NYPD understands need to be made, because neither the Patrol Guide \nsection governing stop, question and frisk nor the stop report form has yet \nbeen revised to reflect the requirements of the orders.  In anticipation of the \nappropriate changes to the Patrol Guide and stop report form, however, the \nNYPD is in the process of developing new audit work plans.  The NYPD has \nstated  that  audits  undertaken  pursuant  to  the  new  plans  will  focus  on \nassessment  of  the  lawfulness  of  the  stop  (and  frisk,  if  conducted)  and \nevaluate the supervisor’s review of those actions.  The work plans also will \nanalyze data to identify citywide, borough-wide, and precinct-level patterns \nand trends of potentially problematic stops.  The new audit program will also \n47 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 58 of 97\n  II. E. Auditing  \n                            1. Quality Assurance Division (QAD)                          \n                                                             \n \ninclude a revised sampling approach that will increase the number of stops \nanalyzed  by  QAD.    NYPD  staff  have  visited  the  Los  Angeles  Police \nDepartment to review its audit system and are collecting information on \nauditing from other large city police departments.  The NYPD has also hired \na CPA with extensive auditing experience who was previously employed by \na  major accounting firm. \nOne  major  challenge  for  the  NYPD  is  how  to  identify  and  then \naddress stops and frisks that are made by police officers but not documented.  \nWithout  accurate  reporting,  it  will  be  impossible  for  the  Department’s \nsupervisors to make informed judgments about what is actually happening \non  the  street.    Without  that  knowledge,  it  will  be  difficult  for  the \nDepartment’s policy-makers to account for and perhaps respond to what \ncommunities  are  in  fact  experiencing.    And  finally,  it  is  essential  in  a \ndemocratic society that the public have confidence in what is being reported \nby the police.  \nBefore 2008, QAD did not conduct any audits to determine whether \nstop forms were in fact completed every time a person was stopped.  After a \nstudy by the RAND Corporation in 2008, the NYPD developed an audit \nprogram using radio transmissions to identify instances in which a stop was \nmade  and  a  stop  report  should  have been  prepared.    The  audit  required \n48 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 59 of 97\n  II. E. Auditing  \n                            1.

If  not,  further  investigation  is  done  to \ndetermine whether one should have been prepared.  QAD performs this audit \nbased on ICAD in five commands each month.  \nAssessment \nThe NYPD has acknowledged that the current ICO self-inspections \nand QAD audits are not sufficient, and the Risk Management Bureau is \npreparing new audit work plans to meet the requirements of the court orders. \nThe new audit work plans also should include protocols for monitoring and \nauditing stops and arrests for criminal trespass in NYCHA housing.  \nSome audits that QAD is now conducting, however, do identify issues \nthat need to be addressed.  The NYPD provided the monitor with recent \naudits of nineteen precincts based on reviews of radio transmissions (ICAD \naudits).  For seven of these precincts, the audit looked at three-day periods.\n49 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 60 of 97\n  II. E.

In  total,  these \ntwelve audits concluded that there were seventeen instances in which stops \nwere conducted when there should have been a stop report form but none \nwas made.  For seven additional precincts, QAD identified a number of \ninstances in which it appeared likely that a stop was conducted but there was \nno or improper documentation.

The  monitor  has  asked  for  additional \ninformation about the outcomes of these audits.   \nThe monitor team will be working with the NYPD and the plaintiffs to \nidentify additional methods for determining whether stops are being made \nbut not documented and will be reviewing the results of the audits.   \n2.  Early Identification System (EIS) \nMilestones \nThe court highlighted the benefits of an Early Identification System \n(EIS) (sometimes called an “Early Intervention System” or “Early Warning \nSystem”), a centralized database to collect and analyze information relating \nto behavior that might put the Department or its officers at risk.  Many major \npolice departments use an EIS to support the supervision and management of \ntheir  officers,  supervisors  and  units.    It  is  not  meant  to  be  a  tool  for \ndiscipline; it is used to identify at-risk employees and patterns of at-risk \n50 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 61 of 97\n  II.

As  part  of  the  remedial  efforts,  the  NYPD  has \ncommitted itself to implementing an effective EIS system. \nStatus \nThe NYPD has described an EIS that it has had in place for some \ntime.  The Performance Analysis Section of the Risk Management Bureau \ntracks officer performance using several databases to identify officers and \nsupervisors who display at-risk behavior.  Officers flagged in the system are \nthen  candidates  for  a  monitoring  program.    The  data  reviewed  include \ndisciplinary  actions,  evaluations  that  are  below  standards,  civil  lawsuits, \nCCRB  complaints,  use  of  force  complaints,  referrals  by  supervisors  and \npersonnel information collected in the Department’s Central Personnel Index \n(CPI).  Personnel from the Performance Analysis Section then interview \nofficers that were identified for placement into a monitoring program.  A \nmonitoring program is then put in place with a plan for remediation, which \nmay include re-training or mentorship.  \nThe  NYPD  has  committed  itself  to  upgrading  its  technology  to \nintegrate more of its databases and to creating an alert system that identifies \nofficers  and  units  for  potential  intervention.    As  part  of  this  effort,  the \nDepartment has moved its Enterprise Liability Assessment Unit (ELAU) to \n51 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 62 of 97\n  II. E.

ELAU’s task is to analyze notices of \nclaims and lawsuits filed against the City and officers to identify patterns or \ntrends.  ELAU has begun creating an internal database, the Risk Assessment \nInformation Litigation System (RAILS), for this purpose.  The NYPD plans \nto expand the RAILS database to create a single, integrated database for both \nofficer performance analysis and department-wide risk assessment.  This \nexpanded database would provide the Performance Analysis Section, as well \nas supervisors and others in the Department, with up-to-date data regarding \nofficers and squads.  The New York City Comptroller’s Office has approved \na new “scope of work” and registered the contract for expanding RAILS.  \nAs described to the monitor, once it is in operation, the expanded \nRAILS  will  include  information  on  complaints  against  officers,  civil \nlawsuits, uses of force, discipline, sick leave and overtime, traffic accidents, \nIAB  investigations,  criminal  proceedings  against  officers  and  other  data \nrelating to at-risk behavior.  The NYPD also hopes to incorporate positive \ninformation on officers, including commendations, letters of reference and \npromotions, among other items.  RAILS will use “triggers,” or thresholds, to \nidentify when officers need additional review by supervisors; these triggers \nwill be both quantitative (e.g., if an officer has been named in a certain \nnumber  of  lawsuits)  and  comparative  (e.g.,  if  an  officer  has  used  force \n52 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 63 of 97\n  II.

The section uses data from the CPI, performance evaluations \nand some data from the CCRB, but it does not include other information that \nwould be useful, such as data on stops, as well as trespass arrests in public \nhousing.  \nThe NYPD’s proposals to expand RAILS are encouraging.  If it is put \ninto place, RAILS can be a formidable early identification system.  Some of \nthe  challenges  the  NYPD  faces  in  getting  this  system  up  and  running \ninclude:  completing the procurement process; obtaining data from all the \nappropriate sources, including the CCRB and the City Law Department; and \ntraining supervisors on using the data and analysis.  The NYPD agrees that it \nshould use RAILS or another methodology to analyze and assess patterns \nand trends of officers’ stops.   \n53 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 64 of 97\n  II.

The \nQAD audits described in Section II.E.1 above should include trespass stops \noutside  TAP  buildings  in  the  Bronx,  so  that  the  NYPD  can  implement \nprocedures to ensure proper documentation of those stops.  In addition, the \nNYPD has proposed a draft Operations Order for a pilot program to examine \nthe supervisory review of criminal trespass stops outside TAP buildings in \nthe  Bronx.    The  draft  pilot  program  requires  the  ICO  in  each  Bronx \ncommand to review a percentage of stop reports each month.  The procedure \nwill include supervisory reviews focusing on assessing the constitutionality \nof stops in addition to ensuring the forms have been completed correctly.  \nThe monitor has reviewed the draft audit protocol and will be sending the \nparties proposed revisions to the draft Operations Order.

How NYPD Handles Complaints and Discipline  \nConcerning Profiling, Trespass Enforcement and Stop, \nQuestion and Frisk  \nA fair, accurate and prompt disciplinary system is central to the court \norders,  the  parties’  agreements  and  also  to  improving  relations  between \npolice  officers  and  their  superiors  and  between  the  police  and  the \ncommunity.  The system should be seen as legitimate by the police and the \ncommunity being policed.  \n1.  Tracking and Investigating Profiling Complaints \nMilestones \nUntil the fall of 2014, the NYPD did not have a separate category for \nallegations of racial or other prohibited profiling, and therefore could not \nknow how many of these complaints had been made.  Profiling allegations \nthat came into the Department most often were sent to be investigated at the \nprecinct where the alleged conduct occurred, and the NYPD did not track the \noutcome of the complaints—whether the allegation was substantiated and, if \nso, whether any remedial or disciplinary action was taken.  The court orders \nrequire the NYPD to begin tracking and investigating complaints it receives \nrelated to profiling.  \n \n \n55 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 66 of 97\n    II.

Tracking and Investigating Profiling Complaints                                \n                                                             \n \nStatus \nThe NYPD has changed the way it processes, tracks and responds to \nprofiling  complaints.    In  October  2014,  the  NYPD  upgraded  the  case \nmanagement system used by the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) and added a \n“profiling” category with nine subcategories: race, color, ethnicity, national \norigin, religion, age, gender, gender identity and sexual orientation.  These \ncomplaints can now be tracked.   \nThe  NYPD  also  changed  by  whom  profiling  allegations  are \ninvestigated.    Previously,  allegations  of  profiling  were  categorized  as \n“Outside  Guidelines”  or  “OG”  complaints,  and  the  Investigative  Review \nSection of the Office of Chief of Department would determine where the \nallegations were sent to be investigated.  Usually, the investigations were \nsent to the officer’s precinct, where the officer’s supervisor often did the \ninvestigation.  Now, profiling complaints are categorized as more serious \n“Misconduct” or “M” cases.  These M cases are logged into the IAB’s case \nmanagement system and the IAB tracks the complaint.  The allegations are \nno  longer  investigated  in  the  command  where  the  officer  is  assigned.  \nInstead, the Office of Chief of Department determines where the allegation \nwill be investigated, and forwards the case to one of the investigation units \n56 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 67 of 97\n    II.

Tracking and Investigating Profiling Complaints                                \n                                                             \n \nof the relevant borough or bureau command.  The IAB reviews both the \nquality and the outcome of these M case investigations.  \nAccording to the NYPD, as of April 30, 2015, there have been ninety-\nthree allegations of profiling received by the NYPD since October 2014, \nwhen the IAB case management system began tracking profiling complaints \n(fourteen in 2014 and seventy-nine in 2015).  The fourteen 2014 cases were \nclassified as OG cases and investigated at the precinct level.  Of the 2015 \ncases, however, seventy-eight have been classified as M cases, with one case \nclassified as a “C” (Corruption) case.  \nThe NYPD has stated that with the changes to its database, which \nseparately categorizes profiling allegations, IAB and the Risk Management \nBureau will now be able to analyze the data to determine whether there are \ntrends,  patterns  or  other  indications  of  problematic  behavior  within  a \nprecinct, borough or bureau, or by a single officer.  These analyses would be \nmore  complete  if  the  NYPD  included  allegations  of  profiling  that  are \nreceived at the CCRB.  Although the CCRB does not have a category of \ncomplaints for profiling allegations, if profiling is alleged in a complaint or \nduring  the  investigation  of  the  complaint,  the  CCRB  does  note  those \nallegations  in  its  database.    The  Department  does  not  obtain  that  data \nroutinely and regularly, and the NYPD is not currently using the CCRB\n57 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 68 of 97\n    II.

NYPD Handling of Complaints Substantiated by the CCRB                       \n                                                             \n \n complaint data (whether related to profiling or to stops, frisks and searches) \nfor any analysis of trends and patterns of complaints. \nAssessment \nHaving complaints of profiling investigated by the IAB or a borough \ninvestigation unit improves the NYPD process because a supervisor of the \nsubject of the complaint will no longer investigate the complaint.  When the \nNYPD begins completing investigations and dispositions of these cases, the \nmonitor  will  review  a  sample  of  those  investigations  and  report  on  that \nreview.    The  monitor  also  will  review  the  NYPD’s  intake  procedures, \ninvestigative protocols and training materials for these investigations.  The \nDepartment  has  made  improvements  in  how  it  categorizes  and  tracks \ncomplaints  of  profiling.    It  is  too  early  to  assess  how  the  Department \ninvestigates these complaints or how it uses and analyzes the data it collects.   \n2.  NYPD Handling of Complaints Substantiated by the \nCCRB \nMilestones \nThe court found inadequacies in how the NYPD handled complaints \nrelating to stops, frisks or searches that were substantiated by the CCRB.  \nThe  CCRB  has  jurisdiction  to  investigate  complaints  against  officers \nalleging  use  of  excessive  or  unnecessary  force,  abuse  of  authority, \ndiscourtesy or the use of offensive language (collectively known as FADO \n58 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 69 of 97\n    II.

NYPD Handling of Complaints Substantiated by the CCRB                       \n                                                             \n \ncomplaints).  Improper stops, questions, frisks or searches fall under the \ncategory of abuse of authority.  Under the agreed-upon court orders, the \nNYPD’s Department Advocates Office (DAO) must revise its procedures for \ndealing with cases in which the CCRB has substantiated an allegation.  The \nNYPD must give increased deference to credibility determinations by the \nCCRB  and  not  favor  an  officer’s  word  simply  because  he  or  she  is  an \nofficer. \nStatus \nThere are several levels of discipline that can be imposed on NYPD \nmembers  of  the  service.    The  most  serious  discipline  recommendations, \ncalled “charges and specifications,” are prosecuted in the NYPD’s trial room \nbefore an administrative law judge, under the supervision of the NYPD’s \ndeputy commissioner of trials.  There are other cases in which less serious \ndiscipline is recommended.  The discipline recommended can be a loss of \nfive or fewer days of vacation, or ten or fewer days of vacation (known as \n“command  discipline  A”  and  “command  discipline  B,”  respectively), \nretraining or instructions from a supervisor.   \nAt the time of the Floyd trial, all complaints that were substantiated \nby the CCRB were sent to the Department Advocates Office (DAO) in the \nNYPD.  The DAO could proceed with the case or decide not to go forward \n59 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 70 of 97\n    II. F.

NYPD Handling of Complaints Substantiated by the CCRB                       \n                                                             \n \nwith the CCRB’s findings or recommended discipline.  For cases in which a \nCCRB  panel  substantiated  an  allegation  of  an  unconstitutional  stop  and \nrecommended serious discipline (i.e., charges and specifications), the DAO \nwould decide whether or not to prosecute the case in the NYPD trial room.  \nThe DAO reviewed the case, considered the recommendations of the CCRB \nand made its own recommendations to the police commissioner.  \nIn April 2012, the NYPD and the CCRB executed a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding (MOU) giving the CCRB authority to prosecute in the trial \nroom complaints that have been substantiated by the CCRB and in which it \nhas recommended that charges and specifications be brought.  The CCRB \nhas established its own Administrative Prosecution Unit (APU) to prosecute \nthese cases.  The police commissioner still has the final authority over the \ndisposition of the case and the discipline imposed, if any, if the trial results \nin a plea or finding of guilt.   \nAnother change in NYPD’s handling of cases substantiated by the \nCCRB  is  the  “reconsideration  process”  used  by  the  DAO.    If  the  DAO \ndisagrees with the CCRB’s determination to substantiate a case with charges \nand  specifications,  or  disagrees  with  the  CCRB’s  recommendation  of \ndiscipline, the DAO may request in writing that the CCRB reconsider the \ncase, and state why the NYPD disagrees with the CCRB’s decision.

If it does \nreconsider  the  case,  the  CCRB  panel  that  made  the  initial  decision  can \nmodify its decision to substantiate the complaint or its recommendation for \ndiscipline; or it can determine that its original decision was correct, in which \ncase  the  APU  continues  with  its  prosecution  in  the  trial  room.    The \nreconsideration process was formalized by a CCRB vote in December 2014.  \nFor  cases  in  which  the  CCRB  substantiates  the  allegation  and \nrecommends  discipline  less  serious  than  charges  and  specifications,  the \nDAO continues to review CCRB’s determination.  The DAO can agree with \nthe CCRB’s determination, decide not to go forward with the complaint \n(Department  Unable  to  Prosecute,  or  DUP),  or  change  the  CCRB’s \nrecommendation by recommending less severe or more severe discipline.  \nThese cases are also subject to reconsideration by the CCRB.   \nThe NYPD has developed a process it calls the penalty review process \nfor cases in which the NYPD disagrees with the CCRB’s determination in \nthese  less  serious  cases.    If  the  DAO  determines  that  the  discipline \nrecommended by the CCRB is too harsh, is not harsh enough or does not \napply to the type of conduct in which the officer engaged, the DAO sends an \nemail  to the  CCRB  stating  its reasons for disagreeing  with  the  CCRB’s \nrecommendation.  The CCRB can reconsider its recommendations before the \n61 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 72 of 97\n    II. F.

However, this change does not deal with cases in which the \nCCRB recommends discipline at the command level.  In addition, further \nstudy  is  needed  of  other  parts  of  the  NYPD’s  disciplinary  process  to \ndetermine whether, as a whole, this process meets the requirements of the \ncourt orders.   \nThe  plaintiffs  have  raised  concerns  that  the  reconsideration  and \npenalty review processes will undermine the reforms incorporated in the \nMOU.  Plaintiffs are concerned that the new procedures might delay the \nprocess so long that cases could not be prosecuted because the statute of \nlimitation had run.  They also have expressed concerns that the procedures \nwould  allow  the  DAO  to  impose  its  legal  analysis,  factual  findings  and \npenalty  recommendations  on  the  CCRB.    In  its  2014  annual  report,  the \nCCRB states that the new spirit of collaboration between the NYPD and the \n62 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 73 of 97\n    II.

However, the monitor \nteam has not yet had the chance to assess fully the plaintiffs’ concerns and \npossible responses by the NYPD or to take into account the data underlying \nthe CCRB’s 2014 report.  \n3.  CCRB Investigations \nThe CCRB is an independent agency and was not party to the lawsuits \nor the agreements among the parties, and the court orders did not require the \nCCRB to change its procedures.  Nonetheless, it is an important part of the \ndisciplinary process.  The success of some of the reforms agreed to by the \nNYPD may be affected by whether the CCRB’s processes are perceived by \npolice officers and the public to be, and are in fact, fair and effective.  The \nCCRB has reorganized its investigative units, and changed how it trains its \ninvestigators and coordinates with the NYPD.  Its investigative units are \nnow  smaller  and  have  more  direct  supervision.    It  has  developed  new \nbenchmarks for how long it should take to interview complainants, officers, \nand witnesses and to complete investigations.  The NYPD also has assigned \nIAB  officers  to  work  at  the  CCRB,  which  significantly  enhances  the \nCCRB’s ability to obtain NYPD documents (such as crime reports and stop \n63 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 74 of 97\n    II.

Performance Goals, Objectives and Evaluation \nIn many meetings with NYPD officials and officers at every rank and \nfrom many different units, the Department has acknowledged, as the court \nfound, that an excessive focus on “numbers” led to the overuse and misuse \nof “stop, question and frisk.”  This emphasis was included in the evaluation \nof officers as part of periodic reviews and in less formal ways.  The push for \nmore and more stops (along with other enforcement activities) was ingrained \nin the expectations of supervisors at every level and of officers on the street.  \nThe result was less focus on the lawfulness and effectiveness of individual \nstops  and  more  on  increasing  the  number  of  stops.    This  also  had  the \ncollateral consequence of creating or exacerbating rifts between the police \nand the communities being policed, which, among other things, adds to the \ndanger and difficulty of an officer’s job and makes the communities less \n64 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 75 of 97\n    II.

Union officials also criticized the emphasis on numbers as diminishing \nthe discretion of police officers and effectively pushing them into behavior \nthat officers did not always think was appropriate.   \nThe point here is not to participate in the debate about the pros and \ncons of this emphasis on numbers or the policing strategies that led to it.  It \nis  that  performance  evaluation  was  one  of  the  most  important  elements \nleading to the court’s opinions, the court orders and the agreements.  It is \ntherefore an important part of the remedial process.  Unless officers on the \nstreet see evidence and believe that they will be rewarded and supported for \ndoing their jobs well—for quality, not just quantity—and not just disciplined \nfor unacceptable behavior, change will be slow and reforms may be fleeting.   \nDeciding how to change performance measures and evaluations and \nputting them into effect in the NYPD is, however, difficult and complex.  \nHere are a few of the many challenges: \nFirst,  the  NYPD  needs  to  decide  what  officer  behavior  or \ncharacteristics it wants evaluated.  Whatever else is going to be evaluated, \nthe Department believes that “activity” of some sort will have to be part of \nthe evaluation.  Otherwise it will be difficult for supervisors to learn which \nofficers are doing their jobs and which are slacking off.  In a department the \nsize of the NYPD, moreover, it is understandable that activity has to be \n65 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 76 of 97\n    II. G. Performance Goals, Objectives and Evaluation \n                                            \n                                                             \n \njudged to some extent by quantifiable numbers.  So the NYPD’s challenge is \nto  devise  a  system  that  recognizes  “quality”  (which  would  include \nlawfulness),  but  also  has  metrics  by  which  officers’  activity  and  their \nsupervisors’  review  of  that  activity  can  be  judged  without  having  those \nmetrics become a system of unlawful quotas.  In addition, certain activities \ndo not lend themselves to metrics that could be applied easily in such a large \ndepartment.  For example, the Department is committed to more engagement \nwith communities, but determining what is a productive engagement and \nwhat is just going through the motions is not simple. \nSecond, as anyone knows who has had to deal with this question in a \nlarge organization, it is not so easy to get those doing the evaluations to take \nthem  seriously  and  do  them  honestly.    No  system—no  matter  what  the \nmetrics—is useful if superiors, out of loyalty or laziness or something else, \ngive everyone terrific grades.  \nThird, as stated above, the system has to be felt on the street—in both \nthe discipline being handed out and in the rewards.  With respect to the \nrewards,  the  Department  has  tools,  but  those  tools  are  limited  by  civil \nservice rules.  \nThe  NYPD  understands  both  the  importance  and  complexity  of \nchanging  its  performance  evaluations.    The  police  commissioner  has \n66 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 77 of 97\n    II. H.

Body-worn Cameras \nThe  court noted  the  potential benefits  of  outfitting  NYPD  officers \nwith body-worn cameras (BWCs).  These potential benefits include creating \nobjective  records  of  stop  encounters,  encouraging  lawful  and  respectful \npolice-citizen interactions when both parties know exchanges are recorded, \nalleviating mistrust between the NYPD and the public, and offering a way to \nsubstantiate  whether  officers  have  been  wrongly  or  rightly  accused  of \nmisconduct.   \nAs described below, the monitor team is working with the NYPD to \nplan a BWC pilot program that will be a randomized control trial so that the \nNYPD and others will be able to evaluate the impact cameras have on the \nbehavior  of  officers  and  civilians.    The  pilot  is  expected  to  involve \napproximately 1,000 cameras, with about fifty cameras in twenty precincts.  \nThe  activities  of  officers  wearing  BWCs  will  be  compared  to  those  of \nofficers with similar assignments in twenty control precincts.  \n67 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 78 of 97\n    II.

The purpose of the pilot is to assess whether the benefits of the \ncameras  outweigh  their  financial,  administrative  and  other  costs,  and \nwhether the program should be expanded or terminated.  The monitor will \nwork with the parties to evaluate the pilot.  \nThe court ordered that the monitor establish procedures for reviewing \nstop  recordings  by  supervisors  and  senior  managers,  preserving  stop \nrecordings,  and  measuring  the  effectiveness  of  BWCs  in  reducing \nunconstitutional stops and frisks.  The court provided that BWCs must be \nworn  for  a  one-year  period  by  officers  on  patrol  in  one  precinct  per \nborough—specifically, the precinct with the highest number of stops in that \nborough during 2012.

In collaboration with the NYPD, the Marron Institute of Urban \nManagement at New York University is conducting an evaluation of the \nNYPD small-scale pilot program.  This effort is separate from the larger \none-year pilot BWC program and monitor evaluation required by the court \norders and the parties’ agreement.   \nWith respect to the pilot program required by the court orders, the \nmonitor team has begun to work with several units within the NYPD to plan \nthe design and implementation of the court-mandated pilot program.  We \nhave met with representatives from the NYPD’s Risk Management Bureau, \nInformation Technology Bureau, the Office of the Chief of Department, and \nthe Office of Management Analysis and Planning.  \nThe monitor team appreciates that there are many important issues \nthat need to be discussed, such as training, policy, technology, outreach to \nother stakeholders, privacy concerns and possible legal issues such as those \nraised by the state’s Freedom of Information Law; and we have had very \npreliminary conversations on these subjects.  However, most immediately, \nthe monitor team has been focusing on a design for a rigorous evaluation of \nthe court-mandated pilot program.   \n69 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 80 of 97\n    II.

Body-worn Cameras \n                                                             \n \nThe  a  priori  selection  of  the  five  NYPD  precincts  for  the  BWC \nprogram is problematic for several reasons.  First, some of the precincts with \nthe highest counts of stop reports in 2012 were no longer the precincts with \nthe highest number of reported stops in 2014.  For example, in 2012 the 75th \nPrecinct had the highest number of reported stops in the city; it was down to \nsixteenth in 2014.  Second, the selection in advance prevents the use of a \nrigorous randomized experimental design, since it would be impossible to \nhave a random selection of commands matching those that had cameras with \nthose  that  did  not.    The  advantage  of  a  randomized  experiment  is  the \nrelatively high degree of certainty that any observed differences between the \nprecincts  with  cameras  and  those  without  would  be  attributable  to  the \ncameras, not to chance or other causal factors.  Third, requiring that every \nofficer  in  a  precinct  wear  a  BWC  creates  significant  IT  and  logistical \nchallenges for the NYPD.   \nFor all these reasons, the monitor will be recommending to the court \nthat it modify its orders.  We describe below the outlines of a randomized \ncontrolled trial (RCT), but emphasize that we are still in the process of \ndesigning  the  program  and  that  further  changes  may  be  made  after \nconsultation with the NYPD, the plaintiffs and others. \n70 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 81 of 97\n  II.

Design of a Randomized Controlled Trial \nRandomized experimental designs allow researchers to assume that \nthe  only  systematic  difference  between  the  “control”  group  (here,  those \nwithout  cameras)  and  the  “treatment  group”  (those  with  cameras)  is  the \npresence of the intervention (i.e., use of cameras).  This design permits a \nclearer assessment of causes and effects.2  We plan to use a well-recognized \nvariant  of  the  classic  randomized  controlled  trial  called  “cluster” \nrandomization.    In  these  trials,  clusters  (groups)  of  subjects,  rather  than \nindividual  subjects,  are  randomly  allocated  to  treatment  and  control \nconditions.3   In  the  proposed  cluster  randomized  controlled  trial,  NYPD \nofficers will be randomly allocated by precinct to the BWC treatment group \nor non-BWC comparison group. \nThe cluster randomized experimental design will allow better control \nof “contamination” across individual subjects.  As suggested by the study on \nBWCs done in Rialto, California, officers with BWCs could influence the \nbehavior of officers without BWCs if they simultaneously worked in the \n                                           \n2  William R.

Randomly allocating groups of \nofficers who work in distinct precincts to treatment and control conditions \nlimits this problem of contamination. \nIn  the  proposed  trial,  eligible  NYPD  precincts  will  be  ranked \naccording to the 2012-2014 mean yearly counts of complaints handled by \nthe CCRB in New York City.  We picked this measure because the number \nof CCRB complaints is highly correlated to the highest rates of reported stop \nactivity and because the number of stops reported in each precinct in 2012 \nno longer reflects the stops now being reported.  Using the number of CCRB \ncomplaints as the measure, the top forty eligible precincts will be matched \ninto pairs based on those counts as well as other measures—specifically, the \ncrime rate, arrests, calls for service, use of force, number of police officers in \nthe precinct and neighborhood characteristics, such as racial composition \nand  poverty  level.

Identifying a well-defined group of officers \nensures an “apples to apples” comparison of officers in the treatment and \ncontrol groups.  One possibility is to select all officers assigned to a specific \nshift.  For instance, BWCs could be provided to all patrol officers working \nthe third platoon (4:00 p.m.–midnight shift) in the treatment group (there \nwill be approximately fifty patrol officers in each platoon).  The comparison \ngroup will consist of patrol officers working the third platoon in the non-\nBWC precincts.  Thus, there will be approximately 1,000 patrol officers in \nthe treatment group (twenty precincts and fifty officers per precinct) and \n1,000 patrol officers in the control group.  This is roughly the same number \nof cameras as would have been required under the terms of the court orders.5\n                                           \n5   For the more technically minded reader:  since outcomes for individuals within \nclusters  may  be  correlated,  standard  sample  sizes  need  to  be  inflated  for  cluster \nrandomized controlled trials.

Exclusions \nTen  NYPD  precincts  will  be  excluded  from  the  randomized \nexperiment.  The NYPD is currently piloting the BWC camera technology in \nfive precincts—the 23rd, 40th, 75th, 103rd, and 120th Precincts.  If one of \nthese precincts were to be in a pair and randomly selected as the control, this \nwould compromise the experiment because the use of BWCs in that precinct \nmight  already  have  affected  behavior.    The  NYPD  is  also  piloting  a \n“neighborhood-based policing” program in the 33rd, 34th, 100th, and 101st \nPrecincts.  These precincts will be excluded because it would be difficult to \ndistinguish the effects of the BWC technology on key outcome measures \nfrom the effects of the community engagement reforms implemented as part \nof the neighborhood-based policing program.  Finally, the 22nd Precinct \nserving Central Park will be excluded because it has relatively low levels of \nNYPD activity and an almost non-existent residential population. \nAll five boroughs have at least one precinct eligible for inclusion in \nthe randomized field experiment (see Table 1 below) \n74 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 85 of 97\n  II.

The monitor team will \nthen  assess  the  randomization  process  by  determining  whether  balanced \ntreatment  and  control  groups  were  created.    The  monitor team  will  first \ncompare  treatment  and  control  precincts  on  selected  police,  crime  and \nneighborhood  characteristics.    Balanced  clusters  help  to  ensure  that  the \ntreatment  and  control  officers  will  be  working  in  similar  neighborhood, \ncrime and policing contexts.  The monitor team will then analyze data on \ntreatment and control officers to determine whether the units of analysis \n(e.g., NYPD officers working the third platoon) systematically differ in the \ntreatment and control groups.  The officer comparison will include important \ninformation such as age, sex, race, rank and years on the job. \nAssessment \nThere are many issues to be addressed in the development of a pilot \nprogram for BWCs.  The monitor will be consulting with the NYPD, the \nplaintiffs and others on these issues.  \nThe  monitor  team  needs  to  devise  an  evaluation  plan  for  the \nimplementation  of  BWCs  on  NYPD  officers  working  in  PSAs.    The \ncharacteristics  of  PSAs  are  too  different  from  precincts  for  them  to  be \nincluded in the design described above.  Also, there are too few PSAs to do a \ncluster randomized design.  Therefore, we are currently considering a quasi-\n76 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 87 of 97\n  II. H. Body-worn Cameras \n              3.

We are also \nconsidering the practicalities and cost of using officer surveys, community \nsurveys, surveys of enforcement action subjects (e.g., arrested individuals, \nstop and frisk subjects) and videos of police-citizen interactions.   \nThe monitor team is working with the NYPD to develop a plan to \nimplement the BWC technology that will consider the time and resources \nrequired to acquire the cameras, wire the precincts to transfer videos via \nsecure  internet  connections,  train  officers  and  supervisors  on  policy  and \nprocedures, and undertake other important steps.  The NYPD has published \na Request for Proposal.  The NYPD anticipates a requirements contract that \nwould allow for the purchase and installation of up to 5,000 BWCs.  The \nmonitor has begun to identify, but not yet fully discuss or resolve, the legal \nand policy issues mentioned earlier.   \nSeveral important steps are needed before a BWC pilot can begin.  \nThese include moving forward on the NYPD procurement process, ensuring \nsufficient  technology  infrastructure  in  the  pilot  treatment  precincts,  and \n77 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 88 of 97\n   III.

The NYPD anticipates that because it needs to decide which \ntechnology suits its purposes best and to have an infrastructure plan in place \nto meet the requirements of a pilot of this magnitude, it could be as long as \ntwelve months before the pilot is started.  Once the cameras are in place, \nthere would be a one-year trial period. \nIII.  MEASURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT ORDERS \nThe monitor will be working with the parties to establish baselines \nfrom which to measure progress, set milestones for accomplishing reform, \nand assess the Department’s compliance with the court-ordered and agreed-\nupon remedial measures.  We will be using both quantitative and qualitative \nmeasures.  The monitor has asked both the NYPD and the plaintiffs for \nrecommendations for measuring success.  The hope is that these measures \nwill also be useful for the Department and will support its needs to assess its \nown success and that of its officers.  \n78 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 89 of 97\n \nAppendix 1 \nAPPENDIX 1 \nMONITOR TEAM \n \nPeter L.

He rose through the \nranks of the Lowell Police Department holding positions in patrol, as detective \nsupervisor and leader of a local, state and federal narcotics and organized crime \ntask force.  In 1994, Mr. Davis was promoted to Superintendent of the Lowell \nPolice Department and led that agency for thirteen years.  During his tenure, he \nintroduced a community policing philosophy that led to a more than 60% reduction \nin serious crime.  Lowell was recognized by Attorney General Janet Reno for its \nleadership  in  forming  close  relationships  with  the  community  that  drive  crime \nreduction.  \n \nIn 2006, Mr. Davis was appointed by Mayor Thomas Menino to lead the Boston \nPolice Department.  Davis worked to bring the BPD closer to the community.  He \nwas a constant presence in Boston’s troubled neighborhoods.  This community \npolicing philosophy led to a reduction of serious crime in Boston of more than \nthirty percent.  During the same period, there was also a reduction in arrests of \nthirty  percent.    Davis  is  an  accomplished  lecturer  in  police  leadership.    He \ncompleted a fellowship at Harvard’s Institute of Politics in 2014.  After managing \nseveral high–profile cases, including the Boston Strangler, the Craigslist Killer and \nthe tragic Boston Marathon bombing, Davis stepped down in 2013.

He was awarded the Young \nExperimental Scholar Award by the Academy of Experimental Criminology for \nsignificant contributions to experimental research.   \n \nDr. MacDonald’s research publications include numerous studies using rigorous \nquantitative methods to examine the effects of social policies on crime and of \ninstitutional social justice reforms on criminal justice practices.  His recent work \non racial disparities in criminal justice has appeared in the American Journal of \nPublic Health and the Journal of Legal Studies. \n \nJames McCabe is an Associate Professor, Department Chair and Director of the \nGraduate Program in Criminal Justice at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, CT.  \nHe joined the faculty at Sacred Heart after completing twenty-one years with the \nNew York City Police Department.  In the NYPD, he held numerous–command \nlevel  assignments,  including  Commanding  Officer  of  Labor  Relations, \nCommanding Officer of the Training Bureau, Commanding Officer of the Police \nAcademy and the Commanding Officer of the 110th Precinct in Elmhurst/Corona, \nQueens.  He  was  also  assigned  as  the  Executive  Officer  of  the  Police \nCommissioner’s Office and the 113th Precinct in South Jamaica.  He retired in \n2006  from  the  NYPD  with  the  rank  of  Inspector  to  assume  a  new  career  in \nacademia at Sacred Heart. \n \nDr. McCabe has a B.A. in Psychology from Queens College, an M.A. in Labor \nStudies from Empire State College, an M.A. in Criminal Justice from John Jay  \n82 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 235   Filed 07/09/15   Page 93 of 97\n \nAppendix 1 \nCollege, and a Ph.D. in Criminal Justice from the CUNY Graduate Center.  He is a \ngraduate of the 189th Session of the FBI National Academy, and of the Executive \nPrograms  at  Columbia  University’s  Police  Management  Institute  and  the  JFK \nSchool  of  Government  at  Harvard  University.    He  has  published  numerous \nscholarly articles and book chapters on the subject of police effectiveness and has \nbeen  the  principal  investigator  in  more  than  forty  studies  examining  police \noperations in twenty-six states and in every region of the country.  He has lectured \naround the country to both police and academic audiences about organizational \nbehavior,  leadership,  supervisory  communications,  and  the  impact  of  police \noperations on public safety and neighborhood satisfaction with police services. \n \nJane Perlov has an extensive background in risk management and a distinguished \ncareer in law enforcement, public safety and corporate security.  She served more \nthan twenty-five years in law enforcement, starting in 1981 as a police officer in \nthe New York City Police Department.  She rose through the ranks, ultimately \ncommanding the 20th and 30th Precincts in Manhattan and serving as Chief of \nDetectives for the Borough of Queens. In late 1998, while in that position she was \ninvited by Governor Cellucci of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to join his \nCabinet  as  Secretary  of  Public  Safety.    There,  she  managed  policy  and  fiscal \noversight  for  twenty-one  agencies,  boards  and  commissions,  such  as  the  State \nPolice and the Corrections Department.  \n \nIn 2001, Ms. Perlov was sworn in as Chief of Police for the capital city of Raleigh, \nNorth Carolina.  Under her leadership, the Department initiated a decentralized \ndistrict policing model that fostered strong bonds between police officers and the \nneighborhoods they served, and placed both opportunity and accountability in the \nhands of district commanders. \n \nFrom 2009 to 2011, Ms. Perlov served as Global Corporate Security Director of \nBank of America.  She was responsible for developing and implementing strategies \nand  programs  that  provided  a  safe  and  secure  environment  for  employees, \ncustomers and assets worldwide.

City of New York, Ligon v. City of New York, and\nDavis v. City of New York. These cases challenged the NYPD’s stop and frisk policies\nand practices (Floyd), and its policies and practices concerning criminal trespass\nenforcement in and around private buildings enrolled in the Trespass Affidavit Program\n(Ligon) and in New York City Housing Authority buildings (Davis). This report focuses\nonsignificant steps since myfirst report inJuly2015andthechallenges that lieahead.\nLet me highlight several findings and observations. To start, the Department\ndisseminated a new Patrol Guide procedure governing stops and frisks and a new\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 2 of 94\nHonorableAnalisaTorres\nFebruary16,2016\nPage2\nprocedure prohibiting racial profiling and bias-based policing. The Department also\ndeveloped and put in use new trainingmaterials for recruit classes and conducted training\nfor Field Training Officers, who work with probationary officers just out of the Police\nAcademy as they move to their assignments in the field. Other steps include the\ndevelopment of reference materials on stop and frisk issues, their placement on the\nDepartment’s intranet site and dissemination to all officers. A pilot program was\nconducted in seven commands using a draft stop report form that will be the basis of a\nnew stop form for use throughout the Department, after court approval. Some auditing\npractices were changed, and an audit work plan for 2016 is in the works. During this\nperiod, too, the Department’s dealings with the monitorship were put under the control of\nthe Department’s second highest official, First Deputy Commissioner Benjamin B.\nTucker.\nThe progress the report details owes much to the hard work of NYPD officials\nand valuable input from the plaintiffs. All parties worked diligently, collaboratively and\ningoodfaith.\nThe work during this time also brought into sharp focus major challenges ahead.\nChief among these is ensuring that written changes in policies are carried out in\npractice—in the Police Academy, in the precincts and other commands, by supervisors\nand,ultimately,inencounters betweenofficers andcivilians.\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 3 of 94\nHonorableAnalisaTorres\nFebruary16,2016\nPage3\nAs you know, the last four years have seen a dramatic decrease in the number of\nreported stops. The 685,724 stop reports filed in 2011 compare with 45,787 filed in 2014\nandapproximately24,000in2015. However,as myfirst report stressed, thefocus should\nnot be on the number of stops per se, but rather on the lawfulness of the stops and\nwhether the encounters are conducted in accordance with the Department’s principles of\n“courtesy, professionalism and respect.” The NYPD’s stop and frisk practices and the\nrelated practices regarding trespass enforcement that led to this monitorship exacerbated\ntensions between the NYPD and some communities the Department serves, particularly\nminorityandimmigrant communities.\nGetting stop and frisk and related trespass enforcement practices right is\nimportant, but that does not mean eliminating the practices. The court did not rule that\nthey are prohibited. When conducted lawfully and professionally, they are valuable and\nlegitimate law enforcement tools. Getting it right means this: that police officers\nunderstand their lawful authority and limit their activities to what is permitted by law;\nthat officers do not avoid enforcement activities when appropriate; that they treat the\npeople with whom they interact professionally, with dignity and respect and in ways best\ndesigned to protect the safety of civilians and officers; and, finally, that officers\ndocument theiractivities as requiredbylawand Department policy.\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 4 of 94\nHonorableAnalisaTorres\nFebruary16,2016\nPage4\nThose elements, broadly speaking, reflect the goals of the court orders and the\nparties’ agreements, which, notably, overlap with the goals for the Department described\nbyCommissionerBratton.\nOf course, transformation of any large government organization is a difficult\nundertaking. It is apparent from focus group sessions and discussions with individual\nofficers throughout the ranks that many police officers, including supervisors, are not\nwell informed as yet about the changes underway or the reasons for them and, therefore,\nhave yet to internalize them. Many appear not to understand what is expected of them.\nIf, as the Commissioner has stated, the court-ordered changes and agreements among the\nparties will improve the Department, and advance the safety of both communities and\nofficers, that message needs to be communicated and reinforced better, not just at the top,\nbut throughout theDepartment.\nUltimately, this is a challenge of leadership, particularly for those who supervise\nofficers engaged day-to-day in enforcement activities—sergeants, their immediate\nsupervisors, and the precinct and unit commanders who set the tone for those under them.\nThe challenge here implicates every aspect of the court orders and the parties’\nagreements, and it will not be met without changes in policies, training, supervision, and\nall the ways the NYPD incentivizes good police behavior and discourages unacceptable\nbehavior. This is alarge task that will taketimeandsubstantial effort toaccomplish.\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 5 of 94\nHonorableAnalisaTorres\nFebruary16,2016\nPage5\nBefore closing, I want to underscore a few particular developments and concerns\ncoveredinthe report.\nTraining. In my discussions with NYPD executives, they have emphasized that\nthey view training improvements as a high priority. With respect to the subjects covered\nby the court orders and the parties’ agreements, the Department has revised some of its\ntrainingfor recruits and FieldTrainingOfficers. However,as theDepartment recognizes,\nthere needs to be training or retraining of all the members of the service, a much more\nfar-reaching undertaking. The Department is currently drafting new in-service training\nmaterials.\nSupervision. If the changes required by the court orders and the parties’\nagreements are to be implemented and take hold, the supervisors who have most to do\nwith the officers on the street must play an increased leadership role. This includes\nespecially sergeants, who are closest to the officers, and precinct and unit commanders,\nwhoset the tone. These supervisors must ensure that theirsubordinates are implementing\nthe changes required by the court orders and the parties’ agreements—that the stops,\nfrisks and trespass arrests made by their officers are legal and proper and that these\nactivities are correctly documented. Supervisors must take a more active role in\noversight, teaching and, when appropriate, discipline. The new Department Patrol Guide\nprocedure governing stops and frisks requires, for example, that supervisors, if they are\nnot at the scene, speak to the officer who made the stop to determine whether there was\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 6 of 94\nHonorableAnalisaTorres\nFebruary16,2016\nPage6\nsufficient basis for it, as well as for the frisk or search, if either occurred. The supervisor\nmust direct that the officer make corrections to the stop report form if it is inaccurate or\nincomplete, and, if appropriate, instruct the officer or refer him or her for additional\ntrainingorotherremedial action,includingdisciplinaryactionifwarranted.\nA note regarding discipline: although most officers understand that discipline is\nappropriate for deliberate violations of law or policy, they often express fear they will\nface serious disciplinary action or not be indemnified in lawsuits over minor or\ninadvertent mistakes in documentation or for isolated cases of erroneous but good-faith\nstops or frisks. Actually, the new Patrol Guide Section 212-11 announces a contrary\npolicyfor the Police Department, and, as far as can be determined, officers have not been\ndenied indemnification for minor infractions or reasonable, honest mistakes. Sergeants\nand other supervisors need to take an active role in tryingto correct these misperceptions,\nespecially as they may affect decisions by some officers to make or refrain from making\nappropriatestops.\nBody-worn cameras. According to the Department, procurement of body-worn\ncameras for the pilot program ordered by the court will not be completed until late\nsummer 2016, at the earliest. In the meantime, there is much to do, including the\npromulgation of policies related to the use of the cameras and production of training\nmaterials.\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 7 of 94\nHonorableAnalisaTorres\nFebruary16,2016\nPage7\nSince my first report, there have been two major developments. First, the court\napproved, with the consent of the parties, a change in the pilot program’s design to allow\na controlled experiment, matching officers who will wear cameras with those who will\nnot. Second, the Department has changed how it will develop body-worn camera\npolicies. According to the Department’s new plans, as described to me in a November\n24, 2015 letter (see Appendix 2 to the report), there will be significant outreach to\ninternal and external stakeholders seeking views on alternative policy proposals. This\nmonth, the Department is to begin reaching out to officers of every rank, unions,\ncommunity members and organizations, criminal justice stakeholders, including the\ncourts, district attorneys and defender organizations, victims’ advocacy groups, privacy\ngroups, the CityCouncil, external oversight agencies and other interested parties. This is\na very positive development. The use of body-worn cameras raises some difficult policy\nissues and choices, and inevitably not everyone will agree. But interested parties should\nhaveavoiceand awaytomaketheirviews known.\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 8 of 94\nHonorableAnalisaTorres\nFebruary16,2016\nPage8\nFurtherdetails ontheseandothersubjects arecontainedinthereport.\nThank youforthe court’s timeandattention.\nRespectfullysubmitted,\n/s/ Peter L.Zimroth\nPeter L.

Introduction\nThis is the second report of the Independent Monitor overseeing implementation\nof the court orders and the parties’ agreements in the cases Floyd v. City of New York,\nLigon v. City of New York and Davis v. City of New York. Those orders and agreements\ncall for reforms of the NYPD’s practices related to stop and frisk, trespass enforcement\n(i.e., stops and arrests for trespass) and bias-free policing in those areas—specifically,\nchanges in policy, training, supervision, handling of complaints and discipline, auditing\nand performance measurement as well as a pilot program testing the use of body-worn\ncameras (BWCs). The report covers the period from July 1, 2015, through the date of\nthis report.\nIn the period leading up to the monitor’s first report in July 2015, the NYPD was\njust beginning work on revising its policies relating to stop and frisk and trespass\nenforcement. The Department had started the process of changing its Patrol Guide to\nconform its policies totherequirements contained inthecourt orders. Asignificant focus\nof the first half of 2015 was on the development of training for a recruit class that started\ninJanuary2015.\nThis report discusses progress in several key areas since then and the challenges\nthat lie ahead. Chief among the challenges is ensuring that written changes in policies\nand training material are carried out in practice—in the Police Academy, in the precincts\nand other commands, by supervisors, and, ultimately, in encounters between officers and\ncivilians.\n1\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 16 of 94\nI. Introduction\nSignificantSteps SincetheLastMonitor’s Report\nAs oftheendof2015,theNYPDhas, amongotherthings:\n Published and disseminated a new Patrol Guide procedure governing stops\nandfrisks;\n Published and disseminated a new Patrol Guide procedure prohibiting racial\nprofilingandotherbias-basedpolicing;\n Developed training materials for recruits at the Police Academy and presented\nthose materials to three recruit classes (those beginning in January, July and\nOctober2015);\n Conducted training for Field Training Officers (FTOs), who work with\nprobationary officers just out of the Police Academy as they move to their\nassignments inthefield;\n Developed reference materials on stop and frisk issues, put them up on the\nNYPDintranet siteanddisseminatedthem toall members oftheservice;\n Conducted a pilot program in which officers in seven commands (five\nprecincts, a Transit District and a housing Police Service Area (PSA)) used a\nrevised stop report form that will be the basis of a new stop report form for\nusethroughout the Department,aftercourt approval;\n Changed some of its auditing practices and begun developing an audit work\nplanfor2016; and\n Reorganized the way in which the Department deals with the monitorship by\nplacing the Risk Management Bureau (RMB) under the control of the First\nDeputyCommissioner, BenjaminB.Tucker.\n2\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 17 of 94\nI. Introduction\nSignificantChallenges\nThe last four years have seen a dramatic decrease in the number of reported stops.\nThe 685,724 stop reports filed in 2011 compares with 45,787 reported in 2014 and\napproximately 24,000 in 2015. However, as the monitor’s first report stressed, the focus\nshould not be on the number of stops per se, but rather on the lawfulness of the stops and\nwhether the encounters are conducted in accordance with the Department’s principles of\n“courtesy, professionalism and respect.” The NYPD’s stop and frisk practices and the\nrelated practices regarding trespass enforcement that led to this monitorship exacerbated\ntensions between the NYPD and some communities the Department serves, particularly\nminorityandimmigrant communities.\nGetting stop and frisk and related trespass enforcement practices right is\nimportant, but it does not mean eliminatingthe practices. The court did not rule that they\nare prohibited. When conducted lawfully and professionally, they are valuable and\nlegitimate law enforcement tools. Getting it right means at least this: that police officers\nunderstand their lawful authority and limit their activities to what is permitted by law;\nthat officers do not avoid enforcement activities when appropriate; that they treat the\npeople with whom they interact professionally, with dignity and respect and in ways best\ndesigned to protect the safety of civilians and officers; and, finally, that officers\ndocument theiractivities as requiredbylawand NYPDpolicy.\nThose elements, broadly speaking, reflect the goals of the court orders and the\nparties’ agreements, which overlap with the goals for the NYPD. Commissioner William\nJ. Bratton has stated repeatedlythat officers should be concerned with the qualityof their\nenforcement activities—including stop and frisk and trespass enforcement—rather than\n3\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 18 of 94\nI. Introduction\nquantity. The monitor’s team has heard similar statements by those leading Compstat\nsessions, a key part of NYPD’s crime management system (described more fully on\npages 67-68below).\nOf course, transformation of any large government organization is a difficult\nundertaking. It is apparent from focus group sessions and discussions with individual\nofficers throughout the ranks that many police officers, including supervisors, are not\nwell-informed as yet of the changes underwayor the reasons for them and therefore have\nyet to internalize them. Many appear not to understand what is expected of them. If, as\nCommissioner Bratton has stated, the changes required by the court orders and the\nparties’ agreements will improve the NYPD and advance the safety of both communities\nand police officers, that message needs to be communicated and reinforced better, not\njust at thetop,but throughout theDepartment.\nUltimately, this is a challenge of leadership, particularly for those who supervise\nofficers engaged in day-to-day enforcement activities—sergeants, their immediate\nsupervisors, and the precinct and unit commanders who set the tone for those under them.\nThis challenge implicates every aspect of the court orders and the parties’ agreements,\nand it will not be met without changes in policies, training, supervision, and all the ways\nthe NYPD incentivizes good police behavior and discourages unacceptable behavior.\nThis is alargetask that will taketimeandsubstantial effort toaccomplish.\n4\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 19 of 94\nII.TheMonitor’s Work\nReport Format\nLike the monitor’s previous report, this update sets out what is required by the\ncourt orders and the parties’ agreements in the relevant cases (milestones), the status of\ntheNYPD’s remedial efforts, andthemonitor’s assessment ofcompliancetodate.\nII. TheMonitor’s Work\nDuring the six months from July to December 2015, the monitor and his team\ncontinued to meet with members of the NYPD and its units, such as the Police Academy,\nQuality Assurance Division (QAD), Risk Management Bureau, Information Technology\nBureau and others. The team observed Compstat meetings, conducted focus groups and\nhad conversations with officers and supervisors, made site visits to precincts and borough\ncommands, and observed training at the Police Academy and disciplinary trials in the\nNYPD trial room. A member of the monitor team toured each precinct in the city in\npreparation for a controlled pilot study of body-worn cameras, described in Section VI\nbelow. The team reviewed voluminous NYPD documents, including audits, stop report\nforms, complaint investigation files and NYPD data. The monitor and his team have also\nmet with plaintiffs’ counsel, community organizations, the Civilian Complaint Review\nBoard (CCRB)andother entities.\nSignificant time has been spent working with both the plaintiffs and the NYPD in\ndeveloping training materials and policy. Whenever possible, the monitor has sought to\nfind common ground, with the goal that the parties agree on a final document for\napproval. Both the NYPD and the plaintiffs have been working with the monitor\ndiligently, collaborativelyandin goodfaithtodevelopthe reforms tobe implemented. In\nthe process, cooperation and trust has increased among those involved—an important\n5\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 20 of 94\nII.TheMonitor’s Work\ndevelopment for accomplishing revisions of police practices and enhancing police-\ncommunityrelations.\nIn addition, the monitor has worked with the parties and the court on developinga\nprocess to determine which documents should be submitted to the court for approval and\nwhich can be approved by the monitor without further court action. Many documents,\ncertain training materials for example, are being updated and changed as the Department,\nthe parties and the monitor learn from seeing these materials in use. In general, once the\ncourt approves materials or written policies, further changes or additions to those\nmaterials or policies are approved bythe monitor and not submitted to the court when the\nnew material does not make significant substantive alterations to language the court has\nalready cleared. Any party that disagrees with the monitor’s determination not to submit\nadocument tothecourt mayseekcourt redress.\nThere is now a website for following the monitoring efforts\n(www.nypdmonitor.org). The site went live onOctober 31, 2015. Visitors to the website\ncan access the following: monitor reports, court opinions and orders, revised NYPD\npolicies, training materials, information on the body-worn camera pilot, information on\nthe Joint Remedial Process, links and resources related to the monitoring effort, and an\nopportunity for the public to provide feedback to the monitor.

NYPD Policies\nA.Stop and Frisk Policies\nIII. NYPD Policies\nA. Stop and Frisk Policies\n1. Milestones\nThe NYPD’s policies and procedures governing stops and frisks are set out in the\nDepartment’s Patrol Guide. This is one waythat the Department communicates guidance\nand instruction about what officers can and cannot do under the law and what their\nsupervisors expect of them. In its opinion, the court found that the Patrol Guide did not\nadequately describe the legal standards governing stops or the degree of knowledge an\nofficer must have to make a stop lawful. The Patrol Guide procedures also did not state\nthe legal requirements for a frisk or search, which are separate from the requirement for a\nstop. The court did not require changes in these legal standards, only that they be stated\ncorrectlyandclearly.\nUnder the court orders, as agreed to by the City and the Department, the Patrol\nGuidemust:\n1. State what constitutes a stop, when a stop may be conducted, when a frisk\nmaybeconductedandwhenasearchmaybeconducted;\n2. Require officers to document stops and frisks and the reasonable suspicion\nforeach,bothonastopreport form andinofficers’activitylogs; and\n3. Have procedures for supervisory review of stops, including an assessment\nof the constitutionality of the stop and not just that a stop report form\n(previouslycalled aUF-250)was completed.\n7\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 22 of 94\nIII. NYPD Policies\nA.Stop and Frisk Policies\n2. Status and Assessment\nThe monitor submitted tothe court the NYPD’s new procedures on stop and frisk,\nPatrol Guide(P.G.) 212-11, Investigative Encounters:Requests for Information,Common\nLaw Inquiry and Level 3 Stops, which the court approved on August 24, 2015. The\nNYPD issued an Interim Order on September 16, 2015, and disseminated the procedures\nto all members of the service. The effective date of the procedures was September 21,\n2015.\nThe revised Patrol Guide meets the requirements of the court orders and the\nparties’ agreement. It states when an officer may make a Terry stop and includes a\ndefinition of reasonable suspicion. It states that reasonable suspicion for a stop does not\ngive an officer the authority to make a frisk; an officer must have reasonable suspicion\nthat theperson stoppedis armedanddangerous to frisk that person.\nPrior to issuance of the new P.G. 212-11, there were no procedures in the Patrol\nGuide that addressed encounters between officers and civilians that were less intrusive\nthan a stop or an arrest. All such encounters are governed by the New York State Court\nof Appeals decision in People v. DeBour, which sets out four levels of encounters,\nestablishing the standards for each.1 For a simple Request for Information (Level 1), the\nofficer must have an “objective, credible reason” to make the approach and request; for a\nCommon Law Right of Inquiry (Level 2), where an officer can ask accusatory questions,\nthe officer must have a “founded suspicion” of some criminality; to stop and detain a\nperson to investigate (Level 3), an officer must have “reasonable suspicion” that the\nindividual committed, is committing or is about to commit a felony or Penal Law\n1 40N.Y.2d210(1976).\n8\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 23 of 94\nIII. NYPD Policies\nA.Stop and Frisk Policies\nmisdemeanor; for an arrest (Level 4), an officer must have probable cause. P.G. 212-11\nprovides guidance to officers about the distinction between voluntary investigative\ncontacts (Level 1 and Level 2 encounters) and forcible stops (Level 3 Terry stops), which\nmust be based on reasonable suspicion. The procedures define “objective, credible\nreason,” “founded suspicion”and“reasonablesuspicion.”\nThe approved procedures in the new Patrol Guide section require documentation\nof all stops and make more explicit the responsibilities of supervising officers up the\nchain of command. An officer’s immediate supervisor should respond to the scene when\nfeasible. The supervisor is also required to discuss the circumstances of the stop with the\nofficer who made the stop, and then review the stop and any frisk and search, if\nconducted,anddeterminewhethertheofficer’s actions wereappropriate.\nIf a stop report is inaccurate or incomplete, the supervisor must direct the officer\nto make the necessarycorrections. Supervisors also have the responsibilityof identifying\nofficers who need instruction, additional training or other remedial action, including, if\nappropriate, discipline. However, the procedures are clear that the goal is to make\nimprovements to ensure compliance. Isolated cases of good-faith mistakes made by\nofficers tryingto do their jobs will be dealt with bytrainingat the command level and not\nbydiscipline. As statedintheprocedures:\nIn most instances, instruction and training should be\naccomplished at the command level. The application of the law\nin this area can be complicated, and investigative encounters are\nfluid situations in which one event or observation can alter the\nlevel of suspicion or danger. A single erroneous judgment will\nnot generally warrant referral to the Legal Bureau for training.\nHowever, members who evince a lack of comprehension of the\ncore concepts of the law governing this procedure should be\nreferredtothe Legal Bureau.\n9\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 24 of 94\nIII. NYPD Policies\nA.Stop and Frisk Policies\nOf course, officers should be disciplined when they engage in deliberate or\nrepeated violations of the Patrol Guide. But the above statement in the Patrol Guide is\nimportant because it addresses a commonly expressed fear of officers—that they will be\nharshly penalized for minor mistakes of documentation, or in isolated cases of good-faith\nmistakes by officers trying to do their jobs. Many officers do not appear to be aware of\nthis provisioninthenewPatrol Guide.\nAnother important change to this Patrol Guide section relates to providing the\nperson stopped with an explanation for the stop. In its remedial order, the court said that\ntheNYPDshould considerprovidinga form or cardtopeoplestopped that wouldprovide\nthem with the badge numbers of the officers and some information about why they were\nstopped, and about agencies that handle complaints from civilians. The new Patrol Guide\nsection states that, absent exigent circumstances, officers should provide people stopped\nbut not arrested with an explanation of the reasons for the stop and an information card.\nIn connection with this requirement, the Department created a new “tear-off receipt” and\ninstituted a pilot program in seven commands to test this form. Because this was a pilot\nprogram,the court was not askedtoapprovethecontents ofthetear-off receipt. Thepilot\nprogram began in July 2015. When the new P.G. 212-11 went into effect in September,\nthe NYPD began using the pilot tear-off receipt citywide. This receipt contains the\nfollowing information: the officer’s name, command and badge number, a link to the\nNYPD website, the CCRB and Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) phone numbers, and\n10\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 25 of 94\nIII. NYPD Policies\nB. Racial ProfilingPolicies\ncheckboxes for the factors contributing to the officer’s suspicion that led tothe stop. The\nDepartment is analyzing lessons learned from the pilot program and exploring alternative\nways toprovideinformationtopeoplestoppedbut not arrested.\nApproval of P.G. 212-11 was an important step. However, as noted in the\nIntroduction, ensuring that the Patrol Guide is followed in practice will require effective\nchanges intraining,supervision,auditingandincentives.\nB. Racial ProfilingPolicies\n1. Milestones\nThe court orders and the parties’ agreements require the NYPD to revise its Patrol\nGuide prohibition on racial profiling. The new procedures must state that race, ethnicity\nor national origin maybe considered by officers in taking police enforcement action only\nwhen it is part of a specific and reliable suspect description, and that racially defined\ngroups may not be targeted for stops in general simply because they appear more\nfrequentlyinlocal crime suspect data.\n2. Status and assessment\nThe NYPD’s policy barring racial profiling and other bias-based policing, P.G.\n203-25, was submitted to the court and approved on August 24, 2015. The policy was\nthen published and distributed by the NYPD. The new procedure states that police\naction, including stops, frisks, arrests or other law enforcement actions, may not be\nmotivated, even in part, bythe actual or perceived color, ethnicityor national origin of an\nindividual. Race may be used only if it is part of a reliable and specific suspect\n11\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 26 of 94\nIII. NYPD Policies\nC.Trespass AffidavitProgram(TAP)\ndescription that includes not just race, gender and age, but other identifying\ncharacteristics orinformation.\nThe procedures also include a description of Section 14-151 of the New York\nCity Administrative Code prohibiting bias-based profiling. The Administrative Code\nincludes demographic categories in addition to race, color and national origin: creed,\nage, alienage or citizenship status, gender, sexual orientation, disability and housing\nstatus.\nTraining on the new policy is in its early stages. Assessment of the policy’s\nimplementation must wait until training is further along. Moreover, determining whether\nthe NYPD is in compliance with the new policy and the related requirements of the\nFourteenth Amendment is complicated and may involve several yardsticks, including\nboth qualitative and statistical measures. The monitor has asked the parties to suggest\ncompliance measures (see Section XI below). The plaintiffs have provided some\npreliminary suggestions, the NYPD has responded and the monitor will be discussing\ntheseissues withtheparties.\nC. Policies Related tothe Trespass AffidavitProgram(TAP)\n1. Milestones\nIn Ligon v. City of New York, the court issued a preliminary injunction against\ncertain NYPD practices related to stops outside buildings enrolled in the Trespass\nAffidavit Program (TAP) in the Bronx and ordered specific changes to P.G. 212-59\ngoverning interior patrols in TAP buildings applicable to stops in the Bronx.2 The new\npolicy must state: (1) the circumstances in which it is permissible to stop a person\n2 Ligon v. City of New York, 925 F. Supp. 2d 478 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (preliminary injunction); Floyd v.\nCityofNewYork,959F.Supp.2d668,689(S.D.N.Y.2013)(remediesdecision).\n12\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 27 of 94\nIII. NYPD Policies\nC.Trespass AffidavitProgram(TAP)\noutside a TAP building on suspicion of trespass; (2) that stops inside and outside TAP\nbuildings must complywith the new stop and frisk policies; and (3) that “mere presence”\nin a TAP building, and entry into or exit from a TAP building, do not constitute an\n“objectivecrediblereason”fora DeBour Level 1 approach andrequest for information.\n2. Status and Assessment\nThe NYPD prepared a revised draft P.G. 212-59 for review by the plaintiffs and\nthe monitor. The Ligon plaintiffs have made suggested edits, and subsequent draft\nversions of the policy have been exchanged. The parties have not yet reached an\nagreement onafinal versionofP.G.212-59.\nThe Ligon plaintiffs and the Cityand NYPD continue to negotiate a settlement on\nissues that were not addressed in the Ligon preliminaryinjunction and related order. This\nsettlement, if reached, will likely include additional modifications to P.G. 212-59. For\nthis reason, the monitor has not made any final recommendations to the court for\napproval of a new P.G. 212-59. Should negotiations be completed, a new P.G. 212-59\nfor interior patrols of TAP buildings will be finalized, adopted and implemented. If a\nsettlement is not reached, the monitor will work with the parties to revise P.G. 212-59 so\nit meets therequirements ofthepreliminaryinjunctionandrelatedremedial order.\n13\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 28 of 94\nIII. NYPD Policies\nD.New York CityHousing(NYCHA)\nD. New York CityHousingAuthority(NYCHA) Policies\n1. Milestones\nOn April 28, 2015, the court in Davis v. City of New York gave final approval to\nthe settlement between the City and the plaintiffs. The settlement requires revisions to\nP.G. 212-60, which concerns interior patrols of NYCHA buildings. The settlement also\nrequires changes to related NYPD training materials and the use of a revised Trespass\nCrimes Fact Sheet, an NYPD form used byofficers to describe the circumstances leading\nto or supporting an arrest for trespass. The court-approved policy states that officers\nmust have an objective, credible reason to approach a person in or around a NYCHA\nbuilding, and that simply entering, being in, or exiting a NYCHA building is not an\nobjectivecrediblereason foranapproach.\n2. Status and Assessment\nThe language of P.G. 212-60 was agreed to as part of the Davis settlement and\nhas already been approved by the court in Davis, so further revision or submission for\napproval is unnecessary. With the consent of the other parties, the NYPD postponed\npublication of P.G. 212-60 owing to three factors, only the third of which remains\nrelevant. First, the parties thought it appropriate to defer publication until the policy for\nstops and frisks (P.G. 212-11) was approved and disseminated. This has now been done.\nSecond, it was agreed that the procedures for NYCHA interior patrols should align\nwhenever possible with the procedures for patrol of TAP buildings. There have been\nongoing negotiations between the parties in Ligon over P.G. 212-59 (TAP). However,\n14\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 29 of 94\nIII. NYPD Policies\nE. Stop ReportForm\nthe parties have now agreed that any revisions to P.G. 212-59 will not hold up the\npublicationofP.G.212-60.\nThird, there is ongoing discussion among the parties about the creation of a new\nTrespass Crimes Fact Sheet that would cover criminal trespass arrests in both NYCHA\nand TAP buildings. In that fact sheet, officers document and provide information about\ntrespass arrests. The plaintiffs and the Department agree that it does not make sense to\nhave one form for trespass arrests in NYCHA buildings and a different form for trespass\narrests in TAP buildings. The Department and the Ligon and Davis plaintiffs have shared\ndrafts of a Trespass Crimes Fact Sheet that could be used in either type of building. The\nDepartment has shared drafts with the city’s five district attorneys and heard their\nconcerns. Once the Department has reviewed these concerns, it will propose a draft\nTrespass Crimes Fact Sheet for consideration by the Ligon and Davis plaintiffs and the\nmonitor.\nE. Stop Report Form\n1. Milestones\nThe court orders and the parties’ agreements require that the NYPD develop and\nimplement a new stop report form to be used by officers every time a person is stopped.\nThe new form must document an officer’s stop and be used by supervisors to evaluate\nwhether the stop, and the frisk and search, if conducted, was done properly and in\naccordance with law. A stop report form is also a teaching tool that can be used both for\ntrainingandas part ofoperations toreinforce forofficers theapplicablestandards forstop\nandfrisk.\n15\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 30 of 94\nIII. NYPD Policies\nE. Stop ReportForm\nThenewform must have anarrativesectionfordescribingthe reasons for thestop\nas well as a separate narrative section for describing the reasons for the frisk and the\nsearch, if conducted. The court found that without narrative sections, the current version\nof the stop form, which has only checkboxes for the factors leading to the stop, did not\nprovide sufficient information to determine whether a stop was based on reasonable\nsuspicion. The court required simplified and improved checkbox categories and a place\non the form for the officer to record, in his or her own words, the basis for the stop and,\nseparately, for the frisk and search, if conducted.

Status and Assessment\nA new stop report form designed bythe NYPD has been in use in a pilot program\nsince July 2015. That pilot form includes a narrative section for the officer to describe\nthe basis for a stop and a separate narrative section to describe the basis for a frisk and\nsearch, if conducted. It eliminates “furtive movement,” “high crime area” and\n“suspicious bulge” as checkbox categories. The pilot form also has a new section that\nrequires the officer’s supervisor to confirm that he or she reviewed the constitutionality\nofthestopanddiscussed thefacts ofthestopwiththeofficer. Thesupervisormust check\na box indicating whether or not: (1) the basis of the stop was reviewed with the officer;\n(2) the report was accurate and complete; (3) the supervisor was present on the scene; (4)\nthe corresponding activity log entry was reviewed; (5) there was a sufficient basis for the\n16\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 31 of 94\nIII. NYPD Policies\nE. Stop ReportForm\nstop; and (6) there was a sufficient basis for the frisk or search, if conducted. The\nsupervisormust also notewhetheranycorrective actionwas taken,if appropriate.\nThe pilot program ran in five precincts, a Transit District and a housing PSA for\n90 days, from July 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015. There were two versions of the\nstop report form used for the pilot. A smaller version of the form was designed to fit into\nan officer’s memo book without being folded. Instructions for completing the form were\nprinted on a separate document that also fit into the officer’s memo book. A larger\nversion of the stop report form was printed on an 8½ x 14 sheet of paper, with the\ninstructions on the back of the form. The two stop report forms differed in size and\nformat only—the content was identical. Four commands started with the smaller form\nand three commands started with the larger one. After 45 days, the pilot commands\nswitched forms so that each command used both forms. Almost 600 stop reports were\npreparedduringthepilot.\nThe Risk Management Bureau (RMB) oversaw the pilot program, conducting\ntraining on the new forms for the members of the pilot commands, monitoring use of the\nforms, conducting focus groups of officers and supervisors, and administering surveys.\nTraining regarding the pilot program also was provided at promotional classes for\nsergeants, lieutenants and captains. Surveys were distributed to officers inthe seven pilot\ncommands to elicit feedback about the content of the stop forms and the ergonomics and\nclarity of the two versions. In addition, the Quality Assurance Division (QAD) reviewed\nthe stop forms from the pilot commands for potential deficiencies, including whether the\nstop report form articulated reasonable suspicion for the stop and, if conducted, the frisk\nandsearch.\n17\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 32 of 94\nIII. NYPD Policies\nE. Stop ReportForm\nThe RMB analyzed the data as well to determine whether there were qualitative\ndifferences between the two versions of the report form when completed, whether the\nofficers expressed a preference and, if so, whether using the preferred form increased the\nlikelihood that the report would be filled out accurately. The Department has made\nrecommendations for revising the new form and the plaintiffs have made additional\nsuggestions. The monitor will work with the parties to finalize the form and submit it to\nthecourt for approval.\nOnce the new stop report form is approved, the Department will need to change\nits SQF(stop,questionandfrisk)databasetoconform tothenewform,providein-service\ntrainingon thenewform,andreviseexistingprocedures and trainingmaterials as needed.\nThe NYPD is also developing a new online records management system that will\nincorporate the new stop report form. When the new records management system is\ncompleted, police officers will be able to access and prepare the stop report on their\nsmartphones andtablets.\nThe Department is continuing to analyze the information from the pilot program.\nHowever, it has shared several observations. The NYPD found that there was a 20\npercent greater reduction in reported stops in the commands that were using the new\nforms, compared to other commands throughout the city that were using the current form\n(formerly known as the UF-250). The NYPD noted, however, that whenever a new\nprocedure or form is rolled out, there is generally a temporary decrease in activity or use\nof the form. The stop report form also documents whether a tear-off receipt was given to\npersons stopped but not arrested. In the pilot, absent exigent circumstances, the officers\nwere required to offer the tear-off receipt to persons stopped but not arrested. For the\n18\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 33 of 94\nIII. NYPD Policies\nE. Stop ReportForm\npilot, the NYPD found that in a significant number of stops, officers did not give the tear-\noff receipt to persons stopped but not arrested. There are several possible reasons for\nthis. For example, the officer might not have offered the receipt because of exigent\ncircumstances; or the person stopped might have walked away before the receipt was\noffered; or,contrarytopolicy,theofficermight not haveofferedthe receipt.\nThe Quality Assurance Division also reviewed the forms to assess whether\nofficers appropriately articulated reasonable suspicion for the stops, reasonable suspicion\nthat the person stopped was armed and dangerous for those stops where a frisk was\nconducted, and an appropriate basis for the search, if conducted. QAD found that 28\npercent of the stop report forms analyzed did not properly articulate reasonable suspicion\nfor the stop, 27 percent of the forms documenting a frisk did not properly articulate\nreasonable suspicion for the frisk, and 16 percent of the forms documenting searches did\nnot show an appropriate basis for the search. In almost every case in which QAD found\ninsufficient basis for the stop, frisk or search, the supervisor in that command nonetheless\nhad signed off on the report and noted there was sufficient basis for the stop, frisk or\nsearch.\nAlthough the pilot was conducted before the new stop and frisk policies were\nissued, QAD’s analysis does illustrate the gaps in knowledge among officers, reinforcing\nthe importance of new in-service training on the revised stop and frisk policies and the\n19\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 34 of 94\nIV.Training\nA.PoliceAcademy\nnew stop report form, and of the role of supervisors in evaluating the constitutionality of\nstops and frisks. These are matters of concern on which the monitor will be reporting in\nthefuture.\nIV. Training\nA. Monitors’Observations of PoliceAcademyTraining\nIn the monitor’s discussions with NYPD executives, they have emphasized that\ntheyview training improvements as a high priorityand want to make significant changes.\nFor example, the Department has embraced the concept of experiential training. It has\ndedicated a group of excellent instructors to develop scenarios that can be used in the\nmock environments at the new Police Academy and elsewhere. Beginning in October\n2015, recruits were sent to precincts for twelve days where they partnered with officers,\nmet with members of the community and were oriented to what they would face upon\ngraduation. All this was to give the recruits more context for their classroom training. In\nthe period covered bythis report, the Department has produced new training material and\nis in the process of developing more substantial changes. In doing so, it has retained\nwell-respected outside experts, reached out to other police departments, and welcomed\ntheadviceof experts onthemonitorteam andthoseretainedbytheplaintiffs.\nThe Department recognizes that more work needs to be done and, as stated, has\nwelcomed suggestions. To that end, and as part of the monitor’s role, the monitor team\nspent manyhours at the Police Academyobserving classes and role-playscenarios on the\nsubjects relevant to the monitor’s mandate—stop and frisk, racial profiling, and housing\nand interior patrols. The team saw classes for recruits in the January 2015 recruit class\nand then again for the June and October recruit classes. The team saw many instructors,\n20\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 35 of 94\nIV.Training\nA.PoliceAcademy\nsometimes observing the same teacher present the same material to different classes, and\noften seeing the same material taught by different teachers. Based on these observations,\nthe monitor provided the NYPD with the team’s views and recommendations for\nimprovements in Academy training. Written training materials are important, and the\nrecruit training materials discussed in the sections below were developed after thoughtful\nreview and revisions. However, written materials are just one piece of effective training.\nUnless the materials are communicated effectively, they will not be as useful as they\nshouldbe.\n1. TeachingQuality\nThe quality of the instruction at the Police Academy is mixed. The monitor and\nhis team observed some excellent teaching and some poor teaching. This unevenness\nsuggests the Academy should develop a more rigorous program of instructor\ndevelopment. Although instructors must now attend a course on Methods of Instruction\nfocused on adult learning techniques, Academy instructors could use additional training\nto help them become more effective teachers. For example, strong teachers could be\npartnered as mentors with new teachers or weaker teachers to help them improve their\nteaching skills. If the performance of weak teachers does not improve, consideration\nshouldbegiventoremovingthem from the classroom.\nInstructors would also profit from additional training in the substantive areas\nrelevant to their teaching duties; for example, advanced seminars in social psychology,\nhistory and law. There is a substantial literature that relates these disciplines to police\nwork, and instructors should be familiar with this literature. It was evident from\nobserving lessons delivered by some instructors that simply providing a lesson plan,\n21\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 36 of 94\nIV.Training\nA.PoliceAcademy\nstudent guide and a two-week course in Methods of Instruction on top of their own\nexperiences is not sufficient to deliver quality instruction for officers in the increasingly\ncomplex andchangingworldof21st-centurypolicing.\n2. CurriculumDevelopment\nAs for the court-approved lesson plans, student guides and PowerPoint slides,\nthey are a good start. However, the curriculum should use other teaching methods as\nwell; for example, developing more videos, assigning more independent readings and\nusing more scenarios of realistic policing situations. Instructors could then draw upon a\nmorevaried andinterestingset oftools thanPowerPoint slides.\nThe Academy is in the process of developing a more robust scenario-based\ninstruction platform. The instructors dedicated to this effort are among the best the\nmonitor team has seen in the Academy. The scenario sessions the team observed were\nvery effective. The Academy should, however, more closely integrate these scenarios\ninto the broader instructional goals of the curriculum. For example, the staff developing\nthe courses should work with the scenario team to develop the scenarios; and the scenario\nteam should provide feedback and be involved in the development of the courses. Most\nof the lesson plans for the role-play scenarios the monitor team has seen do not include\ninstructor notes and other material that would make the instructional goals clear and\nfacilitate quality control in the implementation of scenarios when they are passed on to\notherinstructors.\n22\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 37 of 94\nIV.Training\nA.PoliceAcademy\n3. Courseand TeacherEvaluation\nThe monitor team’s observations also suggest that the Police Academy should\ndevelop a more comprehensive plan for evaluating both the quality of instructors and the\ncontent of the curriculum. Such a plan could include: (1) Academyevaluators observing\nclasses more closely; (2) asking recruits for their evaluations immediatelyafter the end of\nthesubject area—for example,whenthe class completes “Policing Legally” (seebelow at\npages 23-25), recruit officers could complete an evaluation of the sessions on this topic;\nand (3) evaluating certain training, for example in-service training, bysurveying officers’\nknowledge and attitudes both before and after the training to see whether the training\naccomplishedits goals, and,ifnot,what couldbe improved.\nOne specific recommendation regarding the content of the Policing Legally\nsessions is to provide recruits with more instruction on how to prepare a stop report form\nand activity log. Greater emphasis should be put on developing, articulating and writing\nreasonable suspicion for stops and frisks. Recruits should be required to prepare stop\nreports based on scenarios theyobserve. More experienced officers and supervisors have\nsaid that they too would benefit from this kind of training once the new stop report is\napproved.\nAs for evaluating instructors, it would be useful if they were evaluated early in an\ninstructor’s assignment. Instructors with poor evaluations could then be identified early\nand given the support they need. This support could include more intensive training or\nmore supervision. Performance by recruits on trimester exam questions relating to\nPolicing Legally, Policing Impartially and Policing in a Multicultural Society could be\n23\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 38 of 94\nIV.Training\nB. RecruitTraining\nused as one wayto obtain feedback concerning how well the instructor communicates the\ncurriculum.\n4. SubjectIntegration\nStreet encounters and trespass enforcement are critical areas of police operations,\nand training would be enhanced if the legal and other principles in those areas were\nintegrated into other relevant areas of instruction (e.g., car stops, use of force, racial bias,\nand search and seizure). This integration should focus on both thetimingof the blocks of\ninstruction and the ways in which the areas of instruction relate to each other.\nUniversities often use “teaching teams” to handle complex multi-disciplinary topics, and\ntheAcademycouldbenefit from asimilarapproach.\nB. RecruitTraining\n1. Stop,Question and Frisk\na. Milestones\nTraining for recruits on stop, question and frisk must provide recruits with the\nstandards for what a stop is, when a stop may be conducted and when a frisk may be\nconducted.\nb. Status and Assessment\nIn April 2015, the court approved training materials—Policing Legally:\nInvestigative Encounters—for the recruit class then at the Academy. The training\nmaterials included a student guide and a PowerPoint presentation. The NYPD also\nprepared an instructor lesson plan, exam questions and role-play scenarios. The course\ncovers Terry stops and the four levels of DeBour encounters; what constitutes a stop;\n24\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 39 of 94\nIV.Training\nB. RecruitTraining\nwhen a stop may be conducted; when a frisk may be conducted; and when a search may\nbeconducted.\nTraining on stops and frisks for the January class of recruits began in May 2015,\nand the monitor team observed training, as did one of the plaintiffs’ experts. Slight\nrevisions were made to the Policing Legally course for the June 2015 and October 2015\nrecruit classes. These revisions were reviewed by the parties and approved by the\nmonitor. The Academy also expanded the use of scenarios for its recruit courses. This\nexpanded scenario-based training uses the mock environments (e.g. subway stations,\nstreetscapes) at the new Academy and provides recruits with additional experiential\ntraining. The NYPD has begun a new field orientation program for recruits. They are\ntaken out of the classroom for approximatelytwo weeks duringtheir six-month Academy\ntraining and placed in precincts, transit districts and housing PSAs to get hands-on\nexperienceand apractical context fortheirclassroom training.\n2. Racial Profiling\na. Milestones\nThe NYPD’s training regarding racial profiling must clearly state the difference\nbetween the constitutionallypermissible use of race in a stop based on a specific, reliable\nsuspect description and the constitutionally impermissible targeting of racially defined\ngroups forstops.\nb. Status and Assessment\nIn April 2015, the court approved training materials for the Academy’s Policing\nImpartially course, including a student guide and PowerPoint presentation. The NYPD\nalso prepared an instructor’s lesson plan, exam questions and scenarios, which were\n25\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 40 of 94\nIV.Training\nB. RecruitTraining\nreviewed by the parties and approved by the monitor. These materials address the\nDepartment’s prohibition against racial profiling and other forms of bias-based policing,\nas well as the impact of unconscious bias on the exercise of discretion. Theyalso include\ninformation on police history and bias, and how knowledge of this history can help\nofficers be more effective. The Academyalso provides recruits with a course on Policing\ninaMulticultural Society.\nBased on experience from the January training class, changes to the training on\nracial profiling were made for the July and October 2015 Academy classes. These\nincluded additional scenarios to make recruits more aware of issues regarding bias and\nhow to avoid it. These changes have been reviewed by the parties and approved by the\nmonitor. The NYPD anticipates additional revisions to its recruit training on racial\nprofiling as it develops in-service training on implicit bias and procedural justice,\ndescribed below in Section IV.C.5. In addition, the NYPD, the plaintiffs and the monitor\nare discussing development of a training scenario to address the NYPD’s revised racial\nprofiling policy (P.G. 203-25) that prohibits the targeting of racially defined groups for\nstops simplybecausetheyappearmorefrequentlyinlocal crimesuspect data.\n3. TAPTraining\na. Milestones\nTraining regarding stops outside TAP buildings must be included in Police\nAcademy recruit training. The training must instruct officers that mere presence near,\nentryinto or exit from a TAP building is not an “objective credible reason” to approach a\nperson torequest information.\n26\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 41 of 94\nIV.Training\nB. RecruitTraining\nb. Status and Assessment\nIn April 2015, the court approved training materials for Academy recruits\nregarding TAP policies (a student guide and PowerPoint presentation). The NYPD also\nprepared instructor lesson plans, exam questions and scenarios that were reviewed by the\nparties and approved bythe monitor. These materials cover stops both outside and inside\nTAP buildings andarenot limitedtoTAP buildings inthe Bronx.\nIn October 2015, the NYPD combined the TAP recruit materials with the training\nmaterials approved by the court in Davis governing housing patrols in and around\nNYCHA buildings. These materials were reviewed by the parties and were approved by\nthemonitor. Theymeet therequirements ofthecourt’s orders.\n4. Davis/NYCHATraining\na. Milestones\nOn April 28, 2015, the court in Davis approved the settlement relating to trespass\nenforcement in NYCHA buildings, including a lesson plan for training recruit officers on\ninterior patrols. The lesson plan included discussions of hypothetical situations in\nNYCHA buildings featuring NYPD officers engaging in both appropriate and\ninappropriate conduct. The court also approved a lesson plan for officers assigned to the\nHousing Bureau dealing with enforcement of the NYCHA house rules. (See Section\nIV.C.4below.)\n27\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 42 of 94\nIV.Training\nC.In-Service\nb. Status and Assessment\nThe NYPD incorporated the court-approved lesson plan on interior patrols into\nAcademy training for its January 2015 recruit class. For the July and October 2015\nrecruit classes, the NYPD combined the chapters on TAP and NYCHA interior patrols so\nthat the lesson plan included court-approved materials from the TAP lesson plan and the\nNYCHA lesson plan. The student guide and the PowerPoint also combined TAP and\nNYCHA materials. Some of the hypothetical examples from the Davis lesson plan were\nrevisedto featureTAP situations. Thesematerials werereviewed bythe parties, finalized\nin November 2015 and approved by the monitor. They meet the requirements of the\nDavis settlement andthe Ligon preliminaryinjunction.\nC. In-ServiceTraining\n1. Command Level Training\na. Milestones\nIn-service training is conducted at several venues, one of which is at the officer’s\ncommand. There, the training sergeant or others can and often do conduct brief training\nsessions. The most common time for command training is at roll call. Roll call is at the\nbeginning of the officer’s shift; it is a time when supervisors give assignments and alert\nofficers torelevant information.\nb. Status and Assessment\nThe NYPD decided to produce short videos regarding P.G. 212-11 for roll call\ntraining to ensure that the training and information provided to NYPD members is\nuniform. The first of these videos has already been produced and played at roll call for\nall officers. In this video, the Chief of the Department, James O’Neill, introduced the\n28\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 43 of 94\nIV.Training\nC.In-Service\nnew policy for investigative encounters and briefly explained its contents. The\nDepartment is producing four additional videos: a video explaining (1) Level 1 Requests\nfor Information; (2) Level 2 Common Law Right of Inquiry; (3) Level 3 Terry stops; and\n(4) documentation requirements and supervisory responsibilities for Level 3 stops. The\nscripts for Chief O’Neill’s introductory video and the three videos for each DeBour level\nwere drafted by the NYPD, reviewed and commented on by plaintiffs, and, after editing,\napproved by the monitor. The Levels 1, 2 and 3 videos are expected to be shown at roll\ncalls starting in February 2016. The script for the video dealing with documentation and\nsupervisory responsibilities will await the approval of the new stop report form (see\nSection III.Eabove).\nThe video for Level 3 stops will also address one of the issues discussed in the\ncourt’s opinions. In 2012, the NYPD produced a video on stop and frisk (SQF Training\nVideo #5) that described what constituted a stop requiring reasonable suspicion. The\nnarratorinthevideostates:\nUsually just verbal commands, such as STOP, POLICE!!!, will\nnot constitute a seizure. However, a verbal command, plus other\nactions may be considered a seizure—other actions, such as:\nusing physical force to subdue a suspect; physically blocking a\nsuspect’s path; grabbing a suspect by the arm, shirt or coat;\npointing a gun at a suspect; using an ASP or baton to contain a\nsuspect; orplacingasuspect against awall orontheground.\nIn the Ligon preliminary injunction opinion, the court ruled that this misstates the\nlaw and that if an officer yelled “STOP, POLICE!!!” and the person stopped, the result\nwould “usually” constitute a Terry stop. “Indeed, it is difficult to imagine many contexts\nin which an officer shouting this command, followed by the person stopping, would not\n29\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 44 of 94\nIV.Training\nC.In-Service\nconstitute a Terry stop.”3 In accordance with this ruling, the Level 3 video that will be\nused forroll call corrects theearliererror. Thescript forthevideosays:\nThe question of whether the circumstances create a situation\nwhere a reasonable person would not feel free to leave typically\ninvolves a consideration of all the facts, such as whether the\nofficer’s gun is drawn and visible, whether the individual was\nprevented from moving, the location of the encounter, how many\nofficers were involved in the encounter, whether verbal\ncommands were given, and the content and tone of the\ncommands. Tone really matters. You may have the impression\nfrom earlier materials that when an officer yells “STOP,\nPOLICE!” and the person stops, that would not usuallyconstitute\na stop. That is not the case. If an officer is approachingsomeone\nfrom behind and says, “Hey, can you hold up for a second?” that\nmay not be a stop, but if an officer yells forcefully “Stop!” and\nthe person stops, a court would likely find that a reasonable\nperson wouldnot feel freetoleave.\nThe Department also issued a training memorandum, reviewed by the parties and\napproved by the monitor, on the NYPD’s revised policy prohibiting racial profiling and\nbias-based policing, P.G. 203-25. The memo summarized the new policy, defined racial\nprofiling and included text from Administrative Code Section 14-451 prohibiting bias-\nbased profiling based on several enumerated categories. This training memo was sent to\nall training personnel on October 30, 2015 and was read in its entirety at roll call\ntrainings duringthemonthofNovember2015.\n2. SQFReferenceMaterials\nWhen the Department issued its revised procedures on stop and frisk in\nSeptember 2015, it also prepared reference materials for an online intranet library\n(Investigative Encounters Resource Center). These materials include a detailed reference\nguide, a PowerPoint presentation, summary charts and an at-a-glance booklet regarding\n3 Ligon,925F.Supp.2dat535.\n30\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 45 of 94\nIV.Training\nC.In-Service\ninvestigative encounters that summarize the new procedures and the applicable legal\nstandards under DeBour and Terry. The library also contains relevant forms (including\nthe stop report form and tear-off receipt used in the pilot described in Section III.E\nabove), legal bulletins and videos. The Department has created a new activity log insert\nsummarizing the four levels of investigative encounters outlined in DeBour, as well as a\npoliceofficer’s authorityandlimitations undereach.\n3. SQFIn-ServiceTrainingattheAcademy\na. Milestones\nTraining for current members of the service is critically important and the most\ntime-consuming of the NYPD’s training tasks. A central part of in-service training is\nwhen officers are assigned to locations outside their precincts (e.g., to the Police\nAcademy) and trained in concentrated blocks of time devoted to particular subjects.\nThirty-six thousand members of the service must go through the training to reinforce the\nproper legal standards and new policies and address any prior misunderstandings that\nmayhave developed. The in-service trainingshould include materials on: stop and frisk;\ntrespass enforcement; proper documentation of stops; the Department’s policy on racial\nprofiling and bias-based policing; and new supervisory responsibilities under P.G. 212-\n11.\nb. Status and Assessment\nThe Department is currently drafting a curriculum for a Department-wide in-\nservice training on stop and frisk, and invited the plaintiffs and their experts to review\nand comment on an early draft. The one-day program will include a classroom session\non the law and policy, as well as scenario-based exercises for members of the service.\n31\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 46 of 94\nIV.Training\nC.In-Service\nThe scenarios will include examples of self-initiated stops and radio runs. The current\nplan is for supervisors to be trained in the same sessions as patrol officers, and there will\nbe materials addressing their role in supervising and reviewing stops. The monitor will\nassess the NYPD’s in-service training after the training is approved by the court and the\nmonitor team has observed the training sessions. These training materials, once\napproved,will likelyincludechanges that shouldbeincorporatedintotherecruit training.\n4. Davis/NYCHAIn-ServiceTraining\na. Milestones\nThecourt-approvedsettlement in Davis includes amoduleonNYCHAhouse\nrules forofficers patrollingpublichousing.\nb. Status and Assessment\nThe NYPD plans to conduct a separate day of in-service training for the Housing\nBureau and other members of the service who patrol NYCHA buildings. That training\nwill include a module on NYCHA house rules approved by the Davis court, as well as\nothertrainingrelatedtopublichousing.\n5. ImplicitBias and Procedural Justice\na. Milestones\nIn its remedial order, the court noted that it might be appropriate to conduct\ntraining for officers on the effect of unconscious racial bias. The NYPD has recognized\nthe importance of teaching officers about the concept of implicit bias and the related\nconcept ofprocedural justice.\nb. Status and Assessment\nThe NYPD is committed to including training on implicit bias and procedural\njustice as part of its in-service training. It currently plans to add at least one dayto its in-\n32\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 47 of 94\nIV.Training\nC.In-Service\nservice training curriculum for these topics. The Department has retained Professor\nTraceyMeares and Professor Phillip Atiba Goff to serve as consultants as it develops this\ntraining. Professors Meares and Goff have expertise in policingand in providingtraining\non implicit bias and procedural justice. The Department expects these new training\nmaterials to be created in the next several months. The NYPD plans to incorporate\nimplicit bias and procedural justice concepts into its training in many areas of\nenforcement beyond stop and frisk, such as issuing summonses, dealing with victims and\nmaking arrests. The monitor will assess the Department’s efforts on these topics after\nnew training materials are developed and incorporated into the curriculum and the\nmonitorteam has observedthetraining.\n33\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 48 of 94\nIV.Training\nD.TrainingonSupervision\nD. TrainingonSupervision\n1. Milestones\nUnder the new NYPD stop and frisk procedures, supervisors will be responsible\nfor reviewing the legality of stops. Current and newly promoted supervisors and field\ntrainingofficers must betrained on these new responsibilities and on their responsibilities\nfor reviewing trespass arrests. In addition, the leadership training for NYPD executives\nmust be revised to incorporate training on the responsibilities of supervisors relating to\nthecourt orders andtheparties’agreements.\n2. Status and Assessment\nThe NYPD plans to train supervisors in several ways on their new responsibilities\nunder revised P.G. 212-11. Initially, they will view roll call videos, including a video on\ndocumentation requirements and supervision responsibilities. Theywill then receive stop\nand frisk trainingduring the upcoming Department-wide in-service training. Trainingfor\nsupervisors will deal with their new duties and responsibilities under the revised\nprocedures. The monitor will assess compliance for this area after the in-service training\nis conducted. With respect to housing patrols, supervisory responsibilities regarding\nstops will be part of the stop and frisk in-service training. Beyond this training, the\nparties will be discussing any additional training that may be necessary relating to\ntrespass enforcement.\nNewly promoted supervisors also need training in their promotional classes.\nSince the publication of the NYPD’s new stop and frisk procedures, P.G. 212-11, the\nDepartment has promoted new classes of sergeants, lieutenants and captains. The first\npromotions were of captains in October 2015. Although the NYPD had prepared an\n34\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 49 of 94\nIV.Training\nD.TrainingonSupervision\n“SQF refresher” module, the materials dealt with supervisory responsibilities only in a\ncursory way. There was not enough time before the class began for rewriting the\nmaterials to address the supervisory responsibilities more completely. Therefore, the\nmodulewas not usedfor this class ofnewcaptains.\nNew sergeants and lieutenants also were promoted, and materials regarding the\nnew stop and frisk policies and supervisory responsibilities were included in classes for\nthe new sergeants and lieutenants in November and December. The monitor team\nobserved the sergeants’ and lieutenants’ training. Although some aspects of that training\nwere useful, the materials were not sufficient. Among other things, the training needs to\ninclude a fuller discussion of what leadership means in the NYPD and of the changes to\nNYPD policies and practices, why they are being made and why they are important for\ntheNYPD.\nThe Department has agreed that further work needs to be done on promotional\ntraining and additional materials will be prepared based on the in-service training that is\nnowbeingdeveloped.\nThe Field Training Officer (FTO) Field Guide was revised in June 2015 with\nrespect to stops and frisks and trespass stops outside TAP buildings. The Department\nprepared a new section of the FTO Field Guide entitled “Investigative Encounters” and a\nrefresher training module for FTOs, which includes a legal review of the prohibition\nagainst racial profiling and the policies that govern housing interior patrols. These\nmaterials were reviewed bythe parties and approved bythe monitor. In June 2015, FTOs\n35\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 50 of 94\nV.Supervision\nhad one day of in-service training at which they were provided presentations on several\ntopics, including the new stop and frisk training that the new recruits had received at the\nAcademy. Asecond FTOin-servicetrainingsessionwas conductedinOctober2015.\nIn addition, in September 2015, the Academy delivered stop and frisk training to\nthe training sergeants who serve in the Department’s many commands. This training\nmodule provided training sergeants with an overview of the new Patrol Guide procedures\nregarding investigative encounters and racial profiling, the law of investigative\nencounters and the contents of the NYPD’s new online Investigative Encounters\nResource Center. The training sergeants will be responsible for retraining officers who\nhave been identified by supervisors as needing retraining. Going forward, the monitor\nwill beexamininghowwell this retrainingis beingimplemented.\nV. Supervision\nIf the changes required by the court orders and the parties’ agreements are to be\nimplemented and take hold, the supervisors who have most to do with the officers on the\nstreet must play an increased leadership role. This includes, especially, sergeants, who\nare closest to the officers, and precinct and unit commanders, who set the tone. These\nsupervisors must ensure that their subordinates are implementing the changes required by\nthe court orders and the parties’ agreements—that the stops, frisks and trespass arrests\nmade by their officers are legal and proper and that these activities are properly\ndocumented. Supervisors must take a more active role in supervision, oversight, teaching\nand,whenappropriate,discipline.\nOn the question of discipline, although most officers understand that discipline is\nappropriate for deliberate violations of law or policy, they often express fear that they\nwill face serious disciplinary action or not be indemnified in lawsuits over minor or\n36\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 51 of 94\nV.Supervision\ninadvertent mistakes in documentation or for isolated cases of erroneous but good-faith\nstops or frisks. The newly approved P.G. 212-11 announces a contrary policy for the\nPolice Department. And, as far as can be determined, officers have not been denied\nindemnification for minor infractions or reasonable, honest mistakes. Sergeants and\nother supervisors need to take an active role in trying to correct these misperceptions,\nespecially as they may affect decisions by some officers to make or refrain from making\nappropriatestops.\nThese observations about the supervision necessary to implement the changes\nrequired by court orders and agreements do not conflict with the goals and needs of the\nDepartment. Theyare, infact,similartomanycomments that Commissioner Brattonand\nothers at the NYPD have made about the need more generally to increase supervisory\nresponsibility for sergeants and other supervisors and to push decision-making down the\ncommandstructure.\nA. Milestones\nThe court orders and the parties’ agreements require that supervisory review of\nstop report forms and activity logs include a review not just of the completeness and\naccuracy of the forms, but of the constitutionality of the stop and, if conducted, the frisk\nand search. If an officer’s actions are improper, the officer’s supervisor must take\ncorrective action. The Ligon remedy also requires the NYPD to develop procedures for\nsupervisors to ensure that a stop report form is prepared for every trespass stop outside a\nTAP building in the Bronx. The Davis settlement provides that any additional reforms\nregarding supervision of officers engaged in trespass enforcement in or around NYCHA\nresidences will beaddressedbythemonitorinconsultationwiththeparties.\n37\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 52 of 94\nV.Supervision\nB. Status and Assessment\nThe new NYPD Patrol Guide procedures governing stops and frisks, P.G. 212-11,\nrequires supervisors to respond to the scene of stops when feasible, discuss the\ncircumstances of the stop with the officer making the stop before the end of the officer’s\ntour, and review the officer’s stop report form and activity log. The supervisor must\ndetermine whether the stop was based on reasonable suspicion of a felony or Penal Law\nmisdemeanor; if a frisk was conducted, whether the frisk was supported by reasonable\nsuspicion that the person was armed and dangerous; if a search was conducted, whether it\nwas reasonable; and if force was used, whether the use of force was reasonable. The\nsupervisor must direct the officer to make corrections to the stop report form if it is\ninaccurate or incomplete, and, if appropriate, instruct the officer or refer the officer for\nadditional trainingorotherremedial action,including,ifappropriate,disciplinaryaction.\nThe NYPD has stated that the review and discussion with the officer who made\nthe stop is intended to be an occasion for teaching, rather than an attempt to catch an\nofficer in a minor mistake of the law or policy. As noted in P.G. 212-11, instruction and\ntraining to correct isolated mistakes will generally take place in the officer’s command.\nHowever, officers who show a consistent lack of understanding of the law in this area\nshould be referred to the Legal Bureau for retraining. The new stop report form will\nrequire supervisors to document their review and whether they took or directed any\nfollow-upaction,ifappropriate.\n38\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 53 of 94\nVI. Body-Worn Cameras\nThe NYPD’s new written policies meet the requirements of the court orders and\nthe parties’ agreements. However, the limited review of supervisoryactions based on the\napproximately600 stop report forms completed duringthe pilot program described above\nin Section III.E suggests that more needs to be done before supervisors understand and\nexercise their new responsibilities. In future reports, the monitor will assess compliance\nby looking at whether the supervisory policies relating to stop and frisk and trespass\nenforcement are being effectively implemented in practice. The monitor team will do so\nby, for example, reviewing the Department’s own auditing and self-inspections on these\nsubjects and by undertaking an independent review of a sample of stop report forms and\notherdocumentation.\nVI. Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs)\nBeginning in December 2014, the NYPD instituted a small voluntary pilot\nprogram in which 54 officers volunteered to wear body-worn cameras (BWCs). The\npurpose was not to replace or circumvent the larger pilot program that had been ordered\nby the court. The purpose was primarily to learn about the technological challenges that\nmight be faced in what the Department announced as its ultimate goal—to equip most of\nthe members of the service with BWCs. The issues raised by equipping much of the\npolice force with cameras include, but also go beyond, what the court stated as the\nprimaryfocus of the pilot program it ordered—reducingunconstitutional stops and frisks.\nNonetheless, the monitor team, the NYPD and the other parties recognized that it made\nsense for the court-ordered pilot to be designed so that the Department and the public\ncould learn about other issues that would accompany a wider deployment of cameras.\nThat is one reason the monitor recommended, and the court ordered, with the consent of\ntheparties, that thepilot berestructuredso that a controlledexperiment couldbedone.\n39\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 54 of 94\nVI. Body-Worn Cameras\nHowever, using the court-ordered pilot to educate the Department and the public\nabout issues that go beyond the subject matter of the court’s order raises additional\nchallenges for both the monitor and the parties. Before a BWC program can be\nimplemented, policies and procedures must be in place. Some of these will be within the\nmonitor’s area of responsibility and some will not, which means that on some issues, the\nmonitor will have a deciding voice, and on others, more deference will be given to the\nDepartment’s preferences. There certainly may be grey areas where it is not clear\nwhether a policy is covered by the court order. Those will be discussed and resolved as\ntheyariseafterdiscussionwiththeparties.\nA. Milestones\nThe court orders and the parties’ agreements require the NYPD to conduct a one-\nyear pilot program for body-worn cameras. The purpose of the pilot is to assess whether\nthe benefits of the cameras relating to stop and frisk and trespass enforcement outweigh\ntheir financial, administrative and other costs, and whether the program should be\nexpanded or terminated. The monitor will work with the parties to evaluate the pilot.\nThe court ordered that the monitor establish procedures for reviewing stop recordings by\nsupervisors and senior managers, preserving stop recordings and measuring the\neffectiveness of BWCs in reducing unconstitutional stops and frisks. The court required\nthat BWCs must be worn for a one-year period by officers on patrol in one precinct per\nborough—specifically, the precinct with the highest number of stops in that borough\nduring 2012. These NYPD commands were identified as the 23rd, 40th, 75th, 103rd and\n120thPrecincts.\n40\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 55 of 94\nVI. Body-Worn Cameras\nB. Status and Assessment\nAs noted in the monitor’s first report, requiring officers in these five precincts to\nwear the cameras might not provide the best information regarding the benefits and costs\nof body-worn cameras, including whether they will be effective in reducing\nunconstitutional stops and frisks. The precincts with the highest counts of stop reports in\n2012 were no longer the ones with the highest number of reported stops in 2014 or in\n2015. In 2012, the 75th Precinct had the greatest number of reported stops in the city; in\n2014, the 75th Precinct was down to sixteenth place (and in 2015, it appears likely to be\naround twentieth). Also, the selection of precincts in advance prevents the use of a\nrigorous randomized experimental design, because it precludes a random selection of\ncommands matchingthosethat hadcameras withthosethat didnot.\nThe monitor team examined and discussed with the parties how to design a pilot\nthat will yield more robust and useful information. The monitor recommended to the\ncourt that a randomized experimental design should be implemented. Such a design\nallows researchers to assume that the only systematic difference between the “control”\ngroup (here, those without cameras) and the “treatment group” (those with cameras) is\nthe presence of the intervention (i.e., use of cameras). This approach permits a clearer\nassessment of causes and effects. The monitor is currently considering that the NYPD\nuse a variant of the classic randomized controlled trial called “cluster” randomization. In\nthese trials, clusters (groups) of subjects, rather than individual subjects, are randomly\nallocated to treatment and control conditions. In a cluster-randomized controlled trial,\nNYPD officers would be randomly allocated by precinct to the body-worn camera\ntreatment groupornon-body-worncamera comparison group.\n41\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 56 of 94\nVI. Body-Worn Cameras\nIn December 2015, the court ordered, with the consent of the parties, that the\nNYPD use a randomized experimental design for the one-year pilot program. It is\nanticipated that roughly 1,000 officers will be equipped with body-worn cameras. The\nuse of a randomized experimental design for the body-worn camera pilot will ensure that\nthe pilot will provide the parties, the monitor, the court, and the public with better\ninformation to evaluate the effectiveness of body-worn cameras in reducing\nunconstitutional stops and frisks and to assess the costs and benefits of the body-worn\ncameras.\nThe City’s procurement process to acquire BWCs is underway. More than 50\nproposals were submitted to the NYPD by September 3, 2015. The NYPD created a\ncommittee to review these proposals. The procurement committee is in the process of\nreviewing and evaluating technical proposals and on-site demonstrations from potential\nvendors. Vendors achieving a satisfactory evaluation will be invited to submit a pricing\nproposal.\nIn November 2015, the NYPD informed the monitor that the Department’s plans\nfor the research and development of the BWC pilot have changed since the start of this\nmonitorship in 2014. These plans now include outreach to other police departments that\nuse BWCs, review of BWC policies from other jurisdictions and model policies,\nconsideration of other ongoing Department pilots and operational and technical\nconstraints, andoutreach toobtaininput from communityandotherinterestedgroups.\nThe NYPD created an internal BWC working group, which has plans to: revise\nand expand its body-worn camera policy with input from internal and external\nstakeholders, includingcommunitymembers; developtrainingmaterials forthepersonnel\n42\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 57 of 94\nVI. Body-Worn Cameras\nwho will use and maintain the cameras and handle video footage; and assist in devising\nimplementation and audit plans. In November and December 2015, members of the\ninternal BWC working group made calls to other police departments that have\nimplemented body-worn camera programs. In December, members of the working group\nvisited three departments (Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Oakland) that have implemented\nBWC programs tolearn about theirprograms.\nIn January 2016, the NYPD shared a draft outline of BWC policies with internal\nstakeholders, plaintiffs’ counsel and the monitor. The draft outline does not necessarily\nstate the Department’s position on what the final policies should be, but is intended to\nbegin discussions with the monitor and the plaintiffs and with external stakeholders. The\ndraft outline covers issues such as when the cameras should be recording, data retention,\naccessing and reviewing footage, privacy concerns and the use of footage as evidence,\namongother things. The Department plans to engage in outreach to external stakeholders\nto get feedback and input on the draft outline. This outreach will include: officers of\neveryrank; unions; communitymembers andorganizations; criminal justicestakeholders,\nincluding the courts, district attorneys and defenders’ organizations; victims’ advocacy\ngroups; privacy groups; the City Council; external oversight agencies; and other\ninterested parties and organizations. The NYPD expects to develop a final BWC policy\ninMarch2016.\nTheDepartment will also needtodraft thenecessarytrainingmaterials totrainthe\nofficers who will wear the cameras and the personnel who will maintain the cameras and\nthe footage; deliver the required trainings; complete the pilot design; devise\n43\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 58 of 94\nVI. Body-Worn Cameras\nimplementation plans; and devise auditing procedures to track compliance with BWC\npolicies.\nIn the current reporting period, the monitor team continued to test the feasibility\nof designing and implementing a rigorous cluster-randomized controlled trial. With the\nassistance of the NYPD, the monitor team collected data on policing, crime and\nneighborhood conditions in the 77 NYPD precincts and on officers assigned to work in\nthose precincts. The monitor team’s preliminary analyses indicate that matching\nprecincts into pairs and randomizing precincts within each pair yields balanced treatment\nof control clusters (precincts) and units of analysis (officers). To ensure that the best\nprecinct matches are made for inclusion in the BWC randomized experiment, one\nmember of the monitor team, Professor Anthony Braga, toured all 77 precincts with\nmembers of the NYPD Risk Management Bureau to examine relevant community\ndynamics within and across the precincts. Professor Braga noted important qualitative\nvariations such as the rapid gentrification of certain neighborhoods, the presence of street\ncrews and gangs, and variations in the physical environment. These and other factors\nwill beconsideredbefore theappropriaterandomizationstrategyis chosen.\n44\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 59 of 94\nVII.Auditing\nA.QualityAssuranceDivision\nVII. Auditing\nA. QualityAssuranceDivision\n1. Milestones\nAs part of the remedial measures, the NYPD must maintain an effective auditing\nsystem for ensuring the constitutionality of stops and frisks and trespass arrests. The\nNYPD’s Quality Assurance Division (QAD) is responsible for evaluating compliance\nwith the Department’s policies and procedures, including those relating to stop and frisk\nand trespass enforcement. QAD evaluates each precinct, transit district and housing PSA\ncommands, as well as borough task forces, the Detective Bureau, the Organized Crime\nControl Bureau, the School Safety Division and the Traffic Enforcement Division. The\naudit procedures must assess both compliance with constitutional standards and whether\nthe paperwork has been properly prepared. The Department must also perform audits to\nassess theextent towhichstops andfrisks arebeingconductedbut not documented.\n2. Status and Assessment\nThe NYPD recognizes that its auditing practices need to be revised to meet the\nrequirements of the court orders and the parties’ agreements, and it has begun the process\nof doing so as part of the Department’s efforts to improve auditing more generally. A\nCPA with extensive auditing experience who previously worked at a major accounting\nfirm now directs QAD. QAD is developing new audits to evaluate compliance with the\nnew Patrol Guide sections on investigative encounters (P.G. 212-11) and the new stop\nreport form,uponits approval.\nThemonitorrequested that QADdraft an audit planforstopandfrisk andtrespass\nenforcement that would state the audits that QAD plans to conduct in 2016, the audit\n45\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 60 of 94\nVII.Auditing\nA.QualityAssuranceDivision\nprocedures and methodology to be used for each audit, including the number of samples\nto be tested and the sampling methodology for the audits, and the frequency of the audit\nand the audit period to be tested. The monitor recently received a draft audit plan. The\nNYPD has been discussing possible audit protocols with members of the monitor team\nand will be discussing the draft audit plan with the monitor and the plaintiffs in the near\nfuture. Describedbelow aresomeoftherecent audits that QADhas conducted.\na. CurrentAudits of StopReports and ActivityLogs\nThe NYPD has reported that QAD audited more than 6,000 stop report forms and\nassociated activity logs from January 1, 2015, to September 30, 2015, but that these\nreviews used the prior approach, which did not focus on the constitutionalityof the stops,\nfrisks and searches. However, the Department states that in November 2015, QAD\nrevised its SQF audits to evaluate the officer’s description of an encounter to assess\nwhether the description stated a lawful basis for the stop, and for the frisk and search, if\nthese were conducted. The revised audit methodology, as described by the NYPD, also\nassesses whether supervisors effectively performed their responsibilities in reviewing the\nbasis for stops and frisks, or whether theyinstead signed and approved forms that did not\narticulatereasonablesuspicionorthat weremissinginformation.\nThe NYPD has reported some of its findings and recently provided these audit\nreports, which the monitor team has not yet had the opportunity to review. The NYPD\nstates that from November 5, 2015 (when the revised SQF audits began), to December\n10, 2015, QAD evaluated 859 activity log entries made in 62 commands for compliance\nwith the new Patrol Guide procedure. QAD determined that officers articulated\nindividualizedreasonablesuspicion forthe stopin 81 percent of those activitylogentries.\n46\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 61 of 94\nVII.Auditing\nA.QualityAssuranceDivision\nQAD found that officers articulated the basis for the frisk in 64 percent of the activity\nlogs documenting a frisk and the basis for the search in 71 percent of the activity logs\ndocumentingasearch.\nThese results reported by the NYPD should not be taken as conclusions about the\nDepartment’s compliance with the mandates of the court orders and the parties’\nagreements, because the audits were not done on the stop report form that is now being\ndevelopedforapproval. That form will includemoreinformative checkboxes andspaces\nfor narrative descriptions. And the audits were done before the Department provided\nsignificant training for the members of the service. However, the audits, together with\nother information reported elsewhere in this report (see subsections below), suggest that\nthe Department faces substantial challenges in educating its officers and supervisors on\nthe requirements of its new policies, including the requirements of documentation and\nsupervisoryreviewofstops.\nb. Auditof Revised StopReports Used in aPilot Program\nRevised stop report forms were used in a pilot program in seven commands, as\ndescribed in Section III.E above. QAD audited the forms from the pilot and found that\n28percent ofthestopreport forms didnot properlyarticulatereasonablesuspicionforthe\nstop, 27 percent of the forms documenting frisks did not properly articulate reasonable\nsuspicion for the frisk, and 16 percent of the forms documenting searches did not state an\nappropriate basis for the search. Even though QAD found these deficiencies, it also\nfound that in almost all cases supervisors did not note the deficiencies on the stop report\nform, and did not direct changes in the stop report or require any other corrective action.\nThe NYPD acknowledges a need for improvement in this area; it says it expects\n47\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 62 of 94\nVII.Auditing\nA.QualityAssuranceDivision\ncompliance to improve once officers and supervisors have more trainingon the procedure\nandthelaw.\nc. RANDAudits\nIn the monitor’s first report, the question of under-reported stops was highlighted.\nThese are situations in which stops were made but no corresponding stop report was\nfiled. There are several reasons why a stop might have occurred without the appropriate\ndocumentation. The officer might not have understood when the report was required; or\nperhaps, more seriously, the officer did know the report was required but deliberately\ndecidednot tofileone.\nOne way the Department attempts to measure under-reporting is through what it\ncalls a “RAND audit.” This is an audit methodology recommended to the Department in\n2007 in a report done bythe RAND Corporation at the request of the NYPD. In a RAND\naudit, the Department looks at radio transmissions. QAD uses keyword searches of the\nNYPD’s dispatch system (ICAD) to identify events that likelyinvolved a stop encounter.\nThese keywords include “stopped,” “show-up,” “holding” and “warrant check.” Once an\nevent that looks like it might have been a stop is identified through reviewing dispatch\ntranscripts and/or listening to the corresponding radio transmissions, QAD looks through\nNYPD records to determine if a corresponding stop report was prepared. QAD then\nforwards the audit to the command for investigation and follow-up. The commanding\nofficer determines if the encounters identified by QAD were in fact Terry stops, for\nwhich a stop report was required to be completed, or instead are “false positives.” A\n“false positive” might occur, for example, when the radio transmission used the word\n“stopped” but was describing a stop of an automobile based on probable cause that a\n48\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 63 of 94\nVII.Auditing\nA.QualityAssuranceDivision\ntraffic infractionwas committed. If, however,it is determinedthat astop was made and a\nstop report was required but not filed, the officer is directed to prepare a report\nretrospectively. The command may also take corrective action, such as providing the\nofficer with instructions regarding stop and frisk documentation requirements, directing\nadditional training for the individual or, if appropriate, the command or recommending\ndisciplinary action. QAD now performs RAND audits in seven commands every month,\nan increase since June 2015 (when five commands were audited each month) and since\n2014(whentwocommands were auditedeachquarter).\nIn the first half of 2015, QAD conducted RAND audits in 36 commands and\nidentified 53 instances in which it appeared a stop might have been made and a stop\nreport should have been prepared. The audits were forwarded to the commands for\ninvestigation. In 27 of the 53 cases, the precinct determined that a stop report was not\nrequired, either because the officer had probable cause to arrest at the beginning of the\nstreet encounter, it was a car stop with probable cause, or it was not a stop at all. In\nanother eight cases, the stop report was either prepared and on file, or prepared by the\nofficer and not entered into the NYPD database. In one case, the command has not\nsubmitted a response. In 17 other cases, the precinct investigations concluded that a\nTerry stop occurred but was not documented. In 11 of the 17 cases, the officers were\ngiven instructions on stop and frisk documentation requirements. In five cases, an entry\nwas made in the log at the precinct in which minor infractions are recorded; these minor\nviolations do not go into the officer’s personnel file. In one case, an officer was\ndisciplined and as a penalty lost four hours of compensation time, which can be used as\nvacationtimeoras pay.\n49\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 64 of 94\nVII.Auditing\nA.QualityAssuranceDivision\nIn the second half of 2015 (through November 2015), QAD conducted RAND\naudits in 35 commands. QAD identified 69 encounters in which it appeared a stop report\nshould have been completed but was not, and forwarded that information to the\ncommands for investigation. According to the NYPD, those investigations determined\nthat 41 of the 68 encounters required a stop report, but that a report had not been\ncompleted. For the 41 stops without a stop report, the commands had the officers\ninvolved complete a stop report retrospectively. QAD is awaiting responses from several\ncommands regarding the remaining encounters. The monitor does not yet have\ninformationoncorrective actions takenwithrespect totheseencounters.\nd. Audits ofEnforcement Activities Initiated byOfficers\nAnother audit that QAD uses to identify stops that are missing the required stop\nreport form is its “police-initiated enforcement audit.” This is an audit of arrests when\nthere is no radio run or individual complainant, but the officer makes an arrest based on\nhis or her observations and investigation—for example, an arrest for criminal possession\nof a controlled substance or criminal possession of a weapon when the officer sees the\ncontrolled substance or weapon. QAD audits up to 25 arrests that result from “police-\ninitiated enforcement” in each command quarterly. When it is determined that a stop led\nto the arrest, QAD reviews arrest documents and court affidavits to determine whether\nthe officer prepared a stop report. For arrests made in the second quarter of 2015, QAD\nfound 310 that resulted from a Terry stop, but only 18 stop reports were prepared, a 5.8\npercent compliance rate. In a more recent police-initiated enforcement audit, QAD\naudited approximately 1,400 arrests made between November 5, 2015 and December 10,\n50\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 65 of 94\nVII.Auditing\nA.QualityAssuranceDivision\n2015, and identified 50 arrests that resulted from a Terry stop. However, only six stop\nreports werepreparedfor the50arrests (a12percent compliancerate).\nOne possible reason for these low compliance rates may be that some officers\nbelieve it is not necessary to prepare a stop report if an arrest is made, since other forms\nrelated to the arrest are prepared. If that is the reason, this belief does not comport with\nNYPDpolicy.\nAnother source of information about undocumented stops is the CCRB. In its\n2015 Semiannual Report, the CCRB noted that 16percent of all stop and frisk complaints\nfor which a full investigation was completed in the first half of 2015 were referred to the\nDepartment for failure to fill out the required stop report form. The CCRB referred 18\npercent of thestop and frisk complaints investigatedin2014 tothe Department for failure\ntocompleteastopreport.\nThe monitor will be conferring with the NYPD and the other parties to determine\nwhether there are reliable methods using these and perhaps other sources of information\nto estimate more systematicallythe total number of stops made, including those that were\nnot documented.\ne. Audits ofSelf-Inspections byIntegrityControl Officers\nQAD has added another audit relevant to the remedial efforts. Each precinct has\nan Integrity Control Officer (ICO) whose responsibilities include performing “self-\ninspections,” which are reviews of precinct activities to identifyviolations of Department\nprocedures. One of those self-inspections is a review of stop reports. The court noted\nthat the ICO’s review of stops as part of the precincts’ self-inspections was insufficient\n51\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 66 of 94\nVII.Auditing\nA.QualityAssuranceDivision\nbecause it involved only a cursory review of the paperwork and not a substantive review\nofthereasons forthestopandfrisk.\nIn July 2015, at the recommendation of the monitor, QAD began reviewing the\nprecincts’ self-inspections. In its review, QAD determines whether the monthly self-\ninspections are on file, whether they have been prepared and approved bythe appropriate\nsupervisor (Commanding Officer, Executive Officer or ICO), and whether the findings of\nthe self-inspection for the stop reports and arrests are consistent with QAD’s findings.\nThemonitorhas not yet receivedtheresults oftheseaudits.\nThe NYPD will also be forming an Audit Advisory Committee consisting of five\nauditing professionals with expertise in internal audits, external audits, forensic\ninvestigations, risk management and compliance. The NYPD has stated that the Audit\nAdvisory Committee will perform an initial assessment of the Department’s existing\n52\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 67 of 94\nVII.Auditing\nB.BronxTAP\nauditing procedures, identify areas for improvement and make recommendations in those\nareas. Once constituted, the committee will advise on all future audit procedures and\naudit plans beforetheyareimplementedbyQAD.\nIn sum, the monitor will be evaluating NYPD’s 2016 audit plan, following up on\nopen questions and information requested about audits already being done, and\nmonitoringtheresults of newaudits oncetheyare instituted.\nB. BronxTAP\n1. Milestones\nUnder the remedial orders in Ligon, the NYPD must develop procedures for\nensuring that stop report forms are completed for every trespass stop outside a TAP\nbuilding in the Bronx and that the constitutionality of those encounters is reviewed. Stop\nreport forms for criminal trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx must be\nprovidedto Ligon counsel.\n2. Status and Assessment\nThe NYPD is examining ways to assess whether trespass stops and arrests in TAP\nbuildings (and also in NYCHA buildings) were properly conducted and recorded. First,\nthe NYPD is developing an audit program for trespass stops and arrests. Second, the\nDepartment is considering precinct self-inspections, in which ICOs review the stop\nreports and activitylogentries oftrespass stops andalso examinethesergeants’reviewof\nthosereports.\nCurrently, the Department is using self-inspections to monitor criminal trespass\nstops at TAP locations in the Bronx. Since March 2015, the ICO in each Bronx precinct\nreviews the trespass stops at TAP locations in that precinct (both inside and outside the\n53\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 68 of 94\nVII.Auditing\nB.BronxTAP\nTAP building) and prepares a spreadsheet with the date of the stop, the stop report serial\nnumber, the tax ID of the reporting officer, the date the ICO conferred with the reporting\nofficer (if applicable), the date the ICO conferred with the officer’s supervisor (if\napplicable), the findings for the stop and any corrective action taken. These assessment\nreports, along with the stop reports and activitylogs, are sent to the Office of the Chief of\nPatrol,whichcollects andcombines them intoamonthlysurveyreport.\nThe monitor and Ligon plaintiffs’ counsel were provided these survey reports for\nthe months of March through September 2015. Based on these reports, there were only\n29 stop report forms prepared for criminal trespass stops either inside or outside TAP\nbuildings in the Bronx for these seven months. There were no trespass stops reported at\nTAP buildings in the Bronx in July, August or September 2015. After reviewing these\ntrespass stops, the precinct ICO instructed the officers on how to improve their actions\nfor 11 of the 29 stops and gave verbal warnings to the officers for two stops. These\ncorrective actions were usually in response to an incomplete stop report form or because\nthe officer’s activity log was insufficient. The monitor team reviewed these 29 stop\nreports and activity logs and found that many of them did not articulate reasonable\nsuspicion for the stop; likewise, when there was a frisk, many of the reports did not\narticulate reasonable suspicion that the person frisked was armed and dangerous. These\nreports highlight the need for additional trainingand supervision relatingto these types of\nstops and the need for clear descriptions of the basis for the stops and frisks. To address\nthese issues, the NYPD has drafted, and the Ligon plaintiffs and the monitor have\n54\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 69 of 94\nVII.Auditing\nC.EarlyIdentificationSystem\nreviewed, an operations order that would establish a system for monitoring and assessing\nstops for criminal trespass at TAP buildings in the Bronx. The monitor will submit the\noperations orderfor court approval.\nC. EarlyIdentificationSystem(EIS)\n1. Milestones\nAs part of its remedial efforts, the NYPD has committed itself to upgrading its\ncurrent performance monitoring system and implementing an effective Early\nIdentification System to foster the goals of the Department and the remedial reforms. An\nEIS is a centralized database to collect and analyze information relating to behavior that\nmight put the Department or its officers at risk. Many major police departments use an\nEIS to support the supervisionandmanagement of theirofficers, supervisors andunits. It\nis used to identify at-risk employees and patterns of at-risk behaviors so that they can be\naddressed andcorrected beforemoreserious misconduct occurs.\n2. Status and Assessment\nThe Performance Analysis Section (PAS) of the Risk Management Bureau\ncurrently tracks the performance of officers using several databases and behavioral\nindicators to identify officers and supervisors who display at-risk behavior. To identify\nmembers of the service who need to be placed in a monitoring program, the PAS tracks\ndisciplinaryactions, substandard evaluations, civil lawsuits, complaints to the CCRB, use\nofforcecomplaints, supervisorrecommendations andothernegativepersonnel actions.\nThe Department is currentlycreatinga program that it hopes will improve the EIS\nprocess and make it more useful. The system in development will use more databases\nand sources of information to populate an alert system. In 2013, the Enterprise Liability\n55\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 70 of 94\nVII.Auditing\nC.EarlyIdentificationSystem\nAssessment Unit, now part of the Risk Management Bureau, proposed the development\nof the Risk Assessment Information Liability System (RAILS). RAILS was originally\ndesigned to analyze lawsuits and claims against the City and to identify patterns and\ntrends of liability or risky behavior. The project was approved in January 2014. The\nNYPD has now expanded the original scope of RAILS so that it will use other data in\naddition to lawsuits and claims, and will be used to analyze the performance of officers\nand Department-wide risks. This new “scope of work” was approved in August 2015.\nTheNYPDexpects that workontheexpansionof RAILS will beginbyFebruary2016.\nThe Department has created a working group to discuss how the Department will\nuse the newly expanded RAILS program and identify all of the databases that should be\nincluded. So far, the Department plans to includeinformation on officer complaints, civil\nlawsuits, use of force, discipline, sick leave and overtime, traffic accidents, investigations\nby the IAB and criminal proceedings against officers. The NYPD has stated that it also\nplans to incorporate positive information on officers, including promotions,\ncommendations and letters of reference. In addition to containing information from\nCCRB complaints involving stops, an EIS system could track instances in which\nsupervisors tookcorrectiveactionaftertheirreviewofstops.\nIf developed as planned, RAILS could be an important tool in supervision and\nmanagement. EIS systems often use triggers to identify when officers need review by\ntheir supervisors, and these triggers can be both quantitative (e.g., if an officer has a\ncertain number of vehicle accidents) and comparative to an officer’s peers (e.g., if an\n56\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 71 of 94\nVIII. Complaints and Discipline\nA.Racial ProfilingAllegations\nofficer has used force significantly more than other officers with similar assignments).\nSome systems can also analyze information for trends and patterns of squads and units,\nnot just individual officers, so supervisors can be reviewed as well. However, an EIS\nsystem like RAILS will affect the behavior of officers only if supervisors use the RAILS\nanalyses toreviewofficers andact whenappropriate.\nVIII. Complaints and Discipline\nThe court orders and the parties’ agreements require that the NYPD improve the\nway it deals with discipline and complaints relating to stop and frisk and trespass\nenforcement. A fair, accurate and prompt disciplinary system is central to the court\norders and also to improving relations between police officers and their superiors and\nbetween the police and the community. The system should be seen as legitimate by the\npoliceandthecommunitybeingpoliced.\nA. Racial ProfilingAllegations\n1. Milestones\nThe court found that the NYPD did not effectively track and investigate\nallegations of racial profiling. The NYPD did not have a separate category for\nallegations of racial or other prohibited profiling, and therefore did not know how many\nof these complaints had been made. It also did not track the outcome of the\ninvestigations of these complaints—whether the allegation was substantiated and, if so,\nwhether any remedial or disciplinary action was taken. The court orders and the parties’\nagreements require the NYPD to begin tracking and appropriately investigating\ncomplaints it receives relatedtoprofiling.\n2. Status and Assessment\n57\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 72 of 94\nVIII. Complaints and Discipline\nA.Racial ProfilingAllegations\nThe NYPD has changed the way allegations of racial profiling and bias-based\npolicing are categorized, processed, tracked and investigated. All profiling allegations,\nno matter how they are made to the NYPD (e.g., in a 311 or 911 call, by a call or visit to\nthe IAB, or at a precinct), are now referred to IAB. IAB’s Command Center logs the\ncomplaint into its case management system—the Internal Case Information System\n(ICIS). In October 2014, a “profiling” category was added to that system, including nine\nsubcategories: race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, age, gender, gender\nidentity and sexual orientation. Subsequently, additional subcategories of creed,\nalienage, citizenship status, disability and housing status were added to track the\ncategories listed in the New York City Administrative Code and in the NYPD’s racial\nprofilingpolicy,P.G.203-25.\nThe Department also changed how and by whom profiling allegations are\nclassified and investigated. Before January 2015, these complaints were classified as\n“OG” or “outside guidelines,” a classification for cases considered less serious than those\ncategorized as “M” or “misconduct” cases, which are tracked and reviewed by IAB. An\nallegation of police corruption is categorized as a “C” case and investigated by IAB. As\nof January 2015, allegations of racial or other prohibited profiling are classified as the\nmore serious “M” cases. After the allegation is logged into the IAB case management\nsystem, the complaint is assigned for investigation. Previously, complaints of profiling\nwere investigated by supervisors assigned to the same precinct or bureau where the\nsubject of the investigation worked. Since January 2015, these investigations have been\nassigned to investigative units attached to the borough (not precinct) command or to the\nrelevant bureau command (e.g., the Transit Bureau command). If a complaint also\n58\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 73 of 94\nVIII. Complaints and Discipline\nA.Racial ProfilingAllegations\nincludes an allegation of corruption, the investigation will be done by IAB. Pending\ninvestigations are reviewed at monthly meetings among IAB and investigative unit\nsupervisors, and the resulting dispositions are reviewed and tracked in IAB’s case\nmanagement system.\nThe changes in classification, intake, assignment and investigation of profiling\ncomplaints have been made through internal memoranda and orders rather than formal\nchanges in NYPD procedures. The NYPD is currently examining relevant Patrol Guide,\nAdministrative Guide and Detective Guide procedures, as well as IAB’s procedures, to\ndetermine whether it believes any changes in those documents should be made. IAB is\nalso drafting guidelines for profiling investigations and training for its Command Center,\nIAB investigators and the borough investigations units. The material will cover the new\npolicies for racial profiling and bias-based policing and investigative techniques to be\nused regarding profiling complaints. This training, when approved, will be conducted by\nthe IAB training unit. These changes in procedures, training and investigative guidelines\nhave been distributed to the parties for review and comment, and will be reviewed by the\nmonitor.\nOne issue identified by the monitor is that allegations of racial or other profiling\nallegations made to the CCRB but not the NYPD are not being investigated by either the\nCCRB or the Department. The CCRB does not believe that profiling complaints are\nwithin its authority to investigate complaints of force, abuse of authority, discourtesy or\noffensive language (FADO), and so does not investigate them. If a complainant alleges\nthat an improper stop was made and that the officer made the stop because of the\ncomplainant’s race, the CCRB will investigate whether there was an appropriate basis for\n59\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 74 of 94\nVIII. Complaints and Discipline\nA.Racial ProfilingAllegations\nthe stop, but will not separately investigate the racial profiling allegation. It does,\nhowever, note these allegations of profiling in its database. CCRB personnel populate an\non-lineform that includes a“Reason for Initial Contact.” A drop-down menustates “C/V\n[complainant/victim] believes raciallyprofiled (Do not ask C/V this question. Check only\nifC/Vvolunteers this info).”\nAlthough the CCRB has captured information about racial profiling as a reason\nfor initial contact since 2004, it has not referred these allegations to the NYPD for\ninvestigation. At a meeting with the monitor, the CCRB chair and staff, and IAB\npersonnel, the Department and the CCRB agreed that the CCRB would now notify IAB\nwhen the complainant/victim states that he or she was profiled. IAB and the CCRB will\nwork together on any procedures or protocols necessary to effectuate this agreement and\nwill examine whether there are any practices or protocols that should be established for\nsituations in which there are parallel investigations (the CCRB investigating the FADO\nallegation and NYPD investigating the profiling allegation), so that duplication and/or\npotential disruptionforcomplainants, witnesses andofficers canbediminished.\nThe Department states that with profiling allegations separatelycategorized in the\nIAB’s database, IAB and the RMB will be able to analyze the data to determine trends,\npatterns or other indications of problematic behavior within a precinct, borough or\n60\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 75 of 94\nVIII.

Any analysis should also include the CCRB cases in\nwhichacomplainant or witness believes that heorshewas subject toprofiling.\nIn 2014, there were 15 allegations of profiling made to the Department after it\nbegan tracking profiling allegations. These cases were investigated as “outside\nguidelines” cases at the subject officers’ commands. Of the 15 cases, the Department\nreported that eight allegations were unsubstantiated and five were unfounded; in two\ncases, theofficers wereexonerated.4\nDuring 2015, IAB received 335 profiling cases containing 478 allegations of\nprofiling. Of those 478 allegations, 345 are open, 83 were determined to be unfounded\nand 39 were determined to be unsubstantiated; with respect to nine allegations, the\nofficers were exonerated. The most cited category of profiling is “color” (155\nallegations). The monitor has asked for the full investigative files for a sample of these\ncases. When received, the monitor will review them to assess the thoroughness of the\ninvestigations.\nB. Handlingof Complaints Substantiated bytheCCRB\n1. Milestones\nThe court orders and the parties’ agreements require that the Department\nAdvocate’s Office (DAO) improve its procedures for handling CCRB findings of\nsubstantiated misconduct during stops. This improvement must include increased\ndeference to credibility determinations made by the CCRB and an evidentiary standard\nthat is neutral between the claims of complainants and officers. If the CCRB has\n4 Unfounded means there is sufficient credible evidence to believe that the officer did not commit the\nalleged act. Unsubstantiated means the available evidence is insufficient to determine whether the officer\ndid or did not commit misconduct. Exonerated means the officer was found to have committed the act\nalleged,buttheofficer’sactionsweredeterminedtobelawful.\n61\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 76 of 94\nVIII. Complaints and Discipline\nB.Handlingof Complaints Substantiated byCCRB\nsubstantiated a complaint based on the statements and credibility of the complainant, the\nDepartment cannot imposeanadditional requirement ofcorroboratingphysical evidence.\n2. Status and Assessment\nThe court found that the NYPD failed to impose meaningful discipline when\nofficers engaged in unconstitutional stops and frisks. In particular, it found that even\nwhen the CCRB determined that a complaint was substantiated, the DAO conducted its\nown review and rejected the CCRB’s findings if the CCRB based its decision on\ncredibility determinations in favor of civilian witnesses as against police officers. If the\nCCRB decision was based onlyon the testimony of the complainant, the court found that\nthe DAO required additional corroborating evidence. The court cited the percentage of\ncases in which the DAO declined to pursue discipline in substantiated cases in the years\n2007-2012, and noted that in cases in which discipline was pursued, DAO “consistently\ndowngraded the discipline” recommended by CCRB and recommended instructions, the\nleast severeform ofdiscipline,inthemajorityofcases inmost years.\nSeveral changes have been made in the way the NYPD handles cases in which\nallegations have been substantiated by the CCRB. First, as the result of a memorandum\nofunderstanding(MOU) betweentheCCRB andtheDepartment in2012,theCCRBnow\nprosecutes more serious cases—those involving charges and specifications—when it\nsubstantiates the allegation. These cases are tried in the trial room of the NYPD in front\nof an administrative law judge; the judge’s ruling is forwarded to the police\ncommissioner, who makes the final decision regarding both disposition and penalty.\nBefore the MOU was put in place, the DAO prosecuted cases involving charges and\nspecifications, and could decline to proceed in the trial room on an allegation\n62\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 77 of 94\nVIII. Complaints and Discipline\nB.Handlingof Complaints Substantiated byCCRB\nsubstantiated bythe CCRB. The DAO can no longer decide not to prosecute those cases.\nUnder the MOU, the police commissioner does retain the authority to direct that a case\nnot beprosecuted.\nTheMOUdoes not applytocases inwhichthe CCRBrecommends disciplineless\nserious than charges and specifications. The DAO continues to review the CCRB’s\ndetermination in those cases. The DAO can agree with the CCRB’s determination,\ndecide not to go forward with the complaint (Department Unable to Prosecute, or DUP),\nor recommend less or more severe discipline to the police commissioner. Unlike more\nserious cases in which a trial is held in the NYPD trial room, there is no trial for cases in\nwhich the discipline recommended is losing up to five days of vacation (command\ndiscipline A), losing up to ten days of vacation (command discipline B), retraining or\ninstructions.\nA second change in the complaint process was the establishment of a method for\nthe DAO to request that the CCRB reconsider its determination and recommended\ndiscipline. This reconsideration process was approved by the CCRB in December 2014.\nPrior to the establishment of the reconsideration process, if the DAO disagreed with a\nCCRB disposition, it would not send the substantiated allegation to the police\ncommissioner for a final decision, but would decline to proceed with the case (DUP); if\nthe DAO disagreed with the CCRB’s suggested penalty, DAO would send its\nrecommended penaltyto thepolice commissioner. Withthenew reconsiderationprocess,\nif the DAO disagrees with the CCRB’s determination that an allegation was substantiated\nor with the CCRB’s recommended discipline, the DAO may request in writing that the\nCCRB reconsider the case and state why the NYPD disagrees. If the CCRB agrees to\n63\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 78 of 94\nVIII. Complaints and Discipline\nB.Handlingof Complaints Substantiated byCCRB\nreconsider the case, the CCRB panel that made the initial decision can modify its\ndecision that the allegation was substantiated or its recommendation for discipline, or it\ncan determine that its original decision was correct. Although the DAO may seek a\nchange in CCRB’s decisions, the DAO no longer unilaterally decides whether or not to\npursue the case. If the CCRB does not agree with the DAO’s request for reconsideration\nand maintains its original decision, both the DAO’s recommendations and the CCRB’s\nrecommendations aresent tothepolicecommissioner.\nThe CCRB and the DAO are agreeing more often than in prior years about when\nan allegation is substantiated and what penalties are appropriate. According to the\nCCRB’s 2015 Semiannual Report, “During the first half of 2015, the DAO pursued\ndiscipline in 92% of CCRB cases, up from 89% during September to December 2014,\n62%from JanuarytoAugust 2014,and57%in2013.”5\nThe DAO provided the monitor team with data regarding complaints in which\nallegations relatingtostops, questions, frisks orsearches weresubstantiated bytheCCRB\nand sent to the NYPD in 2014 and 2015. The DAO requested that the CCRB reconsider\ntwelve of the cases sent to the NYPD in 2014. In two of these twelve cases, the DAO\nrecommended that the disposition of the case be changed. In both cases, after\nreconsideration, the CCRB changed the disposition from “substantiated” to “exonerated,”\nand the NYPD agreed and closed the cases administratively. In ten cases, the DAO\nrequested that the CCRB change its penalty recommendation. The CCRB agreed with\nthe DAO’s recommendation in one of the ten cases. In six cases, the CCRB agreed to\nreduce the penalty, but not as much as the DAO had recommended, and in three cases,\n5 CCRB 2015 Semiannual Report, p. 28, http://www.nyc.gov/html/ccrb/downloads/pdf/2015-Semi-\nAnnual-Report.pdf.\n64\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 79 of 94\nVIII. Complaints and Discipline\nB.Handlingof Complaints Substantiated byCCRB\nthe CCRB disagreed with the DAO and did not change its penalty recommendation. In\nthose nine cases, the police commissioner agreed with the final recommendation of the\nDAO.\nIn 2015, CCRB substantiated and sent to the NYPD 255 cases involving stops,\nquestions, frisks or searches and one case involving an allegation of an improper trespass\narrest. The DAO has reviewed 160 of these cases; 96 are still under review. Of the 160\ncases reviewed, the DAO agreed with the CCRB’s recommendations in 142 cases (89\npercent) and requested that the CCRB reconsider eighteen cases (eleven percent). In one\ncase, the DAO requested that the penaltyrecommended bythe CCRB be increased, and it\nwas. In five cases, the DAO requested that the CCRB change its disposition from\n“substantiated” to “unsubstantiated”; the CCRB agreed in two of the five cases, but\nmaintained its determination in the other three cases. In those cases, the police\ncommissioner agreed with the CCRB in two and imposed training, and agreed with the\nDAO in the third and imposed no discipline. In twelve cases, the DAO requested that the\nCCRB reduce the penalty it recommended. In one of these twelve cases, the CCRB\nagreed to reduce its recommended penalty. In three cases, the CCRB agreed to reduce its\nrecommended penalty, but not as much as the DAO had requested. In eight cases, the\nCCRBdisagreedwiththeDAOandmaintainedits penaltyrecommendations.\n65\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 80 of 94\nVIII.

It also acknowledges the lack of adequate\nand clear training, and the complexities of the law. Thus, the\nCCRB is recommending formalized training and command\ndiscipline more often than not for frisk and search misconduct,\nespecially when the stop itself was lawful. The Board’s\nevaluation of misconduct has not changed, and remains\nconsistent withconstitutional andlegal principles.6\nThe monitor will undertake a more in-depth review of the cases in which\nreconsiderationwas requestedandwill workwith theparties toaddress anyconcerns.\nIX. Performance Goals, Objectives and Evaluation\nThe Department’s development of a robust system for evaluating officers is\ncentral to the monitor’s mission because evaluations affect many of the incentives that\ncanimproveorworsenofficer behavior. The evidence at trial,bolsteredmorerecentlyby\nobservations of focus groups and numerous conversations the monitor’s team has had\nwith members of the service, was that in the past, officer evaluations were based largely\non “numbers” to show enforcement activity. Officers felt pressure to produce these\nnumbers in order to receive a positive evaluation. Otherwise, they feared, they would be\ndisadvantaged in many ways—for example, in assignments, promotions, overtime, time\noffandtransfers.\nThese expectations were communicated through the Compstat process, a key\ncomponent of the NYPD’s crime management system. Regularly, precinct commanders\nare called upon at Compstat meetings to explain the crime conditions in their commands,\nas well as what their personnel are doing in response to these crimes. In previous years,\ncommanding officers returned to their precincts from Compstat meetings with a\nheightened focus on quantifiable activities, including the number of stops and frisks. A\n6 CCRB 2014 Annual Report, at 46, available at http://www.nyc.gov/html/ccrb/downloads/pdf/2014-\nannual-report-rev2layout.pdf.\n67\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 82 of 94\nIX.Performance Goals, Objectives and Evaluation\nhigh number of stops reported became a common “defense” at Compstat sessions by\nprecinct commanders wishingtodemonstratetheywere respondingtocrime conditions.\nThe court also identified the NYPD’s performance objectives, incorporated in\nOperations Order 52 (Use of Performance Objectives), as another illustration that the\nevaluation and measurement of officers was based predominantly on enforcement\nactivity. Officers report their activities, including stop reports, weekly, monthly and\nquarterly (the Department’s activity reporting system is known as the “Quest for\nExcellence,” or “Quest”). The qualityof those reports was not evaluated, just the number\nofreports submitted.\nAs described to us by many officers, the pressure for numbers caused by these\nevaluations and performance objectives affected stop-related activity in two ways. First,\nthere were stops of people who should not have been stopped because the officers did not\nhave the required reasonable suspicion for the stop. Second, officers would complete a\nstop report for encounters that were not stops at all, but voluntary encounters or Level 1\nor 2 encounters, or even create fictitious reports purportedlydocumenting encounters that\nhad not happened. It is not possible to determine how manyof the stops reported in prior\nyears wereeither improperornot stops at all; nor is that themonitor’s role. However,the\nfindings of the court and what the monitor has heard more recently from numerous\nofficers throughout the ranks suggest that there was a substantial amount of both. That\nhistory provides a caution going forward. It is critical to implement a new evaluation\nsystem that promotes both good police work and the integrity of reporting stop, frisk and\ntrespass enforcement activity. That task includes clearing up any remaining\n68\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 83 of 94\nIX.Performance Goals, Objectives and Evaluation\nmisunderstanding among officers about when it is appropriate and lawful to engage in\nstops, frisks ortrespass enforcement andalso about whenreports must befilledout.\nA. Milestones\nNYPD performance measures and objectives should include an assessment of the\nconstitutionality of an officer’s stops, frisks and trespass arrests. Performance measures\nand objectives for a supervisor should include the supervisor’s review of his or her\nsubordinates’ activities in these areas and whether the supervisor adequately addressed\nany insufficiencies. Evaluations of Department members, including incentives the\nDepartment uses in managing its personnel, such as its criteria for discretionary\npromotions, should take into account the constitutionality of stops, frisks and trespass\narrests engagedinorsupervisedbymembers oftheservice.\nB. Status and Assessment\nIn addressing stop and frisk and also in explaining his vision for policing in New\nYork City, Commissioner Bratton has said clearly that what matters is the quality of\nstops, not the quantity. Quality means that stops should be made when appropriate and\nthat they should be done lawfully and professionally. That message has been reinforced\nat Compstat sessions. In the sessions observed by the monitor team, the commanding\nofficers have not been asked about the number of stops in their commands. Many\nofficers do report that they feel less pressure to produce “numbers” of stops, and this is\nreflected in the drop in the number of reported stops. But in focus groups, a few officers\nreport—and these maybe isolated instances—that “numbers” of stops still are being used\nto reward or withhold rewards from them. Many others say that they (or other officers)\nsometimes avoid making legitimate stops, or make them without documentation, because\n69\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 84 of 94\nX.JointRemedial Process\n“it’s just not worth it.” As explained by these officers and as described at pages 36-37\nabove, this attitude is based on the belief that they will be severely disciplined for even\nminor errors in documentation or on fear of being sued for these errors and not being\nindemnified by the City. The monitor’s first report raised concerns that this may be\nhappening,andmore recent evidencedoes not dispel them.\nThe challenge for the NYPD, as noted earlier in this report, is for supervisors to\nensure that officers are making stops and frisks when appropriate, that they do so\nconstitutionally and professionally, and that they document the stops and frisks they\nmake. Evaluationmeasures that reflect these goals areessential.\nThe NYPD has stated that it is committed to making substantive changes to its\nperformance and evaluation criteria. It notes that these changes are part of the larger\ncultural change that the NYPD is attempting, including empowering sergeants and\ndecentralizing authority, measuring problem-solving instead of activity only, and making\ntraining more relevant. The Department has created a working group to examine how to\nevaluate performance, and many ways are being explored. Whatever methods are\nchosen, however, if they do not incorporate the goal of constitutional policing that serves\nthe communities, these methods will not support the changes required by the court orders\nand the parties’ agreements or the vision for the NYPD announced by Commissioner\nBratton.\nX. JointRemedial Process\nA “Joint Remedial Process” was ordered bythe court and agreed to bythe parties.\nIt is a process by which the facilitator (Justice Ariel Belen (ret.)) seeks input from\nstakeholders and affected communities to see whether there are possible reforms in\naddition to those already required. At the end of the process, Justice Belen will prepare a\n70\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 85 of 94\nX.JointRemedial Process\nreport with potential recommendations for the consideration of the monitor and the court.\nUnder the court order, these proposed remedial measures must be no broader than\nnecessary to bring the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk and trespass arrests into compliance\nwiththeFourthand FourteenthAmendments.\nAs currentlyplanned, the Joint Remedial Process has several phases, starting with\nfocus groups of those most affected by the NYPD’s stop and frisk and trespass arrest\npractices. Focus groups began in October 2015 and are scheduled to continue through\nFebruary 2016. Thirty-eight focus groups have been conducted to date. Questions for\nthe focus group were prepared in consultation with the parties and an advisorycommittee\ncomprised of community organizations, NYPD leadership, police union representatives,\nreligious leaders and academics. Each focus group has approximately eight to ten\nresidents of New York City. Participants have predominantly included young black and\nLatino men, though there has also been substantial representation of women and LGBTQ\nyouth, homeless people and NYCHA residents. The facilitator expects to conduct\nadditional focus groups comprised of NYCHA housing residents to discuss issues\npertainingtopolicingin andaroundresidential buildings, andasessionon Staten Island.\nThe facilitator then plans to meet with community leaders, advocates and the\nNYPD to discuss possible additional reforms that they may want the facilitator to\nconsider. The next phase will be a series of community forums around New York City.\nThese will be structured, and the discussions will be based in large part on the\ninformation gathered during the focus groups and subsequent meetings. Although the\ncommunity forums will be primarily to collect community input about possible reforms,\n71\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 86 of 94\nXI. ComplianceMetrics\nthey may also serve as opportunities to develop further dialogue between the NYPD and\nthecommunities theyserve.\nThe facilitator will share the information gathered from the process described\nabove with stakeholders and the parties, seek their feedback, and prepare a report with\npossiblerecommendations foradditional reforms tothemonitorandthecourt.\nXI. ComplianceMetrics\nUltimately, the monitor must report to the court his assessment of whether the\nNYPD is in “substantial compliance” with the requirements of the court orders and the\nparties’ agreements. In doing so, the monitor will evaluate compliance with specific\nremedial measures required by the court and the agreements, such as the promulgation of\nnew policies, new training and a new stop report form, the institution of new audits, and\nthe completion of a pilot program for body-worn cameras. But the monitor must also\nassess whether all of these changes and programs result in stops, frisks and trespass\narrests that are consistently constitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nBeginning very early in this monitorship, the parties have been asked to express their\nviews on how compliance with all the requirements of the court and the agreements\nshould be measured. The monitor has recently received preliminary views from the\nplaintiffs and the NYPD. In the future, the monitor will report on these compliance\nmeasures. To the extent possible, the NYPD should have benchmarks against which it\nandothers canjudgeprogress.\n72\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 87 of 94\nAppendix 1\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 88 of 94\nAppendix1\nSelected Documents on MonitorWebsite\nHome Page(http://nypdmonitor.org/)\nOverview (http://nypdmonitor.org/overview/)\nFirst Reportof IndependentMonitor(http://nypdmonitor.org/resourcesreports/monitor-reports/)\nCourtOpinions and Orders\n(http://nypdmonitor.org/resourcesreports/court-opinions-and-orders/)\nFloydv.Cityof New YorkRemedial Order\nFloydv.Cityof New York LiabilityOpinion\nFloydv.Cityof New YorkModificationofRemedial Order\nLigonv.Cityof NewYorkPreliminaryInjunction\nDavis v.Cityof New YorkSettlement andExhibits\nModificationofOrderwithrespect toBody-Worn CameraPilot\nPolicies\n(http://nypdmonitor.org/resourcesreports/policies/)\nRevisedPolicyonStopandFrisk (P.G.212-11)\nRevisedPolicyProhibitingRacial Profilingand Bias-BasedPolicing(P.G. 203-25)\nDavis LetteronPolicy\nFloyd LetteronPolicy\nLigon LetteronPolicy\nTraining\n(http://nypdmonitor.org/resourcesreports/training/)\nStop and Frisk\nInvestigativeEncounters-PolicingLegally,Recruit Student Guide\nInvestigativeEncounters-PolicingLegally,Recruit Student Guide-Updated\nInvestigativeEncounters-PolicingLegally,Recruit PowerPoint Presentation\nFTOGuide-Investigative Encounters\nFTOTraining-InvestigativeEncounters, PowerPoint Presentation\nRacial Profilingand Bias-Based Policing\nPolicingImpartially,Recruit Student Guide\nPolicingImpartially,Recruit Student Guide-Updated\nPolicingImpartially,Recruit PowerPoint Presentation\nPolicingImpartially,Recruit PowerPoint Presentation(part 2)\nPolicingImpartially,Recruit PowerPoint Presentation(part 3)\nHousing\nTrespass Affidavit Program (TAP),Recruit Student Guide\nTrespass Affidavit Program (TAP),Recruit PowerPoint Presentation\nNYCHAandTAP HousingInteriorPatrol,Recruit LessonPlan\nNYCHAandTAP HousingInteriorPatrol,Recruit Student Guide\nNYCHAandTAP HousingInteriorPatrol,Recruit PowerPoint Presentation\nNYCHARules andRegulations, In-service LessonPlan\n1\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 89 of 94\nBody-Worn Cameras\n(http://nypdmonitor.org/resourcesreports/body-worn-cameras/)\nSummaryof BodyWorn CameraPilot Design\nMonitor’s RecommendationtoModifyRemedial Order\nModificationofOrderon Body-WornCameraPilot\nNYPDletterOutliningPlanfor BodyWornCameraPolicies\nNYPDReference Materials\n(http://nypdmonitor.org/resourcesreports/nypd-reference-materials/)\nInvestigativeEncounters ReferenceGuide\nInvestigativeEncounters At aGlanceBooklet\nInvestigativeEncounters Chart A\nInvestigativeEncounters Chart B\nInvestigativeEncounters MemoBook Insert\n2\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 90 of 94\nAppendix 2\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 91 of 94\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 92 of 94\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 93 of 94\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 245   Filed 02/16/16   Page 94 of 94",

The  designated  NYPD  personnel  shall  enter  the \ncompiled  information  into  a  database,  and  ensure  that  the  compiled  information  is \ntransmitted to the Committee.  \nc.  The Committee shall set forth a written policy for the evaluation of the \ninformation collected with sufficient detail to guide its assessments of individual officers \nand the extent and manner of intervention to be applied.  The policy should allow for a \nrange of appropriate remedial measures including, but not limited to:  \n(i) refresher trainings;   \n(ii) mentoring;   \n(iii) monitoring;   \n(iv) enhanced supervision;   \n6 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 419   Filed 06/02/20   Page 7 of 11\n(v) change of assignment;  \n(vi) health and wellness referral; and \n(vii) referral for potential disciplinary action to an internal NYPD bureau, or \nfor criminal investigation to an external agency, such as a District \nAttorney’s Office. \nThe  policy  shall  provide  flexibility  to  tailor  interventions  to  each  Subject  Officer’s \ncircumstances.    The  policy  shall  contain  guidelines  to  ensure  consistent,  fair,  and \nproportionate outcomes.  The policy shall be posted on the NYPD public website.   \nd. The Committee shall track metrics to measure performance of the program, \nincluding:  (a)  number  of  police  officers  assessed,  categorized  by  type  of  threshold \ntriggered; (b) number of police officers who triggered the early intervention system \nmechanism more than once; (c) number of interventions or remedies directed, categorized \nby type and duration; (d) number of police officers successfully completing written action \nplans referred to in paragraph 4.d; (e) number of police officers subject to early intervention \nwho continued to be flagged for monitoring once the recommended intervention was \ncomplete; (f) number of police officers who become the subject of Civilian Complaint \nReview Board or NYPD investigations, or lawsuits, after entry into the program; and (g) \nnumber of police officers terminated or placed on dismissal probation after entry into the \nprogram.  The NYPD shall report on these metrics quarterly.  The quarterly reports shall \nbe statistical and summary in nature without identifying characteristics, and shall be \npublicly available. \ne.  The Committee, in consultation with the Monitor and available to Plaintiffs \nprior to adoption, shall develop a program for systematically receiving and assessing \n7 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 419   Filed 06/02/20   Page 8 of 11\ninformation regarding adverse findings on the conduct of police officers involving illegal \nstops or illegal trespass enforcements for consideration in officer performance evaluations, \ntransfer requests and discretionary promotional decisions.  Such assessments and relevant \ninformation shall be provided to the Police Commissioner, or the Police Commissioner’s \ndesignee(s), for consideration by personnel making performance evaluations, transfer or \ndiscretionary promotional decisions, on a case by case basis, as the Police Commissioner \ndeems appropriate. \nf. The Committee must assess a Subject Officer’s need for early intervention \nwhen  a  Subject  Officer  crosses  designated  thresholds.    A  Subject  Officer  crosses  a \ndesignated threshold when he or she:  \n(i) receives  three  or  more  declinations  of  prosecution  relating  to  the \ncategories specified in paragraph 1(a)(i)-(xii) in a twelve-month period; \nor  \n(ii) receives  a  suppression  decision  in  a  case  in  which  evidence  was \nprecluded as a result of an allegation of an unlawful stop, frisk, search, \ntrespass enforcement or racial profiling, including racial slurs; or  \n(iii) receives a court finding of incredible testimony; or  \n(iv) is  a  named  defendant  in  a  lawsuit  and  the  New  York  City  Law \nDepartment has declined to represent the Subject Officer; or  \n(v) is  a  named  defendant  in  a  lawsuit  and  the  New  York  City  Law \nDepartment has declined to indemnify the Subject Officer; or  \n(vi) is a named defendant in any lawsuit alleging an unconstitutional stop, \nan unconstitutional trespass enforcement, or racial profiling or racial \n8 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 419   Filed 06/02/20   Page 9 of 11\nslurs where there has been a judgment or settlement against a police \nofficer, and where there exists evidence that the police officer violated \na rule or regulation of the NYPD; or \n(vii) receives any complaint containing an allegation of racial profiling or \nracial slurs. \n4. The  NYPD  shall  systematically  act  on  the  following  categories  of \ninformation in the manner described herein:  \na. The Committee shall determine if intervention with respect to a Subject \nOfficer is appropriate after reviewing:  (1) all relevant details pertaining to the underlying \nfacts of the incident or incidents that caused the Subject Officer to cross a threshold; (2) \nthe Subject Officer’s disciplinary history and performance monitoring; (3) the Subject \nOfficer’s tenure with the NYPD; (4) the Subject Officer’s performance evaluations; (5) the \nSubject Officer’s past and current assignments; and (6) whether the Subject Officer has \nappeared before the Committee more than once.  The Committee may also utilize or consult \nwith other NYPD resources, such as a NYPD health and wellness representative or the \ncommander of the Training Academy.  When appropriate, the Committee shall select from \na range of interventions, including, but not limited to:  \n(i) refresher trainings;   \n(ii) mentoring;   \n(iii) monitoring;   \n(iv) enhanced supervision;   \n(v) change of assignment;  \n(vi) health and wellness referral; and \n9 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 419   Filed 06/02/20   Page 10 of 11\n(vii) referral for potential disciplinary action to an internal NYPD bureau, or \nfor criminal investigation to an external agency, such as a District \nAttorney’s Office.   \nb. The  Committee  shall  review,  and  the  NYPD  shall  enter  into  the \ncomputerized database described in paragraph 2 above, all relevant data pertaining to \nofficers  identified  as  lacking  in  credibility  or  flagged  as  ineffective  by  the  District \nAttorney’s Offices.  This shall include any relevant or associated case materials obtained \nor received by the Early Intervention Committee, the Adverse Credibility Committee, any \nof their constituent members, or any other bureau or office within the NYPD.  Where \nrelevant information exists, it shall factor into the decision-making of the Committee, be \nassociated with the Subject Officer in the computerized database, and be considered in \nconnection with any early intervention determination. \nc. The Committee, before making its decision, shall ask the commanding \nofficer or their designee for their recommendation on what early intervention would be \neffective and, if there had been any prior efforts at interventions, their effectiveness.  \nd. The Committee, within seven business days of making a decision, shall \ncommunicate the appropriate intervention to the Subject Officer’s commanding officer, \nalong with any other relevant internal stakeholders, in a written action plan, and return a \ncopy of the written action plan to the Risk Management Bureau (“RMB”).  RMB must file \nthe written action plan in a database in a manner that permits analysis in the aggregate.  In \nthe event that the Committee determines that no intervention is required, RMB shall log \nthe non-intervention in a database.  \n10 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 419   Filed 06/02/20   Page 11 of 11",

Pls. Mem. at 2–3, 15–16, 23, Floyd, ECF \nNo. 841; e.g., Floyd, ECF No. 840; see also, e.g., Floyd, ECF Nos. 372, 466.3  For the reasons \nstated below, the motion is DENIED.4 \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Ligon, Floyd, and Davis Cases \nThis litigation addresses the NYPD’s stop, frisk, search, and trespass enforcement \npolicies and practices, also known as “stop-and-frisk.”  Floyd, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 556. \n  In Ligon v. City of New York, after a seven-day evidentiary hearing, on January 8, 2013, \nthe Court issued a preliminary injunction against the City, finding that the plaintiffs would likely \nsucceed in proving that the City, by its deliberate indifference, had a policy of conducting \nunconstitutional stops in or near Bronx apartment buildings enrolled in the Trespass Affidavit \nProgram, which permitted the NYPD to patrol private buildings with their owners’ consent.  925 \nF. Supp. 2d 478, 486 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), amending and superseding Ligon v. City of New York, \nNo. 12 Civ. 2274, 2013 WL 71800 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2013).  In Floyd v. City of New York, after \nyears of litigation culminating in a nine-week trial, on August 12, 2013, the Court issued the \nLiability Opinion.  Floyd, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 540. \n  In the Remedial Order, issued the same day as the Liability Opinion, the Court appointed \n \n1 The Remedial Order also covers the constitutional violations at issue in Ligon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. \n2274 (S.D.N.Y.).  See Floyd, 959 F. Supp. 2d 668, 671 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). \n2 On February 4, 2015, the parties in Davis v. City of New York adopted by stipulation the remedies set forth in the \nFloyd Remedial Order, including the appointment of the monitor.  Davis, No. 10 Civ. 699, ECF No. 330 (S.D.N.Y. \nFeb. 4, 2015).   \n3 Except as otherwise noted, ECF citations refer to the docket in Floyd v. City of New York, No. 08 Civ. 1034. \n4 Plaintiffs’ request for oral argument, ECF No. 864 at 20, is DENIED. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 527   Filed 03/28/23   Page 3 of 9\n \nan independent monitor (the “Monitor”)5 to oversee the institution of certain reforms to remedy \nthe NYPD’s unconstitutional practices.  Floyd, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 676–78.6  The Court also \ndirected the parties to participate in “a community-based joint remedial process” (the “JRP”) \nunder the guidance of a court-appointed facilitator (the “Facilitator”) to develop additional \nreforms.  Floyd, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 563; see also Floyd, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 686–88.  The \nFacilitator filed his Final Report and Recommendations on May 15, 2018.  ECF No. 597.  The \nMonitor has submitted eighteen reports detailing the progress of the monitorship.  See ECF No. \n905. \n  In Davis v. City of New York, the plaintiffs alleged unlawful, race-based enforcement of \ntrespass laws in New York City Housing Authority developments.  The parties settled the case \non February 4, 2015, agreeing, among other things, that they would participate in the Floyd and \nLigon remedial process, and that orders issued in that process would be incorporated into the \nsettlement.  Davis, No. 10 Civ. 699 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2015), ECF No. 330 at 9–11. \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Motion to Modify the Remedial Order \nPlaintiffs argue that the end of the JRP also marked the end of “meaningful engagement \nwith, and role of, impacted communities in the Floyd-Davis [m]onitorship.”  Pls. Mem. at 1; see \nalso id. at 9–11.  Plaintiffs contend that “[c]ommunity stakeholders have had very little contact” \nwith the Monitor, “have not had an audience with the Court,” and that the Monitor has \n“completely omitted community members’ perspectives from . . . assessments of the \nconstitutionality of the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk . . . practices.”  Id. at 1–2.  Plaintiffs argue that, \n \n5 Peter L. Zimroth served as the monitor from August 12, 2013, until his death on November 8, 2021.  ECF No. 877.  \nOn January 13, 2022, the Court appointed a new monitor, Mylan L. Denerstein.  Id. \n6 On July 19, 2017, the parties in Ligon settled the outstanding claims, agreeing to significant reforms to the \nNYPD’s trespass enforcement practices, documentation, and training, and agreeing to continued participation in the \nremedial process.  See Ligon, No. 12 Civ. 2274 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2017), ECF No. 296. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 527   Filed 03/28/23   Page 4 of 9\n \nwithout community input, “the Monitor and [the] Court cannot accurately determine whether \n[stop-and-frisk] encounters are conducted constitutionally and in a non-discriminatory manner, \nthus making it unclear whether the Court-ordered stop-and-frisk . . . reforms have in fact been \nsuccessful.”  Id. at 2.  Plaintiffs request that “the Court exercise its broad equitable powers . . . \n[and] modify[] the Remedial Order” by: (1) having the Monitor include (a) “annual community \nsurveys” and (b) “semiannual field audits of stop-and-frisk . . . activity” in its assessment of the \nCity’s compliance with the Remedial Order; (2) “hold[ing] public status conferences at least \ntwice a year”; and (3) “appoint[ing] a Community Collaborative Board” that would (a) advise \n“the Monitor and the Court on the NYPD’s implementation of the various Court-ordered \nreforms” and (b) “have direct input into, among other things, developing the contours of all \ndiscipline reforms submitted for Court approval.”7  Pls. Mem. at 3, 15–16.  The City and the \nMonitor oppose Plaintiffs’ motion.  ECF Nos. 854–55; see also ECF Nos. 892, 897. \nOn August 25, 2022, the Monitor submitted a proposal for a community liaison position \nand a corresponding job description.  E.g., ECF No. 888.  The creation of the community liaison \nposition is intended “to engage the community by offering the public, particularly members most \nimpacted by the [NYPD’s] . . . stop[-and-frisk practices], more opportunities to be heard and to \nprovide input into the Court-ordered remedial reforms.”  Id.  On September 9, 2022, the Court \nordered supplemental briefing on whether the Monitor’s community liaison proposal addressed \nPlaintiffs’ concerns regarding community engagement and involvement in the remedial process.  \nECF No. 889; see also ECF No. 893.  On September 30, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their supplemental \nbrief.  ECF No. 891.  Plaintiffs state that the proposal “does not fully resolve” their concerns \n \n7 Plaintiffs’ proposed order states that “[a]ll . . . disciplinary reform proposals shall be developed in consultation with \nthe [Community Collaborative Board] and using a notice and public comment process coordinated by the Monitor.”  \nECF No. 843 ¶ 4. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 527   Filed 03/28/23   Page 5 of 9\n \ngiven the “uncertainty of the outcome of [the] process” of finalizing the community liaison’s \nplan.  Id. at 1–2.  Plaintiffs request that the Court “hold Plaintiffs’ motion in abeyance for a \nperiod of sixty days following the finalization of the [c]ommunity [l]iaison’s [p]lan,” or, \nalternatively, were the Court to deny Plaintiffs’ request and motion, that “any such denial be \nwithout prejudice to move for similar relief at some future date.”  Id. at 1.  The City opposes \nPlaintiffs’ request.  ECF No. 892.  On November 15, 2022, the Monitor filed a response to the \nparties’ submissions.  ECF No. 897.  The Monitor similarly requests that the Court deny \nPlaintiffs’ motion.  Id. \nWhile the parties provided further briefing on Plaintiffs’ motion, they also worked \n“extensive[ly]” with community groups and the Monitor team to identify suitable individuals for \nthe community liaison position.  See ECF No. 902 at 1–2; ECF No. 897 at 2–3.  First, the \nMonitor established a selection committee consisting of representatives from Plaintiffs, the City, \nand the Monitor team (collectively, the “Selection Committee”).  ECF No. 897 at 2.  Then, the \nSelection Committee jointly reviewed applications, identified candidates to interview, \ninterviewed the candidates and, “by consensus, recommended candidates to the Monitor and the \nCourt.”  Id.  The parties also assembled a community advisory group, which interviewed the \nfinal candidates and “provide[d] their input directly to the Monitor.”  Id.  On December 16, 2022, \nafter interviewing the finalists, the Court appointed Germain Thompson as the independent \ncommunity liaison (the “Community Liaison”).  ECF No. 898.8 \n \n \n \n8 In its December 16, 2022 order, the Court stated that it would address Plaintiffs’ requests and motion, ECF Nos. \n840, 891, in a separate order.  ECF No. 898 at 2 n.3.  This is that decision. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 527   Filed 03/28/23   Page 6 of 9\n \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Legal Standard \n  “The power of a court of equity to modify a decree of injunctive relief is  \nlong-established, broad, and flexible.”  Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 542 (2011) (citation and \nquotation marks omitted).  The district court derives this power in part from Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 54(b), which provides that injunctive orders “may be revised at any time.”  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 54(b).  More broadly, the district court has inherent authority to revise or modify such \norders.  See United States v. LoRusso, 695 F.2d 45, 53 (2d Cir. 1982).  In exercising its discretion \nto modify an injunctive order, a court should not impose modifications that “thwart[] the purpose \nbehind the injunction.”  Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 732 F.2d 253, 257 (2d Cir. \n1984). \nII.  Analysis \n  Plaintiffs argue that the Court should modify the Remedial Order because “[t]he Monitor \ncannot accurately assess whether NYPD officers are adequately implementing the Court-ordered \nstop-and-frisk . . . [reforms] in the field without hearing from the people who are being policed.”  \nPls. Mem. at 25.  The Court shall address Plaintiffs’ requests in turn. \nFirst, Plaintiffs request that the Court order that “the Monitor retain an outside entity to \nwork in consultation with community stakeholders” and “conduct annual community surveys to \nassess ‘public perception of police-civilian street encounters’ and ‘the public’s experience with \nCourt-ordered reforms.’”  Id. at 26 (citing ECF No. 597 at 250).  Plaintiffs contend that these \ncommunity surveys “can empower individuals directly impacted by [the] NYPD’s stop-and-frisk \n. . . practices to share critical information about how they actually experience encounters with \npolice.”  Id. at 27.  The Monitor’s compliance matrix “has recently been revised to incorporate \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 527   Filed 03/28/23   Page 7 of 9\n \nthe input of the Community Liaison and ensure that community members’ experiences and input \nare adequately considered in measuring [the] NYPD’s compliance with the law.”  ECF No. 897 \nat 3; see also ECF No. 897-1.  Plaintiffs agreed with the Monitor’s revisions and did not \nrecommend any further amendments.  ECF No. 897 at 3.  The Court concludes that because \nthese revisions incorporate community perspectives in the Monitor’s compliance assessment, this \nrequest is moot.   \n  Plaintiffs also ask the Court to direct the Monitor to “conduct regular, biannual field \naudits of NYPD officers’ stop-and-frisk . . . activity using integrity testing methods to assess \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendment compliance.”  Pls. Mem. at 29.  Plaintiffs argue that these \naudits “would address some of the inherent limitations in the Monitor’s [s]top [r]eport data \nanalyses,” such as officer underreporting.  Id. at 30.  Plaintiffs propose that the Monitor use \n“testers” to “assess whether and to what extent officers respond differently on the basis of race \nand/or conduct stops, arrests, frisks, and/or searches without adequate legal bases,” stating that \n“[s]imilar methods have been used to study discrimination in employment, housing, lending, and \npublic accommodations.”  Id. at 29–30.  The City contends that this methodology is unreliable \nand that its use as a compliance metric is “untested.”  ECF No. 855 at 22.  The Monitor shares \nsome of the City’s concerns, noting that, inter alia, “such field audits are cumbersome and \ndifficult to implement, especially considering that almost 400 field audits would be required \nevery six months to get a representative sample.”  ECF No. 897 at 4.  Plaintiffs have not shown \nthat their proposal is well-suited to address the concerns they identify.  The proposal is neither \ntailored to the context of this monitorship, nor is it supported by real-world examples suggesting \nthat it would be safe, feasible, or reliable.  Therefore, the Court finds that this proposal is \nunlikely to further the purpose of the Remedial Order. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 527   Filed 03/28/23   Page 8 of 9\n \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ request that the Court modify the Remedial Order to include \nannual community surveys and semiannual stop-and-frisk field audits in the Monitor’s \nassessment of the City’s compliance with the Remedial Order is DENIED. \nSecond, Plaintiffs request that the Court hold public status conferences at least twice a \nyear.  Plaintiffs argue that “[r]egular public status conferences would facilitate community \nstakeholders’ engagement with, and understanding of, the workings and current status of the \nFloyd-Davis [m]onitorship because they would be able to hear” from the Monitor, the parties, \nand the Court.  Pls. Mem. at 25.  The Court does not believe that public status conferences are \nnecessary at this time.  Should the Court determine that one or more status conferences would be \nhelpful, it shall schedule them in due course. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ request that the Court modify the Remedial Order to require the \nCourt to hold public status conferences at least twice a year is DENIED. \n  Third, Plaintiffs request the appointment of a Community Collaborative Board (“CCB”) \nfor “additional and sustained community involvement” in the monitorship.  ECF No. 864 at 5.  \nPlaintiffs argue that the CCB “would expand the number of stakeholders with . . . important \ninformation and engage the perspectives of community members most affected by stop-and-frisk \n. . . enforcement.”  Id. at 11.  The Court agrees that, “[i]f the reforms to stop[-]and[-]frisk are not \nperceived as legitimate by those most affected, the reforms are unlikely to be successful.”  Floyd, \n959 F. Supp. 2d at 686.  The Community Liaison, whose “purpose . . . is to engage the \ncommunity by offering the public, particularly members most impacted by the [NYPD’s]  \nstop[-]and[-]frisk . . . practices, more opportunities to be heard and to provide input into the \nreform process,” will work to achieve that goal.  ECF No. 888-1 at 1.  The Court disagrees with \nPlaintiffs’ characterization of this monitorship as an “outlier among federal court-mandated \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 527   Filed 03/28/23   Page 9 of 9\n \npolice monitorships nationally.”  ECF No. 864 at 8.  This monitorship differs from the ones \nPlaintiffs cite, Pls. Mem. at 18 & n.16, because it does not involve a consent decree—the Court \nordered reforms after it found the City liable for constitutional violations.  In addition, through \nthe work of the parties, the Monitor, and the Community Liaison, the Court is seeking to reach \nout to and include community members through multiple avenues.  The same cannot be said of \nall federal monitorships.  The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that “[e]nsuring the protection of . . . \nrights requires engaging with the people who are most affected by underlying wrongs and who \nare invested in changing their interactions with institutions like the police in tangible, meaningful \nways.”  ECF No. 864 at 1.  The Court concludes, however, that the Community Liaison is best \nsituated to obtain input from the communities most affected by the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk \npractices and address the “public perception” of the reform process.  Id. at 4.  The Court \nrecognizes that the work of the monitorship is ongoing and complex, but it is committed—as are \nthe parties and the Monitor—to achieving the goal of constitutional policing.  See ECF No. 902 \nat 1. \n  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ request that the Court modify the Remedial Order to appoint a \nCCB is DENIED. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion to modify the Remedial Order, ECF Nos. \n840, 891, is DENIED.  Plaintiffs’ request that the Court hold Plaintiffs’ motion in abeyance, ECF \nNo. 891, is DENIED as moot. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: March 28, 2023 \n  New York, New York \n \n \n9 \n ",

The  Parties  agree  that  the  further  development  of cooperative  and  trusting \nrelationships between NYPD officers and TAP Building residents facilitates effective policing, \nand that negative  interactions between NYPD officers and TAP Building residents and their \nauthorized visitors can have a long-lasting, harmful impact on those relationships. \n3.  The  Parties agree that the secured access  of building entryways  and  effective \npolicing within the building are necessary to maintain the safety and security of TAP Buildings. \n4.  The  Parties  agree  that  in  performing  patrols  in  or  around  TAP  Building \nresidences, the NYPD's primary role is to provide a safe and secure living environment for TAP \nBuilding residents and their guests. \n5.  The Parties agree that the proper enforcement of New York State trespass law is \nan important component of the maintenance and security ofTA  P Buildings. \n6.  The Parties agree that the enforcement ofNew York State trespass law must, at all \ntimes, comply with the U.S. Constitution and all other relevant state and federal laws. \n6 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 296   Filed 07/19/17   Page 7 of 48\n7.  The Parties agree that it is imperative to have policies and procedures to prevent \nTAP  Building  residents  and  their  authorized  guests  from  being  subjected  to  requests  for \ninformation  without  objective  credible  reasons,  accusatory  questions  without  a  founded \nsuspicion that criminal activity is  afoot, stops or detentions without reasonable suspicion,  or \narrests or summonses without probable cause. \n8.  The Parties agree that proper and sufficient training, supervision, monitoring, and \ndisciplining ofNYPD officers are necessary to prevent unlawful stops, arrests and/or summonses \nin or around TAP Buildings. \nE.  NYPD ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES IN AND AROUND TAP BUILDINGS \n1.  The NYPD  shall develop,  adopt and  implement the  standards regarding enforcement \nactivities  in  and  around  TAP  Buildings  set  out below  in  Paragraphs  E  (l)(a-m)  and  shall \nimplement policies and procedures, training, supervision, and monitoring programs sufficient to \nconsistently follow, apply, and use those standards: \na.  NYPD officers must have at least an \"objective credible reason\" to approach a \nperson in or around a TAP Building to initiate a Level 1 encounter, as defined in \nPeople  v.  DeBow·, 40  N.Y.2d 210 (1976), and  its progeny.  A person's mere \npresence in or near, entry into, or exit out of a TAP Building does not constitute \nan objective credible reason to approach; \nb.  NYPD officers who request information from  any person in  or around  a TAP \nBuilding,  during  a  Level  1  encounter,  must  not  question  that  person  in  an \naccusatory manner, or create a situation (either by words or actions) that would \ncause a reasonable person to believe that s/he cannot terminate the encounter and \nwalk away; \n7 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 296   Filed 07/19/17   Page 8 of 48\nc.  NYPD  officers  must have a  ·'founded  suspicion\"  to  approach  a person  in  or \naround a TAP Building to engage in a Level 2 encounter, as defined in People v. \nDeBour. 40 N.Y.2d 210 (1976), and its progeny.  A person's mere presence in or \nnear,  entry  into,  or  exit  out  of a  TAP  Building does  not  constitute  founded \nsuspicion of criminality; \nd.  NYPD officers engaged in a Level 2 encounter may ask a person in or around a \nTAP  Building pointed or accusatory questions,  but officers  may not detain  a \nperson or otherwise create a situation (by words or actions) where a reasonable \nperson would believe that s/he cannot terminate the encounter and walk away ; \ne.  NYPD  officers  must have  \"reasonable  suspicion\"  of a  felony  or Penal  Law \nmisdemeanor to conduct a Level 3 stop within the meaning of People v.  DeBow·, \n40 N.Y.2d 210 (1976), and its progeny, or a stop within the meaning of Terry v. \nOhio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), and its progeny, in or around a TAP Building; \nf.  The  following  circumstances,  or any  combinations  thereof,  are  insufficient to \nconstitute \"reasonable suspicion:\" \n1.  a person's mere presence in or near, entry into, or exit out of a TAP \nBuilding; \n11.  a person's silence or refusal to provide information or identification \nwhen questioned by the police; or \niii.  a person's passing through a door of a TAP Building that has a broken \nlock or that has been propped open; \ng.  NYPD officers must complete a standardized form to document every Level 3 \nstop conducted in or around a TAP Building.  For as long as the NYPD requires \n8 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 296   Filed 07/19/17   Page 9 of 48\nofficers to complete the Stop Report, PO 383-151  (03-16), under Docket Entry \nNo. 247, attached  as  Exhibit A,  or its  electronic  equivalent, to document the \ncircumstances of stops, NYPD officers must complete that form for every Level 3 \nstop conducted in or around a TAP Building; \nh.  If the NYPD adopts a different written report documenting the circumstances of \nstops, NYPD officers must complete a report for every Level 3 stop conducted in \nor  around  a  TAP  building,  or  its  electronic  equivalent,  that  records  basic \ninformation, including the following: whether the stop occurred inside or outside \nthe TAP building; the crime suspected by the officer when the stop was initiated; \nthe  stop  location;  the  time  and  duration  of the  stop;  the  length  of any  prior \nobservation  of the  stopped  individual,  if any;  the  factors  that  contributed  to \nsuspicion of the stopped person; actions taken to  stop and/or detain the person \nprior to arrest; whether the stopped individual was ultimately frisked, searched, \nsummonsed or arrested; whether other individuals were stopped during the same \ninvestigative encounter;  whether the  reason for the  stop was  explained to  the \nstopped  individual;  demographic  information  about  the  individual  stopped, \nincluding  race,  sex,  and  age;  the  identification  produced  by  the  stopped \nindividual, if any was provided; information about any contraband or weapons \nrecovered during the stop; and identifying information regarding the officer who \nconducted the stop.  This report must also include a narrative section where the \nofficer must record, in sum and substance, in his/her own words, the basis for the \nstop, and separately explain in sum and substance, why a pat down, frisk or search \n9 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 296   Filed 07/19/17   Page 10 of 48\nwas performed, if those actions occurred, and the basis for believing the person \nwas armed and dangerous. \n1.  NYPD officers must have ·'probable cause\" of criminal activity in order to make \nan  arrest of any person in or around a TAP Building and NYPD officers must \nhave \"probable cause\" of non-criminal violations committed in their presence or \nof criminal activity in order to issue a summons to any person in or around a TAP \nBuilding; \nJ.  NYPD officers must complete a Trespass Crimes Fact Sheet (PD 351-144), under \nDocket Entry No. 249, attached  as  Exhibit B, or its  electronic equivalent, for \nevery trespass arrest made in or around a TAP Building prior to the arraignment \nof the defendant in the criminal case  in  order to document the circumstances \nleading to the officer's encounter with the defendant, the officer's investigation \ninto the defendant's authority to be present in the building, any statements made \nby the defendant, the basis of the officer's belief that the defendant did not have \nauthority to be present in the building,  and  any arrest evidence or contraband \nrecovered by the officer; \nk.  With the exception of consent frisks, no NYPD officer shall conduct a frisk of a \nperson encountered in or around a TAP Building, unless the officer reasonably \nsuspects that the  person encountered  is  armed  and  dangerous,  and  such frisk \nextends no further than is necessary for the discovery of suspected weapons; \nI.  With the exception of consent searches, no NYPD officer shall conduct a search \nextending beyond a frisk of a person, encountered in or around a TAP Building, \nunless the officer is conducting a search incident to arrest, or a search of an area \n10 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 296   Filed 07/19/17   Page 11 of 48\nthat was frisked by an officer, and that frisk revealed an object that the officer \nreasonably believed to be a weapon; \nm.  If NYPD officers establish posts inside or near the entrances of TAP buildings, \nthey may conduct investigative encounters of the vast majority of the persons who \nenter or exit such buildings, only if the officers have an objective credible reason \nfor each person the officer engages in a Level 1 encounter, or founded suspicion \nfor  each  person  the  officer  engages  in  a  Level  2  encounter,  or  reasonable \nsuspicion for each person the officer engages in a Level 3 encounter. \nF. REVISIONS TO NYPD PATROL GUIDE \nI.  Plaintiffs and the City have extensively negotiated the tem1s of Section 212-59 of \nthe  NYPD's  Patrol  Guide  and  have  agreed  to  revisions  that  will  promote  constitutional \ninteractions between NYPD officers and persons encountered during interior patrols  in TAP \nBuildings.  The revised provisions are as specified in the 5-20-16 PG 212-59 AND PG 208-03 \nDraft Interim Order approved by the Court, under Docket Entry No. 249, and attached as Exhibit \nC to this Stipulation. \n2.  If it has not already done so, the NYPD shall promulgate the revised version of \nPG 212-59 within 30 days of the Final Approval Date.  The revised version of PG 212-59 shall \ntake effect upon promulgation. \n3.  With the exception of formatting changes that are non-substantive, if the NYPD \nwishes to amend PG 212-59 or to replace it entirely with a different written policy during the \nCourt-Ordered Monitoring period, it shall first submit any such revision or alternative policy to \nClass Counsel and the Monitor, and provide them 14 days to comment.  After the Court-Ordered \nMonitoring period concludes, but before this Court's jurisdiction in this matter terminates, with \n11 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 296   Filed 07/19/17   Page 12 of 48\nthe exception of formatting changes that are non-substantive, if the NYPD wishes to amend PG \n212-59 or to replace  it entirely with a different written policy, it shall first submit any such \nrevision or alternative policy to Class Counsel and provide them  14 days to comment.  If the \nNYPD makes formatting changes that are non-substantive to PG 212-59, it must provide a copy \nof the revised version of PG 212-59 to Class Counsel within 14 days.  Any amended policy or \nsubstitute policy must comply with the principles and standards set forth in Section E of this \nStipulation. \nG. FORMS/REVISIONS TO TRESPASS CRIMES FACT SHEET \nI.  When NYPD officers effect an arrest for trespass in or around a TAP building, the \nofficers shall complete NYPD's Trespass Crimes Fact Sheet, or its electronic equivalent, prior to \nthe arraignment of the defendant in the criminal case. \n2.  The revised version of the Trespass Crimes Fact Sheet, to which both Plaintiffs \nand the City agree, is attached to this Stipulation as Exhibit B. \n3.  If it has not already done so, the NYPD shall promulgate and begin using the \nTrespass Crimes Fact Sheet within 30 days of the Final Approval Date. \n4.  With the exception of formatting changes that are non-substantive, if the NYPD \nwishes to amend the Trespass Crimes Fact Sheet or to replace it entirely with a different form \nduring  the  Court-Ordered  Monitoring  period,  it  shall  first  submit  any  such  revisions  or \nalternative form to Class Counsel and the Monitor and provide them 14 days to comment.  After \nthe  Court-Ordered  Monitoring period  concludes,  but before this  Court's jurisdiction  in  this \nmatter terminates,  with the  exception of formatting  changes that are  non-substantive,  if the \nNYPD wishes to amend the Trespass Crimes Fact Sheet or to replace it entirely with a different \nform,  it shall first submit any such revision or alternative form to Class Counsel and provide \n12 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 296   Filed 07/19/17   Page 13 of 48\nthem 14 days to comment.  If the NYPD makes formatting changes that are non-substantive to \nthe Trespass Crimes Fact Sheet, it must provide a copy of the revised version of the Trespass \nCrimes Fact Sheet to Class Counsel within 14 days.  Any amended form must comply with the \nprinciples and standards set forth in Paragraph E( 1) U) of this Stipulation. \n5.  With the exception of formatting changes that are non-substantive, if the NYPD \nwishes to amend the Stop, Question and Frisk Worksheet, which may also be referred to as a \nStop Report or \"UF 250,\" or replace it entirely with a different form during the Court-Ordered \nMonitoring period, it shall first submit any such revision or alternative form to the Class Counsel \nand  the  Monitor  and  provide  them  with  14  days  to  comment.

Any amended or substitute form must satisfy the requirements of Paragraph E \n(l)(g). \nH.  REVISIONS TO NYPD ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDE PROCEDURE 303-27, \n\"TRESPASS AFFIDAVIT PROGRAM\" \n1.  Plaintiffs  and  the  City  have  extensively  negotiated  the  tenns  of the  NYPD \nAdministrative Guide Procedure 303-27, entitled \"Trespass Affidavit Program'' and have agreed \nto  revisions  to  ensure  proper  administration  of TAP.  The  revised  version  of the  NYPD \nAdministrative Guide Procedure 303-27 entitled \"Trespass Affidavit Program\", to which both \n13 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 296   Filed 07/19/17   Page 14 of 48\nPlaintiffs and the City agree, is as specified in the 8-4-16 Draft Interim Order attached as Exhibit \nD to this Stipulation. \n2.

Before the expiration of a building's first six months in TAP, the precinct Crime \nPrevention Officer, or another Member of Service designated by the Commanding \nOfficer, will evaluate whether to renew a building's participation in the program \nfor another six months, based on recent incidents, including but not limited to \ncriminal activity and complaints in the preceding six months; \nc.  Before the expiration of a building's second consecutive six months in TAP, the \nprecinct  Commanding  Officer  will  determine  whether  to  renew  a  building's \nparticipation in the program for another six months, based on recent incidents, \n14 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 296   Filed 07/19/17   Page 15 of 48\nincluding but not limited to criminal activity and complaints in the preceding six \nmonths. \nd.  The  Office  of the  Borough  Commander  must  be  notified  when  it  has  been \ndetermined that there is a need for a building to remain in TAP beyond one year. \nIf the  Borough Commander determines that a building should remain  in TAP \nbeyond one year, the Borough Commander shall make a recommendation to the \nOffice of the Chief of Patrol, which will issue final approval for the renewal. \n3.  The NYPD shall promulgate the revised version of the NYPD Administrative \nGuide  Procedure 303-27 entitled ''Trespass Affidavit Program\" within 30 days  of the  Final \nApproval Date. \n4.

The Purpose and Goals of the JRP\nIn advance of the Floyd trial, the plaintiffs submitted briefing on their requested injunctive relief \nin the event that the plaintiffs successfully established that the City was liable for constitutional \nviolations. Pls. MOL in Support of Requested Injunctive Relief, Dkt # 268 (“Remedies Br.”). \nTherein, the plaintiffs requested three categories of reforms: (1) a “Joint-Remedial Process” for \ndeveloping reforms to address the violations proven at trial, which would involve the parties and \ncommunity stakeholders (Remedies Br. at 8-16); (2) a set of reforms to be developed outside of \nthat process (Remedies Br. at 16-20); and (3) the appointment of an Independent Monitor. \n(Remedies Br. at 20-27). After finding the City liable, the Court in sum and substance granted all \nthree requests. See Remedial Order, Dkt # 372 (“Remedial Or.”).1 All of the reforms so-ordered\nby the court thus far have come from category (2), which is the part of the process identified in \nthe Remedial Order as the “Immediate Reform Process.” Remedial Or. at 13-25. \nIn support of their request for the JRP, the plaintiffs cited evidence that the NYPD deliberately \ndisregarded complaints about the stop and frisk practice for more than fourteen years. Remedies \nBr.  at  15-16.  Plaintiffs  argued  that  community  stakeholder  input  was  needed  “in  the  joint \ndevelopment of the Court’s injunctive remedies” to address the NYPD’s indifference to “public \noutcry from all sectors” about its widespread pattern and practice of unconstitutional stops. \nRemedies Br. at 8-9. Immediately following the trial and before the Court issued the decision on \nliability,  the  plaintiffs  submitted  proposed  findings  of  fact  citing  testimony  and  documents \nsubmitted during trial that proved this pattern of deliberate indifference. Pls. Proposed Findings \nof Fact and Conclusions of Law, Dkt # 366 at 38-46.  \nIn its liability decision, the Court found in favor of the plaintiffs on this point, holding that that \nthe City was deliberately indifferent to notice of constitutional violations. Liability Or. at 61 et \nseq.  The  Court  found  that  “[t]he  NYPD  has  received  thorough  and  consistent  notice  of \nconstitutional  problems  in  its  stop  practices  from  multiple  sources,  including  the  media, \ncommunity members, community and legal organizations, individual police officers, and the \nclass members and attorneys in this case.” Id. at 111. Despite this “actual and constructive notice \nsince  at  least  1999,”  the  NYPD  “repeatedly  turned  a  blind  eye  to  clear  evidence  of \nunconstitutional  stops  and  frisks.”  Id.  at  178.  Notably,  the  Court  found  that  the  City’s \nindifference  to  public  outcry  extended  over  the  tenure  of  multiple  mayors  and  police \ncommissioners.  Id.  at  111-117.  Based  on  these  and  other  findings,  the  Court  ordered  the \ndevelopment of “Joint Process Reforms” through the JRP. Remedial Or. at 28-32. \nIn ordering the JRP reforms, the Court opined that input, from those most affected by unlawful \nstops into a set of reforms would be critical to remedying the constitutional violations established \nat trial:  \n1 In the Davis settlement, it was agreed that “the Court-Ordered Monitoring related to trespass \nenforcement in or around NYCHA residences will be identical to the Court Ordered Monitoring \nin the Floyd Remedies Opinion . . . .” Stipulation of Settlement and Order, Davis v. City of New \nYork, 10 Civ. 699 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2015), Dkt. #330, at 10-11. Thus, as part of the Remedial \nOrder, the JRP applies with equal force in the Davis case. See also Stipulation of Settlement and \nOrder, Ligon v. City of New York, 12 Civ. 2274, (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2017), Dkt # 296, at 4, 17. \n2 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 309   Filed 01/29/18   Page 3 of 5\n[C]ommunity input is . . . [a] vital part of a sustainable remedy in this case. The \ncommunities  affected  by  the  NYPD’s  use  of  stop  and  frisk  have  a  distinct \nperspective that is highly relevant to crafting effective reforms. No amount of \nlegal or policing expertise can replace a community’s understanding of the likely \npractical consequences of reforms in terms of both liberty and safety. . . . If the \nreforms to stop and frisk are not perceived as legitimate by those most affected, \nthe reforms are unlikely to be successful. \nRemedial Or. at 29. The Court further ordered that “[a]n essential aspect of the Joint Process \nReforms  will  be  the  development  of  an  improved  system  for  monitoring,  supervision,  and \ndiscipline.” Remedial Or. at 23. \nConsistent  with  the  Court’s  orders,  the  Facilitator’s  team,  the  parties,  and  community \nstakeholders designed and implemented a process for securing input into reforms from those \nmost affected by the NYPD’s unlawful stop and frisk practices. Over a two-year period, the JRP \nincluded  sixty-four  focus  groups,  twenty-eight  community  forums,  and  more  than  a  dozen \nmeetings with community, legal, and policy organizations. Numerous community organizations \nexpended their resources to make this input process happen. All told, thousands of people \nprovided input into the design of JRP reforms. The Remedial Order required negotiations among \nthe parties and community stakeholders to draft JRP reforms. Remedial Or. at 30-31 (providing \nin enumerated sections 1, 2, 8 that the parties and stakeholders are to work with the Facilitator to \nnegotiate a set of joint process reforms). In the event of an impasse, the Remedial Order provides \nthat the Facilitator will submit a report and recommendations on the JRP and that the parties will \nhave the opportunity to comment. Remedial Or. at 32 (enumerated section 9).  \nb. The JRP Impasse\nIn  April  2017,  with  the  process  of  obtaining  input  completed,  the  parties  and  community \nstakeholders began discussing JRP reform proposals based on that input, consistent with the \nRemedial Order’s requirements. During negotiations, the plaintiffs and community stakeholders \nproposed numerous reforms to NYPD discipline, monitoring, and supervision practices, tailored \nto addressing the constitutional violations established at trial. Unfortunately, the parties have \nreached a complete impasse.2\nHaving  reached  an  impasse,  the  Remedial  Order  now  requires  the  public  filing  of  the \nFacilitator’s Report and briefing from the parties so that the Court may determine what reforms \nto so-order. Importantly, though, the impasse between the parties is not only about the substance \nof reforms – though the impasse includes that issue. More fundamentally, there is an impasse \nabout the requirements of the Remedial Order with respect to the JRP itself. Specifically, there is \na  dispute  about  whether  there  will  be  any  so-ordered  reforms  through  the JRP  at  all.  The \nprocedure articulated in the Remedial Order did not contemplate this kind of impasse.   \n2 We are not recounting the substance of our negotiations on particular reforms because we \nagreed to keep those details private in order to foster more robust and candid negotiations. \n3 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 309   Filed 01/29/18   Page 4 of 5\nII. A JRP Status Conference and Scheduling Order is Necessary and Appropriate\nThe Court has inherent authority to require status conferences and enter scheduling orders to \nfacilitate the management of complex matters. See Escoffier v. City of New York, 13 CV 03918 \n(JRP) (DF), 2017 WL 65322. *7, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 988 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 4 2017) (noting \ncourt’s “inherent authority to manage litigation”); Advanced Analytics, Inc. v. Citigroup Global \nMarkets, Inc., 301 F.R.D. 47, 51 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (same). Status conferences and scheduling \norders are customary and routine in remedial processes involving police departments and other \npublic agencies. See, e.g., U.S. v. City of New York, 1:07-cv-02067 (NGG) (in remedial process \ninvolving New York City Fire Department and court-appointed monitor who regularly files \nstatus reports, court held seven status conferences in the past year); U.S. v. Seattle, 12-cv-1282 \n(in  first  three  years  of  remedial  process  involving  the  Seattle  Police  Department  and  an \nindependent monitor, court held six status conferences and entered various scheduling orders). \nThere are several substantive and procedural matters that need to be managed in order for the \nCourt to render a determination on the JRP reforms, and a status conference would facilitate the \ndevelopment and timeline of an appropriate process. First, Plaintiffs seek an order directing the \nFacilitator to immediately and publicly file the primary community input materials from the JRP. \nThis includes the Facilitator’s summary of the JRP input process; the anonymized focus group \ntranscripts; and formal non-party written submissions made to the Facilitator as part of what the \nFacilitator  termed  “Leadership  Meetings.”  The  immediate  submission  of  these  materials  is \nnecessary to enable the parties to prepare anticipated motions and to ensure appropriate public \ntransparency about this extensive community input process. Second, Plaintiffs seek a date certain \nfor the issuance of the Facilitator’s Report that would allow for the expeditious resolution of the \nparties’ disputes about the JRP. Third, we seek an order scheduling motions on the JRP, which \nwill include, at least, a motion by the plaintiffs to enforce the injunction and so-order JRP \nreforms. It would serve the interests of judicial economy to hold a status conference to determine \nand set out the best timing and sequence for these submissions, motions, and proceedings.   \nNotably, in light of the parties’ impasse about the requirements of the JRP, there is an increased \nneed for a transparent process around the determination of the JRP reforms – which are a critical \ncomponent of the injunction the plaintiff class secured. As the Second Circuit has opined, “[t]he \nnotion that the public should have access to the proceedings and documents of courts is integral \nto our system of government.” U.S. v. Erie County, 763 F.3d 235, 238-39 (2d Cir. 2014) (opining \nthat “it is essential that the people themselves have the ability to learn of [and] monitor . . . the \nactions of their representatives and their representative institutions.”). See also Newsday LLC v. \nCounty  of  Nassau,  730  F.3d  156,  164  (2d  Cir.  2013)  (discussing  First  Amendment  values \nunderpinning public court proceedings and the “need . . . for the public to have confidence in the \nadministration of justice”) (citation and quotation omitted). This high-profile remedial process is \nadministering reforms on behalf of three city-wide plaintiff classes to address a government \nentity’s widespread constitutional violations. More than a thousand people participated in the \nJRP with the expectation of designing reforms to NYPD discipline, monitoring, and supervision \npractices. Without a status conference and a scheduling order that requires a clear process for \nresolving the JRP reforms, we are concerned the legitimacy of and public confidence in the stop \nand frisk remedial process will be compromised.  \n4 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 309   Filed 01/29/18   Page 5 of 5",

City of New York, et al., 10-CV-0699 (AT) \nFloyd, et al. v. City of New York, 08-CV-1034 (AT) \nLigon, et al. v. City of New York, et al., 12-CV-2274 (AT) \n \nDear Judge Torres: \nCounsel for plaintiffs in the above-reference matters respectfully submit this letter \nto raise two issues with the Court. \nFirst, Floyd, Davis, and Ligon plaintiffs write with respect to the anticipated \nselection of a new Court-Appointed Monitor of the New York City Police Department \n(“NYPD”).  The tragic passing of the long-serving NYPD Monitor, Peter Zimroth—who \nwas at work on the remedial process even in his final days—leaves this monitorship at a \ncritical juncture to ensure the successful continuation of the remedial process.  The \nselection of a new monitor provides an opportunity to reinforce the significance of this \nprocess to New Yorkers, address some lingering concerns about community engagement \nand transparency, and ensure the success of these remedial efforts.  Indeed, the United \nStates Department of Justice recently identified “Public Input during Monitor Selection” \nas the first step to effectuate the core belief that “Monitors must be accountable to the \ncourt, the parties, and the public.”1  That is because “monitors hold a position of public \ntrust, not only as agents of the court, but also as drivers of significant change in public \ninstitutions that are central to the communities that they serve.  Monitorships thus must \n \n1 Associate Attorney General, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Memorandum for the \nAttorney General, Review of the Use of Monitors in Civil Settlement Agreements and \nConsent Decrees involving State and Local Governmental Entities (Aug. 13, 2021), at 5, \nhttps://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1432236/download, approved by Attorney General, \nU.S. Dep’t of Justice, Memorandum of Heads of Civil Litigating Components United \nStates Attorneys, Review of the Use of Monitors in Settlement Agreements and Consent \nDecrees involving State and Local Entities (Sept. 13, 2021), \nhttps://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1432236/download. \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 489   Filed 11/19/21   Page 2 of 5\n  Honorable Analisa Torres \nNovember 19, 2021 \nPage 2 \n \n \nbe structured to ensure that monitors are accountable for their work.”2  Accordingly, the \nDepartment recommends that the monitor selection process “include[] an opportunity for \npublic input”—“[s]pecifically, they should require that the selection of monitors be \ninformed by a public process, including a publicly-posted request for proposals, public \nposting of the applicants’ proposals, an opportunity for stakeholders to meet and ask \nquestions of the finalists for the monitor position, and a process for the public to provide \ninput to the parties and the court on the selection of the monitor.”3  The Department \nfurther states that a “more open and rigorous application and selection process will also \nensure a more diverse and representative sample of monitor candidates.”4 \nFloyd, Davis, and Ligon plaintiffs likewise maintain that a public and transparent \nselection process, which follows the spirit of the guidelines set forth by the Department \nof Justice after a thorough and comprehensive review of monitorships nationwide, is \ncrucial during this critical time of transition.  As one of the most high-profile police \nmonitorships in the country, law enforcement agencies across the nation will look to this \nmonitoring process as a possible guide in their own reform and accountability efforts.  \nMost importantly, the work of the NYPD monitorship has a deep and reverberating \nimpact on Black and Latinx communities throughout New York City—communities that \nhave rightly distrusted police and police reform for generations.  It is, therefore, \nimperative that the selection of the next NYPD Monitor be conducted openly and \nthoughtfully, under the watchful eye of the public, so that the person ultimately selected \nhas legitimacy and community support.  Such an open and deliberative selection process \nwould also bolster the Court’s own credibility and legitimacy before the public.  For \nthese reasons, plaintiffs oppose any selection process that is outside the purview of the \npublic and that does not allow appropriate time for consultation with key community \nstakeholders.  With the understanding that a public, deliberate, and transparent selection \nprocess will likely require some time to be conducted correctly, plaintiffs are committed \nto working collaboratively with the NYPD Deputy Monitor and the monitoring team, the \nCity Law Department, and the NYPD to continue the important work of this monitorship \nduring the interim period. \nSecond, Floyd and Davis plaintiffs further write with respect to our Motion to \nModify the Floyd Remedial Order (Floyd, Dkt #840; Davis, Dkt #578), which is \ncurrently pending before the Court.  As detailed in their supporting memoranda of law \n(Floyd, Dkt #841, #864; Davis, Dkt #579, #596), Floyd and Davis plaintiffs urge \nintervention of this Court to ensure the necessary engagement and involvement of \ndirectly impacted community members in the monitoring process.  This community \nengagement and involvement are essential to the success and legitimacy of the \nmonitorship because the Court will otherwise have inaccurate and one-sided information \n \n2 Id. \n3 Id. \n4 Id. \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 489   Filed 11/19/21   Page 3 of 5\n  Honorable Analisa Torres \nNovember 19, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \n \nabout the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk and trespass enforcement activities—which excludes \nthe perspectives, experiences, and expertise of those who have been most harmed by the \nNYPD’s constitutional violations—when assessing substantial compliance.  Thus, Floyd \nand Davis plaintiffs requested that the Court modify the Floyd remedial order to include \ncommunity surveys, a Community Collaborative Board, and field audits and integrity \ntesting.  Floyd and Davis plaintiffs further requested more proactive community \nengagement by the monitoring team and regular, public status conferences before the \nCourt to improve public transparency and legitimacy of the monitoring process. \nFloyd and Davis plaintiffs welcome the opportunity to work collaboratively with \nthe monitoring team and the City to resolve the pending motion, should they choose to do \nso.  However, it is imperative that any resolution include meaningful and concrete \ninvolvement of community stakeholders, especially those most directly harmed by the \nconstitutional violations at issue in these cases, in the Monitor’s—and ultimately the \nCourt’s—assessment of substantial compliance.  Without such assurances, Floyd and \nDavis plaintiffs maintain the need for modification of the Floyd Remedial Order and \nrespectfully request oral argument before the Court’s ruling of the pending motion. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n   /s/ Jin Hee Lee                        \nJin Hee Lee \nNAACP LEGAL DEFENSE & \nEDUCATIONAL FUND, INC. \n700 14th Street, NW, Suite 600 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n(202) 216-5579 \n \nRaymond Audain \nKevin Jason \nLauren Johnson \nAshok Chandran \nJohn Cusick \nNAACP LEGAL DEFENSE & \nEDUCATIONAL FUND, INC. \n40 Rector Street, 5th Floor \nNew York, NY  10006 \n(212) 965-2200 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 489   Filed 11/19/21   Page 4 of 5\n  Honorable Analisa Torres \nNovember 19, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \n \n   /s/ Corey Stoughton         \nCorey Stoughton \nSteven Wasserman \nMolly Griffard \nJennvine Wong \nTHE LEGAL AID SOCIETY \n199 Water Street \nNew York, NY 10038 \n(212) 577-3300 \n \nCounsel for Davis Plaintiffs \n \n   /s/ Jonathan C.

Shira: \nA. Scheindlin (hereafter \"the District Judge\") in order to address so much of the \norder of the Motion Panel herein, dated October 31, 2013, as directed the removal \nof the District Judge as presiding judge in David Floyd et al. v.  City ofN  ew York \n1 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 4      11/06/2013      1086018      17\n(13-3088), and Jaenean Ligon, et al. v.  City ofN  ew York et al. (13-3123) \n(corrected), and found that the District Judge \"ran afoul\" ofthe Code of Conduct \nfor United States Judges.  A copy of the Motion Panel's ruling is annexed hereto as \nExhibit 1. \nThis motion is brought pursuant to Rules 21(b)(4), 27, and 29 ofthe Federal \nRules of Appellate Procedure; 28l.J.S.C .§ 2106; 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (the All Writs \nAct); and the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. \nCounsel seek leave in the nature of an order under Rule 21 (b)( 4) of the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure governing mandamus proceedings providing \nfor appellate review of motions for judicial disqualification pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n455, authorizing counsel to appear on behalf of the District Judge in order to \naddress the factual and legal sufficiency of the Motion Panel's sua sponte order of \nremoval. \nThe undersigned are prepared to appear as counsel for Judge Scheindlin, or \nas amici curiae on her behalf, in accordance with the wishes of the court. \nIn support of the motion, counsel state: \n1.  The District Judge has served with distinction as a trial judge in the \nSouthern District of New York since November, 1994. \n2.  From March 18, 2013 to May 20, 2013, the District Judge presided over \nan extensive trial in David Floyd, et al. v.  City ofN  ew York (13-3088); \n2 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 5      11/06/2013      1086018      17\nchallenging the constitutionality of certain \"stop and frisk\" practices \nengaged in by the New York City Police Department (''NYPD\") that \nwere alleged to violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on \nunreasonable searches and seizures and the Fourteenth Amendment's \nguaranty of equal protection of the laws. \n3.  From October 15, 2012 to November 7, 2012, the District Judge presided \nover a hearing on a motion for preliminary injunction in Jaenean Ligon, \net al. v.  City ofN  ew York, et al. (13-3123) (corrected), seeking injunctive \nrelief against allegedly unlawful \"stop and frisk\" practices engaged in by \ntheNYPD. \n4.  At no point during the extensive trial in Floyd, the hearing on injunctive \nrelief in Ligon, or during the proceedings that preceded the hearings in \neither case, did any party seek the disqualification of the District Judge, \nby recusal or otherwise, or claim that she had violated any Canon of the \nCode of Conduct for United States Judges; nor did any party raise an \nobjection under Local Rule 13 Governing the Distribution of Business \nAmong District Judges.  A copy of Local Rule 13 is annexed hereto as \nExhibit 2. \n5.  On August 12, 2013, the District Judge issued a lengthy and detailed \nopinion holding that the \"stop and frisk\" practices before the Court \n3 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 6      11/06/2013      1086018      17\nviolated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution. \n6.  On August 12, 2013, the District Judge issued an order concerning \nremedies in connection with the NYPD's unconstitutional \"stop and \nfrisk\" practices. \n7.  New York City filed an appeal from the District Court's orders on \nAugust 16, 2013. On August 27, 2013, New York City moved in the \nDistrict Court for a stay by letter motion, which was denied by the \nDistrict Court on September 17, 2013. \n8.  At no point during the post-trial motion for a stay in the District Court \ndid any party seek the disqualification of the District Judge on any \ngrounds, or allege that she had \"run afoul\" of any Canon of the Code of \nConduct for United States Judges. \n9.  On October 29, 2013, New York City's application for a stay was argued \nbefore a motion panel of this Court, consisting ofHon. John M. Walker, \nJr., Hon. Jose Cabranes, and Hon. Barrington D. Parker, Jr. (hereafter \n\"the Motion Panel\"). \n10. At no point during the oral argument before the Motion Panel did any \nparty seek the disqualification of the District Judge, or allege that she had \n\"run afoul\" of a Canon of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. \n4 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 7      11/06/2013      1086018      17\nWhen one member of the Motion Panel (Judge Cabranes) sua sponte \nraised the District Court's colloquy with counsel concerning Local Rule \n13, and her interviews with the press, neither party responded with a \nsuggestion of disqualification, or an allegation that the Canons of the \nCode of Conduct for United States Judges had been breached. \n11. On October 31, 2013, the Motion Panel issued an order staying \nenforcement of the District Court's August 12, 2013 orders pending \nresolution ofNew York City's appeal on the merits. The Motion Panel \ndirected, in the name of judicial efficiency, that the appeal be heard by \nthe same three judges who constituted the Motion Panel, rather than by \nrandom assignment.  See Exhibit 1. \n12. In addition to the grant of a stay, the Motion Panel issued a sua sponte \norder directing the removal of the District Judge, purporting, without \naffording the District Judge notice or an opportunity to defend herself, to \nfind that the District Judge had \"run afoul\" of Canons 2 and 3(C)(l) of \nCode of Conduct for United States Judges.  A copy of the Code of \nConduct for United States Judges is annexed hereto as Exhibit 3. \n13. With respect, the undersigned counsel believe that the Motion Panel's \nsua sponte order of removal raises troubling issues warranting \n5 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 8      11/06/2013      1086018      17\nreconsideration by the Motion Panel, or in the alternative, en bane review \nby the full Circuit, on both substantive and procedural grounds. \nA. \nThe Motion Panel's Sua Sponte Order Was Procedurally Deficient \n14. The Motion Panel's sua sponte order directing removal of the District \nJudge for \"running afoul\" of Canons 2 and 3(C)(1) of the Code of \nConduct for United States Judges is the functional equivalent of a judicial \nfinding that the District Judge behaved improperly. \n15. Unlike United States v.  The City ofN  ew York, No. 11-5113-cv (May 14, \n2013), where the Circuit panel praised the District Judge, but remanded a \nportion of the case to a new judge to hold a bench trial because the trial \njudge's earlier negative characterization of the evidence might raise an \nappearance of a lack of neutrality, the Motion Panel's order of removal in \nthis case rested on allegations of judicial misbehavior. \n16. Rule 21  ofthe Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure carefully assures \nthat where a district judge is charged with conduct amounting to judicial \nmisbehavior, the judge will receive notice of the allegations pending \nbefore a Circuit court, and an opportunity to seek leave to be heard. \n17. In the vast bulk of cases, requests for the disqualification of a District \nJudge are raised by a motion to disqualify in the trial court pursuant to 28 \n6 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 9      11/06/2013      1086018      17\na \nU.S.C. §§ 455(a) and (b). Because denial of such a motion is not  final \norder, appellate review of an order denying a motion to disqualify is \navailable in every Circuit pursuant to Rule 21 F.R.App. Proc., and 28 \nU.S.C § 1651 (the All Writs Act).  See Hearings on Examining the State \nofJ udicial Recusal after Caperton v. A.T. Massey: Hearings before the \nSubcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy oft he H  Comm. on the \nJudiciary,  111 Cong. (2009). \n18. In connection with such a Rule 21 proceeding, Rule 21(b)(4) authorizes \na district judge to request permission from the Court of Appeals to \naddress the allegations contained in the mandamus petition; or, in the \nalternative, to request the Circuit to invite an amicus curiae to address \nlegal and factual issues posed by the application for a writ of mandamus. \n19. Counsel understand that the practice in this Circuit is to grant a district \njudge's request to be heard, either in person or through amicus cu,riae, \nprior to issuing an order: (a) removing the judge for alleged misbehavior \ncasting aspersions on the District Judge's judicial integrity; or (b) issuing \na writ of a mandamus directing the district judge to engage in other \nremedial conduct. See In re German and Austrian Banking Litigation, \n250 F .3d 156 (2d Cir. 2001) (authorizing the appointment of counsel to \nrepresent judge Shirley Kram in a Rule 21 mandamus proceeding); \n7 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 10      11/06/2013      1086018      17\nSecurities & Exchange Commission v.  Citigroup Global Markets, 11-\n5375 (authorizing the appointment of counsel to represent Judge Jed \nRakoff in mandamus proceeding involving actions pending before Judge \nRakoff pursuant to the related case doctrine). \n20. In this case, the Motion Panel circumvented the formal protections of \nRule 21 by acting sua sponte in the absence of a request for \ndisqualification from any of the parties.  This is particularly noteworthy \nin light of the parties' failure to request disqualification even after Judge \nCabranes' expressions of concern during oral argument. \n21. Where, as here, a Circuit panel engages in sua sponte action removing a \nDistrict Judge for alleged improper behavior \"running afoul\" of the Code \nof Conduct for United States Judges, the need for notice to the District \nJudge and an opportunity to be heard is even greater than in the ordinary \nRule 21 setting. Under Rule 21, the judge will ordinarily be on notice of \nthe charges against her. Indeed, she will have ordinarily denied a motion \nfor disqualification. \n22. Even in such a setting, Rule 21 contemplates notice to the judge and an \nopportunity to defend herself in the Circuit court. \n23. In this case, givert the sua sponte nature of the order of removal, and the \nfailure of any party to have sought disqualification, or asserted an alleged \n8 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 11      11/06/2013      1086018      17\nviolation of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, during the \nmore than five years that the Floyd case was before the District Court, the \nDistrict Judge was completely blind-sided by the Motion Panel's sua \nsponte order finding that her behavior had \"run afoul\" of the Code of \nConduct for United States Judges. \n24. In addition to Rule 21(b)(4), in analogous settings, the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure require notice and an opportunity to be heard before \na court takes adverse action.  See Rule 38 F. R. App. Proc. (providing for \nnotice and an opportunity to be heard before the imposition of appellate \nsanctions on a party). \n25. With .respect, the Motion Panel's failure to have provided the District \nJudge with notice and an opportunity to defend herself was not merely a \nbreach of the norms of collegiality and mutual respect that should \ncharacterize interactions between District and Circuit judges, it is an \naffront to the values underlying the Fifth Amendment's guaranty of \nprocedural due process of law. \n9 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 12      11/06/2013      1086018      17\nB. \nThe Motion Panel's Sua Sponte Order Summarily Removing \nthe District Judge Was Inaccurate and Substantively Unwarranted \n26. The failure to accord the District Judge notice and an opportunity to be \nheard resuited in a sua sponte order of removal premised on inaccurate \nand incorrect assumptions concerning the behavior of the District Judge. \n27. The Motion Panel found that the District Judge's colloquy with \nplaintiffs' counsel in Daniels v.  City ofN  ew York, No. 99 Civ. 1695 \n(S.D.N.Y. filed March 8, 1999) concerning \"the related case doctrine\" \nconstituted an \"improper application of the related case rule\" rising to the \nlevel of a violation of Canons 2 and 3(C)(1) ofthe Code of Conduct of \nUnited States Judges, and warranted her summary removal.  See \nExhibit 1. \n28. Unfortunately, the Motion Panel's inaccurate characterization of the \ncolloquy, as misreported in a newspaper article cited by the Motion \nPanel, provides a misleading impression of the District Court's behavior. \n29. The Motion Panel did not attach the text of the colloquy to its order.  A \ncopy of the full colloquy is annexed hereto as Exhibit 4. \n30. A fair reading of the actual colloquy could not lead a reasonable person \nin possession of all the facts to infer bias or lack of neutrality on the part \n10 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 13      11/06/2013      1086018      17\nofthe District Judge. See United States v. Jacobs, 955 F.2d 7, 10 (2d Cir. \n1992); United States v. Robin, 553 F.2d 8, 10 (2d Cir. 1977) (en bane). \n31. As a review of the text of the 42 page colloquy demonstrates, the \ndiscussion of Local Rule 13 dealing with the related case doctrine was in \nresponse to efforts by plaintiffs' counsel in Daniels to raise newly \ndiscovered evidence concerning the allegedly racially discriminatory \nnature of the NYPD's \"stop and frisk\" practices. \n32. The District Judge firmly rebuffed efforts to interpret the settlement \nagreement in Daniels broadly to permit consideration of newly \ndiscovered evidence concerning racially discriminatory \"stop and frisk\" \n. practices, noting that pursuing such a course would result in a waste of \nthe court's time and the parties' resources because the Daniels case had \nbeen settled in a manner that made it inappropriate to consider the newly \ndiscovered evidence. \n33. Instead, the District Court brought Local Rule 13 to the attention. of \ncounsel as an alternative that would achieve the desired result without \nwasting judicial resources. The District Judge's observation that she \nwould accept a new case that would enable consideration of the newly \ndiscovered evidence applied clearly established principles designed to \nachieve judicial economy. \n11 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 14      11/06/2013      1086018      17\n34. Such a colloquy concerning a judicially efficient means of dealing with \n) \nnewly discovered evidence is indistinguishable from suggestions \nroutinely made by district judges that pleadings be amended in order to \npermit the efficient consideration of additional issues relevant to the \nunderlying dispute. \n35. On remand after the Motion Panel's order of removal, counsel \nunderstand that both the Floyd and Ligon cases were assigned to the same \ntrial judge precisely because they clearly fall under Local Rule 13 as \nrelated cases. \n36. The District Court's recognition that judicial economy would be .served \nby the invocation of the related case doctrine codified in Local Rule 13 is \nanalogous to the decision of the Motion Panel to issue an order retaining \njurisdiction over the appeal herein in the name of judicial economy. \n37. The Motion Panel alleged, as well, that the District Judge had granted \nthree press interviews in a manner that called her neutrality into question. \n38. Once again, the Motion Panel failed to attach transcripts of the press \ninterviews to its ruling. A fair reading of the text of the three interviews, \nannexed hereto as Exhibits 5, 6, and 7, reveals that no reasonable person \ncould infer bias from the District Judge's responses. \n12 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 15      11/06/2013      1086018      17\n39. In each ofthe three instances of press questioning, the District Judge \nexplicitly refused to comment on legal issues raised in the pending \nlitigation, and confined her responses to general discussions of \nconstitutional law and explanations of the judicial process. \n40. In one interview, the District Judge refuted an allegation circulated in the \npress by unlmown persons that she had granted a disproportionate \nnumber of motions to suppress in criminal cases.  See Exhibit 7. \n41. The District Judge pointed out the methodological inadequacy of the so \ncalled study by noting that it dealt only with written opinions, ignoring \nthe massive number of oral denials of suppression motions that she had \nissued from the bench. \n42. Counsel understand that the Corporation Counsel of the City of New \nYork appeared personally in the District Judge's chambers to apologize \nfor the misleading assertion, and to disclaim responsibility for it. \n43. Discussion of important legal issues by members of the judiciary \nenriches the dialogue that is crucial to public understanding of the rule of \nlaw, and is consistent with the values underlying the First Amendment. \n44. Given our First Amendment tradition, the general discussion of legal \nissues engaged in by the District Judge in the press interviews cited by \nthe Motion Panel cannot be deemed to \"run afoul\" of any Canon of the \n13 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 16      11/06/2013      1086018      17\nCode of Conduct for United States Judges, and cannot justify a sua \nsponte order removing her as a Judge in these proceedings. \n45. Until the Motion Panel's sua sponte order directing removal, no party \nhad questioned the District Court's conduct, had sought disqualification, \nor had alleged a violation of the Code of Conduct for United States \nJudges. \n46. While sua sponte removal by an appellate court may be appropriate in a \ngenuinely egregious case where the parties are unable to raise the issues \nfreely, there is no basis for sua sponte appellate action in a setting where \npowerful litigants have declined to seek disqualification, even after the \njudicial conduct in question was critically described by a member of the \nMotion Panel during oral argument. \nWHEREFORE, the undersigned counsel request leave to appear either \nas counsel to the District Judge, or as amici curiae on her behalf, in order \nto address the legal and factual issues raised by the Motion Panel's sua \nsponte order directing her removal in David Floyd, et al. v.  City ofN  ew \nYork, and Jaenean Ligon et al. v.  City ofN  ew York,  et al. \nIf the court deems it appropriate on the existing record, including this \nmotion, counsel move, as well, that the order directing disqualification of \n14 \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 251-1     Page: 17      11/06/2013      1086018      17\nthe District Judge be vacated; or, in the alternative, be reviewed en bane \nby the judges of the Circuit. \nDated:  November 5, 2013 \nNew York, New York \nBurt Neubome \n(Lead Counsel of Record) \nNorman Dorsen \nArthur R.

SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.:\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThis case, filed in 2012, is one of three cases currently before this\nCourt challenging aspects of the New York City Police Department’s “stop and\nfrisk” practices.1  Of the three cases, this case is the most narrow.  It deals only\nwith stops made by the police on suspicion of trespass outside of certain privately-\nowned buildings in the Bronx.  But the legal issues raised by this case have roots\nthat stretch back decades.\nIn 1964, New York adopted the first version of its stop and frisk law,\nwhich has since been amended several times.  The essence of the law is that a\npolice officer may stop a person in a public place when he reasonably suspects that\nsuch person is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a crime, and the\n1 Floyd v. City of New York, filed in 2008, challenges the NYPD’s stop\nand frisk practices in general, arguing among other things that the NYPD is\nsystematically violating the rights of New York City’s residents and visitors under\nthe Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable searches, and under the\nFourteenth Amendment to be free from discrimination on the basis of race.  See\nFloyd v. City of New York, 283 F.R.D. 153, 159 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (granting class\ncertification).  Davis v. City of New York, filed in 2010, focuses on stop and frisk\npractices at public housing properties run by the New York City Housing\nAuthority (“NYCHA”).  Plaintiffs in Davis argue that the NYPD uses unlawful\nstops, searches, and arrests to enforce the prohibitions against trespassing on public\nhousing property.  See Davis v. City of New York, — F. Supp. 2d —, 2012 WL\n4813837, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2012) (granting in part and denying in part\ndefendants’ motions for summary judgment regarding individual plaintiffs’ arrests\nand tenancies).\n4\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 5 of 157\nofficer may demand of him his name, his address, and an explanation of his\nconduct.  Upon stopping a person, if the police officer reasonably suspects that he\nis in danger of physical injury, he may search the person for a deadly weapon.2  \nThis law and the policing practices associated with it have raised a\nhost of difficult questions, including:  (1) what is reasonable suspicion; (2) what\nconstitutes a stop; (3) what is a public place; (4) when is a stopped person free to\nwalk away from the police; and (5) when does an officer have grounds to\nreasonably suspect that he is danger of physical injury.  None of these questions\nare easily answered.\nIn 1968, the United States Supreme Court heard a challenge to New\nYork’s stop and frisk statute in the context of two criminal convictions, and made\nsome important points that bear repeating today.3  First, the Court held that\nalthough states may develop their own laws on stop and frisk, they may not\n“authorize police conduct which trenches upon Fourth Amendment rights,\nregardless of the labels which it attaches to such conduct.”4  The Court stated, in no\n2 See generally New York Criminal Procedure Law (“CPL”) § 140.50.\n3 See generally Sibron v. State of New York, 392 U.S. 40 (1968)\n(reversing conviction for failure to suppress evidence seized in an unlawful stop,\nand affirming conviction in a related appeal, finding that the seizure in latter case\nwas reasonable under the Fourth Amendment).\n4 Id. at 61.\n5\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 6 of 157\nuncertain terms, that the question is not whether a particular search was authorized\nby state law but “‘whether the search was reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.’”5  Second, the Court held that it would not judge the constitutionality\nof the New York statute on its face, but rather as applied to the particular facts of\nthe two cases it was reviewing.6  Third, the Court stressed that a police officer must\nhave reasonable grounds before he seizes a person.  In that regard the Court stated: \n“The police officer is not entitled to seize and search every person whom he sees\non the street or of whom he makes inquiries.”7\nIn confronting the issues addressed in this Opinion, I am keenly aware\nthat this Court does not stand in the shoes of the Police Department and is in no\nway qualified or empowered to engage in policy determinations.  The sole role of\nthe Court is to interpret and apply the law — in this case the Fourth Amendment of\nthe United States Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit — to the\n5 Id. (quoting Cooper v. State of California, 386 U.S. 58, 61 (1967)).\n6 See id. (“Our constitutional inquiry would not be furthered here by an\nattempt to pronounce judgment on the words of the statute.  We must confine our\nreview instead to the reasonableness of the searches and seizures which underlie\nthese two convictions.”).\n7 Id.  The Court continued:  “Before he places a hand on the person of a\ncitizen in search of anything, he must have constitutionally adequate, reasonable\ngrounds for doing so.”  Id.\n6\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 7 of 157\nspecific facts before it.  I have endeavored faithfully to carry out that limited role. \nMy object here is only to clarify what the law permits — and does not permit — an\nofficer to do when initiating and conducting a stop or stop and frisk of people in\nthe public areas outside of certain privately owned buildings in the Bronx.  \nPlaintiffs, all of whom are African-American or Latino residents of\nNew York,8 argue that the Police Department has a widespread practice of making\nunlawful stops on suspicion of trespass outside buildings in the Bronx that are\nenrolled in the Trespass Affidavit Program (“TAP”), which was formerly known in\nthe Bronx as Operation Clean Halls.9  This program allows “police officers to\npatrol inside and around thousands of private residential apartment buildings\nthroughout New York City.”10  Plaintiffs argue that the NYPD’s trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings are often made without reasonable suspicion, and thus\n8 See Complaint ¶¶ 11–23.\n9 See Ligon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. 2274, 2012 WL 3597066,\nat *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2012) (allowing preliminary injunction hearing to\nproceed).  For the history of TAP, see infra Part IV.B.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint\nconcerns stops in and around TAP buildings throughout New York City, but\nplaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction focuses solely on outside stops in the\nBronx.  See Ligon, 2012 WL 3597066, at *3–4; Memorandum of Law in Support\nof Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (“Class Mem.”) at 1 n.1.\n10 See Ligon, 2012 WL 3597066, at *1.\n7\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 8 of 157\nviolate the Fourth Amendment.11  Plaintiffs stated that such stops have caused them\nto feel “violated,”12 “disrespected,”13 “angry,”14 and “defenseless.”15  As the\nSupreme Court noted in Terry v. Ohio, even limited stops and searches represent\n“an annoying, frightening, and perhaps humiliating experience,”16 and thus must be\nbased on reasonable suspicion.\nOn September 24, 2012, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary\ninjunction, seeking an order requiring the NYPD to create and implement new\npolicies, training programs, and monitoring and supervisory procedures that\nspecifically address the problem of unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP\nbuildings.17  The preliminary injunction hearing took place between October 15\nand November 7, 2012.18  This Opinion addresses plaintiffs’ motion.\n11 See Plaintiffs’ Revised Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of\nLaw (“Pl. Findings”) ¶¶ 64–67, 69–70.\n12 Transcript of Preliminary Injunction Hearing (“Tr.”) 10/16 at 275:8.\n13 Id. at 349:1.\n14 Tr. 10/17 at 444:2.\n15 Id. at 486:1.\n16 392 U.S. 1, 25 (1968).\n17 See Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for\nPreliminary Injunction at 21; Pl.

Based on all the evidence presented at the\nhearing, I conclude that plaintiffs have shown a clear likelihood of proving that\ndefendants have displayed deliberate indifference toward a widespread practice of\nunconstitutional trespass stops by the NYPD outside TAP buildings in the Bronx. \nThis conclusion is based on five categories of evidence, briefly summarized here\nand fully explored below:  (1) the testimony of Bronx Assistant District Attorney\nJeannette Rucker (“ADA Rucker”), who concluded that the NYPD frequently\nmade trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx for no reason other than\nthat the officer had seen someone enter and exit or exit the building; (2) a sample\nof “decline to prosecute” forms prepared by the Bronx District Attorneys’ Office,\nwhich revealed the alarming frequency of unlawful trespass stops in the vicinity of\nTAP buildings in the Bronx; (3) the testimony of eight plaintiffs and a non-party\nwitness, who described remarkably similar encounters with the police when\nstopped in the vicinity of TAP buildings in the Bronx; (4) the analysis by Dr.\nJeffrey Fagan, plaintiffs’ expert, of an NYPD database of recorded stops, which\nprovided further evidence of the frequency of apparently unlawful trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings in the Bronx; and (5) NYPD training materials that continue\nto misstate the minimal constitutional standards for making stops.\n9\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 10 of 157\nIn sum, while it may be difficult to say where, precisely, to draw the\nline between constitutional and unconstitutional police encounters, such a line\nexists, and the NYPD has systematically crossed it when making trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings in the Bronx.  For those of us who do not fear being stopped\nas we approach or leave our own homes or those of our friends and families, it is\ndifficult to believe that residents of one of our boroughs live under such a threat.19 \nIn light of the evidence presented at the hearing, however, I am compelled to\nconclude that this is the case.\nAs a result, plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction. \nHowever, with one exception, I am not yet ordering relief pending a further\nhearing on the appropriate scope of such relief.\nII. LEGAL STANDARD FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\n“‘A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded\nas of right.’”20  In general, to obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party\nmust establish:  (1) “that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits,” (2) “that [it] is\n19 To echo language quoted by Justice Thurgood Marshall, the evidence\nin this case “has evoked images of other days, under other flags, when no man\ntraveled . . . without fear of unwarranted interruption.”  Bostick, 501 U.S. at 443\n(Marshall, J., dissenting) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n20 UBS Fin. Servs., Inc. v. West Virginia Univ. Hosps., Inc., 660 F.3d\n643, 648 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555\nU.S. 7, 24 (2008)).\n10\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 11 of 157\nlikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,” (3) “that the\nbalance of equities tips in [its] favor,” and (4) “that an injunction is in the public\ninterest.”21  The Second Circuit has held that the moving party may be entitled to a\npreliminary injunction even if the party is unable to establish a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits, provided that the party demonstrates “‘a serious question\ngoing to the merits to make them a fair ground for trial, with a balance of hardships\ntipping decidedly in the plaintiff’s favor.’”22  In addition, when the moving party\nseeks a “mandatory” injunction, that is, an injunction that commands action rather\nthan merely prohibiting it, the standard is higher:  “[W]here ‘the injunction sought\nwill alter rather than maintain the status quo,’ the movant must show [a] ‘clear’ or\n21 Winter, 555 U.S. at 20 (citing Munaf v.

City of New York, 615 F.3d 152,\n156 (2d Cir. 2010)).  Accord Pamlab, L.L.C. v. Macoven Pharm., L.L.C., — F.\nSupp. 2d —, 2012 WL 2540234, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2012) (recognizing that\nthe Supreme Court in Winter “cast some doubt on the continuing viability” of the\nSecond Circuit’s “serious questions” prong, but noting that “the Second Circuit has\nsince held that ‘our venerable standard for assessing a movant’s probability of\nsuccess on the merits remains valid’” (quoting Citigroup Global Mkts., Inc. v. VCG\nSpecial Opportunities Master Fund Ltd., 598 F.3d 30, 38 (2d Cir. 2010))).\n11\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 12 of 157\n‘substantial’ likelihood of success.”23 \nBecause plaintiffs seek mandatory injunctive relief including the\ndrafting and distribution of new policies, the development and implementation of\nnew training programs, and the implementation of new monitoring and supervision\nprocedures,24 they must establish a clear or substantial likelihood that they will\nsucceed at trial.\nIII. APPLICABLE LAW\nA. Sources of Liability\nPlaintiffs bring a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging violations of\ntheir Fourth Amendment rights by the City of New York and several of its\nemployees.25  As the Supreme Court established in Monell v. New York City\n23 Rodriguez v. DeBuono, 175 F.3d 227, 233 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting\nJolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 473–74 (2d Cir. 1996)).  The Second Circuit has\nrecognized that “[t]he distinction between mandatory and prohibitory injunctions is\nnot without ambiguities or critics, and that in a close case an injunction can be\nframed in mandatory or prohibitory terms.”  Jolly, 76 F.3d at 474 (quotation marks\nand citations omitted).\n24 See Pl. Findings ¶¶ 72–75.\n25 See Compl. ¶¶ 1, 203.  42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides:\nEvery  person  who,  under  color  of  any  statute,  ordinance,\nregulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . subjects, or causes\nto be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person\nwithin the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,\nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,\n12\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 13 of 157\nDepartment of Social Services,26 in order to have recourse against a municipality or\nother local government under section 1983, plaintiffs “must prove that ‘action\npursuant to official municipal policy’ caused the alleged constitutional injury.”27 \nIn general, “[o]fficial municipal policy includes the decisions of a government’s\nlawmakers, the acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so persistent and\nwidespread as to practically have the force of law.”28\nOne way to establish an official policy is through a showing of\n“deliberate indifference” by high-level officials.  “‘[W]here a policymaking official\nexhibits deliberate indifference to constitutional deprivations caused by\nsubordinates, such that the official’s inaction constitutes a deliberate choice, that\nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in\nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . .\n26 436 U.S. 658 (1978).  Interpreting the language of section 1983 and\nthe legislative history surrounding its passage in the Civil Rights Act of 1871, the\nCourt in Monell held that local governing bodies could be held liable either on the\nbasis of formally approved policy or on the basis of “‘customs’” or “‘usages.’”  Id.\nat 690–91 (quoting Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 167–68 (1970)). \nLater cases have “considerably broadened the concept of official municipal\naction.”  Amnesty Am. v. Town of W.

Criminal Trespass under New York State Law\nCriminal trespass is defined under section 140 of the New York Penal\nLaw.  As the Appellate Division, First Department, of the Supreme Court of New\nYork recently stated in a case concerning alleged trespass in a Clean Halls\nbuilding:\nA person is guilty of criminal trespass in the second degree\nwhen,  in  pertinent  part,  he  “knowingly  enters  or  remains\nunlawfully in a dwelling” (Penal Law § 140.15[1]).  A person\n“enters or remains unlawfully” in or upon premises “when he is\nnot licensed or privileged to do so” (Penal Law § 140.00[5]).  “In\ngeneral,  a  person  is  ‘licensed  or  privileged’  to  enter  private\npremises  when  he  has  obtained  the  consent  of  the  owner  or\nanother whose relationship to the premises gives him authority to\nissue such consent” (People v. Graves, 76 N.Y.2d 16, 20 . . .\n[1990]).  The prosecution bears the burden of proving the absence\nof such license or privilege (People v. Brown, 25 N.Y.2d 374, 377\n. . . [1969]).53\nThe trespass law also states:\nA person who, regardless of his intent, enters or remains in or\nupon premises which are at the time open to the public does so\nwith license and privilege unless he defies a lawful order not to\nenter or remain, personally communicated to him by the owner of\nsuch premises or other authorized person. A license or privilege\nto enter or remain in a building which is only partly open to the\npublic is not a license or privilege to enter or remain in that part\n52 See Terry, 392 U.S. at 16–20.\n53 In re Lonique M., 939 N.Y.S.2d 341, 343 (1st Dep’t 2012).\n20\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 21 of 157\nof the building which is not open to the public.54\nD. De Bour\nIn People v. De Bour, the New York Court of Appeals established a\nfour-level test for determining the legality of encounters between police officers\nand civilians under New York state law.  The more intrusive the encounter, the\nmore justification required:\n• Level 1:  Approach to Request Information:  “If a police officer\nseeks  simply  to  request  information  from  an  individual,  that\nrequest must be supported by an objective, credible reason, not\nnecessarily indicative of criminality.”55  \n• Level 2:  The Common-Law Right of Inquiry:  “Once the officer\nasks  more  pointed  questions  that  would  lead  the  person\napproached reasonably to believe that he or she is suspected of\nsome wrongdoing and is the focus of the officer’s investigation,\nthe officer is [engaged in] a common-law inquiry that must be\nsupported by a founded suspicion that criminality is afoot.”56 \n• Level 3:  Forcible Stop:  “Where a police officer has reasonable\nsuspicion that a particular person was involved in a felony or\nmisdemeanor, the officer is authorized to forcibly stop and detain\nthat person.”57  A Level 3 stop is legally equivalent to a Terry\n54 N.Y.

FINDINGS OF FACT\nA. Evidence of an Unconstitutional Practice or Custom of the NYPD\nAt the hearing, plaintiffs offered three categories of evidence in\nsupport of their contention that the NYPD has a practice of making\nunconstitutional trespass stops outside Clean Halls buildings in the Bronx.  First,\nplaintiffs offered the testimony of ADA Rucker regarding her concerns about\ntrespass stops and arrests at Clean Halls buildings, corroborated by “decline to\nprosecute” forms from the Bronx District Attorney’s office.  Second, plaintiffs\noffered testimony regarding their personal experiences of having been stopped\noutside Clean Halls buildings.63  Third, plaintiffs offered the expert testimony of\nAdam Carlis, The Illegality of Vertical Patrols, 109 COLUM. L. REV. 2002 (2009)). \n62 See, e.g., People v. Kojac, 671 N.Y.S.2d 949, 953–54 (Sup. Ct. N.Y.\nCo. 1998) (“The police are not justified in approaching an individual merely\nbecause he exits [a TAP building] known for its high incidence of drug activity.”). \nSee also People v. Almonte, No. 0209/2009, 2011 WL 864940, at *2 (Sup. Ct.\nBronx Co. Mar. 8, 2011) (suggesting that decisions upholding Level 1 questioning\nof individuals exiting TAP buildings have “noted some additional factor” other\nthan location, such as defendant’s conduct not being innocuous).\n63 Plaintiffs introduced testimony regarding eleven stops.  See infra Part\nIV.A.2.  All of the stops were of named plaintiffs except the July 2011 stop of non-\nparty witness Jerome Grant, a relative of two named plaintiffs.  See infra Part\nIV.A.2.d.  For convenience, when making general statements about the personal\n23\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 24 of 157\nDr. Jeffrey Fagan regarding the number and nature of trespass stops outside Clean\nHalls buildings.\nI address each of these categories of evidence in turn.\n1. Findings of Fact Regarding Testimony of ADA Rucker and\nDecline to Prosecute Forms\nSince 2007, ADA Rucker has been chief of the complaint and\narraignments bureau at the Bronx DA.  In this position, she oversees the arrest to\narraignment process, ensuring “that we evaluate all cases that are coming through\nand making sure we are doing the right thing.”  ADA Rucker testified that around\n2007 she started to become concerned about cases in which people were being\nstopped and then arrested based solely on their having entered or exited a Clean\nHalls building.  Especially in 2009, judges began dismissing these cases\nfrequently, sometimes saying that the police had no right to approach the arrested\nperson in the first place.64  \nADA Rucker also started to receive a steady stream of complaints\nabout trespass arrests from the defense bar, the Legal Aid Society, and the Bronx\ntestimony of stops offered at the hearing, I will often refer to named plaintiffs and\nnon-party witness Jerome Grant collectively as “plaintiffs.”\n64 See Tr. 10/15 at 168–75.\n24\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 25 of 157\nDefenders.65  At first, she ignored the complaints.  But in 2010, her staff began\ntelling her that judges were not only dismissing trespass cases, but were finding\nevidence that the defendant lived in the building where the trespass was said to\nhave occurred.66  \nFinally, in 2011, ADA Rucker investigated the law governing trespass\nstops based on entry to and exit from a Clean Halls building, and she determined\nthat the office’s position on the prerequisites for a legal stop had been wrong.67 \nShe sent memos to a number of commanders and other police officials clarifying\nthat, contrary to previous statements, observing someone exiting a Clean Halls\nbuilding is not by itself a sufficient justification for a stop.68  ADA Rucker testified\nthat she sent the memos in her official capacity, and that the memos expressed the\nviews of the Bronx DA’s office.69 \n65 See id. at 175:20–22.  The Bronx Defenders are co-counsel for\nplaintiffs in this case.\n66 See id. at 175:21–25, 176:2–8.\n67 See id. at 176:9–23.\n68 See id. at 176:14–177:22, 180:19–181:21; 7/7/11 Letter from ADA\nRucker to Deputy Inspector William McSorley (“7/7/11 Rucker Letter”), Plaintiffs’\nExhibit (“Pl.

It is no small matter when\nan ADA publicly suggests that the NYPD has been engaged in a recurring pattern\nof unlawful stops.  Such testimony is entitled to significant weight.  A prosecutor\nhas professional and institutional incentives to be skeptical of allegations that the\npolice are making stops and arrests without a legal basis.   That ADA Rucker\novercame her skepticism says a great deal about the severity of the problem she\ncame to recognize.  I also note that the NYPD itself found ADA Rucker\nsufficiently trustworthy to allow her to train police officers regarding procedures in\nthe complaint room.70\nYet defendants argue that ADA Rucker’s impression that a problem\nexisted regarding unlawful trespass stops at Clean Halls buildings was unfounded,\nand in fact rested only on the two specific cases she discussed in detail at the\nhearing.71  Defendants’ argument is without merit.  ADA Rucker made clear that\n70 See id. at 170:12–173:17.  Throughout this opinion, for convenience, I\nwill refer to NYPD trainees as “officers,” though in some cases the training\ninvolves “recruits.”  See Tr. 10/19 at 839:18–24.\n71 See Defendants’ Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n(“Def. Findings”) ¶¶ 11–14.  One case involved an anonymous letter whose author\nclaimed to have been arrested for trespass while leaving a friend’s building with\nthe friend.

The other involved a stop inside a\nClean Halls building, and was brought to ADA Rucker’s attention by the Bronx\nDefenders.  See Tr. 10/15 at 196:13–198:15; Tr. 10/16 at 241:5–243:2.  In the latter\ncase, according to ADA David Grigoryan, who performed an investigation at ADA\n26\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 27 of 157\nover the years she learned of “many” cases involving unlawful trespass stops at\nClean Halls buildings,72 that “the judges kept dismissing” them,73 that “[a]t least\nfive” judges had dismissed Clean Halls trespass cases based on lack of probable\ncause,74 and that her concerns were also based on complaints from other ADAs,\nphone calls from the arraignment parts, and ADAs coming to her after leaving\ncourt, or when sent to her by their supervisors.75  ADA Rucker explicitly stated on\ncross-examination that her concerns were not based only on the anonymous letter\nRucker’s request, the defendant was stopped and questioned for no specified\nreason at his sister’s building, where he was apparently staying, and then the\ndefendant was arrested because he failed to provide his sister’s name or apartment\nnumber.

The defendants stated they were there\nto visit a tenant in the building.

As will be discussed in greater detail below, these arrests\nindependently suggest a widespread practice of unlawful stops.87\nIn sum, ADA Rucker’s testimony and the supporting exhibits,\nincluding the decline to prosecute forms, contained more than enough evidence to\nsupport the conclusion that there is a clear and substantial likelihood that plaintiffs\nwill be able to prove at trial that NYPD officers in the Bronx repeatedly stopped\nand questioned people on suspicion of trespass simply because they were observed\nexiting or entering and exiting a Clean Halls building.  ADA Rucker’s testimony\nand the supporting exhibits show that a nexus existed between the Clean Halls\nprogram and the kinds of unlawful trespass stops described by plaintiffs and\nquantified by Dr. Fagan, as discussed in the sections below.  That is, the stops of\npeople exiting or entering and exiting Clean Halls buildings took place because the\nbuildings were enrolled in Operation Clean Halls.\n86 Some of the forms describe stops in which an officer eventually\nobtained probable cause for an arrest.  See, e.g., App. A ¶ 23.  But the instant case\nconcerns the legal basis for stops, not arrests.\n87 See infra Part V.B.1.a.\n31\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 32 of 157\n2. Findings of Fact Regarding Plaintiffs’ Stops\nPlaintiffs offered testimony at the preliminary injunction hearing\nregarding their experiences in having been stopped on suspicion of trespass outside\nClean Halls buildings in the Bronx.  Sometimes plaintiffs’ accounts were\ncorroborated by other plaintiffs and witnesses.  In a few cases, the parties were able\nto identify officers who took part in the stops, and these officers testified.  In other\ncases, neither plaintiffs nor defendants were able to identify the officers.\nDefendants argue that plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient\ninformation to identify the John Doe officers in the case, and that as a result this\nCourt should not credit plaintiffs’ testimony.88  Defendants go so far as to suggest\nthat the stops about which plaintiffs testified “may not have occurred at all.”89 \nBased on the testimony described below, I reject this contention.  Perhaps the\nstrongest sign of the credibility of plaintiffs’ testimony is the striking similarities\namong plaintiffs’ stops.  A person approaches or exits a Clean Halls building in the\nBronx; the police suddenly materialize, stop the person, demand identification, and\nquestion the person about where he or she is coming from and what he or she is\ndoing; attempts at explanation are met with hostility; especially if the person is a\n88 See Tr. 11/7 at 1298:19–22 (defendants’ summation).\n89 Def.

The officers were never identified.  I find that this was due in part\nto the lack of specificity in some of plaintiffs’ memories of their encounters.  At\nthe same time, I also find that defendants made inadequate efforts to identify\nofficers based on the information plaintiffs did provide.\nDefendants claim that Sgt. Robert Musick of the NYPD’s Special\nLitigation Support Unit “conducted an exhaustive search to determine the officers\ninvolved in the purported incidents presented by plaintiffs at the hearing.”90  Sgt.\nMusick’s reference to his “limited attempts” to identify the officers is closer to the\nmark.91  A large part of Sgt. Musick’s investigation involved searches of the\n90 Id. (emphasis added).

Musick conceded that he is “definitely not an\nexpert” at using the database.93  For example, he was only able to narrow down the\npotential list of officers who might have stopped Jerome Grant in the summer of\n2011 (discussed below) to a list of three hundred.  Yet this list included officers of\nall ethnicities, while Grant had testified that one of the two officers was Asian.  On\ncross-examination, Sgt. Musick explained that he had not searched for Asian\nofficers within the list of three hundred because Grant’s description of the other\nofficer did not specify an ethnicity.94  This makes no more sense than refusing to\nsearch a drawer for a pair of striped socks because one cannot remember which\ncolor shoes they match:  there was no reason to make the search for the Asian\nofficer contingent on obtaining more information about his partner.

Charles Bradley’s Stop\nOn May 3, 2011, after finishing his work for the day as a security\nguard, Charles Bradley, a black fifty-one year old resident of the Bronx, took the\nsubway to visit his fiancée, Lisa Michelle Rappa, as they had arranged the evening\nbefore.96  Rappa lived in the Bronx at 1527 Taylor Avenue.97  Bradley formerly\nlived with Rappa and had keys to her apartment, but following a disagreement\nBradley had returned his keys.98  1527 Taylor Avenue is a Clean Halls building.99\n95 See id. at 1125–1143. \n96 See Tr. 10/16 at 257:17–258:22, 259:10–19, 261:1–24, 272:6.\n97 See id. at 258:23–24, 259:23.\n98 See Tr. 10/15 at 258:23–260:21.\n99 See Tr. 10/16 at 260:3–7.\n35\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 36 of 157\nWhen Bradley arrived at Rappa’s apartment building, a young man\nwho lived on the first floor and knew of Bradley’s and Rappa’s relationship let\nBradley into the building.  Bradley then walked up the stairs to Rappa’s apartment\non the fifth floor and knocked.  Because Rappa is deaf in one ear, Bradley waited a\nminute or two.  When there was still no response, he returned downstairs and left\nthe building.  Outside, he looked up toward Rappa’s window.100\nWhile Bradley was standing on the sidewalk, an unmarked green\npolice van approached and an officer in the passenger seat — later identified as\nOfficer Miguel Santiago — gestured for Bradley to come over.101  After Bradley\napproached the van, the officer got out and asked, “What are you doing here?”102 \nBradley explained he was there to see Rappa, and that he worked as a security\nguard.  Bradley testified that the officer responded to his attempts to explain his\npresence by suggesting Bradley was acting “like a fucking animal,”103 searched\nBradley’s pockets,104 then told Bradley to place his hands behind his back.

While the van drove away, the officers began to question Bradley: \n“When was the last time you saw a gun? When was the last time you got high?\nWhen was the last time you bought some drugs?”105\nAfter twenty or thirty minutes in the van, the officers stopped at the\nstation house.  Bradley was taken into a room, stripped, and told to wait.106  He was\nsearched in “inappropriate areas.”107  For the next two hours, he waited in a cell\nwith other people who had been arrested.  He was then fingerprinted and given a\n[W]here a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads\nhim reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal\nactivity  may  be  afoot  and  that  the  persons  with  whom  he  is\ndealing may be armed and presently dangerous; . . . he is entitled\nfor the protection of himself and others in the area to conduct a\ncarefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an\nattempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him.\nTerry, 392 U.S. at 30 (emphasis added).

Defendants suggest that it is\nimplausible that Turner did not go inside the building, because he knew that the\ndoor was unlocked.  See Def. Findings ¶ 23 & n.11; Tr. 10/17 at 476:7–10.  But\nTurner testified that he liked the cold and did not need a coat.  See Tr. 10/17 at\n477:2–4.  Accord id. at 487:20–21, 502:5–19.  While Turner’s winter-weather\nclothing choices and apparent tolerance for the cold may be idiosyncratic, they do\nnot undermine his credibility.  There is also a facial inconsistency in defendants’\napparent attempt to suggest both that any reasonable person in Turner’s\ncircumstances would have entered the building to warm up, and that if Turner did\nso, he would have provided legal grounds for a Terry stop.  A reasonable person\nwould presumably want to avoid being stopped and frisked, and thus would prefer\nstanding in the cold to going inside, if doing so would create a reasonable\nsuspicion of criminal trespass.\n129 Tr. 10/17 at 477:8.

The officer asked for identification, and Turner\ngave him his driver’s license.  After the officer saw that Turner did not live on the\nblock, he asked again what Turner was doing at 2020 Davidson, and Turner\nexplained again.133  Then the officer asked:  “So you don’t know anybody who\nlives in this building?”134  When Turner said no, the officer asked him to stand\nagainst the wall.135\nWhile Turner stood against the wall, the Hispanic officer entered 2020\nDavidson with Turner’s driver’s license and cell phone still in his possession. \nOfficer Ramdeen, now alone with Turner, continued asking Turner the same\n132 See id. at 1059:11–1061:6; Page from Memobook of Officer Michael\nPomerantz, Def.

Eventually, Trinidad emerged from the building, no longer\ncarrying the plastic bag, and Turner pointed to her as proof of what he had been\nsaying.  Trinidad confirmed Turner’s story while the other officers returned.  The\nHispanic officer asked for Trinidad’s ID, and Trinidad gave it to him.136  Then the\nofficer asked her if she had “anything on her that she shouldn’t have,” and in\nresponse, Trinidad said she had “a little pocketknife that her husband gave her for\nprotection and a bag of marijuana.”137 \nAfter confiscating these items, the Hispanic officer approached Turner\nand pointed to a sign on 2020 Davidson and asked him if he knew what the sign\nmeant.  Turner said he did not.  The sign stated that 2020 Davidson was enrolled in\nOperation Clean Halls.  The officer told Turner that he was trespassing and was\ngoing to jail.  Turner asked how he could be trespassing if he was outside.  The\nofficer repeated that Turner was going to jail and placed him in handcuffs.138\nAfter being driven to the precinct in a paddy wagon, Turner spent\nseveral hours waiting, was fingerprinted, and then was transferred to central\nbooking, where he spent several more hours.

He was then obligated to return to court eight to ten times\nbefore the charges were dismissed.139  Turner testified that the events on March 26\nmade him feel “defenseless.”140  Trinidad’s testimony at the hearing supported\nTurner’s account of the stop.141  \nOfficer Ramdeen testified to a different version of events.  He testified\nthat he and Officer Pomerantz were driving past 2020 Davidson when he saw\nTurner in the lobby.  Officer Pomerantz stopped the car and Officer Ramdeen\nwatched as Turner paced aimlessly in the lobby for two to three minutes,\noccasionally looking up the stairs.  Aware that 2020 Davidson was a Clean Halls\nbuilding, Officer Ramdeen approached Turner, who then exited the lobby.  In\nresponse to Officer Ramdeen’s brief questioning, Turner volunteered that his\n139 See id. at 482:21–483:10, 483:14–21.\n140 Id. at 486:1.

She went upstairs to buy weed.”143  Officer\nRamdeen did not record this alleged confession in his arrest report.144\nOfficer Ramdeen then arrested Turner for trespassing, basing “the\ncharges on the fact that he had no lawful reason to be in the building and that he\nknowingly was there to buy marijuana.”145  Officer Ramdeen could not recall\nhaving arrested Trinidad.  He conceded that neither he nor Officer Pomerantz took\nany steps to investigate or arrest the drug dealer who, according to their version of\nevents, was operating that night a few stories above them at 2020 Davidson.146\n142 See Tr. 10/22 at 1016:17–1017:14, 1020:11–1021:25.\n143 Id. at 1021:21–24.\n144 Officer Ramdeen’s arrest report only states that Turner was inside a\nClean Halls building without permission or authority to be there.

Turner stopped briefly at\n2020 Davidson so that Trinidad could allegedly return a sweater.  While Trinidad\nwent inside, Turner talked on his cell phone outside for a few minutes.  Officers\nRamdeen, Pomerantz, and likely Montanez saw him standing outside the building\nin the cold, stopped him, and questioned him.  Turner’s responses to the officers’\nquestions were reasonable and unsuspicious.  Turner provided no other grounds for\nsuspicion.  I did not find credible Officer Ramdeen’s testimony concerning\nTurner’s spontaneous confession.  Turner persuasively denied that he made the\nconfession,147 and the officers took no steps to investigate or stop the drug dealer\nwho (according to Officer Ramdeen’s testimony) was operating several floors\nabove them.   I also did not find credible Officer Ramdeen’s testimony concerning\nhis observation of Turner’s suspicious pacing inside the building before the\nofficers approached.  Based on the totality of the evidence presented at the hearing,\nI do not believe that Turner entered the building.148\n147 See Tr. 10/17 at 500:12–23.\n148 I note, however, that even if Turner entered the building, paced in the\nlobby, looked up the stairs, and then exited the building to make his call, a stop\nwould still have been unjustified.  This behavior is innocuous and would not,\nwithout something more, provide reasonable suspicion of criminal trespass, or of\nany other crime.  As in Bradley’s and Roshea Johnson’s cases, entering and exiting\na Clean Halls building under ordinary circumstances does not establish reasonable\nsuspicion.  See infra Part V.B.1.a.\n47\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 48 of 157\nFinally, Turner credibly testified to having been stopped on another\nnight during December 2011 or January 2012 outside of his own building, 2249\nMorris Avenue, which is also a Clean Halls building in the Bronx.  As Turner was\nexiting the building, a police car pulled up.  Turner’s thirteen-year-old brother, a\nfriend, and the friend’s nephew were talking at the front of the courtyard.  When\nTurner began to step out of the courtyard, a female officer got out of the car and\nasked whether they all lived in the building, and they all responded yes.  Then the\nofficer asked for Turner’s identification, and he gave it to her.149  Finally, the\nofficer “told us that we can’t stand in front of our building, so when they come\nback we would need to be gone.”150  Turner testified that he did not feel free to\nleave while the officer talked to him:  “[S]he had my ID, and I don’t know anyone\n. . . who ever just walked away from a cop in the middle of a conversation.”151  In\nthis encounter as well, I find that Turner’s behavior provided no grounds for\nsuspicion of trespass or any other crime.\nAs to whether Turner’s second stop was based on the suspicion of\n149 See Tr. 10/17 at 486:9–490:25.\n150 Id. at 491:4–5.\n151 Id. at 491:6–8, 22–23.\n48\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 49 of 157\ntrespass, the evidence is less clear.152  Nevertheless, because I found Turner’s\ntestimony credible, because the officer’s questions concerned the right of Turner\nand the others to be on Clean Halls property, because there is no indication that the\nofficers suspected Turner of any other crime, and because the parties were unable\nto locate a UF-250 or any other documentation showing otherwise, I find it more\nlikely than not that Turner’s second stop was based on the suspicion of trespass.\nc. J.G.’s Stop\nJ.G. is the son of plaintiff Jaenean Ligon and the brother of J.A.G. and\nJerome Grant.  The family lives in a Clean Halls building in the Bronx.153\nJ.G., who is black and seventeen years old, testified that the first time\nhe remembered being stopped around his apartment building was on an evening in\nAugust 2011.  He had gone to a nearby store to buy ketchup for dinner.  On his\nway back, he saw two plainclothes officers with badges in front of his building and\nthree uniformed officers across the street.  When J.G. reached his building, the\nofficers stopped him and began asking him questions, such as where he was\n152 Defendants’ post-hearing brief does not challenge whether Turner’s\nsecond stop was based on suspicion of trespass, but does challenge whether five of\nthe other unrecorded stops described by plaintiffs were for trespass.  See Def.\nFindings ¶¶ 17 (Kieron Johnson), 19 (Jerome Grant), 20 (both of Letitia Ledan’s\nstops), 21 (Roshea Johnson).  I address each of defendants’ challenges below.\n153 See Tr. 10/17 at 438:4–25.\n49\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 50 of 157\ncoming from, where he was headed, and what he had in his bag.  After J.G.\nanswered that he had ketchup in the bag, one of the officers asked him to raise his\nhands, then asked him what he had in his pockets.  The officer started to frisk him,\nfirst shaking J.G.’s pockets, then putting a hand in J.G.’s left pocket,154 then patting\nJ.G.’s arms down.  After the search, the officer asked for J.G.’s ID and took his\nname down on a notepad.  Then the other officer looked in J.G.’s bag and\ninspected the ketchup.  The officers asked for J.G.’s apartment number and rang\nthe bell.  Finally, after Ligon had come downstairs and confirmed that J.G. was her\nson, the officers handed her the ketchup and let them go.155\nLigon’s testimony supported J.G.’s account.  Ligon testified that she\nsent J.G. to the store for ketchup one evening when she was cooking chicken and\n154 As I noted above, plaintiffs have not focused on the issue of frisks in\nthe instant litigation.  Nevertheless, it is worth emphasizing that the officer’s\nplacement of his hand in J.G.’s pocket goes beyond “a carefully limited search of\nthe outer clothing . . . in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to\nassault him.”  Terry, 392 U.S. at 30.  If the officer had no reasonable basis for\nbelieving J.G.’s pocket contained a dangerous weapon that J.G. might use to harm\nthe officer, the officer’s search of J.G.’s pocket violated J.G.’s rights under the\nFourth Amendment.  See Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 373 (1993)\n(reaffirming that Terry frisk “must be strictly ‘limited to that which is necessary for\nthe discovery of weapons which might be used to harm the officer or others\nnearby’” (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 26)).  \n155 See Tr. 10/17 at 437:17, 439:4–443:2.\n50\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 51 of 157\nfrench fries.  A few minutes after he left, she heard her bell ring.156  Jerome Grant\nanswered the bell and an unfamiliar voice said:  “[C]an you please come down and\nidentify your son.”157  Hearing these words, Ligon thought J.G. was dead or hurt. \nShe ran downstairs and collapsed on the steps when she saw J.G. standing,\nuninjured, beside the officers.  The plainclothes officer who was standing with J.G.\napproached Ligon, laughing, and handed her the ketchup.158\nI find J.G.’s and Ligon’s testimony credible.  J.G. provided no\ngrounds for suspicion of trespass — or indeed of any other crime — as he\napproached his building.  He also provided no grounds for suspicion in his\nresponses to the officers’ questions.  J.G. provided no further basis for a stop,\nmuch less a frisk.  Because the officers did not ask J.G. whether he lived in the\nbuilding, it is unclear whether J.G.’s stop was based on the suspicion of trespass. \nNevertheless, because J.G. was only stopped as he approached a Clean Halls\nbuilding, because the officers’ questions indicate no suspicion of any other crime\nother than trespass, and because the parties have been unable to locate a UF-250\nindicating otherwise, it remains more likely than not that J.G. was stopped on\n156 See id. at 429:7–430:4.\n157 Id. at 430:4–14.\n158 See id. at 430:16–433:1.\n51\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 52 of 157\nsuspicion of trespass — if his stop was indeed based on a particularized suspicion\nof any crime at all.\nd. Jerome Grant’s Stop\nJerome Grant, J.G.’s older brother and Ligon’s son, testified that his\ngrandmother, Betty Ligon, lives at 274 Bonner Place in the Bronx.159  274 Bonner\nPlace is a Clean Halls building.160\nGrant, who is black and nineteen years old, testified that the first time\nthe police stopped him at his grandmother’s building was in July 2011.  He had\nbeen playing basketball with his little brother J.A.G., his cousin, and a friend.  In\nthe evening, the group needed to pick up a key from Grant’s grandmother’s house,\nso they began walking toward it and sent J.A.G. to run ahead.  J.A.G. went inside\nthe building without leaving the door open, so the others knocked loudly on the\ndoor.161  Grant’s cousin was “a little upset” by being locked out.162\nTwo uniformed male police officers, one white and one Asian,\napproached with flashlights and asked if Grant, his cousin, and his friend lived in\n159 See id. at 452:13–25.\n160 See Photo of 274 Bonner Place, Pl.

Grant explained that they were visiting\ntheir grandmother’s apartment to get a key, and Grant’s cousin asked if they were\ndoing anything wrong.163  The Asian officer responded, “I’m the one that’s talking\nhere.”164  When Grant’s cousin said that he just wanted to know if there was a\nproblem, the Asian officer told him to “hush up” and there would not be any\nproblems.165  Then the officers made Grant, his cousin, and his friend stand with\ntheir backs against a wall and take out their IDs.166  When only Grant had an ID,\nthe Asian officer told Grant’s cousin and friend:  “I could take you in because you\ndon’t have ID.”167  The Asian officer then wrote down Grant’s cousin’s and\nfriend’s names and birthdates in a notepad while the white officer did the same for\nGrant.168\nThen the Asian officer returned Grant’s ID and told the group to turn\naround and place their hands against the wall.

Finally,\nthe Asian officer told the group to put their backs against the wall again, warned\nthem to carry their IDs with them, and explained that the officers had wanted to\nmake sure the group was not trespassing.  J.A.G. came outside shortly after the\nofficers left.  Grant testified that he did not feel free to leave until the officers told\nhim to go home.170\nI find Grant’s testimony largely credible, though it conflicted in\ncertain minor details with his deposition testimony.171  Defendants argue that the\nofficers approached based on the group knocking on the door, rather than on the\nsuspicion of trespass.172  But I accept Grant’s testimony that the John Doe\ndefendant Asian officer mentioned trespassing as the basis for the stop.173 \ne. Roshea Johnson’s Stop\n169 Again, as in the cases of Bradley and J.G., the officer’s conduct\nclearly exceeded the constitutional bounds of a frisk.\n170 See id. at 458:3–459:21, 461:4–24, 462:3–5.\n171 For example, Grant stated at the deposition that the Asian officer\nfrisked all three members of the group.

Sometimes he lived with Ledan, and at other times with a friend.  River\nPark Towers is enrolled in Operation Clean Halls.175\nOn the morning of Father’s Day 2010, Johnson, who is black and was\nthen thirty-four years old, went to Ledan’s apartment to change into clothes he had\nleft there.  To enter River Park Towers, it is not necessary to pass through security\nor a closed gate, or to have a key.  Johnson walked into Ledan’s building and took\nthe elevator to her floor.  When he knocked at Ledan’s door, there was no answer. \nHe went back to the elevator and returned to the ground floor, planning to call\nLedan on the payphone in front of a supermarket in the complex.176\nAs Johnson crossed the street to the payphone, a black van pulled up\nwith police officers inside.  One officer asked him where he was coming from.177 \n174 See Tr. 10/16 at 394:2–395:2.  Roshea Johnson is unrelated to plaintiff\nKieron Johnson.

Defendants have not located a UF-250\nconnected to Roshea Johnson’s stop, or identified the officers involved in the stop,\ndespite Roshea Johnson’s precise identification of the time and place of his stop\nand his detailed physical descriptions of the officers. See Musick Chart (incident\n11); Tr. 10/16 at 401:20-402:3.\n55\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 56 of 157\nJohnson told the officer he was coming from his sister’s house but she was not\nhome.178  Then the officer “mentioned something about trespassing.”179  Johnson\ntried to tell the officer that he could prove he was not trespassing, and that he had a\nletter in his pocket with his name and his sister’s address on it.  The officer\nresponded by handcuffing Johnson and placing him in the back of the van.180\nThe officers then drove the van to another part of the complex and\nquestioned Johnson.181  One of the officers asked Johnson “where was the drugs or\nthe guns at.”182  Johnson said he “didn’t know where the drugs or the gun was.”183 \nThe officers continued asking similar questions for a few minutes, then pulled out\nof the complex.184  During the drive, the officers “said you could make it easy on\nyourself if you tell us where the guns and the drug was, but I didn’t know where no\nguns or drugs was.”185  Finally, after about fifteen or twenty minutes, the officers\n178 See Tr. 10/16 at 400:14–15.\n179 Id. at 400:17.\n180 See id. at 400:17–401:18.\n181 See id. at 402:4–22.\n182 Id. at 402:19–20.\n183 Id. at 402:21–22.\n184 See id. at 402:23–403:8.\n185 Id. at 403:11–13.\n56\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 57 of 157\npulled over at a location about a mile from River Park Towers, opened the door,\nand told Johnson to get out of the van.186  “When I got out of the van, he said\nmaybe you don’t know nothing, and took the handcuffs off me and let me go.”187 \nLooking back, Johnson said that the encounter made him feel “angry and kind of\nhelpless.”188\nI find Johnson’s testimony credible.  Johnson provided no grounds for\nsuspicion of trespass as he entered and exited Ledan’s building.  He also provided\nno grounds for suspicion in his interactions with the officers.  Nor did Johnson’s\nconduct provide any other basis for a stop. \nf. Letitia Ledan’s Stops\nLetitia Ledan, Roshea Johnson’s sister, testified that she has lived at\nRiver Park Towers for the past eleven years.  She chairs the maintenance and\nelevator committee in the tenants’ association.  As noted above, River Park Towers\nis enrolled in Operation Clean Halls.189\nLedan, who is black, testified that she has been stopped six times in or\n186 See id. at 403:15–20, 403:25–404:3.\n187 Id. at 403:18–20.\n188 Tr. 10/17 at 417:21–23.\n189 See Tr. 10/16 at 297:2–298:19.\n57\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 58 of 157\naround her building.  Twice the stops occurred outdoors.  The first took place at\nsome time in 2009, although she could not provide a more precise date.  Two white\nmale officers stopped her in front of a supermarket in the River Park Towers\ncomplex as she was about to leave the complex.  They asked her whether she lived\nthere and whether she had an ID, then took her ID, looked at it, handed it back to\nher, and said to have a nice day.  During the roughly three-minute encounter, she\ndid not feel free to leave because the officers were standing in front of her and had\nher ID.190\nLedan’s second outdoor stop occurred in the summer of 2011.  Ledan\nwas returning home from work in the afternoon and saw four uniformed police\nofficers standing with her husband and two of her friends in front of her building. \nWhile one of the officers patted down one of Ledan’s friends, another was patting\ndown Ledan’s husband and removing items from his pockets.  As Ledan\napproached her building, she asked what was going on.191  Then an officer\napproached her, and she asked, “[W]hy are you stopping us?”192  The officer told\nher to be quiet and asked whether she lived at the building, then asked for her ID,\n190 See id. at 300:22–24, 301:1–14, 302:5–25, 317:18–25.\n191 See id. at 306:16–308:8.\n192 Id. at 308:8–10.\n58\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 59 of 157\nwhich she gave to him.193  After returning her ID and finishing the search of her\nhusband and friends, the officers “just started walking away.”194  As in 2009,\nLedan did not feel free to leave during the encounter because the officer blocked\nthe entrance to her building and had her ID.195\nI find Ledan’s testimony as to both stops credible.  Ledan provided no\ngrounds for suspicion of trespass, or any other crime, on either occasion.  She also\nprovided no grounds for suspicion in her responses to the officers’ questions. \nLedan’s conduct provided no other basis for a stop.  Based on the officers’\nquestions, Ledan’s first stop was most likely on suspicion of trespass.  Plaintiffs\nhave provided insufficient evidence, however, that Ledan’s second stop was a\ntrespass stop.  The second stop could just as well have been based on the suspicion\nthat Ledan was somehow involved in the suspected crime for which her husband\nand friends were stopped.\ng.

After\nMoronta explained that he had been at his brother’s apartment, one of the officers\nasked if he had anything sharp in his pockets and then patted him down and\nsearched his pockets.197  Then the officer asked if they could go upstairs to confirm\nMoronta’s story, and Moronta gave his permission.  A white officer asked for\nMoronta’s ID.198  On the way up in the elevator, a black officer told Moronta that\nhe “better be telling the truth,” because if Moronta’s brother did not live in the\nbuilding, Moronta would be arrested for trespassing.199  \nAt the door, Moronta’s brother identified Moronta, and after the white\n196 See id. at 340:24–341:4, 342:1–343:13, 343:14–344; Pl.

Moronta provided no grounds\nfor suspicion as he exited his brother’s building, or in his responses to the officers’\nquestions.  Moronta’s conduct provided no other basis for a stop.\nh. Kieron Johnson’s Stop\nKieron Johnson, who is black, was twenty-one years old at the time of\nthe hearing.

Defendants also note that\nplaintiffs’ Complaint alleges that Moronta’s stop occurred in 2010.  See Def.\nFindings ¶ 22 n.10; Compl. ¶ 129.  But Moronta testified that he had not looked at\nthe Complaint closely enough to notice the error until three days before his hearing\ntestimony, and that plaintiffs’ counsel may have confused the stop to which he\ntestified with an arrest for trespass in 2010.

Johnson went to Jefferson’s building and waited outside, about\nsix steps away from the door.204  After about two minutes, two uniformed officers\n“pulled up in a car and . . . jumped out and ran out and around me.”205  One asked\nwhether Johnson had been in the building.  After he replied that he had not, one of\nthe officers asked for his ID while the other patted down his front pockets and\nreached into his back pockets, where he kept his wallet.206  The officer looked\nthrough his wallet, then the other officer returned his ID and told him he was free\nto go.  Until then, Johnson did not feel free to leave.207\nI find Johnson’s testimony credible, despite his inability to offer a\nmore precise date for the stop.

Johnson stated that after the incident, he felt\n“[e]mbarrassed and worried,” because “there’s usually people outside and I don’t\nlike when they see me being stopped by officers.”  See id. at 384:7–10.\n62\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 63 of 157\ntrespass, because he testified that at the time of the stop, he believed the officers\nwere truancy officers.208  But defendants offer no persuasive evidence that the\nofficers were, in fact, truancy officers.209  Even if the officers were truancy officers, \ndefendants fail to show how this fact would undermine plaintiffs’ claim that\nJohnson was stopped on suspicion of trespass.210  Presumably truancy officers are\nno less able to make trespass stops than any other kind of officer.  Moreover,\nJohnson’s testimony that the officers asked him whether he had been inside the\nbuilding suggests a trespass stop.211  Based on Johnson’s testimony, I find that he\nprovided no grounds for suspicion of trespass as he waited outside Jefferson’s\nbuilding, in his responses to the officers’ questions, or in any other manner.\ni.  Jovan Jefferson’s Stop\nJovan Jefferson, who is black, was twenty years old at the time of the\nhearing.  As noted above, he lives in a Clean Halls building in the Bronx. \nJefferson testified that he had been stopped outside Clean Halls buildings about\nseven to eight times, and inside Clean Halls buildings about three to four times. \n208 See id. at 385:4–13; Pl.

He and Muriel had been watching\nSportsCenter in Muriel’s apartment when Muriel left for work.  It was shortly after\nnoon as the two of them stepped out of Muriel’s building.213  A passing police van\nstopped and three officers got out, including two that Jefferson recognized as\nofficers named “Marquez” and “Rodriguez.”214  Jefferson testified that these\nofficers had previously stopped him inside his building, and had arrested Kieron\nJohnson for trespass inside Jefferson’s building at a time when Jefferson was with\nhim.  The officers had also arrested another friend of Jefferson’s for trespass.215  I\nfind it more likely than not that Rodriguez participated in the stop that Jefferson\ndescribed.\n212 See id. at 359:17–361:14.\n213 See id. at 361:15–362:16.\n214 Id. at 362:18–363:15; Compl. ¶ 83.

The officers also asked Muriel for his ID. \nThen Jefferson’s mother drove by with his aunt.216  After his mother got out and\napproached the officers, Rodriguez stated that Jefferson was “free to go and that he\nwas just talking to me.”217  Jefferson testified that he did not feel free to leave\nbefore his mother approached.218\nI find Jefferson’s testimony largely credible, despite his failure during\nhis deposition to remember the stop to which he testified at the hearing.219  Given\nthe number of times Jefferson has apparently been stopped, it is understandable\nthat he might forget one and then remember it later, just as it would be\nunderstandable if a police officer were unable to remember a relatively brief,\nunrecorded stop.  I find that neither Jefferson nor Muriel provided grounds for\nsuspicion of trespass as they exited Muriel’s building, as they responded to the\nofficers’ questions, or in any other manner.\n216 See id. at 364:22–365:17.\n217 Id. at 365:7–13.\n218 See id. at 366:13–15.

Expert Testimony Regarding UF-250 Forms\nPlaintiffs’ expert witness, Dr. Jeffrey Fagan, is a criminologist with\nexpertise in statistics.220  Dr. Fagan performed a statistical analysis of data\ncontained on certain UF-250 forms completed by NYPD officers in the Bronx in\n2011.221  As noted above, officers are required to complete a UF-250 form after\neach stop.222  The front and back of the form contain various checkboxes and fields\nin which officers indicate the nature of the stop and the circumstances that led to\nthe stop.223\nDr. Fagan ultimately concluded that the NYPD recorded 1,663 stops\noutside a Clean Halls building in the Bronx in 2011 based only on a suspicion of\ntrespass, and without observing any indoor behavior.224  Of these stops, Dr. Fagan\n220 See Floyd v.

First, they argue that it is impossible to conclude whether reasonable\nsuspicion existed for a stop based on a UF-250 alone because “it is a conclusory\nform that does not capture all details, nuances and circumstances that may lead to a\nstop.”227  Defendants argue that Dr. Fagan had an obligation to incorporate into his\ntotals at various stages of analysis).\n225 See Fagan Report at 15 tbl. 8; App. L to Fagan Report; Tr. 10/15 at\n114:4–115:2.\n226 See Tr. 10/15 at 115:1–2.\n227 Def. Findings ¶ 3 n.1.  In Arvizu, the Supreme Court rejected the\nNinth Circuit’s attempt to clarify the reasonable suspicion standard by analyzing\nvarious stop factors in isolation as part of what the Supreme Court described as a\n“reasonable-suspicion calculus.”  534 U.S. at 272.  The Supreme Court emphasized\nthe importance of looking to the “‘totality of the circumstances’” in reasonable\nsuspicion analyses.  See id. at 273 (quoting Cortez, 449 U.S. at 417–18).  Dr.\nFagan’s report, though quantitative, attempts no such mechanistic analysis, because\nit does not claim to be the final word on whether reasonable suspicion existed for\nany individual stop in the UF-250 database.  See Fagan Report at 15 (identifying\nstops “where there does not appear” to be any combination of factors justifying a\ntrespass stop (emphasis added)).  Accord Floyd, 861 F.

Defendants\ndid not.230  In general, as I stated when evaluating Dr. Fagan’s methods in Floyd,\n“(il)legality of a stop” cannot be “conclusively determined on the basis of\npaperwork alone,” and clarifying that the UF-250 database “is necessarily an\nincomplete reflection of the totality of the circumstances leading to each stop”). \nUnlike a hearing on a single motion to suppress, this hearing aims to determine,\nbased on necessarily limited data, whether the City and NYPD engaged in a\nwidespread practice of constitutional violations.\n228 Def. Findings ¶ 7.\n229 See id. ¶ 4.\n230 Similarly, defendants speculate that some of the buildings Dr. Fagan\nidentified as Clean Halls buildings might not have been enrolled in Clean Halls on\nthe date of the stop.  See id. ¶ 10.  Yet defendants fail to identify a single stop for\nwhich this was actually the case.\n68\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 69 of 157\nthe contents of UF-250s are admissible and probative.231  As defendants themselves\nemphasize, officers are required to record all the reasons justifying a stop,232 and\nthe UF-250 provides spaces for officers to record any reason.233  To the extent that\nplaintiffs used the UF-250 database primarily to estimate the magnitude of the\nproblem at issue in this case, plaintiffs were under no legal obligation to\nsupplement “the extremely rich and informative material”234 contained in the UF-\n250 database with other paperwork or testimony.\nIn any case, even if there are reasons to believe that Dr. Fagan’s\nexclusive reliance on UF-250s led to inaccuracies, the inaccuracies generally\n231 See Floyd, 861 F.

UF-250s present a one-sided picture of a stop: \nthey are completed not by neutral third parties, or with the cooperation of the\nstopped person, but by officers who have obvious incentives to justify the stops\nthey have made.235  More significantly, evidence from the hearing suggested that\nmany stops take place for which no UF-250 form is ever generated.  Sgt. Musick\nfailed to identify a single UF-250 form for any of the eleven stops to which\nplaintiffs testified,236 and in both of the stops where officers were clearly identified,\nthe officers admitted that they had failed to complete a UF-250 for the stop.237 \nPlaintiffs also introduced two reports by the Civilian Complaint Review Board\n(“CCRB”) stating that there is a systemic problem with officers failing to complete\nUF-250 forms after stops.238  \n235 This conclusion receives anecdotal support from Officer Santiago’s\nerroneous paperwork regarding Bradley’s arrest, which tended to overstate rather\nthan understate the justifications for the arrest.  See Bradley Fact Sheet.\n236 See Tr. 10/23 at 1125–1143.\n237 See Tr. 10/22 at 1024:2–7 (Officer Ramdeen’s failure to complete UF-\n250 for Turner’s stop); Tr. 10/23 at 1110:3–18 (Officer Santiago’s failure to\ncomplete UF-250 for Bradley’s stop).  \n238 See CCRB 2010 Annual Report, Pl. Ex. 78, at 13 (2010 report\ndescribing failure to fill out UF-250s as “major failure[]”); CCRB 2011 Annual\nReport, Pl. Ex. 79, at 14 (2011 Report describing same as “major categor[y] of\nfailure”).  I note that the NYPD Legal Bureau’s PowerPoint presentation at\nRodman’s Neck may be read as suggesting, erroneously, that UF-250s need not be\nprepared when a stop results in arrest:  “If the investigation does not lead to an\n70\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 71 of 157\nIn light of the above, I reject defendants’ contention that the sole\nreliance on UF-250 forms as a statistical tool provides a categorically inadequate\nbasis for determining the rough magnitude of unlawful stops in this case.  I also\nfind that failures to fill out UF-250 forms likely led to a significant undercounting\nof both lawful and unlawful stops in Dr. Fagan’s analysis.\nSecond, defendants attack Dr. Fagan’s analysis based on his failure to\ntake account of a field on the UF-250 labeled “Period of Observation Prior To\nStop.”239  Defendants correctly note that the location field that Dr. Fagan matched\nto Clean Halls addresses indicates not the location of the suspected trespass but the\nlocation of the stop.240  According to defendants’ theory, Dr. Fagan’s analysis\novercounted the number of outdoor stops based on suspicion of trespass in Clean\nHalls buildings because officers may have stopped someone near a Clean Halls\nbuilding on suspicion of trespass in a nearby building.241  As defendants conceded\nin their opening argument, however, the possibility of a discrepancy between the\narrest the individual must be released immediately, and a UF-250 must be\nprepared.”  NYPD Legal Bureau, Street Encounters PowerPoint Presentation\n(“Street Encounters Presentation”), Def.

Findings ¶ 10. \n245 According to plaintiffs, the UF-250 database fields that could contain\ntext suggesting an observation of indoor behavior included the field called\n“premname,” as summarized in App. D to the Fagan Report, and the field called\n“detailSA,” as summarized in App. E to the Fagan Report.\n72\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 73 of 157\nobservation of indoor behavior.246  But it is easy to imagine an officer observing\nbehavior inside a Clean Halls building, making a stop outside, checking the\n“Outside” box as a result of the stop location, describing the location of the\noutdoor stop in greater detail in the “Type of Location” field, and failing to\nindicate elsewhere on the form that all or part of the observed behavior took place\ninside.\nNonetheless, defendants have failed to show why it was necessary for\nDr. Fagan to exclude all stops involving the observation of indoor behavior in the\nfirst place.  An outdoor stop based on the observation of unsuspicious indoor\nbehavior may be just as unconstitutional, and just as potentially relevant to\nestablishing a pattern of unlawful trespass stops outside Clean Halls buildings,247 as\na stop based solely on the observation of unsuspicious outdoor behavior near a\nTAP building, or a person exiting a TAP building.

Some of the text strings in\nFagan Report Appendices D and E that indicate indoor behavior also indicate\nreasonable suspicion for a trespass stop, such as “DRINKING IN REAR OF\nBUILDING,” and “STAIRWELL DRINKING.”  App. E to Fagan Report.  Many\nothers, however, do not.  See App. D to Fagan Report (excluding stops with text\nstrings such as “LOBBY,” and “VESTIBULE”); App. E to Fagan Report (same\nwith text strings such as “INSIDE CLEAN HALLS,” and “SUSPECT\nOBSERVED INSIDE CLEAN HALL BUILDING”).\n73\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 74 of 157\nexclude all stops involving the observation of indoor behavior because these stops\nas a group tend to have a greater likelihood of being based on reasonable\nsuspicion, especially if the officer observed the person indoors for a long period of\ntime.  If so, the exclusion was a gesture of methodological conservatism,248 and the\napparent unfeasibility of perfectly executing the exclusion should not be held\nagainst plaintiffs.  While Dr. Fagan’s methods may have failed to exclude some\nstops that were preceded by an observation of indoor behavior, this failure, by\nitself, is unlikely to have any significant impact on the validity of Dr. Fagan’s\nconclusions.249\nThird, defendants criticize Dr. Fagan for having departed from\nmethods he used to analyze UF-250 forms in Davis and Floyd.250  I decline to\nevaluate Dr. Fagan’s simple methods in the instant case through the circuitous\n248 Dr. Fagan’s testimony suggested that he attempted to exclude any stop\nthat was “not purely an outdoor stop.”  See Tr. 10/15 at 74:3–5 (emphasis added).\n249 A similar argument applies to defendants’ assertion that Dr. Fagan’s\nmethod failed to exclude some stops that took place outside a Clean Halls building\nbut within the legal limits of the property on which the building sits.  See Def.\nFindings ¶ 10; Tr. 10/15 at 128:1–9.  An unconstitutional stop outside a Clean\nHalls building but within the property line can support the existence of a pattern of\nunconstitutional stops outside Clean Halls buildings just as well as an\nunconstitutional stop a few steps outside the lot boundary.\n250 See Def. Findings ¶ 4 (citing generally Dr. Fagan’s analyses in Floyd\nand Davis).\n74\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 75 of 157\nroute proposed by defendants of analyzing Dr. Fagan’s far more complicated\nmethods in the other two cases, determining whether those methods were valid,\ncomparing those methods to Dr. Fagan’s methods in the instant case, analyzing\nwhether Dr. Fagan’s methods in the instant case are consistent with the methods in\nthe other two cases, and then, if any inconsistency arises, rejecting Dr. Fagan’s\nmethods in the instant case on that basis.  Instead, I will simply evaluate the\nvalidity of Dr. Fagan’s methods in the instant case on their own terms.  \nFurthermore, it would be entirely understandable if the application of\nthe method from Floyd to the instant case resulted in a lower count of unlawful\nstops than the method Dr. Fagan used here.  The explanation for such a\ndiscrepancy is apparent.  Dr. Fagan used more conservative assumptions\nthroughout Floyd than in the instant case, and with valid reason.251  The universe of\nstops that Floyd analyzes for unconstitutionality is vastly larger than the universe\nanalyzed for unconstitutionality as part of the instant motion — 2.8 million stops\nversus 1,663.252  As a result, the plaintiffs in Floyd have less of a need for precision\n251 For example, Dr. Fagan assumed in Floyd and Davis, which also dealt\nwith a far larger universe of stops, that Furtive Movements in combination with\nHigh Crime Area should be coded as constituting reasonable suspicion.  See Tr.\n10/15 at 151:2–5.\n252 Compare Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 278, with Period of Observation\nTable.\n75\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 76 of 157\nthan plaintiffs in the instant case.  That does not mean that plaintiffs’ precision in\nthe instant case is spurious.  Dr. Fagan’s credibility should hardly be questioned in\nthe instant case simply because, for whatever strategic or pragmatic reasons, he\nchose cautious but more manageable methods in another case that might result in a\nlarge number of unlawful stops being coded as lawful.  Once again, the relevant\nquestion in evaluating Dr. Fagan’s methods in the instant case is whether the\nmethods are valid here, not whether they are identical to the methods used in a\ndifferent case based on a different universe of stops.253\nFourth, defendants persuasively note that Dr. Fagan’s analysis,\nstanding alone, does not provide a convincing methodology for establishing a\ncausal nexus between the Clean Halls program and the stops that Dr. Fagan\n253 In addition, I note that the method in Floyd aims to identify stops for\nwhich no reasonable suspicion of any crime exists, whereas the method in the\ninstant case aims to identify stops for which no reasonable suspicion of trespass\nexists.  Given a universe of forms recording stops based only on suspicion of\ntrespass, there may be some forms containing data that could arguably constitute\nreasonable suspicion of some crime, but not of trespass.  The Floyd method will\nidentify these stops as arguably lawful, while Dr. Fagan’s method in the instant\ncase will identify them as apparently unlawful.  As a result, Dr. Fagan’s method in\nthe instant case will result in a higher count of unlawful stops than his method in\nFloyd.  This does not imply bad faith or a contradiction in Dr. Fagan’s methods,\nmuch less prove the invalidity of Dr. Fagan’s method in the instant case.  Floyd\nand Ligon simply aim to assess different sets of stops.\n76\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 77 of 157\nanalyzed.254  As Dr. Smith, stated in his report:  \nProfessor  Fagan’s  methodology,  by  its  very  nature,  cannot\ndistinguish between whatever impact Clean Halls may have had\non the pattern of Terry stops in the Bronx [and] the impact other\nfactors . . . might have had on that same pattern.  . . .  [I]t would be\ninvalid to conclude that Professor Fagan has demonstrated that the\nClean Halls program itself, and its implementation, caused the\noutcomes Professor Fagan observes and the Plaintiffs challenge.255\nIn essence, Dr. Fagan selected a set of stops from the UF-250 database\nbased on several selection criteria — the stops had to be in the Bronx, on suspicion\nof trespass only, at the location of a Clean Halls address, outside, and so on256 —\nand then determined how many of the stops in the set were unjustified.  This\napproach cannot show whether stops in the set were more likely to be unjustified\nthan stops in the UF-250 database in general, or stops in some other relevant set. \nMuch less can this approach show that belonging to the set causes an increased\nlikelihood that a stop will be unjustified.  Just as Dr. Fagan analyzed the number\nand percentage of trespass stops outside Clean Halls buildings that were\nunjustified, one could analyze the quantity of unjustified trespass stops outside any\n254 See Def. Findings ¶ 3 (citing Tr. 10/23 at 1172–77; Smith Report at\n7–29).\n255 Smith Report at 8 (emphasis added).\n256 See Fagan Report at 8 tbl.1; Tr. 10/15 at 83:15–85:7, 124:25–126:17\n(excluding stops at NYCHA addresses).\n77\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 78 of 157\narbitrary category of building — such as green buildings, or buildings with odd-\nnumbered addresses.  If, hypothetically, the police were making a large number of\nunjustified stops throughout New York City, the analysis would show that a large\nnumber of stops outside odd-numbered buildings were unjustified.  It would\nobviously be inappropriate to infer from this that the police had a customary\npractice of making unlawful stops outside odd-numbered buildings, or to grant a\npreliminary injunction requiring the police to conduct specific training regarding\nstops outside odd-numbered buildings.257\nThus, defendants are correct that Dr. Fagan’s analysis, standing alone,\ncannot establish a causal nexus between Clean Halls buildings and unlawful\ntrespass stops.  But plaintiffs have already established a clear likelihood of proving\nsuch a nexus based on other evidence.  ADA Rucker credibly testified to the police\nrepeatedly making unjustified trespass stops and arrests outside Clean Halls\n257 Plaintiffs imply in their Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“Reply Mem.”) that it is not\nnecessary for plaintiffs to prove “that officers are stopping people because the\nbuilding is enrolled in the Clean Halls program.”  Reply Mem. at 3.  But as the\nanalogy to the odd-numbered building hypothetical suggests, this cannot be\ncorrect.  Plaintiffs’ request for preliminary relief depends on there being a specific\nproblem involving stops outside Clean Halls buildings, a problem that can only be\npartially solved by improving the general training regarding the law of stop and\nfrisk.\n78\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 79 of 157\nbuildings because they were Clean Halls buildings.258  One plaintiff testified that\nan officer explained an unlawful trespass stop based on the fact that it took place\noutside a Clean Halls building.259  As discussed below, an officer in the NYPD’s\nLegal Bureau learned through focus groups with sergeants and lieutenants that they\nbelieved it was legal to approach and question, if not stop, anyone in a TAP\nbuilding even without a reason for doing so.260  Finally, on 417 of the UF-250s in\nDr. Fagan’s original universe of 1,857 trespass stops outside Clean Halls buildings,\nofficers handwrote phrases or words to the effect of “Clean Halls” or “Trespass\nAffidavit.”261  The purpose of a UF-250 is to record the circumstances that led to an\nofficer’s stop.262  The frequency with which officers took the time to note “Clean\n258 See supra Part IV.A.1.\n259 See Tr. 10/17 at 481:7–482:8 (Hispanic officer in Turner stop).  I also\nnote — though the evidence does not relate directly to the outdoor stops at issue in\nthis case — that Officer Santiago testified that even after receiving the NYPD’s\nstop and frisk training at Rodman’s Neck, he still believed there was legal\njustification to ask anyone in the lobby or hallways of a Clean Halls building for an\nID, even in the absence of any suspicion, reasonable or otherwise.  See Tr. 10/23 at\n1111:2–1113:10.  Officer Santiago attempted to qualify this rule by stating that the\nbuilding needed to be in a high crime area in order to justify a request for ID.  See\nid. at 1111:9–22.  He then undermined this qualification by stating, categorically,\nthat all Clean Halls buildings are in high crime areas.

Because\nthese arguments involve mixed questions of fact and law that depend on a fine-\ngrained analysis of what constitutes reasonable suspicion, I will address them in\nmy conclusions of law below.265  In any case, the facts regarding how Dr. Fagan\ncounted the number of unlawful stops are not in material dispute.\nBased on the testimony of plaintiffs and others, the decline to\nprosecute forms, and the statistical analysis performed by Dr. Fagan and discussed\nin greater detail below, I find that plaintiffs have shown a clear likelihood of laying\na sufficient factual foundation to prove that defendants have engaged in a\n263 See id. at 124:14–17; Tr. 10/22 at 1058:24–1059:2, 1072:9–19; Tr.\n10/23 at 1110:23–1111:1; App. B.\n264 See Def.

Steps Taken by the NYPD in 2012\nTAP began in the early 1990s in Manhattan.266  Despite the program’s\nname, TAP was originally focused not on trespass but on narcotics sales taking\nplace in the common areas of private buildings, such as lobbies, stairwells, and\nrooftops.267  An officer who testified regarding the origins of TAP stated that “[t]he\nmore that we cracked down on drug sales on the street, the more that you saw drug\ndealers move indoors.”268  Before TAP, officers had to deal informally with\nlandlords to get permission to enter private buildings in search of drug sales.269 \nTAP provided a formal process for building owners to permit officers to conduct\n266 See Tr. 10/17 at 519:8–520:16; Smith Report at 10–11; NYPD Legal\nBureau, Trespass Affidavit Program: Legal Guidelines for Citizen Encounters in\nTrespass Affidavit Buildings (“1999 TAP Legal Guidelines”), Def.

In 1999, the NYPD’s Legal Bureau created its\n“Legal Guidelines for Citizen Encounters in Trespass Affidavit Buildings.”  See\n1999 TAP Legal Guidelines.  One passage of the fourteen-page document states: \n“IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD THAT WHEN AN OFFICER IS NOT IN THE\nBUILDING (E.G., SITTING ACROSS THE STREET IN AN R.M.P.), MERELY\nOBSERVING AN INDIVIDUAL ENTERING AND EXITING THE BUILDING,\nOR SIMPLY EXITING THE BUILDING, IS NOT ENOUGH TO CONDUCT A\nSTOP.”  Id. at 6; Tr. 10/18 at 684:2–4.

NYPD Recognition of a Problem in TAP\nThe improvements to TAP in 2012 had their roots in earlier years. \nInspector Kerry Sweet, the executive officer of the NYPD Legal Bureau, testified\nthat by early 2010, he had become involved in a group that was examining vertical\npatrols and trespass issues in NYCHA buildings.274  Inspector Sweet received\napproval to examine these issues in the TAP program as well.275  In the summer of\n2010 through 2011, Inspector Sweet conducted focus groups with sergeants and\nlieutenants involved with TAP, and then with prosecutors and various NYPD\nofficials.276  Inspector Sweet learned that “there really wasn’t a lot of direction\nabout the administration of the program.”277  During his deposition, Inspector\nSweet testified that he also learned of “some confusion” regarding TAP stops:\n[O]fficers believe their role might have been as doorman [or]\ncustodian, rather than a strict application of De Bour.  And once\nagain, understanding that they needed that articulate reason to\napproach somebody and that if you were a doorman, you could\napproach everybody, but that is not the case.  . . .

And that obviously isn’t what we want\nthem to do nor is it probably the right thing to do under the De\nBour standard.278\n  \nInspector Sweet testified that Katherine Lemire, special counsel to Police\nCommissioner Raymond Kelly, attended meetings with Inspector Sweet where this\nproblem was discussed.279  \n2. Interim Orders 22 and 23 of 2012\nAfter completing the focus groups in 2010 and 2011, Inspector Sweet\nhelped to draft two new regulations to govern the TAP program:  Interim Orders\n(“IOs”) 22 and 23, both published in May 2012.280  IO 23 of 2012 addresses\nvarious administrative issues relating to TAP, including procedures for enrolling\n278 Tr. 10/18 at 648:18–649:16.  I note that Inspector Sweet’s testimony\nregarding what officers said at the focus groups appears to refer to the practice of\nstops without reasonable suspicion inside TAP buildings, and thus does not\nnecessarily indicate that Inspector Sweet was aware of the problem of unlawful\nstops outside TAP buildings.  At the hearing, Inspector Sweet also emphasized that\nhis concern was with unlawful approaches, not unlawful stops.

The second page of the Order begins with an\nitalicized warning:\nA uniformed member of the service may approach and question\npersons if they [sic] have an objective credible reason to do so. \nHowever, a uniformed member may not stop (temporarily detain)\na suspected trespasser unless the uniformed member reasonably\nsuspects that the person is in the building without authorization.283\nThe next page, in a separate section, repeats the first sentence of this note, and then\ncontinues, again in italics:\nWhen reasonable suspicion exists, a STOP, QUESTION AND\nFRISK REPORT WORKSHEET shall be prepared as per P.G.\n212-11, “Stop and Frisk.”  Some factors which may contribute to\n“reasonable suspicion” that a person is trespassing, in addition\nto those factors set forth in P.G. 212-11, “Stop and Frisk,” are\ncontradictory assertions made to justify presence in the building\nand/or assertions lacking credibility made to justify presence in\nthe building.284\nThe section continues by stating that a trespass arrest requires probable cause, and\n281 See IO 23 of 2012.\n282 See IO 22 of 2012 at 1 (¶ 1, “SCOPE,” and “PROCEDURE”).\n283 Id. at 2.\n284 Id. at 3.\n85\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 86 of 157\nthat refusal to answer questions is insufficient to establish probable cause.285  \nAs plaintiffs correctly note, however, IO 22 of 2012 makes no\nreference to stops outside TAP buildings.286  It does not explicitly state that stops\noutside TAP buildings require reasonable suspicion, and that merely exiting a TAP\nbuilding is insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion, even in a high crime\narea.287\nAt the hearing, defendants offered evidence of numerous steps that\nhave been taken to support the implementation of IOs 22 and 23 of 2012.288  After\nany trespass arrest, officers must now complete a “Trespass Crimes – Fact Sheet”\ndocumenting the facts that established probable cause.289  The Chief of Patrol\n285 See id.\n286 See Pl.

Improving the training surrounding stop and frisk in general may do nothing\nto dispel the notion that there is an exception for stops outside TAP buildings.\nIO 22 of 2012 makes clear that presence inside a TAP building is not\na sufficient basis for a stop, and that stops made during vertical patrols of TAP\nbuildings must be based on reasonable suspicion.  But IO 22 of 2012 and the\ntraining introduced in support of it present themselves as guides to conducting\nvertical patrols inside a TAP building, not guides for making trespass stops and\n299 See Def.

The difference may seem insignificant when\nviewed in the abstract.  In theory, officers should be able to infer from the rules in\nIO 22 of 2012 how to perform lawful trespass stops outside TAP buildings.  \nIn practice, however, the evidence at the hearing suggests that NYPD\nofficers are trained to carry out their duties according to a set of standard operating\nprocedures.  The NYPD’s training reduces the unpredictable, confusing challenges\nthat arise on patrol to a manageable set of standard situations and orderly\nprocedures for addressing them.302  If a recurring, problematic situation is not\nincluded in the training, officers may categorize it in the wrong way and employ\ninappropriate responses — such as stopping someone simply because he exited a\nTAP building.  The evidence at the hearing, as summarized in the previous section,\nstrongly supports the conclusion that many officers took such actions before\n302 IO 22 of 2012, for example, defines the standard scenario for a\nvertical patrol in a TAP building, lays out various common problems that may arise\nduring such a patrol, and prescribes what to do and what not to do in response to\nthem, including specific questions to ask.  See IO 22 of 2012 at 2.  After receiving\ntraining on IO 22 of 2012, including role-play simulations, see Tr. 10/19 at\n836:7–840:13, an officer will have less need to improvise under pressure or base\nhis or her responses on inferences from general principles or analogies to other\nscenarios.  In this sense, the NYPD’s training follows the model of a traditional\nWestern military academy, which aims “to reduce the conduct of war to a set of\nrules and a system of procedures — and thereby to make orderly and rational what\nis essentially chaotic and instinctive.”  JOHN KEEGAN, THE FACE OF BATTLE 18\n(1976).

But while defendants have introduced evidence of certain changes in\n94\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 95 of 157\nB. Preliminary Injunctive Relief\nPlaintiffs seek a variety of injunctive remedies that would require the\nNYPD to act in ways that depart from the status quo, including the development\nand implementation of new formal policies, new training procedures, and\nburdensome new supervisory and monitoring procedures.319  Because the\npreliminary injunctive relief sought by plaintiffs is thus mandatory rather than\nprohibitory, plaintiffs must show (1) that they are clearly or substantially likely to\nprove at trial that defendants are engaged in an ongoing custom of making trespass\nstops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx in the absence of reasonable suspicion, in\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment; (2) that plaintiffs are likely to suffer\nirreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief; (3) that the balance of equities\ntips in plaintiffs’ favor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.320\nThe following sections address each of these factors in turn.\n1. Clear or Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nthe NYPD’s policies and training in 2012, defendants have not proven that the\nNYPD’s custom of making unlawful trespass stops outside TAP buildings has\nended.  See supra Part IV.B.3; infra Part V.B.1.b.\n319 See Pl. Findings ¶¶ 72–75.  The remedies proposed in this Opinion,\nthough not identical to those requested by plaintiffs, remain largely mandatory in\nnature.  See infra Part V.C.\n320 See supra Part II.\n95\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 96 of 157\nBecause plaintiffs do not assert that defendants have an explicit or\nformally approved policy of making trespass stops without reasonable suspicion\noutside TAP buildings in the Bronx, plaintiffs must show a clear or substantial\nlikelihood of proving at trial that defendants have a custom or usage of making\nsuch stops.  Specifically, plaintiffs argue that defendants “have a pattern and\npractice” of making unlawful trespass stops outside TAP buildings, and that “the\nCity of New York has been deliberately indifferent” to this practice “by failing to\nsupervise and train.”321  \nMy analysis of plaintiffs’ claim proceeds in two steps.  First, I analyze\nplaintiffs’ deliberate indifference claim and conclude that plaintiffs have shown a\nclear likelihood of establishing that defendants’ longstanding failure to train\nofficers regarding the legal standards for trespass stops outside TAP buildings in\nthe Bronx, despite actual or constructive notice that this omission was causing city\nemployees to violate individuals’ constitutional rights, has risen to the level of\ndeliberate indifference.  Whether plaintiffs’ deliberate indifference claim is\nanalyzed in terms of the general standard in Connick, the three-part Walker\nstandard, or the constructive acquiescence standard, plaintiffs have shown a clear\n321 Pl. Findings ¶¶ 69–70.  Plaintiffs present the former as a “constructive\nacquiescence” claim, and the latter as a deliberate indifference claim based on\nfailure to train.  See id.  Because constructive acquiescence is merely a way of\nproving deliberate indifference, I analyze the claims together.\n96\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 97 of 157\nlikelihood of success on their Monell claim.  Second, I analyze whether defendants\nhave rebutted plaintiffs’ evidence of deliberate indifference based on the steps\ntaken by the NYPD in 2012.  I conclude that these steps have not meaningfully\naddressed the specific problem of unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP\nbuildings in the Bronx.\na. Deliberate Indifference\nApplying the law of Terry stops to my findings of fact, above,\nplaintiffs offered more than enough evidence at the hearing to support the\nconclusion that they have shown a clear likelihood of proving at trial that the\nNYPD has a practice of making unlawful trespass stops outside of TAP buildings\nin the Bronx:\ni. ADA Rucker’s Testimony  \nAs described above, ADA Rucker credibly testified that NYPD\nofficers have treated proximity to a TAP building as a factor contributing to\nreasonable suspicion, and have frequently made trespass stops outside TAP\nbuildings for no reason other than that the officer had seen someone enter and exit\nor exit the building.322  These stops were made because the building was enrolled\n322 See supra Part IV.A.1.\n97\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 98 of 157\nin TAP, and they were not based on any reasonable suspicion of trespass.323  ADA\nRucker’s testimony is corroborated by the accounts of stops and arrests in the\ntwenty-six decline to prosecute forms, as well as by the hundreds of UF-250s on\nwhich officers wrote “Clean Halls” as a justification for a stop.324  As discussed\nbelow, Dr. Fagan’s analysis of UF-250s provides further corroboration of ADA\nRucker’s testimony.325\nii. Plaintiffs’ Stops\nThe conclusion that the NYPD has repeatedly made trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings without reasonable suspicion is further supported by the\ncredible and mutually corroborating testimony of named plaintiffs regarding the\ncircumstances leading to their encounters with police.326  First, each of plaintiffs’\nencounters with the police rose to the level of Terry stops.  In theory, it might be\npossible for an officer to approach a person outside a TAP building and ask the\nperson his name, where he is coming from, whether he lives in the building, and if\nnot, whether he knows anyone in the building, all the while acting in such a way\n323 See id. \n324 See Tr. 10/15 at 124:18–24; Fagan Report at 13.\n325 See infra Part V.B.1.a.iii.\n326 See supra Part IV.A.2.\n98\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 99 of 157\nthat a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter and go about\nhis business.  Perhaps in an idealized scene from another era of policing,327 a local\nofficer might have politely posed these questions to a stranger near a building with\na trespass problem, and the stranger might have gladly consented to answer the\nquestions, knowing full well that he was free to walk away, but answering the\nquestions out of politeness or a sense of civic duty.328\nHere, by contrast, no reasonable person in plaintiffs’ position would\nhave felt free to leave during their encounters with the police.  Bradley was\nstopped when an officer in a van gestured for him to come over, he came over, and\n327 See STUNTZ, THE COLLAPSE OF AMERICAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE, at\n29–32 (contrasting localized Gilded Age criminal justice system in Northeast with\nmore centralized, legalized, and bureaucratized system today).  A plaintiff in Davis\ndescribed the contrasting styles of policing that Stuntz emphasizes in his book. \n“[B]efore the merger [of the NYCHA Police and the NYPD], we had one officer\nthat was stationed in our building.  He knew all the residents.  If there was a\nproblem, and he would come to the parent and discuss whatever the problem was\nand he would talk to the young men in the building and there was a mutual respect\nwe had for one another.  We don’t have that anymore, it is so impersonal . . . .” \nDavis, 2012 WL 4813837, at *1 n.10.\n328 See United States v. Tavolacci, 895 F.2d 1423, 1424–25 (D.C. Cir.\n1990) (stating that the “free to leave” test “assumes that the individual is aware of\npolice duties to keep the peace and prevent crime, and that that ‘awareness,\ncoupled with feelings of civic duty, moral obligation, or simply proper etiquette,\nwill often lead a reasonable person to cooperate.’” (quoting Gomez v.

The stop continued as the officer asked Turner what he\nwas doing and whether he lived in the building beside which he was standing.331 \nTurner was stopped a second time when a police car pulled up in front of him as he\nand others were exiting a Clean Halls building, an officer got out, questioned the\ngroup, and requested Turner’s identification.332  J.G. was stopped when five\nofficers approached him outside his building, stopped him, and asked him where\nhe was coming from, where he was headed, and what he had in his bag.  He was\nsurely stopped when the officers made him raise his hands, frisked him, and\nsearched inside his pockets and his grocery bag.333  Jerome Grant was stopped\nwhen two officers approached with flashlights, questioned him and his friends to\ndetermine whether they were trespassing, and in response to questions from those\nwho were stopped, replied with strong words such as “I’m the one that’s talking\n329 Tr. 10/16 at 266:3.\n330 Tr. 10/17 at 477:8.\n331 See id. at 478:13–22, 479:8–11.\n332 See id. at 486:9–490:25.\n333 See id. at 437:17, 439:4–443:2.\n100\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 101 of 157\nhere,”334 and “hush up.”335  Roshea Johnson was stopped when a black van pulled\nup in front of him with police officers inside and one of them began questioning\nhim about trespassing.336  He was certainly stopped — and arrested — a moment\nlater when he was placed in handcuffs in the back of the van.337\nSimilar analyses apply to nearly all of the other stops described by\nplaintiffs.  No reasonable person would have felt free to leave in plaintiffs’\ncircumstances once an officer or officers approached, caused the plaintiff to stop\nthrough a command, gesture, accusatory introduction, or by taking possession of\nthe person’s property, and then began asking questions that were clearly intended\nto elicit incriminating responses regarding trespassing.  \nAny doubt that plaintiffs were free to leave after the commencement\nof intrusive investigatory questioning is resolved by looking to the instances in the\ndecline to prosecute forms when suspects attempted to terminate their encounters. \nIn one encounter, “the defendant attempted to walk away[,] at which time [the\nofficer] grabbed the defendant[’]s arms.”338  After a struggle, the defendant was\n334 Id. at 456:13.\n335 Id. at 456:18–19.\n336 See id. at 399:21–400:17.\n337 See id. at 400:17–401:18.\n338 App. A ¶ 12.\n101\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 102 of 157\narrested.339  In another encounter, “[t]he arresting officer stopped defendant and\ndefendant clenched his fists on his sides and spread his feet apart and . . . stated . . .\nYOU’RE NOT GOING TO TOUCH ME.  YOU’RE NOT GOING TO TOUCH\nME.  YOU’RE NOT PUTTING YOUR HANDS ON ME.”340  The arresting officer\nthen handcuffed the defendant and placed him in a patrol vehicle.341  Similarly,\nwhen various defendants simply refused to answer an officer’s questions, it became\nclear that they were not free to terminate the encounter in this way either.342  In one\nencounter, the arresting officer “approached the defendant and asked her where she\nwas coming [from], what was she doing in the building[,] and what apartment\nnumber was she visiting.  Defendant responded in sum and substance: I WAS\nVISITING A FRIEND.  I AM NOT TELLING YOU THE APARTMENT\nNUMBER OR THE NAME.”343  The defendant was then arrested for trespass.344\n339 See id.\n340 Id. ¶ 20.\n341 See id.\n342 See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 4, 15, 22, 25, 26.  In Davis, I held that “the Fifth\nAmendment prohibits police from arresting an individual for refusing to provide\n‘testimonial’ evidence.”  Davis, 2012 WL 4813837, at *14.  Whether refusal to\nprovide testimonial evidence may contribute to reasonable suspicion of trespass is\na distinct issue, and one not raised by the parties at this stage of the litigation.\n343 App. A ¶ 4.\n344 See id.\n102\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 103 of 157\nThe responses of the police officers as summarized in the decline to\nprosecute forms do not tell a surprising story.  Indeed, they are what a reasonable\nperson would have expected under the circumstances.  When a person considers\nwalking away from an officer who has stopped her and begun asking accusatory\nquestions, it is objectively reasonable for the stopped person to believe that the\nofficer will attempt to prevent her from doing so.  Persons who are stopped by the\npolice in circumstances like those described by plaintiffs reasonably conclude that\nthey are not free to terminate the encounter.  As a result, such stops are Terry stops\nunder the Fourth Amendment,  and DeBour Level 3 stops under New York state\nlaw, and require that the officer have a “reasonable suspicion” that criminal\nactivity may be afoot.\nSecond, all but two of the eleven stops to which plaintiffs testified\nappear to have been based on suspicion of trespass, but lacked the reasonable\nsuspicion of trespass needed to support a stop.  The two exceptions are Jerome\nGrant’s stop and Letitia Ledan’s second stop, for the reasons suggested above.345\n345 In Grant’s case, his cousin’s or his friend’s knocking loudly and\nperhaps angrily on the door of a Clean Halls building may have provided a\nminimal level of objective justification for suspecting that Grant and the others\nwere attempting to enter unlawfully.  See supra Part IV.A.2.d.  Ledan initiated her\nsecond stop by asking the officers what was going on, and depending on the reason\nfor the detention of her husband and friends, her interest may have provided\nadequate grounds for brief questioning.  See supra Part IV.A.2.f.\n103\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 104 of 157\niii. Decline to Prosecute Forms\nThere remains the question of how widespread the practice of\nunlawful stops was.  Plaintiffs argue that the decline to prosecute forms\nindependently support the finding of a widespread practice of unlawful stops\noutside of TAP buildings.346  Their rather complicated argument proceeds as\nfollows:  First, plaintiffs assume the City’s expert was correct in reporting that\napproximately thirteen percent of the trespass stops analyzed by Dr. Fagan resulted\nin arrest.347  From this, plaintiffs infer a rough, general rule that thirteen percent of\ntrespass stops in the Bronx in 2011 resulted in arrest — or in other words, for every\nrecorded trespass arrest, there were roughly 7.7 trespass stops.348  Second, in three\nrandomly selected months in 2011, the Bronx DA’s office produced at least\ntwenty-six decline to prosecute forms describing arrests that were apparently based\nonly on a person entering or exiting a TAP building.349  Because entry or exit from\n346 See Pl. Findings ¶ 17.\n347 See Smith Report at 6.  \n348 See Pl. Findings ¶ 17.\n349 See supra Part IV.A.1.  In the absence of more detailed evidence or\ntestimony regarding the initial police encounters described in the decline to\nprosecute forms, I assume that the encounters were likely similar to those\ndescribed by plaintiffs, and thus that the intrusiveness of the encounters likely rose\nto the level of a Terry stop at or shortly after the time that the officer or officers\ninitiated questioning.  See generally App. A.  I also note that in many of the\n104\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 105 of 157\na TAP building does not provide reasonable suspicion, there were at least twenty-\nsix arrests in the three sample months that were preceded by stops that were not\nbased on reasonable suspicion.  Third, if the twenty-six decline to prosecute forms\nreflect only thirteen percent of the suspicionless trespass stops outside TAP\nbuildings in the three sample months in 2011, and if the sample months were\nrepresentative of the year, then eight hundred trespass stops took place outside\nTAP buildings in the Bronx in 2011 without reasonable suspicion.350\nAssuming as I do that the decline to prosecute forms contain largely\naccurate descriptions of stops, plaintiffs’ reasoning is persuasive.  If anything,\nplaintiffs undercount the number of suspicionless stops suggested by the decline to\nprosecute forms.  Dr. Smith’s thirteen percent figure is the arrest rate for all the\ntrespass stops outside TAP buildings in Dr. Fagan’s study, including both stops\nbased on and stops lacking reasonable suspicion.351  Common sense would suggest,\nhowever, that the arrest rate for stops lacking reasonable suspicion — for example,\nencounters described in the decline to prosecute forms, the defendant’s behavior as\ndescribed in the form never gave rise to reasonable suspicion, even after the stop\nbegan.  See App. A ¶¶ 2, 3, 8, 11, 12, 16, 17, 21, 24.\n350 I have altered plaintiffs’ calculations to account for the two decline to\nprosecute forms containing revisions of other forms.  See supra Part IV.A.1.\n351 See Smith Report at 6.  Dr. Fagan calculated arrest rates (or, as he\ncalled them, “hit rates”) in Floyd, but does not appear to have done so in the instant\ncase.  Compare Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 284–85, with Fagan Report. \n105\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 106 of 157\nstops based on nothing more than a person exiting a TAP building — should be\nsignificantly lower than the combined arrest rate for lawful and unlawful stops. \nThe lower the arrest rate for unlawful stops, the higher the number of unlawful\nstops that would be required to generate twenty-six arrests based on such stops.  If\nthe arrest rate for unlawful stops were five percent, for example, the existence of\ntwenty-six arrests in three months based on unlawful stops would imply a yearly\ntotal of more than two thousand (2,080) unlawful stops.\niv. Dr. Fagan’s Analysis\nDr. Fagan’s analysis of the UF-250 database provides further evidence\nthat plaintiffs have a clear likelihood of being able to prove at trial that the\nNYPD’s practice of unlawful stops was widespread.  In order to understand Dr.\nFagan’s claim that 1,044 trespass stops within his set apparently lacked reasonable\nsuspicion, it is necessary to understand the basic features of a UF-250 form.352  I\nhave included a copy of a blank UF-250 form as Appendix B to this Opinion.\nThe UF-250 form has two sides.353  On Side 1 there is a section\nlabeled “What Were Circumstances Which Led To Stop? (MUST CHECK AT\nLEAST ONE BOX).”  Inside the section are several boxes that officers may check,\n352 See Fagan Report at 15 & tbl.8; App. L to Fagan Report (“Stop Factor\nList”), Pl. Ex. 64.\n353 See App. B.\n106\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 107 of 157\nsuch as “Fits Description” and “Actions Indicative of Acting As A Lookout.” \nThere is also a checkbox for “Other Reasonable Suspicion Of Criminal Activity\n(Specify)” (the “Other” box) that officers can check and then supplement with a\nhandwritten note.  On the back of the form, Side 2, there is a section labeled\n“Additional Circumstances/Factors: (Check All That Apply).”  Inside this section\nthere are other checkboxes, such as “Report From Victim/Witness” and “Evasive,\nFalse Or Inconsistent Response To Officer’s Questions.”  As noted above, officers\nare required to record all the reasons justifying a stop.354\nIn an appendix to Dr. Fagan’s report, he lists the combinations of\nfactors from UF-250 forms that he counted as indicative of a stop apparently\nlacking reasonable suspicion of trespass.355  The list descends from the most\ncommon combinations of factors to the least common.356  On all of the forms that\nDr. Fagan identified as apparently lacking reasonable suspicion, the officer had\n354 See Def. Findings ¶ 4 (“NYPD training evidence . . . clearly identifies\nthat its officers are instructed to include all circumstances leading to the stop on the\nworksheet[.]” (citing Tr. 10/15 at 86:12–87:2)); Tr. 10/19 at 849:13–19 (testimony\nof Chief Shea); Police Student’s Guide at 20.\n355 See Fagan Report at 15 & tbl.8; Stop Factor List.\n356 See Stop Factor List at 1.

First, on Side 1, the officer offered one of the following\nthree factors:\n1)  “Furtive Movements.”\n357 See Fagan Report at 11–15.\n358 See id.\n359 See Stop Factor List at 1.\n360 See id.\n361 See id.\n108\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 109 of 157\n2)  “Other Reasonable Suspicion Of Criminal Activity (Specify)” (the\n“Other” box), and a text string referring to “Clean Halls,” “Trespass,”\nor both as the sole notation.362 \n3) The “Other” box and words indicating the suspect was observed\nexiting the building.363\nSecond, on Side 2, under “Additional Circumstances/Factors,” the\nofficer either checked no box, or offered one of the following five justifications:\n1) High Crime Area.\n2) “Time Of Day, Day Of Week, Season Corresponding To Reports Of\nCriminal Activity” (the “Time of Day” box).\n3)  Both High Crime Area and Time of Day.\n4) “Proximity To Crime Location” (the “Proximity to Scene” box).\n5) “Changing Direction At Sight Of Officer/Flight” (the “Change\nDirection” box).\n362 See Fagan Report at 13 (explaining “Clean Halls/Trespass” category);\n“detailSA Stop Factor Analysis” (“‘Other’ Text Strings”), App. F to Fagan Report\nat 5–6 (listing the text strings in this category, including “CLEAN HALLS,”\n“CLEAN HALLS BLDG,” “CRIM TRES,” and “CLEAN HALLS PROGRAM-\nCRIM TRES”).\n363 See “Other” Text Strings at 7–8 (listing text strings in the “Observed\nExit” category, including many variations on the phrase “EXITING CLEAN\nHALLS BUILDING”).\n109\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 110 of 157\nStanding alone, Dr. Fagan’s categorizations leave a great deal of room\nfor skepticism.  The Supreme Court has “recognized that nervous, evasive behavior\nis a pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion.”364  It is possible to\nimagine scenarios in which an officer observing behavior that would probably give\nrise to reasonable suspicion might reasonably record that behavior by checking\nnothing more than “Furtive Movements.”  For example, an officer might observe a\nperson standing nervously outside a TAP building, pretending to walk away\nwhenever others approach, then returning after they are gone, and finally entering\nthe building without a key, nervously looking both ways before opening the door. \nI also note that in each of the twenty stops where the officer checked “Change\n364 Wardlow, 528 U.S. at 124 (citing numerous cases).  On the other\nhand, “furtive behavior absent additional indicia of suspicion generally does not\nsuffice to establish reasonable suspicion.”  United States v. Bellamy, 592 F. Supp.\n2d 308, 318–19 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (collecting cases).  In Bellamy, the court held that\nthe following stop factors did not give rise to reasonable suspicion that Bellamy\nwas trespassing in a building:\n(1) the officers’ knowledge that the . . . building was located in a\nhigh-crime, drug-prone neighborhood; (2) the officers’ knowledge\nthat  the  .  .  .  building  had  experienced  problems  with  drug\ntrafficking and trespassing; (3) the officers’ understanding that the\nbuilding had participated in FTAP; (4) Bellamy’s presence in the\n[building’s] vestibule; (5) the presence of the supposed “crack\naddict” outside of the . . . building; and (6) Bellamy’s furtive\ngestures.\nId. at 317.\n110\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 111 of 157\nDirection” on Side 2, the officer also checked “Furtive Movement” on Side 1.365  If\nthese forms were based on an officer seeing someone engage in the behavior\ndescribed above, and then run away at the sight of the officer, the officer almost\ncertainly had reasonable suspicion of trespass.366\nOn the other hand, there are good reasons to doubt that most, or even\nmany, of the forms marked with the combinations listed above were in fact based\non such suspicious behavior.  First, many of the 503 forms in the top ten on Dr.\nFagan’s list contain stop factor combinations providing no basis whatsoever for\nreasonable suspicion.  205 of these forms simply indicate that the person was\nstopped outside a Clean Halls building, or for criminal trespass, neither of which\nexplains why the officer’s suspicion was reasonable; or that the person was\nobserved exiting, which also contributes nothing to reasonable suspicion; and that\nthe stop took place in a high crime area and/or at a suspicious time of day, neither\nof which can establish reasonable suspicion in the absence of some additional\n365 See Stop Factor List.\n366 See Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 298 (discussing Wardlow, which “held\nthat a defendant’s ‘presence in an area of heavy narcotics trafficking’ and\n‘unprovoked flight upon noticing the police’ were together sufficient to raise\nreasonable suspicion and justify a stop” (quoting Wardlow, 528 U.S. at 124)).\n111\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 112 of 157\ncontributing factor.367  Thus, at a bare minimum, over two hundred of the five\nhundred stops at the top of Dr. Fagan’s list provide no basis for a finding of\nsuspicious behavior.\nSecond, Dr. Fagan reported that in his original universe of stops,\nofficers had checked the Other box on nearly forty percent of the UF-250 forms.368 \nOfficers were clearly willing and able to describe suspicious behavior when they\nobserved it.369  In fact, officers frequently took the time to write notes that do not\ncontribute to reasonable suspicion.370  Given the evident eagerness of officers to\ncheck the Other box and write notes — even when they had no basis for doing so\n— it is doubtful that many officers observed the kind of highly suspicious behavior\nhypothesized above and then merely checked the Furtive Movements box.371\n367 “Reasonable articulable suspicion does not exist merely on the basis\nof [High Crime Area and Time of Day]:  many people live in high crime areas and\nmany crimes occur at night; simply being in a high crime area at night is not\nsuspicious behavior.”  Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 298 (citations omitted). \n368 See Fagan Report at 11.\n369 See, e.g., “Other” Text Strings at 7 (“Observed Entry” text strings\nincluding, for example, “RAN INTO BLDG”).  The NYPD Legal Bureau’s\nPowerPoint presentation at Rodman’s Neck contains a number of examples of\nconcise, easily written descriptions of furtive behavior that could give rise to\nreasonable suspicion.  See Street Encounters Presentation at 22–23.\n370 See id. (listing text strings accompanying checked Other boxes).\n371 In addition, many behaviors that would, like the behaviors\nhypothesized above, lead to a suspicion of trespass would presumably also provide\n112\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 113 of 157\nThird, as Dr. Fagan notes, when police officers are in an area where\nthey are primed to look for signs that “crime is afoot,” they may be more likely to\nperceive a gesture as an indicator of criminality.372  Recent psychological research\nhas provided evidence of such cognitive distortions.373  Thus the category of\nFurtive Movements may be inherently prone to overuse on UF-250s.  Given the\nnature of their work on patrol, officers may have a systematic tendency to see and\nreport furtive movements where none objectively exist.374  \nDr. Fagan raised further doubts in Floyd regarding the general validity\nof assuming reasonable suspicion based on Furtive Movements.375  Dr. Fagan’s\nreport in Floyd showed that “the arrest rates in stops where the high crime area or\ngrounds to check “Actions Indicative [o]f ‘Casing’ Victim Or Location” or\n“Actions Indicative of Acting As A Lookout” on Side 1.

Supp. 2d at 285 (emphasis added).\n377 See Def. Findings ¶¶ 6 (“Period of Observation”), 8 (metacategories\nfor “Other” text strings), 9 (“Furtive Movements,”“Ongoing Investigation”).\n378 See id. ¶ 6; App. B.\n379 See Def. Findings ¶ 6.  According to the UF-250 database, in sixty-\nfive percent of the trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx in 2011, the\nPeriod of Observation was less than one minute, and in eighty-four percent of\nthose stops, the period of observation was less than two minutes.  See Period of\nObservation Table.  Only five of the 1,044 unlawful stops identified by Dr. Fagan\ninvolved periods of observation of greater than ten minutes.  See Table 15:\nDistribution of Period of Observation, Pl.

That is, even if defendants’ arguments on these points are\n380 See Def. Findings ¶ 8; Smith Report at 34–39.  Neither Dr. Smith nor\ndefendants offer a total of the number of stops contested by Dr. Smith in this way. \nPlaintiffs state that Dr. Smith identified thirty-six stops with contestable text\nstrings out of Dr. Fagan’s 1,044.

Whether the percentage of trespass stops that were\nunconstitutional was thirty or sixty, and whether one assumes that officers failed to\nfill out UF-250s ten, twenty, or fifty percent of the time, plaintiffs have succeeded\nin showing a clear likelihood that they will be able to prove that the City of New\nYork and its agents displayed deliberate indifference toward the violation of the\nconstitutional rights of hundreds and more likely thousands of individuals prior to\n2012. \nv.

Stated in terms of Connick’s general standard for failure-to-\ntrain claims, plaintiffs have shown a clear likelihood of proving that city\npolicymakers were on actual notice by 2011, and constructive notice prior to then,\nthat the failure to train NYPD officers regarding the legal standard for trespass\nstops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx was causing city employees to violate the\nconstitutional rights of a large number of individuals.392  Stated in terms of the\nthree-part Walker test for deliberate indifference through failure to train, plaintiffs\nhave shown a clear likelihood of proving (1) city policymakers knew to a moral\ncertainty that NYPD officers, who regularly patrol in and around TAP buildings in\nthe Bronx, would confront the question of when it was legally permissible to stop\n390 See id. at 1359 (citing Tuttle, 471 U.S. at 822–23).\n391 Cash, 654 F.3d at 334 (quoting Reynolds, 506 F.3d at 192; Vann, 72\nF.3d at 1049).\n392 See Connick, 131 S.Ct. at 1359.\n118\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 119 of 157\npeople outside those buildings; (2) the decline to prosecute forms, ADA Rucker’s\nletters, and the hundreds of UF-250 forms that failed to articulate reasonable\nsuspicion for trespass stops outside TAP buildings provided an extensive record of\nNYPD officers mishandling these stops; and (3) when NYPD officers made the\nwrong choice in these stops, the deprivation of constitutional rights frequently\nresulted.393  Thus, plaintiffs have shown a clear likelihood of proving that city\npolicymakers should have known that their inadequate training and supervision\nregarding trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx was “‘so likely to\nresult in the violation of constitutional rights,’” that their failure to train constituted\ndeliberate indifference.394  Stated in terms of the constructive acquiescence\nstandard, plaintiffs have shown a clear likelihood of proving that there was “a\nsufficiently widespread practice among police officers” of unlawful trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings “to support reasonably the conclusion that such abuse was\nthe custom of the officers,” and that “supervisory personnel must have been aware\nof it but took no adequate corrective or preventive measures.”395  \nIn fact, plaintiffs presented some evidence suggesting that the practice\n393 See Walker, 974 F.2d at 297–98.\n394 Id. at 298 (quoting Canton, 489 U.S. at 390).\n395 Jones, 691 F.3d at 82.\n119\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 120 of 157\nof making stops outside TAP buildings without regard for reasonable suspicion\nmight have been “so persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of\nlaw.”396  In addition to the sheer magnitude of apparently unlawful stops, ADA\nRucker offered testimony suggesting that prior to her legal research into the\nstandards governing stops outside TAP buildings, she had been explicitly advising\nofficers that it was permissible to stop a person simply because he had exited a\nTAP building, so long as the officer had observed the person in the vestibule\nfirst.397  Even defendants seemed to recognize that the similarities among the stops\ndescribed in this case support the conclusion that officers’ behaviors were the\nresult of uniform training.398\nb. Failure to Rebut Deliberate Indifference Claim Based\non Steps Taken by NYPD in 2012\nDefendants spent a great deal of time at the hearing introducing\nevidence concerning steps the NYPD took in 2012 to improve TAP and provide\ntraining regarding stop and frisk practices.399  Yet in spite of receiving actual notice\n396 Connick, 131 S.Ct. at 1359. \n397 See Tr. 10/15 at 176:14–23.  \n398 See Def.

To date, as noted above, the only piece of instruction that has been\nprovided to officers on a systematic basis and that specifically targets the problem\nat issue in this case is a single bullet point in a single slide show during a single\npart of the Rodman’s Neck training.400  This has been the NYPD’s most\nmeaningful specific response to the problem that caused Charles Bradley’s\nunlawful stop and arrest, Abdullah Turner’s unlawful stop and arrest, the unlawful\nstop of J.G. that led Jaenean Ligon to fear for her son’s life, Roshea Johnson’s stop\nand interrogation in an unmarked NYPD van, all the other indignities that the other\nplaintiffs were obliged to suffer, and the hundreds of other unlawful stops,\nrecorded and unrecorded, whose precise details this Court will never know.  \nThe Rodman’s Neck bullet point is plainly insufficient to rebut\nplaintiffs’ showing of a clear likelihood of success on the merits of their deliberate\nindifference claim.  Nor did defendants provide reliable statistics regarding stops in\n400 See Street Encounters Presentation at 40; Tr. 10/17 at 572:24–573:6;\nTr. 10/18 at 663:13–664:1.\n121\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 122 of 157\n2012 that might have rebutted plaintiffs’ claim.  Defendants have provided no\nevidence that the NYPD has ceased its practice of making unlawful trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings in the Bronx.  \nThe evidence introduced by defendants of broader reforms to TAP\nand stop and frisk undertaken by the NYPD in 2012 also does not rebut plaintiffs’\ncase that city policymakers have displayed deliberate indifference to an ongoing\npractice of constitutional violations by city employees based on unlawful stops\noutside TAP buildings.  To the contrary, many of the training materials introduced\nby defendants may serve to further entrench the problem of these unconstitutional\nstops.  In some cases, defendants’ introduction of training materials not only failed\nto rebut plaintiffs’ case, but made plaintiffs’ case stronger.\nMost strikingly, within the last year the NYPD has produced a video\non stop and frisk that has now been shown in every precinct.401  Chief Shea\ntestified that “it would be fair to say that every single member of a patrol borough\nhas probably” seen the video by now.402  The video, whose script was also entered\ninto evidence, begins by briefly summarizing the four levels of police encounters\n401 See Tr. 10/19 at 900:21–904:20; Tr. 10/22 at 942:13–24; SQF\nTraining Video No. 5; Script of SQF Training Video No. 5.\n402 See Tr. 10/22 at 22–24.

A forcible stop can take many different forms.  It can be\nconstructive in nature, such as using verbal commands or blocking\na subject’s path.  Or it could be an actual stop, such as grabbing or\nholding the subject.\nThe courts will look to an officer’s actions in making this\ndetermination.  They consider: if the officer’s gun was drawn; if\nthe person was physically prevented from moving; the number\nand tone of verbal commands; the content of the commands; the\nnumber of officers present; and the location of the encounter.\nUsually just verbal commands, such as STOP, POLICE!!!,\nwill not constitute a seizure.  However, a verbal command, plus\nother actions may be considered a seizure — other actions, such\nas: using physical force to subdue a suspect; physically blocking\na suspect’s path; grabbing a suspect by the arm, shirt or coat;\npointing a gun at a suspect; using an ASP or baton to contain a\nsuspect; or placing a suspect against a wall or on the ground.403\nThis misstates the law.  It is incorrect in its specific claim that if an officer yelled\n“STOP, POLICE!!!” and the person stopped, the result would not “[u]sually”\nconstitute a Terry stop.404  Indeed, it is difficult to imagine many contexts in which\n403 Script of SQF Training Video No. 5 at 58–59 (formatting altered),\nbeginning at roughly 6:35 in SQF Training Video No. 5.\n404 Perhaps the video reflects a misunderstanding of the Supreme Court’s\nruling in Hodari D., 499 U.S. at 626–28.  Cf. Def. Findings ¶ 42 n.19 (citing\nHodari D.).  In Hodari D., the Court explained that the word “seizure” “does not\nremotely apply . . . to the prospect of a policeman yelling ‘Stop, in the name of the\n123\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 124 of 157\nan officer shouting this command, followed by the person stopping, would not\nconstitute a Terry stop.  As noted above, the test for a Terry stop is whether “a\nreasonable person would feel free ‘to disregard the police and go about his\nbusiness.’”405  If the “reasonable person” of Fourth Amendment law would feel\nfree to disregard an officer yelling “STOP, POLICE!!!” and go about his business,\nthen this “reasonable person” bears little or no resemblance to the many reasonable\npeople who have been or will be affected by the NYPD’s stop and frisk practices.\nThe video is also incorrect in its more general suggestion that an\nofficer must deploy something resembling physical force or the threat of such force\nin order for an encounter to constitute a stop.  It is true that Terry stops are\nsometimes referred to as “forcible stops.”406  But the test for a Terry stop, again, is\nnot the use of force:  it is whether a “reasonable person” would feel free “‘to\nlaw!’ at a fleeing form that continues to flee. That is no seizure.”  Id. at 626.  The\nCourt’s point was that there is no seizure unless the individual is in fact seized, in\nthe sense of being stopped, either by physical force, or by submission to the\nassertion of the officer’s authority — not that a Terry stop requires a display of\nauthority beyond shouted commands.  See Swindle, 407 F.3d at 572 (interpreting\nHodari D.).\n405 Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434 (quoting Hodari D., 499 U.S. at 628).\n406 See, e.g., Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 328 (1990) (referring to\nTerry stop as “forcible stop”).\n124\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 125 of 157\ndisregard the police and go about his business.’”407  The Second Circuit has held,\nfor example, that a stop took place where an officer twice ordered a person to “hold\non a second,” and after the second order the person stopped.408  The Second Circuit\nalso held that a stop occurred where an officer pointing a spotlight at a person said,\n“What, are you stupid?  Come here.  I want to talk to you,” and then told the\nperson to show his hands.409  In Davis, the City of New York conceded, and I held,\nthat a person was stopped when he encountered an officer in a stairway, the officer\nasked if he lived in the building, the officer asked for his ID, and then the officer\nasked him to step out of the stairwell and into the lobby.410  I also held in Davis that\na person was stopped “when she attempted to walk to the elevator, was told to\n‘come back’ by [an officer], and stopped walking,” because the officer’s “order to\n‘come back’ was an order to stop and [she] obeyed the order.”411\nIn conflict with the governing case law, the NYPD’s video gives\n407 Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434 (quoting Hodari D., 499 U.S. at 628). \n408 Simmons, 560 F.3d at 101, 105–06.\n409 Brown v. City of Oneonta, N.Y., 221 F.3d 329, 340 (2d Cir. 2000).  On\nthe other hand, the court held that where a person encountered two officers in his\ndorm lobby, and the officers asked him to show them his hands, he was not seized. \nSee id. at 341.\n410 See Davis, 2012 WL 4813837, at *5–6.\n411 Id. at *14.\n125\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 126 of 157\nofficers the false impression that Terry stops should be distinguished from less\nintrusive encounters by the kinds of elements that the video lists:  a drawn gun,\nphysical restraint, numerous commands of a restraining nature, numerous officers,\nthe use of a baton, and so on.  Elements such as these are not necessary for a police\nencounter to rise to the level of a Terry stop, nor are they characteristic of the usual\nform of Terry stops.  Indeed, many of these elements are more characteristic of an\narrest than of a Terry stop.  The Second Circuit lists the following factors as an\nindication that an arrest, and not merely a stop, has occurred:\n“the threatening presence of several officers; the display of a\nweapon;  the  physical  touching  of  the  person  by  the  officer;\nlanguage or tone indicating that compliance with the officer was\ncompulsory; prolonged retention of a person’s personal effects,\nsuch as airplane tickets or identification; and a request by the\nofficer  to  accompany  him  to  the  police  station  or  a  police\nroom.”412\nThe Second Circuit’s list of the identifying features of an arrest is remarkably\nsimilar to the training video’s list of the identifying features of a stop.  By\nincorrectly implying that encounters lacking the characteristics of an arrest are in\nfact not even stops, the video appears to train officers that they do not need\nreasonable suspicion to perform the kind of stops that under an accurate reading of\nthe law would be classified as Terry stops.  In other words, this video, which was\n412 United States v. Glover, 957 F.2d 1004, 1008 (2d Cir. 1992) (quoting\nLee, 916 F.2d at 819).\n126\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 127 of 157\nproduced in 2012, which has now been seen by nearly every officer in the patrol\nbureau, and which defendants continue to present as a sign of their lack of\ndeliberate indifference,413 trains officers that it is acceptable to perform stops that\namount to Terry stops, or possibly even arrests, without reasonable suspicion.  \nOther evidence introduced to rebut plaintiffs’ deliberate indifference\nclaim similarly supports the conclusion that the NYPD is training its officers to\nmiscategorize many arrests as stops, and many stops as something less than stops. \nThe Chief of Patrol Field Training Unit Program Guide, which is distributed to\nsupervisors in Operation IMPACT,414 reflects another subtle but significant\nproblem — namely a tendency to exaggerate how intrusive a police encounter must\nbe in order to constitute a Terry stop.  The Guide states that with something less\nthan reasonable suspicion,415 an officer may approach a person and engage in\n“pointed, invasive, and accusatory” questioning that is “intended to elicit an\nincriminating response,” and even “ask for permission” to search the person.416 \n413 See Def. Findings ¶ 42.\n414 See Tr. 10/19 at 744:2–6.\n415 Using the language of De Bour Level 2, not Level 3, the Training\nGuide requires a “founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot” in order to\napproach and engage in an encounter of this kind.  See Training Guide at 17.\n416 Id. (emphases omitted).  The Guide clarifies that the officer “may not\ntouch the person, display a weapon, or act in a threatening manner,” but notes that\n127\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 128 of 157\nWhile “[t]he Fourth Amendment does not proscribe all contact between the police\nand citizens,”417 it is difficult to imagine many circumstances in which a reasonable\nperson being aggressively interrogated by the police regarding suspected criminal\nactivity could feel free “‘to disregard the police and go about his business.’”418  The\nmore realistic outcome would be for the person to assume that if he refused to\nanswer, walked away, gave the wrong answers, or made a false move, serious\nconsequences would follow.419  As Abdullah Turner testified, “I don’t know\nanyone . . . who ever just walked away from a cop in the middle of a\nconversation.”420  Given the high stakes of any encounter in which an officer\ninterrogates someone regarding his suspected criminal activity, it is fanciful to say\nthat a reasonable person would as a rule feel free in the midst of such an\n“[i]f a confronted citizen walks away without answering, the officer may follow to\ncontinue questioning.”  See id. at 17–18.\n417 Delgado, 466 U.S. at 215.\n418 Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434 (quoting Hodari D., 499 U.S. at 628). \n419 Indeed, based on the accounts of stops in the decline to prosecute\nforms, this appears to be an accurate expectation.  See App. A ¶¶ 12, 20, discussed\nbelow.  Moreover, it would not be surprising to learn that based on the experiences\nof their families, friends, and neighbors, the residents of these buildings fully\nappreciate the consequences that will follow if they attempt to walk away from the\npolice during questioning.\n420 Tr. 10/17 at 491:22–23.\n128\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 129 of 157\ninterrogation to “‘terminate the encounter’”421 at will.  \nA lesson on TAP that was added to the Guide in 2012 similarly\nreflects a model of policing in which the investigative questioning of suspects\nroutinely precedes rather than follows reasonable suspicion:\nA uniformed member of the service may not stop (temporarily\ndetain)  a  suspected  trespasser  unless  the  uniformed  member\nreasonably suspects that the person is in the building without\nauthority.  . . .  Some factors which may contribute to “reasonable\nsuspicion”  that  a  person  is  trespassing  .  .  .  are  contradictory\nassertions  made  to  justify  presence  in  the  building  and/or\nassertions  lacking  credibility  made  to  justify  presence  in  the\nbuilding.422\n421 Drayton, 536 U.S. at 202 (quoting Bostick, 501 U.S. at 436).\n422 Training Guide at 65; Tr. 10/19 at 743:6–7.  I recognize that many of\nthe NYPD’s training materials purport to derive from De Bour, as defendants have\nemphasized.  See, e.g., Def. Findings ¶ 42 & n.19.  Because plaintiffs have brought\ntheir case under the Fourth Amendment, and not New York law, Pl. Findings\n¶¶ 64–71, it would lie beyond the scope of this Opinion to make general statements\nregarding the precise relations between the law of De Bour and the case law\ninterpreting the Fourth Amendment.  I note, however, that in theory, De Bour\nshould provide greater protection than the Fourth Amendment by restricting police\naction even in encounters whose level of invasiveness falls below the minimum\nthreshold for Fourth Amendment scrutiny.  See, e.g., De Bour, 40 N.Y.2d at 381\n(prohibiting any investigative encounter, even at Level 1, if it is based on “intent to\nharrass” or “mere whim, caprice, or idle curiosity”). \nSome commentators have expressed skepticism regarding the practical\nvirtues of De Bour’s multi-level analysis.  LaFave questions whether De Bour’s\nmore sophisticated articulation of Terry’s balancing approach is advantageous, or\nis likely to result in “such confusion and uncertainty that neither police nor courts\ncan ascertain with any degree of confidence precisely what it takes to meet any of\nthese standards.”  LAFAVE, SEARCH & SEIZURE § 9.4(e).  Accord Emily J. Sack,\nPolice Approaches and Inquiries on the Streets of New York: The Aftermath of\n129\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 130 of 157\nInstead of reasonable suspicion providing a basis for investigative questioning, the\nNYPD’s training materials suggest that the standard scenario is for investigative\nquestioning to lead to reasonable suspicion.  The NYPD Legal Bureau’s\nPowerPoint presentation at Rodman’s Neck similarly suggests that even when an\nofficer lacks reasonable suspicion for a stop, the officer may not only approach and\nask accusatory questions, but during the encounter may “place [his] hand on [his]\nholstered firearm” or “draw and conceal” his weapon, all without escalating the\nencounter to a Terry stop.423  \nWhat is most troubling about these materials is not the suggestion that\nPeople v. De Bour, 66 N.Y.U. L. REV. 512, 520, 548–53 (1991) (arguing that “the\ncourts routinely conflate the De Bour standards and use inappropriately low levels\nof suspicion to justify police intrusions,” and that “the multitiered structure of the\nDe Bour model allows inadequately justified low-level intrusions to escalate\nquickly into inappropriate forcible stops and arrests”).  See also Anthony G.\nAmsterdam, Perspectives on the Fourth Amendment, 58 MINN. L. REV. 349, 394\n(1974) (a “sliding scale approach” to the Fourth Amendment may “produce more\nslide than scale”).  \nThe NYPD’s training materials may illustrate the risk created by the\nmulti-level doctrine of De Bour.  The mere existence of De Bour Level 2, and the\ninevitable difficulty of clearly distinguishing an encounter on the more intrusive\nend of Level 2 from an encounter on the less intrusive end of Level 3, creates\nproblems of administrability.  In practice, the possibility of classifying a stop as\nLevel 2 or even Level 1 may lead police to perform a large number of stops — in\nthe ordinary sense of the word, but inevitably often in the Terry sense as well —\nwithout the minimal foundation in reasonable suspicion required by the U.S.\nConstitution.\n423 Street Encounters Presentation at 16, 19.\n130\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 131 of 157\ninvestigative questioning might under certain circumstances lawfully precede\nreasonable suspicion, but that it should do so as a matter of course, routinely, as the\nrule rather than the exception.  If the difference between a Terry stop and a less\nintrusive encounter hinges on indefinite factors such as the demeanor and\npositioning of the officers; and if it is safe to assume that officers routinely display\ntheir authority and power through aggressive behavior, as many of the officers did\nin their encounters with plaintiffs in the instant case; then a training program that\ninvites officers to approach large numbers of people and question them without\nreasonable suspicion will inevitably result in frequent Terry stops that lack\nreasonable suspicion, effectively guaranteeing the commission of widespread\nconstitutional violations.  The evidence of numerous unlawful stops at the hearing\nstrengthens the conclusion that the NYPD’s inaccurate training has taught officers\nthe following lesson:  stop and question first, develop reasonable suspicion later.424\nThe NYPD’s training failures may also help to explain why no UF-\n250s were located for any of the plaintiffs in the instant case.  Based on training\n424 I note that the NYPD’s stop practices also appear to conflict with the\nconsidered judgment of the New York State Legislature, which enacted New\nYork’s stop and frisk law.  This law states that without a warrant, “a police officer\nmay stop a person . . . when he reasonably suspects that such person is committing,\nhas committed, or is about to commit” a crime, “and may demand of him his name,\naddress and an explanation of his conduct.”  CPL § 140.50.  In other words, the\nNew York State Legislature envisioned reasonable suspicion preceding the request\nfor a name, address, and purpose.\n131\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 132 of 157\nmaterials like those above, the officers who stopped plaintiffs may very well have\nperceived themselves as not engaged in Terry stops at all, but in something less\nintrusive.  The NYPD Legal Bureau’s PowerPoint presentation at Rodman’s Neck\ncontinues to encourage this belief, and the constitutional violations that will\nnaturally follow from it, by redefining the standards for stops and arrests.  Thus,\nthe final slide on arrests states:  “If you are at probable cause, you have made an\narrest.”425  This is not correct.  If you have arrested someone, you have made an\narrest; whether or not you had probable cause only determines whether the arrest\nwas constitutional.  Similarly, the presentation states:  “When an individual is\nstopped based upon Reasonable Suspicion a UF-250 must be prepared.”426  IO 22\nof 2012 offers a similar message:  “When reasonable suspicion exists, a STOP,\nQUESTION AND FRISK REPORT WORKSHEET shall be prepared . . . .”  Both of\nthese statements are incorrect.  Whether a stop constitutes a Terry stop and thus\nrequires the completion of a UF-250 form does not depend on whether the stop is\nbased on reasonable suspicion, but on whether a reasonable person would have felt\nfree to terminate the encounter.427\n425 Street Encounters Presentation at 37 (capitalization altered).\n426 Id. at 33 (emphasis altered).\n427 See Drayton, 536 U.S. at 202.\n132\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 133 of 157\nIn response to criticisms directed at the NYPD’s training materials,\ndefendants have argued that the materials reflect New York state law, and in\nparticular De Bour and its progeny.428  Defendants assert that “New York Law\napplies” in the instant case.429  But practices that violate the Fourth Amendment\ncannot be saved by proving that they comply with state law.430  To the extent that\nDe Bour suggests a police officer, without reasonable suspicion, may lawfully stop\nand question an individual in such a way that a reasonable person would not feel\nfree to terminate the encounter, that suggestion would be incorrect.\n2. Irreparable Harm\nIn addition to showing a clear likelihood of success on the merits,\nplaintiffs have the burden of showing that they are “likely to suffer irreparable\nharm in the absence of preliminary relief.”431  Plaintiffs have moved for class\n428 See, e.g., Def. Findings ¶ 42 & n.19.\n429 Id.\n430 As I noted in the Introduction, the Supreme Court held in Sibron that\n“New York is, of course, free to develop its own law of search and seizure to meet\nthe needs of local law enforcement.  . . .  It may not, however, authorize police\nconduct which trenches upon Fourth Amendment rights, regardless of the labels\nwhich it attaches to such conduct.”  392 U.S. at 60–61.  Sibron makes clear that\nany conflict between the Fourth Amendment and New York state law must be\nresolved in favor of the Fourth Amendment.\n431 Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.\n133\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 134 of 157\ncertification in connection with their motion for a preliminary injunction. \nPlaintiffs’ putative class is “comprised of individuals who have been or are at risk\nof being subjected to the New York City Police Department’s practice of stopping\nindividuals outside of buildings enrolled in Operation Clean Halls in the Bronx on\nsuspicion of trespassing inside those buildings.”432 \nWhile I have not yet ruled on plaintiffs’ motion, “[i]t is well\nestablished that ‘[c]ertain circumstances give rise to the need for prompt injunctive\nrelief for a named plaintiff or on behalf of a class’ and that the ‘court may\nconditionally certify the class or otherwise award a broad preliminary injunction,\nwithout a formal class ruling, under its general equity powers.’”433  Based on the\nconclusions in the preceding section, the putative class in this case is threatened\nwith imminent violations of their constitutional rights in the absence of preliminary\nrelief.434  The frequency of unconstitutional trespass stops outside Clean Halls\nbuildings reflected in the decline to prosecute forms and Dr. Fagan’s report\n432 Class Mem. at 1.\n433 Strouchler v.

It is partly out of concern for defendants’\nhardships that I have rejected some of plaintiffs’ proposed remedies.439  \nNevertheless, the burden on putative class members of continued unconstitutional\nstops goes far beyond administrative inconvenience.  As I stated in Floyd:  \nThe right to physical liberty has long been at the core of our\nnation’s commitment to respecting the autonomy and dignity of\neach person:  “No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully\nguarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to\nthe  possession  and  control  of  his  own  person,  free  from  all\nrestraint  or  interference  of  others,  unless  by  clear  and\nunquestionable authority of law.”440\nEliminating the threat that the kinds of stops described by plaintiffs might occur at\nany moment, without legal justification, in the vicinity of one’s home and the\nhomes of one’s friends and family, is itself an important interest deserving of\njudicial protection.\nEqually important are the potential consequences of an unlawful stop. \nThe stakes of “field interrogation”441 by the police have dramatically risen since\nTerry was decided in 1968.  The use of incarceration has increased, sentences have\n439 See Pl. Findings ¶¶ 73–75.\n440 Floyd, 283 F.R.D. at 158–59 (quoting Union Pac. R. Co. v.

If an unjustified stop happens to\nlead to an unjustified arrest for trespassing, as it did in Charles Bradley’s case, not\nevery overburdened public defender will have the wherewithal to obtain a\nnotarized letter from the defendant’s host explaining that the defendant was\ninvited, as Bronx Defender Cara Suvall did on behalf of Bradley.442  When\nconsidering the relative hardships faced by the parties, it is important to consider\nthe potentially dire and long-lasting consequences that can follow from\nunconstitutional stops.443\n442 See Tr. 10/16 at 269:2–9; Rappa Letter.\n443 Though it is unnecessary to reach the issue in this Opinion, I note that\nthe appropriate form of Fourth Amendment analysis may differ depending on the\nquantity and nature of stops being scrutinized, and the remedies available.  Not\nonly are the consequences of stops different today than they were in 1968, but the\nfrequency of stops is far higher as well.  See Floyd, 283 F.R.D. at 159 (over 2.8\nmillion stops by NYPD between 2004 and 2009).  As the stops have increased in\nfrequency, they have also become more standardized and predictable.  In Terry, the\nSupreme Court emphasized “the myriad daily situations in which policemen and\ncitizens confront each other on the street.”  Terry, 392 U.S. at 12.  “No judicial\nopinion can comprehend the protean variety of the street encounter, and we can\nonly judge the facts of the case before us.”  Id. at 15.  In the instant case, by\ncontrast, the contested police encounters are strikingly uniform.  The stops in the\ndecline to prosecute forms echo the stops of plaintiffs, which in turn echo aspects\nof the training materials introduced at the hearing.  See, e.g., IO 22 of 2012 at 2\n137\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 138 of 157\nWeighing the equities in light of the totality of the circumstances, the\nadministrative burdens that defendants will face in revising the NYPD’s policies\nand training materials are real, but are outweighed by plaintiffs’ interest in not\nbeing subjected to unconstitutional stops outside their homes and the homes of\ntheir family and friends.\n4. Public Interest\nAny preliminary injunction must be “in the public interest.”444  Courts\n(¶ 11).  Terry envisions street stops as uniquely tailored to unforeseen\ncircumstances.  The stops in the instant case are more like the products of fixed,\nrepeatable processes.  The NYPD training materials that teach these processes can\nbe scrutinized in ways that an individual officer’s discretionary act cannot. \nBecause of this, a different constitutional analysis may be appropriate. \nIn addition, the constitutional framework for the ex post evaluation of\nhighly individualized, discretionary stops, where exclusion is the only remedy,\nmay not be appropriate to the ex ante evaluation of routinized, highly scripted,\nlargely predictable stops, where the remedy can involve changes in training. \nUltimately, “the central inquiry under the Fourth Amendment” is “the\nreasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of\na citizen’s personal security.”  Terry, 392 U.S. at 19.  An invasion of privacy that is\nreasonable when it occurs on an ad hoc basis and is weighed in the context of the\nexclusionary rule may not be reasonable when it occurs as a matter of\nprogrammatic policy on a far larger scale. \nTerry itself seems to invite scrutiny of stops falling below the\nintrusiveness of Terry stops, provided that the remedies applied are less severe than\nthe exclusion of evidence.  “[O]f course, our approval of legitimate and restrained\ninvestigative conduct undertaken on the basis of ample factual justification should\nin no way discourage the employment of other remedies than the exclusionary rule\nto curtail abuses for which that sanction may prove inappropriate.”  Terry, 392\nU.S. at 15.\n444 Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.\n138\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 139 of 157\nhave no special institutional competence in determining what the public interest is,\nand the parties presented little evidence at the hearing directly addressing this\nissue.  Nevertheless, the public interests at issue in plaintiffs’ motion are familiar\nfrom a long line of cases concerning “the power of the police to ‘stop and frisk’ . . .\nsuspicious persons.”445  In these cases, there is a recurring conflict between liberty\nand dignity on the one hand, and safety on the other.446  \nBecause any member of the public could conceivably find herself\noutside a TAP building in the Bronx, the public at large has a liberty and dignity\ninterest in bringing an end to the practice of unconstitutional stops at issue in this\ncase.  Even if the constitutional violations described by plaintiffs were confined to\nthe members of a discrete community, the public has a clear interest in protecting\nthe constitutional rights of all its members.  At the same time, enforcing\nconstitutional restrictions on the NYPD’s ability to stop and potentially frisk\npeople outside TAP buildings could conceivably inhibit the NYPD’s ability to\nprovide security to the residents of those buildings and their communities.\nIn light of these considerations, and taking account of all the evidence\npresented at the hearing, I find that the public interest lies with the enforcement of\n445 Terry, 392 U.S. at 10.\n446 See Davis, 2012 WL 4813837, at *1.\n139\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 140 of 157\nthe Constitution.  It is “‘clear and plain’”447 that the public interest in liberty and\ndignity under the Fourth Amendment trumps whatever modicum of added safety\nmight theoretically be gained from the NYPD making unconstitutional trespass\nstops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx.  I am not ordering the abolition or even\na reduction of TAP, which appears to be a valuable way of using the NYPD’s\nresources to enhance the security in voluntarily enrolled private buildings.448  My\nruling today is directed squarely at a category of stops lacking reasonable\nsuspicion.  Precisely because these stops lack rational justification, they are\npresumably of less value to public safety than would be the stops of individuals\nwho displayed objectively suspicious behavior.\nC. Appropriate Scope of Injunctive Relief\nInjunctive relief “‘should be narrowly tailored to fit specific legal\nviolations.’”449  In addition, “great[] caution is appropriate where a federal court is\nasked to interfere by means of injunctive relief with a state’s executive functions, a\n447 Reynolds, 506 F.3d at 198 (quoting Rizzo v.

Banas, 658 F.3d 254, 272 (2d Cir. 2011)\n(quoting Patsy’s Brand, Inc. v. I.O.B. Realty, Inc., 317 F.3d 209, 220 (2d Cir.\n2003)).  Accord City of New York v.

As I stated in Floyd, safeguarding the liberties guaranteed under\nthe Fourth Amendment “is quintessentially the role of the judicial branch.”452  \nIn light of these considerations, as well as the findings of fact and\nconclusions of law detailed above, I impose the following preliminary relief:\n1. Immediate Relief\n450 Reynolds, 506 F.3d at 198.\n451 Some recent scholarship has argued that the NYPD’s stop and frisk\nprogram may be partly responsible for the decline in crime in New York City in\nrecent decades.  See FRANKLIN E. ZIMRING, THE CITY THAT BECAME SAFE: NEW\nYORK’S LESSONS FOR URBAN CRIME AND ITS CONTROL (2011).  The issue in this\ncase, however, is not whether trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx\nare effective at reducing crime, but whether they are constitutional.  No matter how\neffective a police practice may be, if it violates the Fourth Amendment, the\nConstitution requires the government to find other means of achieving its goals. \nFor example, while preventive detention might be an effective law enforcement\ntool, police departments are not allowed to employ it, because doing so would\nviolate the Constitution.\n452 Floyd, 283 F.R.D. at 159.\n141\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 142 of 157\nThe NYPD is ordered immediately to cease performing trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings in the Bronx without reasonable suspicion of trespass, in\naccordance with the law as set forth and clarified in this Opinion.453  To\nsummarize:  as the Fourth Amendment has been interpreted by the U.S. Supreme\nCourt and the Second Circuit, an encounter between a police officer and a civilian\nconstitutes a Terry stop whenever a reasonable person would not feel free to\n“‘terminate the encounter.’”454  The stops in this case illustrate that the threat or use\nof force is not a necessary or even typical element of Terry stops.  Encounters\ninvolving nothing more than commands or accusatory questioning can and\nroutinely do rise to the level of Terry stops, provided that the commands and\nquestioning would lead a reasonable person to conclude he was not free to\n453 Defendants appear to believe that an order prohibiting stops outside\nTAP buildings that lack reasonable suspicion is “a simple command that the\ndefendant obey the law,” and thus is not legally cognizable.  See Def. Findings ¶ 54\nn.21 (quoting S.C. Johnson, Inc. v. Clorox Co., 241 F.3d 232, 240 (2d Cir. 2001)\n(interpreting Rule 65(d)).  But as I stated prior to the preliminary injunction\nhearing, “the City misapprehends the purpose of Rule 65.”  Ligon, 2012 WL\n3597066, at *3–4.   Cases like S.C. Johnson do not prohibit courts from ordering\nparties to obey the law, but rather require that such orders be specific and clear. \nSee S.C. Johnson, 241 F.3d at 240.  “[A]n injunction must ‘be specific and definite\nenough to apprise those within its scope of the conduct that is being proscribed.’” \nId. at 240–41.  The immediate relief ordered here is specific, clear, and necessary\nto correct the misconceptions of NYPD officers that led to the violations of\nconstitutional rights at issue in this case.\n454 Drayton, 536 U.S. at 202 (quoting Bostick, 501 U.S. at 436).\n142\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 143 of 157\nterminate the encounter.\nIn order for an officer to have “reasonable suspicion” that an\nindividual is engaged in criminal trespass, the officer must be able to articulate\nfacts providing “a minimal level of objective justification for making the stop,”455\nwhich means “something more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or\nhunch.’”456  In particular, an individual observed exiting or entering and exiting a\nTAP building does not establish reasonable suspicion of trespass, even if the\nbuilding is located in a high crime area, and regardless of the time of day.  For the\nreasons described above, “furtive movement” is a problematic basis for a trespass\nstop, especially when it is offered as a stand-alone justification.  If an officer is\nunable to articulate anything more specific than that a person displayed “furtive\nmovement,” including anything about the person’s furtive movement that\nsuggested trespass, then the statement that a person displayed “furtive movement”\nis nothing more than an unparticularized suspicion or hunch, and does not\nconstitute reasonable suspicion.\n2. Proposed Additional Relief\nIn addition to the immediate relief ordered above, I propose to enter\n455 Wardlow, 528 U.S. at 123.\n456 White, 496 U.S. at 329 (quoting Sokolow, 490 U.S. at 7) (certain\nquotation marks omitted).\n143\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 144 of 157\nthe preliminary relief described under the following subheadings.  I present this\nrelief as a proposal for two reasons.  First, the parties in Ligon had little\nopportunity to argue and present evidence at the preliminary injunction hearing\nconcerning the appropriate scope of relief.  Second, the preliminary relief I propose\nis similar though not identical to the relief sought by plaintiffs in the Floyd action,\nwhere I have already certified a city-wide class of plaintiffs alleging that they have\nor will be victims of unconstitutional stops.  Floyd is scheduled for trial on March\n11, 2013.  As part of the proof in that case, plaintiffs intend to present evidence\nregarding the remedies they seek.  \nBecause of the rapidly approaching trial date in Floyd and the\ninefficiency of hearing separate arguments regarding the closely related remedies\nat issue in Ligon and Floyd, I am ordering the consolidation of the remedies\nhearing in the instant case with the remedies portion of the Floyd trial.  Thus, the\nrelief proposed under the subheadings below will not take effect until the parties in\nthis case have had the opportunity to participate in a hearing at which they may\npresent evidence or argument as to whether the proposed relief is insufficient or\ntoo burdensome or otherwise inappropriate, as well as regarding the appropriate\ntimeline for relief.  This remedy hearing will be held in conjunction with the Floyd\n144\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 145 of 157\ntrial, following the phase of the trial dealing with proof of liability.457  Plaintiffs’\ncounsel in Ligon and Floyd must coordinate their presentations with respect to\nappropriate remedies.458  Submissions by counsel in Ligon related solely to\nremedies must be filed no later than February 22, 2013, and may not exceed\ntwenty-five pages per side.\na.  Policies and Procedures \nThe NYPD is ordered to develop and adopt a formal written policy\nspecifying the limited circumstances in which it is legally permissible to stop a\nperson outside a TAP building on a suspicion of trespass.  The policy must reflect\nthe fact that trespass stops outside TAP buildings are governed not only by New\nYork state law, but by the Fourth Amendment.  Guidance in drafting this policy\nshould be drawn from the legal discussion found in this Opinion.\n457 I emphasize that this ruling should in no way be taken to indicate that\nI have already concluded that plaintiffs will prevail in Floyd.  The evidence\npresented by both sides in Floyd will be judged on its own merits.  While the\nApplicable Law section of this Opinion — see supra Part III — certainly applies to\nissues raised in Floyd, the Findings of Fact section does not.  As I have noted\nthroughout this Opinion, this case relates solely to trespass stops outside of TAP\nbuildings in the Bronx.  It is only because of the unavoidable overlap between the\nsteps that are necessary to address plaintiffs’ harms in the instant case, and the\nsteps that would be necessary to address plaintiffs’ harms in Floyd if plaintiffs\nprevailed there, that I am ordering the consolidation of the remedies presentations.\n458 In the interests of efficiency, counsel in Floyd and Ligon are also\npermitted, but not required, to invite the participation of counsel in Davis in the\npresentation on appropriate remedies.\n145\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 146 of 157\nA draft of the written policy governing trespass stops outside TAP\nbuildings shall be provided to the Court (or a monitor appointed by the Court) for\napproval prior to distribution, with a copy to plaintiffs’ counsel.\nb.  Supervision\nFirst, the City is ordered to take all necessary steps to ensure that UF-\n250s are completed for every trespass stop outside a TAP building in the Bronx. \nAgain, a “stop” in the relevant sense is defined as any police encounter in which a\nreasonable person would not feel free to terminate the encounter.\nSecond, the City is ordered to implement a system of review modeled\non the one ordered by Chief Hall in paragraph 3 of Exhibit E.  Supervisory\npersonnel in each Bronx precinct must review, on a quarterly basis, each UF-250\ncompleted for a trespass stop outside a TAP building in the Bronx.  To the extent\nthat such review reveals nonconformity with the formal written policy described\nabove, the City will take specific steps to retrain the officer.  The results of these\nreviews and any retraining will be periodically reported to the relevant precinct\ncommander, a designated member of the Bronx Borough Command, a designated\nmember of the Chief of Patrol’s Office, and plaintiffs’ counsel.  Copies of all\nreviewed UF-250s shall be provided to plaintiffs’ counsel.\nc. Training\n146\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 147 of 157\nThe City is ordered to revise the NYPD’s training materials and\ntraining programs to conform with the law as set forth in this Opinion.  The\ninstruction must be sufficient to uproot the longstanding misconceptions that have\nafflicted TAP in the Bronx.  It must include, but need not be limited to, the\nfollowing reforms:  (1) The formal written policy governing trespass stops outside\nTAP buildings, described above, must be distributed to each Bronx NYPD\nmember, and then redistributed two additional times at six-month intervals. \n(2) The stop and frisk refresher course at Rodman’s Neck must be altered to\nincorporate instruction specifically targeting the problem of unconstitutional\ntrespass stops outside TAP buildings.  Whether the instruction includes additional\nslides, role-playing, or exams, it must be sufficient to convey to all officers who\nattend the course that reasonable suspicion of trespass is required before making a\ntrespass stop outside a TAP building.  Training regarding these stops must also be\nprovided to new recruits and to officers who have already attended the Rodman’s\nNeck refresher course and are not scheduled to do so again.  (3) Chapter 16 of the\nChief of Patrol Field Training Guide must be revised to reflect the formal written\npolicy governing trespass stops outside TAP buildings described above.  (4) SQF\nTraining Video No. 5 must be revised to conform with the law as set forth in this\nOpinion.  I recognize that this step, like some of the others above, will involve\n147\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 148 of 157\nalterations to training materials used outside the Bronx and outside the context of\nTAP.  But such steps are necessary to correct the longstanding misconceptions that\nled to the violations of plaintiffs’ constitutional rights described in this Opinion.\nDrafts of the written or scripted training materials described above\nshall be provided to the Court (or a monitor appointed by the Court) for approval\nprior to use, with a copy to plaintiffs’ counsel.\nd. Attorneys’ Fees\nReasonable attorneys’ fees and costs will be rewarded as appropriate,\non application.\nIn closing, I stress that my conclusions in this Opinion are based on\nthe limited evidence presented at the preliminary injunction hearing.  It could be\nthe case that the development and implementation of IOs 22 and 23 of 2012, as\nwell as the changes to NYPD training in 2012, have resolved the problem of\nunconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx.  Because these\nchanges were so recent, however, and so late in the two-decade history of TAP,\nthey were insufficient to rebut plaintiffs’ evidence at the hearing of defendants’\ndeliberate indifference to a practice of unconstitutional stops.  At any time that\ndefendants develop persuasive evidence, supported by reliable statistics, that\nunconstitutional trespass stops are no longer taking place outside TAP buildings in\n148\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 149 of 157\nthe Bronx, defendants may move for the dissolution of this preliminary injunction \nand the proposed relief. \nVI.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons explained above, plaintiffs' motion is granted, \nalthough the full extent of the relief has not yet been determined.  The Clerk of the \nCourt is directed to close this motion [Docket No. 42].

The Arresting Officer observed the defendant exit the lobby of . . . a Clean\nHalls Apartment Building, and asked defendant, why were you in the building? \nDefendant stated in sum and substance:  VISITING A FRIEND.  The Arresting\nOfficer then observed defendant to have a white powdery substance on his nose . . .\nhowever, the amount was too small to field test or recover.\nThe Arresting Officer arrested Defendant and charged him with violating\nNew York State Penal Law section 140.15 (Criminal Trespass).  However, the\nArresting Officer failed to ask defendant [redacted] you know anyone in the\nbuilding; if so, what is the person’s name and apartment number.\n2. [T]he defendants were observed exiting a clean halls building.  The\ndefendants stated that they were there to visit a tenant . . . .  After being arrested a\ntenant from the building did corroborate the defendant’s statements and the tenant\nstated that both defendants were in the building as his guests.\n3. The Arresting Officer . . . observed defendant exiting the lobby of . . . a\nClean Halls Apartment Building.  The Arresting Officer . . . approached the\ndefendant and asked the defendant do you live in the building and defendant stated\nin sum and substance: NO.  The Arresting Officer further asked the defendant what\napartment did you come from and defendant stated in sum and substance: I MET\nWITH [redacted] IN THE LOBBY.  The Arresting Officer further asked defendant\nwhat apartment does [redacted] live in and defendant stated in sum and substance:\nI DON’T KNOW THE APARTMENT NUMBER.  [Another officer then went\ninside the building and asked two people exiting if they knew anyone by the name\nof the defendant’s host.  When they said no, the defendant was arrested for\ntrespass.]\n4. . . . Arresting Officer observed defendant enter and exit a Clean Halls\nBuilding.  Arresting Officer approached the defendant and asked her where she\nwas coming [from], what was she doing in the building and what apartment\nnumber was she visiting.

[Another officer] entered the building to investigate further,\nhowever, the arresting officer was unable to articulate how [the other officer]\ndisproved [the speaking defendant’s] claim.  [Both defendants were arrested for\ntrespass.]\n9. Police Officer . . . observed the defendant exiting the lobby of . . . a Clean\nHalls Apartment Building and asked defendant whether he lived in the building\nand defendant stated in sum and substance: NO.  [The officer] then asked the\ndefendant, were you visiting anyone in the building, and defendant stated in sum\nand substance: YES.

Arresting Officer observed the defendant enter and exit the lobby of . . . a\nClean Halls Building, and radioed defendant’s description.  Arresting Officer’s\npartner asked defendant why did you go into the building, do you know anyone in\nthe building, to which defendant stated in sum and substance: I CAME OUT OF A\nFRIEND[’]S APARTMENT.  I WAS INSIDE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.  [The\ndefendant was then arrested for trespass.]\n11. [T]he arresting officer observed the defendant enter into [a Clean Halls\nbuilding] and exit after approximately five (5) minutes.  . . .\n. . .  The defendant was not observed in an area of the building that is not\nopen to the public such as the hallways, lobby and stairwells.  [The defendant was\narrested for trespass.]\n12. [A police officer] observed the defendant enter a Clean Halls Building and\nexit moments later.  . . . [W]hen the defendant exited the building, [the officer]\nasked the defendant if he lived in the building, to which the defendant stated in\nsum and substance, NO.  . . . [The officer] did not ask the defendant if he was a\nguest of a tenant in the building.  . . . [T]he defendant attempted to walk away at\nwhich time [the officer] grabbed the defendant[’]s arms, and the defendant pulled\naway.  [A struggle ensued, and the defendant was then arrested in part for\ntrespass.]\n13. [T]he defendants entered a Clean Halls building, stayed there approximately\nfive minutes, and then left.  The arresting officer stopped the defendants and asked\nthem where they were coming from.  The defendants replied, in sum and\nsubstance, WE’RE COMING FROM . . . WE’RE COMING FROM . . ., and could\nnot provide a name or apartment number.  The officer placed both defendants\nunder arrest and searched them.  \n14. The Arresting Officer observed the defendant exit the lobby of . . . a Clean\nHalls Apartment Building, approached defendant and asked, Do you live in the\nbuilding?, defendant stated in sum and substance: NO.  The Arresting Officer then\nasked the defendant, Do you know anyone in the building?, defendant stated in\nsum and substance: YES, A FRIEND.  The Arresting Officer then asked the\ndefendant, What’s your friend’s name?  What apartment does your friend live in?,\ndefendant stated in sum and substance:  I DON’T KNOW HIS NAME.  HE’S IN\n[redacted].  The Arresting Officer went to [redacted] however, the apartment was\nunoccupied, and as a result, the Arresting Officer was unable to locate anyone who\n152\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 96    Filed 01/08/13   Page 153 of 157\ncould verify defendant’s claim.  [The defendant was then arrested for trespass.]\n15. The Arresting Officer observed the defendant exit the lobby of . . . a Clean\nHalls Apartment Building and [another officer] approached defendant on the\nsidewalk and asked defendant, Do you live in the building?, and defendant stated\nin sum and substance: NO.  [The officer] asked defendant, What was your reason\nfor being in the building?, and defendant stated in sum and substance:  LOOKING\nFOR A GIRL.  [The officer] then asked the defendant, What’s the name of the\ngirl?, and defendant refused to provide an answer to the aforementioned question. \n[The defendant was then arrested for trespass.]\n16. Arresting Officer observed the defendant enter and exit the lobby of . . . a\nclean halls Building.  [The defendant was then arrested for trespass.]  However,\narresting Officer could not obtain a clean halls affidavit. \n17. [I]n front of . . . a Clean Halls building, [the arresting officer] observed\ndefendant and several unapprehended individuals exit the lobby . . . .  [The officer]\napproached defendant and asked defendant if he knew anyone in above-mentioned\nlocation and defendant stated in sum and substance: NO.  I’M JUST LOOKING\nFOR MY FRIEND [redacted].  NO [redacted] DOESN’T LIVE HERE.  [The\ndefendant was then arrested for trespass.]\n18. [D]efendant was observed entering and exiting the lobby of [a Clean Halls\nbuilding].\nArresting officer asked defendant what he was doing in the building and\ndefendant stated in sum and substance I WAS IN THE BUILDING LOOKING\nFOR WORK.  Arresting officer asked defendant what kind of work he was looking\nfor and defendant stated in sum and substance I WAS LOOKING FOR MY\nFRIEND [redacted].  Arresting officer asked defendant where his friend lived and\ndefendant stated in sum and substance I DON’T KNOW WHERE HE LIVES. \n[The defendant was then arrested for trespass.]\n19. Arresting officer observed defendant enter . . . a clean halls building and\nobserved defendant exit said building.  Arresting officer approached and asked\ndefendant, what were you doing in the building and defendant stated in sum and\nsubstance:  I WAS THERE TO VISIT A FRIEND.  I DON’T KNOW WHAT\nAPARTMENT THEY LIVE IN.

The arresting officer stopped defendant and defendant\nclenched his fists on his sides and spread his feet apart and . . . stated in sum and\nsubstance YOU’RE NOT GOING TO TOUCH ME.  YOU’RE NOT GOING TO\nTOUCH ME.  YOU’RE NOT PUTTING YOUR HANDS ON ME.  [The arresting\nofficer then handcuffed defendant and placed him in the patrol vehicle.]\n21. [D]efendant was observed entering the above location, a Clean Halls\nApartment building, and was also observed exiting said location minutes later. \nArresting police officer . . . asked defendant if he lived in the building and\ndefendant stated in sum and substance, I’M NOT THERE, I’M IN [redacted].  [The\ndefendant was then arrested for trespass.]\n22. Arresting Officer observed the defendant exit the lobby of . . . a Clean Halls\nApartment Building.  Arresting officer approached defendant and asked him, do\nyou live in the building, do you know anyone in the building, what apartment does\nyour friend live [in], what is his name[,] to which defendant stated in sum and\nsubstance:  . . . NO I DON’T, YES I’M VISITING MY FRIEND ON THE\n[redacted] FLOOR, NO I’M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU MY FRIEND’S\nNAME.  [The officer then patted down the defendant and arrested him in part for\ntrespass.]\n23. Arresting officer observed defendant enter . . . a clean halls building and\nobserved defendant exit said building.

OPINION AND ORDER \nCITY OF NEW YORK, et at,  12 Civ. 2274 (SAS) \nDefendants. \n--------------------------------------------------------\n)( \nSHIRA A. SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.: \nThis putative class action challenges the New York City Police \nDepartment's implementation ofOperation Clean Halls, a program pursuant to \nwhich police officers patrol inside and around thousands of private residential \napartment buildings throughout New York City.  Plaintiffs allege that they and \ntheir minor children have been unlawfully stopped, questioned, frisked, and/or \narrested in or around their homes or their family members' homes.  The parties' \nfirst discovery dispute involves defendants' request for the unsealing ofrecords \nrelating to any prior arrests ofplaintiffs. \nIn accordance with my instructions and this District's Plan for Certain \n1 \n\n\n§ 1983 Cases Against the City of New Yorkl plaintiffs have already executed \n, \nreleases giving defendants full access to all paperwork relating to the arrests at \nissue in the case as well as a list of each plaintiffs prior arrests - a list that contains \nthe date of the arrest, the top charge, and whether or not the paperwork is sealed. \nDefendants argue that this information is insufficient and that they are entitled to \naccess all paperwork relating to all ofplaintiffs , prior arrests, even if those arrests \ntenninated in plaintiffs' favor and are sealed pursuant to New York law. \nAs I explained two years ago, adjudicating disputes over the \nunsealing of investigation and arrest records in New York requires a balancing of \nstate and federal interests that are sometimes in tension.2  New York Criminal \nProcedure Law section 160.50 provides, in relevant part: \nUpon the tennination of a criminal action or proceeding \nagainst a person in favor of such a person ... all official \nrecords and papers ... relating to the arrest or prosecution \n[shall be sealed, and shall not be] made available to any \nperson or public or private agency ... but only to the \nperson accused or to such person's designated agent.3 \nhttp://nysd.uscourts.gov/rules/The_Plan_and_Exhibits_201108.pdf \n2  See Crosby v. City ofNew York, 269 F.R.D. 267 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). \nN. Y. Crim. Pro. L. § 160.50.  Accord Haus v.  City ofNew York, No. \n3 \n03 Civ. 4915, 2006 WL 1148680, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 24, 2006) \n(\"[Section 160.50] requires, in the case of people arrested but not convicted, that \narrest records filed with the state courts or held by law-enforcement authorities be \nsealed and not disclosed except in limited circumstances.\"). \n2 \n\n\n\"The purpose ofthe provision is to ensure 'that one who is charged but not \nconvicted ofan offense suffers no stigma as a result of his having once been the \nobject of an unsustained accusation.\",4  Similarly, Section 160.55 requires the \nsealing of certain records of an individual convicted ofa violation (i.e., a non­\ncriminal offense).5 \nHowever, in cases presenting federal questions, such as here, \ndiscoverability, privileges, and confidentiality are governed by federal law, not \nstate law.6  \"[S]tate statutory privileges ... must be construed narrowly, 'and must \nyield when outweighed by a federal interest in presenting relevant information to a \nMacNamara v.  City ofNew York, No. 04 Civ. 9612,2006 WL \n4 \n3298911, at *1 n.l (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l3, 2006) (quoting Mattu ofHynes v. \nKarassik, 47 N.Y.2d 659, 662 (1979)).  Acrord Katherine B. v.  Cataldo, 5 N.YJd \n196, 202 (2005) (,\"That detriment to one's reputation and employment prospects \noften flows from merely having been subjected to criminal process has long been \nrecognized as a serious and unfortunate by-product of even unsuccessful criminal \nprosecutions.  The statute's design is to lessen such consequences.'\"  (quoting \nHynes, 47 N.Y.2d at 662)). \nSection 160.55 specifically provides:  \"Upon the termination of a \n5 \ncriminal action or proceeding against a person by the conviction of ... a violation \n... all official records and papers relating to the arrest or prosecution, including all \nduplicates and copies thereof, on file with the division of criminal justice services, \npolice agency, or prosecutor's office shall be sealed and not made available to any \nperson or public or private agency\" except in limited circumstances.  N.Y. Crim. \nPro. L. § 160.55(1). \nSee Fed. R. Evid. 501 (stating that privileges in federal-question cases \n6 \nare governed by federal common law); United States v.  Goldberger & Dubin, 935 \nF.2d 501,505 (2d Qr. 1991). \n3 \n\n\ntrier of fact. \",7  In other words, state privilege rules should not be permitted to \n\"frustrate the important federal interests in broad discovery and truth-seeking and \nthe interest in vindicating important federal substantive policy such as that \nembodied in section 1983.',g  Nonetheless, \"the policies underlying state \nevidentiary privileges must still be given serious consideration, even if they are not \ndeterminative.\n,,9 \nSections 160.50 and 160.55 protect \"important privacy interests, and \n'a strong policy of comity between state and federal sovereignties impels federal \ncourts to recognize state privileges where this can be accomplished at no \nsubstantial cost to federal substantive and procedural po1icy.\"'!O  This Court must \ntherefore \"balance the deference to be accorded state-created privileges with the \nneed for the information sought to be protected by the privilege.\"! 1 \nDefendants argue that they need the paperwork relating to sealed \nDaniels v.  City o/New York, No. 99 Civ. 1695,2001 WL 228091, at \n7 \n*1 (Mar. 8,2001) (quoting Unit«.i States v.  One Parcel o/Property at 31-33 York \nStreet, 930 F.2d 139, 141 (2d Cir. 1991)). \n8  Kingv. Conde, 121 F.R.D. 180, 187 (E.D.N.Y. 1988). \n9  Burka v. New York City Transit Auth., 110 F.RD. 660, 664 (S.D.N.Y. \n1986). \nKing, 121 F.RD. at 187 (quoting Lora v. Board ofEduc., 74 F.R.D. \n10 \n565, 576 (E.D.N.Y. 1977)). \n11  Daniels, 2001 WL 228091, at *1. \n4 \n\narrests for three reasons:  (I) to explore the adequacy ofplaintiffs to serve as class \nrepresentatives,12 (2) because the information is relevant to the question of \nplaintiffs' damages (in that plaintiffs who have previously been arrested and \ndetained arguably suffer less emotional distress than plaintiffs who are arrested for \nthe first time), and (3) because \"past interactions with law enforcement may have \ninfluenced, at least to some extent, the interactions plaintiffs had with the police in \nthis case.  See FRE 404(b) .\"13 \nPlaintiffs respond by arguing that, as a general matter, the sealing of \ntheir arrest records pursuant to state law advances important privacy interests and \nto the extent that federal litigation can accommodate those state interests without \n14 \nhindering federal interests, it should. As to defendants' three arguments, \nplaintiffs say: (l) The \"adequacy\" question is not an inquiry into plaintiffs' moral \nrighteousness but is directed at improper or questionable conduct arising out ofor \ntouching on the prosecution ofthis lawsuit,15 (2) the only component ofpast arrests \nthat are relevant to emotional damages is the length oftime that a plaintiff was \n12  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). \n13  5/31112 Letter from Mark Zuckerman to Court at 2. \n14 \nSee 6/4/12 Letter from Alexis Karteron to Court at 2. \nSee Friedman-Katz v. Lindt & Sprung/i (USA), Inc., 270 F.RD. 150, \n15 \n160 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); Casale v. Kelly, 257 F.R.D. 396,412 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). \n5 \n\n\ndetained in  connection with an arrest, and, in contrast, the charges levied against \nthe individual and the related police paperwork are not relevant, and (3) under Rule \n404(b), only those prior bad acts that are similar to trespass - the charge at issue in \nthis lawsuit  should be discoverable and disclosure of information about prior bad \nacts (such as drug possession) that are completely unrelated to trespass is not \nreasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  In short, \nplaintiffs agree that their past arrests on charges similar to trespass are relevant to \nthe adequacy inquiry and that some arrest information may be admissible under \nRule 404(b).  But, they believe, there should not be a blanket unsealing order. \nPlaintiffs are correct.  Defendants have no legitimate reason to \nexamine paperwork from an old arrest for possession of drugs or disorderly \nconduct that terminated in a plaintiff's favor and was sealed pursuant to important \nstate privacy law.  When it can, the federal interest in broad discovery should \naccommodate this New York privilege.  Defendants must be provided access to \nprior arrest records and paperwork only for charges of trespass or related crimes for \nthe past ten years.  Plaintiffs should also disclose to defendants the length of time \nthat they were detained and incarcerated as a result of any prior arrests and any \nemotional or physical injuries that they suffered as a result of those arrests.  This \ndisclosure may be made in a sworn affidavit, but does not require the unsealing of \narrest records. \n6 \n\nIf, despite this guidance, the parties still disagree about the unsealing \nof particular arrest files, I will adjudicate the disputes on a case-by-case basis. \nSOWDE  D:--, \nr)~/ \nI'i  ,­\nI \nDated:  June 12, 2012 \nNew York, New York \n7 \n\n\n- Appearances ­\nFor Plaintiffs: \nAlexis Karteroll, Esq. \nNew York Civil Liberties Union \n125 Broad Street \nNew York, NY 10004 \n(212) 607-3391 \nFor Defendants: \nMark Zuckerman \nSenior Counsel \nNew York City Law Department \n100 Church Street \nNew York, NY 10007 \n(212) 442-8248 \n8 \n",

(cd) (Entered: 06/06/2012)\n06/12/2012 20  MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER: #101911 This putative class action\nchallenges the New York City Police Department's implementation of Operation Clean\nHalls, a program pursuant to which police officers patrol inside and around thousands\nof private residential apartment buildings throughout New York City. Plaintiffs allege\nthat they and their minor children have been unlawfully stopped, questioned, frisked,\nand/or arrested in or around their homes or their family members' homes. The parties'\nfirst discovery dispute involves defendants' request for the unsealing of records\nrelating to any prior arrests of plaintiffs. Defendants have no legitimate reason to\nexamine paperwork from an old arrest for possession of drugs or disorderly conduct\nthat terminated in a plaintiff's favor and was sealed pursuant to important state privacy\nlaw. When it can, the federal interest in broad discovery should accommodate this\nNew York privilege. Defendants must be provided access to prior arrest records and\npaperwork only for charges of trespass or related crimes for the past ten years.\nPlaintiffs should also disclose to defendants the length of time that they were detained\nand incarcerated as a result of any prior arrests and any emotional or physical injuries\nthat they suffered as a result of those arrests. This disclosure may be made in a sworn\naffidavit, but does not require the unsealing of arrest records. If, despite this guidance,\nthe parties still disagree about the unsealing of particular arrest files, I will adjudicate\nthe disputes on a case−by−case basis. (Signed by Judge Shira A.

Plaintiffs in Floyd and Ligon\npromptly requested until September 6, 2013 to submit letters in opposition to the City's\nmotion. The City opposed plaintiffs' requests, arguing that plaintiffs should be granted\nno more than three days to draft an opposition letter, because this is the time normally\nallotted for responses to pre−motion letters under this Court's Individual Rules. The\nCity's stay request is a motion, not a pre−motion letter, and the City had fifteen days to\nprepare its motion. Plaintiffs will have ten days, including the Labor Day weekend, to\nprepare their opposition letter. Thus, plaintiffs' opposition will be due by September 6,\n2013. The City's reply will be due by September 12, 2013, pursuant to the City's\nrequest. (Signed by Judge Shira A.

The Opinion\nstated that the Joint Remedial Process would be guided by a Facilitator to be named by\nthe Court. I am now appointing Nicholas Turner, President and Director of the VERA\nInstitute of Justice, as the Facilitator. After previously working at VERA for nine\nyears, Mr. Turner was recently named as the Institute's fifth President... Based in New\nYork City, the VERA Institute is widely recognized for its use of rigorous testing and\nbroad−based collaboration to help governments plan, implement, and evaluate\nimprovements to the justice system... VERA has a long history of working to improve\npublic safety by strengthening the ties between police and the community. In the early\n1980s, VERA partnered with the NYPD to develop the Community Patrol Officer\nProgram, one of the first community policing programs in the country. A 1999 study\nof two police precincts in the South Bronx examined approaches to respectful and\neffective policing in minority communities. SO ORDERED. (See Order). (Signed by\nJudge Shira A.

Pending before the Court is a motion filed by Appellants City of\nNew York et al. seeking a stay of the District Court's August 12, 2013 remedial order\nand preliminary injunction (\"Remedies Opinion\"). It is hereby ORDERED that the\n\nDistrict Courts January 8, 2013 \"Opinion and Order,\" as well as the August 12, 2013\n\"Liability Opinion\" and \"Remedies Opinion,\" each of which may or will have the\neffect of causing actions to be taken by defendants or designees of the District Court,\nor causing restraints against actions that otherwise would be taken by defendants, are\nSTAYED pending the disposition of these appeals. The appeal by defendants in both\n(consolidated) actions shall continue in the normal course, under the following\nschedule: Defendants shall perfect their appeals by January 24, 2014. Plaintiffs shall\nfile by February 28, 2014. Defendants shall reply by March 14, 2014. Oral argument\nshall be heard on a date after March 14, 2014, to be set by the Court in due course. The\ncause is REMANDED to the District Court for the sole purpose of implementation of\nthis Order, and the mandate shall otherwise remain with this Court until the\ncompletion of the appeals process. Upon review of the record in these cases, we\nconclude that the District Judge ran afoul of the Code of Conduct for United States\nJudges, Canon 2 (\"A judge should avoid impropriety and the appearance of\nimpropriety in all activities.\"); see also Canon 3(C)(1) (\"A judge shall disqualify\nhimself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably\nbe questioned....\"), and that the appearance of partiality surrounding this litigation was\ncompromised by the District Judge's improper application of the Court's \"related case\nrule,\" see Transfer of Related Cases, S.D.N.Y. & E.D.N.Y. Local Rule 13(a), and by a\nseries of media interviews and public statements purporting to respond publicly to\ncriticism of the District Court. Accordingly, we conclude that, in the interest, and\nappearance, of fair and impartial administration of justice, UPON REMAND, these\ncases shall be assigned to a different District Judge, chosen randomly under the\nestablished practices of the District Court for the Southern District of New York. This\nnewly−designated District Judge shall implement this Court's mandate staying all\nproceedings and otherwise await further action by the Court of Appeals on the merits\nof the ongoing appeals.

(sjo) (Entered: 11/01/2013)\n11/13/2013 158  PER CURIAM OPINION of USCA (Certified Copy) as to 123 Notice of Appeal, filed\nby Gregory Lomangino, Raymond W. Kelly, Kieron Ramdeen, Miguel Santiago, City\nof New York, Joseph Koch, Johnny Blasini, Joseph Bermudez, John Does 1−12.\nUSCA Case Number 13−3088; 13−3123.These cases, motions of which were argued\nin tandem and decided on October 31, 2013, and which concern the so−called\n\"stop−and−frisk\" policies of the New York City Police Department, have, quite apart\nfrom the underlying merits, raised a number of unusual procedural issues. In a separate\nopinion published contemporaneously with this one, we explain the basis of our prior,\nbrief order reassigning these cases from Judge Shira A. Scheindlin to a new district\njudge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, to be\nchosen randomly. In this opinion, we address the unprecedented motion filed by Judge\nScheindlin herself, through counsel, to appear and seek reconsideration of our order of\nreassignment. The motion, submitted substantially in the form of a brief in favor of\nreconsideration, presents the threshold question whether, in the circumstances\npresented, a district judge may participate as a party, as an intervenor, or as an amicus\ncuriae in an appeal of her decisions. For the reasons set forth below, we DENY Judge\nScheindlin's motion to appear in this Court in support of retaining authority over these\ncases.

This opinion explains the basis for our order of October\n31, 2013, directing the reassignment of these cases to a randomly selected district\njudge and supersedes that order. To reiterate, we have made no findings that Judge\nScheindlin has engaged in judicial misconduct. We conclude only that, based on her\nconduct at the December 21, 2007 hearing and in giving the interviews to the news\nmedia in May 2013, Judge Scheindlin's appearance of impartiality may reasonably be\nquestioned within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 455 and that \"reassignment is advisable\nto preserve the appearance of justice.\" Catherine O'Hagan Wolfe, Clerk USCA for the\nSecond Circuit.

The Unions' motions to intervene are DENIED for\nthree reasons: (1) the motions are untimely; (2) the Unions have no significant\nprotectable interests relating to the subject of the litigation that would warrant\nintervention; and (3) even if their alleged interests were cognizable, the Unions lack\nstanding to vindicate those interests on appeal. The parties' motion for an order\nmodifying the Remedial Order is GRANTED. The modification shall be set forth in a\nseparate order to be issued forthwith. The Unions' request to participate in the\nsettlement of Floyd and Ligon is, therefore, DENIED as moot. The Unions' request to\nparticipate in the remedial phase of Floyd is also DENIED as moot because the\nRemedial Order already offers \"police organizations\" the opportunity to participate in\nthe development of reforms to NYPD stop−and−frisk policies and procedures through\nthe \"Joint Remedial Process.\" To the extent the Unions request to participate in the\nremedial phase of Ligon, that request is DENIED for the same reasons the Court\ndenies their motion to intervene for the purpose of appealing the Remedial Order.\nHaving resolved the motions to intervene, and having approved the terms of the\nparties' proposed resolution of the City's appeals, the Court has continuing jurisdiction\nonly \"insofar as is necessary to effectuate a settlement.\" Ligon, 743 F.3d at 365.\nAccordingly, by August 6, 2014, the City shall submit a letter to the Court indicating\nthe status of its pending appeals. This Court shall take no further action unrelated to\neffectuating the parties' settlement unless and until the Court of Appeals dissolves the\nstay or otherwise returns jurisdiction to the District Court. The Clerk of Court shall\nterminate the motions at ECF Nos. 436 and 441 in Floyd and ECF No. 171 in Ligon.\n(Signed by Judge Analisa Torres on 7/30/2014) (tro) (Entered: 07/30/2014)\n07/30/2014 198  ORDER MODIFYING REMEDIAL ORDER terminating 188 Motion to\nAmend/Correct 120 Memorandum & Opinion. For the reasons stated in an Opinion\nand Order of even date, and pursuant to the directive of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit to \"effectuate a settlement,\" Mandate and Opinion,\n(Feb. 21, 2014), Floyd, ECF No. 426; Ligon, ECF No. 166, IT IS ORDERED that\nparagraph 12 on page 13 of the Remedial Order, Floyd, ECF No. 372; Ligon, ECF No.\n120, is deleted and the following is substituted in its place: 12. a. The Monitor's\nposition will come to an end in Floyd no sooner than three years after the Court's entry\nof the final order approving the Immediate Reforms to be developed in Floyd and if\nand only if the City can show by a preponderance of the evidence at that time that it\nhas achieved substantial compliance with all of the Immediate and Joint Process\nReforms to be approved and so−ordered by the Court in Floyd. If the City fails to\nmake such showing, the Monitor's position will continue until such time as the City\ncan make the required showing of substantial compliance. b. The Monitor's position\nwith respect to the preliminary injunctive relief in Ligon will come to an end no sooner\nthan three years after the Court's entry of the final order approving the preliminary\ninjunctive relief set forth in Section III of this Order, entitled \"Remedies in Ligon\" (the\n\"Ligon Preliminary Injunctive Relief\") and if and only if the City can show by a\npreponderance of the evidence at that time that it has achieved substantial compliance\nwith all of the Ligon Preliminary Injunctive Relief. If the City fails to make such\nshowing, the Monitor's position will continue until such time as the City can make the\nrequired showing of substantial compliance. c. \"Substantial compliance\" in Floyd shall\nbe defined as compliance with all material aspects of the Immediate and Joint Process\nReforms to be approved and so−ordered by the Court. \"Substantial compliance\" in\n\nLigon shall be defined as compliance with all material aspects of the Ligon\nPreliminary Injunctive Relief. In either case, noncompliance with mere technicalities,\nor temporary failure to comply during a period of otherwise sustained compliance will\nnot constitute a failure of substantial compliance. However, temporary compliance\nduring a period of otherwise sustained non−compliance shall not constitute substantial\ncompliance. d. Substantial compliance shall be measured using the milestones to be set\nby the Monitor pursuant to paragraph 5 above.

(Signed by Judge Analisa Torres on 2/24/2017) (cf)\n(Entered: 02/24/2017)\n03/21/2017 276  ORDER: The Monitor his submitted recommendations regarding training to be given\nat roll call regarding enforcement activities in and near residences enrolled in the\nTrespass Affidavit Program (\"TAP\"). ECF No. 260. Plaintiffs object to the Monitor's\nrecommendation with respect to the voice−over script for slide 17 of the proposed\ntraining. ECF No. 261. In particular, Plaintiffs worry that the training \"would permit\nofficers who lack probable cause to believe a person is trespassing nonetheless to order\nthe person to leave and then to use a failure to comply with that order to justify an\narrest.\" Id. at 1. Additional letters were filed by Defendants, Plaintiffs, and the\nplaintiffs in Davis v. City of New York, No. 10 Civ. 699. ECF Nos. 269, 271, 273. In\nJune 2016, the Court approved revisions to Patrol Guide (\"P.G.\") 212−59, which sets\nforth the procedures governing interactions between the police and the public in and\n\naround TAP buildings. ECF No. 249. All parties supported the approval of these\nrevisions. Id. at 6. The proposed voice−over script for slide 17 includes some but not\nall of the language in P.G. 212−59. The Court finds that the addition of language from\nP.G. 212−59 to the proposed voice−over script for slide 17 clarifies the probable cause\nrequirement. Accordingly, the Monitor's recommendation is APPROVED with the\nfollowing modification of the proposed voice−over script for slide 17: Now let's\ndiscuss how you can deal with a person who is uncooperative and won't answer your\nquestions, or where you can't verify a person's authority to be in the building. At\nLevels 1 and 2, when individuals are free to walk away, a person's decision to leave\nthe building, remain silent, or refuse to provide information or identification when\nquestioned by the police does not give you reasonable suspicion to stop or probable\ncause to arrest. Even at Level 3, you may detain the person but he or she is still not\nrequired to answer your questions. Remember, the burden of proving that an individual\ndoes not have authority to be in the building rests on the Police. The individual is not\nrequired to answer questions, not even about his or her authority to be in the building.\nIf you suspect the person does not have authority to be in the building, but the person\ncannot or refuses to explain his or her presence in the building, and you are unable to\nverify the person's authority to be in the building, you may instruct that person that he\nor she must leave the building, and that refusal may result in arrest for Criminal\nTrespass. However, you may only arrest the person if there is probable cause to\nbelieve that the person committed a trespass. A reasonable investigation is ordinarily\nnecessary to determine whether probable cause exists. A person's refusal or inability to\nproduce identification or provide information does not elevate the level of the\nencounter.

Scheindlin. \n\n \nPER CURIAM \nThese cases, motions of which were argued in tandem and decided on October 31, \n2013, and which concern the so-called “stop-and-frisk” policies of the New York City \nPolice Department, have, quite apart from the underlying merits, raised a number of \nunusual procedural issues.  In a separate opinion published contemporaneously with this \none, we explain the basis of our prior, brief order reassigning these cases from Judge \nShira A. Scheindlin to a new district judge of the United States District Court for the \nSouthern District of New York, to be chosen randomly.  In this opinion, we address the \nunprecedented motion filed by Judge Scheindlin herself, through counsel, to appear and \nseek reconsideration of our order of reassignment.  The motion, submitted substantially in \nthe form of a brief in favor of reconsideration, presents the threshold question whether, in \nthe circumstances presented, a district judge may participate as a party, as an intervenor, \nor as an amicus curiae in an appeal of her decisions.  For the reasons set forth below, we \nDENY Judge Scheindlin’s motion to appear in this Court in support of retaining authority \nover these cases. \nBACKGROUND1 \nThese cases deal with the constitutionality of certain practices of the New York \nCity Police Department (“NYPD”).  The practices—and these cases themselves—present \nissues of prominent public concern and have attracted intense scrutiny in the media.  On \nAugust 12, 2013, following a nine-week trial in Floyd v. City of New York, Judge \n                                                           \n1 In this section, we recite only the facts directly relevant to this opinion.  A more complete history \nof these cases may be found in our separate opinion published today, addressing the merits of reassigning \nthe cases to a new district judge. \n  2 \n\nScheindlin held that the City of New York (the “City”) violated the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments by acting with deliberate indifference towards the NYPD’s \npractice of unconstitutional stops and unconstitutional frisks and by adopting a policy of \n“indirect racial profiling” that targeted racially defined groups for “stops-and-frisks.”2  \nJudge Scheindlin also ordered an array of injunctive remedies, including but not limited \nto the appointment of a monitor, the institution of a program requiring certain officers to \nwear cameras on their persons, and the amendment of the forms used to document stop-\nand-frisks.3     \nAfter some delay, the City sought, in the District Court, to stay those remedies \nuntil a decision on the merits had been reached by the Court of Appeals in the normal \ncourse.  Judge Scheindlin denied that motion and, as is the normal practice, the City \nrenewed its request for a stay in this Court.  We held extended oral argument and, on \nOctober 31, 2013, granted the motion for a stay during the pendency of the appeals and, \nbased on the record of the proceedings in the District Court and Judge Scheindlin’s \nparticipation in media interviews, reassigned the cases to a different district judge, to be \nchosen randomly, in order to avoid the appearance of partiality.4   \nOn November 8, 2013, Judge Scheindlin moved in this court, through counsel, for \n“leave in the nature of an order under Rule 21(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure governing mandamus proceedings providing for appellate review of motions \n                                                           \n2 See Floyd v. City of New York, __ F. Supp. 2d __, No. 08-cv-1034, 2013 WL 4046209, at *7 \n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 12, 2013).   \n \n3 See Floyd v. City of New York, __ F. Supp. 2d __, Nos. 08-cv-1034, 12-cv-2274, 2013 WL \n4046217 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 12, 2013). \n \n4 See Floyd v. City of New York, No. 13-3088, Dkt. 247; Ligon v. City of New York, No. 13-3123, \nDkt. 174.   \n  3 \n\nfor judicial disqualification pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455, authorizing counsel to appear on \nbehalf of the District Judge in order to address the factual and legal sufficiency of the \nMotion Panel’s sua sponte order of removal.”5  On November 9, 2013, Judge \nScheindlin’s counsel, now styling himself as amicus curiae on her behalf, filed a letter \nurging us to vacate our order of reassignment “to terminate a dispute that is distracting \nattention from the underlying merits.”6 \nDISCUSSION \nWe conclude that Judge Scheindlin’s motion lacks a procedural basis.  As \nexplained more fully in our separate opinion concerning the merits of the order of \nreassignment, the cases were reassigned not because of any judicial misconduct or ethical \nlapse on the part of Judge Scheindlin—as to which we have expressly made no finding—\nbut solely pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455(a).  Section 455(a) provides that “[a]ny justice, \njudge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify [her]self in any \nproceeding in which [her] impartiality might reasonably be questioned.”  We know of no \nprocedural mechanism that might permit a district judge to come before us and argue on \nher own behalf in these circumstances, nor has Judge Scheindlin identified one. \nIndeed, we note in the motion itself some inconsistency in its theory of Judge \nScheindlin’s relationship to the proceedings in this Court.  The motion requests leave for \n                                                           \n5 Scheindlin Mot. for Leave to Appear re: Order of Removal, at 2.  Attorney Burt Neuborne is the \nonly person to have actually entered an appearance on Judge Scheindlin’s behalf.  See Local Rule 12.3(b) \n(“An attorney, other than the initial counsel of record, who appears in a case in any capacity on behalf of a \nparty or an amicus curiae must file the Notice of Appearance Form for Substitute, Additional, or Amicus \nCounsel at the time the attorney enters the case.”).  We do observe, however, that, pursuant to Local Rule \n29.1(a), we “ordinarily will deny leave to file an amicus brief when, by reason of a relationship between a \njudge assigned to hear the proceeding and the amicus curiae or its counsel, the filing of the brief might \ncause the recusal of the judge.”  Mr. Neuborne labors under no such disability.   \n \n6 See Note 14, post, for the full text of this letter. \n  4 \n\nher lawyers “to appear either as counsel to the District Judge, or as amici curiae on her \nbehalf.”7  Additionally, the motion purports to seek relief “in the nature of an order under \nRule 21(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.”8  This locution is notable \nbecause Rule 21 governs “Writs of Mandamus and Prohibition, and Other Extraordinary \nWrits,” and provides that the “trial-court judge may request permission to address the \npetition [for mandamus] but may not do so unless invited or ordered to do so by the court \nof appeals.”9   \nRule 21, however, does not apply to these proceedings because there has been no \npetition for a writ of mandamus or any other type of extraordinary writ in these cases.  \nThe Supreme Court has long instructed that the writ of mandamus is “a ‘drastic and \n                                                           \n7 Scheindlin Mot., at ¶ 46.   \n8 Id. at 2 (emphasis added).  Judge Scheindlin asserts several other legal bases for her motion, \nnone of which in our view supports, or even suggests, a district judge’s right to formally contest \nreassignment.  In addition to Rule 21, her motion “is brought pursuant to Rules . . . 27, and 29 of the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure; 28 U.S.C § 2106; 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (the All Writs Act); and the First \nand Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.”  Scheindlin Mot. at 2.  Rule 27 (governing \n“Motions”) and Rule 29 (governing “Brief of an Amicus Curiae”) are general provisions that do not \nprovide a procedural predicate for her unprecedented motion. Similarly, Section 2106 of Title 28, entitled \n“Determination,” states that “[t]he Supreme Court or any other court of appellate jurisdiction may affirm, \nmodify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment, decree, or order of a court lawfully brought before it for \nreview, and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or \nrequire such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.”  While this provision \nestablishes what an appellate court may do, it does not speak to a district judge’s role in that process.  The \nAll Writs Act gives courts the authority to “issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective \njurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.”  28 U.S.C. § 1651(a).  Although we have \nrecognized numerous injunctions and orders of a district court appropriately authorized under the All Writs \nAct, we are aware of no precedent that establishes a district judge’s right to join an ongoing proceeding by \nformally contesting an appellate court’s order of reassignment.  Finally, the constitutional amendments on \nwhich she relies are also inapplicable.  The freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment does not \nmean that there can be no limitations such as those contemplated under section 455(a), on what a federal \njudge may say, much less on where she can say it, especially as it relates to pending litigation.  As \ndiscussed in our accompanying opinion, numerous courts of appeals have reassigned cases due to an \nappearance of partiality that was traceable to speech by a district judge.  Similarly, the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment is inapplicable in these circumstances, because reassignment of a case is not a \nlegal injury to the district judge, and we have made no finding of judicial misconduct that a judge might \nhave the right to contest. \n9 Fed. R. App. P. 21(b)(4). \n  5 \n\nextraordinary’ remedy ‘reserved for really extraordinary causes.’”10  No writ of \nmandamus is involved in this appeal:  We have not issued an extraordinary writ to the \ndistrict judge, nor is there a petition for a writ directed to us.  For this reason, the case \npresented here is quite unlike those in which other district judges have appeared before \nthis court pursuant to specific statutory authority.11  Outside of the context of a writ of \nmandamus, it is procedurally improper for a District Judge to enter an appearance in an \nappeal of her own decisions, whether as a party, intervenor, or amicus.   \nWe know of no precedent suggesting that a district judge has standing before an \nappellate court to protest reassignment of a case.12  While a district judge may believe \nthat he or she has expended a great deal of effort and energy on a case, only to see it \nreassigned, reassignment is not a legal injury to the district judge.  Rather, reassignment \nallows the courts to ensure that cases are decided by judges without even an appearance \n                                                           \n10 Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004) (quoting Ex parte Fahey, 332 \nU.S. 258, 259-60 (1947)); see also In re The City of New York, 607 F.3d 923, 932-33 (2d Cir. 2010) \n(enumerating requirements for the writ).   \n \n11 See Fed. R. App. P. 21; see, e.g., U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Citigroup Global Mkts. Inc., 673 \nF.3d 158, 169 (2d Cir. 2012) (appointing counsel to represent Judge Jed S. Rakoff in a mandamus \nproceeding); In re Austrian & German Holocaust Litig., 250 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir. 2001) (acknowledging \nthat the Second Circuit properly invited Judge Shirley Kram to respond through counsel to mandamus \npetitions). \n \n12 In somewhat similar circumstances, the then-Chief Judge of the Central District of California, \nManuel L. Real, refused to reassign, pursuant to mandate of the Ninth Circuit, a case over which he had \nbeen presiding.  Instead, he directed the parties to brief whether the Ninth Circuit had the power to reassign \ncases.  See Brown v. Baden, 815 F.2d 575, 576 (9th Cir. 1987).  The Ninth Circuit then issued a writ of \nmandamus requiring reassignment, explaining that “[t]here is no doubt as to our authority to order a case \nreassigned” and that “[i]n the scheme of the federal judicial system, the district court is required to follow \nand implement our decisions just as we are oath- and duty-bound to follow the decisions and mandates of \nthe United States Supreme Court.”  Id. at 576.  Chief Judge Real then petitioned for a writ of certiorari to \nappeal the Ninth Circuit’s decision to the Supreme Court, which the Supreme Court denied without \ncomment.  See Real v. Yagman, 484 U.S. 963 (1987).   \n  6 \n\nof partiality.13  A district judge has no legal interest in a case or its outcome, and, \nconsequently, suffers no legal injury by reassignment. \nTo the extent that Judge Scheindlin seeks to defend herself against the suggestion \nof violation of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, our accompanying opinion \nexplains that we have made no findings that Judge Scheindlin has committed judicial \nmisconduct, nor have we suggested that she has abdicated any of her ethical \nresponsibilities.  Rather, we have simply concluded that the appearance of her \nimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.  We therefore need not consider Judge \nScheindlin’s argument that she ought to be afforded an opportunity to contest charges of \njudicial misconduct. \nFinally, we note that Judge Scheindlin’s counsel, now purporting to serve as \namicus “to the district judge,” filed a supplemental letter on November 9, 2013, wherein \nhe urges that we vacate parts of our order of October 31, 2013, “without prejudice,” \nwhich would “permit the parties to raise the issues” without “being forced to address \nthem in the context of an unseemly dispute among judges” and in a way that would \n“terminate a dispute that is distracting attention from the underlying merits.”14  First, we \n                                                           \n13 See 28 U.S.C. § 455(a); see also In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955) (“[T]o perform its \nhigh function in the best way justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.” (internal quotation marks \nomitted)); United States v. Londono, 100 F.3d 236, 242 (2d Cir. 1966) (“[R]eassignment is advisable to \npreserve the appearance of justice.” (internal quotation marks omitted)) (abrogated on other grounds).  \n \n14 The letter in full reads as follows: \n \nBurt Neuborne \n40 Washington Square South \nNew York, New York 10012 \n212 998-6172 \nburt.neuborne@nyu.edu \n \nNovember 8, 2013 \n \n \n  7 \n\ncannot subscribe to the view that a decision of this Court—made pursuant to a statute \npassed by Congress—should be vacated because a non-party (even a judge) claiming to \nbe affected by that order believes that the issue has become controversial or “distracting.”   \nSecond, as we observe in our accompanying opinion, reassignment is an ordinary \ntool used by our judicial system to maintain and promote the appearance of impartiality \n                                                                                                                                                                             \nHon.

City of New York, 13-3123 (corrected) \nFloyd v. City of New York, 13-3088  \n \nYour Honors:  \n \nWe write as amici curiae on behalf of the District Judge herein, with her \napproval and consent.  We believe, and the District Judge concurs, that it is in the best \ninterests of all concerned to terminate a dispute that is distracting attention from the \nunderlying merits, while preserving the rights of the parties to raise the issue in the \nordinary course.  \n \n   Accordingly, we urge the panel to withdraw, without prejudice, so much of its \norder herein, dated October 31, 2013, as sua sponte found that the District Court’s actions \nhad “run afoul” of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, and directed her \nremoval as presiding judge in Ligon v. City of New York, 13-3123 (corrected), and Floyd \nv. City of New York, 13-3088. Such a course of conduct would permit the parties to raise \nthe issues at an appropriate point in the proceedings without being forced to address them \nin the context of an unseemly dispute among judges.  \n \nRespectfully, \n \nBurt Neuborne \n(Counsel of Record) \nNorman Dorsen \nArthur R.

City of New York, et al., 10-CV-0699 (AT) \nFloyd, et al. v. City of New York, 08-CV-1034 (AT) \nLigon, et al. v. City of New York, et al., 12-CV-2274 (AT) \n \nDear Judge Torres: \nCounsel for plaintiffs in the above-reference matters respectfully submit this letter \nto raise two issues with the Court. \nFirst, Floyd, Davis, and Ligon plaintiffs write with respect to the anticipated \nselection of a new Court-Appointed Monitor of the New York City Police Department \n(“NYPD”).  The tragic passing of the long-serving NYPD Monitor, Peter Zimroth—who \nwas at work on the remedial process even in his final days—leaves this monitorship at a \ncritical juncture to ensure the successful continuation of the remedial process.  The \nselection of a new monitor provides an opportunity to reinforce the significance of this \nprocess to New Yorkers, address some lingering concerns about community engagement \nand transparency, and ensure the success of these remedial efforts.  Indeed, the United \nStates Department of Justice recently identified “Public Input during Monitor Selection” \nas the first step to effectuate the core belief that “Monitors must be accountable to the \ncourt, the parties, and the public.”1  That is because “monitors hold a position of public \ntrust, not only as agents of the court, but also as drivers of significant change in public \ninstitutions that are central to the communities that they serve.  Monitorships thus must \n \n1 Associate Attorney General, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Memorandum for the \nAttorney General, Review of the Use of Monitors in Civil Settlement Agreements and \nConsent Decrees involving State and Local Governmental Entities (Aug. 13, 2021), at 5, \nhttps://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1432236/download, approved by Attorney General, \nU.S. Dep’t of Justice, Memorandum of Heads of Civil Litigating Components United \nStates Attorneys, Review of the Use of Monitors in Settlement Agreements and Consent \nDecrees involving State and Local Entities (Sept. 13, 2021), \nhttps://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1432236/download. \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 489   Filed 11/19/21   Page 2 of 5\n  Honorable Analisa Torres \nNovember 19, 2021 \nPage 2 \n \n \nbe structured to ensure that monitors are accountable for their work.”2  Accordingly, the \nDepartment recommends that the monitor selection process “include[] an opportunity for \npublic input”—“[s]pecifically, they should require that the selection of monitors be \ninformed by a public process, including a publicly-posted request for proposals, public \nposting of the applicants’ proposals, an opportunity for stakeholders to meet and ask \nquestions of the finalists for the monitor position, and a process for the public to provide \ninput to the parties and the court on the selection of the monitor.”3  The Department \nfurther states that a “more open and rigorous application and selection process will also \nensure a more diverse and representative sample of monitor candidates.”4 \nFloyd, Davis, and Ligon plaintiffs likewise maintain that a public and transparent \nselection process, which follows the spirit of the guidelines set forth by the Department \nof Justice after a thorough and comprehensive review of monitorships nationwide, is \ncrucial during this critical time of transition.  As one of the most high-profile police \nmonitorships in the country, law enforcement agencies across the nation will look to this \nmonitoring process as a possible guide in their own reform and accountability efforts.  \nMost importantly, the work of the NYPD monitorship has a deep and reverberating \nimpact on Black and Latinx communities throughout New York City—communities that \nhave rightly distrusted police and police reform for generations.  It is, therefore, \nimperative that the selection of the next NYPD Monitor be conducted openly and \nthoughtfully, under the watchful eye of the public, so that the person ultimately selected \nhas legitimacy and community support.  Such an open and deliberative selection process \nwould also bolster the Court’s own credibility and legitimacy before the public.  For \nthese reasons, plaintiffs oppose any selection process that is outside the purview of the \npublic and that does not allow appropriate time for consultation with key community \nstakeholders.  With the understanding that a public, deliberate, and transparent selection \nprocess will likely require some time to be conducted correctly, plaintiffs are committed \nto working collaboratively with the NYPD Deputy Monitor and the monitoring team, the \nCity Law Department, and the NYPD to continue the important work of this monitorship \nduring the interim period. \nSecond, Floyd and Davis plaintiffs further write with respect to our Motion to \nModify the Floyd Remedial Order (Floyd, Dkt #840; Davis, Dkt #578), which is \ncurrently pending before the Court.  As detailed in their supporting memoranda of law \n(Floyd, Dkt #841, #864; Davis, Dkt #579, #596), Floyd and Davis plaintiffs urge \nintervention of this Court to ensure the necessary engagement and involvement of \ndirectly impacted community members in the monitoring process.  This community \nengagement and involvement are essential to the success and legitimacy of the \nmonitorship because the Court will otherwise have inaccurate and one-sided information \n \n2 Id. \n3 Id. \n4 Id. \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 489   Filed 11/19/21   Page 3 of 5\n  Honorable Analisa Torres \nNovember 19, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \n \nabout the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk and trespass enforcement activities—which excludes \nthe perspectives, experiences, and expertise of those who have been most harmed by the \nNYPD’s constitutional violations—when assessing substantial compliance.  Thus, Floyd \nand Davis plaintiffs requested that the Court modify the Floyd remedial order to include \ncommunity surveys, a Community Collaborative Board, and field audits and integrity \ntesting.  Floyd and Davis plaintiffs further requested more proactive community \nengagement by the monitoring team and regular, public status conferences before the \nCourt to improve public transparency and legitimacy of the monitoring process. \nFloyd and Davis plaintiffs welcome the opportunity to work collaboratively with \nthe monitoring team and the City to resolve the pending motion, should they choose to do \nso.  However, it is imperative that any resolution include meaningful and concrete \ninvolvement of community stakeholders, especially those most directly harmed by the \nconstitutional violations at issue in these cases, in the Monitor’s—and ultimately the \nCourt’s—assessment of substantial compliance.  Without such assurances, Floyd and \nDavis plaintiffs maintain the need for modification of the Floyd Remedial Order and \nrespectfully request oral argument before the Court’s ruling of the pending motion. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n   /s/ Jin Hee Lee                        \nJin Hee Lee \nNAACP LEGAL DEFENSE & \nEDUCATIONAL FUND, INC. \n700 14th Street, NW, Suite 600 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n(202) 216-5579 \n \nRaymond Audain \nKevin Jason \nLauren Johnson \nAshok Chandran \nJohn Cusick \nNAACP LEGAL DEFENSE & \nEDUCATIONAL FUND, INC. \n40 Rector Street, 5th Floor \nNew York, NY  10006 \n(212) 965-2200 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 489   Filed 11/19/21   Page 4 of 5\n  Honorable Analisa Torres \nNovember 19, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \n \n   /s/ Corey Stoughton         \nCorey Stoughton \nSteven Wasserman \nMolly Griffard \nJennvine Wong \nTHE LEGAL AID SOCIETY \n199 Water Street \nNew York, NY 10038 \n(212) 577-3300 \n \nCounsel for Davis Plaintiffs \n \n   /s/ Jonathan C.

QAD will evaluate approved Stop Reports, police-initiated enforcement (PIE) arrests, \nTrespass Crime Fact Sheets, and body-worn camera (BWC) videos on a weekly basis for each \nmonth. The expectation is that this approach will result in a faster assessment and approval of \nStop Reports in commands, so earlier corrective action can be compiled in a simpler reporting \nformat.  QAD  will  also  continue  to  perform  audits  to  identify  instances  of \nsuppression/underreporting of Stop Reports by auditing Police Initiated Enforcement actions and \nusing RAND audits.  There are additional reviews addressing the constitutionality of Level 3 \nTerry  stops  and  trespass  arrests  at  NYCHA  and  TAP  buildings  being  conducted  by  the \nDepartment outside of the QAD audits. For example, the Department’s RISKS Review meetings \nprovide  additional  opportunities  for  reviewing  the  performance  of  commands,  as  well  as \nrequiring commands to be constantly auditing their own compliance with Department policy on \nthese matters.  \nMETHODOLOGY \nI.  STOP REPORT AUDIT  \n \nA. Sample \n \n  Effective ___, 2020, QAD will audit approved Stop Reports in each Precinct, Transit \nDistrict (TD), Police Service Area (PSA) and selected Specialized Units on a weekly basis for \neach month. The purpose of this frequency is to ensure that the commands are receiving timely \nfeedback that will allow for the commands to take appropriate corrective actions.   \n \n \n \n \nPage 1 of 11 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 778-1   Filed 06/15/20   Page 2 of 11\n \n \nThe number of Stop Reports evaluated will be based on a command’s annual number of Stop \nReports prepared for the prior year. QAD utilizes a sampling methodology based on grouping the \ncommands into the following four categories:  \n# of SRs               # of commands              Audit%                          \n0-59                           50                              75%               \n60-119             29            50%       \n120-179            37                              40%       \n180-249            11            40%                                                       \n250-309              3                              33%                          \n≥ 310                3                              33%                                          \n                                  \n  Each  week  a  report  will  be  generated  in  FORMS  for  the  command's  prior  week's \napproved Stop Reports. Each week's run of Stop Reports will incorporate the previous week's run \nto  ensure  that  all  pending  Stop  Reports  carry  over  and  are  part  of  the  subsequent  sample \npopulation. For example, for commands with 0-59 stop reports generated last year, QAD will \naudit three out of the four stop reports per week, if four stop reports were generated. If fewer \nthan four stop reports were generated in a week, then QAD will audit 100% of the stop reports \nfor those commands. At the completion of each quarter, a report will be generated incorporating \nthe audit findings and forwarded to the command, through channels. \nB.  Substantive Audit Procedures: \n \nThe objectives of the substantive audit procedures will be to assess: (1) whether the stop \nis explained to the civilian being stopped; (2) whether the stopping officer offered a business \ncard to the civilian stopped or, if it was not offered did the officers’ reason fall into one of the \nexceptions; (3) whether it appears (a) that the stop was based on reasonable suspicion, (b) that \nthe frisk, if conducted, was based on reasonable suspicion that the suspect was armed and \ndangerous, and (c) that the search, if conducted, had a legally sufficient basis; and (4) whether \nthe  consent  search,  if  conducted,  was  conducted  according  to  Department  policy.    These \nassessments will be based on the Stop Report, the BWC video for every audited Stop Report, and \nother documentation, such as an ICAD, crime pattern sheet, or activity log.   \nIn  addition,  the  audit  will  evaluate  whether  the  Stop  Report  narratives  sufficiently \narticulate: (a) reasonable suspicion for the stop, (b) reasonable suspicion for the frisk, if a frisk \nwas conducted, and (c) a legally sufficient basis for the search, if a search was conducted.  Also, \nthe BWC videos will be evaluated for: (1) whether the encounter is recorded, (2) whether the \nencounter is captured completely (meaning that the video captured sufficient information to \nPage 2 of 11 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 778-1   Filed 06/15/20   Page 3 of 11\n \n \nevaluate each level of the encounter), and (3) whether the Stop Report is consistent with the \nevents depicted on the videos. \nMoreover, supervisory actions will be evaluated to determine whether the supervisor \nsufficiently evaluated the narrative sections prepared by the reporting officer. QAD will evaluate \nwhether the supervisor approved a Stop Report, including any corrective history before approval, \nin circumstances in which the narrative did not make out reasonable suspicion for the stop or for \nthe frisk and/or legally sufficient basis for the search, if one was conducted. When the supervisor \nidentifies  an  insufficient  narrative  and/or  legally  insufficient  stop,  frisk,  and/or  search,  the \nsupervisory follow up section is evaluated for notation of instruction, training, and discipline. \nBelow is a description of the necessary steps for the proposed audit methodology.  \n1.  Review Stop Report and corresponding BWC videos and ICAD:   \na.  Review to determine whether BWC videos are recorded. \ni.  If a Stop Report selected has no BWC video, the command will be \nmarked deficient for the encounter recorded.  \nb.  Review to determine whether BWC videos captured the encounter completely. \ni.  If  BWC  video  did  not  capture  the  entire  encounter,  this  will  be \nidentified and shared with the command. \nc.  Review the BWC, Stop Report and, if applicable, the related ICAD event and \nor crime pattern sheet and or wanted posters to determine: \ni.  whether it appears that the stop was based on reasonable suspicion;  \nii.  whether the stop narrative in the Stop Report is consistent with the \nBWC recording of the stop. \niii. If the stop narrative in the Stop Report is not consistent with the BWC \nrecording of the stop, note how the narrative was not consistent. \n•  The BWC video of the stop may indicate that the stop was not \nbased on reasonable suspicion even though the Stop Report \nnarrative  articulates  reasonable  suspicion;  alternatively,  the \nBWC video of the stop may indicate that the stop was based on \nreasonable  suspicion,  even  when  the  Stop  Report  narrative \ndoes  not  articulate  reasonable  suspicion  (e.g.,  when  the \nnarrative  does  not  include  the  radio  run  description  of  the \nsuspect).  \nd.  Review the BWC, Stop Report and, if necessary and applicable, the related \nICAD event and/or crime pattern sheet and/or wanted posters to determine: \ni.  whether it appears the frisk, if conducted, was based on reasonable \nsuspicion;  \nii.  whether the frisk narrative in the Stop Report is consistent with the \nBWC recording of the frisk. \nPage 3 of 11 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 778-1   Filed 06/15/20   Page 4 of 11\n \n \niii. If the frisk narrative in the Stop Report is not consistent with the BWC \nrecording of the stop, note how the narrative was not consistent.       \ne.  Review the BWC, Stop Report and, if necessary and applicable, the related \nICAD event and or crime pattern sheet and or wanted posters to determine: \ni.  whether it appears that the search, if conducted, had a legally sufficient \nbasis;  \nii.  whether the search narrative in the Stop Report is consistent with the \nBWC recording of the search. \niii. If the search narrative in the Stop Report is not consistent with the \nBWC recording of the stop, note how the narrative was not consistent. \nf.  Review the video for compliance with the Right to Know Act; i.e., did the \nofficer: (a) identify him or herself, (b) explain the reason(s) for the stop, and \n(c) offer the stopped person a Business Card, and if not, did one or more of the \npermissible exceptions to these requirements apply, e.g., arrest, summons, or \nexigency.  \ng.  Review the video for compliance with consent to search policy if a consent \nsearch was conducted.  \n2.  Review of the Stop Report Narrative: \na.  Review the stop narrative section on the Stop Report and, if necessary and \napplicable, the related ICAD event and or crime pattern sheet and/or wanted \nposters  and  BWC  video  to  determine  whether  the  officer  sufficiently \narticulated reasonable suspicion for the stop (i.e., if the facts articulated in the \nnarrative  section  establish  that  it  was  reasonable  for  the  officer  to  have \nsuspected that the stopped person was committing, had committed or was \nabout to commit a felony or Penal Law misdemeanor).  \ni.  Conclusory  language  such  as  “furtive  movements,”  “fits  description,” \n“suspicious bulge,” “evasive or uncooperative behavior,” are insufficient \nto provide reasonable suspicion unless accompanied by more detailed, \nclarifying language. Moreover, mere presence in a “high crime area” or \n“drug prone location” alone cannot provide reasonable suspicion.  \nii.  Must include specific facts establishing reason for the stop (hunches or \ngut feelings are not sufficient). \niii. Must  be  individualized  (reasonably  suspect  the  specific  person  being \nstopped  of  criminal  wrongdoing  and  describe  the  actions  of  the \nindividual which constituted reasonable suspicion). \niv. Cannot be based solely on an uncorroborated suspect description received \nfrom an anonymous source. \nv.  Flight from police during a Level 2 investigative encounter elevates the \nencounter to reasonable suspicion. Flight during a Level 1 investigative \nencounter does not elevate the encounter to reasonable suspicion. \nPage 4 of 11 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 778-1   Filed 06/15/20   Page 5 of 11\n \n \nvi. When a stop is made pursuant to a suspect description and/or an identified \ncrime pattern, the narrative must include the details of that description \nand/or crime pattern.  \nvii.  A suspect description must include more details than just race, age, and \ngender in order to support reasonable suspicion for a stop. \nviii.  In order for a crime pattern to support reasonable suspicion for a stop, \nthe geographical area described should be specific, not broad (such as an \nentire precinct or borough).  \n \n3.  Review the Frisk Narrative: \na.  Review the narrative section of Stop Reports where a frisk is indicated to \ndetermine whether the officer sufficiently articulated reasonable suspicion that \nthe stopped person was armed and dangerous (i.e., it was reasonable for the \nofficer to suspect that the stopped person was armed and dangerous at the time \nof  the  stop). The  following  is  a  list  of  examples  of  when  a  UMOS  may \nreasonably  suspect  a  person  is  armed  and  dangerous  (this  list  is  not \ncomprehensive): \ni.  Reasonable suspicion that the suspect has committed, is committing or is \nabout  to  commit  a  violent  crime  (murder,  assault,  kidnapping,  rape, \nrobbery, burglary, criminal possession of a weapon).  \nii.  Observing something on the person that the officer reasonably suspects is \na weapon.  \niii. Statements made by the suspect.  \niv. Information  known  by  the  officer  that  the  suspect  may  be  carrying  a \nweapon, such as statements from a victim or witness.  \n \n4.  Review the Search Narrative:  \na.  Review the narrative section of Stop Reports where a search is indicated to \ndetermine  whether  the  officer  articulated  a  legally  sufficient  basis  for  the \nsearch (i.e., feeling a hard object believed to be a weapon during a frisk; \nsearch incident to an arrest; consent to search). \n5.  Review the reason for checking “No” for caption “Did officer explain reason for \nstop?”  (if  applicable).    Permissible  reasons  include  exigent  circumstances  and \nimpairing a criminal investigation. \n \n6.  Review  the  reason  for  checking  “No”  for  “Business  Card  Offered  to  Person \nStopped?”  (if  applicable).  Permissible  reasons  include  arrest,  summons,  exigent \ncircumstances.  \n \n7.  Review the Supervisory Section of the Stop Report: \na.  Determine whether supervisor’s captions are complete.  \nPage 5 of 11 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 778-1   Filed 06/15/20   Page 6 of 11\n \n \nb.  Review the Supervisory Action section to determine whether the supervisor \ncorrectly evaluated the sufficiency of the stop, frisk and search narrative.  \ni.  Exclude  administrative  errors  (e.g.,  if  the  supervisor  checked  “N” \ninstead of “N/A” for “Sufficient Basis for Frisk” when there was no \nfrisk). \nc.  Review  the  correction  history  of  the  Stop  Report  and  identify  and  track \nwhether the deficiencies noted were substantive in nature, or administrative \nerrors.  \nd.  Determine  whether,  in  cases  where  the  Supervisor  noted  one  or  more \ndeficiencies with the Stop Report and/or an insufficient basis for the stop, \nfrisk, and/or search, the Supervisor also indicated that follow-up actions were \ntaken.  \ne.  During audit, compare Stop Reports with follow-up actions checked by the \nsupervisor against related Department records (e.g., training records, CRAFT \nentries and command disciplines) to verify that the indicated follow-up action \noccurred and track the implementation of follow-up actions.  \n \n8.  To  the  extent  that  deficiencies  are  identified  in  its  weekly  review,  QAD  will \ncommunicate with the command/boroughs as needed (e.g., insufficient Stop Report \nnarratives, improper stops, frisks, and/or searches, failure to activate BWCs, Stop \nReports not approved in a timely manner, business cards not being offered).  \n \n9.  QAD  will  also  review  command  responses  to  the  quarterly  reports  to  determine \nwhether  further  investigation  revealed  no  deficiency,  or  the  command  addressed \ndeficiencies noted in the audit. \n \n10. Review of the Command’s Self-Inspections of Stop Reports: \na.  The two most recent self-inspections are reviewed. \nb.  Identify  the  Stop  Reports/BWC  videos  that  were  audited  by  QAD  and  the \ncommand during the self-inspection process and conduct an audit of those self \ninspection reports for consistency.  \ni.  For the Stop Report and BWC video, a comparison is made by QAD and \nthe Command to determine if QAD’s audit findings are consistent with \nthe command’s findings, including the self-inspection appendix. \nii.  QAD will review command responses to the quarterly reports to determine \nwhether further investigation revealed no deficiency, or the command \naddressed deficiencies noted in the audit.  \n \nPage 6 of 11 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 778-1   Filed 06/15/20   Page 7 of 11\n \n \nII. TRESPASS ARRESTS AUDIT  \nA. Sample:  \nAt a minimum, fifty percent (50%) of Trespass arrests in and around NYCHA buildings \nor TAP buildings will be audited on a weekly basis when criminal trespass was a charge in a \nNYCHA/TAP building. QAD will obtain the Trespass Crimes - Fact Sheet and Supporting \nDeposition (PD 351-144) (“TCFS”) for the arrests to be audited.   \nB.  Substantive Audit Procedures: \nThe objectives of the substantive audit procedures for the Trespass Arrests Audit are as \nfollows: (1) was a TCFS prepared; (2) did the officer sufficiently articulate in the TCFS a basis \nfor approach; (3) did the officer sufficiently articulate probable cause and did the arrest adhere to \nthe Department’s Criminal Trespass Arrest Policy; (4) whether a Stop Report should have been \nprepared as a result of the encounter; and (5) whether the BWC video of the encounter is \nconsistent with the TCFS/arrest documents. \n1.  Review Trespass Crimes – Fact Sheet: \na.  Determine if TCFS is prepared.  \nb.  Review TCFS to determine if the officer sufficiently described the factors that \nled him/her to approach and question the individual.   \nc.  Review  the  TCFS/arrest  documents  and  determine  whether  the  officer \nsufficiently  articulated  probable  cause  and  the  arrest  adhered  to  the \nDepartment’s Criminal Trespass Arrest Policy. \nd.  Determine whether a Level 3 stop occurred and if so, whether a Stop Report \nwas prepared. \n \n2.  BWC review  \na.  Review the BWC video with corresponding TCFS/arrest documents for one \n(1) TAP and one (1) NYCHA arrest for each command per week. \nb.  Review to determine whether BWC videos are recorded. If a Trespass Arrest \nselected has no BWC video, the command will be marked deficient for the \nencounter recorded. \nc.  Review to determine whether BWC videos captured the encounter completely. \nd.  Review to determine whether the TCFS/Arrest Documents and/or Stop Report \nare consistent with the BWC videos.  \ni.  Is the approach reported in the TCFS consistent with the BWC \nrecording of the approach? If not, record how they are inconsistent. \nii.  Is the arrest reported in the arrest documentation consistent with \nthe BWC recording of the arrest?  If not, report how they are \ninconsistent.  \nPage 7 of 11 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 778-1   Filed 06/15/20   Page 8 of 11\n \n \ne.  If a Stop Report was prepared for a TAP/NYCHA arrest, it must be included \nin the Stop Report sample and evaluated accordingly.  \nf.  Review the video for compliance with the Right to Know Act. \ng.  Review the video for compliance with consent to search policy if a consent \nsearch was conducted (e.g., did the officer ask for consent to search in the \nappropriate manner).  \n \n3.  QAD  will  reach  out  to  the  command/boroughs,  as  needed  regarding  TCFS \ndeficiencies.  \n4.  As  described  in  Patrol  Guide  212-59  and  212-60,  additional  guidance  should  be \nconsidered during this review:  \na.  Officers may not conduct a reasonable suspicion stop pursuant to P.G. 212-11 \nor arrest any person for a violation of Housing Authority rules, unless the rule \nviolation is also a criminal offense. \nb.  Mere lingering in a common area, without more, is not a criminal offense for \nwhich a person may be stopped or arrested.  \nc.  Mere presence near, entry into or exit out of a Housing Authority building or a \nTAP building, without more, is not sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion \nto stop a person on suspicion of trespass nor is it an objective credible reason \nto approach and question any person. \nd.  A person’s silence or refusal to provide information or identification when \nquestioned by the police does not support reasonable suspicion to stop or \nprobable cause to arrest. \ne.  A person should not be arrested on the basis of trespassing in a restricted area \nof a building – including the roof, roof landing or boiler room – in the absence \nof conspicuously posted rules, unless the officer knows or has other credible \ninformation that the person knows that their presence in the restricted area is \nprohibited. \nf.  If  an  individual  was  stopped  based  upon  Reasonable  Suspicion,  or  a \nreasonable person would not have felt free to leave under the circumstances, a \nStop Report must be completed pursuant to P.G. 212-11. \n \nIII.   POLICE INITIATED ENFORCEMENT AUDIT \nA. Sample:  \nPolice Initiated Enforcement arrests will be audited on a weekly basis for each month from \nthe sample population. Each week, the one (1) most recent PIE arrest (i.e., CPCS, CPW, \nTrespass, and those arrests where PSNY is the complainant on the Complaint Report) will \nbe selected for a command. The arrests must be the result of police initiated enforcement \nbut will exclude all arrests that were initiated by a VTL crime or infraction.  \nPage 8 of 11 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 778-1   Filed 06/15/20   Page 9 of 11\n \n \n      B. Substantive Audit Procedures: \nThe objectives of the substantive audit procedures for Police Initiated Enforcement: (1) to \ndetermine  if  the  officer  sufficiently  articulated  probable  cause  for  the  arrest;  and  (2) \nwhether a Stop Report may have been required to detect any underreporting of Level 3 \nstops.  \n1.  Review arrest documents: \na.  Determine if the officer sufficiently articulated probable cause for the arrest.  \nb.  Determine whether a Stop Report may have been required. \ni.  Activity  Log  entries  and  Court  Affidavits  (when  applicable)  are        \nevaluated to determine if the officer sufficiently articulated probable \ncause  for  the  arrest;  and  whether  a  Stop  Report  may  have  been \nrequired. \nc.  Review  BWC  videos  with  corresponding  Arrest  Reports  for  each \ncommand’s weekly PIE run: \na.  If the Arrest Report selected has no BWC video, the command will \nbe marked deficient for the encounter recorded.  \nd.  Review to determine whether BWC videos captured the encounter completely. \ne.  Determine whether the encounter involved a Level 3 stop. \nf.  Determine  whether  Stop  Reports  are  prepared  for  Level  3  encounters \nindicated on BWC videos. \ng.  Review  to  determine  whether  BWC  videos  are  consistent  with  the  arrest \ndocuments. \nh.  If a Stop Report was prepared for a PIE arrest, it must be included in the Stop \nReport sample and evaluated accordingly.  \ni.  Review the video for compliance with the Right to Know Act. \nj.  Review the video for compliance with consent to search policy if a consent \nsearch was conducted. \n2.  To  the  extent  that  deficiencies  are  identified  in  its  weekly  review,  QAD  will \ncommunicate with the command/boroughs as needed (e.g., Stop Reports not approved \nin a timely manner, business cards not being offered).  \n \n3.  QAD will also review command responses to QAD’s quarterly reports to determine \nwhether  further  investigation  revealed  no  deficiency,  or  the  command  addressed \ndeficiencies noted in the audit. \n \n4.  Review of the Command’s Police Initiated Enforcement Self-Inspections: \na.  The two (2) most recent PIE self-inspections are reviewed. \nb.  Identify the  Arrest  Reports  that  were  audited  by  QAD  and  the  command \nduring the self-inspection process.  \nPage 9 of 11 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 778-1   Filed 06/15/20   Page 10 of 11\n \n \ni.  For  the  Arrest  Report,  a  comparison  is  made  by  QAD  and  the \nCommand, to determine whether QAD’s audit findings are consistent \nwith the commands. \nIV. RAND AUDIT \nA. Sample: \nApproximately  four  (4)  commands  (i.e.,  precincts,  police  service  areas  and  transit \ndistricts)  will  be  evaluated  for  a  seven-day  period  each  week  in  2020.  All  patrol \ncommands  will  be  audited  semi-annually  and  all  Police  Service  Areas  and  Transit \nDistricts will be audited annually. The objective of this audit is to detect underreporting.  \n \nB.  Substantive Audit Procedures: \n1.  A search in the ICAD system is conducted using the keywords: “stopped,” “holding,” \n“show-up” and “warrant check.” \n \n2.  The results are examined and categorized as follows: false positive, violation, traffic \nviolation, probable cause, aided case, complainant/victim on the scene, Stop Report \nfound, or further investigation required. \n \n3.  For encounters which may have required the preparation of a Stop Report, check the \nStop Report database to determine if Stop Reports were prepared. \n \n4.  When a Stop Report is not indicated during a final disposition or not located by QAD, \nthe Communications Division is supplied with a list of ICAD events identified for \nfurther review.  An audio review is conducted of each event to further ascertain if a \nperson was stopped and if a Stop Report was necessary.   \n \n5.  The  Stop  Report  database  is  again  examined  to  determine  if  a  Stop  Report  was \nprepared. \n \n6.  For encounters which were required to be recorded on BWC and which also appeared \nto require the preparation of a Stop Report, review of BWC video will be conducted. \nA maximum of five (5) BWC videos will be reviewed for each Command. \n \n7.  In instances where further investigation is required and a Stop Report cannot be \nfound,  a  communication  regarding  the  incident  is  sent  through  channels  to  the \nBorough Investigations Unit for investigation and a response is required. \n \nPage 10 of 11 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 778-1   Filed 06/15/20   Page 11 of 11\n \n \n8.  QAD will review responses to determine whether deficiencies were addressed and \nStop Reports were prepared, if necessary, and this information will be tracked.   \nPage 11 of 11 \n ",

First,  the  City  has  no  answer  for  the  Plaintiffs’  core  argument  that  NYPD  street \nencounters— even when conducted in the name of COVID-19 enforcement— fall squarely within \nthe ambit of this Court’s Liability and Remedial Orders in Floyd. The City mistakenly pins its \ndefense on the purpose of the stop and/or investigative encounter, as though that has some bearing \non whether the police conduct at issue on this motion constitutes investigative encounters that meet \nthe definition of a Level 3 Terry Stop. But the fact that the stops in this case were made pursuant \nto and/or were otherwise related in some way to the NYPD’s COVID-19 enforcement efforts, \nrather than for some other purpose such as general enforcement of the criminal laws, does not \nexempt them from the Floyd Orders and the Davis Settlement. \n  Second, the City ignores the severe racial disparities in COVID-19 enforcement which \nPlaintiffs cite in their moving papers, disparities that closely resemble the disparities the Court \nfound to be evidence of 14th Amendment violations in its Floyd Liability Opinion and which, like \nthose prior disparities, cannot be plausibly explained by any race-neutral factors. Given the \nNYPD’s  established  history  of  intentional  racial  discrimination,  these  recent  disparities  are \npowerful circumstantial evidence of ongoing NYPD violations of the Court’s prior Floyd Orders \nand the Davis settlement.  \n  Third, in disputing factually some of the incidents referenced in Plaintiffs’ moving papers, \nthe Defendants make the point that only a careful consideration of all the facts related to the \nCOVID-19  enforcement  must  be  made  equally  available  to  the  Plaintiffs.  It  is  therefore \ndemonstrably unfair for the Defendants to oppose Plaintiffs’ discovery demands with respect to \nCOVID-19 enforcement, while at the same time relying on some of the very information the NYPD \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 6 of 21\nrefuses to produce to defend its conduct. Moreover, Defendants’ reliance on this information \nunderscores its clear relevance to the serious compliance questions raised by Plaintiffs’ motion \nand should therefore be produced to Plaintiffs immediately.  \n  In sum, Plaintiffs’ motion should be granted in its entirety.  \nARGUMENT  \nPOINT I \nNYPD COVID-19 ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO THE \nREQUIREMENTS OF THE FLOYD ORDERS AND DAVIS SETTLEMENT  \n \nA.  NYPD COVID-19 Enforcement Actions Often Begin with Level 3 Terry Stops  \n \nDefendants’ attempts to distinguish the NYPD’s COVID-19 and curfew enforcement \nactions from the stop-and-frisk practices covered by the Floyd and Davis monitorship must fail \nbecause most, if not all, of these enforcement actions commence as—or pass through—a Level 3 \nTerry stop. This is so because, notwithstanding Defendants’ contention to the contrary, Floyd Dkt. \nNo. 771 at 22–28, in the vast majority of these encounters, officers do not automatically have \nprobable cause of a social distancing, curfew, or mask violation when they first observe and \napproach an individual on the street. If it were otherwise, these rules, while they remain in effect, \nwould make an individual’s mere existence on the City’s streets in the presence of other people, \nor during the hours of the curfew, an immediately arrestable offense. \nThe language of and subsequently-issued guidance on the relevant executive orders which \nthe NYPD is enforcing clearly illustrate the flaw in Defendants’ argument. The Governor’s \nExecutive Order 202.10 reads, “Non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason \n(e.g. parties, celebrations or social events) are canceled or postponed at this time,” thus explicitly \nexempting  essential  workers  from  the  social  distancing  requirement.  In  addition,  in  press \nconferences held prior to and after the issuance of this executive order, Governor Cuomo expressly \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 7 of 21\nclarified that individuals must practice social distancing of at six feet from others outside of their \nhousehold.1 Mayor de Blasio issued similar guidance for his analogous Emergency Executive \nOrder  No.  103.2  Executive  Order  202.17,  meanwhile,  expressly  limits  the  face  covering \nrequirement to “any individual who is over age two and able to medically tolerate a face-covering.” \nSimilarly, the Mayor’s curfew orders expressly exempted essential workers and required that the \noffense be “knowing,” such that an order to disperse was arguably a prerequisite to arrest.3  \nThe exemptions set forth above are not provisos that require an affirmative defense. The \nplain language in Executive Order 202.17 indicates an intention to provide exceptions—namely \nfor those under the age of two, or those medically unable to tolerate wearing a mask. The \nexemptions are also not conditional as the Defendants suggest in referencing the now-repealed \nanti-mask law, Penal Law 240.35(4). These were explicitly exempted in the Executive Order \nand/or accompanying guidance and should therefore be construed as exceptions, consistent with \npublicly released City and State guidance and CDC guidelines.4 \n Thus, the plain language of the executive orders, coupled with numerous exemptions  \n                                                           \n1 See https://abc7ny.com/governor-cuomo-gatherings-social-distancing-coronavirus-in-new-york/6205611/; \nhttps://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-new-york-state-pause-executive-order \n2 See Mayor’s Office Press Conference March 25, 2020 (“If you’re a family that people live under the same roof and \nyou want to play with each other on the basketball court, that’s fine.”) https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-\nmayor/news/192-20/transcript-mayor-de-blasio-holds-media-availability-covid-19 \n3 See City of New York, Office of the Mayor, Emergency Executive Order No. 118 (June 1, 2020), available at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-118.pdf; Mayor’s Office Curfew \nFAQ’s available at https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/counseltothemayor/downloads/Curfew-\nFAQ.pdf?fbclid=IwAR13YXKsm_YZMjwJY-EYM32CwP4Sh5uyDCpQMdHHBB2mziDS52c7juEqQMg  \n4 It has been held that said distinction between “exceptions” and “provisos” should not be so mechanically applied \nthat substance yields to form. See People v. Baur, 102 Misc.2d 971, 973, 423 N.Y.S.2d 800 (Nassau Co. Dist. Ct. \n1980); see also People v. Devinny, 227 N.Y. 397, 401 (1919). In addition, the distinction between a “proviso” and \nan “exception” may be wholly disregarded if necessary to give effect to the “manifest intention of the Legislature” \n(McKinney's Cons. Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes § 211, at 369). Therefore, reference to the Governor’s and \nMayor’s public statements providing guidance on compliance with the executive orders indicating that members of \nthe same household and essential workers could be gathered together in public should be construed to intend an \nexplicit exception to the orders, consistent with CDC guidelines on the definition of social distancing. See, e.g., \nCenters for Disease Control, Social Distancing, (visited June 13, 2020) (specifying that social distancing applies to \npersons outside of one’s household), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-\ndistancing.html,  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 8 of 21\nincluded in the subsequent guidance from the Governor and Mayor, make clear that NYPD officers \ndo not automatically have probable cause to arrest or summons any group of individuals they see \nstanding on a public street or in the shared outdoor spaces of NYCHA housing without face \ncoverings. “In determining probable cause, the standard to be applied is that it must appear to be \nat least more probable than not that a crime has taken place . . . for conduct equally compatible \nwith guilt or innocence will not suffice.” People v. Vandover, 20 N.Y.3d 235, 237 (2012); see also \nPeople v. De Bour, 40 N.Y.2d 210, 216 (1976) (“We have frequently rejected the notion that \nbehavior which is susceptible of innocent as well as culpable interpretation, will constitute \nprobable cause.”). Without a further inquiry into whether an exemption applies or not, the behavior \nof being in public, even when standing within a group, is equally compatible with innocence. An \nofficer would therefore need to at least inquire whether individuals were not members of the same \nhousehold or essential workers, and/or did not appear to suffer from a medical condition that made \nthem unable to tolerate a mask in order to establish probable cause of a violation of one or more \nof the executive orders.  \nIn other words, any NYPD officer’s encounter with an individual on the street or in the \nshared  outdoor  space  of  a  NYCHA  complex  under  the  auspices  of  COVID-19  or  curfew \nenforcement is, at most a Level 3 Terry stop premised on reasonable suspicion of a social \ndistancing, mask, and/or curfew violation and requiring further investigation to verify or dispel the \nofficer’s suspicion. See, e.g., United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 544 (1985) \n(“detention for the period of time necessary to either verify or dispel the suspicion was not \nunreasonable”) (plurality opinion); Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 500 (1983) (investigative \nmethods in a Terry stop “should be the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or \ndispel the officer's suspicion”). For this reason, NYPD COVID-19 enforcement encounters fall \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 9 of 21\nsquarely within the Court’s jurisdiction. \nB.  The NYPD Uses COVID-19 Enforcement as a Pretext to Conduct Terry Stops, \nFrisks, Searches, and Arrests for Criminal Law Enforcement Purposes  \n \nOtherwise lawful pretextual seizures violate the Constitution when conducted on the basis \nof race. See United States v. Scopo, 19 F.3d 777, 786 (2d Cir. 1994) (“Though the Fourth \nAmendment  permits  a pretext arrest,  if  otherwise  supported  by  probable  cause,  the  Equal \nProtection  Clause  still  imposes  restraint  on  impermissibly  class-based  discriminations.”) \n(Newman, C.J., concurring). Plaintiffs’ opening motion papers include compelling evidence of \nNYPD officers using their authority to enforce COVID-19 public health mandates—i.e., social \ndistancing guidelines, facemask requirements, and the recently lifted curfew—as a pretext to \napproach and initiate Terry stops and other De Bour investigative encounters with Black and \nLatinx individuals for criminal law enforcement purposes unrelated to COVID-19 enforcement, \nencounters which clearly fall within the scope of the Floyd orders and Davis and Ligon settlements. \nSee Floyd Dkt. Nos. 760 at 21; 761-1–761-4, Ligon Dkt. No. 402 at 3. Defendants’ responses to \nthis evidence do little to nothing to undermine it.  \n   First, Defendants do not dispute at all the accuracy of Ligon Plaintiffs’ accounts of \nNYPD’s encounters with the public that began with apparent social-distancing enforcement \nwithout probable cause before escalating through the levels of De Bour and resulted in an arrest \nfor conduct that occurred after the officers approached, as well as instances where officers asked \npeople outside to disperse or cease an outdoor activity—even where a person was alone or outside \nwith people who live in the same household—and then asked accusatory questions, demanded and \nseized identification, conducted frisks, and used force.” Ligon Dkt. No. 420 at 3. The declaration \nof Communities United for Police Reform (“CPR”) attests that the organization has received \nincreased calls reporting pretextual and discriminatory social distancing enforcement consistent \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 10 of 21\nwith Ligon Plaintiffs’ assessment and reinforces the conclusion that the NYPD is using COVID-\n19 public health mandates as a pretext to stop Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Floyd Dkt. No. 761-\n1 ¶¶ 15–18. Defendants, however, attempt to minimize CPR’s institutional experience as lacking \n“persuasiveness  and  candor.”  Floyd  Dkt.  No.  771  at  35.  Defendants’  formalistic  denial  is \nunpersuasive in light of Plaintiffs’ considerable pre-discovery evidence that the NYPD is targeting \nBlack and Latinx New Yorkers in its COVID-19 enforcement, the NYPD’s own data which \nconfirms a large number of its COVID-related arrests were only “marginally related” to social \ndistancing or mask violations, see Floyd Dkt. No. 773-1 at 13–14, and CPR’s well-documented \nhistory of working closely with members of communities most heavily impacted by the NYPD’s \nracially discriminatory stop-and-frisk practices.  \n   Equally unavailing are Defendants’ self-serving factual and legal conclusions drawn from \nbody-worn camera (“BWC”) footage they are withholding from Plaintiffs surrounding Mr. Merete, \nMr. Harris, and Ms. Pope’s encounters with the police. See Floyd Dkt. No. 771 at 36–39; \nDefendant cannot simultaneously shield information from Plaintiffs’ scrutiny while relying on it \nto oppose the Plaintiffs’ motion on the merits. See Kinoy v. Mitchell, 67 F.R.D. 1, 15 (S.D.N.Y. \n1975) (“Either the documents are privileged, and the litigation must continue as best it can without \nthem, or they should be disclosed at least to the parties, in which case the Court will rule after full \nargument on the merits.”). The Court should therefore disregard Defendants’ attempt to undercut \nthe declarations of Messrs. Merete and Harris and Ms. Pope regarding pretextual COVID-19 \npolicing or order production of the BWC footage, including the footage related to Mr. Harris that \nwas filed under seal and ex parte, Floyd Dkt. Nos. 772, 775, and provide Plaintiffs an opportunity \nto address whatever the footage may actually contain. See Vining v. Runyon, 99 F.3d 1056, 1057 \n(11th Cir. 1996) (“Our adversarial legal system generally does not tolerate ex parte determinations \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 11 of 21\non the merits of a civil case. . . The right to due process encompasses the individual’s right to be \naware of and refute the evidence against the merits of his case.”) (internal citations omitted); Smith \nv. Greene, 06-CV-505, 2009 WL 10722414, *2 (N.D.N.Y. June 8, 2009) (same); see also Ass’n \nfor Reduction of Violence v. Hall, 734 F.2d 63, 67–68 (1st Cir. 1984) (vacating summary judgment \ngranted to defendant where district court had relied on documents as to which it had denied \nplaintiffs discovery). \nPOINT II \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION IS NOT PROCEDURALLY DEFECTIVE  \n \n  Defendants’  arguments  that  the  Floyd  and  Davis  Plaintiffs’  motion  is  “procedurally \ndefective” are meritless. To begin with, contrary to Defendants’ assertion, see Floyd Dkt. No. 771 \nat 17, both the Floyd and Davis Plaintiff classes do encompass persons impacted by the NYPD’s \nsocial distancing enforcement practices because, as discussed in Plaintiffs’ opening brief and \nherein, these practices often involve racially-motivated Terry stops, frisks, and searches of Black \nand Latinx individuals, including those who reside in public housing. See Floyd Dkt. No. 760 at \n4, 13–14. \n  Defendants’ claim that Plaintiffs were required but failed to seek discovery related to the \nNYPD’s COVID-19 enforcement efforts through the Monitor rather than directly from the City is \nnot supported by the record. First, the Floyd Remedial Order contains no such requirement, nor \ndoes  it  include—in  its  detailed  list  of  12  Monitor  roles  and  responsibilities—resolution  of \ndiscovery disputes between the parties or the determination of what remedial-phase discovery \nFloyd Plaintiffs are or may be entitled to receive from the NYPD. Floyd Dkt. No. 372 at 12–13. \nWhen contending that “for six years requests for discovery from NYPD are made through the \nmonitor,” Floyd Dkt. No. 771 at 18, Defendants ignore that Plaintiffs’ most significant and \nlongstanding remedial-phase discovery requests—requests for periodic opportunities to observe \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 12 of 21\nthe NYPD’s various Court-mandated stop-and-frisk and biased policing-related training classes—\nwere made directly to the NYPD and resolved by the parties independently from the Monitor, who \nexpressly indicated that he did not have the authority to compel the NYPD to provide the requested \ndiscovery to Plaintiffs. Moreover, the Monitor was aware of the Plaintiffs’ COVID-19-related \ndiscovery requests several weeks before the filing of the instant motion. Notwithstanding that \nknowledge, Plaintiffs are unaware of any action the Monitor has taken himself to obtain the \ninformation that Plaintiffs requested from the City or to otherwise address Plaintiffs’ requests. \nGiven the emergent situation, Plaintiffs had no choice but to seek relief from the Court.  \n  Finally,  Defendants’  argument  that  Plaintiffs  have  no  right  to  seek  remedial-phase \ndiscovery independently from the Monitor because such right is not expressly conferred in the \nFloyd Remedial Order, Floyd Dkt. No. 771 at 18–19, is not supported by legal precedent. As \ndiscussed in Plaintiffs’ opening brief, federal courts have repeatedly granted prevailing plaintiffs \nremedial-phase discovery relevant to assessing defendants’ compliance with prior injunctions, \neven  when  the  prior  injunctive  orders  themselves  did  not  expressly  confer  remedial-phase \ndiscovery rights to those plaintiffs. See, e.g., Cal. Dep’t of Social Serv’s v. Leavitt, 523 F.3d 1025, \n1033 (9th Cir. 2008); Palmer v. Rice, 231 F.R.D. 21, 25 (D.D.C. 2005); Campaign for S. Equal. \nv. Bryant, 197 F. Supp. 3d 905, 914 (S.D. Miss. 2016); Abdi v. McAleenan, No. 1:17-CV-00721 \nEAW, 2019 WL 1915306 (W.D.N.Y. April 30, 2019).5 Those Plaintiffs were entitled to discovery \nbecause “significant questions regarding noncompliance [with a court order] ha[d] been raised,” \nAbdi, 2019 WL 1915306 at *2; Leavitt, 523 F.3d at 1033–34—a standard which, as discussed \nbelow and in their opening brief, Floyd and Davis Plaintiffs clearly satisfy. Defendants suggest \n                                                           \n5 Defendants’ reliance in their opposition on their own renditions of some of the very materials (e.g. body-worn \ncamera videos, arrest records and data regarding NYPD COVID-19 enforcement actions) that Plaintiffs seek in their \ndiscovery requests, see Floyd Dkt. Nos. 771 at 33–40; 773-1 at 3–8, underscores the relevance of these materials to \nthe question of whether the NYPD’s COVID-19 enforcement practices violate the requirements of the Floyd Orders.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 13 of 21\nthat these discovery rights are somehow diminished by the presence of the Court-Appointed \nMonitor but, tellingly, do not cite a single case to support their assertion. Instead, Plaintiffs cite \nample authority that remedial-phase discovery is routinely granted to plaintiffs in institutional \nreform cases involving police departments and other municipal agency defendants notwithstanding \nthe presence of a court-appointed monitor overseeing and assessing those defendants’ compliance \nwith a court-ordered injunction or consent decree. See Floyd Dkt. No. 760 at 22–23; Dkt. No. 771 \nat 19. There is no reason for the Court to depart from this common practice here.   \nPOINT III \nNYPD COVID-19 ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES APPEAR TO VIOLATE THE \nCOURT’S PRIOR ORDERS IN FLOYD AND THE DAVIS SETTLEMENT  \n \nA.  The Current Public Health Crisis and Protests Against Police Abuses Do Not \nExempt COVID-19 and Curfew Enforcement from Constitutional Mandates  \n \nDefendants disturbingly imply that the unconstitutional exercise of racially discriminatory \nstops, summonses, and arrests is excusable because these actions are being taken to enforce \n“emergency orders during twin crises of an ongoing pandemic and widespread demonstrations and \nunrest,” and should thus be “analyzed under a different and more deferential standard than \ngovernment actions in the normal course.” Floyd Dkt. No. 771 at 14, 16. No such deference to the \nNYPD is warranted here. There is no question that the current pandemic presents a grave threat to \npublic health. However, public health emergencies do not provide license to government officials \nto resort to discriminatory policing. As the Second Circuit has recently warned, “constitutional \nboundaries are not transgressed by considerations of expediency.” Fed. Defs. of N.Y., Inc. v. Fed. \nBureau of Prisons, 954 F.3d 118, 135 (2d Cir. 2020); see also Yang v. Kellner, 20 Civ. 3325 (AT), \n2020 WL 2129597 (S.D.N.Y, May 5, 2020). That there is currently a pandemic does not excuse \nthe NYPD’s discriminatory policing. A Terry stop made in the context of COVID-19 or curfew \nenforcement, like Terry stops made for general criminal law enforcement purposes, must comply \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 14 of 21\nwith the requirements of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Floyd Liability, Remedial \nand Racial Profiling Policy Orders, and the Davis Settlement. As discussed below and in Plaintiffs’ \nopening brief, they often do not.  \nB.  There Is Compelling Circumstantial Evidence that the NYPD Has Engaged in \nRacially Discriminatory COVID-19 Enforcement and thus Violated the Court’s \nOrders to Remedy Its Finding of Intentional Discrimination  \n \nDefendants’ efforts to dismiss circumstantial evidence of racially discriminatory COVID-\n19 enforcement as irrelevant completely ignore the procedural posture of this case. This Court has \nalready found the City to be liable for intentional discrimination in its stop-and-frisk practices, and \nthe central purpose of this monitoring is to remedy the entrenched racial bias that pervaded those \npractices throughout the entire Department. Within the challenging remedial process of reforming \nthese practices, it is remarkable for Defendants to suggest that circumstantial evidence of racial \nbias in COVID-19-related summons and arrests does not raise valid and substantive concerns that \nthe stops preceding those summons and arrests were likewise racially discriminatory in violation \nof this Court’s prior orders. \nLongstanding federal case law regarding court monitoring of school desegregation cases—\nremedying  prior  findings  of  intentional  discrimination—is  instructive  here.  In  the  school \ndesegregation context, a defendant that was found to have intentionally discriminated ordinarily \nbears the burden of demonstrating that the vestiges of its prior wrong have been eradicated. See \nBelk v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg Bd. of Educ., 269 F.3d 305, 327 (4th Cir. 2001) (“[O]nce a court \nhas found an unlawful dual school system, those alleging the existence of racial disparities are \nentitled to the presumption that current disparities are causally related to prior segregation, and the \nburden of proving otherwise rests on the defendants.”) (internal citation omitted); NAACP v. Duval \nCty Sch., 273 F.3d 960, 966 (11th Cir. 2001) (when a school board operated de jure segregated \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 15 of 21\nschools in the past, “there is a presumption that any current racial disparities are the result of its \npast unlawful conduct”) (citing Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 208–09 (1973)). In \nArthur v. Nyquist—which examined whether Buffalo’s schools were intentionally segregated—\nthe court described that burden as “considerable.” 415 F. Supp. 904, 913 (W.D.N.Y. 1976) (aff’d \nin  part,  rev’d  in  part,  573  F.2d  134  (2d  Cir.  1978)).  Intentional  discrimination  in  police \ndepartments is no less egregious—and certainly no less urgent to remedy—than in public school \nsettings. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of \nEducation made clear that “a school desegregation case does not differ fundamentally from other \ncases involving the framing of equitable measures to repair the denial of a constitutional right.” \n402 U.S. 1, 15–16 (1971).  \n  Moreover,  because  of  its  prior  intentional  discrimination  finding,  this  Court  should \nconsider the significant racial disparities in social distancing summonses and arrests within the \ncontext of the NYPD’s history of racially discriminatory practices—not, as the City would have \nit, in isolation, as if that history never occurred. The Supreme Court endorsed this holistic inquiry \nin Keyes, where it found that discriminatory practices in one area are “not devoid of probative \nvalue” when assessing possible additional discrimination in another. 413 U.S. at 207 (citing 2 J. \nWigmore, Evidence 200 (3d ed. 1940)). In fact, courts have long held that past discriminatory \nbehavior is, at a minimum, probative of intent. See, e.g., N. Carolina State Conference of NAACP \nv. McCrory, 831 F.3d 204, 223 (4th Cir. 2016) (state’s “shameful history of past discrimination” \nshould inform inquiry into voter suppression) (citing Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. \nHousing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977)); Chabab Lubavitch of Litchfield Cty., Inc. v. \nLitchfield Historic Dist. Commission, 768 F.3d 183, 199 (2d Cir. 2014) (“In determining whether \na facially neutral statute was selectively enforced, we look to both direct and circumstantial \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 16 of 21\nevidence of discriminatory intent, as instructed by the Supreme Court in Arlington Heights.”). If \npast discrimination is probative for court determinations of intentional discrimination in the first \ninstance, surely it is even more probative when there has already been a finding of discrimination, \nand the court is called upon to determine whether that discrimination is ongoing and not remedied.  \n  Defendants do not even attempt to refute Plaintiffs’ circumstantial evidence of the NYPD’s \nracially  selective  enforcement  of  social  distancing  directives.  Defendants  make  conclusory \nassumptions that NYPD COVID-19 enforcement is not based on race, claiming that it was based \non the “discretion of the individual officer involved who observed unlawful conduct” and thus had \nreasonable suspicion. But this Court already held that “plaintiffs’ racial discrimination claim does \nnot depend on proof that stops of blacks and Hispanics are suspicionless” because “[t]he Equal \nProtection  Clause’s  prohibition  on  selective  enforcement  means  that  suspicious  blacks  and \nHispanics may not be treated differently by the police than equally suspicious whites.” Dkt. No. \n373 at 191–92. The preliminary data presented by Plaintiffs show that majority-white precincts \nreceived more 311 complaints. While Defendants contend that most precincts recorded fewer than \n10 summonses through mid-May, Floyd Dkt. No. 773-1 at 36, this does not rebut Plaintiffs’ main \nobjection: four of the five precincts with the most summonses and arrests were majority Black or \nLatinx and were not among those with the highest number of complaints. And their response that \nCOVID-19-related summonses and arrests were rare and used as a last resort by officers, Dkt. No. \n773-1 at 30, fails to account for the inverse relationship between 311 calls and the number of \nsummonses  and  arrests  within  precincts.  Plaintiffs  and  this  Court,  therefore,  are  left  with \nunanswered questions about the details of the NYPD’s social distancing enforcement that demands \ndiscovery and investigation, and those concerns apply equally to the NYPD’s curfew enforcement.  \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 17 of 21\nPOINT IV \nA TEMPORARY MORATORIUM AND MONITOR INVESTIGATION OF NYPD \nCOVID-19 ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES IS WARRANTED  \n \nA.  The Preliminary Injunction Standard Does Not Apply to This Post-Judgment \nRelief Request  \n \nDefendants’ attempt to shoehorn the preliminary injunction standard into the analysis of \nPlaintiffs’ request for the temporary moratorium on NYPD social distancing enforcement, see \nFloyd Dkt. No. 771 at 11, 40–46, has no basis in law. “The purpose of a preliminary injunction is \nmerely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.” Univ. \nof Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981); Irish Lesbian & Gay Org. v. Giuliani, 143 F.3d \n638, 644 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting Camenisch). Here, the Court has already held a full trial on the \nmerits and entered a judgment of liability and permanent injunction against Defendants in Floyd \nwhich the NYPD appears to have subsequently violated through the racially discriminatory way it \nhas conducted COVID-19 enforcement. Thus, Plaintiffs request a temporary moratorium on the \nNYPD’s COVID-19 enforcement efforts to prevent further violations of the Court’s previously \nentered final judgment on the merits and permanent injunction. There is no reason for the Court to \ndetermine whether Plaintiffs’ are entitled to a preliminary injunction since they already obtained a \npermanent injunction against the Defendants for the conduct at issue in this motion.   \nIndeed, when presented with evidence that a defendant has not fully complied with an \nearlier injunction, federal courts have not hesitated to use their broad inherent equitable powers to \nenforce prior orders by imposing further (and more prescriptive) injunctive relief to ensure \ncompliance with the earlier injunction. See e.g., Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 686–89 (1979); \nDamus v. Wolf, No. 18-578, 2020 WL 601629, at *2–5 (D.D.C. Feb. 7. 2020); Baez v. N.Y.C.H.A., \n13 Civ. 8916, 2015 WL 9809872, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2015); United States v. Visa USA, Inc., \n98 Civ. 7076, 2007 WL 1741885, at *12–15 (S.D.N.Y. June 15, 2007). The only limitation on \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 18 of 21\nsuch further injunctive relief is that it “be narrowly tailored to remedy the specific harm alleged,” \nMelendres v. Maricopa City, 897 F.3d 1217, 1221 (9th Cir. 2018) (internal citations omitted); \nDamus 2020 WL 601629, at *2; Visa USA, Inc., 2007 WL 1741885, at *14, which, as discussed \nin Plaintiffs’ opening brief, the temporary moratorium is. See Floyd Dkt. No. 760 at 29-30.  \nB.  A Temporary Moratorium Is Still Necessary to Prevent Continued Violations of \nClass Members’ Constitutional Rights  \n \nRecent data Plaintiffs obtained from the CCRB through a Freedom of Information Law \n(FOIL) request suggests that NYPD officers have continued to engage in improper COVID-19 \nenforcement actions, including stops, frisks, and searches, since the City’s announcement in mid-\nMay of a so-called “shift” in COVID-19 enforcement practices, and that such actions have targeted \nBlack New Yorkers. The CCRB data indicates that the CCRB has received at least 19 civilian \ncomplaints stemming from NYPD COVID-19 enforcement incidents occurring after May 15 in \nwhich the complainant made an allegation of an improper stop, frisk, and/or search, and for the 11 \ncomplainants where the race of the complainant was known, all of the complainants were Black. \nCharney Reply Decl., Ex. 2. Therefore, notwithstanding the “shift” that the City claims it made in \nits COVID-19 enforcement efforts in mid-May, Floyd Dkt. No. 771 at 41–42, there is still a very \nreal risk that Floyd and Davis Plaintiff class members will continue to be subjected to racially \nmotivated, unconstitutional police encounters if the NYPD is allowed to continue to conduct \nCOVID-19-related  enforcement.  And  an  unspecific  and  unverifiable  stated  change  in  an \napparently  discriminatory  NYPD  policing  practice  is  insufficient  to  protect  Plaintiff  class \nmembers’ constitutional rights. Unless and until the Monitor, Court, and Plaintiffs can determine \nwhether and how the NYPD can conduct this enforcement consistently with the requirements of \nthe Floyd Orders, the Davis Settlement, and the Constitution, the social distancing and mask  \nrequirements should be enforced by entities other than the NYPD.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 19 of 21\nC.  A Temporary Moratorium and Monitor Investigation Are in the Public Interest  \n \nTemporarily halting NYPD COVID-19 enforcement until the Monitor, Court, and the \nparties can determine whether and how that enforcement can be conducted consistently with the \nCourt’s prior Floyd orders and constitutional mandates is not against the public interest. After all, \nas this Court has correctly noted, “it is clear and plain that the public interest in liberty and dignity \nunder the Fourth Amendment, and the public interest in equality under the Fourteenth Amendment, \ntrumps  whatever  modicum  of  added  safety  might  theoretically  be  gained  by  the  NYPD \nmaking unconstitutional stops and frisks.” Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F.Supp.2d 668, 673 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal quotations omitted). Moreover, as set forth in Plaintiffs’ opening brief, \nnumerous local elected officials, law enforcement and public health experts, and organizations that \nwork directly with communities of color in New York City hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic \nhave  gone  on  record  expressing  their  strong  belief  that  transferring  enforcement  of  social \ndistancing and mask requirements from the NYPD to other entities would not compromise but \ninstead improve public health and safety outcomes. Floyd Dkt. No. 760 at 25–27.   \nThe City’s arguments about the State’s “broad authority to utilize police powers in the \nevent of a public health emergency,” and the Mayor’s emergency  powers to  enact “social \ndistancing and other protective health measures” to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, Floyd Dkt. \nNo. 771 at 42–43, miss the point because Plaintiffs do not seek to repeal these critical public health \nrules but, rather, to transfer authority to enforce them to entities other than the NYPD. Similarly, \nthe City’s claim that investigating the City’s racially disparate COVID-19 enforcement practices \nwould somehow distract the Monitor from his “important work and obligations under the Floyd \n‘stop-and-frisk’ orders,” Floyd Dkt. No. 771 at 45-46, is a non-sequitur because, as discussed \nabove, the practices themselves implicate and run afoul of those orders and the Davis settlement. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 780   Filed 06/15/20   Page 20 of 21\nCONCLUSION  \n  For the reasons stated above and in Plaintiffs’ opening memorandum of law, Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Emergency Relief should be granted in its entirety. \n \nDated: New York, New York \n  June 15, 2020 \n \n \n \n\\s\\Darius Charney \nCENTER FOR CONSTITUTIONAL \nRIGHTS \nBy: Darius Charney \n       Baher Azmy \n       Omar Farah \n       Guadalupe Aguirre \n666 Broadway, 7th Floor \nNew York, NY 10012 \nTel.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n--------------------------------------------------------\n)( \nJAENON LIGON, et aI., \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \t OPINION AND ORDER \nCITY OF NEW YORK, et aI., \t 12 Civ. 2274 (SAS) \nDefendants. \n--------------------------------------------------------\n)( \nSHIRA A. SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.: \nThis putative class action challenges the New York City Police \nDepartment's implementation of Operation Clean Halls, a program allowing police \nofficers to patrol inside and around thousands ofprivate residential apartment \nbuildings throughout New York City.  Plaintiffs allege that they and their minor \nchildren have been unlawfully stopped, questioned, frisked, and/or arrested in or \naround their homes or their family members' homes. \nPlaintiffs have informed defendants and the Court of their intention to \nmove for a preliminary injunction to prevent police officers from \"stopping people \noutside of Clean Halls buildings because of their proximity to a Clean Halls \nbuilding (whether by virtue of their having exited, trying to enter, or simply being \n1 \n\n\nnear the building).”1  Defendants believe that “the Court should use its equitable\npowers to deny plaintiffs’ application” summarily, prior to the holding of an\nevidentiary hearing.2  Because plaintiffs allege an ongoing and egregious violation\nof their constitutional rights, I decline to deny them the opportunity to seek a\npreliminary remedy. \nPreliminary injunctions, a traditional tool of courts sitting in equity,\nare governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.  The Second Circuit has\nexplained that “[w]hen seeking a preliminary injunction that will affect\ngovernment action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory\nscheme, the moving party must show: (1) it will suffer irreparable harm absent the\ninjunction and (2) a likelihood of success on the merits.”3\nPlaintiffs’ Complaint alleges that\n1 8/16/12 Letter to Court from Christopher Dunn, plaintiffs’ counsel, at\n1 (“Dunn Letter”).\n2 8/14/12 Letter to Court from Mark Zuckerman, defendants’ counsel,\nat 1 (“Zuckerman Letter”).\n3 Rodriguez v. DeBuono, 175 F.3d 227, 233 (2d Cir. 1999) (quotation\nmarks omitted).  In other instances, injunctions may be granted if the movant\nshows “a threat of irreparable injury and either (1) a probability of success on the\nmerits or (2) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of the claims to\nmake them a fair ground of litigation, and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly\nin favor of the moving party.”  Time Warner Cable v. Bloomberg L.P., 118 F.3d\n917, 923 (2d Cir. 1997).  The parties have not yet addressed whether Operation\nClean Halls is conducted “pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme.”\n2\n\n[f]or residents of Clean Halls Buildings and their visitors, merely\nexiting a Clean Halls Building frequently leads to being stopped,\nsearched, and interrogated by NYPD officers on public sidewalks\nand  in  exterior  courtyards.  These  stops  typically  involve  full\nsearches and questioning as to the person’s reason for having been\ninside the building, and frequently result in arrest or the issuance\nof  a  summons  if  the  person  cannot  affirmatively  justify  his\npresence to the police officer’s satisfaction. . . .\nResidents of some Clean Halls Buildings are stopped, questioned,\nand searched by NYPD officers on a regular basis – sometimes\nmultiple  times  a  week.    For  many  young  men  of  color  in\nparticular, being searched and seized by NYPD officers in and\naround  their  homes  has  become  normalized  and  is  simply  a\nroutine part of their lives. . . .  \n[The NYPD] has ignored the problems of suspicionless stops,\nsearches,  citations,  and  arrests  in  and  around  Clean  Halls\nBuildings. . . .\nThe  NYPD’s  abusive  practices  of  stopping,  questioning,\nsearching, citing, and arresting residents of Clean Halls Buildings\nand their visitors without adequate cause violate the United States\nand New York Constitutions, the Fair Housing Act, and New\nYork common law.4\nThese are grave allegations.  Plaintiffs believe that they are at risk of\nrepeatedly being stopped in the absence of reasonable suspicion and being arrested\nin the absence of probable cause; that is, they are at risk of suffering a violation of\ntheir Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. \nThe Supreme Court has explained that this “inestimable right of  personal security\n4 Complaint ¶¶ 3, 6, 7, 10.\n3\n\nbelongs as much to the citizen on the streets of our cities as to the homeowner\ncloseted in his study to dispose of his secret affairs.”5  The violation of a\nconstitutional right, particularly on an ongoing basis, constitutes irreparable harm\nfor the purpose of a preliminary injunction.6\nTo establish their right to a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs intend to\nrely on the testimony of individuals who claim they have been unlawfully stopped\nand the testimony and findings of Jeffrey Fagan, a criminologist with expertise in\nstatistics.7  According to plaintiffs’ representations, Fagan’s testimony will show\nthat, taking the NYPD’s stop and frisk records at face value, there have been\nhundreds of unlawful stops on suspicion of no crime other than “trespass” made\n5 Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 9 (1968).  Accord Union Pac. Ry.

Miles, 355 Fed. App’x 444, 446 (2d Cir. 2009) (“an\nalleged violation of a constitutional right ‘triggers a finding of irreparable harm’”)\n(quoting Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 482 (2d Cir. 1996)).  See also Hardy v.\nFischer, 701 F. Supp. 2d 614, 619 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (ongoing violations cause\n“quintessential” irreparable harm).\n7 See Floyd v. City of New York, --- F. Supp. 2d ----, 2012 WL 1344514\n(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2012) (evaluating Fagan’s qualifications and methodology in a\nrelated lawsuit under the Federal Rules of Evidence and Daubert v. Merrell Dow\nPharm., 509 U.S. 579 (1993)).\n4\n\ndirectly outside of Operation Clean Halls buildings in the Bronx.8\nIn response to plaintiffs’ allegations, the City makes three arguments: \nFirst, because the allegedly unlawful stops at issue in this case are also the subject\nof the related – and broader – litigation in Floyd v. City of New York,9 and because\nany plaintiffs in this case who were stopped unlawfully are members of the class in\nFloyd, a preliminary injunction hearing in this case would create “a risk of\nadditional inconsistent adjudications when [Floyd] is decided on the merits.”10 \nSecond, plaintiffs’ desired injunction would do nothing more than instruct police\nofficers to follow the law, which the City argues is improper under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 65(d).  Finally, a focus on the Bronx to the exclusion of other\nboroughs “could lead to a vastly different outcome later when the whole City is\nanalyzed.”11  None of these arguments convince me that plaintiffs’ motion for a\npreliminary injunction should be denied without the opportunity to present\nevidence. \nThe City’s primary concern is that “the stops that plaintiffs are\n8 See 8/9/12 Dunn Letter to the Court at 2-3.\n9 No. 08 Civ. 1034 (S.D.N.Y.).\n10 Zuckerman Letter at 2.\n11 Id. at 1.\n5\n\nchallenging are indeed a subset of [the stops] in Floyd,” that a preliminary\ninjunction constitutes “an ‘end-run’ around the Floyd class certification appeal\nwhich remains to be decided,” and that the Court should deny or defer plaintiffs’\napplication because it would “prevent the inordinate amount of resources being\nspent by both sides on this matter from being wasted.”12\nDefendants cite to Gillespie v. Crawford, in which the Fifth Circuit\nprohibited individual prisoner suits regarding conditions of confinement in Texas\nprisons because other prisoners in a class action lawsuit had already obtained a\nfavorable judgment and the district court, with the help of a special master, was\noverseeing compliance with its decrees.13  The court explained that “[t]o allow\nindividual suits would interfere with the orderly administration of the class action\nand risk inconsistent adjudications.”14  Judge John Elfvin of the Western District of\nNew York later relied on Gillespie to support his decision to dismiss the claims of\ninmates at the Attica Correctional Facility who were confined to the special\nhousing unit because he determined that the claims were subsumed by a\n12 8/7/12 Zuckerman Letter to the Court.\n13 858 F.2d 1101 (5th Cir. 1988).\n14 Id. at 1103.  The Fifth Circuit made clear that although they may not\nbring new suits, “prisoners may assert any equitable or declaratory claims they\nhave, but they must do so by urging further action through the class representative\nand attorney, including contempt proceedings, or by intervention in the class\naction.”  Id.\n6\n\npreviously-filed lawsuit in which a class had been certified.15 \nNeither of these opinions is binding upon this Court and both are\ndistinguishable.  Gillespie stands for the proposition that if a district court judge\nand special master are overseeing a complex remedial decree, it does not make\nsense for other courts to simultaneously address similar issues through new\nproceedings.  That situation is different from the present one in at least two\nimportant respects: first, there has been no finding of liability in the Floyd class\naction and there is therefore no decree with which a Ligon injunction could\nconflict.  Second, both matters are assigned to me, which reduces the likelihood of\ninconsistent remedial orders in the future.  If it becomes necessary, I could amend\nany injunction in Ligon as a result of determinations made by the jury in Floyd. \nThe Young decision is not particularly useful to defendants here because the court\ndismissed the claims after a trial on the merits.16  \n15  Young v. Kelly, No. 88 Civ. 511, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 331\n(W.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 1993).\n16 A complex settlement of the related class action was being negotiated\nin the months before and after Judge Elfvin’s January 15, 1993 decision.  See Eng\nv. Coughlin, No. 80 Civ. 385 (W.D.N.Y.).  Docket entries beginning on June 18,\n1992 depict the ongoing negotiations and piecemeal settlement agreement in that\ncase.  Settlement of the class members’ prison library claim, which was the\nprimary claim at issue in Young, was reached on December 21, 1992. \nFurthermore, unlike in these cases, the Attica class action was not before Judge\nElfvin at the time.  Finally, Judge Elfvin did permit the individual plaintiffs to\npresent their case at trial; he dismissed the claims, after hearing the evidence,\nbecause he found that they were “couched entirely in blanket denouncements of the\n7\n\nI understand the City’s concern that preparing for and holding a\npreliminary injunction hearing is costly and time-consuming.  But Floyd was filed\nfour and a half years ago and the trial may be indefinitely postponed as a result of\nthe City’s decision to appeal this Court’s class certification order.  Plaintiffs in\nLigon allege persistent and ongoing violations of their most cherished\nconstitutional rights; they claim that their daily lives are being severely disrupted\nby the NYPD’s unconstitutional harassment.  If their allegations are true, plaintiffs\nshould not be forced to endure years of continued indignity while this litigation is\neffectively stayed pending the outcome in Floyd.  And if the allegations are not\nproven, then the NYPD will be vindicated by a judicial system that permits the\nCity – and all litigants – a full and fair hearing.  \nIf defendants wish to minimize duplication, they may agree to\npreliminary injunctive relief with the plaintiffs in Ligon.  Alternatively, they are\nfree to withdraw their appeal of the class certification decision and permit a trial in\nFloyd without delay.  But the City cannot have it both ways.  Having pursued an\ninterlocutory appeal of the Floyd class certification decision, the City may not now\nprevent other litigants from even requesting that the Court use its equitable power\nadministrative policies without any showing of specific” harm to the individuals. \nYoung, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 331, at *4.  Plaintiffs here claim that they have\nsuffered individual harm.\n8\n\nto protect their fundamental rights.\nThe City’s second concern is that “[t]he injunction that plaintiffs seek\nmerely would have the City follow the law”17 and that such an injunction is\nimproper because under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d)(1), “an injunction\nmust be more specific than a simple command that the defendant obey the law.”18 \nBut the City misapprehends the purpose of Rule 65.  The Second Circuit has\nrecently fully explained this issue: \nRule 65(d) provides that “[e]very order granting an injunction . .\n. must: (A) state the reasons why it issued; (B) state its terms\nspecifically; and (C) describe in reasonable detail – and not by\nreferring to the complaint or other document – the act or acts\nrestrained  or  required.”    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  65(d)(1).    We  have\ninterpreted Rule 65(d) as requiring that “an injunction . . . be\nspecific and definite enough to apprise those within its scope of\nthe conduct that is being proscribed.”  S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc.\nv. Clorox Co., 241 F.3d 232, 240-41 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).  The Supreme Court has explained:\n“[T]he specificity provisions of Rule 65(d) are no mere technical\nrequirements.  The Rule was designed to prevent uncertainty and\nconfusion on the part of those faced with injunctive orders, and to\navoid the possible founding of a contempt citation on a decree too\nvague  to  be  understood.    Since  an  injunctive  order  prohibits\nconduct  under  threat  of  judicial  punishment,  basic  fairness \nrequires that those enjoined receive explicit notice of precisely\nwhat conduct is outlawed.”  Schmidt v. Lessard, 414 U.S. 473,\n476  (1974)  (footnotes  and  citations  omitted).    Rule  65(d)  is\nsatisfied “only if the enjoined party can ascertain from the four\n17 Zuckerman Letter at 2.\n18 S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. v. Clorox Co., 241 F.3d 232, 240 (2d Cir.\n2001).\n9\n\ncorners of the order precisely what acts are forbidden or required.”\nPetrello v. White, 533 F.3d 110, 114 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).19 \nThe purpose of Rule 65(d) is to ensure specificity, not breadth.   The\nRule requires that an injunction state specifically what defendants are and are not\nto do.  In any event, plaintiffs intend to seek changes in supervision, training, and\nmonitoring that will go “far beyond a simple command to obey the law.”20  If the\nevidence produced by plaintiffs warrants relief, the Court will be sure to craft an\ninjunction that gives defendants “explicit notice of precisely what conduct is\noutlawed.”21\nFinally, the City argues that “the decision to focus solely on the Bronx\nmay lead to inconsistent adjudications later.”22  It is indeed possible that plaintiffs\nwill present sufficient evidence to warrant a preliminary injunction in that borough\nand insufficient evidence regarding unconstitutional behavior in other parts of New\nYork City to justify a broader injunction.  Tailoring injunctions narrowly is a\nclassic judicial function: \n19 City of New York v. Mickalis Pawn Shop, LLC, 645 F.3d 114, 143-44\n(2d Cir. 2011). \n20 Dunn Letter at 2.\n21 Schmidt, 414 U.S. at 476.\n22 Zuckerman Letter at 1.\n10\n\nAlthough a  district  court  has  \"a wide  range  of discretion  in \nframing an injunction in terms it deems reasonable to prevent \nwrongful  conduct,\"  it  is  nonetheless  \"the  essence  of equity \njurisdiction\" that a court is only empowered \"to grant relief no \nbroader than necessary to cure the effects of the harm caused by \nthe violation.\"  Forschner Grp., Inc.  v. Arrow Trading Co.,  124 \nF.3d 402,406 (2d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nWe  have instructed that injunctive relief should be \"narrowly \ntailored to fit specific legal violations\" Peregrine Myanmar Ltd. \nv.

The evidence may warrant no injunction, a City-wide injunction, \nor a Bronx-specific injunction. In principle, however, there is nothing improper about \nthe last option. \nFor the reasons stated above, defendants' request to summarily reject \nplaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction is denied. \nDated:  August 21,2012 \nNew York, New York \n23  Mickalis Pawn Shop, 645 F.3d at 144. \n11 \n\n- Appearances -\nFor Plaintiffs:\nAlexis Karteron, Esq.

On August 12, 2013, Judge Shira \nA. Scheindlin, a long-serving and distinguished jurist of the United States District Court for the \nSouthern District of New York, held that the City of New York (“the City”) had violated the \nplaintiffs’ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and ordered the City to engage in a variety \nof remedial measures and activities.  \nOn August 27, 2013, the City moved in the district court to stay those remedies, pending \nan appeal on the merits of the district court’s decision.  Judge Scheindlin denied the motions.  On \nSeptember 23, 2013, the City moved in this Court to stay the imposition of the district court’s \nremedies.  By order dated October 31, 2013, we both granted that stay and, because the \nappearance of impartiality had been compromised by certain statements made by Judge \nScheindlin during proceedings in the district court and in media interviews, we reassigned the \ncases to a different district judge, to be chosen randomly.1  We now explain the basis for that \norder, which is superseded by this opinion.2 \nBACKGROUND \nWe emphasize that the merits of this litigation are not before us and are not at issue here. \nAccordingly, we neither express nor intimate any views on the merits of the underlying actions.  \n                                                           \n1 See Appendix A.   \n2 On November 8, 2013, Judge Scheindlin moved in this court through counsel for “leave in the nature of \nan order under Rule 21(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure governing mandamus proceedings \nproviding for appellate review of motions for judicial disqualification pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455, authorizing \ncounsel to appear on behalf of the District Judge in order to address the factual and legal sufficiency of the Motion \nPanel’s sua sponte order of removal.”  We address this motion by the district judge to appear in support of retaining \nauthority over these cases in a separate opinion published contemporaneously with this one. \n2 \n \n \n\nThis opinion deals only with our procedural decision to direct the reassignment of the cases and \nturns on how the cases came before Judge Scheindlin and the media interviews she gave during \nthe pendency of these lawsuits.  \nFor the sake of clarity, we recite the procedural history that has led us to this point. \nIn January 2008, the plaintiffs in Floyd filed a class action alleging that the NYPD violated the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments through a pattern and practice of stopping and frisking \nwithout reasonable suspicion.  In March 2012, the plaintiffs in Ligon filed a class action alleging \nthat the NYPD violated the Fourth Amendment by engaging in a practice of unlawfully stopping, \nfrisking, and arresting persons for trespass because of their presence in or near buildings enrolled \nby their landlords in an NYPD crime prevention program known as the Trespass Affidavit \nProgram (“TAP”).   \nWhen filing, the plaintiffs in Floyd marked the case on the appropriate form as related to \nDaniels v. City of New York, No. 99-cv-1695, an earlier case over which Judge Scheindlin \npresided.  Likewise, the plaintiffs in Ligon marked that case as related to Davis v. City of New \nYork, No. 10-cv-699, over which Judge Scheindlin was also presiding.3  Because Daniels, \nalthough terminated a month earlier, and Davis had been assigned to Judge Scheindlin, Floyd \nand Ligon were forwarded to her, pursuant to Rule 13 of the Local Rules for the Division of \nBusiness Among District Judges,4 and she accepted them both as related cases.  \n                                                           \n3 Prior to Ligon being filed, Judge Scheindlin had accepted Davis as related to Floyd, so in that sense, \nLigon also descends directly from Daniels via Floyd and Davis. \n4 In relevant part, Rule 13 provides: \n(c) Assignment of cases and proceedings that are designated as related.  \n(i) Disclosure of contention of relatedness.  \n \n \n3 \n \n \n\nIn a decision dated January 8, 2013, and amended on February 14, 2013, Judge \nScheindlin granted the Ligon plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, holding that they \nhad “shown a clear likelihood of proving that defendants have displayed deliberate indifference \ntoward a widespread practice of unconstitutional trespass stops by the NYPD outside TAP \nbuildings in the Bronx.”5  In a separate opinion, Judge Scheindlin granted the defendants’ motion \nto stay any remedies until after the “issuance of a final decision regarding the appropriate scope \nof preliminary injunctive relief, and the appropriate scope of permanent injunctive relief (if any) \nin Floyd.”6     \nOn August 12, 2013, following a nine-week trial in Floyd, Judge Scheindlin held that the \nCity of New York violated the plaintiffs’ rights under the Fourth Amendment and the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.7  The same day, Judge Scheindlin issued an \nopinion setting forth remedial measures in both Floyd and Ligon8 intended to bring the NYPD’s \nuse of stop-and-frisk into compliance with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.9   \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nWhen a civil case is filed or removed or a bankruptcy appeal or motion to \nwithdraw the reference of an adversary proceeding from the bankruptcy court is filed, \nthe person filing or removing shall disclose on form JSC44C any contention of \nrelatedness.  A copy of that form shall be served with the complaint, notice of removal, \nappeal or motion.  \n(ii) Civil cases that are designated as related.  \nA case designated as related shall be forwarded to the judge before whom the \nearlier-filed case is then pending who has the sole discretion to accept or reject the case. \nCases rejected by the judge as not related shall be assigned by random selection. \n5 Ligon et al. v.

Aug. 12, 2013).   \n9 Id. at *13.   \n4 \n \n \n\nOn August 16, 2013, the defendants in both cases filed notices of appeal in this court.  On \nAugust 27, 2013, the City of New York moved in the district court to stay the remedies in Floyd \nand Ligon, pending the outcome of the appeals process.  On September 17, 2013, Judge \nScheindlin denied the City’s stay motions.  On September 23, 2013, the City moved in this court \nto stay the district court’s August 12, 2013 remedies order.   \nFollowing oral argument, this panel, on October 31, 2013, stayed, “the District Court’s \nJanuary 8, 2013 ‘Opinion and Order,’ as well as the August 12, 2013 ‘Liability Opinion’ and \n‘Remedies Opinion,’ each of which may or will have the effect of causing actions to be taken by \ndefendants or designees of the District Court, or causing restraints against actions that otherwise \nwould be taken by defendants.”  This panel also concluded “that, in the interest, and appearance, \nof fair and impartial administration of justice, UPON REMAND, these cases shall be assigned to \na different District Judge, chosen randomly under the established practices of the District Court \nfor the Southern District of New York.  This newly-designated District Judge shall implement \nthis Court’s mandate staying all proceedings and otherwise await further action by the Court of \nAppeals on the merits of the ongoing appeals.”10  We now explain in greater detail the basis for \nour decision to reassign the cases. \nDISCUSSION \nTitle 28, United States Code, section 455(a) provides that “[a]ny justice, judge, or \nmagistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his \nimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.”  This statute embodies the principle that “to \nperform its high function in the best way justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.”11   \n                                                           \n10 See Appendix A, at 3.   \n11 In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n5 \n \n \n\nThe goal of section 455(a) is to avoid not only partiality but also the appearance of \npartiality.12  The section does so by establishing an “objective standard ‘designed to promote \npublic confidence in the impartiality of the judicial process.’”13  The rule functions as a critical \ninternal check to ensure the just operation of the judiciary.  Our Court, sitting en banc, has stated \nthat there exists “unusual circumstances where both for the judge’s sake and the appearance of \njustice, an assignment to a different judge is salutary and in the public interest, especially as it \nminimizes even a suspicion of partiality.”14  And as other circuits have correctly noted, “‘if the \nquestion of whether § 455(a) requires disqualification is a close one, the balance tips in favor of \nrecusal.’”15 \nWe emphasize at the outset that we make no findings of misconduct, actual bias, or actual \npartiality on the part of Judge Scheindlin.  Following our review of the record, however, we \nconclude that her conduct while on the bench, which appears to have resulted in these lawsuits \nbeing filed and directed to her, in conjunction with her statements to the media and the resulting \nstories published while a decision on the merits was pending and while public interest in the \noutcome of the litigation was high, might cause a reasonable observer to question her \nimpartiality.  For this reason, her disqualification is required by section 455(a). \n                                                           \n12 See Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 860 (1988). \n13 SEC v. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. (In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.), 861 F.2d 1307, 1313 (2d \nCir. 1988) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 1453, reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6351, 6354-55).   \n14 United States v. Robin, 553 F.2d 8, 9-10 (2d Cir. 1977) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted). \n15 In re Boston’s Children First, 244 F.3d 164, 167 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Nichols v. Alley, 71 F.3d 347, \n352 (10th Cir. 1995)); see also United States v. Dandy, 998 F.2d 1344, 1349 (6th Cir. 1993).   \n6 \n \n \n\nA. \nThe appearance of partiality stems in the first instance from comments made by Judge \nScheindlin that a reasonable observer could interpret as intimating her views on the merits of a \ncase that had yet to be filed, and as seeking to have that case filed and to preside over it after it \nwas filed.  These comments were made in the earlier case of Daniels v. City of New York, No. \n99-cv-1695, in which the City entered into a settlement agreement requiring it, inter alia, to \nestablish policies that prohibited racial profiling.  Ten days before Judge Scheindlin’s \nsupervisory authority under the settlement agreement was set to expire, she heard argument on a \nmotion brought by the Daniels plaintiffs to extend the settlement period.16  The transcript of the \nhearing indicates that the City had substantially complied with the relief required by the \nsettlement and that the plaintiffs were seeking information from the City beyond that required to \nbe furnished by the settlement agreement. \nObserving that the settlement agreement did not entitle the plaintiffs to the relief they \nsought, Judge Scheindlin counseled: \nTHE COURT: [. . .] why don’t you file a lawsuit \n \nMr. COSTELLO: We did, we are here. \n \nTHE COURT: No, you are struggling with the December 31, 2007 deadline in a \n1999 case.  And if you got proof of inappropriate racial profiling in a good \nconstitutional case, why don’t you bring a lawsuit?  You can certainly mark it as \nrelated.   \n \nHow could it not be related to this whole long seven or eight years we have lived \ntogether in this case?  Because you are trying to put a square peg in a round hole.  \nAnd trying to force yourselves to argue what the settlement means, that it doesn’t \nmean if you have a timely lawsuit -- you seem to have compiled interesting \narguments[.]  Ms. Grossman [attorney for the City] has not rebutted -- maybe she \ndid, that’s why we didn’t do something, because we didn’t want them to write this \n                                                           \n16 See Appendix B (transcript of hearing).   \n7 \n \n \n\nletter, she -- let’s just say she hasn’t substantially responded to your letter.  If one \nhad only your letter, it would look like you have a lawsuit.  So instead of \nstruggling to telling [sic] me about a stipulation of settlement, why don’t you craft \na lawsuit?  \n \n(TR 10-11) (emphasis added).  She returned to the idea of bringing a suit alleging that the City \nhad violated their racial profiling policies and suggested a basis for the suit: \nTHE COURT: what I am trying to say - - I am sure I am going to get in trouble \nfor saying it, for $65 you can bring that lawsuit.  You can simply - -  \nMR. MOORE: $350 \nTHE COURT: I knew I had it wrong.  The [C]ity violates its own written policy, \nthe City has a policy that violates -- they have violated their policy, here is the \nproof of it, please give us the remedy.  Injunction or damages, or whatever \nlawyers ask for in compliance.  So for $350 you can bring that lawsuit and it is \ntimely.   \n \n(TR 14, 15) (emphasis added).  And again: \nTHE COURT: I don’t understand why we have to potentially have, you know, \nmonths of briefing when it does fit under this stipulation or it doesn’t, that Raffo \napplies or it doesn’t that the court has the power to extend the supervision, that we \nwant our immediate appeal to the circuit.  Why do you need that if you have a \nlawsuit? Bring it.  They have a written policy, right? \nMR. GROSSMAN: Yes, your Honor. \nTHE COURT: If you think they are violating their written policy, sue them.  \n \n(TR 15) (emphasis added).   \n \nJudge Scheindlin then advised the plaintiffs that if they filed such a suit, they would \nsuccessfully obtain relevant documents produced by the government: \nTHE COURT: . . . There is enough in the public record to craft the suit.   \n \nAnd then in that suit simply say, we want produced all that was produced in the \n1999 lawsuit.  I don't know how you could lose getting it.  It may be a question of \nwhether it is still going to be under protective order or not.  But I can hardly \nimagine not getting it.  You know what I am saying?  It is so obvious to me that \nany Judge would require them to reproduce it to you in the same format that you \nhave it, that you will have it again.  Whether or not it remains confidential.  \n \n8 \n \n \n\n(TR 18) (emphasis added).  After the plaintiffs indicated their willingness to bring the new suit, \nshe repeated her earlier suggestion that the cases were related and indicated her willingness to \nkeep the newly filed case: \n \nMR. MOORE: To the extent that some of the materials have already been made \npublic. \nTHE COURT: what’s public is public, -- If you cite to the Rand study, publicly, \nnobody can criticize you for that.  If they do, they weren’t acting in good faith.  If \nI can get the Rand study on the internet, it is public --  \nMR. MOORE: you can go to the NYPD website, your Honor.   \nTHE COURT: There you go, that’s public.  You can use that.  And as I said \nbefore, I would accept it as a related case, which the plaintiff has the power to \ndesignate.   \nI think this current motion is withdrawn.  Thank you.   \n \n(TR 42) (emphasis added).   \nWe believe that a reasonable observer viewing this colloquy would conclude that the \nappearance of impartiality had been compromised. We do not mean to suggest that a district \njudge can never engage in a colloquy with a party during which the judge advises the party of its \nlegal or procedural options.  However, we think, particularly in combination with the public \nstatements described below, that a reasonable observer could question the impartiality of the \njudge where the judge described a certain claim that differed from the one at issue in the case \nbefore her, urged a party to file a new lawsuit to assert the claim, suggested that such a claim \ncould be viable and would likely entitle the plaintiffs to documents they sought, and advised the \nparty to designate it as a related case so that the case would be assigned to her.17   \n                                                           \n17 The designation by parties, and acceptance by district judges, of cases as related to other pending matters \npursuant to Rule 13 of the Local Rules for the Division of Business Among District Judges, is a routine practice that \npromotes judicial efficiency and economy.  Our decision in this opinion should not be construed as casting doubt on \nthe proper designation and acceptance of cases as “related” in the normal course—that is, when a district judge does \nnot invite the filing of a suit and encourage its direction to their Court.  We also note that, for civil matters, the Rule \nexplicitly anticipates cases being marked as related to “earlier-filed case[s] . . . then pending,” see Rule 13(c), which \nis “designed to reduce litigants’ costs by informally consolidating proceedings in related cases,” Chase Manhattan \n \n9 \n \n \n\nB. \nThis appearance of partiality by Judge Scheindlin at the Daniels hearing was exacerbated \nas a result of interviews she gave to the news media during the course of the Floyd litigation.  \nCases involving public comment by a presiding judge, other than statements in open court, are \ninfrequent.  As the First Circuit has remarked, “[j]udges are generally loath to discuss pending \nproceedings with the media.”18  Of course, not every media comment made by a judge is \nnecessarily grounds for recusal.19  We note that Judge Scheindlin did not specifically mention the \nFloyd or Ligon cases in her media interviews.  However, a judge’s statements to the media may \nnevertheless undermine the judge’s appearance of impartiality with respect to a pending \nproceeding, even if the judge refrains from specifically identifying that proceeding in his remarks \nto the media.  Because context is always critical, the relevant question at all times remains \nwhether, under the circumstances taken as a whole, a judge’s impartiality may reasonably be \ncalled into question.20  Because there is no scienter requirement in section 455,21 the test is not \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nBank, N.A. v. Celotex Corp., 56 F.3d 343, 347 (2d Cir. 1995).  Here, at the time Floyd was filed in January 2008, \nDaniels, to which it was accepted as “related,” was closed.  \nJudge Scheindlin’s motion, the subject of the separate opinion we file today, contends that the “District \nCourt’s recognition that judicial economy would be served by the invocation of the related case doctrine codified in \nLocal Rule 13 is analogous to the decision of the Motion Panel to issue an order retaining jurisdiction over the \nappeal herein in the name of judicial economy.”  To be sure, both Local Rule 13 dealing with related cases in the \ndistrict court, and the practice in this court by which a motion panel may choose to hear the appeal on the merits, are \ndesigned to conserve judicial resources.  However, in the court of appeals, because the case is the same case and not \njust a related case, and no litigant is involved with the decision, there can be no forum-shopping.   \nIn any event, the gravamen of why reassignment of this case is necessary is not simply the use of Local \nRule 13.  It is the appearance of partiality that was created by Judge Scheindlin’s conduct throughout the December \n21, 2007 hearing in suggesting that the plaintiffs bring a lawsuit, outlining the basis for the suit, intimating her view \nof its merit, stating how she would rule on the plaintiffs’ document request in that suit, and telling the plaintiffs that \nshe would take it as a related case, as well as the media interviews she gave during the Floyd proceedings. \n18 In re Boston’s Children First, 244 F.3d at 169.   \n19 See, e.g., United States v. Fortier, 242 F.3d 1224, 1229-30 (10th Cir. 2001) (superseded by statute on \nother grounds); In re Barry, 946 F.2d 913, 914 (D.C. Cir. 1991). \n20 See United States v. Amico, 486 F.3d 764, 775 (2d Cir. 2007).   \n10 \n \n \n\nhow a judge intended his remarks to be understood, but whether, as a result of the interviews or \nother extra-judicial statements, the appearance of impartiality might reasonably be questioned.   \nIn late May 2013, at the conclusion of the evidence in Floyd, when public interest from \nreporting on that trial was high, and months before she had produced a decision, Judge \nScheindlin made herself available for interviews by the Associated Press, The New Yorker, and \nthe New York Law Journal.22  The “lede” of the AP article dated May 18, 2013, read “[t]he \nfederal judge presiding over civil rights challenges to the stop-and-frisk practices of the New \nYork Police Department has no doubt where she stands with the government.  ‘I know I’m not \ntheir favorite judge,’ U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin said during an Associated Press \ninterview Friday.”  The lengthy profile of Judge Scheindlin in The New Yorker, for which she \nagreed to be interviewed, was titled, “Rights and Wrongs: A Judge Takes on Stop-and-Frisk.”  \nThe writer, implying that Judge Scheindlin was aligned with the plaintiffs, wrote,  \n[t]he primary outlet for Scheindlin’s judicial creativity has been an enduring battle \nshe has fought with the N.Y.P.D.  A federal judge since 1994, she has been \nhearing lawsuits against the police for more than a decade.  In decision after \ndecision, she has found that cops have lied, discriminated against people of color, \nand violated the rights of citizens.  Now, in the midst of a mayoral race, with the \nDemocratic candidates united in their opposition to the stop-and-frisk policies of \nthe Bloomberg administration, the Floyd case represents Scheindlin’s greatest \nchance yet to rewrite the rules of engagement between the city’s police and its \npeople. \n \nWhile nothing prohibits a judge from giving an interview to the media, and while one \nwho gives an interview cannot predict with certainty what the writer will say, judges who \naffiliate themselves with news stories by participating in interviews run the risk that the resulting \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n21 See Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 859. \n22 Jeffrey Toobin, Rights and Wrongs: A Judge Takes on Stop-and-Frisk, The New Yorker, May 27, 2013 \n(attached hereto as Appendix C); Larry Neumeister, NY “Frisk” Judge Calles Criticism “Below-the-Belt”, The \nAssociated Press, May 19, 2013 (attached hereto as Appendix D); Mark Hamblett, Stop-and-Frisk Judge Relishes \nher Independence, N.Y. Law Journal, May 20, 2013 (attached hereto as Appendix E).   \n11 \n \n \n\nstories may contribute to the appearance of partiality.  It is perhaps illustrative of how such \nsituations can get out of the control of the judge that, later in The New Yorker piece, the article \nquotes a former law clerk of Judge Scheindlin:  “As one of her former law clerks put it, ‘What \nyou have to remember about the judge is that she thinks cops lie.’” \nFurther, in those two articles, as well as the New York Law Journal article, Judge \nScheindlin describes herself as a jurist who is skeptical of law enforcement, in contrast to certain \nof her colleagues, whom she characterizes as inclined to favor the government.  Given the \nheightened and sensitive public scrutiny of these cases, interviews in which the presiding judge \ndraws such distinctions between herself and her colleagues might lead a reasonable observer to \nquestion the judge’s impartiality.  As the First Circuit put it, “the very rarity of such public \nstatements, and the ease with which they may be avoided, make it more likely that a reasonable \nperson will interpret such statements as evidence of bias.”23   \nC. \nIn our previous order, we referenced the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. We \nnow clarify that we did not intend to imply in our previous order that Judge Scheindlin engaged \nin misconduct cognizable either under the Code of Conduct or under the Judicial Conduct and \nDisability Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 372, et seq.  No such finding is required under section 455,24 and we \ndo not find that there was any judicial misconduct or violation of any ethical duty. \n“To reassign a case on remand, we need only find that the facts might reasonably cause \nan objective observer to question the judge’s impartiality, or absent proof of personal bias \n                                                           \n23  In re Boston’s Children First, 244 F.3d at 170; see also United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, \n115 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (“Judges who covet publicity, or convey the appearance that they do, lead any objective \nobserver to wonder whether their judgments are being influenced by the prospect of favorable coverage in the \nmedia.”). \n24 See In re Boston’s Children First, 244 F.3d at 168. \n12 \n \n \n\nrequiring recusation [sic], that reassignment is advisable to preserve the appearance of justice.”25  \nEven where there is reason to believe that a district judge would fairly conduct further \nproceedings on remand, “in determining whether to reassign a case we consider not only whether \na judge could be expected to have difficulty putting aside his previously expressed views, but \nalso whether reassignment is advisable to preserve the appearance of justice.”26  Such a decision \n“does not imply any personal criticism of the trial judge,”27 and none is intended here.  Indeed, \nfor example, in United States v. Quattrone, we ordered reassignment because “portions of the \ntranscript raise[d] the concern that certain comments could be viewed as rising beyond mere \nimpatience or annoyance” even though there was no “evidence that the trial judge made any \ninappropriate statements leading us to seriously doubt his impartiality.”28   \nReassigning a case to a different district judge, while not an everyday occurrence, is not \nunusual in this Circuit.29  Nor is reassigning a case to a different district judge an unusual \noccurrence in our sister Circuits.30  Indeed, as noted in our accompanying opinion, reassignment \n                                                           \n25 United States v.

Padilla, 186 F.3d 136, \n143 (2d Cir. 1999) (“In view of the district judge’s statements, particularly regarding Padilla’s counsel, the \nappearance of justice would best be preserved by reassignment.”).  Additionally, it bears noting that in none of these \ncases was the affected district judge afforded “an opportunity to be heard” prior to the disqualification action of the \nCourt of Appeals, much less did the affected district judge ever seek to participate in the appellate proceedings \ninvolving the district judge’s decisions.  \n30 See, e.g., United States v. Clawson, 650 F.3d 530, 539 (4th Cir. 2011); John v. Goetz, 626 F.3d 356, 363-\n65 (6th Cir. 2010); In re United States, 614 F.3d 661, 666 (7th Cir. 2010) (“No reasonable person would fail to \nperceive a significant risk that the judge’s rulings in the case might be influenced by his unreasonable fury toward \n \n13 \n \n \n\nis simply a mechanism that allows the courts to ensure that cases are decided by judges without \neven an appearance of partiality. \nAlthough the possible recusal of Judge Scheindlin was not raised either by the parties or \nthe judge herself in the district court or this court, there is no barrier to our reassigning the cases \nnostra sponte.  Indeed, in numerous cases in recent years, we have found it appropriate to \nreassign a case without the issue having been raised or briefed by the parties or considered by the \ndistrict judge.31  To be sure, in the usual case, “a federal appellate court does not consider an \nissue not passed upon below.”32  But as Justice Black, writing for the unanimous Supreme Court, \nrecognized more than seventy years ago, “[t]here may always be exceptional cases or particular \ncircumstances which will prompt a reviewing or appellate court, where injustice might otherwise \nresult, to consider questions of law which were neither pressed nor passed upon by the court . . . \nbelow.”33  More recently, Justice Souter, writing for the Court, reaffirmed that when an appellate \ncourt may consider a legal issue not raised below is a “matter ‘left primarily to the discretion of \nthe courts of appeals, to be exercised on the facts of individual cases,’”34 and we recently \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nthe prosecutors.”); Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d at 107-117; In re Boston’s Children First, 244 F.3d at 164; United \nStates v. Tucker, 78 F.3d 1313, 1324 (8th Cir. 1996) (stating that courts of appeals in the first instance are \nempowered to reassign cases where, under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a), the district judge’s “impartiality might reasonable be \nquestioned”); United States v.

Awadallah, 436 F.3d 125, 135 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that in some reassignment cases, the \nreassignment has been “initiated sua sponte by the court on the defendants behalf”). \n32 Singleton v.

To \nreiterate, we have made no findings that Judge Scheindlin has engaged in judicial misconduct.  \nWe conclude only that, based on her conduct at the December 21, 2007 hearing and in giving the \ninterviews to the news media in May 2013, Judge Scheindlin’s appearance of impartiality may \nreasonably be questioned within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 455 and that “reassignment is \nadvisable to preserve the appearance of justice.”36   \n                                                           \n35 See United States v.

Local Rule 13(a),1 and by a series of media \n                                                           \n1 In a proceeding on December 21, 2007 involving the parties in Daniels v. City of New York, No. 99 Civ. \n1695 (S.D.N.Y. filed Mar. 8, 1999), the District Judge stated, “[I]f you got proof of inappropriate racial profiling in \na good constitutional case, why don’t you bring a lawsuit? You can certainly mark it as related.” She also stated, \n“[W]hat I am trying to say, I am sure I am going to get in trouble for saying it, for $65 you can bring that lawsuit.” \nShe concluded the proceeding by noting, “And as I said before, I would accept it as a related case, which the \nplaintiff has the power to designate.” Two of the attorney groups working on behalf of plaintiffs in Daniels, a case \n2 \n \n \n\ninterviews and public statements purporting to respond publicly to criticism of the District \nCourt.2   \n \nAccordingly, we conclude that, in the interest, and appearance, of fair and impartial \nadministration of justice, UPON REMAND, these cases shall be assigned to a different District \nJudge, chosen randomly under the established practices of the District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York. This newly-designated District Judge shall implement this Court’s \nmandate staying all proceedings and otherwise await further action by the Court of Appeals on \nthe merits of the ongoing appeals. \n   \nIn taking these actions, we intimate no view on the substance or merits of the pending \nappeals, which have yet to be fully briefed and argued. \n \nThe mandate shall ISSUE FORTHWITH for the sole purpose of implementation of this \nOrder and shall otherwise remain in this Court.  \n     \nIn the interest of judicial economy, any question, application, or further appeal regarding \nthe scope of this Order or its implementation shall be directed to this panel, which will hear the \ncase on the merits in due course.   \n   \n \n            FOR THE COURT: \n            Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk       \n \n  \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nchallenging the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practices, helped file Floyd the next month.

Photograph by Antonio Bolfo.\n“I\ndon’t love trials,” Judge Shira Scheindlin said\nrecently. “They are not a good way to tell a story. They are not efficient. And they are often\nso tedious—you saw that today.” Scheindlin was sitting at a conference table in her chambers in the\nwww.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin?printable=true&currentPage=all 1/13\n\n11/11/13 Jeffrey Toobin: A Judge Takes On Stop-and-Frisk : The New Yorker\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan building, off Foley Square, in lower Manhattan, after a long day of\npresiding in Floyd v. City of New York, which is the latest legal challenge to the stop-and-frisk\npractices of the New York Police Department. “What I really like to do is write opinions,” the\nJudge said. “There you get to do what you think is right, what you believe in. You’re pushing the\nmargins of the envelope, being willing to be creative.”\nIt was after seven o’clock in the evening, and the courthouse was nearly empty. At sixty-six,\nScheindlin is renowned for her work ethic and her demands on her staff. Her clerks work from 9\nA.M. until 8 P.M. every weekday. They can get lunch at the courthouse cafeteria but must eat it in\nchambers. They are also expected to work six hours over the weekend. (They can choose which\nday.)\nIn her office, Scheindlin was relaxed and expansive, especially when she talked about her two\nchildren, a son who is a violist with the Metropolitan Opera orchestra and a daughter who is a\npolitical consultant and pollster in Israel. (Her husband, Dr. Stanley Friedman, is an associate dean\nat SUNY-Downstate Medical Center.) On the bench, though, she is unflaggingly rigorous. She listens\nto testimony, reads the transcript on her computer in real time, e-mails her clerks, and sips endless\ncups of Diet Coke. Lawyers who appear before her often describe her as opinionated and brusque.\n(“I’ve heard enough.” “Move along.” “I’ve ruled, counsel.”)\nThe primary outlet for Scheindlin’s judicial creativity has been an enduring battle she has fought\nwith the N.Y.P.D. A federal judge since 1994, she has been hearing lawsuits against the police for\nmore than a decade. In decision after decision, she has found that cops have lied, discriminated\nagainst people of color, and violated the rights of citizens. Now, in the midst of a mayoral race, with\nthe Democratic candidates united in their opposition to the stop-and-frisk policies of the\nBloomberg administration, the Floyd case represents Scheindlin’s greatest chance yet to rewrite\nthe rules of engagement between the city’s police and its people. David Floyd, the lead plaintiff, is\nan African-American medical student who had been stopped and searched twice. The core allegation\nin the case is that the N.Y.P.D. is systematically violating the rights of its citizens with unlawful\nstop-and-frisks, particularly by targeting minorities. The questions before Scheindlin are profound.\nCrime has declined in New York in recent years, as it has in other cities around the country. But\nwhy? And at what cost to the civil liberties of its people? Has New York City conducted a long-\nterm, racially motivated campaign to deprive thousands of its citizens of their constitutional rights?\nOr, as Mayor Bloomberg and others maintain, has the city created one of the great law-enforcement\nsuccess stories in recent American history?\nT\nhe concept behind stop-and-frisk, which is sometimes also called “stop, question, and frisk,” is\na simple and venerable one. Police officers may arrest a suspect only if they have probable\ncause to believe that he committed a crime. What can they do if they suspect that someone is\ninvolved in criminal activity but lack sufficient grounds to make an arrest? The Supreme Court\nwww.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin?printable=true&currentPage=all 2/13\n\n11/11/13 Jeffrey Toobin: A Judge Takes On Stop-and-Frisk : The New Yorker\naddressed the subject in Terry v. Ohio, in 1968. According to Chief Justice Earl Warren’s opinion,\na stop is permissible only when “a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him\nreasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot.” In other\nwords, the level of certainty needed for an officer to make such a stop is less than probable cause;\nthe standard is often described as “reasonable suspicion.” According to the Terry decision, the\njudgment by the officer must be made on the basis of “specific reasonable inferences” from the\nevidence, not “inarticulate hunches.” By and large, this remains the law today. Stop-and-frisk\nencounters are also known as “Terry stops.”\n“Stop, question, and frisk has been around forever,” William Bratton, a former police\ncommissioner in Boston, New York, and Los Angeles, told me. “It’s a basic tool. It’s the most\nfundamental practice in American policing. It is done every day, probably by every city force in\nAmerica. If the police are not doing it, they are probably not doing their job.” Bratton served as\nMayor Rudolph Giuliani’s first commissioner of the N.Y.P.D., from 1994 to 1996, and is widely\ncredited with changing the orientation of the police from responding to crime to preventing it.\nThrough much of the second half of the twentieth century, crime and disorder, in forms ranging\nfrom graffiti to murder to a crack epidemic, plagued New York. The police appeared powerless to\naddress these scourges. “Around 1960, New York City basically stopped policing,” Bratton told me.\n“The police were no longer engaged in controlling behavior in the streets. We changed that. If\npeople are drinking cans of beer on the corner, you stop that behavior. If somebody is urinating\nagainst a building, or if you suspect somebody is casing a building for a burglary, you stop them. Of\ncourse police should be doing that. You make the streets safe, and, besides, a lot of these people\ncommitting these minor crimes turn out to have warrants out against them for more serious things.”\nThe approach is known as Broken Windows, after a 1982 article in the Atlantic by James Q. Wilson\nand George L. Kelling. Bratton’s interpretation of the Broken Windows approach called for\nvigorous police enforcement of minor crimes like fare-beating and intrusive panhandling as a tool\nto preserve public order and, at the same time, to catch criminals. In addition, the N.Y.P.D. under\nBratton began to make extensive use of data to identify crime-prone areas and focus resources on\nthem—an approach sometimes called “hot-spot policing.” Along the way, especially in high-crime\nneighborhoods, cops stopped people not just in the act of committing minor crimes but also for\nsuspicious behavior.\nStop-and-frisk—indeed, aggressive policing generally—presents significant challenges for\njudges. Months, or even years, after a confrontation between a cop and a suspect, the judge must\ndetermine if the stop was legal and thus whether the evidence gathered can be used in court or\nshould be suppressed. “Most judges are reluctant to grant suppression motions,” Erin Murphy, a\nprofessor at the New York University School of Law, said. “It’s hard for judges to look a police\nofficer in the eye and say he didn’t follow the law. And of course it’s only defendants who look\nwww.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin?printable=true&currentPage=all 3/13\n\n11/11/13 Jeffrey Toobin: A Judge Takes On Stop-and-Frisk : The New Yorker\nguilty who file suppression motions. It’s every judge’s worst nightmare that a released defendant\nwill show up in the newspaper the next day for committing some horrible crime. If you suppress\nevidence, you are making it hard or impossible to prosecute a guilty person. That’s a really difficult\nemotional and political decision for a judge to make.”\nThe matter of Antonio Fernandez presented such a dilemma for Judge Scheindlin. On May 12,\n1995, police received a 911 call reporting a gang meeting in progress at a small park in the Bronx.\nThe caller said that one member, a Hispanic man wearing a white-and-black jacket, had a gun. The\nofficers who responded found about fifty or sixty men, all Hispanic, milling around. The police\nfrisked one man, who had no contraband. Then they followed a group of three or four men who had\nbeen standing to the side of the main group. One of them was Fernandez, who was stopped, frisked,\nand found to have a small amount of marijuana. At the station house, he was frisked again, and\npolice said that he had a fully loaded .38-calibre revolver hidden in his crotch.\nFernandez was charged with illegal possession of a handgun, and the case was assigned to\nScheindlin, who was in her early days on the federal bench. Fernandez argued that the Terry stop was\nillegal, and that the gun should be suppressed as illegally obtained evidence. Scheindlin agreed,\nwriting in an opinion that, “based on the facts presented here, the police did not have reasonable\nsuspicion to stop Defendant and his companions.” In part, Scheindlin said, the stop-and-frisk was\nillegitimate, because the anonymous tip was too vague to lead to Fernandez, but her opinion\nreflected a disbelief in the officers’ testimony. According to the officers, Fernandez’s first frisk\nproduced a small amount of marijuana, but the second yielded a large handgun. As Scheindlin wrote,\n“It is extremely difficult to believe that the same officer could have missed a bulky .38 caliber\nrevolver hidden in Defendant’s pants.”\nThe case might have passed without notice, but Antonio Fernandez was not an ordinary\ndefendant. He was better known as King Tone, the leader of the Latin Kings, one of the most\nnotorious drug gangs in the United States, and he was being charged as part of a huge crackdown on\nthe group by the United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York. “Scheindlin\nis one of the very few judges who would have had the guts to toss out a case like that one,” a former\nprosecutor familiar with the case said. (Three years later, Fernandez was prosecuted for heroin and\ncocaine trafficking and sentenced, by a different judge, to twelve years.) Scheindlin’s ruling in the\nFernandez case set a template for her handling of criminal cases. As one of her former law clerks\nput it, “What you have to remember about the Judge is that she thinks cops lie.”\nAccording to a study prepared by the Mayor’s office, Scheindlin suppresses evidence on the\nbasis of illegal police searches far more than any of her colleagues—twice as often as the second-\nplace judge. This may mean that Scheindlin is uniquely courageous—or that she is uniquely biased\nagainst cops. (Scheindlin has said that the study is misleading, because it reflects only her written\nopinions, rather than bench rulings, in which she almost invariably rejects motions to suppress.)\nwww.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin?printable=true&currentPage=all 4/13\n\n11/11/13 Jeffrey Toobin: A Judge Takes On Stop-and-Frisk : The New Yorker\nStill, she embraces her maverick status. Many judges in the Southern District previously worked as\nprosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s office there, but she was not among them. “Too many judges,\nespecially because so many of our judges come out of that office, become government judges,”\nScheindlin told me. “I don’t think I’m the favorite of the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern\nDistrict. Because I’m independent. I believe in the Constitution. I believe in the Bill of Rights.\nThese issues come up, and I take them quite seriously. I’m not afraid to rule against the\ngovernment.”\nS\ncheindlin grew up in Detroit. Her mother was a schoolteacher, and her father, who emigrated\nfrom the Soviet Union, ran a Jewish civic organization. “We were a political family,” she told\nme. “My father was the official Jew for many committees in the state.” For a time, the family lived\nin a house once owned by a brother of Walter Reuther, the United Auto Workers labor leader. “The\nhouse had a bullet hole, from where someone had taken a shot at him,” she said. “It was a tough\ntown.”\nAt the University of Michigan, Scheindlin majored in Chinese history, then continued her\nstudies for seven years at Columbia. She never received her doctorate. “The language defeated me,”\nshe said. “The prospect of reading original documents in Chinese was just too difficult.” Scheindlin\ndrifted into law school, graduating from Cornell in 1975. She spent her final year of law school at\nColumbia, where she took a class with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who became a mentor. Ginsburg\nintroduced her to the legal side of the women’s-rights movement, and, while still a student,\nScheindlin played a role in a case that brought equal pay to female academics at the City University\nof New York.\nFor the next two decades, Scheindlin did a little bit of everything in the law. She was in private\npractice, a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, general counsel to the New York City Department of\nInvestigation, and a magistrate (a lower-level federal judge), also in Brooklyn. In 1994, at the\nrecommendation of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who had been encouraged by Ginsburg,\nPresident Clinton nominated Scheindlin to the federal bench in Manhattan. Her professional roots\nin Brooklyn, which is known as the Eastern District of New York, separated her from the start from\nthe clubby world of the Southern District.\nA defining event of Scheindlin’s tenure as a federal judge took place on February 4, 1999. On\nthat day, four plainclothes officers shot and killed Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant,\nwho was in the vestibule of his apartment building, in the Soundview section of the Bronx. (The\nofficers, who thought Diallo was reaching for a gun, were charged with manslaughter. They were\nacquitted by a jury in Albany, where the case had been moved because of pretrial publicity in the\nBronx.) The Diallo case suggested a dark side of Giuliani-era policing. The same aggressiveness\nthat led New York cops to arrest minor offenders could turn, in certain circumstances, into a\npredatory approach to non-offenders, especially racial minorities. Crime rates (for whatever\nwww.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin?printable=true&currentPage=all 5/13\n\n11/11/13 Jeffrey Toobin: A Judge Takes On Stop-and-Frisk : The New Yorker\nreason) had fallen dramatically during the Giuliani administration, but the Diallo case raised\nconcerns about the N.Y.P.D.’s new tactics. “The idea behind proactive policing was to get guns off\nthe street, which was fine as far as it went, but what it meant on the street was the cops tossed every\nyoung black man that they saw,” Jonathan Moore, a veteran civil-rights lawyer, said. “That’s what led\nto Diallo.”\nIn response to Diallo’s death, Moore and the Center for Constitutional Rights, a legal-advocacy\ngroup, filed the first class-action lawsuit challenging the city’s stop-and-frisk policies. The case,\nDaniels v. City of New York (Kelvin Daniels was the lead plaintiff), was randomly assigned to\nJudge Scheindlin, and years of legal skirmishing followed. The parties settled in 2004. The city\nagreed to establish a written policy governing its stop-and-frisk practices and to improve the\ntraining of officers in conducting legal Terry stops.\nIn retrospect, though, the most important part of the Daniels settlement may have involved\nrecord-keeping. The city agreed to create a kind of checklist, which police officers would complete\neach time they conducted a stop-and-frisk. During the next decade, the police filled out more than\nfour million of these forms, which served as indispensable evidence for the Center for\nConstitutional Rights and others in lawsuits against the city.\nS\ncheindlin has a bright and airy courtroom, one floor below her chambers, and the Floyd trial,\nnow in its third month, has settled into a routine. In jury trials, judges avoid signalling their\nviews, so as not to influence the jurors; but in bench trials there’s less reason for judges to be\nreticent. By this point, Judge Scheindlin’s views seem etched on the faces of the lawyers before\nher. Moore and his colleagues bound in and greet the Judge with confident half-smiles; the team\nfrom the city’s law department already look like disaster survivors, just trying to hang on. Moore\nand his team linger after court, chatting with spectators; the city’s lawyers, led by Brenda Cooke,\nscurry for the door, avoiding eye contact. (Closing statements are expected this week; Scheindlin\nwill probably render her decision within sixty days.)\nThe plaintiffs’ key witness was Jeffrey Fagan, a criminologist and statistician, and a professor\nof law at Columbia, who has spent much of the past decade scrutinizing the city’s vast database of\nstop-and-frisk reports. The stop-and-frisk form, known as the UF-250, contains boxes for police\nofficers to check to explain why a suspect was stopped. Some of the boxes refer to specific\nbehavior: a suspicious bulge in clothing, or a refusal to comply with an officer’s directions. More\nthan half of the four million UF-250 forms included checks in the box labelled “Furtive\nmovements.” In his report, Fagan concluded that the furtive-movement box, without more evidence,\nsuggested an unconstitutional Terry stop—that is, one not supported by reasonable suspicion of a\ncrime. According to an algorithm that Fagan devised, eighty-two per cent of the stops were\njustifiable, twelve per cent were ambiguous, and six per cent appeared to be unjustified. Projecting\nthat ratio over a decade, Fagan concluded that the N.Y.P.D. had made more than two hundred and\nwww.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin?printable=true&currentPage=all 6/13\n\n11/11/13 Jeffrey Toobin: A Judge Takes On Stop-and-Frisk : The New Yorker\nsixty thousand illegal stop-and-frisks.\nThe plaintiffs have emphasized that only six per cent of stops led to arrests, just two per cent\nyielded seizures of contraband, and only a tenth of one per cent led to seizures of guns. According\nto Moore, “What this means is that the stops are unjustified more than ninety per cent of the time.”\nMoreover, the plaintiffs used Fagan’s findings to support a claim that the police engaged in racial\ndiscrimination. According to Fagan’s analysis, N.Y.P.D. stop-and-frisks are significantly more\nfrequent for black and Hispanic residents—constituting eighty-four per cent of the stops—than\nthey are for white residents, even after adjusting for local crime rates, the racial composition of the\nlocal population, and other social and economic factors. “Statistics is a big part of how we are\nproving racial discrimination by the police,” Darius Charney, who is a co-lead counsel, with Moore,\nin the Floyd case, said. “We don’t need to find blatant racial animus. It doesn’t have to be motivated\nby hatred of black or Hispanic people. We are looking at evidence of stereotypical thinking. We’re\nlooking for cops using race as a factor to make these decisions in a law-enforcement context. It’s\nusing race as a proxy for crime.”\nIn public, police officials have a clear answer to these accusations. “We have had tremendous\nsuccess,” Raymond Kelly, the police commissioner since 2002, told me. “Crime is down, and stop-\nand-frisk is an important reason why.” Civil libertarians say that other factors (such as changing\ninner-city demographics and the end of the crack epidemic) are involved, and dispute any clear\ncorrelation between more aggressive police behavior and the falloff in crime. What is indisputable\nis that since Bloomberg took office, in 2002, murders have dropped twenty-eight per cent, to four\nhundred and nineteen in 2012, the lowest number since the city began keeping records, in 1963.\nEven compared with other cities where crime has also declined, New York has experienced\ndramatic changes. Since 2002, major crimes across the country have declined fourteen per cent; in\nNew York, they have declined thirty-four per cent. The contrast is even more striking between New\nYork and other big cities. If New York had Detroit’s murder rate last year, there would have been\nforty-five hundred murders in the city—more than ten times the actual number.\nLawyers for the city tried to make the argument before Scheindlin about the effectiveness of\nstop-and-frisk, but she shut them down before they had the chance. In order to rebut Fagan’s\nanalysis of the UF-250 forms, they sought the testimony of Dennis Smith, a professor of public\npolicy at New York University who is an expert on police management. In particular, the city\nlawyers wanted Smith to testify about his view that the stop-and-frisk policy was an important factor\nin what they termed “the historic crime decline achieved by New York City.”\nIn a pretrial ruling, Scheindlin excluded much of Smith’s proposed testimony. She said that\n“permitting the parties to delve into the question of whether the stop-and-frisk program actually\nreduces crime would risk turning the trial into a policy debate over the wisdom of the program\nrather than a judicial proceeding that assesses plaintiffs’ constitutional claims.” Still, as the trial has\nwww.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin?printable=true&currentPage=all 7/13\n\n11/11/13 Jeffrey Toobin: A Judge Takes On Stop-and-Frisk : The New Yorker\nunfolded, city lawyers have continued to argue that stop-and-frisk has been a success—to\nScheindlin’s mounting irritation. When Brenda Cooke, the city’s lead attorney, who was cross-\nexamining Fagan, tried to make that point, Scheindlin cut her off.\n“I got to put a stop to this,” the Judge said. “It is not a good use of my time. For one thing, I’ve\nsaid repeatedly that one issue that is not present here is the effectiveness of this policy, because\nthat’s not for this court. This court is only here to judge the constitutionality. . . . We could stop\ngiving Miranda warnings. That would probably be exciting for reducing crimes. But we don’t allow\nthat. So there are a number of things that might reduce crime, but they’re unconstitutional. This\ncourt is only concerned with the Constitution, not with the effectiveness of the policy. I’ve tried\nand tried to explain that. This is my third or fourth try.”\nEven then, the city’s witnesses persisted in defending stop-and-frisk as a sure means to reduce\ncrime. In a way, the entire conflict in the case came down to a single exchange between Moore and\nJoseph J. Esposito, who had just stepped down, after thirteen years, as the chief of department in\nthe N.Y.P.D., the highest-ranked uniformed officer in the force. Chief Espo, as he is known, was a\nrenowned figure in the N.Y.P.D., and his demeanor on the stand suggested that he was more\naccustomed to giving orders than to answering questions. Esposito poorly concealed his contempt\nas Moore, shambling but relentless, pursued him about the propriety of stop-and-frisk. Moore\nnoted that the number of stop-and-frisks had increased from approximately ninety-seven thousand,\nin 2002, to almost six hundred and eighty-five thousand, in 2011.\n“So that increase is all on your watch, correct?” Moore asked.\n“Yes, it is,” Esposito said, plainly seething. After a slight pause, he volunteered, eyes flashing,\n“As is the forty-per-cent decrease in crime during my time—as is the eighty-per-cent decrease in\nthe last twenty years.”\nI\nn the Southern District, plaintiffs in civil cases can designate new cases as related to old ones\nand thus guarantee that the same judge presides. Ever since the Daniels case, civil-rights and\ncivil-liberties groups have continued to challenge the stop-and-frisk policies of the N.Y.P.D. Each\ntime, the plaintiffs have made sure that the cases went before Judge Scheindlin, who currently has\nthree such class actions on her docket. The Floyd case challenges the practice citywide; Davis v.\nCity of New York, which will go to trial later this year, involves stops at city-owned housing\nprojects; and Ligon v. City of New York, which is farthest along in the process, concerns searches\nat privately owned properties around the city.\nThe Ligon case was initiated by the Bronx Defenders, a nonprofit organization that represents\nindigent defendants in the borough. The lawsuit was based on the experience of, among others,\nCharles Bradley, a fifty-year-old security guard from the South Bronx who went to visit his fiancée\nat her apartment building, in the Parkchester neighborhood, on May 3, 2011. When he went\nupstairs, she didn’t answer her doorbell at first—she is deaf in one ear—so Bradley went\nwww.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin?printable=true&currentPage=all 8/13\n\n11/11/13 Jeffrey Toobin: A Judge Takes On Stop-and-Frisk : The New Yorker\ndownstairs to wait. “An officer got out of an unmarked van and came up to me,” Bradley recalled. “I\njust accommodated the officer to the best of my ability, and, in turn, what happened was, he went\ninto my pockets. . . . There was nothing in my pockets except my house keys, my cell phone, my\nwallet. The thing about it that was so appalling was that I had spent my last dollar to see my loved\none. And then he said, ‘Fuck that, you’re going in.’ ” Bradley was arrested for trespassing, a\nmisdemeanor, and strip-searched.\nAt the local precinct, Bradley was given a Desk Appearance Ticket, a common first step in the\nlegal process for minor offenses in New York City. He was instructed to appear in criminal court\non July 19th, but he faced a more immediate problem. “There was a domino effect from being\narrested,” Bradley said. The arrest would be reported to a New York State licensing agency for\nsecurity guards, and that might mean the loss of Bradley’s job. “I need a license to be a security\nguard, and I would have lost it if they pressed charges,” he said. “If I lose my license, I lose my\nincome. I could have been put into homelessness for all this.”\nBradley took the ticket to the offices of the Defenders, who have pioneered what they call\n“holistic defense,” a method based on recognizing that, for criminal defendants like Bradley,\ndeportation, eviction, or the loss of parental rights may be more ruinous than conviction or jail.\nBradley met with two lawyers—an employment specialist and a criminal-defense attorney. “Charles\nwas freaking out,” Molly Kovel, the employment lawyer, said. “We had seen it before. Many of our\nclients are security guards or cabdrivers, and both are licensed by the government. For a lot of\nminor crimes, the bigger threat to their lives is losing their jobs, rather than getting convicted.”\nKovel kept the licensing authorities at bay while a colleague, Cara Suvall, dealt with the criminal\ncase. “I had the problem of how to prove his innocence,” Suvall said. “So we went and got a\nnotarized letter from his fiancée saying that he really was visiting her. I took it to the district\nattorney, and they agreed to drop the charges.”\nStill, the experience of Bradley and others prompted the Bronx Defenders to file a class-action\nsuit against the city. The case focussed on the N.Y.P.D.’s Operation Clean Halls program, through\nwhich private landlords give the police advance permission to patrol their property. This led to\nLigon v. City of New York, in which the Defenders were joined by the New York Civil Liberties\nUnion, the public-interest group Latino Justice, and the law firm of Shearman & Sterling. (Jaenon\nLigon, the lead plaintiff in that class action, had also claimed to be the victim of an unlawful stop-\nand-frisk.) They charged that the police were using Operation Clean Halls to conduct\nunconstitutional stop-and-frisk searches of innocent citizens like Bradley.\nAt a hearing in October, 2012, Scheindlin listened to testimony from both Bradley and Miguel\nSantiago, the officer who placed the cuffs on him. Santiago testified that Bradley was in a “drug-\nprone location” in a high-crime neighborhood and was “suspiciously walking back and forth”\noutside the building. Santiago said that he approached Bradley by saying, “Excuse me, sir, could you\nwww.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin?printable=true&currentPage=all 9/13\n\n11/11/13 Jeffrey Toobin: A Judge Takes On Stop-and-Frisk : The New Yorker\ncome over here?” and that Bradley could not tell him his girlfriend’s name or produce any\nidentification. But Judge Scheindlin noted that Santiago’s paperwork contradicted his account in\nseveral ways—he had written, for example, that he approached Bradley inside the building.\nIn a hundred-and-fifty-seven-page opinion, handed down on January 8th this year, Scheindlin\ngave the Defenders a resounding victory. “Officer Santiago claimed that he was able to see\nBradley’s suspicious behavior even though he was inside a police van parked across the street,\ntwenty or thirty feet from the door, separated from Bradley not only by the street but by the\nwindows of the front door, a vestibule, the windows of an inner door, and the hallway,” Judge\nScheindlin observed. “I find Bradley’s account credible.” She was especially moved by Bradley’s\nstory. “If an unjustified stop happens to lead to an unjustified arrest for trespassing, as it did in\nCharles Bradley’s case, not every overburdened public defender will have the wherewithal to obtain\na notarized letter from the defendant’s host explaining that the defendant was invited, as Bronx\nDefender Cara Suvall did on behalf of Bradley,” she wrote. “When considering the relative\nhardships faced by the parties, it is important to consider the potentially dire and long-lasting\nconsequences that can follow from unconstitutional stops.” Scheindlin concluded that a “very large\nnumber of constitutional violations took place” as a result of Operation Clean Halls.\nScheindlin had found the city liable in the Ligon case, but what was the remedy? Here the Judge\nsprang a surprise. She wrote that she was going to decide the city’s punishment in the Ligon case\n(which the city had already lost) at the end of the Floyd trial (which had not even taken place). In\nother words, it looked as though Scheindlin were scheduling her remedies hearing as if she had\nalready ruled against the city in Floyd. In a footnote, Scheindlin added, “I emphasize that this ruling\nshould in no way be taken to indicate that I have already concluded that plaintiffs will prevail in\nFloyd.” But the city lawyers in the Floyd case are skeptical that the Judge’s mind is open. “It’s like\nshe has scheduled our sentencing before she’s even found us guilty,” one said.\nP\nolitically, the verdict on stop-and-frisk seems already clear. The Democratic mayoral\ncandidates running to succeed Michael Bloomberg all criticize stop-and-frisk, differing only in\nthe intensity of their complaints. Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker, said recently, at\nBarnard College, “I want to leave it as a tool in police officers’ toolboxes,” but she noted, “We need\nto put an infrastructure of reform around stop-and-frisk.” Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, said at\na mayoral forum, “We need to send a message to every young man of color that they are beloved,\nthey are valuable, they are our future. You can’t do that if you’re constantly treating people as\nsuspects.” John Liu, the comptroller, has gone even further. “Stop-and-frisk doesn’t have to be\namended, it has to be ended,” he said at the forum.\nIn response, Bloomberg took the unusual step last month of giving a speech to the leadership of\nthe N.Y.P.D. in which he both celebrated his record in reducing crime and addressed the allegations\nin the Floyd case. “As the ongoing federal court case is now demonstrating for any objective\nwww.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin?printable=true&currentPage=all 10/13\n\n11/11/13 Jeffrey Toobin: A Judge Takes On Stop-and-Frisk : The New Yorker\nobserver to see,” the Mayor said, “the N.Y.P.D. conducts stops based on seeing something\nsuspicious, or witnesses’ descriptions of suspects, not on any preconceived notions, or on\ndemographic data that would have you stopping old women as often as you stop young men.”\nCommissioner Kelly, for his part, is dismissive of the mayoral candidates’ criticism. “This is just\npandering. This is what goes on in New York politics,” he told me. “They try and get as far left as\nthey can for the primary, where it’s just a tiny number of people who are voting. Then the challenge\nis to get to the center for the general election. That’s all that’s going on here.”\nIn the courtroom, before Judge Scheindlin, the city is attempting to put on a defense. The\nlawyers are pushing back on the plaintiffs’ most incendiary claim—that the stop-and-frisk policy\nhas been applied in a racially discriminatory manner. “It’s close to a perfect correlation between\nwho is committing crime and who is being stopped,” Celeste Koeleveld, the deputy Corporation\nCounsel who is supervising the defense, said. “That’s true in minority neighborhoods, and also in\npredominantly white areas, like Staten Island.” She noted that more than half of the N.Y.P.D.\nconsists of racial minorities. Kelly goes further, asserting that stop-and-frisk protects, rather than\noppresses, the African-American community. In a speech last month before Al Sharpton’s National\nAction Network, Kelly said, “African-Americans, who represent twenty-three per cent of the city’s\npopulation, made up sixty-four per cent of the murder victims and seventy-one per cent of the\nshooting victims in this city last year.” He added, “African-American men between the ages of\nsixteen and thirty-seven, who are just four per cent of the city’s population, comprise forty per cent\nof those murdered citywide; eighty-two per cent of these young men were killed with a firearm. As\na city, as a society, we cannot stand idly by in the face of these facts.” He said, “I believe that this\ntactic is lifesaving,” and, referring to Terry v. Ohio, he added, “It is also lawful and constitutional as\nupheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1968.”\nNevertheless, it appears that public criticism—and Scheindlin’s rulings—has already changed\nthe behavior of the police. In March, just as the Floyd trial was beginning, the N.Y.P.D. revised its\ninstructions to officers in filling out the stop-and-frisk reports, demanding that they provide\nnarrative details on their reasons for the confrontations. More significant, perhaps, in the first\nquarter of this year the number of police stops dropped by fifty-one per cent.\nI\nn both the Floyd and the Ligon cases, the plaintiffs are asking for Scheindlin to appoint an\nindependent monitor, to make sure that the police comply with the Constitution. They want the\nJudge to impose a sort of receivership on the police, creating a dual internal authority as a check on\nthe existing leadership. As a model, the plaintiffs’ lawyers cite a case in Cincinnati a decade ago, in\nwhich the city agreed to fund an independent monitor who filed regular reports on the local cops’\ncompliance with the law. (Bloomberg called this notion a recipe for chaos.) The idea of the\nindependent monitor, like the lawsuits themselves, is rooted in the hope that a single judge can\ndiagnose a complex problem and reform a huge organization like the New York Police Department\nwww.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin?printable=true&currentPage=all 11/13\n\n11/11/13 Jeffrey Toobin: A Judge Takes On Stop-and-Frisk : The New Yorker\nbased on the imperfect medium of trial testimony. Scheindlin’s dedication to protecting citizens’\nrights is beyond question; it is less clear that she has the wisdom, or even the ability, to impose her\nvision in the real world of New York.\nScheindlin’s confidence in her understanding of the Constitution remains unshaken. Back in her\nchambers, after a long day of testimony from a plaintiff’s expert on police procedures, Scheindlin\ntalked about another celebrated case of hers. Shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11,\n2001, investigators found the name and phone number of Osama Awadallah on a scrap of paper in a\ncar rented by one of the hijackers. On September 21, 2001, F.B.I. agents in California arrested\nAwadallah. He was not charged with any crime but was held as a material witness. On October 10th,\nhe testified before a grand jury in New York that he was acquainted with one of the hijackers but\ndenied knowing another who lived in the San Diego area. He was indicted for perjury, but on April\n20, 2002, before the trial had even begun, Scheindlin threw out the case against him.\nIn a pair of lengthy opinions, Scheindlin said that the government had violated the material-\nwitness law, by holding Awadallah too long and under unduly harsh conditions. She quoted the\nfamous Supreme Court case of Ex Parte Milligan, in 1866: “The Constitution of the United States\nis a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its\nprotection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances.” The Court of Appeals\nreversed Scheindlin’s ruling and ordered her to bring Awadallah to trial. The trial ended in a hung\njury; in a second trial, he was acquitted.\n“That case was just an enormously satisfying experience,” Scheindlin told me. “What I did was\ngutsy, because it was so close to 9/11. For me to suppress that evidence stunned people, because\nthere was no question that he did know the hijackers. You saw the world changing in how each jury\nsaw the case. The first jury was eleven-to-one to convict. But by the time of the second trial the\nBush policies were unpopular, and he was acquitted. That was a vindication.”\nEach day, before Scheindlin goes to court, the last thing she sees in her chambers is a framed\ncopy of an article she co-wrote with Brian Lehman, a former law clerk, in the New York Law\nJournal. Headlined “ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER,” and published in September of 2006, it was, like\nmany stories published around that time, a commemoration of an anniversary. “It was a day in\nSeptember that changed America forever,” she wrote. But her story wasn’t about September 11,\n2001. It was about September 25, 1789, the day that Congress passed the Bill of Rights. Thanks to\nthat document, the authors wrote, “If a judge decides that a defendant’s rights have been violated and\nthe case is dismissed, a remarkable thing happens: the government bows to the rule of law.” ♦\nPHOTOGRAPH: REPORTAGE BY GETTY IMAGES\nPrint\nMore\nwww.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin?printable=true&currentPage=all 12/13\n\n11/11/13 Jeffrey Toobin: A Judge Takes On Stop-and-Frisk : The New Yorker\nShare\nClose\nReddit\nLinked In\nEmail\nSubscribe now to get more of The New Yorker's signature mix of politics, culture, and the arts.\nwww.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_toobin?printable=true&currentPage=all 13/13\n\nAPPENDIX D \n\nNY 'frisk' judge calls criticism 'below-the-\nbelt' \n  \nBy LARRY NEUMEISTER May 19, 2013 2:44 PM \n \nNEW YORK (AP) — The federal judge presiding over civil rights challenges to the stop-and-\nfrisk practices of the New York Police Department has no doubt where she stands with the \ngovernment. \n\"I know I'm not their favorite judge,\" U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin said during an \nAssociated Press interview Friday. It was another moment of candor for a judge known for \nher call-it-as-she-sees-it manner and willingness to confront government lawyers in a \ncourthouse where many judges — former federal prosecutors themselves — seem less \ninclined. \n\"I do think that I treat the government as only one more litigant,\" she said during the \ninterview that proceeded with a single rule: no questions about the trial over police tactics \nthat reaches closing arguments Monday. \nThe trial has put the NYPD and City Hall on the defensive as they justify a long-running \npolicy of stopping, questioning and frisking some residents to deter crime. Critics say it \ndiscriminates against blacks and Hispanics. Scheindlin is not being asked to ban the tactic, \nsince it has been found to be legal, but she does have the power to order reforms in how it \nis implemented. \nDuring the trial, she's shown an impatience with lawyers on both sides when they stray from \nthe topic at hand, and a willingness to directly question witnesses — including police \nsupervisors — about the nuts and bolts of trying to keep streets safe. \n\"I don't think they're entitled to deference,\" she said of government attorneys. \"I think some \nof the judges are a little more timid to maybe disagree with the U.S. attorney's office. ... \nThey have to prove their case like anybody else. I don't give them special respect. Maybe \nsome judges do because they came from the office, they know the people there, whatever. I \ntry not to do that.\" \n\nScheindlin, 66, appointed by President Bill Clinton, has had plenty of high-profile cases in \n19 years in federal court, including three trials of John \"Junior\" Gotti, the son of the late \nlegendary mob boss John Gotti, two trials of a California student who knew two of the Sept. \n11 hijackers and the trial of international arms dealer Viktor Bout. \nThe AP interview came after a New York Daily News article revealed that the staff of Mayor \nMichael Bloomberg had reviewed her record to show that 60 percent of her 15 written \n\"search-and-seizure\" rulings since she took the bench in 1994 had gone against law \nenforcement. \nThe judge called it a \"below-the-belt attack\" on judicial independence. She said it was rare \nwhen any judge grants a request to suppress evidence in a law enforcement case and that \ninclusion of the numerous times when she rejected the requests with oral rulings from the \nbench would likely reduce the total to less than 5 percent. \nShe said reports that the mayor's office was behind the study made it worse. \n\"If that's true, that's quite disgraceful,\" Scheindlin said. \"It was very discouraging and \nupsetting. I can't say it has no toll.\" \nOf such criticism, she said: \"It's very painful. Judges can't really easily defend themselves. \n... To attack the judge personally is completely inappropriate and intimidates judges or it is \nintended to intimidate judges or it has an effect on other judges and that worries me.\" \nA Bloomberg spokesman said Saturday, \"We did a simple search of publicly available \nwritten decisions, as the media is also free to do.\" \nThe New York County Lawyers' Association called the report meaningless because it \nsampled so few Scheindlin rulings. \nScheindlin has faced heat before, most notably a decade ago when she presided over the \ntrials of Osama Awadallah and one newspaper labeled her \"Osama's best friend,\" a \nreference that some could misinterpret to refer to Osama bin Laden. \n\"You could be in danger, physically,\" she said. \nThe Awadallah case is memorable to Scheindlin for how it reflected the mood of the attitude \nacross the country after the Sept. 11 attacks. Awadallah, born in Venezuela and raised in \n\nJordan, was a young immigrant in San Diego who was picked up as a material witness after \nhis telephone number was found in a car that one of the hijackers drove to the airport on \nSept. 11. Prosecutors agreed he was no terrorist but claimed he intentionally misled grand \njurors about how well he knew one of the terrorists. Defense attorneys said he was left \nconfused after 20 days in detention. \nShe said she learned in talking to jurors after Awadallah's first trial that they came within \none vote of convicting him of false statements. At the next trial, he was exonerated. \n\"Same evidence. Same prosecutor. Same defense lawyers. Jury goes from 11-to-1 to 12-\nzip,\" she recalled. \"So I asked what happened. The answer is the country had turned in a \nnew direction.\" \nShe said immediately after Sept. 11, \"people were so worried and so terrified that the next \nattack was around the corner that they were willing to cede many of their civil liberties.\" \nShe added: \"The second half of the (President George W.) Bush term, Bush policies were \nnot popular any longer. People were much more distant from the event of 9/11. Now they \nwere more concerned with civil liberties and less concerned with the security threat. ... I \nthought it was dramatically shown by what happened in that case.\" \nIn choosing law clerks, Scheindlin looks for varied experience like her own. She has been a \nprosecutor and a defense lawyer and was once politically active. \n\"I don't want a kid who's just done seven straight years of A's at Harvard,\" she said. \"I want \nto know that they've done something, worked somewhere. Some experience. Some work. \nSome life. That makes for a rounded person.\" \nAnd should they someday become a judge, it makes them well prepared for the rare case of \nimpact. \n\"That's the day you live for, to do something that you believe is right and that is upheld as \nright and has a national impact, that's great,\" Scheindlin said. \"That's why people want to be \njudges, I think, so they can make a difference.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Tom Hays and Colleen Long contributed to this report. \n\nAPPENDIX E \n\n11/11/13 New York Law Journal: Stop and Frisk Judge Relishes Her Independence\nALM Properties, Inc.\nPage printed from: New York Law Journal\nBack to Article\nStop-and-Frisk Judge Relishes Her Independence\nMark Hamblett\nNew York Law Journal\n2013-05-20 00:00:00.0\nThe judge presiding over one of the most politically charged cases in recent New York City history says her 20 years on the\nbench have taught her to \"appreciate more than ever the words 'judicial independence.'\"\nShira Scheindlin, in a recent interview during the nine-week bench trial over the constitutionality of the New York City Police\nDepartment's anti-crime stop, question and frisk policies, said there are too many judges who don't want to take chances\nand deliver controversial rulings.\n\"They are fearful or they want a promotion or whatever it is, they don't exercise the independence they should have. State\ncourt judges of course face re-election, which is a terrible thing, but federal judges, who are appointed for life, don't\nappreciate how much independence they have—many of them are a little cautious, more cautious than they should be.\"\nFew court observers would describe Scheindlin as cautious and the judge spoke freely when she sat down recently with the\nLaw Journal to discuss some of her prior decisions and her views on being a federal judge. The only subject off the table\nwas the ongoing trial, expected to wrap up on May 20 with closing arguments.\nThe judge, who already has made some rulings critical of the city for stop-and-frisk, has not been reluctant to make\ncontroversial decisions in the realm of civil liberties and constitutional law that have drawn the ire of police and prosecutors.\n\"I do think judges have a duty to protect individual rights because that's what the Bill of Rights is all about,\" she said. \"It's the\nresponsibility of the judiciary to protect those rights granted by our Founders. Now, does that make me an activist? No. Some\npeople have said I'm conservative because I go back to what the Founders wrote and what they meant. I see it as abiding by\nmy constitutional duty and our oath.\"\nAmong her other matters, Scheindlin (See Profile) has issued a series of groundbreaking opinions on e-discovery in\nZubulake v. UBS Warburg, which she regards as her most significant case. (See, for example, NYLJ, May 13, 2003, and July\n25, 2003).\nShe has presided over multi-district litigation on conflicts of interest at investment banks in initial public offerings, and has\npresided over the trials of mobster John Gotti Jr. and Police Officer Francis Livoti in the use of a deadly chokehold on Anthony\nBaez.\nScheindlin has held parts of New York's anti-harassment statute unconstitutional; found police in contempt for continuing to\nenforce a law against loitering for the purposes of begging for money or cruising for sex that had long been ruled\nunconstitutional; held the National Football League was violating the antitrust laws by preventing underclassman Maurice\nClarett from participating in the league draft (later reversed); and compelled the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to\nreinstate subway advertising that mocked Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.\n\"What I've learned is do what you think is right, follow the law, do what you think you can do,\" she said. \"Sometimes there is\nno precedent that constrains you and you can really strike out and write what you think is the right answer.\"\nwww.newyorklawjournal.com/PubArticleFriendlyNY.jsp?id=1202600625151# 1/5\n\n11/11/13 New York Law Journal: Stop and Frisk Judge Relishes Her Independence\nScheindlin, 66, has earned a reputation as a hard-working judge and has kept up a full docket since taking senior status last\nyear. She takes an average of 15 new cases a month and has a pending caseload of 132, not including related cases in\nmultidistrict litigation. Her workload is in the upper half of senior judges in the district.\nShe sets a quick pace in her courtroom, with little tolerance for lawyers who obfuscate or belabor a point. She often asks\nquestions herself when things slow down, although she said, \"I don't think I've committed the sin of taking over trials.\"\n\"She is a judge who runs a very, very strong courtroom and has a clear idea of how she wants to do it,\" said one veteran\nSouthern District practitioner.\n\"I think sometimes people can be critical of her because she can sometimes be sharp to litigants, put people down and be\ncritical. But from my experience, when she comes on the bench, she's prepared, she has strong views and she has the\ncourage of her convictions,\" he added. \"Her ideas can sometimes be idiosyncratic. She's not afraid to think independently.\"\nScheindlin \"runs a very orderly courtroom, dignified, and as a jurist she's not only smart but she's creative,\" said Robert Swift\nof Kohn Swift & Graf in Philadelphia, who has appeared before her. \"She asks good questions and is polite to counsel, but,\nby the same token, she doesn't let counsel argue silly motions or make silly requests—she's well in control of her\ncourtroom. She's certainly been reversed, but that's also indicative of a judge being certain of what the law should be—not\njust what it is.\"\nLike other judges, Scheindlin said she expects lawyers who appear before her to be well prepared.\n\"They need to be familiar with the facts and the law on the spot and not say, 'Oh sorry, I have to go look that up, or 'I'm sorry, I\nhave to ask a colleague,'\" she said.\nUnusual Path to the Law\nScheindlin was born in Washington, D.C., raised in Detroit, and educated at the University of Michigan, Columbia University\nand Cornell Law School.\nShe was working at Columbia as a graduate student in Far Eastern studies, but she said the language requirements were\nso rigorous—years of Chinese and Japanese included—\"that I knew I would never finish my dissertation. So I said, 'What's\nnext?'\n\"I really didn't know much about the law but I knew it offered a broad education that gives you lots of possibilities of what you\nmight do with it afterward,\" she said.\n\"I think at that point I thought I was going to be doing divorces and house closings and DWIs,\" she said. \"I thought I'd be a\nlocal town lawyer married to a professor on the campus.\"\nAfter graduating from Cornell in 1975, she spent a year at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, then clerked for Southern District\nJudge Charles Brieant and was hired by David Trager, who was then the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District. She rose from\ngeneral prosecutions to handling political corruption cases before being named deputy chief of the Economic Crimes Unit\nwhile working as Trager's administrative assistant U.S. attorney.\nScheindlin counts Trager, along with Brieant and Eastern District Judge Jack Weinstein, as mentors.\nTrager, she said, \"was funny, he would speak in the imperative—'you will get a clerkship, you will apply to be a magistrate.\"\nShe spent a year as general counsel at the New York City Department of Education and then returned to the Eastern District\nas a magistrate judge from 1982 to 1986, where she was also appointed as special master by Weinstein in the Agent\nOrange cases and litigation over asbestos.\nScheindlin returned to private practice in 1986 as a partner with Budd, Larner, Gross, Rosenbaum, Greenberg & Sade and\nthen Herzfeld & Rubin, where she worked as a commercial litigator until she was named a federal judge by President Bill\nClinton in 1994, part of a wave of new judges who sometimes refer to themselves as the \"Class of '94.\"\nIt is rare for magistrates to be promoted to Article III judgeships, and Scheindlin said her experience as a special master and\nmagistrate —the first woman magistrate judge or district judge in the Eastern District—helped her hit the ground running\nwhen she took the bench in Manhattan.\n\"I just took that bench and I knew what I was doing,\" she said. \"And I got feedback right away like, 'Boy you look like you've\nbeen doing this forever' and I would make a joke, 'Well, that's because I have.'\"\nwww.newyorklawjournal.com/PubArticleFriendlyNY.jsp?id=1202600625151# 2/5\n\n11/11/13 New York Law Journal: Stop and Frisk Judge Relishes Her Independence\nShe added,\"I was incredibly fortunate—it is not easy for those who have not had any judicial experience.\"\nScheindlin said she never had any interest in moving to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit because cases are\nbuilt at the district court level.\nDistrict judges \"have a much more exciting job than the Court of Appeals, because we shape the case in the first instance.\nWe shape the issue—the case comes in the door and we are the first judge on the line, with the first crack at giving an\nanswer and shaping a ruling, shaping the whole future of that case, right?\n\"The Court of Appeals has to use what we've done—we have the tough job—all they can do is review it and say 'You got it\nright or you got it wrong.'\"\nScheindlin said the problem with the appellate court is that \"there you've got to negotiate and get votes and there's three of\nyou and you can end up in dissent when you really don't want to. To me, this is the best of all worlds.\"\nOne case where the circuit said Scheindlin \"got it wrong\" was an opinion she remains proud of—her ruling that the\ngovernment had abused the material witness statute by detaining Osama Awadallah in the 9/11 investigation and then\nprosecuting him for perjury. Awadallah had known two of the 9/11 hijackers in California (NYLJ, April 30, 2002).\nScheindlin dismissed the charges, calling it a \"perjury trap\" and holding the material witness statute was intended to be\nused only for trial witnesses, not people being interviewed in connection with an investigation.\nThe Second Circuit reversed and sent it back for trial (NYLJ, Nov. 10, 2003). The first jury hung 11 to 1 for conviction. The\nsecond, the judge recalled, \"was 12-zip for acquittal.\"\n\"What happened in between?\" Scheindlin asked. \"It was exactly the same evidence, the same lawyers, and it was word for\nword the same trial record. What happened is that, it was later in the Bush administration and his policies were no longer as\npopular and people had pulled back…and were now looking at some of the consequences of the event that they didn't really\nlike.\"\nBut the judge also said that the jury in the second trial was subjected to a \"much stronger voir dire.\"\n\"The second questionnaire worked much harder to probe bias—'did you know anybody even indirectly, who was injured that\nday?'\"\n\"We know that the first jury was in tears, people were crying, telling about their neighbor who had lost a son, which was not at\nall the point of the prosecution.\"\n'Judges Are Human Beings'\nScheindlin's ruling in the Awadallah case drew criticism that she said found hard to take.\n\"Judges are human beings and it always hurts to be attacked when you can't defend yourself—that's a very painful thing,\"\nshe said. \"Over the years I have read editorials such as the famous 'Osama's Best Friend' after the Awadallah decision, it\nwas hurtful.\n\"I would have liked to have been able to explain the decision so that the public understood it so I was not wrongly attacked\nbut a judge doesn't have that ability,\" she said. \"In recent years the bar associations have really stepped up to the plate and\ntried to defend judges, not on the merits of their decisions but by explaining their job, that the judge is a neutral and does the\nbest they can. To attack them personally when it's not a matter of dishonesty, just disagreement, is a terrible thing.\"\nWith her involvement in the stop-and-frisk litigation Scheindlin has had to cope with sharp criticism from city officials like\nPolice Commissioner Raymond Kelly, who has accused her of being in the thrall of a few civil rights lawyers.\nThe New York County Lawyers' Association wrote to the New York Daily News on May 15 to protest an article reporting that\nan \"internal report\" by the mayor's office purporting to show that Scheindlin is biased against law enforcement because she\nhas ruled against the police in nine of 15 written search-and-seizure opinions she has issued since 1994.\nIn its letter, NYCLA argued that the report was misleading because it did not consider her suppression decisions from the\nbench. Moreover, NYCLA wrote, \"Judges are not supposed to grade on the curve. They are supposed to decide cases on\ntheir merits,\" and the report didn't consider the merits of Scheindlin's rulings.\n\"I think it's inappropriate to label any judge as liberal or conservative,\" Scheindlin said in the interview. \"I like to think of myself\nas a fair-minded neutral who calls the case outcomes the way that the law and justice require.\"\nwww.newyorklawjournal.com/PubArticleFriendlyNY.jsp?id=1202600625151# 3/5\n\n11/11/13 New York Law Journal: Stop and Frisk Judge Relishes Her Independence\nImproved Atmosphere\nScheindlin said she thinks Americans' attitude toward civil liberties has changed since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\"I think it's better—I think the worst time was around 9/11. People just didn't want to hear about the rights of anybody when\nthey felt their security was threatened—so I think, actually its been slowly better for the last decade as 9/11 has receded,\"\nshe said. \"One worries again, though, with the Boston Marathon bombers and whether public opinion shifts back, but I don't\nthink anybody was particularly outraged [the surviving suspect] wasn't read Miranda rights.\n\"It's events like this that test people's commitments to civil liberties…I think the atmosphere has been much better because\nmore of the population has been critical of what I might call the Bush-era policies—the torture memo, the Guantanamo\nissue, the military courts, the detention without charges.\"\nShe said she thinks that President Barack Obama would like to close the detention center at Guantanamo but cannot get\nCongress to go along.\n\"It's deeply troubling to hold people in perpetuity without charging them,\" Scheindlin said. \"We like to think we don't do that.\"\nScheindlin said that politics influences the selection of federal judges, but that is mainly on the appellate court level.\n\"Let's be realistic, these are political appointments and the makeup of the circuit judges in this circuit is slowly changing now\nthat President Obama has been here five years,\" she said.\nBut she said that the Southern District had been \"extraordinarily lucky\" in avoiding political polarization.\n\"I'm saying that it's not partisan, she said. \"All through the Bush years, all through the Obama years we have had really high\nquality people. We are so lucky here we don't have political hacks. We have well-qualified judges virtually across the board.\"\nScheindlin said that she was disappointed in the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling last month on the Alien Tort Claims Act,\nKiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, 569 U.S. — (2013), determining that there was no extraterritorial application of the law.\nIn 2009, Scheindlin had recognized aiding and abetting liability for corporations on human rights violations in South Africa,\nthe case along with Awadallah that has given her the greatest pride (NYLJ, April 9, 2009). But her ruling was put on hold\nwhile the Supreme Court considered the issue.\nScheindlin said Justice Samuel Alito \"reached out\" and skirted the aiding and abetting question just to strike down the law\non extraterritoriality grounds, and \"that was sad.\"\nScheindlin observed that new technologies had changed the law since she joined the bench, as evidenced by her own e-\ndiscovery rulings in Zubulake and other cases.\n\"This is what lawyers really talk about—social media, GPS, cell sites, data collection, technology-assisted review,\" she said.\n\"The biggest change in the law is that all these issues that have arisen out of the new world we live in.\n\"Now, the civil side is very advanced, the criminal side is just beginning to catch up, but all data is electronic data, all\ndiscovery is e-discovery,\" she said.\nAnd, like many judges, she worries about the impact of social media on juries.\nIn the case of arms trafficker Viktor Bout, she made the jury sign a \"pledge\" not to go on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or other\noutlets and promise they would not communicate that way, and if they did, \"they understood they would be subjected to\nprosecution which was supposed to be an in terrorem effect,\" she said.\nThey signed, but one juror in the whole selection process said, \"'I can't sign that' and I said ' Well, thank you for telling me,\nyou're off,\" Scheindlin said. \"It really is threatening to the jury system—the ease of obtaining evidence outside the courtroom.\nThis has happened again and again.\"\nScheindlin has been married for almost 30 years to Stanley Friedman, the associate dean of education at SUNY Downstate\nMedical Center. She has two grown children.\nShe admits to having virtually no outside interests.\n\"I love to work,\" she said. \"The only other way I know how to enjoy myself is exercise.

      "text": "Case 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 410-1   Filed 01/07/20   Page 1 of 9\nMEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING \nMEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE NEW YORK CITY \nPOLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE NEW YORK CITY CIVILIAN COMPLAINT . \nREVIEW BOARD \nMemorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") entered into on this  day of  N:::32019, \nbetween the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\"), with headquarters at One Police Plaza, \nNew  York,  New  York  10038;  and  the  New  York  City  Civilian  Complaint  Review  Board \n(\"CCRB\"), with offices at 100 Church Street, New York, New York 10007 (collectively the \n\"Parties\"). \nWHEREAS, Section 440 of the New York City Charter gives CCRB the power to receive, \ninvestigate, hear, make findings and recommend action upon complaints by members of the public \nagainst members of the police department that allege misconduct involving excessive use of force, \nabuse of authority, discourtesy, or use of offensive language (\"FADO\"); and \nWHEREAS, in accordance with Section 440 of the New York City Charter, CCRB's \ninvestigators collect and review all available evidence, such as documents and video and audio \nrecordings, including footage from body worn cameras (\"BWC\"), and interview all available \nvictims, witnesses, subject officers, and witness officers, among others, as part of its investigative \nprocess, and \nWHEREAS, Section 1-23(e) of Title 38-A of the Rules of the City of New York states \nthat the CCRB may obtain records and other materials from NYPD which are necessary for the \ninvestigation of complaints submitted to the CCRB, except such records and materials that cannot \nbe disclosed by law, and the CCRB may issue subpoenas for those requests; and \nWHEREAS, the CCRB's Administrative Prosecution Unit (\"APU\"), which was created \npursuant to a separate Memorandum of Understanding between CCRB and NYPD dated April 2, \n2012, is authorized to prosecute substantiated cases where the CCRB has recommended that \nCharges and Specifications be brought against a subject officer, except in those cases where the \nPolice Commissioner retains jurisdiction; and \nWHEREAS, Section 440 of the New York City Charter requires that NYPD provide \nassistance as CCRB may reasonably request, cooperate fully with CCRB investigations, and \nprovide the CCRB, upon request, records and other materials necessary for the investigation of \n1 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 410-1   Filed 01/07/20   Page 2 of 9\ncomplaints submitted to CCRB, except such records or materials that cannot be disclosed by law; \nand \nWHEREAS, Section 434 of the New York City Charter gives the Police Commissioner \ncognizance and control over the disposition and discipline of the department and police force; and \nWHEREAS, Section 14-115 of the New York City Administrative Code gives the Police \nCommissioner discretionary power to discipline members of the department for criminal offenses, \nneglect of duty, violation of rules, neglect or disobedience of orders, conduct injurious to the public \npeace or  welfare,  or immoral conduct or conduct  unbecoming of an  officer,  by  reprimand, \nsuspension, with or without pay, or dismissal; and \nWHEREAS, while the CCRB investigates civilian complaints independent from NYPD, \nCCRB's Charter-mandated  jurisdiction  over  FADO  complaints  brought  by civilians  against \nmembers of NYPD makes the CCRB an integral component of NYPD's disciplinary process; \nWHEREAS, the NYPD has provided body-worn cameras (\"BWC\") to police officers on \npatrol and has begun wider deployment of BWCs to officers throughout the department, and the \ncamera footage routinely captures interactions between police officers and members of the public \nwhom they encounter while on patrol; \nWHEREAS, the CCRB routinely requests BWC footage from the NYPD in connection \nwith investigations it conducts and it is in both parties' interests to create an efficient process by \nwhich CCRB can request such footage from NYPD and NYPD can provide such footage to CCRB; \nWHEREAS, CCRB and NYPD agree that premature submission of a search request, \nwithout information that can be obtained through a diligent investigation prior to submission of \nthe form, is counterproductive and contrary to the intent of this agreement as it will routinely result \nin multiple requests in the same case causing delays in providing video footage to the CCRB by \nthe NYPD; \nWHEREAS,  by  signing  this  agreement  the  NYPD  intends  to expeditiously  process \nrequests for BWC footage it receives from CCRB and to provide relevant footage to CCRB, and \nCCRB intends to make diligent efforts to collect and identify relevant facts and information in \nconnection with complaints it receives before requesting BWC footage so that requests made to \n2 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 410-1   Filed 01/07/20   Page 3 of 9\nthe NYPD will contain as many facts as possible, making it easier for NYPD to identify relevant \nfootage and significantly reducing the need for NYPD to conduct multiple searches for each case; \nNOW THEREFORE, upon the mutual agreement of the Parties, it is agreed as follows: \nI.  CREATION OF BWC SEARCH AND REVIEW FACILITY \n1  NYPD will set up a secure search and viewing room at 100 Church Street, 12th Floor, New \nYork, NY, 10007, or some other mutually convenient location, with at  least ten (10) \ncomputer terminals (\"Secure Room\"). A sufficient number of computer terminals will be \nstaffed by an NYPD employee and a CCRB employee during all operating hours specified \nbelow, for the purpose of entering search criteria and identifying BWC video(s) responsive \nto search requests submitted by the CCRB. The remaining computers will be available for \nCCRB staff to view  BWC videos that  were responsive to CCRB's particular search \nrequests. \n2.  The NYPD and CCRB will each make a supervisor available to address issues that may \narise in the Secure Room. \n3.  The Secure Room will be accessible to CCRB personnel during normal business hours—\nMonday to Friday, specific times to be agreed upon by the NYPD and the CCRB. \n4.  Each CCRB investigator and staff member granted access to the secure room will sign a \nconfidentiality and non-disclosure agreement in regard to the information observed or \nobtained in the Secure Room. \n5.  Each CCRB investigator will have their own unique user name and password for both the \nVievu  Solution and  Axon  Evidence.com systems, which can only be logged into on \ncomputers located in the Secure Room dedicated for this purpose. All logins under each \nuser name will be recorded and subject to audit by the NYPD. Misuse of a user name and/or \naccess privileges or improper dissemination of any information obtained from search \nresults shall be grounds for revocation or suspension of the offender's access privileges by \nthe NYPD. \n6.  CCRB investigators will obtain the same training for both the Vievu Solution and Axon \nEvidence.com systems, by each system's vendor, as is provided to NYPD personnel for \nthe searching and retrieval of video evidence, including all updates and refresher courses. \nCosts for such training will be borne by CCRB. \nII.  SEARCHING AND REVIEW OF BWC FOOTAGE \n1.  CCRB investigators may submit search requests for BWC video in any case where the \nCCRB has received a complaint from a member of the public against a uniform member \nof the NYPD for alleged incidents of misconduct which fall under CCRB's jurisdiction. \n3 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 410-1   Filed 01/07/20   Page 4 of 9\n2.  In order to initiate a search, the CCRB investigator must complete a BWC search request \nform, providing as much information as is available to the investigator at the time of the \nrequest. Prior to submitting the search request, the CCRB investigator shall review all \nrecords that already have been provided by the NYPD, to determine if those records contain \ninformation  needed for the search request form and shall diligently conduct as many \ninvestigatory steps as reasonable to locate additional information necessary to conduct a \ncomprehensive search.  After the request form is complete, the CCRB investigator shall \nemail the search request form to BWC-Legal@nypd.org. \n3.  After receiving the BWC search request form, the NYPD, in the presence of a CCRB \nemployee, will search both the Vievu Solutions and Axon Evidence.com software to locate \nany videos responsive to the search criteria. \na.  The NYPD will use the search terms listed on the search form provided by the \nCCRB investigator. The search terms submitted by CCRB must be reasonably \nrelated to the information provided in the complaint or information obtained during \nCCRB's investigation.  Except in exceptional circumstances, CCRB shall submit \nno more than ten (10) search terms in a search request. \nb.  If the search criteria is too broad or too narrow to reasonably identify relevant BWC \nvideo(s),  the  NYPD  and  CCRB  employees  shall  confer  to  adjust  the  search \nparameters,  and,  if  necessary,  request  additional  information  from the CCRB \ninvestigator who submitted the search request. \nc.  The CCRB employee will determine which BWC video(s) returned by the search \nare relevant and should be made available for viewing by the investigator making \nsuch request. \nd.  Once a video is determined to be relevant: \ni.  In Vievu Solutions, each video will be tagged in the event field with the \ncorresponding CCRB number. \nii.  In  Axon  Evidence.com,  a  case  will  be  created  and  titled  with  the \ncorresponding CCRB case number. \ne.  The entire NYPD BWC database shall be available for search. To the extent that \ncertain videos are on \"lockdown\" and are unavailable, the search results shall reflect \nthat the video exists, but that it is unavailable, or NYPD personnel with access to \n\"lockdown\"  videos  will  perform  an  independent  search  of  such  videos  and \nrepresent to CCRB that the requested video exists, but is not accessible. \n4.  BWC video(s) deemed relevant and responsive to a search request will be shared in its \nentirety by NYPD staff and accessible by CCRB via the terminals in the Secure Room \ndesignated for video review. \n4 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 410-1   Filed 01/07/20   Page 5 of 9\na.  None of the video(s) uploaded for review purposes shall be redacted, clipped, \nedited, deleted or altered in any way. \nb.  The CCRB investigator who submitted the BWC search request shall be notified \nwhen the BWC video(s) becomes accessible in  the Secure Room. The CCRB \ninvestigator  will  appear  at  the  Secure  Room,  at  a  time  convenient  for  the \ninvestigator, and review the uploaded video(s) to determine which video(s), or \nportion(s) thereof, is relevant and needed for the CCRB investigation. \n5.  CCRB investigators are strictly prohibited from making any sound or video recordings of \nany BWC video, or segments thereof, on cell phones or other recording devices. \n6.  CCRB investigators may take notes during the review of BWC video. \n7.  CCRB investigators shall not use any information obtained during this process that is \nunrelated to the incident under investigation. \na.  If, while reviewing video related to a complaint, the CCRB investigator recognizes \nor believes that he or she has observed potential misconduct by an NYPD uniform \nmember of the service (\"UMOS\") unrelated to the incident under investigation by \nthe CCRB, the investigator shall refer the incident to the NYPD's Internal Affairs \nBureau. The CCRB investigator shall  not commence an  investigation  into the \nunrelated incident. \nb.  The  NYPD  IAB  Liaison  will  inform  the  CCRB  of  the  actions,  including \ndispositions, it has taken in response to any such referral. \nc.  If CCRB subsequently receives a complaint from a member of the public regarding \nthe incident that was referred to Internal Affairs Bureau, the NYPD will provide \nthe footage related to the initial referral, pursuant to a new request from CCRB, and \nsubject to the subsequent provisions of this agreement. \nIII.  PRODUCTION OF RESPONSIVE FOOTAGE \n1.  After the CCRB investigator determines which shared BWC video(s), or portion(s) thereof, \nis relevant to the CCRB investigation, the CCRB investigator shall send an email to BWC-\nLegal@nypd.org requesting the specific footage to be shared with the CCRB for download \npurposes. \na.  The email  shall  include, the CCRB case number,  the  requested  file  name(s), \nname(s) of the UMOS, if known, and the time stamps for the specific portion of the \nBWC video(s) being requested, in those instances where the entire video is not \nbeing requested. \n5 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 410-1   Filed 01/07/20   Page 6 of 9\n2.  Absent exceptional circumstances, requested BWC video(s) not requiring redaction shall \nbe provided to the CCRB within ten (10) business days. The NYPD shall make best efforts \nto provide redacted video(s) within twenty-five (25)  business days. \n3.  The entirety of the requested footage shall be provided, subject to the following provisions \nand subsection (d) of subdivision (3) of this section. \na.  If the BWC video request is denied or all or any portion of the requested footage is \nredacted, clipped, altered, or deleted in any way, the changes must be specified in \nwriting by the NYPD along with an  explanation and  rationale for the denial, \nredaction,  or  clipping,  including  specific  citation  to  the  statute  (including \nsubdivision(s), where applicable) and/or legal provision relied upon, if applicable. \nb.  NYPD may redact and/or clip the provided footage according to the following \nconsiderations, as well as subsection (d) below: \ni.  Medical treatment being provided to any private citizen or UMOS. \nii.  Any  NYPD  computer,  mobile  data  terminal,  cell  phone,  or  other \nequipment  depicting:  (a)confidential  databases  or  (b)  confidential \ninformation. \niii.  Any UMOS cell phone depicting personal photos, phone numbers or \nsocial media accounts unrelated to the investigation. \niv.  Any key pad code entries for Department facilities. \nv.  Protecting  the  identity  of  any  undercover  officer  or  confidential \ninformant. In cases where an undercover officer's image is redacted, \nNYPD will inform CCRB of the individual's UC Number. \nc.  For recordings related to cases sealed pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law §§ \n160.50/160.55 or Family Court Act §§ 375.1, 375.2, recordings containing the \nidentity of the victim of a sex crime pursuant to Civil  Rights Law § 50-b, or \nrecordings depicting a juvenile questioned or detained by the Department, if the \nCCRB does not have a release from the individual(s) whose case has been sealed, \nfrom the victim(s) of the sex crime, or the parent/guardian of the juvenile, the \nNYPD  will  blur  the faces  and  redact  the audio of all  personally  identifying \ninformation such as name, date of birth, and address, as well as the audio of any \nadmission of a sex offense pursuant to CRL 50-b of the individual(s) from whom \nthe CCRB has not obtained consent or a release. \nd.  NYPD shall not refuse to disclose or delay disclosure of footage on the ground that \nit  is  conducting  a  concurrent  or  parallel  investigation,  except  for  those \ninvestigations  being conducted  by  the  Force  Investigation  Division  and  other \nsensitive force investigations not being conducted by FID. Notwithstanding, upon \nthe conclusion of the investigation, the BWC footage will be shared with CCRB. \n6 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 410-1   Filed 01/07/20   Page 7 of 9\ne.  Disputes over whether a video is relevant to a CCRB investigation will be resolved \nthrough the procedure described in Section IV, entitled \"Dispute Resolution.\" \nf.  CCRB will adopt procedures to obtain valid consent, when possible, to view and \nuse BWC footage without redaction or blurring at the start of its investigation. \nInformed, verbal consent shall be sufficient.  CCRB investigators shall affirm in \nwriting on their search request form that they have obtained valid consent from the \nproper party, including the name of the individual providing consent. \n(i) CCRB will endeavor to obtain written waivers/consent from depicted \ncomplainants, if possible, and will ensure that CCRB employees accepting \ncomplaints via telephone, in-person or otherwise use scripted language \nseeking a verbal waiver/consent from depicted complainants for recordings \nrelated  to  cases  sealed  pursuant  to  Criminal  Procedure  Law  §§ \n160.50/160.55 or Family Court Act §§ 375.1, 375.2, recordings containing \nthe identity of the victim of a sex crime pursuant to Civil Rights Law § 50-\nb, or recordings depicting a juvenile,. \n4.  NYPD shall share the requested footage via the Vievu Solutions or Axon Evidence.com \nsoftware systems with the CCRB staff designated in both systems, which will only \ninclude members of the CCRB NYPD Liaison Unit. The footage may be downloaded by \nmembers of the CCRB NYPD Liaison Unit which has the necessary download \ncapabilities. \nIV.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n1.  If the CCRB disagrees with the NYPD's denial, redaction or clipping, of requested BWC \nvideo, the Parties shall meet and confer to try to resolve the dispute. \n2.  If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute, the dispute will be referred to the New York \nCity Law Department (\"Law Department\") for review. Disputes will be resolved by the \nCorporation Counsel or his or her designee. The dispute resolution request shall include a \ncopy of the NYPD's denial, the CCRB's explanation for why the recording should have \nbeen disclosed, and any 'other relevant information. A person designated by the NYPD's \nDeputy Commissioner, Legal Matters shall be copied on any dispute resolution request \nsent by the CCRB to the Law Department. \n3.  Both parties agree to timely provide the Law Department with any materials or information \nit requests in order to resolve the dispute. The NYPD and CCRB agree to accept the \ndetermination of the Law Department. \n4.  If prior to the Law Department issuing a determination, the NYPD reconsiders its denial, \nredaction, editing,  deletion  or clip,  it  shall  immediately  provide  the CCRB with  the \n7 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 410-1   Filed 01/07/20   Page 8 of 9\nrecording and  notify the Law Department that  the dispute has been  resolved and  no \ndetermination is necessary. If the CCRB withdraws its challenge to the NYPD's denial, \nredaction, or clip, prior to the Law Department issuing a determination, it shall promptly \nnotify the NYPD and the Law Department that no determination is necessary. \nV.  CONFIDENTIALITY \n1.  The CCRB agrees that records and BWC recordings obtained from the NYPD, and any \nmaterials created therefrom, are confidential, must be kept secure and may not be disclosed \nor made public, except as may be mandated by lawful order of a court of competent \njurisdiction or statute. \n2.  The Parties shall comply with all applicable laws, rules,  regulations, and agreements \npertaining to the confidentiality, privacy and security of the information accessed pursuant \nto this MOU. \n3.  In the event that the CCRB receives a subpoena, judicial order, or other legal process for \ncopies of records related to a sealed case, the CCRB shall notify the NYPD, in writing as \nsoon as practicable. The CCRB shall  not release the records without first notifying the \nNYPD. \n4.  In the event that the CCRB receives a Freedom of Information Law (\"FOIL\") request for \nrecords that include NYPD records obtained pursuant to this MOU, the CCRB shall consult \nand cooperate with NYPD in responding to the FOIL request. Both NYPD and CCRB shall \neach designate a FOIL representative for the purpose of resolving any disagreements. If \nthe Parties cannot agree on which, if any, records should be disclosed pursuant to FOIL, \nthe  records  in  dispute  shall  not  be  disclosed  until  the  Law  Department  issues  a \ndetermination. \n5.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the CCRB from notifying complainants and/or \nvictims of the findings of the CCRB's investigation. \nVI.  TERM AND TERMINATION \n1.

City ofNew York, 08-CV-1034 (AT), \nLigon, et aL v. City of New York, et aL, 12-CV-2274 (AD, \nDavis, et aL v. City ofNew York, et al, 10-CV-0699 (Al), \nTwelfth Report of the Independent Monitor \nDear Judge Torres, \nI am pleased to attach the Monitor's Twelfth Report: The Deployment of Body Worn \nCameras (BWCs) on New York City Police Department (NYPD) Officers.  This report describes \nthe results of the evaluation of the NYPD's BWC pilot program, as required by the Court's \nRemedial Order and modified order.  Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 668, 685 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The goal of the pilot program was to assess the effects of deploying cameras on \npolicing outcomes, community perceptions of policing in their neighborhoods, and whether \ndeployment  results in reducing unconstitutional stops and frisks.  The report describes the \nevaluation plan, presents analytical results, and discusses key findings. \nOne of the important goals of the pilot was to quantify the risks and benefits of deploying \nBWCs in order to assess whether BWCs should be deployed throughout the City.  That goal has \nbeen overtaken by events: the Department made that decision, before the results of the study were \nknown. However, the study can provide guidance for the continued use of BWCs, not only for the \nNYPD, but for police departments throughout the country.  The use of BWCs is not a panacea, as \nthe  results of the study show.  But  it is a powerful  tool for  increasing  transparency  and \naccountability for the public and for police officials. \nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 798   Filed 11/30/20   PagTe 1 ofh 3 e pilot program evaluation design, developed by Professor Anthony Braga, Professor \nJohn MacDonald and other members of the monitor team, was a cluster randomized controlled \ntrial.  Forty precincts with the highest numbers of Citizen Complaint Review Board (CCRB) \ncomplaints against NYPD officers were identified and then matched into 20 pairs based on \ndemographics, socio-economic characteristics, crime and police activity.  Within each pair, one \nprecinct was randomly assigned to have cameras (the treatment precinct) and the other was \nI  Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP \n250 West 55th Street  I  New York, NY 10019-9710  I  www.arnoldporter.com \n\nArnold &Porter \nHonorable Analisa Torres \nNovember 30, 2020 \nPage 2 \nassigned to be without cameras (the control precinct).  Uniformed officers working the third \nplatoon  (3:00  PM  to  midnight  shift)  and  plainclothes  officers  working  Anti-Crime  Unit \nassignments in the treatment precincts wore BWCs for a one-year period. Professor Braga and the \nmonitor team then compared data from the matched pairs of precincts using four sets of outcome \nmeasures: civility of police-citizen interactions, policing activity, police lawfulness, and police—\ncommunity relations. \nThe  study showed  that  deployment  of body-worn  cameras  was  associated  with  a \nstatistically significant decrease in CCRB complaints and a statistically significant increase in the \nnumber of stop reports completed by treatment officers relative to control officers.  Contrary to \nthe fear of expressed by some commentators, the number of arrests, arrests with force, summonses, \ndomestic incident reports, and citizen crime complaint reports did not change when officers in the \ntreatment precincts were compared to officers in the control precincts.  Concerning police-\ncommunity relations, based on surveys conducted in the treatment and control precincts both \nbefore and after the implementation of BWCs, there was no meaningful differences in resident \nperceptions of the police and of police-community relations as a result of BWC use.  This should \nnot be a surprising result.  Views of the police are sometimes deeply imbedded, are formed over \nlong periods of time, and can change based on events that have nothing to do with BWCs or the \nNYPD. It takes much more than deployment of BWCs for a year to change those perceptions. \nIn analyzing the stop reports of officers in the treatment and control precincts, the monitor \nteam found that stop reports of officers in the BWC precincts were less likely to be deemed lawful. \nIn stop reports that involved a frisk and/or a search, the justifications reported for frisking or \nsearching citizens in BWC officer stop reports were also less likely to be judged by the monitor \nteam as constitutional when compared to control officer reports. At first blush, this seems counter-\nintuitive.  Why should using BWCs lead to less lawful results?  Actually, there is a much more \nsensible explanation.  When BWCs are being used, the officers know that there are extra sets of \neyes on their actions, and therefore a failure to file a stop report when required is much more likely \nto be discovered.  So what could be expected is an increase in the number of stop reports for \nencounters that may be problematic.  That is in fact what happened.  There was a meaningful \nincrease in the number of stop reports filed by officers wearing BWCs. \nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 798   Filed 11/30/20   Page 2 of 3\nThis randomized controlled trial suggests that the placement of BWCs on officers resulted \nin the increased documentation of stop reports, particularly of those stops that may have reflected \nunlawful police actions.  As such, BWCs can be a useful tool in reducing underreporting of stops \nand unlawfulness by making stops more transparent to NYPD supervisors and outside monitors \n(e.g., district attorneys, courts, CCRB). \n\nArnold &Porter \nHonorable Analisa Torres \nNovember 30, 2020 \nPage 3 \nThe Court and other readers will find a wealth of technical data and explanations in the \nReport. It was very important to include this so that outside experts can closely review the \nresults and the research methods and statistical models used for the study. \nThank you for the Court's time and attention. \nRespectfully submitted, \nIs/ Peter L.

INTRODUCTION \n    Plaintiffs submit this memorandum of law in response to the Court-Appointed Monitor’s \nmotion to vacate the Court’s prior order approving the Combined Pilot and replace the Combined \nPilot with the City’s “Alternative Plan” for documentation and BWC recording of Level 1 and 2 \nencounters and the Monitor’s two “Proposed Studies.” See ECF Nos. 805, 805-1, and 805-2.  \nThe Monitor’s motion, if granted, would upend three core principles of the this case: \ntransparency, accountability, and community voice in stop-and-frisk reform. In asking to abandon \nthe comprehensive Level 1 and 2 recording scheme of the Combined Pilot in favor of the much \nnarrower one proposed in the Alternative Plan, the Monitor seeks to permanently and severely \nlimit a reform championed by Plaintiffs, community stakeholders, and the Court-appointed JRP \nFacilitator as a potentially critical tool for increasing transparency and accountability around \nNYPD investigative street encounters before that reform has even been tested, thus thwarting the \npurpose of not one, but three prior relief orders of this Court. Moreover, his stated reason for doing \nso,  the  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic,  only  impacts  the  Monitor’s  chosen  systemic  social \nobservation (“SSO”) research and data collection method for the Combined Pilot; it in no way \nhinders NYPD officers’ ability to document Level 1 and 2 encounters as comprehensively as the \nFacilitator recommended and the Combined Pilot contemplated, nor does it lessen the need to \nstudy that comprehensive documentation scheme to determine if it should be implemented by the \nNYPD. Accordingly, the Monitor’s motion should be denied in its entirety.  \nIf the Court is inclined to do away with the Combined Pilot, it should replace it with a \nmodified version of the City’s Alternative Plan that more closely tracks the comprehensive Level \n1 and 2 recording and documentation scheme recommended by the Facilitator and included in the \nCombined Pilot. The Court should direct the NYPD to pilot this modified Alternative Plan and \ndirect the Monitor to use his Proposed Studies to assess its relative costs, benefits, and feasibility, \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 5 of 28\nand then report to the Court on whether the modified Plan should be implemented throughout the \nNYPD.    \nII.        BACKGROUND \nA.  The Court’s Prior Rulings on the Importance of Narrative Explanations of the \nReasons for an Investigative Encounter \n \nThe  Court’s  prior  rulings  underscore  the  need  for  narrative  explanations  for  all \ninvestigative encounters. The Court’s Liability Opinion highlighted the difficulty of conducting \nthorough Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment review without the benefit of a narrative explanation \nfor police stops. Even where officers completed UF-250 stop reports, checking the reason for a \nstop from a list, the Court found many of the form options vague and subjective. “Without an \naccompanying narrative explanation for the stop, these checkmarks cannot reliably demonstrate \nindividualized reasonable suspicion.” Liability Opinion, ECF No. 373 at 8. Moreover, the Court \nconcluded that the NYPD had, for a decade, willfully disregarded officers’ failure to properly \ndocument stops. Id. at 93. Accordingly, the Court’s Remedial Order directed the NYPD to amend \nthe UF-250 form to include a narrative section describing the reason for a stop in officers’ own \nwords. See Remedial Order, ECF No. 372 at 19. This is especially important where the reason for \nthe stop, such as “high crime area” or “furtive movement”, is vague and difficult to evaluate. In \naddition to narratives on stop reports, officers were also required to provide narratives of stops \nwith specificity in their activity logs. The Monitor was instructed to assist the NYPD in ensuring \nthat activity logs were properly completed and that officers who fail to comply with documentation \nrequirements were adequately disciplined. Id. at 23.  \n \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 6 of 28\nB.  The Facilitator’s Recommendations Regarding Electronic Documentation of \nLevel 1 and 2 Encounters and BWC Recording of Level 1 Encounters  \n \n  As part of the remedies in this case, the Court created the Joint Remedial Process (“JRP”). \nThis process was designed to uplift reform recommendations from the communities most affected \nby years of unconstitutional and racially discriminatory stops. The Court appointed the Honorable \nAriel Belen (Ret.) as the Facilitator of this process. His team spent more than a year conducting \nfocus groups and community forums, meeting with over 2,000 individuals from those New York \nCity communities most heavily impacted by the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk and trespass enforcement \npractices to consider their input on how to meaningfully reform those practices. See JRP Final \nReport and Recommendations, ECF No. 597, at iii-iv. As Judge Belen noted, “a constant message” \nfrom his team’s community engagement was “that civilians overwhelmingly feel that they are not \nfree to leave even during a Level 1 encounter,” that “many investigative encounters quickly \nescalate into full blown Terry stops,” and that “impacted community members consistently \nexpressed a need to quantify” Level 1 and 2 encounters “so that appropriate monitoring and \nsupervision of them can occur.” Id. at 226, 230-31.  \n  At  the  urging  of  the  Plaintiffs  and  many  community  stakeholders,  Judge  Belen \nrecommended that the NYPD adopt a system that would contemporaneously and comprehensively \ndocument Level 1 and 2 encounters. See Declaration of Communities United for Police Reform \n(“CPR Decl.”) ¶¶ 14, 16, 18. Specifically, he recommended that the Court order the NYPD to \ncreate an application (“app”) for department-issued smartphones on which officers would record \n(i) the age, (ii) gender, and (iii) race of all persons they approach at either Level 1 or Level 2, and \n(iv) whether the encounter escalates to Level 3, and, using the phones’ location services, (v) the \ntime and (vi) location of each encounter. Id. at 231. Judge Belen explained that “the entry of these \ndata points on a pre-programed app could be accomplished in a matter of seconds, either at the \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 7 of 28\ntime or closely following an investigation of a crime scene,” and that the data collected for each \nencounter  “should  be  published  quarterly  and  annually,  disaggregated  by  demographic  and \ngeographic and precinct/command information,” which “would allow both the NYPD and the \npublic to observe and study trends in policing and enhance transparency and accountability around \nthe current state of SQF policy.” Id. at 232. More specifically, he emphasized that “collecting data \non the subjects of Level 1 and Level 2 encounters is essential to understanding, after controlling \nfor crime and other social factors, the extent to which police are initiating encounters on the basis \nof race,” and that it is “vital to take all necessary to steps to determine why” community perception \nof racial targeting has continued even with the significant decrease in the number of reported Level \n3 stops. Id. at 233. \n  In recommending the BWC recording of all Level 1 encounters, Judge Belen cited to the \nBWC policies of three large urban police departments—Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and \nChicago, the latter two of which have, like New York, been sued for racially-biased stop-and-frisk \npractices—which require the BWC recording of either “all law enforcement-related encounters” \nor “all contacts initiated pursuant to a law enforcement investigation.” Id. at 229-30 n. 270-272. \nHe also noted that the NYPD’s refusal to mandate BWC recording of all “Level 1 encounters that \nserve a law enforcement purpose” was “inconsistent with the findings in the Liability Opinion, the \nheightened need for transparency and accountability, and the acute importance of repairing the \nrelationship between the police and the communities that bore the brunt of the NYPD’s past \nunconstitutional practices.” Id at 230.  \n   The NYPD objected to both of Judge Belen’s recommendations, arguing that any benefits \nof documenting Level 1 and 2 encounters and BWC recording of Level 1 encounters would be \noutweighed by the burdens and costs of these policy changes. See ECF No. 603. Specifically, the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 8 of 28\nNYPD cited to the millions of calls for service it receives each year that it suggested could all \nresult in Level 1 investigative encounters which would be too burdensome and impractical for \nofficers to document and too technologically infeasible for them to record on BWCs. See ECF No. \n603 at 11-13. The NYPD also contended that the value of the information that would be collected \nthrough the documentation and BWC recording of Level 1 encounters was “highly questionable,” \n“limited,” and unlikely to further the NYPD’s compliance with the Court-ordered reforms or the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Id. at 11, 13.  \n  Plaintiffs and community stakeholders active in the JRP meanwhile agreed with both of \nJudge Belen’s recommendations but stated that his Level 1 and 2 documentation recommendation \ndid not go far enough, urging that the electronic form for documenting Level 1 and 2 encounters \nshould also include a section where officers would provide narrative descriptions of their reasons \nfor initiating the encounters they conduct. ECF No. 602 at 19.; ECF No. 611; CPR Decl. ¶ 16.  \nC.  The Court’s July 19 and August 9, 2018 Orders  \n \nRather than deciding these benefit, burden, and feasibility questions itself, the Court \nconcluded that each of Judge Belen’s two reform recommendations required “further study.” The \nCourt accordingly directed that each reform be piloted for a period of time to assess its relative \ncosts and benefits, after which the Monitor would report these cost-benefit findings to the Court, \nalong with, in the case of Level 1 and 2 documentation, his views on whether the reform should \nbe expanded or terminated. See ECF. No. 619 at 2-3; ECF No. 634 at 3.   \nD.   The Combined Pilot \n \n  The Combined Pilot proposal developed by the Monitor and approved by the Court on \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 9 of 28\nFebruary 7, 2019, see ECF No. 691,1 was designed to answer four questions, which directly address \nthe costs and benefits of each of the two recommended reforms: (1) How does requiring officers \nto document their Level 1 and 2 encounters and/or record their Level 1 encounters on BWCs affect \nthe legality of their conduct during Level 1 and 2 encounters and Level 3 Terry stops; (2)  How \ndoes requiring officers to document their Level 1 and 2 encounters and/or record their Level 1 \nencounters on BWCs affect their likelihood to document the Level 3 Terry stops they conduct; (3) \nWhat are the administrative workload and opportunity costs associated with officers documenting \nLevel  1  and  2  encounters  and  recording  Level  1  encounters  on  BWCs;  and  (4)  Would \ndocumentation of Level 1 and 2 encounters and BWC recordings of Level 1 encounters provide \nuseful data in assessing Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations. See ECF No. 687-1 at 1.  \n  Under the Combined Pilot, certain groups of NYPD officers would record all Level 1 \nencounters they conduct on BWCs and/or document all of their Level 1 and 2 encounters on a \nsmartphone app/electronic form that the NYPD agreed to develop, where officers would enter the \nfollowing categories of information for each Level 1 and 2 encounter: (i) officer name, (ii) officer \ncommand, (iii) date of encounter, (iv) location of encounter, (v) initial level of encounter (1-2), \n(vi) final level of encounter (1-4), (vii) gender, age, and race of the civilian, and (viii) a narrative \ndescription of the officer’s reasons for initiating the encounter. ECF No. 687-1 at 5, App’x 2.  \n  The primary research methodology which the Monitor team would use in conducting the \nCombined Pilot study, systematic social observation (“SSO”), would involve trained observers \nriding along with NYPD officers participating in the pilot, recording data on those officers’ \nconduct during the street encounters which the observers witness, and coding that data for analysis \n                                                 \n1 Prior to the Monitor’s development and submission of his Combined Pilot proposal to the Court in November 2018, \nFloyd Plaintiffs developed their own combined pilot proposal which they circulated to the City and the Monitor in \nSeptember 2018. However, it was rejected. See Declaration of Darius Charney in Opposition to the Monitor’s Motion \nto Vacate (“Charney Decl”) ¶¶ 4-5. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 10 of 28\nby the Monitor’s research team to help answer the four research questions discussed above. ECF \nNo. 687-1 at 1, 7, 10-11.  \nE.  The City’s Alternative Plan and the Monitor’s Proposed Studies  \n \n  In February 2020, before the Combined Pilot began and before the first COVID-19 case \nwas detected in New York City, Defendants wrote to the Monitor requesting to discontinue the \nCombined Pilot and proposing  the NYPD’s Alternative Plan for recording certain categories of \nLevel 1 encounters on BWCs and recording certain information about each Level 1 and 2 \nencounters captured on BWCs. See ECF No. 805-1 at page 2 of 9. In requesting to discontinue the \nCombined Pilot, the Defendants identified issues that they believed would make executing and \ndrawing conclusions from the pilot “difficult in the extreme,” including selection of participating \nprecincts, whether enough officers would volunteer to participate, and “significant safety and \nprivacy concerns raised by the presence of the [observers].” Id. at pages 2-3 of 9. The City did not \nraise  any  concerns  about  NYPD  officers  recording  all  Level  1  encounters  on  BWCs  or \ndocumenting all Level 1 and 2 encounters on a smartphone app/electronic form as the City had \npreviously agreed to do as part of the Monitor’s Combined Pilot proposal. Id.  \n  Nevertheless, Defendants proposed abandoning the Level 1 and 2 documentation and Level \n1 BWC recording protocols of the Combined Pilot in favor of recording some, but not all, \ncategories of Level 1 encounters on BWCs. One category that officers would not record under the \nAlternative Plan is certain Level 1 encounters involving investigations of past crimes. ECF No. \n805-1 at page 3 of 9.   \n  As for documenting information about each BWC-recorded Level 1 and 2 encounter, the \nNYPD has proposed foregoing a contemporaneous documentation via a smartphone app/electronic \nform and instead requiring officers to enter some, but not all, of the categories of encounter \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 11 of 28\ninformation previously included in the Monitor’s Combined Pilot proposal in two places: the \nevidence.com software associated with the BWCs worn by officers and officers’ electronic \nmemobooks. Specifically, for each Level 1 encounter recorded on a BWC, documentation would \ninclude: (i) the category of encounter (i.e., Level 1), (ii) the encounter date and time, (iii) the officer \nname, and (iv) the length of BWC video entered into evidence.com, while (v) the officer’s \ncommand, and (vi) the officer’s supervisor would be entered into the electronic memobook. ECF \nNo. 805-1 at pages 3-4 of 9.2 For each Level 2 encounter recorded on a BWC, the same categories \nof information as for Level 1 would be recorded, and (i) the race and gender of the civilian (with \ncategories chosen from drop-down menus), and (ii) whether the encounter involved more than one \ncivilian would also be entered into evidence com. See ECF No. 805-1 at page 6 of 9.  \n  The City’s Level 1 and 2 documentation proposal would not capture the race or gender of \nthe civilians in Level 1 encounters, the locations of Level 1 and 2 encounters, or narrative \nexplanations of the officers’ reasons for initiating Level 1 or 2 encounters. Moreover, the officer \nassignment/command and supervisor data entered in the electronic memobook for each Level 1 \nand 2 encounter could not be aggregated and statistically analyzed, nor could it be linked to the \ninformation for each encounter that is entered into evidence.com. Charney Decl. ¶ 10.  \n  Several  of  the  community  stakeholders  who  championed  the  comprehensive \ndocumentation of Level 1 and 2 encounters during the JRP met with the NYPD and the Monitor \nin April 2020 to express their concerns with these very omissions from the Alternative Plan and \nrequested that the NYPD incorporate the missing Level 1 and 2 information categories into the \n                                                 \n2 The Monitor’s motion to vacate inaccurately states that officer assignment and supervisor information will be \nautomatically entered into evidence.com. See ECF No. 805 at 7. However, the City’s February 21, 2020 letter to the \nMonitor outlining its Alternative Plan clearly states that those two data points would be entered into the officer’s \nelectronic memobook, not evidence.com. See ECF No. 805-1 at page 3 of 9.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 12 of 28\nAlternative Plan. See CPR Decl. ¶ 22. However, their concerns and requests are not reflected in \nthe Alternative Plan submitted to the Court.  \n  The Monitor’s Proposed Studies would not attempt to answer several questions related to \nthe relative costs and benefits of documenting Level 1 and 2 encounters which the Combined Pilot \ndid intend to address, including (1) the administrative burdens of documenting certain categories \nof information about Level 1 and 2 encounters in evidence.com, and (2) whether Level 1 and 2 \ndocumentation and BWC recordings of Level 1 encounters impacts the legality of officer conduct \nduring investigative street encounters. ECF Nos. 687-1 at 1; 805-2.  \nIII.  ARGUMENT \n \nA.  Legal Standard for a Motion to Vacate/Modify an Injunctive Relief Order  \n \nAs this Court has recognized, “[t]he power of a court of equity to modify a decree on \ninjunctive relief is long-established, broad, and flexible.” Floyd v. City of N.Y., 302 F.R.D. 69, 126 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 542 (2011)). This power is not without \nlimits, however, and a court abuses its discretion when vacatur or modification “thwarts the \npurpose behind the injunction.” Sierra Club v. United States Army Corps of Eng’rs, 732 F.2d 253, \n257 (2d Cir. 1984). \nIt is well-established that a district court has the power to modify its past injunctive decrees \nto account for changed circumstances. See, e.g., United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 391 \nU.S. 244, 248-49 (1968); Sys. Fed’n No. 91, Railway Emps.’ Dept’t v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 646-\n48 (1961) (“a sound judicial discretion may call for the modification of the terms of an injunctive \ndecree if the circumstances, whether of law or fact, obtaining at the time of its issuance have \nchanged, or new ones have since arisen”); United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 114 (1932) \n(“continuing decree of injunction directed to events to come is subject always to adaptation as \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 13 of 28\nevents may shape the need”); New York State Ass’n for Retarded Children v. Parisi, 706 F.2d 956, \n967 (2d Cir. 1983). However, “ a court should [also] keep the public interest in mind in ruling on \na request to modify based on a change in conditions.\" Id. “When a constitutional violation has been \nestablished, the defendant does not shoulder its burden at the remedy stage merely by coming \nforward with a plan. The defendant must come forward with a plan that promises realistically to \nwork, and promises realistically to work now.” United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 29 F.3d 40, \n43 (2d Cir. 1994) (emphasis in original, quotations and citations omitted) (holding district court \ndid not abuse its discretion by rejecting those aspects of the defendant’s plan it found ineffectual). \nThe Court-appointed Monitor asks this Court to vacate the Court-ordered Combined Pilot \nin favor of the City’s Alternative Plan and the Monitor’s Proposed Studies because “the COVID-\n19 pandemic has made the Combined Pilot inadvisable and the alternative program proposed here \noffers a suitable substitute.” ECF No. 805 at 13. While changed circumstances due to the COVID-\n19 pandemic may justify the departure from the Combined Pilot’s SSO research methodology, \nwith observers riding along with officers during their tours, these circumstances have not changed \nthe purpose of or need for the Combined Pilot. The City’s recommendation to abandon the \nCombined Pilot in favor of its Alternative Plan predates the COVID-19 pandemic and the related \nlimitations to successful execution of an SSO study. See ECF No 805-1 at 2-4. The Alternative \nPlan  and  Proposed  Studies  are  not  adequate  substitutes  for  the  Combined  Pilot,  absent \ndocumentation of the race of individuals stopped at Level 1, locations of Level 1 and 2 encounters, \nencounter escalation, and narratives created by officers detailing the reasons for the  encounters at \nLevels 1 and 2. The Monitor’s proposal would thwart the purpose of the Combined Pilot and the \nCourt’s July 18 and  August 8, 2018 Orders,  namely  studying the benefits and burdens of \ncomprehensively recording and documenting Level 1 and 2 encounters. For these reasons and \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 14 of 28\nthose argued herein, this Court should not vacate the entirety of the Combined Pilot or approve the \nAlternative Plan or Proposed Studies in their current form. \nB.  The Monitor Seeks to Vacate All Three of the Court’s Prior Pilot Orders \n \n    While the Monitor’s motion states that he is only requesting that the Court vacate its \nFebruary 7, 2019 Order approving the Combined Pilot, see ECF No. 805 at 1, 20, replacing the \nCombined Pilot with the Alternative Plan and Proposed Studies would also effectively vacate the \nCourt’s July 19 and August 9, 2018 Pilot Orders. See ECF Nos. 619, 634. Those two orders \nmandated  the  piloting  of  Judge  Belen’s  recommendations  of  comprehensive  electronic \ndocumentation of all Level 1 and 2 encounters and BWC recording of all Level 1 encounters to \nassess these two reforms’ relative costs, benefits, and feasibility so that the Court could determine \nif the NYPD should implement them department-wide. ECF No. 619 at 2-3; ECF No. 634 at 3. \nThe Monitor now seeks to bypass piloting either of Judge Belen’s recommended reforms and get \nCourt approval for NYPD department-wide implementation of Level 1 and 2 documentation and \nBWC recording protocols that are much narrower than what the Court originally ordered to be \npiloted. See ECF. Nos. 805-1; 805-2 at pages 9-12 of 28. Thus, in analyzing the present motion, \nthe Court must determine if the Monitor has met the standard for vacatur or modification of all \nthree of the Court’s prior Pilot Orders, which, as described below, he clearly has not. \nC.  The COVID-19 Pandemic is no Reason to Abandon the Combined Pilot Entirely \nor to Adopt the City’s Alternative Plan Order  \n \nThe only reason the Monitor gives for foregoing the Combined Pilot altogether and \nreplacing it with the City’s Alternative Plan and the Proposed Studies is the COVID-19 pandemic. \nSee ECF No. 805 at 13. While the pandemic undoubtedly makes the Combined Pilot’s SSO \nresearch methodology infeasible to conduct safely, it in no way impacts NYPD officers’ ability to \nelectronically document all of the data points for Level 1 and 2 encounters listed in the Combined \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 15 of 28\nPilot proposal or to record all law enforcement-related Level 1 encounters on BWCs. See ECF No. \n687-1 at 5, App’x. 2. Moreover, given the NYPD’s significant and ongoing problems with \nunreported and racially disparate Level 3 Terry stops described by the Monitor, see ECF No. 795-\n1 at 20-23, 83-84, 85-86, the need to assess whether Judge Belen’s Level 1 and 2 documentation \nand  Level  1  BWC  reform  recommendations  can  help  address  these  problems—which  the \nCombined pilot was expressly designed to do, see ECF No. 687-1 at 1—has never been greater. \nD.  Replacing the Combined Pilot with the City’s Alternative Plan Would Thwart \nthe Purpose of the Court’s Prior Pilot Orders and Run Counter to the Strong \nPublic Interest in Transparency Around Level 1 and 2 Encounters  \n \nAs discussed above, the Court ordered the piloting of two JRP reforms recommended by \nJudge  Belen  and  prioritized  by  Plaintiffs  and  community  stakeholders—  comprehensive \ndocumentation of Level 1 and 2 encounters and BWC recording of all Level 1 encounters—\nspecifically to assess their benefits, costs, and feasibility before deciding whether the NYPD \nshould implement them on a department-wide basis. See ECF No. 619 at 2-3; ECF No. 634 at 3; \nECF No. 687-1 at 1; ECF No. 691 at 2. Yet, contrary to the Monitor’s characterization, the \nAlternative Plan does not “meaningfully achieve” this purpose. ECF No. 805 at 14. Instead, as \ndescribed below, replacing the Combined Pilot with the Alternative Plan will eliminate significant \nelements of these two reforms before their costs, benefits, and feasibility have even been assessed, \nthus thwarting the primary purpose of the Court’s July 19, 2018, August 9, 2018 and February 7, \n2019 Pilot Orders and seriously undermining what community stakeholders identified as critical \nstop-and-frisk transparency reforms during the JRP. \n1.  No BWC Recording of Level 1’s Conducted in Response to Radio Calls about Past \nCrimes  \n \n  First, the Monitor proposes adopting the City’s Alternative Plan not to record on BWC’s \nLevel 1 encounters conducted in response to radio calls regarding past crimes. The JRP’s final \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 16 of 28\nreport recognized the trend in most large city police departments—including in cities where stop \nand frisk practices have been litigated—is to record all law enforcement-related encounters with \ncivilians. See JRP, Final Report, ECF No. 597 at 229. Judge Belen concluded that any policy that \ndid not require recording of all Level 1 encounters that “serve a law enforcement purpose” would \nbe “inconsistent with the findings in the Liability Opinion, the heightened need for transparency \nand accountability, and the acute importance of repairing the relationship between the police and \nthe communities that bore the brunt of the NYPD’s past unconstitutional practices.” Id. Deciding \nnot to record Level 1 encounters involving investigation of past crimes, which doubtless “serve a \nlaw enforcement purpose,” defies current best practices and the purposes of the Liability Order. \n  The decision to exclude these stops from recording is also arbitrary and is not supported \nby evidence that this category of Level 1 encounters account for “a small percentage of first level \nencounters.” See Monitor’s Motion, ECF No. 805 at 14. If anything, this assertion suggests that \nthe burden of recording and documenting these stops, which are apparently rare, would be low. \nBut Plaintiffs are also unaware of any evidence that reflects the percentage of Level 1 encounters \nthat involve investigation of past crimes.  \nMoreover, a decision not to record Level 1 stops involving investigation of past crimes \ndeprives the Parties and the Monitor of information about a category of Level 1 encounters that \nmay  be  particularly  important  to  assessing  the  constitutionality  of  officer  behavior  during \ninvestigative encounters. Declining to record Level 1 encounters arising from investigation of past \ncrimes may exclude police encounters with civilians resulting from calls for service placed by a \nthird party. If police encounters with witnesses who did not themselves call police for service are \nclassified as investigations of past crimes, rather than independent Level 1 encounters, they would \nnot be recorded under the alternative plan.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 17 of 28\nPlaintiffs cannot anticipate each potential encounter that might be exempted from recording \nrequirements because it involves investigation of past crimes, but the recent tragic police shooting \nof Antonio Williams is an illustrative example. The NYPD has not explained why officers \napproached Mr. Williams on September 29, 2019, but NYPD communications indicate that a \nshooting had taken place three days earlier in the public housing complex where Mr. Williams was \nstanding, waiting for a cab. Police officers approached Mr. Williams, perhaps to ask whether he \nhad information about the recent shooting. Mr. Williams fled from police, as is permitted at Level \n1. The police nonetheless pursued him, leading to a struggle and shooting resulting in the death of \nMr. Williams and an NYPD officer. See 47 Precinct Officer Involved Shooting September 29, \n2019 (Dec. 13, 2019) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EQ3hzZ5EIY; see also, Williams v. \nCity of New York, et al., Index No. 34180/2020E (Bronx Cty. Sup. Ct.). If NYPD officers indeed \ndid approach Mr. Williams to investigate a past crime in the area, this Level 1 encounter escalated \nquickly and became fatal, and is emblematic of the type of encounter that warrants study in this \npilot.  \n2.  BWC Metadata is Less Accurate and More Burdensome to Enter than an Electronic \nReport/Smartphone App \n \nThe Monitor’s own experts note in their summary of the Proposed Studies that collecting \ndata on Level 2 encounters in an electronic report like the current report for Level 3 Terry stops, \nwhich is accessible through NYPD officers’ smartphones, is preferable to using the metadata from \nBWC videos of those encounters, as contemplated by the Alternative Plan, because that metadata \nis potentially less reliable in certain important respects. Specifically, a BWC metadata-based \nsystem like evidence.com “will often contain multiple records of the same encounter because each \nofficer present [at the encounter] will activate their camera,” potentially causing an inflated count \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 18 of 28\nof the actual number of Level 1 and 2 encounters conducted by NYPD officers. ECF No. 805-2 at \npage 6 of 28. \nMoreover, the documentation of Level 1 and 2 encounters through the evidence.com \nplatform that would take place under the Alternative Plan is potentially more burdensome and \ntime-consuming for officers than documenting these encounters on a smartphone-based electronic \nreport app as envisioned by the Combined Pilot. As Plaintiffs’ BWC technological expert Harlan \nYu has explained, while the electronic report app could easily be designed to enable an officer to \ncomplete it very quickly on their phone while in the field—which was Judge Belen’s expectation—\nit is not at all clear whether NYPD officers can even access the evidence.com platform from their \nsmartphones or must instead log on to a computer terminal back at the precinct house at the end \nof their tour to enter the required metadata categories into evidence.com. See Declaration of Harlan \nYu (“Yu Decl.”) ¶¶ 10, 15, 24.  \n3.  No Data on Encounter Escalation \n \n    Contrary to the Level 1 and 2 documentation protocols for the Combined Pilot, see ECF \nNo. 687-1 at 5, App’x 2, the Alternative Plan would only permit officers to enter one category (or \nDe Bour level) for each recorded Level 1 and 2 encounter in evidence.com, see ECF No. 805-1 at \npages 3-4 of 9, thus preventing the NYPD from collecting and analyzing aggregate data on Level \n1 and 2 encounters that escalate to higher levels, as recommended by Judge Belen. As Judge Belen \nexplained in recommending that officers document both the initial and final levels of their \ninvestigative encounters, collecting data on Level 1 and 2 encounters that escalate to higher De \nBour levels is useful for “determining whether officers are confusing the De Bour levels and/or \nimproperly escalating Level 1 and Level 2 encounters into Terry stops.” ECF No. 597 at 235. \nDocumenting this additional data point would likely place little to no additional burden on officers, \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 19 of 28\nas it could be accomplished by adding a second category field with a drop-down menu of the De \nBour levels (1-4) to either the electronic report phone app or evidence.com, which officers could \ncomplete in a matter of seconds. See Yu Decl. ¶ 22, Ex. B. \n    Without documenting this additional data point, the only way to obtain information on \nLevel 1 and 2 encounters that escalate would be to review individual BWC recordings, which \nwould be much too time-consuming to allow review of enough videos to regularly analyze \nDepartment-wide patterns in the escalation of Level 1 and 2 encounters.3 Such a scheme would \nalso eliminate any meaningful contemporaneous review by supervisors, which is essential to \nensuring the NYPD’s compliance with constitutional safeguards. Thus, at minimum, the NYPD \nshould pilot the documentation of both the initial and final De Bour levels of investigative \nencounters that begin at Level 1 or 2 to determine if this documentation will in fact provide the \nkind of useful information that Judge Belen predicted.  \n4.  No Data on Civilian Race in Level 1 Encounters  \n \n  In recommending comprehensive documentation at Level 1 and 2 encounters, Judge Belen \nreasoned that “collecting data on the subjects of Level 1 and Level 2 encounters is essential to \nunderstanding, after controlling for crime and other social factors, the extent to which police are \ninitiating encounters on the basis of race.” ECF No. 597 at 233. The Court in turn cited this \nreasoning in its July 19, 2018 Order mandating the piloting of Judge Belen’s recommendation to \nassess its relative benefits, costs, and feasibility. See ECF No. 619 at 2.  \n                                                 \n3 The limitations of this kind of review are further illustrated by the Monitor’s Proposed Studies, in which his team of \nresearchers will conduct a lengthy review of BWC recordings to locate encounters for the studies’ escalation analysis, \nbecause, as described in the study proposals, it is not clear that this review will even identify any encounters which \nbegan at Level 1 and then escalated. See ECF No. 805-2 at page 4 of 28. In addition, this review will ultimately result \nonly in a sample of 2500 videos on total. Id.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 20 of 28\n  Yet, the Monitor, in defending the Alternative Plan’s omission of data on the race of \ncivilians in Level 1 encounters, concludes without having conducted any such assessment that “the \nburdens of that documentation outweigh the benefits.” ECF No. 805 at 15. The Monitor parrots \nthe  very  argument  the  City  made  in  opposing  Judge  Belen’s  Level  1  documentation \nrecommendation in 2018: because the millions of calls for service the NYPD answers each year \ncould all result in Level 1 encounters, it would not be feasible or manageable for officers to collect \nthis data for every Level 1 encounter they conduct. See ECF No. 613 at 12; ECF No. 805 at 16. \nThis argument did not convince the Court to reject Judge Belen’s recommendation outright in \n2018, and no developments over the past two years have made it more convincing now. In fact, \nupon close examination, this burden claim seems exaggerated. Even if NYPD officers answer 9 \nmillion calls for service each year, with approximately 24,000 NYPD officers assigned to patrol \nfunctions and accounting for the fact that two officers answer each call, that averages out to about \n750 calls per officer per year or, assuming 20 tours per officer per month, just over 3 calls (and \npotential Level 1 encounters) per officer each day. Moreover, entry of information regarding a \ncivilian’s race for a Level 1 encounter in either the electronic report phone app or evidence.com \ncould be accomplished in a matter of seconds using a data category field with a drop-down menu \nof demographic categories (e.g. Black, white, Latinx, Asian-Pacific Islander, etc.), which is \nprecisely what the Alternative Plan already envisions officers doing for Level 2 encounters. See \nECF No. 805-1 at page 6 of 9; see also Yu Decl. ¶ 15. \n  As for benefits, the Monitor argues that recording race data for Level 1 encounters would \n“not yield useful information for Fourteenth Amendment analysis” because it is not possible to \nconstruct “an appropriate benchmark” needed to determine whether “more Black people were \nencountered than should have been encountered” at Level 1. ECF No. 805 at 16. The Monitor \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 21 of 28\nreasons that “with so many different kinds of encounters with the shared label of Level 1. . . there \nis no standard for determining who ‘should have been’ encountered assuming there was no \ndiscrimination,” and that unlike for Level 3 Terry Stops, where “the benchmark used is based on \nthe legal framework of reasonable suspicion,” for Level 1 encounters, “there is no way to identify \nthe relevant population for whom an officer might have an objective credible reason to approach.” \nId. at 16-17.  \n  However, the Monitor fails to mention one very important category of Level 1 encounters \nwhich his own team thinks is important enough to analyze for racial disparities as part of the \nProposed Studies: Level 1 encounters which escalate to Level 2 or 3. See ECF No. 805-2 at 10-11 \nof 28 (“[W]e will examine whether Level 1 or 2 encounters escalate more often if the citizen is \nblack or Hispanic and whether there are racial disparities in the compliance rate of escalated \nencounters.”). Since the legal standards for Level 2 and 3 encounters are “founded suspicion” and \n“reasonable suspicion” of criminal activity, respectively, there is a benchmark which the Court has \nalready recognized as appropriate for this kind of racial disparity analysis: NYPD data on reported \ncrimes. See ECF No. 373 at 49-58.  \n  Thus, if combined with the encounter escalation data discussed above, data on the race of \npeople encountered at Level 1 could provide a useful tool for assessing whether NYPD officers’ \nconduct  during  investigative  encounters  complies  with  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  Such  a \npotentially important benefit clearly merits the NYPD at least piloting the documentation of \ncivilian race in Level 1 encounters going forward. \n5.  No Documentation of Geographic Locations of Level 1 or 2 Encounters \n \n    The Monitor’s motion does not acknowledge that the Alternative Plan would also not \ninclude documentation on the geographic locations of Level 1 and 2 encounters, a data point that \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 22 of 28\nwas included in both Judge Belen’s recommendation and the Combined Pilot. See ECF No. 597 at \n231; ECF No. 687-1 at 5. App’x 2. Here again, the potential benefits and technological feasibility \nof collecting this data with minimal burden on officers supports, at minimum, piloting the \ndocumentation of this information for all Level 1 and 2 encounters. The utility of this information \nfor assessing Fourteenth Amendment compliance is clearly illustrated by the Court’s Fourteenth \nAmendment analysis in its Liability Opinion in this case, which found, after controlling for crime \nrates, significant disparities in the level of Terry stop activity between predominantly white and \npredominantly Black and Latinx neighborhoods of New York City and that Black and Latinx \npedestrians were more likely than white pedestrians to be stopped even in racially-mixed and \npredominantly white areas of the City. ECF No. 373 at 59-60. \n    In addition, Plaintiffs’ policing technology expert Harlan Yu notes that the geolocation \nfunctionality of NYPD officers’ smartphones would allow accurate encounter location information \nto  be  automatically  entered  into  the  electronic  report  smartphone app,  and  the  geolocation \nfunctionality of the Axon AB-2 and AB-3 BWCs that NYPD officers will begin using exclusively \nin the first half of 2021 would similarly allow location information to be automatically uploaded \nas metadata to evidence.com. Yu Decl. ¶¶ 13-14, 19-21; Charney Decl. ¶ 8. Under either platform, \nthe encounter location data would be entered in a format that would allow it to be aggregated and \nstatistically analyzed, as Judge Belen recommended. Yu Decl. ¶¶ 19-20, Ex. B; ECF No. 597 at \n231-32. \n    Meanwhile, the officer assignment (precinct) data that would be collected for each Level 1 \nand 2 encounter under the Alternative Plan is not at all an adequate substitute for location data for \ntwo reasons. First, NYPD precincts encompass very large geographic areas that include many \nneighborhoods with differing demographic characteristics and levels of police activity. Second, \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 23 of 28\nthis assignment/precinct data will be entered into officers’ electronic memobooks in a format that \ndoes not allow for aggregation and statistical analysis and, because of security concerns, cannot \nlink to the other encounter information contained in evidence.com. Charney Decl. ¶ 10. Thus, \nunder the Alternative Plan, the NYPD would be unable to even track the number of Level 1 and 2 \nencounters by precinct or compare the racial disparities in those encounters in one precinct with \nthe disparities in another, making it difficult, if not impossible to “observe and study trends in \npolicing and enhance transparency and accountability around the current state of SQF policy.” \nECF No. 597 at 233.  \n6.  No Narrative Explanations of Officers’ Reasons for Initiating Level 2 Encounters \n \n  Unlike the Combined Pilot, the proposed Alternative Plan also lacks a requirement that \nofficers record a narrative reflecting the reasons for conducting Level 1 and 2 encounters. The \nCombined Pilot anticipated SSO research, with observers riding along with police and writing \ndetailed narratives of police encounters with civilians. While Plaintiffs agree that it is not currently \nfeasible for observers to have extensive in-person contact with officers given the public health \nemergency, the narrative element is essential to measuring compliance, especially regarding \ncompliance with the Fourth Amendment, and to provide for meaningful supervisory review. As \nwritten, the Alternative Plan does not require any documentation by the officer for the reason for \ninitiating Level 1 or 2 encounters. Accordingly, it will be impossible for Plaintiffs and the \nMonitor’s Proposed Studies to assess the legality of stops and the extent to which unlawful stops \nare occurring. Indeed, it is unclear how the Proposed Studies could assess “the key reasons for \nofficers’ failure to comply with legal requirements” without knowing the stated reason for officers’ \nlow-level encounters. See ECF No. 805 at 8. Even if these encounters are recorded with a BWC, \nthe lack of documentation of the reason for the encounter allows for ex-post facto justification of \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 24 of 28\nunlawful behavior. Officers must already inform stopped persons of the reason for a Level 2 \nencounter. Apart from the City’s premature and unsupported claims, there is no indication that \nrequiring  officers  to  take  the  additional  step  of  documenting  that  information  for  Level  2 \nencounters would be excessively burdensome. \n  Lastly, as Dr. Yu points, out documenting these narratives in evidence.com could be \naccomplished easily through the creation of a free-form text custom metadata field. See Yu Decl. \n¶ 24, Ex. 2.   \n7.  No Procedures for Regular Supervisory Review of the Legality of Officers’ Level 1 \nand 2 Encounters \n   \nThe Alternative Plan also does not require supervisory review of officers’ Level 1 and 2 \nencounters, meaning that there will be no ability to track discipline or interventions with respect \nto officers who regularly conduct unlawful Level 1 and 2 stops. Supervision, monitoring, and \ndiscipline were essential elements of the Court’s Liability Opinion. See ECF No. 597 at 63. The \nCourt specifically found that NYPD failed to provide an adequate mechanism for supervisory \nreview of unconstitutional stops. ECF No. 373 at 108 of 198 (“Consequently, the NYPD is unable \nto hold officers accountable for those stops or prevent them from happening in the future.”). \nSupervisory review of low-level encounters, and appropriate discipline following improper stops, \nare at the core of the Liability Order and cannot be omitted from a pilot program. \nE.  The Alternative Plan and Proposed Studies Should Not Replace the Combined \nPilot Unless They are Significantly Modified  \n \nAs the preceding sections make clear, replacing the Combined Pilot with the City’s \nAlternative Plan as currently constructed would thwart the purpose not only of the Combined Pilot \nitself, but also the Court’s July 19 and August 9, 2018 Orders. Accordingly, if the Court is still \ninclined to cancel the Combined Pilot altogether, it should also order that the Alternative Plan be \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 25 of 28\nmodified in several significant respects, that this modified Alternative Plan be piloted in the NYPD \nfor a period of time, and that the Monitor use his Proposed Studies to assess the relative costs, \nburdens,  and  feasibility  of  the  modified  Alternative  Plan  and  report  the  findings  of  those \nassessments to the Court.  \n1.  Proposed Modifications to the Alternative Plan \n \n    In order for the Alternative Plan to be consistent with Judge Belen’s recommendations for \ncomprehensive documentation of Level 1 and 2 encounters and BWC recording of Level 1 \nencounters and thus meet the goals of the Court’s July 19 and August 9, 2018 Pilot Orders, it must \nbe modified as follows: \na.  The list of Level 1 categories subject to mandatory BWC recording must be \nexpanded to include Level 1 encounters conducted in response to radio runs related \nto reports of past crimes (i.e., “10-20 series”); \nb.  The electronic documentation of Level 1 and 2 encounters must be expanded to \ninclude the following additional categories of information: \ni.  Race and gender of civilians in Level 1 encounters; \nii.  Data on the  geographic locations  of Level 1 and 2 encounters, to be \nautomatically  supplied  by  the  geolocation  services  of  the  officers’ \nsmartphone, BWC, or BWC paired to the smartphone; \niii.  Both the De Bour Levels at which the encounter began and ended; \niv.  For Level 2 encounters, a narrative description of the officers’ reasons for \ninitiating the encounter if it began at Level 2 or for escalating the encounter \nif it began at Level 1; and \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 26 of 28\nv.  The  officer  assignment/command  information  for  each  Level  1  and  2 \nencounter should be entered into the same platform as the categories of \ninformation documented for each encounter, i.e. either evidence.com or the \nelectronic report smartphone app.  \nc.  Level 1 and 2 documentation should be piloted with two separate groups of officers \non  two  separate  platforms,  (i)  evidence.com  and  (ii)  the  electronic  report \nsmartphone app that the NYPD was developing for the Combined Pilot, to compare \nthe relative ease of use (for officers and reviewing supervisors) and data accuracy \nof the two platforms. \nd.  The NYPD must establish protocols for regular supervisory review (i.e. review by \nline supervisors or other supervisors in the same command) of officers’ documented \nLevel 1 and 2 encounters. \n2.  Piloting the Modified Alternative Plan and Assessing its Costs, Benefits, and \nFeasibility Through the Proposed Studies  \n \n    The modified Alternative Plan described above should be piloted for a period of time, e.g. \n6-12 months, with at least two groups of NYPD officers: (i) one group that will document their \nLevel 1 and 2 encounters on the electronic report smartphone app, and (ii) one group that will \ndocument their Level 1 and 2 encounters on evidence.com. The Monitor should use his Proposed \nStudies, with slight modifications discussed below, to assess the costs, benefits, and feasibility of \nthe modified Alternative Plan.  \n    In order to assess the costs, benefits, and feasibility of the modified Alternative Plan, the \nProposed Studies should be modified as follows: \na.  The Proposed Studies’ research questions should be modified as follows: \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 27 of 28\ni.  The  “Documentation”  research  question  in  the  ISLG  study  should  be \namended to examine whether both expansion of mandatory BWC recording \nto most Level 1 encounters and documentation of Level 1 and 2 encounters \nincrease the number of Level 3 encounters that are reported.  \nii.  The Proposed Studies should also include research questions similar to \nthose in the Combined Pilot which examine (a) whether documentation of \nLevel 1 and 2 encounters and BWC recording of Level 1 encounters affect \nthe legality of officer conduct during Level 2 and 3 encounters, (b) the \nadministrative  workload  and  opportunity  costs  associated  with \ncomprehensive documentation of Level 1 and 2 encounters, and (c) whether \ndocumentation of Level 1 and 2 encounters and BWC recordings of Level \n1  encounters  provide  useful  data  for  assessing  officers’  Fourth  and \nFourteenth Amendment compliance during investigative encounters. See \nECF No. 687-1 at 1.  \n      b.  The Proposed Studies should expand their data sources to include the data from the \nelectronic  documentation  of  Level  1  and  2  encounters  under  the  modified \nAlternative Plan.  \n      At the conclusion of the Proposed Studies, the Monitor should report to the Court on the \nrelative benefits and costs of the modified Alternative Plan and whether it should be terminated or \nexpanded department-wide within the NYPD.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n \n    For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs request that the Court deny the Monitor’s motion, \nECF No. 805, in full, or, in the alternative, that it (i) vacate its February 7, 2019 Order approving \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 809   Filed 12/23/20   Page 28 of 28\nthe Combined Pilot, ECF No. 691, (ii) modify the City’s proposed Alternative Plan as described \nabove, (iii) order that a pilot of the modified Alternative Plan shall replace the Combined Pilot, \nand (iv) direct the Monitor to submit for Court approval by a date certain a proposal for using the \nMonitor’s Proposed Studies to assess relative costs and benefits of the modified Alternative Plan.  \n \nDated: December 23, 2020 \n  New York, New York \n \n                    Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n\\s\\ Darius Charney \nCENTER FOR CONSTITUTIONAL \nRIGHTS \nBy: Darius Charney \n       Samah Sisay \n666 Broadway, 7th Floor \nNew York, NY 10012 \nTel.

Local Rule 13(a),1 and by a series of media \n                                                           \n1 In a proceeding on December 21, 2007 involving the parties in Daniels v. City of New York, No. 99 Civ. \n1695 (S.D.N.Y. filed Mar. 8, 1999), the District Judge stated, “[I]f you got proof of inappropriate racial profiling in \na good constitutional case, why don’t you bring a lawsuit? You can certainly mark it as related.” She also stated, \n“[W]hat I am trying to say, I am sure I am going to get in trouble for saying it, for $65 you can bring that lawsuit.” \nShe concluded the proceeding by noting, “And as I said before, I would accept it as a related case, which the \nplaintiff has the power to designate.” Two of the attorney groups working on behalf of plaintiffs in Daniels, a case \n2 \n \n \n\nCase: 13-3088     Document: 243     Page: 3      10/31/2013      1080946      3\ninterviews and public statements purporting to respond publicly to criticism of the District \nCourt.2   \n \nAccordingly, we conclude that, in the interest, and appearance, of fair and impartial \nadministration of justice, UPON REMAND, these cases shall be assigned to a different District \nJudge, chosen randomly under the established practices of the District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York. This newly-designated District Judge shall implement this Court’s \nmandate staying all proceedings and otherwise await further action by the Court of Appeals on \nthe merits of the ongoing appeals. \n   \nIn taking these actions, we intimate no view on the substance or merits of the pending \nappeals, which have yet to be fully briefed and argued. \n \nThe mandate shall ISSUE FORTHWITH for the sole purpose of implementation of this \nOrder and shall otherwise remain in this Court.  \n     \nIn the interest of judicial economy, any question, application, or further appeal regarding \nthe scope of this Order or its implementation shall be directed to this panel, which will hear the \ncase on the merits in due course.   \n   \n \n            FOR THE COURT: \n            Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk       \n \n  \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nchallenging the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practices, helped file Floyd the next month.

\nexploring a full resolution of the cases.”  Dkt. 459 at 2 ¶ 2.  Specifically, the City, \nwith the consent of plaintiffs, requests that the Court remand the cases to the \nDistrict Court “for 45 days to permit the parties to explore a resolution.”  Id. ¶ 5.   \nThe City believes that such a resolution is possible and desirable, and that the \npublic interest strongly favors this result.  Dkt. 467 at 2 ¶ 6.  The police unions \noppose that request and contend that they should be granted leave to intervene \nand, if necessary, continue the appeal to protect collective bargaining interests \nand to contest findings by the District Court the unions believe to be \nunwarranted.   \nWith respect to a motion to intervene at the appellate stage of a case, we \nhave noted that while there is authority for granting such a motion, it is generally \npreferable that the decision be made first by the district court.  See Drywall Tapers \n& Pointers of Greater N.Y., Local Union 1974 of I.U.P.T., AFL‐CIO v. Natasi Assocs., \n488 F.3d 88, 94 (2d Cir. 2007).  \n  Here, the proposed intervenors moved to intervene in the District Court.  \nThose motions have not been adjudicated.  In the circumstances presented here, \nwe believe it preferable that the motions be addressed there in the first instance, \n7 \n \n\nCCaassee:

\nparticularly because the appropriateness of intervention and the form it takes \ncould well bear on settlement negotiations.  Moreover, the District Court is better \npositioned to deal with the complexities that might arise during multi‐faceted \nsettlement negotiations in which a variety of interests must be accommodated.  \nFinally, if necessary, the District Court may hold hearings and take evidence in \norder to provide this Court with a more complete record for any further review \nthat might be sought.  \nCONCLUSION \nAccordingly, the City’s motion is hereby GRANTED.  Although the City \nrequested remand for a period of 45 days, to the extent settlement negotiations \nremain fruitful, the District Court may extend the remand period for such \nadditional reasonable time as would be helpful to achieving a resolution. \nInsofar as the Court’s Order of October 31, 2013, and the Order of \nNovember 13, 2013 that superseded it, stayed proceedings in the District Court, \nthey are hereby VACATED and the cause is REMANDED to the District Court \nfor the purpose of supervising settlement discussions among such concerned or \ninterested parties as the District Court deems appropriate, and resolving the \n8 \n \n\nCCaassee:

As a result, two motions are now \nbefore this Court. \nIn the first motion, the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association of the City of New York, \nInc., the Detectives’ Endowment Association, Inc., the NYPD Captains Endowment Association, \nand the Lieutenants Benevolent Association of the City of New York, Inc., collectively, and the \nSergeants Benevolent Association,1 separately, move to intervene as defendants pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 for the purposes of (1) appealing three orders issued by the \n                         \n1 The Sergeants Benevolent Association moves to intervene only in Floyd; the other unions move \nto intervene in Floyd and Ligon. \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 2 of 108\nHonorable Shira A. Scheindlin:  (a) the first, enjoining the City of New York (the “City”) from \nconducting trespass stops outside of certain Bronx apartment buildings without reasonable \nsuspicion of trespass in Ligon; (b) the second, finding the City liable for violating the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendment rights of the plaintiff class in Floyd; and (c) the third, ordering remedies \nin Floyd and Ligon; (2) participating in the settlement of Floyd and Ligon; and (3) participating \nin the remedial phase of the litigation.  Because their motions raise identical issues, the Court \naddresses them together, referring to all of the proposed intervenors collectively as the “Unions” \nand noting variations only where relevant.  The Floyd and Ligon plaintiffs are collectively \nreferred to as “Plaintiffs.”  Plaintiffs and the City oppose the Unions’ intervention.2 \n  In the second motion, Plaintiffs and the City, having reached an agreement to resolve the \nCity’s appeals in Floyd and Ligon, move for an order modifying the remedies order pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 and the Court’s inherent authority, such that the term of the \ncourt-appointed monitor is limited to three years, provided that the City shows substantial \ncompliance with its obligations by the end of that term. \nThe motions to intervene are DENIED for three reasons:  (1) the motions are untimely; \n(2) the Unions have no significant protectable interests relating to the subject of the litigation that \nwould warrant intervention; and (3) even if their alleged interests were cognizable, the Unions \nlack standing to vindicate those interests on appeal. \nThe parties’ motion for an order modifying the remedies order is GRANTED.  The \nmodifications shall be set forth in a separate order to be issued forthwith.  The Unions’ request to \nparticipate in the settlement of Floyd and Ligon is, therefore, DENIED as moot. \nThe Unions’ request to participate in the remedial phase of Floyd is also DENIED as \n                         \n2 Although the City initially consented to the Unions’ September 2013 motions to intervene, see \nFloyd, ECF No. 414; Ligon, ECF No. 152, it now opposes them, see Floyd, ECF No. 447; Ligon, \nECF No. 180. \n \n2\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 3 of 108\nmoot because the remedies order already offers “police organizations” the opportunity to \nparticipate in the development of reforms to NYPD stop-and-frisk policies and procedures \nthrough the “Joint Remedial Process.”  The Unions’ request to participate in the remedial phase \nof Ligon is DENIED for the same reasons the Court denies their motion to intervene for the \npurpose of appealing the remedies order. \nBACKGROUND \nNearly fifty years have passed since the Supreme Court of the United States endorsed the \npractice that became known as “stop-and-frisk.”  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30-31 (1968).  \nThere, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and \nseizures is not violated when a police officer stops, questions, and frisks a suspect without \nprobable cause if the officer has reasonable suspicion that “criminal activity may be afoot” or a \nreasonable belief that the person “may be armed and presently dangerous.”  Id. at 30.  In the \ndecades since, the contours of Terry’s exception to probable cause have been vigorously litigated \nin the courts.   \nIn this current iteration, two sets of plaintiffs challenge the legality of the New York City \nPolice Department’s (the “NYPD”) stop-and-frisk tactics.  In Ligon, after a seven-day \nevidentiary hearing, on January 8, 2013, the Court issued a preliminary injunction against the \nCity, finding that plaintiffs would likely succeed in proving that the City has a policy of \nstopping, frisking, and arresting persons for trespass based primarily on their presence in or near \nBronx apartment buildings enrolled in the Trespass Affidavit Program (“TAP”)—which permits \nthe NYPD to patrol private buildings with their owners’ consent—in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment (the “Injunction Order”).  Ligon v. City of New York, 925 F. Supp. 2d 478, 486 \n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2013), amending and superseding, Ligon v. City of New York, 12 Civ. 2274, \n \n3\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 4 of 108\n2013 WL 71800 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2013).  In Floyd, after years of litigation culminating in a \nnine-week trial, on August 12, 2013, the Court issued an opinion holding that the City had a \npolicy of conducting race-based stops-and-frisks that ran afoul of the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments (the “Liability Order”).  Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 540, 562 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2013).  Because of the similarities in the City’s constitutional violations in Floyd and \nLigon, the Court issued a second opinion on August 12, 2013, which ordered certain remedial \nmeasures to cure the constitutional infirmities identified in both cases (the “Remedial Order”).  \nFloyd v. City of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 668, 671 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). \nInitially, the City appealed the Injunction, Liability, and Remedial Orders.  Several weeks \nlater, the Unions moved to intervene and also filed notices of appeal.  Then, in January 2014, \nnewly-elected Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the City’s intention to withdraw the appeals and \nsettle the cases.3  The Unions, nevertheless, still seek intervention to prosecute the appeals the \nCity no longer wants to pursue.  The Injunction, Liability, and Remedial Orders are the product \nof fifteen years of litigation, against the backdrop of decades of public discourse on the issue of \nstop-and-frisk.  Thus, because a full account of these cases would fill libraries, the Court \nchronicles only those facts that aid in addressing the Unions’ motions to intervene.  \nI.  Daniels, Floyd, and Ligon \nA.  Daniels v. City of New York \nAs the Second Circuit observed, the Floyd and Ligon actions “descend[] directly” from \nan earlier lawsuit, Daniels v. City of New York, 99 Civ. 1695 (SAS) (S.D.N.Y. 1999).  See Ligon \nv. City of New York, 736 F.3d 118, 122, 122 n.3 (2d Cir. 2013), vacated in part, 743 F.3d 362 (2d \n                         \n3 The Court takes judicial notice of the mayor’s January 30, 2014 press release, “Mayor de \nBlasio Announces Agreement in Landmark Stop-and-Frisk Case.”  Charney Decl. Ex. L, Floyd, \nECF No. 450-12; see also Carter Decl. ¶ 5, Floyd, ECF No. 457 (“If the Court approves the \nparties’ proposed modification, the City will then move to withdraw its appeals in Floyd and \nLigon with prejudice.”). \n \n4\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 5 of 108\nCir. 2014).  On March 8, 1999, Kelvin Daniels and Robert Roe filed a putative class action \nagainst the City, the NYPD, the mayor, the police commissioner, and John Doe officers, alleging \nthat the City had a policy, custom, and practice, carried out by the NYPD’s Street Crimes Unit,4 \nof suspicionless, racially-motivated stops-and-frisks that violated the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.  Complaint, Daniels, ECF No. 1.  The Daniels plaintiffs sought injunctive relief \nprohibiting the Street Crimes Unit from improperly using race or national origin in conducting \nstops-and-frisks and reforming relevant training, supervision, and monitoring procedures.  Id.  In \nparticular, they sought to enforce the requirement that officers complete UF-250 forms5 for each \nstop they conduct, that UF-250s be periodically reviewed for compliance with the Constitution, \nand that UF-250s be computerized and maintained in a database.  Am. Compl. 45, Daniels, ECF \nNo. 8.  Over the next five years, the parties engaged in extensive discovery and litigated several \nmajor motions, including a motion to dismiss and a motion for class certification.  Daniels, ECF \nNos. 18, 21, 75. \n  At the same time Daniels was being litigated, the United States Department of Justice \n(the “DOJ”) conducted an investigation of the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practices.6  As part of the \ninvestigation, the DOJ moved to intervene in Daniels pursuant to Rule 24(b) in order to access \nthe UF-250s the City had provided to the Daniels plaintiffs during discovery.  See Daniels, ECF \nNos. 93, 94.  The court denied the DOJ’s motion, reasoning that the proper avenue to obtain the \nmaterial was for the DOJ to file its own civil action rather than disrupting Daniels.  Daniels v. \n                         \n4 “[A]n elite squad of police officers whose self-proclaimed mission is to interdict violent crime \nin New York City and, in particular, remove illegal firearms from the streets.”  Daniels v. City of \nNew York, 200 F.R.D. 205, 206 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). \n5 The UF-250 is a form police officers use to document stops.  See Daniels v. City of New York, \n99 Civ. 1695, 2001 WL 228091, at *3 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2001). \n6 The DOJ investigation was conducted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 14141, which empowers the \nAttorney General to investigate and commence civil actions against police departments that have \nengaged in a pattern or practice “that deprives persons of rights, privileges, or immunities \nsecured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.”  42 U.S.C. § 14141. \n \n5\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 6 of 108\nCity of New York, 200 F.R.D. 205, 210 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).  \nIn September 2003, the parties in Daniels reached a settlement.  Daniels, ECF No. 153.  \nNotice of the settlement was published in three newspapers, El Diario, The New York Post, and \nThe New York Amsterdam News, see Daniels, ECF No. 150, and a public hearing was held on \nDecember 12, 2003, see Daniels, ECF No. 154.  Pursuant to the settlement, plaintiffs released \ntheir class claims against the City, and the City agreed to implement stop-and-frisk audit \nprocedures, revise training, ensure that all stops be documented on a revised UF-250 form, \nconduct joint community forums, and provide class counsel with quarterly updates.  Daniels, \nECF Nos. 151, 152.  The Daniels settlement remained in effect through December 31, 2007.  Id.     \nB.  Floyd v. City of New York \nIn January 2008, a month after the Daniels settlement period ended, David Floyd and \nLalit Clarkson commenced a lawsuit against the City, the mayor, the police commissioner, and \nseveral individual NYPD officers.  Compl., Floyd v. City of New York, 08 Civ. 1034 (S.D.N.Y. \nJan. 31, 2008), ECF No. 1.  The complaint alleged that the City had a policy, custom, and \npractice of suspicionless and race-based stops-and-frisks and sought city-wide injunctive relief, \nincluding changes to the NYPD’s policies and practices governing training, supervision, \ndiscipline, and monitoring of officers with respect to stop-and-frisk and racial profiling.  Id.  The \nNew York City Corporation Counsel represented all defendants, including the individual NYPD \nofficers.  See Floyd, ECF Nos. 43, 44, 51, 54, 111, 172.  A week after filing the complaint, the \nCourt granted the Floyd plaintiffs’ motion to retain the stop-and-frisk data that had been \nproduced to their counsel in connection with the Daniels settlement.  Floyd, ECF No. 2.  The \nFloyd plaintiffs subsequently amended the complaint to assert a putative class action, add \nplaintiffs, and name officer defendants.  Floyd, ECF Nos. 11, 50.  \n \n6\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 7 of 108\nFact discovery proceeded for nearly three years, during which time dozens of individual \nNYPD officers were deposed.  Charney Decl. ¶ 3, Floyd, ECF No. 450.  There were numerous \ndiscovery disputes and motions to compel.  Floyd, ECF Nos. 2, 45, 69, 92, 93, 108.  The parties \nmoved to exclude one another’s experts.  Floyd, ECF Nos. 201, 224.  Defendants sought to \nexclude the expert report of Jeffrey A. Fagan, a professor of criminology with expertise in \nstatistics, whose report analyzed years of UF-250 and other data.  Floyd, ECF No. 201.  Plaintiffs \nsought to exclude the rebuttal expert report of Dennis Smith, a political scientist with expertise in \npolice organizations, whose report provided an alternate statistical analysis of similar data.  \nFloyd, ECF No. 224.  The Court granted in part and denied in part both parties’ motions.  Floyd, \nECF Nos. 201, 224.  The parties also litigated, and the Court issued published opinions on \nseveral major motions, including motions for summary judgment and class certification.  Floyd \nv. City of New York, 813 F. Supp. 2d 417, 456, on reconsideration, 813 F. Supp. 2d 457 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2011) (summary judgment); Floyd v. City of New York, 283 F.R.D. 153, 164 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (class certification).   \nAt a November 27, 2012 hearing, plaintiffs stated that they would withdraw their claims \nfor money damages against all individual officers and seek only injunctive relief against the City.  \nNov. 27, 2012 Hearing Tr. at 4:10-25, Floyd, ECF No. 244.  On March 8, 2013, the Court so-\nordered the parties’ stipulation withdrawing plaintiffs’ claims against the individual officers, see \nStipulation and Order, Floyd, ECF No. 270, all of whom are union members, see Pl. Mem. 5, \nFloyd, ECF No. 448.  At a January 4, 2013 pretrial hearing, the Court rejected plaintiffs’ request \nto bifurcate the liability and remedies phases.  See Jan. 4, 2013 Hearing Tr. at 84:24-25; 85:8-9, \nFloyd, ECF No. 252.  Instead, the Court ruled that there would be a single bench trial, where \nevidence on both liability and remedies would be presented, after which a decision on liability \n \n7\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 8 of 108\nand, if necessary, remedies would be issued.  Id.  On January 31, 2013, the Court held a joint \nhearing in Floyd, Ligon, and Davis v. City of New York, 10 Civ. 699 (S.D.N.Y. filed Jan. 28, \n2010)—a putative class-action regarding stops-and-frisks in and around New York City public \nhousing.  See Jan. 31, 2013 Hearing Tr. at 6:13-21, Floyd, ECF No. 406.  In addition to \nreaffirming the decision not to bifurcate the Floyd trial, the Court requested that the parties brief \nthe scope of the remedial injunction, assuming, arguendo, that plaintiffs proved liability at trial.  \nId. at 25:4-26:6. \nOn March 6, 2013, the Floyd plaintiffs requested permanent injunctive relief, including \nchanges to the UF-250, appointment of an independent monitor, and creation of a joint remedial \nprocess to develop changes to training, supervising, monitoring, and disciplining officers with \nrespect to stop-and-frisk and racial profiling.  Injunctive Relief Mem. 20-22, Floyd, ECF No. \n268.  The DOJ also submitted a “Statement of Interest” in which it endorsed the appointment of \nan independent monitor should plaintiffs establish liability.  Floyd, ECF No. 365.  \nOn March 15, 2013, the parties filed a joint pretrial order.  Floyd, ECF No. 272.  The \nover 400-page document identified nearly 200 witnesses, many of whom were NYPD officers \nwhom the parties intended to call or whose deposition testimony would be introduced.  Id. at 16.  \nThe parties agreed that the core issue to be tried was “[w]hether the City of New York has an \nactionable Policy and/or Practice of stopping and frisking Black and Latino persons on the basis \nof race rather than reasonable suspicion . . . .”  Id. at 16.  \nTrial commenced on March 18, 2013 and continued through May 20, 2013.  Thirty police \nofficers, ten sergeants, ten lieutenants, three captains, four deputy inspectors, and seven \ninspectors testified.  Floyd, ECF No. 363 ¶¶ 23, 25-33, 43-49; 366 ¶¶ 86-107, 122-136.  In \naddition, senior NYPD officials and the parties’ liability and remedial experts testified.  After \n \n8\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 9 of 108\ntrial, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and post-trial briefs \non liability and remedial issues.  Floyd, ECF Nos. 363, 364, 366, 367.   \nC.  Ligon v. City of New York \nOn March 28, 2008, Jaenean Ligon filed a putative class action against the City, the \npolice commissioner, six named officers, and John Doe officers, challenging the NYPD’s \npractice of stopping, questioning, frisking, summonsing, and arresting people on suspicion of \ntrespass in and around buildings enrolled in TAP.  Compl., Ligon v. City of New York, 12 Civ. \n2274 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28. 2008), ECF No. 1.  The named plaintiffs also sought compensatory \ndamages against the individual defendants.  Id.  The Ligon plaintiffs moved for a preliminary \ninjunction, and the parties submitted briefs and motions in limine.  Ligon, ECF Nos. 42-59.  \nAfter a seven-day evidentiary hearing, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law.  Ligon, ECF Nos. 71-84, 88-91.   \nThe Court granted the preliminary injunction on January 8, 2013, because plaintiffs had \nshown a “clear likelihood of proving” that the City, by its deliberate indifference, had a policy of \nconducting unconstitutional stops outside TAP buildings. 7  Ligon, 925 F. Supp. 2d. at 485.  The \nCourt enjoined the NYPD from “performing trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx \nwithout reasonable suspicion of trespass, in accordance with the law as set forth and clarified in \nthis Opinion.”  Id. at 542.  To effectuate the injunction, the Court proposed specific changes to \npolicies, procedures, supervision, and training and invited the parties to brief “whether the \nproposed relief is insufficient or too burdensome or otherwise inappropriate.”  Id. at 543.  The \nCity filed a notice of appeal, which it withdrew when the Court granted the City’s motion to stay \nthe injunction.  Ligon, ECF Nos. 98, 99, 101.  Over the next several months the parties engaged \n                         \n7 The Court issued an amended opinion on February 14, 2013, which differs only in the Court’s \nanalysis of the evidence regarding one stop-and-frisk incident.  Ligon, ECF No. 105 at 57-60. \n \n9\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 10 of 108\nin two rounds of briefing and oral argument regarding the proper scope of remedies that should \nflow from the Injunction Order.  See Ligon, ECF Nos. 108, 109, 112, 117, 118. \nII.  The Liability Order and the Remedial Order \nOn August 12, 2013, the Court issued the Liability Order in Floyd, finding that the \nNYPD’s practice of conducting suspicionless stops-and-frisks was widespread, that the City was \ndeliberately indifferent to the NYPD’s practice, and that the practice was therefore attributable to \nthe City as an official policy.  959 F. Supp. 2d. at 562.  The Court held that this policy violated \nthe Fourth Amendment.  Id.  The Court also found that the City had adopted a race-based policy \nof disproportionately targeting blacks and Hispanics for stops and held that this policy violated \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id.  In so doing, the Court made \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law that evaluated, credited, and discredited the documentary \nand testimonial evidence presented at trial, including the testimony of numerous civilians who \nwere stopped and the testimony of numerous NYPD officers, many of whom were involved in \nthose stops.  Id. at 572-658.   \nThe Court issued the Remedial Order, also on August 12, 2013, directing the City—the \nsole remaining defendant—to remedy the violations identified in Floyd and Ligon.  Floyd, 959 F. \nSupp. 2d 668.  The Remedial Order mandates immediate and ongoing equitable relief.  Id.  With \nrespect to Floyd, the Remedial Order directs the court-appointed monitor to “develop, in \nconsultation with the parties, . . . ‘Immediate Reforms’ . . . as soon as practicable,” including \nchanges to “the NYPD’s policies, training, supervision, monitoring and discipline” regarding \nstop-and-frisk.  Id. at 678-84.  The proposed Immediate Reforms are to be submitted to the Court \nand implemented upon approval.  Id. at 677.  The Remedial Order also requires the City to \nconduct a one-year pilot project in which officers in one precinct per borough will wear body \n \n10\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 11 of 108\ncameras on patrol.  Id. at 685.  In addition, the City and Plaintiffs must engage in a six to nine \nmonth “Joint Remedial Process,” guided by a court-appointed facilitator, to develop “Joint \nProcess Reforms” in consultation with the monitor and based on input from a variety of \nstakeholders, including “NYPD personnel and representatives of police organizations.”  Id. at \n684-88.  The proposed Joint Process Reforms must be submitted to the Court for approval.  Id. at \n688.  With respect to Ligon, the Remedial Order adopts the approach proposed in the Injunction \nOrder, which requires the NYPD to adopt a court-provided written policy on the legal standard \nfor trespass stops around TAP buildings, to make changes to supervision and training regarding \nsuch stops, and, in conjunction with the monitor, to create a system for monitoring the \nconstitutionality of stops and ensuring that all stops are documented on UF-250s.  Id. at 688-90.  \nIII.  The Proposed Intervenors \nThe Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association of the City of New York, Inc. (the “PBA”), the \nDetectives’ Endowment Association, Inc. (the “DEA”), the NYPD Captains Endowment \nAssociation (the “CEA”), the Lieutenants Benevolent Association of the City of New York, Inc. \n(the “LBA”), and the Sergeants Benevolent Association (the “SBA”) are certified employee \norganizations as defined by § 12-307(4) of the New York City Collective Bargaining Law, N.Y. \nCity Admin. Code §§ 12–301, et seq. (the “CBL”).  Alejandro Decl. ¶¶ 7-10, Engel Decl. Ex. A., \nFloyd, ECF No. 438-1; Mullins Aff. ¶ 2, Floyd, ECF No. 397.  Collectively, they represent over \n35,000 active members of the NYPD, and they are the exclusive collective bargaining units for \ncontract negotiations with the City.  Alejandro Decl. ¶ 6; Mullins Aff. ¶ 2.  The PBA represents \nover 22,000 police officers, the DEA represents approximately 5,000 detectives, the CEA \nrepresents over 700 captains, and the LBA represents nearly 1,700 lieutenants on all collective \nbargaining matters under the CBL.  Alejandro Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8, 9, 19.  The SBA represents \n \n11\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 12 of 108\napproximately 13,000 active and retired sergeants.  Mullins Aff. ¶ 2.  The PBA, DEA, LBA, and \nCBA’s “core mission . . . is to advocate and protect the interests of [their] respective members of \nthe NYPD.”  Alejandro Decl. ¶ 11.  In addition, the PBA purports to “negotiate[] . . . with the \nCity of New York on matters of policy, terms and conditions of employment, and all matters \nrelating to police officers’ general welfare.”  Id. ¶ 7.  Similarly, the SBA states that its “central \nmission is to advocate for, and protect the interests of, its NYPD police sergeant members.”  \nMullins Aff. ¶ 3.  According to the District Court’s public records in Floyd and Ligon, the \nUnions have not sought any involvement in these actions, as intervenors or amici, prior to filing \ntheir motions to intervene in September 2013. \nIV.  Post-Trial Developments \nOn August 16, 2013, the City noticed its appeal of the Injunction, Liability, and Remedial \nOrders.  Floyd, ECF No. 379; Ligon, ECF No. 123.  The City also requested that the Court stay \nthe three Orders, which the Court denied.  Floyd, ECF Nos. 380, 402.  On September 12, 2013, \nthe Unions moved to intervene and filed notices of appeal indicating that they too were appealing \nthe Injunction, Liability, and Remedial Orders.  Floyd, ECF Nos. 388, 390-393, 395-397; Ligon, \nECF No. 135.  On October 31, 2013, the Second Circuit stayed the Orders and remanded Floyd \nand Ligon to the District Court for the limited purpose of designating a new District Judge to \n“implement this Court’s mandate staying all proceedings and otherwise await further action . . . \n.”  Ligon v. City of New York, 538 F. App’x 101, 103 (2d Cir. 2013).  Because the Second Circuit \nstayed all proceedings, the Unions’ September 2013 motions to intervene remained unresolved.  \nThe Unions then moved to intervene directly at the Second Circuit in November 2013.  See \nLigon v. City of New York, 743 F.3d 362 (2d Cir. 2014). \nOn January 30, 2014, Mayor de Blasio announced that the City and the Floyd and Ligon \n \n12\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 13 of 108\nPlaintiffs had reached an agreement to resolve the City’s appeals.  See Charney Decl. Ex. L.  \nAccordingly, the City moved the Second Circuit for a limited remand to the District Court to \n“permit the parties to explore a resolution,” which “the public interest strongly favors.”  Ligon, \n743 F.3d at 364.  On February 21, 2014, the Second Circuit denied the Unions’ motions to \nintervene, reasoning that the District Court should consider the motions in the first instance.  Id. \nat 365.  In the same order, the Second Circuit granted the City’s motion, remanding the cases “to \nthe District Court for the purpose of supervising settlement discussions among such concerned or \ninterested parties as the District Court deems appropriate, and resolving the motions to \nintervene.”  Id.  On February 25, 2014, this Court issued orders setting a new briefing schedule \non the intervention issue, directing the parties to continue settlement discussions, and directing \nthe parties to submit a joint letter to the Court by March 4, 2014, “indicating whether they desire \nthe Court’s participation in aid of settlement.”  Floyd, ECF No. 428; Ligon, ECF No. 167. \nV.  The Unions’ Supplemental Motions to Intervene \nFollowing remand to the District Court, on March 5, 2014, the Unions supplemented their \nSeptember 2013 motions to intervene.  Floyd, ECF Nos. 428, 442, 445; Ligon, ECF No. 171.  As \nwith the original motions, the SBA sought intervention only in Floyd, while the other unions \nmoved to intervene in Floyd and Ligon.  Floyd, ECF Nos. 442, 445.  Plaintiffs and the City \nopposed the motions.  Floyd, ECF Nos. 447, 448.  The Unions seek intervention pursuant to Rule \n24(a) or (b) on the basis of alleged interests that they claim are implicated by the Injunction, \nLiability, and Remedial Orders.  To protect these interests, the Unions argue that they must, after \nintervening, appeal the Orders.  The Unions also seek to intervene in order to participate in the \nsettlement of Floyd and Ligon and the remedial phase of the litigation. \n \n \n13\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 14 of 108\nVI.  The Parties’ Motion to Modify the Remedial Order \nOn March 4, 2014, Plaintiffs and the City filed a joint letter indicating that they had \n“reached an agreement in principle for resolving the City’s appeals in both Floyd and Ligon.”  \nFloyd, ECF No. 433; Ligon, ECF No. 169.  Instead of proposing an entirely new settlement \nagreement, the letter indicates that the City intends to accept the Remedial Order with certain \nmodifications consistent with the mayor’s January 30, 2014 announcement.  Id.  On April 3, \n2014, Plaintiffs and the City filed a joint motion to modify the Remedial Order to reflect the \nterms of their agreement.  Floyd, ECF No. 456.  The parties request a single modification of the \nRemedial Order:  rather than the independent monitor serving for an unspecified period, the \nparties propose that the monitor’s term be limited to no more than three years, provided that the \nCity can demonstrate by the end of that term that it has substantially complied with the Remedial \nOrder.  Floyd, ECF No. 458.  Corporation Counsel Zachary W. Carter submitted a declaration \nstating that the City will move to withdraw its appeals with prejudice “[i]f the Court approves the \nparties’ proposed modification.”  Carter Decl. ¶ 5, Floyd, ECF No. 457; Ligon, ECF No. 189.  \nThe Unions oppose the motion, restating their position regarding intervention, complaining that \nthe proposed modification “includes no mechanism for [the Unions] to present [their] collective \nbargaining concerns . . . or otherwise protect their rights,” and seeking a role “in aiding or \ndisputing the City’s ‘showing’ of ‘substantial compliance.’”  SBA Mem. 5, Floyd, ECF No. 461. \nThe Court shall first address the Unions’ motions to intervene for the purpose of \nappealing the Injunction, Liability, and Remedial Orders and then turn to the Unions’ other \ngrounds for intervention and the parties’ motion to modify the Remedial Order. \n \n \n \n14\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 15 of 108\nDISCUSSION \nI.  Motions to Intervene to Appeal the Injunction, Liability, and Remedial Orders \nThe Unions move to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(a) or (b) to protect two alleged \ninterests:  (1) the reputation of NYPD officers, which has allegedly been harmed by the Liability \nOrder’s findings of widespread constitutional violations; and (2) the Unions’ right to collectively \nbargain about the terms and conditions of their members’ employment, which is allegedly \nthreatened by the Remedial Order.  To vindicate these interests, the Unions argue that they must \nappeal the Injunction, Liability, and Remedial Orders to “ensure that [they] are reviewed on the \nmerits and that the NYPD and its members are not burdened and besmirched by findings and \nremedies that are legally infirm.”  PBA Mem. 3, Floyd, ECF No. 445.  The Unions argue that \nonly after a successful appeal, including appellate repudiation of the Orders, will union \nmembers’ reputations and the Unions’ collective bargaining rights be restored.  After careful \nconsideration, the motions are denied for three reasons:  (1) the motions are untimely; (2) the \nUnions have no significant protectable interests relating to the subject of the litigation that would \nwarrant intervention; and (3) even if their alleged interests were cognizable, the Unions lack \nstanding to vindicate those interests on appeal. \nBefore turning to each of these issues, the Court shall address a preliminary matter raised \nby Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs argue, and the Court agrees, that the Unions have not adequately \naddressed two issues, the timeliness of the Unions’ motion and the nature of their alleged \ninterests in the merits of Ligon.8  Notwithstanding the fact that Ligon raises distinct liability and \nremedial issues and has a unique procedural posture, the Unions filed the same intervention \n                         \n8 In this paragraph, “the Unions” does not include the SBA, which has not moved to intervene in \nLigon. \n \n15\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 16 of 108\nbriefs in Ligon as they filed in Floyd.  However, the briefs discuss only Floyd.9  When Plaintiffs \npointed out the oversight, the Unions responded with a footnote, “[t]he Ligon [Injunction Order], \nlike the Floyd Liability [Order], contains findings of unconstitutional conduct by particular \nmembers of the [Unions] . . . and rests in part on the same expert’s analysis of the UF-250 forms \nas in Floyd . . . The [U]nions’ arguments in favor of intervention on remedies and appeal thus \napply to both cases.”  PBA Reply Mem. 2, Floyd, ECF No. 453.  This footnote concludes what it \npresumes; it does not, however, explain why the Unions’ motions are timely with respect to \nintervening to appeal the Injunction Order, which was issued eight months before the Liability \nand Remedial Orders.  Moreover, the Unions offer no explanation of their interest in the merits \nof Ligon, except to say that it is identical to their concerns in Floyd.  Where the Unions do not \nsee fit to address these issues, the Court will not do their work for them.  Accordingly, the Court \nfinds that the Unions have failed to meet their burden to justify intervention with respect to \nappealing the Injunction Order.  United States Postal Serv. v. Brennan, 579 F.2d 188, 191 (2nd \nCir. 1978).  Thus, the Court will not consider the Injunction Order in addressing timeliness, nor \nwill the Court address the Unions’ interests in the merits of Ligon separate from Floyd.  Instead, \nthe Court will focus primarily, as have the Unions’ motions, on the Liability and Remedial \nOrders. \nA.  Legal Standard \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 permits a non-party to intervene in ongoing litigation \nas of right or by permission of the court.  The applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that it \nmeets the requirements for intervention.  United States Postal Serv., 579 F.2d at 191.  Generally, \n                         \n9 As Plaintiffs observe, the PBA was aware of the Injunction Order, as evidenced by the press \nrelease to their members shortly after it was issued, describing the trespass stops in Ligon as \n“management’s poorly conceived program[]” that resulted from the “City’s misguided budget \npriorities.”  “PBA Reacts to Federal Judge’s Stop and Frisk Decision,” Charney Decl. Ex. M, \nFloyd, ECF No 450-13. \n \n16\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 17 of 108\nthe court accepts as true the applicant’s well-pleaded, non-conclusory allegations and supporting \nmaterial.  See Bay Casino, LLC v. M/V Royal Empress, 199 F.R.D. 464, 466 (E.D.N.Y. 1999).  \nMotions to intervene are highly fact-specific and tend to resist comparison to prior cases.  Id.  \nBecause “prior decisions are not always reliable guides,” courts are guided by practical and \nequitable considerations in an effort to balance “efficiently administrating legal disputes by \nresolving all related issues in one lawsuit, on the one hand, and keeping a single lawsuit from \nbecoming unnecessarily complex, unwieldy or prolonged, on the other hand.”  United States v. \nPitney Bowes, Inc., 25 F.3d 66, 69 (2d Cir. 1994). \n    To seek intervention as of right under Rule 24(a), an applicant must make a four-part \nshowing:  (1) the application is timely; (2) the applicant has a significant protectable interest \nrelating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action; (3) the disposition of the \naction may practically impair the applicant’s ability to protect its interest; and (4) the existing \nparties may not adequately represent the applicant’s interest.  Pitney Bowes, 25 F.3d at 70.  “The \nintervention application will be denied unless all four requirements are met.”  Id.  In applying the \nRule, courts must be cognizant that its “various components . . . are not bright lines, but ranges—\nnot all ‘interests’ are of equal rank, not all impairments are of the same degree, representation by \nexisting parties may be more or less adequate, and there is no litmus paper test for timeliness.”  \nUnited States v. Hooker Chems. & Plastics Corp., 749 F.2d 968, 983 (2d Cir. 1984).  \n“[A]lthough the Rule does not say so in terms, common sense demands that consideration also be \ngiven to matters that shape a particular action or particular type of action.”  Id. \n    Courts may consider the same factors under Rule 24(b) permissive intervention as with \nintervention as of right under Rule 24(a).  See R Best Produce, Inc. v. Shulman-Rabin Mktg. \nCorp., 467 F.3d 238, 240 (2d Cir. 2006). \n \n17\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 18 of 108\nB.  Timeliness \nUnder both provisions of Rule 24, the threshold inquiry is whether the application for \nintervention is timely.  “The timeliness requirement is flexible and the decision is one entrusted \nto the district judge’s sound discretion.”  United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 801 F.2d 593, \n594-95 (2d Cir. 1986); see also NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. 345, 366 (1973).  Whether the \nUnions’ motions are timely depends on:  (1) the length of time the Unions knew or should have \nknown of their interest before making the motion; (2) prejudice to existing parties resulting from \ntheir delay; (3) prejudice to the Unions if the motion is denied; and (4) the presence of unusual \ncircumstances militating for or against a finding of timeliness.  United States v. New York, 820 \nF.2d 554, 557 (2d Cir. 1987).  Generally, the Second Circuit disfavors intervention after liability \nhas been adjudged because “it fosters delay and prejudice to existing parties.”  Farmland Dairies \nv. Comm’r of New York State Dep’t of Agric. & Mkts., 847 F.2d 1038, 1044 (2d Cir. 1988). \n1.  Length of Time Unions Knew or Should Have Known of Their Alleged Interests \nThe Unions urge that their motions are timely because they were filed by September 12, \n2013, within thirty days of the issuance of the Liability and Remedial Orders.  A month earlier, \nthey allege, was the first time they realized that they had interests in Floyd and Ligon which \nwould not likely be represented by the existing parties.  The Unions also contend that the \nsubsequent election of a new mayor, who no longer intends to pursue an appeal, confirmed for \nthe first time that their interests would not be protected.  Because the Floyd trial could have \nresulted in a finding of no liability against the City, the Unions argue that it was reasonable for \nthem to await the outcome before moving to intervene.  Similarly, with respect to the Remedial \nOrder, the Unions contend that they could not have known that their alleged collective \nbargaining interests would be threatened until the Floyd trial concluded and the Remedial Order \n \n18\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 19 of 108\nissued.  Nor could the Unions, they claim, have predicted the “capacious scope” of the Remedial \nOrder’s impact on day-to-day officer responsibilities.  PBA Mem. 12.  The Unions argue, \ntherefore, that their wait-and-see approach to intervention was reasonable. \nPlaintiffs respond that to the extent that Floyd and Ligon might impact union members’ \nreputations, their daily job duties, and the Unions’ collective bargaining rights, the Unions knew \nor should have known months, if not years, before August 2013.  The Liability and Remedial \nOrders, Plaintiffs contend, could not have come as a surprise given the nature of the pleadings in \nFloyd and Ligon and the pretrial publicity.  The complaints in both cases allege that individual \nofficers, all union members, had conducted unconstitutional stops, and the complaints seek the \nsame department-wide changes to policies, training, supervision, monitoring, documentation, and \ndisciplinary procedures that the Unions now criticize.  Floyd, Ligon, and their precursor Daniels \ngenerated such high publicity that numerous stakeholders, including members of the New York \nCity Council, civic groups, and the DOJ, filed submissions with the Court before and after the \nFloyd trial.  Plaintiffs argue that the Unions’ delay is fatal to their motions. \nWith respect to the timeliness of the Unions’ proposed intervention to appeal the Liability \nand Remedial Orders, the facts and the law are on Plaintiffs’ side.  Assuming, arguendo, that the \nUnions’ alleged interests are colorable on a motion to intervene, the intervention clock started to \nrun from the moment the Unions became aware or should have become aware that they had \ninterests in the subject matter of the litigation not otherwise protected by the existing parties to \nthe lawsuit.  See Farmland Dairies, 847 F.2d at 1044; see also League of United Latin Am. \nCitizens v. Wilson, 131 F.3d 1297, 1307 (9th Cir. 1997) (“[U]nder Rule 24 the timeliness clock \nbegins ticking from the time a proposed intervenor should have been aware its interests would no \nlonger be protected adequately by the parties.”) (alterations, citations, and internal quotations \n \n19\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 20 of 108\nmarks omitted).  Even where post-judgment intervention is sought, courts deem these efforts \ntimely only where the judgment itself, or events subsequent to judgment, are the first time that \nthe intervenor learns of its unrepresented interests in the action.  See, e.g., United Airlines, Inc. v. \nMcDonald, 432 U.S. 385, 394 (1977) (Only upon entry of final judgment did “it bec[o]me clear \nto the respondent that the interests of the unnamed class members would no longer be protected \nby the named class representatives,” after which “she promptly moved to intervene to protect \nthose interests.”); Dow Jones & Co., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 161 F.R.D. 247, 251-53 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1995) (Sotomayor, J.) (United Airlines’ requirement that non-parties seeking post-\njudgment intervention act “promptly” after the issuance of the judgment supplements, not \nsupplants, the four-part timeliness standard announced in United States v. New York, 820 F.2d at \n557, which includes among its factors, “the length of time they knew or should have known of \ntheir interest before making the motion.”).   \nHere, the Unions offer several explanations for the timing of their motions, each of which \nis legally or factually inconsistent with the applicable actual or constructive notice standard.  \nAfter rejecting these unavailing explanations, the Court conducts a detailed review of the record \nand concludes that the Unions knew or should have known about their alleged interests in Floyd \nand Ligon far earlier than August 2013.  The Court turns first to the Unions’ explanations.       \na.  The Unions’ Timeliness Rationale \ni.  The “Thirty-day Rule” \nFirst, the Unions contend that the Court need not examine their interests prior to August \n2013, because “a motion to intervene . . . filed within the 30-day period for filing a notice of \nappeal . . . is timely.”  SBA Mem. 23, Floyd, ECF No. 442; PBA Mem. 10-11.  According to the \nUnions, “[t]he ‘critical inquiry’ is not how long the case has been pending, but whether the \n \n20\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 21 of 108\nintervenor acted ‘promptly’ after the judgment.”  PBA Reply Mem. 1 (citing United Airlines, \n432 U.S. at 395-96).  This is a fundamental misstatement of the case law on post-judgment \nintervention, which focuses on actual or constructive notice, not a rigid thirty-day rule.   \nTo arrive at this errant conclusion, the Unions conflate two distinct concepts:  the \nsubstantive legal interest Rule 24(a) requires for intervention and the procedural mechanism the \napplicant intends to employ upon intervening in order to vindicate that interest.  In some \ncircumstances, substantive interest and procedural purpose are aligned:  an applicant becomes \naware of an interest by the very issuance of the court order threatening that interest, thus \nnecessitating intervention for the purpose of vindicating the interest by taking an appeal.  See \nUnited Airlines, 432 U.S. at 394 (unnamed class member, whose interests in class determination \nonly became actionable upon entry of the final judgment, moved promptly thereafter to intervene \nto appeal the judgment).  Accordingly, in a case cited by the Unions, Drywall Tapers & Pointers, \nLocal Union 1974 v. Nastasi & Assocs., Inc., the Second Circuit held that a prudent applicant \nmoving to intervene in order to appeal an order should do so within the same thirty-day period to \nappeal the underlying judgment.  488 F.3d 88, 95 (2d Cir. 2007).   \nIn other circumstances, interest awareness and the procedural mechanism are not aligned.  \nFor example, where an applicant obtains notice of an unrepresented interest long before the \nissuance of the order the applicant seeks to appeal, a motion to intervene in order to vindicate \nthat interest on appeal could be untimely even if it were filed within thirty days of the order.  \nYonkers Board of Education is a textbook example.  801 F.2d 594.  There, homeowners moved \nto intervene to appeal a remedial order designating sites near their homes for public housing.  \nThe homeowners opposed the chosen sites and asserted an economic interest in ensuring that \nproper sites were chosen.  Although they moved to intervene within the thirty-day period for \n \n21\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 22 of 108\nappealing the judgment, the Second Circuit found the motion untimely because the homeowners \nshould have known of their site designation interest earlier, when the proposed sites were first \npublicly announced.  Id. at 597.  Thus, contrary to the Unions’ position, awareness of the \ninterest, not the thirty-day deadline to appeal, is dispositive as to measuring the length of the \napplicant’s delay.   \nThe Unions also cite several out-of-circuit cases for the fictional thirty-day rule.  See \nUnited States v. City of Detroit, 712 F.3d 925 (6th Cir. 2013); Elliott Indus. Ltd. P’ship v. BP \nAm. Prod. Co., 407 F.3d 1091 (10th Cir. 2005); Acree v. Republic of Iraq, 370 F.3d 41 (D.C. Cir. \n2004); Edwards v. City of Houston, 78 F.3d 983 (5th Cir. 1996); Yniguez v. Arizona, 939 F.2d \n727 (9th Cir. 1991); Hodgson v. United Mine Workers, 473 F.2d 118 (D.C. Cir. 1972).  These \ncases did not so hold.  In each, the filing of a motion to intervene within the thirty-day appeal \nwindow was not dispositive as to timeliness.  Instead, City of Detroit, Elliott Indus., Acree, City \nof Houston, Yniguez,10 and Hodgson all held a motion to intervene timely where the applicant \nfirst learned of its unrepresented interest in conjunction with or after the issuance of the order it \nsought to appeal.  These courts did not apply a rigid thirty-day rule.  Instead, they looked to the \nparticular facts concerning delay, prejudice, and notice. \nIn all cases, whether pre- or post-judgment, Rule 24(a) requires courts to measure \ntimeliness from the moment when the applicant had actual or constructive notice of its \nunrepresented interest, not from the moment a judgment was issued or from the moment when \n                         \n10 The Unions fail to mention a subsequent development in Yniguez.  In a unanimous opinion, the \nSupreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit’s judgment on the ground that the case became moot \nwhen the plaintiff, whose challenge to Arizona’s English-only ballot initiative was based on her \nstate employment, left her position.  Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 66 \n(1997).  Although the Court “need[ed] not definitively resolve the issue” of whether the Ninth \nCircuit erred in allowing private parties to intervene in order to vindicate the constitutionality of \na state policy on appeal where state officials declined to do so, the Court expressed “grave \ndoubts” about the intervenors Article III standing.  Id.  \n \n22\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 23 of 108\nthe existing parties decided not to appeal that judgment.  Thus, courts have deemed timely a \nmotion to intervene where the decision of an existing party not to appeal a court ruling provided \nthe would-be intervenor its first notice of its unrepresented interest in a lawsuit.  See, e.g., Dow \nJones & Co., 161 F.R.D. at 252-53; see also Heartwood, Inc. v. U.S. Forest Serv., Inc., 316 F.3d \n694, 701 (7th Cir. 2003) (“The relevant inquiry in determining timeliness . . . is not on the time \nbetween the [judgment] and the motion to intervene . . . but instead . . . on the time between \n[movant’s] knowledge that the suit could impact their interests and the motion to intervene.”).  \nHere, the fact that the Unions filed their initial motions to intervene with thirty days of the \nissuance of the Liability and Remedial Orders does not make their motions timely.  Instead, the \nCourt must look at all the circumstances to determine when the Unions obtained the required \nactual or constructive knowledge.   \nii.  Waiting for the Unions’ Alleged Interests to “Crystallize” \nSecond, the Unions posit that it was appropriate for them to wait for their alleged \ninterests to “crystallize” before moving to intervene, SBA Reply Mem. 13, Floyd, ECF No. 451, \nwhen “there [could] be no doubt,” PBA Mem. 12, that their interests would not be represented by \nthe City.  Implicitly, the Unions appear to acknowledge that they knew they had interests in \nFloyd and Ligon prior to August 2013, but contend that those interests had not fully matured.  On \nthis view, “[t]he events that prompted [the Unions] to intervene, and [their] inability to have \nforeseen the necessity of [their] involvement in this matter, fully support a finding that the \nmotion is timely.”  SBA Reply Mem. 9-10.  Three purportedly unforeseeable developments \nappear to have caused their interests to “crystallize:” (1) the Court’s finding of liability against \nthe City in Floyd; (2) the Court’s factual findings in the Liability Order; and (3) the election of a \nnew mayor which led to the City’s withdrawal of the prior administration’s consent to the \n \n23\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 24 of 108\nUnions’ intervention in Floyd and Ligon and the announcement that the City would withdraw its \nappeal of the Injunction, Liability, and Remedial Orders.   \n   The Unions’ argument is not supported by intervention case law.  Rule 24 does not \nrequire that an applicant’s interest be “crystallize[d]” or that an applicant wait until there is “no \ndoubt” that his or her interests will be impacted.  Instead, Rule 24 encourages applicants to move \nwhen it becomes apparent that their interests might not be protected.  See Butler, Fitzgerald & \nPotter v. Sequa Corp., 250 F.3d 171, 182 (2d Cir. 2001) (Non-party should have sought \nintervention when it realized “that its interests might not be adequately represented.”) (emphasis \nadded); see also Heartwood, Inc., 316 F.3d at 701 (The relevant inquiry is when the applicant \nhad “knowledge that the suit could impact their interests.”) (emphasis added); In re Tribune Co. \nFraudulent Conveyance Litig., 291 F.R.D. 38, 41 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (Applicant moved to \nintervene “as soon as” it realized existing party no longer represented its interests.).  The Unions’ \nposition, by contrast, would encourage applicants to delay their motions until it is absolutely \ncertain, after judgment, that their interests have been adjudicated.  The Second Circuit has \nemphasized that such dilatory tactics are “disfavored because [they] usually create[] delay and \nprejudice to existing parties, and undermine[] the orderly administration of justice.”  Yonkers, \n801 F.2d at 596 (citations omitted).  Moreover, although courts should not encourage premature \nmotions to intervene, see Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 265 (5th Cir. 1977), such \ntiming defects are not fatal to subsequent motions.  See, e.g., Yonkers, 801 F.2d at 597 n.6 \n(discussing, with approval, the district court’s grant of a motion to intervene after denying, \nwithout prejudice, an earlier motion as premature when the movant’s interests were too \nspeculative); Pitney Bowes, 25 F.3d at 71 (suggesting that, although the applicant’s interests \nwere uncertain, applicant could have moved to intervene “as an anchor to windward . . . to guard \n \n24\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 25 of 108\nagainst the possibility” that its interests would be impacted); Hickerson v. City of New York, 932 \nF. Supp. 550, 559 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).  Thus, if prior to August 2013 the Unions knew or should \nhave known that their interests existed but were unprotected, they should have proactively \nmoved to intervene at that time.  Even if the motion had been denied as premature, it would have \nput the Court and the parties on notice that at a later stage in the litigation the Unions might seek \nintervention.  Rather than waiting, as the Unions did, until they had “no doubt” that the City \nwould not adequately represent their interests, intervention law required them to move at the first \ninstance that there was some doubt.  \nIt is unclear whether the Unions’ view is that their interests did not exist prior to August \n2013, or that they did exist but were adequately represented by the City prior to August 2013.  In \neither case, the Unions claim that pre-August 2013 developments are irrelevant because their \ninterests did not “crystallize” until a series of purportedly unforeseeable developments occurred.  \nFirst, prior to August 2013, the Unions assert that they “did not have reason to intervene for \npurposes of appealing the [Orders] until after the [Orders] were issued,” SBA Mem. 25, because \n“[h]ad the City prevailed at trial, the [U]nions’ participation would have remained unnecessary.”  \nPBA Reply Mem. 6.  This argument is unavailing.  At its core, the Unions’ argument is that they \ndid not intervene beforehand because the City might have won.  Thus, the “unforeseeable” event \nthat caused their interests to “crystallize” is that the City lost the trial.  Trials are adversarial \nproceedings that usually conclude with a judge or jury pronouncing a winner and a loser, and the \nloser often has to pay damages or remedy the conduct that initially troubled the winner.  Here, it \nshould have come as no surprise that when the Floyd trial ended, there would be a winner and a \nloser, and it was entirely foreseeable that the winner might not be the party the Unions preferred.   \nNext, the Unions claim that the refusal of a newly-elected mayor to appeal the decisions \n \n25\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 26 of 108\nwas an unforeseeable event that “crystallized” the necessity of their intervention.  SBA Mem. 18-\n20.  This argument is also unavailing.  It should have come as no surprise that, as a risk inherent \nin a democratic election, the candidate who supports one’s preferred policing policies might not \nwin.  In fact, in 2009, during the second year of the Floyd litigation, a mayoral election occurred.  \nIt was possible that the then-current mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, would not be re-elected and \nthat a new mayor might pursue a different litigation strategy.  The risk was heightened when \nMayor Bloomberg, a former co-defendant in Floyd and a proponent of the City’s stop-and-frisk \npolicy, could not run in 2013 because he was term-limited, and there was certainty that a new \nmayor would take his place.  Accordingly, it should have come as no surprise that, where the \ncandidates had a range of views on stop-and-frisk, the new mayor might change the City’s \nlitigation strategy upon assuming office.  Although the particular outcome of an election may be \nunforeseeable, that elections occur is foreseeable, as is the fact that a new mayor may have \nlitigation priorities that differ from those of his or her predecessor. \nFinally, the Unions claim that they could not have foreseen the Court’s factual findings \nand the legal reasoning that would support the Court’s finding of liability against the City.  In \nparticular, the Unions claim to have been caught off guard by the breadth of the Liability and \nRemedial Orders: \n“[A]n extraordinary pair of erroneously reasoned Opinions that accuse police \nofficers, including [union members] of widespread violations of the Constitution \nbased on flawed reasoning and insufficient evidence.  The [Unions] could not \nhave foreseen that the Opinions would find that, over an eight-year period, at least \n200,000  stops  conducted  by  NYPD  officers  were  unconstitutional  and  that \nofficers intentionally targeted minorities, based solely on a purported statistical \nanalysis of UF-250 forms, and without any consideration of the totality of the \nunique circumstances of each of the 4.4 million stops at issue . . . . Nor could the \n[Unions] have anticipated a sweeping opinion mandating unprecedented remedies \n. . . .”   \n \nSBA Reply Mem. 11-12.  Because the Unions purportedly could not have foreseen the scope of \n \n26\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 27 of 108\nthe Liability Order, they further contend that “[t]he police officers’ conduct and reputations are \nplaced at issue only if, in fact, the Liability [Order] can survive appellate scrutiny.”  PBA Reply \nMem. 18. \nThis argument is also unavailing for several reasons.  First, months before the Floyd trial, \nthe parties vigorously litigated the admissibility of evidence prepared by plaintiffs’ expert \nwitness, Jeffrey A. Fagan, who developed a statistical analysis of hundreds of thousands of UF-\n250s and drew conclusions regarding the role of race in stops-and-frisks.  During these pretrial \nproceedings, Fagan’s methodology and his interpretation of the data were closely and critically \nexamined.  Therefore, the Unions cannot be heard to say that the substantive content of Fagan’s \nresearch and conclusions concerning the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practices was unforeseeable.  \nSecond, with respect to the Remedial Order, it does not take the issuance of a judicial opinion for \na union to realize that the employer is not looking out for the union’s collective bargaining \ninterests insofar as they may arise in a lawsuit.  The Unions acknowledge, as they must, that \n“unions and [their employers] do not have an identity of interests.”  SBA Mem. 20.  Similarly, \nthe City observes that “the interests of the City and the Unions may differ on collective \nbargaining issues.”  Letter from the City of New York (Oct. 18, 2013), ECF No. 414.  Third, the \nview that conduct reviewed at trial is only “at issue” if the district court’s verdict is affirmed by \nthe Court of Appeals is contrary to basic principles of federal law.  The district court’s orders are \nfinal and self-executing; they are not suppositions that require affirmance by a court of appeals \nbefore becoming effective.  \nIn sum, the Unions’ position that its motions are timely because they were filed either \nwithin thirty-days of the Liability and Remedial Orders or when their alleged interests \n“crystallized” is inconsistent with relevant case law.  Moreover, the Unions’ contention that \n \n27\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 28 of 108\ncertain post-trial developments were unforeseeable is implausible.  Because the Court rejects the \nUnions’ various explanations for the timing of their motions, the Court endeavors to determine \nwhen the Unions obtained actual or constructive notice that their alleged interests in Floyd and \nLigon were not represented by the existing parties.  A review of the facts reveals that the alleged \ninterests that the Unions claim were unforeseeable until August 2013 were actually ascertainable \nfar earlier.  The Court now turns to that issue.   \nb.  Measuring the Delay Between Notice and the Unions’ Motions \n “Delay is not measured solely subjectively because, if that were the test, a putative \nintervenor could always claim it did not know it needed to intervene until the eve of its motion.”  \nButler, Fitzgerald & Potter, 250 F.3d at 182.  Delay is measured from when the applicant had \nactual notice or constructive notice of an unrepresented interest, which may be implied from a \nvariety of circumstances.  See NAACP, 413 U.S. at 366-67 (notice implied from newspaper \narticle, public comment by community leaders, size and astuteness of membership and staff of \norganizational appellant, and questioning of two individual appellants by lawyers with the DOJ \nregarding the subject matter of the litigation).  Courts in this circuit have recognized that a \nvariety of case developments, similar to those in Floyd and Ligon, may provide actual or \nconstructive notice:  (i) the filing of a complaint or the initiation of related litigation, see, e.g., \nD’Amato v. Deutsche Bank, 236 F.3d 78, 84 (2d Cir. 2001); Catanzano by Catanzano v. Wing, \n103 F.3d 223, 232-33 (2d Cir. 1996); Pitney Bowes, 25 F.3d at 71; Citizens Against Casino \nGambling in Erie Cnty. v. Hogen, 704 F. Supp. 2d 269, 282 (W.D.N.Y. 2010), aff’d, 417 F. \nApp’x 49 (2d Cir. 2011); (ii) class certification, see, e.g., Hnot v. Willis Grp. Holdings Ltd., 01 \nCiv. 6558, 2006 WL 3476746, at *3-4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 30, 2006), aff’d, 234 F. App’x 13 (2d Cir. \n2007); (iii) the litigating of major or dispositive motions, see, e.g., MasterCard Int’l Inc. v. Visa \n \n28\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 29 of 108\nInt’l Serv. Ass’n, Inc., 471 F.3d 377, 390 (2d Cir. 2006); (iv) the resolution process, see, e.g., In \nre Holocaust Victim Assets Litig., 225 F.3d 191, 198 (2d Cir. 2000); and (v) publicity about the \nlawsuit, see, e.g., In re Bank of New York Derivative Litig., 320 F.3d 291, 300-01 (2d Cir. 2003); \nAuthors Guild v. Google, Inc., 74 Fed. R. Serv. 3d 1488 (S.D.N.Y. 2009).  Here, numerous \ndevelopments in the course of Floyd and Ligon and their related precursor Daniels should have \nprovided the Unions with notice of the pendency of their alleged interests.   \ni.  Filing of a Complaint and Related Litigation \nNumerous courts have found that, among other factors, the initiation of a lawsuit where \nthe complaint addresses the would-be intervenors’ interests may trigger constructive notice.  See, \ne.g., Pitney Bowes, 25 F.3d at 71 (plaintiff’s public filing of the action in the Federal Register \nalerted proposed intervenors to their interests); Catanzano, 103 F.3d at 233 (home health service \nproviders who asserted an interest in not being forced to provide care should have known from \nthe initiation of the lawsuit that plaintiffs sought to require such care); D’Amato, 236 F.3d at 84 \n(among other factors, the motion was denied as untimely because it was made more than a year \nafter the complaint was filed).  Movants may also obtain notice based on the commencement of \nrelated litigation.  See, e.g., Farmland Dairies, 847 F.2d at 1044 (affirming district court finding \nthat applicants could have moved as soon as they “were aware of this and related litigation”); \nCitizens Against Casino Gambling, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 282 (prior filing of two related lawsuits \npredicated on similar assertions and proposed remedies against similar parties provided notice). \nThe Daniels complaint, filed on March 8, 1999, the Floyd complaint, filed on January 31, \n2008, and the Ligon complaint, filed on March 28, 2012, each contained allegations and sought \nrelief that should have put the Unions on notice of their alleged reputational and collective \n \n29\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 30 of 108\nbargaining interests.  In each of the three complaints, plaintiffs alleged Monell liability11 against \nthe City through the conduct of its agency, the NYPD, for encouraging officers to carry out \nunconstitutional stops-and-frisks.  As is typical in such claims against municipalities, the \nplaintiffs alleged that individual officers engaged in unlawful conduct and that the City’s \ndeliberate indifference to this behavior gave rise to a de facto City policy.  From the complaints \nin each case, it was foreseeable that factual allegations regarding union member conduct would \nbe litigated, that a judge or jury might conclude that the conduct was unlawful, and that city-wide \nremedies could follow.  Therefore, the Unions should have learned of their alleged interests by \n2008 when Floyd was filed.   \nForeseeability is heightened for several reasons.  In all three lawsuits, union members \nwere among the individual officers named as defendants.  Each complaint specifically requested \ndepartment-wide changes to stop-and-frisk policies, training, supervision, monitoring, \ndocumentation, and disciplinary procedures.  The remedial measures sought by plaintiffs in \nDaniels, Floyd, and Ligon are quite similar to the relief contained in the Remedial Order.  Thus, \nthe foreseeability of a potential clash with the Unions’ alleged interests dates back to March \n1999, January 2008, and March 2012.  In fact, Floyd and Ligon were filed as related to Daniels \nand formally assigned to the same district judge.  See Ligon, 736 F.3d at 122 (discussing the \nrelationship between Daniels, Ligon, and Floyd).  Thus, the filing of Floyd as related to Daniels \nonly a month after the Daniels case ended, and Ligon, as related to both, equally provided notice.   \nThe Unions reject the notion that the initiation of these lawsuits conveyed notice, arguing \nthat “the time that the would-be intervenor first became aware of the pendency of the case is not \nrelevant to the issue of whether his application was timely.”  SBA Reply Mem. 6 (citing \n                         \n11 Under Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 690-91 \n(1978) and its progeny, municipalities can sued for monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for unconstitutional policies or customs. \n \n30\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 31 of 108\nStallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 265 (5th Cir. 1977)).  The Unions’ argument obscures \nthe holding of this out-of-circuit case.  In Stallworth, the Fifth Circuit rejected a per se rule that \nthe filing of a complaint provides a proposed intervenor with notice.  558 F.2d at 264-65.  \nInstead, in following the constructive knowledge standard from United Airlines and NAACP, the \nFifth Circuit reversed the district court’s finding of untimeliness because it “used an unspecified \ntime when it supposed that the appellants must have learned of the pendency of the action rather \nthan the time when they knew or should have known of their interest in the action as its starting \npoint in assessing whether they acted promptly to protect themselves.”  Id. at 267.  The court \nreasoned that the filing of a complaint is not always sufficient to notify a would-be intervenor of \nits interests because interests unapparent when a complaint is filed may reveal themselves later in \na lawsuit.  Id.  Thus, Stallworth supports Plaintiffs’ constructive notice argument.  Plaintiffs do \nnot argue that the filing of the complaints, per se, should have triggered notice.  Instead, \nPlaintiffs contend that the complaints’ substantive allegations and prayers for relief provided \nnotice.   \nThe Unions rely heavily on another out-of-circuit case, United States v. City of Los \nAngeles, 288 F.3d 391 (9th Cir. 2002), to buttress other aspects of their intervention motions.  \nWith regard to timeliness, however, that case also supports the proposition that a complaint can \nprovide notice.  There, the Los Angeles Police Protective League (the “PPL”) “submitted the \nmotion to intervene within weeks of the filing of the complaint and before any orders regarding \nthe Proposed Decree ha[d] been entered.”  Order Denying PPL’s Mot. to Intervene at 7, United \nStates v. City of Los Angeles, 00 Civ. 11769 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 5, 2001), Docket No. 58.  Although \nno individual officers were named as defendants, the PPL was motivated to seek intervention by \nthe complaint’s inclusion of allegations of police misconduct and the possibility of a threat to \n \n31\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 32 of 108\ncollective bargaining rights by the proposed consent decree.  City of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d at \n399.  Thus, the district court found the motion to be timely, which was “not challenged on \nappeal.”  Id. at 397.  Unlike Floyd and Ligon, the PPL moved to intervene when misconduct was \nmerely alleged in the complaint, rather than after the allegations had been proven at trial.  The \nPPL also did not await the district court’s issuance of a remedial order and instead sought \nintervention the moment remedies were proposed.  Rather than supporting the Unions’ position, \nCity of Los Angeles underscores their untimeliness—unlike the diligent PPL, the Unions here \nneglected their alleged interests until after they were adjudicated.   \nii.  Class Certification \nClass certification has been held to provide notice given the public nature of that process.  \nSee, e.g., D’Amato, 236 F.3d at 84 (where parties sought to certify a settlement class, district \ncourt’s order that notice be sent to class members and pending fairness hearing alerted proposed \nintervenors of their interests); Hnot, 2006 WL 3476746, at *3 (district court’s class certification \norder notified potential class member seeking to alter the class definition of her interests). \nDaniels, Floyd, and Ligon each produced published opinions on class certification that \nwere the subject of extensive briefing.  In Daniels, the Court certified a class on January 25, \n2001 and found that the “named plaintiffs are seeking money damages for themselves but are \nonly seeking declaratory and equitable relief for the class they wish to represent.”  Daniels v. \nCity of New York, 198 F.R.D. 409, 416 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).  Similarly in Floyd, after extensive \nbriefing, the Court granted class certification on May 16, 2012, approving of plaintiffs’ objective \nto “seek equitable relief in the form of (1) a declaration that defendants’ policies, practices, \nand/or customs violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and (2) a class-wide injunction \nmandating significant changes in those policies, practices, and/or customs.”  Floyd v. City of New \n \n32\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 33 of 108\nYork, 283 F.R.D. 153, 159 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).  The Court certified a class consisting of  \n[a]ll persons who since January 31, 2005 have been, or in the future will be, \nsubjected  to  the  New  York  Police  Department’s  policies  and/or  widespread \ncustoms or practices of stopping, or stopping and frisking, persons in the absence \nof a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity has taken, is taking, or \nis about to take place in violation of the Fourth Amendment, including persons \nstopped or stopped and frisked on the basis of being Black or Latino in violation \nof the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nId. at 160.  The class definition dictates that evaluating police behavior would form a large part \nof plaintiffs’ case.  Furthermore, the Court noted that there was an issue of “[w]hether the \n‘performance goals’ are accurately characterized as ‘quotas’ under the New York Labor Law” \nwhich “is surely important to the NYPD and to police officers and their union.”  283 F.R.D. at \n164.  Thus, the Court explicitly recognized what the Unions should have—that stop-and-frisk \npolicies that might affect the Unions’ alleged interests were under consideration.  In Ligon, on \nFebruary 11, 2013, in a published opinion, the Court certified a class consisting of  \n[a]ll individuals who have been or are at risk of being stopped outdoors within the \nvicinity of Bronx apartment buildings enrolled in the NYPD’s Trespass Affidavit \nProgram  (commonly  referred  to  as  “Operation  Clean  Halls”)  without  legal \njustification by NYPD officers on suspicion of trespassing in said buildings. \n \nLigon v. City of New York, 288 F.R.D. 72, 83 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).  The opinion signaled the \nexistence of the same remedial issues that concern the Unions now.  Class certification is a \npublic exercise intended to notify individuals that their rights are being adjudicated.  In certifying \na class in each case, the Court put the City and its residents on notice of what was at stake.  Yet, \nthe Unions offer no explanation for how they remained unaware of these significant events.   \niii.  Litigating Important Motions and Issues \nThe litigation of important motions and other significant case developments have also \nbeen held to provide notice.  See, e.g., MasterCard Int’l, 471 F.3d at 390 (motion for preliminary \ninjunctive relief “publicly available for anyone to access” should have alerted proposed \n \n33\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 34 of 108\nintervenor of its interest); Catanzano, 103 F.3d at 233 (district court’s publication of its \npreliminary injunction order, which contained the remedy the would-be intervenors sought to \nchallenge, provided sufficient notice to them of their interest).  The Unions argue that they were \ncaught off-guard by the factual findings and legal analysis in the Liability and Remedial Orders.  \nHowever, as demonstrated in the discussion that follows, the substantive issues therein were \nraised and disputed by the parties long before August 2013. \n(a) Daniels:  the DOJ’s Attempt to Intervene  \nAmongst the numerous published decisions on substantial motions in Daniels, on April \n12, 2001, the court denied the DOJ’s motion to intervene in order to access discovery for its own \ninvestigation of NYPD stop-and-frisk practices.  Daniels, 200 F.R.D. at 210.  The investigation \nbegan in March 1999 after the widely publicized shooting death of Amadou Diallo, “an unarmed \nand law-abiding African immigrant . . . [who] was killed when four members of the SCU fired \n41 bullets at him in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building, striking him 19 times.”  \nDaniels Compl. ¶ 40; Shudofsky Decl. ¶ 2, Daniels, ECF No. 93-1.  In conjunction with the \ninvestigation, the City had voluntarily provided the DOJ several years of UF-250 data.  \nShudofsky Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.  However, the City ceased providing such data for stops that occurred \nafter March 2009.  Id. ¶ 5.  In denying the motion, the court reasoned that the DOJ could obtain \nthe discovery through its own lawsuit against the City.  Daniels, 200 F.R.D. at 209.  Although \nthe DOJ’s motion was unsuccessful, its attempt to intervene demonstrates that non-parties were \naware of the stakes and, unlike the Unions, actively sought to be involved. \n(b) Floyd Discovery  \nThe Unions claim that it was unforeseeable that the Court would find that “over an eight-\nyear period, at least 200,000 stops conducted by NYPD officers were  unconstitutional and that \n \n34\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 35 of 108\nofficers intentionally targeted minorities, based solely on a purported statistical analysis of UF-\n250 forms, and without any consideration of the totality of the unique circumstances of each of \nthe 4.4 million stops at issue . . . .”  SBA Reply Mem. 12.  In addition, the Unions allege that is \nwas unforeseeable that the Court would find that “several specific members of the [Unions] had \ncommitted unconstitutional stops and/or frisks.”  PBA Mem. 14.  The Unions ignore the fact that \nduring pretrial proceedings the parties vigorously litigated (1) the admissibility of plaintiffs’ \nexpert’s statistical data and conclusions and (2) plaintiffs’ allegations that particular stops-and-\nfrisks were unlawful.  That these issues would be addressed during trial and that the Court would \nbe tasked with making definitive rulings on them cannot be described as unexpected.  In essence, \nthe Unions’ real complaint is that they simply could not foresee the Court disagreeing with the \nCity’s position on these issues.  \nIn Floyd, fact discovery proceeded for more than two-and-a-half years and included \nnumerous extensive discovery disputes, production of voluminous material, and dozens of \ndepositions.  Based upon the discovery produced and the parties’ pretrial filings, it was entirely \nforeseeable that at trial plaintiffs would present wide-ranging statistical evidence based on \nFagan’s analysis of UF-250s and that plaintiffs would introduce evidence regarding particular \nstops-and-frisks.  With respect to the statistical evidence, on April 16, 2012, in a published \nopinion the Court granted in part and denied in part the Floyd defendants’ motion to exclude \nFagan’s expert report and testimony (the “April 16 Order”).  Floyd v. City of New York, 861 F. \nSupp. 2d 274, 304 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).  The nature and content of his proposed testimony were \naddressed in what the Court described as “voluminous” briefing leading up to the April 16 Order.  \nSee Floyd, 283 F.R.D. at 160.  The April 16 Order ruled admissible Fagan’s (1) opinions about \nthe process by which officers complete UF-250s and about the outcomes of the stops; (2) \n \n35\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 36 of 108\nanalysis of UF-250s to determine whether millions of stops were justified; and (3) conclusions \nregarding the significance of race and ethnicity.  Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 289-90, 292-93, 304.   \nWith respect to the individual stops analyzed in the Liability Order, that such analysis \nwould occur was also entirely foreseeable.  Dozens of union members were deposed during \ndiscovery where they were likely questioned about allegations of unlawful conduct, training, \nsupervision, and other topics in the lawsuit.  Presumably, plaintiffs’ purpose in deposing police \nwitnesses was to gather information about specific stops in order to prove plaintiffs’ claims at \ntrial.  Thus, it was unsurprising that in the Court’s summary judgment opinion, as with the \nLiability Order, the Court evaluated specific stops to determine whether they were indicative of a \ncity-wide policy.  Floyd v. City of New York, 813 F. Supp. 2d. 417, 443-46 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).  \nFinally, based on the parties’ pre-trial submissions, it was clear that plaintiffs intended to \nintroduce at trial information regarding particular stops as evidence of a city-wide policy.  \nAlthough the Unions could not have predicted how the Court would rule on Fagan’s testimony or \non the individual stops, the Unions simply cannot claim to be surprised by the evidence \npresented by plaintiffs and relied upon by the Court.  See PBA Mem. 5-6, Floyd, ECF No. 445 \n(criticizing the Court’s reliance on Fagan’s trial testimony).  Given that plaintiffs’ evidence was \nvetted well before trial, the Unions’ delay appears to have been based on their gamble that the \nCity’s position on these issues would prevail.     \n(c) Floyd Summary Judgment \nOn August 31, 2011, in a published opinion, the Court granted in part and denied in part \ndefendants’ (some of whom were union members) motion for summary judgment, finding that \nthere existed genuine issues of material fact as to whether there were NYPD policies governing \nofficer training, supervision, monitoring, and discipline that enabled a widespread practice of \n \n36\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 37 of 108\nsuspicionless and race-based stops-and-frisks attributable to the City.  Floyd, 813 F. Supp. 2d. at \n417.  In particular, the Court found “that the questionable constitutionality of 30 percent of stops \nis sufficient to allege that the custom [of suspicionless stops-and-frisks] is widespread.”  Id. at \n446.  Moreover, in evaluating plaintiffs’ claims that the NYPD mandated quotas to encourage \nofficers to perform otherwise suspicionless stops-and-frisks, the Court considered evidence that \nin May 2004, the PBA filed a labor grievance on behalf of six officers and one sergeant who \nwere transferred for allegedly failing to meet a ten summons-per-month quota.  Id. at 426.  The \nCourt noted that in January 2006, a labor arbitrator found that the NYPD had imposed summons \nquotas in violation of New York labor laws.  Id.  This observation is significant not only because \nit was a public acknowledgment of the Unions’ potential interest in this litigation, but also \nbecause it suggests that the Unions were aware of the substantive issues in Floyd as early as \n2004.  Yet, even when the Court highlighted the 2006 labor arbitrator’s finding as Floyd was \nheaded to trial, the Unions did not seek to intervene. \n(d) Ligon Injunction Order      \nLess than a month after the complaint was filed in Ligon, plaintiffs informed the Court \nthat they would seek a preliminary injunction to halt unconstitutional trespass stops around TAP \nbuildings in the Bronx.  The parties submitted briefs and motions in limine, and the Court held a \nmulti-day evidentiary hearing, after which the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law.  Over the course of seven days in October and November 2012, the Court \nconsidered a variety evidence including (1) testimony from a Bronx assistant district attorney \nwho concluded that the NYPD frequently made trespass stops outside TAP buildings for no \nreason other than that the officer had seen someone enter and exit or exit a building; (2) “a \nsample of ‘decline to prosecute’ forms prepared by the Bronx District Attorneys’ Office which \n \n37\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 38 of 108\nrevealed the alarming frequency of unlawful trespass stops in the vicinity of TAP buildings in \nthe Bronx;” (3) testimony from eight plaintiffs and a non-party witness who “described \nremarkably similar encounters with the police when stopped in the vicinity of TAP buildings in \nthe Bronx;” (4) an analysis by Fagan of trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx; and \n(5) evidence from NYPD training materials that misstated the minimal constitutional standards \nfor making stops.  Ligon, 925 F. Supp. 2d at 485.  The Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction on January 8, 2013, finding that they had shown a “clear likelihood of \nproving” that the City, by its deliberate indifference, had a policy of conducting unlawful stops \noutside of TAP buildings.  Id.  The Injunction Order prohibited the NYPD from “performing \ntrespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx without reasonable suspicion of trespass, in \naccordance with the law as set forth and clarified in this Opinion.”  Id. at 542.  By its terms, the \nInjunction Order directly addressed officer conduct and many of the same issues that were \nadjudicated in the Floyd trial.  Yet, despite the imposition of injunctive relief, in part on the basis \nof union member conduct, the Unions did not move to intervene or otherwise express any \nconcerns about how the relief might affect their members. \n(e) Dismissal of Individual Defendants in Floyd \nAs the Floyd trial neared, the parties agreed to resolve an issue that is critical to the \nUnions’ proposed intervention to protect its members’ alleged reputational interests.  On March \n8, 2013, the parties stipulated to dismiss all claims against the remaining individual officer \ndefendants with prejudice.  Floyd, ECF No. 270.  This event stands apart because it signaled that \nthe conduct of individual NYPD officers would be adjudicated at trial with no remaining \ndefendant necessarily protecting those interests.  Prior to March 8, 2013, the Corporation \nCounsel represented all Floyd defendants, from the individual officers to the police \n \n38\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 39 of 108\ncommissioner and the mayor.  The Corporation Counsel is the “attorney and counsel for the city \nand every agency thereof and shall have charge and conduct of all the law business of the city \nand its agencies.”  N.Y.C. Charter § 394(a).  Appointed by the mayor, the Corporation Counsel is \nthe only office holder authorized to represent the legal interests of the City.  Id. §§ 6, 391.  In \ncivil actions where both the City and its employees are named as defendants, the Corporation \nCounsel must represent the City, and it may elect to represent individual employees, so long as \nthe Corporation Counsel is satisfied that the employees were acting within the scope of their \nemployment and there is no ethical conflict of interest in representing co-defendants.  N.Y. Gen. \nMun. Law § 50-k; see also Mercurio v. City of New York, 758 F.2d 862, 864-65 (2d Cir. 1985); \nLamberti v. Metro. Transp. Auth., 170 A.D.2d 224, 225 (1st Dep’t 1991). \nThe Second Circuit has observed the inherent conflict of interest in 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nlawsuits where plaintiffs seek recovery against both a municipality and individual municipal \nemployees.  See Dunton v. Suffolk Cnty., 729 F.2d 903, 907 (2d Cir. 1984), amended, 748 F.2d \n69 (2d Cir. 1984); Patterson v. Balsamico, 440 F.3d 104, 114 (2d Cir. 2006).  The conflict exists \n“because a municipality may avoid liability by showing that the employee was not acting within \nthe scope of his official duties while the employee, by contrast, may partially or completely \navoid liability by showing that he was acting within the scope of his official duties.”  Patterson, \n440 F.3d at 114 (alternations, citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  However, where \nthe Corporation Counsel represents both the City and individual officers pursuant to its \ndiscretion under N.Y. General Municipal Law 50-k, “it would not be in the City’s interest to . . . \nplace blame on” the individual employees.  Mercado v. City of New York, 08 Civ. 2855, 2010 \nWL 3910594, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2010).  Here, in agreeing to represent both the City and \nthe individual officers, the Corporation Counsel was presumably satisfied that the officers were \n \n39\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 40 of 108\nacting within the scope of their employment and that there was no ethical conflict that would \nhave required the appointment of separate counsel.  N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law § 50-k; see also \nMercurio, 758 F.2d at 864-65.  The Corporation Counsel could not simultaneously represent \nthese municipal employees and repudiate their conduct.  \nThus, the Corporation Counsel’s decision to represent Officers Rodriguez, Goodman, \nHernandez, Joyce, Pichardo, Salmeron, Hayes, Moran and Sergeant Kelly in Floyd signals that at \nleast until March 8, 2013, the City believed that the officer conduct at issue—allegedly \nunconstitutional stops-and-frisks—was lawful conduct within the scope of the defendant \nofficers’ employment.  Moreover, by agreeing to represent these officers, the City implicitly \nsanctioned all similar NYPD officer conduct as part of its Monell litigation strategy.  In addition \nto the ethical incentive to protect the named officer defendants, the Corporation Counsel had a \nstrategic incentive to protect the interests of all officers who were acting pursuant to their \nmunicipal employer’s directives.  However, after March 8, 2013, when the officer defendants \nwere dismissed from Floyd, the City was no longer compelled to look after the interests of any \nofficers, named or unnamed.  Instead, the City could concede officer misconduct and argue that \nit did not evidence a widespread pattern or practice attributable to City policy.  Any such \nmisconduct, the City could argue, would be attributable to rogue officers acting contrary to City \npolicy.  Thus, when plaintiffs agreed to withdraw their claims against the remaining officer \ndefendants, the Unions’ alleged interest in protecting NYPD officers’ reputations became, in the \nUnions’ terms, “crystallize[d].”  SBA Reply Mem. 13.  As of March 8, 2013, the Corporation \nCounsel was not obligated to represent anyone’s reputational interests other than the City’s. \nA review of the City’s post-trial filings demonstrates that the possibility of the City \nadopting this strategy was genuine.  In their post-trial briefs, the City repeatedly argued that the \n \n40\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 41 of 108\nevidence of officer wrongdoing was sparse and “anecdotal,” repudiating plaintiffs’ claim that it \nwas widespread.  Additionally, the City argued that plaintiffs had failed to show a systemic \npattern or practice of unconstitutional behavior and that evidence of such a pattern or practice \nwas based on unreliable information contributed by “a very few disgruntled officers.”  Def. Post-\nTrial Mem. 9-10, Floyd, ECF No. 364.  Given their purported status as protectors of police \nofficer interests generally, the Unions should have recognized that at the moment the named \nofficer defendants were no longer represented by the Corporation Counsel, the City would no \nlonger protect their interests.  The Unions, after all, “are not poor, ignorant people whose rights \nhave to be protected.”  Farmland Diaries, 847 F.2d at 1044.  When the officer defendants were \ndismissed from Floyd, it should have been obvious to the Unions that plaintiffs’ Monell claims \nwould necessarily implicate union member conduct with no guarantee that the sole remaining \ndefendant, the City, would safeguard union members’ reputational interests. \niv.  Resolution Process \nThe Second Circuit has repeatedly emphasized that an intervenor’s awareness of the \nprocess of negotiating a resolution of a case is an important factor in determining notice.  See, \ne.g., In re Holocaust Victim Assets Litig., 225 F.3d at 198 (affirming denial of intervention as \nuntimely when proposed intervenors knew of extensive negotiations leading up to settlement \nagreement and had submitted written objections to the settlement but waited until eight months \nafter preliminary approval to intervene); Pitney Bowes, 25 F.3d at 71 (affirming denial of \nintervention, in part, because movant had notice that the parties had negotiated for eight months \nbefore reaching the final agreement the movant sought to challenge). \n(a) Daniels Settlement \nAlthough the settlement in Daniels is not dispositive as to the timing of the Unions’ \n \n41\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 42 of 108\nmotions to intervene in Floyd and Ligon, it is noteworthy for the fact that the Unions never \nsought intervention in Daniels when the settlement was negotiated, entered, or implemented.  On \nJanuary 13, 2004, the Court approved a stipulation of settlement.  Stipulation, Daniels, ECF No. \n152.  Plaintiffs agreed to release their class claims, and the City agreed to (1) implement stop-\nand-frisk audit procedures and apprise class counsel of the results on an ongoing basis; (2) revise \nsupervisory trainings for new sergeants and lieutenants to address racial profiling concerns and \nmaintain that as part of the Police Academy curriculum; (3) provide annual training on the \nNYPD’s racial profiling policy; (4) ensure that all stop-and-frisk incidents would be documented \non a revised UF-250 and provide class counsel with quarterly results; and (5) conduct joint \ncommunity forums and workshops at select high schools to educate the public about the NYPD’s \nracial profiling policy and the rights of citizens.  Id.  The Daniels settlement was published in \nthree newspapers and remained in effect through December 31, 2007.  Aff. of Publication, \nDaniels, ECF No. 150.  Although the settlement implicated the same day-to-day job duties now \nat issue, the Unions never moved to intervene.  Tellingly, the Unions have given no indication to \nthe Court that implementation of the Daniels settlement adversely affected their members’ \nreputations or the Unions’ ability to collectively bargain with the City.  \n(b) Remedial Relief Ordered in Floyd and Ligon \nAlthough not a settlement or consent decree, the Remedial Order was the product of \nmonths of input from the parties and other stakeholders.  See Floyd, ECF Nos. 268 (Pl. \nPermanent Injunctive Relief Mem.), 276 (Def. Opposition to Permanent Injunctive Relief), 364 \n(Def. Post-Trial Mem.), 365 (DOJ Statement of Interest), 367 (Pl. Post-Trial Mem.); Ligon, ECF \nNos. 108 (Pl. Post-Hearing Br. on Remedial Relief), 109 (Def. Br. on Remedial Relief), 112 \n(Def. Proposed Remedial Relief), 117 (Pl. Br. Concerning Def. Remedial Proposals), 118 (Def. \n \n42\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 43 of 108\nReply Mem. on Remedial Relief).  In the Injunction Order, the Court proposed specific changes \nto policies, procedures, supervision, and training and invited the parties to brief “whether the \nproposed relief is insufficient or too burdensome or otherwise inappropriate.”  925 F. Supp. 2d at \n543.  The parties briefed the issues over the next several months, and in a filing dated April 11, \n2013, the City indicated that although it intended to appeal the Injunction Order, it did not object \nto the remedial measures.  Def. Br. on Remedial Relief, Ligon, ECF No. 109.   \nBecause of “overlapping [remedial] issues raised in the three cases,” on January 31, 2013, \nthe Court held a joint hearing in Floyd, Ligon, and Davis v. City of New York, 10 Civ. 699 \n(S.D.N.Y. filed Jan. 28, 2010)—another putative class action challenging stop-and-frisk tactics \nin and around New York City public housing.  Jan. 31, 2013 Hearing Tr. at 6:13-21, Floyd, ECF \nNo. 406.  In addition to affirming the decision not to bifurcate the Floyd trial, the Court \nrequested that the parties brief the scope of any remedial injunction that would follow, assuming \nplaintiffs proved liability at trial.  Id. at 23:6-24.  Thus, with respect to Floyd, the Court made \nclear that the liability and remedial issues would be tried together and that the Floyd and Ligon \nremedies would similarly be bound together.   \nAlthough the Unions seemed to have missed the Court’s cue that remedies were actively \nbeing considered as early as January 2013, another stakeholder got the message.  On June 12, \n2013, the DOJ submitted a “Statement of Interest” in Floyd.  Floyd, ECF No. 365.  The DOJ \noutlined the legal basis for and endorsed the appointment of a monitor if plaintiffs prevailed at \ntrial.  Id.  The DOJ noted that while it “would have preferred to file this brief if, and only if, the \nCourt finds that [p]laintiffs have met their burden to establish liability” in the Floyd trial, it \nrecognized that “because the Court has denied [p]laintiffs’ requests to bifurcate the liability and \nremedy phases” of the Floyd trial, “the United States makes this filing at this time.”  Id. at 1 n.1.  \n \n43\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 44 of 108\nThis footnote speaks volumes.  First, it shows that non-party stakeholders were aware that the \nCourt was considering liability and remedial issues simultaneously and that the time to speak up \nhad arrived.  Second, it shows that earlier than August 2013, other stakeholders were aware that \nthe appointment of an independent monitor was a significant possibility.  Although the Unions \nnow take issue with the appointment of a monitor, they do not explain why they sat on the \nsidelines while the parties and non-parties discussed this and other remedies.   \nv.  Publicity \nIt is uncontroverted that publicity surrounding a lawsuit may provide notice to potential \nintervenors that their interests are at issue.  See NAACP, 413 U.S. at 366-67; see also In re Bank \nof New York Derivative Litig., 320 F.3d at 300 (shareholder-intervenors had notice of their \ninterests where the lawsuit had been pending for more than two years and had “garnered no small \namount of media attention”); Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 74 Fed. R. Serv. 3d at 1488 \n(extensive media attention alerted intervenors of their interest in being included in the class). \nThere is no dispute that the issues at the heart of Floyd and Ligon are matters of broad \npublic concern that have generated significant media attention.  Their predecessor, Daniels, and \nthe DOJ’s investigation of the City at that time, were both triggered by the extensively publicized \nshooting death of Amadou Diallo, “an unarmed and law-abiding African immigrant . . . [who] \nwas killed when four members of the [Street Crimes Unit] fired 41 bullets at him in the vestibule \nof his Bronx apartment building, striking him 19 times.”  Compl. ¶ 40, Daniels, ECF No. 1; \nShudofsky Decl. ¶ 2, Daniels, (Feb. 1, 2001), ECF No. 93.  Once Daniels settled, the notice of \nsettlement was widely published, and a public hearing was held at which no objections were \nmade.  Daniels, ECF No. 150; Dec. 12, 2003 Hearing Tr. at 5:22-24, Daniels, ECF No. 154.  \n \n44\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 45 of 108\nSimilarly, the pretrial publicity surrounding Floyd and Ligon should have provided the \nUnions sufficient notice that their alleged interests might be implicated, as evidenced by the fact \nthat several other non-party stakeholders requested to be heard by the Court.  See, e.g., Charney \nDecl. Exs. J, K, M (news articles reporting on events in the Floyd and Ligon actions).  For \nexample, during the class certification debate, five non-profit groups and twenty-seven New \nYork City Council members signed on to amicus briefs.  As noted above, the DOJ submitted a \nStatement of Interest two months prior to the issuance of Liability and Remedial Orders to \nexplain its views on the appointment of an independent monitor.  Floyd, ECF No. 365.  If these \nvarious stakeholders had sufficient notice of these cases, it is implausible that the Unions did not.   \nA highly publicized trial in Floyd occurred over the course of two months in which thirty \npolice officers, ten sergeants, ten lieutenants, three captains, four deputy inspectors and seven \ninspectors testified regarding their job duties, workload, method of documenting and reviewing \nstops, and other subjects such as how officers are trained and supervised in stops-and-frisks and \nracial profiling.  Def. Findings of Fact ¶¶ 23, 25-33, 43-49, Floyd, ECF No. 363; Pl. Findings of \nFact ¶¶ 86-107, 122-136, Floyd, ECF No. 366.  There was also testimony presented at trial that \nfrom 2010 to 2013, the Unions filed nine grievances against the NYPD alleging that officers \nwere subject to adverse employment actions as a result of their failure to meet the same \nperformance quotas that the Floyd plaintiffs were litigating.  Floyd Trial Tr. 3399:21-3402:17; \n6790:25-6791:3.  Yet, at no point prior to or during the trial did the Unions move to intervene.   \nc.  Conclusion:  Constructive Notice Predates August 2013 \nIn sum, the Unions should have known for years—but by March 8, 2013, at the latest—\nthat their members’ alleged reputational interests and the Unions’ collective bargaining interests \nwere being litigated by parties who were not invested in protecting those interests.  Although \n \n45\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 46 of 108\ncourts generally accept as true an applicant’s well-pleaded, non-conclusory allegations on a \nmotion to intervene, see Bay Casino, LLC, 199 F.R.D. at 466, this does not permit courts to turn \na blind eye where the allegations are contradicted or unsupported by “credible” proof, see United \nParcel Serv. of Am., Inc. v. The Net, Inc., 225 F.R.D. 416, 422 (E.D.N.Y. 2005), or are unproven \nby a “clear showing,” see United States v. Int’l Tel. & Tel. Corp., 349 F. Supp 22, 27 n.4 (D. \nConn. 1972).  The Unions’ claim that they first learned of their unrepresented interests in these \nactions in August 2013 is unconvincing because “there is evidence that [the Unions] should have \nknown the suit[s] could impact [their] interests” long before.  See Heartwood, 316 F.3d at 701.  \nThe Unions did not move to intervene when the Daniels settlement was proposed or \nimplemented in 2004, and they did not request amicus status in order to provide comment.  With \nregard to Floyd, the Unions did not move to intervene when the complaint was filed seeking the \nsame relief the Unions now wish to place at issue, when the class was certified, or when the \nsummary judgment motion was decided.  The Unions also ignored the proceedings in Ligon and \nthe pretrial proceedings in Floyd, where, as early as January 2013, the Court discussed the scope \nof the remedies under consideration for both cases and stated that the evidence related to \nremedies in Floyd would be presented at trial alongside liability evidence.  Finally, the Unions \nlet pass without comment March 8, 2013, the date when the City ceased representing the \nindividual officers and was no longer required to consider their interests.  The recitation of the \nhistories of Daniels, Floyd, and Ligon demonstrates that the Unions’ delay should not be \nmeasured from August 2013, but rather from many months, if not years, earlier.  \n2.  Prejudice to Existing Parties \n  Although notice of an applicant’s unrepresented interest is important, it is not \ndispositive.  See NAACP, 413 U.S. at 365-66.  Rather, “[i]t is firmly established that the most \n \n46\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 47 of 108\nsignificant criterion in determining timeliness is whether the delay in moving for intervention has \nprejudiced any of the existing parties.”  United States v. Int’l Bus. Machines Corp., 62 F.R.D. \n530, 541-42 (S.D.N.Y. 1974) (citations omitted); see also Citizens for an Orderly Energy Policy, \nInc. v. Suffolk Cnty., 101 F.R.D. 497, 501 (E.D.N.Y. 1984).  \n  The Unions claim that Plaintiffs and the City will suffer no prejudice because the Unions \nonly seek to participate in future proceedings, such as an appeal to the Second Circuit.  Plaintiffs \ncontend that intervention at this stage would be severely prejudicial, emphasizing a need for \nfinality after five years (or fifteen counting Daniels) of resource-intensive litigation and the harm \nof delaying remediation of longstanding constitutional violations.     \nThe prejudice to the Floyd plaintiffs and the City is self-evident.  Plaintiffs have invested \nsignificant time and resources in these cases.  After years of pretrial proceedings and a two-\nmonth trial in Floyd, liability has been established against the City.  Now the City has agreed to \nimplement, in large part, the very reforms plaintiffs have been fighting for.  Having prevailed to \nthis extent, plaintiffs face significant prejudice if previously uninterested late-comers are \npermitted to prolong the legal wrangling and further delay plaintiffs’ hard-won relief. \nFor the City, the prejudice that may result from the Unions’ proposed intervention is \ntwofold.  The Unions seek an appeal the City no longer wants to pursue in order to vindicate a \npolicy the City no longer wants to implement.  The right to decide whether to settle a lawsuit \nagainst the City or to prosecute an appeal is vested in the City’s chief lawyer, the Corporation \nCounsel, and its chief executive, the mayor.  Both have indicated that the City is poised to “end \nthe years-long legal battle”12 and reform the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practices that the Court \nfound unconstitutional.  Granting intervention would permit the Unions to infringe upon the \n                         \n12 Press Release, “Mayor de Blasio Announces Agreement in Landmark Stop-and-Frisk Case,” \nJan. 30, 2014, Charney Decl. Ex. L, Floyd, ECF No. 450-12. \n \n47\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 48 of 108\nCity’s prerogative to determine policing policy as manifested in its litigation strategy.   \nFinally, both plaintiffs and the City are prejudiced to the extent the Unions seek to \nrepresent the interests of officers who were previously defendants in Floyd.  Some of the officers \nmentioned by name in the Liability Order were also defendants in this action.  As discussed, \nthese officer defendants consented to their dismissal from Floyd with prejudice.  Thus, it would \nbe highly prejudicial to allow the Unions to resurrect the alleged interests of officers who have \nalready left the lawsuit.  Rule 24 was not intended to create a revolving door where parties can \ncome and go as litigation strategies shift.     \n3.  Prejudice to Proposed Intervenors \nThe Court finds no tangible prejudice to the Unions in denying their motions to intervene. \nAs discussed below, the Unions assert no legally colorable interest, and even if they were \nallowed to intervene, they lack standing to appeal the Injunction, Liability, and Remedial Orders. \n4.  Conclusion:  the Motions to Intervene are Untimely   \nIn light of the length of the delay, the Unions’ failure to offer any reasonable explanation, \nthe significant prejudice to the Floyd plaintiffs and the City, and the lack of prejudice to the \nUnions, “intervention on the part of late-arrivers must yield” to the existing parties’ desire for \nfinality.  Farmland Diaries, 847 F.2d at 1044-45 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nAccordingly, the Unions’ motions to intervene are denied as untimely.13  Although the motions’ \nuntimeliness is sufficient to justify denial of intervention, the Court also finds that the Unions \nlack any significant protectable interests in these actions, and even if they had such interests, the \nUnions lack standing to pursue the appeals they seek.  The Court now turns to each of these \nissues.   \n                         \n13 For the same reasons, the Unions’ motions to intervene for the purpose of appealing the \nInjunction, Liability, and Remedial Orders are also denied as untimely under Rule 24(b).  See \nNAACP, 413 U.S. at 365; United States v. New York, 820 F.2d at 557-58.  \n \n48\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 49 of 108\nC.  Significant Protectable Interest  \nRule 24(a)(2) provides for intervention as of right where the applicant “claims an interest \nrelating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a).  \nAlthough the applicant “need not have an independent cause of action,” United States v. \nPalermino, 238 F.R.D. 118, 121 (D. Conn. 2006), the interest must be “a legal interest as \ndistinguished from interests of a general and indefinite character.”  Mountain Top Condo. Ass’n \nv. Dave Stabbert Master Builder, Inc., 72 F.3d 361, 366 (3d Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  “An interest that is remote from the subject matter of the proceeding, or that is \ncontingent upon the occurrence of a sequence of events before it becomes colorable, will not \nsatisfy the rule.”  Brennan v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 260 F.3d 123, 129 (2d Cir. 2001) (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).  Instead, it “must be direct, substantial, and legally \nprotectable.”  Bridgeport Guardians v. Delmonte, 602 F.3d 469, 473 (2d Cir. 2010) (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).   \nHere, the Unions allege interests in the liability phase of Floyd and the remedial phase of \nFloyd and Ligon.  Although the Floyd liability phase ended when the Court issued the Liability \nOrder, the Unions argue that they can vindicate their reputational interests by appealing the \nLiability Order.  Similarly, although the Remedial Order has been issued, the Unions argue that \ntheir interests therein can also be vindicated on appeal.  The Court turns first to the Unions’ \ninterests in the merits, i.e., intervention for the purpose of appealing the Liability Order.    \n1.  The Unions’ Alleged Interests in the Merits \nPlaintiffs in Floyd set out to prove the following at trial:  (1) that each of the named \nplaintiffs had been stopped, questioned, and/or frisked on the basis of their race and without \nreasonable articulable suspicion, or would be in the future; and (2) that the stops that were or \n \n49\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 50 of 108\nwould be experienced by plaintiffs and all class members were the result of policies, customs, \nand practices of the City that encourage, sanction, and fail to prevent unconstitutional stops-and-\nfrisks.  Joint Pre-trial Mem. 6-7, Floyd, ECF 271.  To prove or disprove these claims, plaintiffs \nand the City called many witnesses, including civilians, NYPD officers, senior NYPD officials, \nand experts and introduced volumes of documentary evidence.  In particular, plaintiffs \nintroduced evidence concerning nineteen individual stops, statistical evidence regarding the \nscope and pattern of 4.4 million stops during the relevant time period, and evidence concerning \nthe NYPD’s awareness of and response to unconstitutional stops.  On August 12, 2013, the Court \nissued the Liability Order in Floyd, holding that the City had a policy of conducting race-based, \nsuspicionless stops-and-frisks that violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  In so doing, \nthe Court made findings of fact and conclusions of law that assessed, credited, and discredited \nthe testimonial and documentary evidence presented, including evidence regarding numerous \nNYPD officers, many of whom were involved in the nineteen stops.  The Court also analyzed \nevidence with respect to plaintiffs’ claim that the NYPD was deliberately indifferent to the racial \ndisparities in the 4.4 million stops discussed at trial and to the suspicionless nature of thousands \nof stops.  The Court made no findings of liability against individual officers, but instead \nevaluated their testimony and conduct in the context of determining that the City had violated the \nConstitution.   \nThe Unions claim an interest in the merits of Floyd based on alleged reputational harm to \ntheir members resulting from the Court’s findings that officers participated in, or contributed to, \nunconstitutional stops-and-frisks.  The Unions argue that the Court erred in three ways:  (1) in \nconcluding that over an eight-year period, NYPD officers made at least 200,000 stops without \nreasonable suspicion; (2) in concluding that blacks are likely targeted for stops based on a lesser \n \n50\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 51 of 108\ndegree of objectively founded suspicion than whites; (3) and in relying “exclusively” on expert \nJeffrey A. Fagan’s statistical analysis of UF-250 forms in finding that stops lacked reasonable \nsuspicion.  See PBA Mem. 5; SBA Reply Mem. 12.  As a consequence, the Unions contend, the \nLiability Order “ha[s] chilled lawful and proactive police conduct” and “unfairly undermine[d] \npublic confidence” in the NYPD.  PBA Mem. 14.   \nAlthough the Court found only the City liable for the unconstitutional conduct, the \nUnions insist that the Court’s mere mention of incidents involving individual officers and its \nanalysis of their behavior “impugned the integrity of thousands” of union members.  PBA Reply \nMem. 2.  As such, the Unions urge that the Second Circuit must correct these errors and \nvindicate the reputation of all NYPD officers, especially those identified by name.  Unless and \nuntil this happens, the Unions contend, public safety and officer safety will remain compromised \nbecause officers will be “uncertain[]” and “hesitant” in policing the streets.  Alejandro Decl. ¶ \n26; see also SBA Mem. 13-14.  On appeal, the Unions will seek to invalidate the Injunction, \nLiability, and Remedial Orders in order to vacate the allegedly offensive findings. \nPlaintiffs argue that the Unions’ alleged reputational interests are not cognizable on a \nmotion to intervene.  The purported reputational injury that might result from the Court’s \nfinding that union members committed unlawful stops-and-frisks, Plaintiffs contend, is remote.  \nMoreover, Plaintiffs note that the Liability Order lays blame for widespread unconstitutional \nstops on the City and the NYPD’s institutional indifference, not on the malice or intentional \nracism of individual officers.  See Floyd, ECF No. 373 at 60-117, 177-92; Ligon, ECF No. 105 \nat 118-34.  Plaintiffs argue, therefore, that to the extent reputations have been besmirched, it is \nthe reputation of the City and the NYPD, not the Unions’ or their members’.  Plaintiffs maintain \nthat the Unions have no right to litigate the reputational interests of the City or its agency, the \n \n51\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 52 of 108\nNYPD, where the City declines to do so on appeal.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs contend that the \nUnions are incorrect in their claim that Plaintiffs’ pursuit of “injunctive relief against their \nmembers” creates a legally protectable interest.  The Floyd plaintiffs’ claims for money \ndamages against individual officer defendants were dismissed long ago, and plaintiffs seek only \ninjunctive relief against the City.  See Floyd, ECF No. 270.   \nWith respect to the Unions’ interests in the merits, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs.  The \nalleged reputational interests are not legally protectable, do not belong to the Unions, or are too \nconclusory and speculative to be colorable on a motion to intervene.  Brennan, 260 F.3d at 129.   \na.  The Applicant’s Burden \nThe burden to demonstrate a right to intervene, including a cognizable interest, is at all \ntimes on the applicant.  See In re NASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., 187 F.R.D. 465, 490 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1998); Diduck v. Kaszycki & Sons Contractors, Inc., 149 F.R.D. 55, 58 (S.D.N.Y. \n1993).  Here, the Unions frame their members’ alleged reputational interests in variety of ways:  \n  Court ordered “injunctive relief against . . . officers” provides an interest \nin the merits.  PBA Mem. 13. \n \n  The “allegations” or “findings” that officers “broke the law” impugns their \nintegrity.  SBA Mem. 13. \n \n  Findings in the Liability Order that there was inadequate supervision, \ninsufficient record-keeping, and a “culture of hostility,” “derogates the \ngeneral practices and performance of” officers.  Id. \n  \n  “[F]actual  allegations  of  unconstitutional  conduct  that  have  already \ntarnished [officers’] careers.”  SBA Reply Mem. 1.  \n \n  “[H]ighly injurious finding[s] that . . . officers had engaged in intentional \nracial discrimination.”  PBA Mem. 2. \n \n  Findings of “widespread constitutional violations, including intentional \nracial discrimination, impose upon them serious reputational harm.”  Id. \n22. \n \n \n52\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 53 of 108\n  If  findings  of  wrongdoing  against  sergeants  mentioned  by  name– \nSergeants  Korabel,  Kelly,  Houlahan,  Stukes,  Telford,  and  Loria–are \n“conceded by the City on behalf of the NYPD and its officers,” it “would \nadversely affect the careers and lives of these SBA members, and cast \ndoubt on the ability of other members to perform their duties effectively \nwhile avoiding similar accusations in the future, which in turn affects \nofficer and public safety.”  SBA Mem. 13-14. \n \nIn all variations listed, the Unions offer only conclusory allegations without any supporting \nfactual details.  See Hobson v. Hansen, 44 F.R.D. 18, 25 (D.D.C. 1968) (“[P]etitioners have an \nobligation to set forth their interest with clarity.”).  Although courts generally accept as true an \napplicant’s well-pleaded, non-conclusory claims on a motion to intervene, see Bay Casino, LLC, \n199 F.R.D. at 466, this does permit courts to turn a blind eye where the allegations are \ncontradicted or unsupported by “credible” proof, see The Net, 225 F.R.D. at 422, or are unproven \nby a “clear showing,” see Int’l Tel. & Tel. Corp., 349 F. Supp. 27 n.4.  See also Sch. Dist. of \nPhiladelphia v. Pennsylvania Milk Mktg. Bd., 160 F.R.D. 66, 68 (E.D. Pa. 1995) (denying \nintervention where applicant did not sufficiently explain its interest beyond conclusory \nstatements).   \nThe Unions present no evidence of the “serious reputational harm” that their members \nhave suffered or an explanation of how the findings are “highly injurious.”  Nor do the Unions \nprovide examples of how their members’ careers have been “tarnished,” “adversely affect[ed]” \nor how officer integrity has been impugned.  Such bare allegations fail to provide an adequate \ndescription of the nature of the interests, making a meaningful Rule 24 analysis by the Court \nimpossible.  See Flynn v. Hubbard, 782 F.2d 1084, 1093 (1st Cir. 1986) (“[C]onclusory \nallegations do not entitle [a movant] to intervention as of right under Rule 24.”) (Coffin, J. \nconcurring).  The Unions, therefore, have not met their burden of propounding non-conclusory \nallegations regarding their interests.  For this reason alone, their motions should be denied. \n \n53\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 54 of 108\nSetting aside these insufficiencies, the Unions’ claim of protectable reputational interests \nin this litigation also fails because (1) they assert interests that do not belong to them or their \nmembers; and (2) to the extent the alleged interests do belong to their members, the interests are \ntoo indirect to be colorable on a motion to intervene.  The Court addresses each issue in turn.   \nb.  Interests that Belong to the City, Not the Unions or their Members \nThe Unions contend that they have interests sufficient to warrant intervention because the \nCourt ordered “injunctive relief against their members.”  PBA Mem. 13.  They are legally and \nfactually mistaken.  In truth, the Court found that the City violated the law by turning a blind eye \nto police officers’ use of unconstitutional stop-and-frisk tactics.  Moreover, the court-imposed \ninjunction runs against the City, which must change its policy; it does not run against the Unions \nor their members apart from their employment with the City.  See Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 630 \nF.3d 898, 903-04 (9th Cir. 2011) (injunctive relief against government employer does not \nautomatically give government employee right to intervene because injunction ran only against \nemployer).   \nIt is uncontroverted that the interest Rule 24(a) requires “must be based on a right which \nbelongs to the proposed intervenor rather than to an existing party to the suit.”  Vazman v. \nFidelity Int’l Bank, 418 F. Supp. 1084, 1086 (S.D.N.Y. 1976) (internal quotation marks omitted); \nsee also United States v. South Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 922 F.2d 704, 710 (11th Cir. 1991) \n(“What is required is that the interest be one which the substantive law recognizes as belonging \nto or being owned by the applicant.”) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); Walker v. \nJones, 82 Civ. 2723, 1988 WL 73866, at *2 (D.D.C. July 1, 1988) (To justify intervention as a \nmatter of right, the movant’s interest must be an independent right which belongs to the \nintervenor rather than an existing party to the action.).  Vindicating the legality of City policy \n \n54\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 55 of 108\nand City employee conduct is an interest that belongs to the City.  That City employees happen \nto be members of a labor union does not alter or extinguish the City’s exclusive right to pursue \nits chosen litigation strategy.  See, e.g., Orange Env’t Inc. v. County of Orange, 817 F. Supp. \n1051, 1061 (S.D.N.Y. 1993), aff’d, 2 F.3d 1235 (2d Cir. 1993) (disagreement with an existing \nparty’s litigation strategy does not confer a right for a non-party to intervene).   \nThe Unions’ contention that all NYPD officers are besmirched by the Liability Order \nrests on the flawed assumption that anonymous officers who have not taken part in this litigation \nhave a reputational interest arising from the Court’s finding against their employer.  As a general \nmatter, employees suffer no legally protectable reputational harm merely because their employer \nis found liable in a lawsuit.  See, e.g., Mahoney v. Donovan, 824 F. Supp. 2d 49, 68 (D.D.C. \n2011) (“[T]hat an employer has violated a law says nothing about the character or reputation of \nany particular employee.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This principle derives from the \nlaw of agency, where an agent cannot suffer actionable injury based on a finding of liability \nagainst the principal.  As articulated by the First Circuit, the mere fact “that Party A, in a suit \nagainst Party B, intends to introduce evidence that will indicate that a non-party, C, behaved \nimproperly does not, by itself, make C a necessary party.”  Pujol v. Shearson Am. Exp., Inc., 877 \nF.2d 132, 136 (1st Cir. 1989) (Breyer, J.).14  The court reasoned that, “[g]iven the vast range of \npotential insults and allegations of impropriety that may be directed at non-parties in civil \nlitigation, a contrary view would greatly expand the universe” of parties.  Id.   \nPujol relied in part on the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Pasco International (London) \nLtd. v. Stenograph Corp., 637 F.2d 496 (7th Cir. 1980).  In Pasco, the complaint alleged that \ndefendant conspired with plaintiff’s employee to induce a breach of contract with a potential \n                         \n14 The Pujol court analyzed the agency issue on a Rule 19 joinder motion.  However, as \ndiscussed above, the analyses required for Rule 24 intervention and Rule 19 joinder “mirror each \nother.”  MasterCard, 471 F.3d at 390.  \n \n55\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 56 of 108\ncustomer and that plaintiff’s employee had “falsely disparage[ed]” plaintiff’s financial condition \nto the potential customer.  Id. at 499.  Defendant moved to dismiss on the ground that plaintiff \nfailed to join an indispensable party—plaintiff’s own employee.  The district court granted the \nmotion, but the Seventh Circuit reversed.  The Pasco court held that even though the action may \npotentially impact the employee’s business reputation, the employee was not an indispensable \nparty under Rule 19 because “[a]ny agent will suffer some adverse consequences when his \nprincipal is held vicariously liable on account of the agent’s conduct, but this is not a sufficient \ninterest.”  Id. at 502; see also Milligan v. Anderson, 522 F.2d 1202, 1203-05 (10th Cir. 1975) \n(Although the “gist of the complaint was that [the absentee], acting as an agent for [the \ndefendant], made false and fraudulent representations to the three plaintiffs,” the absentee was \nnot indispensable because he “had no personal interest, as such, in the contract.”); Wylain v. \nKidde Consumer Durables Corp. 74 F.R.D. 434, 436 (D. Del. 1977) (“Whenever a judgment is \nentered against the principal on account of his agent’s conduct, some adverse consequences to \nthe agent may reasonably be expected, but it is clear, as a general matter, that the agent is not a \nnecessary party under Rule 19(a)(2)(i).”); Household Retail Servs., Inc. v. CVS Sys., Inc., 95 Civ. \n2862, 1996 WL 411497, at *4 (N.D. Ill. July 18, 1996) (“The ultimate wrongdoing to be proven \nis the wrongdoing as alleged by plaintiffs against [defendant].  The fact that in proving that \nultimate issue plaintiffs will produce evidence of wrongdoing by non-parties . . . is not enough to \nnecessitate [their] presence in the case.”). \nApplied here, in the § 1983 context, the employee reputational harm problem is \namplified.  Under § 1983, a municipality may be liable not only for an official written policy \nbut also for an unwritten policy.  See Monell, 436 U.S. at 690-91; Cash v. Cnty. of Erie, 654 \nF.3d 324, 334 (2d Cir. 2011).  Where, as here, the § 1983 claims are based on an unwritten \n \n56\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 57 of 108\npolicy owing to the City’s deliberate indifference to its employees’ conduct, liability \nnecessarily turns on an analysis of that conduct.  A court has no choice but to assess police \nofficer behavior in Floyd, Ligon, and any other species of deliberate indifference Monell claim.  \nThe Unions maintain that their members, in their capacity as employees of the NYPD, have \nbeen disparaged and have had their integrity impugned by the finding of liability against their \nemployer.  But NYPD officers, as employees, are agents of the City, who do not automatically \nhave a reputational interest in a judgment against their principal.  The stigma they allege—\nhaving their conduct evaluated in a judicial opinion—is not actionable on a motion to intervene \nbecause it is a necessary consequence of proving liability against the principal, the City.  To \nhold otherwise, as then-Circuit Judge Breyer observed, “would greatly expand the universe” of \nparties entitled to intervention.  Pujol, 877 F.2d at 136. \nBy asserting, as the Unions have, that the Court’s injunction runs against union members, \nseparately and distinctly from the City, the Unions presume that police officers have authority or \ndiscretion to conduct stops-and-frisks independent of the directives of their employer, the NYPD.  \nThat is incorrect.  To be sure, police officers are unique among municipal employees in that their \ndaily interactions with the public require them to make split-second decisions that implicate the \nConstitution.  However, these decisions are based on training and guidance provided by their \nmunicipal employer, not the officers’ personal views or analysis of the law.  Because officers \nhave no authority or discretion independent of that which the City delegates to them, it cannot be \nsaid that they have been enjoined, separately and apart from the City.  See Vives v. City of New \nYork, 524 F.3d 346, 357 n.9 (2d Cir. 2008) (“When an official’s discretionary decisions are \nconstrained by policies not of that official’s making, those policies, rather than the subordinate’s \ndepartures from them, are the act of the municipality.”) (quoting St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 \n \n57\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 58 of 108\nU.S. 112, 127 (1988)).  When the City makes the changes to supervision, training, and \nmonitoring required by the Remedial Order, NYPD officers will, as a practical matter, \nimplement the injunction because they will be prohibited from engaging in conduct held to be \nunconstitutional.  This does not, however, give the officers or their Unions an interest in \ndefending that conduct on appeal; that interest belongs to the City alone. \nFinally, with respect to the “safety interests” asserted by the Union, they also belong \nexclusively to the City.  The Unions argue that the concession of liability “by the City on behalf \nof the NYPD and its officers would adversely affect the careers and lives of these [union] \nmembers, and cast doubt on the ability of other members to perform their duties effectively while \navoiding similar accusations in the future, which in turn affects officer and public safety.”  SBA \nMem. 14.  Public safety and effective policing are the prerogatives of the City.  See Pennsylvania \nv. Rizzo, 530 F.2d 501, 505 (3d Cir. 1976) (There is a presumption of adequate representation of \ninterests where a governmental body charged by law with representing the interests of the \nabsentee is present in the lawsuit.).  The only evidence offered by the Unions of the alleged \nconnection between reputational harm and officer and public safety consists of the September 27, \n2013 affidavit of Officer Joseph Alejandro, a twenty-nine -year veteran of the NYPD and the \ntreasurer of the PBA.  Alejandro states that the Liability and Remedial Orders have caused \n“substantial confusion” and “many officers are hesitant to initiate stops . . . [,] even if the \ncircumstances suggest potential criminal activity[,] in light of the uncertainty created by the \ndistrict court’s decision . . . . Given the realities of day-to-day field work, police officers second-\nguessing themselves during the stop, question and frisk procedure threatens the public and their \nsafety.”  Alejandro Decl. ¶¶ 25-27.  Alejandro is expressing the understandable concern that until \nthe NYPD introduces the remedial measures officers may be temporarily unsure of the rules \n \n58\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 59 of 108\ngoverning street encounters with civilians.  As with any court decision that interprets and \nclarifies the law applicable to police procedures, it is the obligation of the City, through its \nagency the NYPD, to provide the training that will resolve questions that officers may have \nabout how to handle stops.  Thus, “officer safety” is really a restatement of the Unions’ \ngeneralized interest in effective policing shared by all New Yorkers.  That interest belongs to the \nCity, not the Unions, and union members have no independent interest in these issues separate \nfrom their municipal employer.   \nc.  Indirect Interests Alleged by the Unions  \nNext, even assuming the Unions could assert reputational interests on behalf of their \nmembers, these interests are too far removed from “the property or transaction that is the subject \nof the action” to support intervention.  Pitney Bowes, 25 F.3d at 70.  The central issue in this \nlitigation is whether the City had an unconstitutional stop-and-frisk policy; that the Unions or \ntheir members feel demeaned by having been mentioned in court proceedings regarding that \ntopic is insufficient to support their intervention because it is too detached from the subject of the \nactions.  Absent allegations of detriment arising from the subject matter of the lawsuit, courts are \ngenerally skeptical of allowing intervention based on such indirect reputational harm.  See, e.g., \nGrochocinski v. Mayer Brown Rowe & Maw, LLP, 719 F.3d 785, 798, 798 n.10 (7th Cir. 2013), \ncert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 1026 (2014) (expressing skepticism that the Rule 24 applicant’s asserted \ninterests—his personal and professional reputation, his ability to earn a living as a financial \nadvisor, and his CFA credential—are direct, significant legally protectable interests); Flynn, 782 \nF.2d at 1093 (a Rule 24 applicant who “merely claims a generalized injury to reputation, but \nidentifies no legal detriment arising from a default judgment” should not be permitted to \nintervene) (Coffin, J. concurring); Edmondson v. Nebraska, 383 F.2d 123, 127 (8th Cir. 1967) \n \n59\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 60 of 108\n(holding that injury to reputation does not constitute legal detriment necessary to justify \nintervention); Morgan Keegan & Co., Inc. v. Garrett, 848 F. Supp. 2d 691, 693 (S.D. Tex. 2012) \n(non-party reputational harm from district court’s findings is insufficient grounds to permit \nintervention because the non-party “was not punished by the court[,] . . . [the court] imposed no \nobligation on him . . . [and] [e]valuation of testimony is not a sanction.”); Mac Sales Inc. v. E.I. \nDupont de Nemours, 89 Civ. 4571, 1995 WL 581790, at *2-3 (E.D. La. Sept. 29, 1995) (same); \nCalloway v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 115 F.R.D. 73, 74 (M.D. Ga. 1987) (same).   \nIn the Rule 19 mandatory joinder context, courts have similarly held that reputational \nharm is insufficient to make an absent party necessary to an ongoing action.15  See, e.g., Pujol, \n877 F.2d at 136 (“[C]ases interpreting Rule 19 consistently hold that such “slandered outsiders” \nneed not be joined.”) (citing Challenge Homes, Inc. v. Greater Naples Care Center, Inc., 669 \nF.2d 667, 668-71 (11th Cir. 1982)); Milligan, 522 F.2d at 1203-05; Wylain, 74 F.R.D. at 436-37; \nWillis v. Semmes, Bowen & Semmes, 441 F. Supp. 1235, 1245 (E.D. Va. 1977).   \nWhere Second Circuit courts have addressed reputational harm as a basis for intervention \nunder 24(a), they have also rejected it when the reputational harm was not directly related to the \nunderlying action.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps. of Eng’rs, 709 F.2d 175, 176 (2d \nCir. 1983) (intervenor’s interest in professional reputation not related to merits of underlying \naction); New York News Inc. v. Newspaper & Mail Deliverers’ Union of New York, 139 F.R.D. \n291, 293 (S.D.N.Y. 1991), aff’d sub nom. New York News, Inc. v. Kheel, 972 F.2d 482, 486 (2d \nCir. 1992) (same). \nIn this case, the Unions allege no detriment to their members, legal or otherwise, flowing \n                         \n15 The parallel between the interest required by Rules 19 and 24 is widely recognized.  \nMasterCard, 471 F.3d at 389-90.  If a party is not “necessary” under Rule 19, then it cannot \nsatisfy the test for intervention as of right under Rule 24, because “[t]hese rules are intended to \nmirror each other.”  Id.  \n \n60\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 61 of 108\nfrom the purported reputational harm.  Although they state generally that officers’ “careers have \nbeen tarnished,” there are no examples of officers having been fired, demoted, denied \npromotions, reprimanded, disciplined, or having lost pay or pensions.  SBA Reply Mem. 1.  \nSimilarly, the Unions claim that the reputational injury has undermined officers’ ability “to \nperform their duties effectively,” but provide no description of how police interaction with the \npublic has been altered or hampered.  SBA Mem. 14.   \nIn addition, the officers identified by name will suffer no future adverse legal \nconsequences arising from the Liability Order.  First, as for the following former individual \ndefendants in Floyd, Officers Rodriguez, Goodman, Hernandez, Joyce, Pichardo, Salmeron, \nHayes, Moran, Sergeant Kelly, and the Jane and John Doe officers, plaintiffs are barred from \nbringing lawsuits against them because plaintiffs “withdr[e]w the [i]ndividual [d]amage [c]laims, \nwith prejudice, against all defendants against whom such [c]laims were asserted or could have \nbeen asserted.”  Stipulation and Order ¶¶ 1, 4, Floyd, ECF No. 270.16  Second, with respect to all \nofficers identified by name, because over five years have passed since the events described in the \nLiability Order occurred, the statute of limitations has already run.  See Murphy v. Lynn, 53 F.3d \n547, 548 (2d Cir. 1995) (the statute of limitations for § 1983 actions in New York is three years).  \nEven if the time to sue had not expired, to the extent an officer would face any legal proceeding \narising from the behavior mentioned, that proceeding would be based on the conduct itself, not \nthe Liability Order.  Thus, it is implausible that officers mentioned by name in the Liability \nOrder, or NYPD officers more generally, have suffered or will suffer any legal detriment.   \n                         \n16 To the extent the Unions seek to protect the reputational interests of Officers Rodriguez, \nGoodman, Hernandez, Joyce, Pichardo, Salmeron, Hayes, Moran, Sergeant Kelly, they are \nbarred from doing so.  The Unions cannot argue for the reinstatement of individuals who were \nonce defendants in the action (represented by counsel) and who consented to their own dismissal \nwith prejudice.  See Floyd, ECF No. 270.  Dismissal with prejudice would be meaningless if \ncourts were to permit dismissed parties to rejoin the case under Rule 24.   \n \n61\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 62 of 108\nMoreover, even if named non-party officers could assert a legal detriment, their status as \nparticipants in the judicial process also prohibits the Unions from intervening on their behalf.  \nCourts have uniformly held that the reputational interests of non-party participants, such as \nwitnesses, cannot support the witness’ intervention in the case as a party.  See, e.g., \nGrochocinski, 719 F.3d at 798 n.10; Garrett, 848 F. Supp. 2d at 693; Mac Sales Inc., 1995 WL \n581790, at *2-3; Calloway, 115 F.R.D. at 74.  In each case, a witness sought to intervene as a \nparty in order to correct a reputational injury suffered as a result of the court’s review of their \ntestimony.  In Grochocinski, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that “[j]udges and juries must often \nevaluate the conduct and credibility of people and institutions that are not parties.  Judges’ \nfindings and comments are often critical of non-parties, not gratuitously but as a necessary part \nof deciding the cases properly before them.”  Grochocinski, 719 F.3d at 798 n.10.  Garrett \nreasoned similarly that, “[i]n the course of a case, the court is obliged to decide things, and these \ndecisions may reflect poorly on the parties, witnesses, and other people who were part of the \nfactual basis for the suit.  Crisp rulings that displease the object of them are a necessary friction \nof litigation.”  Garrett, 848 F. Supp. 2d at 693.  A person cannot intervene “because their \ntestimony is found to have been anything from weak to false . . . whether the witness is a party, \nobserver-participant, or after-the-fact technician.”  Id.  “To hold otherwise would transform \nevery proceeding that involved a determination of a witness’s credibility into an invitation to \nintervene.”  Mac Sales Inc., 1995 WL 581790, at *3.  “Rule 24(a)(2) was not designed to provide \na forum for witnesses in the underlying action to protect their reputation in the community.”  \nCalloway, 115 F.R.D. at 74.  Moreover, “[t]o hold that the prospect of a judge’s adverse finding \nor comment could support intervention as a party, with rights to appeal, for example, even if the \noriginal parties are satisfied with the outcome, would amount to a stunning expansion of standing \n \n62\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 63 of 108\nand would invite prolonged and even endless litigation.”  Grochocinski, 719 F.3d at 798 n.10.   \nThe reasoning of these cases applies with equal, if not greater, force here.  To resolve the \n§ 1983 Monell claims raised in Floyd and Ligon, the Court was required to evaluate the behavior \nand credibility of NYPD officers, including their testimony and other evidence presented about \ntheir conduct.  As in Grochocinski, the original parties are satisfied with the outcome, but instead \nof witnesses proposing intervention, the unions to which those witnesses belong are asserting \ntheir alleged interests.  Thus, intervention under these circumstances would lead to an even more \nstunning outcome.  Any NYPD officer whose testimony is discredited or criticized in a judicial \nopinion could play the reputational-harm card and intervene as of right.  Consider the interests of \nthose officers who testified in support of plaintiffs’ claims.  Given that an appellate court might \nundo the Liability Order’s findings that credited their testimony and vindicated their behavior, on \nthe Unions’ theory, should not these officer-witnesses enjoy the right to ensure that the Liability \nOrder is not reversed?  More disturbing yet, if the Unions are permitted to intervene based on an \namorphous “reputational harm” or “tarnished career” theory, the Court would be inviting endless \nlitigation whenever the City is sued for police misconduct.  The Court would be handing the \nUnions an unprecedented bargaining chip and a limitless check on elected officials’ prerogative \nto control the City’s litigation strategy.17  The City would have to seek union approval, or risk \n                         \n17  The Court takes judicial notice of two news reports cited in Plaintiffs’ opposition papers, in \nwhich the presidents of the CEA and SBA state that they would consider dropping their efforts to \nappeal if Mayor de Blasio were willing to make a suitable offer in their ongoing contract \nnegotiations.  See Charney Decl. Exs. N, O.  The CEA president is quoted as saying that the \nCEA’s involvement in the stop-and-frisk litigation is “something that you bring to the bargaining \ntable.”  Charney Decl. Ex. N.  On a motion to intervene, the Court has a duty to review not only \nthe movant’s allegations, but also the opposition’s.  See Stadin v. Union Elec. Co., 309 F.2d 912, \n917 (8th Cir. 1962).  The Unions do not dispute the reports and instead urge that they \ndemonstrate that change to policing policy should occur “not through a collusive agreement \nbetween the City and Plaintiffs” but through bargaining that includes the Unions.  PBA Rep. 9 \nn.6.  This, of course, ignores that fact that the Remedial Order is a court order resulting from \nprotracted litigation during which the Unions made no effort to assert their views, not a \n \n63\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 64 of 108\nprolonged litigation, in order to settle § 1983 lawsuits.  Such a result cannot be justified.     \nd.  United States v. City of Los Angeles   \nWhen examined closely, the primary case relied upon by the Unions, United States v. \nCity of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d 391 (9th Cir. 2002), provides no refuge.  The Unions cite City of \nLos Angeles for the proposition that allegations of misconduct against police officers give police \nunions a right to intervene on their behalf in the merits of an action.  This is a misreading of its \nholding.  There, the DOJ commenced a civil suit against the City of Los Angeles, the Board of \nPolice Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles Police Department (the \n“LAPD”), alleging they had engaged in a pattern or practice of depriving individuals of \nconstitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 14141.  Id. at 396.  The lawsuit focused on the \nLAPD’s Rampart Division and, in particular, the anti-gang unit known as Community Resources \nAgainst Street Hoodlums (“CRASH”), which, according to the testimony of a former LAPD \nofficer, had engaged in widespread misconduct and corruption.18  Id.  Although no individual \nofficers were named as defendants, the complaint alleged that LAPD officers had “subject[ed] \nindividuals to uses of excessive force, false arrests, and improper searches and seizures.”  Compl. \nat 2, United States v. City of Los Angeles, No. 00 Civ. 11769 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 3, 2000), Docket \nNo. 1.  Before initiating the formal lawsuit, the DOJ and the City of Los Angeles negotiated a \nresolution to address the underlying violations.  City of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d at 396.  Thus, a \n“Joint Application to Enter Consent Decree” was filed alongside the complaint.19 \n                                                                               \nnegotiated settlement between Plaintiffs and the City.   \n18 The officer’s testimony led to the “Rampart Scandal,” which exposed system-wide \nconstitutional violations that “ultimately implicated scores of police officers, overturned dozens \nof convictions, and generated intense media scrutiny.”  Harper v. City of Los Angeles, 533 F.3d \n1010, 1015 (9th Cir. 2008); see also Rodriguez v. Gates, 99 Civ. 13190, 2002 WL 1162675, *2 \n(C.D. Cal. May 30, 2002) (“To date, more than 150 suits have been filed alleging civil rights \nviolations connected to the Rampart Division scandal.”). \n19 It is not uncommon for 42 U.S.C. § 14141 cases to commence with the filing of a complaint \n \n64\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 65 of 108\nWithin weeks, the PPL, the designated bargaining unit for rank and file LAPD officers, \nmoved to intervene alleging an interest in both the merits and remedial phases.  Order Denying \nMot. to Intervene at 8-9, City of Los Angeles, No. 00 Civ. 11769 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 5, 2001), Docket \nNo. 58.  The PPL argued that it had an interest in the merits of the case because, by ordering \nofficers to “refrain from engaging in a pattern or practice of conduct including excessive force, \nfalse arrests, and improper searches and seizures[,]” the proposed consent decree subjected PPL \nmembers “to potential contempt of Court if the prospective injunction is violated.”  Id. at 8 \n(alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The district court disagreed, holding \nthat the injunction, by its plain language, ran only against the City of Los Angeles, not the PPL \nor its officers.  Id. at 8-9.  Thus, once approved, only the City could be punished for violating its \nterms.  Id. at 8 n.3.  The district court also held that the PPL had a significant protectable interest \nin the remedial phase, “to the extent the Proposed Decree would modify or invalidate the \n[collective bargaining agreement],” but determined that the Proposed Decree did not actually \nthreaten those rights because of certain procedural safeguards.  Id. at 10-11.  \n The Ninth Circuit disagreed.  Although generally, the injunction in the proposed consent \ndecree ran against the City alone, the conclusion that officers themselves could face no liability \nunder it presumed that the proposal would actually be approved without changes.  City of Los \nAngeles, 288 F.3d at 399.  This presumptiveness marred the district court’s intervention analysis, \nand the Ninth Circuit instead emphasized that the complaint’s allegations of misconduct against \nofficers could continue to be litigated, exposing those officers to future liability.20  Not only was \nthe consent decree merely a proposal, but the federal government plaintiff did not “unequivocally \n                                                                               \nand a consent decree.  See Marshall Miller, Note: Police Brutality, 17 Yale L. & Pol’y Rev. 149, \n186 (1998) (“[T]he Justice Department appears to have adopted an initial § 14141 strategy of \ninvestigation and negotiation, opting to pursue consent decrees rather than litigated judgments.”).  \n20 In all likelihood, many officers did face subsequent criminal or civil liability in connection \nwith the underlying behavior covered by the complaint’s allegations.  See note 18 supra.   \n \n65\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 66 of 108\nand completely disclaim the remedies sought in its complaint against the [PPL’s] member \nofficers,” rather, it had only agreed that those officers would not be subject to liability if the \ncourt were to approve the consent decree.  In addition, the consent decree contained a provision \nallowing the United States to seek its dissolution in certain circumstances and litigate the action \non the merits.  Thus, there remained the possibility that individual officers, who were not named \ndefendants but whose conduct was placed at issue by the complaint, could face liability.  \nMoreover, because there was a “marked divergence of positions concerning . . . underlying \ntheories of liability,” the existing parties, particularly the City of Los Angeles, which presumably \nwanted to distance itself from the “Rampart Scandal,” could not be counted on to adequately \nrepresent the officers’ interests.  Id. at 402. \nAlthough the Unions reduce City of Los Angeles to the proposition that allegations of \npolice misconduct give police unions the right to intervene, the holding is more nuanced.  The \nNinth Circuit held that a police union had a right to intervene in the merits on behalf of its \nmembers where members had been accused of misconduct, they could still face liability based on \nthat misconduct, and the existing municipal defendant had no interest in defending the conduct.  \nId. at 399-402.  The circumstances of the Unions’ proposed intervention in Floyd and Ligon bear \nlittle resemblance to City of Los Angeles.  The Ninth Circuit did not mention abstract reputational \nharm as a justification for intervention.  Nor did the Ninth Circuit discuss the right of unions to \nprotect their members’ reputations that may be implicated in the course of a lawsuit where they \nwere witnesses.  Instead, the PPL’s intervention was based on the real possibility that, although \nthey were not named as defendants and no existing party was looking out for their interests, the \nPPL’s members could face liability down the road.   \nUnion members here face no possibility of liability based on their conduct having been \n \n66\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 67 of 108\nevaluated in the Liability Order.  As discussed, the Floyd plaintiffs, who were certified to \nrepresent a class, gave up their claims for damages “against all defendants against whom such \n[c]laims were asserted or could have been asserted,” when the Court dismissed the individual \nofficer defendants from the case on March 8, 2013.  Stipulation and Order ¶ 1, Floyd, ECF No. \n270.  In addition to the plain language of the order of dismissal, any future § 1983 claim based \non findings in the Liability Order would be barred by the three-year statute of limitations.  See \nOwens v. Okure, 488 U.S. 235, 251 (1989) (applying the three-year statute of limitation found at \nN.Y. C.P.L.R. § 241(5) to § 1983 claims in New York).  Moreover, any potential lawsuit would \nbe based on the officers’ underlying behavior, not on the fact that the Court wrote about it in the \nLiability Order.  Unlike City of Los Angeles where the existing municipal defendant had every \nreason to distance itself from the officers’ conduct, here, there was no such divergence of \ninterests between the City and the individual officer defendants prior to the date when they were \ndismissed as defendants in Floyd.21 \ne.  Conclusion:  the Unions Have No Cognizable Interests in the Merits \nIn sum, the abstract reputational harm asserted by the Unions is not a significant \nprotectable “interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action.”  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 24(a).  The Unions’ allegations are conclusory, and the interests alleged do not belong \nto the Unions to protect or vindicate.  Where the alleged reputational injury does belong to a \nunion member, the detriment flowing from that harm is too speculative or remote.  Based on the \ncircumstances here, where the Unions purport to represent the interests of individuals who were \nwitnesses, deponents, or otherwise participants in the judicial process, they cannot assert a \n                         \n21 As discussed supra, the Corporation Counsel may represent the City and an individual officer \nas co-defendants, as in Floyd, only if it is satisfied that their positions are aligned, i.e., that the \nofficers were acting within the scope of their employment and there is no conflict of interest in \nthe representation.  N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law § 50-k; see also Mercurio, 758 F.2d at 864-65. \n \n67\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 68 of 108\nreputational injury arising from the Court’s evaluation of their testimony or conduct.  Similarly, \nas employees, union members have suffered no actionable reputational harm arising from the \nfact that their employer was found to have broken the law.  Having determined that the Unions’ \nmotions are untimely and that the Unions lack an interest in the merits of this litigation, the Court \nneed not address the balance of the Rule 24(a) analysis—whether the disposition of the litigation \nmay practically impair the Unions’ ability to protect their members’ interests or whether the \nexisting parties adequately represent them.  Pitney Bowes, 25 F.3d at 70.    \n2.  The Unions’ Alleges Interests in the Remedies \nThe Remedial Order directs the City to remedy the violations identified in Floyd in two \nphases:  immediate reforms and ongoing equitable relief.  Floyd, 959 F. Supp. 2d 668.  During \nthe first phase, the court-appointed monitor must develop “Immediate Reforms,” in consultation \nwith the parties, including changes to “the NYPD’s policies, training, supervision, monitoring \nand discipline” regarding stop-and-frisk.  Id. at 678-84.  The Remedial Order also requires the \nCity to conduct a one-year pilot project in which officers in one precinct per borough will wear \nbody cameras on patrol.  Id. at 685.  After the Immediate Reforms are approved by the Court, the \nCity and Plaintiffs must engage in a six to nine month “Joint Remedial Process,” guided by a \ncourt-appointed facilitator, to develop “Joint Process Reforms” in consultation with the monitor \nand based on input from a variety of stakeholders, including “NYPD personnel and \nrepresentatives of police organizations.”  Id. at 684-88.   \nIn Ligon, the Remedial Order largely adopts the approach proposed in the Injunction \nOrder.  In particular, the NYPD must create and disseminate to officers a court-provided written \npolicy on the legal standard for trespass stops around TAP buildings.  Id. at 688.  The NYPD, in \nconjunction with the Ligon plaintiffs, the City, and under the supervision of the monitor, must \n \n68\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 69 of 108\ndevelop a system for monitoring the constitutionality of TAP stops, and for ensuring that UF-\n250s are completed for each stop.  The NYPD must also make changes to departmental training \nregarding TAP stops.  Id. at 688-90.  \nThe Unions assert an interest in the possibility that the Remedial Order will “set \nemployment practices that would otherwise be subject to bargaining under state law.”  PBA \nMem. 14.  In particular, the Unions are concerned that the Remedial Order contemplates the \nintroduction of body cameras for some officers, changes to police training, changes to the UF-\n250 form and other mandatory paperwork, and changes to disciplinary and supervisory policies \nregarding stops-and-frisks.  Thus, the Unions seek intervention in order to vindicate those \ninterests by appealing the Remedial Order to the Second Circuit.  \nPlaintiffs respond that the Unions’ alleged interest rests on their misapprehension of the \nCBL.  In particular, Plaintiffs dispute the Unions’ claim that the matters covered by the Remedial \nOrder are within the scope of the mandatory bargaining topics under the CBL.  Plaintiffs argue \nthat none of the relief spelled out in the Remedial Order infringes upon the Unions’ bargaining \nrights.  They argue, therefore, that the Unions have no direct, substantial, and legally protectable \ninterest in the Remedial Order. \nThe Court agrees that the Unions have failed to demonstrate a significant protectable \ninterest in appealing the Remedial Order.  There are two problems with the Unions’ position.  \nFirst, the Unions’ allegations regarding their collective bargaining interests are so conclusory as \nto evade any meaningful court analysis.  Second, the Unions overstate their rights and misapply \nthe CBL to those rights. \na.  The Applicant’s Burden \n“[P]etitioners have an obligation to set forth their interest with clarity.”  Hobson, 44 \n \n69\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 70 of 108\nF.R.D. at 25.  Here, the Unions’ general claim is that provisions of the Remedial Order involve \n“mandatory subject[s] of collective bargaining.”  SBA Mem. 1.  As such, they object generally to \nthe changes in “existing policies, training, discipline, equipment, and supervision” because \n“[t]hose matters will directly affect the Unions’ members in their day-to-day activities and \ncollective bargaining rights.”  PBA Mem. 18.  To the extent there are any specifics allegations, \nthe Unions assert that their rights will be impacted by: \n  Changes to the UF-250 form to the extent they will (1) require officers to \nfill-out a narrative explaining why they stopped and/or frisked someone; \n(2) require officers to fill out revised check boxes to account for why they \nstopped and/or frisked someone; (3) require officers to provide a copy of \nthe form, their names and badge numbers, and information on how to file \na complaint to individuals who are stopped and/or frisked but let go; (4) \nrequire supervisors to review stops and address their effectiveness and \nconstitutionality;  and  (5)  require  additional  training,  supervision,  and \nmonitoring that will come with the introduction of the revised forms.  See \nPBA Mem. 16-17. \n \n  Introduction of body cameras to be worn, implicating officer safety, public \nsafety, privacy and discipline.  Id. 17. \n \n  Changes to the “procedural aspects” of the NYPD’s Quest for Excellence \nProgram.  Id. 16. \n \n  Introduction of a court-appointed monitor and a facilitator who will likely \nmake decisions that generally touch upon training, supervision, monitoring \nand discipline.  Id. 7-8. \n \n  A directive to improve procedures for disciplining officers in response to \nCCRB findings of substantiated misconduct.  Id. 17. \n \nHowever, the Unions fail to explain how any of the listed changes will impact the scope of their \nCBL rights or any provision of a current collective bargaining agreement.   \nThe relevant question is what could the Unions bargain over the day before the Remedial \nOrder was issued that they will no longer be able to bargain over once it is implemented?  The \nanswer to that question demands more particularity than providing a list of changes.  See \n \n70\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 71 of 108\nSheppard v. Phoenix, 91 Civ. 4148, 1998 WL 397846, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. July 16, 1998) (denying \nintervention where movants, who alleged that their collective bargaining rights were harmed, \n“neither refer to any specific provision of their labor contract with the City nor attach a copy of \nthe contract, or any portions of it, to their papers”).  The Court does not doubt that the Remedial \nOrder will change daily practices related to stops-and-frisks; change, after all, was the point of \nordering the NYPD to remedy the unconstitutional violations identified by the Court.  But the \nUnions fail to explain how the Remedial Order will prevent or limit them from doing something \nthey currently have the right to do.  “Such conclusory allegations . . . do not entitle [a movant] to \nintervention as of right under Rule 24.”  Flynn, 782 F.2d at 1093.  It is the Unions’ burden to \ndemonstrate a right to intervene, and having put forth only conclusory allegations regarding their \ncollective bargaining rights, they have not met their burden.22 \nb.  Scope of the CBL \n  The Unions’ have also failed to identify any state law demonstrating that they have a \nright to bargain over the listed changes.  In New York, the Taylor Law governs public \nemployment labor relations.  N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law § 200 et seq.  Section 212 of the Taylor Law \nprovides that localities may enact their own public labor relations statutes and create their own \nadministrative bodies to administer their statutes.  The City has created a tri-partite \nadministrative body composed of labor, management, and the New York City Board of \nCollective Bargaining (the “BCB”).  New York City Charter, Chapter 54, § 1171.  The BCB \ninterprets and administers the City’s local public labor relations statute, the CBL (N.Y.C. Admin. \n                         \n22 The Court notes that excerpts from “the most recent” collective bargaining agreement between \nthe City and the PBA are attached to the PBA’s reply brief.  Engel Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A, Floyd, ECF \nNo. 454-1.  The Unions, however, offer no explanation about how the Remedial Order would \naffect the agreement.  The portions of the agreement attached cover procedures for employees to \nfile grievances against the NYPD for labor law violations and death benefits, neither of which \nare the subjects of the Remedial Order. \n \n71\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 72 of 108\nCode §§ 12–301 et seq.), as well as applicable provisions of the Taylor Law. \nCBL § 12-309(a)(2) authorizes the BCB to determine whether a matter is within the \nscope of collective bargaining.  The BCB may find:  (1) that the matter is a mandatory subject of \ncollective bargaining, meaning the employer and union must bargain in good faith regarding the \nmatter; (2) that the matter is a permissive subject of collective bargaining, meaning the parties \nmay, but are not required to, negotiate concerning the matter; or (3) that the matter is a \nprohibited subject of collective bargaining, meaning that the parties are not permitted to \nnegotiate over the matter.  See Incorporated Vill. of Lynbrook v. N.Y. State Pub. Empl. Relations \nBd., 423 N.Y.S.2d 466, 467 n.1 (1979).  The BCB has exclusive, primary jurisdiction to make \nthis determination, although its decisions are subject to judicial review.  See Uniformed \nFirefighters Ass’n of Greater New York v. City of New York, 581 N.Y.S.2d 734, 735 (1992). \nIn determining whether a matter is a mandatory subject of bargaining, the BCB must \nconsider the “management rights” provision of the Administrative Code: \na. Subject to the provisions of subdivision b of this section . . . public employers \nand certified or designated employee organizations shall have the duty to bargain \nin  good  faith  on  wages  .  .  .  hours  .  .  .  working  conditions  and  provisions \n[regarding union dues] . . . . \n \nb. It is the right of the city, or any other public employer, acting through its \nagencies, to determine the standards of services to be offered by its agencies; \ndetermine the standards of selection for employment; direct its employees; take \ndisciplinary action; relieve its employees from duty because of lack of work or for \nother  legitimate  reasons;  maintain  the  efficiency  of  governmental  operations; \ndetermine the methods, means and personnel by which government operations are \nto be conducted; determine the content of job classifications; take all necessary \nactions to carry out its mission in emergencies; and exercise complete control and \ndiscretion  over  its  organization  and  the  technology  of  performing  its  work. \nDecisions of the city or any other public employer on those matters are not within \nthe  scope  of  collective  bargaining,  but,  notwithstanding  the  above,  questions \nconcerning the practical impact that decisions on the above matters have on terms \nand  conditions  of  employment,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  questions  of \nworkload,  staffing  and  employee  safety,  are  within  the  scope  of  collective \nbargaining. \n \n72\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 73 of 108\nN.Y.C. Admin. Code § 12–307(a), (b).  Thus, matters covered by § 12–307(a) are generally \nmandatory subjects of collective bargaining about which the parties must negotiate, whereas \nmatters covered by the “management rights” provisions of § 12–307(b) are generally either \npermissive subjects (about which the parties may, but are not required to, negotiate) or prohibited \nsubjects (about which the parties may not negotiate). \nAs is evident from the plain language of the statute, the contested changes brought on by \nthe Remedial Order are covered by the management rights provisions of § 12–307(b), which \ninclude, changes to training, discipline, equipment, and supervision.  In fact, when read in its \nentirety, the CBL delegates to the City broader powers with respect to the Remedial Order than \nthe Unions acknowledge.  On the one hand, the CBL limits the scope of collective bargaining to \nthe “terms and conditions of employment.”  Id.  On the other hand, with no input from the \nUnions, the City has the power to “determine the standards of services to be offered,” “direct its \nemployees,” “take disciplinary action,” “maintain the efficiency of governmental operations,” \n“determine the methods, means and personnel by which government operations are to be \nconducted,” “determine the content of job classifications,” and “exercise complete control and \ndiscretion over its organization.”  Id.  Accordingly, “[d]ecisions of the [C]ity or any other public \nemployer on those matters are not within the scope of collective bargaining.”  Id.  As interpreted \nby the New York Court of Appeals, “decisions are not bargainable as terms and conditions of \nemployment where they are inherently and fundamentally policy decisions relating to [its] \nprimary mission.”  In re County of Erie v. PERB, 12 N.Y.3d 72, 78 (2009) (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted).  For police departments in particular, “[a]s long ago as 1888,” the New \nYork Court of Appeals, “emphasized the quasi-military nature of a police force, and said that ‘a \nquestion pertaining solely to the general government and discipline of the force . . . must, from \n \n73\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 74 of 108\nthe nature of things, rest wholly in the discretion of the commissioners.’”  In re PBA v. PERB, 6 \nN.Y.3d 563, 576 (2006) (citation omitted). \nc.  Application of the CBL to the Remedial Order \nHere, the changes to stop-and-frisk policies, procedures, supervision, training, and \nmonitoring outlined in the Remedial Order are precisely the kind of management prerogatives \ncourts have held are not subject to collective bargaining.  See, e.g., Sheppard, 1998 WL 397846, \nat *7-9 (denying union’s application for intervention where settlement provisions were covered \nby management rights provisions of § 12-307(b)); City of New York v. MacDonald, 201 A.D.2d \n258, 259 (1st Dep’t 1994) (finding that police discipline, “including the right to determine guilt \nor innocence of breach of disciplinary rules and the penalty to be imposed upon conviction,” is \ncommitted to NYPD commissioner and that City cannot be forced to bargain on this subject).  \nThe Unions have pointed to no contrary authorities which suggest that the City’s implementation \nof the Remedial Order risks straying into mandatory bargaining territory.   \nThe Unions respond that even though they have no right to bargain over policy, under § \n12-307(b) they do have the right to bargain over the “practical impact” that the Remedial Order’s \npolicy changes will have on the terms and conditions of their employment.  See N.Y.C. Admin. \nCode § 12-307(b).  This argument misses the mark.  Even assuming the policy changes in the \nRemedial Order have a practical impact on terms and conditions, such as hours and wages—the \nexplanation of which is absent from the Unions’ papers—nothing in the Remedial Order \nprevents the Unions from bargaining over these impacts.  Moreover, the Unions provide no legal \nauthority for the proposition that because a managerial policy change has practical impacts, \nunions have the right to bargain over the policy itself.  If that were true, it would defeat the \nstatute’s purpose in delineating management prerogatives as distinct from collective bargaining \n \n74\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 75 of 108\ntopics; every managerial policy change might have an attenuated “practical impact” on terms and \nconditions of employment, and thus, all managerial policy changes would be subject to collective \nbargaining.   \nPlaintiffs provide an instructive example.  In the public education context, the fixing of \nclass size falls within managerial prerogatives, but because it impacts teacher workload, the \nimpact on teachers (e.g., whether compensation should vary according to class size) is subject to \nnegotiation.  West Irondequoit Teachers Ass’n v. Helsby, 35 N.Y.2d 46, 49-50 (1974). The same \nis true here.  The CBL does not give the Unions the right to bargain over changes to stop-and-\nfrisk policies, procedures, supervision, and training.  Those decisions are managerial \nprerogatives.  The Unions do, however, have the right to bargain over practical impacts, such as \nworkload and pay that may result from the changes set forth in the Remedial Order. \nd.  The Unions’ Additional Objections   \nThe Unions raise several additional objections to the Remedial Order.  They contend that \n“[w]ithout formal intervention, the [Remedial Order] would provide the [Unions] with no forum \nto ensure that they might object to any changes that would contradict the [collective bargaining \nagreement] or existing procedures subject to bargaining.”  PBA Mem. 18.  The Unions also \nargue that they “have a right to ask the [BCB] to make determinations regarding any of the \nmyriad subject matters contemplated by the Remedi[al] Order and to appeal that determination \nwhere necessary, through the state courts or to the [PERB].”  PBA Reply Mem. 7.  Further, \n“because there is no finalized stipulation or consent decree regarding remedial measures before \nthe Court, this Court cannot decide as a matter of law that the measures eventually implemented \nwill not have collective bargaining ramifications.”  SBA Reply Mem. 6.  These collateral \narguments, again, miss the mark.   \n \n75\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 76 of 108\nFirst, as discussed, the CBL does not give the Unions a right to decide which policy \nchanges are on the menu, but rather, the authority to bargain over the prices.  Second, there is no \nbasis in law—and the Unions cite none—for the proposition that the Unions have a right to have \na federal court’s remedial order vetted by the BCB before it is issued.  In fact, the opposite is \ntrue.  Federal courts have broad remedial powers to fix constitutional violations.  Swann v. \nCharlotte–Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971); Association of Surrogates & Supreme \nCourt Reporters Within the City of New York v. New York, 966 F.2d 75, 79 (2d Cir. 1992) \n(“[F]ederal courts have broad discretion in fashioning equitable remedies for . . . constitutional \nviolations.”).  Finally, although the Unions repeatedly refer to the Remedial Order as a “consent \ndecree,” “proposed settlement,” or “prospective consent decree,” see, e.g., PBA Reply Mem. 13; \nSBA Reply Mem. 8, it is none of those things.  The Remedial Order is a binding court order; it is \nnot hypothetical, and it is not a negotiated settlement or consent decree where the parties have \nvoluntarily ended their legal dispute.  See Floyd, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 686.   \nTo the extent the Unions’ actual objection is that they did not have an opportunity to \nshape the terms of the Remedial Order before it was issued, that is a problem of their own \nmaking.  They chose to file an untimely motion in September 2013, rather than (1) when the \nCourt made clear in January 2013 that a remedial order would be issued following any finding of \nliability in Floyd, and (2) when the Court invited input on the scope of such a remedial order as \nearly as March 2013.  See, e.g., Jan. 4, 2013 Hearing Tr. at 84:13-85:20, Floyd, ECF No. 252 \n(oral order declining to bifurcate Floyd trial into separate liability and remedial phases); \nInjunction Order, 925 F. Supp. 2d at 543 (inviting the parties to brief “whether the proposed \nrelief is insufficient or too burdensome or otherwise inappropriate.”).  Thus, if the Unions were \nconcerned that between January and August 2013 the parties or other stakeholders might \n \n76\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 77 of 108\nrecommend to the Court remedial measures that would practically impact the terms and \nconditions of employment, rather than relate only to managerial prerogatives, the Unions should \nhave timely moved to intervene.  That process, however, produced a Remedial Order that covers \nonly policy changes. \nThe Unions lack of a significant protectable interest in the remedies is further illustrated \nby the fact that they have pointed to no provision in the Remedial Order that prevents or \nthreatens to prevent their ability to collectively bargain over the practical impact of these \nchanges.  Moreover, the Unions neither filed motions to intervene nor sought leave of the court \nto file amicus briefs in connection with the Daniels settlement.  That settlement was in place \nfrom 2004 through 2007, during which time the NYPD implemented changes to monitoring, \nsupervision, training, and the paperwork associated with stops-and-frisks, and no objection from \nthe Unions is reflected in court records.  Furthermore, beginning in 2009, the City implemented \nthe following changes to its stop-and-frisk policies and procedures that altered the duties and \nresponsibilities of union members:  2009 and 2010 revisions to the NYPD Patrol Guide section \non stop-and-frisk requiring officers to provide a stopped civilian with an explanation of the \nreasons for the stop, and an information card entitled, “What is a Stop, Question, and Frisk \nEncounter,” Charney Decl. Exs. E, F; a 2011 revision to the UF-250 which requires officers to \nprovide the reason(s) for any force used during a stop-and-frisk, id. Exs. C, G; a 2012 revision to \nthe Patrol Guide section on the duties and responsibilities of captains, requiring them to conduct \nstop-and-frisk inspections in each precinct, id. Ex. H; and a March 5, 2013 memorandum from \nthe NYPD Chief of Patrol requiring all NYPD patrol officers to provide additional narrative \ndetails about the reasons for a stop in both their activity logs and on the UF-250 and to staple a \ncopy of the requisite activity log entry to each UF-250 they submit.  Id. Ex. I.  Additionally, in \n \n77\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 78 of 108\n2012 and 2013, 6,000 officers attended a stop-and-frisk training course.  Floyd Trial Tr. at 5121.  \nPlaintiffs point out these voluntary changes in their opposition briefs, yet the Unions offer no \nexplanation for why the changes triggered no collective bargaining issues.  Although the Unions’ \nfailure to react to the Daniels settlement and the NYPD’s voluntary policy changes listed is not \ndispositive, their inaction is certainly circumstantial evidence that the Remedial Order’s changes \nwill have no discernable impact on the Unions’ CBL rights or their collective bargaining \nagreements.  \nThe cases cited by the Unions do not compel a contrary conclusion.  Citing W.R. Grace \n& Co. v. Local Union 759, 461 U.S. 757, 760-61 (1983), Brennan, 260 F.3d 123, City of Los \nAngeles, 288 F.3d 391, EEOC v. AT&T Co., 506 F.2d 735 (3d Cir. 1974), and United States v. \nCity of Portland, 12 Civ. 2265 (D. Or. Feb. 19, 2013), the Unions maintain that federal courts \nroutinely grant intervention to unions where their collective bargaining rights may be \nundermined.  These cases are inapposite.  In each, it was acknowledged that the implementation \nof the relief at issue interfered with the statutory or contractual rights of the would-be \nintervenors.  See, e.g., W.R. Grace, 461 U.S. at 759, 771; Brennan, 260 F.3d. at 129-30; City of \nLos Angeles, 288 F.3d at 399-400; AT&T, 506 F.2d at 738-39; Order at 7-8, City of Portland, No. \n3:12-cv-02265, Docket No. 32.  Here, the Remedial Order concerns only policy changes not \nsubject to mandatory collective bargaining under New York law.  See also California ex rel. \nLockyer v. United States, 450 F.3d 436, 443 (9th Cir. 2006) (explaining that in City of Los \nAngeles, the Ninth Circuit “granted intervention to the bargaining unit because the proposed \nconsent decree in the case purported to give the district court authority to override the officers’ \ncollective bargaining agreement”).  Moreover, in two of these cases, the proposed intervenor-\nunion cited specific statutory or contractual provisions that would be impacted by the consent \n \n78\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 79 of 108\ndecrees.  See, e.g., Intervenor-Appellant PPL Mem. at *20, City of Los Angeles, No. 01-55182, \n2001 WL 34093539 (9th Cir. May 8, 2001) (explaining that consent decree conflicted with \nseveral specific provisions of collective bargaining agreement and would trigger “meet and \nconsult” requirements under California law, and citing two declarations describing, on a section-\nby-section basis, key inconsistencies between collective bargaining agreement and consent \ndecree); Intervenor-Def. Portland Police Ass’n Mem. at 12-26, City of Portland, No. 3:12 Civ. \n2265 (D. Or. Dec. 18, 2012) (explaining that proposed consent decree conflicted with numerous \nsections of the collective bargaining agreement).  Here, the Unions merely provide a list of \npolicy changes contemplated by the Remedial Order and claim that unspecified state law rights \nare implicated.  \nThe Unions’ final argument is that they need not specify the rights interfered with, but \nneed only show a “possibility” that the Remedial Order “may” interfere with their collective \nbargaining rights.  PBA Mem. 14; SBA Mem. 15-16.  The Unions contend that they have a right \nto intervene where there is even the slightest dispute that collective bargaining rights may be \nimplicated.  See City of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d at 400 (“[T]o the extent that it is disputed whether \nor not the consent decree conflicts with the [collective bargaining agreement], the [PPL] has the \nright to present its views on the subject to the district court.”).  To generate a dispute, the Unions \ncite several BCB and PERB decisions to show that certain terms in the Remedial Order are \ndebatably within the scope of topics that must be bargained over under the CBL.  In particular, \nthey assert that the introduction of new training and monitoring policies and body-worn cameras \nare disputed topics.  The cases they cite, however, do not support the Unions’ position.   \nWith respect to changes in training, the Unions cite two BCB decisions, Uniformed Fire \nOfficers, Local 854, IAFF, AFL-CIO v. City of New York, Decision No. B-20-92, 49 OCB 20 \n \n79\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 80 of 108\n(BCB 1992), and City of New York v. Uniformed Firefighters Ass’n, Decision No. B-43-86, 37 \nOCB 43 (BCB 1986), for the proposition that training is subject to mandatory bargaining “to the \nextent the City requires [it] as a qualification for continued employment.”  PBA Mem. 17.  In \nboth cases employees were required to obtain new licenses or certifications as a condition of \ntheir continued employment.  See, e.g., Uniformed Fire Officers, Local 854, IAFF, AFL-CIO v. \nCity of New York, 49 OCB 20 at 7-9 (holding that a newly established requirement that \nfirefighters obtain CPR certifications as a condition of employment would be subject to \nmandatory collective bargaining); City of New York v. Uniformed Firefighters Ass’n, 37 OCB 43  \nat 16 (The amount of firearms training the City provided to fire marshals was not subject to \nmandatory bargaining, because even though the City required fire marshals to pass an annual \ntest, there were no adverse employment consequences alleged for failing.).  The Unions do not \nallege that the Remedial Order contemplates imposing a licensing or certification scheme.  \nMoreover, according to both BCB decisions, “the establishment of training procedures, in most \ncircumstances, is a . . . management right and not a mandatory subject of bargaining.”  Id. at 15. \nWith respect to body cameras and performance evaluation procedures, the Unions cite \ntwo cases in support of their argument that these topics “might” be subject to mandatory \nbargaining.  See PBA Mem. 16-17.  These cases are inapposite.  In Patrolmen’s Benevolent \nAss’n of the City of New York, Inc. v. City of New York, 6 OCB2d 36 (BCB 2013), the BCB \nheld that bargaining over the procedural aspect of evaluations is mandatory (i.e., the frequency \nof evaluations), but the substance of evaluations (i.e., the actual criteria therein) “fall within an \nemployer’s rights under § 12-307(b) to determine the ‘methods, means and personnel’ by which \ngovernment operations are conducted.”  Id. at 15.  Here, the Remedial Order addresses only \nsubstantive policy changes, not any of the related procedural aspects.  Floyd, 959 F. Supp. 2d at \n \n80\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 81 of 108\n675-86.  In In re the City of New York, 40 PERB ¶ 3017, Case No. DR-119, (PERB Aug. 29, \n2007), the PERB held that although the decision to provide officers with bullet proof vests was \na managerial prerogative, practical impacts, such as the frequency of updating the vests, were \nbargainable topics.  In so holding, the PERB reiterated that equipment, such as body cameras, \n“relate[s] directly to the manner and means that police services are provided, thereby \nconstituting a managerial prerogative.”  Id.   \nMore broadly, the Unions’ complain that by conceding liability and dropping the appeals, \nthe City is violating CBL § 12-306(5), which does not permit the City “to unilaterally make any \nchange as to any mandatory subject of collective bargaining or as to any term and condition of \nemployment established in the prior contract.”  N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 12-306(5).  As discussed, \nthe Remedial Order does not implicate any interest subject to collective bargaining.  More \nimportantly, the Union’s rights under this subsection are only triggered, according to the plain \nlanguage of the statute, if the City attempts unilateral changes.  Here, the source of the changes is \na court order, not a unilateral City decision.  Thus, the Unions’ rights under this provision are not \nat issue here.   \nFurthermore, it is well established that “there are prohibited subjects about which the \nparties may not negotiate, because to do so would be contrary to public policy, statute or \ndecisional law.”  Sheppard, 1998 WL 397846, at *7.  The Injunction, Liability, and Remedial \nOrders, finding the City liable for its unconstitutional stop-and-frisk policy constitute decisional \nlaw.  And “there is no more compelling public policy than compliance with the mandates of the \nUnited States Constitution.”  Id. at *8.  “[R]esponsibilities conferred upon the City of New York \n(and all other state and local governments), by the federal courts,” such as those at issue here, \n“for safeguarding the constitutional rights of” citizens, “cannot be delegated, abnegated or \n \n81\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 82 of 108\nsurrendered through collective bargaining.”  Id.   \nIn sum, the Unions have not demonstrated a significant protectable interest in the \nRemedial Order sufficient to merit intervention for the purpose of appealing that Order.  They \nhave not asserted their alleged interests with particularity and where they have, they have \nmisstated the relevant law and misapplied it.  To the extent they claim an interest in a state law \nbargaining process between the Unions and the City, that process is not implicated where the \nunilateral changes at issue arise from a court order.  Moreover, even assuming the Remedial \nOrder does infringe on the Unions’ collective bargaining rights, the Court’s power to remedy \nconstitutional violations cannot be constrained by PERB or BCB decisions or the Unions’ state \nlaw rights.  Here, however, the Unions’ collective bargaining rights are not at issue, and the \nCourt’s exercise of its remedial powers has not, therefore, infringed upon those rights.  Having \nfound that the Unions lack a legally protectable interest in the Remedial Order, the Court need \nnot address the other factors courts apply under Rule 24(a).23  The Court shall, however, next \naddress an issue tied to Rule 24(a)’s interest requirement; assuming, arguendo, the Unions’ \ninterests are cognizable on a motion to intervene, whether the Unions would have standing to \nvindicate those interests on appeal.  \nD.  Standing \n \n“We have never before upheld the standing of a private party to defend the \nconstitutionality of a state statute when state officials have chosen not to,” wrote Chief Justice \nRoberts, and “[w]e decline to do so for the first time here.”  Hollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. \n2652, 2668 (2013).  Despite this guidance, and even though the lone municipal government \n                         \n23 For the same reasons, the Court denies the Unions’ request for permissive intervention under \nRule 24(b) because the Court finds that the Unions have not asserted “a claim or defense that \nshares with the main action a common question of law or fact” with respect to both the Liability \nand Remedial Orders.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B); see also NAACP, 413 U.S. at 365; United \nStates v. New York, 820 F.2d at 557-58. \n \n82\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 83 of 108\ndefendant no longer wishes to defend the constitutionality of its policy, the Unions insist they \nhave standing to appeal the Liability, Remedial, and Injunction Orders (collectively, the \n“Orders”).  They do not.  The Unions are not bound by the Orders nor have their members \nsuffered any concrete or particularized harm caused by them. \n1.  District Court Consideration of Appellate Standing  \nBefore explaining why the Unions lack appellate standing, the Court should clarify why a \ndistrict judge is even considering this issue in the context of a Rule 24 motion.  Plaintiffs raise \nappellate standing in their opposition papers, and the Unions address it in their replies, but \nneither explains why they are arguing the issue in the District Court rather than the Court of \nAppeals.  Standing is jurisdictional, and courts always have jurisdiction to decide their own \njurisdiction.  See In re Dairy Mart Convenience Stores, Inc., 411 F.3d 367, 374 (2d Cir. 2005).  \nRecognizing this Court’s limited jurisdiction and exercising restraint and deference, ordinarily \nthis Court would not opine on the Second Circuit’s jurisdiction to hear an appeal.  See American \nElec. Power Co., Inc. v. Connecticut, 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2540 (2011) (“[F]ederal district judges, \nsitting as sole adjudicators, lack authority to render precedential decisions binding other judges . \n. . .”).  But, acknowledging the importance of the issue to the parties, the Court endeavors to \ndetermine why appellate standing is relevant to adjudicating the motions to intervene.   \nThere is a conflict among the circuits as to whether Article III standing is required for a \nnon-party to intervene at the district court level.  See Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 68-69, 68 \nn.21 (1986) (observing that “[t]he Courts of Appeals have reached varying conclusions” on the \nissue, but declining to resolve the conflict).  The Second Circuit seems not to require a would-be \nplaintiff-intervenor to satisfy Article III standing.  See United States Postal Serv., 579 F.2d at \n190 (“The existence of a case or controversy having been established as between the United \n \n83\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 84 of 108\nStates Postal Service and the Brennans, there was no need to impose the standing requirement \nupon the proposed intervenor.”).  However, the intervenor-plaintiff in United States Postal \nService sought to assert the same claims as the existing plaintiff.  Here, the intervenor-defendants \nseek to pursue an agenda in conflict with the existing defendant.  In fact, adding to the \ncomplexity, the existing defendant, the City, seeks to terminate the case or controversy and the \nproposed intervenor-defendants seek to continue it.24  Thus, it is unclear that United States Postal \nService neatly disposes of the instant situation.  Cf. Hoblock v. Albany Cnty. Bd. of Elections, \n233 F.R.D. 95, 97 (N.D.N.Y. 2005) (reading United States Postal Service as exempting an \nintervenor from the Article III standing requirement if there is already a case or controversy in \nexistence between the original parties). \nPutting aside the circuit split, there is a different rationale for why an applicant’s Article \nIII standing on appeal is relevant to deciding a motion to intervene in the district court.  Rule \n24(a) requires that an intervenor have an interest that is “direct, substantial, and legally \nprotectable.”  Bridgeport Guardians, 602 F.3d at 473 (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted) (emphasis added).  Generally, a legally protectable interest is one which the law \n“accord[s] some degree of legal protection.”  Diamond, 476 U.S. at 75 (O’Connor, J. \nconcurring).  In particular, a Rule 24(a) applicant must be authorized to enforce that interest, and \nthe interest must be capable of being enforced through the law.  New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. \nUnited Gas Pipe Line Co., 732 F.2d 452, 463-64 (5th Cir. 1984).  If, for example, a would-be \nintervenor were to assert an interest in pursuing a claim that is barred by the statute of \nlimitations, then the interest would not be legally protectable; although the non-party’s interest \n                         \n24 See Matthew I. Hall, Standing of Intervenor-Defendants in Public Law Litigation, 80 Fordham \nL. Rev. 1539, 1542 (2012) (Because traditional standing analysis focuses on the plaintiff’s stake \nin the case or controversy, “volunteer” defendants’ attempts to intervene in cases that concern \nimportant issues of public law have been “under-theorized” by the courts.).  \n \n84\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 85 of 108\nmight otherwise be viable, the law does not afford it an avenue to vindicate that interest.  See \nCeribelli v. Elghanayan, 91 Civ. 3337, 1994 WL 529853, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 1994) \n(Where the plaintiff-intervenor’s claims are time-barred, intervention would be an exercise in \n“legal futility.”).25  Logically, from the plain meaning of the term “legally protectable,” the same \nreasoning extends to appellate standing:  to the extent that a post-judgment intervention applicant \ncontends that it must appeal a court order to protect its interest, then the applicant’s appellate \nstanding is highly relevant to the issue of whether the interest is legally protectable.  If Article \nIII’s standing requirement would not afford an avenue for the applicant to legally protect its \ninterest, allowing a non-party to intervene would be an exercise in legal futility.26 \nIn similar contexts, other district courts have reasoned that it would be futile to permit a \nnon-party who lacks appellate standing to intervene for the express purpose of appealing the \ndistrict court’s judgment.  See, e.g., Order at 15, Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 99 Civ. 2292 (N.D. \nCal. Aug. 4, 2010), Docket No. 709 (denying motion to intervene because Imperial County’s \nlack of Article III standing to defend California’s same-sex marriage ban on appeal “weigh[]ed \n                         \n25 Although the Ceribelli court analyzed the futility issue in the context of permissive \nintervention under Rule 24(b) and the broader issue of timeliness, the legal futility logic is no \nless applicable to Rule 24(a)’s legally protectable interest requirement for intervention as of \nright.  See Plumbers’ & Pipefitters’ Local No. 562 Supplemental Plan & Trust v. J.P. Morgan \nAcceptance Corp. I, 08 Civ. 1713, 2011 WL 6182090, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 13, 2011) (Under \nRule 24, “though not mentioned in the rule itself, ‘futility is a proper basis for denying a motion \nto intervene.’”) (quoting In re Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. Research Reports Secs. Litig., 02 Civ. \n1484, 02 Civ. 8472, 2008 WL 2594819, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jun. 26, 2008)). \n26 Some circuits have also held that where a party lacks a “significant protectable interest” under \nRule 24(a), “it necessarily follows that they lack Article III standing . . . .”  See Perry, 630 F.3d \nat 906; Roeder v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 333 F.3d 228, 233 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Sokaogon \nChippewa Cmty. v. Babbitt, 214 F.3d 941, 946 (7th Cir. 2000).  Thus, inquiring about Article III \nstanding after holding that an applicant does not have a significant protectable interest, as this \nCourt has just done, would be “purely academic,” Roeder, 333 F.3d at 233, and redundant \n“[f]rom a pragmatic standpoint,” Sokaogon, 214 F.3d at 946.  The Second Circuit, however, has \nnot expressly adopted this rule.  Accordingly, although analyzing standing invites redundancy, \nthe Court declines to hold that the Unions automatically lack standing because they lack an \ninterest under Rule 24(a). \n \n85\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 86 of 108\nagainst permitting” it to intervene in the district court), aff’d, 630 F.3d 898, 906 (9th Cir. 2011); \nTummino v. Hamburg, 260 F.R.D. 27, 30 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (holding that on a post-judgment \nintervention motion, would-be intervenors seeking to intervene to appeal must establish that they \nhave “standing to intervene” when the party on whose side intervention could have been sought \nduring the course of the litigation has decided not to appeal); see also Transcript of Oral Order at \n49:15-21, 50:10-12, Geiger v. Kitzhaber, 13 Civ. 1834 (D. Or. May 14, 2014), Docket No. 115  \n(denying a motion to intervene by a group opposed to same-sex marriage because they failed to \nshow they would have standing to appeal the judgment after the state refused to defend its same-\nsex marriage ban).  Persuaded by these authorities that Rule 24(a)’s “legally protectable interest” \nrequirement compels a court to consider whether certain proposed intervenors have standing to \nappeal in the absence of the originally aggrieved party, the Court now turns to the issue of \nwhether the Unions have standing to pursue the City’s appeal. \n2.  Standing to Appeal the Liability Order \nThe Unions assert that they have standing to appeal the Liability Order “because the \nCourt in that opinion made specific factual findings regarding individual [union members], \naccusing them of violating the Constitution, not telling the truth, and other disparaging \nconclusions based on limited and unreliable evidence.”  SBA Reply Mem. 16.  More broadly, the \nUnions claim to have standing because the “Court’s findings that the NYPD, through its officers, \nhave engaged in systematic racial discrimination and have made at least 200,000 unlawful stops \nare premised upon fundamental legal errors that have caused serious reputational harm to the \nofficers and should be reviewed by the Second Circuit.”  PBA Reply Mem. 18.  Although the \nCity initially appealed, the Unions complain that “the City now has turned its back on the \nofficers of the NYPD, requesting a remand for the avowed purposes of leaving the highly \n \n86\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 87 of 108\nprejudicial findings of the Court unreviewed.”  PBA Mem. 2.  Thus, the Unions wish to step into \nthe City’s shoes and “continue the appeal that the City has” abandoned.  PBA Reply Mem. 6.  \nAlthough standing cases typically address whether a plaintiff has satisfied the \nrequirement when commencing a lawsuit, Article III requires an “actual controversy” throughout \nall stages of litigation.  Hollingsworth, 133 S. Ct. at 2661.  Accordingly, standing “must be met \nby persons seeking appellate review, just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first \ninstance.”  Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 64 (1997).  The same \nrequirement applies where an intervenor seeks to “continue a suit in the absence of the party on \nwhose side intervention was permitted.”  Diamond, 476 U.S. at 68; see also Schulz v. Williams, \n44 F.3d 48, 52 (2d Cir. 1994).27  The intervenor-appellant has standing to appeal only if it has \n“suffered an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the challenged action and that is likely to be \nredressed by the relief requested.”  Schulz, 44 F.3d at 52.  To suffer an “injury in fact,” an \nintervenor must have more than an “abstract concern” or “a mere interest in the problem.”  \nDiamond, 476 U.S. at 67 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Rather, it must have experienced \n“an invasion of a legally-protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized . . . and (b) \nactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 560 (1992) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  The party seeking to appeal \nmust have a “direct stake in the outcome of a litigation,” Schulz, 44 F.3d at 52 (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted), such that it is “likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that \nthe injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  “The presence of a disagreement, however sharp and acrimonious it may be, is \n                         \n27 The SBA contends that the correct legal standard to apply here is from Official Committee of \nUnsecured Creditors of WorldCom, Inc. v. SEC, 467 F.3d 73, 77-79 (2d Cir. 2006).  That case \ndid not address the Article III questions now before the Court; it discussed whether a non-party \nin the district court, who otherwise met Article III’s standing requirements, could intervene at the \nSecond Circuit to appeal the judgment.  Id. at 77 (citation omitted).   \n \n87\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 88 of 108\ninsufficient by itself to meet Art. III’s requirements.”  Diamond, 476 U.S. at 62.   \nFrom the Unions’ allegations it is clear that they do not claim to have suffered any direct \nreputational injury from the Liability Order.  The Unions do not allege, for example, that the \nCourt made “injurious findings” against the Unions, as unions.  Instead, the Unions’ theory of \nstanding is based on the claim that their members have suffered or will suffer reputational harm.  \nIn particular, the Unions appear to allege two distinct reputational injuries on behalf of two \ncategories of their members.  See PBA Mem. 3 (stating that the Unions’ purpose is “to appeal the \nDistrict Court’s prior Orders, so as to ensure that the Orders are reviewed on the merits and that \nthe NYPD and its members are not burdened and besmirched by findings . . . that are legally \ninfirm”) (emphasis added).  The first alleged reputational harm is with respect to individual \nofficers identified in the Orders, “whose conduct was directly placed at issue,” and who are \ninjured by the Court’s specific findings about them, i.e., because “[t]he Liability [Order] \nidentifies [officers] by name, asserts that they are untruthful, and concludes that numerous stops \nthat they supervised, approved, or conducted broke the law,” the findings “adversely affect the \ncareers and lives of these [officers].”  SBA Mem. 1, 13-14.  The second alleged reputational \nharm is with respect to all NYPD officers whose reputations are injured by the Court’s general \nfindings of widespread unconstitutional conduct, i.e., the anonymous officer is harmed by the \nfinding that “the men and women of the NYPD had purportedly committed more than 200,000 \nconstitutional violations” and the “highly injurious finding that the NYPD officers had engaged \nin intentional racial discrimination.”  PBA Mem. 1-2.   \nAlthough not mentioned in their papers, the Unions invoke the doctrine of associational \nstanding, “under which an organization may sue to redress its members’ injuries.”  United Food \n& Commercial Workers Union Local 751 v. Brown Grp., Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 552 (1996).  \n \n88\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 89 of 108\nWhereas Article III generally requires the participation of the party who is directly harmed, an \nassociation is permitted to rely on its members’ injuries to satisfy Article III because, in certain \ncircumstances, the interests of the association and “its members are in every practical sense \nidentical.”  NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 459 (1958).  Thus, even where it \nhas suffered no direct harm from the challenged action, an association has standing to litigate on \nbehalf of its members where “(a) its members would otherwise have standing . . . in their own \nright; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) \nneither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual \nmembers in the lawsuit.”  United Food, 517 U.S. at 553 (citations and internal quotations marks \nomitted).28 \nWith respect to both categories—the individually identified officers and all NYPD \nofficers—the threshold question for associational standing is whether a union member in either \ncategory “would otherwise have standing to sue in [her] own right.”  Id.  Thus, the Court \nundertakes to apply the Article III standing test—injury-in-fact, causation, and redressibility—to \nboth groups in order to make this determination, beginning with the individual officers identified \nin the Orders.   \n \n                         \n28 The PBA’s reply memorandum appears to argue that the PBA has standing, independent of \nany injury to its members, because it has suffered a reputational “taint” from the Liability \nOrder’s findings.  See PBA Reply Mem. 17.  The PBA does not explain how findings against the \nNYPD, the City, or even its members, taint the reputation of the PBA as a union.  Citing NCAA \nv. Governor of N.J. (“NCAA”), 730 F.3d 208, 218, 220 (3d Cir. 2013), the PBA claims it has \nstanding on its own because of the “unwanted association with an activity they and large portions \nof the public disapprove of.”  PBA Reply Mem. 17.  In NCAA, the Third Circuit held that sports \nleagues had standing to challenge a law that would permit gambling on the leagues’ games \nbecause, in part, their games might suffer a “taint” by the mere association with legalized \ngambling.  NCAA, 730 F.3d at 218, 220.  This argument warrants scant attention.  Nowhere does \nthe Liability Order attribute objectionable conduct to the Unions.  To the extent that union \nmembers claim they are tainted, that would suggest an associational injury, not an injury to the \nUnions as unions.  \n \n89\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 90 of 108\na.  Officers Identified by Name  \ni.  Injury-in-Fact \nThe Unions argue that officers mentioned by name “whose conduct was directly placed at \nissue” may claim reputational injury arising from the Liability Order.  PBA Mem. 2.  The Unions \ncontend that these officers who testified, were deposed, or whose behavior was evaluated by the \nCourt should have an opportunity to protect their reputations, which the City is refusing to do by \nnot pursuing an appeal.  PBA Mem. 7. \nThere is no dispute that, as a general matter, reputational harm may be an injury-in-fact.  \nSee, e.g., Meese v. Keene, 481 U.S. 465, 473 (1987) (having his films labelled “political \npropaganda” by the government could cause a cognizable injury to a litigant’s “personal, \npolitical, and professional reputation” sufficient to establish an injury-in-fact).  The Unions cite \nseveral additional cases where reputational harm constituted an injury-in-fact.  See, e.g., NCAA v. \nGovernor of New Jersey (“NCAA”), 730 F.3d 208 (3d Cir. 2013); Gully v. Nat’l Credit Union \nAdmin. Bd., 341 F.3d 155, 161-62 (2d Cir. 2003).29  Whereas the reputational harm in each of \nthese cases was asserted with some specificity, here, the Unions do not explain how individual \nofficers experience reputational injury from having been identified by name in the Liability \nOrder.  The Unions do not, for example, attached affidavits or declarations from any officers \nstating that their reputations have been harmed and describing the repercussions—such as losing \npromotions or benefits, or suffering the scorn of their peers or the community.   \nThe Unions respond that they do not need to explain how the findings in the Liability \n                         \n29 On June 20, 2014, the SBA submitted a letter to the Court noting a recent Supreme Court, \nNew York County decision in Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association v. City of New York, Index \nNo. 652550/13 (N.Y. Co. Sup. Ct. June 18, 2014), holding that police unions have standing \nunder New York law to challenge a municipal ordinance.  Letter, Floyd, ECF No. 463.  That \nstanding exists under state law is not determinative as to whether federal standing exists under \nArticle III.  See Hollingsworth, 133 S. Ct. at 2667 (“[S]tanding in federal court is a question of \nfederal law, not state law.”). \n \n90\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 91 of 108\nOrder cause reputational injury because it is “self-evident.”  SBA Reply Mem. 16 (citing Gully, \n341 F.3d at 161-62).  This is not consistent with the law.  Claiming reputational harm is not an \nexception or loophole that excuses litigants from satisfying Article III’s injury criteria.  The \nissue, as with any alleged harm, is whether it is also “concrete and particularized,” and “actual or \nimminent,” as opposed to “conjectural or hypothetical.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 960.  In Gully, the \nplaintiff suffered a tangible reputational injury, described by the Second Circuit as a “death \nknell” for her career, when a regulatory agency made findings of professional misconduct and \nunfitness.  Gully, 341 F.3d at 162.  Unlike here, Gully was a party to the action, and the harm did \nnot arise from a vicarious, attenuated claim.  In fact, in NCAA, Gully, and Meese, the litigants \nhad little trouble asserting a concrete and particularized reputational injury because, unlike here, \nthe harmed party was either a plaintiff or defendant in the district court.30   \nThe Unions’ papers offer no information as to how the City’s unwillingness to continue \nthe appeals produces anything but hypothetical reputational injuries.  In fact, the only place the \nUnions provide specificity is in the SBA’s papers, where it observes that the Liability Order \nidentifies Sergeants Jonathan Korabel, James Kelly, Daniel Houlahan, Raymond Stukes, \nCharlton Telford, and Michael Loria by name and, according to the SBA, finds variously that \nthey were “untruthful,” “broke the law,” conducted improper stops-and-frisks, inadequately \n                         \n30 The Unions’ also cite to Camreta v. Greene, 131 S. Ct. 2020 (2011), for the proposition that “a \ngovernment official has standing to appeal a finding that his actions were unconstitutional . . . \nbecause the ‘judgment may have a prospective effect,’ and ‘the official regularly engages’ in the \nacts found unconstitutional.”  PBA Mem. 12 (citing Camreta, 131 S. Ct. at 2029).  Their reliance \non Camreta is misplaced.  In holding that a prevailing party may nonetheless have standing to \nappeal in some limited circumstances, the Supreme Court expressly confined Camreta’s holding \nregarding prospective relief to the qualified immunity context in which a named defendant may \nprevail, even though the court finds that his or her behavior was unconstitutional.  Camreta, 131 \nS. Ct. at 2032-33.  Contrary to the Unions’ reading, the Supreme Court did not hold or even \nsuggest that, in an entirely different context—municipal liability under Monell—a non-party may \nappeal findings of liability against her employer merely because she regularly engages in the \nbehavior at issue.   \n \n91\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 92 of 108\nsupervised stops-and-frisks, bungled record-keeping, and created a “culture of hostility.”  SBA \nMem. 13.  First, the SBA’s description of the Court’s findings is inaccurate:  the Court held the \nCity, not any of these officers, liable for breaking the law.  Second, it is important to remember \nthat the Liability Order discusses each of these sergeants in their capacity as employees of the \nCity, in order to determine whether the City should be held liable for violating the Constitution.  \nThe Court credits or discredits their testimony and makes findings that they properly applied or \nmisapplied the Constitution in this very specific Monell liability context where Courts must \nanalyze the behavior of non-party municipal employees.  These sergeants are no different from \nany other government employees whose position regularly requires that they properly apply the \nlaw.  Such employees would understandably feel aggrieved if a court determines that they \nviolated the law, but the Second Circuit has made clear that “[t]o suffer a judicially cognizable \ninjury in fact an intervenor must have a direct stake in the outcome of a litigation rather than a \nmere interest in the problem.”  Schulz, 44 F.3d at 52 (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Thus, having asserted nothing more than general, unspecified reputational harm based \non dissatisfaction with the Court’s opinion rather than a direct stake in the litigation, the Unions \nhave failed to state an injury-in-fact on behalf of the officers identified by name.   \nEven assuming that the Unions had provided specificity, the named officers all share a \ncommon characteristic that makes it difficult to assert a reputational harm sufficient to confer \nstanding—they are all non-party participants in the judicial process.  Their status as non-party \nwitnesses or deponents does not convert them from “concerned bystanders” into injured Article \nIII litigants.  Diamond, 476 U.S. at 62 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  In fact, \nallowing non-party trial participants to claim harm from court findings raises serious concerns.  \n“[I]f injury to reputation is the guiding precept . . . there is no principled basis for distinguishing \n \n92\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 93 of 108\nbetween a chastised attorney and any other participant in the judicial process who becomes the \ntarget of the presiding judge’s opprobrium.”  In re Williams, 156 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir. 1998).  As \none distinguished jurist noted, under such a regime, “[l]awyers, witnesses, victorious parties, \nvictims, bystanders—all who might be subject to critical comments by a district judge—could \nappeal their slight if they could show it might lead to a tangible consequence.”  Bolte v. Home \nIns. Co., 744 F.2d 572, 573 (7th Cir. 1984) (Posner, J.). \nTaken to its logical conclusion, the Unions’ reputational injury theory extends beyond \nthose officers whose conduct was held to have violated the Constitution.  Officers found by the \nCourt to have complied with the law could arguably suffer reputational harm if the Second \nCircuit were to reverse the trial court’s positive ruling about them.  In fact, on this theory, all \nparticipants would have a reputational investment in a lawsuit:  the lay witness whom the court \ncredited will have a higher standing in the community, whereas the one who was not believed \nmight be shunned by neighbors and employers; the expert witness the court sided with will \ngarner acclaim and prosper, whereas the one whose testimony the court rejected will lose \nbusiness; the lawyer whose line of reasoning the court adopted will attract clients and move up \nthe ladder while the lawyer whose arguments the court rejected will not make partner.  The \npolicy implications of this view are stunning:  a judge’s opinion could not discuss non-party \nparticipants without inviting endless litigation.   \nIn sum, because the Unions’ theory of reputational injury to non-party participants in the \njudicial process is not supported by factual details and lacks any limiting principle, the Unions \nhave failed to state that an individual union member in the identified officer category suffered an \ninjury-in-fact under Article III.  Accordingly, the Unions fail to meet the first element required to \nassert associational standing.     \n \n93\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 94 of 108\nii.  Causation \nEven if the subset of officers identified by name in the Liability Opinion could assert \nreputational harm arising from the Liability Order, they would lack standing because they cannot \nsatisfy the causation element under Article III.  To establish causation, the intervenor-appellant \nmust show an “injury caused by the judgment rather than [an] injury caused by the underlying \nfacts.”  Tachiona v. United States, 386 F.3d 205, 211 (2d Cir. 2004) (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Although the Second Circuit has not had occasion to explain the \ndifference between an injury caused by the judgment and one owing to the underlying facts, \nother circuits have.  See, e.g., Nisus Corp. v. Perma-Chink Sys., Inc., 497 F.3d 1316, 1321 (Fed. \nCir. 2007) (non-party lacked standing to challenge “subsidiary findings made in support of the \ncourt’s ultimate . . . legal conclusion that [plaintiff’s] patent was unenforceable”); Horizon Bank \n& Trust Co. v. Massachusetts, 391 F.3d 48, 53 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004) (litigant lacked standing where \nhis injury related to “only [to] subsidiary issues, and not the judgment itself”); Weissman v. \nQuail Lodge, Inc., 179 F.3d 1194, 1199-1200 (9th Cir. 1999) (“[T]he district court’s comments \nalone are not sanctions, but rather are merely its factual findings made in support of the Order.  \n[Therefore, w]e find no basis independently to review the allegedly derogatory statements about \n[appellant] . . . . [B]ecause the words themselves do not constitute sanctions, we conclude that \nthey are not independently reviewable.”); Warner/Elektra/Atl. Corp. v. Cnty. of DuPage, 991 \nF.2d 1280, 1282 (7th Cir. 1993) (“If an appellant is complaining not about a judgment but about \na finding . . . the appeal does not present a real case or controversy.”) (emphasis added). \nThe Federal Circuit’s ruling in Nisus Corp. is instructive.  Nisus sued Perma-Chink for \npatent infringement.  497 F.3d at 1318.  Perma-Chink responded that the patent itself was invalid \nbecause Nisus had obtained it through “inequitable conduct.”  Id.  The district court agreed, \n \n94\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 95 of 108\nholding that the underlying inequitable conduct rendered the patent unenforceable, and entered \njudgment in favor of Perma-Chink.  Nisus and Perma-Chink settled all other aspects of the \nlawsuit and both disclaimed any interest in appealing the judgment.  Michael Teshner, an \nattorney who assisted Nisus in obtaining the patent, moved to intervene.  Because he had helped \nNisus obtain the patent and his conduct was determined to be “inequitable,” Teshner sought \nintervention in order to clear his name by appealing the judgment.  The district court denied his \nmotion and the Federal Circuit affirmed, finding that the district court did not err because even if \nTeshner had intervened, he would have lacked standing to appeal.  Teshner’s injury, the court \nreasoned, arose not from the judgment but from the underlying findings regarding his conduct.   \nThe same is true in this case.  Assuming the named officers could identify a reputational \ninjury-in-fact, such an injury would flow from the Court’s findings, not the Orders.  Looking no \nfurther than the Unions’ papers, the Unions repeatedly state that their quarrel is with the findings: \n  “The [Unions] seek to intervene . . . to ensure that . . . its members are not \nburdened and besmirched by findings . . . that are legally infirm.”  PBA \nMem. 3 (emphasis added). \n \n  “The [Unions] have a vital interest in challenging these erroneous and \ndamaging findings about their members conduct, findings that have chilled \nlawful and proactive police conduct . . . and that would unfairly undermine \npublic confidence in their work.”  Id. 14 (emphasis added). \n \n  “[T]he  SBA  should  be  permitted  to  defend  its  members  against  .  .  . \nfindings made by this Court [] that they violated the Constitution.”  SBA \nMem. 1-2 (emphasis added). \n \n  “SBA  members  also  have  interests  affected  by  the  Liability  Opinion, \nbecause the Court . . . made specific factual findings regarding individual \nsergeants, accusing them of violating the Constitution, not telling the truth, \nand  other  disparaging  conclusions  based  on  limited  and  unreliable \nevidence.”  SBA Reply Mem. 16 (emphasis added).   \n \nLikewise, the Second Circuit’s remand characterizes the Unions’ intervention motion as an effort \n“to contest findings by the District Court the [U]nions believe to be unwarranted.”  Ligon, 743 \n \n95\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 96 of 108\nF.3d at 364-65 (emphasis added).  Moreover, the Unions acknowledge that the City, not the \nofficers, was the subject of the judgment, stating, “[o]n August 12, 2013, following a nine-week \nbench trial, the Court issued and entered the Liability Opinion, finding the City liable for \nviolating plaintiffs’ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.”  SBA Mem. 8 (emphasis added).   \nAlthough the Liability Order contains findings regarding identified officers, the Court did \nnot rely exclusively on these findings to support its holding that the City is liable for violating \nthe Constitution.  The Court evaluated plenty of evidence not involving named officers that \ncould have formed the basis for establishing liability against the City.  Consider an alternative \nscenario:  if the Court had made identical factual findings but held that the City was not liable \nbecause it was not deliberately indifferent to the unlawful stops-and-frisks, then the City would \nhave no adverse judgment against it, but union members would nonetheless be confronted with \nthe purportedly injurious findings.  In this scenario, it is clear that the identified officers would \nbe appealing findings, not a judgment.  Put differently, just because the Court’s overall judgment \nof liability incorporates the supposedly injurious findings does not mean that those findings and \nthe judgment are one and the same.  Accordingly, the Unions also fail the associational standing \ntest because they cannot show causation, which is required for any of the identified officers to \n“have standing . . . in their own right” to appeal.  United Food, 517 U.S. at 553. \niii.  Individual Participation Required \nWith regard to identified officers, the Unions also fail the third prong of associational \nstanding, i.e., neither “the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of \nindividual members in the lawsuit.”  Id.  The Supreme Court has explained that associations do \nnot have standing under this prong when “whatever injury may have been suffered is peculiar to \nthe individual member concerned, and both the fact and extent of injury would require \n \n96\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 97 of 108\nindividualized proof.”  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 515-16 (1975).  Instead, the harm must be \n“common to the entire membership” and “shared by all in equal degree.”  Id. at 515. \nThe Liability Order mentions numerous officers by name because numerous officers \ntestified at trial, were deposed during discovery, or otherwise participated in the Floyd trial.  To \nthe extent any has suffered reputational injury, it arises from the specific findings made about the \nparticular officer, e.g., an officer whose testimony was rejected as untruthful would suffer a \ndifferent reputational harm compared to an officer who was found to have failed to properly \nsupervise a subordinate’s stop-and-frisk.  There is no singular reputational injury that all the \nnamed officers share in common.  Accordingly, associational standing is not available to \nvindicate this purported harm because the injury to this category of union members is so specific \nthat it would require the participation of individual union members.     \nb.  All NYPD Officers:  No Injury-in-Fact \nThe Unions also claim associational standing on behalf of all NYPD officers, whom they \nallege are harmed by general findings of widespread constitutional violations and by the finding \nof liability against the City.  See PBA Mem. 1-3 (findings that “the men and women of the \nNYPD had purportedly committed more than 200,000 constitutional violations” and the “highly \ninjurious finding that the NYPD officers had engaged in intentional racial discrimination” \nbesmirch the reputations of the “NYPD and its members”).  Whether the Unions have standing to \nappeal the Liability Order on behalf of this second, broader category of officers depends on \nwhether an individual officer in that category would have standing to appeal in his or her own \nright.  Thus, the question is whether an anonymous officer would be able to assert an injury-in-\nfact caused by the Orders sufficient to confer standing.   \nAlthough officers mentioned by name in the Orders may feel that their reputations have \n \n97\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 98 of 108\nbeen harmed due to the public evaluation of their conduct, it is less clear how anonymous \nofficers with no connection to this litigation might suffer reputational injury from a finding that \ntheir employer’s policy violates the Constitution.  The Unions offer no explanation other than to \nstate the conclusion that such officers are in fact harmed.   In the absence of an explanation, the \nCourt construes two alternative theories of injury from a close reading of the Unions’ papers.   \nUnder the first theory, the Unions assert that they must be permitted to defend their \nmembers, “who were unfairly accused of violating and found to have violated the Constitution, \nagainst further harm to their reputations and livelihoods that would result from the City’s \nconcession of liability on their behalf.”  SBA Mem. 11-12.  Although the City initially indicated \nit would appeal, “the City now has turned its back on the officers of the NYPD, requesting a \nremand for  the avowed purposes of leaving the highly prejudicial findings of the Court \nunreviewed.”  PBA Mem. 2.  On this view, the reputational injury that has befallen or will befall \nan anonymous officer is a consequence not of the Orders alone but of the City’s acquiescence to \nthem.  In other words, the Court’s findings cause harm to the anonymous officer because the City \nis leaving the findings “unreviewed.”  SBA Reply Mem. 16.   \nThis theory of injury amounts to a generalized grievance about how best to interpret and \napply the Constitution.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 573-74.  The Supreme Court has warned that Article \nIII standing “is not to be placed in the hands of concerned bystanders, who will use it simply as a \nvehicle for the vindication of” their interests.  Diamond, 476 U.S. at 62 (citations and internal \nquotation marks omitted).  The hypothetical, anonymous NYPD officer would be claiming \nreputational harm based on a disagreement with the Court and the City about how to follow the \nlaw.  This is not a “concrete and particularized injury” but rather a generalized interest in \nensuring the City’s adherence to constitutional norms, albeit according to the Unions’ point of \n \n98\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 99 of 108\nview.  Hollingsworth, 133 S. Ct. at 2662; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 573-74.  The Unions do “not state \nan Article III case or controversy” because they raise “only a generally available grievance about \ngovernment—claiming only harm to [their] and every citizen’s interest in proper application of \nthe Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits [them] \nthan it does the public at large.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 573-74. \nThe second way to construe the Unions’ position is that the anonymous officer suffers a \nreputational injury as an employee whose reputation is tainted by her association with her \nemployer or fellow officers against whom negative findings were made.  On this view, the \nanonymous officer’s purported injury is narrower than the general bystander’s because she is the \nemployee who previously implemented the City’s tainted policy.  Stated differently, the \nanonymous officer’s reputation is tied to that of her employer, and she is injured because her \nemployer is injured.  However, construing reputational injury as a kind of taint owing to a \nfinding of liability against an employer has been rejected as too generalized.  See Perry, 630 F.3d \nat 903-04.       \nIn Perry, the trial court denied motions to intervene by Imperial County and an employee \nin the county clerk’s office, who were concerned that the State of California would not appeal \nthe court’s decision holding California’s same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional.  Id. at 902.  \nThe would-be intervenors alleged a “direct interest in the same-sex marriage debate” because, as \nemployees, they performed “practical, day-to-day responsibilities relating to new marriages.”  \nOrder at 5, Perry, 99 Civ. 2292 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 4, 2010), Docket No. 709 (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Moreover, as employees, they argued that they needed to ensure \nappellate review in order to avoid “significant confusion in the performance of their legal \nduties.”  Id. at 9 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The district court denied the \n \n99\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 100 of 108\nmotion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that government employees are agents, \nendowed only with the power given to them by their principal—the government employer.  \nPerry, 630 F.3d at 903-04.  Such employees are not free to adopt their own view of the law; \ninstead, they implement their employer’s policies based on their employer’s legal analysis.  Id.  \nThus, “[w]hile being bound by a judgment may be a[] concrete and particularized injury \nsufficient to confer standing to appeal . . . the injury” owing from the injunction, “if any, would \nbe to the [government employer], not [an employee].”  Id. at 904 (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the employee “may not rely upon \nthe [employer]’s injury to assert her own . . . standing to appeal.”  Id. \nThe same reasoning applies here.  The Court determined that the City, not its employees, \nviolated the Constitution, and it enjoined the City, not its employees, from engaging in unlawful \nstops-and-frisks.  The Court directed the City to remedy the illegality by revising its training, \nsupervision, monitoring, and other policies.  Like the deputy clerk in Perry, NYPD officers are \naffected by the Orders in a sense:  they were the ones implementing the City’s unlawful policy, \nand they will be the ones to implement the corrective measures required by the Remedial Order.  \nHowever, as with the deputy clerk in Perry, the NYPD officers are not bound in their individual \ncapacities because they have no independent authority to conduct stops-and-frisks based on their \nown analysis of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Instead, they rely on their employer, \nthe City, to provide instruction, training, and authorization.  Thus, like the deputy clerk, they \nhave suffered no injury-in-fact as employees who perform the daily municipal tasks at issue.  \nThe anonymous officer cannot rely on the purported reputational harm to his employer to assert \nan injury-in-fact.  Accordingly, the anonymous officer lacks standing, and the Unions, therefore, \ncannot satisfy the first element of the associational standing test—which requires that a member \n \n100\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 101 of 108\nhave standing in her own right—for this category of NYPD officers.   \n3.  Standing to Appeal the Remedial Order  \nThe Unions’ alleged collective bargaining injuries owing to the Remedial Order fare no \nbetter under Article III.  As discussed, supra, the “Immediate Reforms” ordered in Floyd and the \nremedies ordered in Ligon cover topics that are not subject to mandatory bargaining under New \nYork law.  With respect to the ongoing consultative process in Floyd, the Unions are invited but \nare not required to participate in the development of the “Joint Process Reforms.”  In the \nlanguage of Hollingsworth, the Unions have “not been ordered to do or refrain from doing \nanything.”  133 S. Ct. at 2662.  Moreover, these additional remedies have yet-to-be developed.  \nThus, an argument that unknown provisions harm collective bargaining rights is speculative at \nbest.  It is well-established that “[a]llegations of possible future injury are not sufficient.”  \nClapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1147 (2013) (citations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  Article III standing cannot be based upon “theories that require guesswork as to \nhow independent decision makers will exercise their judgment.” Id. at 1150 (citations and \ninternal quotation marks omitted). \n4.  Conclusion:  the Unions Lack Article III Standing \nIn sum, because Rule 24 requires that an intervenor have a “direct, substantial, and \nlegally protectable” interest, a would-be intervenor seeking to pursue an appeal that the \noriginally aggrieved party has disclaimed must show that it has Article III standing to maintain \nthe appeal.  Bridgeport Guardians, 602 F.3d at 473 (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Otherwise, the proposed intervenor’s interest is not “legally protectable.” \nThe Unions lack associational standing because they cannot show that any of their \nmembers would have standing in their own right.  Neither the officers identified by name in the \n \n101\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 102 of 108\nLiability Order nor the anonymous NYPD officers have suffered an injury-in-fact arising from \nthe Liability Order.  The Unions assert injuries to their members that are speculative, abstract, \nand amorphous.  Assuming the alleged injuries occurred, they were not caused by the Court’s \nOrders, but by the Court’s findings.  In particular, their members’ status as non-party participants \nin the judicial process and as municipal employees who have suffered no injury apart from their \nmunicipal employer present substantial hurdles to standing.  Moreover, with respect to the subset \nof union members identified by name, their hypothetical injuries would be too individualized to \nsupport associational standing.  The Unions lack standing in their own right to challenge the \nRemedial Order because they have not been ordered to “do or refrain from doing anything.”  \nHollingsworth, 133 S. Ct. at 2662.  Any future participation in the Joint Remedial Process is \nvoluntary, and any injury based on not-yet-developed reforms is speculative.   \nAlthough framed as a concern over reputational harm and collective bargaining rights, \nthe gravamen of the Unions’ motions is that they disagree with the Court for ruling against the \nCity and the City for refusing to appeal.  Faced with a similar situation in which a private group \nmoved to intervene to defend Oregon’s ban on same-sex marriage when the state no longer \nwould, the district court commented, “[i]t would be remarkable, following the Hollingsworth \nopinion, for a court to substitute the Executive Branch of government with a private interest \norganization simply because the organization disagrees with the legal interpretation of [the \nstate’s] elected official.”  Transcript of Oral Order at 52:1-5, Geiger, 13 Civ. 1834 (D. Or. May \n14, 2014), Docket No. 115.  It would be no less remarkable here.  The Unions seek to force the \nCity into another round of litigation that the City does not want to pursue in order to vindicate on \nappeal a policy the City does not want to implement.  In such public law cases, a federal court \nmay be especially “eager . . . to tell everyone its view of the legal question at the heart of this \n \n102\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 103 of 108\ncase.”  United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2698 (2013) (Scalia, J. dissenting).  However, \nArticle III sometimes requires federal courts to “put aside the natural urge to proceed directly to \nthe merits of [an] important dispute and to ‘settle’ it for the sake of convenience and efficiency.”  \nRaines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 820 (1997) (footnote omitted).   \nHaving concluded that the Unions lack standing to appeal, the Court also finds that the \nUnions lack an avenue to vindicate their purported interests under Rule 24.  Granting leave to \nintervene in the district court knowing well that the appellate courts will turn the Unions away \nwould be an exercise in futility.31 \nII.  Other Grounds for Intervention; the Parties’ Motion to Modify \n \n  Having addressed the Unions’ motions to intervene for the purpose of appealing the \nInjunction, Liability, and Remedial Orders, the Court now turns to three remaining matters:  (1) \nthe Unions’ request to intervene for the purposes of (a) participating in “court-supervised \nsettlement discussions” and (b) opposing the parties’ motion to modify the Remedial Order; (2) \nthe merits of the parties’ motion to modify the Remedial Order; and (3) the Unions’ request to \nparticipate in the implementation of the Remedial Order.   \nA.  The Unions’ Request to Participate in the Settlement of Floyd and Ligon \nOn February 21, 2014, the Second Circuit remanded Floyd and Ligon “to the District \nCourt for the purpose of supervising settlement discussions among such concerned or interested \nparties as the District Court deems appropriate, and resolving the motions to intervene.”  Ligon, \n743 F.3d at 365.  Accordingly, on February 25, 2014, this Court directed the parties to indicate \n“whether they desire the Court’s participation in aid of settlement.”  Floyd, ECF No. 428; Ligon, \nECF No. 167.  By letter dated March 4, 2014, Plaintiffs and the City stated that they had already \n                         \n31 In exercise of the Court’s discretion, the Court also denies the Unions’ request for permissive \nintervention under Rule 24(b) on the ground that they lack appellate standing.  See United States \nPostal Serv., 579 F.2d at 191 (permissive intervention is wholly discretionary in the trial court). \n \n103\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 104 of 108\n“reached an agreement in principle for resolving the City’s appeals in both Floyd and Ligon.”  \nFloyd, ECF No. 433; Ligon, ECF No. 169.  Apparently, the parties did not need the Court’s \nassistance.  Thus, to the extent the Unions’ seek intervention to participate in “court-supervised \nsettlement discussions,” that issue is moot.   \nAfter reaching their agreement, Plaintiffs and the City filed a joint motion to modify the \nRemedial Order to reflect the terms of their proposed resolution of the appeals, which is now \nbefore the Court.  Thus, the only remaining settlement-related process in which the Unions might \nrequest a role is the Court’s consideration of the parties’ motion to modify the Remedial Order.  \nHowever, the Unions have already participated in that process by filing two briefs in opposition, \nboth of which have been carefully considered by the Court.  See PBA Mem., Floyd, ECF No. \n459; SBA Mem., Floyd, ECF No. 461.  Therefore, it would be futile to permit the Unions to \nintervene in order to participate in a process in which they have already participated.  \nAccordingly, the Unions’ request to intervene for the purpose of opposing the parties’ motion to \nmodify the Remedial Order is also denied as moot. \nB.  Modification of the Remedial Order \nIn remanding Floyd and Ligon to this Court, the Second Circuit vacated its stay of these \ncases “insofar as is necessary to effectuate a settlement.”  Ligon, 743 F.3d at 365.  Plaintiffs and \nthe City have reached a settlement of the City’s appeals and now move, pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 54(b) and the Court’s inherent authority, for an order modifying the Remedial \nOrder such that the term of the court-appointed monitor is limited to three years, provided that \nthe City shows substantial compliance with the Remedial Order by the end of that term.  Joint \nMem., Floyd, ECF No. 458.  The Unions oppose the motion. \n  “The power of a court of equity to modify a decree on injunctive relief is long-\n \n104\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 105 of 108\nestablished, broad, and flexible.”  Brown v. Plata, 131 S. Ct. 1910, 1946 (2011) (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).  The district court derives this power in part from Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 54(b), which provides that such injunctive orders “may be revised at any \ntime.”  Fed. R. Civ. P 54(b).  More broadly, the district court has inherent authority to revise or \nmodify such orders.  See United States v. LoRusso, 695 F.2d 45, 53 (2d. Cir. 1982).  In \nexercising its discretion to modify an injunctive order, a court should not impose modifications \nthat “thwart[] the purpose behind the injunction.”  Sierra Club, 732 F.2d at 257 (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).   \nThe parties contend that this modification—a three-year cap on the monitor’s term \nprovided the City shows substantial compliance—will enable the Remedial Order to be \nimplemented more quickly, that it is consistent with the purpose of the Remedial Order, and that \nit is in keeping with other cases in which courts have appointed monitors to oversee institutional \nchanges to police departments.  In opposing the motion, the Unions reiterate their position on \nintervention and complain that the proposed modification “includes no mechanism for [the \nUnions] to present [their] collective bargaining concerns . . . or otherwise protect their rights.”  \nSBA Mem. 5, Floyd, ECF No. 461.  Also, because they allege that the City and Plaintiffs are no \nlonger adversarial, the Unions contend that the Court would benefit from the Unions’ perspective \nas a “counterweight” to the parties’ views when deciding whether the City has substantially \ncomplied.  Id.   \nThe Unions’ arguments, though not without merit, are premature.  To the extent that the \nJoint Remedial Process could produce reforms that implicate collective bargaining, the Unions, \nshould they choose to participate in that process, will be free to voice their concerns.  Also, when \nthe issue of substantial compliance arises at the conclusion of the three-year monitorship, the \n \n105\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 106 of 108\nUnions will have an opportunity to address that issue with the monitor and, by requesting amici \nstatus, the Court.   \nThe parties’ proposed modification is sensible and fair in light of the purpose of the \nRemedial Order.  Placing a limit on the monitor’s term that is tied to the City’s compliance with \nthe Remedial Order will help narrow the parties’ focus and timeline, and encourage swift \nimplementation of the forthcoming reforms.  Accordingly, the Court finds that the modification \nis equitable to the parties and promotes the public interest.  The modification is approved and \nshall be memorialized in a separate order to be issued forthwith. \nC.  Participation in the Remedial Phase \nThe Unions also generally request “to intervene at the post-judgment remedy phase” of \nFloyd and Ligon.  SBA Mem. 23.  Because the Unions provide no details, the Court undertakes \nto construe their application as broadly as possible.  First, the Unions state that they “seek[] the \nright to participate only in shaping the reforms to be approved by this Court.”  SBA Mem. 25.  \nTo the extent this implies that the Unions want a role in designing the Remedial Order, as \ndiscussed in detail supra, that request is untimely, and the Unions have failed to show that the \nRemedial Order implicates collective bargaining rights.  The reforms outlined in the Remedial \nOrder are the result of months of pre-trial proceedings, a nine-week trial in Floyd, a seven-day \nevidentiary hearing in Ligon, and substantial briefing by the parties and non-party stakeholders, \nwho proposed concrete remedial measures while the Unions sat silently on the sidelines.  \nMoreover, the Remedial Order is not “issued on consent and do[es] not arise from a settlement.”  \nLigon, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 686.  The time to shape its contents has passed.  The Unions’ request \nto intervene for this purpose is also denied.  \nTo the extent the Unions’ motions may be construed as a request to intervene in the \n \n106\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 107 of 108\nimplementation of the Remedial Order, that request is also moot in Floyd.  The Remedial Order \ncontemplates a two-stage process in Floyd:  an initial stage during which the Court will order a \nset of “Immediate Reforms,” and an ongoing phase, called the “Joint Remedial Process”: \nFirst, the Monitor will develop, in consultation with the parties, an initial set of \nreforms to the NYPD’s policies, training, supervision, monitoring, and discipline \nregarding  stop  and  frisk  (the  “Immediate  Reforms”).  These  reforms  will  be \ndeveloped and submitted to the Court as soon as practicable, and implemented \nwhen they are approved.  Second, the Facilitator will work with the parties and \nother  stakeholders  to  develop,  through  the  Joint  Remedial  Process,  a  more \nthorough  set  of  reforms  (the  “Joint  Process  Reforms”)  to  supplement,  as \nnecessary, the Immediate Reforms.  \n \nId.  The Court explicitly offers “police organizations” the opportunity to participate in the “Joint \nRemedial Process,” along with a variety of other “stakeholders.”  Floyd, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 686.  \nAgain, the Unions seek to intervene in a process where they have already been permitted to \nparticipate.  Whether the Unions are labeled “intervenors” or “stakeholders” their “particularly \nvaluable” perspective will be considered by the facilitator and monitor when crafting the reforms \nto be proposed for the Court’s approval.  Id. at 681. \n  With respect to Ligon, as discussed, the Remedial Order covers topics, including the \nadoption of a written policy regarding TAP-related stops, and changes to supervision, training, \nand monitoring of TAP-related stops, which do not implicate collective bargaining rights.  Thus, \nthe Unions’ request to participate in the remedial phase of Ligon is denied.    \nIn sum, the Unions’ requests to participate in the remedial phase are moot, and where \nthey are not, they are denied for the same reasons the Court denies the Unions’ motions to \nintervene in order to appeal the Remedial Order. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Unions’ motions to intervene are DENIED for three reasons:  (1) the motions are \nuntimely; (2) the Unions have no significant protectable interests relating to the subject of the \n \n107\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 197   Filed 07/30/14   Page 108 of 108\nlitigation that would warrant intervention; and (3) even if their alleged interests were cognizable, \nthe Unions lack standing to vindicate those interests on appeal. \nThe parties’ motion for an order modifying the Remedial Order is GRANTED.  The \nmodification shall be set forth in a separate order to be issued forthwith.  The Unions’ request to \nparticipate in the settlement of Floyd and Ligon is, therefore, DENIED as moot. \nThe Unions’ request to participate in the remedial phase of Floyd is also DENIED as \nmoot because the Remedial Order already offers “police organizations” the opportunity to \nparticipate in the development of reforms to NYPD stop-and-frisk policies and procedures \nthrough the “Joint Remedial Process.”  To the extent the Unions request to participate in the \nremedial phase of Ligon, that request is DENIED for the same reasons the Court denies their \nmotion to intervene for the purpose of appealing the Remedial Order.   \nHaving resolved the motions to intervene, and having approved the terms of the parties’ \nproposed resolution of the City’s appeals, the Court has continuing jurisdiction only “insofar as \nis necessary to effectuate a settlement.”  Ligon, 743 F.3d at 365.  Accordingly, by August 6, \n2014, the City shall submit a letter to the Court indicating the status of its pending appeals.  This \nCourt shall take no further action unrelated to effectuating the parties’ settlement unless and until \nthe Court of Appeals dissolves the stay or otherwise returns jurisdiction to the District Court. \nThe Clerk of Court shall terminate the motions at ECF Nos. 436 and 441 in Floyd and \nECF No. 171 in Ligon.       \nSO ORDERED. \n \nDated: July 30, 2014   \n  New York, New York  \n                 \n \n108",

SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.:\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThis case, filed in 2012, is one of three cases currently before this\nCourt challenging aspects of the New York City Police Department’s “stop and\nfrisk” practices.1  Of the three cases, this case is the most narrow.  It deals only\nwith stops made by the police on suspicion of trespass outside of certain privately-\nowned buildings in the Bronx.  But the legal issues raised by this case have roots\nthat stretch back decades.\nIn 1964, New York adopted the first version of its stop and frisk law,\nwhich has since been amended several times.  The essence of the law is that a\npolice officer may stop a person in a public place when he reasonably suspects that\nsuch person is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a crime, and the\n1 Floyd v. City of New York, filed in 2008, challenges the NYPD’s stop\nand frisk practices in general, arguing among other things that the NYPD is\nsystematically violating the rights of New York City’s residents and visitors under\nthe Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable searches, and under the\nFourteenth Amendment to be free from discrimination on the basis of race.  See\nFloyd v. City of New York, 283 F.R.D. 153, 159 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (granting class\ncertification).  Davis v. City of New York, filed in 2010, focuses on stop and frisk\npractices at public housing properties run by the New York City Housing\nAuthority (“NYCHA”).  Plaintiffs in Davis argue that the NYPD uses unlawful\nstops, searches, and arrests to enforce the prohibitions against trespassing on public\nhousing property.  See Davis v. City of New York, — F. Supp. 2d —, 2012 WL\n4813837, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2012) (granting in part and denying in part\ndefendants’ motions for summary judgment regarding individual plaintiffs’ arrests\nand tenancies).\n4\n\nofficer may demand of him his name, his address, and an explanation of his\nconduct.  Upon stopping a person, if the police officer reasonably suspects that he\nis in danger of physical injury, he may search the person for a deadly weapon.2  \nThis law and the policing practices associated with it have raised a\nhost of difficult questions, including:  (1) what is reasonable suspicion; (2) what\nconstitutes a stop; (3) what is a public place; (4) when is a stopped person free to\nwalk away from the police; and (5) when does an officer have grounds to\nreasonably suspect that he is danger of physical injury.  None of these questions\nare easily answered.\nIn 1968, the United States Supreme Court heard a challenge to New\nYork’s stop and frisk statute in the context of two criminal convictions, and made\nsome important points that bear repeating today.3  First, the Court held that\nalthough states may develop their own laws on stop and frisk, they may not\n“authorize police conduct which trenches upon Fourth Amendment rights,\nregardless of the labels which it attaches to such conduct.”4  The Court stated, in no\n2 See generally New York Criminal Procedure Law (“CPL”) § 140.50.\n3 See generally Sibron v. State of New York, 392 U.S. 40 (1968)\n(reversing conviction for failure to suppress evidence seized in an unlawful stop,\nand affirming conviction in a related appeal, finding that the seizure in latter case\nwas reasonable under the Fourth Amendment).\n4 Id. at 61.\n5\n\nuncertain terms, that the question is not whether a particular search was authorized\nby state law but “‘whether the search was reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.’”5  Second, the Court held that it would not judge the constitutionality\nof the New York statute on its face, but rather as applied to the particular facts of\nthe two cases it was reviewing.6  Third, the Court stressed that a police officer must\nhave reasonable grounds before he seizes a person.  In that regard the Court stated: \n“The police officer is not entitled to seize and search every person whom he sees\non the street or of whom he makes inquiries.”7\nIn confronting the issues addressed in this Opinion, I am keenly aware\nthat this Court does not stand in the shoes of the Police Department and is in no\nway qualified or empowered to engage in policy determinations.  The sole role of\nthe Court is to interpret and apply the law — in this case the Fourth Amendment of\nthe United States Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit — to the\n5 Id. (quoting Cooper v. State of California, 386 U.S. 58, 61 (1967)).\n6 See id. (“Our constitutional inquiry would not be furthered here by an\nattempt to pronounce judgment on the words of the statute.  We must confine our\nreview instead to the reasonableness of the searches and seizures which underlie\nthese two convictions.”).\n7 Id.  The Court continued:  “Before he places a hand on the person of a\ncitizen in search of anything, he must have constitutionally adequate, reasonable\ngrounds for doing so.”  Id.\n6\n\nspecific facts before it.  I have endeavored faithfully to carry out that limited role. \nMy object here is only to clarify what the law permits — and does not permit — an\nofficer to do when initiating and conducting a stop or stop and frisk of people in\nthe public areas outside of certain privately owned buildings in the Bronx.  \nPlaintiffs, all of whom are African-American or Latino residents of\nNew York,8 argue that the Police Department has a widespread practice of making\nunlawful stops on suspicion of trespass outside buildings in the Bronx that are\nenrolled in the Trespass Affidavit Program (“TAP”), which was formerly known in\nthe Bronx as Operation Clean Halls.9  This program allows “police officers to\npatrol inside and around thousands of private residential apartment buildings\nthroughout New York City.”10  Plaintiffs argue that the NYPD’s trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings are often made without reasonable suspicion, and thus\n8 See Complaint ¶¶ 11–23.\n9 See Ligon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. 2274, 2012 WL 3597066,\nat *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2012) (allowing preliminary injunction hearing to\nproceed).  For the history of TAP, see infra Part IV.B.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint\nconcerns stops in and around TAP buildings throughout New York City, but\nplaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction focuses solely on outside stops in the\nBronx.

Ohio, even limited stops and searches represent\n“an annoying, frightening, and perhaps humiliating experience,”16 and thus must be\nbased on reasonable suspicion.\nOn September 24, 2012, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary\ninjunction, seeking an order requiring the NYPD to create and implement new\npolicies, training programs, and monitoring and supervisory procedures that\nspecifically address the problem of unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP\nbuildings.17  The preliminary injunction hearing took place between October 15\nand November 7, 2012.18  This Opinion addresses plaintiffs’ motion.\n11 See Plaintiffs’ Revised Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of\nLaw (“Pl.

Findings ¶¶ 72–75.\n18 See Tr. 10/15 at 1; Tr. 11/7 at 1282.\n8\n\nI begin by summarizing the relevant legal standards, then state my\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law.  Based on all the evidence presented at the\nhearing, I conclude that plaintiffs have shown a clear likelihood of proving that\ndefendants have displayed deliberate indifference toward a widespread practice of\nunconstitutional trespass stops by the NYPD outside TAP buildings in the Bronx. \nThis conclusion is based on five categories of evidence, briefly summarized here\nand fully explored below:  (1) the testimony of Bronx Assistant District Attorney\nJeannette Rucker (“ADA Rucker”), who concluded that the NYPD frequently\nmade trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx for no reason other than\nthat the officer had seen someone enter and exit or exit the building; (2) a sample\nof “decline to prosecute” forms prepared by the Bronx District Attorneys’ Office,\nwhich revealed the alarming frequency of unlawful trespass stops in the vicinity of\nTAP buildings in the Bronx; (3) the testimony of eight plaintiffs and a non-party\nwitness, who described remarkably similar encounters with the police when\nstopped in the vicinity of TAP buildings in the Bronx; (4) the analysis by Dr.\nJeffrey Fagan, plaintiffs’ expert, of an NYPD database of recorded stops, which\nprovided further evidence of the frequency of apparently unlawful trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings in the Bronx; and (5) NYPD training materials that continue\nto misstate the minimal constitutional standards for making stops.\n9\n\nIn sum, while it may be difficult to say where, precisely, to draw the\nline between constitutional and unconstitutional police encounters, such a line\nexists, and the NYPD has systematically crossed it when making trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings in the Bronx.  For those of us who do not fear being stopped\nas we approach or leave our own homes or those of our friends and families, it is\ndifficult to believe that residents of one of our boroughs live under such a threat.19 \nIn light of the evidence presented at the hearing, however, I am compelled to\nconclude that this is the case.\nAs a result, plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction. \nHowever, with one exception, I am not yet ordering relief pending a further\nhearing on the appropriate scope of such relief.\nII. LEGAL STANDARD FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\n“‘A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded\nas of right.’”20  In general, to obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party\n19 To echo language quoted by Justice Thurgood Marshall, the evidence\nin this case “has evoked images of other days, under other flags, when no man\ntraveled . . . without fear of unwarranted interruption.”  Florida v.

VCG\nSpecial Opportunities Master Fund Ltd., 598 F.3d 30, 38 (2d Cir. 2010))).\n11\n\n‘substantial’ likelihood of success.”23 \nBecause plaintiffs seek mandatory injunctive relief including the\ndrafting and distribution of new policies, the development and implementation of\nnew training programs, and the implementation of new monitoring and supervision\nprocedures,24 they must establish a clear or substantial likelihood that they will\nsucceed at trial.\nIII. APPLICABLE LAW\nA. Sources of Liability\nPlaintiffs bring a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging violations of\ntheir Fourth Amendment rights by the City of New York and several of its\nemployees.25  As the Supreme Court established in Monell v. New York City\n23 Rodriguez v. DeBuono, 175 F.3d 227, 233 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting\nJolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 473–74 (2d Cir. 1996)).  The Second Circuit has\nrecognized that “[t]he distinction between mandatory and prohibitory injunctions is\nnot without ambiguities or critics, and that in a close case an injunction can be\nframed in mandatory or prohibitory terms.”  Jolly, 76 F.3d at 474 (quotation marks\nand citations omitted).\n24 See Pl. Findings ¶¶ 72–75.\n25 See Compl. ¶¶ 1, 203.  42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides:\nEvery  person  who,  under  color  of  any  statute,  ordinance,\nregulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . subjects, or causes\nto be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person\nwithin the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,\nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,\n12\n\nDepartment of Social Services,26 in order to have recourse against a municipality or\nother local government under section 1983, plaintiffs “must prove that ‘action\npursuant to official municipal policy’ caused the alleged constitutional injury.”27 \nIn general, “[o]fficial municipal policy includes the decisions of a government’s\nlawmakers, the acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so persistent and\nwidespread as to practically have the force of law.”28\nOne way to establish an official policy is through a showing of\n“deliberate indifference” by high-level officials.  “‘[W]here a policymaking official\nexhibits deliberate indifference to constitutional deprivations caused by\nsubordinates, such that the official’s inaction constitutes a deliberate choice, that\nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in\nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . .\n26 436 U.S. 658 (1978).  Interpreting the language of section 1983 and\nthe legislative history surrounding its passage in the Civil Rights Act of 1871, the\nCourt in Monell held that local governing bodies could be held liable either on the\nbasis of formally approved policy or on the basis of “‘customs’” or “‘usages.’”  Id.\nat 690–91 (quoting Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 167–68 (1970)). \nLater cases have “considerably broadened the concept of official municipal\naction.”  Amnesty Am. v. Town of W. Hartford, 361 F.3d 113, 125 (2d Cir. 2004).\n27 Cash v. County of Erie, 654 F.3d 324, 333 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting\nConnick v.

Town of E. Haven,\n691 F.3d 72, 82 (2d Cir. 2012), that the plaintiff there could have established\nmunicipal liability by showing:\na sufficiently widespread practice among police officers of abuse\nof the rights of black people to support reasonably the conclusion\nthat such abuse was the custom of the officers of the Department\n14\n\nA municipality may incur Monell liability based on deliberate\nindifference through its training practices.  Although “[a] municipality’s\nculpability for a deprivation of rights is at its most tenuous where a claim turns on\na failure to train,”33 the Supreme Court has held that “[w]hen city policymakers are\non actual or constructive notice that a particular omission in their training program\ncauses city employees to violate citizens’ constitutional rights, the city may be\ndeemed deliberately indifferent if the policymakers choose to retain that\nprogram.”34  “[D]eliberate indifference may be inferred where ‘the need for more\nor better supervision to protect against constitutional violations was obvious,’ but\nthe policymaker ‘fail[ed] to make meaningful efforts to address the risk of harm to\nplaintiffs[.]’”35\nand that supervisory personnel must have been aware of it but\ntook no adequate corrective or preventive measures (or some\ncombination of the two).\nJones, 691 F.3d at 82.  The Second Circuit thus continues to hold that if a practice\nof misconduct is sufficiently widespread, the municipality may be assumed to have\nacquiesced in it, even in the absence of direct evidence of such acquiescence.\n33 Connick, 131 S.Ct. at 1359 (citing Oklahoma City v.

The Fourth Amendment, Stops, and Reasonable Suspicion\nThe Fourth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the\nFourteenth Amendment,36 states:  “The right of the people to be secure in their\npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\nshall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause . . . .”37 \nAs interpreted by the courts, the Fourth Amendment prohibits arrest without\nprobable cause, but allows the police to “‘stop and briefly detain a person for\ninvestigative purposes if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by\nin Walker v.

Criminal Trespass under New York State Law\nCriminal trespass is defined under section 140 of the New York Penal\nLaw.  As the Appellate Division, First Department, of the Supreme Court of New\nYork recently stated in a case concerning alleged trespass in a Clean Halls\nbuilding:\nA person is guilty of criminal trespass in the second degree\nwhen,  in  pertinent  part,  he  “knowingly  enters  or  remains\nunlawfully in a dwelling” (Penal Law § 140.15[1]).  A person\n“enters or remains unlawfully” in or upon premises “when he is\nnot licensed or privileged to do so” (Penal Law § 140.00[5]).  “In\ngeneral,  a  person  is  ‘licensed  or  privileged’  to  enter  private\npremises  when  he  has  obtained  the  consent  of  the  owner  or\nanother whose relationship to the premises gives him authority to\nissue such consent” (People v. Graves, 76 N.Y.2d 16, 20 . . .\n[1990]).  The prosecution bears the burden of proving the absence\nof such license or privilege (People v. Brown, 25 N.Y.2d 374, 377\n. . . [1969]).53\nThe trespass law also states:\nA person who, regardless of his intent, enters or remains in or\nupon premises which are at the time open to the public does so\nwith license and privilege unless he defies a lawful order not to\nenter or remain, personally communicated to him by the owner of\nsuch premises or other authorized person. A license or privilege\nto enter or remain in a building which is only partly open to the\npublic is not a license or privilege to enter or remain in that part\n52 See Terry, 392 U.S. at 16–20.\n53 In re Lonique M., 939 N.Y.S.2d 341, 343 (1st Dep’t 2012).\n20\n\nof the building which is not open to the public.54\nD. De Bour\nIn People v. De Bour, the New York Court of Appeals established a\nfour-level test for determining the legality of encounters between police officers\nand civilians under New York state law.  The more intrusive the encounter, the\nmore justification required:\n• Level 1:  Approach to Request Information:  “If a police officer\nseeks  simply  to  request  information  from  an  individual,  that\nrequest must be supported by an objective, credible reason, not\nnecessarily indicative of criminality.”55  \n• Level 2:  The Common-Law Right of Inquiry:  “Once the officer\nasks  more  pointed  questions  that  would  lead  the  person\napproached reasonably to believe that he or she is suspected of\nsome wrongdoing and is the focus of the officer’s investigation,\nthe officer is [engaged in] a common-law inquiry that must be\nsupported by a founded suspicion that criminality is afoot.”56 \n• Level 3:  Forcible Stop:  “Where a police officer has reasonable\nsuspicion that a particular person was involved in a felony or\nmisdemeanor, the officer is authorized to forcibly stop and detain\nthat person.”57  A Level 3 stop is legally equivalent to a Terry\n54 N.Y. Penal Law § 140.00.\n55 People v. Hollman, 79 N.Y.2d 181, 184 (1992) (reaffirming De Bour\ndespite case law suggesting that the Fourth Amendment does not protect against\npolice-initiated encounters falling short of seizures).\n56 Id. at 184–85 (emphasis added).\n57 Id. at 185 (emphasis added).  \n21\n\nstop, and New York state court opinions generally refer to Level\n3 De Bour stops and Terry stops interchangeably.58 \n• Level 4:  Arrest:  “Finally, where the officer has probable cause to\nbelieve  that  a  person  has  committed  a  crime,  an  arrest  is\nauthorized.”59 \nAt least in the context of police encounters inside TAP and NYCHA\nbuildings, New York courts have often identified requests for name and purpose in\nthe building as Level 1 questions.60  Mere presence in a drug-prone NYCHA\nbuilding with a history of trespassing has been identified as an objective, credible\nreason justifying Level 1 questioning.61  Level 1 questioning of someone exiting a\n58 See, e.g., People v.

Hendricks, 841 N.Y.S.2d 94, 94 (1st Dep’t 2007)\n(holding that NYCHA building’s “history of drug activity and trespassing”\nprovided “objective, credible reason” for Level 1 inquiry “to determine if\ndefendant was legitimately in the building”); People v. Anderson, 759 N.Y.S.2d\n676, 676 (1st Dep’t 2003) (holding that group of nine or ten people descending\nstaircase in drug-prone TAP building provided objective credible reason to ask\ndefendant whether he lived there, “‘which constituted a level one request for\ninformation and not a common-law inquiry’” (quoting People v. Tinort, 709\nN.Y.S.2d 511, 511 (1st Dep’t 2000))). \n61 See Hendricks, 841 N.Y.S.2d at 94.  Level 1 questioning of a person\nin a NYCHA building requires “[a]t a minimum, . . . evidence of prior criminality”\nin the building.  People v. Ventura, 913 N.Y.S.2d 543, 546–47 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Co.\n2010).  “To the extent that . . . in public housing the police routinely engage in\nrandom, unjustified questioning — and there is evidence that they do — the\npractice would amount to a systematic violation of De Bour.”  Id. at 547 (citing\n22\n\nTAP building, on the other hand, appears to require more than a history of drug\nactivity in the building.62\nIV. FINDINGS OF FACT\nA. Evidence of an Unconstitutional Practice or Custom of the NYPD\nAt the hearing, plaintiffs offered three categories of evidence in\nsupport of their contention that the NYPD has a practice of making\nunconstitutional trespass stops outside Clean Halls buildings in the Bronx.  First,\nplaintiffs offered the testimony of ADA Rucker regarding her concerns about\ntrespass stops and arrests at Clean Halls buildings, corroborated by “decline to\nprosecute” forms from the Bronx District Attorney’s office.  Second, plaintiffs\noffered testimony regarding their personal experiences of having been stopped\noutside Clean Halls buildings.63  Third, plaintiffs offered the expert testimony of\nAdam Carlis, The Illegality of Vertical Patrols, 109 COLUM. L. REV. 2002 (2009)). \n62 See, e.g., People v. Kojac, 671 N.Y.S.2d 949, 953–54 (Sup. Ct. N.Y.\nCo. 1998) (“The police are not justified in approaching an individual merely\nbecause he exits [a TAP building] known for its high incidence of drug activity.”). \nSee also People v.

See infra Part\nIV.A.2.  All of the stops were of named plaintiffs except the July 2011 stop of non-\nparty witness Jerome Grant, a relative of two named plaintiffs.  See infra Part\nIV.A.2.d.  For convenience, when making general statements about the personal\n23\n\nDr. Jeffrey Fagan regarding the number and nature of trespass stops outside Clean\nHalls buildings.\nI address each of these categories of evidence in turn.\n1. Findings of Fact Regarding Testimony of ADA Rucker and\nDecline to Prosecute Forms\nSince 2007, ADA Rucker has been chief of the complaint and\narraignments bureau at the Bronx DA.  In this position, she oversees the arrest to\narraignment process, ensuring “that we evaluate all cases that are coming through\nand making sure we are doing the right thing.”  ADA Rucker testified that around\n2007 she started to become concerned about cases in which people were being\nstopped and then arrested based solely on their having entered or exited a Clean\nHalls building.  Especially in 2009, judges began dismissing these cases\nfrequently, sometimes saying that the police had no right to approach the arrested\nperson in the first place.64  \nADA Rucker also started to receive a steady stream of complaints\nabout trespass arrests from the defense bar, the Legal Aid Society, and the Bronx\ntestimony of stops offered at the hearing, I will often refer to named plaintiffs and\nnon-party witness Jerome Grant collectively as “plaintiffs.”\n64 See Tr. 10/15 at 168–75.\n24\n\nDefenders.65  At first, she ignored the complaints.  But in 2010, her staff began\ntelling her that judges were not only dismissing trespass cases, but were finding\nevidence that the defendant lived in the building where the trespass was said to\nhave occurred.66  \nFinally, in 2011, ADA Rucker investigated the law governing trespass\nstops based on entry to and exit from a Clean Halls building, and she determined\nthat the office’s position on the prerequisites for a legal stop had been wrong.67 \nShe sent memos to a number of commanders and other police officials clarifying\nthat, contrary to previous statements, observing someone exiting a Clean Halls\nbuilding is not by itself a sufficient justification for a stop.68  ADA Rucker testified\nthat she sent the memos in her official capacity, and that the memos expressed the\nviews of the Bronx DA’s office.69 \n65 See id. at 175:20–22.  The Bronx Defenders are co-counsel for\nplaintiffs in this case.\n66 See id. at 175:21–25, 176:2–8.\n67 See id. at 176:9–23.\n68 See id. at 176:14–177:22, 180:19–181:21; 7/7/11 Letter from ADA\nRucker to Deputy Inspector William McSorley (“7/7/11 Rucker Letter”), Plaintiffs’\nExhibit (“Pl. Ex.”) 6.  See also Tr. 10/15 at 184:7–185:17; 7/13/11 Memo from\nADA Rucker to ADAs, Pl. Ex. 7 at 2 (explaining that Bronx DA would decline to\nprosecute trespass cases where stop was based on nothing more than entry and exit\nfrom Clean Halls building).\n69 See Tr. 10/15 at 182:11–183:8.\n25\n\nI find ADA Rucker’s testimony credible.  It is no small matter when\nan ADA publicly suggests that the NYPD has been engaged in a recurring pattern\nof unlawful stops.  Such testimony is entitled to significant weight.  A prosecutor\nhas professional and institutional incentives to be skeptical of allegations that the\npolice are making stops and arrests without a legal basis.   That ADA Rucker\novercame her skepticism says a great deal about the severity of the problem she\ncame to recognize.  I also note that the NYPD itself found ADA Rucker\nsufficiently trustworthy to allow her to train police officers regarding procedures in\nthe complaint room.70\nYet defendants argue that ADA Rucker’s impression that a problem\nexisted regarding unlawful trespass stops at Clean Halls buildings was unfounded,\nand in fact rested only on the two specific cases she discussed in detail at the\nhearing.71  Defendants’ argument is without merit.  ADA Rucker made clear that\n70 See id. at 170:12–173:17.  Throughout this opinion, for convenience, I\nwill refer to NYPD trainees as “officers,” though in some cases the training\ninvolves “recruits.”  See Tr. 10/19 at 839:18–24.\n71 See Defendants’ Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n(“Def. Findings”) ¶¶ 11–14.  One case involved an anonymous letter whose author\nclaimed to have been arrested for trespass while leaving a friend’s building with\nthe friend.  See Tr. 10/15 at 190:17–20; Tr. 10/16 at 239:1–240:22; 3/13/12\nAnonymous Letter to ADA Rucker, Pl. Ex. 11.  The other involved a stop inside a\nClean Halls building, and was brought to ADA Rucker’s attention by the Bronx\nDefenders.  See Tr. 10/15 at 196:13–198:15; Tr. 10/16 at 241:5–243:2.  In the latter\ncase, according to ADA David Grigoryan, who performed an investigation at ADA\n26\n\nover the years she learned of “many” cases involving unlawful trespass stops at\nClean Halls buildings,72 that “the judges kept dismissing” them,73 that “[a]t least\nfive” judges had dismissed Clean Halls trespass cases based on lack of probable\ncause,74 and that her concerns were also based on complaints from other ADAs,\nphone calls from the arraignment parts, and ADAs coming to her after leaving\ncourt, or when sent to her by their supervisors.75  ADA Rucker explicitly stated on\ncross-examination that her concerns were not based only on the anonymous letter\nRucker’s request, the defendant was stopped and questioned for no specified\nreason at his sister’s building, where he was apparently staying, and then the\ndefendant was arrested because he failed to provide his sister’s name or apartment\nnumber.  See Tr. 10/18 at 609:7–614:19, 617:25–619:9.  ADA Grigoryan testified\nthat in his opinion this arrest was “absolutely valid.”  Id. at 611:14.\n72 Tr. 10/15 at 176:7–8.\n73 Id. at 176:10–11.\n74 Tr. 10/16 at 234:9.\n75 See id. at 237:13–238:8, 239:11–24, 240:6–7, 243:13–18, 244:6–12. \nFurther support for ADA Rucker’s criticisms can be found in the opinions of New\nYork state courts.  See, e.g., Almonte, 2011 WL 864940, at *1 (criticizing police\nofficer who was apparently “operating under the assumption that he had the\nauthority to identify anyone leaving a trespass affidavit building”).  Other cases\ndescribe problems with stops and arrests inside TAP buildings.  See, e.g., People v.\nRuiz, No. 056832C-2006, 2007 WL 1428689, at *3–4 (Sup. Ct. Bronx Co. May 15,\n2007) (chastising NYPD after apparently unlawful trespass arrest inside Clean\nHalls building, and concluding:  “One hopes the New York City Police Department\nwill better train its officers in the realm of Criminal Trespass so that only true\ntrespassers will be arrested, and innocents will be spared.”).\n27\n\nand the indoor stop highlighted by defendants.76\nTo the extent that ADA Rucker’s concerns were based partly on\nstatements made by non-parties who did not testify at the hearing and whose\nstatements do not fall under any hearsay exception, I give no weight to the truth of\nthose statements.  I do not accept, however, the insinuation that ADA Rucker\ninvented the problem of unlawful Clean Halls trespass stops in order to lessen the\nBronx DA’s caseload,77 or that she imagined the dismissed trespass cases under\npressure from the Bronx Defenders.78  ADA Rucker’s concerns are independently\ncorroborated by numerous “decline to prosecute” affidavit forms.  As ADA Rucker\nexplained, the Bronx DA’s office produces these affidavits after a police officer or\nwitness is interviewed and the office declines to prosecute the case.79  \nThe decline to prosecute forms are an important source of information\nand I have reviewed each of them.  Plaintiffs entered into evidence twenty-six\n76 See Tr. 10/16 at 237:13–16.

Findings ¶ 16 n.1; Tr. 10/16 at 210:17–220:25; Tr. 10/17 at\n508:11–509:20; Bronx DA Decline to Prosecute Affidavits (“Decline Prosecute\nAffs.”), Pl. Ex. 74.  Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 74 contains thirty-one forms, but plaintiffs\nlater conceded that only twenty-eight forms expressly identify the building outside\nof which the stop took place as a TAP building.  See Pl. Findings ¶ 16 n.2\n(referring to Decline Prosecute Affs. at 4425, 5001, 5055).  In addition, two of the\nforms are revisions of other forms.  Compare Decline Prosecute Affs. at 2996,\n3088, with id. at 3174, 3086.\n81 ADA Rucker confirmed that the types of cases described in the\ndecline to prosecute forms were, in part, what motivated the Bronx DA’s office to\nadopt a policy in July 2011 of declining to prosecute cases where the arresting\nofficer had only observed someone exiting or entering and exiting a Clean Halls\nbuilding.

They did not.83  I decline to\ndraw inferences in defendants’ favor based on the speculative possibility that\nfurther testimony would have revealed persuasive legal justifications for the stops\ndescribed in the forms.\nIn an Appendix to this Opinion, I have collected excerpts from the\ntwenty-six narratives of stops and arrests that appear in the decline to prosecute\nforms.84  One of the shorter and less redacted narratives reads:  \nOn  January  5,  2011  the  defendants  were  observed  exiting  a\n[C]lean [H]alls building.  The defendants stated they were there\nto visit a tenant in the building.  After being arrested[,] a tenant\nfrom the building did corroborate the defendant[s’] statements and\nthe tenant stated that both defendants were in the building as his\nguests.\nTherefore, the People are declining to prosecute this case at this\ntime [redacted].85\nBased solely on a review of these forms, none of the stops leading to the arrests\ndescribed in the forms were based on a reasonable suspicion of trespass.  All were\n82 Def. Findings ¶ 13. \n83 Neither party attempted to determine whether the stops described in\nthe decline to prosecute forms were recorded in UF-250s.\n84 See infra Appendix A (“App. A”).\n85 Decline Prosecute Affs. at 4407, excerpted at App. A ¶ 2.\n30\n\nbased merely on exit or entry and exit from a Clean Halls building.86  Thus, over\nthe course of three months in 2011, there were at least twenty-six arrests for\ntrespass outside Clean Halls buildings in the Bronx that resulted from stops lacking\nreasonable suspicion.  As will be discussed in greater detail below, these arrests\nindependently suggest a widespread practice of unlawful stops.87\nIn sum, ADA Rucker’s testimony and the supporting exhibits,\nincluding the decline to prosecute forms, contained more than enough evidence to\nsupport the conclusion that there is a clear and substantial likelihood that plaintiffs\nwill be able to prove at trial that NYPD officers in the Bronx repeatedly stopped\nand questioned people on suspicion of trespass simply because they were observed\nexiting or entering and exiting a Clean Halls building.  ADA Rucker’s testimony\nand the supporting exhibits show that a nexus existed between the Clean Halls\nprogram and the kinds of unlawful trespass stops described by plaintiffs and\nquantified by Dr. Fagan, as discussed in the sections below.  That is, the stops of\npeople exiting or entering and exiting Clean Halls buildings took place because the\nbuildings were enrolled in Operation Clean Halls.\n86 Some of the forms describe stops in which an officer eventually\nobtained probable cause for an arrest.  See, e.g., App. A ¶ 23.  But the instant case\nconcerns the legal basis for stops, not arrests.\n87 See infra Part V.B.1.a.\n31\n\n2. Findings of Fact Regarding Plaintiffs’ Stops\nPlaintiffs offered testimony at the preliminary injunction hearing\nregarding their experiences in having been stopped on suspicion of trespass outside\nClean Halls buildings in the Bronx.  Sometimes plaintiffs’ accounts were\ncorroborated by other plaintiffs and witnesses.  In a few cases, the parties were able\nto identify officers who took part in the stops, and these officers testified.  In other\ncases, neither plaintiffs nor defendants were able to identify the officers.\nDefendants argue that plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient\ninformation to identify the John Doe officers in the case, and that as a result this\nCourt should not credit plaintiffs’ testimony.88  Defendants go so far as to suggest\nthat the stops about which plaintiffs testified “may not have occurred at all.”89 \nBased on the testimony described below, I reject this contention.  Perhaps the\nstrongest sign of the credibility of plaintiffs’ testimony is the striking similarities\namong plaintiffs’ stops.  A person approaches or exits a Clean Halls building in the\nBronx; the police suddenly materialize, stop the person, demand identification, and\nquestion the person about where he or she is coming from and what he or she is\ndoing; attempts at explanation are met with hostility; especially if the person is a\n88 See Tr. 11/7 at 1298:19–22 (defendants’ summation).\n89 Def. Findings ¶ 15.\n32\n\nyoung black man, he is frisked, which often involves an invasive search of his\npockets; in some cases the officers then detain the person in a police van in order to\ncarry out an extended interrogation about the person’s knowledge of drugs and\nweapons; and in some cases the stop escalates into an arrest for trespass, with all of\nthe indignities, inconveniences, and serious risks that follow from an arrest even\nwhen the charges are quickly dropped.\nNevertheless, while I found plaintiffs’ testimony credible, it would\nobviously have been valuable to hear from the unnamed officers involved in\nplaintiffs’ stops.  The officers were never identified.  I find that this was due in part\nto the lack of specificity in some of plaintiffs’ memories of their encounters.  At\nthe same time, I also find that defendants made inadequate efforts to identify\nofficers based on the information plaintiffs did provide.\nDefendants claim that Sgt. Robert Musick of the NYPD’s Special\nLitigation Support Unit “conducted an exhaustive search to determine the officers\ninvolved in the purported incidents presented by plaintiffs at the hearing.”90  Sgt.\nMusick’s reference to his “limited attempts” to identify the officers is closer to the\nmark.91  A large part of Sgt. Musick’s investigation involved searches of the\n90 Id. (emphasis added).

Musick conceded that he is “definitely not an\nexpert” at using the database.93  For example, he was only able to narrow down the\npotential list of officers who might have stopped Jerome Grant in the summer of\n2011 (discussed below) to a list of three hundred.  Yet this list included officers of\nall ethnicities, while Grant had testified that one of the two officers was Asian.  On\ncross-examination, Sgt. Musick explained that he had not searched for Asian\nofficers within the list of three hundred because Grant’s description of the other\nofficer did not specify an ethnicity.94  This makes no more sense than refusing to\nsearch a drawer for a pair of striped socks because one cannot remember which\ncolor shoes they match:  there was no reason to make the search for the Asian\nofficer contingent on obtaining more information about his partner.  In the end,\n92 See Chart by Sgt. Musick (“Musick Chart”), Defendants’ Exhibit\n(“Def. Ex.”) UU; Tr. 10/23 at 1123:23–1128:11.  Officers are required to complete\na UF-250 form, also known as a “Stop, Question and Frisk Report Worksheet,”\nafter each stop.

Musick was unable to locate a single UF-250 for any of the eleven stops to\nwhich plaintiffs testified.95 \nBecause I find it extremely implausible that any plaintiff simply\ninvented the stop or stops to which he or she testified, because defendants failed to\nmake a sufficiently persuasive effort to identify the officers involved, and because\nthe officers who did testify failed to undermine any plaintiff’s credibility, I decline\nto draw speculative inferences in defendants’ favor regarding the reasons that\nunidentified officers might have provided for their stops.\na. Charles Bradley’s Stop\nOn May 3, 2011, after finishing his work for the day as a security\nguard, Charles Bradley, a black fifty-one year old resident of the Bronx, took the\nsubway to visit his fiancée, Lisa Michelle Rappa, as they had arranged the evening\nbefore.96  Rappa lived in the Bronx at 1527 Taylor Avenue.97  Bradley formerly\nlived with Rappa and had keys to her apartment, but following a disagreement\nBradley had returned his keys.98  1527 Taylor Avenue is a Clean Halls building.99\n95 See id. at 1125–1143. \n96 See Tr. 10/16 at 257:17–258:22, 259:10–19, 261:1–24, 272:6.\n97 See id. at 258:23–24, 259:23.\n98 See Tr. 10/15 at 258:23–260:21.\n99 See Tr. 10/16 at 260:3–7.\n35\n\nWhen Bradley arrived at Rappa’s apartment building, a young man\nwho lived on the first floor and knew of Bradley’s and Rappa’s relationship let\nBradley into the building.  Bradley then walked up the stairs to Rappa’s apartment\non the fifth floor and knocked.  Because Rappa is deaf in one ear, Bradley waited a\nminute or two.  When there was still no response, he returned downstairs and left\nthe building.  Outside, he looked up toward Rappa’s window.100\nWhile Bradley was standing on the sidewalk, an unmarked green\npolice van approached and an officer in the passenger seat — later identified as\nOfficer Miguel Santiago — gestured for Bradley to come over.101  After Bradley\napproached the van, the officer got out and asked, “What are you doing here?”102 \nBradley explained he was there to see Rappa, and that he worked as a security\nguard.  Bradley testified that the officer responded to his attempts to explain his\npresence by suggesting Bradley was acting “like a fucking animal,”103 searched\nBradley’s pockets,104 then told Bradley to place his hands behind his back.

The Supreme Court held in Terry:\n36\n\nBradley was handcuffed, the officer placed him in the van, where there were two\nother officers.  While the van drove away, the officers began to question Bradley: \n“When was the last time you saw a gun? When was the last time you got high?\nWhen was the last time you bought some drugs?”105\nAfter twenty or thirty minutes in the van, the officers stopped at the\nstation house.  Bradley was taken into a room, stripped, and told to wait.106  He was\nsearched in “inappropriate areas.”107  For the next two hours, he waited in a cell\nwith other people who had been arrested.  He was then fingerprinted and given a\n[W]here a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads\nhim reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal\nactivity  may  be  afoot  and  that  the  persons  with  whom  he  is\ndealing may be armed and presently dangerous; . . . he is entitled\nfor the protection of himself and others in the area to conduct a\ncarefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an\nattempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him.\nTerry, 392 U.S. at 30 (emphasis added).  If the officer who searched Bradley had\nno reason to conclude that Bradley posed a danger, the officer’s frisk violated\nBradley’s rights under the Fourth Amendment.  See also People v.

Officer\nSantiago’s credibility was further called into question by the fact that in 2002 or\n2003 he lied within the scope of his police work by creating two improper\nsummonses to help a friend.122  Finally, Officer Santiago failed to complete the UF-\n250 form he was required to fill out for Bradley’s stop.123 \n119 See Tr. 10/23 at 1098:11–1099:1.\n120 Officer Santiago admitted that by the time he completed the\npaperwork, he had worked fourteen or fifteen hours straight and was “a little tired.” \nId. at 1099:11–12.

Officer Santiago testified that he\nwas trying to help a landlord friend who was having problems with a tenant, “so I\nissued two improper summons, one in the bus stop and one in the fire hydrant, and\nthe car was never there.” Id. at 1099:24–1100:2.\n123 See id. at 1110:9–11.\n40\n\nI find Bradley’s account credible.  Bradley entered a Clean Halls\nbuilding based on an invitation from a tenant, walked upstairs to the tenant’s\nresidence, found the tenant not home, then returned outside and waited on the\nsidewalk while considering what to do.  In response to Officer Santiago’s\nquestions, Bradley offered reasonable and unsuspicious answers.  Bradley’s\nconduct provided no further basis for a stop.\nb. Abdullah Turner’s Stops\nOn the evening of March 26, 2011, Abdullah Turner, a black twenty-\nfour year old, had plans to go to an engagement party in the Bronx with his close\nfriend Anginette Trinidad.124  Both Turner and Trinidad testified at the hearing that\nTrinidad was carrying a sweater in a plastic bag.125  When the two had nearly\narrived at the party, Trinidad told Turner she had to return the sweater to someone\nin the next building, 2020 Davidson Avenue, which is a Clean Halls building.126 \nWhile Trinidad went inside, Turner remained outside and called\nanother close friend, Felisha Black, on his cell phone.  During the call, he paced in\n124 See Tr. 10/17 at 472:14–15, 473:9–474:9.\n125 See id. at 475:8–15; Tr. 10/18 at 622:25–623:4.\n126 See Tr. 10/17 at 474:13–475:7, 481:23–25.\n41\n\na circle on the sidewalk, trying to stay warm.127  It was “freezing cold” that night,\nbut Turner was wearing only a cardigan sweater and t-shirt with no coat or hat.128\nAfter Turner had been pacing and talking on the phone for about five\nminutes, someone “snatched the phone out of my hand.”129  When Turner turned,\nhe saw three police officers:  one who was Hispanic and a little stocky; one who\nwas Indian, tall and slim; and a third officer that Turner did not “get a good look\nat.”130  One of the officers, Kieron Ramdeen, testified that he was only with one\nother officer, Michael Pomerantz.131  Officer Ramdeen’s testimony on this point\n127 See id. at 475:21–476:25.\n128 Id. at 495:5–18 (Turner’s testimony).  Defendants suggest that it is\nimplausible that Turner did not go inside the building, because he knew that the\ndoor was unlocked.  See Def. Findings ¶ 23 & n.11; Tr. 10/17 at 476:7–10.  But\nTurner testified that he liked the cold and did not need a coat.  See Tr. 10/17 at\n477:2–4.  Accord id. at 487:20–21, 502:5–19.  While Turner’s winter-weather\nclothing choices and apparent tolerance for the cold may be idiosyncratic, they do\nnot undermine his credibility.  There is also a facial inconsistency in defendants’\napparent attempt to suggest both that any reasonable person in Turner’s\ncircumstances would have entered the building to warm up, and that if Turner did\nso, he would have provided legal grounds for a Terry stop.  A reasonable person\nwould presumably want to avoid being stopped and frisked, and thus would prefer\nstanding in the cold to going inside, if doing so would create a reasonable\nsuspicion of criminal trespass.\n129 Tr. 10/17 at 477:8.  I note that a reasonable person would not feel free\nto leave when his personal property has been seized by the police.\n130 Id. at 477:19–23.\n131 See Tr. 10/22 at 1008:20, 1012:5–25.\n42\n\nwas not credible, as Officer Pomerantz’s own memobook stated that he was\npatrolling on the night of March 26 with Officer Ramdeen and Premativo\nMontanez, a Hispanic officer.132 \nTurner testified that the Hispanic officer who took his phone began\nquestioning him about what he was doing and whether he lived at 2020 Davidson. \nTurner explained that his friend was returning a sweater and they were on their\nway to a party in the next building.  The officer asked for identification, and Turner\ngave him his driver’s license.  After the officer saw that Turner did not live on the\nblock, he asked again what Turner was doing at 2020 Davidson, and Turner\nexplained again.133  Then the officer asked:  “So you don’t know anybody who\nlives in this building?”134  When Turner said no, the officer asked him to stand\nagainst the wall.135\nWhile Turner stood against the wall, the Hispanic officer entered 2020\nDavidson with Turner’s driver’s license and cell phone still in his possession. \nOfficer Ramdeen, now alone with Turner, continued asking Turner the same\n132 See id. at 1059:11–1061:6; Page from Memobook of Officer Michael\nPomerantz, Def.

Eventually, Trinidad emerged from the building, no longer\ncarrying the plastic bag, and Turner pointed to her as proof of what he had been\nsaying.  Trinidad confirmed Turner’s story while the other officers returned.  The\nHispanic officer asked for Trinidad’s ID, and Trinidad gave it to him.136  Then the\nofficer asked her if she had “anything on her that she shouldn’t have,” and in\nresponse, Trinidad said she had “a little pocketknife that her husband gave her for\nprotection and a bag of marijuana.”137 \nAfter confiscating these items, the Hispanic officer approached Turner\nand pointed to a sign on 2020 Davidson and asked him if he knew what the sign\nmeant.  Turner said he did not.  The sign stated that 2020 Davidson was enrolled in\nOperation Clean Halls.  The officer told Turner that he was trespassing and was\ngoing to jail.  Turner asked how he could be trespassing if he was outside.  The\nofficer repeated that Turner was going to jail and placed him in handcuffs.138\nAfter being driven to the precinct in a paddy wagon, Turner spent\nseveral hours waiting, was fingerprinted, and then was transferred to central\nbooking, where he spent several more hours.  It was not until the next day that a\n136 See id. at 479:13–24, 480:12–24.\n137 Id. at 481:1–3.\n138 See id. at 481:7–25, 482:1–8.\n44\n\njudge released Turner.  He was then obligated to return to court eight to ten times\nbefore the charges were dismissed.139  Turner testified that the events on March 26\nmade him feel “defenseless.”140  Trinidad’s testimony at the hearing supported\nTurner’s account of the stop.141  \nOfficer Ramdeen testified to a different version of events.  He testified\nthat he and Officer Pomerantz were driving past 2020 Davidson when he saw\nTurner in the lobby.  Officer Pomerantz stopped the car and Officer Ramdeen\nwatched as Turner paced aimlessly in the lobby for two to three minutes,\noccasionally looking up the stairs.  Aware that 2020 Davidson was a Clean Halls\nbuilding, Officer Ramdeen approached Turner, who then exited the lobby.  In\nresponse to Officer Ramdeen’s brief questioning, Turner volunteered that his\n139 See id. at 482:21–483:10, 483:14–21.\n140 Id. at 486:1.  Turner continued:\nIt’s like when you’re a kid, when someone is bothering you or\nsomeone is like threatening you, you run to your parents for\nprotection, and when you’re an adult, you’re supposed to run to\nthe police.  But who are you supposed to run to when like the\npolice are harassing you or like threatening you . . ., who are you\nsupposed to run to then?\nId. at 486:3–8.\n141 See Tr. 10/18 at 619:23–628:6.\n45\n\nfriend was engaged in a drug deal.142  “I asked him what he was doing in the\nbuilding and, in sum and substance, he responded with, I am not going to lie,\nOfficer, I just came with my friend.  She went upstairs to buy weed.”143  Officer\nRamdeen did not record this alleged confession in his arrest report.144\nOfficer Ramdeen then arrested Turner for trespassing, basing “the\ncharges on the fact that he had no lawful reason to be in the building and that he\nknowingly was there to buy marijuana.”145  Officer Ramdeen could not recall\nhaving arrested Trinidad.  He conceded that neither he nor Officer Pomerantz took\nany steps to investigate or arrest the drug dealer who, according to their version of\nevents, was operating that night a few stories above them at 2020 Davidson.146\n142 See Tr. 10/22 at 1016:17–1017:14, 1020:11–1021:25.\n143 Id. at 1021:21–24.\n144 Officer Ramdeen’s arrest report only states that Turner was inside a\nClean Halls building without permission or authority to be there.  See id. at\n1038:19–1041:24; 3/26/11 Arrest Report of Plaintiff Abdullah Turner (“Turner\nArrest Report”), Def. Ex. ZZ.  The confession does appear in Officer Ramdeen’s\nsupporting deposition, signed on the following day.  See 3/27/11 Officer Ramdeen\nSupporting Deposition in State v. Turner, Def. Ex. CCC.  Like Officer Santiago\nafter Bradley’s stop, Officer Ramdeen also failed to complete the required UF-250\nform for his stop of Turner.  See Tr. 10/22 at 1024:2–7.  In fact, Officer Ramdeen\nmarked “NO” next to the field “Stop And Frisk” on Turner’s arrest report.  See\nTurner Arrest Report at 1.\n145 Tr. 10/22 at 1022:20–22.  See also id. at 1025:14–1026:4.\n146 See id. at 1026:21–22, 1064:13–1065:12.\n46\n\nI find Turner’s testimony to be credible.  Turner stopped briefly at\n2020 Davidson so that Trinidad could allegedly return a sweater.  While Trinidad\nwent inside, Turner talked on his cell phone outside for a few minutes.  Officers\nRamdeen, Pomerantz, and likely Montanez saw him standing outside the building\nin the cold, stopped him, and questioned him.  Turner’s responses to the officers’\nquestions were reasonable and unsuspicious.  Turner provided no other grounds for\nsuspicion.  I did not find credible Officer Ramdeen’s testimony concerning\nTurner’s spontaneous confession.  Turner persuasively denied that he made the\nconfession,147 and the officers took no steps to investigate or stop the drug dealer\nwho (according to Officer Ramdeen’s testimony) was operating several floors\nabove them.   I also did not find credible Officer Ramdeen’s testimony concerning\nhis observation of Turner’s suspicious pacing inside the building before the\nofficers approached.  Based on the totality of the evidence presented at the hearing,\nI do not believe that Turner entered the building.148\n147 See Tr. 10/17 at 500:12–23.\n148 I note, however, that even if Turner entered the building, paced in the\nlobby, looked up the stairs, and then exited the building to make his call, a stop\nwould still have been unjustified.  This behavior is innocuous and would not,\nwithout something more, provide reasonable suspicion of criminal trespass, or of\nany other crime.  As in Bradley’s and Roshea Johnson’s cases, entering and exiting\na Clean Halls building under ordinary circumstances does not establish reasonable\nsuspicion.  See infra Part V.B.1.a.\n47\n\nFinally, Turner credibly testified to having been stopped on another\nnight during December 2011 or January 2012 outside of his own building, 2249\nMorris Avenue, which is also a Clean Halls building in the Bronx.  As Turner was\nexiting the building, a police car pulled up.  Turner’s thirteen-year-old brother, a\nfriend, and the friend’s nephew were talking at the front of the courtyard.  When\nTurner began to step out of the courtyard, a female officer got out of the car and\nasked whether they all lived in the building, and they all responded yes.  Then the\nofficer asked for Turner’s identification, and he gave it to her.149  Finally, the\nofficer “told us that we can’t stand in front of our building, so when they come\nback we would need to be gone.”150  Turner testified that he did not feel free to\nleave while the officer talked to him:  “[S]he had my ID, and I don’t know anyone\n. . . who ever just walked away from a cop in the middle of a conversation.”151  In\nthis encounter as well, I find that Turner’s behavior provided no grounds for\nsuspicion of trespass or any other crime.\nAs to whether Turner’s second stop was based on the suspicion of\n149 See Tr. 10/17 at 486:9–490:25.\n150 Id. at 491:4–5.\n151 Id. at 491:6–8, 22–23.\n48\n\ntrespass, the evidence is less clear.152  Nevertheless, because I found Turner’s\ntestimony credible, because the officer’s questions concerned the right of Turner\nand the others to be on Clean Halls property, because there is no indication that the\nofficers suspected Turner of any other crime, and because the parties were unable\nto locate a UF-250 or any other documentation showing otherwise, I find it more\nlikely than not that Turner’s second stop was based on the suspicion of trespass.\nc. J.G.’s Stop\nJ.G. is the son of plaintiff Jaenean Ligon and the brother of J.A.G. and\nJerome Grant.  The family lives in a Clean Halls building in the Bronx.153\nJ.G., who is black and seventeen years old, testified that the first time\nhe remembered being stopped around his apartment building was on an evening in\nAugust 2011.  He had gone to a nearby store to buy ketchup for dinner.  On his\nway back, he saw two plainclothes officers with badges in front of his building and\nthree uniformed officers across the street.  When J.G. reached his building, the\nofficers stopped him and began asking him questions, such as where he was\n152 Defendants’ post-hearing brief does not challenge whether Turner’s\nsecond stop was based on suspicion of trespass, but does challenge whether five of\nthe other unrecorded stops described by plaintiffs were for trespass.  See Def.\nFindings ¶¶ 17 (Kieron Johnson), 19 (Jerome Grant), 20 (both of Letitia Ledan’s\nstops), 21 (Roshea Johnson).  I address each of defendants’ challenges below.\n153 See Tr. 10/17 at 438:4–25.\n49\n\ncoming from, where he was headed, and what he had in his bag.  After J.G.\nanswered that he had ketchup in the bag, one of the officers asked him to raise his\nhands, then asked him what he had in his pockets.  The officer started to frisk him,\nfirst shaking J.G.’s pockets, then putting a hand in J.G.’s left pocket,154 then patting\nJ.G.’s arms down.  After the search, the officer asked for J.G.’s ID and took his\nname down on a notepad.  Then the other officer looked in J.G.’s bag and\ninspected the ketchup.  The officers asked for J.G.’s apartment number and rang\nthe bell.  Finally, after Ligon had come downstairs and confirmed that J.G. was her\nson, the officers handed her the ketchup and let them go.155\nLigon’s testimony supported J.G.’s account.  Ligon testified that she\nsent J.G. to the store for ketchup one evening when she was cooking chicken and\n154 As I noted above, plaintiffs have not focused on the issue of frisks in\nthe instant litigation.  Nevertheless, it is worth emphasizing that the officer’s\nplacement of his hand in J.G.’s pocket goes beyond “a carefully limited search of\nthe outer clothing . . . in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to\nassault him.”  Terry, 392 U.S. at 30.  If the officer had no reasonable basis for\nbelieving J.G.’s pocket contained a dangerous weapon that J.G. might use to harm\nthe officer, the officer’s search of J.G.’s pocket violated J.G.’s rights under the\nFourth Amendment.  See Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 373 (1993)\n(reaffirming that Terry frisk “must be strictly ‘limited to that which is necessary for\nthe discovery of weapons which might be used to harm the officer or others\nnearby’” (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 26)).  \n155 See Tr. 10/17 at 437:17, 439:4–443:2.\n50\n\nfrench fries.  A few minutes after he left, she heard her bell ring.156  Jerome Grant\nanswered the bell and an unfamiliar voice said:  “[C]an you please come down and\nidentify your son.”157  Hearing these words, Ligon thought J.G. was dead or hurt. \nShe ran downstairs and collapsed on the steps when she saw J.G. standing,\nuninjured, beside the officers.  The plainclothes officer who was standing with J.G.\napproached Ligon, laughing, and handed her the ketchup.158\nI find J.G.’s and Ligon’s testimony credible.  J.G. provided no\ngrounds for suspicion of trespass — or indeed of any other crime — as he\napproached his building.  He also provided no grounds for suspicion in his\nresponses to the officers’ questions.  J.G. provided no further basis for a stop,\nmuch less a frisk.  Because the officers did not ask J.G. whether he lived in the\nbuilding, it is unclear whether J.G.’s stop was based on the suspicion of trespass. \nNevertheless, because J.G. was only stopped as he approached a Clean Halls\nbuilding, because the officers’ questions indicate no suspicion of any other crime\nother than trespass, and because the parties have been unable to locate a UF-250\nindicating otherwise, it remains more likely than not that J.G. was stopped on\n156 See id. at 429:7–430:4.\n157 Id. at 430:4–14.\n158 See id. at 430:16–433:1.\n51\n\nsuspicion of trespass — if his stop was indeed based on a particularized suspicion\nof any crime at all.\nd. Jerome Grant’s Stop\nJerome Grant, J.G.’s older brother and Ligon’s son, testified that his\ngrandmother, Betty Ligon, lives at 274 Bonner Place in the Bronx.159  274 Bonner\nPlace is a Clean Halls building.160\nGrant, who is black and nineteen years old, testified that the first time\nthe police stopped him at his grandmother’s building was in July 2011.  He had\nbeen playing basketball with his little brother J.A.G., his cousin, and a friend.  In\nthe evening, the group needed to pick up a key from Grant’s grandmother’s house,\nso they began walking toward it and sent J.A.G. to run ahead.  J.A.G. went inside\nthe building without leaving the door open, so the others knocked loudly on the\ndoor.161  Grant’s cousin was “a little upset” by being locked out.162\nTwo uniformed male police officers, one white and one Asian,\napproached with flashlights and asked if Grant, his cousin, and his friend lived in\n159 See id. at 452:13–25.\n160 See Photo of 274 Bonner Place, Pl. Ex. 37.\n161 See Tr. 10/17 at 451:21, 453:6–19, 454:17–455:17, 464:19–466:5.\n162 Id. at 464:11.\n52\n\nthe building, and if they were trespassing.  Grant explained that they were visiting\ntheir grandmother’s apartment to get a key, and Grant’s cousin asked if they were\ndoing anything wrong.163  The Asian officer responded, “I’m the one that’s talking\nhere.”164  When Grant’s cousin said that he just wanted to know if there was a\nproblem, the Asian officer told him to “hush up” and there would not be any\nproblems.165  Then the officers made Grant, his cousin, and his friend stand with\ntheir backs against a wall and take out their IDs.166  When only Grant had an ID,\nthe Asian officer told Grant’s cousin and friend:  “I could take you in because you\ndon’t have ID.”167  The Asian officer then wrote down Grant’s cousin’s and\nfriend’s names and birthdates in a notepad while the white officer did the same for\nGrant.168\nThen the Asian officer returned Grant’s ID and told the group to turn\naround and place their hands against the wall.  The Asian officer asked Grant’s\n163 See id. at 455:19–20, 456:8–12.\n164 Id. at 456:13.\n165 Id. at 456:18–19.\n166 See id. at 456:21–457:5.\n167 Id. at 457:15.

Finally,\nthe Asian officer told the group to put their backs against the wall again, warned\nthem to carry their IDs with them, and explained that the officers had wanted to\nmake sure the group was not trespassing.  J.A.G. came outside shortly after the\nofficers left.  Grant testified that he did not feel free to leave until the officers told\nhim to go home.170\nI find Grant’s testimony largely credible, though it conflicted in\ncertain minor details with his deposition testimony.171  Defendants argue that the\nofficers approached based on the group knocking on the door, rather than on the\nsuspicion of trespass.172  But I accept Grant’s testimony that the John Doe\ndefendant Asian officer mentioned trespassing as the basis for the stop.173 \ne. Roshea Johnson’s Stop\n169 Again, as in the cases of Bradley and J.G., the officer’s conduct\nclearly exceeded the constitutional bounds of a frisk.\n170 See id. at 458:3–459:21, 461:4–24, 462:3–5.\n171 For example, Grant stated at the deposition that the Asian officer\nfrisked all three members of the group.  See id. at 467:8–9. \n172 See Def. Findings ¶ 19.\n173 See Tr. 10/17 at 461:4–19.\n54\n\nRoshea Johnson is the brother of plaintiff Letitia Ledan.174  From 2001\nthrough 2010, Johnson lived at River Park Towers, a complex of buildings in the\nBronx.  Sometimes he lived with Ledan, and at other times with a friend.  River\nPark Towers is enrolled in Operation Clean Halls.175\nOn the morning of Father’s Day 2010, Johnson, who is black and was\nthen thirty-four years old, went to Ledan’s apartment to change into clothes he had\nleft there.  To enter River Park Towers, it is not necessary to pass through security\nor a closed gate, or to have a key.  Johnson walked into Ledan’s building and took\nthe elevator to her floor.  When he knocked at Ledan’s door, there was no answer. \nHe went back to the elevator and returned to the ground floor, planning to call\nLedan on the payphone in front of a supermarket in the complex.176\nAs Johnson crossed the street to the payphone, a black van pulled up\nwith police officers inside.  One officer asked him where he was coming from.177 \n174 See Tr. 10/16 at 394:2–395:2.  Roshea Johnson is unrelated to plaintiff\nKieron Johnson.  See id. at 393:20–22.\n175 See id. at 298:11–19, 394:2–395:2.\n176 See id. at 394:3–399:7.\n177 See id. at 399:21–400:13.  Defendants have not located a UF-250\nconnected to Roshea Johnson’s stop, or identified the officers involved in the stop,\ndespite Roshea Johnson’s precise identification of the time and place of his stop\nand his detailed physical descriptions of the officers. See Musick Chart (incident\n11); Tr. 10/16 at 401:20-402:3.\n55\n\nJohnson told the officer he was coming from his sister’s house but she was not\nhome.178  Then the officer “mentioned something about trespassing.”179  Johnson\ntried to tell the officer that he could prove he was not trespassing, and that he had a\nletter in his pocket with his name and his sister’s address on it.  The officer\nresponded by handcuffing Johnson and placing him in the back of the van.180\nThe officers then drove the van to another part of the complex and\nquestioned Johnson.181  One of the officers asked Johnson “where was the drugs or\nthe guns at.”182  Johnson said he “didn’t know where the drugs or the gun was.”183 \nThe officers continued asking similar questions for a few minutes, then pulled out\nof the complex.184  During the drive, the officers “said you could make it easy on\nyourself if you tell us where the guns and the drug was, but I didn’t know where no\nguns or drugs was.”185  Finally, after about fifteen or twenty minutes, the officers\n178 See Tr. 10/16 at 400:14–15.\n179 Id. at 400:17.\n180 See id. at 400:17–401:18.\n181 See id. at 402:4–22.\n182 Id. at 402:19–20.\n183 Id. at 402:21–22.\n184 See id. at 402:23–403:8.\n185 Id. at 403:11–13.\n56\n\npulled over at a location about a mile from River Park Towers, opened the door,\nand told Johnson to get out of the van.186  “When I got out of the van, he said\nmaybe you don’t know nothing, and took the handcuffs off me and let me go.”187 \nLooking back, Johnson said that the encounter made him feel “angry and kind of\nhelpless.”188\nI find Johnson’s testimony credible.  Johnson provided no grounds for\nsuspicion of trespass as he entered and exited Ledan’s building.  He also provided\nno grounds for suspicion in his interactions with the officers.  Nor did Johnson’s\nconduct provide any other basis for a stop. \nf. Letitia Ledan’s Stops\nLetitia Ledan, Roshea Johnson’s sister, testified that she has lived at\nRiver Park Towers for the past eleven years.  She chairs the maintenance and\nelevator committee in the tenants’ association.  As noted above, River Park Towers\nis enrolled in Operation Clean Halls.189\nLedan, who is black, testified that she has been stopped six times in or\n186 See id. at 403:15–20, 403:25–404:3.\n187 Id. at 403:18–20.\n188 Tr. 10/17 at 417:21–23.\n189 See Tr. 10/16 at 297:2–298:19.\n57\n\naround her building.  Twice the stops occurred outdoors.  The first took place at\nsome time in 2009, although she could not provide a more precise date.  Two white\nmale officers stopped her in front of a supermarket in the River Park Towers\ncomplex as she was about to leave the complex.  They asked her whether she lived\nthere and whether she had an ID, then took her ID, looked at it, handed it back to\nher, and said to have a nice day.  During the roughly three-minute encounter, she\ndid not feel free to leave because the officers were standing in front of her and had\nher ID.190\nLedan’s second outdoor stop occurred in the summer of 2011.  Ledan\nwas returning home from work in the afternoon and saw four uniformed police\nofficers standing with her husband and two of her friends in front of her building. \nWhile one of the officers patted down one of Ledan’s friends, another was patting\ndown Ledan’s husband and removing items from his pockets.  As Ledan\napproached her building, she asked what was going on.191  Then an officer\napproached her, and she asked, “[W]hy are you stopping us?”192  The officer told\nher to be quiet and asked whether she lived at the building, then asked for her ID,\n190 See id. at 300:22–24, 301:1–14, 302:5–25, 317:18–25.\n191 See id. at 306:16–308:8.\n192 Id. at 308:8–10.\n58\n\nwhich she gave to him.193  After returning her ID and finishing the search of her\nhusband and friends, the officers “just started walking away.”194  As in 2009,\nLedan did not feel free to leave during the encounter because the officer blocked\nthe entrance to her building and had her ID.195\nI find Ledan’s testimony as to both encounters credible.  Plaintiffs\nhave failed to establish, however, that Ledan’s encounters constituted Terry stops. \nDespite Ledan’s subjective feeling that she was not free to leave in the first\nencounter, Ledan’s limited testimony tended to show that the officers approached\nand asked her questions politely and not in an aggressive, coercive, or threatening\nmanner.  “[E]ven when officers have no basis for suspecting a particular\nindividual, they may generally ask questions of that individual; [and] ask to\nexamine the individual’s identification . . . as long as the police do not convey a\nmessage that compliance with their requests is required.”196  Ledan’s testimony did\n193 See id. at 308:10–19.\n194 Id. at 308:19–309:4.\n195 See id. at 328:22–330:4.\n196 Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434–35 (collecting cases) (citations omitted). \nAccord Delgado, 466 U.S. at 216 (“[P]olice questioning, by itself, is unlikely to\nresult in a Fourth Amendment violation . . .

Without delving into the intricacies of\nFourth Amendment case law concerning consensual stops,197 the Supreme Court\nhas made clear that “[l]aw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth\nAmendment’s prohibition of unreasonable seizures merely by approaching\nindividuals on the street or in other public places and putting questions to them if\nthey are willing to listen.”198  Ledan testified that in her second encounter, she\napproached the police, initiated the encounter, and questioned the police before\nbeing questioned by them.  Based on this testimony, I find that Ledan’s second\nencounter was most likely consensual.\n197 Even when the Supreme Court has found consent for a search, it has\nheld that the “terminate the encounter” standard defines a Terry stop.  See, e.g.,\nDrayton, 536 U.S. at 200–01 (“The proper inquiry ‘is whether a reasonable person\nwould feel free to decline the officers’ requests or otherwise terminate the\nencounter.’” (quoting Bostick, 501 U.S. at 436)).

He lives in a Clean Halls building in the Bronx.  One day after\nwork in the winter of 2008, Moronta went with his brother, Eladio Vasquez, to his\nbrother’s apartment building at 1453 Walton Avenue in the Bronx, which is also a\nClean Halls building.199\nWhen Moronta left the building at around 10:30 p.m., a police van\npulled up and half a dozen uniformed officers exited and began questioning\nMoronta about where he was going and what he was doing in the building.  After\nMoronta explained that he had been at his brother’s apartment, one of the officers\nasked if he had anything sharp in his pockets and then patted him down and\nsearched his pockets.200  Then the officer asked if they could go upstairs to confirm\nMoronta’s story, and Moronta gave his permission.  A white officer asked for\nMoronta’s ID.201  On the way up in the elevator, a black officer told Moronta that\nhe “better be telling the truth,” because if Moronta’s brother did not live in the\n199 See id. at 340:24–341:4, 342:1–343:13, 343:14–344; Pl.

Moronta provided no grounds\nfor suspicion as he exited his brother’s building, or in his responses to the officers’\nquestions.  Moronta’s conduct provided no other basis for a stop.\nh.

Moronta’s initial inability to remember\nwhether the stop occurred in the winter of 2007 or of 2008 does not significantly\nundermine his credibility.  See id. at 350:12–24.  Defendants also note that\nplaintiffs’ Complaint alleges that Moronta’s stop occurred in 2010.  See Def.\nFindings ¶ 22 n.10; Compl. ¶ 129.  But Moronta testified that he had not looked at\nthe Complaint closely enough to notice the error until three days before his hearing\ntestimony, and that plaintiffs’ counsel may have confused the stop to which he\ntestified with an arrest for trespass in 2010.  See Tr. 10/16 at 350:22–352:18.\n62\n\nthe hearing.  He lives in a Clean Halls building in the Bronx and testified to having\nbeen stopped in or near Clean Halls buildings seven or eight times, and to having\nseen others stopped about ten times.  His best friend, plaintiff Jovan Jefferson,\nlives across the street at 1546 Selwyn Avenue, another Clean Halls building.206\nOn a warm day in 2010, around noon, Jefferson invited Johnson over\nto play basketball.  Johnson went to Jefferson’s building and waited outside, about\nsix steps away from the door.207  After about two minutes, two uniformed officers\n“pulled up in a car and . . . jumped out and ran out and around me.”208  One asked\nwhether Johnson had been in the building.  After he replied that he had not, one of\nthe officers asked for his ID while the other patted down his front pockets and\nreached into his back pockets, where he kept his wallet.209  The officer looked\nthrough his wallet, then the other officer returned his ID and told him he was free\nto go.  Until then, Johnson did not feel free to leave.210\n206 See Tr. 10/16 at 377:11–379:22.\n207 See id. at 380:1–381:11.\n208 Id. at 381:12–23.\n209 Yet again, as in the cases of Bradley, J.G., Grant, and Moronta, the\nofficer who searched Johnson violated Johnson’s Fourth Amendment rights by\nreaching into his pockets during a frisk without a reasonable basis in self-\nprotection.\n210 See id. at 382:6–383:5.  Johnson stated that after the incident, he felt\n“[e]mbarrassed and worried,” because “there’s usually people outside and I don’t\n63\n\nI find Johnson’s testimony credible, despite his inability to offer a\nmore precise date for the stop.  Defendants argue that Johnson’s stop was not for\ntrespass, because he testified that at the time of the stop, he believed the officers\nwere truancy officers.211  But defendants offer no persuasive evidence that the\nofficers were, in fact, truancy officers.212  Even if the officers were truancy officers, \ndefendants fail to show how this fact would undermine plaintiffs’ claim that\nJohnson was stopped on suspicion of trespass.213  Presumably truancy officers are\nno less able to make trespass stops than any other kind of officer.  Moreover,\nJohnson’s testimony that the officers asked him whether he had been inside the\nbuilding suggests a trespass stop.214  Based on Johnson’s testimony, I find that he\nprovided no grounds for suspicion of trespass as he waited outside Jefferson’s\nbuilding, in his responses to the officers’ questions, or in any other manner.\ni.  Jovan Jefferson’s Stop\nJovan Jefferson, who is black, was twenty years old at the time of the\nhearing.  As noted above, he lives in a Clean Halls building in the Bronx. \nlike when they see me being stopped by officers.”  See id. at 384:7–10.\n211 See id. at 385:4–13; Pl.

He and Muriel had been watching\nSportsCenter in Muriel’s apartment when Muriel left for work.  It was shortly after\nnoon as the two of them stepped out of Muriel’s building.216  A passing police van\nstopped and three officers got out, including two that Jefferson recognized as\nofficers named “Marquez” and “Rodriguez.”217  Jefferson testified that these\nofficers had previously stopped him inside his building, and had arrested Kieron\nJohnson for trespass inside Jefferson’s building at a time when Jefferson was with\nhim.  The officers had also arrested another friend of Jefferson’s for trespass.218  I\n215 See id. at 359:17–361:14.\n216 See id. at 361:15–362:16.\n217 Id. at 362:18–363:15; Compl. ¶ 83.  Officer Luis Rodriguez testified\nto being a truancy officer who patrolled Selwyn Avenue between April and June\n2012.  See Tr. 10/22 at 1067:1–18.  Rodriguez testified that he recognized\nJefferson but did not remember stopping him between April and June 2012.  See\nid. at 1068:8–1069:5.\n218 See Tr. 10/16 at 363:14–364:8.\n65\n\nfind it more likely than not that Rodriguez participated in the stop that Jefferson\ndescribed.\nRodriguez asked Jefferson and Muriel where they were coming from\nand why they were in the building.  The officers also asked Muriel for his ID. \nThen Jefferson’s mother drove by with his aunt.219  After his mother got out and\napproached the officers, Rodriguez stated that Jefferson was “free to go and that he\nwas just talking to me.”220  Jefferson testified that he did not feel free to leave\nbefore his mother approached.221\nI find Jefferson’s testimony largely credible, despite his failure during\nhis deposition to remember the stop to which he testified at the hearing.222  Given\nthe number of times Jefferson has apparently been stopped, it is understandable\nthat he might forget one and then remember it later, just as it would be\nunderstandable if a police officer were unable to remember a relatively brief,\nunrecorded stop.

Expert Testimony Regarding UF-250 Forms\nPlaintiffs’ expert witness, Dr. Jeffrey Fagan, is a criminologist with\nexpertise in statistics.223  Dr. Fagan performed a statistical analysis of data\ncontained on certain UF-250 forms completed by NYPD officers in the Bronx in\n2011.224  As noted above, officers are required to complete a UF-250 form after\neach stop.225  The front and back of the form contain various checkboxes and fields\nin which officers indicate the nature of the stop and the circumstances that led to\nthe stop.226\nDr. Fagan ultimately concluded that the NYPD recorded 1,663 stops\noutside a Clean Halls building in the Bronx in 2011 based only on a suspicion of\ntrespass, and without observing any indoor behavior.227  Of these stops, Dr. Fagan\n223 See Floyd v. City of New York, 861 F. Supp. 2d 274, 279–80\n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (describing Dr. Fagan’s qualifications).\n224 See Fagan Report at 2.  Dr. Fagan extracted the data from the City of\nNew York’s Stop, Question, and Frisk Database.  See id.\n225 See id. at 3; Tr. 10/15 at 69:24–70:1.

First, they argue that it is impossible to conclude whether reasonable\nsuspicion existed for a stop based on a UF-250 alone because “it is a conclusory\nform that does not capture all details, nuances and circumstances that may lead to a\nstop.”230  Defendants argue that Dr. Fagan had an obligation to incorporate into his\nbehavior was observed); Tr. 10/15 at 73:5–77:7 (general search method),\n114:23–115:2 (exclusion of alleged NYCHA stops), 117:20–119:20 (recapitulation\nof general search method); Table 14: Period of Observation of Proximity Stops,\nBronx Trespass Stops, 2011 (“Period of Observation Table”), Pl.

In Arvizu, the Supreme Court rejected the\nNinth Circuit’s attempt to clarify the reasonable suspicion standard by analyzing\nvarious stop factors in isolation as part of what the Supreme Court described as a\n“reasonable-suspicion calculus.”  534 U.S. at 272.  The Supreme Court emphasized\nthe importance of looking to the “‘totality of the circumstances’” in reasonable\nsuspicion analyses.  See id. at 273 (quoting Cortez, 449 U.S. at 417–18).  Dr.\nFagan’s report, though quantitative, attempts no such mechanistic analysis, because\n68\n\nanalysis other sources of information, such as “911 calls or SPRINT Reports,\nmemobooks, arrest and complaint reports, Trespass Crimes Fact Sheets, Owner’s\nAffidavits and/or criminal court complaints.”231  Defendants also criticize Dr.\nFagan for having no expertise regarding police training on street stops and\nreasonable suspicion, and for having conducted no interviews with police\npersonnel.232\nIf defendants believe that such research would have shown that\nreasonable suspicion existed for some or all of Dr. Fagan’s 1,044 unlawful stops,\ndefendants were free to conduct such research themselves and introduce evidence\nrebutting Dr. Fagan’s conclusions regarding specific UF-250 forms.  Defendants\nit does not claim to be the final word on whether reasonable suspicion existed for\nany individual stop in the UF-250 database.  See Fagan Report at 15 (identifying\nstops “where there does not appear” to be any combination of factors justifying a\ntrespass stop (emphasis added)).  Accord Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 293 (noting that\n“(il)legality of a stop” cannot be “conclusively determined on the basis of\npaperwork alone,” and clarifying that the UF-250 database “is necessarily an\nincomplete reflection of the totality of the circumstances leading to each stop”). \nUnlike a hearing on a single motion to suppress, this hearing aims to determine,\nbased on necessarily limited data, whether the City and NYPD engaged in a\nwidespread practice of constitutional violations.\n231 Def. Findings ¶ 7.\n232 See id. ¶ 4.\n69\n\ndid not.233  In general, as I stated when evaluating Dr. Fagan’s methods in Floyd,\nthe contents of UF-250s are admissible and probative.234  As defendants themselves\nemphasize, officers are required to record all the reasons justifying a stop,235 and\nthe UF-250 provides spaces for officers to record any reason.236  To the extent that\nplaintiffs used the UF-250 database primarily to estimate the magnitude of the\nproblem at issue in this case, plaintiffs were under no legal obligation to\nsupplement “the extremely rich and informative material”237 contained in the UF-\n233 Similarly, defendants speculate that some of the buildings Dr. Fagan\nidentified as Clean Halls buildings might not have been enrolled in Clean Halls on\nthe date of the stop.  See id. ¶ 10.  Yet defendants fail to identify a single stop for\nwhich this was actually the case.\n234 See Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 290–91.  Defendants’ expert misquotes\nthis earlier opinion as flatly holding that “it would be improper to declare certain\nstops ‘unjustified’ and others ‘justified’ on the basis of paperwork alone.”  Report\nof Defendant[s’] Expert Dr. Dennis Smith in Response to Plaintiffs’ Expert Dr.\nJeffrey Fagan (“Smith Report”), Def. Ex. JJJJ, at 3 n.3 (quoting Floyd, 861 F.\nSupp. 2d at 291).  In fact, the quoted sentence continues:  “without offering any\nqualifications:  a perfectly lawful stop cannot be made unlawful because the\narresting officer has done a poor job filling out the post-arrest paperwork; nor can\nan egregiously unlawful stop be cured by fabrication of the paperwork.”  Floyd,\n861 F.

Supp. 2d at 292.\n70\n\n250 database with other paperwork or testimony.\nIn any case, even if there are reasons to believe that Dr. Fagan’s\nexclusive reliance on UF-250s led to inaccuracies, the inaccuracies generally\nfavored defendants, not plaintiffs.  UF-250s present a one-sided picture of a stop: \nthey are completed not by neutral third parties, or with the cooperation of the\nstopped person, but by officers who have obvious incentives to justify the stops\nthey have made.238  More significantly, evidence from the hearing suggested that\nmany stops take place for which no UF-250 form is ever generated.  Sgt. Musick\nfailed to identify a single UF-250 form for any of the eleven stops to which\nplaintiffs testified,239 and in both of the stops where officers were clearly identified,\nthe officers admitted that they had failed to complete a UF-250 for the stop.240 \nPlaintiffs also introduced two reports by the Civilian Complaint Review Board\n(“CCRB”) stating that there is a systemic problem with officers failing to complete\n238 This conclusion receives anecdotal support from Officer Santiago’s\nerroneous paperwork regarding Bradley’s arrest, which tended to overstate rather\nthan understate the justifications for the arrest.  See Bradley Fact Sheet.\n239 See Tr. 10/23 at 1125–1143.\n240 See Tr. 10/22 at 1024:2–7 (Officer Ramdeen’s failure to complete UF-\n250 for Turner’s stop); Tr. 10/23 at 1110:3–18 (Officer Santiago’s failure to\ncomplete UF-250 for Bradley’s stop).  \n71\n\nUF-250 forms after stops.241  \nIn light of the above, I reject defendants’ contention that the sole\nreliance on UF-250 forms as a statistical tool provides a categorically inadequate\nbasis for determining the rough magnitude of unlawful stops in this case.  I also\nfind that failures to fill out UF-250 forms likely led to a significant undercounting\nof both lawful and unlawful stops in Dr. Fagan’s analysis.\nSecond, defendants attack Dr. Fagan’s analysis based on his failure to\ntake account of a field on the UF-250 labeled “Period of Observation Prior To\nStop.”242  Defendants correctly note that the location field that Dr. Fagan matched\nto Clean Halls addresses indicates not the location of the suspected trespass but the\nlocation of the stop.243  According to defendants’ theory, Dr. Fagan’s analysis\novercounted the number of outdoor stops based on suspicion of trespass in Clean\n241 See CCRB 2010 Annual Report, Pl. Ex. 78, at 13 (2010 report\ndescribing failure to fill out UF-250s as “major failure[]”); CCRB 2011 Annual\nReport, Pl. Ex. 79, at 14 (2011 Report describing same as “major categor[y] of\nfailure”).  I note that the NYPD Legal Bureau’s PowerPoint presentation at\nRodman’s Neck may be read as suggesting, erroneously, that UF-250s need not be\nprepared when a stop results in arrest:  “If the investigation does not lead to an\narrest the individual must be released immediately, and a UF-250 must be\nprepared.”  NYPD Legal Bureau, Street Encounters PowerPoint Presentation\n(“Street Encounters Presentation”), Def. Ex. J, at 27.  But see id. at 33 (stating that\na UF-250 must be prepared for every stop that is based on reasonable suspicion).\n242 See Def. Findings ¶ 6; App. B.\n243 See Tr. 10/15 at 45:14–47:4.\n72\n\nHalls buildings because officers may have stopped someone near a Clean Halls\nbuilding on suspicion of trespass in a nearby building.244  As defendants conceded\nin their opening argument, however, the possibility of a discrepancy between the\nlocation of the suspected trespass and the location of the stop “cuts both ways.”245 \nJust as Dr. Fagan’s analysis might erroneously include stops that were in fact based\non suspicion of trespass in a building near a Clean Halls building, so might his\nanalysis erroneously exclude stops that were based on suspicion of trespass in a\nClean Halls building but took place elsewhere.246  I am not persuaded that one\neffect would be larger than the other.\nOn the other hand, there is some validity to defendants’ argument that\nDr. Fagan’s method might have failed to exclude stops based wholly or in part on\nobservations of indoor behavior, despite Dr. Fagan’s attempt to exclude these\nstops.247  Dr. Fagan assumed that whenever an officer checked “Outside” rather\nthan “Inside” on a UF-250 and gave no indication elsewhere on the form of having\n244 See Def.

Findings ¶ 10. \n73\n\nobserved indoor behavior,248 the officer’s suspicion was not based at all on an\nobservation of indoor behavior.249  But it is easy to imagine an officer observing\nbehavior inside a Clean Halls building, making a stop outside, checking the\n“Outside” box as a result of the stop location, describing the location of the\noutdoor stop in greater detail in the “Type of Location” field, and failing to\nindicate elsewhere on the form that all or part of the observed behavior took place\ninside.\nNonetheless, defendants have failed to show why it was necessary for\nDr. Fagan to exclude all stops involving the observation of indoor behavior in the\nfirst place.  An outdoor stop based on the observation of unsuspicious indoor\nbehavior may be just as unconstitutional, and just as potentially relevant to\nestablishing a pattern of unlawful trespass stops outside Clean Halls buildings,250 as\n248 According to plaintiffs, the UF-250 database fields that could contain\ntext suggesting an observation of indoor behavior included the field called\n“premname,” as summarized in App. D to the Fagan Report, and the field called\n“detailSA,” as summarized in App. E to the Fagan Report.\n249 See Fagan Report at 3–4; Tr. 10/15 at 73:8–77:7, 128:1–130:16.\n250 See Pl. Findings ¶ 69 (stating plaintiffs’ claim as follows:  “[T]he\ndefendants have a pattern and practice of unlawful stops on suspicion of\ntrespassing outside TAP buildings in the Bronx.”).  Some of the text strings in\nFagan Report Appendices D and E that indicate indoor behavior also indicate\nreasonable suspicion for a trespass stop, such as “DRINKING IN REAR OF\nBUILDING,” and “STAIRWELL DRINKING.”  App. E to Fagan Report.  Many\nothers, however, do not.  See App. D to Fagan Report (excluding stops with text\n74\n\na stop based solely on the observation of unsuspicious outdoor behavior near a\nTAP building, or a person exiting a TAP building.  Perhaps Dr. Fagan attempted to\nexclude all stops involving the observation of indoor behavior because these stops\nas a group tend to have a greater likelihood of being based on reasonable\nsuspicion, especially if the officer observed the person indoors for a long period of\ntime.  If so, the exclusion was a gesture of methodological conservatism,251 and the\napparent unfeasibility of perfectly executing the exclusion should not be held\nagainst plaintiffs.  While Dr. Fagan’s methods may have failed to exclude some\nstops that were preceded by an observation of indoor behavior, this failure, by\nitself, is unlikely to have any significant impact on the validity of Dr. Fagan’s\nconclusions.252\nThird, defendants criticize Dr. Fagan for having departed from\nstrings such as “LOBBY,” and “VESTIBULE”); App. E to Fagan Report (same\nwith text strings such as “INSIDE CLEAN HALLS,” and “SUSPECT\nOBSERVED INSIDE CLEAN HALL BUILDING”).\n251 Dr. Fagan’s testimony suggested that he attempted to exclude any stop\nthat was “not purely an outdoor stop.”  See Tr. 10/15 at 74:3–5 (emphasis added).\n252 A similar argument applies to defendants’ assertion that Dr. Fagan’s\nmethod failed to exclude some stops that took place outside a Clean Halls building\nbut within the legal limits of the property on which the building sits.

An unconstitutional stop outside a Clean\nHalls building but within the property line can support the existence of a pattern of\nunconstitutional stops outside Clean Halls buildings just as well as an\nunconstitutional stop a few steps outside the lot boundary.\n75\n\nmethods he used to analyze UF-250 forms in Davis and Floyd.253  I decline to\nevaluate Dr. Fagan’s simple methods in the instant case through the circuitous\nroute proposed by defendants of analyzing Dr. Fagan’s far more complicated\nmethods in the other two cases, determining whether those methods were valid,\ncomparing those methods to Dr. Fagan’s methods in the instant case, analyzing\nwhether Dr. Fagan’s methods in the instant case are consistent with the methods in\nthe other two cases, and then, if any inconsistency arises, rejecting Dr. Fagan’s\nmethods in the instant case on that basis.  Instead, I will simply evaluate the\nvalidity of Dr. Fagan’s methods in the instant case on their own terms.  \nFurthermore, it would be entirely understandable if the application of\nthe method from Floyd to the instant case resulted in a lower count of unlawful\nstops than the method Dr. Fagan used here.  The explanation for such a\ndiscrepancy is apparent.  Dr. Fagan used more conservative assumptions\nthroughout Floyd than in the instant case, and with valid reason.254  The universe of\nstops that Floyd analyzes for unconstitutionality is vastly larger than the universe\n253 See Def. Findings ¶ 4 (citing generally Dr. Fagan’s analyses in Floyd\nand Davis).\n254 For example, Dr. Fagan assumed in Floyd and Davis, which also dealt\nwith a far larger universe of stops, that Furtive Movements in combination with\nHigh Crime Area should be coded as constituting reasonable suspicion.  See Tr.\n10/15 at 151:2–5.\n76\n\nanalyzed for unconstitutionality as part of the instant motion — 2.8 million stops\nversus 1,663.255  As a result, the plaintiffs in Floyd have less of a need for precision\nthan plaintiffs in the instant case.  That does not mean that plaintiffs’ precision in\nthe instant case is spurious.  Dr. Fagan’s credibility should hardly be questioned in\nthe instant case simply because, for whatever strategic or pragmatic reasons, he\nchose cautious but more manageable methods in another case that might result in a\nlarge number of unlawful stops being coded as lawful.  Once again, the relevant\nquestion in evaluating Dr. Fagan’s methods in the instant case is whether the\nmethods are valid here, not whether they are identical to the methods used in a\ndifferent case based on a different universe of stops.256\nFourth, defendants persuasively note that Dr. Fagan’s analysis,\n255 Compare Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 278, with Period of Observation\nTable.\n256 In addition, I note that the method in Floyd aims to identify stops for\nwhich no reasonable suspicion of any crime exists, whereas the method in the\ninstant case aims to identify stops for which no reasonable suspicion of trespass\nexists.  Given a universe of forms recording stops based only on suspicion of\ntrespass, there may be some forms containing data that could arguably constitute\nreasonable suspicion of some crime, but not of trespass.  The Floyd method will\nidentify these stops as arguably lawful, while Dr. Fagan’s method in the instant\ncase will identify them as apparently unlawful.  As a result, Dr. Fagan’s method in\nthe instant case will result in a higher count of unlawful stops than his method in\nFloyd.  This does not imply bad faith or a contradiction in Dr. Fagan’s methods,\nmuch less prove the invalidity of Dr. Fagan’s method in the instant case.  Floyd\nand Ligon simply aim to assess different sets of stops.\n77\n\nstanding alone, does not provide a convincing methodology for establishing a\ncausal nexus between the Clean Halls program and the stops that Dr. Fagan\nanalyzed.257  As Dr. Smith, stated in his report:  \nProfessor  Fagan’s  methodology,  by  its  very  nature,  cannot\ndistinguish between whatever impact Clean Halls may have had\non the pattern of Terry stops in the Bronx [and] the impact other\nfactors . . . might have had on that same pattern.  . . .  [I]t would be\ninvalid to conclude that Professor Fagan has demonstrated that the\nClean Halls program itself, and its implementation, caused the\noutcomes Professor Fagan observes and the Plaintiffs challenge.258\nIn essence, Dr. Fagan selected a set of stops from the UF-250 database\nbased on several selection criteria — the stops had to be in the Bronx, on suspicion\nof trespass only, at the location of a Clean Halls address, outside, and so on259 —\nand then determined how many of the stops in the set were unjustified.  This\napproach cannot show whether stops in the set were more likely to be unjustified\nthan stops in the UF-250 database in general, or stops in some other relevant set. \nMuch less can this approach show that belonging to the set causes an increased\nlikelihood that a stop will be unjustified.  Just as Dr. Fagan analyzed the number\n257 See Def. Findings ¶ 3 (citing Tr. 10/23 at 1172–77; Smith Report at\n7–29).\n258 Smith Report at 8 (emphasis added).\n259 See Fagan Report at 8 tbl.1; Tr. 10/15 at 83:15–85:7, 124:25–126:17\n(excluding stops at NYCHA addresses).\n78\n\nand percentage of trespass stops outside Clean Halls buildings that were\nunjustified, one could analyze the quantity of unjustified trespass stops outside any\narbitrary category of building — such as green buildings, or buildings with odd-\nnumbered addresses.  If, hypothetically, the police were making a large number of\nunjustified stops throughout New York City, the analysis would show that a large\nnumber of stops outside odd-numbered buildings were unjustified.  It would\nobviously be inappropriate to infer from this that the police had a customary\npractice of making unlawful stops outside odd-numbered buildings, or to grant a\npreliminary injunction requiring the police to conduct specific training regarding\nstops outside odd-numbered buildings.260\nThus, defendants are correct that Dr. Fagan’s analysis, standing alone,\ncannot establish a causal nexus between Clean Halls buildings and unlawful\ntrespass stops.  But plaintiffs have already established a clear likelihood of proving\nsuch a nexus based on other evidence.  ADA Rucker credibly testified to the police\n260 Plaintiffs imply in their Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“Reply Mem.”) that it is not\nnecessary for plaintiffs to prove “that officers are stopping people because the\nbuilding is enrolled in the Clean Halls program.”  Reply Mem. at 3.  But as the\nanalogy to the odd-numbered building hypothetical suggests, this cannot be\ncorrect.  Plaintiffs’ request for preliminary relief depends on there being a specific\nproblem involving stops outside Clean Halls buildings, a problem that can only be\npartially solved by improving the general training regarding the law of stop and\nfrisk.\n79\n\nrepeatedly making unjustified trespass stops and arrests outside Clean Halls\nbuildings because they were Clean Halls buildings.261  One plaintiff testified that\nan officer explained an unlawful trespass stop based on the fact that it took place\noutside a Clean Halls building.262  As discussed below, an officer in the NYPD’s\nLegal Bureau learned through focus groups with sergeants and lieutenants that they\nbelieved it was legal to approach and question, if not stop, anyone in a TAP\nbuilding even without a reason for doing so.263  Finally, on 417 of the UF-250s in\nDr. Fagan’s original universe of 1,857 trespass stops outside Clean Halls buildings,\nofficers handwrote phrases or words to the effect of “Clean Halls” or “Trespass\nAffidavit.”264  The purpose of a UF-250 is to record the circumstances that led to an\n261 See supra Part IV.A.1.\n262 See Tr. 10/17 at 481:7–482:8 (Hispanic officer in Turner stop).  I also\nnote — though the evidence does not relate directly to the outdoor stops at issue in\nthis case — that Officer Santiago testified that even after receiving the NYPD’s\nstop and frisk training at Rodman’s Neck, he still believed there was legal\njustification to ask anyone in the lobby or hallways of a Clean Halls building for an\nID, even in the absence of any suspicion, reasonable or otherwise.  See Tr. 10/23 at\n1111:2–1113:10.  Officer Santiago attempted to qualify this rule by stating that the\nbuilding needed to be in a high crime area in order to justify a request for ID.  See\nid. at 1111:9–22.  He then undermined this qualification by stating, categorically,\nthat all Clean Halls buildings are in high crime areas.  See id. at 1111:24–1112:1.\n263 See Tr. 10/18 at 648:18–649:16.\n264 See Tr. 10/15 at 124:18–24.\n80\n\nofficer’s stop.265  The frequency with which officers took the time to note “Clean\nHalls” on a form, even though there is no specific field or checkbox and no reason\nfor doing so,266 suggests that many officers thought a building’s enrollment in\nClean Halls contributed to the justification for the stop.\nFifth, defendants challenge the methods and assumptions Dr. Fagan\nfollowed in processing the information contained on UF-250 forms into\nconclusions regarding the number of unlawful stops.267  Not surprisingly,\ndefendants argue that many of the forms Dr. Fagan identified as lacking an\narticulation of reasonable suspicion in fact contained such an articulation.  Because\nthese arguments involve mixed questions of fact and law that depend on a fine-\ngrained analysis of what constitutes reasonable suspicion, I will address them in\nmy conclusions of law below.268  In any case, the facts regarding how Dr. Fagan\ncounted the number of unlawful stops are not in material dispute.\nBased on the testimony of plaintiffs and others, the decline to\nprosecute forms, and the statistical analysis performed by Dr. Fagan and discussed\n265 See id. at 123:17–20.\n266 See id. at 124:14–17; Tr. 10/22 at 1058:24–1059:2, 1072:9–19; Tr.\n10/23 at 1110:23–1111:1; App. B.\n267 See Def. Findings ¶¶ 3, 6, 8–10.\n268 See infra Part V.B.1.a.\n81\n\nin greater detail below, I find that plaintiffs have shown a clear likelihood of laying\na sufficient factual foundation to prove that defendants have engaged in a\nwidespread practice of making unlawful trespass stops outside TAP buildings in\nthe Bronx.\nB. Steps Taken by the NYPD in 2012\nTAP began in the early 1990s in Manhattan.269  Despite the program’s\nname, TAP was originally focused not on trespass but on narcotics sales taking\nplace in the common areas of private buildings, such as lobbies, stairwells, and\nrooftops.270  An officer who testified regarding the origins of TAP stated that “[t]he\nmore that we cracked down on drug sales on the street, the more that you saw drug\ndealers move indoors.”271  Before TAP, officers had to deal informally with\n269 See Tr. 10/17 at 519:8–520:16; Smith Report at 10–11; NYPD Legal\nBureau, Trespass Affidavit Program: Legal Guidelines for Citizen Encounters in\nTrespass Affidavit Buildings (“1999 TAP Legal Guidelines”), Def. Ex. O, at 1. \nWhen TAP expanded to the Bronx, it was called “Clean Halls,” though as of May\n2012 the NYPD has begun referring uniformly to the program as TAP.  See Tr.\n10/17 at 520:17–521:7.  In Queens, TAP was referred to, inexplicably, as “FTAP.” \nSee id.\n270 See Tr. 10/17 at 519:23–520:16.  For the historical background of the\nWar on Drugs, see WILLIAM J.

In 1999, the NYPD’s Legal Bureau created its\n“Legal Guidelines for Citizen Encounters in Trespass Affidavit Buildings.”  See\n1999 TAP Legal Guidelines.  One passage of the fourteen-page document states: \n“IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD THAT WHEN AN OFFICER IS NOT IN THE\nBUILDING (E.G., SITTING ACROSS THE STREET IN AN R.M.P.), MERELY\nOBSERVING AN INDIVIDUAL ENTERING AND EXITING THE BUILDING,\nOR SIMPLY EXITING THE BUILDING, IS NOT ENOUGH TO CONDUCT A\nSTOP.”  Id. at 6; Tr. 10/18 at 684:2–4.  But Inspector Sweet testified that he did\nnot know of anyone to whom the document had been distributed.  See Tr. 10/18 at\n654:5–7.  Defendants argue that a document from 2000 called Patrol Guide 212-\n59, “Vertical Patrol” (P.G. 212-59), Def. Ex. FFFF, governed TAP before the 2012\nInterim Orders.  See Def. Findings ¶ 26 & n.15 (citing P.G. 212-59).  But P.G. 212-\n59 provides general guidelines for conducting vertical patrols and makes no\nmention of TAP or Clean Halls.

NYPD Recognition of a Problem in TAP\nThe improvements to TAP in 2012 had their roots in earlier years. \nInspector Kerry Sweet, the executive officer of the NYPD Legal Bureau, testified\nthat by early 2010, he had become involved in a group that was examining vertical\npatrols and trespass issues in NYCHA buildings.277  Inspector Sweet received\napproval to examine these issues in the TAP program as well.278  In the summer of\n2010 through 2011, Inspector Sweet conducted focus groups with sergeants and\nlieutenants involved with TAP, and then with prosecutors and various NYPD\nofficials.279  Inspector Sweet learned that “there really wasn’t a lot of direction\nabout the administration of the program.”280  During his deposition, Inspector\nSweet testified that he also learned of “some confusion” regarding TAP stops:\n[O]fficers believe their role might have been as doorman [or]\n276 See Tr. 10/19 at 773:23–775:14.  The survey revealed that there were\nover eight thousand buildings enrolled in TAP, including over three thousand in\nthe Bronx.

And once\nagain, understanding that they needed that articulate reason to\napproach somebody and that if you were a doorman, you could\napproach everybody, but that is not the case.  . . .  [I]n TAP\nbuildings, you have to have a reason to approach people.\n. . .\nI wasn’t getting the sense necessarily that they were stopping\npeople in their tracks, but they may have been asking everybody\ncoming into a building, what are you doing here, what is your\nreason for being here.  And that obviously isn’t what we want\nthem to do nor is it probably the right thing to do under the De\nBour standard.281\n  \nInspector Sweet testified that Katherine Lemire, special counsel to Police\nCommissioner Raymond Kelly, attended meetings with Inspector Sweet where this\nproblem was discussed.282  \n2. Interim Orders 22 and 23 of 2012\nAfter completing the focus groups in 2010 and 2011, Inspector Sweet\nhelped to draft two new regulations to govern the TAP program:  Interim Orders\n281 Tr. 10/18 at 648:18–649:16.  I note that Inspector Sweet’s testimony\nregarding what officers said at the focus groups appears to refer to the practice of\nstops without reasonable suspicion inside TAP buildings, and thus does not\nnecessarily indicate that Inspector Sweet was aware of the problem of unlawful\nstops outside TAP buildings.  At the hearing, Inspector Sweet also emphasized that\nhis concern was with unlawful approaches, not unlawful stops.

The second page of the Order begins with an\nitalicized warning:\nA uniformed member of the service may approach and question\npersons if they [sic] have an objective credible reason to do so. \nHowever, a uniformed member may not stop (temporarily detain)\na suspected trespasser unless the uniformed member reasonably\nsuspects that the person is in the building without authorization.286\nThe next page, in a separate section, repeats the first sentence of this note, and then\ncontinues, again in italics:\nWhen reasonable suspicion exists, a STOP, QUESTION AND\nFRISK REPORT WORKSHEET shall be prepared as per P.G.\n212-11, “Stop and Frisk.”  Some factors which may contribute to\n283 See Tr. 10/17 at 534:6–536:1; Interim Order 22 of 2012 (“IO 22 of\n2012”), Def.

Absence of Steps Meaningfully Addressing Outdoor TAP\nStops\nDuring the hearing, defendants emphasized the training that officers\nreceive throughout their careers regarding the laws governing stop and frisk in\ngeneral.302  This training has recently been supplemented by a refresher course on\nstop and frisk at the Rodman’s Neck training center in the Bronx.303  More than\nthree thousand officers have attended the training course since its development in\n2012.304\nThe root problem that led to unlawful trespass stops outside TAP\nbuildings in the Bronx, however, based on ADA Rucker’s testimony and the other\nevidence introduced at the hearing, is that officers perceived trespass stops in the\nproximity of TAP buildings as exceptions to the general rules governing stop and\nfrisk.  Improving the training surrounding stop and frisk in general may do nothing\nto dispel the notion that there is an exception for stops outside TAP buildings.\nIO 22 of 2012 makes clear that presence inside a TAP building is not\n301 See infra Part V.B.1.b.\n302 See Def. Findings ¶¶ 35–36.\n303 See Tr. 10/17 at 571:25–572:23.\n304 See Tr. 10/19 at 888:1–2; Tr. 10/22 at 955:8–13.\n90\n\na sufficient basis for a stop, and that stops made during vertical patrols of TAP\nbuildings must be based on reasonable suspicion.  But IO 22 of 2012 and the\ntraining introduced in support of it present themselves as guides to conducting\nvertical patrols inside a TAP building, not guides for making trespass stops and\narrests outside TAP buildings.  The difference may seem insignificant when\nviewed in the abstract.  In theory, officers should be able to infer from the rules in\nIO 22 of 2012 how to perform lawful trespass stops outside TAP buildings.  \nIn practice, however, the evidence at the hearing suggests that NYPD\nofficers are trained to carry out their duties according to a set of standard operating\nprocedures.  The NYPD’s training reduces the unpredictable, confusing challenges\nthat arise on patrol to a manageable set of standard situations and orderly\nprocedures for addressing them.305  If a recurring, problematic situation is not\n305 IO 22 of 2012, for example, defines the standard scenario for a\nvertical patrol in a TAP building, lays out various common problems that may arise\nduring such a patrol, and prescribes what to do and what not to do in response to\nthem, including specific questions to ask.  See IO 22 of 2012 at 2.  After receiving\ntraining on IO 22 of 2012, including role-play simulations, see Tr. 10/19 at\n836:7–840:13, an officer will have less need to improvise under pressure or base\nhis or her responses on inferences from general principles or analogies to other\nscenarios.  In this sense, the NYPD’s training follows the model of a traditional\nWestern military academy, which aims “to reduce the conduct of war to a set of\nrules and a system of procedures — and thereby to make orderly and rational what\nis essentially chaotic and instinctive.”  JOHN KEEGAN, THE FACE OF BATTLE 18\n(1976).

The evidence at the hearing, as summarized in the previous section,\nstrongly supports the conclusion that many officers took such actions before\n2012.306  Yet none of the steps taken by the NYPD in 2012 were directly and\nmeaningfully focused on uprooting the misconceptions regarding trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings that resulted in the constitutional violations in this case.\nIn fact, based on the evidence at the hearing, the only piece of\ninstruction that has been provided to officers on a systematic basis and that\nspecifically targets the problem of outdoor trespass stops at TAP buildings is a\nsingle bullet point included in a PowerPoint presentation offered by the Legal\nBureau as part of the Rodman’s Neck training.307  The bullet point, which takes up\n306 As plaintiffs stated in their summation:  “We have a 20-year program. \nThere is a culture around these stops.

A former commanding officer of the New York City\nPolice Academy testified that the role-playing at Rodman’s Neck sometimes\ninvolves individuals standing outside of TAP buildings, but the individuals appear\nto play the role of civilian bystanders and witnesses, not suspects.  See Tr. 10/19 at\n815:11–14, 838:25–840:9.  Chief Hall testified that “we have made [it] clear” to\nofficers that “we do not want” them “stopping an individual outside of [a] Clean\nHalls building simply because they are exiting a building, without more.”  Tr.\n11/23 at 1244: 6–12.

One officer who\nhad recently attended the refresher course at Rodman’s Neck testified that he did\nnot remember any discussion of TAP,309 and both he and another officer testified\nthat they could not remember any training involving outdoor stops on suspicion of\ntrespass.310\nIn light of the above, and in the absence of reliable statistics regarding\nstops in 2012, I find that defendants failed to introduce persuasive evidence\nregarding whether the improvements undertaken by the NYPD in 2012 have\naffected the magnitude of unlawful trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the\nBronx.311\n308 Street Encounters Presentation at 40.\n309 See Tr. 10/22 at 1043:17–1044:13.\n310 See id.; Tr. 10/23 at 1111:2–8.\n311 Defendants introduced evidence of a dramatic reduction in declines to\nprosecute for trespass arrests, in general, in the Bronx in 2012.

Standing\nAs a preliminary matter, defendants argue that plaintiffs lack standing\nto seek injunctive relief.312  I addressed this issue extensively in Floyd, and again in\nDavis, and the same analysis applies here.313  First, “[c]oncrete injury is a\nprerequisite to standing and a ‘plaintiff seeking injunctive or declaratory relief\ncannot rely on past injury to satisfy the injury requirement but must show a\nlikelihood that he or she will be injured in the future.’”314  Second, “‘[t]he\npossibility of recurring injury ceases to be speculative when actual repeated\nincidents are documented.’”315  Third, “‘the presence of one party with standing is\nsufficient to satisfy Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement.’”316  \nat 726:18–727:7; Tr. 10/23 at 1249:7–17.  But this obviously does not provide a\nreliable basis for inferring that unlawful trespass stops outside TAP buildings have\ndeclined.\n312 See Def.

Preliminary Injunctive Relief\nPlaintiffs seek a variety of injunctive remedies that would require the\nNYPD to act in ways that depart from the status quo, including the development\nand implementation of new formal policies, new training procedures, and\nburdensome new supervisory and monitoring procedures.322  Because the\npreliminary injunctive relief sought by plaintiffs is thus mandatory rather than\nprohibitory, plaintiffs must show (1) that they are clearly or substantially likely to\nprove at trial that defendants are engaged in an ongoing custom of making trespass\nstops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx in the absence of reasonable suspicion, in\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment; (2) that plaintiffs are likely to suffer\nirreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief; (3) that the balance of equities\ntips in plaintiffs’ favor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.323\n321 Of course, plaintiffs would not be likely to suffer injury in the future if\nthe NYPD no longer had a custom of making unlawful trespass stops outside TAP\nbuildings.  But while defendants have introduced evidence of certain changes in\nthe NYPD’s policies and training in 2012, defendants have not proven that the\nNYPD’s custom of making unlawful trespass stops outside TAP buildings has\nended.  See supra Part IV.B.3; infra Part V.B.1.b.\n322 See Pl. Findings ¶¶ 72–75.  The remedies proposed in this Opinion,\nthough not identical to those requested by plaintiffs, remain largely mandatory in\nnature.  See infra Part V.C.\n323 See supra Part II.\n96\n\nThe following sections address each of these factors in turn.\n1. Clear or Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nBecause plaintiffs do not assert that defendants have an explicit or\nformally approved policy of making trespass stops without reasonable suspicion\noutside TAP buildings in the Bronx, plaintiffs must show a clear or substantial\nlikelihood of proving at trial that defendants have a custom or usage of making\nsuch stops.  Specifically, plaintiffs argue that defendants “have a pattern and\npractice” of making unlawful trespass stops outside TAP buildings, and that “the\nCity of New York has been deliberately indifferent” to this practice “by failing to\nsupervise and train.”324  \nMy analysis of plaintiffs’ claim proceeds in two steps.  First, I analyze\nplaintiffs’ deliberate indifference claim and conclude that plaintiffs have shown a\nclear likelihood of establishing that defendants’ longstanding failure to train\nofficers regarding the legal standards for trespass stops outside TAP buildings in\nthe Bronx, despite actual or constructive notice that this omission was causing city\nemployees to violate individuals’ constitutional rights, has risen to the level of\ndeliberate indifference.  Whether plaintiffs’ deliberate indifference claim is\n324 Pl. Findings ¶¶ 69–70.  Plaintiffs present the former as a “constructive\nacquiescence” claim, and the latter as a deliberate indifference claim based on\nfailure to train.  See id.  Because constructive acquiescence is merely a way of\nproving deliberate indifference, I analyze the claims together.\n97\n\nanalyzed in terms of the general standard in Connick, the three-part Walker\nstandard, or the constructive acquiescence standard, plaintiffs have shown a clear\nlikelihood of success on their Monell claim.  Second, I analyze whether defendants\nhave rebutted plaintiffs’ evidence of deliberate indifference based on the steps\ntaken by the NYPD in 2012.  I conclude that these steps have not meaningfully\naddressed the specific problem of unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP\nbuildings in the Bronx.\na. Deliberate Indifference\nApplying the law of Terry stops to my findings of fact, above,\nplaintiffs offered more than enough evidence at the hearing to support the\nconclusion that they have shown a clear likelihood of proving at trial that the\nNYPD has a practice of making unlawful trespass stops outside of TAP buildings\nin the Bronx:\ni. ADA Rucker’s Testimony  \nAs described above, ADA Rucker credibly testified that NYPD\nofficers have treated proximity to a TAP building as a factor contributing to\nreasonable suspicion, and have frequently made trespass stops outside TAP\nbuildings for no reason other than that the officer had seen someone enter and exit\n98\n\nor exit the building.325  These stops were made because the building was enrolled\nin TAP, and they were not based on any reasonable suspicion of trespass.326  ADA\nRucker’s testimony is corroborated by the accounts of stops and arrests in the\ntwenty-six decline to prosecute forms, as well as by the hundreds of UF-250s on\nwhich officers wrote “Clean Halls” as a justification for a stop.327  As discussed\nbelow, Dr. Fagan’s analysis of UF-250s provides further corroboration of ADA\nRucker’s testimony.328\nii. Plaintiffs’ Stops\nThe conclusion that the NYPD has repeatedly made trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings without reasonable suspicion is further supported by the\ncredible and mutually corroborating testimony of named plaintiffs regarding the\ncircumstances leading to their encounters with police.329  First, with the exception\nof Ledan’s two police encounters, each of plaintiffs’ encounters with the police\nconstituted Terry stops requiring reasonable suspicion.  As Ledan’s first encounter\nillustrates, it is possible for an officer to approach a person outside a TAP building\n325 See supra Part IV.A.1.\n326 See id. \n327 See Tr. 10/15 at 124:18–24; Fagan Report at 13.\n328 See infra Part V.B.1.a.iii.\n329 See supra Part IV.A.2.\n99\n\nand ask the person her name, where she is coming from, whether she lives in the\nbuilding, and if not, whether she knows anyone in the building, all the while acting\nin such a way that a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter\nand go about her business.  But the other plaintiffs’ testimony showed that many\ntrespass-related encounters outside TAP buildings involve aggressive, coercive,\nand threatening police behavior that would not leave a reasonable person feeling\nfree to terminate the encounter.  \nBradley was stopped when an officer in a van gestured for him to\ncome over, he came over, and the officer asked “What are you doing here?”330 \nTurner was stopped when three officers approached and one “snatched the phone\nout of [his] hand,”331 abruptly and aggressively ending his call and taking control\nof his property, without any request for permission to do so.  The stop continued as\nthe officer asked Turner what he was doing and whether he lived in the building\nbeside which he was standing.332  Turner was stopped a second time when a police\ncar pulled up in front of him as he and others were exiting a Clean Halls building,\n330 Tr. 10/16 at 266:3.\n331 Tr. 10/17 at 477:8.\n332 See id. at 478:13–22, 479:8–11.\n100\n\nan officer got out, questioned the group, and requested Turner’s identification.333 \nJ.G. was stopped when five officers approached him outside his building, stopped\nhim, and asked him where he was coming from, where he was headed, and what he\nhad in his bag.  He was surely stopped when the officers made him raise his hands,\nfrisked him, and searched inside his pockets and his grocery bag.334  Jerome Grant\nwas stopped when two officers approached with flashlights, questioned him and\nhis friends to determine whether they were trespassing, and in response to\nquestions from those who were stopped, replied with strong words such as “I’m the\none that’s talking here,”335 and “hush up.”336  Roshea Johnson was stopped when a\nblack van pulled up in front of him with police officers inside and one of them\nbegan questioning him about trespassing.337  He was certainly stopped — and\narrested — a moment later when he was placed in handcuffs in the back of the\nvan.338\nNo reasonable person would have felt free to leave in these plaintiffs’\n333 See id. at 486:9–490:25.\n334 See id. at 437:17, 439:4–443:2.\n335 Id. at 456:13.\n336 Id. at 456:18–19.\n337 See id. at 399:21–400:17.\n338 See id. at 400:17–401:18.\n101\n\ncircumstances once an officer or officers approached, caused the plaintiff to stop\nthrough a command, gesture, accusatory introduction, or by taking possession of\nthe person’s property, and then began asking questions that were clearly intended\nto elicit incriminating responses regarding trespassing.  \nAny doubt that these plaintiffs were free to leave after the\ncommencement of intrusive investigatory questioning is resolved by looking to the\ninstances in the decline to prosecute forms when suspects attempted to terminate\ntheir encounters.  In one encounter, “the defendant attempted to walk away[,] at\nwhich time [the officer] grabbed the defendant[’]s arms.”339  After a struggle, the\ndefendant was arrested.340  In another encounter, “[t]he arresting officer stopped\ndefendant and defendant clenched his fists on his sides and spread his feet apart\nand . . . stated . . . YOU’RE NOT GOING TO TOUCH ME.  YOU’RE NOT\nGOING TO TOUCH ME.  YOU’RE NOT PUTTING YOUR HANDS ON ME.”341 \nThe arresting officer then handcuffed the defendant and placed him in a patrol\nvehicle.342  Similarly, when various defendants simply refused to answer an\n339 App. A ¶ 12.\n340 See id.\n341 Id. ¶ 20.\n342 See id.\n102\n\nofficer’s questions, it became clear that they were not free to terminate the\nencounter in this way either.343  In one encounter, the arresting officer “approached\nthe defendant and asked her where she was coming [from], what was she doing in\nthe building[,] and what apartment number was she visiting.  Defendant responded\nin sum and substance: I WAS VISITING A FRIEND.  I AM NOT TELLING YOU\nTHE APARTMENT NUMBER OR THE NAME.”344  The defendant was then\narrested for trespass.345\nThe responses of the police officers as summarized in the decline to\nprosecute forms do not tell a surprising story.  Indeed, they are what a reasonable\nperson would have expected under the circumstances.  When a person considers\nwalking away from an officer who has stopped her and begun asking accusatory\nquestions, it is objectively reasonable for the stopped person to believe that the\nofficer will attempt to prevent her from doing so.  Persons who are stopped by the\npolice in circumstances like those described by the plaintiffs (other than Ledan)\n343 See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 4, 15, 22, 25, 26.  In Davis, I held that “the Fifth\nAmendment prohibits police from arresting an individual for refusing to provide\n‘testimonial’ evidence.”  Davis, 2012 WL 4813837, at *14.  Whether refusal to\nprovide testimonial evidence may contribute to reasonable suspicion of trespass is\na distinct issue, and one not raised by the parties at this stage of the litigation.\n344 App. A ¶ 4.\n345 See id.\n103\n\nreasonably conclude that they are not free to terminate the encounter.  As a result,\nsuch stops are Terry stops under the Fourth Amendment,  and DeBour Level 3\nstops under New York state law, and require that the officer have a “reasonable\nsuspicion” that criminal activity may be afoot.\nSecond, all but two of the eleven encounters to which plaintiffs\ntestified appear to have been based on suspicion of trespass, but lacked the\nreasonable suspicion of trespass needed to support a Terry stop.  The two\nexceptions are Jerome Grant’s stop and Letitia Ledan’s second encounter.346\niii. Decline to Prosecute Forms\nThere remains the question of how widespread the practice of\nunlawful stops was.  Plaintiffs argue that the decline to prosecute forms\nindependently support the finding of a widespread practice of unlawful stops\noutside of TAP buildings.347  Their rather complicated argument proceeds as\n346 In Grant’s case, his cousin’s or his friend’s knocking loudly and\nperhaps angrily on the door of a Clean Halls building may have provided a\nminimal level of objective justification for suspecting that Grant and the others\nwere attempting to enter unlawfully.  See supra Part IV.A.2.d.  As noted above,\nLedan initiated her second encounter, which was most likely consensual and thus\ndid not require reasonable suspicion.  Even if the stop had been nonconsensual,\nunder the circumstances her interest in the detention of her husband and friends\nmay have provided adequate grounds for brief questioning.  See supra Part\nIV.A.2.f.\n347 See Pl. Findings ¶ 17.\n104\n\nfollows:  First, plaintiffs assume the City’s expert was correct in reporting that\napproximately thirteen percent of the trespass stops analyzed by Dr. Fagan resulted\nin arrest.348  From this, plaintiffs infer a rough, general rule that thirteen percent of\ntrespass stops in the Bronx in 2011 resulted in arrest — or in other words, for every\nrecorded trespass arrest, there were roughly 7.7 trespass stops.349  Second, in three\nrandomly selected months in 2011, the Bronx DA’s office produced at least\ntwenty-six decline to prosecute forms describing arrests that were apparently based\nonly on a person entering or exiting a TAP building.350  Because entry or exit from\na TAP building does not provide reasonable suspicion, there were at least twenty-\nsix arrests in the three sample months that were preceded by stops that were not\nbased on reasonable suspicion.  Third, if the twenty-six decline to prosecute forms\nreflect only thirteen percent of the suspicionless trespass stops outside TAP\n348 See Smith Report at 6.  \n349 See Pl. Findings ¶ 17.\n350 See supra Part IV.A.1.  In the absence of more detailed evidence or\ntestimony regarding the initial police encounters described in the decline to\nprosecute forms, I assume that the encounters were likely similar to those\ndescribed by plaintiffs, and thus that the intrusiveness of the encounters likely rose\nto the level of a Terry stop at or shortly after the time that the officer or officers\ninitiated questioning.  See generally App. A.  I also note that in many of the\nencounters described in the decline to prosecute forms, the defendant’s behavior as\ndescribed in the form never gave rise to reasonable suspicion, even after the stop\nbegan.  See App. A ¶¶ 2, 3, 8, 11, 12, 16, 17, 21, 24.\n105\n\nbuildings in the three sample months in 2011, and if the sample months were\nrepresentative of the year, then eight hundred trespass stops took place outside\nTAP buildings in the Bronx in 2011 without reasonable suspicion.351\nAssuming as I do that the decline to prosecute forms contain largely\naccurate descriptions of stops, plaintiffs’ reasoning is persuasive.  If anything,\nplaintiffs undercount the number of suspicionless stops suggested by the decline to\nprosecute forms.  Dr. Smith’s thirteen percent figure is the arrest rate for all the\ntrespass stops outside TAP buildings in Dr. Fagan’s study, including both stops\nbased on and stops lacking reasonable suspicion.352  Common sense would suggest,\nhowever, that the arrest rate for stops lacking reasonable suspicion — for example,\nstops based on nothing more than a person exiting a TAP building — should be\nsignificantly lower than the combined arrest rate for lawful and unlawful stops. \nThe lower the arrest rate for unlawful stops, the higher the number of unlawful\nstops that would be required to generate twenty-six arrests based on such stops.  If\nthe arrest rate for unlawful stops were five percent, for example, the existence of\ntwenty-six arrests in three months based on unlawful stops would imply a yearly\n351 I have altered plaintiffs’ calculations to account for the two decline to\nprosecute forms containing revisions of other forms.  See supra Part IV.A.1.\n352 See Smith Report at 6.  Dr. Fagan calculated arrest rates (or, as he\ncalled them, “hit rates”) in Floyd, but does not appear to have done so in the instant\ncase.  Compare Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 284–85, with Fagan Report. \n106\n\ntotal of more than two thousand (2,080) unlawful stops.\niv. Dr. Fagan’s Analysis\nDr. Fagan’s analysis of the UF-250 database provides further evidence\nthat plaintiffs have a clear likelihood of being able to prove at trial that the\nNYPD’s practice of unlawful stops was widespread.  In order to understand Dr.\nFagan’s claim that 1,044 trespass stops within his set apparently lacked reasonable\nsuspicion, it is necessary to understand the basic features of a UF-250 form.353  I\nhave included a copy of a blank UF-250 form as Appendix B to this Opinion.\nThe UF-250 form has two sides.354  On Side 1 there is a section\nlabeled “What Were Circumstances Which Led To Stop? (MUST CHECK AT\nLEAST ONE BOX).”  Inside the section are several boxes that officers may check,\nsuch as “Fits Description” and “Actions Indicative of Acting As A Lookout.” \nThere is also a checkbox for “Other Reasonable Suspicion Of Criminal Activity\n(Specify)” (the “Other” box) that officers can check and then supplement with a\nhandwritten note.  On the back of the form, Side 2, there is a section labeled\n“Additional Circumstances/Factors: (Check All That Apply).”  Inside this section\nthere are other checkboxes, such as “Report From Victim/Witness” and “Evasive,\n353 See Fagan Report at 15 & tbl.8; App. L to Fagan Report (“Stop Factor\nList”), Pl. Ex. 64.\n354 See App. B.\n107\n\nFalse Or Inconsistent Response To Officer’s Questions.”  As noted above, officers\nare required to record all the reasons justifying a stop.355\nIn an appendix to Dr. Fagan’s report, he lists the combinations of\nfactors from UF-250 forms that he counted as indicative of a stop apparently\nlacking reasonable suspicion of trespass.356  The list descends from the most\ncommon combinations of factors to the least common.357  On all of the forms that\nDr. Fagan identified as apparently lacking reasonable suspicion, the officer had\nchecked at most one of the listed “circumstances” on Side 1.358  In some cases the\nofficer had also checked the “Other” box on Side 1 and handwritten a text string,\nwhich Dr. Fagan also analyzed.359  \nThe most frequent combination of stop factors identified by Dr. Fagan\nas apparently inadequate were “Furtive Movements” (Side 1) and “Area Has High\n355 See Def. Findings ¶ 4 (“NYPD training evidence . . . clearly identifies\nthat its officers are instructed to include all circumstances leading to the stop on the\nworksheet[.]” (citing Tr. 10/15 at 86:12–87:2)); Tr. 10/19 at 849:13–19 (testimony\nof Chief Shea); Police Student’s Guide at 20.\n356 See Fagan Report at 15 & tbl.8; Stop Factor List.\n357 See Stop Factor List at 1.

First, on Side 1, the officer offered one of the following\nthree factors:\n1)  “Furtive Movements.”\n2)  “Other Reasonable Suspicion Of Criminal Activity (Specify)” (the\n“Other” box), and a text string referring to “Clean Halls,” “Trespass,”\nor both as the sole notation.363 \n360 See Stop Factor List at 1.\n361 See id.\n362 See id.\n363 See Fagan Report at 13 (explaining “Clean Halls/Trespass” category);\n“detailSA Stop Factor Analysis” (“‘Other’ Text Strings”), App. F to Fagan Report\nat 5–6 (listing the text strings in this category, including “CLEAN HALLS,”\n“CLEAN HALLS BLDG,” “CRIM TRES,” and “CLEAN HALLS PROGRAM-\nCRIM TRES”).\n109\n\n3) The “Other” box and words indicating the suspect was observed\nexiting the building.364\nSecond, on Side 2, under “Additional Circumstances/Factors,” the\nofficer either checked no box, or offered one of the following five justifications:\n1) High Crime Area.\n2) “Time Of Day, Day Of Week, Season Corresponding To Reports Of\nCriminal Activity” (the “Time of Day” box).\n3)  Both High Crime Area and Time of Day.\n4) “Proximity To Crime Location” (the “Proximity to Scene” box).\n5) “Changing Direction At Sight Of Officer/Flight” (the “Change\nDirection” box).\nStanding alone, Dr. Fagan’s categorizations leave a great deal of room\nfor skepticism.

In Bellamy, the court held that\nthe following stop factors did not give rise to reasonable suspicion that Bellamy\nwas trespassing in a building:\n110\n\nimagine scenarios in which an officer observing behavior that would probably give\nrise to reasonable suspicion might reasonably record that behavior by checking\nnothing more than “Furtive Movements.”  For example, an officer might observe a\nperson standing nervously outside a TAP building, pretending to walk away\nwhenever others approach, then returning after they are gone, and finally entering\nthe building without a key, nervously looking both ways before opening the door. \nI also note that in each of the twenty stops where the officer checked “Change\nDirection” on Side 2, the officer also checked “Furtive Movement” on Side 1.366  If\nthese forms were based on an officer seeing someone engage in the behavior\ndescribed above, and then run away at the sight of the officer, the officer almost\ncertainly had reasonable suspicion of trespass.367\n(1) the officers’ knowledge that the . . . building was located in a\nhigh-crime, drug-prone neighborhood; (2) the officers’ knowledge\nthat  the  .  .  .  building  had  experienced  problems  with  drug\ntrafficking and trespassing; (3) the officers’ understanding that the\nbuilding had participated in FTAP; (4) Bellamy’s presence in the\n[building’s] vestibule; (5) the presence of the supposed “crack\naddict” outside of the . . . building; and (6) Bellamy’s furtive\ngestures.\nId. at 317.\n366 See Stop Factor List.\n367 See Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 298 (discussing Wardlow, which “held\nthat a defendant’s ‘presence in an area of heavy narcotics trafficking’ and\n‘unprovoked flight upon noticing the police’ were together sufficient to raise\n111\n\nOn the other hand, there are good reasons to doubt that most, or even\nmany, of the forms marked with the combinations listed above were in fact based\non such suspicious behavior.  First, many of the 503 forms in the top ten on Dr.\nFagan’s list contain stop factor combinations providing no basis whatsoever for\nreasonable suspicion.  205 of these forms simply indicate that the person was\nstopped outside a Clean Halls building, or for criminal trespass, neither of which\nexplains why the officer’s suspicion was reasonable; or that the person was\nobserved exiting, which also contributes nothing to reasonable suspicion; and that\nthe stop took place in a high crime area and/or at a suspicious time of day, neither\nof which can establish reasonable suspicion in the absence of some additional\ncontributing factor.368  Thus, at a bare minimum, over two hundred of the five\nhundred stops at the top of Dr. Fagan’s list provide no basis for a finding of\nsuspicious behavior.\nSecond, Dr. Fagan reported that in his original universe of stops,\nofficers had checked the Other box on nearly forty percent of the UF-250 forms.369 \nreasonable suspicion and justify a stop” (quoting Wardlow, 528 U.S. at 124)).\n368 “Reasonable articulable suspicion does not exist merely on the basis\nof [High Crime Area and Time of Day]:  many people live in high crime areas and\nmany crimes occur at night; simply being in a high crime area at night is not\nsuspicious behavior.”  Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 298 (citations omitted). \n369 See Fagan Report at 11.\n112\n\nOfficers were clearly willing and able to describe suspicious behavior when they\nobserved it.370  In fact, officers frequently took the time to write notes that do not\ncontribute to reasonable suspicion.371  Given the evident eagerness of officers to\ncheck the Other box and write notes — even when they had no basis for doing so\n— it is doubtful that many officers observed the kind of highly suspicious behavior\nhypothesized above and then merely checked the Furtive Movements box.372\nThird, as Dr. Fagan notes, when police officers are in an area where\nthey are primed to look for signs that “crime is afoot,” they may be more likely to\nperceive a gesture as an indicator of criminality.373  Recent psychological research\n370 See, e.g., “Other” Text Strings at 7 (“Observed Entry” text strings\nincluding, for example, “RAN INTO BLDG”).  The NYPD Legal Bureau’s\nPowerPoint presentation at Rodman’s Neck contains a number of examples of\nconcise, easily written descriptions of furtive behavior that could give rise to\nreasonable suspicion.  See Street Encounters Presentation at 22–23.\n371 See id. (listing text strings accompanying checked Other boxes).\n372 In addition, many behaviors that would, like the behaviors\nhypothesized above, lead to a suspicion of trespass would presumably also provide\ngrounds to check “Actions Indicative [o]f ‘Casing’ Victim Or Location” or\n“Actions Indicative of Acting As A Lookout” on Side 1.  See App. B.\n373 See Fagan Report at 11 n.12 (citing Robert J. Sampson & Steven W.\nRaudenbush, Seeing Disorder: Neighborhood Stigma and the Social Construction\nof “Broken Windows”, 67 SOC. PSYCHOL. Q. 319 (2004); Geoffrey P. Alpert, John\nM. MacDonald, & Roger G. Dunham, Police Suspicion and Discretionary\nDecision Making During Citizen Stops, 43 CRIMINOLOGY 407 (2005)).\n113\n\nhas provided evidence of such cognitive distortions.374  Thus the category of\nFurtive Movements may be inherently prone to overuse on UF-250s.  Given the\nnature of their work on patrol, officers may have a systematic tendency to see and\nreport furtive movements where none objectively exist.375  \nDr. Fagan raised further doubts in Floyd regarding the general validity\nof assuming reasonable suspicion based on Furtive Movements.376  Dr. Fagan’s\nreport in Floyd showed that “the arrest rates in stops where the high crime area or\nfurtive movement boxes are checked off is actually below average.”377  Officers\nmay have a tendency to check these boxes when they are unable to articulate any\nother basis for a stop — perhaps because the suspicion leading to the stop was, in\nfact, not reasonable.\nDefendants attack the accuracy of Dr. Fagan’s categorization scheme\n374 See id.  Indeed, this is an area in which further training may be highly\nbeneficial.\n375 See Bayless, 201 F.3d at 133 (“Reasonable suspicion is an objective\nstandard; hence, the subjective intentions or motives of the officer making the stop\nare irrelevant.” (emphasis added)).\n376 See Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 284–85; Fagan Report at 11 n.12 (citing\nDr. Fagan’s report in Floyd).\n377 Floyd, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 285 (emphasis added).\n114\n\nin various ways.378  First, defendants criticize Dr. Fagan for neglecting to factor\ninto his analysis a field on Side 1 of the UF-250 form labeled “Period Of\nObservation Prior To Stop.”379  Though defendants’ reasoning is not explicit, I take\nit they assume that a long enough period of observation, combined with some of\nthe stop factor combinations in Dr. Fagan’s list of unlawful stops, might justify\nremoving a stop from the list.380   Second, defendants’ expert noted a few dozen\ntext strings accompanying the Other box that Dr. Fagan included in his count of\nunlawful stops but that defendants argue could justify a Terry stop.381  For\nexample, Dr. Fagan categorized “RAN INTO BLDG” as an instance of an\nobserved entry into a TAP building, and thus not a basis for a stop.382  Third,\n378 See Def. Findings ¶¶ 6 (“Period of Observation”), 8 (metacategories\nfor “Other” text strings), 9 (“Furtive Movements,”“Ongoing Investigation”).\n379 See id. ¶ 6; App. B.\n380 See Def. Findings ¶ 6.  According to the UF-250 database, in sixty-\nfive percent of the trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx in 2011, the\nPeriod of Observation was less than one minute, and in eighty-four percent of\nthose stops, the period of observation was less than two minutes.  See Period of\nObservation Table.  Only five of the 1,044 unlawful stops identified by Dr. Fagan\ninvolved periods of observation of greater than ten minutes.  See Table 15:\nDistribution of Period of Observation, Pl. Ex. 99.\n381 See Def. Findings ¶ 8; Smith Report at 34–39.  Neither Dr. Smith nor\ndefendants offer a total of the number of stops contested by Dr. Smith in this way. \nPlaintiffs state that Dr. Smith identified thirty-six stops with contestable text\nstrings out of Dr. Fagan’s 1,044.  See Pl. Findings ¶ 12.\n382 See Smith Report at 34–35.\n115\n\ndefendants argue that Dr. Fagan’s list of unlawful stops should not have included\nthe forty-one stops in which an officer marked Furtive Movement on Side 1 and a\nbox on Side 2 labeled “Ongoing Investigations, e.g., Robbery Pattern” (the\n“Ongoing Investigations” box).383\nRather than addressing each of these claims individually, it is enough\nto note that even if the one hundred forty-three stops involving observation periods\nover two minutes, the thirty-six stops with contestable text strings, and the forty-\none stops with both Furtive Movements and Ongoing Investigations marked were\nexcluded from Dr. Fagan’s grand total of 1,044 unlawful stops, the total would still\nshow that out of the 1,663 stops in Dr. Fagan’s revised set of trespass stops outside\nTAP buildings in the Bronx in 2011, over eight hundred (824) were\nunconstitutional.  That is, even if defendants’ arguments on these points are\naccepted — and I am not convinced that they should be — Dr. Fagan’s report\nwould still show that on hundreds of occasions in the Bronx in 2011, people were\nstopped without basis outside of TAP buildings, in violation of their rights under\nthe U.S. Constitution, and required to answer questions from an officer with the\npower to arrest them if they answered incorrectly.  \nThe essential fact, sufficiently established by Dr. Fagan’s analysis\n383 See Def. Findings ¶ 9; App. B.\n116\n\nwhen viewed in combination with the other evidence discussed above, is that a\nvery large number of constitutional violations took place outside TAP buildings in\nthe Bronx in 2011.  Whether the percentage of trespass stops that were\nunconstitutional was thirty or sixty, and whether one assumes that officers failed to\nfill out UF-250s ten, twenty, or fifty percent of the time, plaintiffs have succeeded\nin showing a clear likelihood that they will be able to prove that the City of New\nYork and its agents displayed deliberate indifference toward the violation of the\nconstitutional rights of hundreds and more likely thousands of individuals prior to\n2012. \nv. Notice to Defendants\nBy 2011 city policymakers were on actual notice of a practice of\nunconstitutional trespass stops by city employees outside TAP buildings in the\nBronx.384  As early as 1999, the NYPD Legal Bureau was aware that it was\nunlawful to stop someone simply for entering and exiting a TAP building.385  By\nJuly 2010, as Inspector Sweet testified, the NYPD was on actual notice that\nofficers were unlawfully approaching people entering or inside TAP buildings to\n384 See supra Part IV.B.1.\n385 See 1999 TAP Legal Guidelines at 6; Tr. 10/18 at 684:2–4.\n117\n\nquestion them about their presence.386  The special counsel to Commissioner Kelly\nattended meetings where the problem was discussed.387  In February 2011, a\nnumber of NYPD officials received letters from ADA Rucker on behalf of the\nBronx DA’s office clarifying the unconstitutionality of stopping people merely for\nentering or exiting a TAP building.388  Throughout this period, the NYPD received\ncopies of decline to prosecute forms describing arrests in which officers apparently\nstopped people for no reason other than their proximity to a TAP building.389\nvi. Legal Analysis\nDeliberate indifference is “a stringent standard of fault,”390 especially\nwhen it is based on a failure to train.391  Nevertheless, “deliberate indifference may\nbe inferred where ‘the need for more or better supervision to protect against\nconstitutional violations was obvious,’ but the policymaker ‘fail[ed] to make\n386 See Tr. 10/18 at 648:18–649:16.\n387 See id. at 650:18–651:17.\n388 See id. at 659:20–660:17.\n389 See Tr. 10/16 at 256:8–13.\n390 Connick, 131 S.Ct. at 1360.\n391 See id. at 1359 (citing Tuttle, 471 U.S. at 822–23).\n118\n\nmeaningful efforts to address the risk of harm to plaintiffs[.]’”392\nBased on the conclusions above, plaintiffs have shown a clear\nlikelihood of proving deliberate indifference under any of the prevailing ways of\nframing that standard.  Stated in terms of Connick’s general standard for failure-to-\ntrain claims, plaintiffs have shown a clear likelihood of proving that city\npolicymakers were on actual notice by 2011, and constructive notice prior to then,\nthat the failure to train NYPD officers regarding the legal standard for trespass\nstops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx was causing city employees to violate the\nconstitutional rights of a large number of individuals.393  Stated in terms of the\nthree-part Walker test for deliberate indifference through failure to train, plaintiffs\nhave shown a clear likelihood of proving (1) city policymakers knew to a moral\ncertainty that NYPD officers, who regularly patrol in and around TAP buildings in\nthe Bronx, would confront the question of when it was legally permissible to stop\npeople outside those buildings; (2) the decline to prosecute forms, ADA Rucker’s\nletters, and the hundreds of UF-250 forms that failed to articulate reasonable\nsuspicion for trespass stops outside TAP buildings provided an extensive record of\nNYPD officers mishandling these stops; and (3) when NYPD officers made the\n392 Cash, 654 F.3d at 334 (quoting Reynolds, 506 F.3d at 192; Vann, 72\nF.3d at 1049).\n393 See Connick, 131 S.Ct. at 1359.\n119\n\nwrong choice in these stops, the deprivation of constitutional rights frequently\nresulted.394  Thus, plaintiffs have shown a clear likelihood of proving that city\npolicymakers should have known that their inadequate training and supervision\nregarding trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx was “‘so likely to\nresult in the violation of constitutional rights,’” that their failure to train constituted\ndeliberate indifference.395  Stated in terms of the constructive acquiescence\nstandard, plaintiffs have shown a clear likelihood of proving that there was “a\nsufficiently widespread practice among police officers” of unlawful trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings “to support reasonably the conclusion that such abuse was\nthe custom of the officers,” and that “supervisory personnel must have been aware\nof it but took no adequate corrective or preventive measures.”396  \nIn fact, plaintiffs presented some evidence suggesting that the practice\nof making stops outside TAP buildings without regard for reasonable suspicion\nmight have been “so persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of\nlaw.”397  In addition to the sheer magnitude of apparently unlawful stops, ADA\n394 See Walker, 974 F.2d at 297–98.\n395 Id. at 298 (quoting Canton, 489 U.S. at 390).\n396 Jones, 691 F.3d at 82.\n397 Connick, 131 S.Ct. at 1359. \n120\n\nRucker offered testimony suggesting that prior to her legal research into the\nstandards governing stops outside TAP buildings, she had been explicitly advising\nofficers that it was permissible to stop a person simply because he had exited a\nTAP building, so long as the officer had observed the person in the vestibule\nfirst.398  Even defendants seemed to recognize that the similarities among the stops\ndescribed in this case support the conclusion that officers’ behaviors were the\nresult of uniform training.399\nb. Failure to Rebut Deliberate Indifference Claim Based\non Steps Taken by NYPD in 2012\nDefendants spent a great deal of time at the hearing introducing\nevidence concerning steps the NYPD took in 2012 to improve TAP and provide\ntraining regarding stop and frisk practices.400  Yet in spite of receiving actual notice\nof NYPD officers carrying out widespread constitutional violations outside TAP\nbuildings, and in spite of already being engaged in changes to the TAP program\nand the training related to stop and frisk more generally, the NYPD has failed to\ntake meaningful action to address the specific and narrow problem at issue in this\n398 See Tr. 10/15 at 176:14–23.  \n399 See Def. Findings ¶ 29 n.16 (“Defendants contend that any similarity\nin the interactions [between officers and plaintiffs] demonstrates that officers are\nbeing uniformly trained.”).\n400 See supra Part IV.B.\n121\n\ncase:  the problem of unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the\nBronx.  To date, as noted above, the only piece of instruction that has been\nprovided to officers on a systematic basis and that specifically targets the problem\nat issue in this case is a single bullet point in a single slide show during a single\npart of the Rodman’s Neck training.401  This has been the NYPD’s most\nmeaningful specific response to the problem that caused Charles Bradley’s\nunlawful stop and arrest, Abdullah Turner’s unlawful stop and arrest, the unlawful\nstop of J.G. that led Jaenean Ligon to fear for her son’s life, Roshea Johnson’s stop\nand interrogation in an unmarked NYPD van, all the other indignities that the other\nplaintiffs were obliged to suffer, and the hundreds of other unlawful stops,\nrecorded and unrecorded, whose precise details this Court will never know.  \nThe Rodman’s Neck bullet point is plainly insufficient to rebut\nplaintiffs’ showing of a clear likelihood of success on the merits of their deliberate\nindifference claim.  Nor did defendants provide reliable statistics regarding stops in\n2012 that might have rebutted plaintiffs’ claim.  Defendants have provided no\nevidence that the NYPD has ceased its practice of making unlawful trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings in the Bronx.  \nThe evidence introduced by defendants of broader reforms to TAP\n401 See Street Encounters Presentation at 40; Tr. 10/17 at 572:24–573:6;\nTr. 10/18 at 663:13–664:1.\n122\n\nand stop and frisk undertaken by the NYPD in 2012 also does not rebut plaintiffs’\ncase that city policymakers have displayed deliberate indifference to an ongoing\npractice of constitutional violations by city employees based on unlawful stops\noutside TAP buildings.  To the contrary, many of the training materials introduced\nby defendants may serve to further entrench the problem of these unconstitutional\nstops.  In some cases, defendants’ introduction of training materials not only failed\nto rebut plaintiffs’ case, but made plaintiffs’ case stronger.\nMost strikingly, within the last year the NYPD has produced a video\non stop and frisk that has now been shown in every precinct.402  Chief Shea\ntestified that “it would be fair to say that every single member of a patrol borough\nhas probably” seen the video by now.403  The video, whose script was also entered\ninto evidence, begins by briefly summarizing the four levels of police encounters\nrecognized by New York state courts.  Then the video provides the following\ndescription of what constitutes a stop requiring reasonable suspicion, that is, a\nTerry stop:\nYour  authority  to  conduct  a  Stop  Question  and  Frisk\n402 See Tr. 10/19 at 900:21–904:20; Tr. 10/22 at 942:13–24; SQF\nTraining Video No. 5; Script of SQF Training Video No. 5.\n403 See Tr. 10/22 at 22–24.  Chief Shea also testified that the information\nin the video is “consistent with the training that recruit officers receive at the\nacademy” regarding reasonable suspicion.  See Tr. 10/19 at 904:16–20.\n123\n\nencounter is limited to public places within the City of New York. \n. . .  A forcible stop can take many different forms.  It can be\nconstructive in nature, such as using verbal commands or blocking\na subject’s path.  Or it could be an actual stop, such as grabbing or\nholding the subject.\nThe courts will look to an officer’s actions in making this\ndetermination.  They consider: if the officer’s gun was drawn; if\nthe person was physically prevented from moving; the number\nand tone of verbal commands; the content of the commands; the\nnumber of officers present; and the location of the encounter.\nUsually just verbal commands, such as STOP, POLICE!!!,\nwill not constitute a seizure.  However, a verbal command, plus\nother actions may be considered a seizure — other actions, such\nas: using physical force to subdue a suspect; physically blocking\na suspect’s path; grabbing a suspect by the arm, shirt or coat;\npointing a gun at a suspect; using an ASP or baton to contain a\nsuspect; or placing a suspect against a wall or on the ground.404\nThis misstates the law.  It is incorrect in its specific claim that if an officer yelled\n“STOP, POLICE!!!” and the person stopped, the result would not “[u]sually”\nconstitute a Terry stop.405  Indeed, it is difficult to imagine many contexts in which\n404 Script of SQF Training Video No. 5 at 58–59 (formatting altered),\nbeginning at roughly 6:35 in SQF Training Video No. 5.\n405 Perhaps the video reflects a misunderstanding of the Supreme Court’s\nruling in Hodari D., 499 U.S. at 626–28.  Cf. Def. Findings ¶ 42 n.19 (citing\nHodari D.).  In Hodari D., the Court explained that the word “seizure” “does not\nremotely apply . . . to the prospect of a policeman yelling ‘Stop, in the name of the\nlaw!’ at a fleeing form that continues to flee. That is no seizure.”  Id. at 626.  The\nCourt’s point was that there is no seizure unless the individual is in fact seized, in\nthe sense of being stopped, either by physical force, or by submission to the\nassertion of the officer’s authority — not that a Terry stop requires a display of\nauthority beyond shouted commands.  See Swindle, 407 F.3d at 572 (interpreting\nHodari D.).\n124\n\nan officer shouting this command, followed by the person stopping, would not\nconstitute a Terry stop.  As noted above, the test for a Terry stop is whether “a\nreasonable person would feel free ‘to disregard the police and go about his\nbusiness.’”406  If the “reasonable person” of Fourth Amendment law would feel\nfree to disregard an officer yelling “STOP, POLICE!!!” and go about his business,\nthen this “reasonable person” bears little or no resemblance to the many reasonable\npeople who have been or will be affected by the NYPD’s stop and frisk practices.\nThe video is also incorrect in its more general suggestion that an\nofficer must deploy something resembling physical force or the threat of such force\nin order for an encounter to constitute a stop.  It is true that Terry stops are\nsometimes referred to as “forcible stops.”407  But the test for a Terry stop, again, is\nnot the use of force:  it is whether a “reasonable person” would feel free “‘to\ndisregard the police and go about his business.’”408  The Second Circuit has held,\nfor example, that a stop took place where an officer twice ordered a person to “hold\non a second,” and after the second order the person stopped.409  The Second Circuit\n406 Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434 (quoting Hodari D., 499 U.S. at 628).\n407 See, e.g., Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 328 (1990) (referring to\nTerry stop as “forcible stop”).\n408 Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434 (quoting Hodari D., 499 U.S. at 628). \n409 Simmons, 560 F.3d at 101, 105–06.\n125\n\nalso held that a stop occurred where an officer pointing a spotlight at a person said,\n“What, are you stupid?  Come here.  I want to talk to you,” and then told the\nperson to show his hands.410  In Davis, the City of New York conceded, and I held,\nthat a person was stopped when he encountered an officer in a stairway, the officer\nasked if he lived in the building, the officer asked for his ID, and then the officer\nasked him to step out of the stairwell and into the lobby.411  I also held in Davis that\na person was stopped “when she attempted to walk to the elevator, was told to\n‘come back’ by [an officer], and stopped walking,” because the officer’s “order to\n‘come back’ was an order to stop and [she] obeyed the order.”412\nThe Second Circuit held more than twenty years ago, in a case that\nremains good law, that the following factors are indicative of a “seizure,” which\ncan mean either an arrest or a Terry stop:\nthe  threatening  presence  of  several  officers;  the  display  of  a\nweapon;  the  physical  touching  of  the  person  by  the  officer;\nlanguage or tone indicating that compliance with the officer was\ncompulsory; prolonged retention of a person’s personal effects,\nsuch as airplane tickets or identification; and a request by the\n410 Brown v. City of Oneonta, N.Y., 221 F.3d 329, 340 (2d Cir. 2000).  On\nthe other hand, the court held that where a person encountered two officers in his\ndorm lobby, and the officers asked him to show them his hands, he was not seized. \nSee id. at 341.\n411 See Davis, 2012 WL 4813837, at *5–6.\n412 Id. at *14.\n126\n\nofficer to accompany him to the police station or a police room.413\nBecause the yelled command “STOP, POLICE!!!” contains both language and a\ntone indicating that compliance is compulsory, the NYPD’s video is incorrect to\nsuggest that other actions would usually be required for an encounter to constitute\na Terry stop.  Indeed, some of the “other actions” described by the NYPD’s video\n— “using physical force to subdue a suspect; physically blocking a suspect’s path;\ngrabbing a suspect by the arm, shirt or coat; pointing a gun at a suspect; using an\nASP or baton to contain a suspect; or placing a suspect against a wall or on the\nground”414 — go significantly beyond the level of coercion suggested by the\nSecond Circuit’s list of factors that define a Terry stop.  While any evaluation of\nwhether a Terry stop has taken place requires consideration of the totality of the\ncircumstances, it is clear that the NYPD’s video conflicts with the Second Circuit’s\nguidance:  there is a certain range of conduct that a viewer of the video would\nidentify as insufficiently coercive to constitute a Terry stop, while a reader of the\nSecond Circuit’s list would identify the same conduct as falling squarely within the\nparameters of a Terry stop.\nBy raising the Terry bar above where it was set by the Second Circuit,\n413 United States v. Glover, 957 F.2d 1004, 1008 (2d Cir. 1992) (quoting\nLee, 916 F.2d at 819).\n414 Script of SQF Training Video No. 5 at 58–59.\n127\n\nthe NYPD trains its officers that they do not need reasonable suspicion to engage\nin conduct that the Second Circuit would identify as sufficiently coercive to qualify\nas a Terry stop.  In other words, the NYPD’s video, which was produced in 2012,\nwhich has now been seen by nearly every officer in the patrol bureau, and which\ndefendants continue to present as a sign of their lack of deliberate indifference,415\ntrains officers that it is acceptable to engage in conduct that amounts to a Terry\nstop without reasonable suspicion.  \nThe Chief of Patrol Field Training Unit Program Guide, which is\ndistributed to supervisors in Operation IMPACT,416 also reflects the tendency of\nNYPD training materials to exaggerate how intrusive a police encounter must be in\norder to constitute a Terry stop.  The Guide states that with something less than\nreasonable suspicion,417 an officer may approach a person and engage in “pointed,\ninvasive, and accusatory” questioning that is “intended to elicit an incriminating\nresponse,” and even “ask for permission” to search the person.418  While “[t]he\n415 See Def. Findings ¶ 42.\n416 See Tr. 10/19 at 744:2–6.\n417 Using the language of De Bour Level 2, not Level 3, the Training\nGuide requires a “founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot” in order to\napproach and engage in an encounter of this kind.  See Training Guide at 17.\n418 Id. (emphases omitted).  The Guide clarifies that the officer “may not\ntouch the person, display a weapon, or act in a threatening manner,” but notes that\n128\n\nFourth Amendment does not proscribe all contact between the police and\ncitizens,”419 it is difficult to imagine many circumstances in which a reasonable\nperson being aggressively interrogated by the police regarding suspected criminal\nactivity could feel free “‘to disregard the police and go about his business.’”420  The\nmore realistic outcome would be for the person to assume that if he refused to\nanswer, walked away, gave the wrong answers, or made a false move, serious\nconsequences would follow.421  As Abdullah Turner testified, “I don’t know\nanyone . . . who ever just walked away from a cop in the middle of a\nconversation.”422  Given the high stakes of any encounter in which an officer\ninterrogates someone regarding his suspected criminal activity, it is fanciful to say\nthat a reasonable person would as a rule feel free in the midst of such an\n“[i]f a confronted citizen walks away without answering, the officer may follow to\ncontinue questioning.”  See id. at 17–18.\n419 Delgado, 466 U.S. at 215.\n420 Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434 (quoting Hodari D., 499 U.S. at 628). \n421 Indeed, based on the accounts of stops in the decline to prosecute\nforms, this appears to be an accurate expectation.  See App. A ¶¶ 12, 20, discussed\nbelow.  Moreover, it would not be surprising to learn that based on the experiences\nof their families, friends, and neighbors, the residents of these buildings fully\nappreciate the consequences that will follow if they attempt to walk away from the\npolice during questioning.\n422 Tr. 10/17 at 491:22–23.\n129\n\ninterrogation to “‘terminate the encounter’”423 at will.  \nA lesson on TAP that was added to the Guide in 2012 similarly\nreflects a model of policing in which the investigative questioning of suspects\nroutinely precedes rather than follows reasonable suspicion:\nA uniformed member of the service may not stop (temporarily\ndetain)  a  suspected  trespasser  unless  the  uniformed  member\nreasonably suspects that the person is in the building without\nauthority.  . . .  Some factors which may contribute to “reasonable\nsuspicion”  that  a  person  is  trespassing  .  .  .  are  contradictory\nassertions  made  to  justify  presence  in  the  building  and/or\nassertions  lacking  credibility  made  to  justify  presence  in  the\nbuilding.424\n423 Drayton, 536 U.S. at 202 (quoting Bostick, 501 U.S. at 436).\n424 Training Guide at 65; Tr. 10/19 at 743:6–7.  I recognize that many of\nthe NYPD’s training materials purport to derive from De Bour, as defendants have\nemphasized.  See, e.g., Def. Findings ¶ 42 & n.19.  Because plaintiffs have brought\ntheir case under the Fourth Amendment, and not New York law, Pl. Findings\n¶¶ 64–71, it would lie beyond the scope of this Opinion to make general statements\nregarding the precise relations between the law of De Bour and the case law\ninterpreting the Fourth Amendment.  I note, however, that in theory, De Bour\nshould provide greater protection than the Fourth Amendment by restricting police\naction even in encounters whose level of invasiveness falls below the minimum\nthreshold for Fourth Amendment scrutiny.  See, e.g., De Bour, 40 N.Y.2d at 381\n(prohibiting any investigative encounter, even at Level 1, if it is based on “intent to\nharrass” or “mere whim, caprice, or idle curiosity”). \nSome commentators have expressed skepticism regarding the practical\nvirtues of De Bour’s multi-level analysis.  LaFave questions whether De Bour’s\nmore sophisticated articulation of Terry’s balancing approach is advantageous, or\nis likely to result in “such confusion and uncertainty that neither police nor courts\ncan ascertain with any degree of confidence precisely what it takes to meet any of\nthese standards.”  LAFAVE, SEARCH & SEIZURE § 9.4(e).  Accord Emily J. Sack,\nPolice Approaches and Inquiries on the Streets of New York: The Aftermath of\n130\n\nInstead of reasonable suspicion providing a basis for investigative questioning, the\nNYPD’s training materials suggest that the standard scenario is for investigative\nquestioning to lead to reasonable suspicion.  The NYPD Legal Bureau’s\nPowerPoint presentation at Rodman’s Neck similarly suggests that even when an\nofficer lacks reasonable suspicion for a stop, the officer may not only approach and\nask accusatory questions, but during the encounter may “place [his] hand on [his]\nholstered firearm” or “draw and conceal” his weapon, all without escalating the\nencounter to a Terry stop.425  \nWhat is most troubling about these materials is not the suggestion that\nPeople v. De Bour, 66 N.Y.U. L. REV. 512, 520, 548–53 (1991) (arguing that “the\ncourts routinely conflate the De Bour standards and use inappropriately low levels\nof suspicion to justify police intrusions,” and that “the multitiered structure of the\nDe Bour model allows inadequately justified low-level intrusions to escalate\nquickly into inappropriate forcible stops and arrests”).  See also Anthony G.\nAmsterdam, Perspectives on the Fourth Amendment, 58 MINN. L. REV. 349, 394\n(1974) (a “sliding scale approach” to the Fourth Amendment may “produce more\nslide than scale”).  \nThe NYPD’s training materials may illustrate the risk created by the\nmulti-level doctrine of De Bour.  The mere existence of De Bour Level 2, and the\ninevitable difficulty of clearly distinguishing an encounter on the more intrusive\nend of Level 2 from an encounter on the less intrusive end of Level 3, creates\nproblems of administrability.  In practice, the possibility of classifying a stop as\nLevel 2 or even Level 1 may lead police to perform a large number of stops — in\nthe ordinary sense of the word, but inevitably often in the Terry sense as well —\nwithout the minimal foundation in reasonable suspicion required by the U.S.\nConstitution.\n425 Street Encounters Presentation at 16, 19.\n131\n\ninvestigative questioning might under certain circumstances lawfully precede\nreasonable suspicion, but that it should do so as a matter of course, routinely, as the\nrule rather than the exception.  If the difference between a Terry stop and a less\nintrusive encounter hinges on indefinite factors such as the demeanor and\npositioning of the officers; and if it is safe to assume that officers routinely display\ntheir authority and power through aggressive behavior, as many of the officers did\nin their encounters with plaintiffs in the instant case; then a training program that\ninvites officers to approach large numbers of people and question them without\nreasonable suspicion will inevitably result in frequent Terry stops that lack\nreasonable suspicion, effectively guaranteeing the commission of widespread\nconstitutional violations.  The evidence of numerous unlawful stops at the hearing\nstrengthens the conclusion that the NYPD’s inaccurate training has taught officers\nthe following lesson:  stop and question first, develop reasonable suspicion later.426\nThe NYPD’s training failures may also help to explain why no UF-\n250s were located for any of the plaintiffs in the instant case.  Based on training\n426 I note that the NYPD’s stop practices also appear to conflict with the\nconsidered judgment of the New York State Legislature, which enacted New\nYork’s stop and frisk law.  This law states that without a warrant, “a police officer\nmay stop a person . . . when he reasonably suspects that such person is committing,\nhas committed, or is about to commit” a crime, “and may demand of him his name,\naddress and an explanation of his conduct.”  CPL § 140.50.  In other words, the\nNew York State Legislature envisioned reasonable suspicion preceding the request\nfor a name, address, and purpose.\n132\n\nmaterials like those above, the officers who stopped plaintiffs may very well have\nperceived themselves as not engaged in Terry stops at all, but in something less\nintrusive.  The NYPD Legal Bureau’s PowerPoint presentation at Rodman’s Neck\ncontinues to encourage this belief, and the constitutional violations that will\nnaturally follow from it, by redefining the standards for stops and arrests.  Thus,\nthe final slide on arrests states:  “If you are at probable cause, you have made an\narrest.”427  This is not correct.  If you have arrested someone, you have made an\narrest; whether or not you had probable cause only determines whether the arrest\nwas constitutional.  Similarly, the presentation states:  “When an individual is\nstopped based upon Reasonable Suspicion a UF-250 must be prepared.”428  IO 22\nof 2012 offers a similar message:  “When reasonable suspicion exists, a STOP,\nQUESTION AND FRISK REPORT WORKSHEET shall be prepared . . . .”  Both of\nthese statements are incorrect.  Whether a stop constitutes a Terry stop and thus\nrequires the completion of a UF-250 form does not depend on whether the stop is\nbased on reasonable suspicion, but on whether a reasonable person would have felt\nfree to terminate the encounter.429\n427 Street Encounters Presentation at 37 (capitalization altered).\n428 Id. at 33 (emphasis altered).\n429 See Drayton, 536 U.S. at 202.\n133\n\nIn response to criticisms directed at the NYPD’s training materials,\ndefendants have argued that the materials reflect New York state law, and in\nparticular De Bour and its progeny.430  Defendants assert that “New York Law\napplies” in the instant case.431  But practices that violate the Fourth Amendment\ncannot be saved by proving that they comply with state law.432  To the extent that\nDe Bour suggests a police officer, without reasonable suspicion, may lawfully stop\nand question an individual in such a way that a reasonable person would not feel\nfree to terminate the encounter, that suggestion would be incorrect.\n2. Irreparable Harm\nIn addition to showing a clear likelihood of success on the merits,\nplaintiffs have the burden of showing that they are “likely to suffer irreparable\nharm in the absence of preliminary relief.”433  Plaintiffs have moved for class\n430 See, e.g., Def. Findings ¶ 42 & n.19.\n431 Id.\n432 As I noted in the Introduction, the Supreme Court held in Sibron that\n“New York is, of course, free to develop its own law of search and seizure to meet\nthe needs of local law enforcement.  . . .  It may not, however, authorize police\nconduct which trenches upon Fourth Amendment rights, regardless of the labels\nwhich it attaches to such conduct.”  392 U.S. at 60–61.  Sibron makes clear that\nany conflict between the Fourth Amendment and New York state law must be\nresolved in favor of the Fourth Amendment.\n433 Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.\n134\n\ncertification in connection with their motion for a preliminary injunction. \nPlaintiffs’ putative class is “comprised of individuals who have been or are at risk\nof being subjected to the New York City Police Department’s practice of stopping\nindividuals outside of buildings enrolled in Operation Clean Halls in the Bronx on\nsuspicion of trespassing inside those buildings.”434 \nWhile I have not yet ruled on plaintiffs’ motion, “[i]t is well\nestablished that ‘[c]ertain circumstances give rise to the need for prompt injunctive\nrelief for a named plaintiff or on behalf of a class’ and that the ‘court may\nconditionally certify the class or otherwise award a broad preliminary injunction,\nwithout a formal class ruling, under its general equity powers.’”435  Based on the\nconclusions in the preceding section, the putative class in this case is threatened\nwith imminent violations of their constitutional rights in the absence of preliminary\nrelief.436  The frequency of unconstitutional trespass stops outside Clean Halls\nbuildings reflected in the decline to prosecute forms and Dr. Fagan’s report\n434 Class Mem. at 1.\n435 Strouchler v.

Because\n“[t]he violation of a constitutional right . . . constitutes irreparable harm for the\npurpose of a preliminary injunction,”437  plaintiffs have carried their burden of\nshowing likely irreparable harm on behalf of the putative class.\n3. Balance of Equities\nIn order to qualify for a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs must show\n“that the balance of equities tips in [their] favor.”438  Given that a preliminary\ninjunction is “‘an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right,’”439 it would be\ninappropriate to award such an injunction if doing so would result in an\narrangement less fair to the parties than the status quo, such as an arrangement in\nwhich the hardship imposed on one party outweighed the benefit to the other. \n“[T]he Court should ‘balanc[e] . . . the equities to reach an appropriate result\nprotective of the interests of both parties.’”440\n437 Ligon, 2012 WL 3597066, at *1 (citing Johnson v.

It is partly out of concern for defendants’\nhardships that I have rejected some of plaintiffs’ proposed remedies.441  \nNevertheless, the burden on putative class members of continued unconstitutional\nstops goes far beyond administrative inconvenience.  As I stated in Floyd:  \nThe right to physical liberty has long been at the core of our\nnation’s commitment to respecting the autonomy and dignity of\neach person:  “No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully\nguarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to\nthe  possession  and  control  of  his  own  person,  free  from  all\nrestraint  or  interference  of  others,  unless  by  clear  and\nunquestionable authority of law.”442\nEliminating the threat that the kinds of stops described by plaintiffs might occur at\nany moment, without legal justification, in the vicinity of one’s home and the\nhomes of one’s friends and family, is itself an important interest deserving of\njudicial protection.\nEqually important are the potential consequences of an unlawful stop. \nThe stakes of “field interrogation”443 by the police have dramatically risen since\nTerry was decided in 1968.  The use of incarceration has increased, sentences have\n441 See Pl. Findings ¶¶ 73–75.\n442 Floyd, 283 F.R.D. at 158–59 (quoting Union Pac. R. Co. v. Botsford,\n141 U.S. 250, 251 (1891)).\n443 Terry, 392 U.S. at 12, 14.\n137\n\ngrown, the threat of lengthy incarceration has created new incentives to plead\nguilty, and the collateral consequences of a conviction — on employment, housing,\naccess to government programs, and even the right to vote or serve on a jury —\nhave become more common and more severe.  If an unjustified stop happens to\nlead to an unjustified arrest for trespassing, as it did in Charles Bradley’s case, not\nevery overburdened public defender will have the wherewithal to obtain a\nnotarized letter from the defendant’s host explaining that the defendant was\ninvited, as Bronx Defender Cara Suvall did on behalf of Bradley.444  When\nconsidering the relative hardships faced by the parties, it is important to consider\nthe potentially dire and long-lasting consequences that can follow from\nunconstitutional stops.445\n444 See Tr. 10/16 at 269:2–9; Rappa Letter.\n445 Though it is unnecessary to reach the issue in this Opinion, I note that\nthe appropriate form of Fourth Amendment analysis may differ depending on the\nquantity and nature of stops being scrutinized, and the remedies available.  Not\nonly are the consequences of stops different today than they were in 1968, but the\nfrequency of stops is far higher as well.  See Floyd, 283 F.R.D. at 159 (over 2.8\nmillion stops by NYPD between 2004 and 2009).  As the stops have increased in\nfrequency, they have also become more standardized and predictable.  In Terry, the\nSupreme Court emphasized “the myriad daily situations in which policemen and\ncitizens confront each other on the street.”  Terry, 392 U.S. at 12.  “No judicial\nopinion can comprehend the protean variety of the street encounter, and we can\nonly judge the facts of the case before us.”  Id. at 15.  In the instant case, by\ncontrast, the contested police encounters are strikingly uniform.  The stops in the\ndecline to prosecute forms echo the stops of plaintiffs, which in turn echo aspects\nof the training materials introduced at the hearing.  See, e.g., IO 22 of 2012 at 2\n138\n\nWeighing the equities in light of the totality of the circumstances, the\nadministrative burdens that defendants will face in revising the NYPD’s policies\nand training materials are real, but are outweighed by plaintiffs’ interest in not\nbeing subjected to unconstitutional stops outside their homes and the homes of\ntheir family and friends.\n4. Public Interest\nAny preliminary injunction must be “in the public interest.”446  Courts\n(¶ 11).  Terry envisions street stops as uniquely tailored to unforeseen\ncircumstances.  The stops in the instant case are more like the products of fixed,\nrepeatable processes.  The NYPD training materials that teach these processes can\nbe scrutinized in ways that an individual officer’s discretionary act cannot. \nBecause of this, a different constitutional analysis may be appropriate. \nIn addition, the constitutional framework for the ex post evaluation of\nhighly individualized, discretionary stops, where exclusion is the only remedy,\nmay not be appropriate to the ex ante evaluation of routinized, highly scripted,\nlargely predictable stops, where the remedy can involve changes in training. \nUltimately, “the central inquiry under the Fourth Amendment” is “the\nreasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of\na citizen’s personal security.”  Terry, 392 U.S. at 19.  An invasion of privacy that is\nreasonable when it occurs on an ad hoc basis and is weighed in the context of the\nexclusionary rule may not be reasonable when it occurs as a matter of\nprogrammatic policy on a far larger scale. \nTerry itself seems to invite scrutiny of stops falling below the\nintrusiveness of Terry stops, provided that the remedies applied are less severe than\nthe exclusion of evidence.  “[O]f course, our approval of legitimate and restrained\ninvestigative conduct undertaken on the basis of ample factual justification should\nin no way discourage the employment of other remedies than the exclusionary rule\nto curtail abuses for which that sanction may prove inappropriate.”  Terry, 392\nU.S. at 15.\n446 Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.\n139\n\nhave no special institutional competence in determining what the public interest is,\nand the parties presented little evidence at the hearing directly addressing this\nissue.  Nevertheless, the public interests at issue in plaintiffs’ motion are familiar\nfrom a long line of cases concerning “the power of the police to ‘stop and frisk’ . . .\nsuspicious persons.”447  In these cases, there is a recurring conflict between liberty\nand dignity on the one hand, and safety on the other.448  \nBecause any member of the public could conceivably find herself\noutside a TAP building in the Bronx, the public at large has a liberty and dignity\ninterest in bringing an end to the practice of unconstitutional stops at issue in this\ncase.  Even if the constitutional violations described by plaintiffs were confined to\nthe members of a discrete community, the public has a clear interest in protecting\nthe constitutional rights of all its members.  At the same time, enforcing\nconstitutional restrictions on the NYPD’s ability to stop and potentially frisk\npeople outside TAP buildings could conceivably inhibit the NYPD’s ability to\nprovide security to the residents of those buildings and their communities.\nIn light of these considerations, and taking account of all the evidence\npresented at the hearing, I find that the public interest lies with the enforcement of\n447 Terry, 392 U.S. at 10.\n448 See Davis, 2012 WL 4813837, at *1.\n140\n\nthe Constitution.  It is “‘clear and plain’”449 that the public interest in liberty and\ndignity under the Fourth Amendment trumps whatever modicum of added safety\nmight theoretically be gained from the NYPD making unconstitutional trespass\nstops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx.  I am not ordering the abolition or even\na reduction of TAP, which appears to be a valuable way of using the NYPD’s\nresources to enhance the security in voluntarily enrolled private buildings.450  My\nruling today is directed squarely at a category of stops lacking reasonable\nsuspicion.  Precisely because these stops lack rational justification, they are\npresumably of less value to public safety than would be the stops of individuals\nwho displayed objectively suspicious behavior.\nC. Appropriate Scope of Injunctive Relief\nInjunctive relief “‘should be narrowly tailored to fit specific legal\nviolations.’”451  In addition, “great[] caution is appropriate where a federal court is\nasked to interfere by means of injunctive relief with a state’s executive functions, a\n449 Reynolds, 506 F.3d at 198 (quoting Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 378\n(1976)).\n450 See, e.g., Tr. 10/18 at 593:15–594:3 (testimony of landlord to the\nadvantages of enrollment in Operation Clean Halls).\n451 Patsy’s Ital. Res., Inc. v. Banas, 658 F.3d 254, 272 (2d Cir. 2011)\n(quoting Patsy’s Brand, Inc. v. I.O.B. Realty, Inc., 317 F.3d 209, 220 (2d Cir.\n2003)).  Accord City of New York v.

As I stated in Floyd, safeguarding the liberties guaranteed under\nthe Fourth Amendment “is quintessentially the role of the judicial branch.”454  \nIn light of these considerations, as well as the findings of fact and\nconclusions of law detailed above, I impose the following preliminary relief:\n1. Immediate Relief\n452 Reynolds, 506 F.3d at 198.\n453 Some recent scholarship has argued that the NYPD’s stop and frisk\nprogram may be partly responsible for the decline in crime in New York City in\nrecent decades.  See FRANKLIN E. ZIMRING, THE CITY THAT BECAME SAFE: NEW\nYORK’S LESSONS FOR URBAN CRIME AND ITS CONTROL (2011).  The issue in this\ncase, however, is not whether trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx\nare effective at reducing crime, but whether they are constitutional.  No matter how\neffective a police practice may be, if it violates the Fourth Amendment, the\nConstitution requires the government to find other means of achieving its goals. \nFor example, while preventive detention might be an effective law enforcement\ntool, police departments are not allowed to employ it, because doing so would\nviolate the Constitution.\n454 Floyd, 283 F.R.D. at 159.\n142\n\nThe NYPD is ordered immediately to cease performing trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings in the Bronx without reasonable suspicion of trespass, in\naccordance with the law as set forth and clarified in this Opinion.455  To\nsummarize:  as the Fourth Amendment has been interpreted by the U.S. Supreme\nCourt and the Second Circuit, an encounter between a police officer and a civilian\nconstitutes a Terry stop whenever a reasonable person would not feel free to\n“‘terminate the encounter.’”456  The stops in this case illustrate that the threat or use\nof force is not a necessary or even typical element of Terry stops.  Encounters\ninvolving nothing more than commands or accusatory questioning can and\nroutinely do rise to the level of Terry stops, provided that the commands and\nquestioning would lead a reasonable person to conclude he was not free to\n455 Defendants appear to believe that an order prohibiting stops outside\nTAP buildings that lack reasonable suspicion is “a simple command that the\ndefendant obey the law,” and thus is not legally cognizable.  See Def. Findings ¶ 54\nn.21 (quoting S.C. Johnson, Inc. v. Clorox Co., 241 F.3d 232, 240 (2d Cir. 2001)\n(interpreting Rule 65(d)).  But as I stated prior to the preliminary injunction\nhearing, “the City misapprehends the purpose of Rule 65.”  Ligon, 2012 WL\n3597066, at *3–4.   Cases like S.C. Johnson do not prohibit courts from ordering\nparties to obey the law, but rather require that such orders be specific and clear. \nSee S.C. Johnson, 241 F.3d at 240.  “[A]n injunction must ‘be specific and definite\nenough to apprise those within its scope of the conduct that is being proscribed.’” \nId. at 240–41.  The immediate relief ordered here is specific, clear, and necessary\nto correct the misconceptions of NYPD officers that led to the violations of\nconstitutional rights at issue in this case.\n456 Drayton, 536 U.S. at 202 (quoting Bostick, 501 U.S. at 436).\n143\n\nterminate the encounter.\nIn order for an officer to have “reasonable suspicion” that an\nindividual is engaged in criminal trespass, the officer must be able to articulate\nfacts providing “a minimal level of objective justification for making the stop,”457\nwhich means “something more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or\nhunch.’”458  In particular, an individual observed exiting or entering and exiting a\nTAP building does not establish reasonable suspicion of trespass, even if the\nbuilding is located in a high crime area, and regardless of the time of day.  For the\nreasons described above, “furtive movement” is a problematic basis for a trespass\nstop, especially when it is offered as a stand-alone justification.  If an officer is\nunable to articulate anything more specific than that a person displayed “furtive\nmovement,” including anything about the person’s furtive movement that\nsuggested trespass, then the statement that a person displayed “furtive movement”\nis nothing more than an unparticularized suspicion or hunch, and does not\nconstitute reasonable suspicion.\n2. Proposed Additional Relief\nIn addition to the immediate relief ordered above, I propose to enter\n457 Wardlow, 528 U.S. at 123.\n458 White, 496 U.S. at 329 (quoting Sokolow, 490 U.S. at 7) (certain\nquotation marks omitted).\n144\n\nthe preliminary relief described under the following subheadings.  I present this\nrelief as a proposal for two reasons.  First, the parties in Ligon had little\nopportunity to argue and present evidence at the preliminary injunction hearing\nconcerning the appropriate scope of relief.  Second, the preliminary relief I propose\nis similar though not identical to the relief sought by plaintiffs in the Floyd action,\nwhere I have already certified a city-wide class of plaintiffs alleging that they have\nor will be victims of unconstitutional stops.  Floyd is scheduled for trial on March\n11, 2013.  As part of the proof in that case, plaintiffs intend to present evidence\nregarding the remedies they seek.  \nBecause of the rapidly approaching trial date in Floyd and the\ninefficiency of hearing separate arguments regarding the closely related remedies\nat issue in Ligon and Floyd, I am ordering the consolidation of the remedies\nhearing in the instant case with the remedies portion of the Floyd trial.  Thus, the\nrelief proposed under the subheadings below will not take effect until the parties in\nthis case have had the opportunity to participate in a hearing at which they may\npresent evidence or argument as to whether the proposed relief is insufficient or\ntoo burdensome or otherwise inappropriate, as well as regarding the appropriate\ntimeline for relief.  This remedy hearing will be held in conjunction with the Floyd\n145\n\ntrial, following the phase of the trial dealing with proof of liability.459  Plaintiffs’\ncounsel in Ligon and Floyd must coordinate their presentations with respect to\nappropriate remedies.460  Submissions by counsel in Ligon related solely to\nremedies must be filed no later than February 22, 2013, and may not exceed\ntwenty-five pages per side.\na.  Policies and Procedures \nThe NYPD is ordered to develop and adopt a formal written policy\nspecifying the limited circumstances in which it is legally permissible to stop a\nperson outside a TAP building on a suspicion of trespass.  The policy must reflect\nthe fact that trespass stops outside TAP buildings are governed not only by New\nYork state law, but by the Fourth Amendment.  Guidance in drafting this policy\nshould be drawn from the legal discussion found in this Opinion.\n459 I emphasize that this ruling should in no way be taken to indicate that\nI have already concluded that plaintiffs will prevail in Floyd.  The evidence\npresented by both sides in Floyd will be judged on its own merits.  While the\nApplicable Law section of this Opinion — see supra Part III — certainly applies to\nissues raised in Floyd, the Findings of Fact section does not.  As I have noted\nthroughout this Opinion, this case relates solely to trespass stops outside of TAP\nbuildings in the Bronx.  It is only because of the unavoidable overlap between the\nsteps that are necessary to address plaintiffs’ harms in the instant case, and the\nsteps that would be necessary to address plaintiffs’ harms in Floyd if plaintiffs\nprevailed there, that I am ordering the consolidation of the remedies presentations.\n460 In the interests of efficiency, counsel in Floyd and Ligon are also\npermitted, but not required, to invite the participation of counsel in Davis in the\npresentation on appropriate remedies.\n146\n\nA draft of the written policy governing trespass stops outside TAP\nbuildings shall be provided to the Court (or a monitor appointed by the Court) for\napproval prior to distribution, with a copy to plaintiffs’ counsel.\nb.  Supervision\nFirst, the City is ordered to take all necessary steps to ensure that UF-\n250s are completed for every trespass stop outside a TAP building in the Bronx. \nAgain, a “stop” in the relevant sense is defined as any police encounter in which a\nreasonable person would not feel free to terminate the encounter.\nSecond, the City is ordered to implement a system of review modeled\non the one ordered by Chief Hall in paragraph 3 of Exhibit E.  Supervisory\npersonnel in each Bronx precinct must review, on a quarterly basis, each UF-250\ncompleted for a trespass stop outside a TAP building in the Bronx.  To the extent\nthat such review reveals nonconformity with the formal written policy described\nabove, the City will take specific steps to retrain the officer.  The results of these\nreviews and any retraining will be periodically reported to the relevant precinct\ncommander, a designated member of the Bronx Borough Command, a designated\nmember of the Chief of Patrol’s Office, and plaintiffs’ counsel.  Copies of all\nreviewed UF-250s shall be provided to plaintiffs’ counsel.\nc. Training\n147\n\nThe City is ordered to revise the NYPD’s training materials and\ntraining programs to conform with the law as set forth in this Opinion.  The\ninstruction must be sufficient to uproot the longstanding misconceptions that have\nafflicted TAP in the Bronx.  It must include, but need not be limited to, the\nfollowing reforms:  (1) The formal written policy governing trespass stops outside\nTAP buildings, described above, must be distributed to each Bronx NYPD\nmember, and then redistributed two additional times at six-month intervals. \n(2) The stop and frisk refresher course at Rodman’s Neck must be altered to\nincorporate instruction specifically targeting the problem of unconstitutional\ntrespass stops outside TAP buildings.  Whether the instruction includes additional\nslides, role-playing, or exams, it must be sufficient to convey to all officers who\nattend the course that reasonable suspicion of trespass is required before making a\ntrespass stop outside a TAP building.  Training regarding these stops must also be\nprovided to new recruits and to officers who have already attended the Rodman’s\nNeck refresher course and are not scheduled to do so again.  (3) Chapter 16 of the\nChief of Patrol Field Training Guide must be revised to reflect the formal written\npolicy governing trespass stops outside TAP buildings described above.  (4) SQF\nTraining Video No. 5 must be revised to conform with the law as set forth in this\nOpinion.  I recognize that this step, like some of the others above, will involve\n148\n\nalterations to training materials used outside the Bronx and outside the context of\nTAP.  But such steps are necessary to correct the longstanding misconceptions that\nled to the violations of plaintiffs’ constitutional rights described in this Opinion.\nDrafts of the written or scripted training materials described above\nshall be provided to the Court (or a monitor appointed by the Court) for approval\nprior to use, with a copy to plaintiffs’ counsel.\nd. Attorneys’ Fees\nReasonable attorneys’ fees and costs will be rewarded as appropriate,\non application.\nIn closing, I stress that my conclusions in this Opinion are based on\nthe limited evidence presented at the preliminary injunction hearing.  It could be\nthe case that the development and implementation of IOs 22 and 23 of 2012, as\nwell as the changes to NYPD training in 2012, have resolved the problem of\nunconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx.  Because these\nchanges were so recent, however, and so late in the two-decade history of TAP,\nthey were insufficient to rebut plaintiffs’ evidence at the hearing of defendants’\ndeliberate indifference to a practice of unconstitutional stops.  At any time that\ndefendants develop persuasive evidence, supported by reliable statistics, that\nunconstitutional trespass stops are no longer taking place outside TAP buildings in\n149\n\nthe Bronx, defendants may move for the dissolution of this preliminary injunction \nand the proposed relief. \nVI.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons explained above, plaintiffs' motion is granted, \nalthough the full extent of the relief has not yet been determined.461  No action is \nrequired by the Clerk of the Court, because plaintiffs' motion has already been \nclosed. \nDated:  February 14,2013 \nNew York, New York \nSubsequent to the publication of the original version of this Opinion \n461 \non January 8, 2013, I stayed the immediately ordered relief granted above.  See \nLigon v.  City ofNew York, No. 12 Civ. 2274, 2013 WL 227654 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, \n2013).  The pUblication of this Amended Opinion does not have the effect of lifting \nthe stay. \n150 \n\nAPPENDIX A\nExcerpts from Decline to Prosecute Affidavits:\n1. The Arresting Officer observed the defendant exit the lobby of . . . a Clean\nHalls Apartment Building, and asked defendant, why were you in the building? \nDefendant stated in sum and substance:  VISITING A FRIEND.  The Arresting\nOfficer then observed defendant to have a white powdery substance on his nose . . .\nhowever, the amount was too small to field test or recover.\nThe Arresting Officer arrested Defendant and charged him with violating\nNew York State Penal Law section 140.15 (Criminal Trespass).  However, the\nArresting Officer failed to ask defendant [redacted] you know anyone in the\nbuilding; if so, what is the person’s name and apartment number.\n2. [T]he defendants were observed exiting a clean halls building.  The\ndefendants stated that they were there to visit a tenant . . . .

Defendants entered . . . a clean halls building, and exited.  Defendant was\nstopped outside of the location.  When the arresting officer questioned the\ndefendant, defendant stated, in sum and substance, I’M JUST CHILLING. \nDefendant did not admit that he was in the location.  [The defendant was then\narrested for trespass.]\n6.

[Another officer] entered the building to investigate further,\nhowever, the arresting officer was unable to articulate how [the other officer]\ndisproved [the speaking defendant’s] claim.  [Both defendants were arrested for\ntrespass.]\n9. Police Officer . . . observed the defendant exiting the lobby of . . . a Clean\nHalls Apartment Building and asked defendant whether he lived in the building\nand defendant stated in sum and substance: NO.  [The officer] then asked the\ndefendant, were you visiting anyone in the building, and defendant stated in sum\nand substance: YES.

[A struggle ensued, and the defendant was then arrested in part for\ntrespass.]\n13. [T]he defendants entered a Clean Halls building, stayed there approximately\nfive minutes, and then left.  The arresting officer stopped the defendants and asked\nthem where they were coming from.  The defendants replied, in sum and\nsubstance, WE’RE COMING FROM . . .

The Arresting Officer then asked the\ndefendant, What’s your friend’s name?  What apartment does your friend live in?,\ndefendant stated in sum and substance:  I DON’T KNOW HIS NAME.  HE’S IN\n[redacted].  The Arresting Officer went to [redacted] however, the apartment was\nunoccupied, and as a result, the Arresting Officer was unable to locate anyone who\n153\n\ncould verify defendant’s claim.

SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.: \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nIn an Opinion issued today 1 found the City of New York liable in the Floyd case \nfor violating the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the plaintiff class because of the \nway the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") has conducted stops and frisks over the \npast decade (the \"Liability Opinion\").  In an Opinion issued in January 2013, I found that the \nLigon plaintiffs, representing a putative class of people stopped outside buildings participating in \n1 \n\n\nthe Trespass Affidavit Program (“TAP”) in the Bronx, were entitled to preliminary injunctive\nrelief based on violations of their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nThe purpose of this Opinion (the “Remedies Opinion”) is to determine what\nremedies are appropriate in these cases.  I address both cases in one Opinion because the\nremedies necessarily overlap.  Each requires that the NYPD reform practices and policies related\nto stop and frisk to conform with the requirements of the United States Constitution.  I stress, at\nthe outset, that the remedies imposed in this Opinion are as narrow and targeted as possible.  To\nbe very clear: I am not ordering an end to the practice of stop and frisk.  The purpose of the\nremedies addressed in this Opinion is to ensure that the practice is carried out in a manner that\nprotects the rights and liberties of all New Yorkers, while still providing much needed police\nprotection.\nII. REMEDIES IN FLOYD\nA. The Court Has the Power to Order Broad Equitable Relief\n1. Plaintiffs Satisfied the Requirements for a Permanent Injunction\nPlaintiffs seeking a permanent injunction must demonstrate: (1) that they have\nsuffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are\ninadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between\nthe plaintiffs and the defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest\nwould not be disserved by a permanent injunction.1  Plaintiffs may satisfy the first two factors by\ndemonstrating that they are likely to be deprived of their constitutional rights in the future by the\n1 See World Wide Polymers, Inc. v. Shinkong Synthetic Fibers Corp., 694 F.3d 155,\n160–61 (2d Cir. 2012) (citing eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006)).\n2\n\nacts they seek to have enjoined.2  The evidence discussed in the Liability Opinion shows that\nplaintiffs have suffered violations of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and that the\nprevalence of the practices leading to those violations creates a likelihood of future injury.3 \nThus, plaintiffs have satisfied the first two requirements for obtaining permanent injunctive\nrelief.\nThe balance of hardships tilts strongly in favor of granting a permanent injunction\nin Floyd.  That is, the burden on the plaintiff class of continued unconstitutional stops and frisks\nfar outweighs the administrative hardships that the NYPD will face in correcting its\nunconstitutional practices.4\nThe right to physical liberty has long been at the core of our nation’s\ncommitment to respecting the autonomy and dignity of each person:  “No\nright is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law,\nthan the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own\nperson, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and\nunquestionable authority of law.”5\n2 See New York State Nat’l Org. for Women v. Terry, 886 F.2d 1339, 1362 (2d Cir.\n1989) (deprivation of constitutional rights “cannot be compensated by money damages”); New\nYork Magazine v. Metropolitan Transp. Auth., 136 F.3d 123, 127 (2d Cir. 1998) (the “‘loss of\nFirst Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury’” (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976))).\n3 See Liability Opinion at Part V (conclusions of law); Floyd v. City of New York,\n283 F.R.D. 153, 170 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (citing National Cong. for Puerto Rican Rights, by Perez\nv. City of New York, 75 F. Supp. 2d 154, 161 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (later renamed Daniels)).  See also\nFloyd, 283 F.R.D. at 160, 178 (certifying plaintiffs’ class).\n4 See Association of Surrogates & Supreme Court Reporters Within City of New\nYork v. State of New York, 966 F.2d 75, 79, modified on reh’g, 969 F.2d 1416 (2d Cir. 1992)\n(noting that “state budgetary processes may not trump court-ordered measures necessary to undo\na federal constitutional violation,” provided that the equitable relief is proportional to the\nconstitutional infraction).\n5 Floyd, 283 F.R.D. at 158–59 (quoting Union Pac. R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S.\n250, 251 (1891)).\n3\n\nEnsuring that people are not seized and searched by the police on the streets of New York City\nwithout a legal basis is an important interest meriting judicial protection.\nEliminating the threat that blacks and Hispanics will be targeted for stops and\nfrisks is also an important interest.  In addition to the significant intrusion on liberty that results\nfrom any stop, increased contact with the police leads to increased opportunities for arrest, even\nwhen the reason for the arrest was not the reason for the stop.  As a result, targeting racially\ndefined groups for stops —  even when there is reasonable suspicion —  perpetuates the\nstubborn racial disparities in our criminal justice system.6  Although the costs of complying with\nthe permanent injunction in Floyd will be significant, they are clearly outweighed by the urgent\nneed to curb the constitutional abuses described in the Liability Opinion.\nWith regard to the public interest, the City has expressed concern that interference\nin the NYPD’s stop and frisk practices may have a detrimental effect on crime control.7 \nHowever, as previously noted, I am not ordering an end to stop and frisk.  Moreover, it has been\nwidely reported that as the number of recorded stops has decreased over the past year, the crime\n6 See, e.g., MICHELLE ALEXANDER, THE NEW JIM CROW 6–7 (2010) (“No other\ncountry in the world imprisons so many of its racial or ethnic minorities. . . .  In Washington,\nD.C., . . . it is estimated that three out of four young black men (and nearly all those in the\npoorest neighborhoods) can expect to serve time in prison.”).  Another collateral consequence of\nstops was highlighted in the recently settled case of Lino v. City of New York, No. 106579/10,\n2011 WL 2610501 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Co. June 24, 2011), in which the NYPD agreed to purge\npersonal information from its stop database.  Plaintiffs — including named plaintiff Clive Lino\n— had alleged that the NYPD was using personal information from the stop database to conduct\ncriminal investigations.  See John Caher, NYPD Agrees to Purge Stop-Frisk Databank, N.Y. L.J.,\nAugust 8, 2013. \n7 See 4/11/13 Defendant[’s] Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs’\nRequested Injunctive Relief (“Def. Inj. Mem.”) at 17–18.\n4\n\nrate has continued to fall.8  The United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has pointed out that\n“there is significant evidence that unlawfully aggressive police tactics are not only unnecessary\nfor effective policing, but are in fact detrimental to the mission of crime reduction.”9  By strictly\nadhering to the rule of law, the NYPD will achieve greater cooperation between police officers\nand the communities they serve.  Fostering trust in the police will “promote, rather than hinder,\n[the] NYPD’s mission of safely and effectively fighting crime.”10\nFurthermore, as in Ligon, it is “‘clear and plain’” that the public interest in liberty\nand dignity under the Fourth Amendment, and the public interest in equality under the\nFourteenth Amendment, trumps whatever modicum of added safety might theoretically be\ngained by the NYPD making unconstitutional stops and frisks.11  This Opinion does not call for\nthe NYPD to abandon proactive policing and return to an earlier era of less effective police\npractices.  Rather, the relief ordered below requires the NYPD to be even more proactive: \n8  See, e.g., Tamer El-Ghobashy & Michael Howard Saul, New York Police Use of\nStop-and-Frisk Drops: Plummet in Disputed Tactic Tracks Overall Decrease in Crime, WALL\nST.

I note,\nhowever, that the number of unrecorded stops may have increased over the same period as a\nresult of misleading training at the NYPD’s new stop and frisk refresher course at Rodman’s\nNeck.

The Court’s Broad Authority to Enter Injunctive Relief\n“[T]he scope of a district court’s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is\nbroad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.”12  At the same time, it is\n“‘the essence of equity jurisdiction’ that a court is only empowered ‘to grant relief no broader\nthan necessary to cure the effects of the harm caused by the violation.’”13  “Discretion to frame\nequitable relief is limited by considerations of federalism, and remedies that intrude\nunnecessarily on a state’s governance of its own affairs should be avoided.”14  \nNevertheless, as the DOJ notes, “courts have long recognized — across a wide\nrange of institutional settings — that equity often requires the implementation of injunctive relief\nto correct unconstitutional conduct, even where that relief relates to a state’s administrative\npractices.”15  “Courts . . . must not shrink from their obligation to enforce the constitutional\n12 Swann v.

The\nDOJ counters that if individual suits were an effective remedy for police misconduct, courts\nwould not have found it necessary to impose injunctive relief in so many police misconduct\ncases.  See DOJ Inj. Mem. at 9 & n.5 (also citing arguments from Daryl J. Levinson, Making\nGovernment Pay: Markets, Politics, and the Allocation of Constitutional Costs, 67 U. CHI. L.\nREV. 345, 354–57 (2000)).  I note that individual suits for damages are particularly ineffective as\na remedy for unconstitutional stops, where individuals often do not know what the basis for their\nstop was, and thus cannot know whether the stop lacked a legal basis or was influenced\nimproperly by race.  In addition, while the indignity of an unconstitutional stop is a serious harm,\nfew of those stopped will be motivated to dedicate their time and resources to filing a lawsuit —\nespecially where the standard for recovery may require proof of Monell liability.\n22 See, e.g., Bailey v. City of Philadelphia, No. 10 Civ. 5952 (E.D. Pa. June 21,\n2011) (consent decree in class action alleging unconstitutional stops and frisks of black and\nHispanic men); DOJ Inj. Mem. at 9 (noting DOJ settlement agreements and consent decrees with\ndozens of law enforcement agencies nationwide).  The City’s resistance to reform in this case\nmay reflect a more general skepticism toward judicial interpretation of the Constitution and the\nlimits it imposes on municipalities.  See, e.g., Jill Colvin, Bloomberg Says Interpretation of\nConstitution Will “Have to Change” After Boston Bombing, POLITICKER (Apr. 22, 2013).\n23 Fed. R. Civ.

Thus, while the sections below refer to NYPD documents\nthat must be revised, the ordered relief is contained entirely within the four corners of this\nOpinion.27\n1. Appointment of a Monitor to Oversee Reforms\nBecause of the complexity of the reforms that will be required to bring the\nNYPD’s stop and frisk practices into compliance with the Constitution, it would be impractical\nfor this Court to engage in direct oversight of the reforms.  As a more effective and flexible\nalternative, I am appointing an independent monitor (the “Monitor”) to oversee the reform\nprocess.  I have chosen Peter L. Zimroth to serve as Monitor.\nMr. Zimroth, a partner in the New York office of Arnold & Porter, LLP, is a\n24 Mickalis Pawn Shop, 645 F.3d at 143 (quoting Schmidt v.

In both of these roles, Mr. Zimroth worked closely with the\nNYPD.  A graduate of Columbia University and Yale Law School — where he served as Editor\nin Chief of the Yale Law Journal — he also served as a law clerk on the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States and a federal prosecutor.  He taught criminal law and criminal procedure as a\ntenured professor at the New York University School of Law.  \nMr. Zimroth has also been appointed to many positions in public service.  The\nChief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals appointed him as one of three directors of New\nYork’s Capital Defender Office.  He has also served on the Mayor’s Committee on the Judiciary,\nand on the boards of two schools for children with special needs.  He has been a member of the\nHouse of Delegates of the American Bar Association, the Executive Committee of the New York\nCity Bar Association, and the Board of Directors of the Legal Aid Society.\nIt is within the power of a district court to order the appointment of a monitor to\noversee judicially ordered reforms.28  The DOJ recommended the appointment of a monitor in\nthis case, in the event that the Court found the City liable.  Based on “decades of police reform\nefforts across the country,” the DOJ concluded that “the appointment of a monitor to guide\nimplementation of . . . injunctive relief may provide substantial assistance to the Court and the\nparties and can reduce unnecessary delays and litigation over disputes regarding compliance.”29 \nIn addition, the DOJ noted:\n28 See, e.g., United States v. City of New York, 717 F.3d 72, 97 (2d Cir. 2013).\n29 DOJ Inj. Mem. at 11.  Accord 5/15 Tr. at 7435 (plaintiffs’ remedies expert\nProfessor Samuel Walker testifying that if liability is found, the appointment of an independent\nmonitor is “necessary”).\n10\n\n[T]he experience of the United States in enforcing police reform injunctions\nteaches that the appointment of an independent monitor is a critically\nimportant  asset  to  the  court,  the  parties, and  the  community  in  cases\ninvolving patterns or practices of unlawful conduct by law enforcement\nofficials.  A court-appointed monitor in this case would help the Court ensure\nthat . . . any pattern or practice . . . is effectively and sustainably remedied.30\nThe appointment of a monitor will serve the interests of all stakeholders, including the City, by\nfacilitating the early and unbiased detection of non-compliance or barriers to compliance.  By\nidentifying problems promptly, the Monitor will save the City time and resources.31\nI also note that the Monitor will have a distinct function from the other oversight\nentities identified by the City, such as the NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau, federal prosecutors,\nthe Civilian Complaint Review Board, and “the public electorate.”32  The Monitor will be\nspecifically and narrowly focused on the City’s compliance with reforming the NYPD’s use of\nstop and frisk — although this will inevitably touch on issues of training, supervision,\nmonitoring, and discipline.  Finally, the Monitor will operate in close coordination with this\n30 DOJ Inj. Mem. at 5.\n31 See id. at 16 (“Without an independent monitor, the Court will be forced to\ndepend on motions practice between the parties to assess progress; a costly, contentious,\ninefficient, and time-consuming process.”).\n32 Id. at 18 (citing Def. Inj. Mem. at 13).  In particular, as the DOJ notes, “it is not\nrealistic to ask ‘the public electorate’ to monitor the police department to ensure that the\ndepartment’s stop-and-frisk practices are consistent with the Constitution.”  Id. at 20 (citing\nUnited States v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938)).  If it is true that 76%\npercent of black voters in New York City disapprove of stop and frisk, as found in a recent\nQuinnipiac University poll, then the persistence of this policy in heavily black communities\nmight indicate the failure “of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect\nminorities,” and thus might justify “more searching judicial inquiry.”  Carolene Prods., 304 U.S.\nat 152 n.4; Quinnipiac University, New Yorkers Back Ban on Take-Out Foam More Than 2-1, at\n8 (Feb. 28, 2013), http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/nyc/nyc02282013.pdf/ (19% of\nblacks approve and 76% disapprove of “a police practice known as stop and frisk, where police\nstop and question a person they suspect of wrongdoing and, if necessary, search that person”).\n11\n\nCourt, which retains jurisdiction to issue orders as necessary to remedy the constitutional\nviolations described in the Liability Opinion.33\nI now specify the Monitor’s role and functions:\n1. The Monitor will be subject to the supervision and orders of the Court.\n2. The Monitor will not, and is not intended to, replace or assume the role or duties of any\nCity or NYPD staff or officials, including the Commissioner.  The Monitor’s duties,\nresponsibilities, and authority will be no broader than necessary to end the constitutional\nviolations in the NYPD’s stop and frisk practices described in the Liability Opinion.  \n3. The Monitor’s initial responsibility will be to develop, based on consultation with the\nparties, a set of reforms of the NYPD’s policies, training, supervision, monitoring, and\ndiscipline regarding stop and frisk.  These reforms (the “Immediate Reforms”) are\noutlined below in Part II.A.2.  They will be developed as soon as practicable and\nimplemented when they are approved by the Court.\n4. After the completion of the Joint Remedial Process, described below in Part II.A.4, the\nMonitor will work with the Facilitator and the parties to develop any further reforms\nnecessary to ending the constitutional violations described in the Liability Opinion. \nThese reforms (“Joint Process Reforms”) will be implemented upon approval by the\nCourt.\n5. The Monitor will inform the City of the milestones the City must achieve in order to\ndemonstrate compliance and bring the monitoring process to an end.\n6. The Monitor will regularly conduct compliance and progress reviews to assess the extent\n33 The Monitor’s role will also be distinct from the broad advisory role of the NYPD\nInspector General envisioned in N.Y. City Council Introductory No. 1079 of 2013.\n12\n\nto which the NYPD has implemented and complied with the Immediate and Joint Process\nReforms.\n7. The Monitor will issue public reports every six months detailing the NYPD’s compliance\nwith the Immediate and Joint Process Reforms.  The Monitor will also file these reports\nwith the Court.\n8. The Monitor will work with the parties to address any barriers to compliance.  To the\nextent possible, the Monitor should strive to develop a collaborative rather than\nadversarial relationship with the City.\n9. The Monitor may request the Court to modify the Immediate and Joint Process Reforms,\nif evidence shows that such modifications are warranted.\n10. The Monitor may request technical assistance from outside experts.  He may also employ\nstaff assistance as he finds reasonable and necessary.  \n11. The City will be responsible for the reasonable costs and fees of the Monitor, his staff,\nand any experts he retains.\n12. The Monitor’s position will come to an end when the City has achieved compliance with\nthe Immediate and Joint Process Reforms.\n2. Immediate Reforms Regarding Stop and Frisk\nEnding the constitutional violations inherent in the NYPD’s current use of stop\nand frisk will require reforms to a number of NYPD policies and practices.  It would be unwise\nand impractical for this Court to impose such reforms at this time, prior to input from the\nMonitor and the participants in the Joint Remedial Process ordered below.34  Instead, as noted\n34 In particular, the City has not yet provided input regarding specific reforms.  See\nDef. Inj. Mem. at 18 (declining to offer a remedy “other than to respectfully direct the Court to\n13\n\nabove, the development of reforms will take place in two stages.  First, the Monitor will\ndevelop, in consultation with the parties, an initial set of reforms to the NYPD’s policies,\ntraining, supervision, monitoring, and discipline regarding stop and frisk (the “Immediate\nReforms”).  These reforms will be developed and submitted to the Court as soon as practicable,\nand implemented when they are approved.  Second, the Facilitator will work with the parties and\nother stakeholders to develop, through the Joint Remedial Process, a more thorough set of\nreforms (the “Joint Process Reforms”) to supplement, as necessary, the Immediate Reforms. \nThe development of the Joint Process Reforms is discussed below in Part II.A.4.\nIf the parties, together with the Monitor, are unable to develop agreed-upon\nImmediate Reforms, the Court will order the parties to draft proposed revisions to specific\npolicies and training materials, as the parties have already done quite effectively in Ligon.35 \nIndeed, the remedies proposed in Ligon may provide a useful model for some aspects of the\nImmediate Reforms.36\nBased on the liability and remedies evidence presented at trial, the Immediate\nReforms must include the following elements:\na. Revisions to Policies and Training Materials Relating to Stop\nand Frisk and to Racial Profiling\nFirst, the NYPD should revise its policies and training regarding stop and frisk to\nadhere to constitutional standards as well as New York state law.  The constitutional standards\nthe trial record for an assessment of the remedies evidence”); 6/12/13 Defendant’s Post-Trial\nMemorandum of Law at 24–25 (declining to propose remedies).\n35 See 7/8/13 Defendants’ Proposed Remedial Relief (“Ligon Def. Rem.”).\n36 See Ligon, 2013 WL 628534, at *41–44.\n14\n\ninclude the standards for: what constitutes a stop, when a stop may be conducted, when a frisk\nmay be conducted, and when a search into clothing or into any object found during a search may\nbe conducted.37  Although the standards may sometimes require the informed use of discretion,\nthey are not complicated and should be stated in policies and training as clearly and simply as\npossible.\nTo summarize: an encounter between a police officer and a civilian constitutes a\nstop whenever a reasonable person would not feel free to disregard the officer and walk away. \nThe threat or use of force is not a necessary or even typical element of stops.  Encounters\ninvolving nothing more than commands or accusatory questions can and routinely do rise to the\nlevel of stops, provided that the commands and questions would lead a reasonable person to\nconclude that he was not free to terminate the encounter.38\nIn order to conduct a stop, an officer must have individualized, reasonable\nsuspicion that the person stopped has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. \nThe officer must be able to articulate facts establishing a minimal level of objective justification\n37 See Liability Opinion at Part III.B; Ligon, 2013 WL 628534, at *41–42.\n38 There could be a simple way to ensure that officers do not unintentionally violate\nthe Fourth Amendment rights of pedestrians by approaching them without reasonable suspicion\nand then inadvertently treating them in such a way that a reasonable person would not feel free\nto leave.  Officers could, for example, begin De Bour Level 1 and 2 encounters by informing the\nperson that he or she is free to leave.  There is no constitutional requirement for officers to\ninform people that they are free to leave.  Cf. Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U.S. 33, 35 (1996) (holding\nthat the Fourth Amendment does not require “that a lawfully seized defendant must be advised\nthat he is ‘free to go’ before his consent to search will be recognized as voluntary”); Schneckloth\nv. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 227 (1973) (“While knowledge of the right to refuse consent is one\nfactor to be taken into account, the government need not establish such knowledge as the sine\nqua non of an effective consent.”).  Nevertheless, the Constitution does not prohibit a police\ndepartment from adopting this policy or a court from ordering it as a means of avoiding\nunconstitutional stops, where — as here — officers have been incorrectly trained on the\ndefinition of a stop.\n15\n\nfor making the stop, which means more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or\nhunch.  “Furtive movements” are an insufficient basis for a stop or frisk if the officer cannot\narticulate anything more specific about the suspicious nature of the movement.  The same is true\nof merely being present in a “high crime area.”  Moreover, no person may be stopped solely\nbecause he matches a vague or generalized description — such as young black male 18 to 24 —\nwithout further detail or indicia of reliability.\nTo proceed from a stop to a frisk, the police officer must reasonably suspect that\nthe person stopped is armed and dangerous.  The purpose of a frisk is not to discover evidence\nof crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence.  Thus, the\nfrisk must be strictly limited to whatever is necessary to uncover weapons that could harm the\nofficer or others nearby.  When an officer lawfully pats down a suspect’s outer clothing and feels\nan object whose contour or mass makes its identity as contraband immediately apparent, the\nofficer may seize the contraband.  If an officer reasonably suspects that a felt object in the\nclothing of a suspect is a weapon, then the officer may take whatever action is necessary to\nexamine the object and protect himself, including removing the object from the clothing of the\nstopped person.\nThe erroneous or misleading training materials identified in the Liability Opinion\nmust be corrected, including the Police Student Guide’s overbroad definition of “furtive\nbehavior;” the misleading training on “unusual firearms” implying that the presence of a wallet,\ncell phone, or pen could justify a frisk, or search; the complete lack of training on the\nconstitutional standard for a frisk — reasonable suspicion that a stopped person is “armed and\ndangerous;” and the failure to include self-initiated stops (which make up 78% of street stops) in\n16\n\nthe role-playing at Rodman’s Neck.39  These training reforms will be in addition to those\ndiscussed below in the section of this Opinion relating to Ligon.40\nSecond, the NYPD should revise its policies and training regarding racial\nprofiling to make clear that targeting “the right people” for stops, as described in the Liability\nOpinion, is a form of racial profiling and violates the Constitution.41  Racially defined groups\nmay not be targeted for stops in general simply because they appear more frequently in local\ncrime suspect data.  Race may only be considered where the stop is based on a specific and\nreliable suspect description.  When an officer carries out a stop based on reasonable suspicion\nthat a person fits such a description, the officer may consider the race of the suspect, just as the\nofficer may consider the suspect’s height or hair color.  When a stop is not based on a specific\nsuspect description, however, race may not be either a motivation or a justification for the stop. \nIn particular, officers must cease the targeting of young black and Hispanic males for stops\nbased on the appearance of these groups in crime complaints.  It may also be appropriate to\nconduct training for officers on the effect of unconscious racial bias.\nThird, it is unclear at this stage whether Operations Order 52 (“OO 52”), which\ndescribes the use of performance objectives to motivate officers, requires revision in order to\nbring the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk into compliance with the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendments.  The evidence at trial showed that OO 52’s use of “performance goals” created\npressure to carry out stops, without any system for monitoring the constitutionality of those\n39 See Liability Opinion at Part IV.C.5.\n40 See infra Part III.\n41 See Liability Opinion at Parts IV.C.3, V.B.1.\n17\n\nstops.  However, the use of performance goals in relation to stops may be appropriate, once an\neffective system for ensuring constitutionality is in place.42  Because the perspective of police\nofficers and police organizations will be particularly valuable to clarifying the role of\nperformance goals in the reform of stop and frisk, these issues should be addressed as part of the\nJoint Remedial Process rather than the Immediate Reforms.\nFinally, I note that where legitimate uncertainty exists regarding the most\nefficient means of reform, and the parties have differing views, it may be feasible for the\nMonitor to test the alternatives by applying them in different precincts and studying the results. \nIn some contexts, the size of the NYPD makes it possible, and desirable, to resolve practical\ndisagreements through the rigorous testing and analysis of alternatives at the precinct level\nbefore applying these reforms to the department as a whole.\nb.

Stewart, testified that performance goals are a necessary\npart of monitoring and supervision:\nIn policing, there are disincentives to engaging in some activities, because\nthey are dangerous, they are in unsterile conditions and chaotic conditions,\nand the officers may not engage in that but yet spend their time on random\npatrol.  They are not out there doing what the department wants them to do,\nbut they do show up and they show up in uniform.  The reason that . . . you\nhave to count the activities is to ensure that those officers do respond . . . to\nthe calls for assistance of help, they do address the community issues . . . .\n5/17 Tr. at 7756.\n18\n\nrecord the basis for stops, is flawed and must be revised.43  Officers are also required to record\nstop and frisk activity in memo books, otherwise known as activity logs.  Quarterly audits of\nthese memo book entries have revealed significant deficiencies in record keeping practices in\nvirtually every precinct throughout the City.44  The proper use of activity logs to record stop and\nfrisk activity must be emphasized in training, as well as enforced through supervision and\ndiscipline.  I first address the UF-250 and then the activity logs.\ni. UF-250 \nAs described in the Liability Opinion, the current UF-250 consists mainly of\ncheckboxes that officers can and often do check by rote,45 thus facilitating post-hoc justifications\nfor stops where none may have existed at the time of the stop.  The UF-250 must be revised to\ninclude a narrative section where the officer must record, in her own words, the basis for the\nstop.  The narrative will enable meaningful supervisory oversight of the officer’s decision to\nconduct the stop, as well as create a record for a later review of constitutionality.\nAs an independent monitor of the New Orleans Police Department (“NOPD”)\nrecently noted, “the overwhelming belief of experts [is] that a narrative field in which the\nofficers describe the circumstances for each stop would be the best way to gather information\nthat will be used to analyze reasonable suspicion” and, relatedly, “prevent[] racially biased\n43 See 5/16 Tr. at 7457 (Walker).\n44 See Pl. Findings ¶ 197 (citing Plaintiffs’ Trial Exhibit (“PX”) 450; Defendant’s\nTrial Exhibit (“DX”) G6).\n45 See, e.g., Liability Opinion at Part IV.B.2.\n19\n\npolicing.”46  The NOPD monitor noted that the City of Oakland recently revised its data\ncollection system to include “a narrative field in which officers are required to state, in their own\nwords, their basis for having reasonable suspicion for a stop.”47  The Oakland Police Department\nadded this narrative field “because it was the best way to evaluate whether individual officers\npossessed the requisite reasonable suspicion for a Terry stop.”48  The Philadelphia Police\nDepartment has also included a narrative field in its stop form.49  Similarly, Professor Walker, a\nnationally recognized authority on police accountability, opined that a form for recording stops\nmust contain a sufficiently detailed narrative that a reviewer can determine from the narrative\nalone whether the stop was based on reasonable suspicion.50\nThe UF-250 should also be revised to require a separate explanation of why a pat-\ndown, frisk, or search was performed.  The evidence at trial revealed that people were routinely\nsubjected to these intrusions when no objective facts supported reasonable suspicion that they\nwere armed and dangerous.  It is apparent that some officers consider frisks to be a routine part\nof a stop.  Because this misconception is contrary to law, the revised UF-250 should include a\nseparate section requiring officers to explain why the stopped person was suspected of being\n46 SUSAN HUTSON, INDEPENDENT POLICE MONITOR, REVIEW OF THE NEW ORLEANS\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT’S FIELD INTERVIEW POLICIES, PRACTICES, AND DATA: FINAL REPORT 45\n(Mar. 12, 2013) (footnote omitted).\n47 Id. at 46.\n48 Id.\n49 See id.\n50 See 5/16 Tr. at 7456–7458 (Walker).  Professor Walker testified that a description\nof reasonable suspicion for a stop will generally require no more than three lines of text.  See id.\nat 7458.\n20\n\narmed and dangerous. \nFurthermore, both the DOJ and plaintiffs recommend that the UF-250 contain a\ntear-off portion stating the reason for the stop, which can be given to each stopped person at the\nend of the encounter.51  A 2007 RAND report, commissioned by the NYPD, similarly\nrecommended that “[f]or a trial period in select precincts, the NYPD could require that officers\ngive an information card to those stopped pedestrians who are neither arrested nor issued a\nsummons.”52  Any form or card given to stopped persons should provide the stated reasons for\nthe stop, the badge numbers of the stopping officers, and information on how to file a complaint.\nFinally, the UF-250 should be revised to simplify and improve the checkbox\nsystem used to indicate common stop justifications.   It may also be necessary to reduce the\nnumber of “stop factor” boxes in order to permit easier analyses of patterns in the\nconstitutionality of stops.53\nIn addition to changing the UF-250, officers should be further trained in its use. \nAs discussed in the Liability Opinion, some officers check certain boxes (or combinations of\nboxes) reflexively as part of “scripts,” including “Furtive Movements” and “Area Has High\n51 See Pl. Rem. Br. at 19 (citing Deborah Ramirez, Jack McDevitt & Amy Farrell, A\nResource Guide on Racial Profiling Data Collection Systems: Promising Practices and Lessons\nLearned 38 (United States Department of Justice 2000), and noting that a tear-off form has been\nused in Great Britain for more than a decade).\n52 GREG RIDGEWAY, RAND, ANALYSIS OF RACIAL DISPARITIES IN THE NEW YORK\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT’S STOP, QUESTION, AND FRISK PRACTICES 44 (2007), DX K6.\n53 See Report of Jeffrey Fagan, Ph.D. (Oct. 15, 2010), PX 411 (“Fagan Rpt.”) at 49\n(describing the analytical difficulties created by the number of possible combinations of stop\nfactors and suspected crimes).\n21\n\nIncidence of Reported Offense of Type Under Investigation.”54  Officers must understand that if\na stop is based on these factors, the officer must provide additional detail in the narrative field —\nfor example, what was the specific nature of the furtive movement, and why was it suspicious? \nWhat was the geographic scope of the “high crime area,” and what was the officer’s specific\nbasis for believing it has a high incidence of the suspected crime?\nii. Activity Logs\nAll uniformed officers are required to provide narrative descriptions of stops in\ntheir activity logs whenever a UF-250 is prepared.55  In practice, this does not take place. \nEvidence at trial showed that throughout the class period, officers consistently failed to record\nstops in their logs, or provided insufficient detail for a supervisor to meaningfully review the\nconstitutionality of the stop.  This problem is best addressed through training, supervision, and\nmonitoring.56\n54 Suspicious Bulge is another factor — albeit less often used than Furtive\nMovements and High Crime Area — that should require greater specificity or a narrative\ndescription.\n55 See Operations Order 44 (9/11/08), PX 96.  In addition, the Chief of Patrol\nrecently directed all officers in the patrol borough to include nine categories of information in\nevery activity log entry for a stop.  The categories include: the date, time and location of the\nstop; the name and pedigree of the person stopped; the suspected felony or penal law\nmisdemeanor; an explanation of the suspicion that led to the stop (such as “looking into\nwindows,” or “pulling on doorknobs”); whether the suspect was frisked; the sprint or job\nnumber, if applicable; and the disposition of the stop.  The Chief of Patrol’s memo also requires\nofficers to elaborate the basis for a stop in the “Additional Circumstances/Factors” section of the\nUF-250, to photocopy every activity log entry for a stop, and to attach the photocopy to the UF-\n250 before submitting it to a supervisor.  See DX J13.\n56 See infra Part II.B.2.c.  I recognize the risk of inefficiency if officers record the\nsame information on UF-250s and in their activity logs.  Professor Walker argued in favor of\nrequiring both, but also expressed concerns regarding inefficiencies.  See 5/16 Tr. at 7458, 7480. \nIf the parties can agree upon an improved procedure during the Joint Remedial Process described\nbelow, those improvements can be included in the Joint Process Reforms.\n22\n\niii. Specific Relief Ordered \nThe NYPD, with the assistance of the Monitor, is directed to revise the UF-250 to\naddress the criticisms expressed in the Liability Opinion and the direction given in this Opinion,\nand to provide training with respect to the new form.  The NYPD is further ordered, again with\nthe assistance of the Monitor, to ensure that activity logs are completed with the required\nspecificity, and to implement measures to adequately discipline officers who fail to comply with\nthese requirements.\nc. Changes to Supervision, Monitoring, and Discipline\nAn essential aspect of the Joint Process Reforms will be the development of an\nimproved system for monitoring, supervision, and discipline.  Professor Walker testified that\ncomprehensive reforms may be necessary to ensure the constitutionality of stops, including\nrevisions to written policies and training materials, improved documentation of stops and frisks,\ndirect supervision and review of stop documentation by sergeants, indirect supervision and\nreview by more senior supervisors and managers, improved citizen complaint procedures,\nimproved disciplinary procedures, department-wide audits, and perhaps even an early\nintervention system based on a centralized source of information regarding officer misconduct. \nAccording to Professor Walker, “[a] comprehensive approach is absolutely essential, because if\nany one of the components is absent or weak and ineffective, the entire accountability system\nbegins to collapse.”57\n57 5/15 Tr. at 7440.  The National Institute of Justice, which the City’s policing\nexpert, James K. Stewart, directed from 1982 to 1990, notes that “the management and culture of\na department are the most important factors influencing police behavior.”  National Institute of\nJustice, Police Integrity, available at http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-\nenforcement/legitimacy/integrity.htm#note2. Ultimately, ending unconstitutionality in stop and\nfrisk may require changing the culture of the NYPD so that officials and officers view their\n23\n\nIn light of the complexity of the supervision, monitoring, and disciplinary reforms\nthat will be required to bring the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk into compliance with the Fourth\nand Fourteenth Amendments, it may be appropriate to incorporate these reforms into the Joint\nRemedial Process negotiations described below.  However, to the extent that the Monitor can\nwork with the parties to develop reforms that can be implemented immediately, the Monitor is\nencouraged to include those reforms in the proposed Immediate Reforms.  \nFor example, based on the findings in the Liability Opinion, there is an urgent\nneed for the NYPD to institute policies specifically requiring sergeants who witness, review, or\ndiscuss stops to address not only the effectiveness but also the constitutionality of those stops,\nand to do so in a thorough and comprehensive manner.58  To the extent that Integrity Control\nOfficers witness or review stops, they too must be instructed to review for constitutionality.59 \nThe Department Advocate’s Office must improve its procedures for imposing discipline in\nresponse to the Civilian Complaint Review Board’s (“CCRB”) findings of substantiated\nmisconduct during stops.  This improvement must include increased deference to credibility\ndeterminations by the CCRB, an evidentiary standard that is neutral between the claims of\ncomplainants and officers, and no general requirement of corroborating physical evidence. \nFinally, the Office of the Chief of Department must begin tracking and investigating complaints\npurpose not only as policing effectively, but policing constitutionally as well.  If so, the NIJ’s\nfirst recommendation for improving the integrity of a department is to “[a]ddress and discipline\nminor offenses so officers learn that major offenses will be disciplined too.”  Id. \n58 See Liability Opinion at Part IV.C.4.b.\n59 See id.\n24\n\nit receives related to racial profiling.60\nd. FINEST Message\nAs soon as practicable, the NYPD should transmit a FINEST message explaining\nthe outcome of the Floyd litigation and the need for the reforms described above.61  The FINEST\nmessage should summarize in simple and clear terms the basic constitutional standards\ngoverning stop and frisk, the constitutional standard prohibiting racial profiling, and the relation\nbetween these standards and New York state law.  The message should order all NYPD\npersonnel to comply immediately with those standards.\n3. Body-Worn Cameras\nThe subject of police officers wearing “body-worn cameras” was inadvertently\nraised during the testimony of the City’s policing expert, James K. Stewart.  The following\ndiscussion took place:\nA. . . . But what happens is the departments a lot of times may not have . . .\nexpertise and they may need some technical assistance like body worn\ncameras is an example and how much technology and where you store the\ninformation and stuff like that.  They may not have it.  And there may be\nother issues like psychological ideas about —\nTHE COURT: What do you think of body worn cameras?\nTHE WITNESS: I think it’s a good idea.  We recommended it in Las Vegas. \nAnd we’re doing it in Phoenix as well.\nTHE COURT: Thank you.\n. . .\nA. But I have no opinion in this case with respect to body worn cameras.62\n60 See id. at Part IV.C.6.\n61 The NYPD’s “FINEST” messaging system allows the transmission of legal\ndirectives to the NYPD’s commands.  See, e.g., 5/10/12 Finest Message Regarding Taxi/Livery\nRobbery Inspection Program, Ex. 1 to 7/24/13 Plaintiffs’ Brief Concerning Defendants’\nRemedial Proposals (“Ligon Pl. Rem.”).\n62 5/17 Tr. at 7817–7818.\n25\n\nThe use of body-worn cameras by NYPD officers would address a number of the\nissues raised in the Liability Opinion.  In evaluating the constitutionality of individual stops, I\nexplained the difficulty of judging in hindsight what happened during an encounter between a\ncivilian and the police.63  The only contemporaneous records of the stops in this case were UF-\n250s and short memo book entries — which were sometimes not prepared directly after a stop,\nand which are inherently one-sided.  Thus, I was forced to analyze the constitutionality of the\nstops based on testimony given years after the encounter, at a time when the participants’\nmemories were likely colored by their interest in the outcome of the case and the passage of\ntime.  The NYPD’s duty to monitor stop and frisk activity is similarly hamstrung by supervisors’\ninability to review an objective representation of what occurred.64 \nVideo recordings will serve a variety of useful functions.  First, they will provide\na contemporaneous, objective record of stops and frisks, allowing for the review of officer\nconduct by supervisors and the courts.  The recordings may either confirm or refute the belief of\nsome minorities that they have been stopped simply as a result of their race, or based on the\nclothes they wore, such as baggy pants or a hoodie.65  Second, the knowledge that an exchange is\nbeing recorded will encourage lawful and respectful interactions on the part of both parties.66 \nThird, the recordings will diminish the sense on the part of those who file complaints that it is\n63 See Liability Opinion at Part IV.D.\n64 See id. at Part IV.C.4.\n65 By creating an irrefutable record of what occurred during stops, video recordings\nmay help lay to rest disagreements that would otherwise remain unresolved.\n66 If, in fact, the police do, on occasion, use offensive language —  including racial\nslurs — or act with more force than necessary, the use of body-worn cameras will inevitably\nreduce such behavior.\n26\n\ntheir word against the police, and that the authorities are more likely to believe the police.67 \nThus, the recordings should also alleviate some of the mistrust that has developed between the\npolice and the black and Hispanic communities, based on the belief that stops and frisks are\noverwhelmingly and unjustifiably directed at members of these communities. Video recordings\nwill be equally helpful to members of the NYPD who are wrongly accused of inappropriate\nbehavior. \nBecause body-worn cameras are uniquely suited to addressing the constitutional\nharms at issue in this case, I am ordering the NYPD to institute a pilot project in which body-\nworn cameras will be worn for a one-year period by officers on patrol in one precinct per\nborough — specifically the precinct with the highest number of stops during 2012.  The Monitor\nwill establish procedures for the review of stop recordings by supervisors and, as appropriate,\nmore senior managers.  The Monitor will also establish procedures for the preservation of stop\nrecordings for use in verifying complaints in a manner that protects the privacy of those stopped. \nFinally, the Monitor will establish procedures for measuring the effectiveness of body-worn\ncameras in reducing unconstitutional stops and frisks.  At the end of the year, the Monitor will\nwork with the parties to determine whether the benefits of the cameras outweigh their financial,\nadministrative, and other costs, and whether the program should be terminated or expanded.  The\nCity will be responsible for the costs of the pilot project.\nIt would have been preferable for this remedy to have originated with the NYPD,\nwhich has been a leader and innovator in the application of technology to policing, as Compstat\nillustrates.  Nevertheless, there is reason to hope that not only civilians but also officers will\n67 See Liability Opinion at Part IV.C.6.\n27\n\nbenefit from the use of cameras.  When a small police department in Rialto, California\nintroduced body-worn cameras, “[t]he results from the first 12 months [were] striking.  Even\nwith only half of the 54 uniformed patrol officers wearing cameras at any given time, the\ndepartment over all had an 88 percent decline in the number of complaints filed against officers,\ncompared with the 12 months before the study.”68  While the logistical difficulties of using body-\nworn cameras will be greater in a larger police force, the potential for avoiding constitutional\nviolations will be greater as well.\n4. Joint Remedial Process for Developing Supplemental Reforms\nA community input component is increasingly common in consent decrees and\nsettlements directed at police reform.69  The DOJ has recognized the importance of community\ninput in its recent consent decrees and other agreements with police departments.70  The\nlandmark Collaborative Agreement approved in 2002 by Judge Susan J. Dlott of the Southern\nDistrict of Ohio as the settlement of class claims against the Cincinnati Police Department has\nbeen widely recognized as a successful model for other police reform.71\nAlthough the remedies in this Opinion are not issued on consent and do not arise\n68 Randall Stross, Wearing a Badge, and a Video Camera, N.Y. TIMES, Apr. 7,\n2013, at BU4.\n69 See 5/16 Tr. at 7521 (Walker).  \n70 See Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ Request for Injunctive Relief\n(“Pl. Inj. Mem.”) at 15 (collecting agreements).\n71 See In re Cincinnati Policing, 209 F.R.D. 395, 397 (S.D. Ohio 2002) (discussing\ndevelopment of Collaborative Agreement through a collaborative procedure); Tyehimba v. City\nof Cincinnati, No. C-1-99-317, 2001 WL 1842470 (S.D. Ohio May 3, 2001) (“Order\nEstablishing Collaborative Procedure”); Pl. Inj. Mem. at 14; GREG RIDGEWAY ET AL., POLICE-\nCOMMUNITY RELATIONS IN CINCINNATI (2009).\n28\n\nfrom a settlement, community input is perhaps an even more vital part of a sustainable remedy in\nthis case.  The communities most affected by the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk have a distinct\nperspective that is highly relevant to crafting effective reforms.  No amount of legal or policing\nexpertise can replace a community’s understanding of the likely practical consequences of\nreforms in terms of both liberty and safety.  \nIt is important that a wide array of stakeholders be offered the opportunity to be\nheard in the reform process: members of the communities where stops most often take place;\nrepresentatives of religious, advocacy, and grassroots organizations; NYPD personnel and\nrepresentatives of police organizations; the District Attorneys’ offices; the CCRB;\nrepresentatives of groups concerned with public schooling, public housing, and other local\ninstitutions; local elected officials and community leaders; representatives of the parties, such as\nthe Mayor’s office, the NYPD, and the lawyers in this case; and the non-parties that submitted\nbriefs: the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ, Communities United for Police Reform, and the\nBlack, Latino, and Asian Caucus of the New York City Council. \nIf the reforms to stop and frisk are not perceived as legitimate by those most\naffected, the reforms are unlikely to be successful.72  Neither an independent Monitor, nor a\nmunicipal administration, nor this Court can speak for those who have been and will be most\naffected by the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk.73  The 2007 RAND report, relied on by the City at\n72 Cf. 5/16 Tr. at 7522 (Professor Walker discussing the legitimacy of reforms).  As\na general matter, police departments “depend upon public confidence, public trust, and public\ncooperation.”  Id. at 7520.  This principle applies no less in the context of stop and frisk.\n73 Cf. United States v. City of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d 391, 404 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(remanding to the district court for a hearing on the permissive intervention of community\ngroups in a DOJ lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department, and emphasizing the\nimportance of not “marginalizing those . . . who have some of the strongest interests in the\n29\n\ntrial, recognized the importance of “ongoing communication and negotiation with the\ncommunity about [stop and frisk] activities” to “maintaining good police-community\nrelations.”74  It is surely in everyone’s interest to prevent another round of protests, litigation,\nand divisive public conflicts over stop and frisk.\nDrawing on this Court’s broad equitable powers to remedy the wrongs in this\ncase,75 I am ordering that all parties participate in a joint remedial process, under the guidance of\na Facilitator to be named by the Court.  I hereby order the following specific relief:\n1. All parties shall participate in the Joint Remedial Process for a period of six to nine\nmonths to develop proposed remedial measures (the “Joint Process Reforms”) that will\nsupplement the Immediate Reforms discussed above.  The Joint Process Reforms must be\nno broader than necessary to bring the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk into compliance\nwith the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  \n2. The Joint Remedial Process will be guided by the Facilitator, with such assistance as the\nFacilitator deems necessary and in consultation with the Monitor.\n3. The initial responsibility of the Facilitator will be to work with the parties to develop a\ntime line, ground rules, and concrete milestones for the Joint Remedial Process.  The\nCincinnati Collaborative Procedure and subsequent DOJ consent decrees and letters of\noutcome”).\n74 RAND Report at 44.\n75 The equitable power of district courts to order processes involving community\ninput is well-established.  See, e.g., United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 635 F. Supp. 1538,\n1545 (S.D.N.Y. 1986), aff’d, 837 F.2d 1181 (2d Cir. 1987) (ordering the Yonkers public school\nsystem to organize “community meetings with minority groups and organizations to solicit\nsupport and assistance in the dissemination of magnet program availability”); Pl. Inj. Mem. at\n11–13 (collecting cases and scholarship).\n30\n\nintent may be used as models.76\n4. At the center of the Joint Remedial Process will be input from those who are most\naffected by the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk, including but not limited to the people and\norganizations noted above.  Input from academic and other experts in police practices\nmay also be requested.\n5. The Facilitator will convene “town hall” type meetings in each of the five boroughs in\norder to provide a forum in which all stakeholders may be heard.  It may be necessary to\nhold multiple meetings in the larger boroughs in order to ensure that everyone will have\nan opportunity to participate.  The Facilitator will endeavor to prepare an agenda for such\nmeetings, through consultation with the various interested groups prior to the meeting. \nThe Monitor will also attend these meetings to the extent possible.\n6. The NYPD will appoint a representative or representatives to serve as a liaison to the\nFacilitator during the Joint Remedial Process.\n7. The Facilitator may receive anonymous information from NYPD officers or officials,\nsubject to procedures to be determined by the parties.\n8. When the parties and the Facilitator have finished drafting the Joint Process Reforms,\nthey will be submitted to the Court and the Monitor.  The Monitor will recommend that\nthe Court consider those Reforms he deems appropriate, and will then oversee their\nimplementation once approved by the Court.\n76 See Tyehimba, 2001 WL 1842470; Pl. Inj. Mem. at 15.  In the interests of\nconserving resources and speeding the development of the Joint Process Reforms, the Joint\nRemedial Process will not involve the development of an independent analysis by a panel of paid\nexperts, as proposed by plaintiffs in Pl. Inj. Mem. at 10.  The participants in the Joint Remedial\nProcess may rely on any sources of facts deemed useful by the Facilitator, including this Court’s\nfindings in the Liability Opinion.  \n31\n\n9. In the event that the parties are unable to agree on Joint Process Reforms, the Facilitator\nwill prepare a report stating the Facilitator’s findings and recommendations based on the\nJoint Remedial Process, to be submitted to the parties, the Monitor, and the Court.  The\nparties will have the opportunity to comment on the report and recommendations.\n10. The City will be responsible for the reasonable costs and fees of the Facilitator and the\nJoint Remedial Process.\nIII. REMEDIES IN LIGON\nIn a January 8, 2013 Opinion and Order, amended on February 14, 2013, I\ngranted the Ligon plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, and proposed entering several\nforms of preliminary relief.77  I postponed ordering that relief until after a consolidated remedies\nhearing could be held in Ligon and Floyd.78  That hearing has now concluded.  The defendants in\nLigon have submitted drafts of the documents discussed in the proposed relief section of the\nFebruary 14 Opinion, the Ligon plaintiffs have proposed revisions to those drafts, and the\ndefendants have responded to the proposed revisions.79\nHaving reviewed the parties’ submissions, I am now imposing the final order of\npreliminary injunctive relief in Ligon.  The reasons for the ordered relief, which must be stated\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d)(1)(A), are the reasons stated in the February\n77 See Ligon, 2013 WL 628534, at *41–44; Ligon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ.\n2274, 2013 WL 227654 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2013) (staying the sole immediate relief ordered in\nthe January 8 Opinion).\n78 See Ligon, 2013 WL 628534, at *42.\n79 See 7/8/13 Defendants’ Proposed Remedial Relief (“Ligon Def. Rem.”); Ligon Pl.\nRem.; 8/2/13 Defendants’ Reply Memorandum of Proposed Remedial Relief (“Ligon Def.\nReply”).\n32\n\n14 Opinion.\nAs set forth in the February 14 Opinion, the relief falls into four categories: \npolicies and procedures; supervision; training; and attorney’s fees.  Attorney’s fees and costs\nwill be rewarded as appropriate on application.  With regard to policies and procedures, I am\nordering the proposed relief from the February 14 Opinion as elaborated below.\nWith regard to the remaining two categories of relief — supervision and training\n— I am ordering the proposed relief from the February 14 Opinion, as restated below, and I am\nalso appointing the Monitor from Floyd, Mr. Zimroth, to oversee the detailed implementation of\nthese orders.  I am delegating the oversight of the Ligon remedies regarding supervision and\ntraining to the Monitor because there is substantial overlap between these remedies and the\ninjunctive relief concerning supervision and training in Floyd.  For example, both sets of\nremedies will require alterations to supervisory procedures for reviewing stops, as well as the\nrevision of the NYPD Legal Bureau’s slide show at Rodman’s Neck.  \nThe purpose of consolidating the remedies hearings in Ligon and Floyd was to\navoid inefficiencies, redundancies, and inconsistencies in the remedies process.80  This purpose\ncan best be fulfilled by placing both the preliminary injunctive relief in Ligon and the permanent\ninjunctive relief in Floyd under the direction and supervision of the Monitor.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Monitor is directed to oversee the City’s\ncompliance with the following orders.\nA.  Policies and Procedures \nFirst, as proposed in the February 14 Opinion, the NYPD is ordered to adopt a\n80 Ligon, 2013 WL 227654, at *4.\n33\n\nformal written policy specifying the limited circumstances in which it is legally permissible to\nstop a person outside a TAP building on a suspicion of trespass.  Specifically, the NYPD is\nordered to amend Interim Order 22 of 2012 (“IO 22”) by deleting the paragraph labeled “NOTE”\non page 2 of IO 22,81 and inserting the following paragraphs in its place:\nA uniformed member of the service may approach and ask questions of a\nperson (that is, conduct a Level 1 request for information under DeBour) if\nthe uniformed member has an objective credible reason to do so.  However,\nmere presence in or outside a building enrolled in the Trespass Affidavit\nProgram is not an “objective credible reason” to approach.  A uniformed\nmember of the service may not approach a person merely because the person\nhas entered or exited or is present near a building enrolled in the Trespass\nAffidavit Program.\nUnder the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a person is\nstopped (temporarily detained) if under the circumstances a reasonable\nperson would not feel free to disregard the police and walk away.  A\nuniformed member of the service may not stop a person on suspicion of\ntrespass unless the uniformed member reasonably suspects that the person\nwas in or is in the building without authorization.  \nMere presence near, entry into, or exit out of a building enrolled in the\nTrespass Affidavit Program, without more, is not sufficient to establish\nreasonable suspicion for a stop on suspicion of trespass.\nThe NYPD is ordered to draft a FINEST message explaining the revisions to IO\n22 and the need for those revisions.  The FINEST message attached as Exhibit 1 to the Ligon\nPlaintiffs’ Brief Concerning Defendants’ Remedial Proposals will serve as a model.  The draft\nwill be provided to the Monitor and then to the Court for approval prior to transmission, with a\ncopy to plaintiffs’ counsel.\nB. Remaining Relief\nThe Monitor is directed to oversee the City’s compliance with the remaining\n81 See Exhibit A to Ligon Def. Rem.\n34\n\norders discussed below.  Plaintiffs do not object to many of the draft revisions submitted by the\nCity in response to the proposed orders.82  Where the parties disagree, the Monitor is authorized\nto resolve the dispute by submitting a proposed order for the Court’s approval.\nAs a model for resolving the parties’ disputes, the Monitor may use this Court’s\nrevision of IO 22, as presented above.83  In arriving at a compromise between the parties’\nproposed language, I aimed to articulate the relevant legal standards as simply and clearly as\npossible.  The goal must be to communicate the law to officers in a way that will be understood,\nremembered, and followed.  In general, plaintiffs’ proposed revisions to the City’s draft\nmaterials make the achievement of this goal more likely.84  I note that the Monitor may depart\nfrom the City’s draft materials even when they do not contain legally erroneous language, if\ndoing so would decrease the likelihood of constitutional violations.\n1.  Supervision\nFirst, the City is ordered to develop procedures for ensuring that UF-250s are\ncompleted for every trespass stop outside a TAP building in the Bronx.  A “stop” is defined as\nany police encounter in which a reasonable person would not feel free to terminate the\nencounter.\nSecond, the City is ordered to develop and implement a system for reviewing the\nconstitutionality of stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx.  Needless to say, any system\n82 See Ligon Def. Rem. at Exs. B–F; Ligon Pl. Rem. at 4–16.\n83 For the materials used in drafting the Court’s revision, see Ligon Def. Rem. at Ex.\nA; Ligon Pl. Rem. at 1–4; Ligon Def. Reply at 2–4.  \n84 See, e.g., Ligon Pl. Rem. at 7–8 (proposing revisions to the City’s draft slide show\nfor officer training at Rodman’s Neck to emphasize the “free to leave” standard, where\nconfusion might otherwise arise).  \n35\n\ndeveloped must not conflict with the supervisory reforms ordered in Floyd.  To the extent that\nsupervisory review reveals that a stop has not conformed with the revised version of IO 22\ndescribed above, the supervisor will ensure that the officer has a proper understanding of what\nconstitutes a stop and when it is legitimate to make a stop. Copies of all reviewed UF-250s shall\nbe provided to plaintiffs’ counsel.\n2. Training\nThe City is ordered to revise the NYPD’s training materials and training programs\nto conform with the law as set forth in the February 14 Opinion.  The instruction must be\nsufficient to uproot the longstanding misconceptions that have affected stops outside of TAP\nbuildings in the Bronx.  It must include, but need not be limited to, the following reforms: \n(1) The revised version of IO 22 described above must be distributed to each Bronx NYPD\nmember, and then redistributed two additional times at six-month intervals.  (2) The stop and\nfrisk refresher course at Rodman’s Neck must be altered to incorporate instruction specifically\ntargeting the problem of unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP buildings.  Training\nregarding stops outside TAP buildings must also be provided to new recruits, as well as any\nofficers who have already attended the Rodman’s Neck refresher course and are not scheduled to\ndo so again.  (3) Chapter 16 of the Chief of Patrol Field Training Guide must be revised to\nreflect the formal written policy governing trespass stops outside TAP buildings described\nabove.  (4) SQF Training Video No. 5 must be revised to conform with the law set forth in the\nFebruary 14 Opinion and must be coordinated with the relief ordered in Floyd.  The revised\nvideo must state that the information contained in the earlier video was incorrect and explain\nwhy it was incorrect.\n36\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION \nThe defendant in Floyd and the defendants in Ligon are ordered to comply with \nthe remedial orders described above.  The Clerk of the Court is directed to close the Ligon \ndefendants' motion regarding proposed remedies. [No. 12 Civ. 2274, Dkt.

City ofN  ew York, et al., 10-CV-00699 (AT), \nFinal Recommendations regarding P.G. 212.11 and P.G. 203.25 \nDear Judge Torres, \nI am pleased to submit my Final Recommendations regarding the following NYPD \npolicies.  I believe that each of them meets the requirements set out in the remedial order. \n1.  Patrol Guide Section 212.11, Investigative Encounters: Requests for Information, \nCommon Law Right of Inquiry and Level 3 Stops; \n2.  Patrol Guide Section 203.25, Department Policy Prohibiting Racial Profiling and \nBias-Based Policing. \nNYPD Policies on Stop, Question and Frisk \nIn focus groups and in conversations with individual officers about stop, question and \nfrisk, we have heard a consistent message:  the officers want more guidance and instruction \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 239   Filed 08/24/15   Page 2 of 22\nARNOLD &  PORTER. LLP \nHonorable Analisa Torres \nAugust 7, 2015 \nPage2 \nabout what they can and cannot do under the law; and they want a clearer understanding of what \ntheir supervisors expect of them.  One of the tools the Department has for communicating these \nmessages is the Patrol Guide, which all officers are expected to read and follow.  Unfortunately, \nas the Department itself acknowledges, the current version of the Patrol Guide section on \ninvestigative encounters (Patrol Guide Section 212.11) does not provide sufficient guidance or \ninstruction. \nThat section focuses almost entirely on the steps officers and superiors should take after \nwhat is assumed to be a lawful stop.  The current procedures do not describe the legal standards \ngoverning stops or the degree of knowledge an officer must have to make a stop lawful.  Nor do \nthe procedures give officers any guidance about the degree of knowledge necessary for \nencounters that are less intrusive than a stop or arrest (for example, a request for information or a \ncommon law right of inquiry), which are governed by the New York State Court of Appeals \ndecision, People v. DeBo ur.  And the procedures do not distinguish between the legal \nrequirements governing stops and those governing frisks and searches, and give only limited \nguidance as to the responsibility of supervisors. \nThe court recognized some of these deficiencies and required specific measures to \nremedy the defects.  The court did not impose new legal requirements, but required only that the \nlegal standards be stated correctly and clearly.  Clarity is important because officers should have \nconfidence that they understand when it is permissible to stop, question and frisk people and \nwhen it is not. \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 239   Filed 08/24/15   Page 3 of 22\nARNOLD &  PORTER LLP \nHonorable Analisa Torres \nAugust 7, 2015 \nPage 3 \nUnder the court orders, as agreed to by the City and the Department, the Patrol Guide \nmust: \n(1) state what constitutes a stop, when a stop may be conducted, when a frisk may be \nconducted, and when: a search may be conducted; \n(2) include a definition of\"reasonable suspicion,\" the standard needed for a stop based on \nTerry v. Ohio; \n(3) state clearly that officers must have separate reasonable suspicion that a person is \narmed and dangerous in order to conduct a frisk of that person; \n( 4) require officers to document the stop and reasonable suspicion, and, if conducted, the \nfrisk, on both a stop report form (formerly called a UF-250) and in their activity logs; \n( 5) require supervisory review of stops, including review of the constitutionality of the \nstop, not just that a stop report form was filled out; and \n(6) provide for supervisors to identify officers needing further training and/or potential \ndiscipline. \nThe NYPD has worked with the monitor and the plaintiffs to develop a revised P.G. \n212.11 that deals with the inadequacies of the current Patrol Guide section and meets the \nrequirements of the remedial order.  The proposed procedures describe the types of encounters a \nuniformed member of the service may initiate with a member of the public during the course of . \nhis or her official duties, the level of knowledge required for each type of encounter, the scope of \na police officer's authority for each type of encounter, the measures that are permissible to \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 239   Filed 08/24/15   Page 4 of 22\nARNOLD &  PORTER LLP \nHonorable Analisa Torres \nAugust 7, 2015 \nPage4 \nprotect uniformed members of the service from injury while engaged in such encounters, and the \nprocedures to be followed by a member of the service during these encounters. \nThe proposed procedures also require documentation of all stops and make more explicit \nthe responsibilities of supervising officers up the chain of command.  They make clear that \nofficers in need of training or possible discipline should be identified, but they state that, \nordinarily, isolated cases of good-faith mistakes made by officers trying to do their jobs will be \ndealt with by training at the command level and not by discipline.  The procedures also require \nthat, absent exigent circumstances, the officer must offer an explanatory \"receipt\" to a person \nstopped but not arrested.  The receipt the Department proposes to use is attached for information \nonly and not for your approval at this time. \nIn addition to amending P.G. 212.11 to meet the court's specific requirements, the \nDepartment took the opportunity, working with the plaintiffs and the monitor team, to respond to \nrecurring questions raised by officers and supervisors.  Thus, by way of example, the proposed \nP.G. 212.11 instructs officers on protective measures an officer can lawfully take even when \nthere are no lawful grounds for a frisk.  The procedures define \"objective, credible reason\" (the \nlevel of knowledge an officer needs to make a request for information), and \"founded suspicion\" \n(the level of knowledge an officer must have to ask accusatory questions during a common law \nright of inquiry).  The procedures remind officers that they may ask an individual to identify \nhimself or herself or present an identification document, but that members of the public are not \nrequired to possess IDs or present them to police officers when requested, and that refusing to \nproduce an ID alone will not elevate the level of the encounter. \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 239   Filed 08/24/15   Page 5 of 22\nARNOLD & PORTER LLP \nHonorable Analisa Torres \nAugust 7, 2015 \nPageS \nNYPD Policy Prohibiting Racial Profiling and Bias-Based Policing \nThe NYPD's policy prohibiting racial profiling is set out in Section 203.25 of the Patrol \nGuide.  The court orders provide that the revised Patrol Guide procedure must include a \ndefinition of racial profiling stating that race, ethnicity or national origin may be considered by \nofficers in taking police enforcement action only when it is part of a specific and reliable suspect \ndescription.  This is not new law; it is based on the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution. \nThe NYPD has worked with the monitor and the plaintiffs to prepare a revised P.G. \n203.25.  The new procedure states that police action, including stops, frisks, arrests or other law \nenforcement actions, may not be motivated, even in part, by the actual or perceived color, \nethnicity or national origin of an individual.  Race may be used only if it is part of a reliable and \nspecific suspect description that includes not just race, gender and age, but other identifying \ncharacteristics or information. \nThe proposed procedure also includes a description of Section 14-151 of the New York \nCity Administrative Code prohibiting bias-based profiling.  The Administrative Code includes \ndemographic categories in addition to race, color and national origin:  creed, age, alienage or \ncitizenship status, gender, sexual orientation, disability and housing status. \nAPPROVED. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: August 24, 2015 \nNew York, New York \nANALISA TORRES \nUnited States District Judge \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 239   Filed 08/24/15   Page 6 of 22\nDRAFT INTERIM ORDER \nSUBJECT:  REVISION TO PATROL GUIDE 212-11, \"STOP AND FRISK\" \nDATE ISSUED:  REFERENCE:  NUMBER: \n. \n08-05-15  *P.G. 212-11  DRAFT 23 \n1.  In order to  ensure members of the service comply with the  Department's policy regarding \ninvestigative encounters, Patrol Guide 212-11, \"Stop and Frisk\" has been revised.  In addition, in order to ensure \nthat individuals who are subject to a stop by a uniformed member of the service receive an explanation for the \nstop, a new Department form entitled, \"'WHAT IS A STOP? (PD383-153)\" has been created. \n2.  Therefore, effective 0001  hours,  September 21, 2015, Patrol Guide 212-11, \"Stop and \nFrisk'' is SUSPENDED and the following new procedure entitled, \"'Investigative Encounters: Requests \nfor Information, Common Law Right oflnquiry and Level 3 Stops\" will be complied with: \nPURPOSE  To describe the types of encounters a uniformed member of the service may \ninitiate with a member of the public during the course of his  or her official \nduties, the level of knowledge required for each type of encounter, the scope of a \npolice  officer's  authority  for  each  type  of encounter,  the  measures  that  are \npermissible to  protect uniformed members  of the  service  from  injury  while \nengaged in such encounters, and the procedures to be followed by a member of \nthe service during these encounters. \nSCOPE  In accordance with their oath to  uphold the  law,  uniformed members of the \nservice must conduct investigative encounters in a lawful and respectful manner; \nhowever, nothing in this section is intended to deter an officer from initiating \nappropriate inquiries and investigative encounters, including stops, or using any \nlawful  and  appropriate  tactics  to  ensure  the  officer's  safety  during  such \ninvestigative encounters.  Moreover, this procedure should not be interpreted to \ndiscourage an officer from engaging in voluntary consensual conversations with \nmembers of the public.  Members of the  service are  encouraged to  develop \npositive relationships in the communities they serve.  Such positive interactions \nwith the  community foster trust and understanding that  will in tum enhance \npublic safety and officer safety. \nDEFINITIONS  INVESTIGATIVE  ENCOUNTERS  - In  the  context  of this  procedure,  an \ninvestigative  encounter  is  a  police  interaction  with  a  member  of  the \npublic/civilian for a law enforcement or investigative purpose.  The New York \nState Court of Appeals in the case of People v. DeBour established the types or \nlevels of such encounters and the authority of the police at each level, consistent \nwith federal constitutional standards.  These encounter levels and the authority of \nthe police at each level are outlined in the definitions that follow. \nREQUEST FOR INFORMATION (LEVEL 1 ENCOUNTER) - A request for \ninformation is an encounter between a civilian and a uniformed member of the \nservice conducted for the purpose of requesting information from the civilian. \nThe uniformed member of the service must have an objective credible reason to \napproach the civilian.  This type of encounter does not require any suspicion of \ncriminal activity.  The objective is to gather information and not to focus on the \n1 of13 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 239   Filed 08/24/15   Page 7 of 22\nDEFINITIONS  person as a potential suspect.  A police officer may seek information related to the \n(continued)  reason(s)  the  person was  approached,  such  as  the  person's  name,  address  and \ndestination if those questions are related to the objective credible reason for the \napproach.  The officer may not ask accusatory questions. The person may refuse to \nanswer questions andlor walk or even run away. Refusal to answer questions andlor \nwalking or running away does not escalate the encounter. At this level, the officer \nmay not seek consent to search, may not use force, and may not create a situation \n(either by words or actions) where a reasonable person would not feel free to leave. \nOBJECTIVE CREDIBLE REASON - A reason is objectively credible if it is \nbased on more than a hunch or a whim.  The reason to gather more information \nmay relate to a public safety/service function or a law enforcement function, but \nneed not be based on any indication of criminality. \nCOMMON-LAW  RIGHT  OF  INQUIRY  (LEVEL  2  ENCOUNTER)  - A \ncommon-law right of inquiry is an encounter between a civilian and a uniformed \nmember of the service conducted for the pwpose of asking the civilian pointed or \naccusatory questions because the police officer has a \"founded suspicion'' that criminal \nactivity is afoot.  \"Founded suspicion\" is a lower level of suspicion than the \"reasonable \nsuspicion\" required to conduct a ·•stop\" or Level 3 encounter. Upon a founded suspicion \nof criminality, the officer may approach a person to ask accusatory questions and may \nseek consent to search; however, consent must be voluntarily given. During a \"Request \nFor Information/Level 1 Encounter,'' giving innocuous answers does not escalate the \nencounter, but providing false information may give rise to founded suspicion.  During a \nLevel 2 encounter,  force may not be used,  the person is free  to refuse to  answer \nquestions, and is free to leave.  Refusal to answer questions or walking away does not \nraise the level of suspicion.  The officer may not create a situation (either by words or \nactions) where a reasonable person would not feel free to walk away. \nFOUNDED SUSPICION - Founded suspicion of criminal activity arises when \nthere is some present indication of criminality based on observable conduct or \nreliable hearsay information. \nLEVEL 3 STOP (LEVEL 3 ENCOUNTER)- A level 3 stop is any encounter \nbetween a civilian and a uniformed member of the service in which a reasonable \nperson would not feel free to disregard the officer and walk away.  A Level 3 stop \nmay take place even without the threat or use of physical force by the officer; \nwhether  an  encounter  amounts  to  a  stop  will  be  judged  by  the  facts  and \ncircumstances of the encounter. A stop may be conducted only when a police officer \nhas an individualized reasonable suspicion that the person stopped has committed, is \ncommitting, or is about to commit a felony or Penal Law misdemeanor.  The police \nofficer may ask questions and detain the person while an expeditious investigation is \nconducted to determine if there is probable cause to arrest the person.  The police \nofficer may seek  consent  to  search.  The  consent  must  be voluntarily  given. \nReasonable force may be used to stop a person. The type and amount of force used \nmust be objectively reasonable under the circumstances. \nINTERIM ORDER NO.  DRAFT 23 \n2 of 13 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 239   Filed 08/24/15   Page 8 of 22\nDEFINITIONS  REASONABLE  SUSPICION  - Reasonable  susp1c10n  exists  when  the \n(continued)  information known to  the  member of the service would make  an ordinarily \nprudent  and  cautious police officer under the circumstances believe criminal \nactivity is at hand.  The officer must have a particularized and objective basis for \nsuspecting the person stopped of the criminal conduct.  The officer must be able \nto articulate specific facts establishing justification for the stop; hunches or gut \nfeelings are not sufficient. \nFRISK - A carefully limited running of the hands over the outside of a person's \nclothing feeling for a deadly weapon or any instrument, article or substance readily \ncapable of causing serious physical injuzy and of a sort not ordinarily carried in public \nplaces by law-abiding persons. A :frisk is authorized when the member of the service \nreasonably suspects the person is armed and dangerous. This includes situations in \nwhich the officer reasonably suspects that the person has committed, is committing, or is \nabout to commit a violent crime or when the officer observes something on the person \nthat she/he reasonably suspects is a weapon.  A frisk may not be conducted to discover \nevidence or the proceeds or instrumentalities of a crime.  A police officer cannot \"frisk\" \na bag or item of personal property unless the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the \nperson is armed and dangerous and the bag or item could contain a weapon and is within \nthe person's reach. \nSEARCH AFTER FRISK- In the context of the investigative encounters described \nin this section, a search occurs when the officer places his/her hands inside a pocket or \nother interior portions of a person's clothing or personal property to remove an object \nthat the member felt during a frisk and reasonably suspects is a weapon or dangerous \ninstrument. \nPROCEDURE  When a uniformed member of the service engages in an investigative encounter \nwith a civilian: \nCONDUCTING  A  LEVEL  1  ENCOUNTER  - A  REQUEST  FOR \nINFORMATION: \nUNIFORMED  1.  Approach the person if there is an objective credible reason to do so. \nMEMBER OF  2.  If not in uniform, identify yourself as a police officer verbally and by \nTHE SERVICE  displaying your shield in a conspicuous manner, if practicable. \n3.  You may seek information and  ask general,  non-threatening questions \nrelated to the reason for the approach.  However, accusatory questions are \nnot permitted. \n4.  The person may refuse to answer questions and is free to leave. \n5.  You may inform the person that she/he is free to leave, but you are not \nrequired to do so unless she/he specifically asks. \n6.  When feasible and consistent with personal safety, provide the individual \nwith an explanation for the encounter. \n7.  DO NOT detain the person, use or threaten the use of force, or request \nconsent to search. \nINTERIM ORDER NO.

Such factors may include infonnation received from third parties as well as the actions of \nthe suspect, the suspect's physical and temporal proximity to the scene ofa  crime, the suspect's resemblance \nto the specific description ofa  perpetrator ofa  crime (based on more than just race, age and gender) and \nirifOnnation knmvn to the cfficer about the suspect or particular location, among other factors.  Each \nsituation is unique and the infonnation available to members oft he sen;ice v.ill vary. \n\"Furtive movements\" or mere presence in a \"high crime area, \" standing alone, are inszifficient \nbases for a stop or frisk  Moreover, even when used in combination with other stop factors, the \nstopping officer must be able  to specifically describe  the suspicious nature of the  \"fio·tive \nmovements\" which she/he observed, and she/he must not define the \"high crime area\" too broadly, \nsuch as encompassing an entire precinct or borough.  In addition, a person may not be stopped \nmerely because he or she matches a generalized description ofa  crime suspect, such as an 18-25 \nyear old male of a particular race.  if a physical description is the only factor relied on by the \nstopping officer, it must be more specific to form the basis for a stop.  Individuals may not be \ntargeted for stops and frisks because they are members of a racial or ethnic group that appears \nmore frequently in local crime suspect data.  Race may only be considered where the stop is based \nupon a specific and reliable suspect description that includes not just race, age and gender, but \nother identifYing characteristics and infonnation.  When a police officer carries out a stop based on \nreasonable suspicion that a person fits such a description, the officer may consider the race oft he \nsuspect, just as the officer may consider the suspect's height or hair color. \nCommanding officers of commands other than patrol precincts, PSAs and transit districts \n(e.g., OCCB, Strategic Response Group, etc.) will designate a supervisor to peiform the desk \nofficer duties listed above.

In order to ensure that members of the service comply with the Department's policy \nprohibiting racial profiling and other forms of bias-based policing, Patrol Guide 203-25, \"Department \nPolicy Prohibiting Racial Profiling\" has been revised. \n2.  Therefore, effective immediately, Patrol Guide 203-25, \"Department Policy Prohibiting \nRacial  Profiling\"  is  SUSPENDED  and  the following  new  procedure  entitled,  \"Department  Policy \nProhibiting Racial Profiling and Bias-Based Policing\" must be complied with: \n3.  Members  of the service are reminded that the New York City Police Department is \ncommitted both to the impartial enforcement of law and to the protection of constitutional rights. To \nreinforce  these  commitments  and  to  ensure  that  all  members  of the  service  engage  only  in \nconstitutionally sound policing practices,  the Department prohibits the use of racial and bias-based \nprofiling in law enforcement actions. Conducting enforcement activities in an unbiased manner fosters \nand strengthens relationships between police officers and members of the  community,  and inspires \nconfidence in, and support for, policing efforts. \n4.  Police-initiated enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, arrests, Level3 Terry stops, \nfrisks, searches, summonses, and motor vehicle stops, must be based on the standards required by the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, Sections 11 and 12 of Article I of the New York State \nConstitution, Section 14-151 of theNe w York City Administrative Code, and other applicable laws. \n5.  Race,  color,  ethnicity,  or national origin may not be used as  a motivating factor  for \ninitiating police enforcement action. When an officer's decision to initiate enforcement action against a \nperson is motivated even in part by a person's actual or perceived race,  color, ethnicity or national \norigin, that enforcement action violates Department policy unless the officer's decision is based on a \nspecific and reliable suspect description that includes not just race, age, and gender, but other identifying \ncharacteristics or information. \n6.  The law confers on police officers the authority to stop, question, and if warranted, frisk \nan individual whom an officer reasonably suspects has committed, is committing, or is about to commit \na felony or Penal Law misdemeanor. Police officers must be able to articulate the factors which led them \nto take enforcement action, in particular those factors  leading to  reasonable suspicion for  stopping, \nquestioning, and, if appropriate, frisking a person, or probable cause for arresting or issuing a summons \nto a person. Individuals may not be targeted for any enforcement action, including stops, because they \nare members of a racial or ethnic group that appears more frequently in local crime suspect data.  Race, \ncolor,  ethnicity, or national origin may only be considered when the stop is based on a specific and \nreliable  suspect  description  that  includes  not  just  race,  gender,  and  age,  but  other  identifying \ncharacteristics or information. When an officer carries out a stop based on reasonable suspicion that a \nperson fits such a description, the officer may consider the race, color, ethnicity, or national origin of the \nsuspect just as  the  officer  may  consider  the  suspect's  height  or  hair  color.  In  accordance  with \nDepartment policy, when a stop is not based on a specific suspect description, however, race, ethnicity \nor national origin may not be used at all as a motivation or justification for the stop. \n1 of2 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 239   Filed 08/24/15   Page 22 of 22\n7.  Section  14-151  of the  New York  City Administrative  Code  and  Department policy \nprohibit bias-based profiling and include demographic categories in addition to race, color, and national \norigin.  The Administrative Code and Department policy prohibit the Department and individual officers \nfrom intentionally engaging in bias-based profiling, which is defined as ''an act of a member of the force \nof the police department or other law enforcement officer that relies on actual or perceived race, national \norigin, color, creed, age, alienage or citizenship status, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or housing \nstatus as the determinative factor in initiating law enforcement action against an individual, rather than \nan  individual's  behavior  or other  information  or circumstances  that  links  a  person  or  persons  to \nsuspected unlawful activity.\"  With respect to race, color, ethnicity and national origin, the standards of \nconduct described in paragraphs ''5\" and ''6\" must always be met by the Department and its officers. \n8.  Commanding officers will continue to ensure that self-inspections are conducted within \ntheir commands  regarding  stop,  question,  and  frisk  activity.  The  Quality Assurance  Division  will \ncontinue to monitor compliance with self-inspection protocols in all of its command inspections and will \ncontinue to audit stop, question, and frisk activity Department-wide. \n9.  Commanding  officers  will  ensure  that  members  of their command  comply with the \nDepartment's  policy  regarding  investigative  encounters  as  per  Patrol  Guide  212-11,  ''Investigative \nEncounters: Requests for Information, Common Law Right of Inquiry and Level 3 Stops.\" \n10.  REVISE  references  to  Patrol  Guide  203-25,  \"Department Policy Prohibiting  Racial \nProfiling\" wherever they appear in the Department Manual to read: \n\"Patrol Guide 203-25, 'Department Policy Prohibiting Racial Profiling and Bias-Based Policing' ·· \n11.

I  8 /15 \nDAVID FLOYD, et al., \nPlaintiffs, \n-against- 08 Civ. 1034 (AT) \nCITY OF NEW YORK, \nDefendant. \nKELTON DAVIS, et al., \nPlaintiffs, \n-against- 10 Civ. 0699 (AT) \nCITY OF NEW YORK, \nDefendant. \nJAENEAN LIGON, et al., \nPlaintiffs,  12 Civ. 2274 (AT) \n-against-\nORDER MODIFYING \nREMEDIAL ORDER \nCITY OF NEW YORK, \n(BODY-WORN CAMERA \nPILOT PROGRAM) \nDefendant. \nANALISA TORRES, District Judge: \nIn its Remedies Opinion and Order issued on August 12, 2013, the Court ordered that the \nNYPD \"institute a pilot project in which body-worn cameras will be worn for a one-year period.\" \nFloyd v. City ofN  ew York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 668, 685 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).  The Court noted that the \nvideo recordings would \"serve a variety of useful functions.\"  !d. \nFirst, they will provide a contemporaneous, objective record of stops and frisks, \nallowing for the review of officer conduct by supervisors and the courts.  The \nrecordings may either confirm or refute the belief of some minorities that they \nhave been stopped simply as a result of their race, or based on the clothes they \nwore, such as baggy pants or a hoodie.65 Second, the knowledge that an exchange \nis being recorded will encourage lawful and respectful interactions on the part of \nboth parties.66  Third, the recordings will diminish the sense on the part of those \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 244   Filed 12/08/15   Page 2 of 4\nwho file complaints that it is their word against the police, and that the authorities \nare more likely to believe the police.  [Footnote omitted.]  Thus, the recordings \nshould also alleviate some of the mistrust that has developed between the police \nand the black and Hispanic communities, based on the belief that stops and frisks \nare overwhelmingly and unjustifiably directed at members of these communities. \nVideo recordings will be equally helpful to members of the NYPD who are \nwrongly accused of inappropriate behavior. \n65 By creating an irrefutable record of what occurred during stops, video recordings may help lay \nto rest disagreements that would otherwise remain unresolved. \n66 If, in fact, the police do, on occasion, use offensive language-including racial slurs-or act \nwith more force than necessary, the use of body-worn cameras will inevitably reduce such \nbehavior. \n!d.  At the end of one year, there will be an evaluation of \"whether the benefits of the cameras \noutweigh their financial, administrative, and other costs.\" !d. \nThe Court directed that the cameras be worn \"by officers on patrol in one precinct per \nborough-specifically the precinct with the highest number of stops during 2012. '' !d.  These \nNYPD commands were identified as the 23rd, 40th, 75th, 10 3rd and 120th Precincts.  As noted \nin the Monitor's First Report, dated July 9, 2015, however, requiring officers in these precincts \nto wear the cameras might not provide the best information regarding the benefits and costs of \nbody-worn cameras, including determining whether they will be effective in reducing \nunconstitutional stops-and-frisks.  ECF No. 513 at 67-78.  First, some ofthe precincts with the \nhighest counts of stop reports in 2012 were no longer the precincts with the highest number of \nreported stops in 2014.  In 2012, the 75th Precinct had the greatest number of reported stops in \nthe city; in 2014, the 75th Precinct was down to sixteenth place.  Second, the selection of \nprecincts in advance prevents the use of a rigorous randomized experimental design, because it \nwould be impossible to have a random selection of commands matching those that had cameras \nwith those that did not.  As set out in the Monitor's report, the advantage of a randomized \nexperiment is the relatively high degree of certainty that any observed differences between the \n2 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 244   Filed 12/08/15   Page 3 of 4\nprecincts with cameras and those without would be attributable to the cameras, not to chance or \nother causal factors. \nThe Monitor has been working with experts on his team and discussing with the parties \nhow to design a pilot that will yield more robust and useful information.  He is recommending, \nand the parties agree, that a randomized experimental design should be implemented.  Such a \ndesign allows researchers to assume that the only systematic difference between the ''control\" \ngroup (here, those without cameras) and the \"treatment group'' (those with cameras) is the \npresence of the intervention (i.e., use of cameras).  This approach permits a clearer assessment of \ncauses and effects. One variant of the classic randomized controlled trial that the NYPD could \nuse-the one currently under consideration-is called ''cluster\" randomization.  In these trials, \nclusters (groups) of subjects, rather than individual subjects, are randomly allocated to treatment \nand control conditions.  In a cluster randomized controlled trial, NYPD officers would be \nrandomly allocated by precinct to the body-worn camera treatment group or non-body-worn \ncamera comparison group.  The precise details of the research design have not yet been finalized \nand will be developed further before the pilot is begun.  The NYPD has reported that it does not \nexpect to complete the procurement process and take delivery of cameras before the summer of \n2016.  Before then, the design and implementation of the pilot might have to account for possible \nchanges in technology, police department programs and deployment, and other relevant factors. \nIt is anticipated that roughly 1,000 officers will be equipped with body-worn cameras. \nThe use of a randomized experimental design for the body-worn camera pilot will ensure that the \npilot will provide the parties, the Monitor, the Court, and the public with better information to \nevaluate the effectiveness of body-worn cameras in reducing unconstitutional stops-and-frisks \nand in assessing the costs and benefits of the body-worn cameras. \n3 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 244   Filed 12/08/15   Page 4 of 4\nAccordingly, on consent of the parties, it is ORDERED that the NYPD use a randomized \nexperimental design for the body-worn camera one-year pilot program. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: December 8, 2015 \nNew York, New York \nANALISA TORRES \nUnited States District Judge \n4 ",

City ofNew York, 770 F.3d 1051 \n(2d Cir. 2014 ), paved the way for a new chapter in this litigation: the difficult process of bringing \nthe NYPD's stop-and-frisk policies and practices into compliance with federal and state law.  At \nthis initial stage, the Monitor appointed to oversee the reforms is to consult with the parties, \ncarefully consider each side's perspective, harmonize their views where possible and, as soon as \npracticable, propose Final Recommendations to the Court.  Floyd v. City ofN  ew York, 959 F. \nSupp. 2d 668, 677-78 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). \nOn February 3, 2015, the Court issued an order establishing procedures for the Court's \nconsideration of the Monitor's Final Recommendations.  The order states that the Monitor shall \nprovide Final Recommendations to the parties, that the parties shall have five days to notify the \nMonitor of an intent to raise objections, and that the parties shall have fourteen days to advise the \nCourt of the grounds for any objection. \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 227   Filed 03/19/15   Page 2 of 2\nBy letters dated March 4 and 6, 2015, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the \nSergeants Benevolent Association ask to participate in the reform process by presenting their \nviews after the Monitor submits his Final Recommendations.  The Court believes the unions' \n\"important perspective on these matters\" should be heard earlier. \nBy letter dated March 18, 2015, the City suggests a way for all five police unions to \nparticipate in the remedial process now.  Under the City's approach, the City will share proposals \nwith the unions before providing them to the Monitor and the Plaintiffs.  The unions may then \noffer their comments, which the City will convey to the Monitor.  The City will continue to confer \nwith the unions about substantial revisions proposed by the Monitor and the Plaintiffs.1 This \napproach affords the unions \"a practical opportunity\" to inform the Monitor of their viewpoints \nbefore the Monitor reaches conclusions and submits Final Recommendations to the Court. \nAccordingly, the unions' request is GRANTED to the extent that the Court invites the \nunions to participate in the manner described above. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: March 19, 20 15 \nNew York, New York \nANALISA TORRES \nUnited States District Judge \n1 Appropriate confidentiality provisions shall be established for the exchange of information. \n2 ",

INTRODUCTION \nIn a January 14,2013 letter, defendants request an immediate stay \npending appeal of the Court's January 8, 2013 Opinion and Order (\"Opinion\") in \n1 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 2 of 20\nLigon v. City of New York.1  The Opinion granted the Ligon plaintiffs’ application\nfor a preliminary injunction, but postponed consideration of the appropriate\nremedies — with the sole exception of ordering defendants to conform their\nconduct to the constitutional standards articulated by the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.2 \nDefendants have filed a notice of appeal in Ligon.

DISCUSSION\nA. Defendants’ Request for Stay Pending Appeal\n“The four factors to be considered in issuing a stay pending appeal are\nwell known: ‘(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is\nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably\ninjured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the\nother parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.’”5 \n“[T]he degree to which a factor must be present varies with the strength of the\nother factors, meaning that ‘more of one [factor] excuses less of the other.’”6\nFirst, to the extent that defendants intend to raise on appeal the issues\npresented in their letters, I am not persuaded that defendants are likely to succeed\non the merits of their appeal.  In particular, I find it noteworthy that defendants\nchoose to characterize the holdings of the Opinion not by quoting from the\nOpinion’s holdings, but rather by quoting selectively from a relatively peripheral\ndiscussion of an NYPD training manual.  Defendants suggest that this Court\n5 In re World Trade Ctr. Disaster Site Litig., 503 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.\n2007) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987), and citing Cooper\nv. Town of E. Hampton, 83 F.3d 31, 36 (2d Cir. 1996)) (footnote omitted).\n6 Id. (quoting Thapa v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 323, 334 (2d Cir. 2006))\n(certain quotation marks omitted).\n3\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 4 of 20\n“ruled” that “approaching a person, engaging in ‘pointed, invasive and accusatory’\nquestioning ‘intended to elicit an incriminating response’ and ‘asking for\npermission’ to search a person constitutes a Terry stop of that person.”7  This Court\nmade no such ruling.  While the paragraph quoted by defendants casts a critical eye\non the likely effects of the permissive language in the training manual, the Opinion\ndoes not hold that the behaviors described in the training manual would by\ndefinition constitute a Terry stop.  To the contrary, the cited paragraph contains\nnumerous qualifications intended to prevent the very misunderstanding reflected in\ndefendants’ January 14 letter.8 \nSimilarly, defendants state in their reply letter that “the Court opined\nthat pointed questioning designed to elicit an incriminating response must not take\nplace until after an officer has developed reasonable suspicion, because people\n7 1/14/13 Letter from Heidi Grossman et al., Counsel for Defendants, to\nthe Court (“1/14 Grossman Ltr.”) at 1.\n8 For example, the paragraph states that the Fourth Amendment “does\nnot proscribe all contact between the police and citizens.”  Ligon, 2013 WL 71800,\nat *37 (emphasis added).  The paragraph notes that “it is difficult to imagine many\ncircumstances in which a reasonable person being aggressively interrogated by the\npolice” would feel free to leave, not that there are no circumstances in which a\nreasonable person being asked accusatory questions would feel free to leave.  Id.\n(emphasis added).  The paragraph also notes that it is fanciful to say that a\nreasonable person would “as a rule” feel free to leave in the midst of a field\ninterrogation, not that no reasonable person could feel free to go.  Id.

Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 436 (1991)) (emphasis added).  To conclude that\na practice can and routinely does rise to the level of a Terry stop provided that a\nspecific standard is met, is obviously not the same thing as concluding that the\npractice by definition “constitutes a Terry stop,” 1/14 Grossman Ltr. at 1, and thus\nmust always be preceded by reasonable suspicion.     \n12 See especially the introductory summary of Fourth Amendment law at\nLigon, 2103 WL 71800, at *4–5.  More generally, the Opinion invokes the\n“terminate the encounter” standard for defining Terry stops on more than ten\noccasions.  By contrast, the Opinion never analyzes whether an encounter rose to\nthe level of a Terry stop simply by asking whether the encounter involved\naccusatory questioning.\n5\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 6 of 20\nIn addition, defendants now argue, after the conclusion of the hearing\nand without citation to any evidence, that some or all of plaintiffs’ stops were\nbased on consent, and therefore that this Court has improperly redefined\nconsensual encounters as Terry stops.13  The parties’ post-hearing briefing only\nraised the issue of consent once — and solely in the context of New York state\nlaw14 — and never argued that any of plaintiffs’ stops were based on consent.  As a\nresult, I did not address the issue of consent in the Opinion.  Because defendants’\nletters suggest that they intend to challenge the Opinion based on the notion that\n13 See 1/14 Grossman Ltr. at 2.  I note that even when the Supreme\nCourt has found consent for a search, it has held that the “terminate the encounter”\nstandard defines a Terry stop.  See, e.g., United States v. Drayton, 536 U.S. 194,\n200–01 (2002) (“The proper inquiry ‘is whether a reasonable person would feel\nfree to decline the officers’ requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.’”\n(quoting Bostick, 501 U.S. at 436)).  See also 4 WAYNE R. LAFAVE, SEARCH &\nSEIZURE § 9.4(a) (5th ed. 2012) (“[I]t does not appear . . . that the\nMendenhall-Royer [‘free to leave’] test is intended to divide police-citizen\nencounters into their seizure and nonseizure categories by reliance upon the\namorphous concept of consent.”).   \n14 See Defendants’ Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n¶ 42 n.19 (“First, not every police encounter requires reasonable suspicion and may\nbe consensual.  Contrary to plaintiffs’ counsel’s assertions during closing\narguments . . ., New York Law applies.”).  This is the only reference to consent in\ndefendants’ post-hearing brief.  I also emphasize, as I did in the Opinion, that\ndefendants’ argument that “New York Law applies” does not address the United\nStates Supreme Court’s clear holding that any question of the reasonableness of a\nsearch or seizure must be governed by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution\nof the United States.  See Ligon, 2013 WL 71800, at *39 & n.430 (citing Sibron v.\nState of New York, 392 U.S. 40 (1968)).\n6\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 7 of 20\nplaintiffs consented to their police encounters, however, I will briefly address this\nissue now.  With the possible exception of Letitia Ledan’s stops — the second of\nwhich Ledan initiated by approaching a police officer and asking questions15 —\nthere was no evidence at the hearing that any of plaintiffs’ stops were consensual. \nThus, for the same reasons that I found a reasonable person would not have felt\nfree to terminate plaintiffs’ encounters with the police, I also find that none of the\nplaintiffs consented to being stopped — with the possible exception of Ledan.  It is\nwishful thinking, at best, to suggest that plaintiffs, who were neither asked for\nconsent nor gave it, and who did not feel free to terminate their encounters,\nwillingly consented to the encounters that left them feeling “violated,”\n“disrespected,” “angry,” and “defenseless.”16\nDefendants also argue that the Opinion misinterprets Florida v.\nBostick.17  It is peculiar to hear defendants defend the NYPD’s current practices by\nsuggesting that this Court is ordering a departure from Bostick, because the\n“Immediate Relief” section of the Opinion quotes the Bostick definition of a Terry\n15 See Ligon, 2013 WL 71800, at *17, *29 n.345.  Ledan’s first stop is\ndiscussed below.\n16 Id. at *2.\n17 See 1/14 Grossman Ltr. at 2.\n7\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 8 of 20\nstop and orders defendants to comply with it.18  Indeed, one of the central, often\nrepeated principles of the Opinion is that the NYPD must comply with Bostick’s\ndefinition of a Terry stop, and not only with New York state law.19  It is reassuring\nthat defendants now agree that a police officer must have reasonable suspicion to\ninitiate any encounter in which a reasonable person would not feel free “to decline\nthe officers’ requests or otherwise terminate the encounter,”20 as Bostick states.21  If\ndefendants endorse these principles, however, it is puzzling that defendants\ncontinue to defend the NYPD’s training materials, which make little reference to\nthe “terminate the encounter” or “free to leave” standards, and instead base the\nofficers’ training almost entirely on the ambiguous, overlapping, and problematic\nstop standards contained in De Bour and its progeny.  As the Opinion recognizes,\nthe extent to which De Bour conflicts with or complements the Fourth Amendment\n18 “To summarize: as the Fourth Amendment has been interpreted by the\nU.S. Supreme Court and the Second Circuit, an encounter between a police officer\nand a civilian constitutes a Terry stop whenever a reasonable person would not feel\nfree to ‘“terminate the encounter.”’”  Ligon, 2013 WL 71800, at *41 & n.454\n(quoting Drayton, 536 U.S. at 202 (quoting Bostick, 501 U.S. at 436)).\n19 Again, I note that the Opinion invokes Bostick’s “terminate the\nencounter” standard on more than ten occasions.\n20 Bostick, 501 U.S. at 436.\n21 See 11/14 Grossman Ltr. at 2 (citing Bostick).\n8\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 9 of 20\nis unclear.22  But it is obviously no defense of practices that violate the Fourth\nAmendment to say that they resulted from training based on New York state law,\nas defendants continue to argue.23  \nTo the extent that defendants criticize my application of the Fourth\nAmendment standards articulated in Bostick, I recognize that opinions may differ\nregarding when a reasonable person would feel free to terminate an encounter.24  I\n22 See Ligon, 2013 WL 71800, at *6, *38 n.422 (discussing People v. De\nBour, 40 N.Y.2d 210 (1976)).\n23 See, e.g., 1/17 Grossman Ltr. at 1 (stating that it would be “an\nimpossible burden” to require the NYPD to conduct training that “contradicts well\nestablished, long standing New York State case law as set forth in People v. De\nBour”).  On the primacy of the U.S. Constitution over New York state law, see\nLigon, 2013 WL 71800, at *1 & nn.3–7 (quoting Sibron, 392 U.S. at 61).  If\ndefendants accept that Bostick’s view of the Fourth Amendment governs the\nNYPD, then the NYPD should train its officers in accordance with that standard. \nThe message delivered in training would be simple:  without reasonable suspicion,\na police officer may not treat someone in such a way that a reasonable person\nwould not feel free to terminate the encounter.  It is unclear why this lesson,\ninstead of forming the core of NYPD training on the legality of stops, appears to\nplay almost no role.\n24 Specifically, defendants question my ruling that the two encounters\ndescribed by Ledan and the second encounter described by Abdullah Turner were,\nin fact, Terry stops, rather than merely constitutionally permissible “pointed\nquestioning designed to elicit an incriminating response.”  1/17 Grossman Ltr. at 2. \nSee also 1/14 Grossman Ltr. at 2.  \nBased on my best judgment, as informed by Supreme Court and\nSecond Circuit precedent, I made a good faith effort to determine whether a\nreasonable person would have felt free to terminate the encounters described by\nplaintiffs.  See Ligon, 2013 WL 71800, at *36 nn.408–09 (citing United States v.\nSimmons, 560 F.3d 98, 105 (2d Cir. 2009); Brown v. City of Oneonta, N.Y., 221\n9\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 10 of 20\nfind it highly unlikely, however, that defendants could prevail in their attempt to\ndefend the NYPD’s current training regime simply on the basis of marginal\ndisagreements with my application of the Fourth Amendment’s “free to leave”\nstandard to the specific facts described by one or two plaintiffs.  There can be little\ndoubt that most of the plaintiffs experienced Terry stops; and even if there were\nsuch doubt, there can be no doubt that the stops recorded in UF-250 forms were\nF.3d 329, 340 (2d Cir. 2000)).  Defendants are correct that Turner’s second stop\nwas one of the least intrusive described at the hearing.  I note, however, that the\nofficer in Turner’s second stop did not simply ask pointed questions designed to\nelicit an incriminating response.  The officer’s patrol car pulled in front of the exit\nto the building as Turner was attempting to leave; the officer stopped Turner from\nleaving by asking him pointed questions designed to elicit an incriminating\nresponse, asked for Turner’s ID and took it, and told Turner and the others that\nthey could not stand in front of their own building; and the encounter unfolded in\nsuch a way that Turner, whose subjective state is not dispositive but may shed light\non the objective tenor of the encounter, did not feel free to leave.  See id. at\n*13–14, 28.  I again conclude that no reasonable person would have felt free to\nleave under these circumstances, particularly once the police had possession of the\nID.\nOn the other hand, defendants’ newly articulated criticisms have\npersuaded me that I should have refrained from identifying Ledan’s first encounter\nas a Terry stop.  See id. at *16.  The Opinion never explicitly analyzed Ledan’s\nfirst encounter under the Bostick test, but in the “deliberate indifference” section, I\nwrote:  “each of plaintiffs’ encounters with the police rose to the level of Terry\nstops.”  Id. at *28.  I now conclude based on Ledan’s limited testimony that a\nreasonable person would probably have felt free to leave under the circumstances\nof her first encounter, especially if the officers treated Ledan politely rather than in\nan aggressive, coercive, or threatening manner.  See id.  I also emphasize, as I did\nin the Opinion, that further evidentiary development may affect my factual\nfindings.  See id. at *44 (“I stress that my conclusions in this Opinion are based on\nthe limited evidence presented at the preliminary injunction hearing.”).\n10\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 11 of 20\nTerry stops.25  Standing alone, the UF-250 forms indicate that hundreds or even\nthousands of violations of constitutional rights have occurred outside TAP\nbuildings in the Bronx.  This suit is a putative class action.  Setting aside Ledan’s\nstops and Turner’s second stop, there is more than enough proof that a large\nnumber of people have been improperly stopped as a result of NYPD practices. \nThese facts warrant an injunction.\nDespite my reservations regarding the likelihood of defendants’\nsuccess on appeal, however, I recognize that reversal is always a possibility.  The\nOpinion acknowledges at the outset that many of the questions raised by stop and\nfrisk are not easily answered,26 and that “it may be difficult to say where, precisely,\nto draw the line between constitutional and unconstitutional police encounters.”27\nSecond, defendants argue that they would suffer irreparable injury in\nthe absence of a stay.  Defendants state that “[f]or the NYPD to ensure compliance\nwith the ‘Immediate Relief’ ordered by the Court . . . at least some form of\n25 Officers are required to fill out a UF-250 (“Stop, Question and Frisk\nReport Worksheet”) after each Terry stop, and only then.  See Transcript of\nPreliminary Injunction Hearing (“Tr.”) 10/15 at 69:24–70:6 (testimony of\nplaintiffs’ expert witness Dr. Jeffrey Fagan); Tr. 10/23 at 1110:5–8 (testimony of\nOfficer Miguel Santiago); July 2012 Chief of Patrol Field Training Unit Program\nGuide, Defendants’ Exhibit N, at 24.\n26 See Ligon, 2013 WL 71800, at *1.\n27 Id. at *3.\n11\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 12 of 20\nnotification to and/or training of thousands of NYPD officers and their supervisors\nwould be necessary.”28  Plaintiffs question this assertion, arguing that “the NYPD\nroutinely sends out notifications to members of the department instructing them\nabout changes in practice in response to lawsuits.”29  Plaintiffs provide evidence\nthat the NYPD could use, and has used in similar cases, the “FINEST” messaging\nsystem to notify officers and supervisors of court orders.30\nAfter review of the parties’ letters, I conclude that effective\ncompliance with the immediate remedy ordered in the Opinion will likely require\nsteps beyond the circulation of FINEST messages, and that these steps may impose\nsignificant burdens on the NYPD.  It was for this reason that I refrained from\nordering the “Proposed Additional Relief” in the Opinion.31  I am now persuaded\nthat the immediate relief ordered cannot be effectively implemented without the\nsorts of significant steps I proposed.\nI am also cognizant of the possibility that administrative inefficiencies\n28 1/14 Grossman Ltr. at 2.

A, B to 1/16 Dunn Ltr.\n31 See Ligon, 2013 WL 71800, at *41–44.\n12\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 13 of 20\nmay result from ordering certain remedies now and potentially ordering different\nremedies after the completion of the consolidated remedies hearing in Floyd and\nLigon.32  Because any unnecessary administrative costs imposed on the NYPD will\nbe in some sense irreversible, the risk of irreparable harm weighs in favor of\ngranting the stay. \nThird, with regard to whether issuance of a stay will substantially\ninjure other parties, it is likely that a stay will cause some injury to those who are at\nrisk of being subject to unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the\nBronx.  If the stay is granted, a certain number of unconstitutional stops are likely\nto take place that would not have taken place in the absence of a stay.  I take\nseriously the cost of these unconstitutional stops, as the Opinion makes clear.33\nOn the other hand, allowing a longstanding unconstitutional practice\nto persist for a few months while the parties present arguments regarding the\nappropriate scope of a remedy is quite distinct from allowing such a practice to\npersist until the completion of trial.  In the Opinion, I granted a preliminary\ninjunction in part based on the risk that a final resolution of plaintiffs’ case might\nlie years in the future, as the protracted course of the Floyd litigation has\n32 See id.\n33 See id. at *39–40 (balance of equities analysis).\n13\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 14 of 20\nillustrated.34  The likely cost of granting a brief stay in the present case is far\nsmaller — though it is a source of concern that such a cost must be borne at all.\nFourth, with regard to the public interest, the analysis from the\nOpinion largely applies.35  There is a conflict between the liberty and dignity of\nthose who may be stopped as a result of a stay, and the public safety interest in\nconserving the NYPD’s resources.  Both interests are significant.\nWeighing the factors above, I conclude that the balance tips in favor\nof granting a brief stay.  In essence, now that I am persuaded that compliance with\nthe immediate ordered relief in the Opinion would in practice require taking some\nor all of the burdensome steps presented as proposed relief, the same reasoning that\nled me to propose that relief rather than ordering it now leads me to favor granting\na limited stay.  The inefficiency of immediately implementing reforms that may\nrequire alteration after the Floyd-Ligon remedies hearing, the public safety interest\nin conserving the NYPD’s scarce resources, and the short duration of the stay I am\nordering, outweigh the benefits to plaintiffs’ putative class of immediately ordering\ncompliance with the Opinion.  I am thus granting a stay of the immediate relief\nordered in Ligon pending the issuance of a final decision regarding the appropriate\n34 See id. at *39 (emphasizing the likely magnitude of unconstitutional\nstops “between now and the completion of trial if this Court does not act”).\n35 See id. at *40–41 (public interest analysis).\n14\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 15 of 20\nscope of preliminary injunctive relief, and the appropriate scope of permanent\ninjunctive relief (if any) in Floyd.  At that time, defendants may move for a stay of\nall remedies ordered if they are so inclined.\nFinally, it is my understanding that the decision to stay the immediate\nrelief ordered in the Opinion moots defendants’ appeal.  No relief is now in effect,\nand there has been no final decision as to the appropriate scope of the relief to be\nordered.36\nB. Defendants’ Request for a Postponement of the Floyd Trial\nDefendants argue that the trial in Floyd should be postponed because\n“[i]t makes little sense . . . to try the Floyd case under a view of the law that is\nincorrect.”37  In their reply letter, defendants cite a five-factor test adopted by the\ndistrict court for determining whether to enter a stay pending an appeal in a related\ncase.38  The factors are:  “(1) the private interests of the plaintiffs in proceeding\nexpeditiously with the civil litigation . . . (2) the private interests of and burden on\n36 See Lynch v. City of New York, 589 F.3d 94, 98 n.1 (2d Cir. 2009)\n(“[T]he courts of appeals have general appellate jurisdiction only over ‘final\ndecisions of the district courts.’” (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1291)).\n37 1/14 Grossman Ltr. at 2.\n38 See 1/17 Grossman Ltr. at 4 (citing Estate of Heiser v. Deutsche Bank\nTrust Co. Ams., No. 11 Civ. 1608, 2012 WL 2865485, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 10,\n2012)).\n15\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 16 of 20\nthe defendants; (3) the interests of the courts; (4) the interests of persons not parties\nto the civil litigation; and (5) the public interest.”39  These factors overlap in some\nrespects with the four factors for determining a stay pending appeal.  Without\nrepeating elements of the analysis offered above, I note that the following\nconsiderations argue against postponing the Floyd trial:\nFirst, plaintiffs in Floyd filed their case on January 31, 2008.  Unlike\nLigon, Floyd is a certified class action challenging the constitutionality of stop and\nfrisk practices in all contexts throughout the City of New York.40  After five years\nof preparation, the trial is scheduled to begin in less than two months.  It would be\nunfair and inappropriate to delay the case any further.  \nSecond, many of the legal issues in Floyd are different from those\ndealt with in the Opinion in Ligon.41  As the Floyd plaintiffs note, their case\naddresses, among other things, “whether minorities are stopped at an\nunconstitutionally disproportionate rate, and whether there is a failure to monitor,\nsupervise, and discipline officers who fail to meet the NYPD’s reporting\n39 Heiser, 2012 WL 2865485, at *3 (quoting LaSala v. Needham & Co.,\n399 F. Supp. 2d 421, 427 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)).\n40 See Floyd v. City of New York, 283 F.R.D. 153, 159 (S.D.N.Y. 2012)\n(granting class certification).  The Ligon preliminary injunction hearing dealt only\nwith stops based on suspicion of trespass outside TAP buildings in the Bronx.\n41 See Ligon, 2013 WL 71800, at *1 n.1.\n16\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 17 of 20\nrequirements for stop-and-frisks.”42\nThird, to the extent that some of the legal issues in Floyd and Ligon\nare the same, appellate review of those issues will be aided by proceeding with the\nFloyd trial without delay.  Counsel in Floyd have not yet been heard on the issues\ndefendants wish to raise on appeal.  By allowing the Ligon preliminary injunction\nhearing to proceed before the Floyd trial,43 this Court recognized that it might be\nnecessary to reach certain generally applicable legal conclusions on the basis of a\npreliminary injunction hearing concerning a relatively narrow range of facts.  I\nconcluded that such a course was appropriate given the long delays in the Floyd\nlitigation and the Ligon plaintiffs’ request for preliminary relief.44  Now that the\nFloyd trial is imminent, there is no reason for the Second Circuit to operate under\nsimilar constraints.  Indeed, if defendants are correct, and the Opinion leads the\nparties in Floyd to pose questions and develop a record that focuses in part on the\nnature of a stop,45 this can only aid review of the very issues that defendants\n42 1/16/13 Letter from Darius Charney, Counsel for Floyd Plaintiffs, to\nthe Court at 2 (footnote omitted).\n43 See Ligon v.

CONCLUSION \nDefendants' request for a stay is granted pending a final decision \nregarding the appropriate scope of preliminary injunctive relief in Ligon. \nDefendants' request for a postponement of the Floyd trial is denied. \nDated:  January 22, 2013 \nNew York, New York \nThe Floyd plaintiffs also argue that if the remedy phase of the Ligon \n46 \nlitigation is stayed pending appeal, the consolidated Floyd-Ligon remedies hearing \nshould be bifurcated from the Floyd trial, or the Floyd remedy phase should be \nseparated from the remedy hearing in Ligon.  See id. at 2.  Because I have not \nstayed the remedy phase of the Ligon litigation, but have only stayed the \nimmediately ordered relief in Ligon pending the completion of the Floyd-Ligon \nremedies hearing, I reject the Floyd plaintiffs' suggestion. \n18 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 99    Filed 01/22/13   Page 19 of 20\n- Appearances -\nFor Ligon Plaintiffs: For Floyd Plaintiffs:\nChristopher Dunn, Esq.

SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J.: \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs, all ofwhom are African-American or Latino residents of \nNew York, allege that the New York Police Department (\"NYPD\") has a \nwidespread practice ofmaking unlawful trespass stops outside buildings in the \n\nBronx that are enrolled in the Trespass Affidavit Program (“TAP”), which was\nformerly known as “Operation Clean Halls.”1  This program allows “police officers\nto patrol inside and around thousands of private residential apartment buildings\nthroughout New York City.”2  Plaintiffs argue that the NYPD’s trespass stops\noutside TAP buildings are often made without reasonable suspicion and, thus,\nviolate the Fourth Amendment.3\nOn September 24, 2012, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary\ninjunction.  Plaintiffs sought an order requiring the NYPD to create and implement\nnew policies, training programs, and monitoring and supervisory procedures that\nspecifically address the problem of unconstitutional trespass stops outside TAP\nbuildings.4   Plaintiffs’ application for a preliminary injunction was granted but  \n1 See Ligon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. 2274, 2012 WL 3597066,\nat *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2012) (allowing preliminary injunction hearing to\nproceed).   Plaintiffs’ Complaint concerns stops in and around TAP buildings\nthroughout New York City, but plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction\nfocused solely on outside stops made in the Bronx.  See id. at *3–4; Memorandum\nof Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (“Pl. Class Mem.”)\nat 1 n.1.\n2 See Ligon, 2012 WL 3597066, at *1.\n3 As the Supreme Court held in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 25 (1968),\neven limited stops and searches must be based on reasonable suspicion.\n4 See Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for\nPreliminary Injunction at 21.\n2\n\nconsideration of the appropriate remedies was deferred pending the remedies\nportion of the Floyd trial.5  However, as for “immediate relief,” the NYPD was\n“ordered immediately to cease performing trespass stops outside TAP buildings in\nthe Bronx without reasonable suspicion of trespass.”6  Defendants requested an\nimmediate stay pending appeal of the January 8, 2013 Opinion.7  Defendants’\nrequest for a stay of the immediate relief was granted on January 22, 2013.8\nEight out of the eleven plaintiffs – Jacqueline Yates, Letitia Ledan,\nRoshea Johnson, Kieron Johnson, Jovan Jefferson, Abdullah Turner, Fernando\nMoronta and Charles Bradley (collectively, “plaintiffs” or “named plaintiffs”) –\nhave sued on behalf of themselves and a class of all others similarly situated. \nPlaintiffs now move for certification of the following class: \nAll individuals who have been or are at risk of being\nstopped  outdoors without legal justification by\n5 Floyd v. City of New York, 08 Civ. 1034 (SAS), is a companion case\nwhich challenges the NYPD’s stop and frisk program more broadly as it involves\nall persons who have been, or may be, subjected to a Terry stop without the pre-\nrequisite finding of reasonable suspicion.  The trial in Floyd is scheduled to begin\non March 18, 2013.\n6 Ligon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. 2274, 2013 WL 71800, at *41\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2013) (the “January 8, 2013 Opinion”).\n7 See Ligon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. 2274, 2013 WL 227654\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2013).\n8 See id. at *1.\n3\n\nNYPD officers on suspicion of trespassing in Bronx\napartment  buildings  enrolled in the NYPD’s\nTrespass Affidavit Program (commonly referred to\nas “Operation Clean Halls”).9\nPlaintiffs seek certification of this more limited preliminary injunction class to\n“ensure that any relief ordered in connection with the preliminary injunction\nmotion will benefit all persons at risk of being subjected to the challenged\npractice.”10  Because plaintiffs have satisfied the legal prerequisites for class\ncertification, their motion is granted.\nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nAt the class certification stage, district courts must engage in a\nrigorous analysis of the underlying facts in order to determine whether plaintiffs\nhave satisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) (“Rule\n23(a)”).  Unless otherwise noted, the following findings are taken from the Court’s\nJanuary 8, 2013 Opinion,11 familiarity with which is assumed, but which will not\n9 Pl. Class Mem. at 2. \n10 Id. at 1 n.1.\n11 Defendants concede that “the Court has a full record from the\nPreliminary Injunction hearing that was recently held in this case from which to\nmake a determination as to whether plaintiffs have met their burden with respect to\nthe commonality and typicality prongs of Rule 23(a) in this case.”  Defendants’\nMemorandum of Law in Opposition to Motion for Class Certification (“Opp.\nMem.”) at 5.  Defendants did not have the benefit of this Court’s preliminary\ninjunction rulings when they prepared their opposition brief, the vast majority of\n4\n\nbe binding on the jury at trial.12\nA. The NYPD’s Stop and Frisk Program \nThe NYPD’s overall stop and frisk program, of which the challenged\nstop and frisk program is a narrow subset, is described in great detail in the class\ncertification ruling in Floyd v. City of New York.13  For purposes of this motion, \nsuffice it to say that “plaintiffs have shown a clear likelihood of proving that\ndefendants have displayed deliberate indifference toward a widespread practice of\nunconstitutional trespass stops by the NYPD outside TAP buildings in the\nBronx.”14\nB. Evidence of Unlawful Stops\nThe Court’s conclusion that plaintiffs will likely prove at trial that the\nNYPD has a practice of making unlawful trespass stops outside of TAP buildings\nin the Bronx was based on five categories of evidence presented at the preliminary\nwhich was spent rearguing the merits of the preliminary injunction motion.  But\nthis is not a motion for reconsideration and this Court’s prior factual\ndeterminations are not subject to review.  Accordingly, much of defendants’\nopposition to the instant motion has been mooted by the January 8, 2013 Opinion.\n12 See Miles v. Merrill Lynch & Co. (In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec.\nLitig.) (“IPO”), 471 F.3d 24, 42 (2d Cir. 2006).\n13 See 283 F.R.D. 153, 162-67 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).\n14 Ligon, 2013 WL 71800, at *2.  See id. at *23, *28.\n5\n\ninjunction hearing.  Although each category of evidence is discussed at length in\nthe January 8, 2013 Opinion, the relevant evidence is summarized as follows:\n(1) the testimony of Bronx Assistant District Attorney\nJeannette Rucker (“ADA Rucker”), who concluded that the\nNYPD  frequently m ade  trespass stops outside TAP\nbuildings in the Bronx for no reason other than that the\nofficer had seen someone enter and exit or exit the building;\n(2) a sample of “decline to prosecute” forms prepared by\nthe Bronx District Attorneys’ Office, which revealed the\nalarming  frequency of unlawful trespass stops in the\nvicinity of TAP buildings in the Bronx; (3) the testimony of\neight plaintiffs and a non-pa rty witness, who described\nremarkably  similar  encounters with the police when\nstopped in the vicinity of TAP buildings in the Bronx; (4)\nthe analysis by Dr. Jeffrey Fagan, plaintiffs’ expert, of an\nNYPD database of recorded stops, which provided further\nevidence of the frequency of apparently unlawful trespass\nstops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx; and (5) NYPD\ntraining materials that continue to mis state the minimal\nconstitutional standards for making stops.15\nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS\nA.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)\nRule 23(a) permits individuals to sue as representatives of an\naggrieved class.  To be certified, a putative class must first meet all four\nprerequisites set forth in Rule 23(a), generally referred to as numerosity,\n15 Id. at *2.\n6\n\ncommonality, typicality, and adequacy.16  District courts have broad discretion in\ndeciding whether to certify a proposed class under Rule 23.17   Furthermore, the\nSecond Circuit has directed that Rule 23 “‘should be given a liberal rather than a\nrestrictive interpretation’ in order to vindicate small federal claims.”18\n“Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard.  A party seeking\nclass certification must affirmatively demonstrate [its] compliance with the Rule –\nthat is, [it] must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous\nparties, common questions of law or fact, etc.”19  Plaintiffs seeking class\ncertification bear the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence\nthat the proposed class meets each of the requirements set forth in Rule 23(a).20 \n16 See Teamsters Local 445 Freight Div. Pension Fund v. Bombardier\nInc., 546 F.3d 196, 201-02 (2d Cir. 2008) (“Teamsters”).  In full, Rule 23(a) reads:\n“Prerequisites. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as\nrepresentative parties on behalf of all members only if: (1) the class is so numerous\nthat joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact\ncommon to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will\nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.” \n17 See Parker v. Time Warner Entm’t Co. L.P., 331 F.3d 13, 28 (2d Cir.\n2003).\n18 Zahn v. International Paper Co., 469 F.2d 1033, 1035 (2d Cir. 1972)\n(quoting Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 391 F.2d 555, 563 (2d Cir. 1968)).\n19 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes (“Wal-Mart”), 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551\n(2011) (emphasis in original). \n20 See Teamsters, 546 F.3d at 202.\n7\n\nWhen assessing whether plaintiffs have met this burden, courts must take into\naccount “all of the relevant evidence admitted at the class certification stage.”21  A\ncourt may certify a class only after determining that “whatever underlying facts are\nrelevant to a particular Rule 23 requirement have been established.”22  This\nrigorous analysis requires examining the facts of the dispute, not merely the\npleadings, and it will frequently “entail some overlap with the merits of the\nplaintiff’s underlying claim.”23 \nEven before the Supreme Court articulated this standard in the Wal-\nMart decision, the Second Circuit had “required district courts ‘to assess all of the\nrelevant evidence admitted at the class certification stage’” and to apply “the\npreponderance of the evidence standard” when resolving factual disputes relevant\nto each of the Rule 23 requirements.24  At the class certification stage, “a district\njudge should not assess any aspect of the merits unrelated to a Rule 23\n21 IPO, 471 F.3d at 42.\n22 Id. at 41.\n23 Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551.  “Nor is there anything unusual about\nthat consequence: The necessity of touching aspects of the merits in order to\nresolve preliminary matters, e.g., jurisdiction and venue, is a familiar feature of\nlitigation.”  Id. at 2552.\n24 Teamsters, 546 F.3d at 202 (quoting IPO, 471 F.3d at 42).\n8\n\nrequirement.”25  The court’s “determination as to a Rule 23 requirement is made\nonly for purposes of class certification and is not binding on the trier of facts, even\nif that trier is the class certification judge.”26\n1. Numerosity\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that a class be “so numerous that joinder of all\nmembers is impracticable.”  In the Second Circuit, sufficient numerosity can be\npresumed at a level of forty members or more.27  “The numerosity requirement in\nRule 23(a)(1) does not mandate that joinder of all parties be impossible – only that\nthe difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members of the class make use of the\nclass action appropriate.”28  Courts do not require “evidence of exact class size or\nidentity of class members to satisfy the numerosity requirement.”29\n25 Shahriar v. Smith & Wollensky Rest. Grp., Inc., 659 F.3d 234, 251 (2d\nCir. 2011) (quotation marks and citation omitted).  Courts must ensure “that a class\ncertification motion does not become a pretext for a partial trial of the merits.” \nIPO, 471 F.3d at 41.\n26 IPO, 471 F.3d at 41.\n27 See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473, 483\n(2d Cir. 1995) (holding that “numerosity is presumed at a level of 40 members”).\n28 Central States Se. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund v. Merck-\nMedco Managed Care, LLC, 504 F.3d 229, 244-45 (2d Cir. 2007).\n29 Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 (2d Cir. 1993).\n9\n\n2. Commonality\nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common\nto the class.”  Commonality thus requires plaintiffs “to demonstrate that the class\nmembers ‘have suffered the same injury.’”30  Commonality further requires that the\nclaims asserted “must depend upon a common contention . . . of such a nature that\nit is capable of classwide resolution – which means that determination of its truth\nor falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the\nclaims in one stroke.”31  \nIn Wal-Mart, plaintiffs sought to certify a class of approximately a\nmillion and a half female employees of the retail giant, alleging that “the discretion\nexercised by their local supervisors over pay and promotion violates Title VII by\ndiscriminating against women.”32  The Supreme Court found that the plaintiffs had\nfailed to satisfy commonality because the putative class members were subjected to\nan enormous array of different employment practices:  \nPay  and prom otion  decisions at Wal-Mart are\ngenerally  committed  to local m anagers’  broad\ndiscretion . . . .  Local store m anagers may [make\n30 Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (quoting General Tel. Co. of Sw. v.\nFalcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 (1982)).\n31 Id.\n32 Id. at 2547.\n10\n\nwage  decisions]  with only lim ited  corporate\noversight . . . . Wal-Mart has no testing procedure or\nother companywide evaluation method that can be\ncharged with bias.  The whole point of perm itting\ndiscretionary decisionmaking is to avoid evaluating\nemployees under a common standard . . . . Other than\nthe  bare existence of   delegated discretion,\nrespondents have identified no ‘specific employment\npractice’  – m uch  less one that ties all their 1.5\nmillion claims together.33 \n3. Typicality\n“Typicality ‘requires that the claims of the class representatives be\ntypical of those of the class, and is satisfied when each class member’s claim arises\nfrom the same course of events[] and each class member makes similar legal\narguments to prove the defendant’s liability.’”34  Rather than focusing on the\nprecise nature of plaintiffs’ injuries, the typicality requirement may be satisfied\nwhere “injuries derive from a unitary course of conduct by a single system.”35  \nThe purpose of typicality is to ensure that class representatives “have\nthe incentive to prove all the elements of the cause of action which would be\npresented by the individual members of the class were they initiating\n33 Id. at 2547, 2553, 2555.\n34 Central States, 504 F.3d at 245 (quoting Robinson v. Metro-N.\nCommuter R.R. Co., 267 F.3d 147, 155 (2d Cir. 2001)).\n35 Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 377 (2d Cir. 1997).\n11\n\nindividualized actions.”36  A lack of typicality may be found in cases where the\nnamed plaintiff “was not harmed by the [conduct] he alleges to have injured the\nclass”37 or the named plaintiff’s claim is subject to “specific factual defenses”\natypical of the class.38\n4. Adequacy\n“Adequacy is twofold: the proposed class representative must have an\ninterest in vigorously pursuing the claims of the class, and must have no interests\nantagonistic to the interests of other class members.”39  Thus, the question of\nadequacy “entails inquiry as to whether: 1) plaintiffs’ interests are antagonistic to\nthe interest of other members of the class and 2) plaintiffs’ attorneys are qualified,\nexperienced and able to conduct the litigation.”40  In order to defeat a motion for\ncertification, any conflicts between the class representative and members of the\n36 In re NASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., 169 F.R.D. 493, 510\n(S.D.N.Y. 1996).\n37 Newman v.

Deutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253, 268 (2d Cir. 2006).\n40 Baffa v. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Sec. Corp., 222 F.3d 52, 60 (2d\nCir. 2000).\n12\n\nputative class must be “fundamental.”41\n5. Implied Requirement of Ascertainability\nSome courts have added an “implied requirement of ascertainability”42\nto the express requirements of Rule 23(a).  These courts have refused to certify a\nclass “unless the class description is sufficiently definite so that it is\nadministratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular individual\nis a member.”43  However, where the primary relief sought is injunctive rather than\ncompensatory, as here, “it is not clear that the implied requirement of definiteness\nshould apply to Rule 23(b)(2) class actions at all.”44 \nB. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2)\nIf the requirements of Rule 23(a) are met, the court “must next\ndetermine whether the class can be maintained under any one of the three\nsubdivisions of Rule 23(b).”45  Plaintiffs seek certification under Federal Rule of\n41 In re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. Sec. Litig., 574 F.3d 29, 35 (2d Cir.\n2009).\n42 IPO, 471 F.3d at 30.\n43 Casale v. Kelly, 257 F.R.D. 396, 406 (S.D.N.Y. 2009).\n44 William B. Rubenstein et al., Newberg on Class Actions § 3:7 at 1-\n172 (2011).\n45 McLaughlin v. American Tobacco Co., 522 F.3d 215, 222 (2d Cir.\n2008).\n13\n\nCivil Procedure 23(b)(2) (“Rule 23(b)(2)”).  To certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2),\nplaintiffs must show that defendants “acted or refused to act on grounds that apply\ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\nrelief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  As the Supreme Court\nexplained in Wal-Mart, Rule 23(b)(2) is intended to cover cases such as this one:\nWhen  a class seeks an indivisible injunction\nbenefitting all its members at once, there is no reason\nto undertake a case-specific inquiry into whether\nclass issues predominate or whether class action is a\nsuperior  method  of adjudicating the dispute.\nPredominance and superiority are self-evident.46\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Plaintiffs Have Standing to Seek Injunctive Relief\nArticle III of the Constitution requires that a federal court entertain a\nlawsuit only if the plaintiffs have standing to pursue the relief that they seek. \nConcrete injury is a prerequisite to standing and a “plaintiff seeking injunctive or\ndeclaratory relief cannot rely on past injury to satisfy the injury requirement but\nmust show a likelihood that he or she will be injured in the future.”47\n46 131 S. Ct. at 2558.  Accord Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S.\n591, 614 (1997) (“Civil rights cases against parties charged with unlawful,\nclass-based discrimination are prime examples” of Rule 23(b)(2) class actions). \n47 Deshawn v. Safir, 156 F.3d 340, 344 (2d Cir. 1998) (citing City of Los\nAngeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105-06 (1983)).\n14\n\nThe Supreme Court emphasized this requirement in City of Los\nAngeles v. Lyons, when it held that Lyons, who had been subjected to a dangerous\nchokehold by a Los Angeles police officer, did not have standing to pursue an\ninjunction against the police department’s practice of using chokeholds because his\npast injury “does nothing to establish a real and immediate threat that he would\nagain be stopped for a traffic violation, or for any other offense, by an officer or\nofficers who would illegally choke him into unconsciousness without any\nprovocation or resistance on his part.”48 \nDefendants argue that plaintiffs lack standing because “no plaintiff\ncan demonstrate more than one past improper stop of the type raised by plaintiffs\nupon this motion and only two plaintiffs, Abdullah Turner and Letitia Ledan, even\ntestified to two incidents. . . . [N]either of these plaintiffs can demonstrate the\nrequisite two or more improper stops of the type raised by plaintiffs upon their\nmotion.”49  The issue of standing was addressed in the January 8, 2013 Opinion,\nwhich states in relevant part:\nAbdullah Turner . . . testified to two specific unlawful\ntrespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx, and J.G.\nand Jovan Jefferson both referred to having been stopped\nmultiple times outside TAP buildings. . . .  Turner has lived\n48 Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105.\n49 Opp. Mem. at 25.\n15\n\nsince 2008 in a TAP building,w  here, based on the evidence\npresented at the hearing, he will likely  be the target of\nfuture unlawful stops – if such stops continue to take place\nas  they have in the past.  This is sufficient to confer\nstanding on plaintiffs.50\n“The possibility of recurring injury ceases to be speculative when actual repeated\nincidents are documented.”51  Furthermore, the frequency of alleged injuries\ninflicted by the practice at issue here creates a likelihood of future injury sufficient\nto address any standing concerns.52  In the face of the NYPD’s widespread\npractices outside of TAP buildings, Turner’s risk of future injury is “‘real and\nimmediate,’ not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’”53  Because Turner satisfies the\n50 Ligon, 2013 WL 71800, at *27 (footnotes omitted).

Commonality and Typicality\nIn practice, the “commonality and typicality requirements of Rule\n23(a) tend to merge.”55  Accordingly, defendants address the commonality and\ntypicality requirements together.56  Defendants’ sole argument is that plaintiffs do\nnot meet the commonality and typicality requirements because they have not\nproven that an “unconstitutional custom or practice of the City actually exists with\nrespect to stops outdoors of [TAP] enrolled buildings where trespass is the\nsuspected crime.”57   In the January 8, 2013 Opinion, I ruled that “plaintiffs offered\n54 See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547\nU.S. 47, 53 n.2 (2006) (noting that “[t]he Court of Appeals did not determine\nwhether the other plaintiffs have standing because the presence of one party with\nstanding is sufficient to satisfy Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement.”). \n55 Wal–Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 n.5.  Accord Marisol A., 126 F.3d at 376 \n(stating that commonality and typicality “tend to merge into one another, so that\nsimilar considerations animate analysis of Rules 23(a)(2) and (3)”).\n56 Defendants did not have the advantage of this Court’s rulings with\nregard to the preliminary injunction motion when they filed their opposition brief. \n57 See Opp. Mem. at 5 (“Defendants assert that based on the following\nevidence adduced at the PI hearing, plaintiffs have not met their burden with\nrespect to the existence of an unconstitutional practice, therefore . . .  their motion\nfor class certification must be denied since there is no ‘glue’ to unify the claims of\n17\n\nmore than enough evidence at the hearing to support the conclusion that they have\nshown a clear likelihood of proving at trial that the NYPD has a practice of making\nunlawful trespass stops outside of TAP buildings in the Bronx[.]”58  For purposes\nof class certification, therefore, plaintiffs have adequately established the\nlikelihood of an unconstitutional stop and frisk practice on the part of the NYPD.59  \nIn sum, plaintiffs and the putative class members were allegedly\nsubjected to the same unlawful conduct by NYPD officers under the auspices of a\nsingle NYPD program: unjustified Terry stops, not supported by reasonable\nsuspicion, occurring outdoors in the vicinity of TAP buildings in the Bronx on\nsuspicion of trespass.  Thus, plaintiffs readily meet the commonality requirement\nthe named plaintiffs with the putative class, as well as the claims of the class\nrepresentatives themselves[.]”).\n58 Ligon, 2013 Wl 71800, at *28.\n59 Plaintiffs do not have the burden of proving the existence of an\nunconstitutional practice or custom at the class certification stage.  They do,\nhowever, have the burden of proving the existence of common factual and legal\nissues.  See Mitchell v. County of Clinton, No. 8:06-CV-00254, 2007 WL 1988716,\nat *2 (N.D.N.Y. July 5, 2007) (“Plaintiff has shown the existence of legal and\nfactual issues common to all proposed members of the proposed class, i.e., what\nstrip search policy and practice existed, whether the policy and/or practice were\nunconstitutional, and whether some or all of the defendants are liable.”); Barnes v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 242 F.R.D. 113, 122 (D.D.C. 2007) (“The same common\nquestions . . . are present in this case and satisfy the commonality requirement,\nsuch as whether the overdetention and strip search practices were municipal\npolicies and whether either violated the Constitution.”).\n18\n\nas described in Wal-Mart – i.e., the plaintiffs’ claims and the class member claims\n“depend upon a common contention . . . of such a nature that it is capable of\nclasswide resolution – which means that determination of its truth or falsity will\nresolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one\nstroke.”60  Furthermore, because the experiences of the named plaintiffs are\nidentical to those of the proposed class, the typicality requirement is also met.61\n60 Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551.  Since Wal-Mart, at least three district\ncourts have granted class certification in cases alleging constitutional violations\ndue to a police department’s policy and/or practice of making unlawful stops and\narrests.  See Stinson v. City of New York, 282 F.R.D. 360, 363 (S.D.N.Y. 2012)\n(“Plaintiffs allege that the NYPD is engaged in a widespread pattern and practice\nof issuing summonses to individuals without probable cause and that NYPD\nofficers are explicitly instructed to issue summonses regardless of whether any\ncrime or violation has occurred in order to meet a minimum quota requirement set\nforth by the NYPD.”);  Ortega-Melendres v. Arpaio, No. 07 Civ. 2513, 2011 WL\n6740711, at *19 (D. Ariz. Dec. 23, 2011) (certifying class of Latino motorists\nalleging racial profiling and finding that differences in subjective motivations of\nofficers do not defeat commonality or typicality when there is evidence of a\ndepartmental policy of violating constitutional rights);  Morrow v. City of Tenaha,\nNo. 08 Civ. 288, 2011 WL 3847985, at *192-94 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 29, 2011)\n(certifying class of Latinos who were stopped for alleged traffic violations and\nfinding commonality in light of statistical evidence showing significant increases\nin the number of minorities stopped after the adoption of a new police policy). \n61 See Stinson, 282 F.R.D. at 371 (finding typicality requirement met\nwhere claims of named plaintiffs and class members stemmed from a “sole theory\nof liability” regarding a particular NYPD practice).\n19\n\n2. Numerosity\nIn conclusory fashion, defendants argue that “[i]n the absence of\ncommonality and typicality, plaintiffs cannot establish numerosity either.”62  As\nDr. Fagan’s testimony clearly establishes, the number of class members will run\ninto the hundreds, if not thousands.  Plaintiffs have therefore satisfied numerosity.\n3. Adequacy\nDefendants argue that plaintiffs fail to meet the adequacy requirement\nbecause “[t]here are several unique defenses to the named plaintiffs’ claims that\ndefendants submit will defeat said claims and will subsume this litigation\nconcerning said claims, i.e., the failure to specify the dates of incident and identify\nthe officers involved, as well as in some cases whether the purported stop was even\nfor trespass or outside of the premises of TAP enrolled buildings.”63  Defendants’\nargument is unavailing for several reasons.  First, “courts and juries must always\nconsider defendants’ individual defenses before determining liability.  That is no\nbar at the certification stage.”64  “In practice, courts in this Circuit . . . [refuse]\ncertification only when confronted with a sufficiently clear showing” that a defense\n62 Opp. Mem. at 23.\n63 Id. at 24.\n64 Floyd, 283 F.R.D. at 175-76.\n20\n\nunique to the representative plaintiff’s claims will in fact defeat those claims.65  \nSecond, the doctrine of unique defenses is intended to protect absent\nmembers of the plaintiff class by ensuring the presence of a typical plaintiff.66  The\ndoctrine is not meant to protect defendants by permitting them to defeat class\ncertification because the facts raised by the claims of the named plaintiffs are not\nidentical to the facts raised by the claims of all putative class members.  Because\nthe named plaintiffs’ claims arise from the same practice and same general set of\nfacts as do the claims of the putative class members, the adequacy prong is\nsatisfied.67 \n65       In re Omnicom Grp., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 02 Civ. 4483, 2007 WL\n1280640, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2007) (explaining that the court “need not deny\ncertification merely because of the presence of a colorable unique defense”). \n66 “‘The unique defense rule, however, is not rigidly applied in this\nCircuit,’ and is ‘intended to protect [the] plaintiff class – not to shield defendants\nfrom a potentially meritorious suit.’” Duling v. Gristede’s Operating Corp., 267\nF.R.D. 86, 97 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (quoting In re NYSE Specialists Sec. Litig., 260\nF.R.D. 55, 71 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (alteration in original)).  Accord Sirota v. Solitron\nDevices, Inc., 673 F.2d 566, 571 (2d Cir. 1982) (“If . . . defendants were arguing\nthat a district court must determine whether the named plaintiffs have a meritorious\nclaim before they can be certified as class representatives, they would plainly be\nwrong.”).\n67 See Central States, 504 F.3d at 245; Daniels, 198 F.R.D. at 419.\n21\n\n4. Ascertainability\nRule 23 does not demand ascertainability.  The requirement is a\njudicial creation meant to ensure that class definitions are workable when members\nof the class will be entitled to damages or require notice for another reason.68\nDefendants oppose class certification on the basis of ascertainability for three\nreasons: “first, plaintiffs’ definition is so vague, particularly the portion that reads,\n‘all individuals who have been or are at risk of being stopped outdoors without\nlegal justification . . .,’ that it can never be determined who is a class member. \nSecond, should the Court determine that the size of the class affects the relief\nsought, the proposed definition could be important.  Third, mini-trials would be\nrequired to determine who is properly a class member.”69 \nI agree that the class definition, as proposed, is too vague to enable a\nproper determination of who is a class member.  In certifying the class, the class\ndefinition must be amended as follows:\nAll individuals who have been  or are at risk of being\nstopped outdoors within the vicinity of  Bronx apartment\nbuildings  enrolled in the NYPD’s Trespass Affidavit\nProgram  (commonly  referred to as “Operation Clean\nHalls”) without legal justification by NYPD officers on\n68 See IPO, 471 F.3d at 30. \n69 Opp. Mem. at 25.\n22\n\nsuspicion of trespassing in said buildings.70\nWhile this Court need not tarry long with the question of ascertainability, the\ngeneral demarcations of the proposed class – those people unlawfully stopped or\nwho may be stopped by the NYPD outside of TAP buildings in the Bronx – are\nclear enough to make the proposed class sufficiently ascertainable for purpose of\nRule 23(b)(2).\n  C. Rule 23(b)(2)\nDefendants oppose certification under Rule 23(b)(2) on the same\nground raised with regard to commonality and typicality, namely, “[b]ecause\nplaintiffs have not met their burden of demonstrating an unlawful custom or\npractice as alleged, they cannot demonstrate that the City ‘has acted or refused to\nact on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.’”71  \nBecause this argument failed with respect to commonality and typicality, it cannot\nbar certification under Rule 23(b)(2).  In any event, as noted above, the Supreme\nCourt explained in Wal-Mart that Rule 23(b)(2) is intended to cover cases such as\nthis one:\n70 See Pl. Class Mem. at 2 (emphasis added).\n71 Opp. Mem. at 24 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)).\n23\n\nWhen a class seeks an indivisible injunction benefitting all \nits  members  at once,  there  is  no reason to  undertake  a \ncase-specific inquiry into whether class issues predominate \nor whether class action is a superior method ofadjudicating \nthe  dispute.  Predominance  and  superiority  are \nself-evident.\n72 \nIn sum, because plaintiffs have met the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b)(2), I \nhereby certify the proposed class, as modified above. \nv.  CONCLUSION \nBecause plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Rule 23, their \nmotion for class certification solely for the purpose of preliminary injunctive relief \nis granted.

Because \nof the COVID-19 pandemic, that study is now not advisable.  Accordingly, on December 14, \n2020 and January 27, 2021, the Monitor made submissions asking this Court to vacate its \nJuly 19, 2018, August 9, 2018, and February 7, 2019 orders and, in their place, enter a new order \nrequiring two things.  ECF Nos. 805, 816.  First, the Monitor requested that the new order \nrequire the City to implement the plan it developed to make some of the policy changes that the \nCombined Pilot would have studied (the “Alternative Plan”), which is detailed in the City’s \nFebruary 21, 2020, August 18, 2020, and September 9, 2020 letters included as Appendix 1 to \nthe Monitor’s December 14, 2020 submission and as Exhibit A to this order.  Second, the \nMonitor requested that the new order require the City to give full support to certain studies \ndesigned to capture information that the Combined Pilot would have developed (the “Proposed \nStudies”), which are described in the memoranda included as Appendix 2 to the Monitor’s \nDecember 14, 2020 submission and as Exhibit B to this order. \nThe Alternative Plan has two principal parts.  First, it will require NYPD officers \ncitywide to activate their BWCs for first-level encounters, except when officers have those \nencounters (a) in situations that the NYPD has designated as “do not record” situations; (b) while \naddressing motor vehicle accidents; (c) in situations where a person requires medical assistance, \nexcept that the involvement of an emotionally disturbed person is not a reason for not recording; \nor (d) while taking reports on past crimes.  Second, it will require officers to manually enter \ninformation into a form on evidence.com: for first-level encounters, officers must enter the level \nof the encounter; for second-level encounters, officers must enter the level of the encounter, the \nrace and gender of the primary person encountered, and whether multiple persons were \nencountered.  The manually entered information supplements the information that will be \ncaptured by the BWC recordings: date, time, officer information, command, and length of \nrecording. \nThe Proposed Studies will principally examine officers’ compliance with applicable legal \nrequirements in police-citizen encounters, racial disparities in officers’ compliance and \nescalation in those encounters, and whether those encounters are appropriately documented.  As \nwith the Combined Pilot, the Proposed Studies can succeed only if the City embraces them by \npaying for all of their reasonable costs and fully supporting them as the Monitor directs. \nTogether, the Alternative Plan and Proposed Studies are an appropriate and adequate \nsubstitute for the Combined Pilot in light of the circumstances, for the reasons articulated in the \nMonitor’s December 14, 2020 and January 27, 2021 submissions.  Accordingly, it is hereby \nORDERED that: \n1. This Court’s July 19, 2018, August 9, 2018, and February 7, 2019 orders requiring\nstudies of potential documentation and recording requirements are VACATED.\n2. The Alternative Plan, described in the letters attached as Exhibit A to this order, is\nAPPROVED, and the City is ordered to implement the requirements of that Plan.\n2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 3 of 40\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 4 of 40\nExhibit A\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 5 of 40\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 6 of 40\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 7 of 40\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 8 of 40\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 9 of 40\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 10 of 40\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 11 of 40\nTHE CITY OF NEW YORK \nLAW DEPARTMENT \nJAMES E.

The sample will be drawn in \ntwo waves with the first including approximately 1,500 encounters that will be reviewed by \nlegal experts and the second approximately 1,000 encounters. The initial sample will capture a \nrandom sample of encounters that both ISLG and the Stanford team will utilize to answer \nprimary research questions. In contrast, the second sample will be targeted in order to facilitate \nthe use of machine learning techniques to identify Level 3 encounters. The following memo \noutlines core elements of the sampling plan. The sample will be drawn after the NYPD \nimplements the two proposed policies that expand body worn camera (BWC) recording and \ncategorization of encounters.   \nThe sampling framework in the revised study differs substantially from that of the Combined \nPilot because of fundamental changes to the research design.  The Combined Pilot was a cluster \nrandomized experiment testing the efficacy of two policy changes. As such, sampling was built \naround the selection of 16 commands for treatment and control and selecting 168 officer tours \nfor observation across the selected commands. In contrast, the revised study is an \nobservational study, which eliminates the need to focus on a limited number of comparable \ncommands for treatment and control. Selection of encounters (rather than commands or tours) \npermits the direct selection of a much larger number of observations, which reduces the \nnecessity of employing certain tactics such as stratification.  \nSample 1 \nBoth the ISLG and Stanford teams’ studies require a random sample of police citizen \nencounters that are De Bour Level 2 and above.4  Observations will be randomly selected from \nthe universe of encounters recorded by officers on their BWCs. The sample will be \nrepresentative of police encounters with citizens in New York City that rise above Level 1.5 In a \n1 Kathleen Doherty, Reagan Daly and Li Sian Goh. \n2 Nick Camp, Jennifer Eberhardt, and Rob Voigt. \n3 This memo specifically concerns the procedure to sample interactions to be reviewed by expert judges. \nAdditional encounters or alternative sampling regimes (e.g., conditioned on citizen complaints or consent \nsearches) may be necessary by ISLG or Stanford for questions that do not require legal expert judgments. \n4 Within an encounter, there may be interaction with multiple citizens. Legal experts will consider the legality of \nthe officer’s actions with regard to each citizen who interacts with the officer. \n5 There is one exception. Officers who consistently turn on their camera less or fail to turn on their BWC in a timely \nmanner will be underrepresented in the study. This is only problematic if failing to turn on the BWC is associated \nwith legally non-compliant behavior. \n1 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 15 of 40\nsample drawn from encounters, active officers will have more presence, because they engage \nin more encounters. This contrasts with a selection process based on officers, which is \ngeneralizable to the average officer. The proposed sample, however, will be more \nrepresentative of the encounters, which will permit us to speak directly to how citizens \nexperience policing.  \nThe sample will include only encounters that reach Level 2 and above. Such a sample will \ngenerate more information on encounters that raise Fourth Amendment concerns relative to a \nsimple random sample. The sample will also be more squarely focused on the Monitorship’s \nmission of reducing unconstitutional Level 3 encounters. Without limiting the sample in this \nway, legal experts will review many encounters that do not raise constitutional concerns. As a \nresult, we will have less information on more invasive encounters, which could leave us in a \nposition where we cannot speak meaningfully to important questions about escalation or racial \ndisparities. \nTiming of Sampling \nAs mentioned above, the revised study will be executed after the NYPD has implemented its \nproposed policies of categorizing encounters and recording almost all encounters on BWCs. \nThere will likely be a period of time where officers become accustomed to implementing the \nnew policies. In consequence, we plan to commence data collection 4 weeks after the new \npolicies take effect. This provides officers an adjustment period before data collection begins. \nSelection will occur over an 8 week period. It is important to collect data over a period of time \nthat is sufficiently long in order to minimize the influence of idiosyncratic events on the results. \nWhile improving the quality of the data collection, a longer time frame will increase the amount \nof time necessary to complete the study. To minimize delay, we propose to randomly select \nencounters at four points throughout the 8 week study period. One advantage to this approach \nis that ISLG and the Stanford team can begin coding, matching relevant reports, and \ntranscribing encounters without having to wait until the conclusion of the study period.  \nStratification \nIn the alternative to the Combined Pilot, it will be no longer necessary to stratify based on \nofficer or precinct characteristics. The sampling regime will use stratification to address two \ndistinct issues. First, we will stratify by officer categorization of De Bour level as a mechanism \nfor including review of encounters labeled Level 1. Second, the study will stratify by citizen race \nto support our ability to detect disparities in officer behavior. \nRandom selection of encounters will produce a sample that reflects the population as the \nnumber of observations selected increases. Approximately 1,500 encounters Level 2 and above \nwill ultimately be selected. As a result, encounters may be randomly selected without \nstratification on officer unit or command characteristics while yielding a sample where officer \n2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 16 of 40\nunits and commands will be approximately representative of their presence in the pool of \nencounters.6   \nBoth the Stanford and ISLG studies will analyze encounters that reach Level 2 or above. \nIdentifying a sample that excludes Level 1 is challenging. Researchers will have access to officer \ncategorization of the De Bour level for each encounter, but officer categorization will be an \nimperfect indicator of the actual De Bour level if officers err in their identification of the De \nBour level. It is not feasible to take a simple random sample of all De Bour levels because of the \nfrequency with which we expect Level 1 encounters to occur. Level 1 encounters would \ncomprise the vast majority of the sample and review of those encounters would be costly and \nan inefficient use of legal experts’ expertise.  \nTo address concerns related to officer miscategorization more efficiently, the study will stratify \nthe sample selection by the officer’s labeling of the De Bour level. This strategy permits the \nselection of a random sample of encounters labeled Level 2, 3 or 4 and a smaller random \nsample of encounters labeled Level 1.7 The selected Level 1 encounters will be screened to \ndetermine whether each could plausibly be a higher level encounter. ISLG in consultation with \nthe Stanford team will develop a coding protocol for identifying encounters that are clearly \nLevel 1. Any encounter that potentially rises above Level 1 will be included in the sample sent to \nlegal experts. If legal experts determine that the De Bour level is 2 or above, the encounter will \nbe included in the analyses. This approach ensures that a sample of encounters labeled Level 1 \nby officers are reviewed to determine whether they are in fact a higher level while limiting the \ncosts associated with reviewing every Level 1 encounter captured in a random sample. This \napproach will also help the team ascertain, on a department wide basis, the frequency with \nwhich higher level encounters are miscategorized as Level 1 encounters.  \nThere is one key issue associated with this approach. If encounters that were miscategorized as \nLevel 1 differ significantly in compliance, escalation, and documentation from encounters that \nwere accurately categorized, the results will not be representative of the city. Stratifying sample \nselection by the officer’s labeling of the De Bour level may provide a skewed sample because \nLevel 1 will be sampled below their prevalence in the actual universe of encounters. The extent \nto which stratifying sample selection by officer categorization skews the sample depends on the \nfrequency with which higher level encounters are miscategorized as Level 1. To address this \n6 Stratification by officer unit and characteristics of the command were particularly important in the Combined \nPilot, because only 16 commands and 168 officers were selected for observation. As a result, a random sample was \nvery likely going to be unrepresentative of the population. \n7 The number of encounters selected in each group has not yet been determined. There are two issues that affect \nthe number of encounters selected: 1) the percent of BWC recordings that are be usable, 2) the rate of \nmiscategorization of Level 1 encounters. For example, incomplete recordings will not be sent to judges for review. \nIf recordings are often incomplete, then we may need to increase the number of encounters selected to ensure \nthat we reach 1,500 encounters for legal expert review.  We also do not know the rate of encounters that are \nmiscategorized as Level 1 but are, in fact, Level 2 or above. If encounters are frequently miscategorized then we \nmay need to select fewer encounters, because more of the encounters selected will be sent to legal experts. After \nthe NYPD has implemented the new policy, there will necessarily be a pilot period where we examine BWC \nrecordings and assess the appropriate number of encounters for selection in each group.  \n3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 17 of 40\nskew, the sample of higher level encounters miscategorized as Level 1 can be weighted based \non estimates of their frequency.   \nStratification by citizen race will increase the ability of both studies to discern racial disparities \nin analyses on compliance, escalation and procedural justice. In a random sample of encounters \nof approximately 1,500 police encounters, there may be too few encounters with white or \nAsian citizens captured in the sample to discern differences by citizen race. In 2019, black and \nHispanic citizens constituted 89 percent of Level 3 encounters and 79 percent of arrests.8 If we \nassume that citizens in Level 2 encounters exhibit a similar racial identity, there may be too few \nencounters with white or Asian citizens to meaningfully detect differences in legal compliance \nor officer language. This poses the danger that the study may find no evidence of racial \ndisparities even if disparities are present, because the analysis is underpowered.   \nThe primary means of addressing this issue is to stratify by citizen race, as labeled by officer, \nwhere such data are available.9 We will select white and Asian citizens at a higher rate than \ntheir expected presence in a random sample to enhance our ability to detect differences across \nracial groups. While it may be counterintuitive to oversample white and Asian citizens when \ninvestigating Fourteenth Amendment violations, there must be sufficient encounters in each \nracial group to be able to discern meaningful differences. A very large increase in sample size of \nthe study would also increase statistical power, but stratification is a more efficient means of \nincreasing our ability to detect disparities without dramatically increasing the size and cost of \nthe study. We will conduct power analysis to determine the appropriate numbers of encounters \nby race to include in the sample, taking care to oversample only to the minimum extent \nnecessary.10  We note that this will be difficult to implement if the NYPD’s categorization of \nLevel 2 encounters does not include information on citizen race.  \nStratification by citizen race may have implications for the interpretation of results. For \nexample, if whites are oversampled and encounters with white citizens are more likely to be \ncompliant, the compliance rate of the sample will not be an accurate representation of \ncompliance in the city. Fortunately, it is possible to address this issue by weighting encounters \nof different racial groups to reflect their presence in the population of encounters when \nproducing estimates for compliance city wide. Stratification can facilitate disparities analysis \nwithout detracting from the generalizability of the study to the city.  \nSelection Process \nThe NYPD has a record of Level 3 and 4 encounters as well as some Level 2 encounters (those \nwith a consent search) through reports submitted by officers. Under the NYPD’s proposal for \ndocumentation, there will be no database of information on all police citizen encounters Level \n8 The data on Level 3 encounters were provided by the Monitor team and the data on arrests were found on NYC \nOpen Data.  \n9 Citizens’ racial identification may differ from officers’ perception of their race; however, officers’ perception of \nrace is more germane to questions of racial disparities in legal compliance and disrespect. \n10 We note that parity in the presence of racial groups is not necessary to be able to detect differences. \n4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 18 of 40\n2 and above. Most Level 2 encounters will be documented only in the BWC system, unless the \nNYPD adopts a combined Level 2/Level 3 form.  An investigative encounter form that \ndocuments both Level 2 and Level 3 encounters would be advisable, unless it would create \ninsurmountable logistical or operational concerns. Without a combined Level2/Level 3 form, \nthe primary data source with information on the universe of encounters is the BWC metadata. \nBy BWC metadata, we refer to the record of each recording made by an officer, including the \nofficer’s name, date, time, length of video and sometimes information on the encounter. The \nNYPD proposed to include the De Bour level into the BWC system so that officers can categorize \nand report on the frequency of Level 1 and 2 encounters.  (The NYPD has indicated that these \ndata will be able to be accessed through the Axon system website evidence.com.) As a result, \nwe will sample encounters from the BWC metadata for the study.  \nThere are several unique challenges associated with selecting encounters through the BWC \nmetadata in contrast to using a database of reported encounters. First, the system will often \ncontain multiple records of the same encounter because each officer present will activate their \ncamera. Before selection, recordings of the same encounter will have to be linked. If not, the \nprobability of selecting an encounter for the study will increase as the number of officers \npresent during the encounter increases. This would bias the study toward selecting encounters \nwith more officers, which are more likely to be anti crime officers and more serious encounters. \nThe NYPD will need to support our efforts to link recordings of the same encounters prior to \nselection.11 \nSample 2 \nAn open question for the Stanford team is whether computational techniques can distinguish \nbetween correctly and incorrectly labelled Level 2 encounters through features in metadata, \nlanguage, or video recordings. If so, this approach could scale legal experts’ judgments to the \ninteractions outside of our sampling regime. However, it is impossible to judge the feasibility of \nsuch a model until Sample 1 is collected. Supervised learning methods require judges to provide \nlabels for a set of training data (i.e., whether Level 2 labelled encounters are actually Level 2 or \nLevel 3). The model is trained against these labels and is then tested against a separate sample \nto determine its accuracy. \nIn addition to an initial sample of 1,500 encounters, we will select a second sample of 1,000 \nencounters for this purpose. If the Stanford team is able to build an adequately predictive \nmodel from the initial sample of encounters, then this second   would consist of the 1,000 \nsample\nencounters most useful for refining the model (i.e., those closest to the boundary between \ncorrectly and incorrectly labelled Level 2 encounters).  \n11 BWCs will recognize when another camera is activated nearby. However, it is not apparent from metadata \nwhich records may be of the same encounter. \n5 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 19 of 40\nHowever, if improperly categorized Level 2 encounters are rare, or if the differences between \nproperly and improperly labelled encounters are exceedingly subtle, then a computational \nmodel may not be feasible for detecting compliance. If this is the case, we propose allocating \nthese 1,000 additional encounters using the same sampling regime as Sample 1. This would \nallow for greater statistical power to measure the influence of covariates of interest (e.g., \nwhether an encounter occurred during a housing patrol, the location in which an encounter \noccurred, etc.). \n6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 20 of 40\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 21 of 40\nProposed Study of Police-Citizen Encounters \nInstitute of State and Local Governance \nMay 28, 2020 \nIntroduction \nISLG proposes to carry out a study that will address fundamental questions about the NYPD’s \ncompliance with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments in police-citizen encounters as an alternative \nto the Combined Pilot. Crucially, the study will examine legal compliance in police-citizen encounters, \nracial disparities in compliance and escalation, and appropriate documentation of encounters.  All of \nwhich can be examined on a broader scale following the introduction of a new policy proposed by NYPD \nto record nearly all police-citizen encounters at every De Bour level with body-worn cameras (BWC).  \nWith a more complete record of police-citizen encounters available on BWC, the study will supply novel \ninsights into officer compliance with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and the degree of NYPD \ndocumentation of police-citizen encounters without direct observation of officers.  \nThe study will explore the following research questions: \n1) Compliance: How often does officer behavior in police-citizen encounters violate the Fourth\nAmendment or Fourteenth Amendment? What are the key reasons for officers’ failure to\ncomply with legal requirements?  Are there racial disparities in the legality of police-citizen\nencounters?\n2) Escalation: How often do police-citizen encounters escalate from lower to higher levels? Are\nthere racial disparities in the legality of escalated encounters?\n3) Documentation: Does the expansion of mandatory BWC recording to most Level 1 encounters\nincrease the number of Level 3 encounters that are reported?  Post-expansion of BWC\nrecording, what is the documentation rate of Level 3 encounters? Are undocumented Level 3\nencounters associated with race and ethnicity or legal non-compliance?\nIn addition to addressing these substantive research questions, the study will generate important \ndescriptive information about the nature of police-citizen encounters. After the expansion of BWC \nrecording, analysis of BWC footage by ISLG and legal experts will provide a more nuanced portrait of the \npolice-citizen encounters than is currently available. \nApproach for answering key research questions \n1) Compliance with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\nOne key area of responsibility for the Monitorship is legal compliance in police-citizen encounters. \nThe study will investigate officer compliance with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments in \nencounters with citizens. To do so, ISLG will conduct three primary analyses. To address compliance with \nthe Fourth Amendment, we will employ legal experts to assess encounters to determine whether there \nare any Fourth Amendment violations at each De Bour level, leading to an ultimate assessment of legal \ncompliance for the encounters. To assess Fourteenth Amendment violations, we will examine whether \n1 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 22 of 40\nthere are racial disparities in compliance across encounters and provide the legal experts the ability to \nindicate whether they found a Fourteenth Amendment violation in an individual encounter.     \nTo establish the legality of officer compliance with the Fourth Amendment, a panel of retired judges \n(legal experts) will utilize BWC footage plus relevant documentation to determine and code the De Bour \nlevels present in an encounter, whether officer actions were legally compliant and the reasons for non-\ncompliance by De Bour level.  Each encounter will be randomly assigned to at least two legal experts to \nestablish consensus on legality.1  With these data, ISLG will be able to analyze and report compliance of \nencounters by De Bour level.2 In addition to documenting the rates of legal compliance, the assessments \ncompleted by the legal experts will also provide insight into the reasons that encounters were deemed \nnon-compliant. Using the coded data, ISLG will report the most prevalent reasons cited by the legal \nexperts for non-compliant encounters thus providing the NYPD with important information on the \nspecific nature of Fourth Amendment violations.  \nThe legal experts, as former judges, will be able to provide valuable analysis on Fourth Amendment \nconcerns in police-citizen encounters. ISLG will utilize their expertise to supplement closed-ended \ncoding. Each legal expert will complete an open-ended narrative that summarizes the most frequent \ncauses of Fourth Amendment violations in the encounters that they analyzed and explain the nature of \nthese violations. They can do so in greater depth and with more nuance than is possible in closed ended \ncoding. These analyses will enable the NYPD to refine its training and oversight in ways that will improve \nthe legality and quality of officer-citizen encounters.  \nImportantly, the study will assess encounters for Fourteenth Amendment violations in addition to \nFourth Amendment violations, and this will be done in two ways. First, legal experts will be asked to \nidentify any Fourteenth Amendment violations in each encounter they review. Second, ISLG will \nexamine whether there are racial disparities in legal compliance across police-citizen encounters that \nare reviewed. We will assess the effect of citizen race on legal compliance while controlling for other \naspects of the encounter that may affect compliance, thus determining whether black and Hispanic \ncitizens are more likely to experience Fourth Amendment violations in their interactions with officers. It \nis important to note that this analysis will examine Fourteenth Amendment violations in encounters that \noccur, providing valuable information regarding disparities, or lack of disparities, in NYPD treatment of \ncitizens in encounters.  \n2) Escalation\nThe expansion of BWC recording to most Level 1 encounters provides an opportunity to examine \nand better understand encounters that escalate from a Level 1 or 2 to Level 3 or 4. In this second \nanalysis, ISLG will both explore the prevalence and legality of escalations in police-citizen encounters \nand examine any racial disparities in these encounters.  Specifically, we will explore how often escalation \noccurs in encounters, whether escalated encounters are more likely to be non-compliant with Fourth \n1 A third legal expert will review any legal questions where there is disagreement in the initial review. \n2 We will also report descriptive information about encounters where there is disagreement among legal experts. \nThis will provide nuance into those cases where a determination of compliance was complex and led to split \ndecisions among the legal experts. \n2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 23 of 40\nAmendment requirements, and whether there are racial disparities in the frequency and nature of \nescalations. \nAs described above, the first analysis will generate novel data on the De Bour levels contained in \npolice-citizen encounters and legal compliance at each level.   With these data, we will have the ability \nto describe De Bour escalation patterns in different ways. First, we will report the proportion of all \nencounters that escalated. This provides information on how common escalation through De Bour levels \nis in the universe of all encounters in the sample. Another analysis of interest is the proportion of Level 3 \nencounters that escalated from at least a Level 2. This will provide insight into the share of Level 3 \nencounters that resulted from escalation versus encounters where officers immediately detained an \nindividual. After we have identified Level 3 encounters that escalated, we can compare compliance in \nescalated encounters relative to those encounters that did not escalate. Lastly, we will examine the \nproportion of Level 2 encounters that escalate to Level 3 or above. Using the definition of escalation \nabove, encounters only escalate if they begin at Level 2 or below. This will establish the rate of \nescalation among those encounters where escalation is possible.  \nWe will also examine racial disparities in De Bour escalation through two strategies. First, we will \nexamine whether Level 1 or 2 encounters escalate more often if the citizen is black or Hispanic and \nwhether there are racial disparities in the compliance rate of escalated encounters.3 A second analysis \nwill focus on describing racial differences in Level 3 encounters. Specifically, we will examine whether \nLevel 3 encounters with black and Hispanic citizens are more likely to have escalated from a Level 1 or 2 \nas compared to white citizens. This will provide insight into whether there are differences by race in how \nLevel 3 encounters are initiated. We will then examine whether Level 3 encounters that escalated from \na Level 1 or 2 are less likely to be legally compliant and whether there are any differences by citizen \nrace.  \nIt is important to note that this analysis may be descriptive, because the sample may be small if \nescalation across De Bour levels is rare.  While we will explore the possibility of looking at other factors \nand circumstances that may increase the likelihood of escalation, it may not be possible if there is not \nsufficient data.  \nA second analysis will consider escalation in a more fine-grained manner than through De Bour \nlevels, which will permit a more nuanced assessment of escalation. The Fourteenth Amendment \nrequires that similarly situated individuals be treated equally (see Liability Opinion, pg. 27). Examining \nescalation through De Bour levels may mask important differences in the intensiveness of encounters \nwithin De Bour level. Officers may take a range of actions within a De Bour level that affect the \nexperience of the encounter for the citizen. For example, a Level 3 encounter may involve a frisk, but \nmay not. Existing research has sequenced citizen and officer actions. We will use BWC footage to \nsequence the actions of an encounter to identify actions that might be associated with escalation across \nDe Bour levels, especially inappropriate actions.  By breaking down encounters into a sequence of \nactions, we can examine how officers interact with citizens, factors that trigger escalation in the actions \nthat officers take, and inequalities in how interactions progress.  This will also examine disparities in how \n3 The analysis will not be able to assess racial disparities in the probability of a citizen of having a Level 1 or 2 \nencounter.   \n3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 24 of 40\nencounters escalate. This work will complement analysis of language executed by the Stanford team. \nWe will explore existing measures of escalation and consider how they might be adapted. \n3) Documentation\nThe presence of undocumented stops limits the ability of the Monitor to assess the legality of Level \n3 encounters. This is especially important if there is a relationship between documentation of an \nencounter and its legality. ISLG will examine the issue of officer documentation in two ways. First, we \nwill assess the effect of expanding BWC recording to almost all encounters on the number of reported \nLevel 3 encounters. Second, after BWC recording expands, we will determine the current rate of \ndocumented Level 3 encounters. \nChanging the NYPD BWC recording policy to include most Level 1 encounters will increase the \ntransparency of police-citizen encounters, which may affect an officer’s decision to report a Level 3 \nencounter.4  We will assess whether this policy change affects the number of reported Level 3 \nencounters. Because assessing reported Level 3 encounters relies on administrative data rather than \nBWC footage, we will be able to examine all officers on patrol rather than a sample of officers. The NYPD \ncould provide a count of tours and reported Level 3 encounters by officer for approximately 12 weeks \nbefore and after the introduction of the policy. With these data, we will assess whether policy change is \nassociated with an increase in the number of reported Level 3 encounters while controlling for other \nfactors that affect the prevalence of Level 3 encounters.  Ultimately, the strategy for analysis will \ndepend on whether the City rolls out the new policy gradually by commands or citywide. We can better \nassess a causal effect between the policy and documented Level 3 encounters if the City rolls the policy \nout gradually. It permits differentiation between time trends and the effect of the policy on reported \nLevel 3 encounters. \nIf the City rolls out the policy gradually by commands, ISLG can adopt an analytic strategy that better \naccounts for trends that change over time in addition to the policy change.5 Using an officer-by-week \nunit of analysis would allow ISLG to control for individual officers’ propensity to stop, as well as \nvariations in time or seasonality i.e., officer and week-fixed effects. In addition, ISLG would control for \ndifferences across precincts.  NYPD can provide data on the number of stops each officer reported, as \nwell as the number of tours each officer worked every week. From this, the number of stops per tour \neach officer reported every week can be calculated. Level 3 encounters will be calculated per tour as we \nmust account for the opportunity to stop a citizen (or the number of tours worked). \n4 One outstanding issue is the form of documentation for Level 1 and 2 encounters. Categorization by De Bour level \nof these encounters would also affect transparency and may further affect the incentive to report. As yet, it is \nunknown what that categorization will look like or even whether it will be implemented with changes in BWC \npolicy. \n5 One possibility is to conduct a difference-in-differences analysis in which the number of documented Level 3 \nencounters in commands which have implemented the policy, both prior to and after the policy change, are \ncompared with commands which have not yet implemented the policy. \n4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 25 of 40\nIf the City chooses to implement the policy citywide, ‘control’ precincts in which the policy has not \nyet been implemented will be unavailable for comparison.6 As discussed above, this approach is less \ndesirable than a roll-out of the policy. Implementing the policy citywide provides only one pre-post point \nof comparison   the time period prior to roll-out and the time period after it. In comparison, rolling out \nthe policy gradually would provide multiple points of comparison, in addition to allowing ISLG to control \nfor variance in officer propensity to stop, seasonality, and crime trends.  \nA challenge common to both approaches is that it will be difficult to differentiate between an \nincrease in actual Level 3 encounters and an increase in the reporting of those encounters. Moreover, \nwe cannot differentiate between reporting and incidence with regard to the distribution of levels in \nstops, because Level 1 and 2 stops are not currently documented. A possible solution would be to \nconduct audits of potentially undocumented stops using radio transmissions to identify instances in \nwhich stops appear to have been made, but a stop report was not recorded, in each precinct during the \npre- and post-intervention periods, as was done throughout the quarters between 2016 2018 (RAND \naudits).7  \nThe second analysis on documentation will focus on the accurate documentation of Level 3 \nencounters after the BWC policy change is implemented. Legal expert coding will identify the De Bour \nlevel of all encounters for a sample of encounters. With that information, we will be able to identify \nLevel 3 encounters that were not reported by officers and calculate the rate of undocumented Level 3 \nencounters.  Once undocumented Level 3 encounters have been identified, it is possible to explore \nwhether there is any relationship between documentation and legal compliance or citizen race. This \nanalysis may be descriptive, because the sample size will likely be small. \n*  *  * \nJennifer Eberhardt, Rob Voigt and Nick Camp (Stanford team) can build on this analysis by utilizing \nmachine learning tactics to examine officer categorization of De Bour levels in a much wider set of \nencounters. We will provide legal expert coding and documentation information to them so that they \nmay use legal expert identification of De Bour level to further their efforts.  \nData Collection and Analysis: \nThe proposed analyses will rely on three sources of data: BWC footage, police reports, and \nadministrative data. ISLG will descriptively code encounters, organize reports and administrative data by \nencounter, and then assign encounters to legal experts for review. This will generate a dataset of \nencounters that can be analyzed to generate new information on several distinct questions about \ncompliance with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, accurate documentation and the dynamics of \nescalation in encounters. BWC footage will serve as the primary data source for sampling and coding \n6 One possibility is to use an interrupted time-series design, in which trends in reported stop outcomes observed \npost-implementation will be compared to the trends observed prior to implementation.   \n7 If the RAND audits suggest increased compliance in reporting after the policy change is implemented, then any \nincrease in the number of reported stops is likely a result of increased reporting. However, if the reporting rate \nfrom the RAND audits remains constant, an increase in the number of reported stops will be the result of officers \nconducting more stops and not increasing the rate at which they document stops. \n5 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 26 of 40\nencounters. Therefore, the study will primarily be confined to documenting and analyzing encounters \nafter the NYPD expands BWC recording to include Level 1 encounters.  Importantly, ISLG will coordinate \nwith the Stanford team on sampling, the coding of BWC videos, and the legal expert instrument to \nensure the data collected serves the needs of ISLG’s analyses as well as the Stanford team’s analysis of \nlanguage.  \nISLG and the Stanford team will need a sample of at least 2,500 police-citizen encounters that \nare De Bour Level 2 or above. The sample will be drawn in two waves with the first including \napproximately 1,500 encounters and the second approximately 1,000 encounters. The initial sample will \ncapture a random sample of encounters that both ISLG and the Stanford team will utilize to answer \nprimary research questions. In contrast, the second sample will be narrower in order to facilitate the use \nof machine learning techniques to identify Level 3 encounters. The samples will be drawn after the \nNYPD implements the two proposed policies that expand body worn camera recording and \ncategorization of encounters.  A separate memo outlines the in detail the joint sampling plan for ISLG \nand the Stanford team.  \nOnce a sample of encounters has been selected, ISLG will employ graduate student research \nassistants to code each encounter with a revised survey instrument. First, graduate students will assess \nwhether the BWC footage for a selected encounter is sufficiently clear and complete for inclusion in the \nstudy. We will track the number of events that have to be excluded for failure to turn on BWC for the \nentirety of the encounters as well as any other reasons that an event needed to be excluded. After the \nfootage has be deemed sufficient, graduate students will code key elements of each encounter. Coding \nwill include information about citizens in the encounter as well as actions officers took. These data will \nprovide descriptive information on encounters.  The data will also aggregate features of encounters that \nwill be important in the analyses conducted by both ISLG and the Stanford team.  We will coordinate on \nthe development of a new instrument to code data.  \nISLG will also obtain several types of administrative data. First, we require the BWC metadata. \nThese data are necessary for sample selection and in order to obtain important information about \nencounters, including their length. ISLG also requires other types of data from the NYPD on sampled \nencounters, including officer reports, ICAD data, and personnel information. For each encounter, ISLG \nwill need to obtain any relevant reports submitted by officers (such as arrest reports, use of force \nreports). We will also extract the relevant portion of the ICAD data for the encounter. Importantly, ISLG \nmust also acquire data on officer documentation for all Level 1 and 2 encounters. (The form of that \ndocumentation is not yet certain, but we note that it will be needed.)  \nThe next step in the data collection will be legal expert review of sampled encounters.  ISLG will \nbundle BWC footage with reports and ICAD data in preparation for legal expert review of the encounter. \nISLG will then assign events to legal experts for evaluation through a web application.  Assessment of \nlegality will include identification of the De Bour level(s), a judgment of legality at each De Bour level in \nan encounter, and identification of Fourteenth Amendment violations. At least two legal experts will \nreview each encounter. If there is a conflict between two experts on any legal judgments, a third legal \nexpert will also review the encounter, but the third expert’s evaluation will be confined to the questions \nthat generated conflict between the first two legal experts.  This process establishes a consensus \nopinion for each legal question. If officer actions are determined to be non-compliant, legal experts will \nprovide the legal reason for non-compliance.   \n6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 27 of 40\nAt the conclusion of their coding of individual encounters, the legal experts will have the \nopportunity to write a narrative analysis of the trends that they observed. The aim of this analysis is to \nprovide the NYPD with more nuanced information on areas where officer behavior in encounters might \nbe improved through training and oversight. The legal experts will be provided with a set of summary \nstatistics on the encounters that they reviewed, including the number of encounters by De Bour level, \nthe rate of non-compliance, and the reasons provided for non-compliance.8 The legal experts will have \nthe ability to review their coding for any specific encounter and to view relevant BWC footage. This may \nbe useful, for example, if an expert wants to discuss a set of encounters which exhibited similar legal \nissues. They will complete an open-ended narrative setting forth their analysis on the nature of the \nFourth Amendment violations that they observed. ISLG will supplement the quantitative analysis in its \nreport with observations drawn from the legal experts’ analyses. \nThe analysis on reported Level 3 encounters before and after the expansion of BWC recording \nwill rely only on NYPD administrative data, which will permit analysis of the universe of officers on \npatrol. ISLG requires incident-level information on Level 3 stops, specifically the precinct number, the \ntime and date, and an identification number for the officer who made the stop. All except the last is \npublished in the publicly available SQF data. In addition, information on each tour that officers worked \nover the time period including precinct, date, shift duration (accounting for whether the shift went into \novertime), officers’ identification numbers, and the identification number of officers they were on tour \nwith, is required. (The data can be de-identified as long as the same random ID number is provided for \nan officer across all the data.)  If the policy is rolled out over time, NYPD would have to report when \ncommands changed policy and the length of the data collection period may need to increase depending \non the timing of the roll-out.  \nISLG will draw on these different sources of data to conduct analysis for each research question \nlisted above. Analysis for some research questions will utilize only a subset of the encounters that occur \nin the sample. For example, the analysis on documentation of Level 3 encounters will focus only on \nencounters that the legal experts identify as Level 3.  \n8 The aim of providing legal experts with descriptive statistics is to minimize the salience of recent or unusual \nevents in their consideration of trends.  \n7 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 28 of 40\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 29 of 40\nUsing Machine Learning Techniques to Analyze \nBody-Worn Camera Footage \nStanford Team \nJune 2020 \nUsing Machine Learning Techniques to Analyze Body-Worn Camera Footage  1 \nOverview and Aims  2 \nBackground  3 \nProposed Directions  4 \nPhase 1   Analysis of Existing Data  4 \nPrerequisites  5 \nSampling Procedure  5 \nStudy 1.a.

By some estimates, 95% \nof police departments across the country have invested in (or plan to invest in) them. Yet, \ndespite the growing support for these cameras, and the large number of encounters they \ncapture each day, BWC recordings are more often used as evidence to evaluate particular \ninteractions than as data to inform practice and policy. \nThe Stanford team fills this gap by developing scalable computational tools for quickly and \naccurately analyzing police community interactions captured by BWCs, and for examining broad \npatterns in those interactions. The NYPD, for example, could use such footage to examine the \nextent to which officers are complying with departmental practices and policies during \nencounters with the public. The footage could also be used to understand how such encounters \nmight escalate unnecessarily. Because the first phase of Stanford’s proposal relies on BWC \nvideos and data already recorded, this part of the proposal can begin before the NYPD makes \nthe changes outlined in the City’s letter dated February 21, 2020 regarding an alternative to the \ncombined pilot ordered by the Court. \nThe language officers use during investigative encounters is central to the above questions. \nIndeed, an officer’s words are of great legal import: they can signal to a citizen whether they \nare detained or free to leave, request their consent, or provoke their complaint.   More broadly, \nthe manner in which officers relate to the public is consequential for building or eroding \ncitizens’ trust in the law, support for law enforcement, and even whether they personally \ncooperate with the police1. \nPolice officers’ treatment of the public during police citizen encounters is also central to the \nmonitorship and consent decrees in the Floyd, Ligon and Davis cases. The Court found the City \nliable for violating plaintiff’s Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Not only were racially \ndefined groups targeted for stops, but “[b]oth statistical and anecdotal evidence showed that \nminorities are indeed treated differently than whites. For example, once a stop is made, Blacks \nand Hispanics are more likely to be subjected to the use of force than whites.”  (p.13, Liability \nOpinion). The Court, in its finding regarding discrimination, highlighted the fact that Blacks who \nwere subject to law enforcement action following their stop were about 30% more likely than \nWhites to be arrested (as opposed to receiving a summons) after a stop for the same suspected \ncrime, even after controlling for relevant variables, and Blacks who were stopped were about \n14% more likely than Whites to be subjected to the use of force (p.59 60, Liability Opinion). In \nthe words of the Court, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause “is essentially a \ndirection that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike” (p.27,Liability Opinion). \nThus, the question of whether officers treat Black and White citizens alike in encounters \nrecorded on BWCs is paramount. \n1 Tyler, T. R., & Huo, Y. (2002). Trust in the law: Encouraging public cooperation with the police and courts. Russell \nSage Foundation. \n2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 31 of 40\n \nHere, we outline possible areas where a machine learning approach to body worn camera \nfootage can help us understand and evaluate police initiated pedestrian encounters. \nSpecifically, we highlight the benefits of such an approach for evaluating four target areas: \n \n●  complaints   the actions taken on the part of an officer that lead encounters to result in \na complaint  \n●  consent searches   the language used by officers to request consent searches from \ncitizens, and the impact of different language choices on community responses to that \nrequest \n●  compliance   the extent to which officers correctly classifying their encounters with \npublic \n●  escalation   the manner in which an encounter becomes more fraught over time even \nwhen the De Bour level remains steady, and/or moves across De Bour levels, such as \nfrom Level 1 to 2 or Level 2 to 3. \n \nWe seek to answer these questions in two phases. The first phase aims to explore questions \nrelated to complaints and consent searches, which we can evaluate using existing data and \nfootage from 2019. The second phase examines compliance and escalation using a sample of \nfootage to be collected in coordination with ISLG and coded by legal experts. \nBackground \n \nOur team has already used machine learning to develop a novel algorithm to extract and \nanalyze officer language from a large corpus of body camera footage from the Oakland Police \nDepartment. Across nearly 1,000 routine traffic stops, we found that officers spoke more \nrespectfully to White vs. Black community members, even after controlling for the location and \noutcome of the stop, the severity of the infraction, and the officer’s race. This respect deficit, \nwhich is present from the beginning of the stop to the end, is significant because it can \ncontribute to racial differences in reported experiences with law enforcement as well as \ncommunity members’ trust in the law. \n \nIn another series of studies, we extended our analysis from what words officers use during \nroutine traffic stop interactions to when they use them during those interactions. Applying \ncomputational dialog methods to the same corpus of footage, we identified 11 discrete \nconversational actions that police officers take during stops (e.g., greeting the driver, asking for \ndocuments), and developed another novel algorithm to automatically tag footage for these \nacts. Disaggregating officer language and respect at the act (vs. stop) level can further help law \nenforcement agencies identify when community members are most likely to perceive \ndisrespect or distrust, and to target social tactics training accordingly. \n \nWe have also begun to analyze officers’ tone of voice during traffic stops. Once again, we find \nthat officers speak to White drivers more respectfully than Black drivers. In addition, we find \n  3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 32 of 40\nthat those community members who listen to short clips of officers’ tone as they speak to \nWhite drivers (as opposed to Black drivers) state that they have greater trust in law \nenforcement more generally and expect more positive interactions with the police. These \nfindings directly demonstrate how racial disparities in treatment during interactions could \nbolster or erode trust. \nProposed Directions \nThis approach can shed light on officer initiated investigative encounters in New York City, and \nhow they might differ by citizen race. Below, we discuss possible approaches we would take to \nexplore particular questions related to complaints, consent searches, compliance, and \nescalation, using machine learning techniques to better understand and evaluate police\ninitiated pedestrian encounters. The scale of our analysis further lets us test the extent to which \nthere are racial disparities in these aspects of police citizen interactions. We propose two \nphases as follows. \nPhase 1. In the first phase of this research, we constrain our sample to Level 3 stops from 2019. \nSince these Level 3 stops are already recorded and tagged by officers, we are able to sample \nand analyze interactions resulting in complaints, the linguistic characteristics of consent \nsearches, and the conditions surrounding escalation. This work can begin immediately given \nexisting department procedures for data collection and storage. \nPhase 2. In the second phase of this research, in collaboration with the ISLG team, we propose \nto obtain a sample of Level 1, 2 and 3 encounters. As outlined in the ISLG sampling memo, this \nsampling requires NYPD officers to assign a De Bour level to each of their recordings. By \nobtaining judgments from legal expert coders evaluating the footage, it will be possible to study \nthe linguistic dimensions of officer compliance and De Bour escalation.   \nPhase 1 - Analysis of Existing Data \nIn the first phase of research, we address a set of questions that can be examined under current \nprocedures and policies for data collection, using existing data (encounters recorded in 2019). \nThis will allow our team to begin the research process immediately, and thereby establish our \ncooperative relationship with the NYPD for exchanging data, as well as our research pipeline for \ndata processing. This will facilitate sampling and matching recordings in collaboration with ISLG \nduring Phase 2. \n4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 33 of 40\nPrerequisites \nThe studies described in this section rely on the following: \n● Computer readable metadata, such as spreadsheets of stop reports, for all Level 3\nencounters taking place during 2019\n● Computer readable records of citizen complaints taking place during 2019\n● Computer readable records of consent searches taking place during 2019\n● Download access to footage from the sample for transcription and computational\nanalysis\nSampling Procedure \nFor Study 1.a. (Retrospective Analysis of Complaints), we will sample the full population of \nBWC recorded Level 3 encounters resulting in a citizen complaint. For a quasi control group for \ncomparison, we will use propensity score matching using automatically extracted metadata and \nlinguistic features of interactions to establish a comparable sample of equal size composed of \ninteractions similar to the above but which did not result in a complaint. \nFor Study 1.b. (Linguistic Behavior in Consent Searches), we will sample the full population of \nBWC recorded Level 3 encounters documented as including a consent search.  \nFor Study 1.c. ( Escalation in Level 3 Encounters), we will leverage the population of samples \ncollected for Studies 1.a. and 1.b. to examine those in which escalation occurred. \nWe will begin this work by having these sampled encounters professionally transcribed, \nincluding per utterance timestamps and speaker diarization (record of who is talking to whom \nfor each utterance). \n5 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 34 of 40\nStudy 1.a.   Retrospective Analysis of Complaints \n \nResearch Questions: What elements of officer language and behavior in Level 3 encounters are \nmost likely to result in citizen complaints?  \n \nA large number of citizen complaints against the police concern whether citizens feel that \nofficers communicate appropriately and professionally with them. This study would seek to \nidentify elements of police stops that are most predictive of citizen complaints, compared to \notherwise similar stops that did not result in a citizen complaint. Specifically, we would focus \nour analysis on the subset of citizen complaints associated with Level 3 stops, where the \nencounter in question was captured on officer body worn camera. \n \nTo address this question, we will train a machine learning model to learn how to distinguish \nbetween Level 3 encounters that led to complaints and those that did not. As in our previous \nwork on officer respect, we can do this both with general distributional information about the \nwords officers use, as well as with reference to a targeted set of linguistic features or strategies \nthat are likely to be predictive. Our model will learn weights which quantitatively measure the \ninfluence of any given feature on a prediction of complaint/no complaint, allowing us to \ndetermine which sorts of linguistic behaviors most strongly distinguish these kinds of \nencounters. \n \nSuch a model would shed light on the dynamics in police citizen interactions that underlie \ncomplaints of unprofessional conduct or officer disrespect.  An interesting possibility that such \na model opens up is the ability to look for racial differences among complaints   perhaps a \ncertain set of officer linguistic features are more likely to lead to complaints by White citizens, \nwhile another set is more predictive for Black citizens. \n \nStudy 1.b.   Linguistic Behavior in Consent Searches \n \nResearch Questions: Do officers seek overt consent to search in Level 3 encounters? If so, when \nand how is consent sought? What language used by officers is associated with citizen consent \nversus refusal to search? When consent is granted, when and how is it done linguistically? \n \nUpwards of 90% of warrantless police searches are conducted by means of the consent \nexception to the Fourth Amendment, but the conditions under which such searches are truly \n“voluntary” is a complex subject of legal inquiry that is ultimately tied to officers’ \ncommunication in interactions.2 Officers may voice a request to search in any number of ways, \nand citizens stopped and questioned by the police may not understand the full weight of the \n \n2 See, for instance: Simmons, Ric. \"Not Voluntary but Still Reasonable: A New Paradigm for Understanding the \nConsent Searches Doctrine.\" Indiana Law Journal, vol. 80, no. 3, Summer 2005, p. 773-824 \n  6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 35 of 40\nrequest or their option to refuse it. These challenges may be exacerbated by disparities in \ntreatment and general miscommunication between police and members of the public. \n \nTherefore we propose to examine the linguistic considerations surrounding consent searches \nby examining a transcribed sample of footage from encounters in which officers request a \ncitizen’s consent to search (both accepted and rejected consent searches). Note that in this \nstudy we aim to descriptively characterize the procedural facts surrounding searches so as to \nquantify potential disparity. To do so, we will develop algorithms that can automatically identify \nthe occasion(s) of a request to search in the transcript of an interaction.  \n \nThis will allow us to first ask basic distributional questions about these requests, such as: When \nin an interaction do they tend to occur? Considering the linguistic form such requests may take, \nare requests overt (“Can I search you?”), covert (“You mind if I check that out for a second?”), \nor even framed as commands or declarative statements (“Let me look in here.”)? To the extent \nthat the linguistic framings of these requests differ, are officers more likely to use more covert \nrequests with Black and Hispanic citizens? And are some framings more likely to elicit a citizen’s \nconsent than others? When consent from the citizen is granted, is it clear and overt (“Yes, that’s \nfine.”) or indirect, hesitant, or ambiguous (“I guess.” or “I’m good.”)?  \n \nWe can further examine the trajectories of the stops before and after consent searches take \nplace, whether with reference to escalation as will be discussed below in Study 1.c., or in terms \nof conversational events in the encounter, like whether the officer provides the reason for the \nstop or an explicit reason for the search.  \n \nStudy 1.c.   Escalation in Level 3 Encounters \n \nResearch Questions: How can an officer’s communication lead to the escalation of an \nencounter? When does citizen language lead officers to act more or less respectfully? \n \nIn order to determine which encounters escalate (e.g. low level enforcement stops), and when \nthey might escalate (e.g. in response to an insult) or de escalate (e.g. once an officer gives the \nreason for a stop), we will map the trajectories of stops sampled for questions 1a and 1b. \nSpecifically, we will measure the frequency of linguistic correlates of officer respect and citizen \nagitation over the time course of a stop. A stop can be said to escalate when the officer \nbecomes less respectful and a citizen more agitated over time. We will validate these linguistic \nratings against human judgments of whether the encounter is becoming more or less fraught \nover time. \n  7 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 36 of 40\nFigure 1. Schematic trajectories of police-citizen encounters. Each line represents a stop; note that interactions can \nvary in their starting position, ending position, and general trajectories \nBy charting the trajectory of each encounter, we can then ask what variables influence a) the \nstarting state of Level 3 encounters (i.e. the intercept of this trajectory), b) the rate of \nescalation (i.e. the slope), and c) inflections in trajectories (i.e. going from a positive to a \nnegative slope within an interaction). For example, does whether, when, and how officers state \nthe reason for the encounter influence the likelihood that the encounter will escalate? Do \ncitizens’ procedural questions change the trajectory of police encounters?  \n8 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 37 of 40\nPhase 2 - Analysis of Future Data \nIn the second phase of this research, in collaboration with ISLG, we aim to address questions \nsurrounding the relationship between officer communication and legal standards of conduct: \ncompliance with NYPD documentation and categorization of stops and De Bour escalation in \nofficer encounters.  \nThe questions we address in this phase require officers to categorize BWC recordings of Level 1 \nand Level 2 encounters as outlined in the ISLG sampling procedures. Further, since these \nquestions concern the assignment and change in De Bour levels, they require legal experts’ \njudgments. \nPrerequisites \nThe studies described in this section rely on the following: \n● Computer readable metadata, such as spreadsheets of stop reports, for all encounters\ntaking place during the period of the sample\n● Interactions sampled by ISLG as per the attached sampling memo\n● Download access to footage from the sample for transcription and computational\nanalysis\n● Race of citizen information, obtained either from officer generated metadata (e.g.\ncombined Level 2/Level 3 stop reports), ISLG coding, or both.\nSampling Procedure \nThe sampling procedure for Phase 2 will be coordinated with ISLG in the interest of obtaining \ngeneralizable population level estimates of officer behavior with regards to compliance and \nescalation. This procedure is discussed in detail in the attached sampling memo. \nWe will begin this work by having the sample of encounters   those coded by ISLG and sent to \nlegal experts for judgment   professionally transcribed, including per utterance timestamps and \nspeaker diarization (record of who is talking to whom for each utterance).  \nStudy 2.a.   Analysis of Officer Compliance \nResearch Question: How do officers, through their words, create a situation where a reasonable \nperson would not feel free to leave? \nNYPD patrol guidelines indicate that an officer “may not create a situation (either by words or \nactions) when a reasonable person would not feel free to walk away” during a Level 2 \n9 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 38 of 40\nencounter; in contrast, in a Level 3 encounter, officers may detain the subject (i.e. “a \nreasonable person would not feel free to disregard the officer and walk away”). The goal of this \nstudy is to identify linguistic features that correspond to this distinction, confirm that they \ncommunicate appropriate levels of freedom or constraint on the part of the subject, and \nidentify cases where legal experts judge that officers’ language might create a situation where a \nreasonable person would not feel free to leave. \n \nIn coordination with ISLG, we will obtain legal expert judgments which either validate an \nofficers’ categorization of a stop or contradict it. We expect encounters labeled by officers as \nLevel 3 but which legal experts judge to be Level 2 to be relatively rare. Therefore we \ndistinguish three core types of encounters: basic Level 2 and Level 3 encounters, which are so \ncategorized by officers and then validated by legal experts, and non compliant Level 2 \nencounters (which we will refer to as NC L2 encounters), which were categorized as Level 2 by \nofficers but contradicted by legal experts who tagged them as Level 3 stops. \n \nWe can examine officer language and behavior across these different kinds of encounters by \nanalyzing transcripts. Specifically, we will use machine learning techniques to build a model \nwhich aims to predict whether an encounter was Level 2 or Level 3 on the basis of the officers’ \nwords alone. This model will be trained on legal expert judgments. \n \nSuch a system inherently allows us to extract similarity between encounters to quantify the \n“severity” of an NC L2: whether it more closely resembles a Level 2 or a Level 3 encounter. NC\nL2 encounters that resemble Level 2 encounters linguistically (i.e., they are difficult to \ndistinguish using officer words alone) may result from officer misinterpretation of NYPD policies \nwhich could be remedied with clarification. On the other hand, NC L2 encounters that look very \nsimilar to Level 3 encounters, may indicate that officers are more aware of the non compliance \nand are intentionally underreporting. Such a system would allow us to determine which of \nthese scenarios is more prevalent, and to what degree. Moreover, we could identify whether a \nracial disparity exists within NC L2 encounters: whether NC L2 stops of White pedestrians more \nclosely resemble Level 2 encounters than stops of Black pedestrians. \n \nIn our previous work on officer respect we identified linguistic strategies officers used which \nconveyed respect , developed algorithms to measure those linguistic strategies in transcripts, \nand used them as features for a computational model of respect. In this case we could follow \nthat methodological paradigm, both by identifying which words were most predictive as \ndescribed above, and by consulting with legal and police experts as well as the ISLG team as to \nkey linguistic strategies for compliance. We would distill these findings down to a set of key \nfeatures and train a model to quantify their usage in the three types of encounters, which could \nbe evaluated in terms of racial disparity as well. We could find, for instance, that a higher rate \nof NC L2 encounters among Black pedestrians could be explained by the use of certain phrases \nwhich officers are independently more likely to use when interacting with Black people. \nAdditionally, this approach would provide concrete strategies for policy and training. For \ninstance, if a certain phrase or set of phrases are highly indicative of NC L2 encounters but \n  10 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 39 of 40\nrarely occur in Level 2 and Level 3 encounters, a policy intervention that these be avoided could \nbe implemented. \nStudy 2.b.   De Bour Escalation \nResearch Questions: To what extent are officers’ words predictive of improper escalation? To \nwhat extent does escalation, on the part of either the citizen or the officer, lead to an \nescalation in De Bour level? \nA second area of interest concerns the escalation of Level 3 encounters (i.e. whether these \nencounters began at a lower level), the propriety of such escalation, and racial disparities in \nthese trajectories. Our goal in these studies would be to identify key phrases or speech events \nthat indicate escalation from legal expert judgments, build a predictive model to identify those \nfeatures in a large amount of unseen data, and then examine the immediate context of these \nfeatures (e.g. the officer observes contraband, a subject makes a complaint).  Our power to \nanswer these questions, and the granularity of our analyses depends on the prevalence of Level \n3 encounters that began as Level 1 or Level 2 encounters.  \nTo test this question, in coordination with ISLG we would ensure that for each encounter in our \nsample, legal experts viewing the footage determine whether the encounter starts at Level 3, \nand, if not, at what timepoint in the recording the interaction crosses that threshold. \nAs in our other studies, our goal would be to scale expert judgments to unseen data with \ncomputational modelling. Just as we have applied a computational dialog approach to \ncategorize elements of traffic stops (greetings, document requests, sanctions, e.g.), we would \nidentify phases of Level 3 encounters, including the point at which they cross the boundary \nfrom lower level encounters to Level 3 ones. Such a model serves two proximate goals. First, it \nwould allow us to compare the trajectory of different encounters across citizen race (how \nquickly encounters move from introductory phases to the Level 3 boundary); second, it could \npotentially let us flag other Level 3 encounters with similar trajectories in unseen data. \nIf we are able to obtain a large enough sample of Level 3 encounters escalated from Levels 1 or \n2 (either through expert judgment or model assisted identification), we can examine what \nconversational events precede escalation. For example, an officer may develop reasonable \nsuspicion in response to a citizen’s answer to a question, or an officer may improperly detain a \ncitizen who refuses to answer their questions in a common law right of inquiry. To address this \nquestion, we will create a coding scheme to categorize citizen language immediately preceding \nescalation and implement it algorithmically for analysis. While we acknowledge that some \nprecursors to escalation are nonverbal (e.g. subject fleeing or an officer spotting contraband), \nthis analysis could provide insight on officer citizen dynamics in escalated encounters. \n11 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 817   Filed 02/12/21   Page 40 of 40\nConcluding Remarks \n \nThe question of how officers communicate with the public is of critical legal, social, and policy \nimportance: they literally give voice to the law. BWC recordings provide an unobtrusive means \nof observing how officers interact with citizens: how effectively law enforcement \ncommunicates citizens’ rights, when encounters escalate, and when they might lead to citizen \ncomplaints against the police.  \n \nThe analyses we propose here provide a means to address these questions at scale and with \nminimal cost by harnessing machine learning and expert judgment. There are huge advantages \nto taking a machine learning approach to examine issues of compliance and escalation in \ninvestigative encounters. For example, once the transcripts are produced and the algorithms \nare set, human raters are no longer needed to judge each and every encounter. Moreover, \nsince BWC recordings are constantly being generated by officers, our models can assess the \nefficacy and impact of policy change, various trainings and other interventions. Perhaps most \nimportantly, the approach involves simply analyzing the data that is already being collected on \na routine basis. That is, data collection and analysis will not require officers to do much beyond \nwhat they normally do.  \n  12 ",

Filed 10/31/14   Page 10 of 30\nBACKGROUND \nOn  January  8,  2013,  United  States  District  Judge  Shira  A. \nScheindlin entered a preliminary injunction against defendants in \nLigon v. City of New York, finding that plaintiffs had shown “a clear \nlikelihood  of  proving  at  trial”  that  the  New  York  City  Police \nDepartment (“NYPD”) had a practice of making unlawful trespass \n“stops” outside of certain privately‐owned residential buildings in \nthe Bronx.1 \nOn August 12, 2013, after a bench trial that followed plaintiffs’ \nwithdrawal  of  claims  for  money  damages  and  claims  against \nindividual defendants, Judge Scheindlin issued an order in Floyd v. \nCity of New York, finding that the City had violated the Fourth and \nFourteenth  Amendments  by  acting  with  “deliberate  indifference” \ntoward the NYPD’s practice of making suspicionless “stops” and \n“frisks” and by adopting “a policy of indirect racial profiling by \ntargeting racially  defined  groups”  for  “stops” and “frisks.”2  That \nsame day, Judge Scheindlin issued an order imposing remedies in \nFloyd and Ligon in the form of various “reforms” to the NYPD’s \n

court‐appointed \nmonitor.3 The City appealed in both cases and sought a stay. \nOn  September  11  and  12,  2013,  the  Sergeants  Benevolent \nAssociation (“SBA”), Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association of the City \nof  New  York  (“PBA”),  Detectives’  Endowment  Association,  Inc. \n(“DEA”), New York City Police Department Captains Endowment \nAssociation (“CEA”), and Lieutenants Benevolent Association of the \nCity of New York, Inc. (“LBA,” and jointly, “police unions” or the \n“unions”) filed notices of appeal and motions to intervene in the \nDistrict  Court.  With  the  exception  of  the  SBA,  the  police  unions \nmoved  to  intervene  in  both  Floyd  and  Ligon.  The  SBA moved  to \nintervene  in  only  Floyd.  While  the  SBA  and  the  PBA  appeal  the \nLiability  and  Remedial  Orders,  the  DEA,  the  CEA,  and  the  LBA \nappeal only the Remedial Order.  \nOn October 31, 2013, we granted the City’s motion for a stay \nand ordered that the cases be reassigned from Judge Scheindlin to \nanother district judge.4 In an opinion, dated November 13, 2013, we \nexplained  the  reasons  for  that  order.5  On  November  1,  2013,  the \ncases were assigned to United States District Judge Analisa Torres. \nThereafter, an election to fill the various leadership positions \nin the City’s municipal government was held on November 5, 2013, \n

Page 12 of 30\nleading,  inter  alia,  to  the  election  of  a  new  administration.  On \nNovember 7, 2013, the police unions, with the exception of the SBA, \nmoved to intervene in the Floyd and Ligon appeals. On November 12, \n2013, the SBA moved to intervene in only the Floyd appeal. \nOn February 21, 2014, on the City’s motion, we remanded the \ncauses to Judge Torres for the purpose of exploring settlement and \nfor Judge Torres to address in the first instance the police unions’ \nmotions  to  intervene  in  the  District  Court  actions.6  We  held  in \nabeyance  the  police  unions’  separate  motions  to  intervene  in  the \npending appeals.7 \nOn March 4, 2014, the parties informed Judge Torres that they \nhad  “reached  an  agreement  in  principle  for  resolving  the  City’s \nappeals in both Floyd and Ligon” pursuant to which the City would \n“substantially compl[y]” with the injunctive relief set forth in Judge \nScheindlin’s Remedial Order, subject to the parties’ application to \nJudge Torres to limit the term of the court‐appointed monitor to \nthree years. In the parties’ memorandum of law in support of their \njoint motion for modification of the Remedial Order, they explained \nthat “[t]he parties have also agreed that when the monitorship ends, \nthe City will authorize the Inspector General of the NYPD . . . to \ncontinue to monitor and report to the parties and the public” the \nNYPD’s compliance with the Remedial Order. They stated that “the \nparties

30,  2014,  Judge  Torres  granted  the  parties’  joint  motion  to \nmodify the Remedial Order and to enter it as an embodiment of \ntheir agreements. \nOn July 30, 2014, Judge Torres also issued an order denying \nthe police unions’ motions to intervene, finding, inter alia, that the \nmotions were untimely and that the police unions did not assert a \nlegally protectable interest. Judge Torres held that the motions were \nuntimely because the unions “should have known for years . . . that \ntheir  members’  alleged  reputational  interests  and  the  Unions’ \ncollective bargaining interests were being litigated by parties who \nwere not invested in protecting those interests.” Judge Torres held \nthat  plaintiffs  would  “face  significant  prejudice  if  previously \nuninterested  late‐comers  are  permitted  to  prolong  the

“working \nconditions,” nor does it prevent the unions from bargaining over \nthese issues. The police unions appealed. \n  On August 6, 2014, with the consent of plaintiffs in Floyd and \nLigon,  the  City  moved  to  voluntarily  dismiss  its  appeals,  with \nprejudice, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b), \nstating that the parties “reached an agreement that resolves all the \nissues  raised  by  the  City’s  appeals  in  both  Floyd  and  Ligon,  and \nclears  the  way  for  the  parties  to  begin  the  anticipated  remedial \nprocess.”  The  motion  further  requests,  “with  the  consent  of  all \nplaintiffs,  that  the  Court  direct  the  expedited  issuance  of  the \nmandate in each case.”8 \nDISCUSSION \nI. \n  We  have  previously  explained  that  “[i]ntervention  is  a \nprocedural  device  that

of  employers  and  their  employees  frequently  diverge, \nespecially  in  the  context  of  municipal  employment,  where  an \nemployer’s interests are often not congruent with the employee’s \nand the employer may argue that the employee was acting outside \nthe scope of his employment.21 This inherent conflict should have \nbecome

the  unions’  contention,  our  decision  to  leave \nJudge Torres’s order undisturbed will not encourage outside parties \nto race to intervene in order to protect their interests whenever a \ngovernment  defendant  could  decide  to  settle  a  lawsuit.  We  hold \nonly  that,  in  the  particular  and  highly  unusual  facts  and \ncircumstances presented here, it should have been readily apparent \nto the unions that their interests diverged from the City’s long before \nthe unions filed for intervention.  \nJudge  Torres  also  did  not  err  in  finding  that  granting \nintervention at this late stage would prejudice the existing parties. \nThe police unions moved to intervene after liability and remedies \nhad  been  adjudged.  “This  resembles  post‐judgment  intervention, \nwhich is generally disfavored because it usually creates delay and \nprejudice  to  existing  parties  .  .  .  and  undermines  the  orderly \nadministration  of

postponing \nresolution of this now‐settled dispute and frustrating both parties’ \ndesire  to  promptly  engage  in  agreed‐upon  reforms.  Intervention \nwould  disserve  the  balancing  interest  of  Rule  24  in  keeping  a \n“lawsuit  from  becoming  unnecessarily  complex,  unwieldy  or \nprolonged.”25 \nMoreover, we have serious reservations about the prospect of \nallowing  a  public‐sector  union  to  encroach  upon  a  duly‐elected \ngovernment’s  discretion  to  settle  a  dispute  against  it.  To \ncountenance this sort of practice, in this instance or any other, would \namount to condoning a collateral attack on the democratic process; \nwould prejudice the City; would not serve the interests served by \nRule 24; and would erode the legitimacy of decisions made by the \ndemocratically‐elected representatives of the people.26 \nOur reservations deepen when we note the relatively modest \ninterests the unions seek to advance and to which we now turn. In \nsum, we find that Judge Torres acted well within her discretion in \ndetermining that the unions’ motions to intervene were untimely.  \n \n

insubstantial  to  be \n“legally protectable.”30  \nThe  unions  argue,  for  example,  that  the  Liability  Order \n“accuses  the  entire  NYPD  of  [constitutional]  violations,  and \nidentifies sergeants by name, asserts that they are untruthful, and \nconcludes that numerous stops that they supervised, approved, or \nconducted broke the law.”31 They argue that, because the Liability \nOrder “brand[s] them lawbreakers and unconstitutional actors,” it \n“adversely  affect[s]  the  careers  and  lives”  of  their  members  and \n“cast[s]  doubt  on  the  ability  of  other  members  to  perform  their \nduties effectively while avoiding similar accusations in the future, \nwhich in turn affects officer and public safety.”32 \nJudge  Torres  did  not  err  in  finding  that  the  unions  had \nsubmitted no evidence to substantiate their claims of reputational \nharm. Aside from their own assertions, there was no evidence in the \nrecord showing that the union members’ careers had been tarnished, \n

police  officers  became  clear  when  plaintiffs \nwithdrew  their  claims  against  the  individual  officers  in  Floyd  in \nMarch of 2013. Any indirect reputational effect on individual police \nofficers is too “remote from the subject matter of the proceeding” to \nbe legally protectable.33 \n2. \nJudge Torres also properly found that the unions’ interest in \nprotecting their collective bargaining rights is similarly too remote \nfrom  the  subject  matter  of  the  Remedial  Order  to  be  legally \nprotectable.  \nThe Remedial Order requires changes to the NYPD’s “stop‐\nand‐frisk”  policies,  procedures,  supervision,  training,  and \nmonitoring. These changes fall squarely within the “management \nrights”  provision  of  New  York  City  Administrative  Code  §  12–\n307(b), which exempts from mandatory collective bargaining certain \n                                                 \n33 Brennan, 260 F.3d at 129. The unions also argue that under United States v. City \nof Los Angeles, 288 F.3d 391 (9th Cir. 2002), a decision by a sister Circuit that is not binding \nin this Circuit, they have an interest in the merits of a litigation that alleges constitutional \nviolations by police officers. In that case, however, a proposed consent decree had not yet \nbeen  entered,  and  the  police  officers  were  still  subject  to  individual  liability  on \nallegations of “misconduct and corruption.” Id. at 396. The interests of individual police \nofficers, and the police force generally, in City of Los Angeles were far more direct and \nsubstantial than the reputational interest asserted by the unions here. \n24 \n\nCase

its  organization  and  the \ntechnology of performing its work.”  \nThe unions have not shown in any meaningful way how the \nreforms  set  forth  in  the  Remedial  Order,  which  embodies  an \nagreement  between  the  City  and  plaintiffs,  would  have  any \n“practical impact” on “questions of workload, staffing and employee \nsafety” that are within the scope of the unions’ collective bargaining \nrights.35  To  the  extent  any  provision  of  the  settlement  agreement \nmight be said to affect collective bargaining rights, no provision in \nthe  agreement  prevents  the  unions  from  collectively

police \norganizations” “to be heard in the reform process,” and the City \ninformed us at oral argument that it does not object to appropriate \ncollective  bargaining  to  the  extent  that  issues

we  have  affirmed  Judge  Torres’s  denial  of  the \nunions’ motion to intervene, the merits of the underlying Liability \nand  Remedial  Orders  are  complex  and  controversial,  and  they \nindisputably  implicate  serious  questions  of  broad  constitutional \nimportance, as well as difficult evidentiary questions concerning the \nuse of statistical evidence.  \nHowever, because the City has decided to exercise its right to \nsettle these cases on the basis of an agreement to comply with the \nRemedial Order, we have no occasion to review the merits of either \nJudge  Scheindlin’s  liability  determination  and  challenges  to  the \nnature of plaintiffs’ proof, or the remedies she thereafter ordered. \nThe liability determinations are not part of the settlement and the \nRemedial Order has been accepted solely as the basis for the parties’ \nsettlement. Thus, nothing in this opinion should be construed as \naccepting or rejecting any part of the Liability and Remedial Orders \nissued by Judge Scheindlin. \nWhile the parties’ settlement may not be formally designated \na “consent decree” because it finds its basis in a post‐trial judicial \norder,

the \nsettlement, the Remedial Order adopted by the City in settlement of \nthese cases is projected to expire in five years upon a showing of \nsubstantial compliance by the City, and the monitor’s oversight will \nend in three years upon the same showing.45 Moreover, the District \n                                                 \n41 The Supreme Court has described a “consent decree” as “an agreement that the \nparties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be enforceable as, a judicial decree that \nis subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and decrees.” Rufo v. \nInmates of Suffolk Cnty. Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 378 (1992). We note that Judge Torres’s comment \nthat the Remedial Order and the parties’ settlement are “not a negotiated settlement or \nconsent decree where the parties have voluntarily ended their legal dispute” is not \nentirely accurate or relevant in the circumstances. \n42 United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 114 (1932). \n43 Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 448 (2009). \n44 Id. at 450 (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted). \n28 \n\nCase

This action, brought einbehalf of twelve New York City residents, one former\nNew York City resident, and a class of similarly situated individuals, challenges the New York\nCity Police Department's unconstitutional stop, question, search, citation, and arrest policies\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 2 of 52\nimplemented pursuant to \"Operation Clean Halls,\" aprogram that allows police officers to patrol\ninside and around thousands of private residential apartment buildings across the City. Each\nyear this program results in thousands of illegal stops, searches, summonses, and arrests ofthose\nbuildings' residents and their invited guests without cause.\n2. The abusive stop, question, search, citation, and arrest practices of New York City\nPolice Department (\"NYPD\") officers in buildings enrolled in Operation Clean Halls (\"Clean\nHalls Buildings\") stand in stark contrast to the program's professed purpose, which is to combat\nillegal activity in apartment buildings with records of high crime. NYPD officers routinely\ndetain residents of Clean Halls Buildings and their visitors without individualized suspicion of\nunlawful activity and make arrests or issue summonses without probable cause of criminal\nactivity.\n3. For residents of Clean Halls Buildings and their visitors, merely exiting a Clean\nHalls Building frequently leads to being stopped, searched, and interrogated by NYPD officers\non public sidewalks and in exterior courtyards. These stops typically involve full searches and\nquestioning as to the person's reason for having been inside the building, and frequently result in\narrest or the issuance of a summons if the person cannot affirmatively justify his presence to the\npolice officer's satisfaction.\n4. Such seizures also take place in the lobbies, vestibules, stairwells, hallways, and\nother public areas of Clean Halls Buildings, where residents are often illegally stopped, searched,\nquestioned, issued summonses, and even arrested without cause for allegedly trespassing inside\nin their own buildings. They are frequently stopped and forced to produce identification while\nengaged in completely innocuous activities like checking their mail or taking out their garbage.\nTo avoid arrests or summonses for trespassing, many residents of Clean Halls Buildings are\n2\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 3 of 52\ncompelled to carry identification with them whenever they exit their apartments for any\npurpose--including trips to the laundry room or to visit aneighbor.\n5. Illegal stops inside Clean Halls Buildings sometimes occur during floor-by-floor\nsweeps by NYPD officers, known as vertical patrols. Upon information and belief, hundreds of\nthousands of vertical patrols take place annually in Clean Halls Buildings. For instance,\ntestimony before the New York City Council Committee on Public Safety by Inspector Michael\nC. Phipps, the Commanding Officer of the NYPD' s Housing Borough Manhattan, indicates that\nthe NYPD conducted approximately 240,000 vertical patrols in privately owned buildings in\n2003 alone.\n6. Residents of some Clean Halls Buildings are stopped, questioned, and searched\nby NYPD officers on aregular basis-sometimes multiple times a week. For many young men\nof color in particular, being searched and seized by NYPD officers in and around their homes has\nbecome normalized and is simply aroutine part of their lives.\n7. The NYPD's illegal stop, question, search, citation, and arrest practices in Clean\nHalls Buildings mirror those in properties managed by the New York City Housing Authority\n(\"NYCHA Residences\"). But while the NYPD has recently adopted new regulations and\ninstituted limited training for officers concerning appropriate stop, search, and arrest activity at\nNYCHA Residences, it has ignored the problems of suspicionless stops, searches, citations, and\narrests in and around Clean Halls Buildings.\n8. The NYPD' suse of overzealous and baseless tactics harms not just residents of\nClean Halls Buildings, but also their guests, who are often seized in and around Clean Halls\nBuildings by NYPD officers when they visit. Residents of some Clean Halls Buildings warn\ntheir friends, family members, and others not to visit them for fear that they will be stopped,\n3\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 4 of 52\nquestioned, searched, and issued summonses or arrested for trespassing by NYPD officers.\nConsequently, residents of Clean Halls Buildings are restricted in their ability to maintain\nfamilial ties, friendships, and other relationships with individuals of their choosing.\n9. Upon information and belief, although Clean Halls Buildings are inhabited by\nNew Yorkers of all racial backgrounds, the residents of Clean Halls Buildings are\ndisproportionately black and Latino as compared to the City's population. Because the NYPD\ndoes not evaluate whether abuilding has substantial or sustained criminal activity that could\njustify its enrollment in Operation Clean Halls, these racial disparities persist without any\nmeaningful correlation to actual crime levels. The NYPD selects certain Clean Halls Buildings\nfor particularly aggressive tactics, where residents and their guests are at heightened risk of being\nstopped, questioned, searched, issued summonses, and arrested by NYPD officers. Upon\ninformation and belief, the residents of those targeted buildings are disproportionately black and\nLatino compared with the population of residents of all Clean Halls Buildings and with the\npopulation of New York City as awhole. As a result, the NYPD' sillegal stop, question, search,\ncitation, and arrest practices in and around Clean Halls Buildings have a significant disparate\nimpact on blacks and Latinos in their enjoyment of housing and in their receipt of municipal\nservices connected with housing as compared to whites.\n10. The NYPD's abusive practices of stopping, questioning, searching, citing, and\narresting residents of Clean Halls Buildings and their visitors without adequate cause violate the\nUnited States and New York Constitutions, the Fair Housing Act, and New York common law.\nPlaintiffs here, who seek to represent a class of similarly situated individuals, seek a declaration\nthat the NYPD' spractices are unlawful and an injunction against those practices.\n4\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 5 of 52\nPARTIES\nPlaintiffs\n11.

Operation Clean Halls is a citywide program operated by the NYPD that has\nexisted in some form since 1991. In some Bronx neighborhoods, virtually every private\napartment building is enrolled in the program, with hundreds of buildings in any given police\n6\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 7 of 52\nprecinct. In Manhattan alone, there are at least 3,895 Clean Halls Buildings. The program\noperates under the names \"Trespass Affidavit Program\" and \"Formal Trespass Affidavit\nProgram\" in Manhattan and Brooklyn, respectively. (All references in this complaint to \"Clean\nHalls\" or \"Operation Clean Halls\" refer to all such programs in all five boroughs.)\n33. Enrollment of aprivate residential building in Operation Clean Halls is\naccomplished simply by virtue of an executed \"Clean Halls affidavit\"-a boilerplate fonn on\nwhich abuilding's address is filled in that is signed by a landlord or managing agent. Clean\nHalls affidavits state that NYPD officers have permission to enter enrolled buildings and arrest\nanyone found within who is engaged in criminal activity. In the Bronx, Clean Halls affidavits\nconfer authority on NYPD officers to enter enrolled buildings \"into perpetuity.\"\n34. The NYPD has a widespread practice of stopping, questioning, and searching\nthose they encounter in Clean Halls Buildings without any suspicion of unlawful behavior, and\narresting them or issuing summonses without probable cause. (A summons is sometimes\nreferred to herein as a \"citation.\") All tenants of New York City's thousands of Clean Halls\nBuildings, their guests, and anyone in close proximity to the buildings are at risk of being\nsubjected to these unlawful practices.\n35. The rights of the individual Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent have\nbeen infringed by the NYPD's practices of unlawfully stopping, questioning, searching,\narresting, and issuing summonses pursuant to Operation Clean Halls.\nNamed Plaintiffs\nJaenean Ligon & J.G.\n36. Jaenean Ligon is a 40-year-old black woman who has lived for the past seven\nyears at 290 East 163rd Street in the Bronx, abuilding that is enrolled in Operation Clean Halls.\n7\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 8 of 52\nShe lives with her three sons, lG., J.A.G., and Jerome Grant. lG. and J.A.G., twins, are 17\nyears old. Jerome is 19years old.\n37. Ms. Ligon and lG. have been unlawfully seized, and lG. has been unlawfully\nsearched and arrested, pursuant to Operation Clean Halls.\n38. Ms. Ligon and her sons have been stopped, questioned, and searched without\ncause by NYPD officers in and around their building. Police officers typically stop Ms. Ligon's\nsons in front of their own home on East 163rd Street, at other locations on their own block, and\non surrounding blocks multiple times a week. During the course of such stops, they are usually\nquestioned about where they live and where they are going, and are searched without cause.\nMany of these stops have been made in connection to their building's enrollment in Operation\nClean Halls.\n39. In August 2011, Ms. Ligon asked J.G. to go to a store near their home to purchase\nketchup for use with the dinner she was preparing. J.G. walked to the store, purchased the\nketchup, and returned to their apartment building. Four officers, Jolm Does 1-4, two in plain-\nclothes and two in uniforms, stopped J.G. without cause just outside the front door of his\nbuilding and asked him why he was going inside the building. J.G. responded that he lived in the\nbuilding and produced identification. He told the officers that he had just returned from the store\nand showed the officers the bag in his hand, which contained ketchup. One officer asked J.G. to\nidentify the apartment in which he lived. lG. responded, telling the officer his family's\napartment number.\n40. The officers then rang the bell to Ms. Ligon's apartment. Over the intercom, Ms.\nLigon heard aman say that he was a police officer, and he needed her to come down to identify\nher son. Terrified that lG. was injured or dead, Ms. Ligon ran out of the apartment to find out\n8\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 9 of 52\nwhat had happened to J.G. As she approached the lobby she saw J.G. standing just outside the\nvestibule near the mailboxes, surrounded by four officers. She collapsed and began weeping.\nOne officer began laughing, asked Ms. Ligon if J.G. was her son, and handed her the ketchup.\n41. During the 2011 July 4th holiday weekend, Ms. Ligon and J.AG. were stopped\nwithout justification by NYPD officers shortly after they exited their building. They got into\ntheir car, and as Ms. Ligon drove down their block, two officers in an unmarked vehicle signaled\nfor Ms. Ligon to pull over. She complied with the order. The officers asked for permission to\nsearch J.AG.'s backpack. Ms. Ligon consented to the search, during which the officers found\nJ.AG.'s gym shorts and driver's manual. After joking about lAG.'s driving skills, the officers\nlet Ms. Ligon and J.AG. go. Upon information and belief, the only basis for the stop and search\nwas their emergence from their building, which is enrolled in Operation Clean Halls.\n42. Ms. Ligon's son Jerome was stopped without cause in the fall of 2010, as he\nretumed home from visiting Ms. Ligon's father, his grandfather. Ms. Ligon's father drove\nJerome home, and when they arrived, Jerome exited the vehicle. While his grandfather looked\nfor aparking spot, Jerome approached the front door of his family's building. Two NYPD\nofficers approached Jerome, asked him why he was entering the building and ordered him to\nproduce identification. Ms. Ligon's father saw that Jerome had been stopped, exited his vehicle,\nidentified himself as Jerome's grandfather, and asked the officers why they had stopped his\ngrandson. The officers proceeded to search Jerome without cause. The officers then let Jerome\nenter the building and Ms. Ligon's father left.\n43. Ms. Ligon, J.G. and their friends and relatives fear and face a substantial risk of\nbeing unlawfully stopped, questioned, searched, and arrested or cited for trespassing in and\n9\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 10 of 52\naround 290 E. 163rd Street by NYPD officers in the future because of the building's enrollment\nin Operation Clean Halls.\nFawn Bracy & W.B.\n44. Fawn Bracy is a 50-year-old black woman who has lived for the past 15 years at\n363 East 163rd Street in the Bronx, abuilding that is enrolled in Operation Clean Halls. She\nlives with her 17-year-old son, W.B.\n45. W.B. has been unlawfully seized, searched, and arrested pursuant to Operation\nClean Halls.\n46. W.B. is stopped unlawfully multiple times every week by NYPD officers in and\naround his building, particularly in the courtyard outside the building and on the sidewalk in\nfront ofthe building. He is also regularly stopped unlawfully by NYPD officers in the vestibule\nnear the building's mailboxes and in the building's stairwells.\n47. During the course of a stop, W.B. typically is asked whether he lives in the\nbuilding, ordered to produce identification, and searched, despite the lack of reasonable\nsuspicion of any crime.\n48. Police harassment in and around Ms. Bracy and W.B.'s building extends to adults\nas well as teenagers. Adults who live there cannot even gather in the building's courtyard.\nWhen Ms. Bracy gathers there with friends and neighbors, police officers sometimes approach\nthem, tell them that they are not allowed to sit in the courtyard, and order them without cause to\nreturn to their apartments.\n49. As aresult of interactions like these with police officers in her own building, Ms.\nBracy's relatives and friends are less willing to visit her at her home. She therefore receives few\n10\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 11 of 52\nvisitors at her home and is unable to socialize with her friends and neighbors in or around her\napartment building.\n50. Ms. Bracy's sister and nephew, who are W.B.'s aunt and cousin, used to visit Ms.\nBracy and W.B. at their home regularly but in recent years have been stopped often by NYPD\nofficers in the course of those visits. In an effort to avoid contact with police officers in Ms.\nBracy's building, they now visit far less frequently.\n51. Other family and friends seeking to visit Ms. Bracy and W.B. have also been\nunlawfully stopped, questioned, and searched in and around 363 E. 163rd Street.\n52. Ms. Bracy, W.B., and their friends and relatives fear and face a substantial risk of\nbeing unlawfully stopped, questioned, searched, and arrested or cited for trespassing in and\naround 363 E. 163rd Street by NYPD officers in the future due to the building's enrollment in\nOperation Clean Halls.\nW.B. &J.G.\n53. W.B. and J.G., who, as noted above, reside in Clean Halls Buildings, have also\nbeen subjected to suspicionless stops away from their block pursuant to Operation Clean Halls.\n54. On June 15,2011, W.B. and lG. were unlawfully stopped and arrested for\ntrespassing while leaving the apartment of their friend, Alex Lebron. Mr. Lebron's apartment is\nlocated at 1106 College Avenue in the Bronx, abuilding that is enrolled in Operation Clean\nHalls.\n55. At around 5:00 p.m., shortly after arriving at Mr. Lebron's apartment, W.B., J.G.,\nand their friend left to go to the store, intending to return immediately thereafter. Mr. Lebron\nstayed in the apartment.\n11\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 12 of 52\n56. As W.B., lG., and their friend walked downstairs from Mr. Lebron's apartment,\nthey encountered two NYPD officers, John Does 5-6, who were walking up the stairs. The\nofficers ordered the three teenagers to produce identification. After seeing that the\nidentifications indicated that the young men did not live in the building, the officers handcuffed\nall three and told them that they would be placed under arrest for trespassing.\n57. W.B., lG., and their friend told the officers that they were visiting their friend\nAlex and told them Mr. Lebron's apartment number. While one officer remained with the\nteenagers in the stairwell, the other officer walked up to Mr. Lebron's floor and knocked on the\nwall of Mr. Lebron's apartment. Mr. Lebron's mother answered the door, and the officer\nshowed her the identification cards of the three teenagers and asked whether she knew them. Mr.\nLebron's mother replied that she did and that they had just visited her apartment.\n58. After the officers left her door, Mr. Lebron's mother informed Mr. Lebron that his\nfriends had been stopped by police officers. Mr. Lebron went downstairs in an attempt to\nintervene and prevent their arrest. Mr. Lebron encountered his handcuffed friends and the two\npolice officers in the lobby of his building. He told the officers that he lived in the building and\nthat the teens had been visiting him. The officers responded that it was \"too late\" and placed the\nthree young men in apolice van.\n59. The arresting officers took W.B., J.G., and their friend to the 44th Precinct, where\nthey were locked in a cell. After approximately two hours, they were given summonses for\ntrespassing and released. The trespassing charges against W.B., J.G., and their friend were later\ndismissed.\n60. W.B. and lG. plan to return to 1106 College Avenue to visit Mr. Lebron. They\nfear and face a substantial risk of being unlawfully stopped, questioned, searched and arrested or\n12\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 13 of 52\ncited for trespassing there by NYPD officers in the future due to the building's enrollment in\nOperation Clean Halls.\nJacqueline Yates\n61. Jacqueline Yates is a 53-year-old black woman who works at a Head Start center\nwith pre-schoolers in the Bronx. She has previously worked as aNew York State correctional\nofficer.\n62. Ms. Yates has lived for the past 14 years at 361 East l63rd Street in the Bronx, a\nbuilding that is enrolled in Operation Clean Halls. She lives with her two sons, l8-year-old\nArtemus Robinson, and l-l-year-old M.R. Clinton Robinson, Artemus and M.R.'s father, is a\nfrequent visitor to Ms. Yates's home.\n63. Artemus and Clinton Robinson are frequently stopped without cause by NYPD\nofficers in and around 361 East l63rd Street, particularly on the sidewalks and in the building's\ncourtyard. They are also regularly stopped without cause by NYPD officers in the building's\nstairwells and vestibule, where the building's mailboxes are located. M.R. has been approached\nby NYPD officers in and around the building and ordered to return to his apartment at least three\nor four times.\n64. During such stops, Artemus and Clinton are usually asked whether they are\nresidents of the building and ordered to produce identification. They are also usually searched\nwithout cause.\n65. For example, the family was subjected to one incident with the police at their\nhome in late 2010. As the family was about to depart for ababy shower, NYPD officers stopped\nArtemus without cause in the vestibule of 361 East I63rd Street. Clinton saw NYPD officers\nspeaking with Artemus as he descended the stairs to exit the building and inquired as to why the\n13\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 14 of 52\nofficers had stopped his son. The officers then instructed Clinton to stand against the wall and\nfrisked him. The officers then released Artemus but issued Clinton a summons for possession of\nan open container in apublic place, even though the container he was holding was closed, not\nopen.\n66. Police harassment in and around Ms. Yates's building is so pervasive that adults\nwho live there cannot gather in their own courtyard. When Ms. Yates and Clinton Robinson\ngather with their friends and neighbors in their building's courtyard, police officers sometimes\napproach them and tell them that they are not allowed to sit in the courtyard and order them to\nreturn to their apartments.\n67. As aresult of interactions like these with police officers in her own building, Ms.\nYates's relatives and friends are less willing to visit her at her home. She therefore receives few\nvisitors at her home and is unable to socialize with her friends and neighbors in and around her\napartment.\n68. Some family members and friends of Ms. Yates and her children refrain from\nvisiting them because they fear being stopped or otherwise harassed by police officers in and\naround their building. Among Ms. Yates's cousins, those who are black men are particularly\nreluctant to visit. At least two have been stopped and searched without cause by NYPD officers\non the sidewalk adjacent to Ms. Yates's building and in the building's courtyard.\n69. Ms. Yates, her children, Clinton Robinson, and her friends and relatives fear and\nface a substantial risk of being unlawfully stopped, questioned, searched and arrested or cited for\ntrespassing in or around 361 E. 163rd Street by NYPD officers in the future due to the building's\nenrollment in Operation Clean Halls.\n14\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 15 of 52\nLetitia Ledan & Roshea J011l1son\n70. Letitia Ledan is a 41-year-old black woman who has lived since 2001 in Building\n30 of River Park Towers, aprivate residential complex in the Bronx that is enrolled in Operation\nClean Halls. Ms. Ledan works at Picture the Homeless, a non-profit organization.\n71. Roshea Johnson, a 36-year-old black man, is Ms. Ledan's brother and a frequent\ninvited guest of Ms. Ledan. Mr. Johnson previously lived in New York City and resided with\nMs. Ledan at River Park Towers for over a year. He moved upstate over a year ago, in part to\nescape the constant harassment he faced from the NYPD. He currently resides in Schenectady,\nNew York.\n72. Ms. Ledan and Mr. Johnson have been unlawfully seized and searched, and Mr.\nJohnson has been unlawfully arrested, pursuant to Operation Clean Halls.\n73. Ms. Ledan has often been stopped while in and around the building she lives in,\nwithout reasonable suspicion of any crime. She has been stopped while checking her mail,\nwalking out of her building, on her way to the elevator in the lobby of her building, and on the\nsidewalk outside of her building. During such stops, police officers typically ask Ms. Ledan\nwhether she lives in the complex and order her to show identification.\n74. When Mr. Johnson resided in River Park Towers, he was frequently stopped\nwithout cause by NYPD officers in and around his building, usually three to four times per week\nover the course ofthe time he lived there. In the course of those stops, he was typically asked\nwhether he lived in the building, ordered to produce identification, and searched, despite the lack\nof reasonable suspicion of any unlawful activity.\n75. In June 2010, Mr. Johnson was residing elsewhere in New York City but stored\nmost of his belongings at Ms. Ledan's apartment in River Park Towers. He had an open\n15\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 16 of 52\ninvitation from Ms. Ledan to visit. One day that month, he went to Ms. Ledan's apartment to\nretrieve some clothes he had left there.\n76. On his way out ofthe building, as Mr. Johnson walked on the pathway leading\naway from Building 30, ablack van pulled up in front of him. Two plain-clothes NYPD officers,\nJolm Does 7-8, emerged from the van and asked him what he was doing. Mr. Johnson replied\nthat he was coming from his sister's house, where he had gone to change his clothes but that she\nwas not home at the moment. The officers asked if he had anything on him and searched him.\nThe officers told Mr. Jalmson that he was not supposed to be there and that he was trespassing.\nMr. Johnson said he could show the officers mail in his pocket indicating that he was authorized\nto be there. He tried to reach into his pocket to show the mail, but the officers refused to look at\nit. Instead, they handcuffed Mr. Johnson and placed him in the police van. A third NYPD\nofficer who was in unifonn was also present.\n77. After placing Mr. Johnson in the van, the officers drove around with him, during\nwhich time they interrogated him about drugs and guns. Mr. Johnson repeatedly insisted that he\nhad no information about those topics. After driving around for approximately 30 minutes, the\nofficers stopped the van, unfastened the handcuffs, and released Mr. Johnson onto the street. He\nwas never formally arrested or charged with any crime.\n78. Since moving away from New York City, Mr. Johnson retums approximately\nthree times a year and stays with Ms. Ledan in River Park Towers. During those visits, he tries\nto avoid walking outside any more than is necessary, out of fear that he could be harassed or\ndetained by NYPD officers.\n79. Other relatives and friends of Ms. Ledan have often been stopped and ordered to\nshow identification by NYPD officers while coming to visit her without any apparent basis. For\n16\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 17 of 52\nexample, another of Ms. Ledan's brothers, Maurice Johnson, used to visit her regularly and was\nfrequently stopped without cause by police officers during those visits. As aresult, he is no\nlonger comfortable visiting Ms. Ledan at her apartment and has not done so in approximately\none year.\n80. Ms. Ledan, Mr. Johnson, and their friends and relatives fear and face a substantial\nrisk of being unlawfully stopped, questioned, searched, and arrested or cited for trespassing in or\naround River Park Towers by NYPD officers in the future due to the buildings' enrollment in\nOperation Clean Halls.\nKieron Jolmson & Jovan Jefferson\n81. Kieron Johnson is a 21-year-old black man who lives in the Bronx. He resides\nwith his wife, child, and mother-in-law at 1515 Selwyn Avenue, abuilding that is enrolled in\nOperation Clean Halls. He has resided there for two years; prior to that he lived for almost ten\nyears in aprivate house on the same block. He is enrolled in a G.E.D. program at the nonprofit\nBronxworks.\n82. Mr. Johnson has been unlawfully seized, searched, and arrested pursuant to\nOperation Clean Halls.\n83. Mr. Johnson is stopped, searched, and detained without cause by NYPD officers\non the block where he resides between two and six times per week. Two particular officers from\nthe 44th Precinct, Jolm Doe 9 (whose last name is Marquez) and John Doe 10 (whose last name\nis Rodriguez), frequently stop him even though they know that he resides on the block. NYPD\nofficers also stop him while he is merely walking past buildings enrolled in Operation Clean\nHalls.\n17\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 18 of 52\n84. For example, in the summer of2011, aNYPD officer stopped and searched Mr.\nJohnson while he was entering 1515 Selwyn Avenue, the building where he lives. He was\nordered to produce identification even though he told the officer that he lived in the building.\nThe officer took Mr. Johnson to his apartment, where his wife answered the door and verified\nthat Mr. Johnson lived there. The officer then departed.\n85. Mr. Johnson's relatives and friends are sometimes stopped, questioned, and\nsearched without cause in and around his building while visiting him.\n86. Mr. Johnson has also been stopped, questioned, and searched without cause by\nNYPD officers numerous times while visiting friends in Clean Halls Buildings on his block. On\nmultiple occasions he has been unlawfully arrested or cited by NYPD officers for trespassing.\n87. Jovan Jefferson is a 20-year-old black man who lives in the Bronx. He will soon\nbegin an internship at the nonprofit Bronxworks, and is also enrolled in an online university. He\nlives with his mother and 13-year-old brother at 1546 Selwyn Avenue in the Bronx, abuilding\nthat is enrolled in Operation Clean Halls. Mr. Jefferson has lived in that building since he was\nborn.\n88. Mr. Jefferson has been unlawfully seized, searched, and arrested pursuant to\nOperation Clean Halls.\n89. NYPD officers have frequently stationed themselves behind an elevator in the\nlobby of 1546 Selwyn Avenue, emerging when someone enters the lobby through the building's\nmain entrance. The person who enters the lobby is typically stopped, ordered to produce\nidentification, questioned, and sometimes searched, cited, or arrested. NYPD officers also\nroutinely patrol the sidewalk immediately in front of 1546 Selwyn Avenue, where they\n18\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 19 of 52\nfrequently stop, question, and search individuals, and sometimes cite or arrest them for\ntrespassing.\n90. Mr. Jefferson has been stopped without cause by police officers inside his own\nbuilding on multiple occasions, including several times by John Doe 9 and Jahn Doe 10.\nTypically, the officers who stop him order him to produce identification and search him.\n91. Mr. Jefferson's relatives and friends are frequently stopped, questioned, and\nsearched without cause in the lobby of his building while visiting him, sometimes even while\naccompanied by Mr. Jefferson.\n92. Approximately two to three times every month, Mr. Jefferson is unlawfully\nstopped and asked for identification by NYPD officers outside his building, outside his\nneighbor's buildings on his block, or while visiting friends who live in Clean Halls Buildings on\nhis block. The police often search him without cause during these stops. For example, one day\nin early 2012 the police demanded that Mr. Jefferson take offhis shoes in the middle of the street\nand searched between his toes. Mr. Jefferson is often stopped by NYPD officers while merely\nwalking past Clean Halls Buildings. NYPD officers also occasionally stop and question Mr.\nJefferson's 13-year-old brother on the sidewalk outside of their building.\n93. In approximately early 2009, when Mr. Jefferson was ajunior in high school,\nNYPD officers arrested him for trespassing in his own building. As Mr. Jefferson retumed to his\napartment to change clothes so he could play basketball with friends, NYPD officers stopped\nhim without cause as he was opening the front door of his building and ordered him to produce\nidentification. Mr. Jefferson did not have identification with him but told the officers he lived in\nthe building and offered to go up to his apartment to get his identification. The officers did not\nallow Mr. Jefferson to get his identification. They instead told him he was being \"detained\" for\n19\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 20 of 52\ntrespassing, handcuffed him, and placed him in apolice van. Mr. Jefferson's mother leamed that\nhe was being arrested and ran downstairs to intervene. She pleaded with the officers, explaining\nthat Mr. Jefferson was her son and lived in the building. The officers told her that it was \"too\nlate\" and took Mr. Jefferson to the precinct. Mr. Jefferson spent three nights in police custody\nand missed school as a result. All charges against him were dismissed.\n94. In another incident sometime in 2009, NYPD officers unlawfully stopped,\nsearched, and questioned Kieran Johnson at 1546 Selwyn Avenue as he was going to visit Mr.\nJefferson. Mr. Jefferson was not home and therefore could not vouch for Mr. Johnson's standing\ninvitation to come over to his friend's apartment. Mr. Johnson was issued a summons for\ntrespassing.\n95. In another incident in or around the summer of20l0, John Doe 10 and other\nNYPD officers again stopped Mr. Jefferson without cause in his own building. The incident\nbegan when a friend of Mr. Jefferson's arrived to visit him and was unlawfully stopped by\nNYPD officers in the lobby of Mr. Jefferson's building. Without verifying whether he was\nindeed a legitimate visitor to 1546 Selwyn Avenue, these officers accused Mr. Jefferson's friend\nof trespassing and handcuffed him. The friend's girlfriend saw what was happening from\noutside the building and called Mr. Jefferson in his apartment to ask him to come down and help.\nMr. Jefferson rushed down to the lobby with his older brother Jamel. When Mr. Jefferson\nprotested to the officers that they were arresting his visitor, Jolm Doe 10unlawfully detained and\nsearched him. Jamel, who is in the Navy, complained that the officers' conduct was illegal and\nshowed the officers his Navy identification card. Only at that point did the officers allow Mr.\nJefferson, Jamel, and the friend to leave.\n20\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 21 of 52\n96. In another incident an May 3,2011, Mr. Jefferson anived at his building with Mr.\nJohnson and another friend. While their friend remained outside, Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Jalmson\nentered the lobby ofMr. Jefferson's building. Jolm Doe 9 and John Doe 10, along with Officer\nJohnny Blasini and another officer, Jahn Doe 11, stepped out from behind the elevator in the\nlobby and stopped Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Johnson without cause. Mr. Jefferson told the officers\nthat he lived in the building and John Doe 10ordered him to go to his apartment. After telling\nthe officers that Mr. Johnson was his invited guest, Mr. Jefferson complied with the order. The\nfour officers then arrested Mr. Johnson for trespassing even though he had entered the building\nwith Mr. Jefferson, whom the officers knew was aresident. The NYPD held Mr. Johnson at the\n44th Precinct for seven hours and released him with a Desk Appearance Ticket that charged him\nwith trespassing. Mr. Jefferson wrote a letter attesting that Mr. Johnson was his invited guest\nand attended Mr. Johnson's arraignment, The trespassing charge against Mr. Johnson was\ndismissed by the court on July 12, 2011.\n97. As aresult of incidents like these, Mr. Jefferson is afraid of inviting friends and\nrelatives to his apartment, and has largely stopped doing so.\n98. Mr. Jefferson and his invited guests fear and face a substantial risk of being\nunlawfully stopped, questioned, searched, cited and arrested in and around 1546 Selwyn Avenue\nand other Clean Halls Buildings on his block by NYPD· officers in the future due to the\nbuildings' enrollment in Operation Clean Halls.\n99. Mr. Johnson, his family members, and invited guests fear and face a substantial\nrisk of being unlawfully stopped, questioned, searched, and arrested in and around 1515 Selwyn\nAvenue, 1546 Selwyn Avenue, and other Clean Halls Buildings on his block by NYPD officers\n21\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 22 of 52\nin the future due to the buildings' enrollment in Operation Clean Halls. He is afraid to visit Mr.\nJefferson at 1515 Selwyn Avenue unless Mr. Jefferson is with him and carrying identification.\nA.a.\n100. A.a. is a l7-year-old Latino male who resides in the Bronx.\n101. A.a. has been unlawfully seized, searched, and arrested pursuant to Operation\nClean Halls.\n102. On February 19, 2011, A.a. and two friends met after school and visited another\nfriend, Mr. Justin Drinkwine, in his apartment in the Far Rockaway neighborhood of Queens.\nThe apartment building, which is located at 22-59 Dix Avenue, is enrolled in Operation Clean\nHalls. Within minutes ofleaving Mr. Drinkwine's apartment, A.a. and his friends were\napproached and stopped on the sidewalk outside 22-59 Dix Avenue by NYPD Police Officers\nGregory Lomangino and Joseph Koch. At the time, the three teenaged boys were merely\nwalking alongside the building and were not engaged in any activity that might indicate or imply\nthat criminal activity was afoot.\n103. Officer Lomangino and Officer Koch accused the three of trespassing within the\nresidential apartment building located at 22-59 Dix Avenue. One of the boys explained that they\nhad just left 22-59 Dix Avenue where their friend resided and identified Mr. Drinkwine's\napartment number. Officer Lomangino detained A.a. and his friends on the sidewalk while\nOfficer Koch walked away from the group, heading in the direction of the building located at 22-\n59 Dix Avenue.\n104. During their detention and before conducting any investigation into whether A.a.\nor his friends had, in fact, been visiting a friend at the Dix Avenue apartment, Officer\nLomangino told the three teenagers that they would be arrested, When A.a. and his friends\n22\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 23 of 52\nasked why they were being arrested, Officer Lomangino pointed at the Operation Clean Halls\nsign on the building and said, \"You can't fucking read that sign?\"\n105. Within minutes, Officer Koch retumed, stating that he had gone into the building\nat 22-59 Dix Avenue and no one had answered the door at the apartment A.O. and his friends\nhad identified. A.O. explained that the teenagers had just been inside the apartment, described\nthe various people present in the apartment, and asked whether the officer had seen those people.\nP.O Koch promptly changed his story, asserting that he had spoken with aman inside the\napartment who informed him that no one had just left the apartment.\n106. The officers then handcuffed A.O. and his friends and transported them to the\n101st Precinct. The boys were held at the precinct for several hours and thereafter issued Desk\nAppearance Tickets charging them with criminal trespass.\n107. A.O. complied with the instruction on the Desk Appearance Ticket to appear in\nQueens Criminal Court on March 3, 2011. When he arrived, he was informed that the Queens\nCounty District Attomey's Office had declined to prosecute his case, as well as the cases of his\ntwo friends.\nAbdullah Tumer\n108. Abdullah Tumer is a 24-year-old black man who lives at 2249 Morris Avenue in\nthe Bronx, abuilding that is enrolled in Operation Clean Halls. Mr. Tumer attends a G.E.D.\nprogram and works as a volunteer at St. Bamabas Hospital in the Bronx.\n109. Mr. Tumer has been unlawfully seized, searched, and arrested pursuant to\nOperation Clean Halls.\n110. In the early evening on March 26,2011, Mr. Turner left his apartment with his\nfriend Angie Trinidad to go to an engagement party at their friend Jessica' shome.\n23\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 24 of 52\n111. On the way to the engagement party, they stopped at the apartment building of a\nfriend of Ms. Trinidad's so Ms. Trinidad could retum a sweater to that friend. That building,\nwhich is located at 2020 Davidson Avenue in the Bronx, is enrolled in Operation Clean Halls.\n112. Ms. Trinidad went inside the building to her friend's apartment while Mr. Turner\nremained outside. Mr. Turner waited just outside the door of the building and called another\nfriend on his cell phone.\n113. A few minutes after Ms. Trinidad had entered the building, three NYPD officers,\nincluding Defendants Officer Kieron Ramdeen and John Doe 12, anived and approached Mr.\nTurner without cause. One of the two defendant-officers snatched Mr. Tumer's cell phone,\nwhich was still connected with his friend, out of his hand. The officer asked Mr. Turner what he\nwas doing and whether he knew someone in the building. Mr. Turner responded that he was\nwaiting for a friend who was inside the building. The officer ordered Mr. Turner to produce\nidentification, which he did. The officer looked at the identification and said that Mr. Turner did\nnot live at the building, to which Mr. Turner responded, \"I know, I'm waiting for my friend.\"\nThat officer then went inside with another officer (not named as a defendant), taking Mr.\nTurner's cell phone and identification with him.\n114. Mr. Turner remained outside with the second defendant-officer, who continued to\nquestion him about his presence near the building. While that officer was questioning Mr.\nTurner, Ms. Trinidad came out of building, and Mr. Turner told the officer that she was the\nfriend for whom he was waiting. The officer then radioed the other two officers, who returned\nfrom inside the building. The officers ordered Ms. Trinidad to show identification and\nquestioned her.\n24\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 25 of 52\n115. While the other officers questioned Ms. Trinidad, the first defendant-officer\napproached Mr. Turner, pointed to the Operation Clean Halls sign on the building, and said,\n\"You see that? You're trespassing.\" He then handcuffed Mr. Turner and arrested him for\ntrespassing. At no time had Mr. Turner entered the lobby or any other part of the building.\n116. Mr. Turner was taken to the 46th Precinct and then to Central Booking. He was\nheld for a total of approximately 24 hours before being released. Mr. Turner was charged with\ntrespassing.\n117. Mr. Turner appeared in court eight times before the prosecution voluntarily\ndismissed the trespassing charges against him on February 28,2012. Each appearance required\nMr. Turner to spend between three and six hours at the court and often to miss school or work.\n118. Mr. Turner has also been subjected to police harassment in his own building due\nto its enrollment in Operation Clean Halls. For example, one night in late 2011, Mr. Turner left\nhis apartment with his younger brother, his friend, and his friend's nephew. The four walked\nthrough the courtyard oftheir apartment building and onto the sidewalk, on their way to a store\nto buy food. Three NYPD officers watched Mr. Turner and his companions as they walked\nthrough the courtyard and the officers approached them once they reached the sidewalk. The\nofficers stopped them and asked what they were doing in the courtyard. Mr. Turner told the\nofficers that he lived in the building, but the officers told him and his companions that they were\nnot allowed to stand in the courtyard. The officers further stated that they were going to leave\nand then return shortly and that the four had better not be in the courtyard when the officers\nreturned. Mr. Turner and his companions then proceeded to walk to the store as they had\nintended, and the officers followed slowly in a car until they entered the store.\n25\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 26 of 52\n119. Mr. Turner and his friends and relatives fear and face a substantial risk of being\nunlawfully stopped, questioned and arrested or cited for trespassing in or around 2249 Morris\nAvenue by NYPD officers in the future due to the building's enrollment in Operation Clean\nHalls.\nFernando Moronta\n120. Fernando Moronta is a 35-year-old Latino man who resides at 2035 Marmion\nAvenue in the Bronx, abuilding that is enrolled in Operation Clean Halls. Mr. Moronta works as\na store manager.\n121. Mr. Moronta has been unlawfully seized, searched, and arrested pursuant to\nOperation Clean Halls.\n122. On the afternoon of December 6, 2010, Mr. Moronta was walking home carrying\npizza for dÍ1U1erwith his girlfriend. Mr. Moronta ran into a friend outside ofthe friend's\napartment building at 2082 Crotona Parkway, abuilding around the corner from his own home\nthat is also enrolled in Operation Clean Halls. Mr. Moronta said hello and shook his friend's\nhand as the friend entered the building. Mr. Moronta did not enter the building.\n123. NYPD officer Joseph Bermudez then approached Mr. Moronta and asked, \"What\ndid you just sell him?\" The officer told him that he did not care about marijuana, just crack and\nheroin. Mr. Moronta responded that he had not sold his friend anything and that he did not have\nany drugs on him. The officer then frisked Mr. Moronta and searched his pockets three times\nwithout anyjustification. He then ordered him to \"go inside\" to the lobby of 2082 Crotona\nParkway. Mr. Moronta complied with the order and entered the lobby.\n124. Once inside, the officer ordered Mr. Moronta to sit on the ground. Two other\nNYPD officers in the lobby stopped and searched two other people. After a few minutes, Officer\n26\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 27 of 52\nBermudez told him to stand up with his hands against the wall. Mr. Maranta complied, and the\nofficer searched him again.\n125. At that point, Mr. Maranta became upset that he was being harassed and asked\nOfficer Bermudez why he was treating him that way. Mr. Moronta reiterated that he did not\nhave any drugs and even took offhis shoes to demonstrate to the officer that he was not hiding\nany contraband. Officer Bermudez then cursed at Mr. Moranta, handcuffed him, and told him he\nwas under arrest for trespassing.\n126. At no time during the course of this encounter did Officer Bermudez find any\ncontraband on Mr. Maranta. At no time did Mr. Maranta enter the building except when he was\nordered to do so by Officer Bermudez.\n127. Mr. Maranta was taken to the 48th Precinct and then to Central Booking. He was\nheld for a total of approximately 24 hours before being released.\n128. Mr. Maranta was charged with trespassing. He pled not guilty, and after ten court\nappearances his case was adjourned in contemplation of dismissal with immediate sealing on\nDecember 14,2011.\n129. On another occasion, in the winter of 2010, Mr. Moronta visited his brother at his\nbrother's apartment at 1453 Walton Avenue, abuilding that is enrolled in Operation Clean Halls.\nImmediately after Mr. Maranta exited the building, NYPD officers pulled up in avehicle,\nstopped him without cause, and asked what he was doing in the building. Mr. Maranta\nresponded that he had visited his brother. The officers asked where his brother lived, and Mr.\nMaranta told them the apartment number.\n130. The officers then ordered Mr. Maranta to accompany them to his brother's\napartment to verify that he had been visiting his brother. Mr. Maranta took the elevator with\n27\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 28 of 52\napproximately six officers to his brother's apartment on the sixth floor, where his brother\nverified that Mr. Moronta was in fact his brother and had just visited him. The officers then\naccompanied Mr. Moronta back downstairs and allowed him to leave. Mr. Moronta was not\ncharged with any offense.\n131. Mr. Moronta has also been unlawfully stopped outside of his own apartment\nbuilding on several occasions. During such stops, officers typically ask him what he is doing and\nwhy he is standing in front of his building, and allow him to leave only once they are satisfied\nwith his justification for his presence.\n132. Mr. Moronta and his friends and relatives face a substantial risk of being\nunlawfully stopped, questioned, searched, and arrested or cited for trespassing in or around 2035\nMannion Avenue by NYPD officers in the future due to the building's enrollment in Operation\nClean Halls.\nCharles Bradley\n133. Charles Bradley is a 52-year-old black man who lives in the Bronx. He holds a\nsecurity guard license issued by New York State and worked as a security officer at an apartment\ncomplex in the Bronx until January 2012. He is currently training for a new job.\n134. Mr. Bradley has been unlawfully seized, searched, and arrested pursuant to\nOperation Clean Halls.\n135. Mr. Bradley's former fiancée resides at 1527 Taylor Avenue in the Bronx, a\nbuilding that is enrolled in Operation Clean Halls. Mr. Bradley previously lived with his fiancée\nin that building but has since moved to his own apartment.\n136. On May 3, 2011, Mr. Bradley made arrangements to meet his fiancée at her\napartment. Around 5:00 p.m. that day, Mr. Bradley went to her building. Another tenant who\n28\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 29 of 52\nknew Mr. Bradley unlocked the door for him. Mr. Bradley proceeded to his fiancee's apartment\non the fifth floor. He knocked on the apartment door, but there was no answer. Mr. Bradley\nthen left the building and went outside. Mr. Bradley waited on the sidewalk outside of the\nbuilding.\n137. While Mr. Bradley was waiting for his fiancée to arrive home, an NYPD van\ndrove up and stopped in front ofthe building. Police Officer Miguel Santiago, who was seated\nin the van, whistled at Mr. Bradley and ordered him to approach the van. Mr. Bradley walked\ntoward the police van.\n138. Officer Santiago asked Mr. Bradley what he was doing. Mr. Bradley responded\nthat he was visiting his fiancée. Officer Santiago then searched through Mr. Bradley's pockets\nand ordered him to produce identification. Mr. Bradley said that he was a security officer and\ndid not have anything on him. Officer Santiago then said, \"You want to act like a fucking\nanimal? Fuck that. You're going inside.\" He then arrested Mr. Bradley for trespassing.\n139. Mr. Bradley was put in the police van and brought to the 43rd Precinct, where\nOfficer Santiago strip-searched him. He was held for approximately three hours and then issued\na Desk Appearance Ticket that charged him with trespassing.\n140. Shortly after his arrest, Mr. Bradley feared that his job as a security guard was in\njeopardy because the New York Department of State, which had issued his security guard\nlicense, sent him aletter indicating that he would be deemed ineligible to register as a security\nguard ifhe did not submit documentation of the status of his trespassing prosecution within 30\ndays. lfhe became ineligible to register as a security guard, Mr. Bradley would have been fired\nby his employer.\n29\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 30 of 52\n141. Mr. Bradley was required to visit the Bronx District Attomey' s office to request\nthat his case be heard as soon as possible so he could ensure that his security guard license would\nnot be jeopardized. He submitted to the District Attomey a letter from his fiancée indicating that\nshe lived at 1527 Taylor Avenue and that Mr. Bradley had been there to visit her when he was\narrested. The Bronx District Attomey declined to prosecute the case on July 13, 2011.\n142. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bradley secured documentation from the criminal court\nindicating that the case had been dismissed. He then went to his employer's office in Manhattan,\nwhere he presented the certificate of disposition to his employer's human resources department\nto ensure that his job was no longer endangered by his an-est.\n143. Each of the Plaintiffs has been injured proximately and directly by the\nDefendants, including being subjected to unlawful seizures, searches, and false charges,\ndeprivation of liberty, interference with intimate relationships, infringement of their right to\nenjoy housing and to receive municipal services related to housing.\nThe NYPD Has a Practice of Stopping, Questioning, Searching, and Arresting\nResidents of Clean Halls Buildings and their Visitors Without Justification\n144. The experiences of the individual Plaintiffs do not constitute isolated incidents.\nRather, they are part of a larger pattem and practice that exists within private residential\nbuildings enrolled in Operation Clean Halls. The challenged policies and practices are so\nwidespread and frequent as to constitute a custom and usage of the NYPD.\n145. The City of New York and Commissioner Kelly (together, \"City-Defendants\")\nhave enforced, promoted, authorized, and sanctioned the NYPD' s customs and practices of\nstopping, questioning, searching, arresting, and citing individuals, including residents, for their\nmere presence in and around Clean Halls Buildings.\n30\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 31 of 52\n146. NYPD officers frequently conduct suspicionless stops of people they encounter in\nthe lobbies, vestibules, hallways, stairwells, courtyards, and other common areas in and around\nClean Halls Buildings. In some Clean Halls Buildings, NYPD officers establish de facto illegal\nresidential checkpoints at times, stopping virtually all people who enter or exit the buildings,\nincluding residents, and requiring them show identification as they enter or exit the lobby,\nsubject themselves to a frisk or search, andjustify their presence in the building to NYPD\nofficers.\n147. NYPD officers also frequently stop people on sidewalks simply because they\nhave exited a Clean Halls Building, are entering a Clean Halls Building, or are merely standing\nor walking near a Clean Halls Building. During such stops, the individual is ordered to show\nidentification, searched, and questioned about his presence in or around the building.\n148. A report issued by a district attorney's office concerning a shooting that took\nplace in a Clean Halls Building confirms that NYPD officers make suspicionless stops in and\naround Clean Halls Buildings. Itdescribes NYPD practices as follows: \"Authority for\n[Operation Clean Halls] depends upon consent by a landlord or a group of tenants that allows\npolice to enter aparticular building and the immediate area and to stop anyone found there and\nask for identification. In carrying out Operation Clean Halls, the police go up and down the\nstairways in abuilding and around the grounds, stop all who are found, question them as to why\nthey are in the building or on the grounds, and ask for identification showing that they live on the\npremises or for an apartment number to verify a legitimate visit.\" (emphases added).\n149. Data collected by the NYPD on \"stop, question, and frisk\" activity, including in\nClean Halls Buildings, confirm that tens of thousands of stops for trespassing are reported\nannually. According to NYPD data, police officers made 329,446 stops of individuals upon\n31\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 32 of 52\nsuspicion of trespassing between 2006 and 2010, representing approximately 12.2% of all\nreported stops. Upon information and belief, NYPD officers made many additional stops of\nindividuals upon suspicion of trespassing during that period of time that were not reported.\n150. Only 7.7% of reported trespass stops resulted in arrest and approximately 4.9% in\nthe issuance of a summons. Weapons were found in only 0.2% of reported trespass stops-\ncompared to 1.1% of reported stops made on suspicion of any other crime-and contraband was\nfound in only 1.8% of reported trespass stops.\n151. In the 10precincts with the most reported stops made upon suspicion of\ntrespassing in 2010, at least 28,209 such stops were made-nearly as many trespassing stops as\nthe City's remaining 66 precincts combined. In the Bronx's 40th Precinct alone, police officers\nreported stopping over 5,000 people upon suspicion of trespassing that year. Suspicion of\ntrespassing provided the basis for nearly 30% of all reported stops in the 40th Precinct.\n152. A recent survey of men in the South Bronx found that residents of Clean Halls\nBuildings are routinely stopped by police officers in their own buildings. In October 2011 the\nDaily News questioned men of color on the street in three Bronx neighborhoods about their\nencounters with NYPD officers. A \"resounding complaint\" concerned patrols by NYPD officers\nin Clean Halls Buildings, during which \"cops patrolling apartment buildings ask to see entrants'\nkeys or IDs to make sure they are residents.\" One man described his recent stop by NYPD\nofficers-while he was putting his key into the front door of his building-during which he was\nquestioned as to his identity and forced to show identification. Another 17-year-old similarly\ndescribed arecent stop that took place when he was walking into his own building, during which\npolice officers searched his pockets.\n32\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 33 of 52\n153. At aNew York City Council hearing held on September 28,2010, officials ofthe\nCivilian Complaint Review Board (\"CCRB\"), the New York City agency responsible for\ninvestigating civilian complaint about police misconduct, presented data indicating that\ncomplaints concerning stops by NYPD officers in NYCHA Residences and Clean Halls\nBuildings were substantiated at a significantly higher rate than other complaints. The testimony\nof Mitchell G. Taylor, Board Member of the CCRB, indicated that the CCRB noticed \"an\nescalation in complaints\" concerning improper stops and questioning by NYPD officers in and\naround NYCHA Residences and Clean Halls Buildings. He further testified that areview of all\ncomplaints concerning police misconduct received between July 1,2008 and November 10,2009\nrevealed 237 complaints concerning stops by NYPD officers in NYCHA Residences and\nbuildings enrolled in Operation Clean Halls. Ofthose that were fully investigated, 32 percent\nwere substantiated, while only 11percent of complaints concerning stops in other locations were\nsubstantiated.\n154. People who are stopped by NYPD officers are routinely frisked and fully searched\nwithout adequate cause.\n155. Itis not uncommon for NYPD officers to issue summonses for trespassing to\npeople they stop inside and just outside of Clean Halls Buildings even though there is no\nprobable cause to believe that the stopped person has committed any crime or violation. In 2010,\nthe NYPD filed in court more than 15,800 summonses charging trespass. Upon information and\nbelief, many of those summonses related to Clean Halls Buildings.\n156. Although only atiny percentage of reported trespass stops lead to arrests or\nsummonses, thousands are arrested for trespassing in New York City annually. Upon\n33\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 34 of 52\ninformation and belief, a substantial percentage of such arrests take place in Clean Halls\nBuildings.\n157. Residents of Clean Halls Buildings and their guests are sometimes arrested solely\nfor failure to produce identification that matches the address of the building. Some are\nindividuals who enter a Clean Halls building with the intent of visiting someone who tums out to\nnot be at home; others are arrested based solely on their mere presence in or around Clean Halls\nBuildings. At times, individuals are arrested because they only know their friend's first name or\nnickname or know the apartment only by the location rather than by number. Further, upon\ninformation and belief, those who remain silent upon questioning by NYPD officers are routinely\narrested or issued a summons for trespassing.\n158. A police officer stationed in the Bronx's 46th Precinct described stops and arrests\nfor trespassing as \"standard practice\" in Clean Halls Buildings. In swam deposition testimony\nprovided in 2008, Police Officer Robert Bamett described Operation Clean Halls as follows:\n\"Landlords sign up to have us patrol their buildings periodically and we're permitted to ask\npeople coming in and out what their business is. If they cannot answer where they are coming\nfrom, we place them under arrest for criminal trespass.\" The officer further affirmed that it was\n\"typical\" for officers to arrest people for trespassing under these circumstances in the 46th\nprecinct and throughout New York City.\n159. This description underscores that stops conducted pursuant to Operation Clean\nHalls are regularly conducted without any suspicion of wrongdoing and that the outcome of an\nencounter with an NYPD officer in a Clean Halls building-either free to go about one's\nbusiness or placed under arrest-tums on whether an officer is satisfied with aperson's\nexplanation for his presence in the building.\n34\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 35 of 52\n160. In October 2006 NYPD Sergeant Reginald McReynolds was stopped in the\nstairwell of his girlfriend's apartment building, which is enrolled in Operation Clean Halls, while\nreturning to her apartment with a take-out Chinese food order. One officer asked Sergeant\nMcReynolds, \"What fucking apartment are you going to?\" McReynolds indicated that he was\ngoing to his girlfriend's apartment, and the officers threatened to arrest him for trespassing.\nIvelisse Cruz, McReynolds' girlfriend, took pictures of the incident as it unfolded and called 911.\nSergeant McReynolds's arrest was reported by major media outlets, including the New York\nDaily News, and CNN.\n161. Since 2007 there have been at least 16,000 misdemeanor arrests for trespass in\nNew York City annually, making it one of the highest-volume crimes charged in the City.\nBetween 2007 and 2010, over 37 percent of the criminal cases stemming from those arrests were\nresolved in favor of the accused, including dismissals, acquittals, or declination to prosecute.\nUpon information and belief, criminal cases that are opened against individuals arrested for\ntrespass in New York City are dismissed at ahigh rate relative to similar crimes.\n162. Given the high number of false arrests for trespassing, the criminal complaints\nand summonses filed in trespassing cases often lack sufficient detail to support a prosecution. As\naresult, New York City Criminal Court judges routinely dismiss as facially insufficient criminal\ncourt complaints and summonses charging individuals with criminal trespass in Clean Halls\nBuildings. Over four years ago, a Bronx County Supreme Court justice characterized the custom\nof unlawful trespassing arrests in Clean Halls Buildings as a \"dreadful practice,\" whereby\n\"[s]ome people get arrested simply for being in the lobby of aresidential building in which they\ndo not reside.\" The court further recognized the \"unacceptable harm\" that results from unlawful\ntrespass arrests, including inconvenience, humiliation, lengthy pre-arraignment imprisonments,\n35\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 36 of 52\nand a \"level of intrusion upon freedom [that] is unacceptable, especially when it appears to be a\nresult of an unlawful arrest\" and specifically appealed to the NYPD to \"better train its officers in\nthe realm of Criminal Trespass so that only true trespassers will be arrested, and innocents will\nbe spared.\" Over three years ago, another Bronx County court likewise noted that there are \"far\ntoo many occasions where the trespass arrests are not justified and innocent individuals are\nsimply caught in a trap while going about their everyday lives in aperfectly legal way.\" In both\ncases the court admonished prosecutors that innocent activities, such as \"paying an unannounced\nvisit to a friend,\" \"having a standing invitation to visit a friend or relative,\" and being \"in a lobby\nof abuilding that you don't live in\" constitute lawful activities that do not support an arrest for\ncriminal trespass.\n163. Trespassing cases resulting from arrests in or around Clean Halls Buildings are\nalso frequently not pursued after arrest because prosecutors decline to prosecute them. In many\ncases, prosecutors decline to prosecute individuals arrested for trespassing in or around Clean\nHalls Buildings because the initial stop and detention is unlawful, such as when it is premised\nupon mere presence in or around the building, rather than suspicious behavior. NYPD officers\nalso frequently fail to supply information that is sufficiently detailed to support criminal\nprosecution. According to a 2009 law review article, from 2005 to 2008, prosecutors declined to\nprosecute 11.2% of trespass cases-the fifth-highest declination rate among the 19highest-\nvolume crimes in New York City. In 2011 prosecutors declined to prosecute over 13% of people\narrested for trespassing in New York City.\n164. Upon information and belief, a substantial number of trespassing arrests that take\nplace in and around Clean Halls Buildings are made without probable cause of any unlawful\nconduct.\n36\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 37 of 52\n165. The stop, question, search, citation, and arrest practices ofNYPD officers in and\naround Clean Halls Buildings are so customary as to constitute official municipal policy. Many\nresidents of Clean Halls Buildings are subjected to these practices on aroutine basis, including\nsome who are stopped, questioned, and searched nearly every day. These practices constitute\njust one part of a citywide phenomenon of systematic suspicionless stops and arrests of\nindividuals in and around certain low-income areas. The other locus of such activity is,\ncollectively, the residential apartment buildings owned and operated by the New York City\nHousing Authority.\n166. As aresult of these practices, all residents of Clean Halls Buildings, their guests,\nand others in close proximity to the buildings are at risk of being stopped, questioned, searched,\nand even arrested or cited for trespassing for mere presence in or around a Clean Halls Buildings\nwithout suspicion of any criminal activity. In certain Clean Halls Buildings where the NYPD\nregularly deploys officers, residents, their visitors, and others in the vicinity are at heightened\nrisk of being subjected to these practices.\n167. The NYPD' spractices of stopping, questioning, searching, and arresting\nindividuals in Clean Halls Buildings interfere with the ability of residents and their guests to\nmaintain intimate relationships, and with the ability of residents to freely entertain guests in their\nhomes. For example, many residents of Clean Halls Buildings feel that they are unable to extend\nstanding invitations to visit to friends and family members because they may be unable tojustify\ntheir presence in the building to police officers. Further, many residents' friends and family\nmembers are less likely to visit Clean Halls Buildings because they fear being stopped and\nharassed by NYPD officers.\n37\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 38 of 52\nThe NYPD's Unlawful Stop, Question, Search, Citation, and Arrest Practices\nIn and Around Clean Halls Buildings Result from Improper and Inadequate\nTraining and Supervision\n168. Unlawful stops, searches, summonses and trespassing arrests in and around Clean\nHalls Buildings result from the improper training and instruction ofNYPD officers on the\nappropriate bases for those actions. For example, upon information and belief, the NYPD trains\nofficers to stop and question any person they encounter in a Clean Halls Building-even if there\nare no additional facts that make the person's presence in the building suspicious. Further, the\nNYPD has failed to implement any safeguards against unlawful arrests or citations in connection\nwith Operation Clean Halls.\n169. NYPD officers frequently fail to conduct investigations that are sufficient to\ndetermine whether there is probable cause to arrest individuals they encounter in Clean Halls\nBuildings. For example, when a stopped individual tells NYPD officers that he was visiting a\nfriend in aparticular apartment, the officers often refuse to accompany the stopped person to the\napartment and confirm the stopped person's account. Itis not uncommon for one officer to\nremain with the stopped person and another officer to say that he will go to the apartment\nidentified by the stopped person as the one he was visiting. The officer who claims that he will\ngo to the apartment does not actually go the apartment but returns quickly and says that no one\nanswered the door at the apartment or that the person who answered did not confirm\nacquaintance with the stopped person. The stopped person is then placed under arrest.\n170. In addition, the NYPD does not provide sufficient training to officers on\nconducting adequate investigations prior to arrest for trespassing. Upon information and belief,\nNYPD officers who patrol in and around Clean Halls Buildings are trained and instructed that\nwhen aperson who has been asked or ordered to show identification or otherwise justify his\n38\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 39 of 52\npresence in a Clean Halls building and the person refuses or declines to do so, such aresponse\nconstitutes probable cause that the individual is trespassing.\n171. The inadequacy ofNYPD officers' training and supervision are only magnified\nby the longstanding intense pressure on individual police officers to meet monthly numerical\ntargets for stops, arrests and the issuance of summonses. Most recently, Defendant\nCommissioner Kelly directed the release ofNYPD Operations Order No. 52, which explicitly\nendorses the use of \"performance objectives.\" These \"performance objectives\" pressure police\nofficers to stop, cite and arrest people without regard for the applicable legal standards. This\npressure is not balanced by adequate training on legal standards.\n172. Operation Clean Halls includes insufficient safeguards to ensure that people are\nnot wrongfully arrested or cited. For example, although Clean Halls affidavits state that tenant\nrosters of enrolled buildings must be provided to the NYPD, many are not. Even if landlords or\nmanaging agents agree to do so, it is not uncommon for them to fail to update them when tenants\nmove into or out of the building. Moreover, rosters that are provided frequently fail to list\nresidents who are not named on a lease, such as teenaged children.\n173. NYPD officers sometimes-although rarely-review tenant rosters or consult\nwith managing agents to ascertain whether a detained person is aresident of the building, but\nthese practices do not enable NYPD officers to accurately identify lawful visitors to Clean Halls\nBuildings. Of course, no tenant roster could identity other people who may be lawfully present\nin a Clean Halls Building, such as residents' visitors or delivery people. Similarly, residents'\nnicknames, by which some invited guests might know them, are highly unlikely to be listed on\ntenant rosters. As aresult, anNYPD's officer review of a tenant roster is insufficient to establish\nprobable cause for trespassing.\n39\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 40 of 52\nDeliberate Indifference in Failure to Train and Supervise\n174. City-Defendants have been aware of the incidents described above and the stop,\nquestion, search, and arrest practices ofNYPD officers in and around Clean Halls Buildings for\nseveral years. Yet City-Defendants have been deliberately indifferent to these practices and have\nnot attempted to remedy them.\n175. City-Defendants have received notice of the NYPD's stop, question, search, and\narrest practices in Clean Halls Buildings. City-Defendants are aware of the CCRB review of\ncomplaints lodged in connection with stops in Clean Halls Buildings that revealed ahigh\nsubstantiation rate compared to stops at other locations. City-Defendants are also aware of the\nhigh rate of declinations to prosecute trespass arrestees, the judicial admonitions relaying the\nhigh frequency of baseless and unlawful trespass arrests, and the class action litigation, Davis v.\nCity ofNew York, No. 1O-cv-699, that has been pending in the Southern District of New York\nsince January 2010 and challenges the NYPD's stop, question, search, and arrest practices in\nNYCHA Residences, which are virtually identical to those at issue in Clean Halls Buildings.\n176. City-Defendants responded to complaints about suspicionless stops, searches,\ndetentions, interrogations, and arrests in NYCHA Residences by amending the sections of the\nNYPD Patrol Guide, the NYPD' s official set of policies governing police actions, that address\nvertical patrols and investigations into trespassing in NYCHA Residences. The NYPD also\ninstituted limited training of police officers who patrol NYCHA Residences. The NYPD has not\ntaken any ofthose minimal steps to address the problems with its policies and practices in Clean\nHalls Buildings.\n40\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 41 of 52\n177. Until June 2010, the sections ofthe NYPD Patrol Guide that governed the use of\nvertical patrols in Clean Halls Buildings on one hand, and NYCHA Residences on the other,\nwere virtually indistinguishable.\n178. Section 212-59 of the Patrol Guide, which remains in effect, governs vertical\npatrols in Clean Halls Buildings. Itdirects commanding officers to \"[oJbtain permission of\nbuilding owner/authorized agent to conduct vertical patrol when private property is involved\"\nand provides that unifonned patrol officers should \"[cJonduct vertical patrol of assigned location\nand take appropriate police action.\"\n179. Section 212-59 of the Patrol Guide also simply directs unifornled patrol officers\nto \"[c[onduct vertical patrol of assigned location and take appropriate police action.\" Section\n212-60 of the Patrol Guide, which is listed as a \"related procedure\" and was in effect until June\n2010 and concerning vertical patrols in NYCHA Residences, similarly directed uniformed patrol\nofficers to \"[bJe alert for persons loitering within the buildings, or suspicious conditions,\" and to\n\"take note of unauthorized persons remaining in lobbies, basements, stair cases and rooflandings\nand take appropriate police action when necessary.\" Neither section provides any guidance as to\nthe factors an officer may consider in determining whether aperson may be lawfully stopped,\nseized, questioned, searched, or arrested for trespass, or the steps an officer should take when\nconducting an investigation into trespassing.\n180. On June 8, 2010, the NYPD issued Interim Order No. 23 (\"Interim Order\"),\nwhich addresses vertical patrols in NYCHA Residences and which superseded Section 212-60.\nThe Interim Order provides that \"an officer may not stop (temporarily detain) a suspected\ntrespasser unless the officer reasonably suspects that the person is in the building without\nauthority.\" Itfurther provides that following a stop an officer should \"[aJpproach the persones)\n41\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 42 of 52\nand ask; (1) Ifhe or she lives in the building (2) If he or she is visiting someone in the building\n(3) Ifhe or she has business in the building.\" The Interim Order also directs as follows: \"When a\nperson's authority to be present in the building is in question, take reasonable measures to verify\nsuch authority (e.g., asking for identification, akey to the building entrance doors, etc.).\" The\nInterim Order directs, \"If aperson refuses to explain or is unable to explain his or her presence in\nthe building, the officer may instruct the person that he or she must leave the building or be\nsubject to arrest for trespass. The officer may then arrest the person for trespass if: (1) The\nperson refuses to exit the building and does not promptly establish aright to be in the building.\"\nThe NYPD began training officers to comply with the Interim Order in the fall of 2010.\n181. There have not been any changes to the NYPD Patrol Guide sections addressing\nvertical patrols conducted pursuant to Operation Clean Halls in at least ten years. Upon\ninformation and belief, the NYPD has not conducted any specialized training concerning\nofficers' authority to stop, question, search, and arrest any individuals upon suspicion of\ntrespassing. Further, NYPD officers in Clean Halls Buildings frequently arrest or cite\nindividuals for trespassing without giving them the opportunity to either exit the building or\nestablish aright to be in the building.\n182. The NYPD Patrol Guide provides no guidance to NYPD officers conducting\nvertical patrols pursuant to Operation Clean Halls on who is to be stopped, seized, questioned,\nsearched, or arrested for trespass. The only guidance provided to NYPD officers in connection\nwith Operation Clean Halls is consistent with, and reflective of, apolicy, practice, and custom of\nstops and arrests for trespassing based on insufficient cause.\n183. City-Defendants have failed to make meaningful attempts to improve the training\nand supervision ofNYPD officers who conduct vertical patrols and stop, question, search and\n42\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 43 of 52\narrest people in buildings enrolled in Operation Clean Halls. In contrast, City-Defendants have\nrecognized the need for training of police officers who patrol NYCHA Residences on the\nappropriate standard for stopping individuals upon suspicion of trespassing as well as steps\nofficers should take to investigate suspicions of trespassing.\n184. Upon information and belief, the current training program does not include\nsufficient instruction on the elements of the offenses concerning trespassing in New York's\nPenal Law or the proper standards for and extent of frisks and searches. In particular, the current\ntraining program does not make clear that mere presence in or around a Clean Halls Building\ndoes not provide a sufficient basis to stop an individual and that mere presence in a Clean Halls\nbuilding without identification that lists amatching address is insufficient to provide probable\ncause for arrest. Further, NYPD officers are not instructed that investigation of infannatian\nprovided by an individual suspected of trespassing concerning the identity or location of the\nresident he or she claims to be visiting is required to establish probable cause for arrest.\n185. City-Defendants have failed to supervise and discipline NYPD officers who\nunlawfully stop, question, seize, search, and arrest individuals for trespassing. Upon information\nand belief, City-Defendants do not monitor improper stops, seizures, and searches for trespassing\nin Clean Halls Buildings. Nor have City-Defendants instituted any follow up procedure or\ndisciplinary action when charges are dismissed or where it is otherwise established that an\nindividual was arrested without probable cause.\nThe NYPD's Clean Halls Program Has aDisparate Impact on Blacks and Latinos\n186. The NYPD administers Operation Clean Halls and targets its stop, question,\nsearch, citation, and arrest activities in Clean Halls Buildings in amaimer that has a disparate\nimpact on blacks and Latinos as compared to whites.\n43\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 44 of 52\n187. The NYPD is responsible for enrolling buildings in the program in every borough,\nexcept Manhattan, where the District Attorney's office does so. There is no centralized oversight\nof Operation Clean Halls by City-Defendants or their designees. Upon information and belief,\nno single list of all buildings enrolled in the program exists.\n188. Although the purported purpose of Operation Clean Halls is to combat illegal\nactivity in apartment buildings, buildings are enrolled and remain in the program without regard\nto whether there is sustained or substantial crime in the building. For example, Clean Halls\nBuildings in the Bronx are enrolled \"into perpetuity.\" Therefore, residents of Clean Halls\nBuildings, their guests, and even people on sidewalks outside of Clean Halls Buildings are at risk\nof being subjected to the NYPD's practices of stopping, questioning, searching, citing, and\narresting people without the requisite level of suspicion even though their buildings are not\nnecessarily locations with sustained or substantial criminal activity.\n189. Upon information and belief, the residents of all Clean Halls Buildings are\ndisproportionately black and Latino as compared to the population of New York City as a whole.\nFurther, NYPD officers are more likely to be deployed to certain Clean Halls Buildings where\nthey aggressively stop, question, search, and an-est people they encounter in and around the\nbuildings. Upon information and belief, residents of those buildings are disproportionately black\nand Latino as compared to all residents of Clean Halls Buildings and to the population of New\nYork City as a whole. As aresult, the NYPD' s stop, question, search, citation, and an-est\npractices in and around Clean Halls Buildings have a significant disparate impact on blacks and\nLatinos in their enjoyment of housing and in their receipt of municipal services connected with\nhousing.\n44\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 45 of 52\n190. NYPD data reveal that the NYPD's trespass stop practices have a disparate\nimpact on blacks and Latinos. Blacks and Latinos are more likely than whites to be stopped by\nNYPD officers 'on suspicion of trespassing, and blacks and Latinos comprise ahigher percentage\nof people stopped for trespassing than of people stopped on suspicion of all other crimes.\n191. From 2006 to 2010, approximately 94.4% of those stopped for trespassing were\nblack and Latino, although blacks and Latinos comprised approximately 52% of the New York\nCity population. By contrast, for stops made on suspicion of all crimes other than trespassing\nbetween2006 and 2010,84.9% of those stopped were black and Latino. From2006 through\n20lO, only 4% of those stopped on suspicion of trespassing were white, although non-Latino\nwhites comprised approximately 33% of the New York City population.\n192. Thus, from2006 through 2010, blacks and Latinos in the City were six times\nmore likely to be stopped for any reason by police than whites, Asians, and Native Americans\ncombined, but 16times more likely to be stopped on suspicion of trespassing than whites,\nAsians, and Native Americans combined.\n193. Between2003 and 2011, a disproportionate number of blacks and Latinos were\nalso arrested for trespass in New York City. During that period, blacks and Latinos constituted\nover 90 percent ofthose arrested for trespassing; blacks were 12times, and Latinos 7 times,\nmore likely to be arrested for trespassing than whites, Asians and Native Americans combined.\n194. Upon information and belief, these data encompass a significant number of stops\nand arrests made in and around Clean Halls Buildings and reflect the disparate impact ofthe\nNYPD's Clean Halls practices on blacks and Latinos.\n195. The NYPD has a long history of conducting excessive stops in New York City\nneighborhoods largely populated by racial minorities. In 1999, for example, the Office ofthe\n45\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 46 of 52\nNew York State Attomey General reported that stops by NYPD officers in predominately\nminority precincts inNew York City occurred at a significantly higher rate than stops in\npredominately white precincts. The report also found that when stops did occur in white\nneighborhoods, the disparity between racial minority and white stop rates in those neighborhoods\nwas pronounced.\n196. The numbers of stops by the NYPD has continued to increase, to an all-time high\nof 685,724 reported stops in 2011. The racial disparities also continue. Blacks and Latinos\ncomprised 87 percent of all reported stops and 94 percent of all reported stops on suspicion of\ntrespassing by the NYPD in 2011.\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n197. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2), Plaintiffs will ask\nthe Court to certify as a class all residents of Clean Halls Buildings; all individuals, including\nfamily members, guests, and visitors of residents of Clean Halls Buildings, who seek to visit a\nresident of a Clean Halls Building; and all individuals who have been or are likely to be\nunlawfully stopped or arrested as aresult oftheir presence in or around Clean Halls Buildings.\nAll of these people are at risk of being stopped, questioned, searched, cited, and arrested as a\nresult of City-Defendants' policies and practices.\n198. This action satisfies all four requirements of Rule 23(a):\na. Numerosity: Joinder of all class members is impracticable because ofthe size of\nthe class and the fact that the class includes some members who Calmatbe identified with any\ndegree of specificity. Upon information and belief, tens of thousands of residents of Clean Halls\nBuildings and visitors of residents of Clean Halls Buildings have either been subjected to the\n46\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-SAS-HBP   Document 1    Filed 03/28/12   Page 47 of 52\nchallenged policies and practices or are at risk of being subjected to the challenged policies and\npractices.\nb. Commonality: There are questions oflaw and fact common to all members of the\nclass, including, but not limited to, whether City-Defendants maintain apolicy and practice of\nunlawfully seizing, searching, citing, and arresting residents of Clean Halls Buildings, their\nguests and others in violation of federal and state law.\nc. Typicality: The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the class.\nEach named plaintiff has been subjected to the challenged policies and practices by virtue of his\nor her status as aresident, or visitor of aresident, of abuilding enrolled in Operation Clean\nHalls, or simply by virtue of having been in the vicinity of a Clean Halls Building.\nd. Adequacy ofRepresentation: The Named Plaintiffs and class counsel will fairly\nand adequately represent the interests of the class. The Named Plaintiffs have no interests in this\nmatter that are antagonistic to other class members. Class counsel has many years of experience\nin civil rights and class action litigation.\n199. Class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief is appropriate under Rule 23(b)(2)\nbecause City-Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class\nas a whole.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n200. This action is authorized by 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 3613(a). Subject matter\njurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.c. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), 1343(a)(4), and\n1367(a).\n201.

The basic function of QAD is to sample documents \n(and now videos) to identify instances in which there might be a violation of law or policy.  Its job \nis not to oversee the officers or precincts being audited or to ensure that appropriate remedial action \nis taken.  Those functions reside elsewhere—in the supervisors at the precinct or elsewhere, such \nas in the Risk Management Bureau.  Nor is it QAD’s function to institute systemic reform, though \ntheir data can and should be used by others to do so. \nIn addition to the audits and self-inspections described in the Audit Plan, the NYPD is \nmaking other efforts to monitor the constitutionality of stops and frisks, including compliance with \nthe 14th Amendment, and to ensure the appropriate documentation of all Level 3 stops.  Those \nother efforts are not covered by this proposed Audit Plan.   \nQAD currently conducts four types of audits relevant to the remedial measures: \n(1) audits of stop reports, activity logs and associated BWC videos; (2) RAND audits to identify\nundocumented stops; (3) audits of police-initiated enforcement (called PIE audits), also to identify \nundocumented stops; and (4) audits of trespass arrests and Trespass Crime Fact Sheets (TCFS). \nArnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP  2\n250 West 55th Street  |  New York, NY  10019-9710  |  www.arnoldporter.com \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 792   Filed 07/27/20   Page 3 of 5\nQAD also oversees stop report and PIE self-inspections by commands and compares its results \nwith the results from the command self-inspections.  All of these activities are included in the \nAudit Plan being submitted with this letter. \nThe NYPD has revised its auditing protocols and methodologies many times during this \nmonitorship, often in response to suggestions from the monitor and the parties.  The proposed \nAudit Plan being submitted includes important improvements over the current protocols.  Most \nsignificantly, the plan being submitted calls for QAD to review BWC video corresponding to every \nstop report being audited.  In this BWC review, QAD will examine:  whether the encounter was \nrecorded in full or in part; whether the BWC video was consistent or inconsistent with the stop \nreport, and in particular, whether the video indicates that the stop report does not accurately \narticulate reasonable suspicion for the stop or frisk, or a legally sufficient basis for the search; and \nwhether the officer complied with the Right to Know Laws, including compliance with the consent \nto search policy.  This is a substantial increase in BWC review over the current protocols.  Also, \nunder current protocols, QAD reviews only a sample of BWC videos associated with trespass \narrests and police-initiated enforcement (PIE) arrests as part of QAD Trespass Arrests audits and \nPIE audits.  Under the proposed Audit Plan, QAD will review the BWC video associated with \nevery audited trespass arrest and PIE arrest. \nWith  respect  to  QAD’s  Stop  Report  audits,  there  is  also  a  change  in  the  sampling \nmethodology for determining which stop reports QAD will audit and a change in the schedule of \naudits.  Currently, for precinct commands, QAD auditors are auditing every other stop report \n(50%).  In the proposed Audit Plan, the number of stop reports audited in each command will be \nbased on a command’s annual number of stop reports prepared for the prior year.  For 50 \ncommands with the lowest number of reported stops in 2019, going forward in the proposed Audit \nArnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP  3\n250 West 55th Street  |  New York, NY  10019-9710  |  www.arnoldporter.com \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 792   Filed 07/27/20   Page 4 of 5\nPlan, QAD will audit 75% of stop reports.  For 29 commands that had between 60 and 119 reported \nstops in 2019, QAD will audit 50% of stop reports.  For 48 commands that had between 120 and \n249 stops in 2019, QAD will audit 40% of stop reports. And for six commands that had over 250 \nstops in 2019, QAD will audit 33% of stop reports.  This sampling methodology is anticipated to \nresult in more stop reports audited.   \nWith respect to the frequency of audits, QAD implemented a pilot program in which it now \naudits Patrol commands (precincts) on a weekly basis.  This frequency provides those commands \nwith timely feedback, allowing them to take appropriate corrective actions more quickly than \naudits conducted quarterly.  Under the proposed Audit Plan, this weekly audit protocol will also \nbe applied to Transit Districts, PSAs and selected Specialized Units.     \nOther changes from the current audit protocol include a requirement that QAD evaluate the \nsufficiency of supervisors’ review of stop reports by examining whether supervisors required \ncorrections to stop reports before approving them; and, when auditing trespass arrests and Trespass \nCrimes Fact Sheets (TCFS), auditors will determine whether a stop report should have been \nprepared, but was not.  In addition, under the new command self-inspection protocol being \nsubmitted, the ICOs at commands will review the BWC video associated with each stop report \nbeing evaluated as part of the command stop report self-inspection. \n  The NYPD will begin using the new audit protocols once the proposed Audit Plan is \napproved by the court.  The protocols, worksheet and templates used by the auditors are submitted \nto the court for its information.  It is contemplated that protocols, templates and worksheets for \naudits will continue to be revised in an iterative process to improve the Department’s process for \nidentifying and correcting errors.  Only material changes to the Audit Plan and the Command Self-\nInspections Instructions, however, will be submitted for court approval.  In addition, some aspects \nArnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP  4\n250 West 55th Street  |  New York, NY  10019-9710  |  www.arnoldporter.com \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01034-AT   Document 792   Filed 07/27/20   Page 5 of 5\nof the NYPD’s Audit Plan cover compliance with the Right to Know Act (steps I.B.5, I.B.6.f.iv \nandI.B.6.f.v).  These revisions to the auditing protocol were included for the sake of completeness. \nOther than the business card requirement, which was approved by this court, Right to Know Act \ncompliance is outside the scope of this monitorship, as previously noted by the court.

Therefore, steps I.B.6.f.iv and 1.B.6.f.v, other than the business card requirement, are not \nbeing submitted for approval. \nI believe that the proposed Audit Plan meets the requirements of the court’s order.  The \nCity has informed me that they support the approval of this recommendation.  The Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel have informed me that they have certain concerns that they plan to raise with the Court. \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Peter L. Zimroth   \nPeter L.

Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 540, 562 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2013) (the “Liability Opinion”).

This Court gave \nthe Monitor, among other duties, the duties of “work[ing] with . . . the parties to develop \nany . . . reforms necessary to ending the constitutional violations described in the \nLiability Opinion,” and “regularly conduct[ing] compliance and progress reviews to \nassess the extent to which the NYPD has implemented and complied with the Immediate \nand Joint Process Reforms.”  Id. at 677-78.

Supp. 2d 668 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)1; Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF Nos. 384, 473, \n877.2  \n \nOn July 29, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that the Court modify the Remedial \nOrder to provide more avenues for community engagement and involvement in the remedial \nprocess.  E.g., Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 840; see also, e.g., Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF \nNos. 373, 466.   \n \nOn August 25, 2022, the Monitor filed a letter appending a proposal for a community \nliaison position and a corresponding job description.  Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 888.3  In \norder  to  identify  suitable  individuals  for  the  position,  the  Monitor  established  a  selection \ncommittee consisting of representatives from Plaintiffs, the City (together, the “Parties”), and the \nMonitor team (collectively, the “Selection Committee”).  Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 897 \nat 2.  The Selection Committee jointly reviewed applications, identified candidates to interview, \ninterviewed the candidates and, “by consensus, recommended candidates to the Monitor and the \nCourt.”  Id.  The Parties also assembled a community advisory group, which interviewed the final \ncandidates and “provided their input directly to the Monitor.”  Id.  The Court interviewed the \nfinalists  and  has  decided  to  appoint  Germain  Thompson  as  the  community  liaison  (the \n“Community Liaison”). \n \nMr. Thompson is a community organizer at the Legal Aid Society, where he conducts and \ncoordinates  community  education  workshops  and  campaigns,  including  “know  your  rights” \nworkshops within the community.  In his role, he has organized rallies, protests, and lobbying \nefforts, coordinated voter registration events, and conducted surveys on community needs.  He \nalso regularly plans basketball tournaments to raise awareness and funds for youth and young \nadults impacted by gun, domestic, and street violence.  He has spoken at events on police reform, \nviolence, and community organizing. \n \nMr. Thompson was born in Queens, New York, and raised in South Carolina.  He graduated \nfrom the United States Air Force School and served in the United States Air Force.  He will be \ncommitted to the communities which have been negatively impacted by the NYPD’s stop-and-\nfrisk  practices  and  will  foster  relationships  within  those  communities  and  with  grassroots \norganizations. \n \n1 The Remedial Order also covers the constitutional violations at issue in Ligon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. 2274 \n(S.D.N.Y. March 28, 2012).  See Floyd, 959 F. Supp. 2d 668, 671 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).   \n2 On February 4, 2015, the parties in Davis v. City of New York adopted by stipulation the remedies set forth in the \nFloyd Remedial Order, including the appointment of the monitor.  Davis, No. 10 Civ. 699, ECF No. 330 (S.D.N.Y. \nFeb. 4, 2015).  On January 13, 2022, the Court appointed Mylan L. Denerstein to replace the late Peter L. Zimroth as \nmonitor.  Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 877. \n3 On September 9, 2022, in light of the Monitor’s proposal, the Court ordered supplemental briefing on Plaintiffs’ \nmotion.  Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 889.  Plaintiffs now request that the Court “hold Plaintiffs’ motion in \nabeyance for a period of sixty days following the finalization of the Community Liaison’s [p]lan,” or, alternatively, \nwere the Court to deny Plaintiffs’ request and motion, that “any such denial be without prejudice to move for similar \nrelief at some future date.”  Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 891 at 1.  The City of New York (the “City”) opposes \nPlaintiffs’ requests and motion, Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 892, and the Monitor requests that the Court deny \nPlaintiffs’ motion, Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 897.  The Court shall address Plaintiffs’ requests and motion in \na separate order. \n2  \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 520   Filed 12/16/22   Page 3 of 3\nAccordingly, the “Community Engagement Liaison Framework,” Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, \nECF No. 888-1, is ADOPTED, and the Community Liaison is directed to undertake the role and \ncarry out the functions set forth therein.    \n \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: December 16, 2022 \n  New York, New York \n \n \n3  \n ",

ECF \nNo. 819.  The Monitor also submitted under seal a letter explaining why such an order would be \nappropriate, along with exhibits identifying the Confidential Information.  ECF Nos. 820, 820-1, \n820-2, 820-3.  \n \nOn March 25, 2021, Plaintiffs filed under seal a motion to compel (the “Motion to \nCompel”), requesting that the Court direct the Monitor to (i) provide all parties equal access to \nan unfiled draft document being prepared by the Monitor’s team (the “Draft Report”), and (ii) \nfile on the public docket the Draft Report before it is shared with the Court, or show that the \nsealing of the Draft Report is narrowly tailored to serve a higher value, to comply with the \npublic’s constitutional and common-law right of access.  ECF No. 824.  The Motion to Compel \nrefers throughout to the Confidential Information.  Id.  Further, on April 8, 2021, Plaintiffs \nsubmitted under seal a brief opposing the Motion to Seal, arguing that the Court should unseal \nthe Confidential Information within the Motion to Compel, as well as within the documents \naccompanying the Motion to Seal, on the ground that the Confidential Information’s publication \nis required by the right of access.  ECF No. 829.  On June 1, 2021, the Monitor filed under seal a \nconsolidated response to the Motion to Compel and Plaintiff’s April 8 brief opposing sealing.  \nECF No. 836.  \n \nThe Court has considered the parties’ arguments regarding access to the Draft Report.  \nGiven the Monitor’s representation that no party will have access to the Draft Report, a directive \nrequiring equal access is not called for.  See ECF No. 836, at 4.  The Court also concludes that \nbecause the Draft Report has not been filed and is not finalized, it is not a document to which the \npublic’s right of access applies.  See, e.g., United States v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 863 F.3d 125, \n139 (2d Cir. 2017); United States v. Sater, No. 98 Civ. 1101, 2019 WL 3288389, at *2 n.3 \n(E.D.N.Y. July 22, 2019) (distinguishing internal court documents such as “early, unpublished \ndrafts of judicial opinions” from filed documents); cf. United States v. Erie Cty., 763 F.3d 235, \n240–41 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that final reports of a monitor submitted to the court are judicial \ndocuments).  For these reasons, the Motion to Compel is DENIED.  \nThe Court has also considered the parties’ arguments regarding the sealing of the \nConfidential Information.  The Court concludes that the First Amendment right of access does \nnot attach to the Confidential Information in the Motion to Compel, because the “logic” prong of \nthe experience and logic test required for the First Amendment right to attach—which asks \nwhether “public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular \nprocess in question,” Erie County, 763 F.3d at 239 (citation omitted)—is not met.  All \ninformation relevant to the public’s “overseeing” of the “matter of public concern” of the Court’s \nmonitorship of the New York Police Department is disclosed in this order.  Erie Cty., 763 F.3d at \n242.  Therefore, the filing of the Motion to Compel on the public docket would not play a \n“significant positive role” in the functioning of the Court’s decision-making process.  United \nStates v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 517 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting Press–Enter. Co. v. Superior \nCourt of Cal., 478 U.S. 1, 8–9 (1986)).  Further, after conducting an individualized review of \neach piece of Confidential Information, the Court has determined that although a weak common \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 482   Filed 07/30/21   Page 3 of 3\n \nlaw right of access attaches to the Motion to Compel, Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 50 (2d \nCir. 2019), that presumption is overcome by the need to preserve the free flow of information \nbetween the Monitor and the parties, cf. United States v. Glens Falls Newspapers, Inc., 160 F.3d \n853, 857–58 (2d Cir. 1998).  Finally, because the Confidential Information is referred to \nthroughout the papers—in both the briefing on the Motion to Compel and the Motion to Seal—\nredaction would not be practical.  See United States v. Pirk, 282 F. Supp. 3d 585, 602–03 \n(W.D.N.Y. 2017).   \nAccordingly, the Motion to Seal is GRANTED.  The Motion to Compel is DENIED.  The \nClerk of Court is directed to terminate the motions at ECF Nos. 819 and 824.   \n \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: July 30, 2021 \n  New York, New York \n \n \n3 \n ",

Supp. 2d 668 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)1; Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF Nos. 384, 473, \n877.2  \n \nOn July 29, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that the Court modify the Remedial \nOrder to provide more avenues for community engagement and involvement in the remedial \nprocess.  E.g., Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 840; see also, e.g., Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF \nNos. 373, 466.   \n \nOn August 25, 2022, the Monitor filed a letter appending a proposal for a community \nliaison position and a corresponding job description.  Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 888.3  In \norder  to  identify  suitable  individuals  for  the  position,  the  Monitor  established  a  selection \ncommittee consisting of representatives from Plaintiffs, the City (together, the “Parties”), and the \nMonitor team (collectively, the “Selection Committee”).  Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 897 \nat 2.  The Selection Committee jointly reviewed applications, identified candidates to interview, \ninterviewed the candidates and, “by consensus, recommended candidates to the Monitor and the \nCourt.”  Id.  The Parties also assembled a community advisory group, which interviewed the final \ncandidates and “provided their input directly to the Monitor.”  Id.  The Court interviewed the \nfinalists  and  has  decided  to  appoint  Germain  Thompson  as  the  community  liaison  (the \n“Community Liaison”). \n \nMr. Thompson is a community organizer at the Legal Aid Society, where he conducts and \ncoordinates  community  education  workshops  and  campaigns,  including  “know  your  rights” \nworkshops within the community.  In his role, he has organized rallies, protests, and lobbying \nefforts, coordinated voter registration events, and conducted surveys on community needs.  He \nalso regularly plans basketball tournaments to raise awareness and funds for youth and young \nadults impacted by gun, domestic, and street violence.  He has spoken at events on police reform, \nviolence, and community organizing. \n \nMr. Thompson was born in Queens, New York, and raised in South Carolina.  He graduated \nfrom the United States Air Force School and served in the United States Air Force.  He will be \ncommitted to the communities which have been negatively impacted by the NYPD’s stop-and-\nfrisk  practices  and  will  foster  relationships  within  those  communities  and  with  grassroots \norganizations. \n \n1 The Remedial Order also covers the constitutional violations at issue in Ligon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. 2274 \n(S.D.N.Y. March 28, 2012).  See Floyd, 959 F. Supp. 2d 668, 671 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).   \n2 On February 4, 2015, the parties in Davis v. City of New York adopted by stipulation the remedies set forth in the \nFloyd Remedial Order, including the appointment of the monitor.  Davis, No. 10 Civ. 699, ECF No. 330 (S.D.N.Y. \nFeb. 4, 2015).  On January 13, 2022, the Court appointed Mylan L. Denerstein to replace the late Peter L. Zimroth as \nmonitor.  Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 877. \n3 On September 9, 2022, in light of the Monitor’s proposal, the Court ordered supplemental briefing on Plaintiffs’ \nmotion.  Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 889.  Plaintiffs now request that the Court “hold Plaintiffs’ motion in \nabeyance for a period of sixty days following the finalization of the Community Liaison’s [p]lan,” or, alternatively, \nwere the Court to deny Plaintiffs’ request and motion, that “any such denial be without prejudice to move for similar \nrelief at some future date.”  Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 891 at 1.  The City of New York (the “City”) opposes \nPlaintiffs’ requests and motion, Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 892, and the Monitor requests that the Court deny \nPlaintiffs’ motion, Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 897.  The Court shall address Plaintiffs’ requests and motion in \na separate order. \n2  \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT   Document 520   Filed 12/16/22   Page 3 of 3\nAccordingly, the “Community Engagement Liaison Framework,” Floyd, No. 08 Civ. 1034, \nECF No. 888-1, is ADOPTED, and the Community Liaison is directed to undertake the role and \ncarry out the functions set forth therein.    \n \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: December 16, 2022 \n  New York, New York \n \n \n3  \n ",

For the reasons stated \nbelow, the motion is DENIED. \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 439   Filed 07/08/20   Page 2 of 11\nBACKGROUND \nI.  Ligon, Floyd, and Davis Cases \n  This long-running litigation addresses the NYPD’s stop, frisk, search, and trespass \nenforcement policies and practices.   \n  In Ligon v. City of New York, after a seven-day evidentiary hearing, on January 8, 2013, \nthe Court issued a preliminary injunction against the City of New York (the “City”), finding that \nthe plaintiffs would likely succeed in proving that the City, by its deliberate indifference, had a \npolicy of conducting unconstitutional stops in or near Bronx apartment buildings enrolled in the \nTrespass Affidavit Program (“TAP”), which permits the NYPD to patrol private buildings with \ntheir owners’ consent.  925 F. Supp. 2d 478, 486 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), amending and superseding \nLigon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. 2274, 2013 WL 71800 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2013).  In Floyd \nv. City of New York, after years of litigation culminating in a nine-week trial, on August 12, \n2013, the Court issued an opinion holding that the City had a policy of conducting race-based \nstops and frisks that ran afoul of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments (the “Liability \nOpinion”).  Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 540, 562 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).   \n  Given the similarities in the City’s constitutional violations in Floyd and Ligon, the Court \nthen directed the NYPD to institute certain reforms to remedy the unconstitutional stop-and-frisk \npractices in both cases (the “Remedial Order”).  Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 668, \n671 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).  The Court appointed an independent monitor (the “Monitor”) to oversee \nthose reforms, and directed the parties to participate in a community-input process under the \nguidance of a neutral facilitator (the “Facilitator”) to develop additional reforms.  Id. at 686–88.1 \n                                                \n1 On July 19, 2017, the parties in Ligon settled the outstanding claims, agreeing to significant reforms to the \nNYPD’s trespass enforcement practices, documentation, and training, and agreeing to continued participation in the \nremedial process.  See Ligon v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. 2274 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2017), ECF No. 296. \n2 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 439   Filed 07/08/20   Page 3 of 11\n  In Davis v. City of New York, the plaintiffs alleged unlawful, race-based enforcement of \ntrespass laws in New York City Housing Authority (“NYCHA”) developments.  The parties \nsettled the case on February 4, 2015, agreeing, among other things, that they would participate in \nthe Floyd and Ligon remedial process, and that orders issued in that process would be \nincorporated into the settlement.  Davis v. City of New York, No. 10 Civ. 699 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, \n2015), ECF No. 330 at 9–11. \n  Since this Court’s issuance of the Liability Opinion and Remedial Order, the Facilitator \ncompleted his Final Report and Recommendation, ECF No. 597, and the Monitor has submitted \nten reports detailing the progress of the monitorship.  See Tenth Report of the Monitor, ECF No. \n754.2 \nII.  COVID-19 Pandemic \n  In March of this year, with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, government officials \nbegan taking measures to address the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus.  After declaring a \nstatewide emergency on March 7, 2020, N.Y. Exec. Order No. 202 (Mar. 7, 2020),3 Governor \nAndrew M. Cuomo announced a stay-at-home order requiring non-essential businesses to \n“reduce the in-person workforce . . . by 100%” and banning all public gatherings, N.Y. Exec. \nOrder No. 202.8 (Mar. 20, 2020).4  Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency in New \nYork City on March 12, 2020.  N.Y.C. Emer. Exec. Order No. 98 (Mar. 12, 2020).5  The \nGovernor ordered all individuals over the age of two to wear a mask when in public, so long as \nthey could “medically tolerate” one.  N.Y. Exec. Order No. 202.17 (Apr. 15, 2020).6  Mayor de \n                                                \n2 Except as otherwise noted, ECF citations refer to the docket in Floyd v.

N.Y.C. Emer. Exec. Order No. 108 (Apr. 19, 2020).7  \n  On June 1, 2020, the Mayor imposed a City-wide curfew prohibiting all persons from \nbeing in public except for police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and other \nessential workers.  N.Y.C. Emer. Exec. Order No. 117 (June 1, 2020).8  Also excluded were \nhomeless people, and individuals seeking medical treatment or supplies.  Id.  Mayor de Blasio \nstated that the curfew was necessary because large gatherings increase potential spread of the \nvirus, and also because peaceful demonstrations in response to the death of George Floyd had \nbeen “escalated” by individuals accused of property damage and other crimes.  Id.  The curfew \nbegan on June 1, id., and was set to expire on June 8, 2020, N.Y.C. Emer. Exec. Order No. 119 \n(June 2, 2020).9  The Mayor, however, terminated the curfew one day early.  N.Y.C. Emer. Exec. \nOrder No. 122 (June 7, 2020).10  \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n  On May 26, 2020, Plaintiffs filed an “emergency motion” alleging that the NYPD has \nengaged in racially discriminatory enforcement of social distancing directives in violation of \nthree of the Court’s prior orders related to unconstitutional, race-based policing.  Proposed Order \nto Show Cause (“OSC”) at 1, ECF No. 759.11  Plaintiffs cite racial disparities in arrests and the \nissuance of summonses, and allege that the police have used excessive force in enforcing \nCOVID-19 rules.12  Floyd and Davis Pl. Mem. at 1, ECF No. 760.  Plaintiffs also express a \n                                                \n7 Cooper Decl., Ex. I, ECF No. 773-1 at 38–39.   \n8 Cooper Decl., Ex.

Supp. 2d 540, 562 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (the Liability Opinion); Floyd v. City of \nNew York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 668, 671 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (the Remedial Order); Floyd v. City of New York, No. 08 Civ. \n1034, 517 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2015), ECF No. 517 (order approving changes to the NYPD Patrol Guide). \n12 The challenged COVID-19 enforcement includes the NYPD’s enforcement of social distancing and mask-wearing \nrequirements and the stay-at-home orders.  Floyd and Davis Pl. Mem. at 2 n.1. \n4 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 439   Filed 07/08/20   Page 5 of 11\nconcern that the NYPD’s enforcement of the curfew was “likewise facilitating discrimination \nagainst Black and Latinx people.”  Floyd and Davis Pls. Supp. Ltr. at 1, 3, ECF No. 768. \n  Plaintiffs have submitted a statistical analysis prepared by The Legal Aid Society, which \nindicates that “18 of the 20 precincts with the highest rates of known social distancing arrests or \nsummonses per 10,000 people are in majority Black and Latin[x] precincts,” even though \n“slightly less than half (46.2%) of [31113 social distancing] complaints concerned violations” in \nthose areas.  Day Decl. ¶ 9, ECF No. 761; see also id. (“While four of the five precincts \nreceiving the most social distancing complaints through 311 were in neighborhoods that are \nmajority white, four of the five precincts with the most COVID-19 related arrests and \nsummonses were in neighborhoods that are majority Black and Latinx.  In this vein, 78.9% of \nsummonses and 74.1% of arrests for which The Legal Aid Society was able to identify a precinct \noccurred [in those areas].” (citations omitted)).  Plaintiffs also point to information released by \nthe Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office indicating that between March 17 and May 4, 2020, “of \n[the] 40 people arrested for social distancing violations in Brooklyn . . . [35] were Black, four \nwere Hispanic, and one was white.”  Id. ¶ 15.  Further, they present reports of encounters \nbetween police and Black or Latinx individuals where NYPD officers made allegedly \nunjustifiable arrests or used excessive force.14  Id. ¶¶ 17–26. \n  Plaintiffs request four forms of relief.  First, they seek a declaration that the NYPD’s \nenforcement of COVID-19 rules constitutes a violation of the Liability Opinion, Remedial Order, \nand an order approving changes to the NYPD’s patrol guide.15  Floyd and Davis Pls. Mem. at 1.  \nSecond, they ask the Court to direct the Monitor to investigate, and file a report evaluating the \n                                                \n13 “311 serves the public and handles all requests for government and non-emergency services . . . .”  NYC 311, New \nYork State (last visited July 8, 2020), https://www.ny.gov/agencies/nyc-311. \n14 The City disputes the facts of many of these encounters.  See City Opp. at 36–39, ECF No. 771. \n15 See ECF No. 517 (approving revisions to Patrol Guide 212.11, regarding “Stop and Frisk,” and Patrol Guide \n203.25, regarding “Department Policy Prohibiting Racial Profiling”). \n5 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 439   Filed 07/08/20   Page 6 of 11\nlegality of, the NYPD’s COVID-19 and curfew enforcement practices.  Id. at 23.  Third, they \nrequest an order prohibiting the NYPD from further enforcement pending the Monitor’s report \nand the Court’s determination on whether enforcement may continue.  Id.  And fourth, they seek \ndiscovery from the City, including officers’ written reports and body-worn camera videos, data \non summonses and arrests, and NYPD training and supervisory material related to COVID-19 \nand curfew enforcement.  Id. at 21–22; Floyd and Davis Pls. Supp. Ltr. at 1.  The Ligon Plaintiffs \njoin in the second and fourth requests.  Ligon Pls. Ltr. at 1–2, No. 12 Civ. 2274, ECF No. 420 \n(S.D.N.Y. June 2, 2020). \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Legal Standards \n  “Once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court’s equitable \npowers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable \nremedies.”  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971).  “Although a \ndistrict court has a wide range of discretion in framing an injunction in terms it deems reasonable \nto prevent wrongful conduct, it is nonetheless the essence of equity jurisdiction that a court is \nonly empowered to grant relief no broader than necessary to cure the effects of the harm caused \nby the violation.”  City of New York v. Mickalis Pawn Shop, LLC, 645 F.3d 114, 144 (2d Cir. \n2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Thus, “[a]n injunction is overbroad when \nit seeks to restrain the defendants from engaging in legal conduct, or from engaging in illegal \nconduct that was not fairly the subject of litigation.”  Id. at 145.  And a court does not have the \npower to restrain “acts unlike or unrelated to those originally judged unlawful.”  Id. (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).16  For subjects that fall within the scope of prior litigation, \n                                                \n16 It is not clear what legal authority Plaintiffs rely upon in their request for relief.  They claim to be seeking an order \n“pursuant to Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,” which concerns discovery, and “this Court’s inherent \nequitable power to enforce its own orders and judgments.”  OSC at 1.  The Second Circuit has noted that neither the \n6 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 439   Filed 07/08/20   Page 7 of 11\nthe determination of what measures are necessary and appropriate to enforce its orders is \ncommitted to the district court’s sound discretion.  See In re Tronox Inc., 855 F.3d 84, 112 (2d \nCir. 2017) (“The [d]istrict court plainly had jurisdiction to interpret and enforce its own prior \norder . . . .  The court’s choice of how to enforce the order is reviewed for abuse of discretion.” \n(internal quotation marks, citation, and alterations omitted)). \n  “The Court has the relevant authority as part of its inherent power to enforce its \njudgments, and it is clear that appropriate discovery should be granted where significant \nquestions regarding noncompliance with a court order have been raised.”  Abdi v. McAleenan, \nNo. 17 Civ. 721, 2019 WL 1915306, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2019) (internal quotation marks, \ncitation, and alterations omitted) (collecting cases). \nII.  Analysis \nA. Request for Declaration, Investigation, and Injunction  \n  Plaintiffs allege that during street encounters related to COVID-19 enforcement, the \nNYPD engaged in race-based discrimination.  Floyd and Davis Pls. Mem. at 2.  As examples of \nthis discrimination, they allege (1) racial disparity in the issuance of summonses and arrests in \npredominantly Black and Latinx neighborhoods as compared to lax enforcement of social \ndistancing in “crowded parks, synagogues, and bars frequented by white persons,” id. at 3–6, 18; \n(2) racial disparity in social distancing arrests as evidenced by data released by the Brooklyn \nDistrict Attorney’s Office indicating that between March 17 and May 4, 2020, 35 of 40 people \narrested for social distancing violations in Brooklyn were Black, four were Latinx, and one was \n                                                \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure nor case law permit a freestanding “motion to enforce,” and that although there are \nvarious methods for enforcement of a class action settlement (or an injunction), “[e]ach one of these (or other) \npossibilities, however, carries its own procedures, its own standards for granting relief by the district court, and its \nown standards of review . . . thus making identification of the precise nature of the motion an essential for \n[appellate] review (and, we believe, for the district court’s decision in the first instance).”  Martens v. Thomann, 273 \nF.3d 159, 172 (2d Cir. 2001).  At a minimum, however, a party requesting an order enforcing prior rulings must \nshow that the conduct complained of falls within the scope of the litigation.  \n7 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 439   Filed 07/08/20   Page 8 of 11\nwhite, Day Decl. ¶ 15; (3) use of excessive force in enforcement of social distancing against \n“Black and Latinx persons only,” Def. Mem. at 14–15; (4) stopping of individuals “with little or \nno apparent justification” in “situations [that] frequently started with social distancing and then \nescalated to stops and the use of force against bystanders,” id. at 15; and (5) contrast in “posture \nof the police toward the community” as evidenced by the tone and language of the public service \nannouncements broadcast by the NYPD in Queensbridge, a public housing development in \nQueens with predominantly Black and Latinx residents, as compared to those used in Nolita, a \nneighborhood in Manhattan with few Black or Latinx residents, id.17  \n  To be sure, some of the alleged police conduct described by Plaintiffs falls squarely \nwithin the ambit of Floyd v. City of New York.18  In that case, the Court determined that the \nCity’s policy of conducting suspicionless and racially motivated stops and frisks violated the \nConstitution, see Liability Opinion, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 658–60; Remedial Order, 959 F. Supp. 2d \nat 671, and ordered the NYPD to make changes to its policies, training, supervision, auditing, \nperformance evaluation system, and disciplinary process.  Remedial Order, 959 F. Supp. 2d at \n677–78.  The Court appointed the Monitor to assist the parties in developing and implementing \nreforms, and to report on the NYPD’s progress in complying with the Court’s mandates.  Id. at \n676–78, 686–87.  The Monitor’s work is ongoing and encompasses all suspicionless and race-\n                                                \n17 Approximately 48% and 33% of Queensbridge residents are Black and Latinx, respectively.  Census Tract 25, \nQueens, NY, Census Reporter (last visited June 29, 2020), https://censusreporter.org/profiles/14000US36081002500 \n-census-tract-25-queens-ny.  In Nolita, approximately 80% of residents are white or Asian, and approximately 10% \nare Black and Latinx.  Nolita (North of Little Italy) Neighborhood in New York, New York (NY), 10012 Detailed \nProfile, City-Data.Com (last visited June 29, 2020), http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Nolita-New-York-\nNY.html.  The Court takes judicial notice of the demographics of these neighborhoods.  See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b) \n(“The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally known \nwithin the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose \naccuracy cannot be reasonably questioned.”); see also United States v. Alvarado, 923 F.2d 253, 256 (2d Cir. 1991) \n(taking judicial notice of population statistics in the Eastern District of New York and accepting them as a proxy for \ncorresponding statistics about venire).   \n18 Plaintiffs do not allege that the NYPD engaged in racially discriminatory COVID-19 or curfew enforcement with \nrespect to NYCHA or TAP buildings, as would be required to bring their motion within the scope of the Davis and \nLigon cases, respectively. \n8 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 439   Filed 07/08/20   Page 9 of 11\nbased stops, including those which may have taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic.19  The \nCourt is not inclined to short-circuit that process. \n  Much of the police conduct alleged by Plaintiffs, however, extends beyond the \nsuspicionless and racially motivated stops and frisks addressed by the Court in Floyd.  For \nexample, Plaintiffs claim that in the course of enforcement related to COVID-19 rules, police \nofficers have disproportionately arrested and employed excessive force against Black and Latinx \nindividuals.  Floyd and Davis Pls. Mem. at 14–18, 20–21.  Plaintiffs also allege that the City and \nNYPD leadership have willfully ignored this conduct.  Id. at 19.  These claims are deeply \ntroubling.  But, whatever their merits, they do not fall squarely within the scope of the policies \nand practices adjudicated in this litigation.  Likewise, the request for a blanket injunction barring \nthe NYPD from COVID-19 enforcement, see Floyd and Davis Pls. Mem. at 1, would interfere \nwith a wide range of police conduct that is outside the bounds of this case, and would halt even \nlawful enforcement.  If individuals have been injured by racial bias in the NYPD’s making of \narrests or use of force in the context of COVID-19 or curfew enforcement, they have the right to \npursue those allegations in a plenary action.  But, in its discretion, the Court concludes that \nPlaintiffs’ motion seeking to apply the Court’s prior orders in the Ligon, Floyd, and Davis cases \nis not an appropriate vehicle to redress those claims.   \n  Pointing to two cases, Plaintiffs argue that a court can expand on the terms of a previous \ninjunction to address further violations of a similar type.  Floyd and Davis Pls. Mem. at 10–12; \nsee Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 684–85 (1978); Handschu v. Police Dep’t of New York, 219 \nF. Supp. 3d 388, 392–93 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).  It is true that “[i]n fashioning a remedy, [the Court \n                                                \n19 The Monitor has already committed to requesting from the City “information necessary to evaluate stops, frisks, \nsearches and trespass enforcement in the course of” COVID-19 and curfew enforcement, and to “assess and report \non that information in the ways, and to the extent, consistent with his mandate.”  Monitor Ltr. at 23, ECF No. 785.  \nThe City has agreed to comply with the Monitor’s requests.  Id. \n9 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 439   Filed 07/08/20   Page 10 of 11\nhas] ample authority to go beyond earlier orders and to address each element contributing to the \nviolation.”  Hutto, 437 U.S. at 687.  And this Court has done so by issuing a number of orders \naddressing factors that contributed to the constitutional violations identified in the Liability \nOpinion.  See, e.g., ECF No. 662 (directing the NYPD to “implement a program for \nsystematically receiving, assessing, and acting on information regarding adverse findings on the \nconduct of police officers involving illegal stops or illegal trespass enforcements” (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted)); ECF No. 767 (setting out required NYPD procedures for \nearly intervention to correct officer behavior that suggests a risk of engaging in illegal stops or \nillegal trespass enforcement).  But it is not within this Court’s authority to amplify its prior \nrulings to encompass a different set of potentially unconstitutional practices. \n  Accordingly, that portion of Plaintiffs’ motion seeking an order declaring that the City \nand NYPD are in violation of this Court’s earlier orders, directing the Monitor to investigate \nCOVID-19 and curfew enforcement involving police conduct outside the scope of this litigation, \nand enjoining the NYPD from participating in COVID-19 enforcement is DENIED. \nB.  Request for Discovery \n  To the extent that Plaintiffs’ request for information is related to alleged police stops, \nfrisks, searches, and trespass enforcement, such requests are already being addressed by the \nMonitor.  See Floyd and Davis Pls. Mem. at 21–22; Ligon Pls. Ltr. at 1–2.  Insofar as their \nrequests reach beyond that, however, Plaintiffs have failed to show that ordering such discovery \nfalls within, or would be an appropriate use of, the Court’s inherent power to enforce its \njudgments. \n  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion to compel discovery is DENIED. \n \n10 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02274-AT-HBP   Document 439   Filed 07/08/20   Page 11 of 11\nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ requests for an order (1) declaring that the NYPD’s \nenforcement of COVID-19 rules violates the Court’s prior orders, (2) directing the Monitor to \ninvestigate COVID-19 and curfew enforcement involving police conduct outside the scope of \nthis litigation, (3) enjoining the NYPD from enforcing COVID-19 rules, and (4) compelling \ndiscovery are DENIED.  See No. 08 Civ. 1034, ECF No. 759; No. 10 Civ. 699, ECF No. 502.  \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 430 in case number 12 Civ. \n2274. \nSO ORDERED. \n \nDated: July 8, 2020 \n  New York, New York                                                                                               \n11 ",
