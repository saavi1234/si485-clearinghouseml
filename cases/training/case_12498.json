Plaintiff, represented by the Texas Civil Rights Project, sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as nominal compensatory and punitive damages. </p><p>Galveston County Jail had implemented a policy in December 2006 that only permitted inmates who subscribed to Prison Legal News to receive it with special authorization from prison administration; otherwise, the publication was placed in their stored property. Plaintiff asserted that it did not receive notification of the change in the prison's policy nor did their subscribers prior to censorship. </p><p>On February 24, 2011, the case settled, and the Court (Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt) dismissed it accordingly (although retaining jurisdiction over the case for purposes of enforcing this stipulated judgment).  The settlement recognized that PLN is entitled to receive notifications of mail rejection from every publication that it sends, and the subscribers are allowed to receive their subscriptions unless there is a safety or security concern. The Sheriff must maintain a subscription to PLN for five years in the law library available to the prison population. The Defendant was ordered to pay $5,500 in damages.  The case is now closed.</p>",

Prison Legal News publishes a monthly 56-page legal information magazine (“the \npublication”)  dealing  with  the  rights  of  incarcerated  individuals.   T he  publication  provides \ninformation about, e.g., court access, disciplinary hearings, prison conditions, excessive force, \nmail censorship, jail litigation, visitation, telephones, religious freedom, prison rape, and the \ndeath penalty.  It has been published continuously since 1990.  The publication is core protected \nspeech,  which  is  not  objectionable  on s ecurity  or  other  grounds.   P rison  Legal  News  has \napproximately 7,000 subscribers nationwide, and six subscribers who are currently incarcerated \nin the Galveston County Jail.  \n11.  Plaintiffs  also  distribute  approximately  45 l egal  and  self  help  books,  some \npublished by plaintiffs and others by other publishers, regarding the criminal justice system, \nwhich are designed to foster a better understanding of criminal justice policies and to allow \nprisoners to educate themselves about basic related issues such as legal research, how to write a \nbusiness letter, health care issues and similar topics. \n12.  The Galveston County  jail’s “Inmate Handbook,” which was last updated in \nDecember 2006, provides inmates may only receive “books, magazines, or newspapers,” if they \nare  sent  through  the  mail  by  the  publisher,  and  with  prior  approval  is  received  from  jail \nadministration.  Approval is only granted “under special circumstances.”  This policy, as written, \nis an unlawful prior restraint.   \n  3 \n\nCase 3:10-cv-00251   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 06/28/10   Page 4 of 8\n13.   Although the jail’s “Inmate Handbook” does allow for inmates to receive “books, \nmagazines, or newspapers,” upon information and belief, prisoners cannot receive books or \nmagazines. When the editor of Prison Legal News called the jail, he was told by a sergeant who \nanswered the phone that prisoners cannot receive books or magazines from any source.  \n14.  Since creation of the policy, Prison Legal News has been unable to have its \npublication delivered to inmates in the jail.  This policy prevents Prison Legal News from \ncommunicating with its subscribers in the jail.   \n15.  Since the enactment of the policy, issues of the publication have been placed in \nthe inmates’ personal property upon receipt at the jail.  The personal property is only available to \ninmates at the jail upon their release.   \n16.  Prison Legal News did not receive any notice of the policy from the jail that the \npublication was being summarily censored.  It did not receive any opportunity to contest the \ndecisions preventing inmates at the jail from receiving its publication.   \n17.  Prison Legal News has never received any notice from Galveston County that the \npublication was being censored.   \n18.  On August 13, 2009, one of Prison Legal News’ subscribers, inmate Clarence \nCrawford, filed a grievance with the jail because he learned that on August 3, 2009, the jail \nconfiscated the book, Protecting Your Health and Safety, sent from Prison Legal News to Mr. \nCrawford, and denied him receipt of his Prison Legal News issue.. He received a response on \nAugust 14, from Lieutenant R.C. Delacruz, Jr., Director of Inmate Service.  It read “if you \nreceived the material and it was not authorized through proper channels the items were placed in \nyour property and a receipt should have been issued to you.”  Mr. Crawford was unable to \nreceive the book or publication.  No notice was provided to Prison Legal News that the book and \nthe magazine were censored. \n  4 \n\nCase 3:10-cv-00251   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 06/28/10   Page 5 of 8\n19.   On September 1, 2009, Mr. Crawford filed another grievance because he was not \nreceiving the publication. He received a response on September 4, which read “read the inmate \nhandbook on what you can have or can’t in this facility.”  \n20.  On September 18, 2009, one  of Prison Legal News’ subscribers, inmate Travis \nMullis, filed a grievance with the jail because he was not receiving the publication.  He received \na response on September 21, which read “read your inmate handbook and states in there what \nyou can have and what you cannot. Unless approval by Administration will only be granted \nunder special circumstances.”  Mr. Mullis’s copy of the publication was placed in his property.  \nOn September 22, 2009, the jail’s Inmate Property Record shows it confiscated from Mr. Mullis \n“1 Prison Legal News Package.”  The package contained an issue of Prison Legal News as well \nas the book Protecting Your Health and Safety. No notice was provided to Prison Legal News \nthat the book and the magazine were censored. \n21.  The  policy,  developed,  enacted  and  enforced  by  Defendants,  deprives  Prison \nLegal News of its constitutional rights of free speech and expression and its due process rights.   \nDefendants’ policy provides Prison Legal News with no alternative means of exercising its free \nspeech and expression rights by receipt, possession and enjoyment of otherwise legal reading \nmaterials such as magazines and newspapers.   \n22.  Accommodation of the free speech and expression and due process rights of \nPrison Legal News with respect to materials protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the United States Constitution will not have significant impact at the Galveston County Jail.   \n23.  Readily available alternatives exist to Defendants’ current policy which, at a de \nminimis cost, could easily meet any legitimate or significant interests of Defendants and the jail \nwithout sacrificing the free speech and expression rights of Prison Legal News and the inmates.   \n \n  5 \n\nCase 3:10-cv-00251   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 06/28/10   Page 6 of 8\nCAUSE OF ACTION I: FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION \n24.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 23 herein. \n25.  Defendants’ policy banning Prison Legal News,, books  and written materials \nviolates the free speech and expression rights of Prison Legal News secured by the First and \nFourteenth Amendments to the Untied States Constitution.   \n26.  Prison  Legal  News  has  a  constitutionally-protected  liberty  interest  in \ncommunicating with incarcerated individuals.  This right is clearly established under existing \ncase law. \n27.  Defendants’ policy does not further any legitimate penological interest.   \nCAUSE OF ACTION II: DUE PROCESS OF LAW \n28.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 23 herein. \n29.  Defendants’ policy banning newspapers and magazines does not provide Prison \nLegal News with individualized notice that its free speech and expression rights are being \nviolated.  No notice of the new policy was provided to Prison Legal News before the policy \nprevented the publication from reaching the inmates in the jail.   \n30.  Prison Legal News has a right under the Fourteenth Amendment to receive notice \nand  the  opportunity  to  object  when  Defendants  prevent  its  publication  from  reaching  its \nsubscribers.  This right is clearly established under existing case law.   \n31.  Defendants’ failure to provide notice to Prison Legal News that its publication \nwas being censored does not further any legitimate penological interest.   \nDECLARATORY RELIEF \n32.  Plaintiff requests all appropriate declaratory relief to which they are entitled. \n \n \n  6 \n\nCase 3:10-cv-00251   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 06/28/10   Page 7 of 8\nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n33.  Plaintiff requests the Court grant appropriate relief enjoining Defendants from \ncontinuing to violate its free speech and due process rights.   \nDAMAGES \n34.  Plaintiff seeks compensatory, punitive, and nominal damages for violations of its \nconstitutional free speech and due process rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments; \ninjuries to its business reputation; and loss of revenue.   \nATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS \n35.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, Plaintiff is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and \ncosts.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  THEREFORE, Plaintiff requests the Court: \n  A.  Declare that the rights of the Plaintiffs were violated. \nB. Award nominal, compensatory and punitive damages against all individual \nDefendants, in their individual capacities, as appropriate and allowed by law; \nC.  Award nominal and compensatory damages against all Defendants, in their official \ncapacities as appropriate and allowed by law; \nD.  Grant declaratory and injunctive relief under federal law, as set out in this Complaint; \nE.  Grant reasonable attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses and court costs; pursuant to 42 \nUSC 1988; and, \nF.  Grant all such other and further relief as appears reasonable and just, to which Plaintiff \nmay be entitled. \nDated: June 28, 2010         \n \n  7 \n\nCase 3:10-cv-00251   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 06/28/10   Page 8 of 8\nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n  /s/ Lauren Izzo       \n                Lauren Izzo \n                State Bar No. 24065482 \nScott Medlock \n                State Bar No. 24044783 \nJames C.
