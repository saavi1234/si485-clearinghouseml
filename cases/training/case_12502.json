The plaintiffs alleged that the County's plan to eliminate funding for Regional Support Team (RST) programs and the Transitional Community Opportunities for Recovery and Engagement (TCORE) program would put the plaintiffs at risk of institutionalization, as they would no longer have access to the services that ensure their successful placement in the community.  Although the County had indicated a desire to open new clinics to meet their needs, no plans had been announced. Thus, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin the County from closing the clinics.  </p><p>On June 9, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to immediately prevent the closure of the clinics and a motion for class certification.  The County filed its opposition to this motion on July 14, and on July 19, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a Statement of Interest supporting the plaintiffs' motion.  On July 21, Judge John A. Mendez granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, but denied their motion for class certification as premature.  </p><p>After a period of discovery and negotiations, the parties entered a settlement agreement in January 2012.  The consent decree gave the County one year to develop a new plan that would preserve adequate outpatient mental health care while cutting costs.  The agreement outlined a number of factors that the County would consider in developing its new continuum of care plan: peer-staffed clinics, help lines, intake procedures, etc.  The agreement also provided that the County would hold public meetings to provide mechanisms for public input into the process.  The consent decree expired in 2013, and the case is now closed.</p><p></p>",

INTRODUCTION \n \n2 \nThe United States files this Statement of Interest, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 517, because \n3 \nthis litigation implicates the proper interpretation and application of title II of the Americans with \n4 \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et. seq., (“ADA”).  In particular, this case involves title II’s \n5 \nintegration mandate.  See Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).  The Department of Justice has \n6 \nauthority to enforce title II, 42 U.S.C. § 12133, and to issue regulations implementing the statute, \n7 \n8  id. § 12134.  The United States has a strong interest in the resolution of this matter and urges this \n9 \nCourt to grant Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  The Superior Court of California \n10 \nissued a tentative ruling granting a preliminary injunction that may have an impact on this \n11 \npresent motion.  (See tentative California Superior Court ruling by Judge Steven H. Rodda, Item \n12 \nNo. 26, Attached as Ex. A.)      \n13 \n  This lawsuit alleges that Sacramento County’s redesign of its outpatient mental health \n14 \n15  service system puts thousands of Medi-Cal recipients with mental illness at substantial risk of \n16  institutionalization in violation of the ADA.  The County asserts that the redesign is necessary in \n17 \nlight of budget shortfalls; however, the County is simultaneously increasing funding for costly \n18 \ninstitutional care.  While the County argues that the same array of services will be provided \n19 \nunder the new system, the facts make it clear that plaintiffs will experience a significant \n20 \nreduction in services, putting them at risk of entry into unnecessarily segregated settings such as \n21 \nhospitals, psychiatric facilities, and jails.   \n22 \n23    Beyond the heavy human toll the County’s actions will impose on plaintiffs, they will \n24  also give rise to significant financial costs for the County.  The cost of providing plaintiffs with \n25 \nnecessary outpatient services is far less than the costs associated with unnecessary \n26 \nhospitalizations and institutionalizations that will be caused by the inadequate level of outpatient \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  1 \n \n \n\n \nservices.  Defendants attempt to frame the injury at the heart of this case as one of “fear of \n1 \nchange”; however, this characterization ignores the very real injury recognized by Olmstead, the \n2 \n3  risk of plaintiffs having to enter institutional placements and hospital emergency rooms due to \n4  insufficient community care. \n5 \nII.  SUMMARY OF FACTS \n \n6 \nA.  Sacramento County’s Current Outpatient Mental Health Services Are Provided \n7  Through County Contracted Regional Support Teams. \n \n8 \nSacramento County provides outpatient mental health services to thousands of Medi-Cal \n9 \nrecipients through four regional centers, Regional Support Teams (RSTs), run by non-profit \n10 \nentities.  (Declaration of Beth Stoneking, DKT 49, ¶¶13, 19.)  Each of the named plaintiffs has \n11 \nreceived community mental health services under the current system for many years (ranging \n12 \nfrom 2 to 10 years).  (Declaration of Leslie Napper, DKT 41, ¶2; Declaration of Jacquie \n13 \nEichhorn-Smith Decl., DKT 30, ¶1; Declaration of Jan Fischer, DKT 31,¶2; Declaration of \n14 \n15  Lynda Mangio, DKT 40, ¶13; Declaration of Ted Yanello, DKT 51, ¶3.)  The RSTs currently \n16 \nserve a population of individuals with significant mental health needs, as those with less severe \n17 \nneeds were terminated from the County’s outpatient mental health programs last year.  \n18 \n(Supplemental Declaration of Dr. Michael Franczak, DKT 99-6, ¶15.)  Plaintiffs are individuals \n19 \nwith a variety of mental illnesses, including Chronic Severe Depression, Post Traumatic Stress \n20 \nDisorder, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder, among others.  (Mangio Decl. ¶2; \n21 \n22  Fischer Decl. ¶2, Eichhorn-Smith Decl. ¶2; Yanello Decl. ¶2; Declaration of Alan Cummings, \n23  DKT 28, ¶4, Declaration of Edraline Powell, DKT 44, ¶4; Declaration of Teresa Johnson, DKT \n24 \n37, ¶2; Declaration of Channel Kirby, DKT 38, ¶2; Boynton Decl. ¶3; Napper Decl. ¶2; \n25 \nDeclaration of Linda Connors, DKT 27, ¶1.) \n26 \nThe RSTs develop individual treatment plans for each client that combine “medication, \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  2 \n \n \n\n \npsychosocial therapy, group counseling, peer support, and self-help, and many opportunities for \n1 \nlearning life skills and developing resources to integrate into their communities.”  (Stoneking \n2 \n3  Decl. ¶21.)  Additionally, RSTs provide community integration services including assistance \n4  with accessing public transportation, locating and maintaining housing, and assisting clients with \n5 \nskills to help build relationships with friends and family. (Kirby Decl. ¶11; T. Johnson Decl. ¶5; \n6 \nDeclaration of Rania Haidary, DKT 33, ¶5; Eichhorn-Smith Decl. ¶8; Declaration of John Buck, \n7 \nDKT 25, ¶1; Declaration of Lynn Place, DKT 43,  ¶10).  In addition to the services available \n8 \nthrough RSTs, the County provides services through Transitional Community Opportunities for \n9 \nRecovery and Engagement (“TCORE”).  (Declaration of Frank Cline, DKT 26, ¶7; Place Decl. \n10 \n11  ¶26.)  TCORE provides “short-term intensive services to people being discharged from hospitals \n12  and who are not receiving any mental health services.  TCORE tries to reduce or prevent the \n13 \nneed for crisis services, hospitalizations, and institutionalization by increasing the linkage to \n14 \ncommunity-based services for the unserved and underserved.”  (Cline Decl. ¶7.)   \n15 \nB.  Sacramento County’s Plan to Transition All Clients From the County Contracted \n16 \nRegional Support Teams to County Operated Clinics. \n \n17 \n  On June 17, 2010, the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors approved a $2.9 million \n18 \ndollar plan to restructure the outpatient mental health system by closing the RSTs and replacing \n19 \nthem with new county-run clinics, staffed by county employees.  (Declaration of Kelli Weaver, \n20 \nDKT 91, at 6; Declaration of Mary Ann Bennett, DKT 88, at 3 and Ex. B at 3, “Department of \n21 \n22  Health and Human Services Proposal to Restructure the County’s Adult Outpatient Mental \n23  Health Services System.”)  This decision was largely driven by two factors.  First, the County \n24 \ncreated a budget shortfall in the adult outpatient system when it shifted discretionary realignment \n25 \nrevenues – approximately $3.2 million – from community-based services to institutional care at \n26 \nits 50-bed locked inpatient facility, the Mental Health Treatment Center.  (Bennett Decl. at 2, 5; \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  3 \n \n \n\n \nDeposition of Mary Ann Bennett, attached as Ex. B, 33:11-13.)  Second, the County sought to \n1 \nprotect the jobs of 40 County employees – as opposed to maintaining jobs at the RSTs – who \n2 \n3  were originally given layoff notices for reduction in other County departments.  (Bennett Decl. at \n4  5; Bennett Dep. at 60:24-61:18, 132:5-13, Ex. B.)   \n5 \n  Many details regarding the transition itself and the level of services that will be provided \n6 \nat the County clinics remain unresolved with transitions slated to begin as early as 10 days from \n7 \nthe date of the scheduled preliminary injunction hearing.  For instance, defendants have failed to \n8 \nprovide any concrete details on central issues, including when the County will get state approval \n9 \non its plan (and whether MHSA funds will be authorized); whether the facilities can actually \n10 \n11  begin transitioning clients on August 1; what information will be provided to individuals calling \n12  the phone bank; what protocol is in place to deal with consumers who have concerns; what steps \n13 \nhave been taken to identify individuals with unusual needs; what tracking will be done for \n14 \nindividuals who miss appointments; whether clinical staff will meet language needs (beyond the \n15 \nuse of interpreters); whether any medical records have changed hands; what the contingency plan \n16 \nwill be if the number of transfers cannot be completed under the current timeline; whether \n17 \nadditional staffing is needed to front-load intake time; what steps will be taken for no-shows; \n18 \n19  whether site visits / in-home visits will occur as follow-ups; what experience (if any) the County \n20 \nstaff have with regards to delivering mental health services using the recovery model; what \n21 \ntraining the County staff will receive. (Bennett Dep. at 69:13-70:18, 78:20-79:2, 92:5-20, 95:15-\n22 \n21; 86:15-17, 88:24-89:3, 96:15-97:1, 98:24-99:5, 101:25-102-5, 103:1-22, 107:11-22, 134:12-\n23 \n14, 138:13-139:6, Ex. B.; Stoneking Second Supp. Decl. ¶8.)   \n24 \n \n25 \n26   \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  4 \n \n \n\n \n \n1 \nIII.  ARGUMENT \n2 \n \n3  A.  Olmstead and the Integration Mandate. \n \n4    Congress enacted the ADA in 1990 “to provide a clear and comprehensive national \n5 \nmandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.”  42 U.S.C.  \n6 \n§ 12101(b)(1).  Congress found that “historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate \n7 \nindividuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination \n8 \nagainst individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.”  \n9 \n42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2).  For those reasons, Congress prohibited discrimination against \n10 \n11  individuals with disabilities by public entities.  \n12  [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded \nfrom participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \n13 \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity. \n \n14 \n42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n15 \n  As directed by Congress, 42 U.S.C. § 12134, the Attorney General issued regulations \n16 \nimplementing title II, which are based on regulations issued under section 504 of the \n17 \nRehabilitation Act.1  See 42 U.S.C. § 12134(a);  28 C.F.R. § 35.190(a); Executive Order 12250, \n18 \n19 \n                                                 \n20  1 Title II was modeled closely on Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, \nwhich prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in federally conducted programs and in \n21  all of the operations of public entities that receive federal financial assistance.  Title II provides \nthat “[t]he remedies, procedures, and rights” applicable to Section 504 shall be available to any \n22  person alleging discrimination in violation of title II.  42 U.S.C. § 12133; see also 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12201(a) (ADA must not be construed more narrowly than Rehabilitation Act).  The ADA \n23  directs the Attorney General to promulgate regulations to implement title II, and requires those \nregulations  to  be  consistent  with  preexisting  federal  regulations  that  coordinated  federal \n24  agencies’ application of Section 504 to recipients of federal financial assistance, and interpreted \ncertain aspects of Section 504 as applied to the federal government itself.  42 U.S.C. § 12134(a)-\n25  (b).    Title  II  thus  extended  Section  504’s  pre-existing  prohibition  against  disability-based \ndiscrimination in programs and activities (including state and local programs and activities) \n26  receiving  federal  financial  assistance  or  conducted  by  the  federal  government  itself  to  all \noperations of state and local governments, whether or not they receive federal assistance.  The \n27  ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are generally construed to impose the same requirements.  See \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  5 \n \n \n\n \n45 Fed. Reg. 72995 (1980), reprinted in 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1.  The title II regulations require \n1 \npublic entities to “administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting \n2 \n3  appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  The \n4  preamble discussion of the “integration regulation” explains that “the most integrated setting” is \n5 \none that “enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest \n6 \nextent possible...” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), App. A.  This mandate advances one of the principal \n7 \npurposes of title II of the ADA – ending the isolation and segregation of people with disabilities.  \n8 \nSee Arc of Wash. State Inc. v. Braddock, 427 F.3d 615, 618 (9th Cir. 2005). \n9 \n  Eleven years ago, the Supreme Court applied these authorities and held that title II \n10 \n11  prohibits the unjustified segregation of individuals with disabilities.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 596.  \n12  Olmstead held that public entities are required to provide community-based services for persons \n13 \nwith disabilities who would otherwise be entitled to institutional services when a) treatment \n14 \nprofessionals reasonably determine that such placement is appropriate; b) the affected persons do \n15 \nnot oppose such treatment; and c) the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into \n16 \naccount the resources available to the entity and the needs of others who are receiving disability \n17 \nservices from the entity.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607.  \n18 \n19    The Court explained that this holding “reflects two evident judgments.”  Id. at 600.  \n20 \n“First, institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit from community settings \n21 \n22                                                                                                                                                               \nSanchez  v.  Johnson,  416  F.3d  1051,  1062  (9th  Cir.  2005);  Zukle  v.  Regents  of  Univ.  of \n23  California, 166 F.3d 1041, 1045 n. 11 (9th Cir. 1999). This principle follows from the similar \nlanguage  employed  in  the  two  acts.  It  also  derives  from  the  Congressional  directive  that \n24  implementation and interpretation of the two acts “be coordinated to prevent[ ] imposition of \ninconsistent or conflicting standards for the same requirements under the two statutes.”  Baird ex \n25  rel. Baird v. Rose, 192 F.3d 462, 468-9 (4th Cir. 1999) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12117(b)) (alteration \nin original).  See also Yeskey v. Com. of Penn. Dep’t of Corrections, 118 F.3d 168, 170 (3d Cir. \n26  1997) (“[A]ll the leading cases take up the statutes together, as we will.”), aff’d, 524 U.S. 206 \n(1998). \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  6 \n \n \n\n \nperpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of \n1 \nparticipating in community life.”  Id.  “Second, confinement in an institution severely diminishes \n2 \n3  the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work \n4  options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.”  Id. at 601.  \n5 \nOlmstead therefore makes clear that the aim of the integration mandate is to eliminate \n6 \nunnecessary institutionalization.  A state’s obligation to provide services in the most integrated \n7 \nsetting may be excused only where a state can prove that the relief sought would result in a \n8 \n“fundamental alteration” of the state’s service system.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603-4.   \n9 \n10 \nB.  Plaintiffs Satisfy the Requirements for a Preliminary Injunction. \n \n11 \n12  To obtain a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs must show (1) likelihood of success on the \n13  merits of their ADA Title II claim; (2) likelihood that the disruption in services will cause \n14 \nirreparable harm; (3) balance of hardships weighs in favor of plaintiffs; and (4) granting an \n15 \ninjunction is in the public interest.2  Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. \n16 \n----,----,129 S. Ct. 365, 374-76 (2008).  The decision of whether to grant or deny a motion for \n17 \npreliminary injunction is a matter of the district court's discretion.  Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc. v. \n18 \nCity of Los Angeles, 559 F.3d 1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 2009).  District courts are empowered to grant \n19 \n20  preliminary injunctions “regardless of whether the class has been certified.”  Cota v. Maxwell-\n21 \n22                                                   \n2 Three preliminary injunctions have recently been granted in Olmstead cases in California \n23  district courts.  In Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, 656 F. Supp. 2d 1161,1164 (N.D. Cal. 2009), the \ndistrict court granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, filed on August 18, 2009, \n24  which sought to enjoin defendants from reducing a particular community-based service from a \nmaximum of five days to three days per week.  A second preliminary injunction was granted in \n25  the same case in relation to new eligibility criteria that put plaintiffs at risk of institutionalization, \nCota v. Maxwell-Jolly, 688 F. Supp.2d 980, 985 (N.D. Cal. 2010).   And in V.L. v. Wagner, 669 \n26  F. Supp. 2d 1106, 1109 (N.D. Cal. 2009), California was enjoined from reducing or terminating \nin-home health services thereby putting plaintiffs at risk of institutionalization. \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  7 \n \n \n\n \nJolly, 688 F. Supp. 2d 980, 991 (N.D.Cal. 2010) (citations omitted).   \n1 \n1.  Plaintiffs Are Likely To Prevail On Their Title II Claims. \n2 \n3  Plaintiffs can establish the three key elements of an Olmstead claim.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. \n4  at 607.  The first two elements – that plaintiffs are appropriate for and do not oppose community \n5 \nplacement – do not appear to be in dispute.  Regarding the third element, plaintiffs’ request that \n6 \nthe County not reduce services below the level plaintiffs need in order to avoid \n7 \ninstitutionalization and that it transition the system in a way that does not place plaintiffs at risk \n8 \nof institutionalization is reasonable given the County’s resources and its ability to serve others \n9 \nwith disabilities.   \n10 \n11  a.  Maintaining the Level and Quality of Services is Essential \nBecause the Proposed Plan Puts Plaintiffs at Risk of \n12  Institutionalization in Violation of the ADA. \n \n13 \n  The level of services under the new outpatient mental health system will be insufficient to \n14 \nmaintain the plaintiffs in community living.  First, plaintiffs are particularly vulnerable to \n15 \nreduction in services.  Plaintiffs have severe mental health disabilities and many have \n16 \nexperienced multiple psychiatric hospitalizations in the past.  (Franczak Supp. Decl. ¶15.)  \n17 \nBudget cuts implemented last year have already terminated outpatient mental health services for \n18 \n19  persons with less acute mental health disabilities, thus those who remain in the outpatient system \n20 \nhave significant needs.   (Id.)   For example, Mr. Yanello, an individual with bipolar disorder, \n21 \nwas repeatedly institutionalized prior to receiving services through a RST: “I was \n22 \ninstitutionalized on many occasions.  I was suicidal.  Specifically, I was hospitalized at the \n23 \nSacramento Mental Health Treatment Center on at least eight occasions.  I also was hospitalized \n24 \nat Sierra Vista at least three times and at the Sutter Psychiatric Hospital at least twice.”  (Yanello \n25 \n26  Decl. ¶4)  After receiving RST services, Mr. Yanello has stabilized and is “doing much better;” \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  8 \n \n \n\n \nsuccessfully living in the community, doing yard work, cooking, and working.  (Id. at ¶5-8.)  \n1 \nSimilarly, Ms. Napper, diagnosed with both bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder, \n2 \n3  “bounced back and forth between different mental hospitals and mental facilities” and was \n4  hospitalized and placed in crisis residential facilities numerous times prior to receiving \n5 \ncommunity-based mental health services from the county.  (Napper Decl. ¶¶ 2,6.)  Since \n6 \nreceiving services in the community, Ms. Napper’s life has changed dramatically; she has \n7 \nstabilized and has not been hospitalized or placed in a crisis program for several years.  (Id. ¶ 7.) \n8 \n  Ms. Napper and Mr. Yanello’s experiences are similar to the experiences of the other \n9 \nclass representatives.  For instance, Ms. Fischer, diagnosed with bipolar disorder and major \n10 \n11  depression, describes a similar history of cycling “in and out of [institutional] facilities” \n12  (hospitalized 10+ times at the Sacramento Mental Health Treatment Center and in two other \n13 \nlocked facilities) (Fischer Decl. ¶ 4.)  While receiving services in the community, Ms. Fischer’s \n14 \nhospitalizations have decreased and she is able to remain in the community, building \n15 \nrelationships with her sister and her family.  (Id. ¶¶4, 6, 9.)   \n16 \n  Ms. Eichhorn-Smith has spent the bulk of her adult life – more than 24 years – in and out \n17 \nof psychiatric hospitals due to self-injurious behavior.  (Eichhorn-Smith Decl. ¶¶2, 3, 5.)  These \n18 \n19  hospitalizations have decreased due to the treatment she now receives, and she looks forward to \n20 \ngoing back to school and finding a job now that she has stabilized.  (Id. ¶¶1, 6, 11.)  Without \n21 \nfrequent and close contact with her outpatient mental health staff, Ms. Eichhorn-Smith will \n22 \nalmost certainly be re-hospitalized due to the self-harm behavior associated with her mental \n23 \nillness.  (Cline Supp. Decl. ¶1 “If these services are disrupted Ms. Eichhorn-Smith will \n24 \ndecompensate and be at risk of harming herself or being placed in an institution.”)   \n25 \n26     Reductions in services through the new County clinics is inevitable because the funding \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  9 \n \n \n\n \nfor the new clinics will be between 16% and 30% lower than funding for the RSTs.  While the \n1 \ndefendants maintain that the funding levels for outpatient mental health services – $18.6 million \n2 \n3  dollars – will remain the same for fiscal year 2009-10 as fiscal year 2010-11, this is not so.  \n4  (Opp. 2-3.)  Included in the County’s $18.6 million budget for fiscal year 2010-11 is $2.9 million \n5 \ndollars for the system transition that will not be spent to continue client services and thus \n6 \nrepresents an approximately 16% reduction in funding from the previous fiscal year.  (Opp. 3.)  \n7 \nFurther, an additional $3.5 million dollars of funding is purely speculative and questionable as it \n8 \ndepends upon State approval.  (Bennett Dep. 69:16-70:25, Ex. B.)3    If the $3.5 million falls \n9 \nthrough, then the total budget reduction over last year will be approximately 30%.   Finally, each \n10 \n11  County dollar buys more outpatient services through the RST contractors than under the County-\n12  operated system due to contractor efficiencies. (Declaration of Margaret Branick-Abilla, DKT \n13 \n19, Ex. I, “Mental Health Services Act Steering Committee, 8/20/09 Meeting Minutes,” at 3; \n14 \nStoneking Second Supp. Decl. ¶7.)      \n15 \n   The staffing levels and other reductions in services under the system redesign are \n16 \ninsufficient and will exacerbate plaintiffs’ risk of institutionalization.  For instance, TCORE \n17 \ncaseloads will increase 300% (from 1:25 to 1:75) which will have a devastating effect on \n18 \n19  TCORE clients.  (Franczak Supp. Decl., DKT 99-6, ¶12.)  TCORE’s current low staffing ratios \n20 \nallow staff to respond quickly to clients’ crisis situations to avoid hospitalization and \n21 \ninstitutionalization.  (Id. ¶7.)  Jacquie Eichhorn-Smith, a TCORE client for over two years, has \n22 \nreceived intensive services from a Consumer Family Advocate that have minimized \n23 \n24                                                   \n3 The Mental Health Services Act money that defendants rely on as a central funding stream for \n25  the system redesign has not been approved by the State and defendants do not know when – or if \n– they will get this approval.  In fact, the State Department of Mental Health has already \n26  expressed concerns about the plan in a letter dated May 5, 2010. (Letter attached as Ex. J of Pls.’ \nMem. In Supp. of Preliminary Injunction, DKT 17.) \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  10 \n \n \n\n \nhospitalizations.  (Supplemental Declaration of Frank S. Cline, DKT 99-4, ¶¶1,5,6.)  If caseloads \n1 \ntriple, it will be impossible to maintain this level of responsiveness and the level of care will \n2 \n3  decline, putting plaintiffs at risk of institutionalization.4   \n4    With the high client-staff ratio, plaintiffs with more intensive needs will be unable to \n5 \nreceive the same level of care that they require to live successfully in the community because \n6 \neach staff member will have less time available for each client.  Defendants’ proposed plan \n7 \ncurrently provides for 30 minutes per service per week per client which is insufficient for the \n8 \nvast majority of individuals being served by the program.  (Id. ¶¶ 17,19.)  The effects of \n9 \nincreased staffing levels are demonstrated by the plaintiffs’ own previous experiences.   Ms. \n10 \n11  Napper previously received reduced outpatient services, but they proved to be insufficient to \n12  keep her out of psychiatric facilities:   \n13 \nBefore I started at Northgate, the treatment I was offered at other mental health places at \nthe county was mainly medication.  This approach did not work for me and I had trouble \n14 \nstaying on my medication.  Northgate [RST] does not treat me as someone who just \n15  needs medication.  They go far beyond that…Without question, since I became a client at \nNorthgate, my condition has improved a lot and I do not end up in mental facilities the \n16 \nway I did before.   \n \n17 \n(Napper Decl. ¶8.)   \n18 \n  Ms. Lynda Mangio, who has Chronic Severe Depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder \n19 \nand panic attacks, describes her experiences with County mental health services when low \n20 \nstaffing levels resulted in her failure to receive adequate services: “In an attempt to escape my \n21 \n22  isolation, I went to the Wellness and Recovery Center (Center) in Sacramento County to attend \n23  groups four times a week.  When I went to the Center, almost all the groups were canceled.  It is \n24                                                   \n4 Staffing ratios set forth by defendants pose an additional challenge because they account for \n25  clinical staff carrying cases (rather than providing for clinical staff whose time is fully devoted to \ntheir clinical specialty).  As a result, there are substantial decreases in service from the current \n26  system, where the staffing ratios include only personal service coordinators and all other \nclinicians’ services are above and beyond that ratio.  (Franczak Supp. Dec. ¶ 13.)   \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  11 \n \n \n\n \nmy understanding that many groups were canceled because the Center did not have enough staff \n1 \nthat day or staff did not show up for groups.”  (Mangio Decl. ¶¶2,12.)  Before receiving services \n2 \n3  at an RST, Ms. Mangio had “daily suicidal thoughts” and she is concerned that with this \n4  transition, she will again have suicidal thoughts and face hospitalization.  (Id. at ¶¶11, 17.)   \n5 \n  Patricia Boynton, who has attempted suicide on three occasions, previously received \n6 \ninsufficient services from the County and was told by her psychiatrist that “they did not have the \n7 \nresources to help me when I went into crisis.”  (Boynton Decl. ¶¶5,8.)  Not surprisingly, Ms. \n8 \nBoynton was hospitalized at the Mental Health Treatment Center “at least 15 times” during the \n9 \nperiod she received insufficient outpatient services. (Id.)  In contrast, Ms. Boynton states that she \n10 \n11  receives crisis support services at her RST and “a number of times their support prevented a trip \n12  to the Treatment Center.”  (Id. at ¶11.)   \n13 \n   In addition to increased staffing ratios, additional service cuts in the new outpatient \n14 \nmental health system place plaintiffs at higher risk of institutionalization.  For example, TCORE \n15 \nservices under the new system will be reduced from 24 hours per day, 7 days per week to a 9 to 5 \n16 \nbusiness day. (Bennett Dep. at 130:9-15, Ex. B.)    Further, the TCORE services under the new \n17 \nsystem will be clinic-based, whereas under the system set to phase out starting August 1, 2010, \n18 \n19  TCORE services are community-based with staff often serving clients in their residences.  (Id.)  \n20 \nThe new system will also significantly reduce the peer services available to a mere 1 peer to 300 \n21 \nclients.  (Stoneking Second Supp. Decl. ¶10.)5   \n22 \n   Plaintiffs’ expert witnesses also state that under the County’s Hybrid Plan, the service \n23 \n24                                                   \n5 In addition to these concerns, plaintiffs raise concerns about the lack of adequate training of \n25  staff in the system redesign.  Training on recovery model for County staff will not start until \nNovember, more than three months after defendants have begun transitioning clients.  \n26  (Declaration of Paul Cecchettini, DKT 99-3, ¶7, citing comments from Kelli Weaver at meeting \nwith County representatives on July 13, 2010.) \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  12 \n \n \n\n \nlevels will be insufficient to prevent institutionalization.   Betty Dahlquist, an expert in the \n1 \ndelivery of public mental health services, states that due to insufficient levels of community \n2 \n3  services, Sacramento County already overly relies on institutional settings.   (Declaration of \n4  Betty Dahlquist, DKT 99-5, ¶11.)   Dahlquist bases her conclusions, in part, on her analysis of \n5 \ndata regarding the high rates of involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations in Sacramento County:  \n6 \n“In my opinion, this extremely high rate of involuntary hospitalizations is associated with the \n7 \nfact that the County lacks capacity in its community-based services so that it can only channel \n8 \nclients to the MHTC rather than use the alternatives that many other counties offer.”   (Id. at \n9 \n¶¶13-14.)  The California Mental Health Planning Council reached the same conclusion that \n10 \n11  Sacramento County’s lack of community based options forces it to rely on institutional settings.  \n12  (Id. ¶13.)  \n13 \n  Prior service cuts in Sacramento County’s outpatient mental health services have resulted \n14 \nin increased hospitalizations:   \n15 \n[t]he mental health service cuts last year have had a devastating effect.  Consumers \n16 \nwithout adequate supports in place ended up going to the emergency rooms of general \nhospitals…The hospitals do not understand their conditions and, as a result, may keep a \n17 \nclient in psychiatric crisis for days on end because there is nowhere else for them to go.     \n \n18 \n(Place Decl. ¶¶21, 22; See also Declaration of Josephine Balaoro, DKT 21, ¶¶1, 15 (“my \n19 \nresidents will be left without the mental health services that they need to be successful in living \n20 \nin homes.  Then, for no good reason and through no fault of their own, they will end up back in \n21 \n22  the locked facilities that they were in before”); Declaration of Jessica Johnson, DKT 36, ¶7; \n23  Declaration of Renee Klee, DKT 39, ¶13; Declaration of Ron Risley, M.D., DKT 45, ¶18; \n24 \nDeclaration of Janette Steele , DKT 48, ¶9.)   \n25 \n \n26 \n \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  13 \n \n \n\n \nb.  Providing Adequate Community Services Will Cost \n1 \nSacramento County Less Money.  \n \n2 \nMaintaining services adequate to avoid institutionalization will likely cost the County \n3 \nless money.  Sacramento County already spends a significant portion of its mental health budget \n4 \non costly institutional care – namely the Mental Health Treatment Center and acute psychiatric \n5 \nunit.  (Dahlquist Decl. ¶¶6,8.)  Increasing funding for institutional care at the expense of \n6 \n7  community services perpetuates Sacramento County’s unparalleled reliance on institutional care.  \n8 \n(Dahlquist Decl. ¶¶7,8.)   No other county is increasing funding for inpatient services.  In fact, \n9 \ncounties across the State are decreasing funding for these services.  Sacramento County currently \n10 \noperates the largest Psychiatric Health Facility in the entire state while other counties instead \n11 \nemploy smaller, more cost-effective crisis residential beds.  (Dahlquist Decl. ¶¶7,8.)  The cost for \n12 \nserving an individual at an RST is significantly less than the cost to treat the consumer at the \n13 \nMental Health Treatment Center.  The Treatment Center daily cost to treat each consumer is \n14 \n15  $1,095, whereas the RST daily cost to treat each consumer is $9.33. (Declaration of Roleda \n16 \nBates, DKT 22, ¶ 4; Place Decl. ¶ 32.)  With adequate community services that plaintiffs request, \n17 \nSacramento County can reduce its dependence on costly institutional care.   \n18 \nMoreover, that the County is experiencing a budget deficit does not exculpate it from \n19 \ncomplying with the Olmstead integration mandate.  Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care Auth., 335 \n20 \nF.3d 1175, 1183 (10th Cir. 2003) (“that [a state] has a fiscal problem, by itself, does not lead to \n21 \n22  an automatic conclusion” that providing the community services that plaintiffs seek would be a \n23  fundamental alteration.)  Further, “[i]f every alteration in a program or service that required the \n24 \noutlay of funds were tantamount to a fundamental alteration, the ADA’s integration mandate \n25 \nwould be hollow indeed.”  Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1183.  See also Pennsylvania Protection and \n26 \nAdvocacy, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Dept. Of Public Welfare, 402 F.3d 374, 380 (3d Cir. 2005).  \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  14 \n \n \n\n \nCongress was aware that integration “will sometimes involve substantial short-term burdens, \n1 \nboth financial and administrative,” but the long-term effects of integration “will benefit society \n2 \n3  as a whole.”  Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1183, citing, H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt.3, at 50, reprinted in \n4  1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445,773.      \n5 \nc.  The County’s Timeframe and Implementation Plan is \nInsufficient to Ensure Successful Transition in Violation of \n6 \nthe ADA.   \n7   \nThe request that the implementation of the County’s plan occur in a manner that \n8 \nminimizes disruptions in care that put plaintiffs at risk of entry into costly institutional settings is \n9 \nreasonable and does not effect a fundamental alteration.    \n10 \n11    Defendants plan to transfer an astonishing 90-110 clients per week from each RST, \n12  beginning August 1, 2010 even though as of the date of this filing, defendants do not yet have \n13 \noperational clinics.  (Weaver Decl. at 9; Declaration of Jack Rodney Kennedy, DKT 92, at 10.)  \n14 \nAt this rate, defendants anticipate completion of more than 4,000 transitions by September 30, \n15 \n2010; however, there will be an additional month (October) for any remaining transitions to take \n16 \nplace.  (Weaver Decl. at 9.)   \n17 \n  The window for transitions set forth in defendants’ plan is insufficient to properly \n18 \n19  transition all of the County’s current clients:  at a minimum, it would take six months “to \n20 \naccomplish a reasonably effective transition process.”  (Franczak Decl. ¶19; Stoneking Second \n21 \nSupp. Decl. ¶13; see also Declaration of Alexan Bolte, DKT 23, ¶18.)  The current timeframe, \n22 \nwhile potentially sufficient for medication appointments and the transfer of clinical records, “will \n23 \nnot be possible to ensure continuity of care for this population which … [ensuring successful \n24 \ntransitions] takes a considerable amount of time, thought, and care”.  (Franczak Supp. Decl. ¶21.)       \n25 \n26    Defendants’ current plan presumes that a form letter sent to consumers with a date and \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  15 \n \n \n\n \ntime for a group appointment will be sufficient to ensure transition to the new providers.  (Id. \n1 \n¶23.)6  This depersonalized protocol is inconsistent with clinical authority on how such \n2 \n3  transitions should be undertaken.  See Id. (describing transition process and its essential \n4  elements:  comprehensiveness, individual engagement, responsiveness to special populations, \n5 \nmaximizing resources/wrap-around services, relapse prevention, clear responsibilities, \n6 \ncontingency plans and tracking, and monitoring outcomes).  Dr. Stoneking reiterated these \n7 \nconcerns, noting that “a phone call from a new, unknown service provider in the context of an \n8 \ninvoluntary transfer is totally unsatisfactory and dooms the transition plan to failure.  County \n9 \npersonnel would have to be on hand at the RSTs for a significant transition plan in order to \n10 \n11  accomplish an acceptable hand-off, and there is no indication that the County has any such \n12  plans.”  (Stoneking Second Supp. Decl. ¶ 15.) \n13 \nThe current plan proposes to transfer all clients at least four times faster than the last \n14 \nmajor transition of Sacramento County outpatient mental health services in 1991-1993.  That \n15 \ntransition “took over 16 months – four months of planning and over a year for implementation \n16 \nfollowing approval by the Board of Supervisors, as opposed to 2-3 months that the County says \n17 \nwill be sufficient to implement its current redesign.”  (Stoneking Second Supp. Decl., ¶5.)  \n18 \n19  Further, current RST providers, who are the most familiar with plaintiffs’ needs and the intake \n20 \nprocess, do not believe the transition period is sufficient.  (Supplemental Declaration of John \n21 \nBuck, DKT 99-2, ¶6 (noting that 24 intakes per week at his RST is the maximum number of \n22 \nintakes that can be handled).)     \n23 \nFailure to appropriately plan for gaps in services violates Olmstead’s integration \n24 \n25                                                   \n6 Group appointments, as Dr. Franczak points out, do not provide for “confidentiality, address \n26  individual needs, or include current providers” – elements that are essential to continuity of care.  \n(Franczak Supp. Dec. ¶20.)   \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  16 \n \n \n\n \nmandate.   See Ball v. Rodgers, No. 00-cv-67, 2009 WL 1395423, at *5 (D. Ariz. April 24, 2009) \n1 \n(state defendants violated title II’s integration mandate because their “failure to provide adequate \n2 \n3  services to avoid unnecessary gaps in service and institutionalization was discriminatory.”)  The \n4  primary problem with the County’s transition plan stems from poor planning.   It is entirely \n5 \nreasonable to request that a county which is undertaking a dramatic redesign of the safety net \n6 \nsystem for the County’s most vulnerable population ensure that the transition satisfies their \n7 \nobligation under the integration mandate.  Brantley, 656 F. Supp. 2d at 1175 (holding that the \n8 \n“defendants certainly bear the burden of ensuring more than a “theoretical” availability of such \n9 \nservices” in order to satisfy the state defendants’ obligations under the Olmstead integration \n10 \n11  mandate when reducing Adult Day Health Care services.) Plaintiffs’ experts describe in detail \n12  the factors and contingencies that would minimize the risk of institutionalization with the \n13 \ntransition.  (Franczak Supp. Decl. ¶¶20-24; Stoneking Second Supp. Decl. ¶¶13,15.)  Pausing \n14 \nimplementation of any system redesign until difficult (and important) issues are resolved is \n15 \nconsistent with Olmstead and the requirement that public entities serve individuals in the most \n16 \nintegrated setting.   \n17 \n2.  Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm if Defendants Are Not Enjoined. \n18 \n \n19    The reduction of services and the ill-conceived transition plan put plaintiffs at substantial \n20 \nrisk of unnecessary institutionalization constituting irreparable harm.  Dr. Franczak aptly \n21 \nsummarizes the harm that plaintiffs will suffer if the system redesign moves forward as-is:  \n22 \n“clinical regression, increased hospitalization and institutionalization, injury, illness, and death.” \n23 \n7 (Franczak Supp. Decl. ¶ 27.)    \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26  7 The nature of serious mental illness as a “chronic, relapsing illness” dictates that without \nappropriate community services, “frequent re-hospitalizations” will result.  (Franczak Dec. ¶14.)  \n27  Other courts have recognized this phenomenon.  See, e.g. Rosie D. ex rel. John D. v. Swift, 310 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  17 \n \n \n\n \n  Dr. Franczak, who has worked for almost 40 years with individuals with similar needs to \n1 \nputative class members, states that the proposed service cuts will likely result in unnecessary \n2 \n3  institutionalization in hospital emergency rooms and psychiatric facilities.  (Franczak Decl. ¶10; \n4  Franczak Supp. Decl. ¶¶2, 26-27.)8  Dr. Stoneking similarly states that when clients are deprived \n5 \nof medically necessary services, even temporarily, they will be “placed at risk of \n6 \ninstitutionalization or acute, more expensive services in crisis facilities, hospital emergency \n7 \nrooms, institutes for mental disease (“IMDs”), jails, and even prisons.”  (Stoneking Decl. ¶¶5, \n8 \n39.)  These hospitalizations “can worsen the downward spiral … by further destabilizing them, \n9 \nmaking it extremely difficult for them to move back into the community.”  (Id.)   \n10 \n11  The likelihood that with the planned reduction in services, plaintiffs will experience an \n12  increased risk of institutionalization and associated irreparable harm through loss of community \n13 \ninvolvement and related problems has been recognized by other courts faced with similar factual \n14 \ncircumstances and evidence.  For example, in V.L. v. Wagner, the State of California planned to \n15 \nreduce the number of individuals eligible for In Home Supportive Services (IHSS) for people \n16 \nwith disabilities, including those with mental illness.  Wagner, 669 F. Supp. at 1112.  Based upon \n17 \nsimilar testimony by “experts, county officials, caregivers and individual recipients,” the court \n18 \n19  enjoined the defendants from implementing the service reductions and found that “individuals \n20 \n21                                                                                                                                                               \nF.3d 230, 232-33 (1st Cir. 2002) (“These debilitating conditions [of children with psychiatric or \n22  behavioral disorders] have led to a wide array of unhappy results, including expulsions from \nschools, cyclical transfers between treating facilities, repeated hospitalizations, and years spent \n23  away from family members at crisis stabilization units.”) \n24  8Dr. Franczak states that the “significant upheaval” of this transition “will result in harm for \nmany individuals increasing likelihood of adverse outcomes including increased hospitalization, \n25  use of emergency rooms, jail, prisons, [and] homeless shelters…” (Id. ¶11.)   Dr. Franczak \nexplained further that without effective transitioning, individuals will experience significant \n26  deterioration in their mental status, an increase in symptoms, and a reduction in their ability to \nrelate to others and will likely end up in institutions. (Franczak Decl. ¶17.) \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  18 \n \n \n\n \nwith mental disabilities who lose IHSS assistance to remind them to take medication, attend \n1 \nmedical appointments and perform tasks essential to their continued health are at a severely \n2 \n3  increased risk for institutionalization.”  Id. at 1119-20. The court further found that “there is also \n4  a serious risk that individuals with mental or cognitive disabilities will become homeless if they \n5 \nlose IHSS services. Once homeless, mentally ill individuals decline rapidly and could end up \n6 \nanywhere from a psychiatric hospital to jail.”  Id. at 1122. \n7 \n  The harm associated with the reduction of services, including hospitalization, \n8 \ninstitutionalization, loss of housing, loss of employment, isolation, deteriorating mental health, \n9 \nand even death is undeniably severe.  Mr. Yannello recounted his hospitalizations at various \n10 \n11  facilities and flatly states:  “I truly hated it when I was hospitalized.”  (Yannello Decl. ¶4.)  If \n12  plaintiffs are institutionalized, they will face separation from friends and family, loss of \n13 \naffordable community housing, and loss of jobs in the community.  (Yanello Decl. ¶¶6, 8; \n14 \nFischer Decl. ¶6; Boynton Decl. ¶1.)  If the defendants are not enjoined, the injury to plaintiffs \n15 \nwith history of suicide attempts or suicidal thoughts, including Channel Kirby, Lynda Mangio, \n16 \nPatricia Boynton, Rania Haidary, Yian Meng Saeteurn, Alan Cummings, Jan Fischer, Ted \n17 \nYanello, Jacquie Eichhorn-Smith, can never be rectified.  (Kirby Decl. ¶3; Napper Decl. ¶2; \n18 \n19  Mangio Decl. ¶11, , Boynton Decl. ¶8; Haidary Decl. ¶7; Saeteurn Decl. ¶9; Cummings Decl. ¶7; \n20 \nFischer Decl. ¶10; Yanello Decl. ¶4, Eichhorn-Smith Decl. ¶5.) \n21 \n  Courts have routinely recognized that the harm associated with institutionalization – even \n22 \non a short term basis – is severe.  In Long v. Benson, No. 08cv26, 2008 WL 4571903, at *2 (N.D. \n23 \nFla. Oct. 14, 2008), a Florida court granted a preliminary injunction in an Olmstead case and \n24 \nexplained that forcing the individual to leave his community placement and enter a nursing home \n25 \n26  “will inflict an enormous psychological blow.”  The court further explained that “because of the \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  19 \n \n \n\n \nvery substantial difference in [plaintiff’s] perceived quality of life in the apartment as compared \n1 \nto the nursing home, each day he is required to live in the nursing home will be an irreparable \n2 \n3  harm.”  Similarly, in Marlo M., 679 F. Supp. 2d at 638, a North Carolina court granted a \n4  preliminary injunction in an Olmstead case because the plaintiffs had “lived successfully in their \n5 \ncommunity based apartments,” and, if they lost community services they would “suffer \n6 \nregressive consequences if moved [to a nursing home], even temporarily.”  (emphasis added).  \n7 \nAnd in Crabtree v. Goetz, No. 08-0939, 2008 WL 5330506 *25 (M.D. Tenn. Dec. 19, 2008) \n8 \n(unpublished), the court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining state defendants from cutting \n9 \nhome health care services that would force plaintiffs with disabilities into institutional \n10 \n11  placements; the court explained that institutionalization “would be detrimental to [plaintiffs’] \n12  care, causing, inter alia, mental depression, and for some Plaintiffs, a shorter life expectancy or \n13 \ndeath.”9     \n14 \nThe Court in Olmstead, too, recognized these very concerns, describing the adverse \n15 \neffects that occur with unnecessary institutional placements: \n16 \nFirst, institutional placement … perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so \n17 \nisolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life ... Second, \nconfinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of \n18 \nindividuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic \n19  independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.... In order to receive \nneeded medical services, persons … must, because of those disabilities, relinquish \n20 \nparticipation in community life they could enjoy given reasonable accommodations, \nwhile persons without mental disabilities can receive the medical services they need \n21 \nwithout similar sacrifice. \n22 \nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 600-01.   \n23 \n \n24   \n25                                                   \n9 See also Haddad v. Arnold, No. 3:10-00414 (M.D. Fla. July 9, 2010) (Opinion granting \n26  preliminary injunction in Olmstead case after finding that the plaintiff will suffer irreparable \ninjury if forced to enter a nursing home.) (Attached as Ex. C.) \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  20 \n \n \n\n \n3.  The Balance of Hardships Tips in Plaintiffs’ Favor. \n1 \n \n  The hardships that the plaintiffs will endure absent an injunction – including the risk of \n2 \n3  institutionalization, homelessness, jail and even death – far outweigh any potential hardship to \n4  the County.  The defendants have not specifically identified the cost, if any, associated with \n5 \nmaintaining the same level of services for the plaintiffs, most likely because the County denies \n6 \nthat a service reduction will actually occur under its Hybrid Plan.  (Opp. 10)  Further, the \n7 \ndefendants have not identified the costs, if any, associated with preparing and implementing a \n8 \ntransition that will reduce the risk of institutionalization.   The defendants claim that it will cost \n9 \nthe County $4.5 million to “reinstate the mental health system” as it existed in FY 2009 – 2010, \n10 \n11  although defendants did not explain how they calculated this number.  (Declaration of Thomas \n12  Burkart, DKT 86, at 2.)  Because the plaintiffs are not seeking to reinstate the mental health \n13 \nsystem as it existed in fiscal year 2009- 2010, this figure is not a reliable measure of cost \n14 \nassociated with the plaintiffs’ actual modification request.  (Pls.’ Reply at 10.)  Further, because \n15 \nthe cost of providing institutional care is so high ($1,095 per day at the Mental Health Treatment \n16 \nCenter versus $9.33 per day at the RSTs) (Bates Dec. ¶4) any financial hardships that defendants \n17 \nmay incur will likely be offset by the cost savings that accrue from avoiding unnecessary \n18 \n19  institutionalizations.   \n20 \n  Other courts when faced with similar reductions in social services have determined that \n21 \nthe harm to the plaintiffs outweigh the defendant’s budget considerations.  For example, the risk \n22 \nof institutionalization and inability to access necessary medical care as a result of reductions to \n23 \nIn Home Supportive Services outweighed the financial burden of the state during a fiscal crisis.   \n24 \nWagner, 669 F. Supp. 2d at 1122.  See also Brantley, 656 F. Supp. 2d at 1177 (state’s fiscal \n25 \n26  crisis does not outweigh harm to indigent seniors and disabled adults who faced a reduction in \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  21 \n \n \n\n \nthe state’s Adult Day Health Care program.)   \n1 \n4.  Granting a Preliminary Injunction Is In The Public Interest. \n2 \n \n3    The public interest weighs heavily in favor of granting relief.  “It would be tragic, not \n4  only from the standpoint of the individuals involved but also from the standpoint of society, were \n5 \npoor, elderly, disabled people to be wrongfully deprived of essential benefits for any period of \n6 \ntime.”   Lopez v. Heckler, 713 F.2d 1432, 1437 (9th Cir. 1983). \n7 \n  There is a strong public interest in granting a preliminary injunction to allow plaintiffs to \n8 \nremain in community settings.  There is a public interest in eliminating the discriminatory effects \n9 \nthat arise from segregating persons with disabilities into institutions when they can be \n10 \n11  appropriately placed in community settings.  As Olmstead explained, the unjustified segregation \n12  of persons with disabilities can stigmatize them as incapable or unworthy of participating in \n13 \ncommunity life.10  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 600.  In Long, the court relied on this reasoning to hold \n14 \nthat the public interest favored allowing the plaintiff to “remain in the community rather than be \n15 \nisolated in the nursing home”: \n16 \nIf, as it ultimately turns out, treating individuals like Mr. Griffin in the community would \n17 \nrequire a fundamental alteration of the Medicaid program, so that the Secretary prevails \nin this litigation, little harm will have been done. To the contrary, [plaintiff’s] life will \n18 \nhave been better, at least for a time… \n19   \nLong, 2008 WL 4571903, at *3.     \n20 \nC.  Plaintiffs Raise a Justiciable Issue. \n21 \n22  Plaintiffs raise a justiciable issue because they will experience a reduction in outpatient \n23  mental health services as a result of the defendants’ actions.  It is well settled that to establish \n24 \n                                                 \n25  10 See also U.S. Amicus Brief in Olmstead at 16-17, citing to 136 Cong. Rec. H2603 (daily ed. \nMay 22, 1990) (statement of Rep. Collins) (“To be segregated is to be misunderstood, even \n26  feared,” and “only by breaking down barriers between people can we dispel the negative \nattitudes and myths that are the main currency of oppression.”).  \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  22 \n \n \n\n \nstanding, the litigants must show (1) plaintiffs suffered actual or threatened injury; (2) the \n1 \ncondition complained of caused the injury or threatened injury, and (3) the requested relief \n2 \n3  redressed the alleged injury.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).   \n4  When examining whether plaintiffs suffered actual or threatened injury, the inquiry focuses on \n5 \nwhether the injury-in-fact is (1) “concrete and particularized,” and (2) actual or imminent, not \n6 \n‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  The injury here – loss of Medicaid \n7 \noutpatient mental health services – is concrete, particularized and imminent.   Cal. Pro-Life \n8 \nCouncil, Inc. v. Getman, 328 F.3d 1088, 1095 (9th Cir. 2003); United States v. Antelope, 395 \n9 \nF.3d 1128, 1132 (9th Cir. 2005); Mental Disability Law Clinic v. Hogan, No. 06-cv-6320, 2008 \n10 \n11  WL 4104460, at *23-25 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2008) (“Due to Mary Jo’s illness and the allegation \n12  that she continues to refuse to take her medication, the likely harm of another hospitalization and \n13 \nthe fact that this harm could be avoided if she were subject to [assisted outpatient treatment] is \n14 \nnot too speculative or conjectural to preclude standing.”); Lynch v. Baxley, 744 F.2d 1452, 1456 \n15 \n(11th Cir. 1984).   \n16 \nService cuts are inevitable under the funding levels and staffing ratios included in the \n17 \nnew plan.  The County cannot possibly provide the same level of services while implementing a \n18 \n19  funding cut of 16% to 30%, especially considering that it costs more to provide services directly \n20 \nthrough the County rather than through contractors.   The defendants repeatedly state the new \n21 \nplan offers the same “menu” or “array” of services.  (Opp. 8; Weaver Decl. at 3, 5; Zykofsky \n22 \nDecl. at 5; Kennedy Decl. at 5; Bennett Dep. 58:22-24, Ex. B.)  However, as discussed in Section \n23 \nII(A)(1)(a) above, even if the “menu” – i.e. the types of services offered – is comparable (which \n24 \nit is not), the intensity by which the services are offered will be significantly diluted, causing a \n25 \n26  concrete and actual loss of services.  The loss of services itself is sufficient to create standing, \n27 \n28  Statement of Interest of the United States \n  23 \n \n \n\n \nand the risk of institutionalization that directly results from this loss in services provides a \n1 \nsecondary injury grounding plaintiffs’ standing.  These harms are “concrete” and “immediate” \n2 \n3  and satisfy the Supreme Court’s standards for awarding a remedy in this case.   \n4 \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n5 \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should grant Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \n6 \nInjunction.

Plaintiffs in this action are Leslie Napper, Janet Fischer, Jacquie Eichhorn-\nSmith, Ted Yannello and Lynda Mangio (\"Plaintiffs\").  Defendants in this action are \nCounty of Sacramento (\"County\"), Sacramento County Board of Supervisors (\"Board\"), \ncurrent Board members Phil Serna, Jimmie Yee, Susan Peters, Roberta MacGlashan, and \nDon Nottoli, Sacramento County Department of Health and Human Services (\"DHHS\"), \nDHHS' current Director Ann Edwards, and the County's current Mental Health Director \nMary Ann Bennett (\"Defendants\").  Defendants Vee, Serna, Peters, MacGlashan, Nottoli, \nEdwards and Bennett have all been sued only in their respective official capacities.  This \nConsent Decree applies to Defendants and their successors in office. \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims against all Defendants \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331,1343 and 1367.  Venue is proper in the Eastern District of \nCalifornia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (b).  Any claims in this lawsuit on behalf of a \nputative class of all current and future adult recipients of Medi-Cal funded mental health \nservices in the County of Sacramento are hereby dismissed without prejudice. \n3.  For the duration of this Consent Decree, Defendants shall not implement \nor enforce the \"Hybrid Plan,\" either in its entirety or major components thereof, under \nwhatever designation or nomenclature.  The parameters of the Hybrid Plan were  , \npreviously approved by the Board on June 17,2010, a copy of which is attached hereto. \nThis Consent Decree does not affect or concern Defendants' provision of adult inpatient \nmental health services or crisis residential services to Medi-Cal recipients who are \nresidents of the County of Sacramento since the provision of such inpatient and/or crisis \nresidential services were not part of the Hybrid Plan and were not the subject of this \nlawsuit. \n4.  No later than December 31, 2012, Defendants shall: \na.  develop a plan for providing a continuum of care through the \nCounty-operated and funded adult outpatient mental health system; and \nb.  develop a plan to consolidate the two County outpatient clinics. \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 131   Filed 01/23/12   Page 5 of 7\n5.  No later than December 31, 2012, Defendants shall consider and decide \nwhether or not to: \na.  modify the intake system so that existing providers can conduct \nintake assessments for easy access to services; \nb.  increase the use of the Wellness and Recovery model and provide \ntraining on this model to existing contract and County providers; \nc.  increase, to the extent of available funding, the use of peer \nstaffing/volunteers at the existing contract and County providers; \nd.  increase collaboration between outpatient and inpatient mental \nhealth providers (e.g., create a system to give immediate notification to \noutpatient providers when their clients are hospitalized); and \ne.  develop a 24-hour welcoming line or \"warm line\" staffed by \npersons with lived experience. \n6.  In implementing the measures described in Paragraph 4 above and \npreceding the decisions on whether or not to implement the measures described in \nParagraph 5 above, Defendants shall: \na.  consider the report dated May 10,2011 of Dr. Nancy Callahan in \nconnection with the proposed redesign; \nb.  hold a minimum of four stakeholders/community input meetings to \naddress consumer/client concerns about existing adult outpatient mental \nhealth services and any proposed redesign. These meetings may be held in \nconjunction with the County's mental health board meetings; \nc.  conduct a minimum of one (1) outreach meeting at each existing \noutpatient provider (including HRC, TCORE, Northgate Point, Visions, EI \nHogar and the two Wellness and Recovery Centers) to seek \nconsumer/client input about existing adult outpatient mental health \nservices and any proposed redesign. These meetings shall be scheduled at \n2 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 131   Filed 01/23/12   Page 6 of 7\ndates and times convenient for Defendants and the affected outpatient \nproviders; and \nd.  provide an opportunity for public comment at the above meetings \nand subsequent events and provide, at subsequent meetings, written \nresponses to public questions about any proposed redesign of the County's \nadult outpatient mental health system. \n7.  For the duration of this Consent Decree, Defendants shall give advance \nwritten notice to counsel at Disability Rights California of any public meeting where \ndiscussion of Sacramento County Adult Outpatient Mental Health is on the agenda. \nPlaintiffs shall advise Defendants of which attorney at Disability Rights California should \nreceive these notices. \n8.  The parties recognize that Defendants' ability to implement any of the \nplans discussed in Paragraphs 4 and 5 above or other plans relating to the adult outpatient \nmental health system for Medi-Cal recipients may require the approval and funding \ncommitment of the State Department of Mental Health and other state agencies. \n9.  This Consent Decree shall remain in effect through January 31, 2013, at \nwhich time the Consent Decree will automatically expire and no longer be of any force or \neffect.  During that time period, the Court shall retain jurisdiction over this lawsuit to \nenforce the provisions of the Consent Decree.  Before filing any motion to enforce the \nterms of the Consent Decree, counsel for the moving party shall contact counsel for the \nopposing party to discuss thoroughly, preferably in person, the substance of the \ncontemplated motion and any potential resolution.  Any such motion shall not be filed \nuntil seven (7) days after the parties have conferred to discuss the motion.  Upon the \nexpiration of this Consent Decree, this matter will be dismissed with prejudice by the \nnamed Plaintiffs. \n10.  The Court shall also retain jurisdiction over the request by Plaintiffs' \ncounsel to be awarded their co'sts of suit as well as their motion to recover attorneys' fees \nand litigation-related expenses.  The parties shall make good faith efforts to resolve their \n3 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 131   Filed 01/23/12   Page 7 of 7\ndifferences as to these issues.  Plaintiffs' counsel shall, however, file their cost bill and \nmotion to recover their attorneys' fees and litigation related expenses no later than ninety \n(90) days after entry of the Consent Decree. \nDated. _______: , 2012 \nJohn A.

Defendants in this action are \nCounty of Sacramento (“County”), Sacramento County Board of Supervisors (“Board”), \ncurrent Board members Phil Serna, Jimmie Yee, Susan Peters, Roberta MacGlashan, and \nDon Nottoli, Sacramento County Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”), \nDHHS’ current Director Ann Edwards, and the County’s current Mental Health Director \nMary Ann Bennett (“Defendants”).  Defendants Yee, Serna, Peters, MacGlashan, Nottoli, \nEdwards and Bennett have all been sued only in their respective official capacities.  This \nConsent Decree applies to Defendants and their successors in office. \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims against all Defendants \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343 and 1367.  Venue is proper in the Eastern District of \nCalifornia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  Any claims in this lawsuit on behalf of a \nputative class of all current and future adult recipients of Medi-Cal funded mental health \nservices in the County of Sacramento are hereby dismissed without prejudice. \n3. For the duration of this Consent Decree, Defendants shall not implement \nor enforce the “Hybrid Plan,” either in its entirety or major components thereof, under \nwhatever designation or nomenclature.  The parameters of the Hybrid Plan were \npreviously approved by the Board on June 17, 2010, a copy of which is attached hereto.  \nThis Consent Decree does not affect or concern Defendants’ provision of adult inpatient \nmental health services or crisis residential services to Medi-Cal recipients who are  \nresidents of the County of Sacramento since the provision of such inpatient and/or crisis \nresidential services were not part of the Hybrid Plan and were not the subject of this \nlawsuit.   \n4. No later than December 31, 2012, Defendants shall: \na. develop a plan for providing a continuum of care through the \nCounty-operated and funded adult outpatient mental health system; and \nb. develop a plan to consolidate the two County outpatient clinics.  \n1 \n \nPDF created with pdfFactory trial version www.pdffactory.com\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM -EFB   Document 133-1    Filed 01/25/12   Page 2 of 4\n5. No later than December 31, 2012, Defendants shall consider and decide     \nwhether or not to: \na. modify the intake system so that existing providers can conduct \nintake assessments for easy access to services; \nb. increase the use of the Wellness and Recovery model and provide \ntraining on this model to existing contract and County providers; \nc. increase, to the extent of available funding, the use of peer \nstaffing/volunteers at the existing contract and County providers;  \nd. increase collaboration between outpatient and inpatient mental \nhealth providers (e.g., create a system to give immediate notification to \noutpatient providers when their clients are hospitalized); and \ne. develop a 24-hour welcoming line or “warm line” staffed by  \npersons with lived experience.   \n6.   In implementing the measures described in Paragraph 4 above and \npreceding the decisions on whether or not to implement the measures described in \nParagraph 5 above, Defendants shall:   \na. consider the report dated May 10, 2011 of Dr. Nancy Callahan in \nconnection with the proposed redesign; \nb. hold a minimum of four stakeholders/community input meetings to \naddress consumer/client concerns about existing adult outpatient mental \nhealth services and any proposed redesign. These meetings may be held in \nconjunction with the County’s mental health board meetings; \nc. conduct a minimum of one (1) outreach meeting at each existing \noutpatient provider (including HRC, TCORE, Northgate Point, Visions, El \nHogar and the two Wellness and Recovery Centers) to seek \nconsumer/client input about existing adult outpatient mental health \nservices and any proposed redesign. These meetings shall be scheduled at \n2 \n \nPDF created with pdfFactory trial version www.pdffactory.com\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM -EFB   Document 133-1    Filed 01/25/12   Page 3 of 4\ndates and times convenient for Defendants and the affected outpatient \nproviders; and \nd. provide an opportunity for public comment at the above meetings \nand subsequent events and provide, at subsequent meetings, written \nresponses to public questions about any proposed redesign of the County’s \nadult outpatient mental health system.  \n7. For the duration of this Consent Decree, Defendants shall give advance \nwritten notice to counsel at Disability Rights California of any public meeting where \ndiscussion of Sacramento County Adult Outpatient Mental Health is on the agenda.  \nPlaintiffs shall advise Defendants of which attorney at Disability Rights California should \nreceive these notices.   . \n8. The parties recognize that Defendants’ ability to implement any of the \nplans discussed in Paragraphs 4 and 5 above or other plans relating to the adult outpatient \nmental health system for Medi-Cal recipients may require the approval and funding \ncommitment of the State Department of Mental Health and other state agencies. \n9.  This Consent Decree shall remain in effect through January 31, 2013, at \nwhich time the Consent Decree will automatically expire and no longer be of any force or \neffect.  During that time period, the Court shall retain jurisdiction over this lawsuit to \nenforce the provisions of the Consent Decree.  Before filing any motion to enforce the \nterms of the Consent Decree, counsel for the moving party shall contact counsel for the \nopposing party to discuss thoroughly, preferably in person, the substance of the \ncontemplated motion and any potential resolution.

INTRODUCTION \n2  This lawsuit challenges the unlawful termination of essential mental health services to \n3  thousands of low-income Medi-Cal recipients in Sacramento County.  Defendant County of \n4  Sacramento (“County”) has stated that during the 2010-11 fiscal year, it intends to close mental \n5  health programs that provide “core” services to approximately 5,000 County residents with severe \n6  mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression.  Specifically, the County \n7  has stated that beginning on August 1, 2010, it intends to begin eliminating outpatient services \n8  that are currently being provided to these clients by four Regional Support Team (“RST”) \n9  programs and the Transitional Community Opportunities for Recovery and Engagement \n10  (“TCORE”) program, and to reduce funding significantly for the Consumer Self Help Wellness \n11  and Recovery Center (“CSH”), which is also serving the clients.  Together, these impacted \n12  programs provide most of the outpatient mental health services to Medi-Cal recipients in the \n13  County.  Although the County claims that it intends to transition these clients to new County-run \n14  clinics beginning on July 1, 2010, it has provided virtually no details concerning these clinics, \n15  their proposed staffing or the services they are expected to provide, and based on the County’s \n16  statements to date, it is a virtual certainty that these services will be greatly reduced and vastly \n17  inferior to the system that the County is dismantling. \n18  By this motion, Plaintiffs Leslie Napper, Jan Fischer, Jacquie Eichhorn-Smith, Ted \n19  Yannello and Lynda Mangio (“Plaintiffs”) respectfully request that the Court certify a class \n20  consisting of “all current and future recipients of Medi-Cal funded mental health services in the \n21  County of Sacramento.”  “Before certifying a class, the trial court must conduct a ‘rigorous \n22  analysis’ to determine whether the party seeking certification has met the prerequisites of \n23  Rule 23” of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Protectmarriage.com v. Bowen, 262 F.R.D. \n24  504, 506-07 (E.D. Cal. 2009), citing Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1233 (9th \n25  Cir. 1996). \n26  This action readily satisfies the requirements for class certification under Rule 23(a).  \n27  First, the proposed class consists of well over 5,000 current members, making joinder \n28  impracticable.  Second, members of the proposed class share common issues of fact and law as \n         1.    \n  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION - CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 54   Filed 06/09/10   Page 8 of 21\n1  they are currently threatened and will continue to be threatened with the unlawful denial of \n2  outpatient mental health services which they are entitled to receive under California’s Medicaid \n3  program, better known as Medi-Cal.  Third, the five Plaintiffs satisfy the typicality requirement \n4  because they are threatened with the same unlawful denial of Medicaid-funded mental health \n5  services as thousands of other Medi-Cal recipients in the County.  Fourth, Plaintiffs are adequate \n6  class representatives because they have no conflicts with the claims of putative class members.  \n7  Likewise, Plaintiffs’ attorneys have no conflicts with the claims of putative class members and \n8  have substantial experience in class actions, public benefits cases, and other complex civil rights \n9  cases in federal court, making them more than adequate class counsel. \n10  This case is appropriate for class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) because the class has \n11  been subject to a common set of practices for which they only seek injunctive and declaratory \n12  relief.  “Class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate only where the primary relief \n13  sought is declaratory or injunctive.”  Zinser v. Accufix Research Inst., Inc., 253 F.3d 1180, 1195 \n14  (9th Cir. 2001); see also Molski v. Gleich, 318 F.3d 937, 949-50 (9th Cir. 2003).  This Court \n15  should therefore certify the proposed class, approve the five Plaintiffs as class representatives, \n16  and appoint Plaintiffs’ counsel to serve as class counsel.  This Court should also order that notice \n17  need not be given to class members of the pendency of this class action at this time. \n18  II.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n19  To avoid unnecessary repetition, Plaintiffs refer the Court to the Statement of Facts in the \n20  Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \n21  Injunction, filed concurrently herewith. \n22 \nIII.  ERRING ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION, PLAINTIFFS ARE MOVING FOR CLASS \nCERTIFICATION AT SUCH AN EARLY STAGE IN THE PROCEEDINGS SO AS \n23 \nTO AVOID ANY DOUBTS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED \n24  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION IN THIS CASE \n25  Rule 23(c) specifies that at an “early practicable time” after commencement of an action \n26  the court shall determine whether the action is to be maintained as a class action.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n27  23(c)(1)(A); see also Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 901 (9th Cir. 1975).  It is especially \n28  important that the Court rule upon this class certification motion at an early stage in these \n         2.    \n  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION - CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 54   Filed 06/09/10   Page 9 of 21\n1  proceedings since Plaintiffs have filed a motion for preliminary injunction not just for themselves, \n2  but also for all members of the proposed class. \n3  The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo, returning the parties \n4  to their relative positions before the actions that gave rise to the litigation.  GoTo.Com, Inc. v. \n5  Walt Disney Co., 202 F.3d 1199, 1210 (9th Cir. 2000).  “There is no general requirement that an \n6  injunction affect only the parties in the suit.”  Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1169 (9th Cir. \n7  1987).   \n8  It is well-settled that an injunction benefitting non-parties is permissible provided it is \n9  necessary to give the relief to which the parties are individually entitled.  Easyriders Freedom \n10  F.I.G.H.T. v. Hannigan, 92 F.3d 1486, 1501-02 (9th Cir. 1996); Gregory v. Litton Sys., Inc., 472 \n11  F.2d 631, 633-34 (9th Cir. 1972).  Although both those cases dealt with permanent injunctions, \n12  the principle is the same for preliminary injunctions.  See Zepeda v. INS, 753 F.2d 719, 728 n.1 \n13  (9th Cir. 1983) (applying the same standard to a preliminary injunction).  \n14  In Easyriders, the Ninth Circuit held that an injunction forbidding the California Highway \n15  Patrol from engaging in unconstitutional stops of any motorcyclists, instead of merely forbidding \n16  stops of the named plaintiffs, was not overbroad.  92 F.3d at 1501.  The court reasoned: \n17  Because the CHP policy regarding helmets is formulated on a statewide \nlevel, other law enforcement agencies follow the CHP’s policy, and it is \n18  unlikely that law enforcement officials who were not restricted by an \ninjunction governing their treatment of all motorcyclists would inquire \n19  before citation into whether a motorcyclist was among the named \nplaintiffs or a member of Easyriders, the plaintiffs would not receive the \n20  complete relief to which they are entitled without statewide application of \nthe injunction. \n21 \n22  Id. at 1502; see also Bresgal, 843 F.2d at 1169-1171 (requiring the enforcement of the Migrant \n23  and Seasonal Workers Protection Act on a nationwide basis rather than just against the particular \n24  labor contractors who might deal with the individual plaintiffs).  \n25  On the other hand, the Ninth Circuit has expressed the view that a preliminary injunction \n26  may only cover the named plaintiffs if the lawsuit has not been certified as a class action.  Nat’l \n27  Ctr. for Immigrants Rights, Inc. v. INS, 743 F.2d 1365, 1371 (9th Cir. 1984), vacated, 481 U.S. \n28  1009 (1987); see also Zepeda, 753 F.2d at 728 n.1 (“Without a properly certified class, a court \n         3.    \n  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION - CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 54   Filed 06/09/10   Page 10 of 21\n1  cannot grant relief on a class-wide basis”); accord, Paige v. California, 102 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th \n2  Cir. 1996). \n3  According to Bresgal and Easyriders, the proposed preliminary injunction in this case \n4  should be permissible as a means of providing full relief to the five named Plaintiffs and all others \n5  similarly situated.  See also Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, 656 F. Supp. 2d 1161, 1178 n.14 (N.D. \n6  Cal. 2009) (“District courts are empowered to grant preliminary injunctions ‘regardless of \n7  whether the class has been certified.’”) (citation omitted).  Yet Plaintiffs, mindful of the \n8  statements in National Center for Immigration Rights and Zepeda, want to eliminate any possible \n9  objections from Defendants about the scope of the order (e.g., enjoining the closure of the RSTs \n10  and the TCORE program).  The simplest way to avoid such a potential controversy would be to \n11  certify the case as a class action. \n12 \nIV.  THIS LAWSUIT SATISFIES ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 23 FOR \nMAINTENANCE AS A CLASS ACTION \n13 \n14  In determining whether an action warrants class treatment under Rule 23, “the question is \n15  not whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits, \n16  but rather whether the requirements of Rule 23 are met.”  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. \n17  156, 178 (1974) (quotations and citation omitted); Moore v. Hughes Helicopters, Inc., 708 F.2d \n18  475, 480 (9th Cir. 1983) (same).   \n19  The Ninth Circuit recently set forth the basic rules for class certification motions in the \n20  long awaited decision in Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 603 F.3d 571 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc).  \n21  A district court “must perform a rigorous analysis” to ensure that the Rule 23 requirements have \n22  been met.  Id. at 581.  This “analysis will often, though not always, require looking behind the \n23  pleadings, even to issues overlapping with the merits of the underlying claims.”  Id.; see also \n24  Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982) (“the class determination generally \n25  involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues”).  However, “district \n26  courts may not analyze any portion of the merits of a claim that do not overlap with the Rule 23 \n27  requirements” and “different parts of Rule 23 require different inquiries.”  Dukes, 603 F.3d at \n28  594.  For example, plaintiffs only need “establish common questions of law and fact” for \n         4.    \n  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION - CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 54   Filed 06/09/10   Page 11 of 21\n1  purposes of the commonality inquiry under Rule 23(a)(2), whereas “answering those questions is \n2  the purpose of the merits inquiry, which can be addressed at trial and at summary judgment.”  Id. \n3  (emphasis in original).  \n4  As discussed below, the proposed class meets all the requirements of Rule 23(a):  \n5  numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); see \n6  also Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613 (1997) (listing Rule 23(a) requirements).  \n7  In addition, this class meets the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) in that declaratory and injunctive \n8  relief predominates and is appropriate.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); see also Amchem, 521 U.S. at \n9  614. \n10  A.  The Proposed Class Satisfies the Requirements of Rule 23(a). \n11  1.  The Proposed Class is Sufficiently Numerous. \n12  “To satisfy Rule 23's requirements, the proponent must first establish that a class does in \n13  fact exist.”  O’Connor v. Boeing N. Am., Inc., 184 F.R.D. 311, 319 (C.D. Cal. 1998).  “An \n14  adequate class definition specifies ‘a distinct group of plaintiffs whose members [can] be \n15  identified with particularity.’”  Campbell v. PricewaterhousCoopers, LLP, 253 F.R.D. 586, 593 \n16  (E.D. Cal. 2008), quoting Lerwill v. Inflight Motion Pictures, Inc., 582 F.2d 507, 512 (9th Cir. \n17  1978).  A class definition must be “precise, objective and presently ascertainable.”  O’Connor, \n18  184 F.R.D. at 319.   \n19  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of “all current and future recipients of Medi-\n20  Cal funded mental health services in the County of Sacramento.”  The class is sufficiently defined \n21  in this case. \n22  Rule 23(a)(1) requires a finding that the proposed class is so numerous that “joinder of all \n23  members is impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  “‘[I]mpractibility’ does not mean \n24  ‘impossibility,’ but only the difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members of the class.”  \n25  Harris v. Palm Springs Alpine Estates, Inc., 329 F.2d 909, 913-14 (9th Cir. 1964).  \n26  While there is no exact numerical formula, a class of over 100 members satisfies the \n27  numerosity requirement.  See 1 Newberg on Class Actions (4th ed. 2002) § 3.5 at 247 (“as few as \n28  40 class members should raise a presumption that joinder is impracticable”).  Courts in the Ninth \n         5.    \n  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION - CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 54   Filed 06/09/10   Page 12 of 21\n1  Circuit have found that classes of far fewer than 100 persons are sufficiently numerous to render \n2  joinder impracticable.  See, e.g., Jordan v. County of Los Angeles, 669 F.2d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir.), \n3  vacated on other grounds, 459 U.S. 810 (1982) (“[W]e would be inclined to find the numerosity \n4  requirement in the present case satisfied solely on the basis of the number of ascertained class \n5  members, i.e., 39, 64, and 71. . . .”); Perez-Funez v. Dist. Dir., INS, 611 F. Supp. 990, 995 (C.D. \n6  Cal. 1984) (“Classes consisting of 25 members have been held large enough to justify \n7  certification.”).  \n8  Plaintiffs easily satisfy the numerosity requirement in this case.  The County’s Mental \n9  Health Plan serves approximately 20,000 Medi-Cal recipients with severe and chronic mental \n10  illness; of these, approximately half are adults over the age of 18.  Branick-Abilla Declaration \n11  (“Decl.”), ¶ 3, Exhibit (“Ex.”) A at 48 (2009 APS Rpt.).1  One of the RSTs, Human Resources \n12  Consultants, alone serves 840 clients, 90 to 95% of whom are Medi-Cal recipients.  Place Decl., \n13  ¶ 12.  Another RST, Visions Unlimited, has over 800 clients.  Bates Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3, 15.  TCORE \n14  currently serves nearly 640 people.  Risley Decl., ¶ 6. \n15  In determining the impracticability of joinder under Rule 23(a)(1), the court may consider \n16  other factors besides the sheer size of the class.  Jordan, 669 F.2d at 1319; Paxton v. Union Nat’l \n17  Bank, 688 F.2d 552, 559-60 (8th Cir. 1982).  One such factor is the “relatively small size of each \n18  class member’s claim.”  Jordan, 669 F.2d at 1319.  Here, while the services at stake are critical to \n19  the health, indeed the survival, of members of the proposed class, the dollar amount of each class \n20  member’s claim is relatively small and these needy individuals do not have the financial \n21  resources to pursue separate actions.  A second factor is whether the “class is composed of \n22  unnamed and unknown future” members since the “joinder of unknown individuals is inherently \n23  impracticable.”  Id. at 1320.  The proposed class in this case includes unnamed and unknown \n24  future applicants and recipients of the Medi-Cal program.  A third factor in determining the \n25  impracticability of joinder is “whether injunctive or declaratory relief is sought.”  Id. at 1319.  \n26                                                             \n1 The declarations of Robert D. Newman, William S. Freeman and Melinda Bird are filed in \nsupport of this motion.  All other declarations cited herein have been filed concurrently in support \n27 \nof Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \n28 \n         6.    \n  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION - CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 54   Filed 06/09/10   Page 13 of 21\n1  This lawsuit only seeks injunctive and declaratory relief.  In sum, the proposed class meets the \n2  requirements of Rule 23(a)(1). \n3  2.  The Case Presents Many Common Questions of Law and Fact. \n4  On its face, Rule 23(a)(2) requires that there be questions of either “law or fact” common \n5  to members of the proposed class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  “All questions of fact and law need \n6  not be common to satisfy the rule.  The existence of shared legal issues with divergent factual \n7  predicates is sufficient, as is a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal remedies \n8  within the class.”  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998); accord, Staton \n9  v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 953 (9th Cir. 2003).  “The commonality test is ‘qualitative rather \n10  than quantitative’ – one significant issue common to the class may be sufficient to warrant \n11  certification. . . .”  Dukes, 603 F.3d at 599.  The courts do not treat commonality as a difficult \n12  hurdle; the requirement should be “construed permissively.”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1019.  \n13  The overarching issue in this case is the County’s plan to make system-wide changes in \n14  the outpatient mental health services it provides to thousands of Medi-Cal recipients.  See \n15  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001) (commonality requirement is met “where \n16  the lawsuit challenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects all of the putative class \n17  members”).  The County has announced that during the next fiscal year it intends to end all \n18  funding for the RST and TCORE programs and to reduce funding significantly for the CSH.  The \n19  County reportedly intends to replace these critical outpatient programs, which have been operated \n20  for more than a decade by nonprofit agencies with their own employees, with new clinics, which \n21  will be operated by the County with the County’s own employees.  \n22  Among the common issues of fact are the following: \n23  (1)  whether the County’s new clinics will treat the same number of clients and offer \n24  the same level of services as do the RSTs, TCORE program and the CSH;   \n25  (2)  whether the County has developed adequate plans to transition existing clients of \n26  the RSTs, TCORE program and the CSH to the new clinics beginning on July 1 \n27  without any interruption in service; \n28 \n         7.    \n  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION - CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 54   Filed 06/09/10   Page 14 of 21\n1  (3)  whether, as a result of the proposed elimination of existing programs and transition \n2  to County-run clinics, thousands of Medi-Cal recipients in this County will be \n3  denied medically necessary, outpatient mental health services; and   \n4  (4)  whether the County’s policies favor the institutionalization of persons with \n5  disabilities by maintaining the funding for costly inpatient care – the  Mental \n6  Health Treatment Center and Crestwood Psychiatric Health Facility – while \n7  cutting the funding for less expensive and more effective outpatient mental health \n8  services – the RSTs, TCORE program and the CSH. \n9  These common questions of fact in turn raise several common questions of law, including \n10  whether Defendants will be violating the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \n11  § 12312, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and California \n12  Government Code § 11135, by:  (1) failing to provide services to people with disabilities in the \n13  most integrated setting appropriate to their needs; (2) denying people with disabilities the \n14  opportunity to benefit from the County’s mental health services or providing them with less \n15  effective services; (3) using methods of administration that discriminate by placing people with \n16  disabilities at risk of institutionalization or that defeat the purpose of the County’s Mental Health \n17  Plan; (4) selecting sites for new clinics that may not be accessible to people with disabilities; and \n18  (5) failing to make modifications and/or accommodations when necessary to avoid \n19  discrimination.  \n20  Other common questions of law are whether Defendants’ proposed actions also violate \n21  requirements of the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a, that Medicaid recipients such as Plaintiffs \n22  and members of the class be provided with (1) services that are sufficient in amount, duration, \n23  and scope to reasonably achieve their purposes; (2) comparable Medicaid services to individuals \n24  with similar needs; and (3) services according to reasonable standards.  Additional common \n25  questions of law in this case are whether Defendants’ failure to provide adequate notice and \n26  opportunity for hearing prior to depriving members of the class of critical Medi-Cal mental health \n27  services violates the federal and state constitutional guarantees of due process and the Medicaid \n28  Act’s notice and hearing provisions. \n         8.    \n  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION - CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 54   Filed 06/09/10   Page 15 of 21\n1  Any differences in the ways in which these policies and practices affect individual class \n2  members do not undermine the finding of commonality.  Staton, 327 F.3d at 954-55 (where \n3  plaintiffs have alleged a “complex of discriminatory practices,” individual class members need \n4  not have been affected by every practice); Jordan, 669 F.2d at 1320 (“The legality of defendant’s \n5  practices or policies will usually be a question common to the class, and the existence of different \n6  factual questions with respect to various [plaintiffs] will not defeat satisfaction of the \n7  commonality requirement”).  A common inquiry is plainly the most efficient and appropriate way \n8  to answer any and each of the common factual and legal questions posed in this case.   \n9 \n3.  The Claims of the Named Plaintiffs Are Typical of the Class They Seek \nTo Represent. \n10 \n11  Rule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical \n12  of the claims or defenses of the class.”2  “Under the rule’s permissive standards, representative \n13  claims are ‘typical’ if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members; they \n14  need not be substantially identical.”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020; accord, Dukes, 603 F.3d at 614.  \n15  It is sufficient if the class representatives and members of the class “share a ‘common issue of law \n16  or fact,’” Cal. Rural Legal Assistance, Inc. v. Legal Servs. Corp., 917 F.2d 1171, 1175 (9th Cir. \n17  1990) (quoting Blackie, 524 F.2d at 904), “and are sufficiently parallel to insure a vigorous and \n18  full presentation of all claims for relief.”  Id. (quotations and citation omitted).   \n19  The named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the class.  All five class \n20  representatives are County residents and Medi-Cal recipients.

Co. of \n27 \nthe Sw., 457 U.S. at 158; accord, Staton, 327 F.3d at 957. \n28 \n         9.    \n  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION - CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 54   Filed 06/09/10   Page 16 of 21\n1  14, 15; Fischer Decl., ¶¶ 2, 12; Eichhorn-Smith Decl., ¶¶ 1, 11; Yannello Decl., ¶ 7; Mangio \n2  Decl., ¶¶ 2, 17. \n3 \n4.  The Named Plaintiffs and Their Counsel Will Fairly and Adequately \nProtect the Interests of the Class. \n4 \n5  Rule 23(a)(4) requires that the named class representative “fairly and adequately protect \n6  the interests of the class.”  The rule is satisfied where, as here:  (1) the representatives’ claims are \n7  sufficiently interrelated to and not antagonistic with the class’ claims; and (2) counsel for the \n8  representatives are qualified, experienced and generally able to conduct the litigation.  Hanlon, \n9  150 F.3d at 1020; accord, Dukes, 603 F.3d at 614.  Here, the interests of the class and the \n10  interests of the Plaintiffs are the same.  Both seek to prove that Defendants’ proposed elimination \n11  of existing programs and Defendants’ plan to force the Plaintiffs to transition to County-run \n12  clinics violate federal and state law.  There is no antagonism between the Plaintiffs’ claims and \n13  those of the class they seek to represent, especially since Plaintiffs only seek declaratory and \n14  injunctive relief against Defendants to require their compliance with the law.  \n15  The named Plaintiffs have affirmed their willingness to undertake the responsibilities of \n16  serving as class representatives.  They have never been the class representative in any other class \n17  actions.  Plaintiffs understand the fiduciary obligations of a class representative in a class action \n18  lawsuit and intend to represent fairly and adequately the interests of the proposed class in this \n19  case, regardless of whether this case is resolved by settlement or trial.  They do not have any \n20  interests in conflict with the interests of the proposed class.  Napper Decl., ¶ 16; Fischer Decl., \n21  ¶ 14; Eichhorn-Smith Decl., ¶ 13; Yannello Decl., ¶ 9; Mangio Decl., ¶ 18. \n22  The named Plaintiffs have retained counsel who have the resources and expertise to \n23  prosecute this action vigorously on behalf of the class.  For example, Robert Newman of the \n24  Western Center on Law & Poverty has been lead counsel or co-counsel in dozens of class action \n25  lawsuits concerning indigents’ rights to public assistance, health care and housing in federal and \n26  state courts, many of which have resulted in published opinions.

Since \n9  1978, Disability Rights California has been advocating for the legal, civil and service rights of \n10  people with disabilities throughout California.  Bird Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3.  Ms. Bird’s work has been \n11  primarily in the entitlements to Medicaid-funded health and mental health services and disability \n12  rights, and she too has been lead counsel or co-counsel in numerous civil rights class action \n13  lawsuits in state and federal court.  Id., ¶ 5.  Ms. Bird’s honors include being named Advocate of \n14  the Year in 2010 by California Mental Health Advocates for Children and Youth, and a “Top \n15  Women Litigator” in California in 2007 by the California Daily Journal.  Id.  For several years, \n16  she has been named a Southern California Super Lawyer in the areas of Constitutional Law/Civil \n17  Rights.  Id. \n18  Plaintiffs and their counsel clearly satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a)(4).   \n19  B.  The Court Should Certify the Class under Rule 23(b)(2). \n20  In addition to meeting the requirements of Rule 23(a), the proposed class must also satisfy \n21  one of the Rule 23(b) categories.  Rule 23(b)(2) is an appropriate basis for certification when the \n22  defendant “has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,” thereby \n23  making appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the class as a whole.  Fed. R. \n24  Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  \n25  Certification of a class under Rule 23(b)(2) does not require that every single class \n26  member must have been injured or aggrieved in the same way by defendant’s conduct.  A class \n27  may properly be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) if the opposing party’s “[a]ction or inaction is \n28  directed to a class . . . even if it has taken effect or is threatened only as to one or a few members \n         11.    \n  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION - CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 54   Filed 06/09/10   Page 18 of 21\n1  of the class, provided it is based on grounds which have general application to the class.”  Fed. R. \n2  Civ. P. 23(b)(2) Advisory Committee’s Note (1966).  Thus, it is sufficient if the defendant has \n3  adopted or engaged in a pattern of activity that is “central to the claims of all class members \n4  irrespective of their individual circumstances and the disparate effects of the conduct.”  Baby \n5  Neal for & by Kanter v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 57 (3d Cir. 1994). \n6  Certification of a class under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate here because Plaintiffs and \n7  members of the class all are threatened with imminent across-the-board reductions in outpatient \n8  mental health services.  Unless the Court grants a preliminary injunction, then, as of October 1, \n9  2010, the County will have closed the four RSTs and the TCORE program and will have made \n10  drastic reductions in the funding for the CSH.  Whatever programs the County hastily cobbles \n11  together in the upcoming weeks will not be an adequate substitute for the existing programs.  The \n12  resulting loss in available outpatient mental health services will not affect just one or two class \n13  members, but could well affect every member of the class.  \n14  Finally, this action is appropriate under Rule 23(b)(2) because class actions for declaratory \n15  or injunctive relief also help to avoid mootness and to facilitate enforcement of judgments.  \n16  1 Newberg at § 2.28; 2 Newberg at § 5.03.  Absent class certification, when the named Plaintiffs \n17  cease to receive Medi-Cal or mental health services from Sacramento County, the case would \n18  become moot.  At the very least, there would be no one with standing to enforce any order \n19  entered by the Court.  However, other residents of Sacramento County who meet the class \n20  definition or who may do so in the future are also entitled to the same rights under state and \n21  federal law.  Therefore, classwide final injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate to avoid \n22  mootness and to facilitate enforcement of any judgment this Court may enter.  1 Newberg at \n23  § 2.28; 2 Newberg at § 5.03; see also Lynch v. Rank, 604 F. Supp. 30, 38-39 (N.D. Cal. 1984) \n24  (certifying a nationwide class so that poor and disabled individuals outside California and “public \n25  interest groups in other forums will not be forced to throw their efforts and resources into \n26  relitigating the issue”).  Rule 23(b)(2) is satisfied in this case. \n27 \n28 \n         12.    \n  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION - CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 54   Filed 06/09/10   Page 19 of 21\n1  V.  THE COURT SHOULD DESIGNATE PLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL AS CLASS \nCOUNSEL PURSUANT TO RULE 23(G)(1) \n2 \n3  When a class is certified, the court must appoint class counsel (Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)) \n4  and the class certification order must list these counsel.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(B).  The Federal \n5  Rules list four factors the court must consider in appointing class counsel: \n6  (i) the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action;  \n7  (ii) counsel’s experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and claims of \n8  the type asserted in the action; \n9  (iii) counsel’s knowledge of the applicable law; and  \n10  (iv) the resources counsel will commit to representing the class.   \n11  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A)(i)-(iv).  \n12  Pursuant to these four factors, Plaintiffs’ counsel qualify for appointment as class counsel \n13  in this case.  The extensive papers which Plaintiffs have filed concurrently herewith in support of \n14  their motion for preliminary injunction bespeak the hard work that Plaintiffs’ counsel have done \n15  on this action up until the present day.  Counsel have interviewed and obtained declarations not \n16  only from the five named Plaintiffs and several other class members, but also from a number of \n17  service providers and experts in the field of mental health.  The moving papers also reflect \n18  counsel’s gathering of documentary evidence regarding the County’s mental health system, past \n19  and present, and legal research into the merits of a number of different claims.   \n20  As discussed above (see pages10-11 supra), Plaintiffs’ counsel have extensive knowledge \n21  and experience in handling class actions and other complex litigation, including public benefits \n22  cases, and are knowledgeable as to the applicable law.  With regard to the last of the four factors, \n23  Plaintiffs’ counsel fully intend to commit the necessary resources to represent the class in this \n24  case.  Freeman Decl., ¶ 8; Newman Decl., ¶ 14; Bird Decl., ¶ 9.  One of Plaintiffs’ law firms, \n25  Cooley LLP, has over 200 attorneys in its Palo Alto office alone and unquestionably has the \n26  capacity and resources by itself to achieve a successful outcome for the class in this lawsuit.  \n27  Freeman Decl., ¶ 6.  In terms of future work on this case, Plaintiffs’ counsel will, in all likelihood, \n28  be taking the depositions of numerous County officials, obtaining documents from the County \n         13.    \n  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION - CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 54   Filed 06/09/10   Page 20 of 21\n1  and third parties, interviewing additional class members, and taking any other actions necessary \n2  to prepare this case for final resolution, whether by summary judgment or trial.  Id., ¶ 8; Newman \n3  Decl., ¶ 14; Bird Decl., ¶ 9.  In short, the Court should appoint Plaintiffs’ counsel as class counsel \n4  in its class certification order with Mr. Newman and Mr. Freeman serving as lead counsel.  \n5 \nVI.  THE COURT SHOULD NOT REQUIRE THAT NOTICE BE GIVEN TO CLASS \nMEMBERS OF THE PENDENCY OF THIS ACTION AT THE PRESENT TIME \n6 \n7  Because Plaintiffs seek to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2), notice is not required.  Fed. \n8  R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(A); see also Elliot v. Weinberger, 564 F.2d 1219, 1228-29 (9th Cir. 1977), \n9  aff’d in relevant part, rev’d in part, 442 U.S. 682 (1979); Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, \n10  951 F.2d 1325, 1336-37 (1st Cir. 1991).  There are several reasons why notice is less necessary in \n11  a (b)(2) class action than a (b)(3) class action:  class members have no right to request exclusion \n12  from a (b)(2) class action; the “characteristics of the class may reduce the need for formal notice”; \n13  and the cost of providing notice “could easily cripple actions that do not seek damages.”  Rule 23 \n14  Advisory Committee’s Note (2003); see also 2 Newberg at § 8.05 (“[C]lass actions seeking \n15  declaratory or injunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2) are not subject to the individual notice \n16  requirements of Rule 23(c)(2).”). \n17  “The authority to direct notice to class members in a . . . (b)(2) class action should be \n18  exercised with care.”  Rule 23 Advisory Committee’s Note (2003).  Notice is not necessary in this \n19  case because the named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the class as a whole, they are \n20  clearly adequate representatives of the class, and they are represented by experienced counsel.  \n21  See Elliot, 564 F.2d at 1229 (notice not necessary for nationwide (b)(2) class where named \n22  plaintiffs are adequate representatives with experienced counsel); Stolz v. United Bhd. of \n23  Carpenters, 620 F. Supp. 396, 408 (D. Nev. 1985) (notice unnecessary for (b)(2) class where \n24  named plaintiffs are adequate representatives).  Moreover, because absent class members cannot \n25  opt out of a (b)(2) class, one of the primary reasons why notice is required in a (b)(3) class is not \n26  at issue in (b)(2) cases.  Elliot, 564 F.2d at 1229 n.14.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs respectfully request \n27  that this Court exercise its discretion to certify the class without requiring any notice to absent \n28  class members, at least at this stage of the litigation.  \n         14.    \n  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION - CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 54   Filed 06/09/10   Page 21 of 21\n1  VII.  CONCLUSION \n2  Plaintiffs satisfy all of the requirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(2).  Plaintiffs \n3  respectfully request that the Court certify the proposed class, approve Plaintiffs Leslie Napper, \n4  Jan Fischer, Jacquie Eichhorn-Smith, Ted Yannello and Lynda Mangio as class representatives, \n5  appoint Plaintiffs’ counsel to represent the class, and dispense with any requirement of notice to \n6  class members prior to judgment or settlement. \n \n7  Dated: June 9, 2010  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n8  WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY \n9 \n10  By:                   /s/ Robert D.

INTRODUCTION \n2  Plaintiffs, five adult Medi-Cal recipients with severe and persistent mental illness, \n3  urgently seek an Order of this Court to prevent Sacramento County (“County”) and other \n4  Defendants from terminating Plaintiffs’ outpatient mental health services after July 31, 2010.  \n5  Unless Defendants’ acts are enjoined, they will cause catastrophic harm to Plaintiffs and \n6  thousands of Sacramento County’s most vulnerable citizens who comprise the proposed class in \n7  this case (the “Proposed Class”) – harm including deterioration in their mental and physical \n8  condition, institutionalization in locked facilities, and increased risk of injury, even death.  \n9  Since the mid-1990s, the County has provided outpatient mental health services to Medi-\n10  Cal recipients through regional centers run by nonprofit service providers.  These centers provide \n11  medication, psychosocial therapy, group counseling, peer support and self-help, and other \n12  services based on individualized treatment plans created with input from the patients.  The \n13  centers’ experienced staff know their clients well and, over time, have gained their trust. \n14  Although these regional centers have been extremely successful in helping Plaintiffs and \n15  others with psychiatric disabilities remain in their homes and in the community, the County now \n16  intends to begin transferring these thousands of fragile individuals to new County-run clinics, \n17  staffed by County employees, starting on July 1, 2010 – barely three weeks from now.  Yet, as of \n18  this date, the County has provided virtually no details concerning what services will be provided \n19  at these new clinics; how and by whom these services will be delivered; or whether County \n20  workers are qualified or adequately trained to deliver them.  The County nonetheless plans to de-\n21  fund the existing centers over the course of two months, starting on August 1, 2010.   \n22  While the County will undoubtedly claim that it intends to provide the same level of care, \n23  there is simply no way for the County to do so.  It is undisputed that the County is both cutting \n24  the budget for these outpatient mental health services and replacing independent contractors with \n25  County workers who are more costly.  Moreover, the County has not even formulated any plans \n26  for critical steps such as transferring patient records and working with individual patients on a \n27  successful transition of their services.   \n28 \n  1.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 9 of 32\n1  As will be discussed below, Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claims that the \n2  threatened service terminations violate the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation \n3  Act of 1973, provisions of the California Government Code, the Medicaid Act, and the Due \n4  Process Clauses of the United States and California Constitutions.  In addition, the California \n5  Department of Mental Health has warned the County that the County’s interpretations of \n6  applicable law are incorrect, and that the State will not approve the County’s current plans. \n7  Plaintiffs, through their counsel, have sought to engage County officials to avoid the \n8  necessity of bringing this motion, but have not been provided with anything close to sufficient \n9  information to suggest that medically necessary mental health services will be continued as \n10  required by law.  Hence, the Court’s intervention is necessary to preserve the status quo and to \n11  prevent the predictable, avoidable and catastrophic consequences of the County’s threatened \n12  actions.   \n13  II.   STATEMENT OF FACTS \n14  A.  Sacramento’s Mental Health System \n15  Under federal and state law, California counties may elect to be the only provider of \n16  mental health services for low-income Medi-Cal recipients residing in the county.  See Welf. & \n17  Inst. Code § 5775(c); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 9, § 1810.305.  Defendants County and its Department \n18  of Behavioral Health Services (“DBHS”) have assumed this responsibility for County residents.  \n19    “Serious mental illness is chronic, relapsing illness, which without appropriate community \n20  services will result in frequent re-hospitalizations and mortality.”  Franczak Decl., ¶ 14.  The \n21  County’s Mental Health Plan (“MHP”) serves approximately 20,000 Medi-Cal recipients with \n22  mental illness; of these, approximately half are adults over the age of 18.  Ex. A at 48 (2009 APS \n23  Rpt.).1  These Medi-Cal clients must utilize County-designated facilities for their treatment, and \n24  may not choose their own providers.  In exchange, the County is required to provide them with \n25  medically necessary mental health services (Welf. & Inst. Code § 5777(a)(1); Cal. Code Regs. tit. \n26                                                   \n1 Unless otherwise stated, all exhibits are attached to the Declaration of Margaret Branick-Abilla \n27  filed in support of this Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  All other cited declarations (“Decl.”) \nare also filed concurrently with this Motion. \n28 \n  2.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 10 of 32\n1  9, § 1810.345(a)), for which it receives reimbursement from the federal and state governments.  \n2  The County Mental Health Plan’s total budget for fiscal year 2009-2010 is approximately \n3  $186 million.  Ex. A at 5 (2009 APS Rpt.).  \n4  According to the state’s quality review team, “the core mental health specialty services” \n5  available to Medi-Cal recipients in the County are provided by four Regional Support Teams \n6  (“RSTs”).  Id. at 6.  The RSTs, the centerpiece of the outpatient mental health system, were \n7  established beginning in 1993 following an intensive review and evaluation of County mental \n8  health services by a County-sponsored Redesign Committee comprised of mental health \n9  providers, clients, and family members.  Stoneking Decl., ¶ 15.  As a result of its research and \n10  analysis, the Redesign Committee determined that services should be made available to medically \n11  indigent clients through regional mental health centers located in their communities.  Id., ¶¶ 16-\n12  19.  Accordingly, the RSTs were put in place to offer community-based “comprehensive mental \n13  health and medication services” (Ex. B at 13-14 (Service Directory, attached to “Access to \n14  Services” policy)), including individual and group therapy, psychiatry services and medication \n15  management, case management to help clients access other services such as housing, and self \n16  help, peer counseling and peer support.  See Stoneking Decl. ¶¶ 16-19; Bates Decl., ¶¶ 5-6; Place \n17  Decl., ¶¶ 10-13.  The RSTs use a “recovery model” approach, which involves the patient in \n18  developing an integrated plan designed to help her achieve her stated goals.  Stoneking Decl., \n19  ¶ 17. \n20  The RSTs are operated by private, non-profit organizations under contract with the \n21  County, and together serve approximately 3,600 clients per year.  Ex. A at 3 (2009 APS Rpt.)  \n22  The four RSTs are:  Northgate Point in the northern part of the County; Human Resource \n23  Consultants (“HRC”) in the eastern part of the County; Visions Unlimited in the southern part of \n24  the County; and El Hogar in downtown Sacramento.  The staff of the RSTs are culturally and \n25  linguistically representative of their communities, which ensures that they are fluent in the \n26  clients’ native languages and aware of cultural considerations affecting recovery.  Stoneking \n27  Decl., ¶ 23; see also Bates Decl., ¶¶ 7-8 (Visions Unlimited staff speak Spanish, Hmong, Mien, \n28  Hindi, Tagalog, Farsi and Arabic); Buck Decl., ¶ 13 (Northgate serves clients who speak Russian, \n  3.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 11 of 32\n1  Hmong, Spanish and Laotian); Saetane Decl., ¶ 3 (Mien-speaking provider explains that mental \n2  illness is considered shameful among the Mien, who have developed unique terminology for \n3  describing symptoms); Ortiz Decl., ¶¶ 9-10 (Spanish-speaking provider recognizes that Latino \n4  clients and their families fear stigma and embarrassment from mental illness, and will not discuss \n5  such sensitive, personal issues through an interpreter).

Johnson Decl., ¶¶ 1, 5, 9; Kirby Decl., ¶¶ 11,12; Buck Decl., ¶ 12. \n8  The stories of the individual Plaintiffs exemplify the remarkable successes achieved under \n9  the recovery model administered by the RSTs.  Plaintiff Leslie Napper, for example, has been \n10  diagnosed as having bipolar and schizoaffective disorders and has been a patient of the Northgate \n11  RST for the last eight years.  Napper Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.  “Before I started going to Northgate, I used to \n12  think a lot about killing myself because I was so depressed and discouraged.”  Id.  She “bounced \n13  back and forth between different mental hospitals and mental facilities,” including approximately \n14  five hospitalizations at the County Mental Health Treatment Center (“MHTC”) and three or four \n15  stays at crisis residential facilities.  Id., ¶ 6.  Becoming a client at Northgate “made the difference” \n16  for her, as the staff and programs gave her a “sense of responsibility” for her life.  Id., ¶ 7.  She \n17  has not been in an institution for three or four years.  Id. \n18  Another Plaintiff, Ted Yannello, “was so depressed that [he] sat in a closet by [himself] \n19  for hours” after graduating from college in 1992.  Yannello Decl., ¶ 4.  Mr. Yannello was \n20  hospitalized on many occasions, including at least eight times at the MHTC.  Id.  He began \n21  participating in the El Hogar RST approximately ten years ago and reports that the “program has \n22  been a miracle for me.”  Id., ¶ 3.  He now has a daily routine of doing some yard work, reading \n23  the Bible and cooking his own dinner, and is “much more functional and productive.”  Id., ¶ 6.  \n24  Mr. Yanello is even able to hold down a part time job.  Id., ¶ 8.  “Taking my medications, \n25  counseling and prayer all go hand in hand to help me keep a positive state of mind.”  Id., ¶ 6.  \n26  Other clients of the RSTs attest to similar experiences.  See, e.g., Fischer Decl., ¶ 4 (“[S]ince I \n27  have been with Northgate, my hospitalizations are fewer.  Before Northgate, I would be in and \n28 \n  4.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 12 of 32\n1  out of facilities.”); Conners Decl., ¶ 9 (Human Resource Consultants RST “has always been a \n2  haven, a sanctuary, for me.”).  \n3  In addition to the RSTs, the County refers mental health clients to two other non-profit \n4  programs under contract with DBHS.  The first program is the Consumer Self-Help Wellness and \n5  Recovery Center (“CSH”), which has two sites (North and South), and serves 2,600 adults \n6  annually.  Ex. C (Wellness and Recovery Center Statistics, Fiscal Year 2009-2010).  The second \n7  program is called Transitional Community Opportunities for Recovery and Engagement \n8  (“TCORE”), which serves clients who are being discharged from acute treatment settings or at \n9  risk of entering acute care settings and are not linked to ongoing services, such as the RSTs.  \n10  Cline Decl., ¶ 7.  TCORE currently serves nearly 640 people.  Risley Decl., ¶ 6.   \n11  Plaintiff Jacquie Eichhorn-Smith is a current client of TCORE, having been diagnosed as \n12  bipolar with borderline personality and post traumatic stress disorders.  Eichhorn-Smith \n13  Decl., ¶¶ 1-2.  From 2006 until 2008, she was hospitalized approximately 20 to 25 times per year \n14  for hurting herself.  Id., ¶ 5.  “On a number of occasions when I cut myself, I used the skills I \n15  learned in nursing to sew my cuts closed.”  Id.  Since Ms. Eichhorn-Smith began receiving \n16  treatment from TCORE in May 2008, she has significantly reduced the number of times that she \n17  has injured herself and been hospitalized.  Id., ¶ 1.  She feels that she has made “significant \n18  progress with TCORE” and plans to go back to school and find a job.  Id., ¶ 12.   \n19  B.  Previous Budget Cuts and Their Impacts \n20  This is not the first time Sacramento County has cut services to members of the Proposed \n21  Class.  In April 2009, the County cut millions of dollars from its mental health budget, reducing \n22  and terminating outpatient services to thousands of clients.  Ex. A at 5-6 (2009 APS Rpt.); Ex. D \n23  at 2 (5/7/09 DBHS Meeting Minutes).  As a result, clients ended up in hospital emergency rooms \n24  that “are not accustomed to clients who are in psychiatric emergencies” (Place Decl., ¶ 22) or \n25  “got lost” as a result of changes in service and went without mental health services for months at \n26  a time (T. Johnson Decl., ¶ 13).  At that time, County officials admitted that the discontinuance of \n27  services to thousands of clients as a result of the cuts would “inevitably lead to a significant \n28  impact to the jail, emergency rooms, and the MHTC as well as other adverse health outcomes for \n  5.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 13 of 32\n1  the individuals currently in treatment.”  Bates Decl., ¶¶ 17-18 & Attachment C.  There is no doubt \n2  that the same impacts, or worse, will be felt if the County implements its current plans.2 \n3 \nC.  The County’s Current Proposed Terminations and Reductions of Medi-Cal \nMental Health Services  \n4 \n5  On March 16, 2010, Defendant Mary Ann Bennett, the County’s Mental Health Director, \n6  announced a proposed reduction of $17.5 million in DBHS expenditures for the 2010-2011 fiscal \n7  year.  Ex. E (3/16/10 Bennett Memo).  The bulk of the cuts – $11.5 million – were aimed at \n8  provider and professional services, including “our contracted providers and the vital services they \n9  provide to our clients.”  Id.  The County later announced that effective June 30, 2010, it planned \n10  to terminate all funding for the four RSTs and TCORE.  See Ex. F (4/1/10 DBHS Meeting \n11  Minutes & Attachment B).   \n12  At a public meeting on April 1, 2010, Bennett unveiled the County’s proposal to open new \n13  County-operated clinics that would be staffed with County employees displaced from other \n14  positions.  Ex. F at 2-3 (4/1/10 DBHS Meeting Minutes & Attachment B).  The County \n15  acknowledged that the budget reductions would affect “6,500 individuals,” that the County was \n16  “planning services for approximately 5,000 to 6,000 of [sic] consumers currently in services,” and \n17  that the County would reduce caseloads by referring clients to alternative clinics and primary care \n18  physicians instead of the County’s programs.  Id.  The April 1 plan stated that the new clinics \n19  would be staffed by 28.6 county employees identified for termination from other positions, but \n20  whose jobs, the County asserted, were “protected” by Section 71-J of the County Charter.3  Id.  In \n                                                 \n21 \n2 Even before the current round of service cuts, the Sacramento Mental Health Plan was unable to \nprovide timely access to outpatient mental health services to all qualified patients.  The state’s \n22 \nquality review team found that in 2008, the “system [did] not have sufficient program capacity to \n23  provide services.”  Ex. G at 13 (2008 APS Rpt.).  The reviewers found that timely access to \nservices was the County’s “greatest systemic challenge,” with wait times of up to five months for \n24 \npsychiatry appointments and excessively large caseloads of 130-150 adult consumers per staff \nmember.  Id. at 3 \n25 \n3 County Charter Section 71-J imposes certain conditions on the County before it may contract \nout county services.  See Ex. H (Sacramento Co. Charter § 71-J).  The County currently asserts \n26 \nthat Section 71-J requires the termination of existing mental health services contracts to preserve \n27  County jobs in the face of budget cuts.  See Ex. F at 2-3 (4/1/10 DBHS Meeting Minutes & \nAttachment B). \n28 \n  6.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 14 of 32\n1  addition, the County stated its intention to contract with University of California, Davis to \n2  provide medical staff in the County clinics.  Id.; see Risley Decl., ¶ 12 (noting concern that \n3  “second year residents do not have the requisite training and experience to treat our clients”). \n4  As of this date, the County still has provided virtually no details about critical issues \n5  concerning the planned County clinics, including (1) the overall budget for the clinics; (2) who \n6  will staff them, how they will be recruited and hired, how they are qualified and/or how they will \n7  be trained in the recovery model; (3) whether these workers have language abilities and cultural \n8  backgrounds comparable to the staffers they are replacing; (4) how they will develop or adopt \n9  individual treatment plans for over 5,000 clients; (5) how they can possibly prepare these clinics \n10  to open on July 1; and (6) what the client-to-staff ratios will be.   \n11  Defendants have not explained how they will be able to provide all necessary services to \n12  the same number of clients for less money and with fewer staff members than the contract \n13  programs, especially when they have admitted that County staff are more costly than the contract \n14  staff.  See Ex. I at 3 (8/20/09 DBHS Meeting Minutes).  Defendants have not announced any \n15  concrete arrangements to transition existing clients from the RSTs, TCORE and CSH to new \n16  treating staff at the County clinics, nor have Defendants addressed critical logistical details such \n17  as the copying of clients’ records at the current facilities, the transfer of client data and charts to \n18  the new facilities, and the scheduling of appointments for clients with new providers.  Bolte \n19  Decl., ¶ 20, Risley Decl., ¶ 15; Bates Decl., ¶¶ 27-28. \n20  Worse yet, the few details the County has provided are constantly changing.  For example, \n21  the County initially announced that it was going to lease four sites for the new county clinics as \n22  early as April 27, 2010.  Bolte Decl., ¶ 19.  The County later stated that it could not sign any \n23  leases until after the Board of Supervisors voted on the matter in the middle of June.  Id., \n24  Attachment B.  That would leave one or two weeks for the County to establish fully functioning \n25  new clinics ready to serve over 5,000 seriously ill clients effective July 1, 2010.   \n26  Then, on May 21, 2010, County officials informed Plaintiffs’ counsel that in addition to \n27  its own original redesign proposal, the County was still considering two other proposals for the \n28  delivery of services; that County staff would not make a recommendation for the redesign to the \n  7.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 15 of 32\n1  Board of Supervisors until at least June 10; and that the Board would not consider the redesign \n2  until at least June 14.  Freeman Decl., ¶ 8.  At the same meeting, the County unofficially \n3  indicated that it would allow the RSTs and TCORE to remain open until August 1, 2010, and that \n4  some funding might be available after that date, on a steadily diminishing basis, over the course \n5  of approximately two months as clients were transitioned to the new County clinics.  Id.   \n6  The County insists, however, that even though it does not yet know, and has not yet \n7  announced, most of the critical details concerning how its new clinics will operate, it will open \n8  them on July 1, 2010, and it will immediately begin encouraging Proposed Class members to \n9  transfer their care to the new clinics.  Id.    \n10  The County is refusing to send notices of action to current clients of the RSTs, TCORE or \n11  CSH regarding the termination of these programs and the changes in their providers and in their \n12  care.  Bolte Decl., ¶ 20; Place Decl., ¶ 40.  The County has instructed the soon-to-be terminated \n13  contract providers to tell clients themselves, through a generic form letter.  Bolte Decl., ¶ 20 & \n14  Attachment B; Place Decl., ¶ 39 & Ex. 1.4  \n15  The County’s hasty and poorly-conceived plan to dismantle the programs currently \n16  serving Plaintiffs and the Proposed Class has drawn a sharp rebuke from the State Department of \n17  Mental Health (“DMH”).  On May 5, 2010, DMH’s Chief Counsel, Cynthia Rodriguez, wrote to \n18  the County Counsel, stating that the County’s interpretations of applicable state law and the \n19  County Charter were neither “correct [n]or legal;” expressing “concern” over “clinical and quality \n20  of care issues,” the County’s lack of a transition plan, and its intention not to notify consumers of \n21  changes in their providers; and concluding, “DMH will not be able to approve [the County’s] plan \n22  updates or contracts until the resolution of these issues.”  Ex. J at 1, 3 (5/5/10 letter from DMH to \n23  County Counsel).  To date, none of these issues has been resolved to DMH’s satisfaction.  On two \n24  separate occasions, the Sacramento Bee has published editorials stating that the County’s plan is \n25  “ill-advised” and “should be a non-starter,” and that it should be enjoined “[u]nless the county \n26 \n                                                 \n27  4 The County held public meetings to inform clients about the County’s plans, but the information \nprovided was limited to the tentative locations of the County clinics.  See Place Decl., ¶ 38.   \n28 \n  8.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 16 of 32\n1  provides more proof it has its act together.”  Exs. K, L (Sacramento Bee editorials, 5/14/10 and \n2  6/4/10).  \n3  D.  Impacts of the County’s Threatened Actions on the Proposed Class \n4  Even if the County could provide equivalent levels of services under its replacement \n5  system – and there is no evidence that it can or will – the County’s abrupt termination of the \n6  services provided by the RSTs, TCORE and CSH threatens devastating impacts on the members \n7  of the Proposed Class.  Plaintiffs submit herewith the declarations of two experts who \n8  graphically, and in detail, describe the likely impacts of the County’s proposed plans on Medi-Cal \n9  recipients.  Dr. Beth C. Stoneking, a licensed clinical social worker and certified psychiatric \n10  rehabilitation practitioner with 40 years of experience in the field, served in the County’s Mental \n11  Health Services Department in the late 1980s and early 1990s and initiated the community-based \n12  outpatient care model that the County is now planning to dismantle.  Stoneking Decl., ¶¶ 7-9, 15-\n13  19.  Dr. Michael J. Franczak is a licensed psychologist who, over the course of a 38-year career, \n14  has served as a clinician, an administrator, and an expert to numerous court monitors and special \n15  masters.  Franczak Decl., ¶¶ 3-6.   \n16  In Dr. Stoneking’s expert opinion, the County’s current proposals “will, if they come \n17  to pass, inflict severe and life-threatening injury on thousands of persons who rely on the \n18  current system for the provision of effective outpatient psychiatric care . . . .”  Stoneking \n19  Decl., ¶ 41.  Dr. Franczak likens the County’s plan to “asking consumers [of mental health \n20  services] to go over a waterfall without any information about what lies at the bottom,” and \n21  opines that the combination of closing of existing centers, the lack of adequate notice, the lack of \n22  transition planning, and the almost certain reduction in services “will most likely result in \n23  significant and irreparable harm to individuals with serious mental illness currently served by \n24  these programs in the form of harming themselves or others, unnecessary institutionalization in \n25  hospital emergency rooms and psychiatric facilities, and increased criminalization of the mental \n26  health population.”  Franczak Decl., ¶¶ 10, 27; see also Place Decl., ¶¶ 3, 49 (Long time RST \n27 \n28 \n  9.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 17 of 32\n1  Executive Director “truly foresee[s] an upcoming disaster for low income residents of \n2  Sacramento County with intense mental health needs.”).5   \n3  People with severe mental illnesses are extremely fragile individuals who need continuity \n4  of care and access to services to survive; building a bond between clients and service providers is \n5  the most important predictor of success in treatment of persons with mental illness.  Franczak \n6  Decl., ¶ 13.6  Clients are far more likely to attend appointments, take their medications, and \n7  benefit from rehabilitative services if they trust their providers.  Id. \n8  The current providers do “a remarkably good job of providing needed specialty mental \n9  health services to medically indigent residents of Sacramento County at a reasonable cost.”  \n10  Stoneking Decl., ¶ 20.  Their success is attributable to multiple factors, including working with \n11  patients to devise individualized treatment plans combining medication, individual and group \n12  therapy, counseling, peer support and opportunities for developing life skills; geographical \n13  accessibility; the availability of workers who are culturally, ethnically and linguistically \n14  representative of the client communities; and the fact that the clients “know and trust the staff of \n15  these programs.”  Id., ¶¶ 21-24.  Numerous declarations from clients attest to this.7 \n16 \n17 \n                                                 \n5 Some of the threatened harm is already occurring.  The telephone line for Access, the County’s \n18 \ncentral mental health referral center, is already failing to refer callers for mental health services.  \n19  See, e.g., Freeman Decl., ¶ 10; Balaoro Decl., ¶¶ 11-13 (client discharged from a locked facility \ncalled Access line two months ago and was never connected to services). \n20  6 Many class members have lived through deeply traumatic experiences, and acknowledge that \nthey have great difficulty in placing trust in others.  See, e.g., Connors Decl., ¶ 11 (it “is difficult \n21 \nfor me” to “learn to trust new providers” and “[w]hen I’m in a new place I try not to attach to \nanyone.”); Haidary Decl., ¶ 6 (“I have a lot of issues with, and mistrust of people in the mental \n22 \nhealth system and the police, so it has taken me several years to even let the help come in.”). \n23  7 See, e.g., Fischer Decl., ¶ 5 (“I have been seeing a really wonderful psychiatrist . . . for about \nthree years whom I trust . . . .”); Mangio Decl., ¶ 15 (“[I]nteraction with Northgate staff is deeply \n24 \npersonal.  I am doing things now for myself that I never thought I could do.”); Klee Decl., ¶¶ 11-\n12 (discussing necessity of building trust with clients so that appropriate treatment may be given); \n25 \nHushen Decl. at 2:10-11 (“Tearing these clients away from the support system that they have \ndeveloped over the years is like ripping them up by the roots.”).  As Ms. Napper attests, “I am \n26 \nvery attached to the people there – my doctor, my service coordinator, and the other clients in my \n27  groups.  I cannot imagine that there is any place like it.  The idea of this place closing is like \nlosing my family.”  Napper Decl., ¶ 12. \n28 \n  10.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 18 of 32\n1  Although the County appears to believe it can easily transfer patients to new providers, \n2  “[m]ental health care providers are not interchangeable.”  Franczak Decl., ¶ 15.  The day-to-day \n3  support provided by RSTs “is critical to ensuring that their clients take their medications, attend \n4  counseling sessions, attend skill development groups and avoid deterioration in their mental \n5  status.”  Stoneking Decl., ¶ 24.  Thus even if the County opens up new clinics in the coming \n6  months, many individuals will not make appointments with them or continue taking their \n7  medications.  See id., ¶¶ 28-29, 31, 38.8 \n8  Any transfer of mental health patients from one set of providers to another requires \n9  carefully planned, individualized transition plans.  Health records need to be transferred, and \n10  more importantly, patients must understand what is happening to them and be able to establish \n11  trusting relationships with their new providers.  Id., ¶¶ 30-31.  There is no evidence that any \n12  planning, let alone the careful planning required for such a transition, has taken place.  The \n13  County’s “chaotic, slipshod and woefully insufficient” transition will cause irreparable harm to \n14  the members of the Proposed Class, both because some of them will inevitably “fall through the \n15  cracks” due to poor execution, and because others will have trusted relationships disrupted.  Id., \n16  ¶ 29; see also Franczak Decl., ¶ 27 (“The lack of planning, failure to adequately transition clients, \n17  and failure to have alternative services in place . . . will result in catastrophic harm to those \n18  currently served and their families.”). \n19  The County’s threatened acts will result in the following types of harm to Plaintiffs. \n20  Drastic declines in mental health.  As a result of the County’s threatened actions, some \n21  class members are likely to stop taking their medications and attending their counseling sessions; \n22  these individuals “are at serious risk of becoming delusional, suicidal, and harmful to themselves \n23  and others as their mental illness symptoms increase and their mental status deteriorates to the sad \n24 \n                                                 \n8 The County’s plan to refer some patients to primary care doctors will not work either, because \n25 \nthe clients often cannot secure services from these providers.  Bates Decl., ¶ 16.  Some primary \ncare physicians believe that prescribing psychiatric medications is outside their expertise; even \n26 \nwhen they feel competent in this area, they “do not have the requisite time to assume the \n27  additional responsibility of determining what type of psychiatric medications and the appropriate \ndosages for the clients, let alone have any time to build trust with the client.”  Risley Decl., ¶ 10.  \n28 \n  11.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 19 of 32\n1  level of grave disability.”  Stoneking Decl., ¶ 39; see also Cline Decl., ¶ 13 (“If someone who is \n2  schizophrenic misses an injectable medication, they may begin hearing voices.  For some clients, \n3  the voices may direct them to do harmful things to themselves or others.”); Risley Decl., ¶ 17 (“If \n4  mental health consumers cannot receive appropriate services, they will engage in inappropriate \n5  behavior.  This may result in the involvement of law enforcement and arrests.”). \n6  Adverse impacts on physical health, up to and including death.  Defendants’ actions \n7  will also cause grave harm to Medi-Cal recipients’ physical health.  See Cline Decl., ¶ 17 \n8  (physical ailments will go untreated); see also Steele Decl., ¶¶ 8-9; J. Johnson Decl., ¶ 8.  They \n9  may become so disoriented that they no longer carry out normal activities of daily living, such as \n10  shopping, cooking, cleaning their homes and clothing, dressing, bathing, and caring for \n11  themselves.  See Stoneking Decl., ¶ 39.  These clients may experience crises so severe that they \n12  require intervention by police and emergency services personnel.  Id.  Dr. Risley, the psychiatrist \n13  for one of the RSTs and TCORE, states that he would be “surprised” if one of his patients, who \n14  has kidney disease, “is still alive three months after TCORE closes,” since the staff “works \n15  closely with [the patient] to make sure that his psychiatric and medical needs are met.”  Risley \n16  Decl., ¶ 1.   \n17  Increased homelessness.  Defendants’ actions will almost certainly cause many class \n18  members to lose their housing and become homeless.  See, e.g., T. Johnson Decl., ¶¶ 5-6; \n19  Boynton Decl., ¶ 1.  Josephine Balaoro operates sixteen homes in the County that provide room \n20  and board for individuals with mental illnesses, most of whom depend upon the RSTs for their \n21  mental health services and assistance when they are in crisis.  Balaoro Decl., ¶ 1, 7-9.  Without \n22  that assistance, Ms. Balaoro believes that “90% of the time, the person would end up in a [locked] \n23  facility or wander the streets.”  Id., ¶ 1. \n24  Risk of institutionalization.  The County’s actions will also place class members at great \n25  risk of unwanted institutionalization in other psychiatric facilities, including hospitals, psychiatric \n26  health facilities, locked psychiatric nursing homes and other institutions.  Dr. Michael Franczak, a \n27  court-recognized expert in mental health care, declares:  \n28 \n  12.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 20 of 32\n1  Without adequate services in place and effective transition, these \nindividuals will experience significant deterioration in their mental status, \n2  an increase in symptoms, and a reduction in their ability to relate to others.  \nThey may become delusional or disoriented.  They also may become \n3  suicidal or dangerous to themselves and others.  As a result, they will \nlikely end up in hospital emergency rooms, psychiatric institutions, or \n4  jail.   \n5  Franczak Decl., ¶ 17 (emphasis added); see also Stoneking Decl., ¶ 5 (County plan will place \n6  clients “at risk of institutionalization or acute, more expensive services in crisis facilities, hospital \n7  emergency rooms, institutes for mental disease (“IMDs”), jails and even prisons.”).  Multiple \n8  declarants state that the planned cuts will likely throw them into crisis, requiring hospitalization.  \n9  See, e.g., Fischer Decl., ¶ 13, Napper Decl., ¶ 5; Eichhorn-Smith Decl., ¶ 12; Boynton Decl., ¶ 10.  \n10  Once hospitalized, timely discharge and a return to the community will be even more \n11  difficult for clients.  Stoneking Decl., ¶ 39 (“The trauma of institutionalization can often worsen \n12  the downward spiral for these individuals by further destabilizing them, making it extremely \n13  difficult for them to move back into the community.”).  Moreover, the County’s proposed actions \n14  will mean that clients who are presently in institutions will languish there even longer, because \n15  even before the latest proposed cuts, state reviewers found that the County’s Mental Health Plan \n16  was “unable to successfully support planned discharge” for clients in institutions.  Ex. G at 11 \n17  (2008 APS Rpt.).  According to state reviewers, a third of the beds at the County’s inpatient \n18  MHTC facility are occupied by clients who are ready for discharge but “awaiting placement,” \n19  which indicated “an inability to access lower levels of care after hospitalization.”  Ex. A at 13 \n20  (2009 APS Rpt.).  It costs far more to institutionalize individuals with mental illness than it does \n21  to provide outpatient mental health services that allow them to live in community-based settings.  \n22  See Place Decl., ¶¶ 31-32; Bates Decl., ¶ 4. \nIII.   PLAINTIFFS MEET THE REQUIREMENT FOR GRANTING A PRELIMINARY \n23 \nINJUNCTION  \n24  A.  Standards for Preliminary Injunction. \n25  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is [1] likely to succeed \n26  on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, \n27  [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is in the public interest.”  \n28 \n  13.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 21 of 32\n1  Am. Trucking Ass’ns v. City of Los Angeles, 559 F.3d 1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 2009); Winter v. \n2  Natural Res. Defense Council, 129 S. Ct. 365, 374 (2008).  Plaintiffs meet all four criteria. \n3  B.  Plaintiffs are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Claims That \nDefendants’ Program Cuts Unlawfully Discriminate Against Persons with \n4  Disabilities in Violation of the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Section 11135 \nof the California Government Code. \n5 \n6  The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) prohibits discrimination by all public \n7  entities against persons with disabilities.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (2008).  Title II of the ADA, \n8  which governs public programs such as Medi-Cal, provides: \n9  [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such \ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the \n10  benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or \nbe subjected to discrimination by any such entity. \n11 \n42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”) similarly \n12 \nprohibits discrimination by recipients of federal funds.  29 U.S.C. §§ 794-794a.9  \n13 \nUnder the ADA, a “qualified individual with a disability” is “an individual with a \n14 \ndisability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices” meets the \n15 \n“essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or \n16 \nactivities provided by a public entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12131.10  All of the named Plaintiffs are \n17 \n“qualified individual[s] with a disability” and they receive community mental health services \n18 \nthrough Medi-Cal.  See Napper Decl., ¶¶ 2-3; Fischer Decl., ¶ 2; Eichhorn-Smith Decl., ¶ 2; \n19 \nYannello Decl., ¶¶ 3-5; Mangio Decl., ¶¶ 2, 9.   \n20 \nThe Ninth Circuit has emphasized that “the ADA must be construed broadly in order to \n21 \neffectively implement the ADA’s fundamental purpose of providing a clear and comprehensive \n22 \n23                                                   \n9 In addition, Section 11135 of the California Government Code prohibits discrimination against \n24 \npersons with disabilities in programs receiving state funds, such as Medi-Cal, and further \nmandates that state-funded programs comply with the same protections as those specified under \n25 \nthe ADA.  Cal. Gov. Code § 11135.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Section \n11135 claim for the reasons set forth below for their ADA and Section 504 claims. \n26 \n10 See also 29 U.S.C. § 705(2) (substantially similar definition under Section 504).  Plaintiffs’ \n27  analysis of the ADA applies equally to Section 504.  See Miranda B. v. Kitzhaber, 328 F.3d 1181, \n1188 (9th Cir. 2003). \n28 \n  14.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 22 of 32\n1  national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.”  \n2  Barden v. City of Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1077 (9th Cir. 2002) (internal citations omitted).  \n3  Defendants’ actions violate the ADA in multiple ways, as discussed below. \n4 \na.  The Increased Risk of Institutionalization Resulting from \nDefendants’ Plans Violates the ADA’s Integration Mandate. \n5 \n6  Unjustified isolation of persons with disabilities, especially in institutions, is a form of \n7  discrimination prohibited under the ADA and Section 504.  42 U.S.C. § 12101; Olmstead v. L.C. \n8  ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 597 (1999) (ADA); Frederick L. v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare of the \n9  Commonwealth of Pa., 364 F.3d 487, 491 (3d Cir. 2004) (ADA and Section 504).  The ADA and \n10  Section 504 specifically mandate that individuals with disabilities be integrated into the \n11  community to the greatest extent possible.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (public entities must \n12  “administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \n13  needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d) (same integration mandate \n14  applies to agencies receiving federal financial assistance).  These obligations, known as the \n15  “integration mandate,” are construed and applied in the same manner.  Fisher v. Okla. Health \n16  Care Auth., 335 F.3d 1175, 1179 n.3 (10th Cir. 2003).   \n17  As the Supreme Court held in Olmstead, the integration mandate requires that persons \n18  with disabilities be served in the community when:  (1) the state’s treatment professionals have \n19  determined that community placement is appropriate; (2) community placement is not opposed by \n20  the individual; and (3) the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the \n21  resources available and the needs of others with disabilities.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 587.  \n22  Plaintiffs do not need to wait until they are institutionalized to bring a claim under the integration \n23  mandate.  Individuals at risk of placement in institutional mental health care facilities are also \n24  protected.  See Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1181. \n25  That Plaintiffs satisfy the first two prongs of the integration mandate is hardly in dispute.  \n26  The County has determined that community placement is appropriate for Plaintiffs, as its Adult \n27  Access Team approves requests for community mental health services for medically indigent \n28  County residents.  Bates Decl., ¶ 9 & Attachments A & B.  Plaintiffs’ declarations establish their \n  15.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 23 of 32\n1  strong desire for continued community placement.  See, e.g., Eichhorn-Smith Decl., ¶¶ 1, 7-9; \n2  Fischer Decl., ¶¶ 7-11; Yanello Decl., ¶¶ 5-7.; Mangio Decl., ¶¶ 13-15; Napper Decl., ¶¶4-5.   \n3  The third prong requires the County to make “reasonable modifications in policies, \n4  practices, or procedures” so as to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, “unless the \n5  public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature \n6  of the service, program, or activity.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7); Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 604.  Here, \n7  it cannot be disputed that the County is capable of making the “reasonable modifications” \n8  necessary to avoid discrimination, since it has been doing so for many years.  Thus the only \n9  question is whether the County will be able to sustain an affirmative defense that continuing to \n10  provide such services would “fundamentally alter” its program.  Under settled law, it will be \n11  unable to do so.  A plaintiff’s request to retain an existing program is not a “fundamental \n12  alteration” of that program, since the plaintiff is “not demanding a separate service or one not \n13  already provided . . . .” Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1183. \n14  Plaintiffs anticipate that the County will attempt to establish the “fundamental alteration” \n15  defense by arguing that Plaintiffs’ requests are unreasonable in light of current budget constraints.  \n16  Courts, however, have rejected the argument that fiscal burdens somehow justify failing to make \n17  reasonable modifications to implement the integration mandate.  See id.; Frederick L., 364 F.3d at \n18  495 (fundamental-alteration defense based on fiscal concerns alone would be inconsistent with \n19  Olmstead); Pa. Prot. & Advocacy, Inc. v. Pa. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 402 F.3d 374, 380 (3d Cir. \n20  2005) (same).  Moreover, any argument about fiscal constraints would require consideration of \n21  the higher cost of County staff in the County’s proposed plan, as well as the increased costs that \n22  will result from increased hospitalizations and in-patient services.  Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1183; see \n23  Place Decl., ¶ 32; Bates Decl., ¶ 4.   \n24  If the County insists on moving forward with its as-yet undisclosed and undefined plans, it \n25  must do more than merely suggest that alternative services will somehow appear, since breaks in \n26  service will expose Plaintiffs to increased risks of severe harm.  Where defendants “refuse to \n27  specify how they will ensure their continuing compliance with the ADA and Rehabilitation Act,” \n28  they “bear the burden of ensuring more than a ‘theoretical’ availability of such services.”  \n  16.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 24 of 32\n1  Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, 656 F. Supp. 2d 1161, 1174 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (citation omitted).  In \n2  Brantley, the Court enjoined the California Department of Health Care Services from \n3  implementing cuts to the Medi-Cal Adult Day Health Care program, noting:  \n4  Defendants have failed to implement any means of ensuring that, if and \nwhen the cuts take effect, the necessary alternative services will be \n5  identified and in place for Plaintiffs so that there will not be a period where \nthey are not receiving the care prescribed [in the care plans] . . . . Given \n6  their precarious conditions, even temporary gaps in services would present \nserious consequences for Plaintiffs and place them at great risk of being \n7  institutionalized. \n8  Id.  Here, too, Defendants as yet have not specified how they will replace the services they are \n9  planning to eliminate.  This is plainly insufficient; they must ensure not only that an adequate \n10  replacement system is in place, but that there is sufficient time and planning to enable clients to \n11  transition successfully to the new system.  According to Dr. Franczak, “a reasonably effective \n12  transition process,” which allows time to relocate clinic sites, transfer client records, train staff \n13  and transition clients, would “take a minimum of six months.”  Franczak Decl. ¶ 19.  Defendants, \n14  however, have stated that they will open their new clinics in barely three weeks. \n15 \nb.  Defendants Are Violating the ADA’s Prohibition on Employing \nMethods of Administration that Result in Discrimination. \n16 \n17  The ADA prohibits methods of administration or contractual arrangements which, though \n18  neutral on their face, have a discriminatory effect.  Under the regulations implementing the ADA, \n19  a public entity may not: \n20  directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize . . . methods \nof administration: (i) That have the effect of subjecting qualified \n21 \nindividuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability; \n[and] (ii) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially \n22 \nimpairing accomplishment of the objectives of the public entity’s program \n23  with respect to individuals with disabilities.  \n24  28 C.F.R. § 35.130 (b)(3).  Section 504 contains similar requirements.  See 28 C.F.R. \n25  § 41.51(b)(3)(i); 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4).   \n26    Here, by substituting understaffed County clinics for existing programs, the County will \n27  be eliminating key services that enable many patients to access those programs, including \n28  transportation services, assistance with maintaining housing, in-home visits, and hospital visits.  \n  17.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 25 of 32\n1  See supra page 4:5-7; Stoneking Decl., ¶ 5 (discussing impossibility of providing comparable \n2  services due to proposed reductions in staff).  Those whose mental health disabilities require them \n3  to have these supports in order to access outpatient services will lose those services, and many \n4  will be at risk of hospitalization.   \n5  Defendants’ plans (1) to disrupt the timely and effective treatment that Plaintiffs have \n6  been receiving; (2) to terminate this treatment without having in place any transition plan, let \n7  alone an adequate plan; and (3) to relegate Plaintiffs to little more than crisis care and locked \n8  facilities all constitute methods of administration that violate the ADA.   \n9  C.  Plaintiffs are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of their Claims that the \nProposed Cuts Violate the Medicaid Act’s Sufficiency, Comparability, and \n10  Reasonable Standards Requirements. \n11  Plaintiffs are all Medi-Cal recipients who have an entitlement to mental health services \n12  under federal Medicaid law.  Medicaid is a joint federal and state medical assistance program for \n13  certain groups of low-income people, the objective of which is to provide medical assistance to \n14  individuals whose resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services, and \n15  to furnish “rehabilitation and other services to help such . . . individuals attain or retain capability \n16  for independence or self-care.”  42 U.S.C. § 1396-1.  Participation is voluntary, but once a state \n17  chooses to participate, it must comply with the Medicaid Act and its implementing regulations.  \n18  Katie A. ex rel. Ludin v. Los Angeles County, 481 F.3d 1150, 1154 (9th Cir. 2007).11  The County \n19  is directly responsible for complying with these federal requirements because it agreed to serve as \n20  the Mental Health Plan responsible for providing specialty mental health services to all \n21  Sacramento Medi-Cal recipients.  See Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 5775, 5776, 5777.  In doing so, the \n22  County agreed, inter alia, to “comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations and guidelines” \n23  (Welf. & Inst. Code § 5776), and to provide “medically necessary mental health services to Medi-\n24  Cal beneficiaries” (id., § 5777(a)(1)).  \n25 \n26                                                   \n11 As the Ninth Circuit held in Independent Living Center of Southern California, Inc. v. Shewry, \n27 \n543 F.3d 1050 (9th Cir. 2008), all of the Medicaid provisions at issue are also enforceable directly \nunder the Supremacy Clause. \n28 \n  18.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 26 of 32\n1  The County’s proposed actions violate Medicaid Act’s requirements of sufficiency, \n2  comparability and reasonable standards.  \n3  Services funded through Medicaid must be “sufficient in amount, duration, and scope to \n4  reasonably achieve [the Medicaid Act’s] purpose.”  42 C.F.R. § 440.230(b) (emphasis added); \n5  see, e.g., Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 511-13 (8th Cir. 2006) (providing oxygen and other \n6  limited respiratory equipment, but not other equipment necessary to assist in breathing, violated \n7  the sufficiency requirement); Mitchell v. Johnson, 701 F.2d 337, 347-51 (5th Cir. 1983) \n8  (limitation of preventative dental checkups to every three years and elimination of other services \n9  violated the sufficiency mandate); Weaver v. Reagen, 886 F.2d 194, 197-200 (8th Cir. 1989) \n10  (denial of AIDS medication to individuals for whom drug is medically necessary violates \n11  sufficiency). \n12  Second, the services provided to certain groups of Medicaid recipients must be \n13  comparable in “amount, duration, and scope” to those provided to other recipients, a requirement \n14  that applies to the services provided to recipients in one county as compared to those provided to \n15  recipients in other counties.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(B); 42 C.F.R. §§ 440.240(a), (b)(1).  This \n16  Court has interpreted the comparability requirement as “creat[ing] an equality principle by which \n17  all categorically needy individuals must receive medical assistance which is no less than that \n18  provided to any other categorically or medically needy individual.”  Sobky v. Smoley, 855 \n19  F. Supp. 1123, 1139 (E.D. Cal. 1994); see also Charpentier v. Belshe, No. CIV S-90-758, 1994 \n20  WL 792591 at *5 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 1994) (limiting reimbursement for those eligible for both \n21  Medi-Cal and Medicare to no more than 20% of Medicare’s reasonable charge while placing no \n22  such limitation on Medi-Cal-only recipients violates comparability requirement). \n23  Third, Medicaid-funded services must be provided by utilizing “reasonable standards” \n24  that are “consistent with [Medicaid’s] objectives.”  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(17) (emphasis added); \n25  see, e.g., Hern v. Beye, 57 F.3d 906, 910-11 (10th Cir. 1995) (state law restricting medically \n26  necessary treatment to those whose lives were at risk was not a reasonable standard); Preterm, \n27  Inc., v. Dukakis, 591 F.2d 121, 131 (1st Cir. 1979) (state could not restrict medically necessary \n28 \n  19.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 27 of 32\n1  services solely on basis of diagnosis); Weaver, 886 F.2d at 199 (rejecting limitations on access to \n2  AIDS drugs where such limits interfered with medical judgment). \n3  Defendants’ proposed cuts will violate all three of these Medicaid Act requirements.  \n4  First, closing the RSTs and further reducing Medi-Cal funded mental health services will result in \n5  insufficient services being available to county members who are in need of them.  The County \n6  cannot credibly argue that it can create a fully-functioning mental health system for over 5,000 \n7  people within a matter of weeks, especially if the County cannot act until after the Board of \n8  Supervisors approves the plan to set up County-operated clinics at a meeting in mid-June.  See \n9  Bolte Decl., Attachment B. \n10  Second, Defendants will be unable to provide mental health services comparable to those \n11  available in other counties, given the inevitable disruption in continuity of care and vastly reduced \n12  levels of services that will occur as a result of the proposed cuts.  Although every California \n13  county is facing budget cuts, no other county has proposed the draconian measures that \n14  Sacramento County intends to take here:  dismantling the bulk of its existing mental health \n15  system and interrupting the treatment provided to the great majority of its adult recipients.  This \n16  will constrain Medicaid recipients to attempting to obtain necessary mental health services \n17  through as yet unidentified, unstaffed, and non-established treatment centers.  The unprecedented \n18  and needless disruption in treatment alone is sufficient to violate the comparability requirement.   \n19  Third, Defendants have failed to utilize reasonable standards in their decision to destroy a \n20  fully-functioning mental health delivery system  and substitute a sm aller, more costly and less \n21  efficient County-operated system, without basing this decision on  any data or expert testim ony, \n22  and in fact, in the face of exte nsive expert testimony to the contrary.  The proposed terminations \n23  and reductions are not a reasonable  approach to providing the  mental health services needed by \n24  severely mentally ill clients in the County.  Ac cordingly, Plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of  \n25  success on their Medicaid claims. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  20.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 28 of 32\n1  D.  Plaintiffs are Likely to Succeed on their Due Process and Medicaid Act \nClaims Because Defendants Have Failed to Provide Adequate Pre-\n2  Termination Notice and Opportunity for a Hearing. \n3  Medicaid recipients’ statutory entitlement to benefits is protected by the Due Process \n4  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Atkins v. Parker, 472 U.S. 115, 128 (1985) (statutory \n5  entitlements, such as Food Stamps, “are appropriately treated as a form of ‘property’ protected by \n6  the Due Process Clause”); Lewis v. Rendell, 501 F. Supp. 2d 671, 692 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (citations \n7  omitted) (“plaintiffs receiving Medicaid benefits have a constitutionally protected property \n8  interest in those benefits”).12  Procedural due process requires that the government provide \n9  Medicaid recipients notice and an opportunity for a hearing before withdrawing benefits.  \n10  O’Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 786-87 (1980); see also Goldberg v. Kelly, \n11  397 U.S. 254, 264 (1970) (termination of public benefits “pending resolution of a controversy \n12  over eligibility may deprive an eligible recipient of the very means by which to live while he \n13  waits”).   \n14  The Medicaid Act and regulations also provide statutory rights to written notice and a fair \n15  hearing before services are denied.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3); 42 C.F.R. § 431.220; Catanzano v. \n16  Dowling, 847 F. Supp. 1070, 1081-1082 (W.D.N.Y. 1994) (“A state Medicaid agency must \n17  comply with these notice and hearing requirements in order to comply with federal law as a \n18  condition of its participation in the Medicaid program” (emphasis in original)).  Under the \n19  regulations, at the time of any action affecting an individual’s claim to services, an individual \n20  must receive written notice:  (1) of the right to a hearing; (2) of the method by which she may \n21  obtain a hearing; and (3) that she may represent herself or be represented by another.  42 C.F.R. \n22  §§ 431.210, 431.206(b).  If the Medicaid recipient requests a hearing, the agency “may not \n23  terminate or reduce services until a decision is rendered after the hearing . . . .”  42 C.F.R. \n24 \n                                                 \n12 The California Constitution likewise provides that a “person may not be deprived of life, \n25 \nliberty, or property without due process of law or denied equal protection of the laws.”  Cal. \nConst. Art. I, §§ 7, 15.  However, “procedural due process under the California Constitution is \n26 \n‘much more inclusive’ and protects a “broader range of interests than under the federal \n27  Constitution . . . .”  Ryan v.

Code Regs. tit. 22, § 51014.1 (requiring comparable notice to Medi-\n2  Cal recipients prior to reduction or termination of services).   \n3  The County’s current plan not to notify benefit recipients of the planned elimination of \n4  services plainly violates Plaintiffs’ due process and statutory rights to notice and a hearing.  At a \n5  meeting on April 28, 2010, Defendant Bennett stated that recipients affected by the redesign \n6  would not receive Medi-Cal notices of action.  Bolte Decl., ¶ 20.  For Plaintiffs and the Proposed \n7  Class, whose Medi-Cal outpatient mental health services will be terminated, reduced or \n8  suspended, the violations of law could not be clearer.   \n9  E.  Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm in the Absence of an Injunction. \n10  The Proposed Class consists of Medicaid recipients who need outpatient mental health \n11  services.  Generally, in Medicaid cases, “[t]he nature of [plaintiffs’] claim – a claim against the \n12  state for medical services – makes it impossible to say that any remedy at law could compensate \n13  them.”  McMillan v. McCrimon, 807 F. Supp. 475, 479 (C.D. Ill. 1992).  In particular, irreparable \n14  injury is shown where a state denies “needed medical care” to Medicaid recipients.  Beltran v. \n15  Myers, 677 F.2d 1317, 1322 (9th Cir. 1982); see also Brantley, 656 F. Supp. 2d at 1176-77 (cuts \n16  to Medi-Cal Adult Day Health Care program caused “particularly irreparable and imminent” \n17  harm to program beneficiaries).  “To allow a serious illness to be untreated until it requires \n18  emergency hospitalization is to subject the sufferer to the danger of a substantial and irrevocable \n19  deterioration in his health.”  Mem’l Hosp. v. Maricopa, 415 U.S. 250, 261 (1974). \n20  Absent a preliminary injunction, thousands of Medi-Cal recipients in this County will \n21  soon be denied medically necessary, outpatient mental health services.  Based on his 38 years of \n22  experience in the field of behavioral health care, Dr. Franczak has concluded that Defendants’ \n23  actions “will most likely result in significant and irreparable harm to individuals with serious \n24  mental health illness” where such harm will include “increased hospitalization, use of emergency \n25  rooms, jail, prison, homeless shelters and death due to suicide.”  Franczak Decl., ¶¶ 10-11; see \n26  also id., ¶ 14 (suicide is the leading cause of death of younger people with schizophrenia).  In \n27  support of this preliminary injunction motion, Plaintiffs have filed not only their own declarations \n28  but also numerous declarations from class members, services providers and experts attesting to \n  22.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 30 of 32\n1  the widespread irreparable harm which will result from the closures of the RSTs and the TCORE \n2  program and the sharp reduction in funding for CSH.  An award of monetary damages cannot \n3  possibly compensate Plaintiffs and the Proposed Class for the devastating harms threatened by the \n4  County’s proposed actions. \n5  To give just one more example, Channel Kirby is a former dental hygienist who in 1991 \n6  experienced a “great tragedy” in her family which resulted in her placement in the Victim-\n7  Witness Program.  Kirby Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.  The program’s therapists, however, could not help her as \n8  she “continued to have plans to kill” herself.  Id.  Ms. Kirby has both bipolar and post traumatic \n9  stress disorders.  Id., ¶ 2.  “When I’m not doing well, I can stay in my house for weeks on end. I \n10  don’t bathe, I don’t brush teeth and I think about not wanting to be here on this earth.”  Id., ¶ 6.  \n11  For the last six years, Ms. Kirby has been receiving mental health services from HRC, where she \n12  has learned coping skills and benefited from the services of HRC’s therapists, counselors, \n13  physicians and other staff.  Id., ¶¶ 6-12.  She was “devasted” to learn that HRC would be closed, \n14  stating:  “HRC has been life support for me.  I’ve come down a long dark road and HRC helped \n15  me come into the light of hope.  Where am I going to go?  What am I going to do about my \n16  medication?”  Id., ¶ 13.   \n17  F.  The Balance of Equities Favor Plaintiffs. \n18    The Ninth Circuit has made it clear that the harm to low income citizens from loss of \n19  medical benefits greatly outweighs the expense to government entities of providing those \n20  benefits, even during a budget crisis.  See Indep. Living Center of S. Cal. Inc. v. Maxwell-Jolly, \n21  572 F.3d 644, 657-58 (9th Cir. 2009) (any harm to state from fiscal crisis “was outweighed by the \n22  hardships likely to be suffered by Medi-Cal beneficiaries, who would be forced to go without \n23  medical care”); Beltran, 677 F. 2d at 1322 (“balance of hardships tipped sharply in favor of \n24  plaintiffs” when “balancing the medical or financial hardship to the plaintiffs-appellees against \n25  the financial hardship to the state resulting from its inability to recover for medical services”).  \n26  Indeed, the Ninth Circuit has “repeatedly recognized that individuals’ interests in sufficient access \n27  to health care trump the State’s interest in balancing its budget.”  Dominguez v. Schwarzenegger, \n28  596 F.3d 1087, 1098 (9th Cir. 2010).   \n  23.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 31 of 32\n1  In fact, not only will Plaintiffs benefit from the granting of the preliminary injunction, but \n2  so will Defendants.  By all accounts, the County will spend much more for its employees to \n3  perform the same work now being done by employees of the contracting agencies.  See Ex. I at 3 \n4  (8/20/09 DBHS Meeting Minutes); Stoneking Decl., ¶ 40.  Inasmuch as the disruptions and loss \n5  of services will also cause some class members to end up in institutions, such as the MHTC, the \n6  cost of such institutional care greatly exceeds the cost of outpatient treatment at the RSTs and the \n7  other programs at issue.  Place Decl., ¶ 32 (“At capacity, our RST costs $9.33 per client per day,” \n8  whereas “the treatment center costs over $1,000.00 per client per day”); Bates Decl., ¶ 4 (“The \n9  Treatment Center daily cost to treat each consumer is $1,095, whereas the RST daily cost to treat \n10  each consumer is $9.33.”).  \n11  G.  An Injunction is in the Public Interest. \n12  The public interest is also squarely on Plaintiffs’ side here.  As described above, both the \n13  California Department of Mental Health and the Sacramento Bee have already voiced their \n14  opposition to the County’s proposed redesign plan.  As the Ninth Circuit has also held: \n15  State budgetary considerations do not therefore, in social welfare cases, \nconstitute a critical public interest that would be injured by the grant of \n16  preliminary relief.  In contrast, there is a robust public interest in \nsafeguarding access to health care for those eligible for Medicaid, whom \n17  Congress has recognized as “the most needy in the country.” \n18  Indep. Living, 572 F.3d at 659 (citation omitted); see also Rodde v. Bonta, 357 F.3d 988, 999 (9th \n19  Cir. 2004) (closing a hospital that served most of the county’s disabled patients was against the \n20  public interest because it would cause “increased delays in treatment and prolonged suffering and \n21  illness among all those who rely upon it”).  Finally, an injunction will vindicate the public policy \n22  – as expressed by Congress in enacting the ADA and Section 504 – in eliminating the “serious \n23  and pervasive” social problem of discrimination against people with disabilities.  42 U.S.C. \n24  § 12101.  \n25  IV.   PLAINTIFFS SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO POST BOND  \n26  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) “invests the district court ‘with discretion as to the \n27  amount of security required, if any.’”  Jorgensen v. Cassiday, 320 F.3d 906, 919 (9th Cir. 2003) \n28  (emphasis in original, citation omitted).  A district court can waive the posting of a bond where \n  24.    \n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES ISO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 2:10-CV-1119 \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 17   Filed 06/09/10   Page 32 of 32\n1  important federal rights are involved, see, e.g., Cont’l Oil Co. v. Frontier Ref. Co., 338 F.2d 780, \n2  782 (10th Cir. 1964), or where giving security would effectively deny access to judicial review.  \n3  See, e.g., Save Our Sonoran, Inc. v. Flowers, 408 F.3d 1113, 1126 (9th Cir. 2005).  Exercise of \n4  that discretion is particularly appropriate in an action brought by a class of indigent plaintiffs.  \n5  See, e.g., Walker v. Pierce, 665 F. Supp. 831, 843-44 (N.D. Cal. 1987).    \n6  V.   CONCLUSION \n7    For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court enter the proposed \n8  preliminary injunction and not require Plaintiffs to post a bond.   \n \n9  Dated: June 9, 2010  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n10  COOLEY LLP \n11 \n12  By:                  /s/ William S.

Date:  July 21, 2010 \nTime:  9:30 am \n17  Place:  Courtroom 6, 14th Floor \nJudge; Hon. John A. Mendez \n18 \n19 \n20  I. \n21  INTRODUCTION \n22  Plaintiffs seek to certify a class consisting of \"all current and future recipients of \n23  MediCal funded mental health services in the County of Sacramento;\" 2) approval of the \n24  five named Plaintiffs as class representatives; and 3) appointment of Plaintiffs' counsel to \n25  serve as class counsel.  However, Plaintiffs' request for class certification is unnecessary. \n26  If the Court ultimately determines that the County's redesign of the Adult \n27  Outpatient Mental Health Services system is unlawful, a single injunction, issued on \n28 \nMEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 83   Filed 07/07/10   Page 2 of 7\n1  behalf of the individual Plaintiffs, will have the same impact on the County's system as it \n2 \nwould have in a class action or 100 lawsuits - namely, it will stop the implementation of \n3  the County's new system.  Additionally, Plaintiffs motion for class certification is \n4  premature pending a decision on the merits of the case.  Finally, Plaintiffs' proposed class \n5  definition is overbroad and overinclusive so that any success will have no impact or \n6  effect on many individuals described by the class.  As such, this Court should deny \n7  Plaintiffs' request to certify the requested class action. \n8  II. \n9  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n10  In the interest of brevity, Defendants refer the Court to the Statement of Facts . \n11  outlined in Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \n12  Defendants assert, and incorporate herein, all of the arguments made in such Opposition. \n13  III. \n14  ARGUMENT \n15  A.  Class Certification Is Unnecessary \n16 \nCourts have found that the justifications for or objectives of class actions are: (1) \n17 \njudicial economy and efficiency; (2) protection of defendants from inconsistent \n18 \nobligations; (3) protection of the interests of the absentees; (4) access to judicial relief for \n19 \nsmall claimants; and (5) enhanced means for private attorney general suits to enforce \n20  us. \nlaws and deter wrongdoing.  See,  Parole Commission v.  Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, \n21 \n402 (1980); Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank, Jackson, Miss.  V. Roper, 445 U.S. 326,339 \n22 \n(1980); Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v.  Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240 (1975);  3 \n23 \nNewberg on Class Actions § 1:6 (4th ed.)  The historical objective behind class actions \n24 \nhas been to advance the efficiency and economy of litigation.  General Telephone Co. of \n25 \nSouthwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 159 (1982). \n26 \nA class action in the case at bar does not advance any of the objectives articulated \n27 \nabove.  Because Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief preventing \n28 \n-2-\nMEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 83   Filed 07/07/10   Page 3 of 7\n1  implementation of the County's redesigned Adult Outpatient Mental Health Services \n2  system (Hybrid Model) as a whole, any success on behalf of the named individual \n3  Plaintiffs will necessarily have system-wide effect for all consumers receiving services in \n4  the outpatient system.  Any success by the named Plaintiffs will have the exact same \n5  effect, regardless of whether the suit was brought by a single individual or as a class \n6  action, or by hundreds of individuals. \n7  For this reason, the certification of a class is unnecessary.  Judicial economy will \n8  not be served any better if relief is issued on behalf of a class, rather than individual \n9  plaintiffs.  Moreover, because any success by the named Plaintiffs will result in a system \n10  wide impact for all consumers of outpatient mental health services, Defendants will also \n11  not be subjected to inconsistent obligations to those receiving services.  Potential \n12  plaintiffs who are absent from the lawsuit will not suffer any loss of protection.  Plaintiffs \n13  do not seek damages as a remedy, so access to judicial relief for small claimants is not \n14  applicable to the case at bar.  Finally, a .class action does not create any greater means for \n15  a general suit to enforce the law - the success of one plaintiff will cause the County to \n16  equally enforce the law as it applies to the provision of MediCal services for all \n17  beneficiaries receiving outpatient mental health services. \n18  B.  Plaintiffs' Request For Class Certification Is Premature \n19 \nRule 23(c ) requires a class ruling \"as soon as practicable\" after the commencement \n20 \nof an action. F .R.C.P. 23(c ).  This requirement ensures that the rights of absent class \n21 \nmembers will be protected, and correspondingly that such members will be bound by any \n22 \nfinal judgment, in an action that was properly certified.  As such, the certification of a \n23 \nclass should occur before a decision on the merits is reached.  However, in order for the \n24 \ncourt to determine whether certification of the class, as defined, is appropriate, parties \n25 \nshould be given an opportunity to pursue discovery to determine whether the \n26 \nprerequisites of Rule 23 are satisfied.  Philip Morris Inc. v. Nat'l Asbestos Workers Med. \n27 \nFund, 214F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir. 2000); Sirota v. Solitron Devices, Inc. 673 F.2d 566, \n28 \n-3-\nMEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 83   Filed 07/07/10   Page 4 of 7\n1  571 (2nd Cir. 1982). \n2  Without the benefit of a productive discovery process to determine the extent of \n3  Plaintiffs' claims, especially those relating to the existence of irreparable harm, any \n4  determination by the Court that the requirements of Rule 23 have been met is premature. \n5  C.  Plaintiffs' Proposed Definition of the Class is Overbroad \n6 \nAssuming, arguendo, that the Court finds class certification and timing is \n7 \nappropriate, Plaintiffs' proposed class (\"all current and future recipients of MediCal \n8 \nfunded mental health services in the County of Sacramento\") is overbroad.  That \n9 \ndefinition has the effect of including individuals who are not using or never will use \n10 \noutpatient mental health services provided by Sacramento County. \n11 \nThe gist of Plaintiffs' Complaint is that the County's transition from a contractor-\n12 \noperated to a County-operated adult mental health system violates a litany of federal laws \n13 \nand regulations.  The restructured service delivery system is the Adult Outpatient Mental \n14 \nHealth Services system, not any other portion of the County's Mental Health.Services \n15 \n16  system. \n17 \nHowever, Plaintiffs' proposed class reaches and sweeps in all Medi-Cal recipients, \n18 \nboth current and future, who receive services in the County's Mental Health Services \n19 \nsystem.  The proposed class includes recipients of services who are minors, as well as \n20 \nrecipients who never enter the outpatient system.  In fact, as demonstrated by the \n21 \nDeclaration of Dorian Kitrell in Opposition to the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, \n22 \napproximately 46.2% of all inpatient clients are not linked to contracted outpatient \n23 \nservices and providers.  In addition, the Hybrid Model did not impact recipients of \n24 \nservices from the County's Full Service Partnerships (FSPs), but under the proposed \n25 \nclass, those consumers would be included within the class definition.  Thus, the class is \n26 \noverbroad because it sweeps in recipients who will not at any time be impacted by the \n27 \nchallenged restructure of the Adult Outpatient Mental Health Services system. \n28 \n-4-\nMEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 83   Filed 07/07/10   Page 5 of 7\n1  The overinclusive nature of Plaintiffs' proposed class fails to satisfy the \n2  \"commonality\" prerequisite of class certification.  Plaintiffs' contend that the County's \n3  Wellness Centers will not treat the same number of clients and will not provide the same \n4  level of services as the contractor system; they further challenge the adequacy of the \n5  transition plan to a County-operated system.  However, those questions of fact are not \n6  common to the proposed class. \n7  The number of clients, level of services, and transition to a new provider are only \n8  relevant issues for those MediCal beneficiaries currently receiving outpatient services \n9  through the RST model, not to those beneficiaries who receive mental health services \n10  through another program or model.  The purported common issues of fact are not an issue \n11  for those who, for instance, are minors, adults who require a higher level of mental health \n12  services than the RSTs provide, or in another system such as the FSPs. \n13  Likewise, Plaintiffs' essential questions of law - whether the Hybrid Plan violates \n14  the American's With Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,  California \n15  Government Code § 11135, the Medicaid Act, and Plaintiffs' due process rights - are \n16  irrelevant to a number of MediCal recipients of mental health services under the \n17  Plaintiffs' proposed class.  Assuming arguendo that the Plaintiffs can prove that the \n18  County's Hybrid Plan is unlawful, the violation causes no injury to individuals who do \n19  not receive outpatient mental health services under the contractor-operated model.  As a \n20  result, no relief to those plaintiffs need be granted because there was no injury-in-fact. \n21  D.  The Named Plaintiffs Do Not Adequately Represent the Class \n22 \nA plaintiff seeking to maintain a class action must be a member of the class that he \n23 \nclaims to represent.  General Tel.  Co. ofS outhwest v. Falcon, supra, 457 U.S. at 156.  In \n24 \naddition, the named plaintiffs must also allege and show that \"they personally have been \n25 \ninjured\" or will suffer injury.  Lieboe v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Ca., 350 F.3d 1018, \n26 \n1022 (9th Cir. 2003) [without a valid claim, plaintiffs lack of standing and class action \n27 \nmust be dismissed]. \n28 \n-5-\nMEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 83   Filed 07/07/10   Page 6 of 7\n1  If a plaintiff fails to establish standing, he may not seek relief on behalf of himself \n2  th \nor any other member of the class.  Nelson v. King Co.  895 F.2d 1248, 1250 (9 Cir. \n3 \n1990), quoting O'Shea v. Littleton 414 U.S. 488, 494 (1974).  Standing must exist prior \n4 \nto class certification.  Lee v.  Orego 107 F.3d 1382, 1390 (9th Cir.l997), cert den. 522 U.S. \n5 \n927.  Individual standing requirements constitute a threshold issue. \n6 \n7  As argued extensively in their Opposition to the Motion for Preliminary \n8 \nInjunction, Defendants contend that the named Plaintiffs have not suffered, nor are at \n9 \nimminent risk of suffering, harm by virtue of implementation of the Hybrid Model. \n10 \n! \nPlaintiffs only express abstract fears and anxiety regarding the redesign.  However, such \n11 \nfears and anxiety do not suffice to meet the requirement that representative plaintiffs \n12 \n13  must show that they personally have been injured or are at substantial risk of injury.  No \n14 \nsuch injury or risk of injury has been shown.  No evidence of a credible threat of injury \n15 \nhas been established.  They assert only speculative contingencies, based on a hypothetical \n16 \nand unadopted system redesign.  Therefore, the named plaintiffs lack standing and are \n17 \ninadequate to represent any class. \n18 \n19  E.  Certification of the Class under Rule 23(b)(2) Is Not Warranted \n20 \nA  class action is proper under Rule 23(b )(2) only where the party against whom \n21 \nrelief is sought has acted, or refused to act, on grounds generally applicable to a class of \n22 \npersons, making declaratory or injunctive relief appropriate to the class as a whole. \n23 \nWhile not every class member must have been injured or aggrieved, there mustbe a \n24 \n25  pattern of activity that is likely to be the same as to all members of the class.  Baby Neal \n26 \nfor & by Kanter v.  Casey, 43 F.3d 48,52 (3rd Cir. 1994) .. \n27 \n28 \n-6-\nMEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 83   Filed 07/07/10   Page 7 of 7\n1  Given the overbroad nature of Plaintiffs' proposed class, not every class member \n2  ,--\nwill have been injured or aggrieved.  Those who will never see the services provided by \n3 \neither the RSTs or the County-operated Wellness Centers will never be affected by the \n4 \nrestructure system.  However, in order to be certified as a class under Rule 23(b )(2), there \n5 \nmust be a pattern of activity that is likely to be the same to all members of the class. \n6 \n7  That finding does not exist, given the scope of the proposed class.  According to \n8 \nPlaintiffs' motion, \"members of the class are all threatened with imminent across-the-\n9 \nboard reduction in outpatient mental health services.\"  Plaintiffs' Motion to Certify Class, \n10 \np. 12.  Even if true and reductions in outpatient mental health services were to occur, it \n11 \ncan not be said that an injunction on behalf of all members of the proposed class is \n12 \n13  appropriate - those who do not or will not receive adult outpatient services have no \n14 \nstanding to seek such an injunction.  Therefore, there is not an adopted pattern of activity \n15 \napplicable to all members of the class and Rule 23(b)(2) is not satisfied. \n16 \nIV. \n17 \nCONCLUSION \n18 \n19  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiffs' request to certify the \n20 \nproposed class and to approve Plaintiffs Leslie Napper, Jan Fischer, Jacquie Eichhorn-\n21 \nSmith, Ted Yannello, and Lynda Mangio as class representatives. \n22 \nDATED: July 7, 2010  ROBERT A.

INTRODUCTION \n2  Each of the arguments set forth in Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class \n3  Certification (“Opp.”) is easily met, and the Court should therefore certify a class according to the \n4  modified (and slightly narrowed) definition described herein.   \n5  Defendants argue that the proposed class definition is too broad; to meet this objection, \n6  Plaintiffs suggest a narrowed class consisting of “all current and future adult recipients of \n7  MediCal funded outpatient mental health services in the County of Sacramento” (modifications \n8  italicized).  Defendants all but concede that such a narrowed class consisting of those putative \n9  class members is sufficiently narrow to warrant class certification.  \n10  Plaintiffs claim that class certification is “unnecessary” because complete injunctive relief \n11  may be granted without certification of a class.  In response to this argument, Defendants reiterate \n12  that they have moved for class certification in an abundance of caution, so that the Court is \n13  provided with the tools it may feel necessary to grant complete relief.  If the Court agrees with \n14  Defendants that complete injunctive relief does not require class certification, Plaintiffs agree that \n15  class certification could be deferred, although it is certainly warranted at this time. \n16  Defendants’ remaining objections are easily disposed of.  The claims that certification \n17  would be “premature” or “not warranted” are both based on the overbreadth argument; with \n18  respect to the narrowed class defined below, there can be no question that Defendants have acted \n19  in a manner generally applicable to the class under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n20  Procedure.  Finally, the argument that the named Plaintiffs “do not adequately represent the class” \n21  is really an argument that no class member has suffered any injury.  Plaintiffs easily refute this \n22  argument, both here and in their opening and reply briefs in support of the motion for preliminary \n23  injunction.  This Court should therefore certify the proposed class, appoint Plaintiffs’ counsel to \n24  represent the class, and dispense with any notice to class members prior to judgment or \n25  settlement. \n26 \n27 \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY MEMORANDUM ISO \n  1.  MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION\nCASE NO. 2:10-CV-0119 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 96   Filed 07/14/10   Page 4 of 8\n1  II.  ARGUMENT \n2 \nA.  This Court May Narrow the Proposed Cla ss Definition So That It Includes \nOnly Adult Recipients of Outpatient Services. \n3 \n4  Defendants assert that a class consisting of “all current and future recipients of MediCal \n5  funded mental health services in the County of Sacramento” is overbroad because it includes \n6  minors, persons receiving inpatient services, and persons who may never be affected by the \n7  redesign of outpatient services.  Opp. at 4-5.  Having considered these objections, Plaintiffs agree \n8  to narrow the class definition to “all current and future adult recipients of MediCal funded \n9  outpatient mental health services in the County of Sacramento” (modifications italicized).  These \n10  modifications will prevent minors and persons who will never receive outpatient services from \n11  being swept into the class.  Plaintiffs do not agree, however, that the class should exclude future \n12  recipients of outpatient services.  Undoubtedly some persons who are currently minors and/or \n13  currently receiving inpatient services will one day become recipients of adult outpatient services; \n14  these individuals will surely be harmed by the system redesign that is the focus of this lawsuit, \n15  and deserve to be protected from it.  \n16  Courts have discretion to redefine a class under appropriate circumstances to bring the \n17  action within Rule 23.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(d)(4).  In particular, it is well-settled that a court may \n18  modify, narrow or change a class definition when appropriate.  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, \n19  872 n.27 (9th Cir. 2001) (“Where appropriate, the district court may redefine the class . . .”); Penk \n20  v. Oregon State Bd. of Higher Ed., 816 F.2d 458, 467 (9th Cir. 1987) (upholding the district \n21  court’s redefining of the class).  District courts may do so even when the proposed class is \n22  redefined in a plaintiff’s reply briefing in support of class certification.  See In re TFT (Flat \n23  Panel) Antitrust Litig, 2010 WL 1286478, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 28, 2010); Greenwood v. \n24  Compucredit Corp., 2010 WL 291842, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 19, 2010); White v. E-Loan, Inc., \n25  2006 WL 2411420, at *1 n.2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 18, 2006).  \n26  Here, it is appropriate to narrow Plaintiffs’ proposed class, and a class consisting of “all \n27  current and future adult recipients of MediCal funded outpatient mental health services in the \n28  County of Sacramento” is sufficiently narrow to warrant class certification.

Defendants also acknowledge that implementation of its new \n3  “Adult Outpatient Mental Health Services” system will affect “all consumers receiving services \n4  in the outpatient system.”  Opp. at 3.  Defendants therefore cannot dispute that a class consisting \n5  of individuals affected by a change in that system is sufficiently narrow.  See Alliance to End \n6  Repression v. Rochford, 565 F.2d 975, 978 (7th Cir. 1977) (scope of the proposed class is defined \n7  by the policies of the defendants).   \n8  Moreover, Defendants will not be prejudiced by certification of a class consisting of these \n9  individuals.  Throughout Plaintiffs’ opening memorandum in support of this motion, Plaintiffs \n10  argue that MediCal recipients in Defendants’ outpatient system, not the entire mental health \n11  system, will be impacted by the proposed change in policy.  This Court therefore has sufficient \n12  information to reach a decision on class certification. \n13  B.  Certification  of This Narrow Class of   Plaintiffs Under Rule 23(b)(2) Is \nAppropriate Because All Class Members  Are Threatened by th e County’s \n14  Restructuring of Outpatient Mental Health Services.   \n15  Arguing that Plaintiffs’ proposed class definition is overbroad, Defendants contend that \n16  this class may not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) because not every class member will be \n17  injured by their restructured system.  Opp. at 7.  As explained above, this Court may narrow the \n18  class to include only those members who will be aggrieved by Defendants’ conduct.  Once it does \n19  so, Defendants’ arguments against certification under Rule 23(b)(2) must fail.   \n20  As Defendants note, Plaintiffs bringing an action under Rule 23(b)(2) need only show that \n21  defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, so that \n22  injunctive relief or declaratory relief is appropriate for the whole class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n23  Here, the proposed redefined class fits squarely within the ambit of subdivision (b)(2).  By \n24  Defendants’ own admission, every putative class member will be affected by the transition from \n25  contractor-operated to County-operated adult mental health system.  Opp. at 3-4.  These putative \n26  class members therefore have standing to pursue injunctive and declaratory relief.  Class \n27  certification is therefore appropriate under Rule 23(b)(2).   \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY MEMORANDUM ISO \n  3.

All Plaintiffs Have Been Injured or Are in Imminent Danger of Being Injured \nby Defendants’ Proposed Redesign. \n2 \nPlaintiffs have standing to sue in federal court if they meet a three-part test: injury in fact, \n3 \ncausation, and redressability.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561 (1992).  \n4 \nDefendants do not dispute causation and redressability, focusing solely on the contention that no \n5 \n“injury in fact” has occurred.  \n6 \nOf course, a plaintiff need not wait until he or she has already been injured in order to \n7 \nassert entitlement to class-wide relief; it is sufficient that the plaintiff be in immediate danger of \n8 \nsustaining “some direct injury as a result of the challenged statute or official conduct.”  \n9 \nArmstrong, 275 F.3d at 860.  In their opening and reply briefs in support of their motion for \n10 \npreliminary injunction, Plaintiffs have abundantly demonstrated the imminent harm threatened by \n11 \nthe County’s system redesign.  The declarations of Drs. Stoneking and Risley established the \n12 \nthreatened impacts on Plaintiffs’ physical and mental health, the risk of homelessness, and the \n13 \nrisk of institutionalization.  A plaintiff does not need to wait until he or she is institutionalized to \n14 \nbring a claim for relief under the ADA’s integration mandate.  Fisher v. Okla. Health Care Auth., \n15 \n335 F.3d 1175, 1179 n.3 (10th Cir. 2003). \n16 \nMoreover, some class members have already suffered harm due to the County’s poor \n17 \nplanning and incomplete or inadequate communications to consumers.  For example, as detailed \n18 \nin the Declaration of Uma Zykofky submitted by Defendants in opposition to the motion for \n19 \npreliminary injunction, a number of class members were given inaccurate information when they \n20 \ncalled the County to inquire about the proposed changes in their care, and “expressed distress \n21 \nabout the change.”  Zykofsky Decl. (Dkt. No. 89) at 10:17-26.    \n22 \n23  D.  Class Certification Is Not Premature Wh en This Court Has All the  Evidence \nIt Needs to Decide Plaintiffs Motion for Class Certification. \n24 \nDefendants contend that it is inappropriate to certify a class before they have been \n25 \nafforded the opportunity to conduct additional discovery relating to Plaintiffs’ claims, and seek to \n26 \ndelay a decision on the certification of a class until after a decision is reached on the merits of this \n27 \ncase.  Such a delay is inappropriate.  Generally, class certification is not delayed pending a \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY MEMORANDUM ISO \n  4.  MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION\nCASE NO. 2:10-CV-0119 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 96   Filed 07/14/10   Page 7 of 8\n1  decision on the merits, but only when there is a need to develop a sufficient evidentiary record for \n2  the court to decide whether class certification is warranted.  Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, \n3  901 n.17 (9th Cir. 1975) (class certification can be granted if the court has sufficient material \n4  before it to determine the nature of the allegations and to determine whether the requirements of \n5  Rule 23 are met).  There is more than a sufficient evidentiary record to determine the nature of \n6  Plaintiffs’ claims and that the Rule 23 requirements have been met.1   \n7  Defendants give only the faintest indication of the further discovery that is supposedly \n8  needed, and make almost no effort to demonstrate why that evidence is needed for the class \n9  certification inquiry.  Further, Rule 23(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \n10  a decision on a motion for class certification should be reached as early as practicable.  \n11  Defendants fail to explain why this Court should depart from the Federal Rules of Civil \n12  Procedure, and Plaintiffs’ motion is therefore timely. \n13 \nE.  Classwide Relief Is A ppropriate to Protect Putative Class Membe rs and to \nFacilitate Enforcement of Any Judgment This Court May Enter. \n14 \n15  Plaintiffs demonstrated in this Reply and their Memorandum in Support for Class \n16  Certification that the proposed class, as redefined above, meets the requirements of Rule 23.  In \n17  fact, Plaintiffs showed that class certification provides a more efficient and consistent mechanism \n18  for adjudicating challenges to the Defendants’ county-wide policy that will result in the loss of \n19  outpatient mental health services than numerous individual actions.  Defendants, however, \n20  contend that all putative class plaintiffs would benefit from a favorable outcome in this case and \n21  the resulting injunctive and declaratory relief, and therefore class certification is unnecessary.  \n22    This assertion ignores the potential limitations of the scope of a preliminary injunction, \n23  which Plaintiffs detailed in their Memorandum in Support of Class Certification.  See Pl’s Mem. \n24  of Points and Authorities In Support of Mot. For Class Certification at 2-4; see also Zepeda v. \n25  INS, 753 F.2d 719, 728 n.1 (9th Cir. 1984) (“Without a properly certified class, a court cannot \n                                                 \n26  1  Even if more discovery is needed by the Defendants, the proper resolution is not to deny the motion for class \ncertification.  A class may be certified and additional discovery allowed.  See Hickey v. City of Seattle, 236 F.R.D. \n27 \n659, 662 (W.D. Wash. 2006) (certifying the class while granting additional discovery).   \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY MEMORANDUM ISO \n  5.

California, 102 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. \n2  1996).  Without class certification, the Defendants may object to the scope of this Court’s order \n3  and nonparties may have difficulty enforcing any order entered by this Court.  In particular, if \n4  rulings are limited to the named Plaintiffs in this case, nonparties might not be able to invoke the \n5  judgment, but might be required to instigate new litigation if the Defendants did not adhere to the \n6  judgment.  See 2 Newberg, Class Actions (4th ed. 2002) § 5.03.  The cost of beginning new \n7  proceedings for those nonparties may be prohibitive, especially given that Plaintiffs seek to \n8  represent individuals who lack resources and may have deteriorating mental conditions as a result \n9  of Defendants’ policies, which create barriers to pursuing litigation.   \n10  If Defendants stipulate that they are willing to make systematic changes to prevent the \n11  across-the-board reductions in adult outpatient mental health services in response to an injunction \n12  issued on behalf of Plaintiffs, or if the Court otherwise determines that complete relief may be \n13  granted without certification of a class, then class certification could be deferred, even though \n14  Plaintiffs believe there is no substantial reason for doing so.  Otherwise, class certification is \n15  appropriate at this time, and Plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing to warrant class \n16  certification.   \n17  III.  CONCLUSION \n18  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs have satisfied all of the requirements of Rule 23(a) \n19  and 23(b)(2).  Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court certify the proposed class, as amended, \n20  appoint Plaintiffs’ counsel to represent the class and dispense with any requirement of notice to \n21  class members prior to judgment or settlement. \n \n22  Dated: July 14, 2010  COOLEY LLP \n \n23 \n24  By:                                  /s/ \nWilliam S.

INTRODUCTION\n2\nDefendants’ Opposition (“Opp.”) is predicated on false factual assertions, wishful \n3\nthinking and unsupported legal contentions.  The County’s “anticipation” that funding for its \n4\nredesigned system will be “equal” to the 2009-10 budgeted amount is inconsistent with its \n5\noriginal justification for the redesign, is based on receipt of additional state and federal monies \n6\nthat are far from certain to be approved, and improperly counts money that will fund increased \n7\nexpenses related solely to the transition itself, and not ongoing care.  The County’s claim that it \n8\ncan provide equivalent services to Plaintiffs ignores both this likely budget shortfall and its own \n9\nadmission that even with equivalent funding, it cannot possibly provide the same services because \n10\nCounty employees are more expensive than the contracted workers they would replace.  \n11\nClaiming that this motion is based entirely on the unfounded fears of class members, \n12\nDefendants fail to address Plaintiffs’ well-founded criticisms of their proposal, which have been \n13\nadvanced by credible experts and administrators with decades of experience in serving people \n14\nwith severe, chronic mental illness.  In addition, the recent depositions of the two highest-ranking \n15\nCounty mental health officials confirm that the County’s transition plans are haphazard and \n16\nincomplete.\n17\nPlaintiffs have convincingly demonstrated that this redesign is unlawful; that it is \n18\ndangerous and threatens them with immediate and irreparable harm; and that it should be \n19\nenjoined.\n20\nII. DEFENDANTS HAVE FAILED TO REBUT PLAINTIFFS’ SHOWING OF IRREPARABLE \n21 INJURY IN THE ABSENCE OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.\n22 As Plaintiffs explained in their opening brief, a crucial element in establishing the right to \n23 a preliminary injunction is a likelihood of irreparable injury absent judicial relief.  Plaintiffs’ \n24 Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Preliminary Injunction (“Pl. Br.”) at 14, \n25 citing Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 129 S. Ct. 365, 374 (2008).  Throughout its \n26 opposition, the County contends that there will be no injury to Plaintiffs because there will be “no \n27 closure or reduction of services” and no change in “the menu or level of outpatient services” it \n28 provides.  Opp. at 2, 3, 8, 10 n.16, 11, 15, 17, 20, 22, 24.  Repeating an assertion, however, does \n1. REPLY MPAISOMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION –CASE NO.2:10-CV-1119\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 99   Filed 07/14/10   Page 4 of 17\n1 not make it true.  The evidence before this Court confirms that the County’s proposed “hybrid \n2 plan” will result in a reduction in services, as well as a disruption in medically necessary \n3 treatment that will inevitably result in harm to vulnerable county patients. \n4 A. The County Will Not Receive Equivalent Funding for Adult Outpatient \nServices in 2010-11.\n5\nThe County states that last year’s funding for services for these 5,000 clients was $18.6 \n6\nmillion, and claims that funding for its new county clinics will be the same.  Opp. at 2:21-24, 3:5-\n7\n6.  The claimed 2010-11 amount is illusory, however, because it includes $6.4 million that may \n8\nnot be allocated and/or will not go to ongoing client services.  First, the County includes a one-\n9\ntime allocation by the Board of Supervisors of $2.9 million to fund “transition” expenses.  Opp. at \n10\n2; Bennett Declaration (“Decl.”) (Dkt. No. 88) at 10 & Ex. A (Memorandum of Sacramento \n11\nCounty Board of Supervisors (“Bd. Memo”)).  Because these funds are for the transition itself, it \n12\nis obvious that they are not available for ongoing client services in 2010-11, and even more \n13\nobvious that they will not be available in coming years.  Second, the total includes $2.5 million in \n14\nfunding under the Mental Health Services Act (“MHSA”) that maybe available “[u]pon approval \n15\nby the state after a community process,” and that could then trigger an “anticipated” $1 million in \n16\nfederal Medicaid funds.  Opp. at 3:1-4.  The County’s receipt of these funds is entirely \n17\nspeculative, as they have not been approved or released.  See id.  Without these two items, the \n18\nfunding for the new County clinics consists only of “$11.3 million for the Sacramento Wellness \n19\nCenters [and] $.9 million for WRC.”  Opp. at 2:25-3:1.  This $12.2 million total represents a \n20\nreduction of one third – $6.3 million – below last year’s budget.\n21\nEven more unsettling is the fact that all State MHSA funding forthe County’s “TCORE \n22\nWorkplan” – a total of over $7.5 million – depends entirely on State approval of this massive \n23\nchange (Opp. at 2), although it has no assurance that the State will approve this change.  The \n24\nCounty admits that its planned “redesign” requires “State approval” (Bd. Memo at 2) but plans to \n25\n“front the funding . . . pending compliance with the MHSA.”  Id.  Proceeding with these cuts \n26\nwithout first obtaining state approval is simply reckless, since officials with the State Department \n27\n28\n2.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 99   Filed 07/14/10   Page 5 of 17\n1 of Mental Health (“DMH”) have already expressed strong disapproval of the County’s redesign,1\n2 and could well deny the County’s request to use MHSA funds for the new County clinics.  The \n3 County inexplicably failed to initiate the public comment process required before it may submit \n4 the required MHSA plan update and amendment request;2 even after it completes this, the State \n5 has 60 days to approve or deny the request.  Welf. & Inst. Code §5847(g)(1).  \n6 In fact, the State has not indicated that it will approve the County’s plan, has expressed \n7 concerns about the plan, and has not yet responded back to the County’s latest attempts to allay \n8 those concerns.  Supplemental (“Supp.”) Branick-Abilla Decl., Ex. A (Deposition of Mary Ann \n9 Bennett-Treadway) (“Bennett Depo.”) at 69:22-70:11.  In the interim, if the County destroys its \n10 cost-effective system of Regional Support Teams (“RSTs”) and is then unable to access MHSA \n11 funds for its county facilities, Plaintiffs and other needy clients will be left with the worst of all \n12 possibilities.  The County admits that it does not know what it would do if the State does not \n13 approve these funds, and has no alternate plan in place.  Id. at 71:12-13, 71:25-72:2.  It does not \n14 even have a plan in place in the event of a delay in the State’s approval process.  Id. at 138:6-9.  \n15 At a minimum, the County must wait until the State has acted on its request to change its use of \n16 MHSA funds before taking irreversible steps to defund the RSTs.  \n17 B. Even If the County Could Be Assured of Level Funding, Services Would \nBe Reduced Due to the Greater Expense of County Workers and Their \n18 Lack of Appropriate Training. \n19 Even assuming 2010-11 funding remained level, which it will not, the County’s plan will \n20 result in a reduced number of staff available to Plaintiffs and other County Medi-Cal patients.  \n21 County officials have candidly admitted that contracting with private providers is “cost effective” \n22 because County employees are far more expensive than the staff of the private non-profits who \n23 ___________________________________\n1Branick-Abilla Decl. (Dkt. No. 19), Ex. J (DMH letter).  Eventual State approval is made more unlikely by the fact \n24\nthat the “TCORE workplan” approved by the State in 2006 required caseloads of 1:12, and services offered in the \ncommunity, including the client’s home, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Supp. Branick-Abilla Decl., Ex. B \n25\n(Three-year MHSA Workplan dated Jan. 31, 2006) at 103.  Although the County claims that its new wellness \ncenters will follow the TCORE workplan, the services are clinic-based, not community-based, have a far higher \n26\ncaseload and will be open only during traditional 9 to 5 business hours.  Bennett Depo. at 130:9-15.  \n27 2Supp. Branick-Abilla Decl., Ex. C (MHSA Annual Update, 2010-2011) at PRA 001569-1570.  \n28\n3.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 99   Filed 07/14/10   Page 6 of 17\n1 now provide services.3  As a result, far fewer staff will be available to provide treatment services \n2 under the “hybrid plan.”4\n3 In practical terms, this drastic increase in caseload means equally drastic reductions in the \n4 services they receive.  With a caseload of 75 to 90, workers cannot provide the former TCORE \n5 clients with the case management, follow-up, home visits, and counseling they need.  Supp. \n6 Franczak Decl., ¶¶ 12-14.5  The County argues that the higher caseloads reflect different staffing \n7 patterns so that a direct comparison is not possible (Opp. at 6; Weaver Decl. (Dkt. No. 91) at 7), \n8 but the bottom line is that there will be fewer staff, and thus, fewer client services.  Their lack of \n9 experience with community-based social rehabilitation services will only compound these \n10 problems.  The County’s belief that licensing is sufficient training is no answer, according to an \n11 expert in training and credentialing in psychosocial rehabilitation.  Dahlquist Decl., ¶ 16. \n12 C. The County’s “Hybrid Plan” Is Not Based On the Recovery Model.\n13 While Defendants claim to be “committed to the recovery model,” both the structure and \n14 planned implementation of the system redesign show otherwise.  While Plaintiffs are not here \n15 contending that only a recovery model-based system could ever be appropriate, the fact that the \n16 new system lacks critical elements of the model Defendants claim to follow demonstrates both \n17 the unreliability of Defendants’ blanket statements and the dangers implicit in the transition.\n___________________________________\n18 3Answerto Class Action Complaint (Dkt. No. 68), ¶ 27; Branick-Abilla Decl. (Dkt. No. 19), Ex. I (8/20/09 Meeting \nMinutes); Bennett Depo. at 139:7-13. \n19\n4The County further concedes that the caseloads of 75 to 90 will be higher than those RSTs, which have a staffratio \n20\nof 1:70.  Bd. Memo at 10.  In fact, the deterioration in staffing ratios is far worse than the County lets on.  Under \nthe RST model, a case-carrying “personal service coordinator” is supported by a team of clinicians who are not \n21\ncounted in the staffing ratio; in the new County model, however, the clinicians are the “case carrying” workers, \nmeaning that unlike the current system, the County plan “does not provide for clinical staff whose time is devoted \n22\nonly to their clinical specialty.”  Supp. Franczak Decl., ¶ 13; see also Stanton Decl., ¶ 13 (noting her site will see \n60% reduction in staffing under County redesign, which “will have a significant effect on staff’s ability to provide \n23\none-to-one peer support”).  For some, the discrepancy in caseloads will be even greater, since TCORE clients have \nan even lower caseload ratio of 1:25 at present, a fact that the County conveniently omits.  When the 2,000 clients \n24\ncurrently served through the County’s TCORE programs are moved to the new county clinics, theycan expect a \ncaseload that is more than 3 times higher than the caseloads of 1:25 they were promised.  \n25\n5Another unacknowledged cut in services is the transfer of staff from the County’s Adult Access team to the new \n26\ncounty clinics.  The Access teams are the hub around which all county mental health services turn, since they \nhandle initial assessments and referrals, crisis referral, involuntary hospitalizations, discharge planning, etc.  \n27\nBranick-Abilla Decl.

Second Supp. Stoneking Decl., \n5 ¶4.  In contrast to the current, client-centric model, the redesign has been imposed on clients \n6 from the top down, with no involvement by clients, family members, community members or \n7 other stakeholders; County planning and staff meetings are no substitute for a genuine \n8 community-involved process.  Id., ¶ 6.  To make matters worse, despite repeated assurances that \n9 newly transferred County workers would be trained in the recovery model, at a recent public \n10 meeting Defendants’ declarant Kelli Weaver admitted that such training would not even start until \n11 November 2010, three months after the transition of patients begins on August 1.  Cecchetini \n12 Decl., ¶ 7.  Weaver also stated that “all County staff will be expected to be familiar with the \n13 clients in the entire work team’s caseload because clients will not be assigned to any specific \n14 County staff.”  Id.  This latter statement makes a mockery of the increased staffing ratios claimed\n15 by Defendants, and virtually assures that clients will be unable to develop trusting relationships \n16 with individual service providers, as is currently the case.\n17 D. Assuming Arguendo No Reduction in Services, Plaintiffs Will Still Suffer \nIrreparable Injury From the Disruption of Their Current Treatment.\n18\nThe County argues that “there is absolutely no evidence demonstrating that a provider \n19\nchange will lead to an increased probability of institutionalization or any other type of injury” \n20\n(Opp. at 9:13-15) and casually dismisses Plaintiffs’ showing of harm as “unsubstantiated fears” \n21\n(Opp. at 16), and “fear of change.”  Opp. at 23, 25.  These claims are incorrect, factually and \n22\nclinically.  \n23\nDefendants fail to address or rebut the testimony of Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Michael \n24\nFranczak, that mental health providers “are not interchangeable.”  Franczak Decl. (Dkt. No. 32), \n25\n¶15.  In his supplemental declaration, Dr. Franczak expands on the damaging impact of the loss \n26\nof provider continuity, citing extensive research on the better outcomes and lower treatment costs \n27\nwhen clients have long-term relationships with their mental health providers.  Supp. Franczak \n28\n5.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 99   Filed 07/14/10   Page 8 of 17\n1 Decl., ¶¶4-9.  The converse is also true:  outcomes are worse when there is no therapeutic bond \n2 or alliance with the provider, or when this bond is broken.  Id.  Extensive research confirms the \n3 importance of continuity of care and long-term treatment relationships.  Id.\n4 Second, the clients affected by the closure of the RSTs and TCORE are acutely mentally \n5 ill and are at great risk of self-harm or harm to others when their fears and anxiety escalate, even \n6 if County officials deem these “unsubstantiated.”  For example, Plaintiff Eichhorn-Smith has had \n7 numerous suicide attempts, she views the closure of her treatment program as a major loss, and \n8 losing services will result in decompensation and risk of self-harm or institutionalization.  \n9 Eichhorn-Smith Decl. (Dkt. No. 30), ¶¶ 5, 12; Supp. Cline Decl. ¶ 1.\n10 Defendant Ann Edwards-Buckley, the County’s Director of Health and Human Services \n11 (“DHHS”), candidly acknowledges that as a result of the transition process, clients may \n12 experience “increased acuity,” which means that they “may have an increase in their symptoms, \n13 whatever those symptoms may be; depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, psychotic \n14 symptoms”; that “it would be a good idea for the County to plan” for this increase; and that she is \n15 unaware of any plans by the County to deal with increased client acuity.  Supp. Branick-Abilla \n16 Decl., Ex. D (Deposition of Ann Edwards-Buckley) (“Edwards-Buckley Depo.”), at 82:18-83:12.  \n17 Dr. Franczak concludes that the County’s failure to plan for increased acuity from the transition is \n18 “extremely cavalier and even dangerous to affected clients.”  Supp. Franczak Decl., ¶16.\n19 III. DEFENDANTS HAVE  FAILED  TO  REBUT  PLAINTIFFS’ STRONG  SHOWING  OF \nLIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THEIR LEGAL CLAIMS.6\n20\nA. Defendants’  Evidence  Confirms  That  Their  Planned  Reductions  Will \n21 Violate the ADA.  \n22 Plaintiffs’ ADA claims arise from the likelihood that the reduction in, and disruption of, \n23 essential mental health services will create an extreme risk of institutionalization to clients who \n24 ___________________________________\n6Plaintiffs also raised claims under the Medicaid Act and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  Pl. Br. at \n25\n18-22.  Plaintiffs do not revisit these claims in this brief because of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, and \nbecause they turn on the same factual showing as Plaintiffs’ ADA claims.  The core element of the Medicaid claims \n26\nis the denial of medically necessary services, which in turn leads to the risk of institutionalization. Similarly, the \nvalidity of the due process claim is premised on the existence of a reduction in services.  If Plaintiffs prevail on \n27\ntheir ADA claims, they are also likely to prevail on these additional claims. \n28\n6.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 99   Filed 07/14/10   Page 9 of 17\n1 are able to remain safely in the community only with these services.  Pl. Br. at 15-16.  Distilled to \n2 its essence, Defendants’ response is that because their “hybrid plan” differs in minor details from \n3 earlier concepts, Plaintiffs have shown “no nexus between the Hybrid Plan and the potential for \n4 institutionalization.”  Opp. at 16:13-14.  This ignores the many declarations already in the record \n5 regarding fundamental consequences of Defendants’ decision to disrupt a well-functioning \n6 system that provides cost-effective treatment to thousands of fragile individuals with mental \n7 illness.  Because the “hybrid plan,” like its precursors, will result in 5,000 people losing their \n8 trusted mental health providers and facing transfer to a program that is not as well staffed, it is \n9 inevitable that many clients will decompensate and require hospitalization and placement in a \n10 locked facility.  Even with the best transition plan, some clients will go into crisis and needlessly \n11 end up in institutions when they could have remained safely in the community with their current \n12 providers.7  \n13 Plaintiffs also argued that, if the County is permitted to proceed with these cuts, the ADA \n14 nonetheless requires it to provide an adequate transition plan, and that the transition plan proposed \n15 by the County would not ensure that Plaintiffs are able to transfer successfully to the new system. \n16 Pl. Br. at 17.  The County counters that the transition efforts criticized in the Complaint and \n17 opening brief are inapplicable to its new “hybrid plan.”  Opp. at 16.  Other than allowing a slightly \n18 longer period of time, transition plan described in the “hybrid plan” still omits all the elements \n19 deemed necessary by clients, providers and experts.  \n20 According to Plaintiffs’ experts, Dr. Franczak and Dr. Stoneking, the County’s plan, \n21 which is little more than a plan to transfer clinical records and a group appointment with the new \n22 team, is inadequate to ensure continuity of care and fails to meet nationally recognized standards \n23 for a safe or successful transition for this extremely vulnerable population.  Supp. Franczak Decl., \n24 ¶¶ 20-23.  The County’s proposal is silent as to essential components of adequate transition \n___________________________________\n25 7As Dr. Franczak’s supplemental declaration shows, clients with severe mental illnessshould not be deliberately \nsubjected to the loss of a provider because discontinuity of care has negative effects on clients.  See Supp. Franczak \n26\nDecl., ¶¶ 4-9 & Ex. A (Green article) at 15 (“high clinician turnover . . . may negatively affect patients”).  Even \nDefendant Edwards-Buckley admitted that, all other things being equal and assuming a good relationship with \n27\none’s provider, one would not choose to change providers.  Edwards-Buckley Depo. at 94:18-25.  \n28\n7.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 99   Filed 07/14/10   Page 10 of 17\n1 planning, including consideration of all aspects of the individual’s needs across service systems, \n2 collaboration among service providers, responsiveness to “special populations” such as those with \n3 co-occurring disorders, plans to address relapses, and monitoring outcomes.  Id., ¶ 22.  The plan to \n4 transfer hundreds of individuals per week does not allow for the high probability of broken \n5 appointments and some individuals’ need for a lengthier transition period than the 10 days \n6 contemplated by the County.  Id., ¶ 21; see also Second Supp. Stoneking Decl., ¶ 13.  Dr. \n7 Stoneking concludes that it is “troubling” that the County “believes it can transfer most patients \n8 with simply a phone call from the new provider.”  Second Supp. Stoneking Decl., ¶ 13.  In Dr. \n9 Franczak’s opinion, a properly-planned transition would require a minimum of six months.  Supp. \n10 Franczak Decl., ¶ 22.  Dr. Stoneking notes that when the RSTs were created in 1993, the transition \n11 took place over a period of over 16 months.  Second Supp. Stoneking Decl., ¶ 5.\n12 The proposed transition plan is also largely incomplete, even at this late date.  Dr. \n13 Stoneking observed that “the ‘redesigned’ system was, at best, half-baked when it was approved \n14 by the Board of Supervisors in June 2010, with many critical details totally missing from the \n15 proposal document submitted to the Board, and yet to be worked out.”  Id., ¶ 8.  \n16 The deposition testimony of Ms. Edwards-Buckley and Ms. Bennett confirm the \n17 shockingly haphazard nature of the County’s transition planning, and the continuing lack of plans \n18 critical to a successful transition.  Neither of the top two County officials responsible for the \n19 system redesign appears to know anything about a myriad of planning and process steps that are \n20 essential to a successful transition.  Ms. Edwards-Buckley repeatedly stated that Ms. Bennett \n21 would be the person to ask about such details, but Ms. Bennett repeatedly testified that she was \n22 unaware of them.  For example, she did not know about what instructions their “phone bank” staff \n23 are being given for dealing with client calls  (Bennett Depo. at 91:17-92:3); whether clinicians \n24 have been trained to follow up on questions raised by those calls (id. at 92:12-19); whether the \n25 phone bank staff will even attempt to contact all consumers (id. at 94:4-6); whether any patient \n26 records have yet changed hands (id. at 96:25-97:1); what plan, if any, is in place to follow up with \n27\n28\n8.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 99   Filed 07/14/10   Page 11 of 17\n1 clients who fail to show up for appointments8 with the new County providers (id. at 106:14-18, \n2 107:11-15; see also Edwards-Buckley Depo. at 81:3-24); whether the new County clinics will \n3 provide for “drop-in” appointments”9 (Bennett Depo. at 119:18-20); what the plan is for serving \n4 consumers who are in crisis10 (Id. at 120:8-14); what will happen at the new clinics when clients \n5 need services after regular business hours, i.e. in the evenings or on weekends11 (id. at 130:9-20; \n6 see also Edwards-Buckley Depo. at 65:1-14); whether any of the County staff coming over from \n7 other locations have experience withthe “recovery model” (Bennett Depo. at 134:12-14); or \n8 whether the training module for incoming staff is even complete (id. at 138:13-21).  The only \n9 conclusion to be drawn from this remarkable testimony is that, at best, the County simply has not \n10 thought through many important service issues, and at worst, there simply will be no such services \n11 (such as after-hours crisis services).  \n12 Moreover, in the opinion of Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Beth Stoneking, the transition plans that \n13 Defendants have announced are woefully inadequate.  Callers to County phone lines have already \n14 received inadequate information leading to stress and anxiety (Zykofsky Dec. (Dkt. No. 89) at 10; \n15 Second Supp. Stoneking Decl., ¶ 8); it appears that “only [clients] who complain or visibly \n16 decompensate will receive any attention from the County,” while many who experience stress less \n17 overtly will not be attended to.  Second Supp. Stoneking Decl., ¶ 9.  Dr. Stoneking opines that the \n18 notion that clients can be transitioned without intake appointments “reflects a disregard for \n19 appropriate standards of care” because an involuntary transfer creates issues that only an interview \n20 can reveal.  Id., ¶13. \n21 Defendants attempt to trivialize Plaintiffs’ concerns regarding transition, claiming that this \n___________________________________\n22 8In contrast, RSTs have established procedures to ensure that clients attend their appointments, and to follow up with \nany clients that fail to show.  See, e.g., Supp. Buck Decl., ¶ 5\n23\n9RSTs, on the other hand, offer flexible hours and drop-in groups and clinics.  See, e.g., Supp Bolte Decl., ¶ 11.\n24\n10In contrast, RST staff are prepared to work with clients in crisis, regardless of where they are or what time it is, for \n25\nas long as it takes to stabilize the clients.  Id., ¶ 8.  \n26 11  RST staff understand that their hours are dictated by the needs of their clients.  As Alexan Bolte explained, \n“Providing service under the recovery model means you meet the needs of your client where the client is at the time \n27\nduring the week or weekend.”  Id., ¶ 8.\n28\n9.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 99   Filed 07/14/10   Page 12 of 17\n1 merely a veiled attempt  to preserve the present system “in perpetuity.”  Opp. at 18.  There is a \n2 world of difference between preserving the present system untouched (which Plaintiffs do not seek \n3 to do), and blowing up a well-functioning “life support” systemon which 5,000 severely ill \n4 individuals depend.  Plaintiffs would never dispute that the County can make changes in the \n5 system, terminate contractors based on poor productivity or quality concerns, or develop new \n6 systems based on increased efficiencies and treatment modalities.  However, the County fails to \n7 acknowledge how drastic and unprecedented a change it is proposing.12  \n8 New and striking evidence supporting Plaintiffs’ ADA claim comes, surprisingly, from \n9 the County’s own opposition.  As part of its “hybrid plan,” Sacramento is actually increasing its \n10 spending on locked, institutional mental health care by 13.6%.13  Defendants’ declarations are \n11 also replete with admissions that they have deliberately redirected the entire budget for the \n12 regional support teams – $4.5 million – to support salary increases and other costs in the County-\n13 run Mental Health Treatment Center (“MHTC”), a locked inpatient facility, and a locked 12 bed \n14 psychiatric health facility.14  Every county in California is facing a fiscal crisis, but only \n15 Sacramento has chosen to increase costly institutional care.  Dahlquist Decl., ¶ 7.  County \n16 ___________________________________\n12County staff point to their past experiences transitioning other clients to new providers and delivery systems.  \n17\nZykofsky Decl. (Dkt. No. 89) at 5.  Neither of the two examples cited are comparable for several reasons.  First, the \ntwo earlier transitions were necessary to improve client services.  Here, the Countyhas no complaint about the \n18\nquality or efficacy of the services provided by the RSTs and TCORE-HRC.  Edwards-Buckley Depo. at 74:8-75:2; \nBennett Depo. at 74:8-19.  In fact, it hopes to provide the same services through the re-design.  Bd. Memo at 9-10.  \n19\nSecond, the scale of this proposed transfer is unmanageable, according to national experts familiar with mental \nhealth systems.  In Arizona, when a mental health managed care plan comparable to that operated by Sacramento \n20\nwent into bankruptcy and collapsed, government officials wisely decided not to disturb any clinical relationships, \nand changed administrative staff instead.  Supp. Franczak Decl., ¶ 3. \n21\n13Of the County’s $75.6 million Adult Mental Health 2010-11 budget, $38.3 million is allocated for institutional or \n22\ninpatient care –a $4.5 million or 13.6% increase from the previous year.  King Decl. (Dkt. No. 85) at 1:27-28; \n1:25-26.   Contrast this to the budget of $37.3 million for outpatient services, which includes a decrease from last \n23\nyear’s allocationof $18.6 million for the Adult Mental Health Outpatient program to $12.1 million this year –an \napproximately $6.5 million slash, over one-third of the budget.  See id.\n24\n14“DHHS decided to utilize the realignment funds for acute, sub-acute, Psychiatric Health Facility (PHF) and \n25\nSMHTC beds.”  Bennett Decl. (Dkt. No. 99) at 2:22-23; “[R]ealignment funds, which have historically been used \nto fund the contractor-operated component of the Adult Outpatient Services, were no longer available for the \n26\nRSTs”; realignment funds are depleted due to declining revenue, reimbursement of transfer funds and “increased \ncompensation and benefits for County employees” working at the MHTC.  Kennedy Decl. (Dkt. No. 92) at 2:23-25; \n27\n2:22; see alsoBennett Depo. at 32:23-33:13 (realignment funds were moved from the RSTs to the MHTC).\n28\n10.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 99   Filed 07/14/10   Page 13 of 17\n1 officials claimed that this heightened spending was necessitated by increased demand, but one \n2 expert observes:\n3 Many other counties satisfy their obligations under their Medi-Cal managed care \nwithout operating a locked inpatient facility of their own, as Sacramento does.  \n4 In fact, twenty five California counties do not have any inpatient psychiatric \nservices at all. . . . [O]ther counties . . . have developed and utilized crisis \n5 residential programs as alternatives to hospital-based acute care.\n6 Id., ¶ 12.  \n7 This expert notes that Sacramento also has the second-highest rate of involuntary \n8 detentions in the state, an “extremely high rate” that is more than twice the state average and “is \n9 associated with the fact that the County lacks capacity in its community-based services so that it \n10 can only channel clients to [its locked inpatient facility] rather than use the alternatives that many \n11 other counties offer.”  Id., ¶14.  Defendants claim these decisions are discretionary (Opp. at 11, \n12 13), but under the ADA, a public entity “cannot amend optional programs in a way so as to \n13 violate the integration mandate.”  Fisher v. Okla. Health Care Auth., 335 F.3d 1175, 1182(10th \n14 Cir. 2003). \n15 Defendants further admit that they have failed to pursue alternatives for funding the \n16 current adult outpatient program using MHSA monies (Bennett Decl. (Dkt. No. 88) at 2:15-21) as \n17 well as failing to consider reconfiguration of the MHTC into smaller facilities which would draw \n18 down millions in federally matched Medicaid dollars.  Dahlquist Decl., ¶ 15.  Such failure to \n19 consider alternatives that preserve community care and conform with the ADA’s integration \n20 mandate are actionable.  See Pa. Prot. & Advocacy, Inc. v. Pa. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 402 F. 3d \n21 374, 380 (3d Cir. 2004) (finding that state’s budgetary constraints defense alone was inadequate \n22 and scrutinizing factors including state efforts to procure funding for community services, \n23 evidence that the state responsibly spent its budgetary allocations, and trends showing decreased \n24 reliance on institutional beds and increases in community services); Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d \n25 1051, 1067 (9th Cir. 2005) (upholding state fundamental alteration defense where state showed \n26 196% increase in funding for community options, actual increase in community services and \n27 decrease in reliance on institutional beds over 10 year period). \n28\n11.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 99   Filed 07/14/10   Page 14 of 17\n1 B. Plaintiffs’ Motion is Not Moot. \n2 Defendants claim that the Court ispowerless to grant relief because the motion is “based \n3 upon a service delivery model that was never implemented by the County.”  (Opp. at 11:20-21.)15  \n4 As an initial matter, this assertion is factually incorrect because the County plan is virtually \n5 indistinguishable from the “County Proposal” outlined at a public meeting on April 1, 2010.16  \n6 More fundamentally, however, the relief sought is not dependent on the precise contours of the \n7 plan adopted by the County.  Rather, Plaintiffs seek an order enjoining the Defendants from \n8 “terminating or reducing” the funding for the existing outpatient programs, or making reductions \n9 in medically necessary services, “unless and until the Court has determined” that, among other \n10 things, Plaintiffs “will continue to receive these . . . services in the most integrated setting \n11 possible . . . .” [Proposed] Order (Dkt. No. 52), ¶ 2(a).  As it is uncontested that Defendants are \n12 terminating the existing programs (see, e.g., Opp. at 1:6-8), the County must demonstrate that its \n13 proposed replacement system complies with the ADA’s integration mandate and protects \n14 Plaintiffs’ other rights.  \n15 C. The  Court  Has  Authority  to  Enjoin  Action  That  Violates  Plaintiffs’ \nFundamental Rights.\n16\nDefendants next argue that the Court is powerless to enjoin violations of Plaintiffs’ rights \n17\nwhere an injunction would require the County to enter into new contracts with existing provider \n18\ncontracts.  This frivolous argument simply wishes away the long-established role of the judiciary \n19\nin evaluating states’ resource allocations pursuant to the three-part test set forth in Olmstead v. L. \n20\nC. ex rel Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 607 (1999) (states are required to provide community-based \n21\ntreatment where, among other things, “the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking \n22\n___________________________________\n23 15Defendants also criticize the timing of the motion, but that was necessitated by the timing of the County’s actions.  \nThe County informed Plaintiffs that it intended to start transitioning clients (patients) to its new system on July 1, \n24\n2010, but that the Board would not even consider, much less approve, the new system until mid-June; at the same \ntime, the County opposed Plaintiffs’ request to consider this motion at the earliest possible time.  See Dkt. No. 59.  \n25\nThis left Plaintiffs with no choice but to file the motion for preliminary injunction prior to the Board’s action.\n26 16The County stated at this time that it intended to “[e]xpand the County-operated TCORE-APSS program”, “staff \nthe County Clinics with . . . staff identified for termination”, and create County clinics “in facilities where the \n27\ncounty currently has vacant leased space.”  SeeBranick-Abilla Decl. (Dkt. No. 19), Ex. F, Attachment B at 2.\n28\n12.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 99   Filed 07/14/10   Page 15 of 17\n1 into account the resources available to the State . . . .”).  Not surprisingly, this argument is not \n2 supported by a single case under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  Its sole support is a pair of \n3 non-ADA municipal contract cases in which California courts rejected challenges by losing \n4 bidders, on the basis that courts should ordinarily “declin[e] to inquire into legislative thought \n5 processes or motives.”  Mike Moore’s 24-Hour Towing v. City of San Diego, 45 Cal. App. 4th \n6 1294, 1305 (1996) (citations omitted).  The instant case, however, does not require a re-\n7 examination of legislative motivations; the Court can, and should, grant injunctive relief for the \n8 simple reason that the County’s proposed redesign violates the Olmstead mandate.  \n9 D. This Controversy is Justiciable.\n10 Plaintiffs have standing to seek the requested injunctive relief.  A plaintiff seeking a \n11 preliminary injunction must show that “he is under threat of suffering an ‘injury in fact’ that is \n12 concrete and particularized; the threat must be actual and imminent, not conjectural or \n13 hypothetical; it must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and it must be \n14 likely that a favorable judicial decision will prevent or redress the injury.”  Summers v. Earth \n15 Island Institute, 129 S. Ct. 1142, 1149 (2009); Nelson v. Nat’l Aeronautics & Space Admin., 530 \n16 F.3d 865, 873 (9th Cir. 2008).  A plaintiff can show standing by presenting evidence in the form \n17 of verified complaints, declarations, or affidavits that establish the likelihood that he will suffer \n18 injury as a result of the conduct sought to be enjoined.  See, e.g. Summers, 129 S. Ct. at 1149-\n19 1150 (affidavits used to decide question of standing for preliminary injunction).  \n20 Here, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs lack standing because their complaint and \n21 declarations were prepared prior to submission of the so-called “hybrid plan.”  (Opp. at 14:26-\n22 15:8.)  In making such an argument, Defendants seek to sweep under the rug all of their prior \n23 actions that necessitated the filing of the preliminary injunction motion in the first place.  The \n24 declarations are accurate and highly relevant evidence of the disorder, confusion and poor \n25 planning that have characterized Defendants’ actions since they announced in April 2010 that \n26 they were closing most of the adult outpatient mental health programs.  Those issues did not \n27 simply disappear on June 17, 2010 when the Board adopted the County’s so-called “hybrid plan.”  \n28 Plaintiffs and other class members faced – and continue to face – real threat of injury due to an \n13.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 99   Filed 07/14/10   Page 16 of 17\n1 impending reduction in medically necessary mental health services as a result of the County’s \n2 actions.  Defendants’ standing argument is therefore baseless.\n3 IV. GIVEN  DEFENDANTS’ FAILURE  TO  IDENTIFY  A  JUSTIFICATION FOR  DISRUPTING \nMEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT TO 5,000VULNERABLE CLIENTS,THE PUBLIC \n4 INTEREST AND THE BALANCE OF EQUITIES TIP SHARPLY IN PLAINTIFFS’FAVOR.\n5 Under Winter, plaintiffs must also show that the balance of equities tips sharply in their \n6 favor.  129 S. Ct. at 374.  Plaintiffs have already made this showing with evidence that preserving \n7 the current system will save public funds, since the outpatient services provided by private \n8 contractors are far more cost-effective than those provided by county employees or in locked  \n9 institutions.  Pl. Br. at 24.  \n10 The County’s Opposition is surprising, for it offers no pressing reason for changing its \n11 entire delivery system and disrupting medically necessary mental health care to 5,000 people.  \n12 The County simply asserts its “legislative discretion” to make any change it chooses.  Opp. at 14.  \n13 Initially, the County cited its budget crisis (Opp. at 2), but later claimed that there will be no \n14 reduction in funding because it has “found” additional funds.17 Opp. at 2-3; Bd. Memo at 3.  The \n15 most consistent justifications cited by County officials for closing the RSTs have been the County \n16 Charter provision known as “Section 71-J” that protects public employees from layoffs, and other \n17 civil service protections.  See, e.g., Branick-Abilla Decl. (Dkt. No. 19), Ex. F at 2-3 & \n18 Attachment B (4/1/10 Meeting Minutes).  At public meetings, County officials stated that point of \n19 the “redesign” was to save the jobs of forty County employees scheduled for layoffs, but who will \n20 now be transferred to positions in the new County clinics.18  Similarly, the County is transferring \n21 $4 million from the RSTs to cover increased costs of raises and salary increases for DHHS staff.  \n22 Bd. Memo at 3.  The County could secure inpatient services more cheaply from private \n23 contractors but claims it cannot do so because of Section 71-J and civil service protections for the \n___________________________________\n24 17The County’s “new funds” are from the MHSA, andit originally claimed that prohibitions against supplantation of \nfunds prevented the use of MHSA funds to support the RSTs.  Bd. Memo at 7.  However, in her deposition, the \n25\nDHHS Director reversed her position, conceding that the County could have requested MHSA funding to maintain \nthe RSTs and TCORE but decided against it.  Edwards-Buckley Depo. at 98:7-22.  Thus, the DHHS director \n26\nconfirmed that restrictions on the use of MHSA funds are not a justification for defunding the RSTs. \n27 18Branick-Abilla Decl. (Dkt. No. 19), Ex. F at 2-3 & Attachment B (4/1/10 Meeting Minutes).\n28\n14.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 99   Filed 07/14/10   Page 17 of 17\n1 county employees at the MHTC.  See Edwards-Buckley Depo. at 28:7-14.  However, when it \n2 comes to arguing its case before this Court, the County’s Opposition is silent as to Section 71-J, \n3 leaving it with no justification at all. \n4 The County also argues that an injunction preventing termination of funding for the RSTs \n5 will require it to reduce services in other, equally essential areas.  Opp. at 24.  To the contrary, the \n6 funds already allocated by the County to fund a transition to the new system ($2.9 million) will \n7 largely cover the short-term costs of an injunction.  If the County then proceeds to seek MHSA \n8 funds to continue the RSTs, as many have suggested, it will be in the same situation as it is now \n9 but without the need to pay for a costly transfer process , and no risk of needless harm to clients. \n10 Since the County offers no compelling justification for its decision to terminate funding to \n11 the mental health providers on which 5,000 individuals have relied, and since these services are \n12 also more cost-effective and less costly than services provided by County employees, especially \n13 in the County’s inpatient facilities, the balance of equities tips sharply in Plaintiffs’ favor, and the \n14 public interest favors issuance of an injunction. \n15 V. CONCLUSION\n16 In the words of Dr. Franczak, the County’s plan “will reduce available funding by at least \n17 30%, decrease staffing capability, fails to account for the probability of higher acuity and crises of \n18 affected participants, and contains wholly inadequate transition planning.  The result of this folly \n19 will be irreparable harm to individuals in the form of clinical regression, increased hospitalization \n20 and institutionalization, injury, illness, and death.”  Supp. Franczak Decl., ¶ 27.

The County is implementing a \nSystem that is different than that alleged in either the unamended Complaint or the \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction.  The requested preliminary injunction requires the \nCourt to leapfrog to a conclusion for which no evidentiary basis exists. \nII. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  Previous System \nUnder the previous System, the County provided outpatient mental health services \nl \npreviously through four (4) RSTs and other contractor-operated programs. The services \nprovided by these RSTS 'were not necessarily provided in the same manner.  There were \ntwo important areas of differences.  First, there were differences in staffing patterns \nacross the RSTs.  Second, the staffing differences resulted in differences in how services \nwere delivered. (Zykofsky Decl.) \nFor example, some RSTs gave medication appointments, while others had more \ndrop in appointments.  EI Hogar historically did more outreach and in-home services. \nI The existing four (4) RST programs are: El Hogar RST, Visions Unlimited RST, Turning Point Northgate Point \nRST, Human Resource Consultants (HRC) RST. The five (5) additional providers of outpatient services are; HRC \nT-CORE, Consumer Self Help Wellness Recovery Centers (North & South sites) (WRC), and the County-operated \nT-CORE Adult Psychiatric Support Services (APSS), and T-CORE APSS Aftercare. \n-1-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 7 of 30\n1  Northgate Point had more involvement of its medical staff in directing services on its \n2  multidisciplinary approach.  Some RSTs, such as Visions, historically utilized more \n3  clinical licensed staff than did HRC, whose staffing was built around consumer employee \n4  staff and paraprofessional staff. (Zykofsky Decl.)  The RSTs utilized Personal Services \n5  Coordinators (PSCs) who were, in some cases, \"peers\" (consumer employees), \n6  unlicensed staff with life experience involving mental health issue, or paraprofessional \n7  staff providing direct services based on a variety of work experiences.2 (Zykofsky Decl.) \n8  B.  County's Hybrid Plan as Adopted by Board of Supervisors \n9  The County was facing a $180 million budget shortfall for fiscal year 2010-11, a \n10  portion of which was attributable to the Division of Behavioral Health Services (BHS). \n11  Accordingly, BHS began looking at re-allocation of limited resources among its mental \n12  health programs. (Bennett Decl.) \n13  Realignment funds which had historically funded the RSTs were transferred to the \n14  inpatient components of the County's mental health system to accommodate shortages \n15  and pent-up community demand for inpatient beds. (Bennett, King Decls.)  Utilizing \n16  revenues from the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), the County recommended, and \n17  the Board of Supervisors approved on June 17,2010, a restructured System. (Bennett \n18  Decl.) \n19  The use of MHSA funding allowed the County to develop a restructured System \n20  that continues the same menu and level of services.  (Bennett, Kennedy, King, Zykofsky \n21  Decls.)  In fiscal year 2009-10, the Adult Mental Health Outpatient program, excluding \n22  the Full Service Partnership (FSP) program had budgeted expenditures totaling $18.6 \n23  million ($8.7 million for RSTs, $2.3 million for WRC, and $7.6 million for \n24  APSS/A  ftercare and HRC TCORE).  In fiscal year 2010-11, the budgeted expenditure~ \n25  total $15.1 million ($11.3 million for the Sacramento Wellness Centers, $.9 million for \n26 \n27 \n2 In the Mental Health Plan (MHP), unlicensed staff, whether they are consumer employees or paraprofessionals, \n28 \nwork under the direction of licensed staff regarding the delivery of direct mental health service. \n-2-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 8 of 30\n1  WRC, and the $2.9 million in transition funding).  Upon approval by the State after a \n2  community process, the budgeted amount will include another $2.5 million in additional \n3  MHSA funding for HRC TCORE which will make the budgeted amount for 2010-11 \n4  $17.6 million.  It is anticipated that, based on HRC TCORE plan, an additional $1.0 \n5  million in FFP will be realized for a total 2010-11 budgeted amount of$18.6.  This \n6  amount is equal to the amount budgeted for 2009-10. (King Decl.) \n7  Under the restructured System, four (4) County-operated Sacramento Wellness \n8  Centers will replace the four (4) contractor-operated RSTs.  In addition, contracted peer \n9  services that are both clinic and community-based will be used.  Thus, the Board of \n10  Supervisors approved a blended system of services (Hybrid Plan). (Zykofsky, Weaver, \n11  Kennedy Decls.) \n12  Under the Hybrid Plan, the County will provide integrated recovery-focused \n13  services at Sacramento Wellness Centers in partnership with the WRC and HRC/TCORE. \n14  The Wellness Centers, which are largely funded with MHSA dollars, are designed to \n15  comply with the five essential elements of the MHSA: community collaboration, cultural \n16  competence, client driven services, wellness focus and integrated services.  The Hybrid \n17  Plan will offer the same menu and level of services that the County previously offered to \n18  these beneficiaries; it will offer the same level that is documented in the consumer's care \n19  plan. (Zykofsky Decl.) \n20  The Sacramento Wellness Centers are located in facilities that are near the existing \n21  RSTs.  They will be located at the following sites:  1) 3815 Marconi Avenue;3 2) 3950 \n22  Research Drive;4 3) 7171 Bowling Drive;5 and 4) 2130/2140 Stockton Boulevard.6  The \n23  Sacramento Wellness Centers are located along bus lines or light rail stations.  Consumer \n24 \n25  3 The Marconi Avenue site is l.27 miles from HRC.  (Weaver Decl.) \n26  4 The Research Drive site is 2.15 miles from NGP and 7.46 miles from EI Hogar.  (Weaver Decl) \n27  5 The Bowling Drive site is .57 miles from Visions-South and 20.03 from Visions-Galt.  (Weaver Decl.) \n28  6 The Stockton Boulevard site is 5.13 miles from EI Hogar.

(Weaver Decl.) \n4  HRC-TCORE will be co-located at the Wellness Centers and will provide \n5  community-based peer support, assessment and rehabilitation services.  WRC will \n6  provide site-based services at the Wellness Centers, utilizing peer mentors who will \n7 \n7  provide individual and group supports. The HRC-TCORE drop-in services will continue \n8  to be offered at the existing Marconi location.  The County will co-locate at that site and \n9  will bring in a clinical piece to provide a full array of services. \n10  The Sacramento Wellness Centers will consist of support teams composed of \n11  members of blended County and contractor staff.  The teams will consist of both \n12  clinicians and peer specialists.  The RSTs used both a medical model and a recovery \n13  model.  The Sacramento Wellness Centers will do the same. (Zykofsky Decl.) \n14  The County's System is committed to the recovery model which the County \n15  previously required its contractor providers to implement.  The Wellness Centers will use \n16  a multidisciplinary team approach that includes psychiatrists, nurses, licensed clinical \n17  staff, master-level clinical staff, mental health workers and peer support staff.  Services \n18  will include comprehensive assessment, crisis intervention, service coordination, \n19  individual and group services (educational and therapeutic), benefit acquisition, \n20  vocational supports, medication support and education, co-occurring substance use/abuse \n21  services, peer support services (individual and group), health care linkage, field-based \n22  service including in-home assessments and rehabilitation services, community self-help \n23  referrals and family interventions and supports. (Weaver, Kennedy, Zykofsky Decls.) \n24  There will be a total of 67.6 FTE County employees assigned to the Sacramento \n25  Wellness Centers.  County staff assigned to the Wellness Centers have language \n26 \n27 \n7 Under the contractor-operated system, the WRC offered peer-run drop-in support.  It also had a medication \ncomponent that the County will be assuming under the Hybrid Plan.

In addition, there will be at least 15 contracted psychiatrists. \n10 \n4  (Kennedy, Weaver, Hales Decls.)  The County-staffed component of the Wellness \n5  Centers will rely upon licensed and unlicensed Master level mental health professionals, \n6  as well as nurses and mental health workers who have worked either at the Adult \n7  ACCESS Team, APSS clinic, APSS Aftercare Clinic, children's mental health services \n8  and/or SMHTC.  They have a wide variety of experience in working with the seriously \n9  mentally ill in Sacramento. (Zykofsky Decl.) \n10  Staff assigned to the Wellness Centers will also be provided training in a range of \n11  areas, including but not limited to MHSA principles and philosophy; Wellness, Recovery \n12  and Resiliency; Cultural Competence; Integrated Service Provision; and Documentation \n13  standards.  Just as with the rest of the service provider system, Wellness Center staff \nII \n14  will receive training to continuously build core skills for direct services staff in all these \n15  areas. (Zykofsky Decl.) \n16 \n17 \n18  8 The County staff assigned to the Wellness Centers has the following language capabilities:  French, Spanish, \nTrianya, Indian/Pakistan dialects, Tagalog, Cubuano, Philippino dialect, Creole African Dialect, Mandarin, \nVietnamese, Taiwanese and Hmong.  In addition, the contracted staff working at the Wellness Centers have the \n19 \nfollowing language capabilities:  Russian, Spanish, Japanese, Laos, Thai and Hmong.  To the extent that there is a \nlanguage need that is not available from staff, the Wellness Centers will utilize the Assisted Access services, which \n20 \nis what the RSTs currently also utilize.  (Zykofsky Decl.) \n21 \n9 Some have worked in the County system and some have worked at the RSTs and/or other community providers \nand bring additional experience with adult clients.  All have exposure and understanding of mental health issues and \n22  challenges. The staff is coming directly from mental health services programs, not from parts of the County in which \ntheir work did not involve any mental health services. They are coming from positions in which treatment has been \n23  provided; they have been seeing and serving mentally ill consumers and their families.  (Zykofsky Dec\\.) \n24  10 Sixteen psychiatrists in the community have signed, or are in the process of signing, personal services contracts \nwith the Comity of Sacramento to provide clinical services at the new Wellness Centers.  Three of the four current \nmedical directors at the RSTs will gradually transition their services from the RSTs to the Wellness Centers, with \n25 \none becoming medical director at the Wellness Center located on Marconi Avenue.  The fourth medical director, a \npsychiatrist-family physician, will be providing both medical and psychiatric services at a new county-operated \n26 \nFederally Qualified Health Center (FQHC).  (Hales Dec\\.) \n27 \n11 Input was sought and received from community partners in development and delivery of this training.  (Zykofsky \nDec\\.) \n28 \n-5-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 11 of 30\n1  There will also be 34 contracted case managers, 12 contracted peer mentors, 5 \n2  peer partners and a psychologists and Post doctoral contracted.  Peer mentors will be \n3  providing services at each Sacramento Wellness Center via a contract with HRC/TCORE. \n4  There will be 4 peer mentors per site, for a total of 12 peer mentors at three sites.  The \n5  fourth site will have peer services provided by 5 Peer partners from another contract.  The \n6  peer mentors will not carry a caseload, but will focus on services designed to strengthen \n7  consumer independence and community engagement and connection, such as group \n8  therapy. (Kennedy Decl.) \n9  There will be four teams per Wellness Center, each team serving between 250-375 \n10  consumers.  This assumes a capacity of 1500 clients per We1.lness Center. 12  The staff to \n11  consumer ratio at the Wellness Centers (which consists of nine consolidated programs) \n13 \n12  will be a range of approximately 1: 75 to 1: 90. (Weaver Decl.)  In contrast, the staffing \n13  ratio at the RSTs was 1 :70 (if based only on their open active caseloads) or 1 :75 (if based \n14  on contract requirements).  The difference is that the RST staffing ratios do not include \nl \nI  15  the full gamut of clients who will be served at the Wellness Center and who are included \n1I   16  in the County's 1: 70 ratio. (Weaver Decl.)  The ratios for the RSTs and the Wellness \nI \nI \n17  Centers are not comparable because they will be comprised of different consumer \nI \n18  populations. \n19  C.  County's Transition Plan \ni \n20  The County's previous contracts with the RSTs expired on June 30, 2010, by their \n1-\nI \n21  own terms. (Bennett Decl.)  The County is contracting with the RSTs for a four month \nI \n22  period.  In July, funding and services will remain the same as under the previous \nI \nI \n23 \n24 \n12 Unlike the RSTs which had a capacity of 900 (which was not actually fully realized), the capacity of the Wellness \n25  Centers include the RST consumers, the consumers using the peer support services ofWRC, the APSS/Aftercare \nClinic, and medication-only services.  (Weaver Dec!.) \n26 \n13 This staff to consumer ratio is different than that which was identified in the Board of Supervisors staff report \nbecause, since then, the data in the A VATA  R system was further refined by both County staff and provider staff. \n27 \nThe range of 1: 75 to 1: 90 reflects serving the maximum number of consumers and assumes that 6,000 is the \nmaximum capacity.

Commencing in August, the transition of actual cases will commence. \n2  (Bennett Decl.) \n3  Approximately 4,116 clients (exclusive of APSSI Aftercare Clinic) will be \n4  transferred from the RSTs, WRC South, and HRC/TCORE commencing in August 2010. \n5  Under the County's transition plan, developed in conjunction with the RSTs \n6  approximately 90-110 clients per week will be transferred, with an anticipated \n7  completion date of September 30.  However, there will be an additional month (October) \n8  in which the transition can also occur.  These numbers contemplate the transfer of \n9  approximately one and a half caseloads per week which will enable a provider to titrate \n10  their staffing needs as they have fewer clients to serve weekly. (WeaverDecl.) \n11  The RSTs are expected to identify clients with special needs and to describe the \n12  special need, such as injectable medications, urgent care needs, housing issues, \n13  homebound and similar needs.  They are expected to coordinate the client's appointment \n14  at the Wellness Center, including phone contact and coordination of the upcoming \n15  appointment with County staff. (Weaver, Zykofsky Decls.) \n16  In order to ensure that the consumers with the most critical needs are connected to \n17  the Wellness Centers, when the County receives the RSTs' list of consumers to be \n18  transferred, it will immediately focus on contacting the identified special needs \n19  consumers.  Appointments will be set up with consumers who are monolingual. \n20  Appointments will also be established for those receiving injectables.  Phone calls to the \n21  consumers will be made to facilitate their transfer to the assigned Wellness Center. \n22  (Weaver, Zykofsky Decls.) \n23  The County has also developed a communication plan relating to the transition \n24  process.  County staffwill be available to begin the engagement process at the RSTs \n25  beginning in July and has offered to be available on site to meet with consumers and set \n26 \n27 \n28 \n-7-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 13 of 30\n1  appointments as necessary.14  Letters will also be sent to consumers with follow-up phone \n2  calls.  In addition, each of the Wellness Centers will have on-going orientation groups \n3  throughout the transition period so as to provide clients with an opportunity meet staff \n4  and tour the new facility. (Weaver, Kennedy Decls.) \n5  ITL \n6  SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n7  Plaintiffs bear a heavy burden, which they fail to meet, on their Motion for \n8  Preliminary Injunction.  They must show that: (1) they are likely to prevail on the merits, \n9  (2) without the injunction, they wi11likely suffer irreparable harm, (3) the balance of the \n10  harms favors granting the motion, and (4) the public's interest is served by granting the \nth \n11  motion.  Guzman v. Shewry, 552 F.3d 941,948 (9 Cir. 2009). \n12  Plaintiffs' action must fail in that it is based entirely upon a hypothetical house of \n13  cards, i.e. a plan that was never recommended, adopted or implemented by the County. \n14  To the contrary, the Board of Supervisors approved the Hybrid Plan which is a blend of \n15  County-operated and contractor-operated services. \n16  The Hybrid Plan contains all of the elements that Plaintiffs claim are critical to a \n17  successful service delivery model.  It provides for a transition period, a communication \n18  plan, a delivery system that includes both clinical and peer services, and notification to \n19  consumers.  Most importantly, the Hybrid Plan provides the same menu of services as \n20  that provided under the prior contractor-operated model. \n21  What it does not provide, is maintenance of a System that perpetuates the \n22  provision of services by the same RST providers.  However, there is no authority that \n23  dictates who is required to provide adult outpatient mental health services in the County. \n24  Because Plaintiffs show no chance of success on the merits, the inquiry ends and the \n25 \n26 \n27 \n14 As yet, the RSTs have not responded to this proposal.

Continental Airlines, Inc., 891 F.2d 935, 937 \n2  (9th Cir. 1987). \n3  Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief is further defective because they have not \n4  demonstrated the requisite immediate, threatened injury.  Caribbean Marine Services \n5  Co., Inc.  Aldridge 844 F.2d 668,674 (9th Cir. 1988); Mandrigues v.  World Savings Inc. \nVi \n6  2009 WL 160213 (N.D. Cal. 2009).  For an injunction to issue, the threat must be shown \n7  by probative evidence.  Bell Atlantic Business Systems, Inc. v. Storage Technology Corp. \n8  1994 WL 125173 (N.D. Cal. 1994).  Conclusory affidavits are insufficient.  American \n9  Passage Media Corp. v.  Cass Communications 950 F.2d 1470, 1473 (9th Cir. 1985). \n10  No probative evidence of an immediate, threatened injury has been submitted. \n11  Plaintiffs' declarations demonstrate only that consumers fear change. 15  However, such \n12  fears are not probative evidence of injury.  The litany of \"what ifs\" articulated by \n13  Plaintiffs is speculative and without any basis in reality.  There is absolutely no evidence \n14  demonstrating that a provider change will lead to an increased probability of \n15  institutionalization or any other type of injury.  To the contrary, the incidence of adverse \n16  incident reports this year is no greater than the previous year. (Zykofsky Decl.) \n17  Irreparable injury must be \"likely in the absence of the injunction.\" Winter v. \n18.  Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., _  U.S. _, 129 S.Ct. 365, 375 (2008) \n19  (emphasis added).  The mere \"possibility of future injury\" is not enough.  Garden v. City \n20  ofM  oreno Valley 687 F.Supp.2d 930, 937 (C.D. Cal. 2009).  Fears, insecurities and \n21 \n22 \n15 This is not the first time that there has been a transition of providers within Sacramento County.  From 1991-93, \n23  the County went through another major redesign and went from 8-9 adult outpatient providers to 3 contracted RSTs. \nAt the time, there was substantial fear and concern by consumers about this transfer.  At the time, many consumers \n24  did not want the transfer to occur, for the· same reasons as are now being expressed: fear and disruption of a working \nrelationship between the consumer and the treating professional.  However, at that time, all providers put client care \n25  as their first and foremost obligation and collaborated to make the best transfer of care possible.  It did occur. \nSimilarly, in 1997, as a result of high caseloads, the County needed to create an additional RST.  Northgate Point \nRST was created. The County transferred clients from the other three RSTs to Northgate.  Consumers again \n26 \nexpressed fears and concern~ and did not want this change.  Nevertheless, the change occurred and clients were \nsuccessfully transferred.  Client safety and care were foremost in the mind of both County and provider staff. \n27 \n(Zykofsky Decl.) \n28. \n-9-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 15 of 30\n1  loyalty to existing contractor providers do not satisfy that standard.  There must be some \n2  realistic \"threat\" or \"danger\" that the injury will occur. \n3  One case in which plaintiffs prevailed on a request for preliminary injunction is \n4  illustrative of why Plaintiffs here must fail.  In Radde v. Bonta, 357 F.3d 988 (9th Cir. \n5  2004), the County of Los Angeles had approved a plan to close the county's Rancho \n6  hospital. Id at 992.  That hospital was the only hospital in the area that provided an array \n7  of unique services to the disabled population of the county. Id at 991-992.  The court \n8  issued an injunction because the closing of Rancho was imminent and, with its closure, \n9  disabled residents of the County would have been left without any services. Id at 993. \n10  However, the injunction only barred the County from closing Rancho until it \n11  demonstrated that it proposed to provide Rancho's services elsewhere.16  Id at 994. \n12  The facts of the instant case are in stark contrast from those with which the Radde \n13  court was confronted.  Sacramento County adopted a plan that provides, at County-\n14  operated clinics, the same types of services to the same consumer population as were \n15  previously provided by the RSTs.  There is no closure or reduction of services.  There is \n16  only a relocation of the consumer population to different (but proximate) locations, with \n17  services being provided by a mix of County staff and contracted peer staff, rather than \n18  solely by contractor staff.  While the composition of the staff providing the services will \n19  differ, the restructured clinics will continue to include peer supports as well as many of \n20  the psychiatrists that were providing services at the RSTs. (Hales, Weaver, Kennedy \n21  Decls.)  The array of services will remain the same and will continue to be provided in \n22  accordance with the individual needs assessment of the consumer. (Weaver, Zykofsky \n23  Decls.) \n24 \n25 \n16 The court in Harris v. Board a/Supervisors, 366 F.3d 754 (9th Cir. 2004) reached the same conclusion, the only \ndistinction being that the Harris court grappled with a larger approved cut to services.  The court found that the \n26 \nCounty's inability to deliver medical treatment was not speculative based on the actual reduction of services on the \nscale proposed. The absence of any alternative facility made it \"fairly certain that when plaintiffs do seek those \n27 \nservices, they will not be available.\" Id. at 763.  In contrast, the County's Hybrid Plan does not reduce or eliminate \nservices, but shifts responsibility for the provision of those services to a County-operated system.  There is no \n28  evidence that the services will be unavailable, reduced or discontinued. \n-10-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 16 of 30\n1  Thus, unlike Rodde, services will continue to be available to the same population \n2  as is currently receiving those services at the RSTs.  The gist of Plaintiffs' Complaint is \n3  not that services are being eliminated, but that they are being provided directly by the \n4  County, as opposed to contractors.  There is no case authority which requires that mental \n5  health services be provided in perpetuity by the same providers at the same location. \n6  Distrust of a County-operated system and a desire to maintain relationships with existing \n7  providers do not satisfy the requirements for a preliminary injunction.  Fear of change is \n8  not an adequate basis for injunctive relief.  Given the comprehensive nature of the \n9  County's transition plan, as well as the comparability of the funding allocated to the \n10  Hybrid Plan in comparison to the funding for the RSTs last fiscal year, Plaintiffs' litany \n11  of drastic declines in mental health services and increased institutionalization is neither \n12  rational nor foreseeable \n13  Plaintiffs seek to convince this Court that it should oversee and administer the \n14  County's System by dictating what constitutes a proper transition period, who is the best \n15  provider of services, what is the best service model for the provision of such services, \n. 16  how medical charts should be transferred between providers.  These and similar issues \n17  are more properly left in the hands of the County, not the Court. \n18  IV. \n19  PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION SHOULD BE \n. DENIED BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS' COMPLAINT IS MOOT \n20 \nPlaintiffs' Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction are based upon a \n21 \nservice delivery model that was never implemented by the County.  As such, Plaintiffs \n22 \nare asking this Court to rule on a non-existent, unimplemented system.  Plaintiffs' \n23 \nComplaint and Motion are moot. \n24 \nPlaintiffs are asking the Court to rule on a proposal that was never recommended, \n25 \nsubmitted or approved by the Board of Supervisors.  Nor have Plaintiffs amended their \n26 \n27 \n28 \n-11-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 17 of 30\n1  Complaint or their Motion to address the Hybrid Plan.  As such, there is no effective \n17 \n2  relief that can be granted. \n3  A federal court has no authority to render opinions upon moot questions.  An \n4  actual case in controversy must be extant at all stages of review.  Arizonansfor Official \n5  English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 67 (1997).  A case is moot when the issues presented are \n6  no longer \"live\" or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.  Los \n7  Angeles County v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979). \n8  The central issue in any mootness challenge is whether changes in the \n9  circumstances existing when the action was filed have forestalled any meaningful relief. \n10  West v. Secretary ofD  ept. ofTransp., 206 F.3d 920,925 (9th Cir. 2000).  Without \n11  meaningful relief, any opinion as to the legality of the challenged action is advisory.  City \n12  ofE  rie v. Pap's A.M, 529 U.S. 277,287 (2000).  Federal courts have no power to render \n13  advisory opinions and should avoid being drawn into disputes that are abstract or \n14  hypothetical.  Aetna Life Ins. Co. ofH  artford, Conn. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240 \n15  (1937). \n16  Plaintiffs allege'that the County intends to cut off outpatient mental health services \n17  at the RSTs with an unformulated plan of transition.  (Complaint, Paras. 1-4, 72) \n18  Regardless of the accuracy of that allegation when it was initially made, the proposal on \n19  which Plaintiffs have premised their action is no longer on the table.  It was never even \n20  recommended or submitted to the Board of Supervisors for consideration.  Thus, \n21  Plaintiffs' Complaint and Motion are based on a non-existent hypothetical proposal. \n22  When their preliminary injunction motion was filed, there was no proposal before \n23  the Board of Supervisors.  In fact, County staff was still assessing several possible \n24  alternatives. (Bennett Decl.)  Plaintiffs, unwilling to wait until the Board acted on a \n25  specific proposal, filed for preliminary injunction before the matter was ripe. \n, 26 \n27 \n17 In fact, the Joint Rule 26(t) Status Report filed by the parties reflects that Plaintiffs do not intend to amend their \n28  Complaint. \n-12-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 18 of 30\n1  The staff report recommending the Hybrid Plan that was ultimately approved by \n2  the Board of Supervisors contained extensive information and details regarding the \n3  locations of the Wellness Centers, services, staff, and timing of clients' transitions from \n4  the RSTs to the County-run Wellness Centers.  The Board did not adopt an unformulated \n5  redesign with an abrupt cut in services.  To the contrary, the Hybrid Plan addresses the \n6  very issues which Plaintiffs have alleged must be addressed before any redesign should \n7  be implemented.  Those issues include:  continuation of mental health services to \n8  consumers, provision of services by peers, accessibility of sites, development of a \n9  transition plan and an extended transition period. \n10  Because the proposal which is the basis of Plaintiffs' Complaint and Motion has \n11  not been adopted or implemented, the Court is being asked to rule on a non-existent, \n12  hypothetical situation.  The \"case and controversy\" alleged by Plaintiffs is moot.  This \n13  Court should not issue an advisory opinion based on a set of non-existent facts. \n14  Plaintiffs 'Motion should be denied as there is no meaningful relief that can be granted. \n15  V. \n16  THE COURT LACKS AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE THE COUNTY TO ENTER \nINTO NEW CONTRACTS WITH THE RSTS \n17 \n18  Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the County from \"terminating or reducing the funding\" for \n19  the RSTs.  However, such relief essentially requires the County to enter into new \n20  contracts with the RSTs.  The contracts under which the RSTs previously provided \n21  services expired on their own terms on June 30,2010. (Bennett Decl.)  The Court does \n22  not have authority to require the County to execute or renew such contracts. \n23  A public entity's award of a contract, and all of the acts leading up to the award, are \n24  legislative in character. Santa Ana Tustin Community Hospital v. Bd. a/Supervisors 127 \n25  Cal.App.3d 644,652 (1982).  The ultimate question of whether to contract with a particula \n26  provider for particular services and the amount payable therefore is a purely political one \n27  and is shaped by discretion and public policy.  The determination to award a contract to a \n28  particular contractor involves interdependent political, social and economic judgments. \n-13-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 19 of 30\n1  Therefore, the approval of the contracts is inherently legislative in character. Id. \n2  Even was this Court to conclude that the County's Hybrid Plan is unlawful, such a \n3  determination does not necessarily require the County to maintain a contractual \n4  relationship with the RSTs once that relationship has been terminated.  The decision as to \n5  whether arid with whom to contract for outpatient services rests exclusively within the \n6  purview of the Board of Supervisors.  Legislative discretion is, absent special \n7  circumstances, not subject to judicial control and supervision.  Mike Moore's 24-Hour \n8  Towing v.  City o/San Diego 45 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1305 (1996); Joint Council o/Interns  . \n9  & Residents v. Bd. o/Supervisors 210 Cal.App.3d 1202, 1213-1214 (1989).  For that \n10  reason, this Court lacks authority to mandate legislative action such as the execution of \n11  new contracts with specific providers. \n12  VI. \n13  PLAINTIFFS HAVE FAILED TO RAISE A JUSTICABLE ISSUE. \n14 \nA federal court may not consider matters where a plaintiff lacks standing to pursue \n15 \nthe matter. U.S. Const. Article III,§2.  For standing to exist, there must bean actual case \n16 \nin controversy. SEC v.  Medical Committee/or Human Rights 404 US 403, 407 (1972). \n17 \nPlaintiffs have failed to satisfy the three part test set forth by the Supreme Court  in Lujan \n18 \nv. De/enders o/Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  Under that test, 1) a plaintiff must \n19 \nhave suffered an \"injury in fact,\" i.e. an injury that is \"(a) concrete and particularized and \n20 \n(b) actual and imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical;\" 2) there must be a causal \n21 \nconnection between the injury and the complained of conduct; and 3) it is \"likely\" and \n22 \nnot merely \"speculative\" that a favorable ruling will address the injury. Id.  A plaintiff \n23 \nhas the burden of proof and must satisfy each of the three parts of the above described \n24 \ntest.  Id. \n25 \nPlaintiffs do not satisfy the first prong of this test.  Consequently, they cannot \n26 \ndemonstrate that they meet the second and third prongs of the test.  Plaintiffs' failure \n27 \nstems from the undeniable fact that their entire Complaint is based on a series of events, \n28 \n-14-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 20 of 30\n1  speculation and assumptions that pre-date submission of any proposal to the Board of \n2  Supervisors, let alone the approval of the Hybrid Plan.  Plaintiffs' declarations, whether \n3  by the named Plaintiffs, other consumers or their \"experts,\" are premised on a non-\n4  existent, unadopted and unimplemented proposal.18  Plaintiffs have failed not only to \n5  address what the Board of Supervisors actually approved, but to demonstrate that they \n6  have had, or will have, any actual injury caused by the Hybrid Plan.  Because Plaintiffs' \n7  Complaint and Motion are based on a future event that never materialized, they have \n8  failed to establish Article III standing. \n9  VII. \n10  PLAINTIFFS CANNOT SUCCEED ON THE MERITS BECAUSE \nTHE HYBRID PLAN IS LEGAL \n11 \n12  Plaintiffs have no chance of success on the merits of their claims.  The Hybrid \n13  Plan is not legally deficient, nor does it suffer from any of the alleged deficiencies of the \n14  unrecommended, unad9pted and unimplemented proposal referenced in Plaintiffs' \n15  Complaint and Motion.  The Hybrid Plan continues the same menu of services and the \n16  same service levels that were previously provided by the RSTs.  The primary difference \n17  is that the services are provided at different locations and by different providers. \nA. \n18  The Hybrid Plan Does Not Violate the ADA's Integration Mandate \n19  The ADA's \"integration mandate\" is the crux of Plaintiffs' case.  Under the \n20  integration mandate, a public entity is required to administer services, programs and \n21  activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals \n22  with disabilities.  28 C.F .R. §41.51 (d).  The unjustified isolation of persons with \n23  disabilities is a form of discrimination prohibited under the ADA and Section 504 of the \n24 \n25 \n26 \n18 Following approval of the Hybrid Plan, Plaintiffs submitted three (3) declarations.  The declaration by their \n\"expert\" (Beth Stoneking) primarily disputes the use of clinical as opposed to peer staff in a recovery model. \n27 \nHowever, the appropriate composition of clinical and peer staff, as well as the treatment modality implemented, is \nhardly an actionable matter. \n28 \n-15-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 21 of 30\n1  Rehabilitation Act. 19  Olmsteadv. L.e. ex reI Zimring 527 U.S. 581,597 (1999).  The \n2  Olmstead court disavowed any intent to hold that the ADA imposes either a particular \n3  standard of care or a requirement that disabled persons be provided a particular level of \n4  benefits.  Id.  at 603~ n. 14. \n5  Plaintiffs' primary argument is that the shift in providers and provider sites will \n6  cause consumers to decompensate because there will be a break in services. Complaint, \n7  Para. 84.  This argument has the same flaws as the rest of Plaintiffs' claims:  it is \n8  speculative and unsubstantiated by any credible facts.  As with all of Plaintiffs' \n9  assertions, this has no factual predicate and is pure speculation.  Plaintiffs' \n10  unsubstantiated fears and assertions are based on a proposal that was never recommended \n11  to, or approved by, the Board of Supervisors.  The \"transition plan\" alleged in the \n12  Complaint does not accurately reflect the plan actually adopted. \n13  No factual predicate exists for Plaintiffs' proposition.  Plaintiffs have not shown \n14  any nexus between the Hybrid Plan and the potential for institutionalization.  The \n15  declarations submitted by Plaintiffs demonstrate only fear of change, not a real or \n16  imminent risk of institutionalization. \n17  Courts have previously held that when a state entirely eliminates certain essential \n18  services to the continued health of disabled individuals, those individuals are at a severely \n19  increased risk for institutionalization. v.L. v.  Wagner, 669 F.Supp.2d 1106, 1119-1120 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n19 In view of the similarity between the relevant provisions of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, \ncourts construe and apply them in a consistent manner.  Frederick Lv. Dept. ofP ublic Welfare ofP enn,. 364 F.3d \n28 \n487,491 (3d Cir. 2004). \n-16-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 22 of 30\n1  (N.D. Cal. 2009).20  However, unlike the situation in Wagner, the County is not cutting \n2  off services and leaving Plaintiffs to hang in the wind without the supportive services that \n3  allow them to function within the community. \n4  To the contrary, those services will continue to be offered.  Plaintiffs will merely \n5  receive those services at another location and from another provider.  With the assistance \n6  of the RSTs, consumers will be transitioned over three months to the Wellness Centers. \n7  (Weaver, Kennedy, Zykofsky Decls.) \n8  The provision of the same menu of mental health services by a new provider does \n9  not, and cannot, realistically violate the integration mandate.  Nothing in the integration \n10  mandate requires that services be provided in perpetuity by the same provider or in the \n11  same manner.  To hold otherwise would mean that a service delivery system could never \n12  be modified or changed. \n21 \n13  Plaintiffs contend that the County's transition period is legally deficient.\n14  However, the County has devo,ted substantial time and effort to the transition plan. \n15  (Weaver, Kennedy Decls.)  It has been engaged in a lengthy planning process both prior \n16  to submittal of a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors and after the approval of \n17  the Hybrid Plan.  Planning began in March 2010.  Focus Groups were conducted with the \n18  mental health community and the RSTs. (Weaver Decl.)  As the availability of funding \n19  sources was clarified, the County modified its plan.  Finally, in conjunction with the \n20 \n21 \n20 In Wagner, recipients ofin-home care under the California In-Home Supportive Services (lHSS) program \n22  challenged cuts in eligibility for program benefits as violative of the disability statutes on the basis that it would \nexpose them to potential institutionalization.  Id at 1009;  In an effort to address a fiscal crisis, the State cut critical \n23  in-home support services for over 100,000 disabled and elderly individuals.  Id at 1111. The plaintiffs presented \nsubstantial evidence that the cuts would cause the mentally disabled receiving IHSS services to lose the assistance to \n24  remind them to take medication and to attend medical appointments, and as well as the assistance to perform \nessential tasks to continue their independent living; placing those individuals in serious risk of being forced to move \n25  out of their homes and to the less integrated setting of institution. I d at 1119, 1120.  The defendants argued that \nfamily members or other community support services could be found in order to fill the gaps left by the reduction in \nthe IHSS program. !d. at 1120.  The court found that the complete termination of services violated the integration \n26 \nmandate, because it exposed those no longer receiving services to a serious risk of institutionalization. Id \n21 Plaintiffs never bother to explain to the Court how to calculate such a time period. Does it start the moment a plan \n27 \nis developed? Has the transition period begun the moment a new site is selected? Or does it only begin when the \nfirst patient is transferred? Plaintiffs give no answer to these questions.  Therefore, it is impossible to give much \n28 \nconsideration or credence to the arbitrary \"six month\" period described by the Plaintiffs experts. \n-17-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 23 of 30\n1  2010-11 budget, the Board of Supervisors approved the recommended Hybrid Plan. \n2  An implementation period was built into the Hybrid Plan.  The RSTs would \n3  continue to operate at the same levels in July, but in the subsequent three months, there \n4  would be a phased transition of clients to the Wellness Centers.  The reality is that, for \n5  plaintiffs, no transition period would be adequate.  What Plaintiffs really want is to \n6  maintain the existing system in perpetuity.  The length of any transition period is a \n7  uniquely administrative decision in which this Court should not intervene unless, of \n8  course, it wants to become the arbiter of all administrative and managerial decisions \n9  relating to the new System. \n10  Federal law does not require that a service delivery system remain static merely \n11  because consumers are fearful of change or will be unable to see the same provider.  A \n12  similar complaint was rejected in Cerpac v.  Health and Hospitals Corp.,  147 F.3d 165, \n13  168 (2nd Cir. 1998).  In that case, parents of developmentally disabled children \n14  challenged the closing of a specialized facility where the bulk of services provided at (he \n15  closed facility were to be provided at a new location which was one mile away. \n16  That is precisely what is happening under the Hybrid Plan.  The County is \n17  providing services at a different location and by a different provider.  Its Hybrid Plan \n18  enables meaningful access to services that were previously provided by the RSTs.  Are its \n19  service providers identical?  No.  Do they provide the same range and menu of services? \n20  Yes.  As the Cerpac court stated, citing Alexander v.  Choate 469 U.S. 387 (1985), the \n21  disability statutes neither guarantee any particular level of medical care for disabled \n22  persons, nor assure maintenance of services previously provided.  To the contrary, there \n23  must be sufficient leeway for the public entity to \"maintain a range of services and to \n24  administer services with an even hand.\"  Olmstead v. Zimring, supra, 527 US at 605. \n25  That is what the County is doing under the Hybrid Plan.  This Court should \n26  decline to second guess what would be the most effective system.  It should defer to the \n27  judgment of those with the requisite knowledge and expertise to design a mental health \n28  system of care. \n-18-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 24 of 30\n1  B.  Plaintiffs Have Not Established That They Are Likely To Succeed On \nThe Merits Of Their Medicaid Claims. \n2 \nRelying upon the Supremacy Clause, Plaintiffs assert that they have standing to \n3 \nchallenge specified alleged violations of the Medicaid statues and regulations.22  The \n4 \n5  issue of standing is not so easily dismissed as the afterthought that Plaintiffs seem to give \nit.  Even assuming that the Court finds that there is a \"case in controversy,\" Plaintiffs still \n6 \n7  must establish that the specific statutes and regulations upon which their claims are based \nconfer standing.  No such private right of action exists. \n8 \nNo private right of action exists to enforce the Medicaid provision that requires the \n9 \nstate plan to include reasonable standards, i.e. Plaintiffs' Fifth Claim for Relief.  Watson \n10 \n11  v.  Weeks, 436 F.3d 1152 (9th Cir. 2006).  Similarly, to the extent Plaintiffs Third and \nFourth Claims for Relief are premised upon Medicaid regulations, those regulations do \n12 \n13  not independently create enforcement rights.  See e.g. Save Our Valley v. Sound Transit, \n335 F.3d 932 (9th Cir. 2003). \n14 \nPlaintiffs assert that by virtue of the ruling in Independent Living Center of \n15 \nSouthern California, Inc. v. Shewry, 543 F.3d 1050 (9th Cir. 2008), all Medicaid \n16 \nprovisions are enforceable directly under the Supremacy Clause.23  However, Plaintiffs \n17 \nare wrong.  Independent Living stands for the proposition that an individual has a private \n18 \nright of action to challenge \"state legislation\" that is preempted by federal law. Id at \n19 \n1065.  The state defendant in Independent Living had passed legislation that directly \n20 \nimpacted Medicaid payments to providers. Id at 1053. \n21 \n22 \n23  22 Specifically Plaintiffs have alleged violations of 42 CFR §§440.230(b), 440.240(a), (b)(1) and 42 USC §§ \n1396a(a)(10)(B) and (a)(17). \n24 \n25  23 Independent Living was wrongly decided because it conflicts with numerous precedents set by the Supreme Court, \nincluding Gonzaga v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), and because the Supremacy Clause does not in and of itself create \nany substantive right. See Dennis v. Higgins 498 U.S. 439, 450 (1991): Golden State Transit Corp. v. City ofL os \n26 \nAngeles, 493 U.S. 103, 107 (1989); Chapman v. Houston Welfare rights Org, 441 U.S. 600, 615 (1979). The County \nrealizes that this Court cannot overrule the Ninth Circuit's decision in Independent Living, however, the County \n27 \nraises this issue to preser;ve it if later appellate proceedings are necessary. \n28 \n-19-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 25 of 30\n1  However, the case at bar is not a preemption case, so any standing under the \n2  Supremacy Clause is inapposite.  Plaintiffs do not point to any state or local law that \n3  conflicts with any of those provisions and which should be preempted.  To the contrary, \n4  Plaintiffs seek to directly enforce substantive rights under the Medicaid statutes and \n5  regulations. \n6  The County has not enacted legislation potentially conflicting with \n7  MedicaidlMedi-Cal statutes.  It has simply changed its service delivery mode.  Neither \n8  the types of services provided, nor the population served has been altered.  A change in \n9  service providers does not trigger preemption under the Supremacy Clause. \n10  Assuming arguendo that Plaintiffs do have a private cause of action, they have \n11  still failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their Medicaid claims. \n12  They have not provided any evidence that the Hybrid Plan will be insufficient \"in \n13  amount, duration or scope to achieve [the Medicaid Act's] purpose.\" 42 C.F.R. \n14  §440.230(b). \n15  The Medicaid statutes and regulations do not dictate any particular level of service \n16  that is sufficient in \"amount, duration and scope\" to meet the purposes of the Medicaid \n17  program.  The Medicaid Act gives substantial discretion to choose the proper mix of \n18  benefits, as long as care and services are provided in the best interests of recipients. \n19  Alexandery. Choate, supra, 469 U.S. 287; see also Parry By and Through Parry v. \n20  Crawford,990 F.Supp. 1250, 1257 (D. Nev. 1998).  To hold otherwise would mean that \n21  coverage is unlimited.  Budgeting would be by blank check. \n22  Under the Hybrid Plan, the County will continue to offer the same menu and level \n23  of services that were provided in the prior year by the RSTs. (Zykofsky Decl.)  It will \n24  continue to provide the same level that is required in the County's MHP contract and the \n25  same level that is documented in consumers' care plans. (Zykofsky Decl.)  More()ver, \n26  those services will now be provided with trained clinical staff supported by contractor \n27  psychiatrists and peers.  What was legally adequate in 2009-10 does not become legally \n28  inadequate in 2010-11 merely by changing locations or services providers. \n-20-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 26 of 30\n1  Plaintiffs have not submitted any evidence demonstrating that services provided \n2  under the Hybrid Plan are less than, or not comparable to, those provided in other \n3  counties.  All Plaintiffs give the Court is a baseless assertion that the County fails.  They \n4  do so without a single declaration that details the provision of services in any of the other \n5  57 counties in the state.  The only evidence before the Court on this point is that \n6  submitted by Defendants.  That evidence shows that the County is comparable with other \n7  counties and is, therefore, in compliance with federal statues and regulations. (Zykofsky \n8  Decl.) \n9  Plaintiffs similarly fail on their last Medicaid claim, i.e. their claim that the County \n10  has not used any reasonable standard to make the redesign.  Again, they are wrong.  It is \n11  undeniable that the impetus for the redesign was the unprecedented budget shortfall with \n12  which the County was faced this year, including the decrease in realignment funds that \n13  were historically used to fund the RSTs. (Bennett Decl.)  The County devised this \n14  redesign to accommodate the need to use realignment resources in other capacities. \n15  (Bennett Decl.)  As noted above, this redesign accomplishes these goals without \n16  sacrificing service to any of the mental health consumers.  Therefore, the County is in \n17  compliance with 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(17) because the County has utilized \"reasonable \n18  standards\" to make this change. \n19  C.  The County Has Not Violated Plaintiffs' Due Process Rights \n20  \\ \nPlaintiffs layout the case law regarding due process and Medicaid benefits.  What \n21 \nthey fail to explain, or provide evidence of, is how the County has violated that body of \n22 \nlaw.  Plaintiffs' assertion that the system redesign will necessarily lead to reductions and \n23 \nelimination of services is supported only by speculation.  The facts are that the County is \n24 \nproviding the same menu of services to consumers as under the contractor-operated \n25 \nsystem. (Weaver, Kennedy, Zykofsky Decls.) \n26 \nThe Hybrid Plan does not affect entitlement to levels of services or benefits that \n27 \nmight otherwise trigger the due process requirements.  There is no adverse action; no \n28 \n-21-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 27 of 30\n1  reduction or modification of benefits or services to individual consumers.  Therefore, due \n2  process notices of reduction are not triggered. \n3  Certainly, consumers of County mental health services have a need to be notified \n4  of where they will be receiving services in the future.  The County has, and will continue, \n5  to provide such notice. (Bennett Decl.)  However, the mere fact that a provider or service \n6  location has been changed does not trigger Medicaid due process rights.  Plaintiffs have \n7  provided no authority to contradict this position because no such authority exists. \n8  VIII. \n9  PLAINTIFFS HAVE FAILED TO ESTABLISH A THREAT \nOF IRREPARABLE INJURY \n10 \nPlaintiffs assert they will be denied medically necessary, outpatient mental health \n11 \nservices.  However, such assertions are based upon mere conjecture as to hypothetical \n12 \ninjuries that might possibly occur under a proposal that was never finalized, \n13 \nrecommended, submitted or adopted.  Plaintiffs do not address how the Hybrid Plan \n14 \ndenies them outpatient services. \n15 \nA preliminary injunction may only be granted when the moving party has \n16 \ndemonstrated a significant threat of irreparable injury.  Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc.,  175 \n17 \nF.3d 716, 725 (9th Cir. 1999).  Even if Plaintiffs establish a likelihood of success on the \n18 \nmerits, the absence of a substantial likelihood of irreparable injury, standing alone, makes \n19 \npreliminary injunctive relief improper.  Siegel v. Lepore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (1Ith Cir. \n20 \n2000); Watkins, Inc. v. Lewis, 346 F.3d 841, 844 (8th Cir. 2003).  Abstract or \n21 \nhypothetical injury is not enough; Plaintiffs mush show that they \"[have] sustained or \n22 \n[are] immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury.\" City ofL  os Angeles v. \n23 \nLyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-102 (1983). \n24 \nPlaintiffs have filed numerous declarations, the majority of which assert the fears \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n-22-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 28 of 30\n1  and concerns of mental health consumers relating to an unadopted proposed redesign.24 \n2  All of those declarations make conclusory statements that Plaintiffs will be denied \n3  necessary services.  However, fear of change, without more, does not constitute a \n4  showing of irreparable injury. See e.g. Putz v. Schwarzenegger 2010 WL 1838717 \n5  (N.D.Cal. 2010). \n6  Plaintiffs also rely on the declaration of \"experts\" who base their opinions on \n7  erroneous and factually inaccurate information.  For example, Plaintiffs' expert (Dr. \n8  Michael Franczak) concludes that irreparable harm will occur \"without providing \n9  adequate replacement services and transition to those services.\" (Franczak Decl., Para. \n10  10.)  This conclusion is erroneously based on an assumption that the County's System \n11  cuts off funding to the RSTs and the TCORE program entirely, that new County-operated \n12  clinics will open on July 1,2010, and that the transition will be complete by October 1, \n13  2010. (Franczak Decl., Para. 9.)  No part of his declaration is apparently based on the \n14  Hybrid Plan.  In fact, he fails to render any opinion at all on the Hybrid Plan.  His \n15  conclusions are not grounded in the reality of the situation.  Accordingly, his conclusions \n16  regarding the harm that Plaintiffs will experience are conjecture and hypothetical- bases \n17  which cannot establish the requisite irreparable injury. \n18  Based on the realities of the Hybrid Rlan, rather than the hypothetical proposal \n19  alleged in the Complaint, Plaintiffs do not face any real or immediate harm by the Hybrid \n20  Plan's implementation.  As such, Plaintiffs' Motion should be denied for failure to \n21  establish any harm other than abstract injury. \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n24 Only four of the declarations were submitted following adoption of the Hybrid Plan.  As stated in the Defendants' \nEvidentiary Objections, all suffer from serious deficiencies.  Of the four, only Stoneking's declaration purports to \n26  express an \"expert\" opinion.  However, that declaration merely disputes the characterization of the service modality \nof the Hybrid Model (recovery versus clinical), the propriety of the staffing composition between clinical staff and \n27  peers, and the. basis for appropriate budgeting for the RSTs during the transition period.  These are all operational \nissues.  Nothing in the ADA or Medicaid statutes and regulations require that services be provided under any \n28  particular type of treatment modality or with any particular staffing composition.  The method chosen to reimburse \ncontractors is also a purely administrative determination.:. _ \n23\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 29 of 30\n1  IX. \n2  THE BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS FAVORS THE COUNTY AND \nTHE PUBLIC INTEREST IS BEST SERVED BY DENYING THE MOTION FOR \n3 \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n4 \nPlaintiffs argue that the hardships endured by them are greater than any hardship \n5 \nexperienced by the County if the contractor-operated model were reinstated.  This claim \n6 \nignores the fact that services provided to Plaintiffs are not being reduced or eliminated. \n7 \nThe reality is that the only \"harm\" that Plaintiffs will suffer is the continued receipt of \n8 \ns'ervices at a different location by a different provider.  In stark contrast, reinstatement of \n9 \nthe contractor-operated model will result in substantial hardship to other constituent \n10 \npopulations of the County.  The County will have to reduce other programs or services in \n11 \norder to fund the RSTs, thereby resulting in reductions to other vital and mandated \n12 \nprograms and services. (Burkart Decl.) \n13 \nMental health services are only one of many programs that the County must \n14 \nprovide.  Other programs include medical services to the medically indigent, law \n15 \nenforcement services, supervision of probationers, child protective services, adult and \n16 \ndependent adult abuse services, coroner services, park services to the American River \n17 \nParkway and aid payments to welfare recipients. \n18 \nAn injunction that prohibits the County from implementing the Hybrid Plan \n19 \ntriggers a domino effect.  It would require the County to fund RSTs at the expense of \n20 \nother vital services. (Burkart Decl.)  Reductions to any of those programs negatively \n21 \nimpact core services that are provided to County residents as a whole, leaving the \n22 \nwidespread impact of those cuts to affect all the residents of the County.  It is not County \n23 \ngovernment that would be adversely impacted, but the recipients of governmental \n24 \nservIces. \n25 \nWhat Plaintiffs essentially ask this Court to do is to interfere with the reasoned \n26 \njudgment of the Board of Supervisors.  However, the budgetary process entails a complex \n27 \nbalancing of public needs in many and varied areas with finite financial resources \n28 \n-24-\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 82   Filed 07/07/10   Page 30 of 30\n1  available for distribution among those demands.  It involves interdependent political, \n2  social, and economic judgments which cannot be examined in a vacuum without \n3  considering the potential impact to other services the County provides. \n4  Under the \"separation of powers\" principle, a court generally should not interfere \n5  in the budgetary process.  County ofB  utte v. Superior Court ofB  utte County,  176 \n6  Cal.AppJd 693,698 (1985).  Courts have long held that \"legislative bodies have broad \n7  scope to experiment with economic problems\" and absent decisions running afoul of \n8  constitutional prohibitions or law, may manage their economic resources as they deem \n9  appropriate.  Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 729-730 (1962). \n10  To maintain the RST model and funding as it has traditionally operated would \n11  create undue hardship on the County.  Such hardship which will impact every County \n12  resident outweighs the fears of Plaintiffs as they transition from the RSTs to the Wellness \n13  Centers. \n14  X. \n15  CONCLUSION \n16  F or all the reasons previously stated, Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n17  should be denied in its entirety. \n18 \nDATED:July 7, 2010  ROBERT A.

(“Plaintiffs”) respectfully submit this memorandum of \n2 points and authorities setting forth the reasons why the parties’ Proposed Consent Decree in \n3\nthis case can be entered without court approval, notice to putative class members or a \n4\nfairness hearing: \n5\n  Rule 23(e) provides, in pertinent part, that “[t]he claims, issues, or defenses of a \n6\ncertified class may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court’s \n7\napproval.”  Fed. R.Civ. P. 23(e) (italics added).  Among the procedures that “apply to a \n8\nproposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise” regarding a certified class are the \n9\nfollowing:  \n10\n(1) “The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members \n11\nwho would be bound by the proposal”;  \n12\n13 (2) “If the proposal would bind class members, the court may approve it only \n14 after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate”; and  \n15 (3) “The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying any \n16\nagreement made in connection with the proposal.” \n17\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1)-(3). \n18\n  The critical language in Rule 23(e) is “certified class.”  In 2003 Rule 23(e) was \n19\namended to resolve an “ambiguity” in the language of the former Rule 23(e) that \n20\n“could be  and at time was  read to require court approvals of settlements with \n21\nputative class representatives.”  Adv. Comm. Notes to 2003 Amends. to Fed. R. Civ. \n22\nP. 23.  “The new rule requires approval only if the claims, issues, or defenses of a \n23\ncertified class are resolved by a settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise.”  Id.  \n24\nThe 2003 amendments to Rule 23 did carry “forward the notice requirement of \n25\npresent Rule 23(e)” that “notice is not required when the settlement binds only the \n26\n27 individual class representatives.”  Id.  The amendments to Rule 23 also confirmed \n28 “the already common practice of holding hearings as part of the process of approving \n1 \n \nPlaintiffs’ Memorandum of Points and Authorities re Parties’ Settlement and Entry of Proposed Consent Decree \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 132   Filed 01/23/12   Page 4 of 5\n \n1 settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise that would bind members of a class.” \n2 Id.  \n3\n  There is no certified class in this case. Plaintiffs previously brought a motion to \n4\ncertify this lawsuit as a class action on behalf of “all current and future adult recipients of \n5\nMedi-Cal funded outpatient mental health services from the County of Sacramento.”  See, \n6\ne.g., Dkt. No. 96 at 2.  On July 21, 2010, the Court denied this motion for class certification \n7\nas “premature.”  Dkt. No. 108.  Plaintiffs did not thereafter file another motion for class \n8\ncertification in large part because this lawsuit only seeks injunctive and declaratory relief and \n9\nmembers of the putative class were already benefiting from the preliminary injunction in this \n10\ncase.  The preliminary injunction, among other things, enjoined Defendants from \n11\nimplementing or enforcing the “Hybrid Plan,” which had been approved by the Sacramento \n12\n13 County Board of Supervisors on June 17, 2010, unless and until the Court had determined \n14 that Plaintiffs and “all current and future adult recipients of Medi-Cal funded outpatient \n15 mental health services in the County will continue to receive these outpatient mental health \n16\nservices in the most integrated setting possible so as to avoid their unnecessary \n17\ninstitutionalization  and/or treatment through hospital emergency rooms.”  Dkt. No. 111 at 1.   \n18\n  The Proposed Consent Decree only resolves the five named Plaintiffs’ claims against \n19\nDefendants in this action.  The Court accordingly need not give its approval to such a \n20\nsettlement.  See Schwarzer, Tashima & Wagstaffe, CAL. PRAC. GUIDE: FED. CIV. PRO. \n21\nBEFORE TRIAL (The Rutter Group 2011) ¶10:790 at 10-118 (“There is no requirement of \n22\njudicial approval for precertification dispositions”).  Paragraph 2 of the Proposed Consent \n23\nDecree includes a proviso that “[a]ny claims in this lawsuit on behalf of a putative class of \n24\nall current and future adult recipients of Medi-Cal funded mental health services in the \n25\n26 County of Sacramento are hereby dismissed without prejudice” (italics added).  Since the \n27 Proposed Consent Decree is not binding on members of the putative class, the Court need not \n28\n2 \n \nPlaintiffs’ Memorandum of Points and Authorities re Parties’ Settlement and Entry of Proposed Consent Decree \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 132   Filed 01/23/12   Page 5 of 5\n \n1 give notice of this settlement or hold a fairness hearing to determine whether the settlement \n2 is fair, reasonable and adequate to members of the class. \n3\nUltimately, members of the putative class will enjoy the best of both worlds.  The \n4\nsettlement of this case will have no binding effect on them.  At the same time, they will \n5\nbenefit from the Proposed Consent Decree even though there is not a certified class.  For \n6\nexample, Defendants have agreed to “not implement or enforce the ‘Hybrid Plan,’ either in \n7\nits entirety or major components thereof, under whatever designation or nomenclature” \n8\nthrough January 31, 2013.  Proposed Consent Decree, ¶ 3.  Defendants have also agreed that \n9\nno later than December 31, 2012, they shall develop plans to provide “a continuum of care \n10\nthrough the County-operated and funded adult outpatient mental health system” and to \n11\n“consolidate the two County outpatient clinics.” Id. at ¶ 4.   By December 31, 2012, \n12\n13 Defendants shall additionally “consider and decide whether or not to” implement a number \n14 of other changes to the adult mental health care system, such as “modify[ing] the intake \n15 system so that existing providers can conduct intake assessments for easy access to services” \n16\nand “increas[ing] the use of the Wellness and Recovery model and provide training on this \n17\nmodel to existing contract and County providers.”  Id. at ¶ 5.  \n18\nIn sum, Plaintiffs Leslie Napper, et al., respectfully submit that the Court should enter \n19\nthe accompanying Proposed Consent Decree as soon as possible. \n20\n \n21\nDATED: January 23, 2012  Respectfully submitted, \n22             \n23\n24 By:        \nROBERT D.

Plaintiffs' Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief fails to state a \n19  claim against Defendants upon which relief can be granted. \n20  2.  The Medicaid statutes and regulations on which Plaintiffs base their \n21  Complaint do not afford a private cause of action. \n22  3.  The Supremacy Clause is not applicable to the claims alleged against \n23  Defendants. \n24  4.  The Complaint does not allege a case or controversy in that the matters \n25  alleged therein are not ripe for adjudication. \n26  5.  Plaintiffs, as individuals and as class representatives, lack standing to bring \n27  this action. \n28  6.  Plaintiffs have failed to join the State of California and the State \n13 \nANSWER TO CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 68   Filed 06/23/10   Page 14 of 14\n1  Department of Mental Health as parties who must be joined in this action under Rule 19 \n2  in that the State of California and the State Department of Mental Health are responsible \n3  for the administration of the State Medicaid program and for ensuring compliance of the \n4  County's Mental Health Plan with federal and state requirements. \n5  7.  Plaintiffs' Complaint is moot in that the proposed plan alleged therein was \n6  not submitted or adopted by the Board of Supervisors; another plan was approved and is \n7  being implemented. \n8  8.  Plaintiffs' claims relating to the ADA's integration mandate are barred in \n9  that Plaintiffs are not currently institutionalized or at serious risk of institutionalization as \n10  a result of the County's restructuring of the Adult Outpatient Mental Health System. \n11  9.  The continued provision of mental health services under the service \n12  delivery model in existence for fiscal year 2009-2010 would constitute a fundamental \n13  alteration of its Adult Outpatient Mental Health System and would jeopardize the \n14  provision of mental health services to other categories of mentally ill consumers in \n15  Sacramento County. \n16  10.  The separation of powers doctrine prohibits the judiciary from dictating the \n17  manner in which services are provided to mentally ill consumers in Sacramento County. \n18  WHEREFORE, Defendants pray that: \n19  1.  The Complaint be dismissed in its entirety; \n20  2.  Plaintiffs take nothing from Defendants; \n21  3.  Defendants be awarded their costs and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in \n22  defending this action; and \n23  4.  Defendants be awarded such further relief as the Court may deem just and \n24  proper. \n25  DATED:_~Ju=n~e-=2=3~,2 =0~1~0 __  ROBERT A.

This civil rights class action lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to \n3  prevent the devastating and unlawful termination of essential mental health services to thousands \n4  of low-income Medi-Cal recipients in Sacramento County.  Defendant County of Sacramento \n5  (“County”) and Defendant County officials have announced that effective June 30, 2010, they \n6  will terminate mental health programs that provide “core” services to approximately 5,000 \n7  County residents with severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and \n8  depression.  Specifically, the County intends to end all funding for the Regional Support Team \n9  (“RST”) programs and the Transitional Community Opportunities for Recovery and Engagement \n10  (“TCORE”) program and to reduce funding by more than 60% for the Wellness and Recovery \n11  Centers.  Together these impacted programs provide most of the outpatient mental health services \n12  to Medi-Cal recipients in Sacramento County.   \n13  2.  Although Defendants have publicly stated that they intend to open new clinics, \n14  they have supplied so far few details about the staffing or capacity of these new clinics.  It is \n15  impossible for the Defendants to establish a fully functioning outpatient mental health system for \n16  5,000 people in the time remaining before July 1, 2010.  In less than two months Defendants \n17  cannot open and outfit new facilities, hire the requisite staff and make all the other necessary \n18  arrangements so as to assume treatment for these individuals, for whom they are not currently \n19  providing any outpatient mental health services. Indeed, Defendants have limited expertise in \n20  providing outpatient mental health services to County residents.  Moreover, it seems highly \n21  unlikely that the new clinics will even attempt to treat the same number of clients or offer the \n22  same mental health services, inasmuch as County officials have cited fiscal considerations as the \n23  reasons for eliminating all four RSTs and the TCORE program and drastically scaling back the \n24  Wellness and Recovery Centers. \n25  3.  As of May 4, 2010, Defendants had provided no details to Plaintiffs and other \n26  Medi-Cal recipients like them about what services will be provided, when they will be available \n27  or where or how they can be accessed.  Worse, Defendants have not attempted to notify recipients \n28  of existing services or how they might obtain services beginning July 1, 2010, and they have not \n  1    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 4 of 35\n1  drawn up individualized plans for serving these patients.  As a result, thousands of the County’s \n2  most vulnerable citizens – persons who have until now had access to quality outpatient mental \n3  health care treatment administered by dedicated professionals – face a catastrophic break in their \n4  treatment, and will inevitably be exposed to increased harm of injury and death if the County’s \n5  unlawful acts are not enjoined.  Even if equivalent services were to be provided, recipients would \n6  suffer greatly by reason of being suddenly deprived of access to service providers upon whose \n7  care they depend, and in whom they have learned to place their trust, in most cases only gradually \n8  and with great difficulty.  \n9  4.  It was not until recently that the County began to make any arrangements with the \n10  RSTs and other programs for the transfer of these recipients to the new clinics (wherever they \n11  may be).  The County has not yet addressed all the important logistical details, such as the \n12  copying of clients’ records at the current facilities, transfer of records to the new facilities and the \n13  scheduling of appointments for clients at the new facilities. Thus, to the extent the County has \n14  drawn up any plans for the ongoing treatment of class members, those plans appear to be sketchy, \n15  disorganized, and constantly changing, and are woefully inadequate to preserve the rights of class \n16  members to continue receiving the kind and level of service they have been receiving to date. \n17  5.  Unless enjoined, the County’s planned termination of mental health services will \n18  cause immediate and irreparable harm by depriving Plaintiffs and thousands of class members \n19  like them of medically necessary mental health treatment.  Without this care, these individuals \n20  with severe mental health disorders are at imminent and serious risk of harm to their health and \n21  safety, as well as unnecessary and unwanted out-of-home placement, including \n22  institutionalization.  \n23  6.  The proposed termination of mental health services will not only cause profound \n24  disruptions in the lives of our most vulnerable citizens, but will also end up costing the County \n25  more in the short-term as well as the long-term.  According to Defendant County, the closures are \n26  purportedly necessitated by budget shortfalls and by a County ordinance that has been interpreted \n27  to require preservation of County jobs.  However, County officials publicly admit that providing \n28  mental health services through County clinics and its own employees will be more expensive than \n  2    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 5 of 35\n1  the current system, which relies on private nonprofit contractors who have successfully been \n2  offering such services for at least the past 15 years.  Curtailing outpatient services will also lead \n3  to greater costs from needless psychiatric crises and hospitalizations.   \n4  7.  The County’s proposed plans to terminate mental health services are so severe \n5  that, if implemented, they will violate a number of provisions of federal and state law.  Under the \n6  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12312 (“ADA”), Section 504 of the \n7  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (“Section 504”), and California Government Code \n8  § 11135, public entities, such as the County, have a duty to provide services to people with \n9  disabilities in the “most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.”  Here, the most integrated \n10  setting for current County mental health clients is living in the community with case management \n11  and outpatient care, as they have been doing successfully to date.  Without these services, \n12  Plaintiffs and other similarly situated clients are at risk of institutionalization, self-injury and even \n13  death.  \n14  8.  The proposed termination of mental health services and the County’s apparent \n15  failure to provide adequate transition services contravene the above-mentioned federal and state \n16  laws in a number of other ways:  (a) by denying people with disabilities the opportunity to benefit \n17  from the County’s mental health services or providing them with less effective services; (b) by \n18  using methods of administration that discriminate on the basis of disability and defeat the purpose \n19  of the County’s Mental Health Plan; (c) by selecting sites for new clinics that may not be \n20  accessible to people with disabilities; and (d) by failing to make modifications and/or \n21  accommodations when necessary to avoid discrimination.  \n22  9.  The proposed actions also violate the requirements of Title XIX of the Social \n23  Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396a) (“Medicaid Act”) that Medicaid recipients such as the Plaintiffs \n24  and others similarly situated are provided with (a) services that are sufficient in amount, duration, \n25  and scope to reasonably achieve their purposes; (b) comparable Medicaid services to individuals \n26  with similar needs; and (c) services according to reasonable standards.   \n27  10.  Finally, Defendants’ failure to provide adequate notice and opportunity for hearing \n28  prior to depriving members of the Plaintiff class of critical Medi-Cal mental health services \n  3    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 6 of 35\n1  violates the federal and state constitutional guarantees of due process and the Medicaid Act’s \n2  notice and hearing provisions. \n3  JURISDICTION \n4  11.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n5  1367.  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, \n6  2202 and 1343, and by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  At all times \n7  relevant to this action, Defendants have acted under color of state law.  \n8  12.  Plaintiffs’ claims for violations of California state law concern the same actions \n9  and omissions that form the basis of Plaintiffs’ claims under federal law such that they are all part \n10  of the same case or controversy.  This Court therefore has supplemental jurisdiction over these \n11  state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.   \n12  13.  This action for declaratory and injunctive relief arises in part under Title II of the \n13  Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \n14  Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794; Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a et seq.; \n15  42 U.S.C. § 1983; the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, \n16  and the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution (U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 2).  \n17  VENUE \n18  14.  Venue is proper in the Eastern District of California pursuant to 28 \n19  U.S.C. § 1391(b), because the Defendants operate and perform their official duties therein and \n20  thus reside therein for purposes of venue, and because a substantial part of the events and \n21  omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in Sacramento County, which is in the Eastern \n22  District of California.   \n23  PARTIES \n24  Plaintiffs \n25  15.

Defendant County of Sacramento (“County”) is a local governmental entity duly \n3  authorized and formed under the laws of the State California.  Pursuant to California’s Welfare \n4  and Institutions Code § 5775, the County has been designated as the Mental Health Plan \n5  responsible for the provision of specialty mental health services to Medi-Cal recipients who are \n6  County residents.   The County is a local government entity within the meaning of Title II of the \n7  ADA, and receives federal funding within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act.  The County is \n8  responsible for providing mental health services to Medi-Cal recipients who reside within the \n9  County, and receives funding from the federal and state governments for these services.  The \n10  County is responsible for oversight of Defendant Sacramento County Department of Behavioral \n11  Health Services.  The County also promulgates policies and procedures regarding the operation of \n12  this agency and the provision of services through this agency. \n13  21.  Defendant Sacramento County Board of Supervisors oversees the management of \n14  County government.  \n15  22.  Defendants Roger Dickinson, Jimmie Yee, Susan Peters, Roberta MacGlashan and \n16  Don Nottoli are current members of the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors.  They have all \n17  been sued only in their official capacities.   \n18  23.  Defendant Sacramento County Department of Behavioral Health Services \n19  (“DBHS”) is an agency of Defendant County and is responsible for providing mental health \n20  services to the Sacramento community.  The mission statement for DBHS’ Division of Mental \n21  Heath states that it will “[a]ssist adults with mental illnesses and children/youth with emotional \n22  disturbance by providing services and supports to maximize their quality of life,” “[s]ustain and \n23  enhance a public mental health system that supports recovery for adults with mental illness and \n24  children/youth with disturbance,” and “[e]liminate mental health disparities for all cultural, ethnic \n25  and racial groups.”  DBHS receives federal and state funds.   \n26  24.  Defendant Ann Edwards-Buckley is DBHS’ current Director and, as such, is \n27  responsible for and supervises the operation of this County agency.  She is sued only in her \n28  official capacity. \n  6    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 9 of 35\n1  25.  Defendant Mary Ann Bennett is the current Mental Health Director for the \n2  County.  She is responsible for ensuring the provision of mental health services in the County and \n3  for supervising the activities of DBHS’ Division of Mental Health.  She is sued only in her \n4  official capacity.   \n5  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n6  26.  This action can be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(a) and 23(b)(2) \n7  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  For all claims for relief, Plaintiffs bring this action on \n8  behalf of a class consisting of “all current and future recipients of Medi-Cal funded mental health \n9  services in the County of Sacramento” (the “Class”).  \n10  27.  Numerosity:  The Plaintiff Class is so numerous that joinder of all its members is \n11  impracticable.  Upon information and belief, there are more than 5,000 persons in the Class.  \n12  Joinder of individuals in the Class is also impracticable because members of the Class lack the \n13  knowledge and financial means to maintain individual actions.   \n14  28.  Commonality:  Common questions of fact and law predominate over questions \n15  affecting individual class members.  Questions of fact and law common to members of the Class \n16  include but are not limited to whether the termination and reduction of Medi-Cal funded mental \n17  health services to class members violate provisions of the Medicaid Act, the ADA, Section 504, \n18  and California Government Code § 11135, and whether the County’s implementation of these \n19  reductions fails to meet the requirements of procedural due process established by the U.S. and \n20  California Constitutions. \n21  29.  Typicality:  The claims of Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the Class as a \n22  whole and members of the Class currently are eligible Medi-Cal recipients and qualified \n23  individuals with disabilities who will be affected similarly by the terminations and reductions in \n24  Medi-Cal funded mental health services in the County.  The claims arise from the same unlawful \n25  and discriminatory law and policies and practices of Defendants.   \n26  30.  Adequate representation:  Plaintiffs will fairly represent and adequately protect \n27  the interests of members of the Class as a whole.  Plaintiffs do not have any interests antagonistic \n28  to those of other members of the Class.  By filing this action, Plaintiffs have displayed an interest \n  7    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 10 of 35\n1  in vindicating their rights, as well as the claims of others who are similarly situated.  The relief \n2  sought by Plaintiffs will inure to the benefit of members of the Class generally.  Plaintiffs are \n3  represented by counsel who are experienced, skilled, and knowledgeable about civil rights \n4  litigation, disability discrimination, Medicaid law, practice and procedure in the federal courts, \n5  and the prosecution and management of class action litigation.  \n6  31.  Rule 23(b)(2):  Class certification is appropriate pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \n7  Procedure 23(b)(2) because Defendants have acted, refused to act, or will act on grounds \n8  generally applicable to the Class, thereby making final injunctive and declaratory relief \n9  appropriate with respect to the Class as a whole. \n10  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n11  A.  Medi-Cal and the California Medi-Cal Managed Mental Health Care Plans \n12  32.  Medi-Cal recipients have an entitlement to mental health services through \n13  California’s Medicaid program (“Medi-Cal”).  Medicaid is a joint federal and state medical \n14  assistance program for certain groups of low-income people, including children.  42 U.S.C. §§ \n15  1396-1396v.  California has elected to participate in the Medicaid program, and so must comply \n16  with the requirements of the federal Medicaid Act and its implementing regulations. \n17  33.  The purpose of Medicaid is to furnish, as far as practicable, “medical assistance on \n18  behalf of . . . aged, blind or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to \n19  meet the costs of necessary medical services” and “to help such families and individuals to attain \n20  or retain capability for independence or self-care . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 1396.  \n21  34.  Participating States are reimbursed by the federal government for a portion of the \n22  cost of providing Medicaid benefits.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396b.  The remaining funding for the \n23  Medi-Cal program comes from the State and the counties. \n24  35.  The Medicaid Act requires that recipients be provided with the freedom to choose \n25  their own health and mental health providers.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23).  However, the Medicaid \n26  Act allows participating states to establish Medicaid managed care programs in which freedom of \n27  choice is limited, or waived.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n.  \n28 \n  8    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 11 of 35\n1  36.  California has obtained federal approval for a managed care waiver program to \n2  provide mental health services to its Medi-Cal recipients with severe and chronic mental illness \n3  and these recipients are mandatorily included in that managed care waiver program.  The mental \n4  health services available to Medi-Cal recipients through the managed care waiver program are \n5  called “specialty mental health services.”  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 9, §§ 1810.00, 1810.247.   \n6  37.  Medi-Cal specialty mental health care services are provided only through \n7  designated Mental Health Plans (“MHPs”). Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 5775, 5776, 5777; Cal. Code \n8  Regs. tit. 9, § 1810.305.  Counties have the first option to become the Mental Health Plan in their \n9  respective geographic areas. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5775 (c).  Every county, including Sacramento \n10  County, has elected to serve, alone or in conjunction with another county, as a local Mental \n11  Health Plan.  \n12  38.  Under the federal Medicaid waiver, Medi-Cal recipients do not have freedom of \n13  choice regarding their mental health providers and may only obtain specialty mental health \n14  services from the Mental Health Plan in their county.   \n15  39.  As a condition of receiving state and federal Medicaid funding, Mental Health \n16  Plans are obligated to: \n17    “comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations and guidelines” (Welf. & \n18  Inst. Code § 5776);  \n19    provide “medically necessary mental health services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries” \n20  (id., § 5777(a)(1));  \n21    bear the financial risk of providing these services (id., § 5777(a)(1));  \n22    “be financially responsible for ensuring access and a minimum required scope of \n23  benefits, consistent with state and federal law,” (id., § 5777(a)(3)); and  \n24    adopt “appropriate standards relating to quality, access and coordination of \n25  services within a managed system of care” (id., § 14684 (c)).   \n26  40.  State regulations impose the same requirements on Mental Health Plans.  See Cal. \n27  Code Regs. tit. 9, § 1810.110(a) (MHP “shall comply” with “all applicable federal laws, \n28  regulations and guidelines”); § 1810.345(a) (MHP “shall provide or arrange and pay for specialty \n  9    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 12 of 35\n1  mental health services to the [Medi-Cal] beneficiary” when “medical necessity criteria” are met); \n2  § 1810.405(a) (MHP “shall be responsible for assuring that the beneficiary has access to specialty \n3  mental health services”).   \n4  41.  State law defines the target population for specialty mental health services under \n5  the managed care waiver as “adults with serious and persistent mental illness and children with \n6  serious emotional disturbance.”  Welf & Inst. Code § 14686(f).  Accord, Cal. Code Regs. tit. 9, \n7  § 1830.205 (medical necessity criteria for adults); § 1830.210 (medical necessity criteria for \n8  children under age 21).  \n9  42.  According to the California Department of Mental Health, specialty mental health \n10  services are “those services requiring the services of a specialist in mental health,” as opposed to \n11  general mental health care needs, “which could be met by a general health care practitioner.”  \n12  Specialty mental health services are also defined in Title 9 of the California Code of Regulations \n13  at § 1810.247. \n14  43.  Pursuant to regulation, every Medi-Cal recipient participates with service \n15  providers in the development of his or her client plan, which specifies the goals of the person who \n16  is receiving the service.  “Client plan” means a plan for the provision of specialty mental health \n17  services to a Medi-Cal recipient who meets statewide medical necessity criteria. Cal. Code Regs. \n18  tit. 9, § 1810.205.2.  The plan also specifies the type of service and the proposed duration of each \n19  type of service the person is to receive.  It is signed by the recipient and the person who is \n20  responsible for providing, coordinating and/or approving the service(s).  The plan must be \n21  updated at least annually.  \n22  B.   Sacramento’s Mental Health System \n23  44.  Defendants Sacramento County and its DBHS constitute the designated Mental \n24  Health Plan with obligations to provide specialty mental health services to Medi-Cal recipients in \n25  Sacramento County.   According to recent state data, the County served 20,626 recipients during \n26  the 2008-2009 fiscal year, nearly half of whom (10,235) were adults.   \n27  45.  Sacramento County provides a range of adult mental health services, including \n28  acute psychiatric emergency services, crisis residential services, and outpatient mental health \n  10    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 13 of 35\n1  services (both high and low-moderate intensity).  \n2  46.  The County provides mental health services through a network of providers.  The \n3  County has contracted with outside agencies, most of which are private non-profit programs, to \n4  provide virtually all of these mental health services.  Only a small portion of the County’s mental \n5  health services are County operated and staffed by its own employees. \n6  47.  The County operates an “Access Center,” which acts as the gate-keeper for Medi-\n7  Cal clients seeking to obtain mental health services in the County.  The Access Center is staffed \n8  by teams that specialize in services to adults and in services for children.  These teams accept \n9  requests for service, assess the client’s level of need and authorize services based on this \n10  determination, make referrals to a network of county and contract providers, and approve requests \n11  for re-authorization of services.   \n12  48.  Defendant DBHS has adopted an “Adult Mental Health Services Policy & \n13  Procedure Manual” that governs access to county mental health services.  This manual dictates (a) \n14  the target population for County mental health services, (b) the procedures for determining a \n15  client’s level of care and developing his or her treatment plan, (c) for each different contracted \n16  and county mental health program, the staffing levels and caseload ratios required for clients with \n17  different levels of care, and (d) the criteria for making referrals within the county’s network of \n18  providers.   \n19  49.  County policy requires that the Access Center teams respond with a referral within \n20  three days of every call.  According to County documents and reports, the Access Center has \n21  often failed to meet that time frame, with reports of two weeks to respond to requests for a \n22  referral.   \n23  50.  For many years, the County Mental Health Plan has been plagued by inadequate \n24  capacity to serve clients in need, with resulting delays in treatment.  A 100-page report by the \n25  State’s quality review team found that in 2008, the “system [did] not have sufficient program \n26  capacity to provide services.”  The state reviewers found in particular that:  timely access to \n27  services was the County’s “greatest systemic challenge,” with “excessive wait times” such as \n28  waits of up to five months for a psychiatry appointment; caseloads were excessively high with \n  11    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 14 of 35\n1  adult caseloads of 130 -150 consumers; and the County had not adequately provided information \n2  for and outreach to mono-lingual Spanish-speaking consumers.  The reviewers’ report also found \n3  that there was an “over-reliance on crisis services,” 40-50% of consumers in crisis were \n4  “unlinked,” meaning they had not had an appointment before, and there were long delays to \n5  connect “unlinked” consumers to services and to get appointments.  Finally, the reviewers \n6  reported that “the demand for outpatient services continues to rise.”  \n7  51.  In 2009, the increased need for mental health care and the County’s over-reliance \n8  on crisis and inpatient care resulted in the census in its inpatient facility, the Mental Health \n9  Treatment Center, exceeding capacity again and again.  This forced a series of rolling closures in \n10  which police and emergency response teams with mentally ill patients were diverted to \n11  surrounding counties, where the patients were left in hospital emergency rooms.   \n12  52.  In 2009, despite the continued demand for mental health services, the County cut \n13  millions of dollars from its mental health budget.  Thousands of clients were terminated from \n14  services.  Because no providers were terminated or closed, their staff members worked to identify \n15  the clients whose mental illnesses were the least severe and who were best able to tolerate a \n16  transition to a lower level of care.  The County also terminated almost all mental health clients \n17  who did not have Medi-Cal eligibility.  Many in this group were simply unable to navigate the \n18  arduous process for qualifying for federal social security benefits, which is the primary means for \n19  an adult to establish Medi-Cal eligibility.  \n20  53.  The County made deep reductions in mental health funding for contracted agencies \n21  in 2009 in part to preserve county positions that would otherwise have been eliminated.  \n22  According to the minutes of a public meeting on August 20, 2009, Defendant Bennett stated that \n23  “the reason that the number of affected contract employee positions is larger than the number of \n24  displaced county employees is that County employees cost more than contract employees.” \n25  54.  A report by the State’s quality review team in 2009, just as reductions were \n26  occurring, found that “the number of adults served by the RSTs decreased by 64% to just under \n27  3000 in a very short time frame, much of which was the result of budgetary reductions.  This \n28  leaves many consumers at risk of ‘falling through the cracks.’”  The state reviewers reiterated that \n  12    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 15 of 35\n1  the “[mental health] system does not have sufficient program capacity to provide services,” that \n2  “in patient capacity continues to be problematic . . . . The system is in urgent need for more \n3  options for and alternatives to hospitalization.”  \n4  55.  The County has continued to commit millions of dollars to funding costly services \n5  in locked treatment settings.  A memorandum dated April 1, 2010, from Defendant DBHS \n6  explains that the County spends $22,908,341 annually to fund 217 locked inpatient and nursing \n7  home beds at four institutions.  Two are non-county facilities, Napa State Hospital and Crestwood \n8  Psychiatric Health Facility (“PHF”), while the remaining two are County-owned facilities – its \n9  Mental Health Treatment Center with 50 beds and its new 12-bed PHF.  The two non-county \n10  facilities average more than $60,298 per bed per year.  The average cost for the two locked \n11  County facilities exceeds $215,000 per bed per year.   \n12  Regional Support Teams (“RSTs”) \n13  56.  For many years, the Regional Support Teams (“RSTs”) have been the primary \n14  source of adult outpatient services in the County.  The most recent state audit of Sacramento’s \n15  Mental Health Plan described the RSTs as “the core mental health specialty services for low to \n16  moderate intensity clients.”  The County’s Adult Mental Health Service Directory identifies the \n17  RSTs as the only outpatient source of “comprehensive mental health and medication services for \n18  adults” in the County.   \n19  57.  There are four RSTs, all operated by private, non-profit mental health programs:  \n20  Northgate Point in the northern part of Sacramento County; Human Resource Consultants in the \n21  eastern part of Sacramento County; Visions Unlimited in the southern part of Sacramento County; \n22  and El Hogar in the western part of Sacramento County.  \n23  58.  At present, the four RSTs serve approximately 3600 clients per year.  A majority \n24  of the RST clients are Medi-Cal recipients.  \n25  59.  The County identifies four levels of care for outpatient services.  RST clients are \n26  eligible for services at Level II or Level III within the County’s level of care framework, \n27  according to the DBHS Adult Mental Health Services Grid, dated January 12, 2010. \n28  60.  To be eligible for community support services (Level II) from the RSTs, an adult \n  13    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 16 of 35\n1  must, among other things, have been “currently assessed as requiring a need for a strong \n2  connection to treatment and support” and “still in need for assistance in maintaining stable living \n3  environment, supported employment, and identification of meaningful activities for community \n4  reentry.”  The County has specified a required staffing ratio of 1:25 for this level of care.   \n5  61.  To be eligible for intensive services (Level III) from the RSTs, an adult must meet, \n6  inter alia, the following criteria:  (1) is being discharged from an acute setting; (2) has been \n7  hospitalized for psychiatric reasons three times in the past twelve months; and (3) is willing to \n8  accept services or would most likely risk deterioration without intensive level of services.  The \n9  County has specified a required staffing ratio of 1:70 for this level of care.   \n10  Transitional Community Opportunities for Recovery and Engagement (“TCORE”) \n11  62.  Besides the RSTs, another outpatient treatment program is Transitional \n12  Community Opportunities for Recovery and Engagement (“TCORE”).  TCORE focuses on \n13  clients who are being discharged from acute treatment settings or at risk of entering acute care \n14  settings and are not linked to ongoing services.  TCORE provides crisis intervention, case \n15  management, rehabilitative services and medication management.  The program emphasizes \n16  access for non-English speakers and other under-served and unserved groups.   \n17  63.  TCORE serves a significant number of adult Medi-Cal recipients.  On information \n18  and belief, TCORE currently serves over 700 clients per year.   \n19  Consumer Self Help (“CSH”) Wellness and Recovery Centers \n20  64.  Another outpatient treatment program consists of the Consumer Self Help \n21  (“CSH”) Wellness and Recovery Centers – North and South.   Like the RSTs, the Wellness and \n22  Recovery Centers provide community support services (“Level II”).  These Centers provide group \n23  activities, self help, peer counseling and peer support along with medication management.   \n24  65.  According to the County’s 2009 Mental Health Services Act report on this \n25  program, the Wellness and Recovery Centers serve 1600 clients annually.   \n26  66.  Other than the RSTs, TCORE and the Wellness and Recovery Centers, the County \n27  Service Directory lists only a few other programs that provide outpatient mental health services to \n28  particular groups of County mental health patients.  These are the County-operated Adult \n  14    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 17 of 35\n1  Psychiatric Support Service (“APSS”) clinic (providing medication support and referrals), the \n2  County-operated APSS Aftercare Center (referrals for people leaving jail or institutions), the \n3  Transcultural Wellness Center (serving Asian Pacific Islander clients), the El Hogar Senior Sierra \n4  Program (seniors only), and Turning Point Integrated Service Agency and the Telecare SOAR \n5  program (24 hour per day services for people in secure or locked institutions).  \n6  C.    Proposed Terminations and Reductions of Medi-Cal Mental Health Services \n7  in Sacramento County  \n8  67.  On March 16, 2010, Defendant Bennett issued a memorandum to employees of \n9  Defendant DBHS announcing a reduction of $17.5 million in expenditures for the 2010-2011 \n10  fiscal year.  The memorandum stated that the reductions would “significantly impact our \n11  contracted providers and the vital services they provide to our clients.”  According to Defendant \n12  Bennett’s memorandum, the Department of Behavioral Health Services would lose 58.9 \n13  positions, for a reduction of $4.9 million.  The bulk of the cuts – $11.9 million – were proposed \n14  for “our contracted providers and the vital services they provide to our clients.”  This would \n15  require closing all four RSTs and making other “significant reductions to mental health services” \n16  within the County.   \n17  68.  On March 18, 2010, Defendant Bennett made a presentation at a public County \n18  meeting regarding the above-mentioned reductions for the 2010-2011 fiscal year, adding that \n19  “[t]hese cuts will necessitate a redesign of the MHSA programs to compensate for the losses, \n20  especially in the adult outpatient system.”   \n21  69.  At a public meeting on April 1, 2010, Defendant Bennett provided a summary of \n22  the proposed budget reductions.  This document identified “unavoidable cost increases” that led \n23  to the budget shortfall, including $5.4 million in raises for County employees and $856,000 in \n24  increased costs for the County’s new 12-bed locked psychiatric facility (in addition to the \n25  millions already committed to that project).  Another $2.9 million will be repayment of an earlier \n26  interdepartmental loan.  This attachment also identified the “loss of revenue due to the \n27  reductions,” which consists of an estimated loss of $4 million in federal Medicaid funding for \n28  adults and $951,974 in Federal Medicaid funding for children. \n  15    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 18 of 35\n1  70.  At this public meeting on April 1, 2010, Defendant Bennett released the County’s \n2  “proposed” plan to open new County clinics staffed with county employees displaced from other \n3  positions.  Another document distributed at the April 1 meeting described the County’s “System \n4  Redesign Proposed Plan.”  This document acknowledged that the budget reductions will affect \n5  “6500 individuals served in a moderate service level system.”  The System Redesign Proposed \n6  Plan states that “we are planning services for approximately 5000 to 6000 of consumers [sic] \n7  currently in services,” and would reduce services by referring clients to health care clinics instead \n8  of the Mental Health Plan.  The Plan states that the new County clinics will be staffed by 28.6 \n9  county employees slated for termination but whose positions “are protected” by the voter-\n10  approved County Charter Section 71J.  In addition, the County purportedly plans to increase its \n11  contract with University of California Davis to provide medical staff in the County clinics.  \n12  71.   In the meantime, Defendants have informed the non-profit agencies that provide \n13  adult outpatient services that effective June 30, 2010, the County will do the following: \n14    Terminate all funding for the four RSTs, which together have a staff of 149 \n15  employees.  \n16    Terminate all funding for the TCORE program operated by Human Resources \n17  Consultants.  This program has 39 employees.    \n18    Reduce funding for the Consumer Self-Help Wellness and Recovery Centers by \n19  more than 60%, which will necessitate closing one of the facilities.    \n20  72.  On information and belief, Defendants held a meeting on April 26, 2010, with the \n21  RSTs and other contracting agencies to discuss transition plans. Yet, as of May 4, 2010, \n22  Defendants had made no concrete arrangements for the transfer of existing clients from treating \n23  staff at the RSTs, the TCORE program and the Wellness and Recovery Centers to new treating \n24  staff at County clinics.  Defendants have not addressed such important logistical details as the \n25  copying of clients’ records at the current facilities, transfer of records to the new facilities and the \n26  scheduling of appointments for clients at the new facilities.  Such arrangements to transition \n27  existing clients to the new County clinics cannot be completed in less than two months. \n28 \n  16    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 19 of 35\n1  73.  As of May 4, 2010, Defendants had publicly announced few details about the \n2  operations of the new County clinics, such as their locations, staffing, hours of operation and \n3  range of available services.  \n4  74.  As of May 4, 2010, Defendants had not sent any notices to current clients of the \n5  RSTs, the TCORE program or the Wellness and Recovery Centers regarding the termination of \n6  their services effective June 30, 2010, or where they should go to receive alternative services \n7  beginning July 1, 2010.  Nor had Defendants made any announcements to other Medi-Cal \n8  recipients with severe mental health disorders or to the public at large about what would be the \n9  available outpatient mental health services for Medi-Cal recipients in the County beginning June \n10  30, 2010.   \n11  75.  For each client currently in treatment at the RSTs, TCORE and the Wellness and \n12  Recovery Centers, the County has made an individualized determination that he or she meets the \n13  admission criteria for this program and requires this level of mental health services.  The \n14  County’s Policy Manual specifies the process for making a level of care determination.  The \n15  County’s level of care determination is reflected in each client’s treatment plan. The County \n16  Manual specifies that the treatment plan is in effect for twelve months and that services are \n17  authorized based on this plan.  Each level of service also requires a staffing ratio that is specified \n18  in the County Manual and the RST’s contract.  \n19  76.  On information and belief, the County does not have the ability to provide the \n20  services required in each client’s treatment plan if the clients are referred to County clinics \n21  beginning June 30, 2010.   \n22  77.  On information and belief, the County will not be providing medically necessary, \n23  mental health services to thousands of members of the Class beginning June 30, 2010.    \n24  78.  According to the “Adult Mental Health Services Policy & Procedure Manual,” the \n25  general criteria for discharge from the RSTs include that the “Client does not meet medical \n26  necessity criteria” or that the “Client is receiving services from another mental health provider \n27  within Sacramento County including private/public entities.”  The criteria for discharge from \n28  community support services from the RSTs include that the “Client has met treatment goals and is \n  17    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 20 of 35\n1  no longer receiving mental health services.” \n2  79.  On information and belief, the County does not have the ability to meet these \n3  discharge criteria before terminating services for class members because they will not be \n4  receiving services from another provider on July 1, 2010, and have not met their treatment goals.  \n5  80.  On information and belief, Defendants do not intend to send any notices of action \n6  in advance of the termination or reduction in mental health services to class members who are \n7  currently receiving mental health services from the RSTs, the TCORE program or the Wellness \n8  and Recovery Centers.    \n9  D.   Impact of the Proposed Mental Health Cuts upon Medi-Cal Recipients \n10  81.  The RST programs, the TCORE program and the Wellness and Recovery Centers \n11  all provide effective mental health treatment that helps prevent unnecessary and costly \n12  institutionalization, improving the quality of life for the individuals served, and, at the same time, \n13  saving the County and the State significant funds. \n14  82.  The closure of the RST programs and the TCORE program and the drastic \n15  reductions in the Wellness and Recovery Centers are likely to cause class members to suffer \n16  deterioration in their mental status, an increase in symptoms of their mental illness, and increased \n17  impairment in their ability to relate to others.  This will expose them to a serious risk of family \n18  break-up if they are unable to care for minor children or dependent adults.  Foster care placements \n19  may increase. \n20  83.  Many physicians are unable and/or unwilling to prescribe psychotropic \n21  medications for patients or to manage their medications over a period of time.  Meanwhile, many \n22  patients with psychiatric disabilities will not take their medications without day-to-day support.  \n23  Even if the County opens up new clinics in the upcoming months and schedules appointments for \n24  people, many individuals will not come to these appointments without case management, which is \n25  why Defendants started the RSTs in the first place in the 1990s.   \n26  84.  If terminated from their current providers on June 30, 2010, Plaintiffs will be \n27  unable to access replacement mental health services.  They are among the most vulnerable \n28  members of society.  Many of them do not have telephones, internet access or access to \n  18    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 21 of 35\n1  transportation, and as a result it will be difficult, if not impossible, for them to learn what \n2  alternative plans (if any) have been made for them or to travel to the locations of new treatment \n3  centers (if any), in contrast to the ability of RST staff, until now, to travel to meet with them.  \n4  Many of them have great difficulty learning to place trust in others, which is a necessity for \n5  effective treatment, and an abrupt termination of services announced by Defendants will have \n6  severe psychiatric and emotional impacts on them.   \n7  85.   Beginning June 30, 2010, some class members are likely to stop taking their \n8  medications and attending their counseling sessions and, as a consequence, will become \n9  delusional, suicidal, or otherwise present a danger to themselves and others.  They may become \n10  so disoriented that they no longer carry out normal activities of daily living, and are unable to \n11  shop, cook food, clean their homes and clothing, dress, bathe, and care for themselves.  This will \n12  place them at risk of physical illness and injury.  \n13  86.  A decline in class members’ mental status will also place them at a serious risk of \n14  losing their current housing situations and ultimately becoming homeless.  In addition, the RST \n15  programs are currently required to sign off on supported housing placements for some class \n16  members and so those individuals will be at risk of losing their housing unless the County \n17  assumes this critical task after June 30.  \n18  87.  The impending disruptions in the mental health services and treatment are likely to \n19  cause some class members to experience crises so severe that they present a danger to themselves \n20  or others.  This will place class members at great risk of attempting suicide or even death and will \n21  require their emergency psychiatric hospitalization.  \n22  88.   The closure of the RST programs and the TCORE program and the drastic \n23  reductions in the Wellness and Recovery Centers are also likely to place class members at great \n24  risk of unwanted institutionalization in other psychiatric facilities, including hospitals, psychiatric \n25  health facilities, locked psychiatric nursing homes and other institutions. \n26  89.  Out-of-home placement in an institution can often further destabilize already \n27  compromised mental or physical functioning.  Once placed in an institution, it is extremely \n28  difficult for individuals to move out of institutions and back into the community. \n  19    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 22 of 35\n1  90.  It costs far more to institutionalize individuals with mental illness than it does to \n2  provide outpatient mental health services that allow them to live in community-based settings. \n3  91.  The impending cuts in mental health services will not only harm the clients of the \n4  RST programs, the TCORE program and the Wellness and Recovery Centers, but will also \n5  destabilize the entire system for all Medi-Cal recipients in need of mental health services from the \n6  County.   The Access line and local emergency rooms will not be able to absorb the increased \n7  demand for services.   \n \n8  LEGAL CLAIMS \n9  92.  Defendants’ actions, as alleged herein, have resulted in, and will continue to result \n10  in, irreparable injury to Plaintiffs and members of the Class for which they have no plain, speedy, \n11  or adequate remedy at law.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class will suffer irreparable injury in \n12  that they will be deprived of critical mental health treatment and subjected to imminent risk of \n13  out-of-home placement, institutionalization and/or harm to their health and safety. \n14  93.  An actual controversy exists between Plaintiffs and Defendants in that Defendants \n15  are seeking to implement reductions and terminations in Medi-Cal mental health services to \n16  which members of the Class are entitled, and which, if implemented, will place members of the \n17  Class at risk of unnecessary emotional and physical suffering, illness, out-of-home placement, \n18  institutionalization and harm to their physical and mental health.  Further, these reductions and \n19  terminations violate the ADA, Section 504, various provisions of the Medicaid Act, and the Due \n20  Process Clauses of the United States and California Constitutions.  Plaintiffs therefore seek a \n21  declaration as to their rights and Defendants’ corresponding duties with respect to the matters \n22  alleged herein. \n23  94.  The balance of harms favors entering an injunction because the harm suffered by \n24  individuals deprived of crucial and needed mental health treatment outweighs any monetary loss \n25  to Defendants.  \n26  95.  It is in the public interest that the Court grant an injunction to ensure that Plaintiffs \n27  and other similarly-situated individuals continue to receive, without interruption, medically \n28  necessary mental health services to which they are entitled. \n  20    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 23 of 35\n1  96.  In taking the relevant actions, Defendants have acted under color of state law. \n2   \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n3  Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12134-35 et seq. \n4  97.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation \n5  and paragraph set forth previously.  \n6  98.    Each Named Plaintiff and member of the Class is a “qualified individual with a \n7  disability” within the meaning of the ADA in that they (1) have mental impairments that \n8  substantially limit one or more major life activities; and (2) meet the essential eligibility \n9  requirements for Medi-Cal specialty mental health services under the Mental Health Plan.  \n10  99.  Defendants County and DBHS are public entities within the meaning of Title II of \n11  the ADA. \n12  100.  Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, \n13  by reason of disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, \n14  programs, or activities of a public entity or be subjected to discrimination by such entity.”  42 \n15  U.S.C. § 12132. \n16  101.  In enacting the ADA, Congress found that “[i]ndividuals with disabilities \n17  continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including . . . segregation . . . .”  42 U.S.C. \n18  § 12101(a)(5). \n19  102.  Regulations implementing Title II of the ADA provide:  “A public entity shall \n20  administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \n21  needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n22  103.  The United States Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. \n23  581 (1999), held that the unnecessary institutionalization of individuals with disabilities is a form \n24  of discrimination under Title II of the ADA.  The Supreme Court interpreted the ADA’s \n25  “integration mandate” as requiring persons with disabilities to be served in the community when:  \n26  (1) the state determines that community-based treatment is appropriate; (2) the individual does \n27  not oppose community placement; and (3) community placement can be reasonably \n28  accommodated.  Id. at 607. \n  21    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 24 of 35\n1  104.  Regulations implementing Title II of the ADA provide:  “A public entity may not, \n2  directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or other methods of \n3  administration:  (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to \n4  discrimination on the basis of disability; [or] (ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or \n5  substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the entity’s program with respect to \n6  individuals with disabilities. . . .”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3). \n7  105.   Regulations implementing Title II further require a public entity to “make \n8  reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are \n9  necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can \n10  demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, \n11  program, or activity.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n12  106.  Finally, Title II regulations provide that a public entity “may not, in determining \n13  the site or location of a facility, make selections (i) That have the effect of excluding individuals \n14  with disabilities from, denying them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting them to \n15  discrimination; or (ii) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the \n16  accomplishment of the objectives of the service, program, or activity with respect to individuals \n17  with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(4). \n18  107.  Pursuant to the ADA, public entities are required to provide meaningful access to \n19  their programs, services and activities, and provide any accommodations or modifications \n20  necessary for people with disabilities to access those services.  \n21  108.  Defendants’ actions discriminate against Plaintiffs and members of the Class by, \n22  including but not limited to, engaging in the following actions or inactions in violation of the \n23  ADA and implementing regulations: \n24  A.  Denying class members access to necessary mental health services because \n25  either there are no mental health services in place, or replacement services \n26  are sorely inadequate, in combination with insufficient transition planning, \n27  so as to effectively deny individuals the opportunity to benefit or \n28  participate in the program; \n  22    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 25 of 35\n1  B.  Failing to provide services in the most integrated setting by denying or \n2  impeding access to community-based mental health care to class members \n3  and placing them at risk of institutionalization, hospitalization and other \n4  harm because without the outpatient services which they require, they will \n5  experience repeated emotional crises, the loss of their therapeutic support \n6  and an increase in the symptoms of their mental illness; \n7  C.  Failing to provide accommodations and/or modifications to the program \n8  including transition planning and assuring that replacement services are in \n9  fact provided and in place, without interruption, prior to terminating \n10  current mental health care; \n11  D.  Using methods of administration that defeat the purpose of the program, \n12  including:  failing to provide individual transition plans based on client \n13  needs (e.g., transportation, identification of alternative providers, transition \n14  time to ensure that clients are able to access replacement services and \n15  providers, and provisions to individuals who have difficulty with \n16  transition), failing to make sure that replacement services are in place, \n17  without interruption, prior to termination, and failing to make sure that new \n18  services are sufficient to meet the needs of current and wait listed clients;    \n19  E.  Closing RST sites that are currently accessible and available throughout the \n20  county, and failing to relocate services and programs in sites that are \n21  accessible to class members. \n \n22   \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n23  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq. \n24  109.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation \n25  and paragraph set forth previously.   \n26  110.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, on which the ADA is modeled, sets \n27  forth similar protections against discrimination by recipients of federal funds, such as Defendants \n28  herein.  29 U.S.C. §§ 794-794a.  These protections include the prohibition against unnecessary \n  23    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 26 of 35\n1  segregation.  Regulations implementing Section 504 require that a public entity administer its \n2  services, programs and activities in “the most integrated setting appropriate” to the needs of \n3  qualified individuals with disabilities.  45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(2). \n4  111.  Section 504’s regulations prohibit recipients of federal financial assistance from \n5  “utiliz[ing] criteria or methods of administration (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified \n6  handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap [or] (ii) that have the purpose or \n7  effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient’s \n8  program with respect to handicapped persons . . . .”  45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4). \n9  112.  Similar to the ADA, Section 504 regulations require that Defendants refrain from \n10  selecting facility sites which have a discriminatory effect on participants.  45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(5).    \n11  113.    Each Plaintiff and member of the Class is a “qualified individual with a \n12  disability” within the meaning of Section 504 in that they (1) have mental impairments that \n13  substantially limit one or more major life activities; and (2) meet the essential eligibility \n14  requirements for Medi-Cal specialty mental health services under the Mental Health Plan.   \n15  114.  Pursuant to Section 504, recipients of federal financial assistance are required to \n16  provide meaningful access to their programs, services and activities, and provide any \n17  accommodations or modifications necessary for people with disabilities to access those services.  \n18  115.  Defendants’ actions discriminate against Plaintiffs and members of the Class by, \n19  including but not limited to, engaging in the following actions or inactions in violation of Section \n20  504 and implementing regulations: \n21  A.  Denying class members access to necessary mental health services because \n22  either there are no mental health services in place, or replacement services \n23  are sorely inadequate, in combination with insufficient transition planning, \n24  so as to effectively deny individuals the opportunity to benefit or \n25  participate in the program; \n26  B.  Failing to provide services in the most integrated setting by denying or \n27  impeding access to community-based mental health care to class members \n28 \n  24    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 27 of 35\n1  and placing them at risk of institutionalization, hospitalization and other \n2  harm; \n3  C.  Failing to provide accommodations and/or modifications to the program \n4  including transition planning and assuring that replacement services are in \n5  fact provided and in place, without interruption, prior to terminating \n6  current mental health care; \n7  D.  Using methods of administration that defeat the purpose of the program, \n8  including:  failing to provide individual transition plans based on client \n9  needs (e.g., transportation, identification of alternative providers, transition \n10  time to ensure that clients are able to access replacement services and \n11  providers, and provisions to individuals who have difficulty with \n12  transition), failing to make sure that replacement services are in place, \n13  without interruption, prior to termination, and failing to make sure that new \n14  services are sufficient to meet the needs of current and wait listed clients;   \n15  E.  Closing RST sites that are currently accessible and available throughout the \n16  county, and failing to relocate services and programs in sites that are \n17  accessible to class members. \n \n18   \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n19  Medicaid Act Sufficiency Requirement  \n20  116.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation \n21  and paragraph set forth previously. \n22  117.  Under federal Medicaid requirements, states must provide “sufficient” benefits. \n23  That is, “[e]ach service must be sufficient in amount, duration, and scope to reasonably achieve \n24  its purpose.” 42 C.F.R. § 440.230(b). \n25  118.  By terminating and reducing Medi-Cal funded mental health services to  \n26  individuals for whom such services have been found to be medically necessary, Defendants’ \n27  actions will result in insufficient services to fulfill the purpose of the Medi-Cal mental health \n28  benefit. \n  25    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 28 of 35\n1  119.  The proposed terminations and reduction of Medi-Cal funded mental health \n2  services is inconsistent with the federal law and preempted by the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. \n3  Constitution (U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 2).   \n \n4   \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n5  Medicaid Act Comparability Requirement \n6  120.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation \n7  and paragraph set forth previously.   \n8  121.  Under federal Medicaid requirements, states must provide comparable benefits, \n9  i.e., benefits that are equal in “amount, duration and scope,” to all categorically needy Medicaid \n10  beneficiaries.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a (a)(10)(B)(ii); 42 C.F.R. §§ 440.240(a), (b)(1).  Categorically \n11  needy Medicaid beneficiaries are beneficiaries who, in most cases, receive cash public assistance \n12  to meet basic needs.   \n13  122.  The Medicaid Act also requires states to provide comparable benefits to all \n14  medically needy Medicaid beneficiaries.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a (a)(10)(B)(ii); 42 C.F.R. § \n15  440.240(b)(1).  Medically needy Medicaid beneficiaries are beneficiaries who do not receive cash \n16  public assistance because they have income or resources in excess of the requirements for receipt \n17  of such assistance, but who nevertheless meet categorical requirements for such assistance, e.g., \n18  they are over age 65, blind, or disabled.   \n19  123.  States may provide benefits to the medically needy that are less in amount, \n20  duration and scope than benefits to the categorically needy, but California has not elected to do \n21  so.   \n22  124.  Therefore (with certain exceptions for some groups not relevant here), Medi-Cal \n23  recipients in one county must be provided with Medicaid benefits that are equal in amount, \n24  duration and scope to eligible beneficiaries in other counties.  The only permissible basis for \n25  distinguishing among such beneficiaries is differing levels of need. \n26  125.  As a result of the proposed reduction in Medi-Cal mental health services in \n27  Sacramento County, Defendants will provide Medicaid benefits to recipients in Sacramento \n28  County that are not comparable to those provided to recipients in other counties.  The proposed \n  26    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 29 of 35\n1  terminations and reduction thus violate Medicaid’s comparability requirement, 42 U.S.C. § \n2  1396a(a)(10)(B)(i). \n3  126.  Defendants’ actions deprive Plaintiffs and members of the Class of rights, \n4  privileges or immunities secured to them by the Constitution of the United States, in violation of \n5  42 U.S.C. § 1983, and are preempted by the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution (U.S. \n6  CONST. art. VI, cl. 2).  \n7   \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n8  Medicaid Reasonable Standards Requirement \n9  127.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation \n10  and paragraph set forth previously. \n11  128.  Federal Medicaid law requires participating states to establish reasonable \n12  standards, consistent with the objectives of the Medicaid Act, for determining the extent of \n13  covered services.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(17).    \n14  129.  The proposed terminations and reductions of Medi-Cal mental health services will \n15  deny medically necessary care to clients of the RSTs, who are the most severely mentally ill \n16  clients in the County and who are the least able to cope with the loss of their existing services.  In \n17  making these cuts, Defendants have failed to utilize a fair or reasonable measure of need for \n18  services.   \n19  130.  Defendants’ proposed terminations and reductions of Medi-Cal funded mental \n20  health services are inconsistent and in conflict with the reasonable standards requirements of the \n21  federal Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(17), and interpretive federal guidelines, and is thus \n22  preempted by the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution (U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 2). \n \n23   \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n24  Constitutional Due Process  \n25  131.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation \n26  and paragraph set forth previously.   \n27 \n28 \n  27    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 30 of 35\n1  132.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class are entitled to adequate notice of and \n2  opportunity for a pre-termination or pre-reduction hearing on any termination or reduction in \n3  medical care and services.  See Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970).   \n4  133.   On information and belief, if Defendants provide any notice at all, they will do so \n5  ten days before the planned terminations and the notice will not inform Plaintiffs of their right to \n6  appeal the termination and to have their services continue pending the outcome of the hearing.   \n7  134.  On information and belief, if Defendants provide any notice at all, this notice of \n8  the planned terminations of mental health services will not be adequate or effective in light of \n9  Plaintiffs’ circumstances.  Defendants will not inform Plaintiffs of the alternative services that are \n10  available to them and whether these are equivalent to the services being terminated.  Defendants \n11  will not provide Plaintiffs and class members with meaningful information necessary to \n12  determine whether they should request a hearing to context the terminations.  \n13  135.  On information and belief, if Defendants provide any notice at all, notice that is \n14  provided ten days prior to the planned terminations of mental health services is not adequate or \n15  effective.  Ten days is not sufficient time for Plaintiffs and other class members, who are \n16  individuals with mental illness, to determine whether they should appeal the decision to terminate \n17  their services and how to submit such an appeal.  Because of their mental illness, Plaintiffs will \n18  need to obtain the assistance of case managers, family members or others in order to determine \n19  whether to appeal.  They must also determine whether any alternative services offered to them are \n20  equivalent to those being terminated, whether they are actually available and whether they are \n21  accessible to Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs will require more than ten days for this process.   \n22  136.  On information and belief, if Defendants provide any notice at all, they will not \n23  inform Plaintiffs and class members of their right to continued services pending the outcome of \n24  their appeal, nor will they agree to continue services pending the hearings. \n25  137.  Unless enjoined, Defendants will reduce or terminate Medi-Cal services to which \n26  members of the Class are entitled and have a property interest in maintaining, thereby depriving \n27  class members of their right to an opportunity for fair hearing before reduction or termination of \n28  benefits.   \n  28    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 31 of 35\n1  138.  These actions violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n2  U.S. Constitution (U.S. CONST. Amend. XIV), as well as the Due Process Clauses of the \n3  California Constitution (Cal. CONST. art. I, §§ 7, 15). \n4  139.  Defendants’ actions deprive Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class of rights, \n5  privileges or immunities secured to them by the Constitution of the United States, in violation of \n6  42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n \n7   \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n8  Medicaid Act Right to a Fair Hearing  \n9  140.   Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation \n10  and paragraph set forth previously. \n11  141.  Under federal Medicaid requirements, recipients and applicants for Medicaid \n12  services have rights to written notice and a pre-termination fair hearing if their benefits are \n13  reduced, suspended, or terminated.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3).  \n14  142.  This notice must contain the following: \n15  (a)  A statement of what action the State . . . intends to take; \n16  (b)  The reasons for the intended action; \n17  (c)  The specific regulations that support, or the change in Federal or State law that \n18  requires, the action; \n19  (d)  An explanation of– \n20  (1)  The individual’s right to request an evidentiary hearing if one is available, \n21  or a State agency hearing; or \n22  (2)  In cases of an action based on a change in law, the circumstances under \n23  which a hearing will be granted; and \n24  (e)  An explanation of the circumstances under which Medicaid is continued if a \n25  hearing is requested. \n26  42 C.F.R. § 431.210. \n27 \n28 \n  29    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 32 of 35\n1  143.  If the agency mails the notice of action and the recipient requests a hearing before \n2  the date of action, the “agency may not terminate or reduce services until a decision is rendered \n3  after the hearing” except in circumstances not applicable to this case.  42 C.F.R. § 431.230(a). \n4  144.  Pursuant to the Medicaid Act, California has established procedures to provide fair \n5  hearings to any Medi-Cal beneficiary whose services are terminated, reduced, or denied.  Cal. \n6  Code Regs. tit. 22, § 51014.1(a).  The state regulations provide, in pertinent part, that a Medi-Cal \n7  managed care plan shall send a notice in writing to Medi-Cal recipients of “[a]ny intended  \n8  action . . . to terminate or reduce any medical service.”   Id., § 5104.1(a)(2).  These state \n9  regulations impose essentially the same requirements as the above-mentioned federal regulations \n10  in terms of the contents of the notice of action.  Id., § 51014.1(c)(1)-(6).  In general, this written \n11  notice shall be mailed to the Medi-Cal beneficiary “at least 10 days before the effective date of \n12  action.”  Id., § 51014.1(c). \n13  145.  In reducing or terminating services as set forth above, Defendants have deprived \n14  Plaintiffs and members of the Class of their opportunity to notice and a fair pre-termination \n15  hearing in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3) and 42 C.F.R. § 431.210. \n16  146.  Defendants’ actions deprive Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class of rights, \n17  privileges or immunities secured to them by the Constitution of the United States, in violation of \n18  42 U.S.C. § 1983, and are preempted by the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution (U.S. \n19  CONST. art. VI, cl. 2). \n20   \nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n21  California Government Code § 11135 \n22  147.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \n23  foregoing paragraphs. \n24  148.  Section 11135(a) of the California Government Code provides in pertinent part:  \n25  “No person in the State of California shall, on the basis of . . . disability, be unlawfully denied the \n26  benefits of, or be unlawfully subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity that is \n27  funded directly by the state or receives any financial assistance from the state.” \n28 \n  30    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 33 of 35\n1  149.  At all times relevant to this action, Defendant DBHS has been an agency of \n2  Defendant County.  At all times relevant to this action, DBHS and the County received financial \n3  assistance from the State of California. \n4  150.  Through their acts and omissions described herein, Defendants have violated and \n5  continue to violate California Government Code Section 11135 by unlawfully denying Plaintiffs \n6  the benefits of, and unlawfully subjecting Plaintiffs to discrimination under, Defendants’ \n7  programs and activities. \n8  151.  Plaintiffs and class members further allege that violations of their rights under the \n9  Americans with Disabilities Act and implementing regulations contained in the First Claim for \n10  Relief are incorporated herein and constitute a violation of California Government Code Section \n11  11135 et seq. as well, as set forth in section 11135(b). \n12  152.  Because Defendants’ discriminatory conduct is ongoing, declaratory and \n13  injunctive relief are appropriate remedies.  Moreover, as a result of Defendants’ actions Plaintiffs \n14  are suffering irreparable harm, and thus immediate relief is appropriate. \n15  REQUEST FOR RELIEF \n16  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that the Court order the following relief and remedies on \n17  behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated: \n18  a)  Assume jurisdiction over this action and maintain continuing jurisdiction until \n19  Defendants are in full compliance with every order of this Court; \n20  b)  Certify this action as a class action and appoint the individual named Plaintiffs as \n21  Class representatives; \n22  c)  Declare that the proposed termination and reduction of Medi-Cal funded mental \n23  health services and Defendants’ policies, practices, acts and omissions as set forth above violate \n24  the American with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Medicaid Act \n25  (sufficiency, comparability, reasonable standards and reasonable fair hearing), the Due Process \n26  Clauses of the United States and California Constitution, California Government Code § 11135, \n27  and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and are preempted by the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution (U.S. \n28  CONST. art. VI, cl. 2).  \n  31    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 34 of 35\n1  d)  Grant a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants, their officers, \n2  agents, employees, attorneys, and all persons who are in active concert or participation with them \n3  from terminating and reducing medically necessary Medi-Cal funded mental health services \n4  without first:   \n5  (i)  Demonstrating that alternative services sufficient to meet the needs of \n6  Plaintiffs and other class members are currently available;  \n7  (ii)  Providing a process of transition to any alternative services that meets the \n8  needs of Plaintiffs and other class members and is consistent with \n9  minimum professional standards;   \n10  (iii)  Providing adequate and effective written notice of the proposed termination \n11  and reduction of Medi-Cal funded mental health services, and notice of the \n12  right to appeal these actions and of the right to continued benefits pending \n13  an appeal hearing;  \n14  (iv)  Providing accommodations in the form of case management and other \n15  assistance for Plaintiffs and class members that will enable them to \n16  participate in the process of transition and in exercising their right to \n17  appeal.  \n18  /// \n19  /// \n20  /// \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  32    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01119-JAM-EFB   Document 1   Filed 05/06/10   Page 35 of 35\n1  e)  Award the Plaintiffs the costs of this action and reasonable attorneys’ fees \n2  pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 794a; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1988, 12133, 12205; California Code of Civil \n3  Procedure § 1021.5; and as otherwise may be allowed by law. \n4  f)  All such other and further relief as the Court deems to be just and equitable. \n5  Dated: May 6, 2010  Respectfully submitted,\n \n6 \n7  COOLEY LLP \n8 \n9  By:  /s/ William S.
