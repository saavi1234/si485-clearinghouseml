    "summary": "<p>On April 30, 2003, LGBT advocacy organizations, represented by Lambda Legal and the ACLU, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska, against the Attorney General of Nebraska challenging the federal constitutionality of Article I, Section 29 of the Nebraska Constitution.  Section 29 prohibits government recognition of the \"uniting of two persons of the same sex in a civil union, domestic partnership, or other similar same-sex relationship.\" The plaintiffs sought to have Section 29 declared unlawful as a denial of equal protection and a bill of attainder. </p><p>On June 30, 2003, the Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing, the case was unripe, and the cause for action for bill of attainder should be dismissed. The District Court (Judge Joseph F. Bataillon) denied the motion on November 10, 2003. Citizens for Equal Protection, Inc., v. Bruning, 290 F.Supp.2d 1004.</p><p>On May 12, 2005, the Court ruled that Section 29 violated the Constitution of the United States. Citizens for Equal Protection, Inc., v. Bruning, 368 F.Supp.2d 980. The Court first found that Section 29 deprived same-sex couples of the right to associational freedom and the right to participate in the political process, both protected by the First Amendment, and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Finding no rational relationship between Section 29 and any legitimate state interest, the Court held that Section 29 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, the Court concluded that Section 29 amounts to punishment by legislation as it operates to prohibit persons in same-sex relationships from working to ever obtain governmental benefits or legal recognition, and thus was an unconstitutional bill of attainder. The Court permanently enjoined the enforcement of Section 29 and on August 1, 2005, granted the plaintiffs' motion for attorneys fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. </p><p>The Attorney General filed a notice of appeal on June 9, 2005. On July 14, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (Judge James B. Loken) reversed the District Court on all three of its conclusions, as well as the award of the plaintiffs' attorneys fees. Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning, 455 F.3d 859. The Court held that sexual orientation was not a suspect classification and thus Section 29 was not entitled to be subjected strict scrutiny. Under the alternative standard of rational basis review, the Court held Section 29 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Court found the bill of attainder claim to be without merit, and found that Section 29 did not violate the First Amendment because it does not directly and substantially interfere with plaintiffs' ability to associate in pursuit of a common goal, and it seems unlikely it will prevent persons from continuing to associate. </p><p>The plaintiffs sought rehearing en banc; the Eighth Circuit denied that motion on August 30, 2006. The plaintiffs did not file a petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, and the case was dismissed with prejudice on January 4, 2007.</p>",

The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, asserting that Section 29 violated the Equal Protection clause under the Fourteenth Amendment and was a bill of attainder.\r\n\r\nOn May 12, the District Court held that Section 29 violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and was a bill of attainder, and therefore was unconstitutional and awarded the plaintiffs attorneys fees. On appeal, the Eighth Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's decision on all counts. The appellate court held that because sexual orientation was not a suspect classification, Section 29 only needed to pass rational basis review, which the Court held it did. The case was dismissed with prejudice on January 4, 2007. ",

The ripeness doctrine is aimed at preventing \nI, § 29 of the Nebraska Constitution, providing:  federal  courts,  through  premature  adjudication,  from \n“entangling  themselves  in  abstract  disagreements.” \nOnly marriage between a man and  Thomas v.

For these reasons, \nand lesbian citizens of Nebraska commenced this action  we conclude that, whatever the merits of their claims, \nagainst the Governor and the Attorney General in their  Appellees  have  standing  to  raise  the  claims  and  the \nofficial capacities seeking an order declaring that § 29  dispute is, at least in part, ripe for review. \nviolates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  and  is  an    \nunconstitutional  bill  of  attainder,  and  permanently  [4] The amicus brief submitted by eleven States makes an \nenjoining its enforcement. The district court denied the  additional jurisdictional argument-that Appellees’ claims \nState’s  motion  to  dismiss  for  lack  of  standing  and  are not justiciable because neither the Governor nor the \nripeness. Citizens for Equal Protection, Inc. v. Bruning,  Attorney General is responsible for the alleged injury § 29 \n290  F.Supp.2d  1004  (D.Neb.2003).

Under  Nebraska  law,  the  Governor  and  the  Attorney \n   General  have  broad  powers  to  enforce  the  State’s \n  Constitution and statutes. See Neb. Const.

Of \n[1] [2] On appeal, the State renews its contentions that  course, § 29 does not require affirmative enforcement by \nAppellees  lack  standing  to  raise  these  constitutional  any state official; it functions as a barrier to government \nclaims and that the claims are not ripe for review. Like the  action that Appellees desire. The amicus brief argues that \ndistrict  court,  we  disagree.  The  State  argues  that  § 29 may be challenged, for example, by a suit to compel \nAppellees lack standing-their members have suffered no  a county clerk to marry two same-sex partners. But that \ninjury in fact because marriage and domestic partnership  argument conflates the distinction noted in N.E.

Here, as we have explained, \nresults  through  other  means.  However,  when  the  Appellees have standing to challenge the barrier, and the \ngovernment erects a barrier making it more difficult for  dispute is ripe for review. Although one may question \nmembers of a group to obtain a benefit, “[t]he ‘injury in  whether enjoining these two state officers would fully \nfact’ ... is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the  redress Appellees’ alleged injuries, we agree with the \nimposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to  concession implicit in the State’s decision not to press this \nobtain  the  benefit.”  N.E.  Fla.  Chapter  of  the  Assoc.  issue-the Governor and the Attorney General have “some \nGeneral Contractors of Am. v.

Appellees do not assert a right to marriage or \nrelationships” to be the basis for a claim of “minority \nsame-sex unions. Rather, they seek “a level playing field, \nstatus,  quota  preferences,  protected  status  or  claim  of \nan equal opportunity to convince the people’s elected \ndiscrimination.” The amendment invalidated certain local \nrepresentatives that same-sex relationships deserve legal \nordinances  prohibiting  discrimination  on  the  basis  of \nprotection.” Citizens for Equal Protection, 368 F.Supp.2d \nsexual orientation. The Colorado Supreme Court held that \nat 985 n. 1. The argument turns on the fact that § 29 is an \nany  constitutional  amendment  that  infringes  on  “the \namendment to the Nebraska Constitution. Unlike state-\nfundamental right to participate equally in the political \nwide  legislation  restricting  marriage  to  a  man  and  a \nprocess [by] ‘fencing out’ an independently identifiable \nwoman, a constitutional amendment deprives gays and \nclass of persons must be subject to strict judicial scrutiny” \nlesbians of “equal footing in the political arena” because \nunder the Equal Protection Clause of the United States \nstate and local government officials now lack the power \nConstitution.

The court appreciates their participation. \n \n2  Constitutional provisions that prohibit certain activities disadvantage the class of persons who wish to engage in the activity. For \nexample, Article III, § 24, of the Nebraska Constitution forbids “games of chance.” Does § 24 deny casino operators equal \nprotection because they, unlike other businesses, must repeal a constitutional amendment to legalize the activities they wish to \nconduct? Note, too, that the equal-access theory urged by Appellees would likewise apply to a state statute that limits the policies \nand laws municipalities may adopt. See Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 477, 102 S.Ct. 3187, 73 L.Ed.2d 896 \n(1982). \n \n3  When the Supreme Court invalidated a state law criminalizing sodomy in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 \nL.Ed.2d 508 (2003), only Justice O’Connor relied on the Equal Protection Clause, rather than the substantive component of the \nDue Process Clause. Of particular relevance to this case, Justice O’Connor concluded that moral disapproval of private, consensual \nhomosexual conduct “is an interest that is insufficient to satisfy rational basis review under the Equal Protection Clause,” but she \nexpressly noted that “other reasons exist [for the State] to promote the institution of marriage beyond mere moral disapproval of an \nexcluded group.” 539 U.S. at 582, 585, 123 S.Ct. 2472 (O’Connor, J., concurring). The Lawrence majority, too, was careful to note \nthat the Texas statute at issue “does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that \nhomosexual persons seek to enter.” Id. at 578, 123 S.Ct. 2472. \n \n4  The court cited Art. I, § 9, cl. 3, of the Constitution, a section that applies only to Congress. We assume the court meant to cite Art. \nI, § 10, which bars the States from passing bills of attainder. The two provisions are construed identically. See Crain v. City of \nMountain Home, 611 F.2d 726, 728-29 (8th Cir.1979); Kerr-McGee Chem. Corp. v. Edgar, 837 F.Supp. 927, 934 n. 6 \n(N.D.Ill.1993). \n \n \n\n \n5  The Supreme Court has frequently defined a bill of attainder as “a law that legislatively determines guilt and inflicts punishment” \nwithout a judicial trial. Nixon v. Adm’r of Gen. Servs., 433 U.S. 425, 468, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977), and cases cited. If \na legislative determination of “guilt” is required, § 29 is clearly not a bill of attainder. But we will assume that punishment is the \ncritical issue. \n \n \n\t\r  \n \n \n\t\r  \n \n ",

BRUNING, in  ) \nhis official capacity; GOVERNOR MICHAEL O.  ) \nJOHANNS, in his official capacity,  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \n) \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Plaintiffs are Nebraska organizations that advocate for equality under the law as part of \ntheir missions and that have lesbian, gay and bisexual members.  Plaintiffs seek to have \nArticle I, Section 29 of the Nebraska Constitution (Section 29) declared unlawful as a denial \nof equal protection and a bill of attainder. \n2.  Section 29 prohibits government recognition of the \"uniting of two persons of the same \nsex in a civil union, domestic partnership, or other similar same-sex relationship,\" thereby \nbarring lesbian, gay and bisexual people from using the ordinary political process to seek \n1 \n\nimportant legal protections that all other Nebraskans already have or may seek without \nconstraint.  Section 29 applies at all levels of state and municipal government, imposing a \nspecial disability on people in same-sex relationships whether they seek protection for their \nrelationships from government employers, administrative agencies, cities, towns, or the state \nlegislature. \n3.  Section 29 prevents same-sex couples from securing protection against a wide array of \ninjuries that domestic partnership laws and policies are designed to address, including being \nprevented from visiting a same-sex partner in the hospital, making care decisions when a \nsame-sex partner is incapacitated, taking bereavement leave when a same-sex partner dies, or \nmaking funeral arrangements for a same-sex partner after death. \n4.  In this lawsuit, plaintiffs do not ask for marriage, civil unions or domestic partnerships. \nInstead, they seek nothing more - and nothing less -than a level playing field, an equal \nopportunity to convince the people's elected representatives that same-sex relationships \ndeserve legal protection.  This lawsuit is about equal access, not guaranteed success, in the \npolitical arena. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 to redress the deprivation \nunder color of state law of rights secured by the United States Constitution. \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.  Jurisdiction to grant \nthe declaratory reliefrequested is provided by 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n2 \n\n7.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.c. § l391(b) because the defendants \nreside within the district and a substantial part of the events giving rise to plaintiffs' claims \noccurred in this district. \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff CITIZENS FOR EQUAL PROTECTION, INC. (CFEP) is a non-profit \nmembership organization incorporated under the laws of Nebraska in 1993.  CFEP's mission \nis to eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation through legislation and education. \nCFEP is a grassroots lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization.  CFEP \nhas lesbian, gay and bisexual members, including members who are lesbian, gay or bisexual \npublic employees. \n9.  Plaintiff NEBRASKA ADVOCATES FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY (NA1E) is a \nnon-profit membership organization incorporated under the laws of Nebraska.  NA1E \nincorporated three years ago in response to the anti-gay campaign in support of Section 29, \nand its mission is to advocate, at all levels of government, for legislation that would advance \nthe social, economic and educational interests of people who are discriminated against or \ndenied the equal protection of the laws.  NA1E's primary activity is lobbying against \nlegislation that discriminates based on sexual orientation or gender identity and in favor of \nlegislation that protects the civil and political rights oflesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender \nNebraskans.  NAffi has lesbian, gay and bisexual members, including members who are \nlesbian, gay or bisexual public employees. \n10.  Plaintiff ACLU NEBRASKA is a non-profit membership organization incorporated \nunder the laws of Nebraska.  ACLU NEBRASKA is committed to the protection of civil \n3 \n\nliberties of all persons, including rights secured by the Constitutions of the United States and \nthe State of Nebraska.  ACLU NEBRASKA works to protect and promote civil liberties \nthroughout the State of Nebraska.  ACLU Nebraska has worked to advance the civil liberties \nof gay, lesbian and bisexual Nebraskans by lobbying in support of bills that seek to extend \nlegal protections to lesbian, gay and bisexual people and against legislative efforts to \ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.  ACLU NEBRASKA has lesbian, gay and \nbisexual members, including members who are lesbian, gay or bisexual public employees. \n11.  Defendant JON C. BRUNING is sued in his official capacity as Attorney General of the \nState of Nebraska.  The Attorney General is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nand was acting under color of state law at all times relevant to this Complaint.  The Attorney \nGeneral is the chieflaw enforcement officer of the State, and is charged with enforcing the \nlaws of the State of Nebraska and with issuing opinions as to the constitutionality of \nproposed laws and acts of the State. \n12.  Defendant MICHAEL O. JOHANNS is sued in his official capacity as Governor of the \nState of Nebraska.  The Governor is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and \nwas acting under color of state law at all times relevant to this Complaint.  The Governor is \nresponsible for the civil administration of the laws of the State. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n13.  Initiative 416, which was signed into law by Governor Johanns on December 7, 2000, \namended the Nebraska Constitution's Bill of Rights, adding the following provision as \nArticle I, Section 29: \n4 \n\nOnly marriage between a man and a woman shall be valid \nor recognized in Nebraska.  The uniting of two persons of \nthe same sex in a civil union, domestic partnership, or other \nsimilar same-sex relationship shall not be valid or \nrecognized in Nebraska. \n14.  The constitutional barrier created by Section 29 is the only one of its kind in the nation. \nNo other state constitutionally prohibits state and local government officials from \nrecognizing same-sex relationships in any way, including as domestic partnerships. \n15.  Section 29 classifies people based on sexual orientation.  It singles out lesbian, gay and \nbisexual people by referring to a unique characteristic they share - participation in same-sex \nrelationships - and then uses that shared characteristic to deny them equal footing in the \npolitical arena.  While different-sex couples may seek and obtain legislation and government \nemployment policies that protect their domestic partnerships, same-sex couples are prevented \nfrom doing so. \n16.  The very purpose of Section 29 is to make it more difficult for lesbian, gay and bisexual \npeople than for all others to seek aid from the government, to make them unequal to \neveryone else.  Unlike other Nebraskans, who may seek relief at any level of government \nwhen they want to protect their relationships, same-sex couples are constitutionally barred \nfrom using ordinary political channels to obtain legal protection for their relationships. \n17.  Section 29 makes it futile to ask government officials for even the most basic protections \nfor people united in same-sex relationships, including the right and the responsibility to \nprovide for one another's basic living expenses, to make health care decisions for a partner \nwho is incapacitated, to visit a partner in the hospital and to make funeral arrangements when \na partner dies.  Other Nebraskans face no such constitutional barrier and may seek legal \n5 \n\nprotection for their relationships - including different-sex domestic partnerships - without \nconstraint. \n18.  The futility of seeking protection for people in same-sex relationships through ordinary \npolitical channels is underscored by the fate of a recent bill in the Nebraska legislature.  The \nbill proposed to allow both same-sex and different-sex couples to protect their families at the \nend of life by authorizing domestic partners to make decisions about funeral arrangements \nand organ donation.  In response to the bill, the Attorney General issued an opinion on March \n10, 2003 stating that the proposed law would be unconstitutional under Section 29 because it \n\"would create new rights which spring from recognition of a domestic partnership; a \npartnership which could comprise same sex couples.\" A copy of the proposed legislation \nreviewed by the Attorney General is incorporated by reference and attached as Exhibit A.  A \ncopy of the Attorney General's opinion on the proposed legislation is incorporated by \nreference and attached as Exhibit B. \n19.  Section 29 also denies lesbian, gay and bisexual state and local government employees a \nlevel playing field when they try to advocate directly with their employers for bereavement \nleave when a same-sex partner dies, family and medical leave when a same-sex partner is \nseriously ill or injured, health insurance for a same-sex partner, or any other form of \nprotection that requires recognition of a same-sex relationship.  Other public employees in \nNebraska face no such constitutional barrier and already have such protections for their \nrelationships or may seek them without constraint. \n20.  Recognition of domestic partnerships is widespread throughout the nation in both the \npublic and private sectors.  Over 150 local governments and agencies offer health benefits to \n6 \n\nsame-sex domestic partners of employees, and eleven state governments offer them, \nincluding Iowa.  Over 50 states and municipalities offer domestic partner registries, including \nIowa City, Iowa and St. Louis, Missouri.  In the private sector, more than 5,000 companies, \nand nearly 40% of Fortune 500 companies, recognize the domestic partnerships of same-sex \ncouples. \n21.  Guyla Mills, who led the petition drive to place Initiative 416 on the ballot and chaired \nthe Defense of Marriage Amendment Committee in support of Section 29, publicly explained \nthe purpose of Section 29 on numerous occasions prior to its passage.  Mills stated that \nSection 29 was intended to prevent \"the havoc that would result by putting 'homosexual \nmarriage' on the public policy freeway ... venturing down a path where children are taught \nin schools that homosexual and heterosexual marriage are equal ... where adoption into \nhomosexual homes is normalized.\"  Mills explained that the second sentence of Section 29 \nwas necessary \"to send a message to society about homosexuality ... that homosexuality and \nheterosexuality are not morally equivalent.\"  Mills stated that Section 29 was based on the \nprevailing morals of society and explained the importance of sending a strong message about \nhomosexuality, \"that homosexuality is a sin and should not be sanctioned even by 'quasi \nmarriage' unions such as domestic partnerships and civil unions.\"  Mills also stated that her \norganization chose to petition to amend the constitution rather than to amend state statutes to \nensure that their work would not be undermined in future elections. \n22.  Plaintiffs each have members who are lesbian, gay or bisexual Nebraskans in committed \nsame-sex relationships and members who plan to be in committed same-sex relationships in \nthe future.  Plaintiffs' members include the following same-sex couples: \n7 \n\na.  Dave Gilsdorf and his partner Robb Crouch are in their early thirties.  They have been in \na committed. loving relationship for over six years.  Dave grew up in North Platte, \nNebraska and works in Lincoln as a software developer with a private company.  Robb \nwas raised mainly in Des Moines, Iowa and is an assistant director of communications at \na non-profit foundation.  Dave and Robb are both close to their extended family \nmembers.  Last year, they hosted Thanksgiving for their extended family at their new \nhome.  Dave and Robb care and provide for one another and have made a commitment to \neach other that they will continue to do so, but Section 29 denies them equal footing in \ntheir efforts to obtain domestic partnership legislation that would allow them to take on \nthe legal rights and obligations to care for one another and to make important health care \nand funeral decisions with and for one another when one of them is incapacitated or dies. \nIn addition, Robb's employer participates in a state university insurance pool, and Section \n29 prevents Robb and Dave from advocating on equal footing for a policy that would \nallow Robb to provide health insurance for Dave should uncertain economic times and \njob loss mean that their family needs that safety net; for a policy that would allow Robb \nto take family and medical leave to care for Dave ifhe is injured or becomes seriously ill; \nor for a policy that would allow Robb to take bereavement leave to attend Dave's funeraL \nDave and Robb are members of CFEP, NAJE and ACLU NEBRASKA. \nb.  Judy Gibson is 62 and her partner Barbara DiBemard is 53.  They have been in a \ncommitted, loving relationship for over 14 years.  Judy is a therapist and has lived in \nLincoln since 1969.  Barbara has been an English professor at the University of \nNebraska-Lincoln since 1978.  Barbara and Judy became seriously involved in 1988 and \n8 \n\nbuilt a wheelchair-accessible house together in the early 1990s as part of their plan to \ndeal with Judy's degenerative illness.  Building the house together represented their \ncommitment that they would care for one another for the rest of their lives.  Judy and \nBarbara care and provide for one another and have made a commitment to one another \nthat they will continue to do so, but Section 29 denies them equal footing in their efforts \nto obtain domestic partnership legislation that will allow them to take on the legal rights \nand obligations to care for one another, to make health care and funeral decisions with \nand for one another when one of them becomes seriously ill or dies, and to pay third \nparties for debts incurred by the other for basic living expenses.  In addition, Section 29 \ndenies Judy and Barbara equal footing in their efforts to obtain state university policies \nthat protect their relationship.  For example, under Section 29, the university is not \npermitted to establish a policy allowing Barbara to take time off from work to take Judy \nto her regular medical and wheelchair maintenance appointments.  Judy and Barbara are \nalso concerned about planning for health insurance as they approach retirement.  Judy is \nnot eligible for health insurance through Barbara's state university employer, and Section \n29 prevents them from advocating on equal footing for a new university policy that \nwould allow Judy to participate in Barbara's health plan when they are ready to retire. \nThis is particularly important because Barbara's health insurance policy provides far \nbetter coverage than Judy can obtain through her current employer or on the private \ninsurance market.  Judy and Barbara are members ofCFEP, NAJE and ACLU \nNEBRASKA. \n9 \n\nc.  Nancy Brink and her partner Maria Perez will hold a commitment ceremony this summer \nat the North Side Christian Church in Omaha, where Nancy has been the minister for 15 \nyears.  Nancy was born in Louisiana, the daughter ofa minister, and moved to Omaha 15 \nyears ago after attending seminary in Tennessee and serving other congregations.  Maria \nwas born in Puerto Rico, taught science in public school for 15 years and now teaches \nSpanish to college students.  Nancy and Maria met at the national meeting for their \ndenomination, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and Maria now lives with \nNancy and her seven-year-old daughter.  Nancy shares the responsibilities of caring for \nher daughter with her former partner of 14 years, and Maria has become another parent to \nNancy's daughter.  Shortly before Nancy and Maria first met, Nancy underwent two \nsurgical procedures, and her experience in the hospital made her realize that she cannot \nbe sure that Maria will be permitted to make important medical decisions for her if \nanything happens in the future, or even that Maria will be permitted to visit her in the \nhospital during family visiting hours.  Nancy and Maria care and provide for one another \nand for Nancy's daughter and have made a commitment to one another that they will \ncontinue to do so, but Section 29 prevents them from advocating on equal footing for \nlegislation that will authorize them to take on the rights and responsibilities to care for \none another and to make important health care and funeral decisions with and for one \nanother when one of them becomes seriously ill or dies.  Nancy and Maria are members \nofCFEP and NAJE. \nd.  Jim Kieffer and his partner Gary Lopez are in their early forties and live in Omaha.  They \nhave been in a committed, loving relationship for over ten years and exchanged vows in a \n10 \n\ncommitment ceremony in November 1993.  Jim is a development consultant for a \nhealthcare company and Gary is a manager for a railroad.  Jim and Gary are both active \nin their church, and they spend much of their free time gardening at home and caring for \na close friend who is disabled.  lim and Gary care and provide for one another and have \nmade a commitment to one another that they will continue to do so, but Section 29 \nprevents them from advocating on equal footing for legislation that would allow them to \ntake on the legal rights and obligations to care for one another and to make important \nhealth care and funeral decisions with and for one another when one of them becomes \nincapacitated or dies.  Jim and Gary are members of CFEP and NAJE. \ne.  Donna Colley and Margaux Towne-Colley have been in a committed, loving relationship \nfor over six years and are the proud moms of their IS-month-old son.  Donna is a partner \nat a large law firm in Omaha, and Margaux is a full-time stay-at-home mom.  Donna and \nMargaux always wanted to have children, and they started their family soon after their \ncivil union ceremony.  Donna and Margaux fully understand the added responsibilities \nthat come with raising a child, including the need to plan for the possibility that one of \nthem will become incapacitated or die unexpectedly or even that their relationship will \nnot last for the rest of their lives.  Like other families, Donna and Margaux want to honor \ntheir personal responsibilities to their family and want to take on the legal obligation to \nfollow through with the fmancial, physical and emotional commitments they assumed \nwhen they decided to enter into a committed relationship and to have a child.  Donna and \nMargaux care and provide for one another and for their son and they have made a \ncommitment to one another that they will continue to do so, but Section 29 denies them \n11 \n\nequal footing in their efforts to obtain legislation that would allow them to take on the \nlegal rights and obligations to care for one another and to make important health care and \nfuneral decisions with and for one another if one of them becomes incapacitated or dies \nand that would obligate both Donna and Margaux to pay third parties for debts incurred \nby either partner for basic living expenses.  Donna and Margaux's concerns about \nfinancial responsibility to one another and to their son are of particular concern because \nof their decision that it was important for Margaux to be a full-time stay-at-home mom \nwithout an income or the means to obtain health-care insurance.  Section 29 prevents \nDonna and Margaux from using ordinary political channels to seek any form of \ngovernment protection for their family.  Donna and Margaux are members ofCFEP and \nNAIE. \n23.  But for the barrier created by Section 29, plaintiffs and their members, including those \nidentified in this Complaint, would work to convince state and local government in Nebraska \nto provide legal protections for people in committed same-sex relationships.  For example, \nplaintiffs and their members would advocate for state and local domestic partnership \nlegislation and associated protections for people in same-sex relationships, including \nenactment of their draft bill proposing a \"Financial Responsibility and Protection for \nDomestic Partners Act,\" which would make domestic partners responsible for each others' \nbasic living expenses and would automatically authorize a registered domestic partner to visit \na partner in the hospital, to make health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, and to \nmake decisions regarding organ donation and funeral arrangements when a partner passes \n12 \n\naway.  A copy of Plaintiffs' draft bill proposing a \"Financial Responsibility and Protection \nfor Domestic Partners Act\" is incorporated by reference and attached as Exhibit C. \n24.  But for the barrier created by Section 29, plaintiffs and their members, including those \nidentified in this Complaint, would advocate with public employers for the adoption of \npolicies to protect people in committed same-sex relationships.  For example, plaintiffs and \ntheir members would advocate for domestic partnership policies authorizing employees to \ntake family and medical leave to care for a same-sex partner and to take bereavement leave to \nattend a same sex partner's funeral on the same terms that such leave is available to care for \nand to grieve the loss of other employees' immediate family members. \n25.  While the foregoing paragraphs detail some of the legal protections plaintiffs and their \nmembers wish to seek in the political arena and from government employers, in this lawsuit \nplaintiffs seek nothing more than an equal opportunity to try to convince governmental \nemployers to adopt policies - and elected representatives to enact legislation - that would \nallow people in same-sex relationships to take on the rights and responsibilities that all other \nNebraskans in committed relationships already have or may seek without constraint. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Equal Protection) \n26.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 25 as if set forth in full. \n27.  Section 29 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution. \n28.  Section 29 is a literal violation of equal protection.  It imposes a special, broad and \nundifferentiated disability on lesbian, gay and bisexual people, disqualifying same-sex \n13 \n\ncouples when they seek protection for their committed relationships through the ordinary \npolitical process or from government employers while allowing others to enjoy or to seek \nsuch protection without constraint. \n29.  Section 29's unequal treatment of people in same-sex relationships is sweeping, barring \nany governmental recognition ofthe uniting of two persons of the same sex, including in a \ndomestic partnership, a civil union, or any other same-sex relationship. \n30.  Section 29 singles out one group of people for unequal treatment without sufficient \njustification and for the very purpose of making them unequal to everyone else. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Bill of Attainder) \n31.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 30 as if set forth in full. \n32.  Section 29 is a bill of attainder in violation of Article I, section 10 of the United States \nConstitution. \n33.  Section 29 legislatively punishes same-sex couples, including plaintiffs' members, based \non sexual orientation and without the protections of a judicial trial.  Section 29 specifically \ndesignates lesbian, gay and bisexual people by referring to a unique characteristic of the \ngroup - participation in same-sex relationships. \n34.  Section 29 disqualifies lesbian, gay and bisexual people from using ordinary political \nchannels to protect their same-sex relationships; disenfranchises them by barring their elected \nrepresentatives from advancing any city, state or local policies or legislation that requires \nrecognition of same-sex relationships; and excludes them from an important part of political \n14 \n\nlife by making it futile for them to participate in the democratic process in Nebraska in their \nefforts to obtain protection for same-sex relationships. \n35.  Section 29 deprives people in same-sex relationships of an essential component of \ncitizenship and damages their social, cultural and political existence. \n36.  Section 29 inflicts its deprivations on lesbian, gay and bisexual people in order to keep \nthem from bringing about what proponents of Section 29 considered to be unacceptable: \nrecognition by state or local government of the uniting of two persons of the same sex \nwhether in the fOIDl of a domestic partnership, a civil union, a marriage, or any other similar \nsame-sex relationship. \n37.  Section 29 was intended to punish lesbian, gay and bisexual people. \n38.  The punishment imposed by Section 29 is unconditional and furthers no non-punitive \npurpose. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter judgment: \n1.  Declaring that Article I, Section 29 of the Nebraska Constitution violates the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n2.  Declaring that Article I, Section 29 of the Nebraska Constitution is a bill of \nattainder in violation of Article I, section 10 of the United States Constitution; \n3.  Striking down and permanently enjoining enforcement of Article I, Section 29 of \nthe Nebraska Constitution; \n4.  Awarding Plaintiffs reasonable attorneys' fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988; \nand \n15 \n\n5.  Granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n5 . \nDated this ~ day of April,  ?too \nRobert F.

The court is not asked to decide whether a state has the right to define marriage in the context of same-sex and opposite-sex \nrelationships. \n \n2  After this lawsuit was filed, Governor Michael Johanns was appointed Secretary of Agriculture and Dave Heinemann became the \nGovernor of Nebraska. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(d), Governor Heinemann is substituted as party defendant. \n \n3  The parties have raised numerous objections to the admissibility of exhibits. The objections to any exhibits cited herein have been \nreviewed and are overruled. The court finds the exhibits cited herein are relevant. Further, the court generally notes that the parties’ \nobjections relate more to the weight to be afforded the evidence than to its admissibility. \n \n4  The proposed legislation defined “domestic partner” as “a person who was in a committed relationship with the deceased person.” \nEvidence to establish such a “committed relationship” included: longevity of the relationship; joint ownership of a home; joint \nrental agreements; joint loan obligations; joint bank accounts, credit cards, investments, leases of vehicles; joint utilities; \ndesignations of the other as a beneficiary, or personal representative of each other’s will; power of attorney for each other; or \nevidence the other was receiving domestic partner benefits from an employer. See Ex. 27. \n \n5  The court notes that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not necessarily require acknowledgment of marriages that occur in other \nstates. See Patrick J. Borchers, The Essential Irrelevance of the Full Faith and Credit Clause to the Same-Sex Marriage Debate, 38 \nCreighton Law Rev. 233, 353-364 (2005). \n \n   \n\n \n \n \n6  The parties also stipulated that the Unicameral amended Legislative Bill 95 with Amendment No. AM1980, which provided that \n“authorized persons” could provide for the dispositions of those who are deceased. See Exs. 35, 36, § 71-1339, p. 27. An \nauthorized person is defined as one who has an affidavit signed and sworn to by the decedent allowing for such disposition by that \nperson. Id. Governor Johanns approved LB 95 on May 29, 2003. Ex. 37, 2003 Neb. Laws LB 95. \n \n7  Plaintiffs offered numerous affidavits stating that plaintiffs’ members would advocate, absent Section 29, at state, local and private \nlevels for rights, obligations and benefits, including (1) those who wish to advocate for passage of the Financial Responsibility and \nProtection for Domestic Partners Act: Ex. 49, ¶¶ 19-20 (a homemaker); Ex. 47, ¶ 7 (a health care consultant); Ex. 46, ¶ 5 (a college \ninstructor); Ex. 45, ¶¶ 10-11 (a minister); Ex. 43, ¶¶ 15-16; Ex. 42, ¶¶ 8-9 (a not-for-profit director of public relations); Ex. 41 (a \nsoftware developer); Ex. 40, ¶¶ 19-22 (the ACLU); Ex. 39, ¶¶ 17-20 (the President of NAJE); (2) those who wish to advocate for \nlocal ordinance and city changes: Ex. 39, ¶¶ 17-20; Ex. 38, ¶¶ 21-23 (CFEP); and (3) those who want to advocate for change in \nlaws for public and corporate employers: Ex. 44, ¶¶ 12-13; Ex. 42, ¶ 7; Ex. 41, ¶ 9 (a software developer); Ex. 48, ¶ 4 (a corporate \nsupervisor); Ex. 39, ¶ ¶ 17-20; and Ex. 38, ¶ 21-23 (CFEP). \n \n8  First Amendment and Equal Protection issues are closely intertwined. Because intrusions on First Amendment rights are often \naccompanied by an invidious or irrational animus against a certain group, a First Amendment infringement can also be analyzed as \nthe deprivation of a fundamental interest under the Equal Protection Clause when accompanied by proof of such discriminatory \nanimus. Notwithstanding any finding that the plaintiffs have proved the other elements of either an Equal Protection or bill of \nattainder violation, a showing that Section 29 infringes First Amendment rights, standing alone, could render the provision \nunconstitutional unless the State could show either that the amendment is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest or “ \n‘closely drawn’ to match a ‘sufficiently important interest.’ ” See Federal Election Comm’n v. Beaumont, 539 U.S. 146, 161, 123 \nS.Ct. 2200, 156 L.Ed.2d 179 (2003) (noting the level of scrutiny is based on the importance of the “political activity at issue” to \neffective speech or political association). In light of the court’s finding in the Equal Protection section of this opinion that the \ndefendants cannot justify the amendment under deferential “rational basis” review, the court need not discuss the more stringent \nlevel of scrutiny. See, e.g., Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 630, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996) (applying rational basis \nreview in circumstance similar to those presented in this case). \n \n9  Indeed, the First Amendment’s ban on government abridgment of speech and peaceable assembly “anchors all [of the decisions \nrelating to a due process liberty interest] most firmly in the Constitution’s explicit text.” Laurence H. Tribe, Lawrence v. Texas: \nThe “Fundamental Right” That Dare Not Speak Its Name, 117 Harv. L.Rev. 1893, 1939-40 (April 2004). \n \n10  The Court tangentially noted but did not address the issue that “at some point in the systematic administration of these [anti-\ndiscrimination] laws, an official must determine whether homosexuality is an arbitrary and, thus, forbidden basis for decision,” \nthus amounting to a decision that would “itself amount to a policy prohibiting discrimination on the basis of homosexuality” and, \nthus, run afoul of the amendment. Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. at 630, 116 S.Ct. 1620 (noting that this consequence would compound \nthe constitutional difficulties). \n \n11  This analysis appears to beg the question, “What is marriage?” However, the court need not decide whether and to what extent \nNebraska can define or limit the state’s statutory definition of marriage. The court holds only that the prospective prohibition of \nany relationship “similar to” marriage is both exceedingly vague and overly broad. \n \n12  Notably,  Section  29  potentially  impinges  other  associational  relationships  than  those  that  would  comprise  a  “domestic \npartnership,” “civil union” or “similar same-sex relationship” involving a gay couple. See infra in the Equal Protection discussion. \nSection 29’s broad proscriptions could also interfere with or prevent arrangements between potential adoptive or foster parents and \nchildren, related persons living together, and people sharing custody of children as well as gay individuals and people inclined to \nalign with them to promote changes in legislation. \n \n13  In the context of this case, the Equal Protection allegations involve an intrusion on First Amendment rights motivated by an \ninvidious or irrational categorization, that is, the stifling of rights is alleged to have been discriminatory. See, e.g., Police Dep’t of \nChicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972) (different treatment of speakers by police triggered \nequal protection guarantees as well as First Amendment guarantee); Gay Alliance of Students v. Matthews, 544 F.2d at 166. As \nnoted, the First Amendment and Equal Protection issues are closely intertwined. \n \n14  None of the parties have raised the issue of whether the two sentences of Section 29 could be considered separately, so as to find \nSection 29’s first sentence constitutional, if its second sentence were not. Although plaintiffs’ contentions focus primarily on the \nsecond sentence of Section 29, plaintiffs specifically argue that Section 29 in its entirety violates the Equal Protection Clause in \ntheir complaint and throughout their trial brief in this case. See Filing No. 1, Complaint at 1; Filing No. 65, Pls.’ Trial Brief at 2. \nAlthough the State attempts in its polemic trial brief to argue that this case is really about sentence two of Section 29, the State has \nnot briefed or argued that Section 29 can be severed. The court interprets the parties’ positions as an acknowledgment that Section \n29 embodies one concept that cannot be severed. \n \n   \n\n \n \nThe court will briefly address the severability of the provision. The issue of severability is one of state law. Leavitt v. Jane L., \n518 U.S. 137, 139, 116 S.Ct. 2068, 135 L.Ed.2d 443 (1996); Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern R.R. Corp. v. South Dakota, 362 \nF.3d 512, 518 (8th Cir.2004). If legislation or a constitutional amendment embodies a single concept, then it is not severable. \nDuggan v. Beermann, 249 Neb. 411, 544 N.W.2d 68, 78 (1996) (single concept is not severable). Whether intended to be a \nsingle concept or not cannot be determined by voter intent. Id. at 78. The court should not guess voter intent. Id. at 80. See also \nJaksha v. State, 241 Neb. 106, 486 N.W.2d 858, 873 (1992) (four-part test for determining severability); Omaha Nat’l Bank v. \nSpire, 223 Neb. 209, 389 N.W.2d 269, 279 (1986) (no way to determine intent of voters). A voter could have voted for Section \n29 for a number of reasons. See Exs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 201, 202, 203, 204 and 209 \n(full faith and credit issues, religion, definition of marriage, failure of Unicameral to pass legislation, fear that children will be \ntaught that homosexuality and heterosexuality are morally equal and good, belief that homosexuality is wrong, among others). \nThe court is unable to discern the intent of the voters. Because Section 29 contains no severability clause, the court assumes that \nthe voters perceived it as one amendment, that is, a total concept. Moreover, the drafters of the proposed amendment considered \nand rejected a proposal that was limited to the first sentence. See Christopher Rizzo, Banning State Recognition of Same-sex \nRelationships: Constitutional Implications of Nebraska’s Initiative 416, 11 J.L. & Pol’y 1, 28 and n. 92 (2002). The court thus \nfinds that Section 29 must be considered to be a single concept, not subject to severance. The court expresses no opinion on the \nconstitutionality, standing alone, of the first sentence of Section 29, because that question has not been presented to the court. \n \n15  Various state and federal laws have historically granted benefits and protections to spouses. See, e.g., Uniform Probate Code § 5-\n310(a)(4) (establishing order of preference for the appointment of a guardian for an incapacitated person, with spouse ahead of \nadult children or parents); Neb.Rev.Stat. § 71-1339 (providing the spouse has first right to claim a person’s remains and to make \nanatomical gifts of parts of the deceased person’s body absent any express directive to the contrary); Neb.Rev.Stat. § 30-810 \n(authorizing wrongful death action for benefit of widow or widower); 26 U.S.C. § 6013, § 2056 (married couples can file joint tax \nreturns and qualify for estate tax deductions under the I.R.S.Code); 29 U.S.C. § 1002(15) (under ERISA, relative entitled to \nbenefits means “a spouse, ancestor, lineal descendant, or spouse of a lineal descendant”); 42 U.S.C. § 402 (married persons are \nentitled to survivor’s benefits under Social Security Act); 38 U.S.C. § 1310 (spouse is entitled to veteran’s benefits); 29 U.S.C. § \n2612(a)(1)(c) (Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requires employers to provide medical leave to care for a seriously ill spouse); \n8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2)(A)(i) (spouses accorded preferential treatment in connection with immigration). \nThe law also confers benefits on married people in connection with parenting, even in the absence of a biological connection \nwith the child. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 416(e)(2) (dependent children, including stepchildren, entitled to income benefits upon \ndeath, retirement or disability of a parent); Neb.Rev.Stat. § 48-124 (stepchildren can be entitled to workers’ compensation and \nsurvivor benefits); State v. Soto, 11 Neb.App. 667, 659 N.W.2d 1, 11 (2003) (same); 29 U.S.C. §§ 2611(12) & 2612(a)-(d) \n(1994) (FMLA covers care of seriously ill stepchild); Neb.Rev.Stat. § 43-101 (relaxed adoption requirements and simplified \nprocedures to stepparents); In re Adoption of T.K.J. and K.A.K., 931 P.2d 488 (Colo.App.1996) (holding that only a person \nmarried to a biological parent is eligible for stepparent adoption); Adoption Law and Practice § 1.05(2), § 2.10(3) (Joan H. \nHollinger ed., 1990) (same); Lori B. Andrews, Alternative Reproduction and the Law of Adoption, in Adoption Law and \nPractice § 14.02 (regarding parenthood by surrogacy or artificial insemination, a spouse is generally considered a legal parent \nfor all purposes, while a nonspouse can achieve recognition as parent only through formal process of adoption); Unif. Parentage \nAct, §§ 701-07, 9B U.L.A. 354-59 (2002) (same). Also, adoption and/or foster parenthood is prohibited to single people and \nhomosexuals in some jurisdictions. See Fla. Stat. ch. 63.042(3) (homosexuals); N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 170-B:4 (two unmarried \npeople); Lofton v. Secretary of Dep’t of Children and Family Services, 358 F.3d 804 (11th Cir.2004). See also In re Adoption of \nLuke, 263 Neb. 365, 640 N.W.2d 374, 382-83 (2002) (holding that a biological parent’s rights must be terminated or \nrelinquished in order for a child to be eligible for adoption by any adult other than a stepparent, effectively precluding adoptions \nby two unmarried persons if one is a biological parent). \nNotwithstanding the elevated status of marriage, several states and municipalities have extended some benefits historically \nconnected to the marital status to others. See, e.g., 1997 Haw.Rev.Stat. §§ 572C-4, 572C-5 (providing for registration of \n“reciprocal beneficiaries”); 15 Vt. Stat. Ann. § 1201 (2000) (providing domestic partner registry); Cal. Fam.Code § 297.5 \n(providing domestic partner registry for same-sex couples and couples over the age of 62); Minneapolis, Minn., Ordinance 91-\n08-015; Ithaca, N.Y. Mun.Code, ch 7; San Francisco, Cal., Admin. Code §§ 62.1-62.8. These laws or ordinances generally \nprovide for some system of registration and procedure for dissolution of the partnerships and grant rights related to hospital \nvisitation and medical decision-making to partners and also entitle partners of municipal employees to employment benefits. See \ngenerally id. \n \n16  The fifty states have various laws dealing with same-sex unions: Massachusetts permits same-sex couples to obtain marriage \nlicenses; five states (Connecticut, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Rhode Island) and the District of Columbia have no \nexplicit provisions that prohibit same-sex marriages; three states have laws predating 1996 that define marriage as between a man \nand a woman (Maryland, Wisconsin and Wyoming); twenty-five states have passed laws that define marriage as between a man \nand a woman and will not honor marriages between same-sex couples in other jurisdictions (Alabama, Arizona, California, \nColorado, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, \nPennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia); three states \nhave amended their state constitutions to declare marriages to be between a man and a woman only (Nebraska, Nevada, and \nOregon); and thirteen states have amended their Constitutions and passed laws to define marriage and to refuse to honor same-sex \n \n   \n\n \n \nmarriages from other jurisdictions (Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, \nNorth Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Utah). William C. Duncan, Whither Marriage in the Law? 15 Regent L.Rev. 119, \n120-21, nn. 9-11 (2002-03). In the general elections in November 2004, eleven states passed state constitutional amendments: \nArkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Utah. See Kavan \nPeterson, Fifty State Rundown on Same Sex Marriage Laws, available at http://www.stateline.org. In April 2005, the Connecticut \nHouse of Representatives passed legislation that would permit civil unions for same-sex couples but also passed language defining \nmarriage  as  between  one  man  and  one  woman  and  the  bill  was  signed  into  law  on  April  20,  2005.  See \nhttp://www.washintongtonpost.com, April 13 2005; Susan Haigh, Connecticut Becomes Second State to Approve Gay Unions After \nGovernor Signs Bill, http://abcnews.com, April 21, 2005. Notably, no state has amended its Constitution with language as broad as \nNebraska. See, e.g., Nev. CONST. art. I, § 21; Or. CONST. art. XV, § 5a. \nA New York state court judge recently ruled that denying a same-sex couple the right to marry violates the New York State \nConstitution’s  Equal  Protection  and  Due  Process  Clauses.  Seymour  v.  Holcomb,  7  Misc.3d  530,  790  N.Y.S.2d  858 \n(N.Y.App.Div.2005) (en banc). The Oregon Supreme Court, however, recently invalidated a same-sex marriage on statutory \ngrounds. Li v. State, 338 Or. 376, 110 P.3d 91 (2005). A California Court of Appeals recently found that the state’s domestic \npartner law did not conflict with a voter initiative limiting marriage to a man and a woman. Knight v.Super. Ct. of Sacramento \nCounty, 128 Cal.App.4th 14, 26 Cal.Rptr.3d 687, 698 (2005). \n \n17  Recently, the City of Omaha proposed a labor contract with the Omaha Police Union that included benefits for same-sex domestic \npartners. The parties and attorneys debated the constitutionality of the proposal in light of Initiative 416. Joseph Morton, 2000 Vote \nInvoked in Debate Over Police Benefits, Omaha World-Herald, April 6, 2004. This provides a good example of the chilling effect \nSection 29 has had on those wishing to advocate for partnership rights. See testimony given at Omaha City Council Meeting \nconcerning Police Union Contract, tapes dated May 4, 2004, and May 11, 2004. See also Heidi Eischen, For Better or for Worse: \nAn Analysis of Recent Challenges to Domestic Partner Benefits Legislation, 31 U. Tol. L.Rev. 527, 531 (2000). \n \n18  However, the court need not determine if a state can so define marriage. See supra n. 1. But see Goodridge v. Dept. of Public \nHealth, 440 Mass. 309, 798 N.E.2d 941, 969 (2003) (discrimination in marriage against same-sex couples unconstitutional under \nstate constitution); Baker v. State, 170 Vt. 194, 744 A.2d 864, 885 (1999) (exclusion of same sex couples from marriage is \nunconstitutional); Devlin v. Philadelphia, 862 A.2d 1234 (Pa.2004) (where ordinance allowing Life Partnership benefits to same-\nsex couples did not violate state law defining marriage as between a man and a woman). \n \n19  As discussed in the First Amendment section of this opinion, heightened scrutiny is applied to legislation that touches on a \n“specific prohibition of the Constitution, such as those in the first ten amendments” or that “restricts those political processes \nwhich can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation.” United States v. Carolene Products, 304 U.S. \n144, 152 n. 4, 58 S.Ct. 778, 82 L.Ed. 1234 (1938). In light of the court’s findings, the court need not engage in strict scrutiny \nanalysis. \n \n20  The court need not determine whether, once a law is found to be directed at a “politically unpopular group,” more searching \nscrutiny is required. See, e.g., Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 580, 123 S.Ct. 2472 (O’Connor, J., concurring). \n \n21  Many companies and governmental subdivisions are already giving such benefits to their employees. By 2003, the list of \nemployers offering family health benefits to same-sex couples included “187 colleges and universities; 162 local governments; and \nten state governments.” Judy Greenwald, More U.S. Employers Seen Adding Benefits for Domestic Partners, Bus. Ins., Aug. 11, \n2003, at 3. In 2004, “[s]eventy percent of the top 500 companies offer[ed] domestic-partner benefits for same-sex couples, \naccording to a December Business Week Report. That’s up from 25% in 2000.” Chuanpis Santilukka, Same-Sex Benefits Key to \nMarriage Debate, St. Cloud Times, Mar. 24, 2004 at 4A. Further, over 7000 companies “offer health benefits to same-sex \ndomestic partners.” James Ricci & Patricia Ward Biederman, Acceptance of Gays on Rise, Polls Show, L.A. Times, Mar. 30, 2004, \nat B1. Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Iceland, Sweden and Canada have afforded some marital rights to same-sex couples. \nClifford Krauss, Canada Supreme Court to Hear Arguments on Same-Sex Marriage, N.Y. Times, Oct. 6, 2004, at A7. Most \nrecently, the Montana Supreme Court found that Montana universities must offer health insurance to gay employees’ partners. \nSnetsinger v. Montana University System, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445 (2004), and an Arkansas trial judge struck down a \nregulation that barred gays from being foster parents under a separation of powers analysis. Howard v. The Child Welfare Agency \nReview Bd., 2004 WL 3154530 (Ark.Cir.2004). Additionally, many states and city governments are now offering benefits and \nrights to same-sex couples, for example, Vermont, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Phoenix \nand Tucson. See Standhardt v. State of Arizona, 206 Ariz. 276, 77 P.3d 451, 463 n. 17 (2004). In 2003, California’s Governor Gray \nDavis signed into law a statute requiring state contractors to provide health-care benefits to domestic partners.

Filing No. \n22. Defendants contend that this case should be dismissed as the plaintiffs lack standing, the case lacks ripeness, and the \ncause of action for bill of attainder should be dismissed. I have carefully reviewed the record, briefs in support of and in \nopposition to the motion, and the relevant case law. I conclude that the motion to dismiss should be denied. \n  \n \nBackground \nGuyla Mills headed a petition drive, known as Initiative 416. Nebraska voters adopted Initiative 416 in 2000. On December \n7, 2000, Governor Johanns signed the Initiative into law as Article 1, Section 29 of the Nebraska Bill of Rights. Section 29 \nstates: “Only marriage between a man and a woman shall be valid or recognized in Nebraska. The uniting of two persons of \nthe same sex in a civil union, domestic partnership, or other similar same-sex relationship shall not be valid or recognized in \nNebraska.” \n  \nThe plaintiffs, Nebraska organizations that have lesbian, gay, and bisexual members, contend the second sentence of Section \n29 should be declared unconstitutional as it prohibits lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons from accessing the political process \nto attempt to obtain legal protections, virtually barring legal protection of any kind to same-sex relationships. Plaintiff \nCitizens for Equal Protection is a nonprofit membership organization whose mission is to stop discrimination based on sexual \norientation  through  legislation  and  education.  Plaintiff  Nebraska  Advocates  for  Justice  and  Equality  is  a  nonprofit \norganization that was created in response to the anti-gay campaign for Initiative 416. Both plaintiffs lobby for legislation that \nis designed to protect the needs of its members. Plaintiff ACLU is a nonprofit entity that advocates for the protection of civil \n \n \n\n \n \nliberties for all persons. \n  \n*1006 Plaintiffs argue that they are unable to, at the very least, seek legislation to provide legal protections for those in same-\nsex relationships. In support of their arguments, plaintiffs note that they approached Senator Nancy Thompson and asked her \nto draft legislation concerning domestic partnerships and, in particular, language that relates to health, funeral, hospital and \norgan donations. Senator Thompson proposed a bill on January 22, 2003, to allow both same-sex and different-sex couples to \nmake decisions regarding funeral arrangements and organ donations. Filing No. 1, Ex. A. Senator Thompson submitted a \nrequest to Nebraska Attorney General Bruning asking him to issue an opinion as to the constitutionality of such legislation. \nOn March 10, 2003, the Attorney General issued an opinion determining that the proposed bill would violate Section 29. \nFiling No. 1, Ex. B. Plaintiffs also have a draft bill entitled “Financial Responsibility and Protection for Domestic Partners \nAct” which would allow same-sex couples to formalize their responsibilities to each other and would allow private \ncompanies to offer certain benefits to domestic partners. Filing No. 1, Ex. C. However, because of Section 29 and the recent \nopinion of the Attorney General, plaintiffs will not have the opportunity to present this legislation to the Unicameral. They \nargue they are no longer permitted to lobby members of the Unicameral regarding health care decisions, living expenses, \nfuneral arrangements, and hospital visitations. \n  \nSection 29 is the only law of its kind in the United States. According to the plaintiffs, over 150 local governments offer same-\nsex health benefits; a number of states and municipalities offer domestic partner registries; and over 5,000 companies \nrecognize same-sex couples domestic partnerships. Filing No. 1, ¶ 20. \n  \nIn this lawsuit, plaintiffs are seeking an equal opportunity to lobby their elected representatives regarding legal protections \nfor same-sex relationships. They are not asking this court for any particular remedies relating to marriage, civil unions, or \ndomestic partnerships. \n  \n \nStandard of Review \nFed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) \nFor the court to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), the complaint must be \nsuccessfully challenged either on its face or on the factual truthfulness of its averments. Titus v. Sullivan, 4 F.3d 590, 593 (8th \nCir.1993). In a facial challenge to jurisdiction, all of the factual allegations regarding jurisdiction would be presumed true and \nthe motion could succeed only if the plaintiff had failed to allege an element necessary for subject matter jurisdiction. Id. \n  \nIf a plaintiff lacks standing, the district court has no subject matter jurisdiction. Faibisch v. Univ. of Minn., 304 F.3d 797, 800 \n(8th Cir.2002). Therefore, a standing argument implicates Rule 12(b)(1). To establish standing, a plaintiff must show that it is \nlikely that the remedy sought can redress the injury. Id. A threat of injury must be both real and immediate, not conjectural \nand hypothetical. Id. \n  \n \nFed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) \nIn reviewing a complaint on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court must consider all of the facts alleged in the complaint as true \nand construe the pleadings in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. See, e.g., Brotherhood of Maint. of Way Employees v. \nBNSF R.R., 270 F.3d 637, 638 (8th Cir.2001). A dismissal is not lightly granted. “A complaint shall not be dismissed for its \nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted unless it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that plaintiff can prove \nno set of facts in support of a claim entitling him to relief.” Young v. *1007 City of St. Charles, 244 F.3d 623, 627 (8th \nCir.2001). When accepting the facts of the complaint as true, a court will not, however, “blindly accept the legal conclusions \ndrawn by the pleader from the facts.” Westcott v. City of Omaha, 901 F.2d 1486, 1488 (8th Cir.1990) (citing Morgan v. \nChurch’s Fried Chicken, 829 F.2d 10, 12 (6th Cir.1987)). A dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is therefore granted “only in the \nunusual case in which a plaintiff includes allegations that show on the face of the complaint that there is some insuperable bar \nto relief,” Schmedding v. Tnemec Co., 187 F.3d 862, 864 (8th Cir.1999), such as a missing allegation about an element \nnecessary to obtain relief or an affirmative defense or other bar. Doe v. Hartz, 134 F.3d 1339, 1341 (8th Cir.1998). The court \ndoes not determine whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but rather whether the plaintiff is entitled to present evidence \n \n \n\n \n \nin support of his claim. Doe v. Norwest Bank, 909 F.Supp. 668, 670 (D.Minn.1995). \n  \n \nDiscussion \nStanding \n[1] Defendants argue that plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the constitutionality of Section 29. Plaintiffs contend that they \nhave already been injured by the defendants and do in fact have standing to pursue this lawsuit. In order to establish standing, \nthe plaintiffs in this case must show (1) an injury in fact where there is harm, either actual or imminent; (2) causation that \nconnects the plaintiffs’ injury with the conduct of the defendant; and (3) redressability—whether the requested relief will \nactually address the injury. Northeastern Fla. Chapter of the Assoc. Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, \n663, 113 S.Ct. 2297, 124 L.Ed.2d 586 (1993). With regard to the initial factor, defendants argue first that there is no injury, \nas plaintiffs could try to amend the constitution and second, because plaintiffs did not have any rights under Nebraska law \nprior to the passage of Section 29. \n  \nPlaintiffs argue that they do have injury-in-fact, as Section 29 is a barrier that prevents them from proposing and passing \nlegislation. Plaintiffs rely on Northeastern Fla. Chapter of the Assoc. Gen. Contractors wherein the court held that the injury-\nin-fact required for standing in “an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the \nimposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.” Id. at 666, 113 S.Ct. 2297. The court further stated \nthat “when the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is \nfor members of another group, a member of the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need not allege that he would \nhave obtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing.” Id. Plaintiffs also rely on the fact that they have \nalleged an equal protection violation in this lawsuit on the basis similar to that which was found to be unconstitutional in \nRomer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 621, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996) (disqualification of a class from seeking legal \nprotections held to violate equal protection). \n  \nIn the case at hand, Senator Thompson introduced Legislative Bill 671, but following the opinion of the Attorney General, \nshe took no further action. It is obvious that Section 29 acts as a barrier to the ability of the plaintiffs to obtain support for the \nintroduction and passage of legislation. I conclude that Section 29 acts as a barrier to plaintiffs’ participation in the political \nprocess, and thus as a result plaintiffs have established injury for purposes of the standing requirement. \n  \nDefendants argue the second prong, causation, is not proven as the plaintiffs can pursue other avenues to redress their *1008 \ngrievances and to obtain the benefits they want. Plaintiffs argue that the conduct of the defendants has caused them to be \nunable to even produce bills for legislative review. I agree. Plaintiffs’ inability to access the legislative system is directly \ncaused by the passage of Section 29. Consequently, I determine that plaintiffs have established causation for purposes of the \nstanding requirement. \n  \nWith regard to prong three, redressability, defendants contend that plaintiffs would only receive emotional gratitude if they \noverturn Section 29, as they have not received any real injury. They argue that such “psychic satisfaction is not an acceptable \nArticle III remedy because it does not redress a cognizable Article III injury.” Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, \n523 U.S. 83, 107, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). Plaintiffs have alleged an equal protection violation in their \ncomplaint. Filing No. 1. If plaintiffs were to win on the merits of the case, and if Section 29 is found to be unconstitutional, \nthen plaintiffs would receive the relief they have requested, namely, access to the legislative process. Consequently, I \ndetermine that plaintiffs have established redressability for purposes of the standing requirement. \n  \n \nRipeness \n[2] Ripeness “is peculiarly a question of timing. Its basic rationale is to prevent the courts, through premature adjudication, \nfrom entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.” Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prod. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 580, 15 \nS.Ct. 3325, 87 L.Ed.2d 409 (1985) (citations omitted). To be ripe for decision, a case must satisfy two elements: (1) the \nissues must be fit for judicial decision, and (2) there must be hardship to the parties by withholding the court’s consideration. \nNat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 123 S.Ct. 2026, 2036, 155 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2003). If “front-desking” \n \n \n\n \n \noccurs, then the case is more likely ripe for judicial decision. Reno v. Catholic Soc. Serv., Inc., 509 U.S. 43, 61–63, 113 S.Ct. \n2485, 125 L.Ed.2d 38 (1993) (illegal aliens were having their applications rejected before a determination of their eligibility \nfor legalization, called “front-desking,” and thus ripe for review). Plaintiffs argue that front-desking is occurring in this case. \nDefendants argue that no action has yet been taken against an individual or group that is cognizable by the court. Defendants \nseem to argue that plaintiffs must first get legislation passed and have it invalidated by the court before injury occurs. As \nplaintiffs point out, the defendants have missed the point of plaintiffs’ argument in this regard. Plaintiffs have tried to submit \nlegislation, through Senator Thompson, to the Unicameral. There is a barrier hindering their ability to even present the \nproposed legislation. Consequently, I determine that plaintiffs have established sufficient injury so as to conclude that the \nclaim in this case is ripe for review. I further conclude that this is the type of decision that should be decided by the court, \nthat the issue is not premature, and that further hardship will occur if plaintiffs are not permitted to seek judicial intervention. \n  \n \nBill of Attainder \n[3] Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that the actions by the defendants constitute a bill of attainder. To be considered a bill of \nattainder the legislative act must (1) apply to named individuals or easily ascertainable members of a group, (2) inflict \npunishment, and (3) be without judicial trial. United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 315, 106 Ct.Cl. 856, 66 S.Ct. 1073, 90 \nL.Ed. 1252 (1946). The bill of attainder clause is “to be read in light of the evil the Framers had sought to bar: legislative \npunishment, of any form or severity, of specifically designated persons or groups.” *1009 United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. \n437, 447, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 (1965). \n  \n \nA. Named Individual or Easily Ascertainable Group \n[4] The legislative act should in general name persons to be punished or by described terms of conduct. Selective Serv. Sys. v. \nMinn. Public Interest Research Group, 468 U.S. 841, 104 S.Ct. 3348, 82 L.Ed.2d 632 (1984) (applied to group of people who \nfailed to register for the draft). The specificity requirement is met when the law applies to “easily ascertainable members of a \ngroup.” Brown, 381 U.S. at 448–49, 85 S.Ct. 1707. As the court points out, it was not that unusual for the English bills of \nattainder “to inflict their deprivations upon relatively large groups of people, sometimes by description rather than name.” \nBrown, 381 U.S. at 461, 85 S.Ct. 1707. In the case before me, Article 1 Section 29 names both specific groups and also \ndescribes them in terms of their conduct. Section 29 names the specific group of “civil unions” and “Domestic Partners” and \ndescribes their conduct as “the uniting of two persons of the same sex.” Consequently, I conclude that plaintiffs have shown \nSection 29 applies to an easily ascertainable group. \n  \n \nB. Without Judicial Trial \nA reading of Section 29 establishes that there is no judicial trial before preventing the legal recognition of same-sex \nrelationships. All parties appear to concede this issue, and upon a review of the statute and the record, I conclude that Section \n29 does not provide for a judicial trial. \n  \n \nC. Infliction of Punishment \nIn deciding whether a legislative act inflicts punishment, the Supreme Court has recognized three necessary inquiries: (1) \nwhether the challenged legislation falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment, (2) whether the statute can be \nsaid to further nonpunitive legislative purposes, and (3) whether the legislative record shows a congressional intent to punish. \nSelective Serv. Sys., 468 U.S. at 852, 104 S.Ct. 3348; Planned Parenthood v. Dempsey, 167 F.3d 458, 465 (8th Cir.1999). \n  \n \nHistorical Meaning \nHistorically, bills of attainder imposed the death penalty, but lesser penalties have also been included. Selective Serv. Sys., \n468 U.S. at 852, 104 S.Ct. 3348. The court in discussing these changes has stated: “the list of punishments forbidden by the \nBill of Attainder Clause has expanded to include legislative bars to participation by individuals or groups in specific \nemployment or professions.” Id. See also Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 85 S.Ct. 1707 (Communist Party members barred from labor \n \n \n\n \n \nunion); United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 106 Ct.Cl. 856, 66 S.Ct. 1073, 90 L.Ed. 1252 (1946) (salary cuts for three \ngovernment employees); Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. 277, 4 Wall. 277, 18 L.Ed. 356 (1866) (priest disqualified from \npracticing as clergy); and Garland, 71 U.S. 333, 4 Wall. 333, 18 L.Ed. 366 (1866) (lawyers barred from practice of law). \nAlexander Hamilton talked about this issue and stated with regard to prohibiting the bill of attainder: \n[O]f this kind is the doctrine of disqualification, disenfranchisement, and banishment by the acts of the \nlegislature.  The  dangerous  consequences  of  this  power  are  manifest.  If  the  legislature  can \ndisenfranchise any number of citizens at pleasure by general descriptions, it may soon confine all the \nvotes to a small number of partisans, and establish an aristocracy or oligarchy.... \nUnited States v. Brown, 381 U.S. at 444, 85 S.Ct. 1707, (quoting III (John C.) Hamilton, History of the Republic of the United \nStates, p. 34 (1859)) (quoting Alexander Hamilton). As discussed in Brown, that *1010 the legislature of the United States \npassed statutes to single out the Tories and restrict their ability to resist the revolution, and as the legislature did against \nCommunist Party membership, plaintiffs argue Section 29 is directed at gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual people to \nprohibit their political ability to effectuate changes proposed by the majority. Id. at 442, 85 S.Ct. 1707. \n  \nClearly, plaintiffs have made an initial case that the law in question operates as a legislative bar for their specified groups. \nAccordingly, I find that the challenged legislation falls within the historical meaning of the term punishment. \n  \n \nLegislative Purposel Intent to Punish \nBecause  the  arguments  are  overlapping  in  some  respects  with  regard  to  these  two  inquires,  I  shall  address  them \nsimultaneously. Defendants argue that the purpose of Section 29 is to retain the traditional meaning of the word “marriage,” \ni.e., as being between a man and a woman. Thus, they argue, Section 29 does not punish or prohibit any conduct. Defendants \nrely on the case in which the court concluded that the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy was not a bill of attainder. Richenberg \nv. Perry, 97 F.3d 256, 264 (8th Cir.1996). \n  \nPlaintiffs argue that “Section 29 imposes punishment by depriving lesbian, gay and bisexual people of their civil and political \nrights to attempt to persuade their governmental representatives and employers to protect their intimate relationships and by \nsingling them out for moral censure.” Filing No. 30, Brief of Plaintiffs, at 32. Plaintiffs first argue that Section 29 \ndisenfranchises lesbian, gay and bisexual people as they no longer can petition their representatives and city government for \nlegislative change. Prior to Section 29, they had the right to use the political process. Plaintiffs argue that this type of \ndisenfranchisement is the equivalent of punishment. Further, contend the plaintiffs, Section 29 prohibits government \nemployers from offering benefits, such as family health insurance and retirement benefits, to cohabiting gay, lesbian, bisexual \nand transsexual employees. Plaintiffs argue that this constitutes punishment. Third, plaintiffs argue that “[t]he vice of \nattainder is that the legislature has decided for itself that certain persons possess certain characteristics and are therefore \ndeserving of sanction....” Brown, 381 U.S. at 449 n. 23, 85 S.Ct. 1707. The same is applicable in this case, urge plaintiffs, as \nSection 29 is intended to deny constitutional rights to gay, lesbian and bisexual persons. Plaintiffs argue that there is no \nnonpunitive reason for passage of Section 29. \n  \nPlaintiffs also contend that the passage of Section 29 was motivated purely to prevent gays and lesbians from accessing the \npolitical system and rendering them second class citizens. See Filing No. 1, ¶ 21 (comments by Guyla Mills, who led the \npetition drive that Section 29 was to make known that homosexual and heterosexual marriages are not equivalents and that \nhomosexual relationships are morally inferior). This is further evidence, argue plaintiffs, of the intent to punish same-sex \ncouples. \n  \nAs stated by the Supreme Court, legislation that “identifies persons by a single trait and then denies them protection across \nthe board,” resulting in “disqualification of a class of persons from the right to seek specific protections from the law is \nunprecedented....” Romer, 517 U.S. at 633, 116 S.Ct. 1620. Laws “declaring that in general it shall be more difficult for one \ngroup of citizens than for all others to seek aid from the government is itself a denial of equal protection of the laws in the \nmost literal sense.” Id. The court further stated that such a law will “raise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage \nimposed is *1011 born of animosity toward the class of persons affected.” Id. at 634, 116 S.Ct. 1620. \n  \nThis is unlike the cases wherein the courts decided that statutes served nonpunitive purposes and, therefore, were valid. See, \n \n \n\n \n \ne.g., Planned Parenthood of Mid–Missouri and Eastern Kansas, Inc. v. Dempsey, 167 F.3d 458 (8th Cir.1999) (removal of \nfunding for abortion services deemed to support nonpunitive purpose of removing State’s approval from abortion services); \nSelective Service System v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group, 468 U.S. 841, 104 S.Ct. 3348, 82 L.Ed.2d 632 (1984) \n(denial of financial aid to males who would not register for draft not punishment where goal was to make males register); and \nUnited States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968) (conviction for burning selective service card \nnot punitive where nonpunitive goal was to continue availability of selective service certificates). \n  \nSection 29 does not just withhold a benefit; it actually prohibits same-sex relationship couples from working to obtain \ngovernmental benefits. If the purpose, as offered by the defendants, of Section 29 is merely to maintain the common law \ndefinition of marriage, there would be no need to prohibit all forms of government protection or to preclude domestic \npartnerships and civil unions. I conclude that the plaintiffs have met the legal requirements for stating a claim of bill of \nattainder. \n  \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that defendants’ motion to dismiss, Filing No. 22, is denied. \n  \n\t\r  \n \n\t\r  \n  \n \n ",
