    "summary": "<p>This case concerns the \"Improvement Standard,\" a rule of thumb that required many beneficiaries to show a likelihood of medical or functional improvement before Medicare would pay for skilled nursing and therapy services. As a result, some people were forced into nursing homes or suffered other adverse medical outcomes. This lawsuit was brought against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) by five individual plaintiffs who were Medicare beneficiaries and five national organization plaintiffs (National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Parkinson's Action Network, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation). The plaintiffs, represented by the Center for Medicare Advocacy and Vermont Legal Aid, filed their complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont on January 18, 2011, along with a motion for certification of a nationwide class. The plaintiffs alleged that the Improvement Standard was not codified, but was \"covertly\" followed by HHS. They argued that this violated 1) the Medicare statute's medical necessity requirement, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1395y(a)(l)(A), and the statute's implementing regulations; 2) procedural requirements in the Medicare statute and the Administrative Procedure Act, as the Standard was implemented without notice-and-comment; 3) the Freedom of Information Act, as the Standard was not published in the Federal Register; 4) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive or mandamus relief, as well as attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Christina Reiss. On March 3, 2011, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two more organization plaintiffs (Alzheimer's Association and United Cerebral Palsy) and one beneficiary plaintiff. The parties completed briefing on the motion for class certification in early May 2011.</p>\r\n<p>Oral argument on HHS's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim was held on July 14, 2011. Later that year, on October 25, the court largely denied the motion, though it dismissed one individual plaintiff for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed one organizational plaintiff for lack of standing.&nbsp; 2011 WL 5104355. The plaintiffs subsequently moved for reconsideration as to the dismissal of the individual plaintiff, but the court denied the motion on December 23, 2011. 2011 WL 13202352.</p>\r\n<p>After HHS&nbsp;filed an answer on November 8, 2011, discovery was stayed for settlement discussions. On July 20, 2012, the parties reported to the court that they had reached an agreement in principle.</p>\r\n<p>In October 2012, the parties filed a settlement agreement. The agreement significantly changed Medicare coverage rules, such that Medicare would pay for any services needed to \"maintain the patient's current condition or prevent or slow further deterioration,\" regardless of whether a patient's condition was expected to improve. The agreement also stated that HHS would educate health care providers and contractors about the standards for skilled nursing facilities, home health care, outpatient therapy, and inpatient rehabilitation facilities. The Court would monitor compliance for four years, and retain jurisdiction to enforce the agreement and address a motion for attorneys' fees. The government agreed to pay an unspecified amount for attorneys' fees and costs to the plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>The court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on November 20, 2012, and final approval on January 24 of the following year. The court also certified a class of all Medicare beneficiaries who received skilled nursing or therapy services in a skilled nursing facility, home health setting, or outpatient setting, and were denied coverage based on a lack of improvement.</p>\r\n<p>On March 1, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the settlement, arguing that HHS refused to make certain revisions to the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, and that the educational campaign to implement the settlement agreement was insufficient.</p>\r\n<p>Later that year, on August 17, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to enforce. It held that HHS had fulfilled the duties imposed by the settlement agreement as to the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual and the court couldn't change the agreement to make it stricter. However, as to the educational campaign, the court found that the plaintiffs had shown HHS had provided inaccurate information and was non-responsive to questions. Thus, the court ordered HHS to propose corrective action with regard to the educational campaign. 2016 WL 4401371.</p>\r\n<p>On February 1, 2017, the court adopted HHS's proposed modifications. It also ordered HHS to post on its website to address certain erroneous information it had disseminated as part of the educational campaign. 2017 WL 462512. However, the plaintiffs later argued that HHS's website violated this requirement when it included additional information claiming the settlement was only a clarification of policy, not an expansion of coverage. The defendants countered that nothing in the agreement or subsequent modifications prohibited it from including added information.</p>\r\n<p>About nine months later, on November 21, the court held that HHS's additional information undercut the required message regarding updates to the policy, thus presenting the risk of further confusion (which is what the website was supposed to remedy). Thus, the court clarified which statements needed to be removed from the website.</p>\r\n<p>As of April 4, 2024, there have been no further updates.</p>",

      "text": "~------ --- ---- -----------------------,--\n. \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE \nDISTRICT OF VERMONT \nGLENDA JIMMO, et al.,  ) \n) \nPlaintiffs,  ) \n) \nV.  )  Case No. 5: l l-cv-17 \n) \n) \nSYLVIA MAT  HEWS BURW  ELL, Secretary  ) \nof Health and Human Services,  ) \n) \nDefendant.  ) \nOPINION AND ORDER \nREJECTING IN PART LANGUAGE APPEARING ON JIMMO WEBPAGE \n(Docs. 124 & 125) \nThis matter comes before the court to determine whether Defendant has deviated \nfrom the Corrective Statement the court ordered Defendant to post on its Jimmo website \nto address certain erroneous information Defendant had disseminated as part of the \nEducational Campaign it was required to undertake pursuant to a Settlement Agreement \ndated October 16, 2012 which was accepted by the court on January 24, 2013 and for \nwhich it retained certain enforcement jurisdiction. \nThe court adopts the factual and procedural background set forth in its Opinion \nand Order Adopting Defendant's Corrective Action Plan and Mandating Two Additional \nRequirements (Doc. 115) dated February 1, 2017 (the \"Corrective Action Order\") \nwherein it ordered Defendant to make a corrective statement after considering the \ncompeting statements proposed by the parties.  Although Defendant makes much of the \nfact that the Settlement Agreement did not require Defendant to create a Jimmo webpage, \n\nwhen Defendant proposed this corrective action and the court adopted that proposal, it \nbecame a court order which Defendant was not then free to disregard.  See Maness v. \nMeyers, 419 U.S. 449,459 (1975) (\"[O]nce the court has ruled, counsel and others \ninvolved in the action must abide by the ruling and comply with the court's orders\" or \nrisk being found in contempt and \"exposed to sanctions\"). \nThereafter, the parties agreed to revised language which the court adopted.  The \nCorrective Statement ordered by the court was as follows: \nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reminds the \nMedicare community of the Jimmo Settlement Agreement (January 2013), \nwhich clarified that the Medicare program covers skilled nursing care and \nskilled therapy services under Medicare's skilled nursing facility, home \nhealth, and outpatient therapy benefits when a beneficiary needs skilled \ncare in order to maintain function or to prevent or slow decline or \ndeterioration (provided all other coverage criteria are met).  Specifically, \nthe Jimmo Settlement Agreement required manual revisions to restate a \n\"maintenance coverage standard\" for both skilled nursing and therapy \nservices under these benefits: \nSkilled nursing services would be covered where such skilled \nnursing services are necessary to maintain the patient's \ncurrent condition or prevent or slow further deterioration so \nlong as the beneficiary requires skilled care for the services to \nbe safely and effectively provided. \nSkilled therapy services are covered when an individualized \nassessment of the patient's clinical condition demonstrates \nthat the specialized judgment, knowledge, and skills of a \nqualified therapist (\"skilled care\") are necessary for the \nperformance of a safe and effective maintenance program. \nSuch a maintenance program to maintain the patient's current \ncondition or to prevent or slow further deterioration is \ncovered so long as the beneficiary requires skilled care for the \nsafe and effective performance of the program. \nThe Jimmo Settlement Agreement may reflect a change in practice for those \nproviders, adjudicators, and contractors who may have erroneously \nbelieved that the Medicare program covers nursing and therapy services \nunder these benefits only when a beneficiary is expected to improve.  The \nJimmo Settlement Agreement is consistent with Medicare program's \nregulations governing maintenance nursing and therapy in skilled nursing \nfacilities, home health services, and outpatient therapy (physical, \n2 \n\noccupational, and speech) and nursing and therapy in inpatient \nrehabilitation hospitals for beneficiaries who need the level of care that \nsuch hospitals provide. \nDefendant posted the Corrective Statement on a CMS webpage which is entitled \n\"Jimmo Settlement.\"  The Corrective Statement is presented as the primary content of the \npage under a hearing entitled \"Important Message About the Jimmo Settlement.\" \nDefendant's \"clarifying language\" is set forth below the \"Important Message\" and is the \nonly other narrative text contained on that webpage.  Under the heading \"Additional \nInformation,\" Defendant's \"clarifying language\" states in relevant part: \n... We note that the Jimmo Settlement Agreement does not represent an \nexpansion of coverage, but rather, it provides clarifications that are \nintended to help ensure that claims are adjudicated accurately and \nappropriately in accordance with the existing Medicare policy.  Similarly, \nthe Jimmo Settlement Agreement does not alter or supersede any other \napplicable coverage requirements beyond those involving the need for \nskilled care, such as Medicare's overall requirement that covered services \nmust be reasonable and necessary to diagnose or treat the beneficiary's \ncondition, or existing statutory limitations on the amount or duration of \nMedicare benefits. \n(Doc. 121-1 at 1.)  Defendant concedes that \"[i]n the case of the two disputed sentences, \nthe information they convey is arguably presented in different form on the FAQ page that \ncan be accessed by a link from the Jimmo webpage.\"  (Doc. 124 at 11.) \nPlaintiffs argue that the \"Additional Information\" violates the Corrective Action \nPlan Order and is intended to convey \"that the Settlement Agreement changed nothing[.]\" \n(Doc. 125 at 7.)  Defendant counters that \"nothing in the Corrective Action [Plan] Order \nprohibits CMS from including on the Jimmo webpage information in addition to what \nwas required by the Court in its Order.\"  Id. at 5.  It further argues that the court generally \nlacks jurisdiction to dictate the contents of the CMS website.  While both points are \naccurate, it would be a waste of party and judicial resources to have protracted \nproceedings and negotiations regarding the specific language of the Corrective Statement \nonly to have it undermined by \"clarifying\" language.  It also remains true that the court \nretains the authority to ensure compliance with its orders.  See Roberson v.  Giuliani, 346 \n3 \n\nF.3d 75, 83 (2d Cir. 2003) (\"A court's responsibility to ensure that its orders are fair and \nlawful stamps an agreement that is made part of an order with judicial imprimatur, and \nthe continuing jurisdiction involved in the court's inherent power to protect and \neffectuate its decrees entails judicial oversight of the agreement.\") ( quoting Smyth ex rel. \nSmyth v. Rivero, 282 F.3d 268, 282 (4th Cir. 2002)). \nThe Corrective Statement provides an \"Important Message\" that \"the Jimmo \nSettlement Agreement required manual revisions to restate a 'maintenance coverage \nstandard' for both skilled nursing and therapy services\" and that \"[t]he Jimmo Settlement \nAgreement may reflect a change in practice for those providers, adjudicators, and \ncontractors who may have erroneously believe that the Medicare program covers nursing \nand therapy services under these benefits only when a beneficiary is expected to \nimprove.\"  (Doc. 121-1.)  Defendant's \"Additional Information\" undercuts this message \nby stating that the Jimmo Settlement Agreement provides only \"clarifications\" to ensure \nthat \"claims are adjudicated accurately and appropriately in accordance with the existing \nMedicare policy.\"  Id.  It is unclear whether Defendant's reference to \"the existing \nMedicare policy\" refers to pre or post \"maintenance coverage standard\" provisions.  It is \nundisputed, however, that the \"maintenance coverage standard\" is the product of the \nJimmo Settlement Agreement and the Corrective Statement is intended to highlight that \nfact.  Rather than clarifying, the \"Additional Information\" thus presents the risk of further \nconfusion. \nDefendant was afforded an opportunity to object to the Corrective Statement and \npropose certain changes to it.  Defendant did not propose adding a section directly after \nthe Corrective Statement entitled \"Additional Information.\"  While much of the \n\"Additional Information\" is unproblematic, a statement that appears to contradict the \nCorrective Statement's announcement of the new \"maintenance coverage standard\" \nviolates the Corrective Action Plan Order.  As a result, the following sentence must be \nstricken from Defendant's Jimmo webpage: \"We note that the Jimmo Settlement \nAgreement does not represent an expansion of coverage, but rather, it provides \n4 \n\nclarifications that are intended to help ensure that claims are adjudicated accurately and \nappropriately in accordance with the existing Medicare policy.\" \nSO ORDERED. \nff \nDated at Burlington, in the District of Vermo~ ember, 2017. \nChristina Reiss, Chief Judge \nUnited States District Court \n5 ",

In its October 25th \nOpinion and Order, the court granted in part and denied in part Defendant's motion to \ndismiss.  Plaintiffs seek reconsideration of that part of the Opinion and Order dismissing \nplaintiff Edith Masterman's claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based upon her \nfailure to exhaust her administrative remedies.  Defendant opposes reconsideration. \nI.  Factual and Procedural Background. \nPlaintiffs' motion for partial reconsideration seeks reconsideration ofthe \nfollowing portion of the court's October 25th Opinion and Order: \nAlthough this case presents a close question, the court cannot conclude, \nbased upon the record before it, that judicial review is unavailable to Ms. \nMasterman as a practical matter.  As the Secretary points out, Ms. \nMasterman can force her HHA [Home Health Agency] to submit a claim \nthrough a procedure known as \"demand billing.\"  A \"demand bill\" is a \n\"claim submitted by an HHA to [CMS] for services or items that the HHA \nbelieves are not covered but which the HHA must submit to [CMS] at the \nrequest ofthe beneficiary[.]\" Lutwin v.  Thompson, 361 F.3d 146, 149 (2d \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 64   Filed 12/23/11   Page 2 of 5\nCir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  To require \nsubmission of a demand bill, the beneficiary must agree to pay the HHA for \nservices that CMS determines are not covered by Medicare.  See id.  A \nbeneficiary has this option when an HHA \"prospectively decline [s ] to \nprovide ... services ... when it conclude[s],\" as Ms. Masterman's HHA \ndid here, \"that [CMS] would not cover those services.  Id. l  This would \n\"trigger the administrative process, at the end of which is judicial review of \nthe Secretary's final decision.\"  Am. Chiropractic Ass 'n, 431 F.3d at 817. \nSome potential difficulty or financial hardship is generally not enough.  See \nRinger, 466 U.S. at 622, 625 (holding that Ringer's claim arose under the \nMedicare Act and required presentment even though \"some ... surgeons \nmay well decline to perform the requested surgery because of fear that the \nSecretary will not find the surgery 'reasonable and necessary' and thus will \nrefuse to reimburse them.\"). \nHere, Ms. Masterman has not established that she is financially unable to \nreimburse her HHA in the event services are not covered or that demand \nbilling is not available to her.  She has thus not established that applying § \n405(h) to her claims renders judicial review unavailable.  Accordingly, Ms. \nMasterman is required to present her claims to the Secretary, and \njurisdiction under both § 405(g) and § 1331 is not available. \n(Doc. 56 at 8-9). \nWith regard to Ms. Masterman, Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint alleges the \nfollowing: \n71. An infection occurred after the skin graft and she remained hospitalized \nuntil October 14,2009. Upon her release from the hospital, she was \nadmitted to a skilled nursing facility from October 14,2009 to January 18, \n2010. When she finally returned home in January 2010 her physician \nordered home health care, but AHCH refused to accept her back as a patient \non the grounds that it \"cannot accept Edith because her Medicare will not \npay for a chronic problem\" and she needs long term care. AHCH \ninformed Ms. Masterman that Medicare would not cover the wound care \nher doctor ordered because Medicare does not pay for care when a wound is \nchronic and never expected to heal. \n1 When an HHA declines to provide services because it believes that such services will not be \ncovered by Medicare, eMS requires it to provide the beneficiary with a \"Home Health Advance \nBeneficiary Notice.\"  On this notice, the beneficiary may trigger demand billing by selecting the \nfollowing option: \"I want the items and/or services ... and 1 agree to pay for the items and/or \nservices myself if Medicare or my other insurance doesn't pay.\" \n2 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 64   Filed 12/23/11   Page 3 of 5\n72. Her doctors have been and are willing to order home health care. \n73. Prior to her hospitalization, Medicare covered the services provided by \nan AHCH nurse who came to Ms. Masterman's home every other day. After \nher hospitalization and because she could not obtain Medicare coverage of \nher home health care, Ms. Masterman originally made weekly visits to the \nwound care clinic at the hospital. She now visits the wound care clinic once \nevery four weeks. \n74. She receives some home care services from Elder Independence of \nMaine, paid for by Medicaid, which includes home health aides three times \ndaily for about 1-112 to 2 hours per visit from Home Care ofMaine and a \nonce weekly skilled nursing visit from Care and Comfort. \n75. AHCH is the only Medicare certified home health agency in her area. \nMedicare-covered home health care from AHCH would be more frequent \nthan the care  she now receives and would free her from the taxing effort \nand discomfort ofhaving to go to the wound care clinic. \n(Doc. 13 at~~71-75). \nIn seeking reconsideration, Plaintiffs present two arguments.  First, they contend \nthey did not have an adequate opportunity to address the Secretary's demand billing \nargument as it arose late in the briefing on the motion to dismiss.  And second, they argue \nthat demand billing was not available to Ms. Masterman because her HHA refused to \naccept her as a patient and thus she never had a patient-provider relationship that could \ngive rise to demand billing.  See Doc. 60 at 3 (\"Here, the HHA did not enter a patient­\nprovider relationship with Ms. Masterman.\"). \nThe Secretary counters that reconsideration is unavailable because Plaintiffs present \nno new evidence or law for the court's consideration, and because Plaintiffs do not allege \nthat the HHA refused Ms. Masterman services even ifshe agreed to be personally \nfinancially responsible for them. \n3 \n\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 64   Filed 12/23/11   Page 4 of 5\nII. \t Conclusions of Law and Analysis. \nA. \t Standard of Review \nIn the Second Circuit, the standard for reconsideration is \"strict\" and \nreconsideration \"will generally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling \ndecisions or data that the court overlooked-matters, in other words, that might \nreasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.\"  Shrader v. CSX \nTransp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1995).  \"The major grounds justifying \nreconsideration are an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new \nevidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.\"  Virgin \nAtlantic Airways, Ltd. v. Nat 'I Mediation Bd., 956 F.2d 1245, 1255 (2d Cir. 1992).  It is \nin accordance with this exacting standard that Plaintiffs' partial motion must be \nconsidered. \nB. \t Whether Plaintiffs had an Adequate Opportunity to Address \n\nDemand Billing. \n\nPlaintiffs first argue that they lacked an adequate opportunity to respond to the \nSecretary's demand billing argument because it was raised for the first time in \nDefendant's reply memorandum.  This argument is unavailing.  Plaintiffs bear the burden \nof establishing the court's subject matter jurisdiction.  See Aurecchione v. Schoolman \nTransp. System, Inc., 426 F.3d 635,638 (2d Cir. 2005).  The motion to dismiss was \nextensively briefed by both parties and the issue of demand billing was squarely before \nthe court. \nPlaintiffs allege that Ms. Masterman cannot present her claims to the Secretary as \nrequired by the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. § 405(h) and thus the requirement to do so \nshould be excused.  Having made this argument, the burden was and is on Plaintiffs to \nmake the requisite factual showing to support it.  There can be no reasonable argument \nthat they did not have an incentive and opportunity to do so.  Accordingly, as an initial \nobservation, the court notes that the demand billing issue should and could have been \naddressed by Plaintiffs previously. \n4 \n\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 64   Filed 12/23/11   Page 5 of 5\nc. \nWhether Plaintiffs Have Established that Demand Billing is Unavailable. \nMore importantly, the facts before the court remain unchanged.  Plaintiffs argue \nthat demand billing was not available to Ms. Masterman because the only HHA \nreasonably available to her refused to enter into a provider-patient relationship with her \non any terms.  Their Amended Complaint, however, supports a contrary conclusion.  It \ndoes not allege, as Plaintiffs contend, that \"the sole HHA in Ms. Masterman's geographic \narea denied admission to Ms. Masterman and refused to accept her as a patient.\"  (Doc. \n60 at 2).  Rather, it alleges that Ms. Masterman was an existing patient of the HHA which \nhad provided services to her in the past but which refused to provide services for a \nchronic condition only because Medicare would not pay for them and she required long \nterm care.  There is nothing in the Amended Complaint that would allow the court to \nconclude or even infer that the HHA would have refused to provide services to Ms. \nMasterman even had she agreed to pay for them herself.  Moreover, Plaintiffs do not \nallege she was financially incapable of doing so.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have identified \nno new evidence which the court overlooked in determining whether Plaintiffs had \nestablished the court's subject matter jurisdiction over Ms. Masterman's claims. \nFor the foregoing reasons, partial reconsideration is hereby DENIED. \nSO ORDERED. \nrJ \n23\nDated at Rutland, in the District of Vermont, this  day of December, 2011. \nlsi Christina Reiss \nChristina Reiss, Chief Judge \nUnited States District Court \n5 ",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 7 of 32\nEither Party shall have the right to initiate steps to resolve any alleged \nnoncompliance with any provision of the Settlement Agreement, subject to limitations \nand standards set forth in the Settlement Agreement. \n1.  If one party (the “Initiating Party”) has good reason to believe that an \nissue of noncompliance exists, it will first give timely written notice to the other party \n(the “Responding Party”), including: (a) a reference to all specific provisions of the \nSettlement Agreement that are involved; (b) a statement of the issue; (c) a statement of \nthe remedial action sought by the Initiating Party; and (d) a brief statement of the specific \nfacts, circumstances, and any other arguments supporting the position of the Initiating \nParty; and (e) if there is a good faith basis for expedited resolution, the circumstances that \nmake expedited resolution appropriate, and the proposed date for a reasonable expedited \nresponse.  To be timely, such notice must be provided promptly.  Notice that is not \nprovided promptly because of a lack of diligence on the part of the Initiating Party shall \nnot serve as a basis for the Court to exercise jurisdiction as described in Section VI.4 \nabove.     \n2.  Within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving such timely notice or \nwithin a reasonable time for an expedited resolution, the Responding Party shall respond \nin writing to the statement of facts and arguments set forth in the notice and shall provide \nits written position, including the facts and arguments upon which it relies in support of \nits position. \n3.  The Parties shall undertake good-faith negotiations, including meeting and \nconferring by telephone or in person and exchanging relevant documents and/or other \ninformation, to attempt to resolve the alleged noncompliance.  The written notice set \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 8 of 32\nforth in Section VIII.1 may be amended solely to include issue(s) related to the original \nnotice that may arise during the meet-and-confer process described in this paragraph. \n4.  If the Initiating Party believes in good faith that efforts to resolve the \nmatter have failed or if sixty (60) calendar days have elapsed from the Receiving Party’s \nreceipt of timely notice, the Initiating Party, after providing written notice to the \nResponding Party, may file a motion with the Court, with a supporting brief, requesting \nresolution of the alleged noncompliance, provided however that the relief sought by such \nmotion shall be limited to the issue(s) of alleged noncompliance described in the written \nnotice, as to which the Parties have met and conferred as described in Section VIII.3. \n5.  The Responding Party shall be provided with appropriate notice of any \nsuch motion and an opportunity to be heard on the motion, as provided under the Civil \nLocal Rules of the District of Vermont and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n6.  The Initiating Party cannot seek contempt sanctions as a remedy for \nalleged noncompliance with the Settlement Agreement.  If, however, the Initiating Party \nsuccessfully argues to the Court that there has been a breach of the Agreement and \nobtains an order from the Court compelling the Responding Party to remedy the breach, \nand if the Responding Party subsequently violates that order, then the Initiating Party is \nfree to seek contempt sanctions for that violation.   \nIX.  INJUNCTIVE PROVISIONS \nManual Revisions \n1.   The agency will revise the relevant portions of Chapters 7, 8, and 15 of \nthe Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (MBPM) to clarify the coverage standards for the \nskilled nursing facility (SNF), home health (HH), and outpatient therapy (OPT) benefits \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 9 of 32\nwhen a patient has no restoration or improvement potential but when that patient needs \nskilled SNF, HH, or OPT services (SNF, HH, OPT “maintenance coverage standard”).  \nThe agency will also revise the relevant portions of Chapter 1, Section 110 of the MBPM \nto clarify the coverage standards for services performed in an inpatient rehabilitation \nfacility (IRF). \n2.  The manual revisions to be made pursuant to this Settlement Agreement \nwill clarify the SNF, HH, and OPT maintenance coverage standards and IRF coverage \nstandard only as set forth below in Sections IX.6 through IX.8.  Existing Medicare \neligibility requirements for coverage remain in effect.  Nothing in this Settlement \nAgreement modifies, contracts, or expands the existing eligibility requirements for \nreceiving Medicare coverage, including such requirements found in: \na.  Posthospital SNF Care, as set forth in 42 C.F.R. Part 409, Subparts \nC and D, and related subregulatory guidance; \nb.  Home Health Services, as set forth in 42 C.F.R.

CMS will revise or eliminate any manual provisions in Chapters 7, 8, and \n15 and Chapter 1, Section 110 of the MBPM that CMS determines are in conflict with the \nstandards set forth below in Sections IX.6 through IX.8.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 10 of 32\n4.  CMS will afford Plaintiffs’ Counsel 21 days to review and provide a \nsingle set of written comments on the manual provisions revised or eliminated as part of \nsettlement before the manual provisions are finalized and issued.  CMS will take any \nrecommendations from Plaintiffs’ Counsel under advisement and will make a good faith \neffort to utilize Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s reasonable recommendations that are limited to the \ncoverage standards as clarified in Sections IX.6 through IX.8 and that are consistent with \nthose coverage standards as well as all other statutory and regulatory requirements.  If \nplaintiffs request, CMS will also afford Plaintiffs’ Counsel a second opportunity for \nreview and comment on these manual revisions before the manual provisions are \nfinalized and issued; Plaintiffs’ Counsel will have 14 days to review any subsequent \nchanges made and either provide a second set of written comments or communicate its \ncomments at a meeting between counsel.  CMS will take any recommendations from \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel under advisement and will make a good faith effort to utilize \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel’s reasonable recommendations that are limited to the coverage \nstandards as clarified in Sections IX.6 through IX.8 and that are consistent with those \ncoverage standards as well as all other statutory and regulatory requirements.  CMS shall \nretain final authority as to the ultimate content of the manual provisions. \n5.  In providing any set of recommendations described in paragraph 4 above, \nPlaintiffs agree to collect all recommendations into one consolidated document to be \nprovided by Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel. \nMaintenance Coverage Standard for Therapy Services under the SNF, HH, and \nOPT Benefits  \n6.  Manual revisions will clarify that SNF, HH, and OPT coverage of therapy \nto perform a maintenance program does not turn on the presence or absence of a \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 11 of 32\nbeneficiary’s potential for improvement from the therapy, but rather on the beneficiary’s \nneed for skilled care.  \na.  The manual revisions will clarify that, under the SNF, HH, and \nOPT maintenance coverage standards, skilled therapy services are covered \nwhen an individualized assessment of the patient’s clinical condition \ndemonstrates that the specialized judgment, knowledge, and skills of a \nqualified therapist (“skilled care”) are necessary for the performance of a \nsafe and effective maintenance program.  Such a maintenance program to \nmaintain the patient’s current condition or to prevent or slow further \ndeterioration is covered so long as the beneficiary requires skilled care for \nthe safe and effective performance of the program.  When, however, the \nindividualized assessment does not demonstrate such a necessity for \nskilled care, including when the performance of a maintenance program \ndoes not require the skills of a therapist because it could safely and \neffectively be accomplished by the patient or with the assistance of non-\ntherapists, including unskilled caregivers, such maintenance services will \nnot be covered under the SNF, HH, or OPT benefits.   \nb.  The manual revisions will further clarify that, under the standard \nset forth in the previous paragraph (Section IX.6.a.), skilled care is \nnecessary for the performance of a safe and effective maintenance \nprogram only when (a) the particular patient’s special medical \ncomplications require the skills of a qualified therapist to perform a \ntherapy service that would otherwise be considered non-skilled; or (b) the \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 12 of 32\nneeded therapy procedures are of such complexity that the skills of a \nqualified therapist are required to perform the procedure.   \nc.  The manual revisions will further clarify that, to the extent \nprovided by regulation, the establishment or design of a maintenance \nprogram by a qualified therapist, the instruction of the beneficiary or \nappropriate caregiver by a qualified therapist regarding a maintenance \nprogram, and the necessary periodic reevaluations by a qualified therapist \nof the beneficiary and maintenance program are covered to the degree that \nthe specialized knowledge and judgment of a qualified therapist are \nrequired.  \nd.  The maintenance coverage standard for therapy as outlined in this \nsection does not apply to therapy services provided in an inpatient \nrehabilitation facility (IRF) or a comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation \nfacility (CORF).  \nMaintenance Coverage Standard for Nursing Services under the SNF and HH \nBenefits  \n7.  Manual revisions will clarify that SNF and HH coverage of nursing care \ndoes not turn on the presence or absence of an individual’s potential for improvement \nfrom the nursing care, but rather on the beneficiary’s need for skilled care.   \na.  The manual revisions will clarify that, under the SNF and HH \nbenefits, skilled nursing services are covered when an individualized \nassessment of the patient’s clinical condition demonstrates that the \nspecialized judgment, knowledge, and skills of a registered nurse or, when \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 13 of 32\nprovided by regulation, a licensed practical (vocational) nurse (“skilled \ncare”) are necessary.  Skilled nursing services would be covered where \nsuch skilled nursing services are necessary to maintain the patient’s \ncurrent condition or prevent or slow further deterioration so long as the \nbeneficiary requires skilled care for the services to be safely and \neffectively provided.  When, however, the individualized assessment does \nnot demonstrate such a necessity for skilled care, including when the \nservices needed do not require skilled nursing care because they could \nsafely and effectively be performed by the patient or unskilled caregivers, \nsuch services will not be covered under the SNF or HH benefits. \nb.  The manual revisions will further clarify that, under the standard \nset forth in the previous paragraph (Section IX.7.a.), skilled nursing care is \nnecessary only when (a) the particular patient’s special medical \ncomplications require the skills of a registered nurse or, when provided by \nregulation, a licensed practical nurse to perform a type of service that \nwould otherwise be considered non-skilled; or (b) the needed services are \nof such complexity that the skills of a registered nurse or, when provided \nby regulation, a licensed practical nurse are required to furnish the \nservices.  To be considered a skilled service, the service must be so \ninherently complex that it can be safely and effectively performed only by, \nor under the supervision of, professional or technical personnel as \nprovided by regulation, including 42 C.F.R. 409.32.   \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 14 of 32\nc.  The maintenance coverage standard for nursing services as \noutlined in this section does not apply to nursing services provided in an \ninpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) or a comprehensive outpatient \nrehabilitation facility (CORF).  \nIRF Coverage Standard \n8.  Manual revisions will clarify that an IRF claim could never be denied for \nthe following reasons: (1) because a patient could not be expected to achieve complete \nindependence in the domain of self-care or (2) because a patient could not be expected to \nreturn to his or her prior level of functioning.   \nEducational Campaign \n9.  CMS will engage in a nationwide educational campaign, as set forth in the \nfollowing Sections IX.10 through IX.14, which will use written materials and interactive \nforums with providers and contractors, to communicate the SNF, home health, and OPT \nmaintenance coverage standards and the IRF coverage standards as set forth in Sections \nIX.6 through IX.8. \n10.

For both National Calls, CMS will prepare a deck of PowerPoint \nslides to assist in communicating the policy clarifications reflected by the \nmanual revisions.  Before these slides are finalized, CMS will afford \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel at least 7 days to review and provide a single set of \nwritten comments on the slides.  CMS will take any recommendations \nfrom Plaintiffs’ Counsel under advisement and will make a good faith \neffort to utilize in the final presentation Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s reasonable \nrecommendations that are limited to the coverage standards as clarified in \nSections IX.6 through IX.8 and that are consistent with those coverage \nstandards as well as all other statutory and regulatory requirements.

Following the issuance of the manual revisions, CMS \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 19 of 32\nwill also include an announcement of the manual revisions as an \nagenda item for a Medicare Beneficiary ombudsman ODF. \ne.  CMS will post the Program Transmittal and MLN Matters article \non CMS’s website, www.CMS.gov.  CMS will inform Plaintiffs’ Lead \nCounsel when the Program Transmittal is issued.   \n15.  CMS will make a good faith effort to notify Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel, in \nadvance of the National Calls and Open Door Forums described above in Section IX.14 \nto be held to carry out the educational campaign provided in the settlement agreement.  \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel will be permitted to attend the Open Door Forums and \nthe National Call for providers and suppliers described above in Section IX.14.  \nFollowing the National Call for contractors and adjudicators described above in Section \nIX.14.b, CMS, through counsel, will provide to Plaintiffs’ Counsel (1) a certification that \nthis National Call occurred; (2) a certification that guidance was given consistent with the \nPowerPoint slides described in Section IX.14.c and the manual revisions revised as part \nof this Settlement Agreement as set forth in Sections IX.6 through IX.8; (3) a certification \nthat any questions from contractors or adjudicators were answered consistent with those \nmanual revisions; and (4) a summary prepared by CMS of the questions posed and \nanswers provided during this National Call. \n16.

CMS will engage in the following measures: \na.  Sampling of QIC Decisions: CMS will develop protocols for \nreviewing a random sample of SNF, HH, and OPT coverage decisions by \nthe QICs (for claims under Parts A, B, and C) under the SNF, HH, and \nOPT maintenance coverage standards set forth above in Sections IX.6 \nthrough IX.7 to determine overall trends and any problems in the \napplication of these maintenance coverage standards.  CMS will make a \nreasonable effort to draw the random sample of QIC decisions to reflect \nclaims initially decided by a representative cross-section of contractors \nand MA Organizations.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel may provide suggestions to \nCMS as to how to identify appropriate claims for sampling, e.g., through \ntarget diagnosis codes.   \nb.  CMS will provide updates to Plaintiffs’ Counsel regarding the \nresults of this random sampling during the bi-annual meetings referenced \nbelow in Section IX.17.f, beginning with the first meeting following \ncompletion of the educational campaign (which will be the second of the \nfive bi-annual meetings).  CMS’s obligation to conduct sampling of QIC \ndecisions as described above in Section IX.17.a pursuant to this Settlement \nAgreement terminates with the results reported at the fifth and final of the \nbi-annual meetings. \nc.  For any QIC decision from the random sample in which CMS \nfinds reason to believe an error was made in applying the correct SNF, \nHH, and OPT maintenance coverage standards as set forth in Sections \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 21 of 32\nIX.6 and IX.7, CMS will contact the QIC to determine whether an error \nwas made.  For those decisions in which an error by the QIC is confirmed, \nCMS will direct, or request if the agency does not have authority to direct, \nthe QIC to correct its error.   \nd.  If the random sampling indicates that a particular Medicare \ncontractor or MA organization is not applying the correct SNF, HH, and \nOPT maintenance coverage standards as set forth in Sections IX.6 and \nIX.7, CMS will address this issue directly with that entity.  The manner in \nwhich CMS addresses the issue will be within its discretion.   \ne.  Review of Individual Claims Determinations: To address any \nindividual beneficiary claims determinations that Plaintiffs believe were \nnot decided in accordance with the SNF, HH, and OPT maintenance \ncoverage standards as set forth above in Sections IX.6 and IX.7, CMS will \nagree to review and address individual claims determinations as follows: \n1.  During the bi-annual meetings referenced below in \nSection IX.17.f, Plaintiffs will present CMS (through \nPlaintiffs’ Lead Counsel) individual claims determinations \nit believes were not decided in accordance with the SNF, \nHH, and OPT maintenance coverage standards as set forth \nin Sections IX.6 and IX.7.  The total number of such \nindividual claims determinations Plaintiffs’ Counsel \npresents over the course of all bi-annual meetings is not to \nexceed 100.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 22 of 32\n2.  CMS will direct, or request if the agency does not have \nauthority to direct, the pertinent Medicare contractors or \nMA Organizations to review and evaluate these claims and \nrelated documentation.  If the review of such claims \nindicates that a particular Medicare contractor or MA \norganization is not applying the correct SNF, HH, and \nOPT maintenance coverage standard as set forth in \nSections IX.6 and IX.7, CMS will address this issue \ndirectly with that entity.  The manner in which CMS \naddresses the issue will be within its discretion.  Workload \npermitting, CMS will provide updates to Plaintiffs’ Lead \nCounsel regarding the action taken on these cases during \nthe subsequent bi-annual meeting referenced below in \nSection IX.17.f , provided that CMS receives proper \nauthorization from the beneficiary.    \nf.  Bi-Annual Meetings: CMS will meet with Plaintiffs’ Counsel on a bi-\nannual basis to discuss the results of the sampling of claims data and the \nagency’s review of the individual claims determinations as discussed \nabove in Sections IX.17.a-b and IX.17.e.  The meetings can also be used \nto bring any issues related to the settlement to the agency’s attention.  \nThe first of these meetings will take place following the issuance of the \nrevised manual provisions and prior to the completion of the educational \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 23 of 32\ncampaign, and meetings will continue on a bi-annual basis thereafter for a \ntotal of five (5) meetings.   \n18.  The Parties recognize that Defendant's obligations are met under the \nSettlement Agreement once it has complied with the terms of this Settlement Agreement, \nand that Defendant is not guaranteeing to Plaintiffs that certain results will be achieved \nonce the steps set forth in this Settlement Agreement have been implemented. \nX.  ATTORNEY’S FEES \nDefendant agrees to pay reasonable and appropriate attorney’s fees, costs, and \nexpenses related to work performed by Plaintiffs’ Counsel in the litigation and settlement \nof this matter up until the Approval Date, subject to appropriate documentation and \nexercise of business judgment by Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel, pursuant to the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act.  For work performed by Plaintiffs’ Counsel after the Approval \nDate, Defendant agrees to pay reasonable and appropriate attorney’s fees, costs, and \nexpenses only for the post-Approval Date work specified in this Settlement Agreement, \nto be capped at $300,000, subject to appropriate documentation and exercise of business \njudgment by Plaintiffs and their attorneys and pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice \nAct.  However, if Plaintiffs initiate proceedings to enforce this Settlement Agreement, as \ndescribed above, and if the Court finds that Defendant has not complied with the \nSettlement Agreement, Plaintiffs reserve the right to seek the payment of additional fees, \ncosts, and expenses in connection with that enforcement proceeding that will not be \nsubject to the above cap.  Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel may submit request(s) for post-\nApproval fees to Defendant’s Counsel for periods no less than 12 months in length, \nexcept for the last period if one or more earlier periods has been for more than 12 months.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 24 of 32\nIn the event that the parties are unable to agree upon the amount of fees, Plaintiffs may \nretain the right to file a fee petition with the Court.  Notwithstanding their agreement to \nlimit any post-Approval attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses to the above fee cap, \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel object to the principle of a fee cap and reserve their \nright to object to such a cap in future cases.  \nXI.  CLASS CERTIFICATION AND RELIEF \nClass Definition \n1.  Defendant will stipulate to the certification of a class pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) consisting of all Medicare beneficiaries who: \na.  received skilled nursing or therapy services in a skilled nursing \nfacility, home health setting, or outpatient setting; and  \nb.  received a denial of Medicare coverage (in part or in full) for those \nservices described in the previous paragraph based on a lack of \nimprovement potential in violation of the SNF, HH, or OPT maintenance \ncoverage standards as defined above in section Sections IX.6 and IX.7 and \nthat denial became final and non-appealable on or after January 18, 2011; \nand     \nc.  seek Medicare coverage on his or her own behalf; the definition of \nclass members specifically excludes providers or suppliers of Medicare \nservices or a Medicaid State Agency.   \nRe-Review Relief for Certain Members of the Class \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 25 of 32\n2.  Certain members of the class are eligible for re-review of the claim denials \ndescribed above in Section XI.1.b, if the following requirements are met:  \na.  The services described above in Section XI.1.a that are the subject \nof the denial described above in Section XI.1.b must not have been \ncovered or paid for by any third-party payer or insurer or Medicare, except \nin the case of an individual Medicare beneficiary whose services were \npaid for by Medicaid and who paid for the service or is personally or \nfinancially liable or subject to recovery for the services; and  \nb.  There must not have been a basis for the denial of the claim for \nMedicare coverage that was separate and independent from the alleged \nfailure to apply the SNF, HH, or OPT maintenance coverage standards as \ndefined above in Sections IX.6 and IX.7.  A separate and independent \nbasis for denial would include the failure to satisfy any procedural \nrequirement, any Medicare eligibility requirement, or any threshold \nrequirement for coverage, but a conclusory determination that services \nwere not “reasonable and necessary,” were not “medically necessary,” or \nthat coverage is denied using other conclusory, non-specific language, that \nmay be based on a failure to apply the SNF, HH, or OPT maintenance \ncoverage standards as defined in Sections IX.6 and IX.7 above would not \nbe such a separate and independent basis for denial.  \n3.  Claim denials described in Section XI.1.b that become final and non-\nappealable after the End of the Educational Campaign are not eligible for re-review under \nthis Section (XI). \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 26 of 32\n4.  Claims of class members other than of the Named Plaintiffs that are \ncurrently the subject of any lawsuit pending in an Article III United States Court or have \nbeen the subject of a final, non-appealable judgment by such courts are not eligible for re-\nreview under this Section (XI). \n5.  Only class members on their own behalf may receive re-review of claims \nunder this section. No provider or supplier of Medicare services or Medicaid State \nAgency is permitted to receive re-review under this section on behalf of or by assignment \nfrom a class member. \n6.  Class members who are eligible for re-review of claim denials will be \npartitioned into two groups.   \na.  Group 1 consists of all class members who received a final, non-\nappealable denial of Medicare coverage (in part or in full) where that \ndenial became final and non-appealable after January 18, 2011 and up to \nand including the Approval Date. \nb.  Group 2 consists of all class members who received a final, non-\nappealable denial of Medicare coverage (in part or in full) from the day \nafter the Approval Date through and including the End of the Educational \nCampaign.   \n7.  Group 1 class members seeking re-review relief as set forth  in this \nSection (XI) will be required to identify themselves and their final, non-appealable \ndenials to CMS no later than six (6) months after the End of the Educational Campaign.  \nGroup 2 class members seeking re-review relief as set forth in this Section (XI) will be \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 27 of 32\nrequired to identify themselves and their final, non-appealable denials to CMS no later \nthan twelve (12) months after the End of the Educational Campaign. \n8.  For each Group 1 or 2 class member who identifies himself or herself to \nCMS within the specified timeframe for re-review as set forth in the previous paragraph, \nthe agency will direct, or request if the agency does not have the authority to direct, the \ncontractor or adjudicator who last denied the class member’s claim for Medicare \ncoverage to re-review the claim under the clarified maintenance coverage standards set \nforth above in Sections IX.6 and IX.7, subject to the exceptions described above in \nSections XI.4 and XI.5.  \n9.  When results of the re-review process confirm that the claim was denied in \nerror and that the care should have been covered by Medicare, the agency will reimburse \nfor that care, or, if the agency does not have the authority to reimburse, request \nreimbursement for the class member for that care, subject to applicable Medicare \nreimbursement limits.   \n10.  Within 10 days of Approval of this Settlement Agreement, Defendant will \ninform Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel of the process, including to whom class members should \nidentify themselves (pursuant to Section XI.7 through XI.8), by which class members \nshould identify themselves in order to obtain re-review. \n11.  Within 30 days after the End of the Educational Campaign, Plaintiffs’ \nLead Counsel shall provide Defendant with the final claim denial that Ms. Jimmo \nreceived that is at issue in this lawsuit.  Defendant shall promptly process Ms. Jimmo’s \nclaim under the re-review process as set forth in Section XI.2 through XI.10.  Defendant \n27 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 28 of 32\nshall make a good faith effort to issue a final decision on Ms. Jimmo’s claim, if \nappropriate, as soon as practicable. \nXII.  COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL AUTHORITY \nThe parties recognize that Defendant is required to comply with applicable \nstatutes and regulations, including any future revisions to the statutes and regulations that \ngovern Medicare coverage, and that nothing in this Settlement Agreement shall prohibit \nDefendant from modifying its policies and procedures to comply with any relevant \nstatutory or regulatory changes, even if such modifications are made during the period of \nthe Court’s continuing jurisdiction under this Settlement Agreement, or from otherwise \nchanging Defendant’s regulations in a manner consistent with the Administrative \nProcedure Act.  If Plaintiffs’ Counsel believes that any such modifications to Defendant’s \npolicies and procedures, such as the Medicare Benefits Policy Manual, are not authorized \nby any statutory or regulatory changes, and that any such modifications would constitute \na breach of any of the provisions of this Settlement Agreement, they reserve the right to \ninitiate the Dispute Resolution process in Section VIII. \nXIII.  RELEASE \n1.  In consideration for the promises of Defendant as set forth in this \nSettlement Agreement, the Named Plaintiffs and all Class Members, and their heirs, \nadministrators, successors, or assigns (together, the “Releasors”), hereby release and \nforever discharge Defendant and the United States Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS), along with Defendant's and HHS's  administrators, successors, officers, \nemployees, and agents (together, the “Releasees”) from any and all claims and causes of \naction that have been asserted or could have been asserted in this action by reason of, or \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 29 of 32\nwith respect to, Plaintiffs'  allegations that Defendant has illegally applied, or has failed \nto properly prevent the application of, an Improvement Standard under which Medicare \ncoverage of skilled services is denied on the basis that a Medicare beneficiary is not \nimproving, without regard to an individualized assessment of the beneficiary’s medical \ncondition and the reasonableness and necessity of the treatment, care or services in \nquestion.   \n2.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  This is an action for declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief against \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) as the official responsible for \nimplementing and enforcing the Medicare program.  Under the Medicare statute and \nregulations, coverage is available for health care and therapy services that are \"reasonable \nand necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury.\"  This standard requires \nthe evaluation for coverage on the basis of a beneficiary'S unique condition and \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 2 of 37\nindividual needs.  The Secretary, however, imposes a covert rule of thumb that operates \nas an additional and illegal condition of coverage and results in the termination, \nreduction, or denial of coverage for thousands of Medicare beneficiaries annually. \n2.  This additional condition of eligibility, which is usually implemented at \nthe lower levels of Medicare's administrative review process where the overwhelming \nmajority of decisions are made, is referred to and implemented by one or more of several \nphrases, including that the beneficiary needs \"maintenance services only,\" has \n\"plateaued,\" or is \"chronic,\" \"medically stable,\" or not improving.  The shorthand term \nfor this rule of thumb masquerading as a condition of coverage is the Improvement \nStandard. \n3.  The Improvement Standard is not supported by the Medicare statute or \nregulations.  Because it has been implemented without notice-and-comment rulemaking \nand without publication in the Federal Register, beneficiaries have little or no \nunderstanding of its application and cannot know, andlor do not have the resources, to \nseek further review.  Despite numerous court decisions repudiating the Improvement \nStandard and dictating that each beneficiary's situation should be evaluated on an \nindividualized basis, the Improvement Standard continues to be applied, especially by \nemployees of Medicare contractors and intermediaries who ignore the correct coverage \nstandards.  The regular, on-going application of the Improvement Standard in this context \namounts to a clandestine policy that is condoned and implemented by the Secretary. \n4.  The impact of the Improvement Standard falls primarily on patients with \nchronic conditions.  As their health deteriorates their need for nursing services and \nphysical, occupational, and speech therapies increases.  The skilled care denied them \n2 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 3 of 37\nunder the Improvement Standard is critical to slow their disease process and to maintain \ntheir functional ability, yet these are precisely the patients who are most likely to have \ntheir coverage denied, terminated, or reduced. \nS.  The Improvement Standard operates as a covert condition of coverage that \nsimultaneously deprives beneficiaries of coverage to which they are entitled while \neffectively denying them the ability to correct its application.  It violates the Medicare \nstatute and regulations, the Administrative Procedure Act's and the Medicare statute's \nrequirements for notice-and-comment rulemaking, the Freedom of Information Act's \nrequirement of publication, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n6.  On behalf of themselves, their members and constituents, and the \nnationwide class of Medicare beneficiaries whom they represent and who are harmed by \nthe Improvement Standard, the plaintiffs -- national organizations and individual \nbeneficiaries -- seek declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief to terminate application \nof the Improvement Standard and to provide remedies to those illegally denied coverage \nas a result of its application. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  Jurisdiction is conferred on this court by 28 U.S.C. §§  1331 and 1361 and \nby 42 U.S.C. § 40S(g), as incorporated by 42 U.S.C. §§ 139Sff(b)(1)(A) and 139Sw-\n22(g)(S).  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) and 42 U.S.C. § \n40S(g). \nIII.  PARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff GLENDA JIMMO was born in 1936 and is a resident of Bristol, \nVermont.  At all relevant times she has been eligible for Medicare Parts A and B.  A \n3 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 4 of 37\ndecision by an administrative law judge, dated June 16, 2010, denied her coverage for \nhome health services furnished to her between January 14,2007 and January 8, 2008. \nThat decision was affirmed by the Medicare Appeals Council in a decision dated \nDecember 28,2010. \n9.  PlaintiffKR was born in 1960 and is a resident of Bennington, Vermont. \nShe is represented in this action by her guardian.  At all relevant times she has been \neligible for Medicare Parts A and B.  A decision by an administrative law judge, dated \nNovember 16,2010, denied her coverage for home health skilled therapy services \nprovided from September 26, 2008 to December 18, 2008.  That decision was appealed to \nthe Medicare Appeals Council on December 22, 2010. \n10.  Plaintiff MIRIAM KATZ, the widow of David Katz, is named as the \nexecutor in his will.  David Katz was born in 1920 and was a resident of Bloomfield, \nConnecticut before he died on December 25,2010.  At all relevant times he was eligible \nfor Medicare Parts A and B.  In a reconsideration decision on expedited review by a \nQualified Independent Contractor on December 3, 2010, coverage for his skilled nursing \nfacility care was denied beginning December 1,2010. \n11.  Plaintiff EDITH MASTERMAN was born in 1931 and lives in Wilton, \nMaine.  At all relevant times she was eligible for Medicare Parts A and B.  Because the \nonly Medicare certified home health agency in her area has determined, pursuant to the \nImprovement Standard, that she would not be covered under Medicare for its services, \nshe cannot receive care from that agency, obtain an initial Medicare determination that \nthose services are not covered, or appeal the denial of Medicare coverage. \n12.  Plaintiff MARY PATRICIA BOITANO was born in 1927 and is a \n4 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 5 of 37\nresident of Narragansett, Rhode Island.  Ms. Boitano is eligible for Medicare Parts A and \nB, and was at all relevant times enrolled in a Part C Medicare Advantage program, \nSecured Horizons (also known as \"United HealthCare\").  In a decision on a \"fast-track\" \nappeal on November 22,2010, Medicare coverage for her skilled nursing facility care \nwas denied beginning November 23,2010. \n13.  Plaintiff NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE SOCIAL \nSECURITY AND MEDICARE is a nationwide membership organization, headquartered \nin Washington, D.C., that seeks to protect and preserve the financial security, health, and \nwell being of current and future generations of maturing Americans. \n14.  Plaintiff NATIONAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY is a \nnationwide organization, headquartered in New York, N.Y., that seeks to eradicate \nmultiple sclerosis by stopping disease progression and preventing the disease in future \ngenerations, while restoring function and providing and advocating for enhanced care and \nsupport for those already affected by or living with this chronic disease. \n15.  Plaintiff PARKINSON'S ACTION NETWORK is a nationwide \norganization, headquartered in Washington, D.C., that seeks to eliminate Parkinson's \ndisease and to improve the quality of life for people living with it. \n16.  Plaintiff PARALYZED VETERANS OF AMERICA is a nationwide \nmembership organization, headquartered in Washington, D.C., that seeks to find cures for \nspinal cord injury and spinal disease and to improve the quality of life for its members \nand for all people with spinal cord injury or disease. \n17.  Plaintiff AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND \nREHABILITATION is a nationwide physician membership organization, headquartered \n5 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 6 of 37\nin Rosemont, Ill., that advocates on behalf of its members, whose specialty is physical \nmedicine and rehabilitation, and on behalf of those with injuries, pain, and disabling \nconditions whom its members serve. \n18.  Defendant KATHLEEN SEBELIUS is the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices (HHS) and is responsible for the overall operation of the Medicare program \nthrough the HHS division known as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n(CMS).  She is sued in her official capacity. \nIV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n19.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly \nsituated, pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The \nclass is defined as: \nAll beneficiaries of Medicare Parts A, B, or C who have had or will have \ncoverage for health care or therapy services, as an outpatient, in a hospital, in a \nskilled nursing facility, or in a home health care setting, denied, terminated, or \nreduced due to the application of the Improvement Standard, on or after January \n1,2006. \n20.  Joinder is impracticable due to the large number of class members and for \nother reasons, including, but not limited to, their geographic diversity, their ages and/or \ndisabilities, and their relatively low incomes.  On information and belief, plaintiffs \nestimate the class to include at least tens of thousands of members. \n21.  There are questions of fact and law common to the class members. \nCommon facts include, inter alia, that all class members have had their Medicare \n6 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 7 of 37\ncoverage reduced, denied, or terminated on the ground that their conditions were not \nimproving.  The common questions of law include, inter alia, whether the Secretary \nviolates the Medicare statute in imposing this covert condition of eligibility and whether \nthat policy has been implemented in violation of procedural rules such as the notice-and \ncomment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Medicare statute. \n22.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of those of the class \nmembers in that they have been denied Medicare coverage, despite satisfying the \nstatute's reasonable and necessary requirement, because of the application of the \nImprovement Standard. \n23.  The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass.  They have no interest that is or may be potentially antagonistic to the interests of \nthe class and seek the same relief as the class members, that is, a prohibition against the \ncontinued use of the Improvement Standard.  Moreover, plaintiffs are represented by \ncompetent counsel from established public interest law firms, the Center for Medicare \nAdvocacy, Inc. and the Medicare Advocacy Project of Vermont Legal Aid.  The \nattorneys are experienced in federal litigation involving public benefit programs in \ngeneral and Medicare in particular, have litigated other cases involving the Improvement \nStandard, and have represented classes in numerous other cases involving Medicare and \nother public benefit programs. \n24.  The Secretary has acted and continues to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the class as a whole, thereby making appropriate final injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole, pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n7 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 8 of 37\nv.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK \nA.  Overview \n25.  Medicare, which is codified as Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, is \nthe federally funded and administered program of health insurance for those who are 65 \nand over or are disabled.  Under Part A of Medicare, for which eligibility is automatic for \nrecipients of Social Security old age and disability benefits (Title II of the Social Security \nAct), beneficiaries are entitled to coverage for hospital, skilled nursing facility care, home \nhealth care, and hospice services.  Part B of Medicare establishes a voluntary program of \nsupplemental medical insurance providing coverage for physicians, nurse practitioners, \nhome health, physical, speech and occupational therapy, diagnostic services, and durable \nmedical equipment.  Under Part C (the Medicare Advantage program), beneficiaries may \nopt to enroll in a managed care plan in lieu of the traditional approach in \"original \nMedicare\" as provided in Parts A and B. \n26.  The threshold for Medicare coverage is its medical necessity requirement, \nwhich states in applicable part that \"no payment may be made ... for any expenses \nincurred for items or services which ... are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis \nor treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body \nmember.\"  42 U.S.c. § 1395y(a)(l)(A). \n27.  Other than the reference in the last clause of subsection 1395y(a)(l )(A) to \ncoverage for \"improv[ing] the functioning of a malformed body member,\" the Medicare \nstatute does not state or imply at any point that improvement, or any comparable \nphraseology, is a condition of coverage. \n8 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 9 of 37\nB.  The Regulatory Requirements \n28.  The relevant regulation for coverage in the skilled nursing facility (SNF) \ncontext makes it clear that the Improvement Standard does not determine coverage: \"The \nrestoration potential of a patient is not the deciding factor in determining whether skilled \nservices are needed.  Even if full recovery or medical improvement is not possible, a \npatient may need skilled services to prevent further deterioration or preserve current \ncapabilities.\"  42 C.F.R. § 409.32(c).  The regulations applicable to coverage of home \nhealth care incorporate by reference the definition of skilled nursing care and thus the \nabove standard.  42 C.F.R. § 409.44(b)(1). \n29.  The regulations further dictate, in defining the \"reasonable and necessary\" \nstandard, that the individual's \"unique\" situation is the cornerstone for coverage.  The \nhome health regulation states in part: \"The intermediary's decision on whether care is \nreasonable and necessary is based on information ... concerning the unique medical \ncondition ofthe individual beneficiary.\"  42 C.F.R. § 409.44(a).  It further dictates that \n\"[t]he determination of whether skilled nursing care is reasonable and necessary must be \nbased solely upon the beneficiary'S unique condition and individual needs, without regard \nto whether the illness or injury is acute, chronic, terminal, or expected to last a long \ntime.\"  42 C.F.R. § 409.44(b)(3)(iii). \n30.  The home health regulations related to physical, speech, and occupational \ntherapy provide for Medicare coverage for services to restore or to maintain function.  42 \nC.F.R. § 409.44(c)(2). \n31.  Many of CMS' manual provisions support and reinforce the regulatory \n9 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 10 of 37\nprohibition against an Improvement Standard as a condition of coverage.  The Medicare \nBenefit Policy Manual (MBPM) states that the determination of whether a skilled service \nis reasonable and necessary cannot be based on \"rules of thumb,\" but instead requires \nassessment of the particular individual's need for care.  Internet Only Manual (lOM) 100-\n02, MBPM, ch. 7, §§ 20.3, 40.2.  The Manual reiterates the regulatory language requiring \nassessment \"of the beneficiary's unique condition and individual needs\" and adds that \n\"skilled care may, depending on the unique condition of the patient, continue to be \nnecessary for patients whose condition is stable.\" ld., § 40.1.1. \n32.  Lower level decision-makers, however, rarely follow these regulatory and \nManual prohibitions against the Improvement Standard.  Instead, they rely on other \npolicy provisions, Medicare contractor instructions, and Local Coverage Determinations \n(LCDs).  LCDs are created by individual contractors to provide guidance in those \njurisdictions in which they operate.  LCDs often employ language that enforces an \nImprovement Standard.  See, e.g., LCD ID # L23604 (\"There must be an expectation that \nthe condition will improve significantly in a reasonable and generally predictable period \nof time ....\" ); LCD ID # L340 (\"The documentation supports the expectation that the \nbeneficiary'S condition will improve significantly in a reasonable and generally \npredictable period of time. \").  As a rule, lower level decision-makers will rely on more \nrestrictive internal guidelines, policies, and LCDs rather than on contrary regulations or \nManual provisions.  LCDs are not binding on administrative law judges. \n10 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 11 of 37\nC.  The Administrative Review Process \n33.  Under original Medicare (Parts A and B), a beneficiary who has been \ninformed by the provider that the services at issue are not expected to be covered must \nobtain an \"initial determination\" from the Medicare contractor.  This formal statement of \nnon-coverage is provided as part of the Medicare Summary Notice (MSN), which the \ncontractors issue on a quarterly basis. \n34.  Under the standard review process, the beneficiary requests review of the \nMSN \"initial determination\" by filing for a redetermination by the Medicare contractor. \nIf the decision remains adverse, the beneficiary may seek reconsideration from the \nQualified Independent Contractor (QIC). \n35.  Under the expedited review process that is available for discharge from a \nSNF, home health care, or a hospice, the provider must generally give notice two days \nbefore the discharge or termination occurs.  The beneficiary has until noon of the next \ncalendar day to request an expedited determination by the Quality Improvement \nOrganization (QIO).  If the QIO upholds the provider's decision, the beneficiary has until \nnoon of the next calendar day to seek reconsideration from the QIC. \n36.  The remaining steps are the same for both standard and expedited review. \nThese include a de novo review by an administrative law judge (ALl) if the amount in \ncontroversy is at least $130 in 2010 and 2011 and an on-the-record review of the ALl's \ndecision by the Medicare Appeals Council (MAC), with the same amounts in \ncontroversy.  Review in federal district court is then available for cases in which the \n11 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 12 of 37\namount in controversy is at least $1,300 in 2011. \n37.  For claims under Part C (the Medicare Advantage or MA program), the \ninitial determination, which is known as an \"organization determination,\" and the \nreconsideration determination, if fully favorable, are both made by the Medicare \nAdvantage plan, in both the standard and expedited processes.  When a reconsideration \ndetermination will be adverse to the beneficiary, the case is automatically sent to the \nIndependent Review Entity (IRE), which is an external review organization hired by \nCMS for the purpose of reviewing decisions by MA plans and which will issue the \nreconsideration decision. \n38.  The remaining available steps after IRE review are the same as for Parts A \nand B: ALl, MAC, and federal district court. \n39.  If the MAC fails to issue its decision within the appropriate time frames \n(which is usually 90 days from receipt of the request for review), the appellant may \nrequest escalation of the case to federal district court. \n40.  Under Parts A and B, a beneficiary cannot obtain a coverage decision \nprior to receiving the care.  Consequently, access to and proceeding through the system of \nadministrative review requires the beneficiary's obligation to pay for the care or services. \nBeneficiaries confronted with having to pay for care for which coverage may be denied \noften decline the needed care because their financial situation makes it difficult or \nimpossible to pay.  As a consequence, they are unable to obtain administrative review of \ntheir right to Medicare coverage.  Under Part C, a beneficiary can receive a coverage \n12 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 13 of 37\ndecision prior to receiving the care or services at issue. \nD.  Application of the Improvement Standard  Below the ALJ Level \n41.  Upon information and belief, it is the standard practice of providers, \ncontractors, QIOs, QICs, and IREs to apply LCDs and internal guidelines and policies \nthat establish the Improvement Standard as a rule of thumb on which Medicare coverage \nis conditioned, in disregard of the regulatory and manual provisions that require a \ncoverage determination to be based on the beneficiary's individual condition and needs. \nThis approach holds true for decisions made under each of Parts A, B, and C. \n42.  The application of the Improvement Standard at the lower levels of review \nimposes an additional condition of eligibility.  It has the twofold effect of denying \ncoverage to beneficiaries who are entitled to it and discouraging them from seeking \nreview because the Improvement Standard, as stated, appears to be impossible to \novercome. \n43.  In 2008, only about 1.7% of all Part A denied claims and 1.8% of all Part \nB denied claims were appealed to the next level, the redetermination level.  CMS, \"Fact \nSheet: Original Medicare (Fee-For-Service) Appeals Data - 2008,\" at 2, available at \ncms.gov/OrgMedFFSAppeals/Downloads/Feeshet2008.pdf.  Only about 0.5% of Part A \ndenied claims and 0.22% of Part B denied claims were appealed to the reconsideration \nlevel.  Id. at 6.  In FY 2008, the number of all Medicare appeals taken to ALJs was \n32,960, which included 185,665 claims.  Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals \nwebsite, at http://www.hhs.gov/omha/resources/index.html.  Estimating and extrapolating \n13 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 14 of 37\nfrom these figures suggest that the percentage of adverse initial denials that reach the ALJ \nlevel is extremely small, probably in the range of 0.02% to 0.05%.  Furthermore, the \npercentage of adverse initial determinations based on the Improvement Standard is \nprobably lower still than the overall percentage because beneficiaries are less likely to \nappeal when the Improvement Standard is applied to them.  They generally do not appeal \nbecause the Improvement Standard, as it is presented to them, suggests that they cannot \nsucceed on appeal.  Accordingly, on information and belief, only a minuscule percentage \nof beneficiaries who are denied based on the Improvement Standard appeal the denial to \nthe ALJ level. \n44.  Upon information and belief, the Secretary is aware that the Improvement \nStandard is consistently imposed by her Medicare contractors but has not taken action to \nrequire that the proper policies be carried out.  This refusal to correct the situation has \noccurred despite numerous federal court decisions repudiating the Improvement Standard \nas a condition of coverage. \nVI.  FACTUAL STATEMENT \nPlaintiff Glenda Jimmo \n45.  During the periods at issue, plaintiff Glenda Jimmo was a 71-year-old \nresident of Vermont who was legally blind and had a below-the-knee amputation.  She \nsuffered from diabetes mellitus with circulatory disorder, transient cerebral ischemia, \nperipheral vascular disease, angina, and, later, diverticulitis.  Transient cerebral ischemia \nis a serious disorder that could lead to a stroke or death of brain cells and may be caused \n14 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 15 of 37\nby uncontrolled diabetes.  Peripheral vascular disease is also a serious disorder with the \npossibility of blood clots, open sores, and tissue death.  Possible complications of angina \ninclude heart attack or death. During the time periods in question, Ms. Jimmo suffered \nchest pains.  Her physician prescribed over twenty medications to address these disorders. \nThese medications included nitroglycerine, an overdose of which can cause seizures or a \ncoma. \n46.  As a result of her substantial, disabling medical conditions, her physician \nordered intermittent skilled nursing and home health aide nursing services to be provided \nin her home.  Her physician certified her need for these services on the plan of care and \nalso certified that she was homebound. \n47.  Her claims for Medicare coverage for the home health services received \nfrom January 14,2007 to January 8, 2008 were denied initially and at the redetermination \nlevel.  In denying her coverage at redetermination, the Medicare contractor stated that \n\"[h]er condition was stable with no acute changes.\" \n48.  At the reconsideration level of review, the QIC affirmed the denial of \ncoverage, stating, inter alia, that \"[t]he likelihood of a change in the patient's condition \nrequiring skilled nursing services was not supported in the documentation.\" \n49.  A timely filed request for review by an ALJ resulted in a decision dated \nJune 16, 2010 that she was not entitled to coverage under Part A for those services.  In \nmaking that determination, the ALJ, like the lower level contractors before him, applied \nthe Improvement Standard.  He stated, inter alia, that \"[0] bservation and assessment of \n15 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 16 of 37\nthe Beneficiary was not necessary as the Beneficiary was stable....  The Beneficiary's \ncondition did not significantly changes [sic] during the period at issue and the plan of \ncare did not undergo changes.\" \n50.  Plaintiff limmo timely appealed the ALl decision in a request to the MAC \ndated August 8, 2010.  The decision of the MAC was due within 90 days of the MAC's \nreceipt ofthe request for review.  As of December 22,2010, the decision had not been \nreceived.  Accordingly, on that date plaintiff lirnrno sent a request by Federal Express \novernight mail to the MAC that the case be escalated to district court. \n51.  By decision dated December 28, 2010 and received by plaintiff limmo on \nDecember 30,2010, the MAC affirmed the decision of the ALl. It agreed with the ALl \n\"that the wound care was not complex, the beneficiary was stable and seen frequently in \nher physician's office for lesions and debridement, and neither her condition nor the plan \nof care changed significantly during the period at issue.\"  Accordingly, \"[t]he Council \nsees no basis for changing the ALl's decision. The Council therefore adopts the ALl's \ndecision.\" \nPlaintiff KR \n52.  During the periods at issue, plaintiff KR, a resident of Vermont, was a 48-\nyear-old severely disabled woman, suffering from congenital quadriplegia, patellofemoral \nsyndrome, epilepsy, depression, and impulse control disorder.  She has significant \ncognitive impairments, including mental retardation.  She has paralysis on her right side, \nand has cerebral palsy on her left side causing her left leg and hand to be weak.  She \n16 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 17 of 37\nrequires the use of either a wheelchair or walker and needs the assistance of one and \nsometimes two people to go out. \n53.  As a result ofKR's substantial physical and mental limitations, Kenneth \nRoberts was duly appointed as her co-guardian by the Bennington [Vermont] District \nProbate Court in 1998.  He has full authority to act on KR's behalf, including proceeding \nin this action as her representative. \n54.  During the months at issue, from September 26, 2008, to December 18, \n2008, her outings outside her home were for her medical appointments, when she was \naccompanied by her caregiver.  At other times her caregiver has taken KR grocery \nshopping once a week when she was not ill. \n55.  Her physician ordered skilled physical therapy for her starting on \nSeptember 26,2008.  Physical therapy was ordered to evaluate her functional ability, \nperform therapeutic exercise, teach transfer techniques and gait training, and develop a \nhome exercise program. \n56.  Her claim for Medicare coverage for these physical therapy services from \nSeptember 26, 2008 through December 18, 2008 was denied initially and at the \nredetermination level of review. \n57.  At the reconsideration level of review, the QIC affirmed the denial of \ncoverage, noting that the contractor at the redetermination level had determined that \"the \nservices failed to meet Medicare criteria for coverage because therapy services may be \ncovered when there is a reasonable expectation that the beneficiary will show measurable \n17 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 18 of 37\nimprovement in performing normal daily activities.\"  In agreeing with this assessment, \nthe QIC held that the \"submitted documentation did not support that the beneficiary had \nexperienced an acute episode or exacerbation of chronic condition resulting in a complex \nfunctional deficit to warrant skilled therapy intervention.\" \n58.  A timely filed request for review by an ALl resulted in a decision dated \nNovember 16,2010 that she was not entitled to coverage for those services. \n59.  In making that decision, the ALl relied on the Improvement Standard, like \nthe lower level contractors before him, noting that \"[t]he services must be provided with \nthe expectation that the condition of the patient will improve materially in a reasonable \nand generally predictable period oftime.\" Relying on that standard, the ALl held that \n\"one cannot determine whether there is a reasonable expectation of material improvement \n. . ..  [T]he submitted documentation does not support that [KR] had experienced an acute \nepisode or exacerbation of chronic condition resulting in a complex functional deficit to \nwarrant skilled intervention.\" \n60.  On behalf of plaintiff KR, a timely appeal ofthe ALl decision to the MAC \nwas made by fax transmission on December 22, 2010. \nPlaintiff Miriam Katz \n61.  Plaintiff Miriam Katz is the widow of David Katz, who died on December \n25,2010.  Mrs. Katz is named as the executor in her deceased husband's will. \n62.  David Katz, who was 90 years old and a resident .of Connecticut when he \ndied on December 25,2010, was hospitalized in November 2010 for metastatic rectal \n18 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 19 of 37\ncancer and a high grade intestinal obstruction. \n63.  He had been in a SNF since November 19,2010.  Medicare covered his \nstay there from November 19 through November 30,2010. \n64.  On November 26,2010, plaintiff Miriam Katz received a SNF Advance \nBeneficiary Notice and a generic notice, both dated November 22, 2010, notifying her \nthat Mr. Katz would no longer be covered, effective after November 30, 2010.  Upon her \nrequest for expedited review of that denial, she received an \"Agreement Notice of \nNoncoverage\" on December 2,2010.  Then, continuing the process of expedited review, \nshe requested and received an independent reconsideration decision from the QIC dated \nDecember 3,2010.  That decision affirmed the denial of coverage because the \"care you \nare currently receiving is considered custodial and could be performed by unskilled aides, \nwho are trained in maintenance care.\" \n65.  Plaintiff Katz has until February 1,2011 to request ALl review of the \nreconsideration decision. \nPlaintiff Edith Masterman \n66.  Plaintiff Edith Masterman is 79 years old and lives in Maine.  She has \nbeen a paraplegic since a farming accident as a teenager.  As a consequence she uses a \nwheelchair to get around, but has been able to remain at home with help from others.  She \nalso has been diagnosed with diabetes. \n67.  Over the last 10 years, she has developed a problem with pressure sores. \nAs a consequence, her wound care doctor ordered home health care for wound care.  She \nreceived this care, which was covered by Medicare, on a regular basis from \n19 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 20 of 37\nAndroscoggin Home Care & Hospice (AHCH) until she was hospitalized in September \n2009 for surgery to perform a skin graft to repair a pressure sore. \n68.  An infection occurred after the skin graft and she remained hospitalized \nuntil October 14,2009. Upon her release from the hospital, she was admitted to a skilled \nnursing facility from October 14,2009 to January 18,2010. When she finally returned \nhome in January 2010 her physician ordered home health care, but AHCH refused to \naccept her back as a patient on the grounds that it \"cannot accept Edith because her \nMedicare will not pay for a chronic problem\" and she needs long term care.  AHCH \ninformed Ms. Masterman that Medicare would not cover the wound care her doctor \nordered because Medicare does not pay for care when a wound is chronic and never \nexpected to heal. \n69.  Her doctors have been and are willing to order home health care. \n70.  Prior to her hospitalization, Medicare covered the services provided by an \nAHCH nurse who came to Ms. Masterman's home every other day.  After her \nhospitalization and because she could not obtain Medicare coverage of her home health \ncare, Ms. Masterman originally made weekly visits to the wound care clinic at the \nhospital.  She now visits the wound care clinic once every four weeks. \n71.  She receives some home care services from Elder Independence of Maine, \npaid for by Medicaid, which includes home health aides three times daily for about 1-112 \nto 2 hours per visit from Home Care of Maine and a once weekly skilled nursing visit \nfrom Care and Comfort. \n72.  AHCH is the only Medicare certified home health agency in her area. \nMedicare-covered home health care from AHCH would be more frequent than the care \n20 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 21 of 37\nshe now receives and would free her from the taxing effort and discomfort of having to \ngo to the wound care clinic. \n73.  Ms. Masterman only leaves her horne now for doctor or clinic \nappointments.  Horne health aides do her shopping.  She cannot get in and out of bed by \nherself, but is able to move around her house once she is in her wheelchair. \n74.  Because AHCH refuses to accept her as a patient due to its belief that the \nImprovement Standard would deny her coverage, Ms. Masterman is not able to have a \nclaim filed with Medicare or to obtain access to the administrative process. \nPlaintiff Mary Patricia Boitano \n75.  Plaintiff Mary Patricia Boitano is 83 years old and lives in Rhode Island. \nShe was hospitalized from October 22,2010 through October 29,2010 for a \ngastrointestinal hemorrhage, anemia, and renal failure, which required dialysis two days \nper week.  Prior to being hospitalized, she lived at horne with her husband. \n76.  On October 29, 2010 she was transferred to a skilled nursing facility, \nRoberts Health Centre.  Medicare covered her stay there from October 29,2010 to \nNovember 22,2010. \n77.  On November 19,2010, her husband, George Boitano, received a Notice \nof Non-Coverage from her Part C plan, United HealthCare, informing her that Medicare \ncoverage for her stay in the SNF would end on November 22,2010.  George Boitano \nappealed the decision to end Medicare coverage. \n78.  On November 22,2010, upon the request for fast-track appeal, the \ncoverage denial was affirmed.  The denial affirmation was based on the determination \nthat \"[t]herapy services must ... be reasonable in relation to the expected improvement in \n21 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 22 of 37\nyour condition.\" \n79.  On January 13,2011, Ms. Boitano requested that the QIO reconsider its \ndecision. \n80.  On or about November 22,2010, Ms. Boitano was transferred by her \nfamily to a new SNF, West View Health Care Center.  West View evaluated Ms. Boitano \nand determined that she required skilled nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy \nand speech therapy. \n81.  West View requested United HealthCare to restart Medicare coverage \nbased on Ms. Boitano's current skilled nursing and therapy needs.  United HealthCare \nrefused on the grounds that it had already determined that Ms. Boitano did not qualify for \nMedicare coverage. \n82.  At her own expense, Ms. Boitano remained at West View and received \nskilled nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy and/or speech therapy on a daily \nbasis from November 23,2010 through January 3, 2011. \n83.  Ms. Boitano was readmitted to the hospital on January 3, 2011 with \nanother gastrointestinal bleed. \nPlaintiff National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare \n84.  Plaintiff National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare \n(\"NCPSSM\" or \"the National Committee\") is a nonpartisan, nonprofit nationwide \nmembership organization representing millions of members and supporters nationwide. \n85.  The mission of the NCPSSM is to protect, preserve, promote, and ensure \nthe financial security, health, and ~ell-being of current and future generations of \nAmericans.  A central focus of that mission is the protection of Social Security and \n22 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 23 of 37\nMedicare.  Eliminating the Improvement Standard is an important aspect of that overall \ngoal. \n86.  The NCPSSM works through advocacy, education, services, grassroots \nefforts, and the leadership of the Board of Directors, its President and Chief Executive \nOfficer (presently, former Congresswoman Barbara B. Kennelly), and the organization's \nprofessional staff. \n87.  NCPSSM's work is supported through annual membership dues and \ncontributions, and through petitions and letters signed by his members and supporters.  At \npresent, it has approximately 3.2 million members and supporters throughout the country, \nof whom virtually all are Medicare beneficiaries.  Some of the NCPSSM's members who \nare Medicare beneficiaries have had or are having the Improvement Standard applied to \nthem. \n88.  Members of the National Committee would have standing to sue in their \nown right.  The interests that the National Committee seeks to protect in challenging the \nImprovement Standard are germane to its purpose.  Because this lawsuit seeks a legal \nruling in the form of declaratory, injunctive and/or mandamus relief, rather than \nindividualized relief for its members, the participation of individual members of the \nNational Committee is not required. \n89.  Via certified mail on Sept. 23,2010, counsel for plaintiff National \nCommittee sent letters on its behalf to Defendant Sebelius and to Donald Berwick, the \nCMS Administrator.  The identical letters informed the defendant and the Administrator \nthat their application of the Improvement Standard was in violation of the Medicare \nstatute and regulations, of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Freedom of \n23 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 24 of 37\nInfonnation Act, and of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The letters \nrequested that the defendant and the Administrator \"direct that the Improvement Standard \nno longer be employed to make coverage decisions and that appropriate steps be taken to \ncorrect its present and past application.\" \n90.  The letters were received by Defendant Sebelius and by Administrator \nBerwick on October 4,2010. Neither defendant Sebelius nor Administrator Berwick, nor \nanyone acting on their behalf, has responded to the letters. \nPlaintiff National Multiple Sclerosis Society \n91.  The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (MS Society) is a nationwide \norganization with a 50-state network of chapters that works to eradicate multiple sclerosis \nby stopping disease progression and preventing the disease in future generations, while \nrestoring function and providing and advocating for enhanced care and support for those \nalready affected by or living with this chronic disease, including ensuring their access to \nquality health care, long-tenn care resources, and accessible, affordable insurance. \n92.  The MS Society accomplishes this mission by supporting comprehensive \nand globally collaborative research into the underlying causes, understanding, potential \ntreatments, and ultimate prevention of multiple sclerosis, and by providing infonnation \nand resources, education, and support of all kinds to people with multiple sclerosis and \ntheir families.  This is accomplished in a variety of ways, including nationally-managed \nprograms and locally-managed state programs that provide services to families: \ninfonnation and referrals, support groups, care consultation, research, and through \neducating and advocating with all appropriate agencies at the federal, state, and local \nlevels. \n24 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 25 of 37\n• \n93.  In its effort to assist people with multiple sclerosis the MS Society works \nto ensure that services and benefits are available from federal programs that provide \nassistance to those with chronic illness and disability.  As part of the MS Society's \ncommitment to helping people affected by multiple sclerosis, the organization focuses on \nfour key programs: Medicare, Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (Part D of Medicare), \nSocial Security disability, and Department of Veterans Affairs benefits. \n94.  In its work on Medicare, the MS Society has focused in particular on the \nImprovement Standard as a critical factor in preventing people with multiple sclerosis \nfrom obtaining the Medicare coverage and health services that they need.  Consequently, \nthe MS Society assists people who have been denied or terminated from coverage \nbecause of application of the Improvement Standard.  It also has sought to convince CMS \nto end Medicare's reliance on the Improvement Standard. \n95.  The MS Society is the functional equivalent of a membership \norganization, as people with multiple sclerosis and their families are represented by the \nMS Society and are able to express their views and to protect their collective interests \nthrough it.  Its 48 chapters, which combined represent the entire United States, have \nmembers who vote, and members nationwide participate in identifying priority areas of \nneed as part of the organizational strategic planning process. \n96.  Many of the individuals who act through the MS Society are Medicare \nbeneficiaries, and a large number of them have been harmed by the Improvement \nStandard. \n97.  Individuals who act through the MS Society would have standing to sue in \n25 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 26 of 37\ntheir own right.  The interests that the MS Society seeks to protect in challenging the \nImprovement Standard are germane to its purpose.  Because this lawsuit seeks a legal \nruling in the form of declaratory, injunctive, and/or mandamus relief, rather than \nindividualized relief, the participation of individuals who act through the MS Society is \nnot required. \n98.  Via certified mail on December 20,2010, counsel for plaintiffMS Society \nsent letters on its behalf to Defendant Sebelius and to Donald Berwick, the CMS \nAdministrator.  The identical letters informed the defendant and the Administrator that \ntheir application of the Improvement Standard was in violation of the Medicare statute \nand regulations, of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Freedom of Information \nAct, and of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The letters requested that \nthe defendant and the Administrator \"direct that the Improvement Standard no longer be \nemployed to make coverage decisions and that appropriate steps be taken to correct its \npresent and past application.\" \n99.  The letters were received by Defendant Sebelius and by Administrator \nBerwick on December 28,2010. Neither defendant Sebelius nor Administrator Berwick, \nnor anyone acting on their behalf, has responded to the letters. \nPlaintiff Parkinson's Action Network \n100.  The Parkinson's Action Network (PAN) is a nationwide organization that \nworks to eliminate Parkinson's disease and to provide better treatment for, and improve \nthe quality of life of, people living with the disease. \n26 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 27 of 37\n101.  PAN accomplishes this mission by working in partnership with other \nParkinson's organizations and PAN's grassroots network of advocates in over 40 states. \nPAN educates the public, lawmakers, and appropriate federal agencies about the effects \nof Parkinson's and the need for better treatments and a cure. \n102.  PAN also advocates on behalf of those living with Parkinson's to ensure \nthat benefits from federal programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, are properly \nmade available to those who are eligible.  The Improvement Standard in Medicare, which \ndeprives Medicare beneficiaries, including those with Parkinson's, of coverage to which \nthey are entitled, is an issue that PAN focuses on to improve the quality of life for its \nconstituents. \n103.  PAN is the functional equivalent of a membership organization, as \nindividuals with Parkinson's and their families are represented by PAN and its grassroots \nnetwork, and are able to express their views and to protect their collective interests \nthrough it. \n104.  Many of the individuals who act through PAN are Medicare beneficiaries, \nand a large number of them have been harmed by the Improvement Standard. \n105.  Individuals who act through PAN would have standing to sue in their own \nright.  The interests that PAN seeks to protect in challenging the Improvement Standard \nare germane to its purpose.  Because this lawsuit seeks a legal ruling in the form of \ndeclaratory, injunctive, and/or mandamus relief, rather than individualized relief, the \nparticipation of individuals who act through PAN is not required. \n27 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 28 of 37\n106.  Via first-class mail on December 10,2010, via certified mail on December \n16,2010, and via United Parcel Service (UPS) on January 6, 2011, counsel for plaintiff \nPAN sent letters on its behalf to Defendant Sebelius and to Donald Berwick, the CMS \nAdministrator.  The identical letters informed the defendant and the Administrator that \ntheir application of the Improvement Standard was in violation of the Medicare statute \nand regulations, of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Freedom of Information \nAct, and of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The letters requested that \nthe defendant and the Administrator \"direct that the Improvement Standard no longer be \nemployed to make coverage decisions and that appropriate steps be taken to correct its \npresent and past application.\" \n107.  The United States Post Office has no record of the letters sent by certified \nmail on December 16,2010 being received.  The letters sent by UPS on January 6, 2011 \nwere received by Defendant Sebelius and by Administrator Berwick on January 7, 2011. \nNeither defendant Sebelius nor Administrator Berwick, nor anyone acting on their behalf, \nhas responded to the letters. \nPlaintiff Paralyzed Veterans of America \n108.  Plaintiff Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) is a nationwide, \ncongressionally chartered veterans service organization that has as its mission to use its \nexpertise, developed since its founding in 1946, on behalf of armed forces veterans who \nhave experienced spinal cord injury or dysfunction. \n109.  This expertise is employed to advocate for quality health care for its \n28 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 29 of 37\nmembers, for research and education addressing spinal cord injury and dysfunction, for \nbenefits based on its members' military service, and for civil rights, accessibility, and \nopportunities that maximize its members' independence. \n110.  PYA has almost 20,000 members, of whom over 6,200 are age 65 or over. \nAbout half of the PV A membership has identified Social Security benefits, either for old \nage or disability, as their main source of income.  About 10,500 members have non \nservice-connected chronic conditions, which allow them to enroll in the Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA) health care program only as low priority patients, forcing a \nmajority of these to elect Medicare coverage, either in addition to in or instead of VA \nhealth care. \n111.  Furthermore, PV A members who are service-connected and enrolled in \nthe V A health care program are free to enroll in Medicare as well and seek non-VA \nhealth care providers who accept Medicare assignment. \n112.  Although the exact number of PV A members who are eligible for and \nreceiving Medicare coverage is not known, the information in the preceding paragraph \nindicates that thousands of PV A members are eligible for and receiving Medicare.  Since \nvirtually all PYA members have chronic conditions, some, probably thousands, of those \nPV A members who are Medicare beneficiaries have had or are having the Improvement \nStandard applied to them. \n113.  Members of PV A would have standing to sue in their own right.  The \ninterests that PV A seeks to protect in challenging the Improvement Standard are germane \n29 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 30 of 37\nto its purpose.  Because this lawsuit seeks a legal ruling in the fonn of declaratory, \ninjunctive and/or mandamus relief, rather than individualized relief for its members, the \nparticipation of individual members of PV A is not required. \n114.  Via certified mail on December 20,2010, counsel for plaintiffPVA sent \nletters on its behalf to Defendant Sebelius and to Donald Berwick, the CMS \nAdministrator.  The identical letters infonned the defendant and the Administrator that \ntheir application of the Improvement Standard was in violation of the Medicare statute \nand regulations, of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Freedom of Infonnation \nAct, and of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The letters requested that \nthe defendant and the Administrator \"direct that the Improvement Standard no longer be \nemployed to make coverage decisions and that appropriate steps be taken to correct its \npresent and past application.\" \n115.  The letters were received by Defendant Sebelius and by Administrator \nBerwick on December 28,2010. Neither defendant Sebelius nor Administrator Berwick, \nnor anyone acting on their behalf, has responded to the letters. \nAmerican Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation \n116.  Plaintiff American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation \n(AAPM&R) is the premier medical society for the specialty of physical medicine and \nrehabilitation.  It has more than 7,500 members and represents greater than 75% of Board \ncertified physiatrists in the United States. \n117.  AAPM&R's core purpose is to advance its members' ability to serve \n30 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 31 of 37\npatients.  It seeks to advance the education, knowledge, skills, and research of its \nmembers in order to provide quality care and to represent the best interests of their \npatients who have or are at risk of having temporary or permanent disabilities. \n118.  AAPM&R carries out its vision by promoting excellence in physiatric \npractice and advocating on public policy issues related to persons with disabling \nconditions and pain. \n119.  Among the policy issues on which it advocates is the Improvement \nStandard.  It is the position of the AAPM&R that the Medicare statute and regulations \nrequire that Medicare provide coverage to its enrollees for the skilled medical services \nnecessary for their care and that the need for these services may exist independent of \nmedical improvement. \n120.  Members of AAPM&R would have standing to sue in their own right. \nThe interests that AAPM&R seeks to protect in challenging the Improvement Standard \nare germane to its purpose.  Because this lawsuit seeks a legal ruling in the form of \ndeclaratory, injunctive andlor mandamus relief, rather than individualized relief for its \nmembers, the participation of individual members of AAPM&R is not required. \n121.  Via first-class mail on December 14,2010, via certified mail on December \n16,2010, and via UPS on January 6, 2011, counsel for plaintiff AAPM&R sent letters on \nits behalf to Defendant Sebelius and to Donald Berwick, the eMS Administrator.  The \nidentical letters informed the defendant and the Administrator that their application of the \nImprovement Standard was in violation of the Medicare statute and regulations, of the \n31 \n\n• \nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 32 of 37\nAdministrative Procedure Act and the Freedom of Information Act, and of the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The letters requested that the defendant and the \nAdministrator \"direct that the Improvement Standard no longer be employed to make \ncoverage decisions and that appropriate steps be taken to correct its present and past \napplication.\" \n122.  The United States Post Office has no record of the letters sent by certified \nmail on December 16,2010 being received.  The letters sent by UPS on January 6, 2011 \nwere received by Defendant Sebelius and by Administrator Berwick on January 7, 2011. \nNeither defendant Sebelius nor Administrator Berwick, nor anyone acting on their behalf, \nhas responded to the letters. \nVII.  INADEQUACY OF REMEDY AT LAW AND PROPRIETY OF \nISSUANCE OF A WRIT OF MANDAMUS \n123.  Plaintiffs suffer irreparable injury by reason of defendants' actions \ncomplained of herein.  Not only are they deprived of Medicare coverage that is crucial to \ntheir health and well-being, but they also effectively lose the right to challenge that denial \nof coverage. \n124.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.  Only the declaratory, \ninjunctive, and mandamus relief that this Court can provide will fully redress the wrongs \ndone to plaintiffs. \n125.  Plaintiffs have a clear right to the relief sought.  There is no other adequate \nremedy available to correct an otherwise unreviewable defect not related to a claim for \nbenefits.  The defendant has a plainly defined and nondiscretionary duty to provide the \n32 \n\n.. \nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 33 of 37\nrelief that plaintiffs seek. \nVIII.  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF THE MEDICARE \nSTATUTE AND REGULATIONS \n126.  Application of the Improvement Standard to deny coverage violates the \nMedicare statute, and in particular its medical necessity requirement, 42 U.S.C. § \n1395y(a)(l)(A), its implementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. §§ 409.32(c), 409.44(b)(l), \n409.44(a), 409.44(b)(3)(iii), and 409.44(c)(2)(iii), and the Medicare Benefit Policy \nManual. \nIX.  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF THE PROCEDURAL \nREQUIREMENTS OF THE MEDICARE STATUTE \n127.  The Medicare statute prohibits the promulgation of a rule that \"establishes \nor changes a substantive legal standard governing the scope of benefits, the payment for \nservices, or the eligibility of individuals ... to ... receive services or benefits under this \nsubchapter ... unless it is promulgated by the Secretary\" through notice-and-comment \nrulemaking.  42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(a)(2).  As a rule applied to Medicare beneficiaries to \ndeny them coverage, the Improvement Standard violates this notice-and-comment \nrequirement of the Medicare statute, which renders the rule void and of no force and \neffect. \nX.  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF THE \nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n128.  The Administrative Procedure Act prohibits rulemaking without first \npublishing the rule in proposed form and allowing members of the public an opportunity \nto comment on the proposed rule.  5 U.S.C. § 553.  As a rule applied to Medicare \nbeneficiaries to deny them coverage, the Improvement Standard violates those notice-\nand-comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, which renders the rule \n33 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 34 of 37\nvoid and of no force and effect. \nXI.  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF THE \nFREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT \n129.  The Freedom of Information Act requires publication in the Federal \nRegister \"of substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law, and \nstatements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and \nadopted by the agency.\"  5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1)(D).  The Improvement Standard meets this \ncriterion, but it has not been published in the Federal Register.  Accordingly, it cannot be \napplied, and the rule is void and of no force and effect. \nXII.  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF THE DUE \nPROCESS CLAUSE \n130.  The application of an improper standard to deny coverage contrary to the \nMedicare Act and controlling regulations violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment. \nXIII.  SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF THE DUE \nPROCESS CLAUSE \n131.  The application of the Improvement Standard primarily at levels of review \nbelow the ALl level and with the pretense that it is a proper condition of coverage has the \neffect of discouraging or preventing beneficiaries from seeking review at which the \ncorrect standard would more likely be applied.  It therefore acts to deprive beneficiaries \nof their right to review in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \nXIV.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court: \n1.  Assume jurisdiction over this action. \n2.  Certify at an appropriate time that this suit is properly maintainable as a \n34 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 35 of 37\n• \nclass action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n3.  Declare that defendant's application ofthe Improvement Standard in \nMedicare coverage decisions violates the Medicare statute and regulations, the notice \nand-comment requirements of the Medicare statute and the Administrative Procedure \nAct, the publication requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, and the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment. \n4.  Grant a permanent injunction and/or an order of mandamus \na.  prohibiting defendant, her successors in office, her agents, \nemployees, and all persons acting in concert with her from applying the Improvement \nStandard to make Medicare coverage decisions; \nb.  ordering defendant, her successors in office, her agents, \nemployees, and all persons acting in concert with her to review all adverse coverage \ndecisions for the named plaintiffs and class members that rely on the Improvement \nStandard and to reissue those decisions without application of the Improvement Standard; \nc.  ordering defendant, her successors in office, her agents, \nemployees, and all persons acting in concert with her to revise any rules, provisions, \nguidelines, directives, or other written material under her control that supports and/or \napplies the Improvement Standard; \nd.  ordering defendant, her successors in office, her agents, \nemployees, and all persons acting in concert with her to direct all entities that render \nMedicare coverage decisions at any level (i) to correct any internal guidelines, directives, \nor other written material for employees that support and apply the Improvement Standard \nand (ii) to educate employees as to the correct approach to coverage decisions, without \n35 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 36 of 37\nregard to an Improvement Standard, as indicated by the Medicare Act and controlling \nregulations; and \ne.  ordering defendant, her successors in office, her agents, \nemployees, and all persons acting in concert with her to monitor all entities that render \nMedicare coverage decisions as to their progress in eliminating the Improvement \nStandard as a basis for coverage decisions. \nPlaintiffs pray in addition: \n5.  For costs of the suit herein. \n6.  For reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses pursuant to the Equal Access \nto Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412. \n7.  For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \nDATED: January 13,2011  Respectfully submitted, \nGill Deford \nJudith A. Stein \nMargaret Murphy \nWey-Wey Kwok \nNancy V.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 7 of 32\nEither Party shall have the right to initiate steps to resolve any alleged \nnoncompliance with any provision of the Settlement Agreement, subject to limitations \nand standards set forth in the Settlement Agreement. \n1.  If one party (the “Initiating Party”) has good reason to believe that an \nissue of noncompliance exists, it will first give timely written notice to the other party \n(the “Responding Party”), including: (a) a reference to all specific provisions of the \nSettlement Agreement that are involved; (b) a statement of the issue; (c) a statement of \nthe remedial action sought by the Initiating Party; and (d) a brief statement of the specific \nfacts, circumstances, and any other arguments supporting the position of the Initiating \nParty; and (e) if there is a good faith basis for expedited resolution, the circumstances that \nmake expedited resolution appropriate, and the proposed date for a reasonable expedited \nresponse.  To be timely, such notice must be provided promptly.  Notice that is not \nprovided promptly because of a lack of diligence on the part of the Initiating Party shall \nnot serve as a basis for the Court to exercise jurisdiction as described in Section VI.4 \nabove.     \n2.  Within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving such timely notice or \nwithin a reasonable time for an expedited resolution, the Responding Party shall respond \nin writing to the statement of facts and arguments set forth in the notice and shall provide \nits written position, including the facts and arguments upon which it relies in support of \nits position. \n3.  The Parties shall undertake good-faith negotiations, including meeting and \nconferring by telephone or in person and exchanging relevant documents and/or other \ninformation, to attempt to resolve the alleged noncompliance.  The written notice set \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 8 of 32\nforth in Section VIII.1 may be amended solely to include issue(s) related to the original \nnotice that may arise during the meet-and-confer process described in this paragraph. \n4.  If the Initiating Party believes in good faith that efforts to resolve the \nmatter have failed or if sixty (60) calendar days have elapsed from the Receiving Party’s \nreceipt of timely notice, the Initiating Party, after providing written notice to the \nResponding Party, may file a motion with the Court, with a supporting brief, requesting \nresolution of the alleged noncompliance, provided however that the relief sought by such \nmotion shall be limited to the issue(s) of alleged noncompliance described in the written \nnotice, as to which the Parties have met and conferred as described in Section VIII.3. \n5.  The Responding Party shall be provided with appropriate notice of any \nsuch motion and an opportunity to be heard on the motion, as provided under the Civil \nLocal Rules of the District of Vermont and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n6.  The Initiating Party cannot seek contempt sanctions as a remedy for \nalleged noncompliance with the Settlement Agreement.  If, however, the Initiating Party \nsuccessfully argues to the Court that there has been a breach of the Agreement and \nobtains an order from the Court compelling the Responding Party to remedy the breach, \nand if the Responding Party subsequently violates that order, then the Initiating Party is \nfree to seek contempt sanctions for that violation.   \nIX.  INJUNCTIVE PROVISIONS \nManual Revisions \n1.   The agency will revise the relevant portions of Chapters 7, 8, and 15 of \nthe Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (MBPM) to clarify the coverage standards for the \nskilled nursing facility (SNF), home health (HH), and outpatient therapy (OPT) benefits \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 9 of 32\nwhen a patient has no restoration or improvement potential but when that patient needs \nskilled SNF, HH, or OPT services (SNF, HH, OPT “maintenance coverage standard”).  \nThe agency will also revise the relevant portions of Chapter 1, Section 110 of the MBPM \nto clarify the coverage standards for services performed in an inpatient rehabilitation \nfacility (IRF). \n2.  The manual revisions to be made pursuant to this Settlement Agreement \nwill clarify the SNF, HH, and OPT maintenance coverage standards and IRF coverage \nstandard only as set forth below in Sections IX.6 through IX.8.  Existing Medicare \neligibility requirements for coverage remain in effect.  Nothing in this Settlement \nAgreement modifies, contracts, or expands the existing eligibility requirements for \nreceiving Medicare coverage, including such requirements found in: \na.  Posthospital SNF Care, as set forth in 42 C.F.R. Part 409, Subparts \nC and D, and related subregulatory guidance; \nb.  Home Health Services, as set forth in 42 C.F.R. Part 409, Subpart \nE, 42 C.F.R. Part 410, Subpart C, and related subregulatory guidance;  \nc.  Outpatient Therapy Services, as set forth in 42 C.F.R. Part 410, \nSubpart B, and related subregulatory guidance; and \nd.  Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility services, as set forth in 42 C.F.R. \nPart 412, Subpart P, and related subregulatory guidance. \n3.  CMS will revise or eliminate any manual provisions in Chapters 7, 8, and \n15 and Chapter 1, Section 110 of the MBPM that CMS determines are in conflict with the \nstandards set forth below in Sections IX.6 through IX.8.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 10 of 32\n4.  CMS will afford Plaintiffs’ Counsel 21 days to review and provide a \nsingle set of written comments on the manual provisions revised or eliminated as part of \nsettlement before the manual provisions are finalized and issued.  CMS will take any \nrecommendations from Plaintiffs’ Counsel under advisement and will make a good faith \neffort to utilize Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s reasonable recommendations that are limited to the \ncoverage standards as clarified in Sections IX.6 through IX.8 and that are consistent with \nthose coverage standards as well as all other statutory and regulatory requirements.  If \nplaintiffs request, CMS will also afford Plaintiffs’ Counsel a second opportunity for \nreview and comment on these manual revisions before the manual provisions are \nfinalized and issued; Plaintiffs’ Counsel will have 14 days to review any subsequent \nchanges made and either provide a second set of written comments or communicate its \ncomments at a meeting between counsel.  CMS will take any recommendations from \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel under advisement and will make a good faith effort to utilize \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel’s reasonable recommendations that are limited to the coverage \nstandards as clarified in Sections IX.6 through IX.8 and that are consistent with those \ncoverage standards as well as all other statutory and regulatory requirements.  CMS shall \nretain final authority as to the ultimate content of the manual provisions. \n5.  In providing any set of recommendations described in paragraph 4 above, \nPlaintiffs agree to collect all recommendations into one consolidated document to be \nprovided by Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel. \nMaintenance Coverage Standard for Therapy Services under the SNF, HH, and \nOPT Benefits  \n6.  Manual revisions will clarify that SNF, HH, and OPT coverage of therapy \nto perform a maintenance program does not turn on the presence or absence of a \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 11 of 32\nbeneficiary’s potential for improvement from the therapy, but rather on the beneficiary’s \nneed for skilled care.  \na.  The manual revisions will clarify that, under the SNF, HH, and \nOPT maintenance coverage standards, skilled therapy services are covered \nwhen an individualized assessment of the patient’s clinical condition \ndemonstrates that the specialized judgment, knowledge, and skills of a \nqualified therapist (“skilled care”) are necessary for the performance of a \nsafe and effective maintenance program.  Such a maintenance program to \nmaintain the patient’s current condition or to prevent or slow further \ndeterioration is covered so long as the beneficiary requires skilled care for \nthe safe and effective performance of the program.  When, however, the \nindividualized assessment does not demonstrate such a necessity for \nskilled care, including when the performance of a maintenance program \ndoes not require the skills of a therapist because it could safely and \neffectively be accomplished by the patient or with the assistance of non-\ntherapists, including unskilled caregivers, such maintenance services will \nnot be covered under the SNF, HH, or OPT benefits.   \nb.  The manual revisions will further clarify that, under the standard \nset forth in the previous paragraph (Section IX.6.a.), skilled care is \nnecessary for the performance of a safe and effective maintenance \nprogram only when (a) the particular patient’s special medical \ncomplications require the skills of a qualified therapist to perform a \ntherapy service that would otherwise be considered non-skilled; or (b) the \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 12 of 32\nneeded therapy procedures are of such complexity that the skills of a \nqualified therapist are required to perform the procedure.   \nc.  The manual revisions will further clarify that, to the extent \nprovided by regulation, the establishment or design of a maintenance \nprogram by a qualified therapist, the instruction of the beneficiary or \nappropriate caregiver by a qualified therapist regarding a maintenance \nprogram, and the necessary periodic reevaluations by a qualified therapist \nof the beneficiary and maintenance program are covered to the degree that \nthe specialized knowledge and judgment of a qualified therapist are \nrequired.  \nd.  The maintenance coverage standard for therapy as outlined in this \nsection does not apply to therapy services provided in an inpatient \nrehabilitation facility (IRF) or a comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation \nfacility (CORF).  \nMaintenance Coverage Standard for Nursing Services under the SNF and HH \nBenefits  \n7.  Manual revisions will clarify that SNF and HH coverage of nursing care \ndoes not turn on the presence or absence of an individual’s potential for improvement \nfrom the nursing care, but rather on the beneficiary’s need for skilled care.   \na.  The manual revisions will clarify that, under the SNF and HH \nbenefits, skilled nursing services are covered when an individualized \nassessment of the patient’s clinical condition demonstrates that the \nspecialized judgment, knowledge, and skills of a registered nurse or, when \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 13 of 32\nprovided by regulation, a licensed practical (vocational) nurse (“skilled \ncare”) are necessary.  Skilled nursing services would be covered where \nsuch skilled nursing services are necessary to maintain the patient’s \ncurrent condition or prevent or slow further deterioration so long as the \nbeneficiary requires skilled care for the services to be safely and \neffectively provided.  When, however, the individualized assessment does \nnot demonstrate such a necessity for skilled care, including when the \nservices needed do not require skilled nursing care because they could \nsafely and effectively be performed by the patient or unskilled caregivers, \nsuch services will not be covered under the SNF or HH benefits. \nb.  The manual revisions will further clarify that, under the standard \nset forth in the previous paragraph (Section IX.7.a.), skilled nursing care is \nnecessary only when (a) the particular patient’s special medical \ncomplications require the skills of a registered nurse or, when provided by \nregulation, a licensed practical nurse to perform a type of service that \nwould otherwise be considered non-skilled; or (b) the needed services are \nof such complexity that the skills of a registered nurse or, when provided \nby regulation, a licensed practical nurse are required to furnish the \nservices.  To be considered a skilled service, the service must be so \ninherently complex that it can be safely and effectively performed only by, \nor under the supervision of, professional or technical personnel as \nprovided by regulation, including 42 C.F.R. 409.32.   \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 14 of 32\nc.  The maintenance coverage standard for nursing services as \noutlined in this section does not apply to nursing services provided in an \ninpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) or a comprehensive outpatient \nrehabilitation facility (CORF).  \nIRF Coverage Standard \n8.  Manual revisions will clarify that an IRF claim could never be denied for \nthe following reasons: (1) because a patient could not be expected to achieve complete \nindependence in the domain of self-care or (2) because a patient could not be expected to \nreturn to his or her prior level of functioning.   \nEducational Campaign \n9.  CMS will engage in a nationwide educational campaign, as set forth in the \nfollowing Sections IX.10 through IX.14, which will use written materials and interactive \nforums with providers and contractors, to communicate the SNF, home health, and OPT \nmaintenance coverage standards and the IRF coverage standards as set forth in Sections \nIX.6 through IX.8. \n10.

CMS will provide updates to Plaintiffs’ Counsel regarding the \nresults of this random sampling during the bi-annual meetings referenced \nbelow in Section IX.17.f, beginning with the first meeting following \ncompletion of the educational campaign (which will be the second of the \nfive bi-annual meetings).  CMS’s obligation to conduct sampling of QIC \ndecisions as described above in Section IX.17.a pursuant to this Settlement \nAgreement terminates with the results reported at the fifth and final of the \nbi-annual meetings. \nc.  For any QIC decision from the random sample in which CMS \nfinds reason to believe an error was made in applying the correct SNF, \nHH, and OPT maintenance coverage standards as set forth in Sections \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 21 of 32\nIX.6 and IX.7, CMS will contact the QIC to determine whether an error \nwas made.  For those decisions in which an error by the QIC is confirmed, \nCMS will direct, or request if the agency does not have authority to direct, \nthe QIC to correct its error.   \nd.  If the random sampling indicates that a particular Medicare \ncontractor or MA organization is not applying the correct SNF, HH, and \nOPT maintenance coverage standards as set forth in Sections IX.6 and \nIX.7, CMS will address this issue directly with that entity.  The manner in \nwhich CMS addresses the issue will be within its discretion.   \ne.  Review of Individual Claims Determinations: To address any \nindividual beneficiary claims determinations that Plaintiffs believe were \nnot decided in accordance with the SNF, HH, and OPT maintenance \ncoverage standards as set forth above in Sections IX.6 and IX.7, CMS will \nagree to review and address individual claims determinations as follows: \n1.  During the bi-annual meetings referenced below in \nSection IX.17.f, Plaintiffs will present CMS (through \nPlaintiffs’ Lead Counsel) individual claims determinations \nit believes were not decided in accordance with the SNF, \nHH, and OPT maintenance coverage standards as set forth \nin Sections IX.6 and IX.7.  The total number of such \nindividual claims determinations Plaintiffs’ Counsel \npresents over the course of all bi-annual meetings is not to \nexceed 100.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 22 of 32\n2.  CMS will direct, or request if the agency does not have \nauthority to direct, the pertinent Medicare contractors or \nMA Organizations to review and evaluate these claims and \nrelated documentation.  If the review of such claims \nindicates that a particular Medicare contractor or MA \norganization is not applying the correct SNF, HH, and \nOPT maintenance coverage standard as set forth in \nSections IX.6 and IX.7, CMS will address this issue \ndirectly with that entity.  The manner in which CMS \naddresses the issue will be within its discretion.  Workload \npermitting, CMS will provide updates to Plaintiffs’ Lead \nCounsel regarding the action taken on these cases during \nthe subsequent bi-annual meeting referenced below in \nSection IX.17.f , provided that CMS receives proper \nauthorization from the beneficiary.    \nf.  Bi-Annual Meetings: CMS will meet with Plaintiffs’ Counsel on a bi-\nannual basis to discuss the results of the sampling of claims data and the \nagency’s review of the individual claims determinations as discussed \nabove in Sections IX.17.a-b and IX.17.e.  The meetings can also be used \nto bring any issues related to the settlement to the agency’s attention.  \nThe first of these meetings will take place following the issuance of the \nrevised manual provisions and prior to the completion of the educational \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 23 of 32\ncampaign, and meetings will continue on a bi-annual basis thereafter for a \ntotal of five (5) meetings.   \n18.  The Parties recognize that Defendant's obligations are met under the \nSettlement Agreement once it has complied with the terms of this Settlement Agreement, \nand that Defendant is not guaranteeing to Plaintiffs that certain results will be achieved \nonce the steps set forth in this Settlement Agreement have been implemented. \nX.  ATTORNEY’S FEES \nDefendant agrees to pay reasonable and appropriate attorney’s fees, costs, and \nexpenses related to work performed by Plaintiffs’ Counsel in the litigation and settlement \nof this matter up until the Approval Date, subject to appropriate documentation and \nexercise of business judgment by Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel, pursuant to the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act.  For work performed by Plaintiffs’ Counsel after the Approval \nDate, Defendant agrees to pay reasonable and appropriate attorney’s fees, costs, and \nexpenses only for the post-Approval Date work specified in this Settlement Agreement, \nto be capped at $300,000, subject to appropriate documentation and exercise of business \njudgment by Plaintiffs and their attorneys and pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice \nAct.  However, if Plaintiffs initiate proceedings to enforce this Settlement Agreement, as \ndescribed above, and if the Court finds that Defendant has not complied with the \nSettlement Agreement, Plaintiffs reserve the right to seek the payment of additional fees, \ncosts, and expenses in connection with that enforcement proceeding that will not be \nsubject to the above cap.  Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel may submit request(s) for post-\nApproval fees to Defendant’s Counsel for periods no less than 12 months in length, \nexcept for the last period if one or more earlier periods has been for more than 12 months.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 24 of 32\nIn the event that the parties are unable to agree upon the amount of fees, Plaintiffs may \nretain the right to file a fee petition with the Court.  Notwithstanding their agreement to \nlimit any post-Approval attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses to the above fee cap, \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel object to the principle of a fee cap and reserve their \nright to object to such a cap in future cases.  \nXI.  CLASS CERTIFICATION AND RELIEF \nClass Definition \n1.  Defendant will stipulate to the certification of a class pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) consisting of all Medicare beneficiaries who: \na.  received skilled nursing or therapy services in a skilled nursing \nfacility, home health setting, or outpatient setting; and  \nb.  received a denial of Medicare coverage (in part or in full) for those \nservices described in the previous paragraph based on a lack of \nimprovement potential in violation of the SNF, HH, or OPT maintenance \ncoverage standards as defined above in section Sections IX.6 and IX.7 and \nthat denial became final and non-appealable on or after January 18, 2011; \nand     \nc.  seek Medicare coverage on his or her own behalf; the definition of \nclass members specifically excludes providers or suppliers of Medicare \nservices or a Medicaid State Agency.   \nRe-Review Relief for Certain Members of the Class \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 25 of 32\n2.  Certain members of the class are eligible for re-review of the claim denials \ndescribed above in Section XI.1.b, if the following requirements are met:  \na.  The services described above in Section XI.1.a that are the subject \nof the denial described above in Section XI.1.b must not have been \ncovered or paid for by any third-party payer or insurer or Medicare, except \nin the case of an individual Medicare beneficiary whose services were \npaid for by Medicaid and who paid for the service or is personally or \nfinancially liable or subject to recovery for the services; and  \nb.  There must not have been a basis for the denial of the claim for \nMedicare coverage that was separate and independent from the alleged \nfailure to apply the SNF, HH, or OPT maintenance coverage standards as \ndefined above in Sections IX.6 and IX.7.  A separate and independent \nbasis for denial would include the failure to satisfy any procedural \nrequirement, any Medicare eligibility requirement, or any threshold \nrequirement for coverage, but a conclusory determination that services \nwere not “reasonable and necessary,” were not “medically necessary,” or \nthat coverage is denied using other conclusory, non-specific language, that \nmay be based on a failure to apply the SNF, HH, or OPT maintenance \ncoverage standards as defined in Sections IX.6 and IX.7 above would not \nbe such a separate and independent basis for denial.  \n3.  Claim denials described in Section XI.1.b that become final and non-\nappealable after the End of the Educational Campaign are not eligible for re-review under \nthis Section (XI). \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 26 of 32\n4.  Claims of class members other than of the Named Plaintiffs that are \ncurrently the subject of any lawsuit pending in an Article III United States Court or have \nbeen the subject of a final, non-appealable judgment by such courts are not eligible for re-\nreview under this Section (XI). \n5.  Only class members on their own behalf may receive re-review of claims \nunder this section. No provider or supplier of Medicare services or Medicaid State \nAgency is permitted to receive re-review under this section on behalf of or by assignment \nfrom a class member. \n6.  Class members who are eligible for re-review of claim denials will be \npartitioned into two groups.   \na.  Group 1 consists of all class members who received a final, non-\nappealable denial of Medicare coverage (in part or in full) where that \ndenial became final and non-appealable after January 18, 2011 and up to \nand including the Approval Date. \nb.  Group 2 consists of all class members who received a final, non-\nappealable denial of Medicare coverage (in part or in full) from the day \nafter the Approval Date through and including the End of the Educational \nCampaign.   \n7.  Group 1 class members seeking re-review relief as set forth  in this \nSection (XI) will be required to identify themselves and their final, non-appealable \ndenials to CMS no later than six (6) months after the End of the Educational Campaign.  \nGroup 2 class members seeking re-review relief as set forth in this Section (XI) will be \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 27 of 32\nrequired to identify themselves and their final, non-appealable denials to CMS no later \nthan twelve (12) months after the End of the Educational Campaign. \n8.  For each Group 1 or 2 class member who identifies himself or herself to \nCMS within the specified timeframe for re-review as set forth in the previous paragraph, \nthe agency will direct, or request if the agency does not have the authority to direct, the \ncontractor or adjudicator who last denied the class member’s claim for Medicare \ncoverage to re-review the claim under the clarified maintenance coverage standards set \nforth above in Sections IX.6 and IX.7, subject to the exceptions described above in \nSections XI.4 and XI.5.  \n9.  When results of the re-review process confirm that the claim was denied in \nerror and that the care should have been covered by Medicare, the agency will reimburse \nfor that care, or, if the agency does not have the authority to reimburse, request \nreimbursement for the class member for that care, subject to applicable Medicare \nreimbursement limits.   \n10.  Within 10 days of Approval of this Settlement Agreement, Defendant will \ninform Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel of the process, including to whom class members should \nidentify themselves (pursuant to Section XI.7 through XI.8), by which class members \nshould identify themselves in order to obtain re-review. \n11.  Within 30 days after the End of the Educational Campaign, Plaintiffs’ \nLead Counsel shall provide Defendant with the final claim denial that Ms. Jimmo \nreceived that is at issue in this lawsuit.  Defendant shall promptly process Ms. Jimmo’s \nclaim under the re-review process as set forth in Section XI.2 through XI.10.  Defendant \n27 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 28 of 32\nshall make a good faith effort to issue a final decision on Ms. Jimmo’s claim, if \nappropriate, as soon as practicable. \nXII.  COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL AUTHORITY \nThe parties recognize that Defendant is required to comply with applicable \nstatutes and regulations, including any future revisions to the statutes and regulations that \ngovern Medicare coverage, and that nothing in this Settlement Agreement shall prohibit \nDefendant from modifying its policies and procedures to comply with any relevant \nstatutory or regulatory changes, even if such modifications are made during the period of \nthe Court’s continuing jurisdiction under this Settlement Agreement, or from otherwise \nchanging Defendant’s regulations in a manner consistent with the Administrative \nProcedure Act.  If Plaintiffs’ Counsel believes that any such modifications to Defendant’s \npolicies and procedures, such as the Medicare Benefits Policy Manual, are not authorized \nby any statutory or regulatory changes, and that any such modifications would constitute \na breach of any of the provisions of this Settlement Agreement, they reserve the right to \ninitiate the Dispute Resolution process in Section VIII. \nXIII.  RELEASE \n1.  In consideration for the promises of Defendant as set forth in this \nSettlement Agreement, the Named Plaintiffs and all Class Members, and their heirs, \nadministrators, successors, or assigns (together, the “Releasors”), hereby release and \nforever discharge Defendant and the United States Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS), along with Defendant's and HHS's  administrators, successors, officers, \nemployees, and agents (together, the “Releasees”) from any and all claims and causes of \naction that have been asserted or could have been asserted in this action by reason of, or \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 29 of 32\nwith respect to, Plaintiffs'  allegations that Defendant has illegally applied, or has failed \nto properly prevent the application of, an Improvement Standard under which Medicare \ncoverage of skilled services is denied on the basis that a Medicare beneficiary is not \nimproving, without regard to an individualized assessment of the beneficiary’s medical \ncondition and the reasonableness and necessity of the treatment, care or services in \nquestion.   \n2.  The above release shall not affect the right of any Class Member to seek \nany and all individual relief that is otherwise available in satisfaction of an individual \nclaim against Defendant for Medicare benefits that is not based upon the allegations set \nforth in Section XIII.1 above. \n3.  The above release also shall not affect Plaintiffs' or any Class Member's \nright, if any, to bring a separate lawsuit challenging any new policy or procedure that is \nadopted by Defendant after the end of the Court's  jurisdiction over this Settlement \nAgreement, as described in Section VI.  Plaintiffs and Class Members will have no right \nto claim that such a change in policies or procedures violates the Settlement Agreement, \nbut do not waive any right to claim that the new policy or procedure violates the Social \nSecurity Act, Defendant's regulations, or any other provision of law. \n \nXIV.  NO ADMISSION OF LIABILITY \nNeither this Settlement Agreement nor any order approving this Settlement \nAgreement is or shall be construed as an admission by Defendant of the truth of any of \nthe allegations set forth in the First Amended Complaint or the validity of the claims \n29 \n \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 82-1   Filed 10/16/12   Page 30 of 32\nasserted in the First Amended Complaint, or of Defendant's liability for any of those \nclaims. \n \n \n  The undersigned representatives of the parties certify that they are fully \nauthorized to consent to the Court’s entry of the terms and conditions of this Settlement \nAgreement. \n \nDated:    October 16, 2012 \n \n   /s/ Judith Stein (by permission)           \nJUDITH STEIN  \nExecutive Director \nCenter for Medicare Advocacy, Inc. \nP.O.

INTRODUCTION \nIn this case plaintiffs challenge an illegal condition of coverage employed by the \ndefendant Secretary of Health & Human Services (the Secretary) in her administration of \nthe Medicare program, which provides health insurance for 47 million Americans.  As a \ncovert rule of thumb that also deprives most affected beneficiaries of the right to review, \nthe Improvement Standard causes termination, reduction, or denial of coverage for \nthousands of Medicare beneficiaries annually, of whom many have chronic diseases and \ncan least afford the loss of care and services.  This largely clandestine policy, which has \nbeen implemented without notice-and-comment rulemaking, has no support in the \nMedicare statute, is directly contradicted by the implementing regulations, and has been \nrepeatedly repudiated by court decisions, none of which the government has appealed. \nDifferent terms are employed in applying the Improvement Standard.  These \ninclude that the beneficiary needs \"maintenance services only,\" has \"plateaued,\" or is \n\"chronic,\" \"stable,\" or \"not improving.\"  All have the same meaning and impact, \nhowever: that the beneficiary is not getting better as a consequence of the care or services \nat issue and therefore is not entitled to coverage for skilled care.  Although federal \nregulations preclude application of such a standard, employees ofthe decision-making \nentities, especially at the lower levels of the Medicare administrative review process, \nheed carefully to the phraseology that effects the Improvement Standard.  Furthermore, \nbecause the Standard is recited as Medicare policy and its application appears to be \n\"correct,\" most beneficiaries do not even attempt to seek review at a higher level. \nThe named plaintiffs are Medicare beneficiaries who have had coverage \nterminated or denied due to application of the Improvement Standard and \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 3 of 25\norganizations that assist their members and others who are subject to the Standard.  They \nseek declaratory and injunctive relief to correct this policy, contending that it is \nprohibited by the Medicare statute, the Administrative Procedure Act (AP A), the \nFreedom of Information Act, and the Due Process Clause.  Because it is applicable to \nbeneficiaries around the country, they seek to represent a nationwide class of Medicare \nbeneficiaries who have suffered or will suffer from the application of the Improvement \nStandard.  Specifically, they request certification of a class defined as: \nAll beneficiaries of Medicare Parts A, B, or C who have had or will have \ncoverage for health care or therapy services, as an outpatient, in a hospital, in a \nskilled nursing facility, or in a home health care setting, denied, terminated, or \nreduced due to the application of the Improvement Standard, on or after January \n1,2006. \nI.  LEGAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF THE CASE \nA.  Medicare and its coverage rules. \nMedicare, which is codified as Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, is the \nfederally funded and administered program of health insurance for those who are 65 and \nover or are disabled.  Under Part A of Medicare, for which eligibility is automatic for \nrecipients of Social Security old age and disability benefits (Title II of the Social Security \nAct), beneficiaries are entitled to coverage for hospital, extended care (nursing homes), \nhome health, and hospice services.  42 U.S.C. § 1395d(a).  Part B of Medicare \nestablishes a voluntary program of supplemental medical insurance providing outpatient \ncoverage of physicians, nurse practitioners, home health, physical, speech and \noccupational therapy, diagnostic services, and durable medical equipment.  ld., § \n1395k(a).  Under Part C (the Medicare Advantage program), beneficiaries may opt to \nenroll in a managed care plan in lieu of the traditional fee-for-service approach provided \n2 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 4 of 25\ninPartsAandB. Jd., § 1395w-21(a).! \nThe threshold for Medicare coverage is codified in its medical necessity \nrequirement, which states that \nno payment may be made ... for any expenses incurred for items or \nservices which ... are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or \ntreatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed \nbody member. \n42 U.S.C. § 1395y(a)(1)(A).  In other words, full coverage must flow when the service is \nreasonable and necessary.  Hays v. Sebelius, 589 F.3d 1279, 1283 (D.C. Cir. 2009). \nExcept for the discrete and limited reference in subsection 1395y(a)(1)(A) to \n\"improv[ing] the functioning of a malformed body member,\" the Medicare statute \nnowhere establishes or refers to improvement as a condition of coverage.  Indeed, the \nregulations state just the opposite.  Thus, for coverage of skilled nursing care, \n[t]he restoration potential of a patient is not the deciding factor in \ndetermining whether skilled services are needed.  Even if full recovery or \nmedical improvement is not possible, a patient may need skilled services \nto prevent further deterioration or preserve current capabilities. \n42 C.F.R. § 409.32(c); see also id., § 409.44(b)(1) (incorporating that standard for home \nhealth care coverage).  The home health care regulations emphasize that the \"reasonable \nand necessary\" determination depends on \"the unique medical condition of the individual \nbeneficiary,\" id., § 409.44(a), and expressly preclude consideration of \"whether the \nillness or injury is acute, chronic, terminal, or expected to last a long time.\"  Jd., § \n409.44(b)(3)(iii).  And, with respect to physical, speech, and occupational therapy in the \nhome health context, the regulations are framed in the alternative, with improvement \n!  The fourth part of Medicare, Part D, provides for coverage of prescription drugs \nthrough private insurance plans.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-101 et seq.  The Improvement \nStandard is not implicated in Part D. \n3 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 5 of 25\nbeing only one of three possible grounds for coverage.  !d., § 409.44(c)(2)(iii). \nFurthermore, the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (MBPM) emphasizes the need for \nassessing the totality of the individual's need for care, expressly precluding reliance on \n\"rules of thumb.\"  10M 100-02, MBPM, ch. 7, §§ 20.3,40.2,40.1.1.  Just two months \nago, CMS reiterated and emphasized this point: \n\"Rules of thumb\" in the Medicare medical review process are prohibited \n....  Any \"rules of thumb\" that would declare a claim not covered solely \non the basis of such elements, such as, lack of restoration potential ... or \ndegree of stability, is [sic] unacceptable without individual review of all \npertinent facts to determine if coverage may be justified. \n75 F.R. 70372, 70395 (Nov. 17,2010). \nB.  The administrative review process and application of the \nImprovement Standard. \nMedicare administrative review is a multi-step process.  For Parts A and B, it \nincludes an opinion from the provider that Medicare will not or will no longer authorize \ncoverage of the care or services at issue, an \"initial determination\" from the Medicare \nadministrative contractor, a redetermination either by the contractor or, if expedited \nreview has been requested, by a separate entity called the Quality Improvement \nOrganization (QIO), reconsideration by the Qualified Independent Contractor (QIC), de \nnovo review by an administrative law judge (ALJ), and on-the-record review by the \nMedicare Appeals Council (MAC).  The process is largely the same for Part C claims, \nbut with slightly different terminology and with the reconsideration determination made \nby an external organization known as the Independent Review Entity (IRE). \nAs a general rule (though with important exceptions), failure to timely seek \nreview at the next step in the sequence terminates the beneficiary's right to seek further \nadministrative or judicial review.  This is so despite the fact that, under Parts A and B, \n4 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 6 of 25\nbeneficiaries may only proceed through the administrative process after they have \nreceived the care or services at issue and obligated themselves to pay for it.  That is, a \nPart A or B beneficiary cannot obtain an advisory coverage decision.  See, e.g., Heckler \nv. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 621 (1984). \nDespite the regulatory prohibition against a policy like the Improvement \nStandard, lower level decision-makers - that is, employees of providers, contractors, \nMedicare Advantage plans, QICs, QIOs, and IREs -largely ignore the regulations. \nFollowing in-house directives and Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs), which are \ncreated by individual contractors to provide guidance in the jurisdictions in which they \noperate, they consistently deny coverage on the ground that the beneficiary has \n\"plateaued\" or is not improving.  Provider reliance on the Improvement Standard can \nresult in a beneficiary being unable to obtain the initial determination that provides the \nentree into the administrative process. \nEven when beneficiaries do formally seek coverage, only a tiny percentage of \nthose who are denied initially seek further review, see infra at 15, despite the greater \nlikelihood of success at either the ALJ level, where LCDs are not binding, 42 C.F.R. § \n405.1062(a), or upon judicial review.2  The overall rate of review by ALJs of Part A and \nB reconsiderations is under 38%.3  Given that cases involving the Improvement Standard \nThe courts have regularly rejected application of the Improvement Standard.  See, \n2 \ne.g., Anderson v. Sebelius, 2010 WL 4273238 (D.Vt. 2010); Papciakv. Sebelius, --- F. \nSupp. 2d ---, 2010 WL 3885605 (W.D.Pa. 2010); Smith v. Shalala, 855 F.Supp. 658 \n(D.Vt. 1994); Rizzi v. Shalala, 1994 WL 686630 (D.Conn. 1994) (challenge to \nImprovement Standard claim rejected because Secretary's change to manual rendered \nclaim moot); Folland v. Sullivan, 1992 WL 295230 (D.Vt. 1992); Fox v. Bowen, 656 \nF.Supp. 1236 (D.Conn. 1987). \n3 In FY 2008, the number of Medicare claims taken to ALJs under all four Parts of \nMedicare was 185,665 in 36,585 appeals.  Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals \n5 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 7 of 25\nappear to involve the simple application of a rule to undisputed facts (rather than a \ndispute about the facts or application of the rule to those facts), it stands to reason that an \neven smaller percentage of those who are denied coverage because of the Improvement \nStandard seek ALJ review. \nThe bottom line is that the Improvement Standard has a twofold impact on \nbeneficiaries.  First, it denies them coverage to which they are entitled.  Second, it \ndiscourages review to such an extent that beneficiaries are effectively deprived of the \nability to obtain review.  This case seeks to correct that situation. \nC.  The named plaintiffs' situations \nThe individual plaintiffs \nThe five individual plaintiffs have all been denied coverage because of \napplication ofthe Improvement Standard.  Glenda Jimmo, who is a resident of Bristol, \nVermont and was 71 at the time of the coverage denial, suffers from serious medical \nproblems, including diabetes and angina.  As a consequence of these conditions, her \nphysician prescribed intermittent skilled nursing and home health aide nursing services, \nbut the defendant Secretary's Medicare contractor denied coverage for the home health \nservices received from January 14,2007 to January 8, 2008, noting that \"[h]er condition \nwas stable with no acute changes.\"  At the next level, the QIC affirmed on the basis of \nwebsite, at http://www.hhs.gov/omha/resources/index.html.  The total claims figure for \nALJ appeals (185,665) represents 38% of the Part A and B reconsideration decisions \nmade in 2008 (482,989).  See CMS, \"Fact Sheet: Original Medicare (Fee-For-Service) \nAppeals Data - 2008,\" at \nhttp://www.cms.gov/OrgMedFFSAppeals/Downloads/Feeshet2008.pdf.  Since the claims \nfigure includes an unknown number of Parts C and D claims as well, the percentage of \nParts A and B claims that are taken to the ALJ level is something less than 38%, probably \nconsiderably less. \n6 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 8 of 25\nsimilar reasoning: \"The likelihood of a change in the patient's condition requiring skilled \nnursing services was not supported in the documentation.\"  The ALl also applied the \nImprovement Standard: \"Observation and assessment of the Beneficiary was not \nnecessary as the Beneficiary was stable ....  The Beneficiary's condition did not \nsignificantly changes [sic] during the period at issue and the plan of care did not undergo \nchanges.\"  The MAC affirmed the ALl and expressly adopted his conclusions. \nComplaint, ~~ 45 - 51. \nPlaintiff KR, who lives in Bennington, Vermont, was, at the relevant time, 48 \nyears old.  She is severely disabled, suffering from congenital quadriplegia, \npatellofemoral syndrome, and epilepsy; she also has significant cognitive impairments, \nincluding mental retardation.  She needs either a wheelchair or a walker to get around, \nand requires assistance from others when she goes outside.  Accordingly, her physician \nordered skilled physical therapy beginning September 26, 2008, but her claim for \ncoverage of this therapy was denied at both the initial and redetermination levels of \nreview.  On reconsideration, the QIC affirmed on the basis of the Improvement Standard, \nholding that the \"submitted documentation did not support that the beneficiary had \nexperienced an acute episode or exacerbation of chronic condition resulting in a complex \nfunctional deficit to warrant skilled therapy intervention.\"  Her appeal to an ALl fared no \nbetter, as the ALl, in his decision of November 16,2010, parroted the classic \nImprovement Standard language as the basis for his holding: \"The services must be \nprovided with the expectation that the condition of the patient will improve materially in \na reasonable and generally predictable period of time.\" As a consequence of that \napplication, he denied coverage because \"[t]he submitted documentation does not support \n7 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 9 of 25\nthat [KR] had experienced an acute episode or exacerbation of chronic condition resulting \nin a complex functional deficit to warrant skilled intervention.\"  KR appealed that \ndecision to the MAC on December 22,2010.  Complaint,,-r,-r 52-60. \nAfter hospitalization for a high grade intestinal obstruction and metastatic cancer, \nDavid Katz, who was 90 years old and a resident of Bloomfield, Connecticut when he \ndied, went to a skilled nursing facility.  Although the first part of his stay there was \ncovered, his wife Miriam Katz, who was named as the executor in his will, was notified \non November 26,2010 that coverage for his SNF stay would end effective November 30. \nExpedited review resulted in denials from the QIO and then from the QIC on December \n3, on the ground that the \"care you are currently receiving is considered custodial and \ncould be performed by unskilled aides, who are trained in maintenance care.\"  Complaint, \n,-r,-r 61-65. \nEdith Masterman is 79 years old and lives in Wilton, Maine.  She has been a \nparaplegic since she was injured in a farming accident over sixty years ago.  She was \nreceiving home health care, on her doctor's orders, because of pressure sores. After she \nreturned home from a hospital and then a SNF because of the need for a skin graft to \nrepair a sore, however, her home health care agency, which is the only Medicare-certified \nagency in the area, refused to provide further care, contending that \"Medicare will not \npay for a chronic problem.\"  She now receives limited home health services through the \nMedicaid program.  She also has to visit the wound care clinic on a weekly basis, which \nwould not be necessary if she had the more comprehensive care that she previously \nreceived.  Because her former home health agency has determined that she would not be \ncovered for Medicare, she cannot gain access to the administrative review process and \n8 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 10 of 25\nchallenge the very policy that the agency is applying to her.  Complaint, ~~ 66 - 74. \nMary Patricia Boitano, who lives in Narragansett, Rhode Island, is 83 years old. \nShe is enrolled in United HealthCare's Part C Medicare Advantage program.  After being \nhospitalized this past fall, she was transferred to a SNF, for which her care was originally \ncovered by Medicare.  United HealthCare denied Coverage after November 22,2010, \nhowever, and her fast-track appeal decision affirmed that denial because \"[t]herapy \nservices must ... be reasonable in relation to the expected improvement in your \ncondition.\"  A different skilled nursing facility to which she moved determined that she \nneeded skilled care and therapy, but United HealthCare continued to contend that she was \nnot entitled to Medicare coverage.  At her own expense, however, she stayed at that SNF, \nreceiving skilled care and therapy, until January 3, 2011, when she again had to be \nhospitalized.  Complaint, ~~ 75 - 83. \nThe organization plaintiffs4 \nThe five national organizations that are co-plaintiffs with the individual \nbeneficiaries represent a cross-section of organizations that seek to assist Americans who \nhave chronic illnesses and disabilities in obtaining coverage for their necessary treatment \nand care.  They include an organization that represents Medicare beneficiaries, three \norganizations that advocate on behalf of individuals with specific chronic conditions, and \nthe organization that represents the nation's physiatrists, who specialize in physical \nmedicine and rehabilitation.  All are devoted to the ending of the Improvement Standard \n4  An organization may act as a class representative when its underlying purpose is to \nrepresent the interests of the class.  See, e.g., Communities for Equity v. Michigan High \nSchool Athletic Ass'n, 192 F.R.D. 568, 573 (W.D.Mich. 1999); Nat 'I Org.for Women, \nInc. v. Scheidler, 172 F.R.D. 351,362 (N.D.Ill. 1997); Upper Valley Ass 'nfor \nHandicapped Citizens v. Mills, 168 F.R.D. 167, 171 (D.Vt. 1996); Mass. Ass 'n ofO  lder \nAmericans v.

As its full name indicates, the National Committee is \nfocused in large part on protecting the Medicare program and making it work for its \nmembers and other beneficiaries.  Complaint, ~~ 84 - 90. \nThe National Multiple Sclerosis Society (MS Society) has a 50-state network of \nchapters that work with the national office to provide care and support for those suffering \nfrom multiple sclerosis.  The Medicare program is one of the MS Society's four key \npoints of focus, and many of the people whom it serves are Medicare beneficiaries. \nComplaint, ~~ 91- 99. \nThe Parkinson's Action Network (PAN) works with other Parkinson's \norganizations and its grassroots network of advocates throughout the country to improve \nthe lives of those with Parkinson's disease.  One crucial aspect of PAN's effort is to \nensure that those with the disease receive the benefits to which they are entitled, \nincluding Medicare.  Complaint, ~~ 100 - 107. \nThe Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) is a nationwide, congressionally \nchartered organization that assists veterans who have spinal chord injury or dysfunction. \nObtaining quality health care is a critical component of this effort.  With thousands of its \n20,000 members receiving Medicare, PVA   is devoted to insuring that they obtain the \ncoverage to which they are entitled.

Complaint, \n,-r,-r 116 -122. \nIII.  SINCE THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS SATISFY THE \nREQUIREMENTS OF RULE 23(a) AND RULE 23(b)(2), THE \nCLASS SHOULD BE CERTIFIED. \nA.  Introduction \nClass actions are a significant and effective tool in the litigation process, for both \ncourts and litigants, as they advance \"the efficiency and economy of litigation which is a \nprincipal purpose of the procedure.\"  General Telephone Co. ofS outhwest v. Falcon, 457 \nu.S. 147, 159 (1982); see also, e.g., Us. Parole Commission v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, \n402-403 (1980).  Furthermore, in cases seeking to correct the improper administration of \ngovernment benefit programs, they are particularly useful in securing effective relief to \neveryone harmed by the challenged practice.  See, e.g., Matyasovszky v. Housing \nAuthority ofC  ity ofB  ridgeport, 226 F.R.D. 35,40 (D.Conn. 2005) (quoting Newberg on \nClass Actions for propriety of class certification in cases brought by recipients of \ngovernment benefits). \nIn another Social Security Act case, the Supreme Court stated over thirty years \nago that \nclass relief for claims such as those presented ... in this case is peculiarly \nappropriate.  The issues involved are common to the class as a whole.  They tum \non questions of law applicable in the same manner to each member of the class .... \nIt is unlikely that differences in the factual background of each claim will affect \n11 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 13 of 25\nthe outcome of the legal issue.  And the class-action device saves the resources of \nboth the courts and the parties by permitting an issue potentially affecting every \nsocial security beneficiary to be litigated in an economical fashion under Rule 23. \nCalifano v.  Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 701 (1979).  Writing for the Court, Chief Justice \nRehnquist repeated and approved the Yamasaki language:  \"[A]s the litigation history of \nthis case demonstrates, 'the class-action device save[ d] the resources of both the courts \nand the parties by permitting an issue potentially affecting every [class member] to be \nlitigated in an economical fashion. '\"  Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 268 n.17 (2003). \nAccordingly, judges have not hesitated to employ the class certification device in \nMedicare cases that seek relief for classes of beneficiaries. 5 \nAccepting the allegations in the complaint as true,6 and recognizing that \"Rule 23 \nis given liberal rather than restrictive construction, and courts are to adopt a standard of \nflexibility,\" Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372,377 (2d Cir. 1997) (quotation marks \nand citation omitted), the Court should certify this case to proceed as a class action. \nB.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(a). \nThe party seeking certification must satisfy \"the four threshold requirements\" set \nout in Rule 23(a) and also must demonstrate that the action is maintainable under one of \n5 See, e.g., Landers v. Leavitt, 232 F.R.D. 42 (D.Conn. 2005) (nationwide class \ncertified in challenge to Medicare condition of coverage); Healey v. Shalala, No. \n3:98CV00418 (DJS) (D.Conn., Nov. 19, 1998) (nationwide class certified in challenge to \nSecretary's failure to require home health agencies to provide procedural rights to \nbeneficiaries, discussed in appeal of merits sub nom. Lutwin v.  Thompson, 361 F.3d 146, \n148 (2d Cir. 2004»; Grijalva v. Shalala, 946 F.3d 1115, 1118 (9th Cir. 1998) (nationwide \nclass certified in due process challenge to Part C procedures), vacated in light of \nintervening legislation and decision, 526 U.S. 1096 (1999); Fox v. Bowen, 656 F.Supp. \n1236, 1238 n. 2 (D.Conn. 1987) (statewide class certified in challenge to Secretary's \napplication of Improvement Standard to Medicare beneficiaries). \n6 See, e.g., Shelter Realty Corp. v. Allied Maintenance Corp., 574 F.2d 656,661 \nn.15 (2d Cir. 1978); Alleyne v.  Time Moving & Storage Inc., 264 F.R.D. 41, 47 (E.D.N.Y. \n2010); Matyasovszky, 226 F.R.D. at 39. \n12 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 14 of 25\nthe three subdivisions of Rule 23(b).  Amchem Products, Inc. v.  Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, \n613 (1997); see also, e.g., Comer v. Cisneros, 37 F.3d 775, 796 (2d Cir. 1994); Brown v. \nCity ofB  arre, Vermont, 2010 WL 5141783 at *3 (D.Vt. 2010).  The district court must \ndetermine that plaintiffs meet each of the requirements of Rule 23 by considering all the \nrelevant evidence to establish whether the preponderance of the evidence standard is \nsatisfied.7  If the factors are satisfied, the Court must certify the class.  Shady Grove \nOrthopedic Associates, P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 130 S.Ct. 1431, 1437-38 (2010).  In this \ncase, as in similar challenges to the Secretary's policies in implementing Social Security \nAct benefit programs, the right to certification is easily demonstrated. \n1.  \"Numerosity\" or \"impracticability\": the size of the class \nand other factors demonstrate that joinder is \nimpracticable. \nThe first factor is the impracticability of joinder.  See, e.g., Comer, 37 F.3d at \n796; In Re Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, Inc., 960 F.2d 285, 290 (2d Cir. 1992). \nAlthough this is frequently referred to as the \"numerosity requirement,\" it is more \nproperly subsumed under the rubric of \"impracticability.\"  See, e.g., Wright, Miller & \nKane, 7A   Federal Practice and Procedure, § 1762 at 171 (3d ed. 2005); Anderson v. \nDept. ofP  ublic Welfare, 1 F.Supp.2d 456, 461 (E.D.Pa. 1998).  Accordingly, the Second, \nCircuit has made clear that its resolution depends \non all the circumstances surrounding a case, not on mere numbers. \nRelevant considerations include judicial economy arising from the \navoidance of a multiplicity of actions, geographic dispersion of class \nmembers, financial resources of class members, the ability of claimants to \ninstitute individual suits, and requests for prospective injunctive relief \n7  See, e.g., Teamsters Local 445 Freight Div. Pension Fund v. Bombadier, Inc., 546 \nF.3d 196,202 (2d Cir. 2008); In re Pub. Offerings Sec. Litig., 471 F.3d 24, 41-42 (2d Cir. \n2006); Brown, 2010 WL 5141783 at *3; Easterling v. Connecticut, 265 F.R.D. 45, 50 \n(D.Conn.2010). \n13 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 15 of 25\nwhich would involve future class members. \nRobidoux v.  Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 936 (2d Cir. 1993) (citations omitted); see also, e.g., \nMatyasovszky, 226 F.R.D. at 40; McGee v.  Gold, 2006 WL 2975752 at *3 (D.Vt. 2006); \nth \nAlba Conte and Herbert B. Newberg, 1 Newberg on Class Actions, § 3:6 at 249-253 (4\ned. 2002).  Furthermore, \"[i]mpracticable does not mean impossible.\" Robidoux, 987 \nF.2d at 935; Brown, 2010 WL 5141783 at *4. \nIn this case, the numbers alone are sufficient to resolve the matter. Although there \nis no magic number, see Petrolito v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 221 F.R.D. 303, \n308-309 (D.Conn. 2004), \"numerosity is presumed at a level of 40 members.\"  Conso!. \nRail Corp v.  Town ofH  yde Park, 47 F.3d 473,483 (2d Cir. 1995); see also, e.g., McGee, \n2006 WL 2975752 at *2.  Although there exists no known information specifically \ndetailing how many decisions are based on the Improvement Standard, the available \ninformation indicates that the class has well over the forty members at which the \npresumption of impracticability adheres. \nFirst, plaintiffs have alleged that the class is estimated to include \"at least tens of \nthousands of members,\" Complaint, ~ 21, and unrefuted allegations may suffice to satisfy \nthe standard.  See, e.g., Haddock v. Nationwide Financial Services, 262 F .R.D. 97, 116 \n(D.Conn.2009).  Moreover, this allegation is a reasonable one.  In 2008, in Part A, 15.4 \nmillion claims were denied, and, of these, 265,000 were appealed to the redetermination \nlevel.  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, \"Fact Sheet: Original Medicare (Fee \nFor-Service) Appeals Data - 2008,\" at 2 (available at \n8 \nhttp://www. cms. gov/ OrgMedFFSAppeals/Downloads/factsheet2008. pdf).  Of those \n8  The Part B figures are available at the same website, but plaintiffs believe that Part \n14 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 16 of 25\ndenied at that stage, 76,051 Part A claims were appealed to the next level, \nreconsideration.  Id. at 6. \nThus, at the three lowest levels of Part A decision-making - initial determination, \nredetermination, and reconsideration - there were, respectively, millions, hundreds of \nthousands, and tens of thousands of claims at issue in a year.  Even if only 1%   of these \ndenials relied on the Improvement Standard, the numbers for the respective levels would \nbe 154,000,2,650, and 760 in a year.  In fact, though, because the 1%   figure is \nunrealistically low, and because these numbers do not include claims denied under Parts \nBand C, the number of Medicare beneficiaries affected in a given year by the \nImprovement Standard must be considerably higher.  In any event, it is clear that, at any \ngiven time, tens of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries have their Part A claims denied \nbecause of the Improvement Standard. \nA \"court may make common sense assumptions to support a finding of \nnumerosity.\"  Brown, 2010 WL 5141783 at *4 (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted); see also, e.g., State ofC  onn. Office ofP  rotection and Advocacy for Persons \nwith Disabilities v. State ofC  onnecticut, 706 F. Supp. 2d 266,287 (D.Conn. 2010) \n(\"permissible for the plaintiffs to rely on reasonable inferences drawn from the available \nfacts\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The available information \ndemonstrates that the class is sufficiently large to preclude joinder as a practical \npossibility.  See Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 935 (plaintiffs need not present \"evidence of exact \nA accounts for the great majority of the claims involving the Improvement Standard, and, \naccordingly, even though there are many more Part B claims and denials, plaintiffs will \nrefer to the Part A claims to simplify the discussion.  Plaintiffs have been unable to locate \nany comparable statistics for Part C claims. \n15 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 17 of 25\nclass size or identity of class members to satisfy the numerosity requirement\").  On that \nbasis alone, subsection 23(a)(1) is met. \nIn any event, though, the \"other indicia of impracticability,\" Jordan v.  County of \nLos Angeles, 669 F.2d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir.), vacated on other grounds, 459 U.S. 810 \n(1982), leave no doubt that the subsection is met.  First, it would be extraordinarily \ninefficient to have numerous lawsuits on this issue, as they would all focus on the same \npoint, the illegal application of the Improvement Standard.  It would \"serve judicial \neconomy\" to allow this case to proceed as a class action.  Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 936. \nSecond, the Secretary's determination not to allow her challenged policy to be corrected \nby individual cases illustrates the need for class certification.  The government can \ncontinue to apply the standard, lose the occasional decision in an individual case, and not \nappeal, thereby insulating the policy from effective review.  It would serve the interests \nof justice for this case to proceed as a class action.  Accord, Brown, 2010 WL 5141783 at \n*6 (unknowable individuals in the future will benefit from a successful outcome and \nshould be included in the numerosity analysis). \nThird, the difficulty for individuals to bring suit or to join in this one is real.  By \ndefinition, the class members are elderly and disabled and are physically in poor \ncondition.  Many, probably most, are not financially well off, thus making \"individual \nsuits difficult to pursue.\" Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 936.  Furthermore, they reside \nthroughout the country, thus further exacerbating the difficulty of joinder.  Id. at 936 \n(\"potential class members are distributed over the entire area of Vermont\").  These \npractical impediments inherent in the membership of the class render it virtually \nimpossible for most class members to file individual cases or otherwise to participate. \n16 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 18 of 25\nFinally, as plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief for both present and \nfuture members of a class whose composition is constantly fluctuating, classwide relief is \nparticularly appropriate.  The numerosity requirement has generally been relaxed in that \ncontext.  Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 936; Brown, 2010 WL 5141783 at *5. \nThe available information indicates that, at any given time, thousands of Medicare \nbeneficiaries around the country are subject to the challenged policy.  Numbers alone are \nsufficient to satisfy this first component of Rule 23(a)(l), but the other indicia of \nimpracticability lend further support to that conclusion. \n2.  Rule 23(a)(2) and (3): Common questions of law and \nfact exist, and the claims of the named plaintiffs are \ntypical of the claims of the class members. \nThe next two factors, commonality and typicality, \ntend to merge into one another, so that similar considerations animate \nanalysis of Rules 23(a)(2) and (3).  The crux of both requirements is to \nensure that maintenance of a class action is economical and [that] the \nnamed plaintiff's claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the \ninterests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in \ntheir absence. \nMarisol A., 126 F.3d at 376 (citations and quotation marks omitted); see also Amchem \nProducts, Inc., 521 U.S. at 626 n. 20.  Moreover, when, as here, \"a plaintiff seeks \ninjunctive and declaratory relief, there is a presumption that both commonality and \ntypicality are present.\"  Brown, 2010 WL 5147183 at *6 (citation omitted). \n\"Courts have found that the test for commonality is not demanding .... \"  Raymond \nv. Rowland, 220 F.R.D. 173, 179 (D.Conn. 2004) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \n\"The commonality requirement is met if plaintiffs' grievances share a common question \noflaw or fact.\"  Marisol A., 126 F.3d at 376 (citations omitted). \nRule 23(a)(2) requires only that common questions exist at the core of the \n17 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 19 of 25\ncause of action alleged.  Where the question of law involves standardized \nconduct of the defendant toward members of the proposed class ... the \ncommonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) is usually met. \nEasterling, 265 F.R.D. at 52 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \n\"Commonality is established so long as the plaintiffs can identify some unifying thread \namong the members' claims.\"  Haddock, 262 F.R.D. at 116 (citations and internal \nquotation marks omitted).  \"Minor factual differences will not preclude class certification \nif there is a common question oflaw.\" State ofC  onn. Office for Protection and Advocacy \nfor Persons with Disabilities, 706 F. Supp. 2d at 287 (citation omitted). \nIn this case, as in others involving the failure of a government agency to meet its \nobligations, there can be little doubt that commonality is satisfied.  As noted in a Second \nCircuit decision involving another benefit program, \"the questions of law, which \npredominantly focus on whether the behavior of the defendants violated the [relevant \nstatute and provisions] of the Constitution, are, by necessity, common to the class \nbecause they do not depend on the plaintiff-variable but on the defendants, who are a \nconstant.\" Comer, 37 F.3d at 796-97. \nHere, there are common questions of both law and fact.  The common questions \nof law are whether application of the Improvement Standard violates the Medicare statute \nand regulations, whether the policy has been carried out in violation of the AP A, the \nMedicare statute's procedural requirements, and the Freedom ofInforrnation Act, and \nwhether it runs afoul of the Due Process Clause.  In the most basic sense, these are \n\"common issue[s] the resolution of which will advance the litigation.\"  Petrolito, 221 \nF.R.D. at 309 (quotation marks and citation omitted).  The common question of fact is \nthat all the class members are Medicare beneficiaries who are in need of health care and \n18 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 20 of 25\nwho have had their Medicare coverage denied or terminated by application of the \nImprovement Standard. \nIn short, \"the lawsuit focuses on the behavior of the defendants and not that of the \nplaintiffs.\"  Comer, 37 F.3d at 797.  Commonality is easily met. \nThe \"typicality requirement is satisfied when each class member's claim arises \nfrom the same course of events and each class member makes similar legal arguments to \nprove the defendant's liability.\" Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 936 (citations omitted); see also, \ne.g., Caridad v. Metro-North Commuter R.R., 191 F.3d 283, 293 (2d Cir. 1999); Marisol \nA., 126 F.3d at 376.  \"In government benefit class actions, the typicality requirement is \ngenerally satisfied when the representative plaintiff is subject to the same statute, \nregulation, or policy as class members.\"  Matyasovszky, 226 F.R.D. at 42 (quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).  Again, this standard is easily satisfied, as the claims of the \nnamed plaintiffs and the class members all arise from the Secretary's policy of applying \nthe Improvement Standard in the face of regulations to the contrary.  Furthermore, the \nnamed plaintiffs and the class members are making the same arguments to demonstrate \nthat the Secretary's policy is illegal. \n\"When it is alleged that the same unlawful conduct was directed at or affected \nboth the named plaintiff and the class sought to be represented, the typicality requirement \nis usually met irrespective of minor variations in the fact patterns underlying individual \nclaims.\" Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 936-937 (citations omitted).  By proving their claims, the \nnamed plaintiffs will necessarily prove the class members' claims as well.  Typicality is \ntherefore met. \n19 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 21 of 25\n3.  Rule 23(a)(4): The named plaintiffs will protect the \ninterests of the class. \nThe adequacy of representation requirement \"is motivated by concerns similar to \nthose driving the commonality and typicality requirement, namely, the efficiency and \nfairness of class certification.\" Marisol A., 126 F.3d at 378; see also Amchem Products, \nInc., 521 U.S. at 626 n. 20 (adequacy of representation requirement tends to merge with \nthe commonality and typicality requirements).  The requirement \nentails inquiry as to whether: 1) plaintiff's interests are antagonistic to the \ninterest of other members of the class and 2) plaintiff's attorneys are \nqualified, experienced and able to conduct the litigation.  The focus is on \nuncovering conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they \nseek to represent.  In order to defeat a motion for certification, however, \nthe conflict must be fundamental. \nIn re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. Securities Lit., 574 F.3d 29,35 (2d Cir. 2009) \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., Marisol A., 126 F.3d at \n378. \nWith respect to the first prong, the named plaintiffs suffer from having the \nImprovement Standard applied to them just as it is and will be applied to the class \nmembers.  They seek relief requiring the defendant to take corrective measures that \nwould benefit the class members as well as the named plaintiffs.  Accord, Marisol A., 126 \nF.3d at 378.  \"[B]ecause there are legal issues common to the class, the plaintiffs ... will \nbe protecting the interests of the class by advancing their own legal interests in the case \n.... \"  Doe v. Bridgeport Police Dept., 198 F.R.D. 325, 333 CD.Conn. 2001).  There is no \nantagonism or conflict between the named plaintiffs and the class members, and the \nlatter's rights will be fully protected and enforced by provision of the relief requested by \nthe named plaintiffs. \n20 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 22 of 25\nOn the second prong, plaintiffs' counsel have demonstrated their ability to handle \nthis litigation by vigorously representing Medicare beneficiaries, as well as beneficiaries \nof other Social Security Act programs, for many years.9  Because of this extensive \nrelevant experience, plaintiffs' counsel are usually not questioned on the issue of \nlo \nadequacy of representation.\nC.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b )(2). \n\"In addition to satisfying Rule 23(a)'s prerequisites, parties seeking class \ncertification must show that the action is maintainable under Rule 23(b)(l), (2), or (3).\" \nAmchem Products, Inc., 521 U.S. at 614.  Under (b)(2), \"[c]lass certification is \nappropriate where the defendant has acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the class, thereby making i~unctive or declaratory relief appropriate.\" \nMarisol A., 126 F.3d at 378.  \"The entire purpose behind Rule 23(b)(2) is to resolve \ndisputes concerning the existence of a policy and practice of discrimination against a \nbroad class of individuals.\" State of Conn. Office for Protection and Advocacy for \nPersons with Disabilities, 706 F. Supp. 2d at 288 (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). \n9 A representative sample of reported Medicare decisions on which plaintiffs' \ncounsel have served as lead or co-counsel includes Machado v. Leavitt, 542 F.Supp.2d \n185 (D.Mass. 2008); Situ v. Leavitt, 240 F.R.D. 551 (N.D.Cal. 2007); Landers v.

Thompson, 361 F.3d 146 (2d Cir. 2004); Fox v. \nBowen, 656 F.Supp. 1236 (D.Conn. 1987). \nAccordingly, and in order to avoid unnecessary filings, they are not filing \n10 \ndeclarations in support of their stated experience.  See, e.g., Raymond, 220 F.R.D. at 180 \n(court relies on pleadings to conclude that plaintiffs' counsel are competent to handle the \nlitigation); Doe, 198 F.R.D. at 333 (same).  If it is deemed necessary, however, plaintiffs' \ncounsel will further document their experience with declarations. \n21 \n\n..  Case 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 23 of 25\nAgain, there can be little doubt that plaintiffs meet this requirement.  This case \npresents the paradigm of a Rule 23(b )(2) class action, as plaintiffs seek injunctive relief \nand they predicate the lawsuit on the defendant's acts and omissions with respect to the \nclass, namely, her policy of applying the Improvement Standard in the face of contrary \nregulations.  Since the \"deficiencies ... stem from central and systemic failures\" by the \nSecretary, class certification under Rule 23(b )(2) is the appropriate vehicle for resolving \nthe matter.  Marisol A., 126 F.3d at 378; see also Yamasaki, 442 U.S. at 700-701 ((b)(2) \nclass appropriate in challenge to procedures used in Social Security Act case); Raymond, \n220 F.R.D. at 181 (\"Cases of this nature, alleging systemic failure of governmental \nbodies to properly fulfill statutory requirements, have been held to be appropriate for \nclass certification under Rule 23(b )(2)\"). \nIV.  PLAINTIFFS' COUNSEL SHOULD BE APPOINTED AS CLASS \nCOUNSEL. \nRule 23(g) requires a court to appoint \"class counsel\" when a class is certified. \nF.R.Civ.P.23(g)(1).  An applicant for class counsel must satisfy subsections (1) and (4) \nof Rule 23(g) ifthere is only one applicant, as is the case here.  F.R.Civ.P.23(g)(2). \nClosely tracking the language of Rule 23(a)(4), Rule 23(g)(4) requires that an \nattorney serving as class counsel \"fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \nclass.\"  Plaintiffs have already shown how their attorneys, based on their histories of \nexperience with Medicare and other Social Security Act programs, will fairly and \nadequately represent the class. \nRule (g)(l)(A) directs the Court to consider \n(i) the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential \nclaims in the action; (ii) counsel's experience in handling class actions, \nother complex litigation, and claims of the type asserted in the action; (iii) \n22 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 24 of 25\ncounsel's knowledge of the applicable law; and (iv) the resources counsel \nwill commit to representing the class. \nThe Court may also consider \"any other matter pertinent to counsel's ability to fairly and \nadequately represent the interests ofthe class.\"  F.R.Civ.P.23(g)(1)(B).  The Advisory \nCommittee Notes to the 2003 amendments that added subsection (g) state that \"[i]n \nevaluating prospective class counsel, the court should weigh all pertinent factors.  No \nsingle factor should necessarily be determinative in a given case.\" \nConsidering these factors, it is clear that plaintiffs' counsel have fully and \ncompletely identified the legal issues, as they have raised claims under the Medicare \nstatute, the AP A, the Freedom of Information Act, and the Due Process Clause.  Their \nexperience, as reflected in the sample of decisions listed in footnote 9, shows that they \nhave extensive backgrounds in class actions, in the legal and factual issues raised by this \ncase, and in Medicare law.  Furthermore, the individual attorneys will have behind them \nthe resources of both state and national organizations that for many years have \nspecialized in the rights of the elderly and disabled and advocated aggressively on their \nbehalf.  There can be little doubt that they will meet the goal set out in the Advisory \nCommittee Notes of \"ensur[ing] adequate representation for the class.\" \nPlaintiffs' attorneys' experience, dedication, and knowledge are fully reflected in \ntheir lengthy careers on behalf of the elderly and disabled.  Conversely, no reason \npresents itself as to why they should not be appointed as class counsel.  A fair weighing \nof the factors set out at Rule 23(g) leads to the conclusion that plaintiffs' counsel should \nbe appointed as class counsel.  See, e.g., Landers, 232 F.R.D. at 48 (appointing several \nattorneys from the Center for Medicare Advocacy, Inc. as class counsel in a Medicare \nclass action). \n23 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 4-1   Filed 01/18/11   Page 25 of 25\nJ \nv.  CONCLUSION \nAs plaintiffs meet all the requirements of Rule 23(a) and subdivision (2) of Rule \n23(b), the Court should certify the class. \nDATED: January 13,2011 \nRespectfully submitted, \nGill Deford \nJudith A.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n1. This is an action for declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus reliefagainst\nthe Secretary ofHealth and Human Services (the Secretary) asthe official responsible for\nimplementing and enforcingthe Medicare program. Under the Medicare statute and\nregulations, coverage is available for healthcare and therapy services that are \"reasonable\nand necessary for the diagnosis ortreatment ofillness or injury.\" This standard requires\nthe evaluationfor coverage on the basis ofabeneficiary's unique condition and\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 2 of 45\nindividual needs. The Secretary, however, imposes a covertrule ofthumb that operates\nas an additional and illegal condition ofcoverage and results in the termination,\nreduction, or denial ofcoverage for thousands ofMedicare beneficiaries annually.\n2. This additional conditionofeligibility, which is usually implemented at\nthe lower levels ofMedicare's administrative reviewprocess where the overwhelming\nmajority ofdecisions are made, is referredto and implementedby one or more ofseveral\nphrases, includingthatthe beneficiary needs \"maintenance services only,\" has\n\"plateaued,\" or is \"chronic,\" \"medically stable,\" or not improving. The shorthandterm\nfor this rule ofthumb masquerading as a condition ofcoverage is the Improvement\nStandard.\n3. The Improvement Standard is not supported by the Medicare statute or\nregulations. Because it has beenimplementedwithout notice-and-commentrulemaking\nand without publication in the Federal Register, beneficiaries have little or no\nunderstanding ofits applicationand cannotknow, and/or do not have the resources, to\nseek further review. Despite numerous court decisions repudiating the Improvement\nStandard and dictating that each beneficiary's situation shouldbe evaluated on an\nindividualized basis, the Improvement Standard continues to be applied, especiallyby\nemployees ofMedicare contractors and intermediaries who ignore the correctcoverage\nstandards. The regular, on-going application ofthe Improvement Standard in this context\namounts to a clandestine policythat is condoned and implemented by the Secretary.\n4. The impact ofthe Improvement Standard falls primarily on patients with\nchronic conditions. As their healthdeteriorates their need for nursing services and\nphysical, occupational, and speechtherapies increases. The skilled care denied them\n2\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 3 of 45\nunder the Improvement Standard is critical to slow their disease process and to maintain\ntheir functional ability, yet these are precisely the patients who are most likely to have\ntheir coverage denied, terminated, or reduced.\n5. The Improvement Standard operates as a covertconditionofcoverage that\nsimultaneously deprives beneficiaries ofcoverage to which they are entitledwhile\neffectively denying them the ability to correctits application. Itviolates the Medicare\nstatute and regulations, the Administrative Procedure Act's and the Medicare statute's\nrequirements for notice-and-commentrulemaking, the Freedom ofInformationAct's\nrequirement ofpublication, and the Due Process Clause ofthe Fifth Amendment.\n6. On behalfofthemselves, their members and constituents, and the\nnationwide class ofMedicare beneficiaries whom they represent and who are harmed by\nthe Improvement Standard, the plaintiffs -- national organizations and individual\nbeneficiaries -- seek declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus reliefto terminate application\nofthe Improvement Standard and to provide remedies to those illegally denied coverage\nas a result ofits application.\nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n7. Jurisdictionis conferred on this court by28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1361 and\nby 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), as incorporated by 42 U.S.c. §§ 1395ff(b)(1)(A) and 1395w \n22(g)(5). Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) and 42 U.S.C. §\n405(g).\nIII. PARTIES\n8. PlaintiffGLENDA JIMMO was born in 1936 and is aresident ofBristol,\nVermont. At all relevant times she has been eligible for Medicare Parts A and B. A\n3\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 4 of 45\ndecision by an administrative lawjudge, dated June 16,2010, denied her coverage for\nhome health services furnished to her between January 14,2007 and January 8,2008.\nThat decision was affirmed by the Medicare Appeals Council in a decision dated\nDecember28, 2010.\n9. PlaintiffKRwas born in 1960and is aresident ofBennington, Vermont.\nShe is represented in this action by her guardian. At all relevant times she has been\neligible for Medicare Parts A and B. A decisionby an administrative lawjudge, dated\nNovember 16,2010, denied her coverage for home health skilled therapy services\nprovided from September 26, 2008 to December 18,2008. That decisionwas appealed to\nthe Medicare Appeals Council on December22,2010.\n10. PlaintiffMIRIAM KATZ, the widow ofDavid Katz, is named asthe\nexecutor in his will. David Katz was born in 1920and was a resident ofBloomfield,\nConnecticut before he died on December 25, 2010. At all relevanttimes he was eligible\nfor Medicare Parts A and B. In a reconsideration decisionon expedited review by a\nQualified Independent Contractoron December 3, 2010, coverage for his skilled nursing\nfacility care was denied beginningDecember 1,2010.\n11. PlaintiffEDITH MASTERMAN was born in 1931 and lives in Wilton,\nMaine. At all relevant times she was eligible for Medicare Parts A and B. Because the\nonly Medicare certified home health agency in her area has determined, pursuant to the\nImprovement Standard, that she would not be covered under Medicare for its services,\nshe cannot receive care from that agency, obtain an initial Medicare determinationthat\nthose services are not covered, or appeal the denial ofMedicare coverage.\n12.

She is sued in her official capacity.\n6\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 7 of 45\nIV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n22. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalfofthemselves and all others similarly\nsituated, pursuantto Rules 23(a) and (b)(2) ofthe Federal Rules ofCivil Procedure. The\nclass is defined as:\nAll beneficiaries ofMedicare Parts A, B, or C who have had or will have\ncoverage for healthcare or therapy services, as an outpatient, in ahospital, in a\nskillednursing facility, or in a home healthcare setting, denied, terminated, or\nreduced due to the application ofthe Improvement Standard, on or after January\n1,2006.\n23. Joinder is impracticable due to the large number ofclass members and for\notherreasons, including, butnot limitedto, their geographic diversity, their ages and/or\ndisabilities, and their relatively low incomes. On information and belief, plaintiffs\nestimate the class to include at leasttens ofthousands ofmembers.\n24. There are questions offact and law commonto the class members.\nCommonfacts include, inter alia, that all class members have had their Medicare\ncoverage reduced, denied, or terminated on the ground that their conditions were not\nimproving. The commonquestions oflaw include, inter alia, whether the Secretary\nviolates the Medicare statute in imposing this covert condition ofeligibility and whether\nthat policy has been implemented in violationofprocedural rules such as the notice-and \ncommentrequirements ofthe Administrative ProcedureAct and the Medicare statute.\n25. The claims ofthe named plaintiffs are typical ofthose ofthe class\nmembers in that they have been denied Medicare coverage, despite satisfying the\n7\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 8 of 45\nstatute's reasonable and necessary requirement, because ofthe application ofthe\nImprovement Standard.\n26. The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protectthe interests ofthe\nclass. They have no interestthat is or may be potentially antagonistic to the interests of\nthe class and seek the same reliefas the class members, that is, aprohibition against the\ncontinued use ofthe Improvement Standard. Moreover, plaintiffs are represented by\ncompetent counsel from establishedpublic interest law firms, the Center for Medicare\nAdvocacy, Inc. and the Medicare Advocacy ProjectofVermont Legal Aid. The\nattorneys are experienced in federal litigation involving public benefitprograms in\ngeneral and Medicare in particular, have litigated other cases involvingthe Improvement\nStandard, and have represented classes in numerous other cases involving Medicare and\nother public benefit programs.\n27. The Secretaryhas acted and continuesto act on grounds generally\napplicable to the class as a whole, thereby making appropriate final injunctive and\ndeclaratory reliefwith respect to the class as awhole, pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) ofthe\nFederal Rules ofCivil Procedure.\nV. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\nA. Overview\n28. Medicare, whichis codified as Title XVIII ofthe Social SecurityAct, is\nthe federally funded and administeredprogram ofhealth insurance for those who are 65\nand over or are disabled. Under Part A ofMedicare, for which eligibility is automatic for\nrecipients ofSocial Security old age and disability benefits (Title IIofthe Social Security\nAct), beneficiaries are entitledto coverage for hospital, skilled nursing facility care, home\n8\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 9 of 45\nhealth care, and hospice services. Part BofMedicare establishes avoluntary program of\nsupplemental medical insurance providing coverage for physicians, nurse practitioners,\nhome health, physical, speech and occupationaltherapy, diagnostic services, and durable\nmedical equipment. Under Part C (the Medicare Advantage program), beneficiaries may\nopt to enroll in a managed care planin lieu ofthe traditional approachin \"original\nMedicare\" as provided in Parts A and B.\n29. The threshold for Medicare coverage is its medical necessity requirement,\nwhich states in applicable part that \"no paymentmay be made ... for any expenses\nincurred for items or services which ... are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis\nor treatment ofillness or injury orto improve the functioning ofa malformed body\nmember.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1395y(a)(1)(A).\n30. Other than the reference in the last clause ofsubsection 1395y(a)(1)(A) to\ncoverage for \"improv[ing] the functioning ofamalformed body member,\" the Medicare\nstatute does not state or imply at any point that improvement, or any comparable\nphraseology, is a condition ofcoverage.\nB. The Regulatory Requirements\n31. The relevant regulation for coverage in the skilled nursing facility (SNF)\ncontextmakes it clear that the Improvement Standard does not determine coverage: \"The\nrestoration potential ofa patient is not the deciding factor in determining whether skilled\nservices are needed. Even iffull recovery ormedical improvementis not possible, a\npatientmay need skilled services to prevent further deterioration or preserve current\ncapabilities.\" 42 C.F.R. §409.32(c). The regulations applicable to coverage ofhome\nhealthcare incorporate by reference the definition ofskilled nursing care and thus the\n9\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 10 of 45\nabove standard. 42 C.F.R. §409.44(b)(1).\n32. The regulations further dictate, in defining the \"reasonableand necessary\"\nstandard, that the individual's \"unique\" situation is the cornerstone for coverage. The\nhome health regulation states in part: \"The intermediary's decision on whether care is\nreasonable and necessary is based on information ... concerningthe unique medical\ncondition ofthe individual beneficiary.\" 42 C.F.R. §409.44(a). Itfurther dictates that\n\"[t]he determination ofwhether skilled nursing care is reasonable andnecessary must be\nbased solely upon the beneficiary's unique condition and individual needs, without regard\nto whether the illness or injury is acute, chronic, terminal, or expected to last a long\ntime.\" 42 C.F.R. §409.44(b)(3)(iii).\n33. The home health regulations related to physical, speech, and occupational\ntherapy provide for Medicare coverage for services to restore or to maintain function. 42\nC.F.R. §409.44(c)(2).\n34. Many ofCMS' manual provisions support and reinforce the regulatory\nprohibition against an Improvement Standard as a condition ofcoverage. The Medicare\nBenefitPolicy Manual (MBPM) states that the determination ofwhether a skilled service\nis reasonable and necessary cannot be based on \"rules ofthumb,\" but instead requires\nassessmentofthe particular individual's need for care. Internet Only Manual (10M) 100 \n02, MBPM, ch. 7, §§20.3, 40.2. The Manual reiterates the regulatory languagerequiring\nassessment \"ofthe beneficiary's unique condition and individual needs\" and adds that\n\"skilledcare may, depending on the unique condition ofthe patient, continue to be\n10\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 11 of 45\nnecessary for patients whose conditionis stable.\" Id., §40.1.1.\n35. Lower level decision-makers, however, rarely follow these regulatory and\nManual prohibitions againstthe Improvement Standard. Instead, they rely on other\npolicyprovisions, Medicare contractor instructions, and Local Coverage Determinations\n(LCOs). LCDs are createdby individual contractorsto provide guidance in those\njurisdictions in which they operate. LCDs often employ language that enforces an\nImprovement Standard. See, e.g., LCD 10 # L23604 (\"There must be an expectationthat\nthe conditionwill improve significantly in areasonable and generally predictable period\noftime ....\"); LCD 10 # L340 (\"The documentation supports the expectationthat the\nbeneficiary's conditionwill improve significantly in areasonable and generally\npredictable period oftime.\"). As arule, lower level decision-makers will rely on more\nrestrictive internal guidelines, policies, and LCDs rather thanon contraryregulations or\nManual provisions. LCDs are not binding on administrative lawjudges.\nC. The Administrative Review Process\n36. Underoriginal Medicare (Parts A and B), a beneficiarywho has been\ninformed by the providerthat the services at issue are not expectedto be coveredmust\nobtain an \"initial determination\" from the Medicare contractor. This formal statement of\nnon-coverage is provided as part ofthe Medicare SummaryNotice (MSN), which the\ncontractors issue on a quarterly basis.\n37. Under the standard reviewprocess, the beneficiaryrequests reviewofthe\nMSN \"initial determination\" by filing for aredeterminationby the Medicare contractor.\n11\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 12 of 45\n•\nIfthe decision remains adverse, the beneficiarymay seek reconsideration from the\nQualified Independent Contractor (QIC).\n38. Under the expedited review process that is available for discharge from a\nSNF, home healthcare, or ahospice, the provider must generally give notice two days\nbefore the discharge ortermination occurs. The beneficiaryhas until noon ofthe next\ncalendar day to request an expedited determination by the Quality Improvement\nOrganization (QIO). Ifthe QIO upholds the provider's decision, the beneficiaryhas until\nnoon ofthe next calendar day to seek reconsideration from the QIC.\n39. The remaining steps arethe same for bothstandard and expeditedreview.\nThese include a de novo review by an administrative lawjudge (ALl) ifthe amount in\ncontroversy is at least $130 in 2010 and 2011 and anon-the-record review ofthe ALl's\ndecisionbythe Medicare Appeals Council (MAC), with the same amounts in\ncontroversy. Review in federal district court is then available for cases inwhichthe\namount in controversy is at least $1,300 in 2011.\n40. For claims under Part C (the Medicare Advantage or MA program), the\ninitial determination, which is known as an \"organizationdetermination,\" and the\nreconsideration determination, iffully favorable, are both made by the Medicare\nAdvantage plan, in both the standard and expeditedprocesses. When a reconsideration\ndeterminationwill be adverse to the beneficiary, the case is automatically sent to the\nIndependent Review Entity (IRE), whichis an external revieworganizationhired by\nCMS for the purpose ofreviewing decisions by MA plans and which will issue the\n12\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 13 of 45\nreconsideration decision.\n41. The remaining available steps after IRE review are the same as for Parts A\nand B: ALJ, MAC, and federal districtcourt.\n42. Ifthe MAC fails to issue its decisionwithinthe appropriate time frames\n(which is usually 90 days from receiptofthe request for review), the appellant may\nrequest escalationofthe case to federal district court.\n43. UnderParts A and B, a beneficiary cannot obtain acoverage decision\npriorto receiving the care. Consequently, access to and proceedingthroughthe system of\nadministrative review requires the beneficiary's obligationto pay for the care or services.\nBeneficiaries confrontedwith having to pay for care for which coverage may be denied\noftendecline the needed care because their financial situationmakes it difficultor\nimpossible to pay. As a consequence, they are unable to obtain administrative reviewof\ntheirrightto Medicare coverage. Under PartC, a beneficiary can receive a coverage\ndecision priorto receiving the care or services at issue.\nD. Application ofthe Improvement Standard Below the ALJ Level\n44. Uponinformation and belief, it is the standardpractice ofproviders,\ncontractors, QIOs, QICs, and IREs to apply LCDs and internal guidelines and policies\nthatestablishthe Improvement Standard as a rule ofthumb on whichMedicare coverage\nis conditioned, in disregard ofthe regulatory and manual provisions that require a\ncoverage determination to be based on the beneficiary's individual condition and needs.\nThis approach holds true for decisions made under each ofParts A, B, and C.\n13\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 14 of 45\n•\n45. The applicationofthe Improvement Standard atthe lower levels ofreview\nimposes an additional conditionofeligibility. Ithas the twofold effect ofdenying\ncoverageto beneficiaries who are entitled to it and discouragingthem from seeking\nreview becausethe Improvement Standard, as stated, appears to be impossible to\novercome.\n46. In 2008, only about 1.7% ofall Part A denied claims and 1.8% ofall Part\nB denied claims were appealed to the next level, the redeterminationlevel. eMS, \"Fact\nSheet: Original Medicare (Fee-For-Service) Appeals Data - 2008,\" at 2, available at\ncms.gov/OrgMedFFSAppealslDownloads/Feeshet2008.pdf. Only about 0.5% ofPart A\ndenied claims and 0.22% ofPart B denied claims were appealed to the reconsideration\nlevel. Id. at 6. In FY 2008, the number ofall Medicare appeals taken to ALJs was\n32,960, which included 185,665 claims. Office ofMedicare Hearings and Appeals\nwebsite, at http://www.hhs.gov/omha/resources/index.html. Estimating and extrapolating\nfrom these figures suggestthat the percentage ofadverse initial denials that reach the ALJ\nlevel is extremely small, probablyin the range of0.02% to 0.05%. Furthermore, the\npercentage ofadverse initial determinations based on the Improvement Standard is\nprobablylower still thanthe overall percentage becausebeneficiaries are less likely to\nappeal when the Improvement Standard is applied to them. They generally do not appeal\nbecause the Improvement Standard, as it is presentedto them, suggests that they cannot\nsucceed on appeal. Accordingly, on information and belief, only aminuscule percentage\nofbeneficiaries who are denied based on the Improvement Standard appeal the denial to\n14\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 15 of 45\nthe ALJ level.\n47. Upon information and belief, the Secretary is aware that the Improvement\nStandard is consistently imposed by her Medicare contractors but has not taken action to\nrequire that the properpolicies be carried out. This refusal to correctthe situationhas\noccurred despite numerous federal courtdecisions repudiating the Improvement Standard\nas a condition ofcoverage.\nVI. FACTUAL STATEMENT\nPlaintiffGlenda Jimmo\n48. Duringthe periods at issue, plaintiffGlendaJimmo was a 71-year-old\nresident ofVermontwho was legally blind and had a below-the-knee amputation. She\nsuffered from diabetes mellitus with circulatory disorder, transientcerebral ischemia,\nperipheral vascular disease, angina, and, later, diverticulitis. Transient cerebral ischemia\nis a serious disorderthat could lead to a stroke or death ofbraincells and may be caused\nby uncontrolled diabetes. Peripheral vasculardisease is also a serious disorder with the\npossibilityofblood clots, open sores, and tissue death. Possible complications ofangina\ninclude heart attackor death. Duringthe time periods in question, Ms. Jimmo suffered\nchestpains. Herphysicianprescribed overtwenty medications to address these disorders.\nThese medications includednitroglycerine, an overdose ofwhich can cause seizures or a\ncoma.\n49. As aresultofher substantial, disabling medical conditions, her physician\nordered intermittent skillednursing and home health aide nursing servicesto be provided\n15\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 16 of 45\ninher home. Her physician certified her need forthese services on the plan ofcareand\nalso certified that she was homebound.\n50. Her claims for Medicare coverage forthe home health services received\nfrom January 14,2007to January 8,2008 were denied initiallyand atthe redetermination\nlevel. Indenying her coverage atredetermination, the Medicare contractor statedthat\n\"[h]er condition was stable with no acutechanges.\"\n51. At the reconsiderationlevel ofreview, the QIC affirmed the denial of\ncoverage, stating, inter alia, that \"[t]he likelihood ofa change inthe patient's condition\nrequiring skilled nursing services was not supported in the documentation.\"\n52. A timely filed request forreview by an ALJ resulted in adecision dated\nJune 16,201athat shewas not entitledto coverage under Part A forthose services. In\nmaking that determination, the ALJ, likethe lower level contractors before him, applied\nthe Improvement Standard. He stated, inter alia, that \"[0]bservationand assessment of\nthe Beneficiary was not necessary asthe Beneficiary was stable .... The Beneficiary's\ncondition did not significantly changes [sic] duringthe period at issue and the plan of\ncare did not undergo changes.\"\n53. PlaintiffJimmo timely appealed the ALJ decision in arequest to the MAC\ndated August 8,2010. The decision ofthe MAC was due within 90 days ofthe MAC's\nreceipt ofthe request for review. As ofDecember 22, 2010, the decision had not been\nreceived. Accordingly, on that date plaintiffJimmo senta request by Federal Express\novernight mail to the MAC that the case be escalated to district court.\n16\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 17 of 45\n54. By decision dated December28,2010 and received by plaintiffJimmo on\nDecember 30,2010, the MAC affirmedthe decision ofthe ALJ. Itagreed with the ALJ\n\"thatthe wound care was not complex, the beneficiary was stable and seen frequently in\nher physician's office for lesions and debridement, and neither her condition nor the plan\nofcare changed significantly during the period at issue.\" Accordingly, \"[t]he Council\nsees no basis for changing the ALl's decision. The Council therefore adopts the ALl's\ndecision.\"\nPlaintiffKR\n55. Duringthe periods at issue, plaintiffKR, aresidentofVermont, was a 48-\nyear-old severely disabled woman, suffering from congenital quadriplegia, patellofemoral\nsyndrome, epilepsy, depression, and impulse control disorder. She has significant\ncognitive impairments, including mental retardation. She has paralysis on her right side,\nand has cerebral palsy on her left side causingher left leg and hand to be weak. She\nrequires the use ofeither awheelchair or walker and needs the assistance ofone and\nsometimestwo peopleto go out.\n56. As aresult ofKR's substantial physical and mental limitations, Kenneth\nRoberts was duly appointed as her co-guardianby the Bennington [Vermont] District\nProbate Courtin 1998. He has full authority to act on KR's behalf, including proceeding\nin this action as her representative.\n57. Duringthe months at issue, from September26,2008, to December 18,\n2008, her outings outside her home were for her medical appointments, when she was\n17\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 18 of 45\naccompanied by her caregiver. At other times her caregiverhas taken KR grocery\nshopping once aweek when she was not ill.\n58. Her physician ordered skilledphysical therapy for her starting on\nSeptember 26,2008. Physical therapy was orderedto evaluate her functional ability,\nperformtherapeutic exercise, teach transfertechniques and gait training, and develop a\nhome exercise program.\n59. Her claim for Medicare coverage for these physical therapy services from\nSeptember26, 2008 through December 18,2008 was denied initially and at the\nredetermination level ofreview.\n60. At the reconsideration level ofreview, the QIC affirmed the denial of\ncoverage, noting thatthe contractor atthe redetermination level had determinedthat \"the\nservices failed to meet Medicare criteria for coverage because therapy services may be\ncovered whenthere is areasonable expectationthat the beneficiary will show measurable\nimprovement in performingnormal daily activities.\" In agreeing with this assessment,\nthe QIC held that the \"submitteddocumentationdid not support that the beneficiaryhad\nexperienced an acute episode or exacerbation ofchronic conditionresulting in a complex\nfunctional deficitto warrant skilled therapy intervention.\"\n61. A timely filed request for review by an ALl resulted in a decision dated\nNovember 16,2010that she was not entitledto coverage for those services.\n62. In making that decision, the ALl relied on the Improvement Standard, like\nthe lower level contractors before him, noting that \"[tjhe services must be providedwith\n18\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 19 of 45\nthe expectationthat the condition ofthe patientwill improve materially in a reasonable\nand generally predictable period oftime.\" Relying onthat standard, the ALl held that\n\"one cannotdetermine whether there is a reasonable expectation ofmaterial improvement\n.... [T]he submitted documentationdoes not support that [KR] had experienced an acute\nepisode or exacerbation ofchronic conditionresulting inacomplex functional deficit to\nwarrant skilled intervention.\"\n63. On behalfofplaintiffKR, atimely appeal ofthe ALl decision tothe MAC\nwas made by fax transmission on December 22, 2010.\nPlaintiffMiriam Katz\n64. PlaintiffMiriam Katz isthe widow ofDavid Katz, who died on December\n25,2010. Mrs. Katz isnamed asthe executor inher deceased husband's will.\n65. David Katz, who was 90 years old and aresident ofConnecticutwhen he\ndied on December25,2010, was hospitalized inNovember 2010 for metastatic rectal\ncancer and a high grade intestinal obstruction.\n66. He had been ina SNF sinceNovember 19,2010. Medicare covered his\nstaythere from November 19through November 30,2010.\n67. OnNovember 26, 2010, plaintiffMiriam Katz received a SNF Advance\nBeneficiaryNotice and a generic notice, both dated November22,2010, notifying her\nthat Mr. Katz would no longer be covered, effective after November 30, 2010. Upon her\nrequest for expeditedreviewofthat denial, she received an \"AgreementNotice of\nNoncoverage\" on December2, 2010. Then, continuingthe process ofexpedited review,\n19\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 20 of 45\nshe requested and received an independent reconsideration decision from the QIC dated\nDecember 3, 2010. That decision affirmed the denial ofcoverage because the \"care you\nare currently receiving is considered custodial and could be performedby unskilled aides,\nwho are trained in maintenance care.\"\n68. PlaintiffKatz has until February 1,2011 to request ALJ review ofthe\nreconsiderationdecision.\nPlaintiffEdithMasterman\n69. PlaintiffEdith Mastermanis 79 years old and lives in Maine. She has\nbeen aparaplegic since a farming accidentas ateenager. As a consequence she uses a\nwheelchairto get around, but has been able to remain at home with help from others. She\nalso has been diagnosed with diabetes.\n70. Over the last 10years, she has developed aproblem with pressure sores.\nAs a consequence, her wound care doctor ordered home healthcare for wound care. She\nreceived this care, which was covered by Medicare, on aregular basis from\nAndroscoggin Home Care & Hospice (AHCH) until shewas hospitalized in September\n2009 for surgery to perform a skin graft to repair a pressure sore.\n71. An infectionoccurred after the skin graft and she remained hospitalized\nuntil October 14,2009. Uponher release from the hospital, she was admitted to a skilled\nnursing facility from October 14,2009to January 18,2010. When she finally returned\nhome in January 2010 her physician ordered home health care, but AHCH refused to\naccepther back as apatienton the grounds that it \"cannotaccept Edithbecause her\nMedicare will not pay for a chronic problem\" and she needs long term care. AHCH\ninformed Ms. Mastermanthat Medicare would not cover the wound care her doctor\n20\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 21 of 45\nordered because Medicare does not pay for care when awound is chronic and never\nexpected to heal.\n72. Her doctors have been and arewilling to order home health care.\n73. Prior to her hospitalization, Medicare covered the services provided by an\nAHCH nurse who came to Ms. Masterman's home every other day. After her\nhospitalization and because she could not obtain Medicare coverage ofher home health\ncare, Ms. Masterman originally made weekly visits to the wound care clinic atthe\nhospital. She now visits the wound care clinic once every four weeks.\n74. She receives some home care services from Elder Independence ofMaine,\npaid for by Medicaid, which includes home health aides three times daily for about 1-1/2\nto 2hours per visit from Home Care ofMaine and aonce weekly skilled nursing visit\nfrom Care and Comfort.\n75. AHCH is the only Medicare certified home health agency in her area.\nMedicare-covered home health care from AHCH would be more frequent than the care\nshe now receives andwould freeher from the taxing effort and discomfort ofhaving to\ngoto the wound care clinic.\n76. Ms. Masterman only leaves her home now for doctor or clinic\nappointments. Home health aides do her shopping. She cannot get in and out ofbed by\nherself, but is able to move around her house once she is in her wheelchair.\n77. Because AHCH refuses to accept her as apatient due to itsbeliefthat the\nImprovement Standard would deny her coverage, Ms. Mastermanis not ableto have a\nclaim filed with Medicare or to obtain access to the administrative process.\n21\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 22 of 45\nPlaintiffMary Patricia Boitano\n78. PlaintiffMary PatriciaBoitano is 83years old and lives in Rhode Island.\nShe was hospitalized from October 22,2010 through October 29,2010 for a\ngastrointestinal hemorrhage, anemia, and renal failure, which required dialysis two days\nper week. Prior to being hospitalized, she lived athome with her husband.\n79. On October 29,2010 she wastransferredto a skilled nursing facility,\nRoberts Health Centre. Medicare covered her staythere from October 29,2010 to\nNovember 22,2010.\n80. OnNovember 19,2010, her husband, George Boitano, received aNotice\nofNon-Coverage from her Part Cplan, United HealthCare, informing her that Medicare\ncoverage for her stay inthe SNF would end onNovember 22,2010. George Boitano\nappealed the decision to end Medicare coverage.\n81. OnNovember 22, 2010, upon the request for fast-track appeal, the\ncoverage denial was affirmed. The denial affirmation was based onthe determination\nthat \"[t]herapy services must ... be reasonable in relation to the expected improvement in\nyour condition.\"\n82. On January 13,2011, Ms. Boitano requested that the QIO reconsider its\ndecision.\n83. On or about November22,2010, Ms. Boitano was transferred byher\nfamily to a new SNF, West View Health Care Center. West View evaluated Ms. Boitano\nand determined that she required skilled nursing, physical therapy, occupationaltherapy\nand speech therapy.\n84.

PlaintiffNational Committee to Preserve Social Securityand Medicare\n(\"NCPSSM\" or \"the National Committee\") isanonpartisan, nonprofit nationwide\nmembership organization representing millions ofmembers and supporters nationwide.\n88. The mission oftheNCPSSM isto protect, preserve, promote, and ensure\nthe financial security, health, andwell-being ofcurrent andfuture generations of\nAmericans. A central focus ofthat mission isthe protection ofSocial Security and\nMedicare. Eliminating the Improvement Standard isan important aspect ofthat overall\ngoal.\n89. TheNCPSSM works through advocacy, education, services, grassroots\nefforts, and the leadership ofthe Board ofDirectors, its President and ChiefExecutive\nOfficer (presently, former Congresswoman Barbara B. Kennelly), and the organization's\nprofessional staff.\n90. NCPSSM's work is supported through annual membership dues and\ncontributions, andthrough petitions and letters signed by his members and supporters.

Some ofthe NCPSSM's members who\nare Medicare beneficiaries have had or are having the Improvement Standard applied to\nthem.\n91. Members ofthe National Committee would have standing to sue in their\nown right. The interests that theNational Committee seeks to protectin challengingthe\nImprovement Standard are germane to its purpose. Because this lawsuit seeks a legal\nruling in the form ofdeclaratory, injunctive and/or mandamus relief, rather than\nindividualized relieffor its members, the participation ofindividual members ofthe\nNational Committee is not required.\n92. Via certifiedmail on Sept. 23, 2010, counsel for plaintiffNational\nCommittee sent letters on its behalfto Defendant Sebelius and to Donald Berwick, the\nCMS Administrator. The identical letters informedthe defendantand the Administrator\nthat their applicationofthe Improvement Standard was in violationofthe Medicare\nstatute and regulations, ofthe Administrative Procedure Act and the Freedom of\nInformationAct, and ofthe Due Process Clause ofthe Fifth Amendment. The letters\nrequested that the defendant and the Administrator \"directthat the Improvement Standard\nno longer be employedto make coverage decisions and that appropriate steps betaken to\ncorrectits present and past application.\"\n93.

The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (MS Society) is a nationwide\norganizationwitha 50-state networkofchapters that works to eradicate multiple sclerosis\nby stopping disease progression and preventingthe disease in future generations, while\nrestoring function and providing and advocating for enhanced care and support for those\nalready affected by or living withthis chronic disease, including ensuringtheiraccess to\nquality health care, long-term care resources, and accessible, affordable insurance.\n95. The MS Society accomplishes this mission by supporting comprehensive\nand globally collaborative researchinto the underlying causes, understanding, potential\ntreatments, and ultimate preventionofmultiple sclerosis, and by providing information\nand resources, education, and support ofall kinds to people with multiple sclerosis and\ntheir families. This is accomplished in avariety ofways, includingnationally-managed\nprograms and locally-managed state programsthatprovide servicesto families:\ninformation and referrals, supportgroups, care consultation, research, and through\neducating and advocating with all appropriate agencies at the federal, state, and local\nlevels.\n96. In its effortto assistpeople with multiple sclerosis the MS Societyworks\nto ensurethat services and benefits are available from federal programsthatprovide\nassistance to those withchronic illness and disability. As part ofthe MS Society'S\ncommitmentto helping people affected by multiple sclerosis, the organization focuses on\nfour key programs: Medicare, Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (Part D ofMedicare),\nSocial Security disability, and Department ofVeterans Affairs benefits.\n97. In its work on Medicare, the MS Societyhas focused in particularon the\n25\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 26 of 45\nImprovement Standard as a critical factor inpreventing people with multiple sclerosis\nfrom obtaining the Medicare coverage and health services that they need. Consequently,\nthe MS Society assists people who have been denied orterminated from coverage\nbecause ofapplication ofthe Improvement Standard. It also has sought to convince CMS\nto end Medicare's reliance on the Improvement Standard.\n98. The MS Society isthe functional equivalent ofa membership\norganization, aspeople with multiple sclerosis and their families are represented by the\nMS Society and are able to express their views and to protect their collective interests\nthrough it. Its 48 chapters, which combined represent the entire United States, have\nmembers who vote, and members nationwide participate in identifying priority areas of\nneed as part ofthe organizational strategic planningprocess.\n99. Many ofthe individuals who act throughthe MS Society are Medicare\nbeneficiaries, and a large numberofthem have been harmed by the Improvement\nStandard.\n100. Individuals who actthrough the MS Society would have standing to sue in\ntheir own right. The interests that the MS Society seeks to protect in challengingthe\nImprovement Standard are germane to its purpose.

PAN also advocates on behalfofthose living with Parkinson's to ensure\nthatbenefits from federal programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, are properly\nmade available to those who are eligible. The Improvement Standard in Medicare, which\ndeprives Medicare beneficiaries, including those withParkinson's, ofcoverageto which\nthey are entitled, is an issue that PAN focuses on to improve the quality oflife for its\n27\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 28 of 45\nconstituents.\n106.

This expertise is employed to advocate for quality health care for its\nmembers, for research and education addressing spinal cord injury and dysfunction, for\nbenefits based on its members' military service, and for civil rights, accessibility, and\nopportunities that maximize its members' independence.\n113. PYA has almost 20,000 members, ofwhom over 6,200 are age 65 or over.\nAbouthalfofthe PVA membershiphas identified Social Securitybenefits, either for old \nage or disability, as their main source ofincome. About 10,500 members have non \nservice-connected chronic conditions, which allow them to enroll inthe Department of\nVeterans Affairs (VA) healthcare programonly as low prioritypatients, forcing a\nmajority ofthese to elect Medicare coverage, eitherin additionto in or instead ofVA\n29\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 30 of 45\nhealth care.\n114. Furthermore, PVA members who are service-connected and enrolled in\nthe VA health care program are free to enroll in Medicare as well and seek non-VA\nhealth care providers who accept Medicare assignment.\n115. Althoughthe exact number ofPVA members who are eligible for and\nreceiving Medicare coverage is not known, the information in the preceding paragraph\nindicates that thousands ofPVAmembers are eligible for and receiving Medicare.

In\nFebruary2008, the Alzheimer's Associationpublished a Public Policy Issue Brieftitled\nBarriers to Medicare Coverage for Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy and\nSpeech-Language PathologyServicesfor Individuals with Dementia. The authors\nspecifically recommend that CMS clarify its manuals sothat all therapies are available to\nbeneficiaries with dementia, when those benefits can maximize function or minimize\ndeteriorationin function. Since 2003, the Alzheimer's Associationhas participatedin\nmeetings with CMS to attemptto resolve the problem, but to no avail.\n129.

On December 7, 2010, Maurice McGill, Mrs. McGill's son, received oral\nnotice that Medicare coverage for Mrs. McGill's stay in the SNF would end on December\n10,2010. On December 7, 2010, Mrs. McGill's daughter, PatriciaMcGill, appealed the\ndecisionto end Medicare coverage.\n148. On December 9, 2010, the Quality Improvement Organizationupheld the\nnon-coverage determination and verbally notified Patricia McGill ofthe decision.\n149. On December 9,2010, PatriciaMcGill requested an expedited\nreconsideration ofthe QIO decision. On December 21,2010, PatriciaMcGill sent\nadditional documentation to Maximus, the Qualified Independent Contractor, to consider\nwhen rendering its decision. The additional documents consisted ofa personal statement\nand a physician's statement. The physician's statementrequested coverage for 60 days of\noccupational and physicaltherapy services. In making this request, Mrs. McGill's\nphysician statedthat \"it is my medical opinion beyond a reasonable degree ofmedical\ncertainty, that more therapy would be helpful. She needs more work in use ofher right\nupper extremity and in her transferring ability.\"\n150. On December 22, 2010, Maximus issued an unfavorable decision.

Plaintiffs suffer irreparable injury by reasonofdefendants' actions\ncomplained ofherein. Not only are they deprived ofMedicare coverage that iscrucial to\ntheir health and well-being, but they also effectively lose the right to challengethatdenial\nofcoverage.\n153. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. Only the declaratory,\ninjunctive, and mandamus reliefthat this Court can providewill fully redress the wrongs\ndone to plaintiffs.\n154. Plaintiffs have a clearrightto the reliefsought. There is no other adequate\nremedy available to correct an otherwise unreviewable defectnot related to a claim for\nbenefits. The defendant has a plainly defined and nondiscretionary duty to provide the\nreliefthatplaintiffs seek.\nVIII. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF THE MEDICARE\nSTATUTE ANDREGULATIONS\n155. Application ofthe Improvement Standardto deny coverageviolates the\nMedicare statute, and in particular its medical necessity requirement, 42 U.S.C. §\n1395y(a)(I)(A), its implementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. §§ 409.32(c), 409.44(b)(l),\n40\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 41 of 45\n409.44(a), 409.44(b)(3)(iii), and 409.44(c)(2)(iii), and the Medicare BenefitPolicy\nManual.\nIX. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF THE PROCEDURAL\nREQUIREMENTS OF THE MEDICARE STATUTE\n156. The Medicare statute prohibits the promulgation ofarule that \"establishes\nor changes a substantive legal standard governing the scope ofbenefits, the payment for\nservices, or the eligibility ofindividuals ... to ... receive services or benefits under this\nsubchapter ... unless it ispromulgatedby the Secretary\" through notice-and-comment\nrulemaking. 42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(a)(2). As arule applied to Medicare beneficiaries to\ndeny them coverage, the Improvement Standard violatesthis notice-and-comment\nrequirement ofthe Medicare statute, which renders the rule void and ofno force and\neffect.\nX. THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF THE\nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT\n157. The Administrative Procedure Act prohibits rulemaking without first\npublishing the rule in proposed form and allowing members ofthe public an opportunity\nto comment on the proposed rule. 5U.S.C. §553. As arule applied to Medicare\nbeneficiaries to deny them coverage, the Improvement Standard violates those notice-\nand-comment requirements ofthe Administrative Procedure Act, which renders the rule\nvoid and ofno force and effect.\nXI. FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF THE\nFREEDOM OF INFORMATIONACT\n158. The Freedom ofInformationAct requires publication in the Federal\nRegister \"ofsubstantiverules ofgeneral applicability adopted as authorized by law, and\nstatements ofgeneral policy or interpretations ofgeneral applicability formulated and\n41\n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 13   Filed 03/03/11   Page 42 of 45\nadopted by the agency.\" 5U.S.C. § 552(a)(I)(D). The Improvement Standard meets this\ncriterion, but it has not beenpublished in the Federal Register. Accordingly, itcannotbe\napplied, and the rule is void and ofno force and effect.\nXII. FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF THE DUE\nPROCESS CLAUSE\n159. The application ofan improper standard to deny coverage contraryto the\nMedicare Act and controllingregulations violates the Due Process Clause ofthe Fifth\nAmendment.\nXIII. SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF THE DUE\nPROCESS CLAUSE\n160. The application ofthe Improvement Standard primarily at levels ofreview\nbelowthe ALl level and with the pretensethat it is aproper condition ofcoverage has the\neffectofdiscouraging or preventing beneficiaries from seekingreview at which the\ncorrect standard would more likely be applied. Ittherefore acts to deprive beneficiaries\noftheir rightto review in violationofthe Due Process Clause ofthe Fifth Amendment.\nXIV.

See Doc. 106 (August 17, 2016 \nOpinion and Order GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART Plaintiffs' motion \nfor resolution of noncompliance with the Settlement Agreement) (the \"August 17, 2016 \nOpinion and Order\"); Jimmo v. Burwell, 2016 WL 4401371 (D. Vt. Aug. 17, 2016). \nPlaintiffs are represented by David J. Berger, Esq., Matthew R. Reed, Esq., the \nCenter for Medicare Advocacy, Inc., and Vermont Legal Aid, Inc.  The Secretary is \nrepresented by Assistant United States Attorney M. Andrew Zee, Assistant United States \nAttorney Steven Y. Bressler, and Special Assistant United States Attorney Tamra Moore. \nI.  Factual and Procedural Background. \nA.  The Jimmo Class Action. \nOn January 18, 2011, six individual Medicare beneficiaries (the \"Individual \nPlaintiffs\") and seven national organizations (the \"Organizational Plaintiffs\") \n(collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed a class action suit in the District of Vermont against the \nSecretary, alleging, among other things, that the Secretary \"impose[ d) a covert rule of \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 115   Filed 02/01/17   Page 2 of 11\nthumb that operate[ d] as an additional and illegal condition of coverage and result[ ed] in \nthe termination, reduction, or denial of coverage for thousands of Medicare beneficiaries \nannually.\"  (Doc. 13 at 2, ~ 1.)  Plaintiffs alleged this covert rule of thumb improperly \nimposed an \"improvement standard,\" whereby coverage for certain home health care \nservices was denied if a beneficiary's condition had not improved (the \"Improvement \nStandard\").  !d. at ~ 2.  Plaintiffs further alleged that because of the Improvement \nStandard, Medicare contractors and adjudicators were denying Medicare coverage merely \nbecause a patient was unlikely to improve, or in retrospect failed to improve, even when \nthe patient needed skilled care to maintain his or her condition or prevent or slow further \ndeterioration. \nThe Secretary moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims on a number of grounds, \nincluding that they failed to allege a plausible ground for relief.  The court granted the \nmotion to dismiss in part and denied it in part.  See Jimmo v. Sebelius, 2011 WL \n5104355, at* 1 (D. Vt. Oct. 25, 2011).  Thereafter, without admitting liability or any \nwrongdoing, the Secretary agreed to settle Plaintiffs' claims in accordance with the terms \nand conditions of the Settlement Agreement.  The court approved the Settlement \nAgreement at a January 24,2013 fairness hearing under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nB.  The Settlement Agreement. \nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to a \"maintenance \ncoverage standard\" which provides that \"[s ] killed nursing services would be covered \nwhere such skilled nursing services are necessary to maintain the patient's current \ncondition or prevent or slow further deterioration so long as the beneficiary requires \nskilled care for the services to be safely and effectively provided.\"  (Doc. 82-1 at 13, \n§ IX.7.a.) (the \"Maintenance Coverage Standard\").1 \n1 To receive Medicare benefits for home health care services, a beneficiary must be: (a) confined \nto the home; (b) under the care of a physician; (c) in need of skilled services; and (d) under a \nplan of care.  42 C.F.R. § 409.42(a)-(d).  \"Nothing in [the] Settlement Agreement modifies, \ncontracts, or expands the existing eligibility requirements for receiving Medicare coverage[.]\" \n(Doc. 82-1 at 9, § IX.2.) \n2 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 115   Filed 02/01/17   Page 3 of 11\nThe Settlement Agreement required the Secretary to make certain revisions to the \nMedicare Beneficiary Policy Manual (\"MBPM\") to reflect the Maintenance Coverage \nStandard.  In its August 17, 2016 Opinion and Order, the court concluded that the \nSecretary has fulfilled these obligations. \nThe Settlement Agreement also required the Secretary to \"engage in a nationwide \neducational campaign\" through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(\"CMS \"), and in this \"Educational Campaign,\" \"use written materials and interactive \nforums with providers and contractors, to communicate the [skilled nursing facility \n(\"SNF\")], home health, and [outpatient therary services (\"OPT\")] maintenance coverage \nstandards and the [inpatient rehabilitation facility] coverage standards[.]\"  (Doc. 82-1 at \n14, § IX.9.)  The Settlement Agreement provided that although Plaintiffs' counsel would \nbe consulted and could provide input, \"CMS shall retain final authority as to the ultimate \ncontent of the written educational materials\" and the \"PowerPoint slides\" used in the \nEducational Campaign.  Id. at 16-17, §§ IX.12, IX.14. \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the court will retain jurisdiction for \nthirty-six months after the conclusion of the Secretary's Educational Campaign to \n\"enforc[ e] the provisions of the Settlement Agreement in the event that one of the Parties \nclaims that there has been a breach of any of those provisions[.]\"  Id. at 6, § Vl.3. \nOn March 1, 2016, after complying with the Settlement Agreement's dispute \nresolution process, Plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement.  In \nsupport of their motion, Plaintiffs argued that the Secretary did not adequately disavow \nthe Improvement Standard or disseminate the Maintenance Coverage Standard and that \nthe Secretary's Educational Campaign was so confusing and inadequate that little had \nchanged as a result of the Jimmo settlement.  Among other things, Plaintiffs asked the \ncourt to require the Secretary \"to carry out additional educational activities to address the \ninaccuracies and inadequacies of the original [Educational] Campaign.\"  (Doc. 94-1 at \n25.) \nIn its August 17, 2016 Opinion and Order, the court granted in part and denied in \npart Plaintiffs' motion to enforce, holding that: \n3 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 115   Filed 02/01/17   Page 4 of 11\nthe Secretary failed to fulfill the letter and spirit of the Settlement \nAgreement with respect to at least one essential component of the \nEducational Campaign.  Plaintiffs have provided persuasive evidence that \nat least some of the information provided by the Secretary in the \nEducational Campaign was inaccurate, nonresponsive, and failed to reflect \nthe maintenance coverage standard. \n(Doc. 106 at 18.) \nThereafter, the parties negotiated extensively at arms-length and in good faith to \nreach an agreed upon corrective action plan.  When they were unable to reach a \nconsensus, each party submitted a proposed corrective action plan accompanied by a \nmemorandum explaining why the court should adopt the party's plan. \nC.  The Proposed Corrective Action Plans. \n1.  Plaintiffs' Proposed Corrective Action Plan: \n1.  Jimmo Webpage: CMS will develop and launch a webpage \ndedicated exclusively to the Jimmo Settlement and its implementation.  The \nwebpage would include, inter alia, a web portal to which questions could \nbe submitted for consideration by CMS and a section of Frequently Asked \nQuestions (F AQs ), which would be updated on a scheduled basis. \n2.  Written Statements about Jimmo: A clear statement about the \nchanges (not mere \"clarifications\") created by the Jimmo Settlement, \nincluding an explicit statement that the maintenance coverage standard is a \nchange in policy and practice for providers and adjudicators and an \nannouncement of a new \"Jimmo webpage,\" would be transmitted to \nstakeholders immediately after initiation of the webpage.  The same \nstatement would appear at the beginning of the webpage. \n3.  Oral Statements at Open Door Forums: A statement similar to that in \nNo.2 above would be read at the beginning of at least eight Open Door \nForums scheduled after the website was launched. \n4.  National Call: A new National Call for contractors and adjudicators \nwould be held. \n5.  New Trainings: New trainings would be held for the staffs of \nMedicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) and Medicare Advantage \nOrganizations (MAOs), for which plaintiffs' counsel would have the \nopportunity to review the training materials and to make suggestions about \nthem and to listen in on the training. \n6.  Additional Monitoring: Monitoring of the corrective action plan \nwould continue beyond January 2017 and would include in-person \n4 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 115   Filed 02/01/17   Page 5 of 11\nmeetings of counsel to review questions that have been raised and to \ndevelop appropriate new F AQs. \n(Doc. Ill at 6-7.) \n2.  The Secretary's Proposed Corrective Action Plan: \n1.  CMS will disavow the application of the so-called \"Improvement \nStandard\" as improper under Medicare policy for the SNF, HH, and OPT \nbenefits, while making clear that CMS has consistently denied the existence \nof such an \"Improvement Standard.\"  This disavowal would appear on the \nforthcoming Jimmo webpage and in the transmittal message notifYing \nstakeholders of the webpage. \n2.  CMS is willing, through counsel, to notifY Plaintiffs and the [c  ]ourt \nonce the Technical Direction Letter and Health Plan Management System \nmemorandum have been issued to, respectively, Medicare Administrative \nContractors (MACs) and Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs). \n3.  CMS will publish on its website cms.gov a new webpage dedicated \nto the Jimmo settlement.  The Jimmo webpage will, in one location, provide \naccess to public documents related to the settlement that have been \npreviously posted on the cms.gov website.  In addition, the Jimmo webpage \nwill direct providers and suppliers with questions regarding individual \nclaims to the appropriate MAC.  CMS will include at the top of the new \nJimmo webpage a message about the settlement.  This message will \nsummarize the clarifications to Medicare policy that CMS has issued as \npart of the settlement.  Once the Jimmo webpage is published, CMS will \nnotifY stakeholders of the webpage through existing communication \nchannels and advise stakeholders seeking information about the settlement \nto visit the webpage.  Before the new Jimmo webpage message is finalized, \nCMS will provide Plaintiffs' Counsel with a two-week period in which to \nprovide comments on an advance version of the message.  CMS will \nconsider any comments received from Plaintiffs' Counsel. \n4.  CMS will post on the forthcoming Jimmo webpage one set of \nFrequently Asked Questions (F AQs ).  This document would be developed \nby CMS and would include multiple questions and answers regarding the \npolicy clarification resulting from the Jimmo settlement.  CMS will provide \nPlaintiffs' Counsel with an opportunity to suggest potential questions for \ninclusion in the F AQ posting, which CMS will consider but would not be \nbound to accept. \n5.  CMS will include a message regarding the Jimmo settlement when it \nannounces the publication of the Jimmo webpage to providers, adjudicators, \ncontractors, and other stakeholders. \n5 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 115   Filed 02/01/17   Page 6 of 11\n6.  CMS will clarify the responses in the document entitled \"Summary \nof the questions posed and answers provided during the December 16, 20 13 \nJimmo vs. Sebelius National Call for contractors and adjudicators\" to \naddress the concerns identified by the [c]ourt in its August 17,2016 \nOpinion and Order.  CMS will disseminate the Clarified Summary to \ncontractors and adjudicators using the same communication channels as \nwere used for the original Summary.  CMS will make clear to contractors \nand adjudicators that the information contained in the Clarified Summary \nsupersedes the information contained in the original Summary.  Before the \nClarified Summary is finalized, CMS will provide Plaintiffs' Counsel with \na two-week period in which to provide comments on an advance version of \nthe Clarified Summary.  CMS will consider any comments received from \nPlaintiffs' Counsel but would not be bound to accept them. \n7.  CMS will issue a Technical Direction Letter to MACs directing \nthem to conduct, within a specified timeframe, additional training on the \nJimmo manual clarifications.  CMS would provide the MACs with \nmaterials for use in conducting this training. \n8.  CMS will issue a Health Plan Management System memorandum to \nMAOs requesting that they conduct, within a specified timeframe, \nadditional training on the Jimmo manual clarifications.  CMS would \nprovide the MACs with materials for use in conducting this training. \n9.  CMS will disavow the application of the so-called \"Improvement \nStandard\" as improper under Medicare policy for the SNF, HH, and OPT \nbenefits, while making clear that CMS has consistently denied the existence \nof such an \"Improvement Standard.\"  This disavowal would appear on the \nforthcoming Jimmo webpage and in the transmittal message notifying \nstakeholders of the webpage. \n10.  CMS is willing, through counsel, to notify Plaintiffs and the [c]ourt \nonce the Technical Direction Letter and Health Plan Management System \nmemorandum have been issued to, respectively, Medicare Administrative \nContractors (MACs) and Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs). \n(Doc. 112-1 at 3-4.) \nII.  Legal Analysis and Conclusions. \nThe court's authority to enforce the Settlement Agreement is not unlimited.  It \ncannot impose new obligations ~he parties have not bargained for, correct any disparity in \nbargaining power, or devise its own scheme for implementing the Jimmo settlement.  The \nSecretary has offered to undertake certain educational activities beyond those required by \nthe Settlement Agreement in order to correct the deficiencies the court found in the \n6 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 115   Filed 02/01/17   Page 7 of 11\nEducational Campaign.  Plaintiffs offer a more expansive list of educational activities and \nask the court to order that certain obligations be continuing in nature.  For example, \nPlaintiffs argue that CMS should be required to create a Jimmo webpage that is \n\"dynamic, not static, with [P]laintiffs participating in the creation ofFAQs and new \nF AQs as developments demand.  A web portal for questions should be added to the \nwebpage.\"  (Doc. 114 at 7.)  Plaintiffs were free to negotiate for this relief in the \nSettlement Agreement.  No reasonable interpretation of the Settlement Agreement could \nbe deemed to include it.  It is therefore beyond the court's authority to require it. \nPlaintiffs' suggestion that \"additional training should not be left to the Secretary \nfor her unilateral development; [P]laintiffs should be allowed to participate\" warrants a \nsimilar response.  !d.  The court does not have the authority to order the Secretary to \nallow Plaintiffs to participate in her training.  Provided the Secretary offers accurate \nguidance regarding the Maintenance Coverage Standard and affirmatively disavows the \nImprovement Standard, she retains the discretion to determine the content of the training \nshe has agreed to undertake. \nFinally, the court's jurisdiction over the Settlement Agreement does not extend to \nmonitoring of indeterminate duration.  It is therefore sufficient if the Secretary certifies \nthe completion with the relief ordered herein.  The court has considered each of \nPlaintiffs' remaining requests for corrective action and concludes that those requests \nrequire a different and more extensive Educational Campaign than the Settlement \nAgreement authorizes. \nFor the foregoing reasons, with the exceptions set forth, the court hereby ADOPTS \nthe Secretary's proposed corrective action plan and ORDERS its completion on or before \nSeptember 4, 2017.  The court hereby ORDERS the Secretary's corrective action plan to \nincluding the following two additional requirements. \nFirst, the parties agree that a statement disavowing the Improvement Standard and \nexplaining the Maintenance Coverage Standard is an essential component of any \ncorrective action plan.  They have, however, been unable to reach a consensus as to the \ncontent of this statement.  The Secretary's proposal that she draft a statement and then \n7 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 115   Filed 02/01/17   Page 8 of 11\nsolicit the non-binding comments of Plaintiffs' counsel is unlikely to resolve the parties' \ndispute as it merely replicates the negotiations that have prompted the current stalemate. \nSimply put, in light of the parties' dispute resolution history, the court finds little \nlikelihood that the parties will reach an agreement as to the content of the corrective \nstatement. \nPlaintiffs propose a statement that is generally accurate.  To date, Defendant has \nnot pointed to any aspect of Plaintiffs' proposed statement that is either inaccurate or \nmisleading.  Instead, Defendant asserts only that \"there is no need to include a subjective, \nhistory critique of allegedly 'erroneous' beliefs of certain providers, adjudicators, and \ncontractors\" and there is no need to \"stray from the terms of the [Settlement] Agreement \nto introduce such undefined concepts as 'equal coverage' for so-called 'improvement and \nmaintenance' care.\"  (Doc. 113 at 7-8.)  The court agrees with the latter contention and \ndisagrees with the former. \nThe concept of \"equal coverage\" may add an element of confusion without \nclarifying whether and when the Maintenance Coverage Standard applies.  It is therefore \nboth unnecessary and potentially confusing surplusage.  In contrast, the Secretary's \ndisavowal of the Improvement Standard should be part of any corrective statement. \nPlaintiffs' proposed statement reflects this disavowal in non-inflammatory terms that \naccurately reflect the confusion over the use of the Improvement Standard which gave \nrise to their lawsuit.  In their motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiffs \npersausively demonstrated that confusion over the Improvement Standard persists.  In \nsuch circumstances, an affirmative disavowal of the Improvement Standard in an accurate \nhistorical context is warranted. \nAccordingly, subject to Defendant's right to object within fourteen (14) days of \nthis Order, the court hereby ADOPTS IN PART Plaintiffs' proposed statement as \nfollows: \nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reminds the Medicare \ncommunity of the Jimmo Settlement Agreement (January 2014), which \nclarified that the Medicare program will pay for skilled nursing care and \nskilled rehabilitation services when a beneficiary needs skilled care in order \n8 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 115   Filed 02/01/17   Page 9 of 11\nto maintain function or to prevent or slow decline or deterioration (provided \nall other coverage criteria are met).  Specifically, the Jimmo Settlement \nadopted a \"maintenance coverage standard\" for both skilled nursing and \ntherapy services: \nSkilled nursing services would be covered where such skilled \nnursing services are necessary to maintain the patient's \ncurrent condition or prevent or slow further deterioration so \nlong as the beneficiary requires skilled care for the services to \nbe safely and effectively provided. \nSkilled therapy services are covered when an individualized \nassessment of the patient's clinical condition demonstrates \nthat the specialized judgment, knowledge, and skills of a \nqualified therapist (\"skilled care\") are necessary for the \nperformance of a safe and effective maintenance program. \nSuch a maintenance program to maintain the patient's current \ncondition or to prevent or slow further deterioration is \ncovered so long as the beneficiary requires skilled care for the \nsafe and effective performance of the program. \nThe Jimmo Settlement may reflect a change in practice for many providers, \nadjudicators, and contractors, who may have erroneously believed that the \nMedicare program pays for nursing and rehabilitation only when a \nbeneficiary is expected to improve.  The Settlement correctly implements \nthe Medicare program's regulations governing maintenance nursing and \nrehabilitation in skilled nursing facilities, home health services, and \noutpatient therapy (physical, occupational, and speech) and maintenance \nnursing and rehabilitation in inpatient rehabilitation hospitals for \nbeneficiaries who need the level of care that such hospitals provide.  These \nregulations are set forth in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual. \n(Doc. 111 at 8-9) (the \"Corrective Statement\").  The Corrective Statement shall be \nincluded on the Jimmo webpage, in the F AQs, and in the written materials and oral \nstatements the Secretary has agreed to disseminate as part of her corrective action plan. \nSecond, because the Secretary's \"Summary of the questions posed and answers \nprovided during the December 16, 2013 Jimmo vs. Sebelius National Call for contractors \nand adjudicators\" (the \"Summary\") (Doc. 94-15) gave rise to the court's determination \nthat the Settlement Agreement had been breached, the errors in the Summary must be \ncorrected.  The Secretary argues that a corrected Summary will suffice.  She further \nargues that, in light of the passage of time, a corrective national call will only increase \n9 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 115   Filed 02/01/17   Page 10 of 11\nconfusion.  Plaintiffs counter that because the Summary merely highlights the erroneous \ninformation provided in the December 16, 2013 national call, a new and accurate national \ncall should take place. \nA transcript of the national call was not provided to the court.  The court must \ntherefore proceed on the assumption that the Summary reflects certain erroneous and \nmisleading information provided by the Secretary in the national call.  Based on this \nassumption, the court agrees that a corrected Summary will not cure the deficiencies in \nthe national call.  The court therefore ORDERS that, after providing at least fourteen (14) \ndays' notice to Plaintiffs' counsel, the Secretary shall hold a national call in which the \nCorrective Statement is orally disseminated.  Nothing precludes the Secretary from \nincluding other subject matters in the national call.  Notice of the national call shall \ninclude the following statement: \"This call will include corrective action mandated by the \ncourt overseeing the Jimmo settlement, clarifying the rejection of an improvement \nstandard and explaining the maintenance coverage standard now included in the \nMedicare Beneficiary Policy Manual.\"  Such notice will alleviate any potential confusion \nregarding the purpose of the national call. \nIn all other respects, the court finds that the Secretary's corrective action plan will \ncure its breach of the Settlement Agreement and fulfill its remaining obligations for an \nEducational Campaign set forth therein. \n10 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 115   Filed 02/01/17   Page 11 of 11\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the court hereby ORDERS the Secretary to implement \nher corrective action plan with the two additional requirements: (1) the inclusion of the \nCorrective Statement; and (2) a national call that includes the Corrective Statement and \nthe notice required by the court.

As grounds for their motion to enforce, Plaintiffs \npoint to the Secretary's refusal to make certain revisions to the Medicare Benefit Policy \nManual (the \"MBPM\") and her allegedly deficient educational campaign designed to \nimplement the Settlement Agreement. \nThe Secretary opposes Plaintiffs' motion, asserting that the court lacks jurisdiction \nto adjudicate the pending motion because Plaintiffs' notices of noncompliance are not \ntimely.  In the alternative, if jurisdiction exists, the Secretary asserts that Plaintiffs fail to \nestablish a breach of the Settlement Agreement and their proposed remedial measures \nextend beyond the court's limited jurisdiction. \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 2 of 22\nThe court heard oral argument on May 26, 20 16, at which point it took the \npending motion under advisement.  Plaintiffs are represented by David J. Berger, Esq., \nMatthew R. Reed, Esq., the Center for Medicare Advocacy, Inc., and Vermont Legal Aid, \nInc.  The Secretary is represented by Assistant United States Attorney M. Andrew Zee, \nAssistant United States Attorney Steven Y. Bressler, and Special Assistant United States \nAttorney Tamra Moore. \nI.  Factual and Procedural Background. \nA.  The Jimmo Class Action. \nOn January 18, 2011, six individual Medicare beneficiaries (the \"Individual \nPlaintiffs\") and seven national organizations (the \"Organizational Plaintiffs\") \n(collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed a class action suit in the District of Vermont against the \nSecretary, alleging, among other things, that the Secretary \"impose[ d] a covert rule of \nthumb that operate[ d] as an additional and illegal condition of coverage and result[ing] in \nthe termination, reduction, or denial of coverage for thousands of Medicare beneficiaries \nannually.\"  (Doc. 13 at 2, ~ 1.)  Plaintiffs alleged this covert rule of thumb improperly \nimposed an \"Improvement Standard,\" whereby coverage for certain home health care \nservices was denied if a beneficiary's condition had not improved.  !d. at~ 2.  Plaintiffs \nfurther alleged that because of the Improvement Standard, Medicare contractors and \nadjudicators were denying Medicare coverage merely because a patient was unlikely to \nimprove, or in retrospect failed to improve, even when the patient needed skilled care to \nmaintain his or her condition or prevent or slow further deterioration. \nThe Secretary moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims on a number of grounds, \nincluding that they failed to allege a plausible ground for relief.  The court granted the \nmotion to dismiss in part and denied it in part.  See Jimmo v. Sebelius, 2011 WL \n* \n5104355, at  1 (D. Vt. Oct. 25, 2011 ).  Thereafter, without admitting liability or any \nwrongdoing, after several months of arms-length negotiations, the Secretary agreed to \nsettle Plaintiffs' claims in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Settlement \nAgreement.  The court approved the Settlement Agreement at a January 24, 2013 fairness \nhearing under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n2 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 3 of 22\nB.  The Settlement Agreement. \nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to a \"maintenance \ncoverage standard\" which provides that \"[s  ]killed nursing services would be covered \nwhere such skilled nursing services are necessary to maintain the patient's current \ncondition or prevent or slow further deterioration so long as the beneficiary requires \nskilled care for the services to be safely and effectively provided.\"  (Doc. 82-1 at 13, \n§ IX. 7 .a.) 1  The parties agreed to implement the maintenance coverage standard in two \nways that are relevant to Plaintiffs' pending motion to enforce. \nFirst, the Settlement Agreement required certain revisions to the MBPM in order \n\"to clarify the coverage standards for the skilled nursing facility (SNF), home health \n(HH), and outpatient therapy (OPT) benefits when a patient has no restoration or \nimprovement potential but when that patient needs skilled SNF, HH, or OPT services\" \nand to state that Medicare coverage \"does not tum on the presence or absence of an \nindividual's potential for improvement from the nursing care, but rather on the \nbeneficiary's need for skilled care.\" !d. at 8-9, 12, §§ IX.1, IX.7.  The Secretary further \nagreed to \"revise or eliminate any [MBPM] provisions ... that [the Secretary] determines \nare in conflict\" with the agreed-upon maintenance coverage standard for nursing services. \n!d. at 9, § IX.3. \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the Secretary: \nwill take any recommendations from Plaintiffs' Counsel under advisement \nand will make a good faith effort to utilize Plaintiffs' Counsel's reasonable \nrecommendations that are limited to the coverage standards as clarified in \nSections IX.6 through IX.8 and that are consistent with those coverage \nstandards as well as all other statutory and regulatory requirements. \n!d. at 10, § IX.4.  Under the Settlement Agreement, the Secretary \"retain[s] final \nauthority as to the ultimate content of [MBPM] provisions.\" !d. at 9, § IX.2. \n1 To receive Medicare benefits for home health care services, a beneficiary must be: (a) confined \nto the home; (b) under the care of a physician; (c) in need of skilled services; and (d) under a \nplan of care.  42 C.F.R. § 409.42(a)-(d).  \"Nothing in [the] Settlement Agreement modifies, \ncontracts, or expands the existing eligibility requirements for receiving Medicare coverage[.]\" \n(Doc. 82-1 at 9, § IX.2.) \n3 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 4 of 22\nSecond, the Settlement Agreement required the Secretary to engage in certain \neducational activities designed to implement the changes to the MBPM and to educate \nstakeholders regarding the maintenance coverage standard.  Specifically, the Settlement \nAgreement requires the Secretary to \"engage in a nationwide educational campaign\" \nthrough the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), and in this \n\"Educational Campaign,\" \"use written materials and interactive forums with providers \nand contractors, to communicate the SNF, home health, and OPT maintenance coverage \nstandards and the [inpatient rehabilitation facility] coverage standards[.]\"  Doc. 82-1 at \n14, § IX.9.  The Settlement Agreement provides that \"CMS shall retain final authority as \nto the ultimate content of the written educational materials\" and the \"PowerPoint slides\" \nused in the Educational Campaign.  Id at 16, § IX.12. \nThe Settlement Agreement states that: \nThe Parties recognize that Defendant's obligations are met under the \nSettlement Agreement once it has complied with the terms of this \nSettlement Agreement, and that Defendant is not guaranteeing to Plaintiffs \nthat certain results will be achieved once the steps set forth in this \nSettlement Agreement have been implemented. \nId at 23, § IX.18. \nThe Settlement Agreement further provides that the court will retain jurisdiction \nfor thirty-six months after the conclusion of the Educational Campaign to \"enforc[e ] the \nprovisions of the Settlement Agreement in the event that one of the Parties claims that \nthere has been a breach of any of those provisions[.]\"  Id at 6, § VI.3.  Under the \nSettlement Agreement, before an aggrieved party may file a motion with the court \nalleging noncompliance, it must follow the dispute resolution process described in § VIII \nof the Settlement Agreement.  The first step is to provide written notice detailing the \nalleged noncompliance, which must include: \n(a) a reference to all specific provisions of the Settlement Agreement that \nare involved; (b) a statement of the issue; (c) a statement ofthe remedial \naction sought by the Initiating Party; and (d) a brief statement of the \nspecific facts, circumstances, and any other arguments supporting the \nposition of the Initiating Party; and (e) ifthere is a good faith basis for \n4 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 5 of 22\nexpedited resolution, the circumstances that make expedited resolution \nappropriate, and the proposed date for a reasonable expedited response. \nDoc. 82-1 at 7, §VIII. I. Notice of noncompliance \"must be provided promptly.\" !d. \nUnder the Settlement Agreement, \"[n  ]otice that is not provided promptly because of a \nlack of diligence on the part of the Initiating Party shall not serve as a basis for the [c  ]ourt \nto exercise jurisdiction[.]\" !d.  In its Judgment, the court retained 'jurisdiction over this \nmatter for the limited purposes and time period set forth in Section VI of the [Settlement] \nAgreement.\"  (Doc. 92 at 2.) \nC.  The Parties' Efforts to Implement the Settlement Agreement. \nThe Secretary made substantial revisions to chapters seven and eight of the \nMBPM, although many of the revisions were unrelated to the maintenance coverage \nstandard or the Settlement Agreement and were instead made \"pursuant to CMS' s general \nauthority to provide guidance on Medicare policy and implementation.\"  (Doc. 94-5 at 2.) \nThe Secretary issued an article regarding the revised MBPM provisions, which was \ndisseminated to Medicare Administrative Contractors, Medicare Advantage \nOrganizations, Qualified Independent Contractors (\"QICs\"), Qualified Improvement \nOrganizations, the Chief Administrative Law Judge, the Chair of the Departmental \nAppeals Board, providers, suppliers, and others.  The article was also posted on CMS' s \nwebsite. \nThe Secretary issued a Health Plan Management System memorandum, a Program \nTransmittal, and a Transmittal of Policy Systems memorandum, about the revised MBPM \nprovisions and revised the relevant 1-800-MEDICARE customer service scripts to reflect \nthem.  The Secretary posted the Program Transmittal on CMS' s website. \nThe Secretary conducted five open door forums and two national conference calls \nfor the purpose of communicating the MBPM revisions and the maintenance coverage \nstandard.  The open door forums involved over 3,900 participants.  During the national \ncalls, the Secretary utilized a PowerP  oint presentation that was provided to Plaintiffs' \ncounsel in advance for comment and review.  The December 19, 20 13 national call was \none hour in length, and approximately 3,428 participants were on the call.  The Secretary \n5 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 6 of 22\nused CMS's regular communication channel and its website to provide notice that the \ncalls would take place and posted an audio recording and written transcript of the call on \nCMS's website.  The parties also discussed implementation of the Settlement Agreement \nduring biannual meetings that occurred in January 2014, September 2014, April2015, \nand September 20 15. \nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Secretary conducted a random \nsampling of 100 decisions by QICs to identify potential errors and found that fifty-six \nQIC decisions contained potential errors.  The Secretary then determined that twenty-one \nof the fifty-six decisions reflected actual errors, although not all ofthe identified errors \ninvolved the incorrect application of the maintenance coverage standard.  Another \nsampling identified thirty-two QIC decisions with potential errors, with four of those \nerrors involving the incorrect application of the maintenance coverage standard. \nSince publication ofthe MBPM revisions on December 6, 2013, Plaintiffs have \nrepeatedly raised concerns regarding the adequacy of the revisions to reflect the \nmaintenance coverage standard and the Secretary's allegedly deficient Educational \n2 \nCampaign. In conjunction with their concerns, Plaintiffs have submitted to the Secretary \nadditional proposed revisions to the MBPM, provided examples of alleged continued \napplication of an Improvement Standard to deny Medicare coverage, and have proposed \n2 For example, on January 10,2014, Plaintiffs raised the following concerns: \nWe have a couple of suggestions and requests that we think might improve the \nprocess. \nFirst, we were struck by the fact that the Ombudsman call will not include an \nopportunity for questions.  It's been apparent from the other calls that attendees \ndo have a lot of questions, and so we request that that opportunity be provided in \nthis instance as well.  If that is not possible, could an e-mail address be provided \nso that attendees could e-mail their questions after the call? \nSecond, in general, could CMS provide an e-mail address where anyone could \nsend a question about the relief and the process?  This would be part of the \nongoing \"education campaign\" (small caps).  Again, we believe that the questions \nthat have been generated on the calls demonstrate that such a need exists.  Those \nquestions and answers could then be used to develop F AQ postings that would \nalleviate some of the confusion. \n(Doc. 94-17 at 1.) \n6 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 7 of 22\nFrequently Asked Questions to be posted on CMS 's website.  The Secretary has \nresponded to most of Plaintiffs' proposals, but has not agreed to adopt the vast majority \nof them, contending they are either unnecessary or are not required by the Settlement \nAgreement. \nPlaintiffs, through counsel, also formed a Jimmo Implementation Council (the \n\"Council\"), a multi-disciplinary group of providers and advocates to monitor progress \nwith the implementation of the Settlement Agreement.  The Council conducted a survey \nof sixty interested providers, advocates, and other stakeholders, which revealed that \"46% \nwere not aware of the Education[al] Campaign provided by CMS and only 36% \nparticipated in the education efforts.\"  (Doc. 94-50 at 4.)  When asked about how the \nJimmo settlement could be best implemented, \"more education from CMS was most \nfrequently mentioned.\"  !d. \nIn an August 3, 2015 email, the Secretary, through counsel, stated that she had no \nnew information to report regarding additional outreach or education.  Three days later, \non August 6, 2015, Plaintiffs' counsel served the Secretary with two notices of \nnoncompliance: one addressing Plaintiffs' proposed MBPM revisions and the other \nidentifying alleged deficiencies in the Secretary's Educational Campaign.  On September \n25, 2015, the Secretary responded to the notices of noncompliance.  The parties then \nunsuccessfully attempted to resolve their differences.  On November 10, 2015, the \nSecretary advised Plaintiffs' counsel in an email that the Secretary would engage in no \nadditional educational activities. \nOn March 1, 2016, Plaintiffs filed their motion to enforce.  In support of their \nmotion, Plaintiffs submitted several coverage decisions which they contend demonstrate \nthe persistence of confusion over the maintenance coverage standard and application of \nan Improvement Standard.  They also submitted the declarations of certain stakeholders \nwho opine that the Secretary did not adequately disseminate the maintenance coverage \nstandard and conducted a confusing and inadequate Educational Campaign, and that little \nhas changed as a result of the Jimmo class action settlement.  As relief, Plaintiffs ask the \ncourt to require the Secretary \"to revise or eliminate the specific language in the MBPM \n7 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 8 of 22\nthat conflicts with the maintenance nursing coverage standard.\"  (Doc. 94-1 at 25.) \nPlaintiffs also request that the court require the Secretary \"to carry out additional \neducational activities to address the inaccuracies and inadequacies of the original \n[Educational] Campaign.\" !d. \nII.  Legal Analysis and Conclusions. \nA.  Whether the Court has Jurisdiction to Hear the Motion. \nAs a threshold issue, the Secretary contends that the court lacks jurisdiction to \nadjudicate the motion to enforce because Plaintiffs did not provide \"timely\" and \n\"prompt\" notice of alleged noncompliance as required by the Settlement Agreement.  The \nSecretary points out that the allegedly deficient MBPM revisions were completed on \nDecember 6, 2013 and the Educational Campaign was completed on January 23, 2014. \nShe asserts that Plaintiffs allowed over nineteen months to elapse before filing their \nnotices of noncompliance.  Plaintiffs counter that the record establishes they were \ndiligent in pursuing their concerns and attempting to resolve them with the Secretary \nbefore invoking this court's jurisdiction. \nBecause \"[f]ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction[,] [t]hey possess only \nthat power authorized by Constitution and statute, which is not to be expanded by judicial \ndecree[.]\"  Kokkonen v.  Guardian Life Ins. Co. ofA  m., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (internal \ncitations omitted).  For that reason, the court does not \"automatically retain jurisdiction to \nhear a motion to enforce a settlement agreement simply by virtue of having disposed of \nthe original case.\"  Hendrickson v.  United States, 791 F.3d 354, 358 (2d Cir. 2015) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  \"[T]o retain ancillary jurisdiction over enforcement \nof a settlement agreement ... a district court's order of dismissal must either ( 1) \nexpressly retain jurisdiction over the settlement agreement, or (2) incorporate the terms of \nthe settlement agreement in the order.\" !d. \nThe court retained jurisdiction for thirty-six months after the conclusion of the \nEducational Campaign to enforce the Settlement Agreement in the event that one of the \nparties claims that there has been a breach thereof.  The Settlement Agreement requires a \nparty seeking enforcement to do so in a timely manner.  Plaintiffs satisfy this standard. \n8 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 9 of 22\nThey raised their concerns regarding the Secretary's alleged breaches of the Settlement \nAgreement promptly after they occurred and repeatedly thereafter.  Consistent with the \nSettlement Agreement, Plaintiffs attempted to resolve their concerns with the Secretary \nuntil August 3, 2015, when the Secretary advised Plaintiffs through counsel that she had \nno new information with respect to additional outreach or education.  Three days later, \nPlaintiffs served two Notices ofNoncompliance.  On September 25, 2015, the Secretary \nresponded in writing to Plaintiffs' Notices of Noncompliance.  The parties engaged in \nnegotiations until November 10, 2015, when the Secretary informed Plaintiffs that no \nfurther action would be taken on the Notices ofNoncompliance.  Plaintiffs' motion to \nenforce was filed less than four months thereafter. \nBecause Plaintiffs provided the Secretary with prompt notice of the alleged \nnoncompliance with the Settlement Agreement, diligently pursued their concerns, and \nserved their notices of noncompliance in a timely manner, the court retains jurisdiction to \nresolve the pending motion to enforce. \nB.  Standard of Review for Motion to Enforce. \n\"[A] motion to enforce a settlement agreement is fundamentally 'a claim for \nbreach of contract, part of the consideration of which was dismissal of an earlier federal \nsuit[.]\"' !d. (quoting Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 381).  In tum, \"[s]ettlement agreements are \ncontracts and must therefore be construed according to general principles of contract \nlaw.\"  Red Ball Interior Demolition Corp. v. Palmadessa, 173 F.3d 481, 484 (2d Cir. \n1999).  If a settlement agreement is clear and unambiguous, the court \"must take care not \nto alter or go beyond the express terms of the agreement, or to impose obligations on the \nparties that are not mandated by the unambiguous terms of the agreement itself.\" !d.; see \nalso Cruden v. Bank ofN. Y, 957 F.2d 961, 976 (2d Cir. 1992) (\"A court may neither \nrewrite, under the guise of interpretation, a term of the contract when the term is clear and \nunambiguous, nor redraft a contract to accord with its instinct for the dispensation of \nequity upon the facts of a given case\") (internal citation omitted). \nBecause the federal government is one of the contracting parties, the Settlement \nAgreement is \"governed exclusively by federal [common] law.\"  Boyle v.  United Techs. \n9 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 10 of 22\nCorp., 487 U.S. 500, 504 (1988).  Federal common law \"generally adopts the relevant \nstate law rule unless there is a significant conflict between the state rule and a federal \ninterest.\"  Palmieri v. Allstate Ins.  Co., 445 F.3d 179, 188-89 (2d Cir. 2006).  In this case, \nthere is no apparent conflict with state law. \nPursuant to Vermont law, courts \"look to the plain language of a contract to \ndiscern the intent ofthe parties.\"  In re Cole, 2008 VT 58, ,-r 13, 184 Vt. 64, 71, 954 A.2d \n1307, 1311; see also Bixler v. Bullard, 769 A.2d 690, 695 (Vt. 2001) (\"[T]he language \nand acts of a party to a contract are to receive such construction as the other party was \nfairly justified in giving to them\").  In every contract governed by Vermont law, there is \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing which is \"not a contractual term that the \nparties are free to bargain in or out [of] as they see fit.\"  Carmichael v. Adirondack \nBottled Gas Corp. ofVt., 635 A.2d 1211, 1216 (Vt. 1993).  The Vermont Supreme Court \nhas described the implied covenant as follows: \nThe definition of the \"covenant of good faith and fair dealing\" is broad.  An \nunderlying principle implied in every contract is that each party promises \nnot to do anything to undermine to destroy the other's rights to receive the \nbenefits of the agreement.  The implied covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing exists to ensure that parties to a contract act with \"faithfulness to an \nagreed common purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of \nthe other party.\"  ... The implied promise by its nature protects against \"a \nvariety of types of conduct characterized as involving 'bad faith' because \nthey violate community standards of decency, fairness or reasonableness.\" \nAs the Restatement [(Second) of Contracts] points out, \n[a] complete catalogue oftypes ofbad faith is impossible, but \nthe following types are among those which have been \nrecognized in judicial decisions: evasion of the spirit of the \nbargain, lack of diligence and slacking off, willful rendering \nof imperfect performance, abuse of a power to specify terms, \nand interference with or failure to cooperate in the other \nparty's performance. \n!d. at 1216-17 (internal citations omitted). \nIn their pending motion, Plaintiffs seek enforcement of the Secretary's obligation \nto revise the MBPM and to conduct the Educational Campaign.  Although Plaintiffs \nacknowledge that the Secretary has completed both of these obligations, they contend \n10 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 11 of 22\nthat she has evaded the spirit of the Settlement Agreement in doing so and has thereby \ndeprived them of the benefit of their bargain.  The Secretary argues that Plaintiffs cannot \nestablish a breach based on obligations not contained in the Settlement Agreement or \nmerely because they are dissatisfied with the results of their agreement. \nC.  Whether the MBPM Revisions Violate the Settlement Agreement. \nPlaintiffs concede that the Secretary made substantial changes to Chapters 7 and 8 \nof the MBPM, but claim that most of the changes either did not pertain to the \nmaintenance coverage standard or did not clarify sections that arguably gave rise to the \nImprovement Standard.  They further argue that the Secretary failed to make a good faith \neffort to implement Plaintiffs' recommendations to revise the MBPM as required by the \nSettlement Agreement.  Plaintiffs assert that while the Secretary added the maintenance \ncoverage standard to the general principles set forth in MBPM, she \"did not revise or \nclarify any of the specific sections that govern coverage requirements for skilled nursing \nservices to provide for maintenance nursing, [MBPM] 40.1.2.1 through [MBPM] \n40.1.2.14.\"  (Doc. 94 at 2.)  The Secretary does not deny that she made no specific \nrevisions to these sections of the MBPM to reflect the maintenance coverage standard. \nShe contends she had no obligation to do so in the absence of a direct conflict with the \nmaintenance coverage standard and, even in that instance, the Settlement Agreement left \nit to her discretion as to what, if any, revisions should be made.  Two provisions of the \nMBPM are the subject of the pending motion to enforce. \n1.  MBPM § 40.1.2.1 and the \"Three Week Rule.\" \nFirst, Plaintiffs cite the Secretary's refusal to eliminate a reference to a \"3 week \nrule\" in MBPM § 40.1.2.1 governing skilled observation and assessment.  This section \nprovides: \nWhere a patient was admitted to home health care for skilled observation \nbecause there was a reasonable potential of a complication or further acute \nepisode, but did not develop a further acute episode or complication, the \nskilled observation services are still covered for 3 weeks or so long as there \nremains a reasonable potential for such a complication or further acute \nepisode. \n11 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 12 of 22\n!d.; MBPM, Ch. 7 § 40.1.2.1.  Plaintiffs argue that there is no statutory support for the \"3 \nweek rule,\"3 and that it falsely suggests that skilled observation services are limited to \nthat time period unless the patient is at risk for future complications.  They assert this \nlanguage conflicts with the maintenance coverage standard which does not contain a \nthree week limitation.  They further contend that the \"3 week rule\" imposes an \nimpermissible \"rule of thumb\" that the Settlement Agreement was intended to eliminate. \nThe Secretary responds that because the \"3 week rule\" is only one measure and \nbecause MBPM § 40.1.2.1 also provides that skilled observations will be covered \"so \nlong as there remains a reasonable potential for such a complication or further acute \nepisode[,]\" there is no direct conflict with the maintenance coverage standard.  !d. \nMBPM § 40.1.2.1 neither refers to the maintenance coverage standard nor \nincorporates it.  As a result, it can reasonably be interpreted as endorsing standards for \ndetermining coverage for skilled observation and assessment other than the maintenance \ncoverage standard.  None of this is surprising because MBPM § 40.1.2.1 predates the \nparties' Settlement Agreement and the Secretary has refused to revise it.  In an effort to \nimplement the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement, the Secretary could \nhave clarified how the maintenance coverage standard applies to MBPM § 40.1.2.1 and \nhow it modifies the \"3 week rule.\"  It is a much closer question, however, whether the \nSecretary breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to make those revisions. \nBecause coverage for skilled nursing services can comply with both the \nmaintenance coverage standard and § 40.1.2.1, there is no direct conflict between the two \nstandards and they can be read in tandem.  See F.C.C. v. NextWave Pers. Commc'ns Inc., \n537 U.S. 293, 304 (2003) (\"[W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty \nof the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard \neach as effective\") (internal quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, although the \"3 week \nrule\" appears to have no basis in the applicable regulations or law, it is modified by \n§ 40.1.2.1 's further provision that coverage remains available \"so long as there remains a \n3 At oral argument, the only statutory or regulatory support the Secretary cited for the \"3 week \nrule\" pertained to an unrelated issue. \n12 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 13 of 22\nreasonable potential for ... a complication or further acute episode.\"  As a result, while \nthe \"3 week rule\" has the potential to become an impermissible rule of thumb, this \noutcome is not certain.  She further contends she never agreed to eliminate \"rules of \n4 \nthumb\" from the MBPM.\nAlthough the Secretary's refusal to revise§ 40.1.2.1 to reflect the maintenance \ncoverage standard is likely to cause confusion, in the absence of a direct conflict between \nthe two provisions, the Settlement Agreement permits her to refrain from certain \nclarifying revisions and authorizes no recourse if she decides not to make them.  The \ncourt is not empowered to revise the parties' agreement to impose a more onerous burden \neven if it would enhance the implementation ofthe maintenance coverage standard.  See \nGreenlaw v.  United States, 554 U.S. 237, 243-44 (2008) (describing \"the principle of \nparty presentation\" whereby \"as a general rule, our adversary system is designed around \nthe premise that the parties ... are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments \nentitling them to relief') (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). \nBecause there is no direct conflict between the cited provision of§ 40.1.2.1 and \nthe maintenance coverage standard, the court must DENY Plaintiffs' motion to enforce \ninsofar as it pertains to the skilled observation and assessment provision of MBPM \n§ 40.1.2.1. \n2.  MBPM § 40.1.2.1 and the Maintenance Coverage Standard. \nPlaintiffs also challenge a portion ofMBPM § 40.1.2.1 that states: \n4 As the Secretary correctly points out, the Settlement Agreement does not prohibit rules of \nthumb or require her to eliminate them from the MBPM.  However, the Secretary arguably has \nan independent duty to remove impermissible rules of thumb from the MBPM.  See 42 C.F.R. \n§ 409.44(a) (explaining that, under the home health benefit, Medicare coverage of skilled \nservices is based on the \"unique medical condition of the individual beneficiary\"); MBPM, Ch. \n7, § 20.3 (prohibiting the use of utilization screens or '\"rules of thumb'\" to make coverage \ndecisions); 42 C.F.R. § 409.44(b)(3)(iii) (providing that the determination ofwhether a skilled \nservice is reasonable and necessary \"must be based solely upon the beneficiary's unique \ncondition and individual needs, without regard to whether the illness or injury is acute, chronic, \nterminal, or expected to last a long time\"); Home Health Prospective Payment System Rate \nUpdate for Calendar Year 2011, 75 Fed. Reg. 70372, 70395 (Nov. 17, 2010) (\"'Rules ofthumb' \nin the Medicare medical review process are prohibited .... Medical denial decisions must be \nbased on a detailed and thorough analysis of the beneficiary's total condition and individual need \nfor care.\"). \n13 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 14 of 22\nSuch signs and symptoms as abnormal/fluctuating vital signs, weight \nchanges, edema, symptoms of drug toxicity, abnormal/fluctuating lab \nvalues, and respiratory changes on auscultation may justify skilled \nobservation and assessment.  Where these signs and symptoms are such that \nthere is a reasonable potential that skilled observation and assessment by a \nlicensed nurse will result in changes to the treatment of the patient, then the \nservices would be covered.  However, observation and assessment by a \nnurse is not reasonable and necessary for the treatment oft he illness or \ninjury where fluctuating signs and symptoms are part ofa  longstanding \npattern of the patient's condition which has not previously required a \nchange in the prescribed treatment. \n(Doc. 94-8); MBPM, Ch. 7 § 40.1.2.1 (emphasis supplied). \nPlaintiffs argue that the Settlement Agreement requires MBPM § 40.1.2.1 to be \nrevised to clarify that, based on the maintenance coverage standard, it does not preclude \nobservation and assessment \"to address a long standing pattern of their condition, \nparticularly when their treatment plan does not require changes to meet their needs or \nmaintain their condition[.]\"  (Doc. 94 at 2-3.)  As currently drafted, Plaintiffs contend \n§ 40.1.2.1 erroneously suggests that the need for skilled care requires an acute episode \nand thus is \"always episodic, temporary, [and] short-term.\"  (Doc. 94-6 at 2.)  Plaintiffs \nfurther argue that the section fails to reflect that a patient may obtain covered skilled \nnursing observation and assessment to maintain or prevent deterioration of his or her \ncondition. \nThe Secretary responds that the challenged provision accurately indicates that \nwhen a patient's fluctuating signs and symptoms are part of a long standing pattern that \nremains unchanged, skilled observation and assessment services will not be reasonable \nand necessary, and that CMS's regulation governs when observation and assessment \n5 \nconstitute skilled services.  See 42 C.P.R. § 409.33(a)(2)(i). She points out that \"CMS \n5 42 C.F.R. § 409.33(a)(2)(i) states: \nObservation and assessment of the patient's changing condition-(i) When \nobservation and assessment constitute skilled services.  Observation and \nassessment constitute skilled services when the skills of a technical or \nprofessional person are required to identify and evaluate the patient's need for \nmodification of treatment or for additional medical procedures until his or her \ncondition is stabilized. \n14 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 15 of 22\ndid not agree to 'eliminate' the so-called 'Improvement Standard,' nor did it promise that \nthe measures set forth in the [Settlement] Agreement would eliminate it.\"  (Doc. 102 at \n3.)  Indeed, she denies that the Improvement Standard exists.6 \nAlthough not a model of clarity, § 40.1.2.1 neither expressly contains an \nImprovement Standard nor negates the application of the maintenance coverage standard. \nAs a result, the Secretary did not violate the Settlement Agreement by refusing to revise \nthis provision of the MBPM. \nFinally, while Plaintiffs point to the Secretary's alleged repeated failure to clarify \nthe application of the maintenance coverage standard in the MBPM, the Settlement \nAgreement required only that the Secretary take Plaintiffs' recommendations for MBPM \nrevisions \"under advisement\" and make a \"good faith effort to utilize\" them.  (Doc. 82-1 \nat 10, § IX.4.)  The Secretary has proffered sufficient evidence that she fulfilled this duty, \nand Plaintiffs make no colorable claim of bad faith.  The court therefore DENIES \nPlaintiffs' motion to enforce insofar as it pertains to revisions to the MBPM. \n3.  The Educational Campaign. \nPlaintiffs allege that although the Secretary \"checked off all the boxes set out in \nthe Educational Campaign portion of the [Settlement] Agreement\" (Doc. 103 at 4), she \ndid not make a good faith effort to carry out the Educational Campaign with respect to \nboth the MBPM revisions and the maintenance coverage standard.  Plaintiffs also point to \n6 While it is true that the Settlement Agreement contains no concessions by the Secretary \nregarding the existence of the Improvement Standard, the Secretary agreed to a maintenance \ncoverage standard which renders the use of an Improvement Standard to deny coverage \nimpermissible.  Under§ IX.7 ofthe Settlement Agreement, the maintenance coverage standard \nfor nursing services \"does not turn on the presence or absence of an individual's potential for \nimprovement from the nursing care, but rather on the beneficiary's need for skilled care.\"  (Doc. \n82-1 at 12) (emphasis supplied).  Section IX.1 defines the \"maintenance coverage standard as the \ncoverage standard \"when a patient has no restoration or improvement potential but when the \npatient needs skilled [services]\" and provides that \"[s]killed nursing services would be covered \nwhere such skilled nursing services are necessary to maintain the patient's current condition or \nprevent or slow further deterioration\" even if the patient is unlikely to improve \"so long as the \nbeneficiary requires skilled care for the services to be safely and effectively provided.\" !d. at 9, \n13 (emphasis supplied).  An Improvement Standard, when used as a rule of thumb, is clearly \nimpermissible.  See supra note 4, at 12-13. \n15 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 16 of 22\na number of specific alleged deficiencies in the manner in which the Secretary conducted \nthe Educational Campaign. \nFor example, Plaintiffs point out that they did not have the opportunity to \nadequately comment on the Secretary's PowerPoint presentation because the MBPM \nrevisions were not published until December 6, 2013.  During the national call, the \nSecretary briefed the PowerPoint presentation, and then took questions from eighteen \nparticipants before terminating the call.  Plaintiffs assert that when the Secretary \nterminated the call there were many participants waiting to ask questions about the \nSettlement Agreement and revisions to the MBPM.  Plaintiffs point out that the \nOmbudsman call did not include any opportunity for questions, and that when they asked \nthe Secretary to schedule another call, she refused this request.  They suggested that the \nSecretary provide an email address for questions and post Frequently Asked Questions \nregarding the Jimmo settlement on CMS's website.  Those requests were also denied. \nWith respect to the national calls, Plaintiffs contend that the Secretary did not \neffectively communicate about the calls in advance to give interested parties effective \nnotice.  The Settlement Agreement, however, only required the Secretary to \"make a \ngood faith effort to notify Plaintiffs' Lead Counsel, in advance of the National Calls[.]\" \n(Doc. 82-1 at 19, § IX.15.)  It is undisputed that the Secretary notified Plaintiffs' counsel \nabout the calls, and provided a copy of the PowerPoint presentation utilized during the \ncalls three weeks before the calls took place.  Although not required to by the Settlement \nAgreement, the Secretary also noticed Medicare providers and suppliers about the \nnational calls through her regular communications channel.  These efforts were sufficient \nto comply with the Settlement Agreement. \nPlaintiffs similarly claim that Open Door Forums (\"ODFs\") conducted by the \nSecretary pursuant to the Settlement Agreement were \"problematic\" because the \nSecretary \"did not allow questions\" and the publicity surrounding the ODFs \"often failed \nto connect.\"  (Doc. 94-1 at 11.)  However, the Settlement Agreement did not require the \nSecretary to publicize the ODFs or ensure that the ODFs \"connected\" with their audience. \nIt required only that the Secretary announce the manual revisions and reference the \n16 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 17 of 22\nnational calls during an ODF.  As the Secretary points out, she announced each ODF \nthrough targeted email, and each ODF had hundreds of participants. \nPlaintiffs submit declarations from stakeholders averring that the Secretary's \ntraining regarding the maintenance coverage standard was both minimal and inadequate, \nthat there was no follow-up, and that CMS has made little effort to address the confusion \nin the Medicare community regarding the import of the Jimmo settlement.  Plaintiffs \nargue that there remains substantial confusion among Medicare providers, suppliers, \ncontractors, adjudicators, and beneficiaries with respect to the maintenance coverage \nstandard.  In support of this claim, Plaintiffs cite the results of a random sampling ofQIC \ncoverage decisions which they contend demonstrate an unreasonably high error rate. \nThey also rely on a number of individual adverse coverage decisions which they assert \ndemonstrate that the Improvement Standard persists. 7 \nFinally, Plaintiffs submit several declarations, including one from a retired \nadministrative law judge from the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals who avers \nthat after the Jimmo settlement, the Improvement Standard continued to be reflected in \nthe decisions appealed to him, and that the Secretary has \"paid only lip service\" to the \ncourt's Judgment and has \"not effectively implemented the letter or the spirit of the \nJimmo settlement.\"  (Doc. 94-1 at 14.) \nPlaintiffs acknowledge that the Secretary did not guarantee results or the absence \nof mistakes, but contend that the evidence supports a conclusion that the Secretary's \nEducational Campaign was flawed to such an extent that it deprived them of the benefit \nof their bargain because ''the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the word did not get \nout\" regarding the maintenance coverage standards.  !d. at 11.  Plaintiffs propose that the \n7 In support of this contention, Plaintiffs cite thirty-nine individual adverse decisions in which \nthe Secretary allegedly \"failed to take the patient's unique condition into consideration or to \nrecognize that the services were needed to maintain the beneficiary's condition or to slow \ndeterioration.\"  !d. at 17.  In some ofthe cases cited by Plaintiffs, Medicare providers stated that \nthey had not heard of the Jimmo Settlement Agreement or the maintenance coverage standard. \n17 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 18 of 22\nSecretary be required to take additional steps to ensure that the Settlement Agreement has \n8 \nits intended effect. !d. at 25. \nIn response, the Secretary sets forth in some detail the efforts she undertook to \ndisseminate the maintenance coverage standard.  She argues that what Plaintiffs actually \nseek is results and that, under the Settlement Agreement, she did not guarantee \"that \ncertain results [would] be achieved[.]\"  (Doc. 82-1 at 23, § IX.18.)  Consequently, she \nasserts that adverse coverage decisions in which Medicare providers incorrectly deny \ncoverage to beneficiaries based on the alleged \"Improvement Standard\" do not constitute \na breach of the Settlement Agreement and, in any event, it is within her discretion to \naddress when and how to address noncompliance.  See id. at 22, § IX.22.e.2 (\"The \nmanner in which CMS addresses [noncompliance issues] will be within its discretion.\"). \nThe Secretary notes that beneficiaries who are incorrectly denied coverage may appeal \nthose decisions through the administrative process. \nBecause it is undisputed that the Secretary completed each component of the \nEducational Campaign, the only issue is whether the manner in which she conducted the \ncampaign constitutes a breach of the Settlement Agreement.  Although a close question, \nPlaintiffs have sustained their burden to establish that the Secretary failed to fulfill the \nletter and spirit of the Settlement Agreement with respect to at least one essential \ncomponent of the Educational Campaign. \nPlaintiffs have provided persuasive evidence that at least some of the information \nprovided by the Secretary in the Educational Campaign was inaccurate, nonresponsive, \nand failed to reflect the maintenance coverage standard.  The most compelling example \nof this is the Secretary's \"Summary of the questions posed and answers provided during \n8 Plaintiffs suggest addressing the alleged inadequacies of the Educational Campaign with: \n1) Frequently Asked Questions, drafted by [P]laintiffs' counsel and edited by \nCMS, posted on CMS'[s] website, and updated no less than semi-annually[;] \n2) National Calls for providers and suppliers, and for contractors and \nadjudicators; [and] \n3) A dedicated e-mail address for providers to pose questions directly to CMS. \n(Doc. 94-1 at 26.) \n18 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 19 of 22\nthe December 16, 2013 Jimmo vs. Sebelius National Call for contractors and \nadjudicators\" (the \"Summary\") (Doc. 94-15).  The Summary does not mention the \nmaintenance coverage standard, does not provide the parties' agreed upon definition of it, \nand reflects virtually no effort to educate participants regarding the impact of the Jimmo \nsettlement and the implementation of the maintenance coverage standard.  Examples of \nits deficiencies are set forth below. \na.  The Summary: Non-responsive answers. \nWhen asked by contractors \"how to distinguish claims where the goal is \nrestorative from claims where the goal is maintaining or preventing decline in [the \npatient's] condition[,]\" the Secretary did not answer this question and explain how the \ndistinction should be drawn.  Instead, she responded: \"CMS believes that treatment goals \nshould be clearly articulated in the patient's medical record.  Goals should be established \nclearly from the beginning, in terms of maintenance or restoration.  If clinical conditions \nchange, treatment goals may change.\" !d. at 3. \nWhen asked whether a patient can \"now qualify for maintenance therapy for life \nassuming that therapy is necessary to prevent or slow deterioration[,]\" the Secretary did \nnot answer this question in the affirmative or negative, but instead stated that \"[n  ]one of \nthe existing requirements or limitations of coverage have changed.\" !d. (emphasis \nomitted). \nWhen asked \"[w   ]hen and how will the review of past claims be conducted[,]\" the \nSecretary responded: \"That aspect of the settlement agreement is relatively clear in the \nagreement language itself.  CMS hasn't set up [a] formal timeline.  The settlement \nagreement lays out biannual meetings at which the plaintiffs will bring additional \nclaims.\" !d. (emphasis omitted). \nWhen asked for guidance for determining when maintenance services would be \ncovered for a patient that \"continues to deteriorate,\" the Secretary advised contractors to \nconduct \"a thorough review of the clinical record as a whole\" to determine \"when such a \nreview does not support the need for skilled care.\" !d. at 2 (emphasis omitted).  She did \nnot direct them to the maintenance coverage standard which clearly provides that: \n19 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 20 of 22\n\"Skilled nursing services would be covered where such skilled nursing services are \nnecessary to maintain the patient's current condition or prevent or slow further \ndeterioration so long as the beneficiary requires skilled care for the services to be safely \nand effectively provided.\"  (Doc. 82-1 at 13, § IX.7.a.) \nb.  The Summary: Incorrect Information. \nThe Summary also reflects the provision of arguably incorrect information.  When \nasked by contractors for \"some examples from the settlement of where a claim was \ndenied inappropriately[,]\" and \"what sort of language would be appropriate for them to \nuse when denying claims[,]\" the Secretary replied as follows: \nAs stated at the beginning of my presentation, the court has not decided this \ncase and actual claims review of cases will not begin until the second phase \nof the settlement agreement.  As far as inappropriate examples, in some \ninstances, contractor denials have used certain terms such as \"no \nimprovement potential,\" \"patient plateaued\"-which can serve as shorthand \njustifications for denying.  The basis for denial should be that the \nbeneficiary did not need skilled care.  Make sure that you are not using \ninaccurate, shorthand terms when writing denial language-use appropriate \nlanguage to describe the reason for denial (e.g., no longer need for skilled \ncare, patient not complicated/treatment not complicated). \n(Doc. 94-15 at 3.)  The problem with the Secretary's response is threefold. \nFirst, the Secretary's response may erroneously suggest that she is unaware of any \nclaims raised in the Jimmo settlement of improper denials based on an Improvement \nStandard.  See Anderson v. Sebelius, 2010 WL 4273238, at *8 (D. Vt. Oct. 25, 2010) \n(rejecting the use of an Improvement Standard and requiring the Secretary \"to reexamine \nthe need for skilled services for observation and assessment from the perspective of the \ncondition of Plaintiff at the time the services were ordered, free from any presumption \nthat if hindsight reveals Plaintiffs condition was stable throughout the covered period, \ncoverage for skilled services should be denied\"); Papciak v. Sebelius, 742 F. Supp. 2d \n765, 770 (W.D. Pa. 2010) (granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment where \"the \nquestion of whether services were necessary for a maintenance program was not \nconsidered by the Secretary, and thus the Secretary failed to apply the proper legal \nstandard\"); Rizzi v. Shalala, 1994 WL 686630, at *5 (D. Conn. Sept. 29, 1994) (opining \n20 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 21 of 22\nthat \"the revised guidelines prohibit any arbitrary presumptions or use of illegal 'rules of \nthumb' to deny patients with chronic or stable illnesses home health coverage\"); Folland \nv. Sullivan, 1992 WL 295230, at *7 (D. Vt. Sept. 1, 1992) (concluding the \"ALJ's \ninterpretation of[claimant's] condition [was] flawed because it impermissibly relies on \nthe benefit of hindsight, which of course is always 20-20\" and \"[t]he fact that skilled care \nhas stabilized a claimant's health does not render that level of care unnecessary.  An \nelderly claimant need not risk a deterioration of [his or] her fragile health to validate the \ncontinuing requirement for skilled care\"); Fox v. Bowen, 656 F. Supp. 1236, 1248 (D. \nConn. 1986) (\"It is clearly contrary to [Social Security] regulations for an [A  LJ] to deny \nbenefits on the basis of informal presumptions, or 'rules of thumb,' that are applied \nacross the board without regard to the medical condition or therapeutic requirements of \nthe individual patient\"). \nSecond, the Secretary juxtaposed \"inappropriate examples\" of the Improvement \nStandard with a statement that the inappropriate terms can serve as shorthand \njustifications for denying claims when she apparently intended to indicate that they \ncannot be used for this purpose. \nAnd third, rather than explain that an Improvement Standard is impermissible and \nthe maintenance coverage standard applies, the Secretary offered \"denial language\" that \ncan be used to avoid \"inaccurate, shorthand terms[.]\"  (Doc 94-15 at 3.)  Her explanation \nthat \"[t]he basis for denial should be that the beneficiary did not need skilled care\" is \naccurate, but she does not explain how this determination should be made consistent with \nthe maintenance coverage standard.  !d. \nSection IX. 9 of the Settlement Agreement requires the Secretary to use the \nEducational Campaign \"to communicate the SNF, home health, and OPT maintenance \ncoverage standards ... as set forth in Sections IX.6 through IX.8\" of the Settlement \nAgreement.  (Doc. 82-1 at 14, § IX.9.)  At a minimum, Plaintiffs bargained for the \naccurate provision of information regarding the maintenance coverage standard and their \nrights under the Settlement Agreement would be meaningless without it.  The Secretary \nmakes no claim to the contrary.  At least insofar as the Summary is concerned, the \n21 \n\nCase 5:11-cv-00017-cr   Document 106   Filed 08/17/16   Page 22 of 22\nSecretary breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to convey accurate information \nregarding the maintenance coverage standard. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the court GRANTS Plaintiffs' motion to enforce with \nregard to the Secretary's Educational Campaign and directs the Secretary to propose \ncorrective action for Plaintiffs' consideration within forty-five days of this Order.  In the \nevent the parties cannot agree to that corrective action, they may petition the court for a \nresolution of their dispute. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' motion for resolution of noncompliance with \nSettlement Agreement is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  (Doc. 94.) \nSO ORDERED. \n~ \nI? \nDated at Burlington, in the District of Vermont, this  day of August, 2016. \n~ \nChristina Reiss, Chief Judge \nUnited States District Court \n22 ",
