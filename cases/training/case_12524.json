    "summary": "<p>The Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center, a public hospital operated by the Los Angeles County government, was scheduled to close permanently on June 30, 2003. The hospital was a 207-bed facility specializing in the rehabilitation and acute care needs of patients with chronic diseases. Public services for the severely disabled had been consolidated at the site, and the facility provided a rare opportunity for people with multiple serious disabilities to receive full care in one location for their conditions. At the time, the hospital served more than 9500 patients per year in its inpatient and outpatient programs. Of these patients, about half were covered by Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid welfare program.</p><p>On March 6 of 2003, Plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, seeking to enjoin the County from closing the hospital. The case was brought under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165, and the Social Security Act, U.S.C. 12 §§ 13961, 1396d. Class certification was granted on April 29, 2003. Although their complaint has not been obtained by the Clearinghouse, the Plaintiffs' claims can be reconstructed from the court's Order Granting the Plantiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, issued May 6, 2003.  The Plaintiffs argued that the if the hospital were to close, they and other disabled individuals similarly situated would be unable to have their medical needs met in Los Angeles County, which would be impermissible, because the Social Security Act requires participating states to ensure that inpatient and outpatient hospital services be available to persons entitled to Medicaid services, and also requires that medically necessary and appropriate services be received on a timely basis, and that access to such services be comparable to that available to persons in the community who have private health coverage.</p><p>The court, in granting the order for a preliminary injunction, found that the Plaintiffs' case was likely to succeed on its merits. The County argued that closing the hospital would be fiscally responsible, saving the County $58.6 million a year. The court found the County's reasoning to be fallacious, because it did not account for the added cost of treating the hospital's patients at other facilities in the County.  The court reasoned that the cost to the County would be greater if the hospital were to close than if it remained open. The court also determined that closing the hospital without first ensuring that comparable services would be available to its disabled Medi-Cal patients elsewhere in the County would be illegal under the ADA, because in doing so the County would be distributing public benefits and services in a manner that discriminated against the disabled.</p><p>The court's preliminary injunction was thus granted, to remain in force until the case reached a final judgment, or until the court issued revised order. The County filed an appeal on the May 8, 2003. On February 5, 2004, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Pregerson, J.) issued an opinion upholding the preliminary injunction, and holding that the plaintiffs \"had demonstrated that if the County close[d] Rancho, it [would] reduce, and in some instances eliminate, necessary medical services for disabled Medi-Cal patients while continuing to provide the medical care required and sought by Medi-Cal recipients without disabilities\" and that this disparity in providing services constituted discrimination under the ADA.  Rodde v. Bonta, 357 F.3d 988 (M.D. Cal 2004).</p><p>The parties reached a settlement, which received preliminary approval on October 3, 2005 and final approval on January 30, 2006. In the settlement, the County agreed that Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center would remain open for at least another three years, maintaining at least the same level of service as was available in March 2003. In the settlement, the County expressed its intent to find a purchaser or partner to take over the operation of the hospital. The plaintiffs retained their right to bring legal action against any future efforts to either close or reduce the level of services available to Medi-Cal patients at the facility.  In accordance with this settlement, on January 30, 2006, the court ordered the County of Los Angeles to pay $1.75 million in legal fees to the Western Center for Disability Rights.</p><p>At the time of this writing, June 2013, Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center is still in operation and appears to still be operated by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.  </p><p>Although this case does not rely on or cite the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), which held that the ADA forbids the unnecessary institutionalization of disabled individuals, the Clearinghouse includes it in our collection of Olmstead cases because it stands for a correlative principle, that disabled Medicaid recipients must be provided access to levels of care sufficient to allow them to live as independent and integrated members of the community.</p>",

The court granted a preliminary injunction and the parties settled, with the County agreeing to keep the facility open for at least three years and the Plaintiffs retaining the right to legal action.",

This lawsuit was filed in March 2003 to prevent closure  of Rancno' \n5  Los Amigos Rehabilitation Center (\"Rancho\"), an acclaimed facility for treatment \n6  of persons with severe disabilities and chronic illnesses.  Plaintiffs represent a \n7  certified class of Medi-Cal recipients who receive care at Rancho. \n8  2.  Plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction that prevented \n9  closure  of Rancho, and the injunction was affirmed on appeal. Radde v. Bonta, \n10  357 FJd 988 (9th Cir. 2004).  Plaintiffs then secured a Settlement Agreement that \n11  protected the right to continued treatment for themselves and members of the \n12  plaintiff class.  Plaintiffs are prevailing parties in this litigation. \n13  3.  This lawsuit vindicated rights protected by the Americans with \n14  Disabilities Act  and the Medicaid Act. \n15  4.  The hours claimed by plaintiffs in this litigation, as modified by \n16  counsel's five percent voluntary billing judgment reduction, are reasonable.  This \n17  case required plaintiffs' counsel to make a massive factual showing, including \n18  numerous expert declarations, concerning the likely effect of the closure of \n19  Rancho on persons with disabilities and chronic illnesses.  Counsel also needed to \n20  analyze and brief in this Court and the Ninth Circuit major issues of first \n21  impression concerning the applicability of the Americans with Disabilities Act and \n22  the Medicaid Act.  Plaintiffs' attorneys then engaged in detailed and lengthy \n23  negotiations resulting in a comprehensive Settlement Agreement that protects the \n24  interests of the plaintiff class.  Throughout the litigation, counsel's presentation \n25  was thorough and persuasive.  The quality of representation was excellent. \n26  5.  The hourly rates claimed by plaintiffs are reasonable.  The rates are \n27  justified by substantial evidence of the customary rates charged by private \n28  attorneys with comparable experience; rates awarded in other cases, including to \nfindings & conclusions  fees.wpd \n\n•  • \n, . \nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 121   Filed 01/30/06   Page 4 of 6   Page ID #:•1  4' 3G \n15 \n16 \n17 \nUnited States District Judge \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nlindings & conclusions  fees wpd  2 \n\n•  • \n'\"  .'

The Court deems this matter appropriate for \n18 \ndecision without oral argument.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15. \n19 \nAccordingly, the hearing set for May 5, 2003, is removed from the Court's \n20 \ncalendar.  For the reasons set forth below, the Court hereby grants Plaintiffs' \n21 \nMotion for Class Certification. \n22 \n23 \nI. Class Definition \n24 \nPlaintiffs seek certification of the following class: \n25 \nAll present and future recipients of the Medicaid program: \n26 \n(a) who reside in the County of Los Angeles; (b) who have or \n27 \nwill have disabilities; and (c) who, because of their disabilities[,] \n28 \nneed or will need inpatient and/or outpatient rehabilitative and \n55 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 55   Filed 04/29/03   Page 2 of 8   Page ID #:18\nt  ' \nother medical services that are currently provided at Rancho Los \nAmigos National Rehabilitation Center. \n2 \n3  (Motion at 6). \n4 \n5  II. Objections to Evidence \n6  Defendants County of Los Angeles and Dr. Garthwaite object to a \n7  number of declarations offered by Plaintiffs as lacking in foundation, \n8  irrelevant, speculative, inadmissible lay opinions, and inadmissible \n9  testimony by unqualified experts.  Defendants' objections are overruled. \n10 \n11  A.  The Plaintiffs' Declarations \n12  Plaintiffs may testify as to the effects of the treatment they have \n13  received at Rancho.  Plaintiffs' testimony regarding the effect on them of the \n14  potential closing of Rancho is admissible; it is based on their personal \n15  knowledge and assessment of what other treatment options are available to \n16  them.  To the extent Plaintiffs are offering opinions, the Court finds their \n17  testimony to be admissible lay opinions pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 701. \n18 \n19  B.  The Goodwill CEO Declaration \n20  The CEO of Goodwill describes a history of interaction with Rancho, \n21  and the effects of the services provided by Rancho on Goodwill's clients.  His \n22  declaration is admissible. \n23 \n24  C.  The Doctors' Declarations \n25  Inexplicably, Defendants object to the testimony of a number of \n26  doctors as inadmissible testimony of unqualified experts.  This objection \n27  hardly warrants discussion; however, by way of example, the Court notes \n28  that Dr. Richard Chambers is unquestionably qualified as an expert: \n2 \n\n. \n,  Case 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 55   Filed 04/29/03   Page 3 of 8   Page ID #:19\nHe attended Columbia medical school, and completed an internship, two \nresidencies, and one fellowship in orthopedics.  He began working at Rancho \n2 \n3  approximately thirty-two years ago as the Chief ofOrtho-Diabetes Amputee \n4  Services; he has been Board Certified by the American Board of Orthopedic \n5  Surgery since 1977. \n6  Equally inexplicably, Defendants object to one doctor's statement that \n7  his department cares primarily for minorities. \n8  The physicians may testify regarding the racial and/or composition of \n9  the individuals they treat; they may testify regarding patient treatment and \nprofessional standards of care; they may testify regarding the availability of \n10 \ncomparable treatment at other facilities, based on personal knowledge; and \n11 \n12  they may testify regarding the detrimental effects on their patients of delays \n13  in treatment (or the failure to treat). \n14 \n15  III. Class Action Requirements \n16  Plaintiffs seek to have a class certified pursuant to Rule 23(a)(l)-(4) and \n17  23(b )(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Prior to class certification, \n18  plaintiffs must first define an ascertainable and identifiable class.  See \n19  Schwanz v.  The Upper Deck Co., 183 F.R.D. 672,679 (S.D. Cal. 1999). \n20  Plaintiff bears the burden of proof on class certification requirements. Hanan \n21  v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497,508 (9th Cir.l992). \n22 \n23  A.  Rule 23(a)(1)-(4) \n24  Rule 23(a) establishes four prerequisites for every class action:  (1) the \n25  class must be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable [the \n26  numerosity requirement];  (2) there must be questions oflaw or fact common \n27  to the class [the commonality requirement];  (3) the claims or defenses of the \n28  representative parties must be typical of the claims or defenses of the class \n3 \n\n.. \nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 55   Filed 04/29/03   Page 4 of 8   Page ID #:20\n\" \n[the typicality requirement];  and (4) the representative parties must fairly \n2  and adequately protect the interests of the class [the adequacy of \n3  representation requirement].  General Telephone Company of the Southwest, 457 \n4  U.S. 147, 102 S.Cr. 2364 (1982); Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)-(4). \n5  1.  Numerosity \n6  The Rule 23(a)(1) numerosity factor does not mean that the class must \n7  be so numerous that joinder is impossible, but rather simply that joinder of \n8  the class is impracticable. See Hams v. Palm Springs Alpine Estates, Inc., 329 \n9  F.2d 909, 913 (9th Cir. 1964). \n10  Plaintiff has presented evidence that the class is comprised of \n11  hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals.  The numerosity requirement is \n12  met. \n13  2.  Commonality \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that \"there are questions oflaw or fact common \n14 \n15  to the class.\"  Id.  The members of the class do not have to share every \n16  question oflaw or fact in common, but \"issues ... common to the class as a \n17  whole\" must exist and \"turn on questions oflaw applicable in the same \n18  manner to each member ofthe class.\" Califano v.  Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, \n19  700-01,99 S.Ct. 2545 (1979). \n20  The Ninth Circuit has recognized that when proposed members are \n21  moving for certification under Rule 23(a) in conjunction with Rule 23(b)(2), \n22  a district court may relax the commonality requirement. See Von Colln, 189 \n23  F.R.D. 584,590 (C.D. Cal. 1999) (citing Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, \n24  1045-48 (9th Cir.l998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1003, 119 S.Ct. 1140 (1999». \n25  Therefore, all that is required is that Plaintiffs share a common harm, even if \n26  individualized facts supporting the alleged harm differ.  Von Colin, 189 \n27  F.R.D. at 590. \n28  Here, there are common questions of law and fact. \n4 \n\nCa·s .e  2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 55   Filed 04/29/03   Page 5 of 8   Page ID #:21\n3.  Typicality \nThe typicality requirement of Rule 23(a) is met if \"the claims or \n2 \n3  defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of \n4  the class.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  This is a permissive standard, and \n5  \"representative claims are 'typical' if they are reasonably co-extensive with \n6  those of absent class members; they need not be substantially identical.\" \n7  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 FJd 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998).  To satisfy the \n8  typicality requirement, \"a class representative must be part of the class and \n9  'possess the same interest and suffer the same injury' as the class members.\" \n10  General Tel. Co., 457 U.S. at 156. \nII  The named Plaintiffs' claims are typical of those of the class. \n12  4.  Adequacy of Representation Requirement \n13  To satisfy the adequacy of representation requirement, \"the \n14  representative parties [must] fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n15  class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  Due process concerns require that absent \n16  class members be afforded adequate representation before they are subject to \n17  entry of a binding judgment. Hanlon, 150 FJd at 1020 (citing Hansberry v. \n18  Lee, 311 U.S. 32,42-43,61 S.Ct. 115 (1940)).  Determining adequacy of \n19  representation requires resolution of two questions: (1) Do the named \n20  plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class \n21  members? And (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the \n22  action vigorously on behalf of the class?  Hanlon, 150 FJd at 1020. \n23  Alternatively, the Ninth Circuit has stated that the adequacy of \n24  representation requirement is met when the representatives fairly and \n25  adequately protect the interests of the class.  Local Joint Exec. Bd. Of \n26  Culinary/Bartender Trust Fund v. Las Vegas Sands, Inc., 244 FJd 1152, 1162 \n27  (9th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 973,122 S. Ct. 395 (2001).  This adequate \n28  representation depends on the qualifications of counsel, the absence of \n5 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 55   Filed 04/29/03   Page 6 of 8   Page ID #:22\n,  '  •  t \nantagonism, a sharing of interests between representatives and absentees, \n2  and the unlikelihood that the suit is collusive.  Id. \n3  Defendants point to the fact that the individual class members have \n4  different medical needs, which leads to a divergence of interests, which is a \n5  form of antagonism.  The Court is unpersuaded.  All Plaintiffs have an \n6  interest in ensuring the availability of adequate medical treatment for Medi-\n7  Cal recipients, and the fact that their individual medical needs may differ \n8  from those of other class members does not render them inadequate class \n9  representatives. \n10  B.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n11  Rule 23(b)(2) allows class actions where \"the party opposing the class \n12  has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, \n13  thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding \n14  declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole ....\"  Id.  Under Rule \n15  23(b), \"[i]t is sufficient if class members complain of a pattern or practice \n16  that is generally applicable to the class as a whole.\"  Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d \n17  1032, 1047 (9th Cir. 1998) (certifying a class of aliens challenging inadequate \n18  notice of deportation by INS).  \"Even if some class members have not been \n19  injured by the challenged practice, a class may nevertheless be appropriate.\" \n20  Id. (citing 7A   Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, \n21  Federal Practice & Procedure § 1775 (2d ed. 1986); Adamson v. Bowen, 855 \n22  F.2d 668, 676 (10th Cir.l988) (emphasizing that although \"the claims of \n23  individual class members may differ factually,\" certification under Rule \n23(b)(2) is a proper vehicle for challenging \"a common policy\")). \n24 \n25  Here, Plaintiffs are challenging a common policy, and their claims fall \n26  squarely within Rule 23(b). \n27 \n28 \n6 \n\n· . \nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 55   Filed 04/29/03   Page 7 of 8   Page ID #:23\nIV. Defendants' Proposed Limitation of Class \n2  The Court is unpersuaded by Defendants' argument that future \nrecipients should not be included in the class.  Defendants argue that other \n3 \ncases certifying classes with future members have involved enjoining a \n4 \n5  systemic practice or rule, unlike the present case.  Defendants attempt to \n6  distinguish Von Colln v. County of Ventura, 189 F.R.D. 583,594 (C.D. Cal. \n7  1999), in which the court certified a class of prisoners, including future \n8  prisoners, in a case regarding whether those prisoners could be subjected to \n9  use of a certain type of restraint.  Von Colln, 189 F.R.D. at 594 (C.D. Cal. \n10  1999).  The Court sees no meaningful distinction between the future \nprisoners in the class of plaintiffs in Von Colln (all of whom could have been \nII \n12  subject to a certain restraint), and the class of plaintiffs here, (all of whom \n13  could be subject to inadequate care due to the closure of Rancho Los \n14  Amigos). \n15 \n16  V. Certification of Class \n17  The Court hereby certifies the following class of Plaintiffs: \n18  All present and future recipients of the Medicaid program: \n19  (a) who reside in the County of Los Angeles; (b) who have or \n20  will have disabilities; and (c) who, because of their disabilities[,] \n21  need or will need inpatient and/or outpatient rehabilitative and \n22  other medical services that are currently provided at Rancho Los \n23  Amigos National Rehabilitation Center. \n24 \n25  VI. Notice to Class Members \n26  Because certification has made pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), no notice to \n27  class members is required.  See Newberg on Class Actions, § 8:5. \n28 \n7 \n\n. \n.'  C.a. se 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 55   Filed 04/29/03   Page 8 of 8   Page ID #:24\nVII. Conclusion \n2 \n3  For the reasons set forth below, the Court hereby grants Plaintiffs' \n4  Motion for Class Certification (docket #21). \n5  The Court's concurrently filed Temporary Restraining Order shall \n6  apply with equal force to the absent class members. \n7 \nFLORENCE.M~E~ \n8 \n9 \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n8 ",

Under the Settlement, \nthe County will keep Rancho open and provide services to Medi-Cal recipients until at \nleast  , 2008 unless the County finds a buyer for Rancho. If the County decides to \nclose Rancho after  ,  2008,  you or other patients can still bring a new lawsuit \nto keep Rancho open. \nYOU RECEIVED THIS NOTICE because County records show that you have been a \nMedi-Cal recipient and a Rancho patient during the last three (3) years.  This Notice does \nnot affect your Medi-Cal benefits in any way. \nTHE COURT WILL HOLD A HEARING TO DECIDE IF IT SHOULD \nAPPROVE THE SETTLEMENT, described below.  You do not have to do anything \nunless you object to the Settlement.  If you object, you must file your objection as \ndescribed below.  Whether you object to the Settlement or do nothing, it will not affect \nyour ability to keep going to Rancho. \nI.  The Basis of the Rancho Lawsuit \nIn January 2003, the County Board of Supervisors voted to close Rancho because of \nbudget problems.  On March 6, 2003, three Rancho patients who get Medi-Cal \n(\"plaintiffs\") sued the County under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Medicaid \nAct and other laws.  Plaintiffs argued that closing Rancho would be discrimination \nagainst them and other Medi-Cal patients at the hospital because Rancho is the only \nrehabilitation hospital in the County primarily serving persons with disabilities.  The \nlawsuit only asked to keep Rancho open; it did not ask for money damages for plaintiffs \nor any other patients. \nOn May 8, 2003, the Court issued a preliminary injunction ordering that the County could \nnot close Rancho unless it made sure Rancho patients on Medi-Cal could get treatment \nelsewhere.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order on February 5, 2004. \nRancho currently remains open under the terms of the preliminary injunction.  The Court \n427306 vI  -z -\n\n•  • \nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 107    Filed 10/03/05   Page 10 of 14   Page ID\n #:125\nhas not issued a permanent injunction or made any permanent ruling on the merits of \nPlaintiffs' action.  c> \nLU \nThe County has denied and continues to deny that it engaged in any wrongdoing or has  , . \nany liability to Plaintiffs arising from its decision to close Rancho or from any of the\ni '. \nconduct, acts or omissions alleged in this lawsuit. \nII.  Who is a Member of the Class \nThe Court has certified the case as a class action on behalf of all Medi-Cal recipients \n(including seniors and children) who live in Los Angeles County, who have disabilities, \nand who, because of their disabilities, need or will need rehabilitative and other medical \nservices that are provided at Rancho. \nIII.  The Proposed Settlement \nPlaintiffs recently agreed to settle the case, rather than go to trial while the County health \ncare system is still facing budgetary problems.  The County agreed to the Settlement to \nsave the cost of litigation, but does not admit it has done anything wrong. \nThe Court has now ordered that this Notice go out to all class members.  This Notice is \nonly a summary of the settlement terms. (See Section IX below on how to get a copy of \nthe entire Settlement). \nIV.  Summary of the Settlement Terms \n(1)  Rancho's core rehabilitation services will stay open for at least three years \n•  Unless the County finds a buyer for Rancho, the County will keep Rancho \nopen for at least three years regardless of the County's budgetaiy problems. \n•  During the three year period, Rancho will operate with a total of 162 beds \n(146 average daily census) for all patients including Medi-Cal recipients. \n•  Rancho will keep providing acute inpatient rehabilitation services and \nrelated medical services: Adult Brain Injury, Spinal Cord Injury, Major Multiple Trauma, \nPediatrics, Neurology, Stroke Gerontology, Pressure Ulcer Management, Rehab Related \nMedical Surgeries, Intensive Care Unit, and two Operating Rooms. \nRancho will keep providing ortho-diabetes and arthritis care. \n•  n \n•  Rancho will keep operating outpatient clinics and providing therapy \nservIces. \n•  Patients who require chronic intravenous (\"IV\") antibiotic treatment or who \nhave liver disease will no longer be transferred to Rancho but will continue to receive \nPage 2 of6  NOTICE OF PROPOSED CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT \n( \nRodde v, Bonta, CV 03-1580 FMC (PJWx) \n\n. \n•  •  , \nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 107    Filed 10/03/05   Page 11 of 14   Page ID\n. \"  . \n #:126 \" \n•  0 \ncare at County facilities. \n,\" \n,-... 1 \n!.11 \n(2)  Over the next three years, the County will look for a buyer or establish a nonprofit; \norganization to take over Rancho. \n•  The entity taking over Rancho must agree to keep Rancho as a \ncomprehensive, catastrophic rehabilitation hospital, with both inpatient and outpatient \nservIces. \n•  The entity taking over Rancho must also agree to accept Medi-Cal and \nCounty indigent rehabilitation inpatients and outpatients for treatment under the same \nadmission protocols in place at Rancho in the year prior to the takeover. \n(3)  During the three year period, the County will use its best efforts to make Rancho \nrun in the most efficient and economical manner practicable. \n(4)  If after three years the County decides to close Rancho, there are things the County \nmust do for Medi-Cal recipients first: \n(a)  Prepare discharge plans for inpatients and outpatients who at that time are in \na course of treatment, use a ventilator, or have postpolio syndrome. \n(b)  Provide referrals for other outpatients who have received services in the last \nthree years. \n(c)  Create a plan for other County-run facilities to provide the type of inpatient \nand/or outpatient services provided at Rancho. \n(d)  Survey the facilities in Los Angeles County that accept Medi-Cal and are \naccredited to provide the types of services provided at Rancho to find out which \nfacilities will accept additional Medi-Cal patients. \n(e)  Arrange for the County's California Children's Services (CCS) program to \nensure that Medi-Cal recipients who are also covered by CCS, and who would \nhave received services at Rancho, receive appropriate inpatient and outpatient care. \nIMPORTANT:  Nothing in the Settlement prevents plaintiffs or other class \nmembers from bringing a new lawsuit to challenge the County's decision to close \nRancho or reduce the level of services available after the three year period. \nPlaintiffs and plaintiffs' attorneys believe the Settlement agreement is fair, reasonable \nand adequate.  Experts for plaintiffs arid the County estimate that it may take at least \nthree years of diligent efforts by the County to attempt to find an entity to take over \nRancho.  Experts for the parties also believe that an entity would not be interested in \ntaking over Rancho if this lawsuit were  going on. \nstil~ \nV.

Plaintiffs have agreed to not bring any new lawsuits to keep Rancho open so  fl \nlong as the County complies with the terms of the Settlement regarding Rancho's future  :' \nt'; \noperations.  If, on the other hand, the County violates the terms of the Settlement, \nplaintiffs or members of the Class can bring a new lawsuit in federal court to enforce the ,::\" \ntenns of the Settlement.  The District Judge for the current lawsuit would be the District \nJudge for the new lawsuit.  . \nVI.  Award of Attorneys' Fees and Expenses \nThe Settlement provides, subject to the Court's approval, that the attorneys representing \nplaintiffs will be paid 1.75 million dollars in fees and costs for their services and \nexpenses through to the hearing for the Court's final approval of the Settlement. \nVII.

Roybal Federal Building & Courthouse, 255 East \nTemple Street, Los Angeles, California.

Rancho is a County hospital\ndedicated primarily to providing inpatient and outpatient reha-\nbilitative care to disabled individuals. Plaintiffs are current\nand future Medi-Cal patients with special needs that require\nmedical  services offered at Rancho. They challenged the\nimpending closure of Rancho through this action. The district\ncourt granted plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction\nthat barred the County from going forward with its planned\nclosure without providing plaintiffs with necessary medical\nand rehabilitative services elsewhere. The County appealed.\nWe  have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §  1292(a),  and we\naffirm.\nI.\nRancho — one of six County hospitals — is a 207-bed\nfacility that specializes in rehabilitation and the acute care\nneeds of patients with chronic diseases. Rancho provides care\nto  about 2,600 inpatients and 8,600 outpatients annually.\nWhile most County hospitals predominantly treat the indigent\nand uninsured, Rancho has a high percentage of patients with\npublic and private insurance. About 67 percent of Rancho’s\n\n1672 RODDE v. BONTA\ninpatients and 58 percent of Rancho’s outpatients are Medi-\nCal recipients.1 \nRancho has served Los Angeles’s homeless, mentally ill,\ndisabled  and elderly populations since it opened in 1888.\nImportant health care innovations, including the “halo” device\nused  to support the head and neck of spinal cord injury\npatients, were invented at Rancho. Rancho was also the first\nfacility to replace wood with plastic for prosthetic limbs. By\nthe early 1930s, Rancho was becoming legendary for its occu-\npational therapy. Later, during World War II, Rancho began\nproviding long-term care and rehabilitation for polio patients;\nin 1954, the majority of the 1,865 Los Angeles area polio vic-\ntims were treated at Rancho. 2 \nIn 2002, in an effort to increase efficiency and reduce costs,\nthe County consolidated its clinical services for certain severe\ndisabilities. It did so by moving all acute inpatient rehabilita-\ntion,  chronic ventilator/pulmonary services, and pediatric\northopedic surgery for selected neuromuscular disorders to\nRancho. Before that time, these services were also offered at\nother  County facilities. Because of the consolidation, cur-\nrently about 60 percent of Rancho’s inpatients are transferred\nto Rancho from the other five County hospitals. \nRancho is a unique facility; no other facility in the area cur-\nrently provides many of the services it offers. 3 Because many\n1The state of California participates in the federal Medicaid program\nthrough its Medi-Cal program. The County, a Medi-Cal healthcare pro-\nvider, agreed to conform with federal (Medicaid) regulations in its con-\ntract with California. \n2Cecilia Rasmussen, Farm for Ill and Destitute Grew Into a Place of\nHope, L.A. Times, December 7, 2003, at B4. \n3Plaintiffs introduced ample evidence on this point. For example, decla-\nrations submitted by plaintiffs include the following observations. Dr.\nMichael Finocchiaro, physician specialist in Urology Services in Rancho’s\nUrology Department: “If Rancho Los Amigos closes, [certain] kinds of\n\nRODDE v. BONTA 1673\ndisabled patients will be unable to find necessary medical\ntreatment elsewhere if Rancho closes, doctors anticipate that\nclosing Rancho will have a devastating effect on the facility’s\ndisabled patients, including plaintiffs.4 Doctors are also con-\nurology and related ancillary services . . . would not be available else-\nwhere in the county for Medi-Cal patients;” Dr. Andrea Kachuck, pediatri-\ncian,  former Rancho physician, and former Medical Director of Los\nAngeles County’s California Children’s Services program: “[S]tudies have\nshown that the capacity for care of the population served by Rancho does\nnot exist elsewhere in Los Angeles County;” Dr. Michael Laidlaw, second\nyear resident at Los Angeles County-USC Hospital: “Rancho provides ser-\nvices which are simply not available elsewhere within the County sys-\ntem,” for example, a liver service for chronic liver disease and services for\ndiabetics with osteomyelitis; Dr. Ed Newton, Interim Chair of the Emer-\ngency Department at Los Angeles County-USC Hospital:  “I know of no\nother facility that will take uninsured patients requiring rehabilitation\ncare;” Dr. Salah Rubayi, Chief of Pressure Ulcer Management Program at\nRancho: “I am not aware of any alternative pressure sore management\nvenue available to MediCal patients in the event that Rancho Los Amigos\nwere  to close; ”  Dr. Kate Savage, orthopedic surgeon, Los Angeles\nCounty-USC Hospital and former Rancho employee:  “The only place to\nperform amputations is at Rancho. . . . If Rancho goes, we will have no\nplace to refer our uninsured patients who require medical procedures\nrelated to spinal conditions;” Dr. Scott Selco, fourth year resident in neu-\nrology at Los Angeles County-USC Hospital:  “Rancho is really the only\nplace we can send our patients for post-stroke rehabilitation services;” Dr.\nMichael Windland, third year resident in internal medicine at Martin\nLuther King Jr. Hospital:  “I know of no other place to send [certain]\npatients if Rancho closed.” \n4Plaintiffs introduced abundant evidence on this point, including decla-\nrations containing the following predictions. Dr. Amit Batra, fourth year\nAdolescent Medicine Fellow with the Department of Family Medicine at\nHarbor/UCLA Medical Center: “If Rancho were to close, I do not believe\nthere would be adequate or sufficient providers to care for its patients in\nthe private rehabilitation community;” Dr. Helena Chui, Chairman of the\nDepartment of Neurological Sciences and Associate Director of Neurolog-\nical Rehabilitation at Rancho: “[T]he proposed closure [of Rancho] would\nhave disastrous consequences for rehabilitation patients on Medi-Cal or\npending MediCal insurance — both those who need inpatient and outpa-\ntient rehabilitation;” Dr. Finocchiaro: “Without the appropriate and essen-\ntial medical tests, procedures, treatments and devices provided by the\n\n1674 RODDE v. BONTA\ncerned that closing Rancho will negatively impact the treat-\nment of patients at other County facilities as well as important\nmedical training and research.5 \ncombined specialty services at Rancho Los Amigos, patients would most\nlikely end up with more serious medical problems; ” Audrey Goldman,\nsocial worker and program manager for the National Multiple Sclerosis\nSociety, Southern California Chapter: “The closing of the Rancho facility\nwould be devastating to current and new MS patients that depend on the\nRancho MS clinic for ongoing management of their chronic illness; ” Dr.\nBrian Johnston, Chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at White\nMemorial Hospital: “The Rancho Los Amigos patients are among the\nmost complicated and difficult patients to treat in Los Angeles County. . . .\nTo take these patients out of the Rancho environment and drop them else-\nwhere is simply outrageous. The current County system cannot absorb\nthem . . . . The private sector simply does not have the capacity to absorb\nthese patients either;” Bryan Kemp, Chief of Geriatrics and Aging, Direc-\ntor of Gerontology Services and Aging Programs, and Director of Rehabil-\nitation Research and Training Centers on Aging with a Disability at\nRancho: “[T]he proposed closure [of Rancho] would have disastrous con-\nsequences for patients on Medi-Cal who are aging with a disability —\nboth those who need inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation;” Dr. Jacquelin\nPerry, medical consultant to the Pathokinesiology Laboratory at Rancho\nand Professor Emeritus in Orthopedics at USC:  “The massive disruption\nin the availability of rehabilitation services which will result if Rancho\ncloses will inevitably cause long delays in transferring patients out of\nacute hospitals to rehabilitation programs, even assuming that a rehab pro-\ngram can be found. Yet delaying the start of rehabilitation services can\nmake treatment far more difficult and in some cases, may defeat it entire-\nly;” Dr. Rubayi: “I would expect the number of [ ] acute cases to rise sig-\nnificantly  if disabled MediCal patients are deprived of the wound\nmanagement and rehabilitation services currently available to them only\nthrough Rancho Los Amigos; ” Freddi Segal-Gidan, physician assistant,\ngerontologist, and Director of Stroke Research and Education at Rancho:\n“[T]he proposed closure would have disastrous consequences for seniors\nin Los Angeles County on Medi-Cal and indigent seniors who are in need\nof inpatient and outpatient geriatric and stroke rehabilitation. ” \n5This prediction is well supported by the record, which includes decla-\nrations with these cautionary statements. Dr. Batra: “The proposed closure\nof Rancho will create tremendous pressure on the availability of services\nfor patients who rely on the County’s health care system, particularly its\nhospitals and trauma centers; ” Dr. Dong Chang, third year resident in\n\nRODDE v. BONTA 1675\nNevertheless, on January 28, 2003, the County decided to\nclose Rancho because of anticipated future budget deficits.\nThe County planned to reduce services at Rancho beginning\nMay 1, 2003, and to fully close the hospital by June 30, 2003.\nThe County expects to save $58.6 million annually by closing\nRancho. However, the County’s calculation does not take into\naccount the cost of providing Rancho patients with care at\nother County facilities. \nAlthough the County was expecting a budget deficit when\nit began studying cost-cutting proposals, a new infusion of\nMedicaid funding has helped the County’s health care system\nend the 2002-2003 fiscal year with over $300 million in its\nfund  balance. The County now projects that it will have\ninternal medicine at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center:  “Should Rancho . . .\nclose, the number of chronic patients at Harbor-UCLA would increase\ndramatically. This would mean that we couldn’t admit critical patients\nfrom our emergency room. . . . Rancho . . . is the best research center in\nthe County. . . . Rancho provides an educational experience that can’t be\nfound anywhere else in the system;” Dr. Irene Gilgoff, Chairperson of the\nDepartment of Pediatrics at Rancho:  “Advances in medical care are only\npossible when expertise is allowed to flourish. That is why there are  can-\ncer centers, HIV centers . . . . Rancho is the specialty care center for the\ndisabled;” Dr. Daniel Higgins, Director of Emergency Medical Services at\nSt. Francis Medical Center: “The closure and reduction of services at Ran-\ncho . . . will exacerbate an already devastating domino effect caused by\nthe recent decision to close various County health facilities ” and will ulti-\nmately “increas[e] health costs . . . and the suffering and chances for mor-\ntality;” Dr. Laidlaw: “If [Rancho] closes or reduces its services, the work\nin [County-USC Hospital] will be made more difficult. We will be unable\nto handle the load and acutely ill patients will be unable to find hospital\nbeds;” Dr. Newton: “Any reductions in county health services will signifi-\ncantly impact health care countywide. . . . If Rancho . . . closes it would\nbe a disaster. Patients admitted through trauma often need long-term reha-\nbilitation. We need Rancho as an outlet to transfer uninsured patients to; ”\nDr. Andrew Shpall, fourth year resident physician of Urology at Los\nAngeles County-USC Hospital with past experience working at Rancho:\n“Physician training at Rancho . . . is essential in adequately preparing\nUrology physicians. The closing of Rancho will result in less experienced\nand less skilled physicians.” \n\n1676 RODDE v. BONTA\nalmost the same amount in its fund balance for fiscal year\n2003-2004 and nearly $200 million at the end of fiscal year\n2004-2005. No shortfall is expected until 2006-2007.\nII.\nShortly after the County decided to shut down Rancho,\nplaintiffs filed this action to enjoin the impending closure.\nPlaintiffs  are a certified class of Medi-Cal recipients who\nreceive medical care at Rancho. Specifically, they include:\nAll  present and future recipients of the Medicaid\nprogram: (a) who reside in the County of Los Ange-\nles; (b) who have or will have disabilities; and (c)\nwho, because of their disabilities[,] need or will need\ninpatient and/or outpatient rehabilitative and other\nmedical services that are currently provided at Ran-\ncho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center. 6 \nPlaintiffs asserted Medicaid claims against a defendant state\nofficial alone, and asserted an Americans with Disabilities\nAct  (ADA) claim against all defendants, including the\nCounty.  Plaintiffs then filed a motion for a preliminary\ninjunction, seeking to enjoin the state and the County from\nterminating or reducing Medi-Cal covered inpatient and out-\npatient  services at Rancho. The district court certified the\nclass and granted plaintiffs a temporary restraining order on\nthe same day. \n6For example, named plaintiff and class representative Susan Rodde, a\nCounty resident and Medi-Cal recipient, alleges that she has cerebral\npalsy, allergies to common medications, urology problems, pressure sore\nproblems, arthritis, and orthopedic issues. She is a past Rancho inpatient\nand currently receives Rancho outpatient services up to three times a\nweek. According to the complaint, “despite a diligent search, [Ms. Rodde]\nhas been unable to identify any provider of Medi-Cal funded rehabilita-\ntions and outpatient services that can treat her condition other than Ran-\ncho.” Ms. Rodde’s declaration, filed in support of plaintiffs’ motion for a\npreliminary injunction, explains in detail the extent to which she relies on\nRancho for necessary medical attention. \n\nRODDE v. BONTA 1677\nAfter further briefing, the district court granted plaintiffs’\nrequest for a preliminary injunction. The court’s injunction\nbars the County\nfrom closing Rancho . . . or terminating reducing or\nmaking any further reductions in any inpatient or\noutpatient medical services . . . at Rancho which are\ncovered by the Medi-Cal program until [the County]\ncan assure the Court that plaintiffs and members of\nthe class will continue to receive comparable inpa-\ntient or outpatient services from other Medi-Cal pro-\nviders  in Los Angeles County and that they will\nreceive these . . . services in a timely manner and to\nthe same extent as members of the general popula-\ntion; and/or that plaintiffs and members of the class\nwill continue to have the same access to inpatient\nand outpatient services at other health care facilities\nwithin the Los Angeles County health care system\nthat they experienced at Rancho as of the filing of\nthis lawsuit on March 6, 2003. 7 \nIn support of its ruling, the district court found that the\nCounty consolidated services for the severely disabled at Ran-\ncho, which annually serves more than 9,500 patients, about 50\npercent of which are covered by Medi-Cal. The court found\nthat plaintiffs’ needs “could not and would not be met in the\nLos Angeles community” without Rancho, and that closing\nthe facility would harm many of its Medi-Cal patients because\nthey would be unable to obtain substitute care elsewhere. The\ndistrict court also concluded that closing Rancho as planned\nwould violate federal law because there was no evidence the\nCounty could transition Rancho patients before the closure,\nand further that the County’s contract with the state required\nit to comply with Medicaid regulations. Further, the district\n7The  injunction did not issue against the defendant state official\nbecause, as the district court observed, the state lacked the right to close\nRancho and had not threatened to do so. \n\n1678 RODDE v. BONTA\ncourt held that plaintiffs’ ADA claim was likely to succeed on\nthe merits. \nThe district court concluded that absent preliminary relief,\nplaintiffs would suffer “severe, irreparable harm” as a result\nof “lack of access to preventive care” and “medical complica-\ntions, amputations, increased risk of death, infection, organ\nfailure, and loss of functional ability. ” The court also consid-\nered  the County’s projected budget shortfall. The district\ncourt was not persuaded that closing Rancho would, as the\nCounty  claims, save the County $58.6 million annually\nbecause the County did not account for the added cost of pro-\nviding  services to current Rancho patients elsewhere. The\ncourt found it “abundantly clear . . . that the harm to the plain-\ntiffs if Rancho closes[ ] far outweighs the harm to the County\nif it remains open. ” Finally, evidence that closing Rancho\nwould add pressure to an overburdened County health care\nsystem persuaded the district court that the injunction served\nthe public interest. \nIII.\nA.  Preliminary Injunctive Relief \nTo  obtain a preliminary injunction in the district court,\nplaintiffs were required to demonstrate  “(1) a strong likeli-\nhood of success on the merits, (2) the possibility of irrepara-\nble injury to plaintiff[s] if preliminary relief is not granted, (3)\na  balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff[s], and (4)\nadvancement of the public interest (in certain cases).”Johnson\nv. Cal. State Bd. of Accountancy, 72 F.3d 1427, 1430 (9th Cir.\n1995) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Alter-\nnatively, injunctive relief could be granted if the plaintiffs\n“demonstrate[d] either a combination of probable success on\nthe merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or that seri-\nous questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips\nsharply in [their] favor. ” Id. (emphasis in original; citations\nand internal quotation marks omitted).  “These two alterna-\n\nRODDE v. BONTA 1679\ntives represent extremes of a single continuum, rather than\ntwo separate tests . . . . ” Clear Channel Outdoor Inc. v. City\nof Los Angeles, 340 F.3d 810, 813 (9th Cir. 2003) (internal\ncitation  and quotation marks omitted). As a result,  “the\ngreater the relative hardship to the party seeking the prelimi-\nnary injunction, the less probability of success” must be estab-\nlished by the party.  Id. (citation omitted). \n“In cases where the public interest is involved, the district\ncourt must also examine whether the public interest favors the\nplaintiff.” Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Lujan , 962 F.2d 1391,\n1400 (9th Cir. 1992) (citing  Caribbean Marine Servs., Co. v.\nBaldrige, 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 1988)). 8 \nB.  Appellate Review \nIn general, we review the denial of a preliminary injunction\nfor abuse of discretion.  Walczak v. EPL Prolong, Inc. , 198\nF.3d 725, 730 (9th Cir. 1999);  Bay Area Addiction Research\n& Treatment, Inc. v. City of Antioch , 179 F.3d 725, 730 (9th\nCir. 1999). The district court “necessarily abuses its discretion\nwhen it bases its decision on an erroneous legal standard or\non clearly erroneous findings of fact. ” Rucker v. Davis, 237\nF.3d 1113, 1118 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc),  rev’d on other\ngrounds, Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev. v. Rucker , 535 U.S.\n125 (2002). When the district court is alleged to have relied\non  an erroneous legal premise, we review the underlying\nissues of law de novo. Does 1-5 v. Chandler, 83 F.3d 1150,\n1152 (9th Cir. 1996). \n8In an attempt to show an abuse of discretion, the County argues that\nthe district court applied the wrong preliminary injunction standard. The\nCounty maintains that the plaintiffs cannot simply raise serious questions,\nbut instead must show a strong likelihood of success on the merits because\nthey seek to enjoin legislative action taken by a duly appointed public\nbody. But we have not adopted the heightened preliminary injunction stan-\ndard urged by the County. The district court relied on the well-established\npreliminary injunction standard uniformly used in this Circuit. Doing so\nwas not an abuse of discretion. \n\n1680 RODDE v. BONTA\nOur review of a decision regarding a preliminary injunction\n“is  limited and deferential. ”  Southwest  Voter Registration\nEduc. Project v. Shelley , 344 F.3d 914, 918 (9th Cir. 2003)\n(en banc). The court “do[es] not review the underlying merits\nof the case.” Gregorio T. v. Wilson, 59 F.3d 1002, 1004 (9th\nCir. 1995). Rather, our  “inquiry is at an end ” once we deter-\nmine that “the district court employed the appropriate legal\nstandards which govern the issuance of a preliminary injunc-\ntion, and . . . correctly apprehended the law with respect to the\nunderlying issues in litigation.” Cal. Profile Council Political\nAction Comm. v. Scully, 164 F.3d 1189, 1190 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\nIV.\nA.  Likelihood of Success: Title II of the ADA \nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding\nthat plaintiffs established a likelihood of success on the merits\nof their ADA claim. \n[1] Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination in public\nservices and programs. To establish a violation of the ADA,\na plaintiff must demonstrate: “(1) he is a ‘qualified individual\nwith a disability’; (2) he was either excluded from participa-\ntion in or denied the benefits of a public entity’s services, pro-\ngrams or activities, or was otherwise discriminated against by\nthe public entity; and (3) such exclusion, denial of benefits, or\ndiscrimination was by reason of his disability. ” Weinreich v.\nLos Angeles County MTA, 114 F.3d 976, 978 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(emphasis omitted). \nApplying this standard, the district court concluded that\nplaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on their ADA\nclaim. The County does not dispute that plaintiffs are quali-\nfied individuals with disabilities, or that as a public entity its\nhealth care program is covered by the ADA. 9 Instead, the\n9The County also does not take exception with the district court’s con-\nclusion (and the plaintiffs’ continued contention) that the discrimination at\nissue here is “by reason of” plaintiffs’ disabilities. \n\nRODDE v. BONTA 1681\nCounty’s arguments focus on whether the services plaintiffs\nwould lose with Rancho’s closure fall within the scope of care\nthe  County must provide to plaintiffs consistent with the\nADA. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that they\ndo. \nThe County attacks “the very premise of the district court’s\ndefinition of the benefit” at issue — the notion that plaintiffs\nare entitled to  “the specialized medical expertise ” they need\nfor adequate medical care — as contrary to Supreme Court pre-\ncedent.10  The district court considered this argument, but\nfound the County’s precedent distinguishable and its conten-\ntion unpersuasive. We agree. \n[2] At the core of the County’s argument is  Alexander v.\nChoate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985). In  Alexander, to save money,\nTennessee proposed reducing the number of annual days of\ninpatient care covered by the state Medicaid program from 20\nto 14 for all program participants. The evidence suggested\nthat about 27 percent of disabled participants required more\nthan 14 days of care, while only about 8 percent of non-\ndisabled participants required more than 14 days.  Id. at 289-\n90. Plaintiffs challenged the proposed reduction as discrimi-\nnatory (under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act) because\nit would have a disproportionate effect on the disabled. The\nSupreme Court concluded that the planned reduction was not\ndiscriminatory because it did not deny the disabled the bene-\nfits of the 14 days of care the state chose to provide; rather,\nthe plan left all patients \n10The County also argues that the district court’s suggestion that the\npublic “benefit” at issue here is Medi-Cal benefits is plainly erroneous\nbecause the state rather than the County provides Medi-Cal benefits.\nAlthough the district court did observe that closing Rancho would effec-\ntively deny plaintiffs the benefits of Medi-Cal, it also commented that “the\nclosing of Rancho can lead to denial of benefits to the disabled in that they\nwill receive inadequate or harmful medical treatment due to the lack of\naccess to the specialized medical expertise available at Rancho. ” There is\nno real dispute here; plaintiffs agree that the benefit at issue is County\npatients’ access to Medi-Cal covered services from County facilities. \n\n1682 RODDE v. BONTA\nwith identical and effective hospital services fully\navailable for their use, with both classes of users\nsubject to the same durational limitation. \n. . . \nMedicaid programs do not guarantee that each recip-\nient will receive that level of health care precisely\ntailored to his or her particular needs. Instead, the\nbenefit  provided through Medicaid is a particular\npackage of health care services, such as 14 days of\ninpatient coverage. That package of services has the\ngeneral aim of assuring that individuals will receive\nnecessary  medical care, but the benefit provided\nremains the individual services offered — not  “ade-\nquate health care.” . . . \nSection 504 seeks to assure evenhanded treatment\nand the opportunity for handicapped individuals to\nparticipate in and benefit from programs receiving\nfederal assistance. . . . The Act does not, however,\nguarantee  the handicapped equal results from the\nprovision of state Medicaid. \nId. at 302-04 (internal citation omitted). \nThe Alexander Court specifically noted that there was no\n“suggestion” in the record “that the illnesses uniquely associ-\nated with the handicapped or occurring with greater frequency\namong them cannot be effectively treated, at least in part, with\nfewer than 14 days’ coverage. ” Id. at 302 n.22. \nWe applied Alexander in Crowder v. Kitagawa, 81 F.3d\n1480 (9th Cir. 1996), where we held that a Hawaii law requir-\ning carnivorous animals entering the state to be quarantined\nviolated the ADA:\nAlthough  Hawaii’s quarantine requirement applies\nequally to all persons entering the state with a dog,\n\nRODDE v. BONTA 1683\nits enforcement burdens visually-impaired persons in\na manner different and greater than it burdens others.\nBecause of the unique dependence upon guide dogs\namong  many of the visually-impaired, Hawaii’s\nquarantine  effectively denies these persons . . .\nmeaningful access to state services, programs, and\nactivities while such services, programs, and activi-\nties remain open and easily accessible by others. The\nquarantine, therefore, discriminates against the plain-\ntiffs by reason of their disability. \nId. at 1484.\nConcerned Parents to Save Dreher Park Center v. City of\nWest Palm Beach, 846 F. Supp. 986 (S.D. Fla. 1994), cited by\nplaintiffs and the district court, also relied on  Alexander. In\nDreher Park, a Florida city had made available recreational\nand social programs and activities for disabled individuals at\nDreher Park. Id. at 988. Budget constraints caused the city to\nmake various cuts, including effectively eliminating the exist-\ning recreational programs for disabled individuals.  Id. at 989.\nPlaintiffs challenged the cuts under the ADA, and the court\ngranted their request for a preliminary injunction. The court\nconcluded that the complete elimination of the programs at\nDreher Park likely violated the ADA because there were no\nequivalent programs available to fill the void left by the clo-\nsure. Although disabled individuals could theoretically partic-\nipate in the general recreational programs the city offered at\nother locations, \nit is clear that many of the general programs are\nunable to offer the benefits of recreation to individu-\nals with disabilities because of the nature of the rec-\nreational  activities and the physical and other\nlimitations of persons with disabilities. . . . It appears\nfrom the evidence that City had offered the Dreher\nPark Center programs precisely because they were\nneeded to give equal benefits of recreation to persons\n\n1684 RODDE v. BONTA\nwith disabilities. When these programs were elimi-\nnated,  Plaintiffs were denied the benefits of the\nCity’s leisure services in contravention of Title II.\n. . . \nTitle II . . . require[s] that any benefits provided to\nnon-disabled persons must be equally made available\nfor disabled persons. \nId. at 991-92. \n[3] Alexander is distinguishable from the instant case. The\nreduction at issue in  Alexander was facially neutral — the\nmaximum hospital stay for  all patients was reduced to 14\ndays. The County’s argument that its proposed cuts are simi-\nlarly “across-the-board” because it also plans to reduce the\nbeds  at County-USC Hospital (and already has eliminated\nsome clinics) is unpersuasive. Reductions analogous to the cut\nin Alexander might include eliminating X dollars or Y percent\nof funding from the budget of each of the County’s six hospi-\ntals  or from each medical department or type of service\noffered therein. Eliminating entirely the only hospital of six\nthat focuses on the needs of disabled individuals (because the\nCounty earlier decided to consolidate such services at that\nhospital)  and that provides services disproportionately\nrequired by the disabled and available nowhere else in the\nCounty is simply not the sort of facially neutral reduction con-\nsidered in Alexander. Alexander may allow the County to step\ndown services equally for  all who rely on it for their health-\ncare needs, but it does not sanction the wholesale elimination\nof  services relied upon disproportionately by the disabled\nbecause of their disabilities. \n[4] Moreover, the Court in  Alexander specifically noted\nthat  nothing in the record suggested  “that  the illnesses\nuniquely associated with the handicapped or occurring with\ngreater frequency among them cannot be effectively treated,\nat least in part, with fewer than 14 days’ coverage. ” 469 U.S.\n\nRODDE v. BONTA 1685\nat 302 n.22. Here, in contrast, plaintiffs presented ample evi-\ndence that rehabilitative services and treatment for complex\nand disabling medical conditions, such as paralysis and condi-\ntions associated with severe diabetes, cannot currently be pro-\nvided effectively anywhere in the County system but Rancho.\nWhile the proposed cutback in  Alexander did not uniquely\naffect disabled individuals, the County’s planned cutback spe-\ncifically targets services for the disabled. Even after  Alexan-\nder,  the ADA prohibits the County from eliminating\nhealthcare services for the disabled in this manner. 11 \n[5] Further, in  Crowder, we confirmed that, even in the\nwake of Alexander, state action that disproportionately bur-\ndens  the disabled because of their unique needs remains\nactionable under the ADA. 81 F.3d at 167-68. As in Crowder,\nthe closure of Rancho would deny certain disabled individuals\nmeaningful access to government-provided services because\nof their unique needs, while others would retain access to the\nsame class of services. \n[6] Like the district court, we find the Dreher Park decision\npersuasive; it presents an analogous fact pattern, applies Alex-\n11The County also cites to  Alexander’s Second Circuit progeny,  Cerc-\npac v. Health & Hospitals Corp., 147 F.3d 165 (2d Cir. 1998), and Wright\nv. Giuliani, 230 F.3d 543 (2d Cir. 2000), but those decisions are similarly\nfactually distinguishable. In Cercpac, plaintiffs challenged the closure of\na specialized facility where the bulk of the services provided at that facil-\nity were to be provided at a new location one mile away. 147 F.3d at 168.\nThe County has not introduced evidence of a similar relocation plan here.\nIndeed, the injunction only bars the County from closing Rancho until the\nCounty demonstrates that it is prepared to provide Rancho’s services else-\nwhere. \nIn Wright, the court concluded that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction where\nthe record was incomplete and the requested injunction would change,\nrather than maintain, the  status quo. 230 F.3d at 546-48. In contrast, the\nrecord in this case is replete with evidence of an ADA violation and\nextreme hardship to plaintiffs as a result, and plaintiffs seek only to main-\ntain the status quo while this litigation is pending. \n\n1686 RODDE v. BONTA\nander, and reaches a fair and well-reasoned result. In both\nDreher Park and this case, the government first consolidated\nservices for the disabled at a single facility. Then, due to bud-\nget  shortages, the government decided to close the single\nfacility providing specialized programs for the disabled, while\ncontinuing to operate the facilities providing the same cate-\ngory of services to non-disabled individuals. While the dis-\nabled  could theoretically seek service from the remaining\nfacilities, the evidence suggested in  Dreher Park, as it does\nhere, that the services designed for the general population\nwould not adequately serve the unique needs of the disabled,\nwho therefore would be effectively denied services that the\nnon-disabled continued to receive. In light of all these paral-\nlels, the district court did not abuse its discretion in adopting\nDreher Park’s conclusion that such action violates the ADA\nand warrants an injunction. \n[7] In sum, plaintiffs demonstrated that if the County closes\nRancho, it will reduce, and in some instances eliminate, nec-\nessary medical services for disabled Medi-Cal patients while\ncontinuing to provide the medical care required and sought by\nMedi-Cal  recipients without disabilities. The district court\nrelied on the correct legal standards and its factual findings\nare supported by the record.12 Therefore, the district court did\nnot abuse its discretion in concluding that closing Rancho\n12The County faults the district court for its  “suggestion that the scope\nof the County’s obligation to provide care to disabled Medi-Cal beneficia-\nries consistent with the ADA must be measured as against the availability\nof services in the private sector. ” \nBut the district court’s injunction does not explicitly measure the Coun-\nty’s responsibility to its disabled patients against the treatment available\nto the disabled through private health care providers. Rather, the court\nenjoined the County from reducing services at Rancho until the County\n“can assure the Court that plaintiffs and other members of the class will\ncontinue to receive comparable inpatient or outpatient services from other\nMedi-Cal providers in Los Angeles County. ” We read the injunction to\nensure only that the  County make necessary healthcare services equally\navailable to all, regardless of the services that private facilities might offer.\n\nRODDE v. BONTA 1687\nwithout continuing to provide medically necessary services to\ndisabled individuals elsewhere would constitute discrimina-\ntion on the basis of disability. 13 \nB.  Balance of Interests \nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding\nthat plaintiffs would suffer greater hardship absent prelimi-\nnary  relief than the County would suffer because of the\ninjunction. \nPlaintiffs introduced compelling evidence that they likely\nwill suffer irreparable harm if the County closes Rancho at\nthis time. This harm includes delayed and/or complete lack of\nnecessary treatment, and increased pain and medical complica-\ntions.14 \nThe County’s interest in balancing its health care budget\nand controlling costs is strong. However, the evidence shows\nthat the County currently has a surplus and does not expect to\nexperience  a deficit until fiscal year 2006-2007. Further,\nwhile the County asserts that it will save $58.6 million annu-\nally by closing Rancho, in calculating its projected savings the\nCounty failed to consider the increased cost of serving Ran-\ncho patients at other facilities. Displaced patients will need to\nbe treated somewhere, and the evidence suggests that unless\nRancho’s  unique services are replaced, costs will likely\nincrease with Rancho’s closure because of medical complica-\ntions caused by the lack of appropriate treatment. Thus, while\nit is unclear just how much financial hardship the district\ncourt’s injunction creates for the County, it is apparent that\nthe cost is lower than the County contends. \n13 Because we conclude that plaintiffs’ ADA claim adequately supports\nthe  preliminary injunction, we need not address plaintiffs’ Medicaid\nclaims. \n14That plaintiffs sought to preserve, rather than alter, the  status quo\nwhile they litigate the merits of this action also strengthens their position.\n\n1688 RODDE v. BONTA\nMoreover, the injunction does not mandate that the County\nkeep Rancho open at any cost; rather, it requires the County\nto somehow, somewhere, continue to offer the services cur-\nrently provided at Rancho. The County is free to reorganize\nits health care system to increase efficiency and reduce costs,\nso long as it does so in an even-handed, non-discriminatory\nmanner. As we have maintained,  “[f]aced with [ ] a conflict\nbetween financial concerns and preventable human suffering,\nwe have little difficulty concluding that the balance of hard-\nships tips decidedly in plaintiffs’ favor. ” Lopez v. Heckler,\n713 F.2d 1432, 1437 (9th Cir. 1983). \nC.  Public Interest \nPublic interest considerations weigh on both sides of the\nscale. Permitting the County to self-govern without judicial\ninterference and allowing it to achieve a balanced budget in\nthe future serve the public. But plaintiffs demonstrated that\nclosing Rancho would place more pressure on the already\noverwhelmed County health care system, leading to increased\ndelays in treatment and prolonged suffering and illness among\nall those who rely upon it. Closing Rancho would also impair\nthe progress of important medical training and research cur-\nrently conducted there. \n[8] In light of plaintiffs’ strong showing of probable irrepa-\nrable harm to plaintiffs and the public at large, the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the public\ninterest favored issuance of a preliminary injunction. \nV.\n[9] Our review of the district court’s decision to grant a\npreliminary injunction is limited and deferential. The district\ncourt applied the appropriate legal standards in evaluating the\nmerits of plaintiffs’ ADA claim, and made no erroneous fac-\ntual finding. The district court also considered all competing\nconsiderations in weighing the threat of irreparable harm to\n\nRODDE v. BONTA 1689\nplaintiffs against the hardships asserted by the County, as well\nas public interest concerns. The district court therefore did not\nerr in granting the injunction. \nAFFIRMED. ",

The matter carne on for hearing on April 28, 2003, \n23  at which time the parties were in possession of the Court's tentative ruling to \n24  grant the preliminary injunction. At the conclusion of oral argument, the Court \n25  authorized further briefing by the parties. \n26  On April 29, 2003, the Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order, \nprecluding the County Defendants from terminating or reducing inpatient and \n27 \n28  outpatient medical services at Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 2 of 19   Page ID #:31\nCenter, pending further Order of Court. \n2  Since  the  April  28  hearing,  the  Court  has  read  and  considered  the \n3  following  supplemental  documents:  County  Defendants'  Supplemental \nPleading  to  Clarify  Issues;  County  Defendants'  Memorandum  re  Legal \n4 \n5  Conclusions; County Defendants' Objections to Plaintiff's Proposed Order; \n6  County Defendants' Supplemental Evidence; State Defendants' Response to \n7  County's Memorandum; Plaintiffs' Additional Exhibits; Plaintiffs' Further \n8  Brief; State Defendants' Response to Additional Proposed Orders;  Plaintiffs' \n9  Objections; and Plaintiffs' Proposed Revised Preliminary Injunction. \n10  For the reasons and in the manner set forth below, the Court hereby \n11  GRANTS  Plaintiffs' Motion  for  Preliminary Injunction as  to  the  County \n12  Defendants only. \n13 \nIntroduction \n14 \n15 \n16  Plaintiffs are persons with disabilities, who are Medi-Cal recipients; they \n17  receive medical and rehabilitative inpatient or outpatient services from Rancho \n18  Los Amigos  National  Rehabilitation Center (hereinafter \"Rancho\" or \"the \n19  Center.\") They seek an injunction to prevent the closure of the Center, which \n20  closure is currently scheduled to occur on June 30, 2003. \n21  Plaintiffs have made a very strong showing of substantial probability of \n22  success on the merits at trial, with clear and compelling evidence of irreparable \n23  injury which they will otherwise suffer. Contrasted with the potential economic \n24  harm to  defendants, the Court finds  the balance of hardships substantially \n25  favors plaintiffs' request. Arcamuzi v. Continental Air Lines, Inc., 819 F.2d. 935, \n937 (9th Cir. 1987).  Public interest clearly favors the granting of the injunction. \n26 \n27 \n28  2 \n\n------ ---------- --------\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 3 of 19   Page ID #:32\nSee American Motorcyclist Ass'n v. Watt, 714 F.2d. 962, 965 (9th Cir. 1983)  The \nCourt will issue the preliminary injunction. \n2 \n3  Plaintiffs seek an injunction against the Director of the State Department \nof Health Services, (hereinafter, \"the State\"), the County of Los Angeles, and \n4 \n5  the Director of the Coun ty Department of Health (hereinafter, \"the County\"), \n6  precluding them  from  closing  Rancho  until they can  assure that the class \n7  members will continue to receive comparable medical services.  Defendants \n8  essentially argue that neither is subject to such an injunction.  The County \n9  contends that it is not in violation of any federal laws or regulations, because it \nlOis the State which is charged with the responsibility of complying with federal \nrules implementing the Medicaid program. On the other hand, the State argues \nII \n12  that it is the County which runs Rancho, and only the County has the power to \nshut it down. \n13 \n14  Against this backdrop, we first examine objections to evidence, and then \n15  examine the evidence presented in connection with this application and the \napplicable law. \n16 \n17 \n18  Objections to Evidence \n19 \n20  Defendants  object  to  a great  deal  of Plaintiffs'  evidence.  Many  of \n21  Defendants'  objections  are  lacking  in  merit and  appear  to  be  boiler-plate \n22  objections.  Plaintiffs correctly note that Defendants object to a number of \n23  passages in a number of declarations, then specify several grounds for those \n24  objections, making it difficult to determine if Defendants object on all the \n25  grounds stated to all the passages cited. \n26  Many of the Defendants' objections mirror those made in opposition to \n27 \n28  3 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 4 of 19   Page ID #:33\nthe Motion for Class Certification. The Court's discussion in its April 29, 2003, \n2  Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification applies to the present \n3  objections as well. \nOne additional category of evidence warrants separate discussion here. \n4 \n5  Plaintiffs have offered the declarations of several doctors who work in  Los \n6  Angeles  County facilities  other than  Rancho  Los  Amigos.  These doctors \n7  discuss the potential impact closing Rancho Los Amigos will have upon the \n8  operations  of  these  other  County  facilities.  Their  declarations  are  not \n9  objectionable, as they are based on the personal knowledge of the declarants \nconcerning the operations of the facilities in which they work. \n10 \nDefendants' many objections are overruled. \nII \n12  In  any  event,  the  Court,  in  considering  a  request  for  preliminary \n13  injunction, has the discretion to consider evidence that would otherwise be \ninadmissible at trial.  See Flynt Distribution Co., Inc. v. Harvey, 734 F.2d 1389, \n14 \n15  1394 (9th Cir. 1984) (citing Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, s. \n16  2949). \n17 \n18  Statutory Background \n19 \n20  The Medicaid Program provides federal funds to states which pay for \n21  medical treatment for the poor.  The program was established in 1965 as Title \n22  XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.c. §1396, et seq.)  The Act provides \n23  \"federal financial assistance to states that choose to reimburse certain costs of \n24  medical treatment for needy persons.\" Hams v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 301,100 \n25  S.Ct. 2671,2680,65 L.Ed.2d. 785 (1980) Although participation in the program \n26  is  voluntary,  \"participating states  must  comply  with  certain  requirements \n27 \n28  4 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 5 of 19   Page ID #:34\nimposed by the Act and regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Health and \n2  Human Services.\"  Wilder v.  Virginia Hosp. Ass'n, 496 U.S. 498, 502, 110 S.Ct. \n3  510(1989) \nCalifornia participates in the Medicaid program through Medi-Cal, and \n4 \nthe  State  Department  of Health  Services  is  the  agency  responsible  for \n5 \n6  implementing the program in compliance with federal law. The Social Security \n7  Act requires participating states to ensure that inpatient and outpatient hospital \n8  services are available to persons entitled to Medi-Cal services.  Those persons \n9  must receive medically necessary and appropriate services on a timely basis, and \n10  must have access  to such services which is  comparable to  that available to \n11  persons  in  the  community who  have  private  health  coverage.  42  U.S.c. \n12  §§13961,1396d. \n13 \n14  FINDINGS OF FACT \n15 \nImpact of Closure on Plaintiffs and Prospective Class Members \n16 \n17 \nRancho serves more than 9500 patients per year through its inpatient and \n18 \n19  outpatient programs.  On average, approximately 50% of Rancho's patients are \n20  covered by Medi-Cal.  Rancho is a facility in which services to the severely \n21  disabled have been consolidated, providing a rare opportunity for the most \n22  seriously handicapped persons to  receive full  care in one location for their \n23  multiple conditions.  According to the declarations of many members of the \n24  medical community, Rancho is unique in the rehabilitation services it offers to \n25  many of the most complicated and difficult-to-treat patients in the county. \n26  The needs of the plaintiffs are demonstrated in the following examples: \n27 \n28  5 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 6 of 19   Page ID #:35\nPlaintiff,  Susan  Rodde,  suffers  from  cerebral palsy,  quadriplegia, scoliosis, \n2  leaking heart valves, and is confined to a wheel chair.  She currently receives \n3  outpatient services through the following Rancho clinics: dental, urological, \n4  internal medicine, orthopedic, women's, occupational therapy, physical therapy, \n5  and  seating.  Her  condition  is  complicated  by  numerous  related  medical \nproblems, including pressure sores, arthritis, and allergies. She benefits greatly \n6 \n7  from the coordination of treatment available at Rancho for her many medical \n8  problems. \n9  Plaintiff, Kenneth Younger, is a quadriplegic due to a spinal-cord injury, \n10  and confined to a wheel chair.  He utilizes and receives treatment from the \nfollowing  Rancho  clinics:  occupational  therapy, physical  therapy, pressure \nII \n12  management,  recreational,  urology,  social  services,  and  psychological \n13  counseling.  He is also dependent on the many interrelated services available to \n14  him only at Rancho. \n15  Plaintiff,  Antonio  Gaxiolo,  is  an  eight-year-old  boy  with  muscular \n16  dystrophy.  He uses a wheelchair and requires a ventilator to breathe.  He faces \n17  major risks from respiratory and other infections and from skin breakdowns. \n18  Rancho's team closely examines him to help prevent these complications. \n19  The Court finds that if Rancho closes, many of the needs of these patients, \n20  and hundreds like them, could not and would not be met in the Los Angeles \n21  community.  According to plaintiffs expert, Dr. Alan Sager, closing Rancho \n22  will harm many of its Medi-Cal inpatients and outpatients, who will not be able \nto obtain adequate substitute care at surviving hospitals or other settings.  Dr. \n23 \n24  Ed  Newton, Interim Chair of the Emergency Department at County USC, \n25  opines that closing Rancho would be a disaster.  He knows of no other facility \n26  that will  take  uninsured patients requiring  rehabilitation  care.  The same \n27 \n28  6 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 7 of 19   Page ID #:36\nopinion  is  rendered  by  Dr.  Brian  Johnston,  Chair  of the  Department  of \n2  Emergency Medicine at White Memorial Hospital: \"To take these patients out \n3  of the Rancho environment and drop them elsewhere is simply outrageous. \nThe current county system cannot absorb them.\" \n4 \n5  Dr.  Sager  believes  that well  over  one-half of the  Medi-Cal  patients \n6  currently being  treated  at  Rancho  will  not  be  able  to  secure  comparable \n7  alternative services from other rehabilitation providers, because of a \"lack of \n8  available beds, lack of available clinicians, lack of adequate financing, and lack \n9  of adequate care of comparable coordination, continuity, experience, and overall \nclinical effectiveness.\"  Many witnesses believe that because of an increasing \n10 \n11  unwillingness on the part of care-givers to take on new Medi-Cal patients, \n12  Rancho's patients will not be able to secure medical care. \n13 \n14  Impact of Closure on Defendants \nIS \n16  The County explains that the decision to close Rancho was part of an \n17  overall plan to bring the services of the Department of Health in line with \n18  available  revenue.  In  2000,  the  County entered  into  an  extension  to  the \n19  \"Demonstration Project for  Los Angeles County\"  to continue to assist the \n20  County in restructuring its health-care delivery system, to ensure its long-term \n21  viability and reduce the County's reliance on federal demonstration revenue. \n22  This extension, projected to run from July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2005, will \n23  provide the County with an additional $900,000,000 in federal funding.  (State \n24  Exh. 2000)  Because the funding for the Demonstration Project was \"front-\n25  loaded,\" the County Department of Health Services, in fiscal year 2001-2002, \n26  projected a budget shortfall which, in spite of the additional revenue,  would \n27 \n28  7 \n\n---- ----- --- ------\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 8 of 19   Page ID #:37\nreach $709 million dollars by the close of fiscal year 2005-6. \n2  However, the evidence before the Court concerning the impact of closure \n3  on projected deficits is unconvincing.  Fred Leaf, Chief Operating Officer of \nthe County Department of Health Services, testified that the closing of Rancho \n4 \n5  will save  the County approximately $58.6  million  per year.  This figure  is \n6  arrived at by taking the approximately $70 million per year that the County \n7  loses  operating  Rancho,  and  deducting  the  expenses,  such  as  bond \n8  indebtedness, which would continue after closure.  (Leaf Deposition, pages 26-\n9  27) \nThe fallacy in this calculation is that it does not factor in the added cost \n10 \n11  to  the  County of providing services  to  Rancho's  patients  at other County \n12  institutions.  \"If Rancho's  care  to  Medi-Cal  patients  is  dispersed  to  other \n13  hospitals in Los Angeles County, the cost of providing comparable services to \n14  treat these Medi-Cal patients can be expected to be greater than it is today. \n15  That is because Rancho has been able to achieve economies of scale through \n16  higher volume and greater expertise.  It serves its seriously disabled patients \nmore effectively and efficientiy ... Further, if Medi-Cal patients displaced by \n17 \n18  Rancho fail to obtain substitute outpatient care that is as clinically appropriate \n19  and effective as that provided by Rancho, patients who had been stabilized and \n20  rehabilitated by Rancho, and who had been served principally as outpatients, \n21  can be expected to de-stabilize and become more disabled.  That will engender \na higher volume of need for inpatient care than prevails today.  And it can be \n22 \n23  expected that a high share of this additional volume will flow  to surviving \nCounty DHS hospitals.\"  (Sager Dec., pages 13 and 31) \n24 \n25  It is abundantly clear to the Court that the harm to the plaintiffs if Rancho \n26  closes, far outweighs the harm to the County if it remains open. \n27 \n28  8 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 9 of 19   Page ID #:38\n2  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n3 \nThe Court is satisfied that the closure of Rancho as currently planned \n4 \n5  would violate federal law.  Defendants have provided the Court with evidence \n6  of plans under way, and committees which have been formed, to assist in the \n7  transition of patients to new providers.  No evidence indicates, however, that \n8  successful transition can be completed by June 30, even for Rancho's inpatients. \n9  As to outpatients, although defendants are willing to attempt to assist them to \nfind alternative medical care, they erroneously assert that they are not legally \n10 \n11  obligated to do so. \n12 \n13  Compliance with Medicaid Requirements \n14 \n15  It is well settled that under the Medicaid provisions of the Social Security \n16  Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, a participating state must comply \n17  with the conditions embodied in the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §§1396 et \n18  seq).  In so doing, it must provide equal access to medical care to Medi-Cal \n19  recipients.  \"According to the House Budget Committee report, the test for \n20  evaluating access is to compare the access of Medicaid recipients living in a \n21  specific geographic area with the access of individuals in the same area who \n22  have private or public insurance coverage. [citations]\" Clark v. Kizer,  758  F. \n23  Supp. 572 (E.D. Cal. 1990), vacated in part on other grounds, 967 F.2d 585 (9th Cir. \n24  1992).  \"State Medicaid plans must provide that the amount, duration, and \n25  scope of each covered service will remain sufficient or reasonably achieve the \nJ.K. \n26  purpose of the service provided. 42 C.F.R. §440.230(b ).\"  v. Dillenberg, 836 \n27 \n28  9 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 10 of 19   Page ID #:39\nF.Supp. 694, 697 (1993) \n2  The County contends that these provisions apply to the state, not the \n3  county, and that the Court therefore has no authority to enjoin its conduct. The \nCourt  disagrees.  In  the  November  2001  \"Contract for  Hospital  Inpatient \n4 \n5  Services\" entered into between the County and the State, the County (identified \n6  as the \"Provider\") made the following commitment: \n7  \"6.5 Conformance with Federal Regulations. \n8  The Provider stipulates that this Contract, in part, implements \n9  Title XIX of the Federal Social Security Act and, accordingly, covenants \n10  that it will conform to such requirements and regulations as the United \n11  States Department of Health and Human Services may issue from time to \n12  time, except for those provisions waived by the Secretary of Health and \n13  Human Services.\" \n14  That contractual provision binds the County to its obligation to adhere \n15  to, follow, and apply applicable federal regulations in exchange for the funds \n16  received from the Federal Medicaid Program.  SeeJ.K. v. Dillenberg, supra, 836 \n17  F.Supp. at 19.  It would be unjust in the extreme to conclude that a County \n18  could receive hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to manage its \n19  Medi-Cal program, and yet be free to ignore the conditions imposed by the \n20  federal government. The County defendants must comply with the statutes and \n21  regulations which accompany participation in the Medicaid program. \n22 \n23  Jurisdiction \n24 \n25  County defendants argue that the separation-of-powers doctrine precludes \n26  this Court's interference in the legislative decision of the County Board of \n27 \n28 \n10 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 11 of 19   Page ID #:40\nSupervisors at issue in this case.  Defendants cite County of Butte v.  Superior \n2  Court,  176 Cal.AppJd. 693, 699 (1985) for the proposition that a court should \n3  not interfere with a government's budgetary decisions.  The Court agrees with \nthe general proposition cited, but it has no bearing on the case at hand. At issue \n4 \n5  here  is  the  right of a federal  court  to  determine  whether  the  actions of a \n6  governmental agency are in violation of federal laws, a classic subject of federal \n7  jurisdiction. Lindy v. Lynn, 501 F.2d. 1367, 1369 (3rd Cir. 1974),28 V.S.c. §1331. \n8  The Court agrees with the following observations in Bass v. Richardson, \n9  338  F.Supp.  478,  482  (S.D.N.Y.  1971):  \"The  right at  issue  is  the proper \n10  administration of a program to which billions of dollars of federal funds have \nbeen  committed  and  where  Congress  explicitly  and  repeatedly  expressed \n11 \nconcern that the program be rigorously and properly operated.  If any case is \n12 \n13  proper for adjudication of important federal rights and issues of federal law by \n14  a federal court, it is this case.\" \n15 \n16  Americans with Disabilities Act \n17 \n18  The Court also finds that an injunction is appropriate based on plaintiffs' \n19  claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Title II of the Americans \n20  with  Disabilities  Act,  42  V.S.C.  §§  12131-12165  (\"ADA\"),  prohibits \n21  discrimination  in  public services, programs,  or activities:  \"[N]o  qualified \n22  individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \n23  participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \n24  of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by such entity.\" 42 V.S.c. \n25  § 12132. \n26  The ADA defines a disability as \"a physical or mental impairment that \n27 \n28  11 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 12 of 19   Page ID #:41\nsubstantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual.\" \n2  42 U.S.c. § 12102,28 C.P.R. § 35.104. Title II defines a \"qualified individual \n3  with a disability\" as \"an individual with a disability who, with or without \n4  reasonable modifications\" is otherwise eligible to receive services from  the \n5  public entity.  42 U.S.c. § 12131(2). \n6  The implementing regulations expand on the Title II prohibition against \n7  discrimination: \n8  (b)(l) A public entity, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may \n9  not,  directly  or  through  contractual,  licensing,  or  other \narrangements,  on  the  basis  of disability-(i)  Deny  a qualified \n10 \nindividual with a disability the opportunity to  participate in or \n11 \nbenefit from  the  aid,  benefit, or  service;  (ii) Afford  a qualified \n12 \n13  individual with  a disability an opportunity to  participate  in  or \n14  benefit from  the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that \n15  afforded  others;  [or]  (iii)  provide  a qualified  individual  with  a \ndisability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in \n16 \n17  affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the \n18  same benefit, or to  reach the same  level of achievement as  that \n19  provided to others .... \n20  28 c.P.R. § 35.l30(b)(l).  Similarly, the implementing regulations prohibit \noperating a public entity in a manner that results in prohibited discrimination: \n21 \n(3) A public entity may not, directly or through contractual or other \n22 \n23  arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration: ... (ii) \n24  That  have  the  purpose  or  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially \nimpairing accomplishment of the objectives of the public entity's \n25 \n26  program with respect to individuals with disabilities .... \n27 \n28  12 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 13 of 19   Page ID #:42\n28 C.F.R. § 35.l30(b )(3)(ii). \n2  Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  County  made  a decision  to  serve qualified \n3  individuals with disabilities at Rancho, and that, having made this decision, \nthey may not now, consistent with the ADA, eliminate services at Rancho. The \n4 \n5  Court agrees that the evidence of record demonstrates a likelihood of success on \n6  Plaintiffs' ADA claim and that a preliminary injunction should issue. \n7  The evidence of record amply demonstrates that Rancho serves a large \n8  number of qualified individuals with disabilities.  See, e.g., Exh. 8, Chambers \n9  Declaration (Rancho serves patients with diabetic foot complications, including \namputees);  Exh.  10, Chui Declaration (Rancho cares for 2000 persons with \n10 \nnewly diagnosed spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and stroke, as well \n11 \n12  as for  patients  with  chronic  neurological  and  medical  illnesses  (multiple \n13  sclerosis, heart and liver disease, diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease»; see \n14  generally Exh. 53 (Gill/Balsano Consulting Report). \n15  The evidence of record  also  amply demonstrates  that, under existing \ncircumstances, the qualified individuals with disabilities who receive care at \n16 \n17  Rancho would be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of \n18  Medi-Cal in the event of Rancho's closing or reduction in services.  See, e.g., \n19  Exh.  10, Chui Declaration (closing of Rancho would exacerbate an existing \n20  shortage of acute rehabilitation beds in Los Angeles County); Exh. 12, Debord \n21  Declaration (unable to refer patients to other providers because waiting lists \n22  were  too  long);  Exh.  16,  Finocchiaro  Declaration  (other  providers  lack \n23  equipment necessary to make services physically accessible); Exh. 18, Gilgoff \n24  Declaration (Rancho is the only comprehensive rehabilitation hospital available \n25  for children with muscular dystrophy); Exh. 19, Goldman Declaration (of the \n26  71  neurologists  who  accept  referrals  from  the  National  Multiple  Sclerosis \n27 \n28  13 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 14 of 19   Page ID #:43\nSociety, none will accept Medi-Cal patients); Exh. 51, Wunch Declaration (have \n2  not found locations that can handle children and adults on ventilators); Exh. \n3  120, Gaxiola Declaration (unable to obtain referral for disabled child in the \nevent of Rancho's closing); Exh. 21, Hagy Declaration and Exh. 11, Daggett \n4 \n5  Declaration  (dental  care  unavailable  for  physically  disabled).  There  is \n6  additional evidence that the closing of Rancho can lead to denial of benefits to \n7  the disabled in that they will receive inadequate or harmful medical treatment \n8  due  to  the  lack  of access  to  the  specialized  medical  expertise available  at \n9  Rancho. See, e.g., Exh. 4, Aceves Declaration (inadequate care because medical \npersonnel not familiar with disability); Exh. 33, Maki Declaration (similar); \n10 \nExh. 34, Montes Declaration (similar); Exh. 38, Perry Declaration (similar); \n11 \n12  Exh. 47, Thome Declaration (similar). \n13  The evidence also demonstrates the severe, irreparable harm to Plaintiffs \nin the absence of a preliminary injunction.  This harm takes the form of not \n14 \n15  only  lack  of  access  to  preventive  care,  but  also  medical  complications, \namputations,  increased  risk  of death,  infection,  organ  failure,  and  loss  of \n16 \n17  functional ability.  See, e.g., Exh. 12, Debord Declaration; Exh. 8, Chambers \nDeclaration; Exh. 10, Chui Declaration; Exh. 16, Finocchairo Declaration; Exh. \n18 \n18, GilgoffDeclaration; Exh. 31, Laidlaw Declaration (average twelve-hour wait \n19 \n20  in emergency room); Exh. 82, Sager Report (Plaintiffs' expert report); Exh. 141, \n21  Scott Declaration. \n22  The  evidence  also demonstrates that the public interest favors the \n23  granting of an injunction.  Plaintiffs have presented a great deal of evidence, \n24  mostly from doctors who work in the Los Angeles County health care system, \n25  regarding  the  pressure  that the closing of Rancho  would place on  already \n26  incredibly  overburdened  health  care  facilities.  See,  e.g.,  Exh.  15,  Fanous \n27 \n28 \n14 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 15 of 19   Page ID #:44\nDeclaration; Exh. 19, Goldberg Declaration; Exh. 21, Johnston Declaration; \n2  Exh. 26, Kaufman Declaration; Exh. 32, Leverso Declaration; Exh. 35, Newton \n3  Declaration; Exh. 121, Sandhu Declaration (and accompanying report). \nAs noted in a previous section, the Court has no difficulty concluding that \n4 \n5  the harm to Plaintiffs absent an injunction far outweighs the harm to County \nif an injunction is issued. \n6 \n7  Defendants  argue  that  Plaintiffs  must  establish intentional \n8  discrimination, and that they must establish that they were denied benefits or \n9  excluded from participation in services solely on the basis of their disabilities. \nDefendants' argument finds its roots in the language of the Rehabilitation Act: \n10 \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely \n11 \n12  by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation \n13  in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \nany program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. \n14 \n15  29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (emphasis added).  Title II's prohibition of discrimination, \n16  however,  does  not  require  that  discrimination  be  solely  on  the  basis  of \n17  disability. See 42 U.S.c. § 12132. Indeed, the implementing regulations and the \n18  case law make clear that no intent to discriminate is required to run afoul of \n19  Title  II.  See  28  C.F.R.  § 135.l30(b)(3)(i)-(ii)  (prohibiting  administrative \n20  policies that have the effect of discriminating against the disabled); Alexander \n21  v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 292-97,105 S. Ct. 712 (1985); Crowder v. Kitagawa, 81 \n22  F. 3d 1480, 1486 (9th Cir. 1996) (alleged violations of Title II are not analyzed \n23  using frameworks of disparate treatment or disparate impact; rather, the Court \n24  must merely inquire whether the disabled are denied \"meaningful access\" to \nstate-provided services); Concerned Parents to Save Dreher Park Center v. City of \n25 \n26  West Palm Beach, 846 F. Supp. 986,991 n.l2 (S.D. Fla. 1994). \n27 \n28  15 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 16 of 19   Page ID #:45\nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs have  no ADA claim because the \n2  County is not required to provide Medicaid benefits.  Defendants' argument \n3  misses the point.  Title II of the ADA does not require that any particular \n4  benefits or services be provided by a public entity; rather, Title II requires that \n5  benefits or services that are provided must be distributed in a manner that does \nnot discriminate against the disabled.  See Concerned Parents, 846 F. Supp. at \n6 \n7  991-92. \n8  Defendants argue that the present proposal is similar to the budget cuts \n9  examined by the Supreme Court in Alexander.  InAlexander, the Court held that \nfacially  neutral  reductions  in  services  do  not  result  in  an  ADA  violation. \n10 \nHowever, in contrast to Alexander, there is ample evidence before this Court \n11 \n12  that convinces it that the County's proposal has a vastly disproportionate impact \n13  on the disabled - one that effectively excludes them from the participation in \n14  and denies them benefits of the services and programs of the County in a \n15  manner that violates the ADA. \nDefendants rely on two Second Circuit cases:  Lincoln Cerpac v. Health an \n16 \n17  Hospitals Corporation, 147 FJd 165 (2d Cir. 1998), and Wright v. Giuliani, 230 \n18  FJd 543 (2d Cir. 2000).  The Court finds neither case persuasive.  In Lincoln \n19  Cerpac,  the  court  reasoned  that the  disabled are  entitled only to  the  same \n20  medical  care  as  the  nondisabled  under  the  ADA.  This  reasoning  is  too \n21  simplistic. By definition, the disabled will require more extensive care than the \n22  non disabled;  the  medical  needs  of,  for  instance,  the  wheelchair-bound \n23  parapalegic will necessarily differ from those of an ambulatory patient. Title II \n24  guarantees equal participation in public benefits, including, where the public \n25  entity chooses to provide Medicaid benefits, equal access to adequate medical \ncare.  Additionally, this case is factually distinguishable from Lincoln Cerpac. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n16 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 17 of 19   Page ID #:46\nThere is no indication in Lincoln Cerpac that moving the health care facility at \n2  issue in that case would result in the disproportionate denial of services to the \n3  disabled that is evident in the present case. \n4  Wright is also factually distinguishable. The Second Circuit found that the \n5  district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a request for preliminary \ninjunction where the record was insufficiently developed.  From the evidence \n6 \n7  in Wright, the Court could not determine whether the relief sought would afford \n8  meaningful access to housing and other benefits for homeless persons who were \n9  HIV-positive.  Additionally, Plaintiffs correctly point out that in Wright, the \n10  preliminary  injunction  sought  would  have  altered,  rather  than  merely \n11  preserved, the status quo. \n12  This Court's decision is consistent with that of Concerned Parents to Save \n13  Dreher Park Centerv. City of West Palm Beach, 846 F. Supp. 986 (S.D. Fla. 1994). \n14  In Concerned Parents, the city, faced with budget cuts, reduced the funding of its \n15  \"Department of Leisure Services\", which resulted in elimination of a number \n16  of programs for the disabled.  The court granted a preliminary injunction \n17  pursuant to Title II  of the ADA because the budget cuts had the effect of \n18  denying to the disabled the benefits of the city's recreational services. \n19  The evidence presented here leads the Court to the inescapable conclusion \n20  that the County's proposal would lead to the denial to Plaintiffs of meaningful \n21  access to public services in violation ofthe ADA.  See Crowder, 81 F.3d at 1486. \n22 \n23  State Defendants \n24 \n25  The Court agrees that, although the State has both the authority and the \n26  obligation to oversee the County's compliance with the Social Security Act, it \n27 \n28  17 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 18 of 19   Page ID #:47\ndoes not have the right to close a particular county facility, nor has it threatened \n2  or attempted to do so.  No injunction will issue against the State defendants. \n3 \nConclusion \n4 \n5  For the reasons stated herein, the Court issues the following preliminary \n6  injunction: \n7  Defendants, County of Los Angeles and Thomas L. Garthwaite, M.D., the \n8  current Director of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, and \n9  their successors in office, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and all persons \nloin active concert therewith are enjoined from  closing Rancho  Los Amigos \n11  National Rehabilitation Center (\"Rancho\"), or terminating reducing or making \n12  any  further  reductions  in  any  inpatient  or  outpatient  medical  services, \nincluding remedial services, at Rancho which are covered by the Medi-Cal \n13 \n14  program until defendants County of Los Angeles and Dr. Garthwaite can assure \n15  the Court that plaintiffs and members of the class will continue to  receive \n16  comparable inpatient or outpatient services from other Medi-Cal providers in \n17  Los Angeles County and that they will receive these inpatient or outpatient \nservices in a timely manner and to the same extent as members of the general \n18 \n19  population; andlor that plaintiffs and members of the class will continue to have \n20  the same access to inpatient and outpatient services at other health care facilities \n21  within the Los Angeles County health care system that they experienced at \nRancho as of the filing of this lawsuit on March 6, 2003. \n22 \nIt is further ordered that this preliminary injunction will remain in full \n23 \nforce until the final judgment of this Court, or until further Order of this Court, \n24 \n25  whichever occurs first. \n26  It is further ordered that Plaintiffs need not post any bond in connection \n27 \n28  18 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01580-FMC-PJW   Document 70    Filed 05/06/03   Page 19 of 19   Page ID #:48\nwith this preliminary injunction.
