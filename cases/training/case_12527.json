    "summary": "<p>The plaintiff in this case, Jacqueline Jones, has quadriplegia as a result of a spinal cord injury and requires assistance in carrying out daily life activities due to her mobility impairment. For many years, her parents were able to care for her, but as they approach old age they no longer have the physical capacity to do so. Ms. Jones was on the waitlist for Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord Injury (TBI/SCI) Medicaid waiver for several years. In 2009, the state conducted an assessment interview of Ms. Jones in which they determined that she was at risk for imminent placement in a nursing facility, it could not provide her with services. On December 2, 2009, Ms. Jones filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida alleging that the failure to provide services to allow her to remain in the community violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. She filed an accompanying motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>A few weeks later, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action as moot, as they began the process of providing Ms. Jones with waiver services. The court then postponed hearing Ms. Jones' motion for preliminary injunction, but did not dismiss the case immediately. In early January 2013, Jones filed a motion for class certification, as she sought to represent all individuals on the TBI/SCI waitlist. Before the court resolved the class certification motion, similarly situated plaintiff (and potential class representative) Michele Haddad filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. Discovery continued as the timeline on these motions was extended and multiple briefs were filed. The Court (Judge Marcia Morales Howard) denied Haddad's motion on May 7, 2010, because no class had been certified and Haddad therefore could not represent herself or others in Jones' case. (Haddad later filed a separate action. See <a href=\"../../../../case/12503/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Haddad v. Arnold</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The United States (DOJ) filed a motion to intervene in the case, seeking to represent the interests of individuals in Florida who are on the waitlist for services under the TBI/SCI Medicaid waiver. But because Ms. Jones had began receiving services, she stipulated to a voluntary dismissal and the case was closed in January 2011. The DOJ motion to intervene was not considered.</p>",

As grounds \ntherefore, the United States states as follows: \n1.   The United States’ Motion to Intervene is timely because the litigation is in its \nearly stages.  The defendants’ motion to dismiss and the plaintiff’s motion for class \ncertification are pending, and the United States’ intervention will not create any delay.  \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84    Filed 09/10/10   Page 2 of 15 PageID 761\nThus, intervention by the United States at this juncture will not prejudice the existing \nparties.   \n2.  The United States has a substantial legal interest in the subject matter of the action \nbecause it involves claims asserted under title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act \nof 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  The United States \nDepartment of Justice is the agency with primary regulatory and enforcement \nresponsibilities under title II of the ADA and, as such, plays a unique role in enforcing \nand interpreting the statute and its implementing regulations on behalf of the broad \npublic interest.  It also has a significant interest in enforcing the Supreme Court case, \nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), which held that unnecessary institutionalization \nviolates the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  \n3.  Disposition of the action without the United States’ participation may impede its \nenforcement and regulatory interests.  Because there are relatively few cases interpreting \nOlmstead, the outcome of this case implicates stare decisis concerns that warrant the \nUnited States’ intervention.   \n4.  The United States’ interests are not adequately protected by the existing parties to \nthe litigation.  Because the United States represents the public interest on a national \nscale, its interests do not necessarily align with the interests represented by private \nplaintiffs.   \n5.  The United States also satisfies the requirements for permissive intervention \nbecause its claims against the defendant have questions of law and fact in common with \nthe claims and facts at issue in the main action, and the action involves the interpretation \n  2 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84    Filed 09/10/10   Page 3 of 15 PageID 762\nof statutes that the Attorney General is entrusted by Congress to administer.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 24(b)(2).   \n6.  Pursuant to Local Rule 3.01(g), counsel for the United States conferred with \ncounsel for the defendant by telephone on August 19, 2010 concerning the United \nStates’ motion to intervene.  Counsel for defendant did not consent to the United States’ \nrequest for intervention.  Counsel for plaintiff consents to the United States’ Motion to \nIntervene.   \n7.  As further support for this Motion, the United States respectfully directs the Court \nto the following Memorandum of Law, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein \nby reference.   \nMEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF  \nUNITED STATES’ MOTION TO INTERVENE  \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \nThe proposed Complaint in Intervention alleges that the State of Florida fails to \nprovide necessary community-based services so that Medicaid-eligible individuals with \nspinal cord injuries who are at risk of institutionalization may be served in the “most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs.”1   The State continues to fund costly, \ninstitutional care, rather than provide sufficient community-based services to persons \nwith spinal cord injuries, placing them at risk of unnecessary institutionalization.  As a \nresult, Florida is in violation of title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 \n                                                 \n1 Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(c), the proposed Complaint in Intervention is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.  \n  3 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84    Filed 09/10/10   Page 4 of 15 PageID 763\nU.S.C. §§ 12131-12134, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and \ntheir implementing regulations (as interpreted in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999)).   \nCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 “to provide a clear and comprehensive \nmandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 12101(b)(1).  As Congress stated in the Findings and Purposes of the ADA, \n“historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, \ndespite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.”  42 U.S.C. § \n12101(a)(2).  For these reasons, Congress prohibited discrimination against individuals \nwith disabilities by public entities, including discrimination in the form of segregation.  \nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 588 (1999).   \nCongress sought “clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities,” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(2), and \nexplicitly stated that one of the purposes of the ADA was “to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment plays a central role in enforcing the standards established [in the Act] on \nbehalf of individuals with disabilities….” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(3).  The United States’ \nprominent enforcement role is reflected in the statutory authorization given the Attorney \nGeneral to commence a legal action when discrimination prohibited by the ADA takes \nplace. 42 U.S.C. § 12133. \nThe Department of Justice thus has a unique role in enforcing and interpreting \ntitle II and its implementing regulations on behalf of the broad public interest. This case \ndirectly implicates the United States’ interest in enforcing title II of the ADA and the \n  4 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84    Filed 09/10/10   Page 5 of 15 PageID 764\nDepartment’s goal of ensuring that the integration mandate of Olmstead is met. The \nUnited States also has a substantial interest in ensuring that recipients of federal financial \nassistance, such as the defendant, do not violate Section 504’s similar prohibition of \ndisability discrimination. \nThe private lawsuit was filed on December 2, 2009, in the U.S. District Court for \nthe Middle District of Florida, on behalf of Jacqueline Jones, a 35-year old woman with \nquadriplegia, who alleged that the State of Florida failed to provide her with home and \ncommunity-based services.  The denial of community-based services put her at risk of \ninstitutionalization in violation of title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.2  Shortly after filing the Complaint on behalf of the individual \nplaintiff, the Complaint was amended to include class claims.  The proposed class \nconsists of Florida residents with disabilities resulting from  \nspinal  cord  injur[ies]  who  are  Medicaid  recipients;  reside  in  the \ncommunity; desire to continue to reside in the community instead of a \nnursing  facility;  could  reside  in  the  community  with  appropriate \nMedicaid-funded  services;  and  are  at  risk,  as  determined  by  the \nrecipient’s treating physician or other treating health professional, of \nbeing  forced  to  enter  a  nursing  home  because  defendants  do not  \nprovide adequate community-based services.   \n \n(Amended Complaint at ¶34.)   \nOn December 29, 2009, defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint \nand on January 6, 2010, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification.  The motion to \ndismiss and motion for class certification remain pending.  On June 14, 2010, the Court \n                                                 \n2 The private lawsuit names in their official capacities, Thomas Arnold, the Secretary of the Florida Agency \nfor Health Care Administration (AHCA) and Dr. Ana Viamonte Ros, Secretary of Florida’s Department of \nHealth (DOH), as defendants.  Thomas Arnold resigned from his position in August 2010, and Elizabeth \nDudek is serving as Interim Secretary of AHCA.  \n  5 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84    Filed 09/10/10   Page 6 of 15 PageID 765\nissued an order granting a joint motion to extend discovery and expert witness disclosure \ndeadlines.  On August 25, 2010, the parties filed another joint motion to extend the \ndiscovery deadlines.  Accordingly, very little discovery has occurred to date, and the \nproceedings are at an early stage. \nII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  The United States Satisfies the Requirements for Intervention of \nRight  \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 24(a) provides that upon timely application, \nanyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: \nWhen  the  applicant  claims  an  interest  relating  to  the  property  or \ntransaction  which  is  the  subject  of  the  action  and  the  applicant  is  so \nsituated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair \nor  impede  the  applicant’s  ability  to  protect  that  interest,  unless  the \napplicant’s interest is adequately represented by existing parties. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2).  Fox v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 519 F.3d 1298, 1302-03 (11th Cir. \n2008) (quoting Chiles v. Thornburgh, 865 F.2d 1197, 1213 (11th Cir. 1989)); see also \nStone v. First Union Corp., 371 F. 3d 1305, 1308-09 (11th Cir. 2004).   \nHere, the United States’ request for intervention satisfies the requirements of Rule \n24(a)(2) for intervention as of right.  The United States has a substantial legal interest in \nthe subject matter of the action because this case directly implicates the United States’ \nresponsibility for enforcing title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  \nThe United States is timely seeking to intervene in this action, as the case is still in its \nearly stages, and its intervention will not disrupt the proceedings or prejudice either party.  \nMoreover, the United States Department of Justice—as the agency with primary \n  6 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84    Filed 09/10/10   Page 7 of 15 PageID 766\nregulatory and enforcement responsibilities under title II of the ADA—has direct and \nsignificant interests in this action that cannot be adequately protected by private parties.   \n1.  The United States’ Motion to Intervene is Timely \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit has identified several factors relevant to determining \nwhether a request for intervention is timely:  \n(1) the length of time during which the proposed intervenor knew or \nreasonably  should  have  known  of  the  interest  in  the  case  before \nmoving to intervene; (2) the extent of prejudice to the existing parties \nas a result of the proposed intervenor’s failure to move for intervention \nas soon as it knew or reasonably should have known of its interest; (3) \nthe extent of prejudice to the proposed intervenor if the motion is \ndenied;  and  (4)  the  existence  of  unusual  circumstances  militating \neither for or against a determination that their motion was timely.  \n \nGeorgia v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 302 F.3d 1242, 1259 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting \nChiles, 865 F.2d at 1213).  \nThe Supreme Court has emphasized that “[t]imeliness is to be determined from all \nthe circumstances.” NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. 345, 366 (1973). This Circuit has also \nrecognized that the requirement of timeliness “must have accommodating flexibility \ntoward both the court and the litigants if it is to be successfully employed to regulate \nintervention in the interest of justice.” U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 302 F.3d at 1259 \n(citing McDonald v. E.J. Lavino Co., 430 F.2d 1065, 1074 (5th Cir. 1970).   \nIn Chiles v. Thornburgh, a motion to intervene was held to be timely where the \nmotion “was filed only seven months after [the plaintiff] filed his original complaint, \nthree months after the government filed its motion to dismiss, and before any discovery \nhad begun.”  Chiles, 865 F.2d at 1213; see also Diaz v. Southern Drilling Corp., 427 F.2d \n  7 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84    Filed 09/10/10   Page 8 of 15 PageID 767\n1118, 1125-26 (5th Cir. 1970) (motion to intervene more than a year after the action was \ncommenced was timely when there had been no legally significant proceedings other than \nthe completion of discovery and intervention would not cause any delay in the process of \nthe overall litigation).   \nApplying these factors to the instant case, the United States’ application for \nintervention is timely.  Since the filing of the initial complaint in December 2009, the \nparties have engaged in only limited discovery.  Under the current scheduling order, \ndiscovery is not scheduled to close until December 2010, and the parties recently filed a \njoint motion to extend the discovery deadlines.  Thus, this litigation remains at an early \nstage and the United States’ decision to intervene at this point will not prejudice either \nparty.3  Davis v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 149 F.R.D. 666, 670 (S.D. Fla. 1993) \n(allowing intervention “[a]lthough the case has been pending for more than two years, \ndiscovery on the merits has not been completed and dispositive motions have not been \nfiled. As a consequence, there is no indication that this litigation is close to conclusion.”).   \nWhile the existing parties to the litigation will not be prejudiced by the United \nStates’ intervention, the United States will be prejudiced if its request for intervention is \ndenied.  Its interests in enforcing title II of the ADA and the integration mandate will \nundoubtedly be impaired if it is not permitted to intervene in this action.  Moreover, the \nDepartment of Justice’s extensive experience with the statutes at issue will benefit the \nexisting parties in presenting facts and arguments that will help frame the issues.  By \n                                                 \n3 Because the pending motions to dismiss and for class certification are fully briefed, the United States does \nnot seek to participate in the briefing of those motions. \n  8 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84    Filed 09/10/10   Page 9 of 15 PageID 768\navoiding multiple lawsuits and coordinating discovery, intervention will lend efficiency \nto the proceedings.   \n2.  The United States has a Substantial Legal Interest in this \nLitigation \n \nFor an applicant’s interest in the subject matter of the litigation to be cognizable \nunder Rule 24(a)(2), it must be “direct, substantial and legally protectable.” U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers, 302 F.3d at 1249.  See also Chiles, 865 F.2d at 1212-13 (noting that \nthe focus of a Rule 24 inquiry is “whether the intervenor has a legally protectable interest \nin the litigation.”)   The inquiry on this issue “is ‘a flexible one, which focuses on the \nparticular facts and circumstances surrounding each [motion for intervention].’”  Chiles, \n865 F.2d at 1214 (quoting United States v. Perry County Bd. of Educ., 567 F.2d 277, 279 \n(5th Cir. 1978)).  \nThe United States has a legally protectable interest in this litigation.  As the \nagency with primary regulatory and enforcement responsibilities under title II of the \nADA, the United States Department of Justice has significant interests in enforcing and \ninterpreting title II and ensuring that the integration mandate of Olmstead is met.  \nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 607.  Accordingly, the Department of Justice has recently brought, \nintervened in, or participated as an amicus or an interested party in Olmstead litigation in \ncases in Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, \nCalifornia, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.  Similarly, the Department of Justice \nhas the authority to coordinate the implementation and enforcement of Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  Executive Order 12250, “Leadership and Coordination of \n  9 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84    Filed 09/10/10   Page 10 of 15 PageID 769\nNondiscrimination Laws,” Nov. 2, 1980; 28 C.F.R. Pt. 41, App. A.  The central issues of \nthis case are critical to the Department of Justice’s efforts to advance national goals of \ncommunity integration and enforce the civil rights of persons with disabilities.  Thus, the \nUnited States’ interest in the pending litigation merits intervention as of right.   \n3.  The Disposition of the Instant Litigation May Impair the \nUnited States’ Ability to Protect Its Interest \n \nThe United States’ ability to protect its substantial legal interest would be \nimpaired absent intervention.  Because the ADA is a relatively young statute, federal \ndecisions interpreting and applying the provisions of the Act are an important \nenforcement tool.  Specifically, because there has been relatively little case law defining \nthe contours of a state’s fundamental alteration defense under Olmstead, an unfavorable \ndisposition of this case may, as a practical matter, impair the United States’ interest in \neliminating unnecessary segregation.  The outcome of this case, including the potential \nfor appeals by existing parties, implicates stare decisis concerns that warrant the United \nStates’ intervention.  See Stone, 371 F. 3d at 1309-10 (recognizing that potential for a \nnegative stare decisis effect “may supply that practical disadvantage which warrants \nintervention of right.”) (citing Chiles, 865 F.2d  at 1214); see also United States v. City of \nLos Angeles, Cal., 288 F.3d 391, 400 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that amicus curiae status \nmay be insufficient to protect the rights of an applicant for intervention “because such \nstatus does not allow [the applicant] to raise issues or arguments formally and gives it no \nright of appeal”).   \n  10 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84    Filed 09/10/10   Page 11 of 15 PageID 770\n4.  The Existing Parties Do Not Adequately Represent the United \nStates’ Interests \n \nThe fourth and final element to justify intervention of right is inadequate \nrepresentation of the proposed intervenor’s interest by existing parties to the litigation.  \nThis element is satisfied if the proposed intervenor “shows that representation of his \ninterest ‘may be’ inadequate.”  Chiles, 865 F.2d at 1214 (citing Trbovich v. United Mine \nWorkers of America, 404 U.S. 528, 538 n. 10 (1972)). The burden on the proposed \nintervenor to show that existing parties cannot adequately represent its interest is \n“minimal.” Stone, 371 F.3d 1311; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 302 F.3d at 1259 \n(citing Trbovich, 404 U.S. at 538 n. 10).  Any doubt concerning the propriety of allowing \nintervention should be resolved in favor of the proposed intervenors because it allows the \ncourt to resolve all related disputes in a single action.  Lloyd v. Alabama Dep’t of \nCorrections, 176 F.3d 1336, 1341 (11th Cir. 1999); Federal Sav. and Loan Ins. Corp. v. \nFalls Chase Special Taxing Dist., 983 F.2d 211, 216 (11th Cir. 1993). \nIn this case, the United States’ interest is in enforcing the ADA and Section 504 to \nadvance the public interest in eliminating discrimination in the form of unjustified \ninstitutionalization from a state’s failure to provide adequate home and community-based \nservices.  The private plaintiff cannot and does not represent the Department’s views on \nthe proper interpretation and application of title II and Section 504, and will not be able \nto make all the arguments that the United States will make if allowed to intervene.  As the \nNinth Circuit recognized in a case allowing private parties to intervene alongside \ngovernment agency defendants, “[t]he interest of government and the private sector may \ndiverge.”  Southwest Center for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 823-24 (9th \n  11 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84    Filed 09/10/10   Page 12 of 15 PageID 771\nCir. 2001); see also San Juan County v. U.S., 503 F.3d 1163, 1228-29 (10th Cir. 2007); \nScotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians of the Sugar Bowl Rancharia v. United States, 921 \nF.2d 924, 926-27 (9th Cir. 1990) (recognizing that city government’s interest could not \nbe adequately represented by another entity). \nB.  The United States Meets the Requirements for Permissive \nIntervention \n \nRule 24(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides an alternative basis \nfor the United States’ intervention in this action. Rule 24(b) states, in relevant part: \nUpon  timely  application  anyone  may  be  permitted  to  intervene  in  an \naction …when an applicant’s claim or defense and the main action have a \nquestion of law or fact in common.  When a party to an action relies for \nground  of  claim  or  defense  upon  any  statute  or  executive  order \nadministered by a federal or state governmental officer or agency or upon \nany regulation, order, requirement or agreement issued or made pursuant \nto  the  statute  or  executive  order,  the  officer  or  agency  upon t imely \napplication may be permitted to intervene in the action.  In exercising its \ndiscretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly \ndelay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 24(b).  The Eleventh Circuit has established a two-part test to guide the \nCourt’s discretion as to whether a party may intervene pursuant to Rule 24(b)(2): the \napplicant must show that “(1) his application to intervene is timely; and (2) his claim or \ndefense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.”  Chiles, 865 F.2d \nat 1213 (citing Sellers v. United States, 709 F.2d 1469, 1471 (11th Cir. 1983)).  \nAs discussed above, the United States’ application for intervention in this \nlitigation is timely and the United States’ participation would neither unduly delay the \nproceedings nor prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.  \nAdditionally, the United States’ claims against the Defendant—namely, that its failure to \n  12 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84    Filed 09/10/10   Page 13 of 15 PageID 772\nprovide adequate community-based services to individuals with spinal cord injuries \nrenders them at risk of institutionalization in violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct—share common questions of law and fact with the private plaintiffs’ claims.   \nAdditionally, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b)(2) permits intervention by a \ngovernment agency if a party’s claim is based on a statute administered by the agency.  \nAs the agency tasked with enforcing title II of the ADA, the Department of Justice’s \nintervention falls squarely within the language of Rule 24(b)(2).  See Halderman v. \nPennhurst State School & Hosp., 612 F.2d 84, 92 (3d Cir. 1979) (rev’d on other grounds) \n(stating that Rule 24(b)(2) makes “specific provision for intervention by governmental \nagencies interested in statutes, regulations or agreements relied upon by the parties in the \naction”); Disability Advocates, Inc. v. Paterson, No. 03-3209, 2009 WL 4506301 at *2 \n(E.D.N.Y. Nov. 23, 2009) (permitting intervention by the United States under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 24(b)(2) in an action based on title II’s integration mandate).  Accordingly, the \nUnited States meets the requirements for permissive intervention.       \n   \n  13 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84    Filed 09/10/10   Page 14 of 15 PageID 773\nIII.  CONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant the United States’ motion to \nintervene (i) as a matter of right pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure or, in the alternative, (ii) permissively pursuant to Rule 24(b) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure.   \n \nDated: September 10, 2010 \n            Respectfully submitted, \n            THOMAS E.

ANNA VIAMONTE ROSS, in \nher official capacity as Secretary, Florida Department of Health, by undersigned counsel,  \nsubmit this response and memorandum of law in opposition to Michele Haddad‟s Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction. As grounds therefore, Defendants state as follows: \nBACKGROUND \nOn  December  2,  2009,  Plaintiff  in  the  above-captioned  matter  filed  a  lawsuit \nalleging violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 \n(ADA) and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (Rehab Act).  In her \nComplaint,  the  Plaintiff  Jacqueline  Jones  alleges  that  she  is  a  Medicaid-eligible  adult \n1 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 2 of 19 PageID 594\nsuffering from quadriplegic paralysis who is at imminent risk of institutionalization due to \nDefendant‟s failure to provide personal care assistance in her home through the Medicaid \nprogram.  The Plaintiff expresses a desire to remain in the community and alleges that she \ncould do so with the appropriate services. \n  On December 15, 2009, Plaintiff amended her Complaint to allege class action \nviolations.  The putative class consists of “Florida disabled residents with a spinal cord \ninjury who are Medicaid recipients; reside in the community; desire to continue to reside in \nthe community instead of a nursing facility; could reside in the community with appropriate \nMedicaid-funded services; and are at risk, as determined by the recipient‟s treating physician \nor  other  treating  health  professional,  of being forced to enter a nursing home because \nDefendants do not provide adequate community-based services.”  Amended Complaint, ¶ \n34.  On January 6, 2009, Plaintiff filed her Motion for Class Certification, which the \nDefendants oppose and which has not been ruled on as of the filing of this Response. \n  On  December  29,  2009,  Defendants  filed  their  Motion  to  Dismiss  Amended \nComplaint based upon the mootness of Plaintiff‟s case and the Plaintiff‟s failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted.  In the Motion to Dismiss, Defendants pointed out \nthat the Plaintiff was already in the process of being enrolled in the Traumatic Brain Injury / \nSpinal Cord Injury Medicaid Waiver Program (TBI / SCI Waiver Program) and that the \ncase was therefore moot.1  In addition, Defendants explained that the ADA does not require \nthe provision of personal care services, the requested class action relief would result in a \nfundamental alteration of the Florida Medicaid program in violation of the ADA, and the \n                     \n1 Plaintiff Jones began receiving in-home services in the TBI/SCI \nWaiver Program on February 2, 2010. \n2 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 3 of 19 PageID 595\nclaims in the Amended Complaint are barred by issue or claim preclusion (or collateral \nestoppel).  As of the filing of this Response, the Court has not ruled on Defendants‟ Motion \nto Dismiss Amended Complaint. \n  On January 27, 2010, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to Amend First Amended \nClass Action Complaint.  The proposed Second Amended Complaint, which was attached to \nthe motion, would add three new named plaintiffs to this case: Dwayne Davidson, Nigel De \nLa Torre and Luis Cruz.  The Court has not ruled on this motion, which the Defendants \noppose. \n  On April 12, 2010, the Plaintiff filed an untimely Motion for Leave to File Third \nAmended Class Action Complaint, which would add Michele Haddad as an additional \nnamed plaintiff in this matter.  The Defendants oppose this Motion and filed on the same \ndate a Motion to Stay Proceedings in light of the pending motions in this case.  In addition, \non April 15, 2010, Plaintiff filed a motion styled Plaintiff Michele Haddad‟s Motion for \nPreliminary  Injunction,  Expedited  Hearing  and  Memorandum  of  Law  in  Support.  \nDefendants oppose this Motion for Preliminary Injunction because Ms. Haddad is not a \nplaintiff in this matter and because Ms. Haddad cannot demonstrate that she meets the \nrequirements for injunctive relief. \n  As further support, Defendants direct this Court to the following Memorandum of \nLaw, which is attached hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OF LAW \n3 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 4 of 19 PageID 596\nI.  Ms. Haddad is Not a Plaintiff in This Matter \n  Ms. Haddad is not a plaintiff in this matter.  While there is significant jurisprudence \nregarding the circumstances under which an injunction will affect non-parties, there is scant \nlaw on whether a non-party may seek an injunction.  What law there is, however, militates \nagainst issuing an injunction in favor of a non-party.  In Piambino v. Bailey, 757 F. 2d \n1112, 1137 fn. 62 (11th Cir. 1985), the following is found: \nAs a nonparty, what (the nonparty) was actually seeking was an injunction ... \ndirecting  Lead  Counsel  to  restore  their  attorney‟s  fee  and  reimbursed \nexpenses to ..the court and (as to a settlement) directing the parties to take no \nsteps toward its execution….the district court, having denied (the nonparty‟s \nintervention), had to deny his application for injunctive relief. \n \nIn Travelers Insurance Co. v. St. Judge Hospital of Kenner, La, Inc., 1990 WL \n136742 (E. D. La. 1990), the court found that Travelers was not the real party in interest \nand was therefore not entitled to seek a preliminary injunction.  The court further noted that \nin two instances in which a non-party sought injunctive relief, “an injunction could not \nissue.”  \nIt thus appears that the question of whether a non-party can seek an injunction is so \nself-evident, there is no need for expansive jurisprudence on this point.   \n   Moreover, Ms. Haddad is not likely to become a plaintiff in this case.  The Court \nshould deny the Motion for Leave to File Third Amended Class Action Complaint because it \nwas not timely filed.  On February 1, 2010, the parties jointly filed a Case Management \nReport in which the parties agreed that the deadline for Motions to Add Parties or Amend \nPleadings should be March 29, 2010.  On February 5, 2010, this Court issued a Case \nManagement and Scheduling Order setting March 29, 2010, as the deadline for Motions to \n4 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 5 of 19 PageID 597\nAdd Parties or Amend Pleadings.  By filing the Motion for Leave to File Third Amended \nClass Action Complaint two full weeks after this deadline, the Plaintiff is in direct violation \nof this Court‟s Order.  As such, the Plaintiff‟s Motion for Leave to File Third Amended \nClass  Action  Complaint  is  “distinctly  disfavored.”    Case  Management  and Scheduling \nOrder, ¶ 5.  Moreover, as Defendants demonstrated in their Response and Memorandum of \nLaw in Opposition to Plaintiff‟s Motion for Leave to Amend First Amended Class Action \nComplaint, Plaintiff‟s case is moot and the amendment of the complaint would be futile as \nthis third attempt to amend does not fix the deficiencies demonstrated in Defendants‟ Motion \nto Dismiss. \nII.  Ms. Haddad Cannot Meet the Requirements for a Preliminary Injunction \nIn order to obtain the requested preliminary injunctive relief, Ms. Haddad would \nhave to demonstrate that (1) she has a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits; (2) \nshe will suffer irreparable harm unless the injunction issues; (3) the threatened injury to Ms. \nHaddad outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the Defendants; and \n(4) the injunction, if issued, would not be adverse to the public interest.  Charles H. Wesley \nEduc. Found., Inc. v. Cox, 408 F.3d 1349, 1354 (11th Cir. Ga. 2005).  Ms. Haddad has the \nburden of persuasion in all of the four requirements for preliminary injunctive relief, which \nburden, due to the “‟extraordinary and drastic‟” nature of the remedy, Ms. Haddad must \n“clearly carry.”  United States v. Lambert, 695 F.2d 536, 540 (11th Cir. Fla. 1983) (citing \nTexas v. Seatrain International, S.A., 518 F.2d 175, 179 (5th Cir. 1975)); See also  Canal \nAuthority of Florida v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 573 (5th Cir. Fla. 1974). \n5 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 6 of 19 PageID 598\nAs demonstrated below, Ms. Haddad, even if she were a proper plaintiff in this \nmatter, could not and cannot clearly carry the burden of persuasion on the four requirements \nfor preliminary injunctions.  As such, Ms. Haddad‟s Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nshould be denied. \nIII.  Ms. Haddad Cannot Demonstrate Substantial Likelihood of Prevailing on the \nMerits \nMs. Haddad cannot show that she has a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the \nmerits in this case.  The entire premise of the proposed Third Amended Complaint is \nundermined by the fact that the regulations promulgated pursuant to Title II of the ADA \nspecifically provide that public entities do not have to provide services of the nature which \nMs. Haddad is demanding.  Neither are states required to provide the demanded services \nunder the Federal Medicaid Act.  To the extent that states choose to provide such services \npursuant  to a Medicaid home and community-based services waiver program (HCBS), \nfederal Medicaid law permits states to cap enrollment in such programs and to discriminate \non  the  basis  of  geography  and  disability.    The  accommodations  that  Ms.  Haddad  is \nrequesting would require Florida to fundamentally alter its Medicaid program, which the \nADA does not require.  Finally, Ms. Haddad‟s interpretation of federal regulations under the \nADA would both alter the federal Medicaid statute and create a private right of action, \nwhich no regulation can do. \n \n \n6 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 7 of 19 PageID 599\nA.  The ADA and Rehab Act Do Not Require a Public Entity to Provide \nPersonal Care Services \nThe specific services the Ms. Haddad is demanding in the proposed Third Amended \nComplaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction include assistance transferring from her \nbed  to  her  wheelchair  and  from  her  wheelchair  back  to  her  bed,  assistance  dressing, \ngrooming, toileting, and other activities of daily life.  Proposed Third Amended Complaint, ¶ \n44-45.  Plaintiff and Ms. Haddad contend that both the ADA and Rehab Act require the \nprovision of personal care services.  This is not the case. \n  Title II of the ADA states that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by \nreason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Title II also prescribes remedies available for a violation \nof the above provision and authorizes the Attorney General to promulgate implementing \nregulations.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12133, 12134. \n  Several regulatory provisions promulgated pursuant to Title II of the ADA are of \nparticular relevance in this case.  First, there is the “integration mandate” of 28 C.F.R. § \n35.130(d), upon which Plaintiff heavily relies, which states that “[a] public entity shall \nadminister services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \nneeds of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  Second, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7), states \nthat  “[a]  public  entity  shall  make  reasonable  modifications  in  policies,  practices,  or \nprocedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of \ndisability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would \n7 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 8 of 19 PageID 600\nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”  Finally, and most \nimportantly, 28 C.F.R. § 35.135 states that the ADA regulations do “not require a public \nentity to provide to individuals with disabilities…services of a personal nature including \nassistance in eating, toileting, or dressing” (emphasis added). \n  The Plaintiff and Ms. Haddad want the Courts to enforce one regulatory provision \nwhile ignoring another that specifically excludes the requested services from the scope of the \nfirst.    Florida  is  required  to  administer  its  services  “in  the  most  integrated  setting \nappropriate,” but this cannot be read to require the Florida Medicaid program to provide \n“services of a personal nature,” which is precisely the kind of services Ms. Haddad is \nrequesting here.  The ADA does not require the provision of these services.  This is all the \nmore true when it is considered that the provision of personal care services to Ms. Haddad \nwould require more than “reasonable modifications” to policies, practices, or procedures, but \nwould in fact require Florida to “fundamentally alter” its Medicaid program. \nB.  The Requested Relief Would Constitute a Fundamental Alteration of \nFlorida’s Medicaid Program \n  The State of Florida has no obligation to provide the Plaintiff with personal care \nassistance either through its HCBS Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord Injury Waiver \nProgram (TBI/SCI Waiver) or by adding personal care assistance services to its Medicaid \nState Plan. \n  Medicaid is a joint federal-state venture created by federal statute, Title XIX of the \nSocial Security Act of 1965, as amended.  42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.  In order to participate \nin Medicaid, a state must submit a plan to the federal government outlining its program to \n8 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 9 of 19 PageID 601\nfund medical services for the poor and needy in accordance with the federal Medicaid Act.  \nIf the federal government approves the plan, it “then subsidizes a certain portion of the \nfinancial obligations which the state has agreed to bear.”  Harris v. James, 127 F.3d 993, \n996  (11th  Cir.  1997)  (citing  Silver  v.  Baggiano,  804  F.2d  1211  (11th  Cir.  1986)).  \nCurrently, with the addition of stimulus funds pursuant to the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act of 2009, the federal government provides approximately 68% of the \nmoney in Florida‟s Medicaid program.  When the stimulus period ends at the end of 2010, \nthe federal contribution will likely return to approximately 55%. \n  The federal Medicaid Act defines “medical assistance” to mean payment for all or \npart of the services listed in 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(1) through (28).  42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a).  \nOnly seven of the twenty-eight services listed are mandatory, meaning that a state must \ninclude  such  in  its  state  plan  in  order  to  participate  in  Medicaid.    42  U.S.C.  § \n1396a(a)(10)(A).    Mandatory  services  for  adults  over  the  age  of  21 include inpatient \nhospital services, outpatient hospital services, laboratory and x-ray services, nursing facility \nservices, nurse-midwife services, and certified nurse practitioner services. See 42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(a)(10)(A) (requiring state plans to provide at least the services listed in § 1396d(a)(1) \nthrough (5), (17) and (21)).  Thus, Florida is required by federal law to make nursing \nfacility services available and, if these services are medically necessary for Plaintiff or Ms. \nHaddad, they are entitled to them as a matter of federal law.  See e.g., Goldberg v. Kelly, \n397 U.S. 254 (1970). \n  Florida may include any of the twenty-one services listed in 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a), \nincluding personal care services.  However, it is essential to note that Florida is not required \n9 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 10 of 19 PageID 602\nto provide such services to comply with the Medicaid Act, and, to the extent that Florida opts \nnot to provide any of these twenty-one other services, Florida‟s Medicaid recipients to do not \nhave an entitlement to those services. \n  In addition to the Medicaid services offered under a state‟s Medicaid State Plan, a \nstate may also enter into an agreement with the federal government to offer services under a \nwaiver program, such as the HCBS waivers.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c).  Under waiver \nprograms such as the TCI/SCI Waiver, the federal government agrees to “waive” certain \nrequirements of the Medicaid Act without jeopardizing federal financial participation.  42 \nU.S.C. § 1396n(c)(3).  Most importantly for the purposes of this case, the Medicaid Act \npermits waiver of the comparability requirement of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(B).  Id.  This \nprovision requires state plans to offer the services in 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a) to all Medicaid \nrecipients in the same amount, duration and scope.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(B).  By \nproviding for a waiver of the comparability requirement, the Medicaid Act permits states to \ndiscriminate on the basis of disability.   \n  The Medicaid Act also permits waiver of Medicaid requirements with respect to \nlimiting the number of persons receiving waiver services and eliminating the statewideness \nrequirement.  While a state must provide services under its State Plan to everyone who meets \nthe state‟s Medicaid eligibility requirements, the waiver law specifically allows states to \n“cap” the number of persons receiving waiver services.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(9)-(10).  \nWaiver of statewideness means that states can limit the provision of HCBS services to \ncertain parts of the state as opposed to persons living throughout the state.  42 U.S.C. § \n1396n(c)(3). \n10 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 11 of 19 PageID 603\n  It is important to note that while the federal Medicaid Act permits states to create \nHCBS waiver programs, it does not require states to do so.  As the Medicaid Act states, “a \nState plan approved under this subchapter may include as „medical assistance‟ under such \nplan payment for part or all of the cost of home or community-based services (other than \nroom and board) approved by” the federal government.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  Neither does the Medicaid Act require the federal government to approve states‟ \nHCBS waiver programs.  The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services \n“may by waiver” allow states to create HCBS programs.  Id. (emphasis added). \n  It is not disputed that the Florida Medicaid program does not provide in-home \npersonal  care  assistance  for  adults  like Plaintiff.  While Florida does provide in-home \npersonal care assistance through its TCI/SCI Waiver, Florida has opted to place a cap on the \nnumber of persons enrolled in this program.  The TCI/SCI Waiver program had no available \nopening at the time Plaintiff applied and she was thus placed on a waiting list.  In the \nAmended Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiff and Ms. Haddad do \nnot allege that Florida has violated the Medicaid Act by failing to provide them with in-\nhome personal care assistance.  However, in both the Amended Complaint and Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction they are requesting the Court to order Defendant to provide them \nwith such services.  Such an order would effectively nullify one or more provisions of the \nMedicaid Act, thus forcing modifications that would “fundamentally alter” the Medicaid \nProgram in violation of ADA regulations.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n  In  granting  Ms.  Haddad‟s  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction,  the  Court  would \ninvalidate the Medicaid Act‟s explicit statement that the only mandatory services are those \n11 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 12 of 19 PageID 604\nfound at 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(1) through (5), (17), and (21) by converting personal care \nassistance from an optional service to a mandatory service.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A).  \nThis  would  require  Florida  to  undertake  a  massive  program  expansion  to  ensure  the \nprovision of personal care assistant services to Medicaid recipients, fundamentally altering \nthe program in the process. \n  In the alternative, an injunction order would invalidate the provision in 42 U.S.C. § \n1396n(c)(1) declaring that HCBS waiver programs are optional for states and that states can \ncap enrollment in such programs.  The HCBS waiver programs do not have adequate \nnumbers of qualified community providers to sustain the significant increase in capacity that \nwould  come from invalidating enrollment caps.  Requiring Defendant to transfer large \nnumbers of persons onto such waiver programs would constitute a fundamental alteration to \nthe programs. \n  The  case  law Plaintiff cites in the Motion for Preliminary Injunction regarding \nreasonable modifications is instructive here.  In Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (U.S. \n1985), the U.S. Supreme Court made clear that while state Medicaid programs may not \ndiscriminate against the disabled, neither are such programs bound to provide specialized \nservices to the disabled that are not available to other Medicaid recipients, “as long as care \nand services are provided in „the best interests of the recipients.‟”  Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 303 (U.S. 1985) (Citing 42 U. S. C. § 1396a(a)(19)).  The Rehab Act, the Court \nheld, does not require states to alter the “definition of the benefit being offered simply to \nmeet the reality that the handicapped have greater medical needs.”  Id., at 304.  Here, \n12 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 13 of 19 PageID 605\nPlaintiff is essentially asking the Court to order Defendant to redefine the benefits offered \nunder the Florida Medicaid program to meet the heightened needs of the disabled.  \n  In summary, no state is required to offer personal care assistance services as part of \nits Medicaid State Plan, and Florida has not opted to do so.  Every state is required to \nprovide nursing facility services as part of its Medicaid State Plan, and Florida provides such \nservices to eligible Medicaid recipients.  Florida offers personal care assistance services \nwithin nursing facilities to Medicaid recipients who require them, both disabled and non-\ndisabled.  No state is required to create HCBS waiver programs.  Florida has created and \nreceived  federal  approval  for  several  HCBS  waivers,  including  the  TBI/SCI  Waiver.  \nFlorida offers personal care assistance services as part of several HCBS waivers, including \nthe TBI/SCI Waiver.  Florida has capped the enrollment in the TBI/SCI Waiver program to \n375, which is permitted under the Medicaid Act and has been approved by the federal \ngovernment.  The issuance of the preliminary injunctive relief would fundamentally alter \nFlorida‟s Medicaid program by requiring Defendant to either offer personal care assistance \nservices as part of its Medicaid State Plan or uncap or increase enrollment in the TBI/SCI \nWaiver.  It should be noted that Florida is not able to take either of these measures without \napproval from the federal government. \nIV.  Ms. Haddad Will Not Incur Any Irreparable Harm \nIn order to qualify for a preliminary injunction, Ms. Haddad would have to show that \nshe will suffer irreparable harm.  Mony Secs. Corp. v. Vasquez, 238 F. Supp. 2d 1304 \n(M.D.  Fla.  2002).    An  injury is irreparable only if it cannot be undone by monetary \n13 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 14 of 19 PageID 606\nremedies.  Cate v. Oldham, 707 F.2d 1176 (11th Cir. Fla. 1983).  Plaintiff fails to show that \nany harm she would incur by entering a nursing facility would be irreparable. \nThe case law cited by Plaintiff is inapplicable to the present situation.  She cites \nMcMillan v. McCrimon, 807 F. Supp. 475 (C.D. Ill. 1992), for the principle that the loss of \nMedicaid benefits constitutes irreparable harm.  In McMillan, the district court found that \nthe plaintiffs in that case would not receive the services and care they required in a nursing \nfacility.  McMillan, at 479.  In the instant case, Plaintiff does not contend that she would not \nreceive the medical services she needs if she were institutionalized in a nursing facility.  \nRather, she claims that the fact that such a facility is the only place she can receive the \nservices she needs constitutes a failure of the Defendant to provide services in the most \nintegrated setting pursuant to ADA regulations.  McMillan does not stand for the principle \nthat receipt of services in a less integrated setting constitutes irreparable harm. \nPlaintiff likewise cites Edmonds v. Levine, 417 F. Supp. 2d 1323 (S.D. Fla. 2006), \nto show that the denial of medical benefits, and the resulting loss of services, constitutes \nirreparable  harm.    In  the  Edmonds  case,  the  state  had  discontinued  coverage  of  the \nprescription drugs that the plaintiffs were already receiving.  Edmonds, at 1326.  The Court \nheld that the this denial of medical services constituted irreparable harm.  Id., at 1342.  This \nis not the situation in the instant case.  Ms. Haddad is not being denied medical services.  To \nthe extent that she needs personal care assistance, she would receive such services in a \nnursing facility. \nPlaintiff also cites Mitson v. Coler, 670 F. Supp. 1568 (S.D. Fla. 1987), which held \nthat a preliminary injunction was appropriate where plaintiffs risked losing their medical \n14 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 15 of 19 PageID 607\nservices, in this case nursing facility services.  The irreparable harm in Mitson, being forced \nout of a nursing facility, is the exact opposite of the irreparable harm that Plaintiff is \nalleging: being forced to enter a nursing facility.  Unlike the plaintiffs in Mitson, Ms. \nHaddad does not risk losing any services she is currently receiving.  Her complaint is that \nshe cannot receive the services in the setting of her choice. \nEven if Ms. Haddad did enter a nursing home, this harm would not be “irreparable” \nas Ms. Haddad would be eligible after 60 days for the nursing home transition program, \nwhich is funded and which would allow Ms. Haddad to be transferred to the TBI/SCI \nWaiver.  See April 29, 2010, Affidavit of Kristen Russell.   \nV.  The Balance of Hardships Weighs in Favor of the Defendants \nThe Court must balance the harms in determining whether a preliminary injunction \nshould issue.  Plaintiff contends that the threatened harm to Ms. Haddad outweighs any harm \nto Defendant.  Contrary to Plaintiff‟s assertions, she is not asking the Defendants to simply \nspend less of their Medicaid funds and permit her to continue to reside in her home.  To the \nextent  that  the  Plaintiff  is  asking  the  Court  to  make  personal  care  assistance services \nmandatory for Florida or to “uncap” the TCI/SCI Waiver, the state would be forced to \nassemble a massive personal care assistance provider network. \nThe case law cited by Plaintiff in this Motion is inapposite.  She cites Edmonds as \nfinding that the “harm to plaintiffs of being deprived of essential medical services outweighs \nany harm to state.”  In fact, the defendants in Edmonds never claimed that they would incur \nany hardship.  Since the plaintiffs did claim they would incur hardship, the Court concluded \n15 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 16 of 19 PageID 608\nthat  the  balance  of  hardships  weighed  in  their  favor.    Edmonds,  at  1342.    Here,  the \nDefendants would incur significant harm if a preliminary injunction is issued. \nPlaintiff also cites Illinois Hospital Asso. v. Illinois Dep't of Public Aid, 576 F. Supp. \n360 (N.D. Ill. 1983), for the principle that a state cannot characterize its duties to comply \nwith the requirements of an under an elective program such as Medicaid as constituting a \nhardship.    Id.    However,  this  does  not  describe  the  Defendants  in  the  instant  case.  \nDefendants  are  not  claiming that any of the duties imposed by the Medicaid program \nconstitute a hardship.  Rather, Defendants contend that the additional burdens that the Court \nwould be imposing by granting the requested injunctive relief, burdens that go beyond the \nrequirements of the Medicaid program, would constitute a hardship.  Furthermore, Illinois \nHospital Asso. is not an example of a court weighing burdens in favor of plaintiffs, as the \ndefendant in that case did not claim any hardship. \nVI.  The Public Interest Will Be Harmed if Ms. Haddad is Granted a Preliminary \nInjunction \nPlaintiff / Ms. Haddad has the burden of showing that the preliminary injunctive \nrelief they seek would serve the public interest.  Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, 403 \nF.3d 1223, 1226 (11th Cir. Fla. 2005).  Plaintiff claims that the public interest will be \nserved by an order granting a preliminary injunction in Ms. Haddad‟s favor.  However, the \nonly person such a preliminary injunction would serve would be Ms. Haddad.  To the extent \nthat the preliminary injunction required the State of Florida to add personal care services to \nits Medicaid State Plan or “uncap” enrollment in its TBI/SCI Waiver, Florida would be \nrequired to divert funds from other sources, potentially injuring other Medicaid recipients.  \n16 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 58    Filed 04/30/10   Page 17 of 19 PageID 609\nTo the extent that the preliminary injunction required Defendants to “jump” Ms. Haddad to \nthe head of the TBI/SCI Waiver waiting list, the state would be required to deny or delay \nbenefits to recipients who had been higher on the waiting list.  Such a result would be \ncatastrophic, not to mention inequitable and contrary to the public interest.  Plaintiff fails to \naddress this problem in her Motion. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons stated above, this Court should deny the Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction. \n \n  Respectfully submitted this 30th day of April, 2010. \n \nAGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE \nADMINISTRATION \n \n \n        BY:  /s/ Andrew  T.

No. 47; Notice), filed on February 22, 2010.  On January 6,\n2010,  the parties filed a notice advising the  Court  that  Defendants  were awaiting a\nnotification of the level ofc are from Comprehensive Assessment and Referral for Long Term\nCare Services, a prerequisite to aut horizing services for Plaintiff.  See Notice of Parties’\nAgreed Briefing Schedule and Hearing Date (Doc. No. 27) at 1.  The parties represented that\nthey would file a status report on February 1, 2010, regarding Plaintiff’s requested services.\n1 This is a “written opinion” under § 205(a)(5) of the E-Government Act and therefore is\navailable electronically.

However, the parties failed to file a status report by that date.  See February\n8, 2010 Order (Doc.

Case No. 3:09-CV-1170-J34JRK\nTHOMAS ARNOLD, in his official \ncapacity as Secretary, Florida Agency for \nHealth Care Administration, and \nDr. ANNA VIAMONTE ROSS, \nin her official capacity\nas Secretary, Florida Department of\nHealth, \nDefendants.\n________________________________________\nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION\nPursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2), Plaintiff Jones, through her\ncounsel, submits this Motion for Class Certification.  \n1. Plaintiff respectfully request the Court to certify the case to proceed on behalf of the\nfollowing class:\nFlorida disabled residents with a spinal cord injury who are Medicaid\nrecipients; reside in the community; desire to continue to reside in the\ncommunity  instead  of  a  nursing  facility;  could  reside  in  the\ncommunity with appropriate Medicaid-funded services; and are at\nrisk, as determined by the recipient’s treating physician or other\ntreating health professional, of being forced to enter a nursing home\nbecause  Defendants  do  not  provide  adequate  community-based\nservices.\n \n2.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief under the Americans With Disabilities\nAct (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504) to require Defendants to comply\n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 28    Filed 01/06/10   Page 2 of 5 PageID 338\nwith federal statutory law and federal regulations.\n3.  The named Plaintiff, Jacqueline Jones,  seeks certification of this case as a class\naction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) to pursue an efficient and just resolution of all class\nmembers’ claims.\n4. The proposed class consists of: Florida residents who currently, or at any time during\nthis litigation: (1) are Medicaid eligible adults with spinal cord disabilities; (2) reside in the\ncommunity and want to continue residing in the community and not in a nursing facility; (3) are at\nrisk of institutionalization if they do not receive appropriate community-based Medicaid-funded\nservices and (4) could reside in the community with appropriate Medicaid-funded community-based\nservices.\n5.  Numerosity:  The Plaintiff class is so numerous that joinder of all its members is\nimpracticable. According to the recently released Kaiser Commission “Medicaid Home and\nCommunity-Based Service Programs: Data Update,” at Table 11, there were 434 people with spinal\ncord injuries on Florida’s  “wait list” in FY 2008 for Medicaid community-based services.  In\nDecember 2008, based on a document prepared by one of the Defendants, the Florida Medicaid\nwaiting list for persons with spinal cord injuries had increased to 554 people. [Attachment “A.] By\napplying for community-based services, these people have indicated that they would rather live in\nthe community. Joinder is impracticable because class members lack the knowledge and financial\nmeans to maintain individual actions.\n6.  Commonality: There are questions of law and fact that are common to all named\nPlaintiff, as well as to all putative class members, including whether Defendants failure to increase\nthe number of people served in the community violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and the\n2\n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 28    Filed 01/06/10   Page 3 of 5 PageID 339\nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\n7. Typicality: The claims of the named Plaintiff is typical of the claims of the class\nas a whole in that the plaintiff and class members currently are at risk of institutionalization if\nDefendants do not provide appropriate community-based services.\n8.  Adequate representation:  The named Plaintiff will fairly represent and adequately\nprotect the interests of members of the class as a whole. The named Plaintiff does not have any\ninterests antagonistic to those of other class members. By filing this action, the named Plaintiff has\ndisplayed an interest in vindicating their rights, as well as the claims of others who are similarly\nsituated. The relief sought by the named Plaintiff will inure to the benefit of members of the class\ngenerally. The named Plaintiff is represented by counsel who are skilled and knowledgeable about\ncivil rights litigation, disability discrimination, Medicaid law, practice and procedure in the federal\ncourts and the prosecution and management of class action litigation.\n9. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,\nthereby making final injunctive relief appropriate with respect to the class as a whole under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(b)(2). Although the specific disabilities of the class members vary, they share a common\nneed for health and personal care services. A class action is superior to individual lawsuits for\nresolving this controversy.\n10.

Plaintiff Meets the Standards for a Preliminary Injunctive Relief \nThe criteria for granting a preliminary injunction are (1) a strong likelihood of success on \nthe merits, (2) the possibility of irreparable injury to plaintiff if the preliminary relief is not \ngranted; (3) a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff; and (4) advancement of the public \ninterest. Schiavo Ex Rei.  Schindler v.  Schiavo, 403  F.3d 1223 (11th Cir. 2005). The grant or \ndenial of a preliminary injunction is almost always based on an abbreviated set of facts, requiring \na delicate balancing of the probability of ultimate success at final shearing with the consequences \nof immediate irreparable injury, which could flow from the denial of preliminary relief. Siegal v. \nLepore, 234 F .3d 1163, 1178 (11 th Cir. 2000). If the other factors weigh in favor of granting \n1 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 2 of 20 PageID 23\nrelief, Plaintiff has only to show a substantial case on the merits of the claim. Schiavo, 403 F.3d \nat 1226. \nIn the instant caset Plaintiff Jones raises a very strong likelihood of ultimate success on \nthe merits under the Americans with Disabilities Actt 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (\"ADNt)t and \nthe  Rehabilitation Act of 1973t 29  U.S.C.  § 794a (\"Section 504\")t and  their implementing \nregulations; a very strong probability of irreparable injury; and both the balance of hardships and \npublic interests weigh significantly for her. AccordinglYt Plaintiff Jones is entitled to preliminary \ninjunctive relief \nII.  Likelihood of Success \nA.  Defendants' Responsibilities under the HCBS TBIISCI Waiver \nMedicaid is a joint federal/state program authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security \nAct. 42 U.S.C. §§  1396-1396v. It provides medical assistance to low income individuals who \nmeet  certain  eligibility  requirements.  States are  not  required  to participate  in the  Medicaid \nprogram.  If a state elects to participatet howevert it is required to comply with all applicable \nfederal statutory and regulatory requirements. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a; Wilder v.  Virginia Hosp. Ass'n, \n496 U.S. 498. 502 (1990); Florida Ass'n of Rehab. Facilities, Inc.  v.  Florida Dep't of Health & \nRehab. Servs., 225 F.3d 1208t 1211 (lIth Cir. 2000). \nMedicaid home and community-based services (HCBS) waiver  programs are authorized \nI \nby 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c) and governed by 42 C.F.R. §§ 441.300-.310. Waiver programs enable \ntt \nStates that opt to provide waiver services may \"waive the requirements of \nstatewideness, comparability and income requirements for which a state's other Medicaid \nservices and programs must otherwise comply with 42 U.S.C.§1396n(c)(3). The Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services has approved nine waivers in Florida for people who \nwould otherwise require care in a nursing facility.  Ms. Jones meets the eligibility criteria for \nFlorida's Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord Injury Waiver (\"TBI/SCI\"). \n2 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 3 of 20 PageID 24\nstates to provide home and community-based services to individuals with disabilities who would \notherwise need  the  level of care provided in the  institutional  nursing home.  2  Personal care \nassistant services (PCA) is one of the services that can be provided through a waiver. 42 U.S.C. § \nl396n(c)(4)(6). Medicaid waiver programs must, in the aggregate, be cost-neutral, in that the \ntotal average cost of providing care for program participants in the home and community based \nsetting must not exceed the estimated total average cost of providing care in the institutional \nsetting that these participants would require. 42 U.S.C. §1396n(c)(2)(D), 42 C.F.R. §441.302(e). \nFlorida's Medicaid waiver program is one of the two Medicaid programs which could \nprevent Mr. Jones's imminent institutionalization. The other Medicaid program is the \"personal \ncare services\" benefits. 42 U.S.C. § l396n(a)(24). Under the program, states like Florida provide \npersonal attendant services such as Plaintiff Jones requires. However, Florida has opted to limit \nits personal care services benefits to persons who reside in its Medicaid funded assisted living \nfacilities and does not provide these services to persons who reside in their own apartments or \nhomes. \nB.  The ADA and Section 504 \nSection  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.  § 794a (\"Section 504\")  is \n\"commonly known as the civil rights bill of the disabled,\" Americans Disabled for Accessible \nPublic Transp. (ADAPT) v. Skinner, 881 F.2d 1184, 1187 (3d Cir. 1989) (en bane), and prohibits \ndisability-based discrimination by federal funding recipients, such as Defendants. 29 U.S.C. § \n794(a).  Extending  the  prohibitions  of Section  504,  Congress  enacted  the  Americans  with \n2  The Florida Medicaid per diem reimbursement is $178.45 on average for \nan annual average reimbursement 0 f $ 65, l34.25.  See \nhttp://www.fdhc.state.fl.us?Medicaidlcost_reimlnh_fates.shtml. \n3 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 4 of 20 PageID 25\nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.  § 12101  et seq. (ADA), in 1990 to prohibit discrimination by all \npublic entities, regardless of whether they receive federal funding. H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, \nat 49 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 267, 472.  Like Section 504, Title II of the ADA \nbroadly prohibits discrimination by public entities, such as Defendants. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131(1), \n12132. The ADA and Section 504 are analyzed together since \"there is no significant difference \nin the analysis of rights and obligations created by the two.\" Zulke v.  Regents of the Univ.  of \nCalif,  166  F.3d  1041,  1045  n.ll  (9th  Cir.  1999).  The  ADA  provides  that  the  \"remedies, \nprocedures, and rights set forth in [Section 504] shall be the remedies, procedures and rights \n[applicable to ADA claims].\" 42 U.S.C. § 12133. Section 504 and the ADA reflect Congress' \nrecognition  of  the  pervasiveness  of  disability-based  discrimination  in  society.  Congress \nspecifically  found  that \"discrimination  against  individuals  with  disabilities  persists  in  such \ncritical areas as ... health services .... \" 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(3) (ADA) (emphasis added); see \nalso 29 U.S.C. § 701(a)(5) (Section 504). \nThe  concept of \"discrimination\"  under  these  Acts  encompasses  more  than  disparate \ntreatment of people with disabilities vis-A-vis individuals without disabilities. See Olmstead v. \nL.e., 527 U.S. 581, 598 (1999) (ADA); Alexander v.  Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 297, 300-01 (1984) \n(Section 504); Shelen L. v.  DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 333, 335 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 813 \n(1995) (ADA); Nathanson v.  Medical College of Penn., 926 F.2d 1368, 1384 (3d Cir.  1991) \n(Section 504). The Supreme Court in Olmstead made it clear that the state cannot discriminate \nbetween people with disabilities while providing such care for \"categorically needy\" persons. 3 \n3  The ADA also prohibits discrimination against different categories of people \nbetween people with disabilities while providing such care for \"categorically needy\" persons \n4 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 5 of 20 PageID 26\nTitle II of the ADA prohibits public entities from discriminating against persons with \ndisabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12132.4  A \"qualified individual with a disability\" is a person who \"with \nor without reasonable modifications to rules, polices or practices\" meets the \"essential eligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by \na public entity.\" 42  U.S.C.  §  12132(2).  Defendants do  not dispute that Plaintiff Jones is  a \nqualified person with a disability who meets the eligibility requirements for Florida's Medicaid \nnursing home \"level of care\" as well as for its waiver and Medicaid programs. \nC.  The ADA and Section 504's Integration Mandate \nUnder both the ADA and Section 504, the Attorney General was directed to promulgate \nimplementing regulations.  42  U.S.C.  §  12134(a);  29  U.S.C.  §  794(a).  See  Helen  L.,  supra. \nCongress  further  directed  that  the  regulations  promulgated  under  Title  II  of the  ADA  be \nconsistent with the regulations adopted under Section 504. 42 U.S.C. §12134(b). For purposes of \nimplementing Title II  of the ADA,  the Attorney General promulgated a regulation requiring \nwith disabilities. Townsendv. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511 (9th Cir. 2003), Helen L., supra. In \nTownsend, the plaintiffs alleged that the state was using Medicaid's home and community based \nwaiver services (\"HCBS\") to provide essential long term care to some residents with disabilities, \nbut not to others. The Court held that the state violated the ADA by denying community-based \nlong term care for \"medically needy\" persons. \n4 \nSimilarly, Section 504 prohibits the recipients of federal funds from \ndiscriminating on the basis of disability: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, \nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving \nFederal financial assistance .... \n29 U.S.C. §794(a). \n5 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 6 of 20 PageID 27\npublic entities to \"administer services, programs and activities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). The \nregulation was  based upon virtually  identical regulatory  language promulgated to  implement \nSection  504  with  respect  to  federal  financial  recipients.  28  C.F.R.  §  41.5 1( d).  These  two \nregulations, known as the \"integration mandate,\" are construed and applied in the same manner. \nFisher v.  Oklahoma Health Care Auth., 335 F.3d 1175, 1179 n.3 (lOth Cir. 2003). \nThe  integration mandate was analyzed and interpreted by the United  States  Supreme \nCourt  in  the  landmark decision  of Olmstead v.  L.e.,  527  U.S.  581  (1999).  The  Olmstead \nplaintiffs  were  individuals  with  mental  disabilities  who  were  confined  in  Georgia's  state \npsychiatric institutions, but who wanted to  live in the community. Plaintiffs asserted that the \nstate's refusal to pay for them to live in community settings violated the integration mandate of \nTitle II of the ADA and its implementing regulations. The Court was thus presented with the \nquestion of whether the proscription of disability discrimination may require the placement of \nindividuals with disabilities in community settings rather than institutions. Id at 587. \nThe Court began its analysis by citing the relevant Congressional findings that serve as \nthe underpinnings for the ADA: \n(2)  historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with \ndisabilities, and despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination \nagainst individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive \nsocietal problem; \n(3)  discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical \nareas as .. .institutionalization ... ; \n(5)  individuals  with  disabilities  continually  encounter  various  forms  of \ndiscrimination.  including outright intentional exclusion .. failure  to make \nreasonable  modifications  to  existing  facilities  and  practices.  [and] \nsegregation ... \n42 U.S.C. §12101(a)(2), (3) & (5) (emphasis added) (quoted in Olmstead, 527 U.S.at 588-89). \n6 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 7 of 20 PageID 28\nThe Court's decision was premised on the DOJ integration regulation: \nA public entity shall  administer services, programs,  and activities in the most \nintegrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  qualified  individuals  with \ndisabilities. \n28 C.F.R.§ 35.130(d). \nAfter noting the  comprehensive  scope of discrimination embraced by the ADA,  the \nOlmstead Court explained the nature of discrimination prohibited by Title II of the ADA in the \ncontext of the integration mandate: \nRecognition that unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a \nform  of  discrimination  reflects  two  evident  judgments.  First,  institutional \nplacement  of persons  who  can  handle  and benefit from  community  settings \nperpetuates  unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or \nunworthy  of  participating  in  community  life.  Second,  confinement  in  an \ninstitution severely diminishes the everyday life activities ofi ndividuals, including \nfamily  relations.  social  contacts,  work  options,  economic  independence. \neducational advancement and cultural enrichment.  Dissimilar treatment exists in \nthe key respect:  In  order to  receive needed  medical services,  persons with ... \ndisabilities  must,  because  of  those  disabilities,  relinquish  participation  in \ncommunity  life  they  could  enjoy  given  reasonable  accommodations,  while \npersons without [such]  disabilities can receive the medical services they need \nwithout similar sacrifice. \n527  U.S.  at 600-601  (citations omitted; emphasis added).  Accordingly, the Court concluded, \nmore  than  nine  years  ago,  that  \"unjustified  isolation,  we  hold,  is  properly  regarded  as \ndiscrimination based on disability.\" Id at 597. \nThe  facts  of the  case  at  bar  clearly  demonstrate  that  Plaintiff Jones  will  suffer \ndiscrimination.  By living at home and participating in the community, she has been able to \nexperience  and  benefit  from  church  activities,  family  relations,  social  contacts,  educational \nadvancement,  and  cultural  enrichment  of which  the  Supreme  Court  spoke.  Being  forced \nunnecessarily to move to a nursing home solely to receive the personal attendant care services \n7 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 8 of 20 PageID 29\nthat Plaintiff Jones needs for her activities of daily living constitutes discrimination. Defendants' \nrefusal to provide Medicaid funds for her in the community and its policies and failure to grant a \nreasonable  modification  for  her  to  its  existing  Medicaid  programs  plainly  falls  within  the \ndisability discrimination condemned by the Supreme Court in Olmstead. It also illustrates Judge \nFerguson's conclusion that \"underfunding of the Home and Community-Based Waiver program \ncompels institutionalization, thus negating a meaningful choice.\" Cramer v. Chiles, 33 F.Supp.2d \n1342, 1353 (S.D. Fla. 1999). \nPlaintiff Jones is at imminent risk of being forced into a nursing home. She will lose \nindependence in order to receive the necessary services so she can meet her activities of daily \nliving. Such an outcome would both violate the ADA and Section 504, and result in irreparable \ninjury to her right to live in the \"the most integrated setting appropriate\" to her needs. She would \nbe  forced  to  leave  her  friends  and  family  behind.  In  a  nursing  home,  she  will  lose  her \nindependence. In a nursing home, she will not be able to participate as intensively or regularly \nwith her religious activities and will likely be further removed from her parents with whom she \npresently resides. \nTo prevent discrimination, both the ADA and Section 504 integration mandate requires \nservices \"in the most integrated setting appropriate.\" There can be no doubt that for Plaintiff \nJones that setting is her own home. The ADA and Section 504 prohibit conditioning receipt of a \npublic service  or program on a person being institutionalized.  That was the bedrock of the \nOlmstead decision. \nThe risk of institutionalization that Plaintiff Jones faces is discrimination. In Fisher v. \nOklahoma Health  Care Auth., 335  F.  3d  1175  (lOth Cir.  2003), Oklahoma had changed its \n8 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 9 of 20 PageID 30\nMedicaid prescription program so that persons in the community would be entitled to receive no \nmore than five prescriptions per month. However, if persons resided in a nursing facility, they \ncould receive whatever nwnber of prescriptions they required. The Fisher Circuit emphasized \nthat \"failure to provide Medicaid services in a community-based setting may constitute a form of \ndiscrimination.\"  Id.  at  1182.  The  Tenth  Circuit  noted  that  the  protections  in  the  ADA's \n\"integration regulation,\" 28 C.F.R. §35.130(d), \nwould  be  meaningless  if plaintiffs  were  required  to  segregate  themselves  by \nentering an institution before they could challenge an allegedly discrimination law \nor policy that threatens to force them into segregated isolation. [W]hile it is true \nthat plaintiffs in Olmstead were institutionalized at the time they brought their \nclaim,  nothing  in  the  Olmstead  decision  supports  a  conclusion  that \ninstitutionalization  is  a  prerequisite  to  enforcement of the  ADA's  integration \nrequirements. \nId.  at 1181. See also Radaszewski v.  Maram, 383  F.3d 599, 611  (7th Cir. 2004), Crabtree v. \nGoetz, 2008 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 103097 (MD IN, December 19, 2008). \nThis same principle applies to Plaintiff Jones. In the community, she currently receives \nno Medicaid-funded personal attendant care services to assist her with her activities of daily \nliving. If she is forced to enter a nursing home in order to receive these services, she will be \n\"unnecessarily institutionalized,\" precisely the type of discrimination that Congress intended to \nend with the enactment of the ADA and Section 504. By requiring Plaintiff Jones to move to a \nnursing facility to receive the  same services she could receive in the community, Florida is \nconditioning the receipt of these Medicaid services to a setting, i.e., the nursing facility, which is \nsegregated, instead of providing them to her in the community. \nD.  Defendants Violate the ADA and Section 504 by Failing to Make Reasonable \nModifications  and  Accommodations  in  their  Policies.  Practices.  and \nProcedures \n9 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 10 of 20 PageID 31\nSection 504 and the ADA prohibit actions by covered entities that have a discriminatory \neffect on people with disabilities. See Alexander v.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 297; Frederick L.  v. \nDepartment of Public WeI/are, 364 F.3d 487 (3d Cir. 2004),422 F.3d 151 (3d 2005). Both the \nADA and Section 504 affirmatively require that covered entities make reasonable modifications \nand accommodations to their policies and practices when necessary to accommodate individuals \nwith disabilities, see Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 592; Alexander. 469 U.S. at 301, and require that \npeople with disabilities have \"meaningful access\" to covered entities' programs. Id.; Chaffin v. \nKansas State Fair Bd., 348 F.3d 850, 857 (lOth Cir. 2003). \nIn  the  present  action,  Defendants'  failure  to  make  reasonable  modifications  and \naccommodations results in Plaintiff Jones not having \"meaningful access\" to  either Florida's \nMedicaid waiver programs or its Medicaid personal care services benefits. Because Florida has \nrestricted  its  Medicaid  personal  care  services  benefits,  42  USC  §  1396d(a)(24),  to  persons \nresiding in assisted living facilities, Plaintiff Jones is not able to benefit from either Florida's \nMedicaid waiver program or its Medicaid personal care services program.  Similarly, because \nFlorida has capped its TBI/SCI waiver and has not increased it to meet Ms. Jones' needs in the \ncommunity,  an accommodation that is easy to accomplish,  Florida's Medicaid program  refuses \nto make the reasonable modification and accommodation in this program which will ensure Ms. \nJones remains in her home and is not discriminated against. \nBeginning with Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397,410 (1979), the \ncourts have recognized that Section 504 requires publicly funded programs to provide reasonable \nmodifications and accommodations when  needed to  assure  that people with disabilities have \nmeaningful access to its programs and services. See Alexander. 469 U.S. at 300-01 & n.20-21. \n10 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 11 of 20 PageID 32\nTitle II of the ADA requires: \nA  public  entity  shall  make  reasonable  modifications  in  policiest practicest or \nprocedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the \nbasis  of disabilityt  unless  the  public  entity can  demonstrate  that  making  the \nmodifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the servicet program or \nactivity. \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) (authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 12134(b)). \nThe  concept of reasonable  modification  recognizes  that strictly  \"equaltt  treatment of \npeople with disabilities will not assure meaningful access. See Henrietta D.  v.  Bloomberg 331 \nt \nF.3d  26C  273t  274-75  (2d  Cir.  2003).  AccordinglYt  the  ADA  and  Section  504  require \naccommodations  assuring  that  otherwise  neutral  policies  and  practices  do  nott  in  practicet \ndiscriminate against people with disabilities by denying them meaningful access to the covered \nentity's programs and services. Id.;  see also  US Ainvays,  Inc.  v.  Barnett 535  U.S.  391t 397 \nt \n(2002) (in ADA employment discrimination case, \"preferences will sometimes prove necessary \nto achieve the Act's basic equal opportunity goal\"). For examplet Section 504 and the ADA also \nprohibit discrimination on the basis of the severity of a personts disability. In Jackson v.  Fort \nStanton Hosp.  & Training School 757 F.  Supp.  1243 (D.N.M.  1990)t rev'd on other grounds, \nt \n964  F.2d  980  (lOth  Cir.  I 992)t  plaintiffs  with  developmental  disabilities  challenged  their \nexclusion  from  the  state's  community  services  program  because  of the  severity  of their \ndisabilities. In that caset people with severe disabilities were precluded from living in community \nsettings because the programs lacked amenities that could be  reasonably furnished that were \nnecessary to  accommodate their serious needs.  The  Court found that \"Defendants'  failure to \naccommodate  the  severely handicapped  in  existing community programs while serving  less \nseverely handicapped peers is unreasonable and discriminatory.\" Id at 1299.  It concluded that: \nII \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 12 of 20 PageID 33\nmodifications of the existing community service system in New Mexico would \nnot require an excessive financial burden and  that the accommodations would \nenable  severely  handicapped  residents  of [residential  facilities]  to  realize  the \nbenefits of community settings. AccordinglYt the defendants should require those \ncommunity programs that receive federal  assistance funds to make reasonable \naccommodations for those severely handicapped residents [of facilities]  whose \nIDTs  have  determined  that  a  community  program  could  be  appropriatet  if \nreasonably modified. \n[d.  at 1299. See also Williams v.  Wasserman, 937 F. Supp. 524,530 (D. Md. 1996) (\"while the \nADA does not place an affirmative obligation on the state to create or fundamentally alter a \nprogram of community-based treatment options, the ADA does oblige the defendants to make \nthose options available to otherwise qualified individuals without regard to the severity ... of \ntheir  disabilities\");  Marlin  v.  Voinovich,  840  F.  Supp.  1175,  1192  (S.D.  Ohio  1993) \n(\"Defendants' failure to accommodate the severely handicapped in existing community programs \nwhile serving less severely handicapped peers is unreasonable and discriminatory\"). \nA recent reasonable accommodation case from the Seventh Circuit is quite instructive. In \nRadaszewski v.  Maram,  383  F.3d 599 (7th Cir.  2004), plaintiff sought 24 hour private duty \nnursing care under the HCBS waiver program, a service he alleged he would require in a hospital \nor nursing facility if forced to move there. The State argued that it did not provide that level of \nservice under its waiver, and that plaintiff could only receive $4,593 per month - the equivalent \nof five hours a day of private-duty nursing care. However, the court found that the state already \nprovided for some private duty nursing care, and further that \nthe  integration  mandate  may  well  require  the  State  to  make  reasonable \nmodifications  to  the  form  of existing  services  in  order  to  adapt  them  to \ncommunity-integrated settings .... If variations in the way services were delivered \nin  different  settings  [home  vs.  institution,  or  assisted  living  facility  vs.  an \napartment] were enough to defeat a demand for more community integrated care, \nthen the integration mandate of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act would mean \nvery little. \n12 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 13 of 20 PageID 34\nId at 611. \nOn remand, the district court found that the state's failure to fully fund at home, private \nduty  nursing  for  the  young  man  under  the  Medicaid-funded  HCBS  constituted  disability \ndiscrimination,  and  that the  state  was obligated to provide treatment in the most integrated \nsetting  - his  home.  It  rejected  the  state's  claim  that  such  an  outcome  would  result  in  a \nfundamental alteration of the state's program. Radaszewski v.  Maram, 2008 WL 2097382, *15 \n(N.D. Ill., March 26, 2008); see also Grooms v.  Maram 2008 WL 2271492, *16 (N.D. Ill., May \n30,2008). \nE.  Plaintiff Jones's Modification Requests Are Reasonable. \nIt is well-established that the ADA and Section 504 both require Defendants to make \nreasonable modifications and accommodations to their policies, practices, and procedures when \nnecessary to avoid discrimination. 42 U.S.C.  § 12132; 28  C.F.R.  § 35.130(b)(7) (ADA). In a \nreasonable accommodation and modification claim, it is the plaintiff s obligation to articulate a \nmodification that \"seems reasonable on its face.\" US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 u.S. 391, 401 \n(2002); see also Skerski v. Time Warner Cable Co., 257 F.3d 273, 284 (3d Cir. 2001) (\"plaintiff \nbears only the burden of identifying an accommodation, the costs of which do not clearly exceed \nits  benefits,\"  i.e.,  that  is  not  \"clearly  ineffectively  or outlandishly  costly\").  If the  plaintiff \narticulates a reasonable modification, then the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that the \nproposed  modification  would  impose  an  undue  burden  on  its  resources  or a  fundamental \nalteration of its program. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603; Frederick L., 364 F.3d at 492 n.4. \nDefendants have ignored this obligation to  Plaintiff Jones  by not providing her with \npersonal attendant care services either through their Medicaid TBI/SCI waiver or through their \n13 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 14 of 20 PageID 35\nMedicaid  personal  care  services  program.  Defendants obtained  pennission from  the  federal \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) to have a Medicaid TBI/SCI waiver which pennitted \nFlorida with  the  option  under Medicaid  of providing home  and  community based services, \nincluding  in-home  care  provided  by  personal  attendants,  to  a person  who  would otherwise \nrequire  nursing home  level  care.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n( c)(I) (\"but for  the  provision of such \n[waiver]  services  the  individuals  would  require  the  level  of care  provided  in  ...  a  nursing \nfacility ...  the  cost of which would  be reimbursed  under the  State plan\").  When Defendants \nobtained this Medicaid waiver, they took on the mandatory obligation to provide such in-home \ncare to qualifying individuals such as Plaintiff Jones. Defendants have failed to increase the \nnumber of Medicaid TBI/SCI waiver slots so that Plaintiff Jones could reside in the community \ninstead of in a nursing facility.  Similarly, Defendants have restricted their Medicaid personal \ncare services benefits, 42 USC § 1396d(a)(24), to persons residing in assisted living facilities. \nDefendants could easily expand this program to  persons who  reside in their own homes and \napartments. \nPlaintiff Jones  has  done  all  she can  to  live  integrated  into  the  community.  She  has \nreceived attendant care services from her parents for as long as they could provide the care and \nservices. She does not have money to pay for personal care services. \nThe  reasonableness  of  a  particular  accommodation  \"depends  on  the  individual \ncircumstances of each case\" and \"requires a fact-specific, individualized analysis of the disabled \nindividual's circumstances and accommodations that might allow her to meet the program's \nstandards.\" Wong v. Regents o/the Univ. o/Cal.,192 F.3d 807, 818 (9th Cir. 1999). \nPlaintiff Jones has identified the specific program modifications and accommodations she \n14 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 15 of 20 PageID 36\nseeks. She has asked Defendants, as a reasonable accommodation of her disability, to provide \nMedicaid payments, under either their Medicaid TBI/SCI waiver or Medicaid personal care \nservices programs, for care and services with her daily living activities.  Were she to enter a \nnursing home, Defendants' per diem reimbursement to Medicaid nursing facilities is  $178.45 a \nday or $5,353.50 a month. Under the federal requirements for a waiver, a state must assure the \nfederal agency that the waiver is \"cost effective,\" that is, on the average, the amount spent on \ncommunity-based services \"will not exceed the amount of such medical assistance provided for \nsuch individual [in the nursing facility] if the waiver did not apply.\" 42 USC § 1396n(c)(4)(A). If \nDefendants were to provide her with services under the TBI/SCI waiver, they would save more \nthan $20,000 a year. The reasonable accommodations that Plaintiff Jones requests fall squarely \nwithin the existing duties already assigned to Florida under the HCBS Waiver. \nSimilarly, under Florida's Medicaid program that provides personal care services, see 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396d(a)(24), Defendants limit these services to persons who reside in an assisted living \ncomplex. The reasonable accommodation Plaintiff Jones requests is that the same service be \nprovided to her in her own home instead of in an assisted living facility. That would allow her to \nhire and pay with Medicaid funds personal attendants who would provide the level of care that \nshe needs. As this is a practice that Defendants have approved for persons who reside in assisted \nliving facilities, it could not be an undue burden to extend the practice so that Plaintiff Jones can \ncontinue to reside in her home. \nIII.  Irreparable Injury \nIt is  well established that the  loss  of Medicaid benefits constitutes irreparable harm. \n15 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 16 of 20 PageID 37\nIndeed, \"[t]he nature of the claim - a claim against the state for medical services - makes it \nimpossible to say that any remedy at law could compensate\" plaintiffs. McMillan v. McCrimon. \n807 F. Supp. 475,479 (C.D. III.  1992). See also Maine Ass'n of Interdependent Neighborhoods \nv. Petit. 647 F. Supp. 1312, 1315 (D.Me. 1986) (court found that absent the requested injunction \nplaintiff would be forced to leave her family and enter a nursing home, irreparably injuring her \nphysical and mental health). Accord Edmonds v.  Levine, 417 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1342 (S.D. Fla. \n2006) (denial of medical benefits, and resulting loss of medical services, constitutes irreparable \nharm); Mitson v.  Coler,  670 F. Supp.  1568, 1577 (S.D. Fla.  1987)(potential denial of nursing \nhome service constituted irreparable injury since many in class would be deprived of essential \nmedical care); Kai v.  Ross,  336 F.3d 650, 656 (8th Cir.  2003) (denial of Medicaid benefits \nconstitutes \"a danger to plaintiffs' health, even their lives\"); Massachusetts Ass'n of Older Amer. \nv.  Sharp,  700 F.2d 749, 753 (1st Cir.  1983) (termination of benefits that causes individuals to \nforgo medical care is clearly irreparable harm); Beltran v. Meyers, 677 F.2d 1317, 1322 (9th Cir. \n1982) (irreparable injury is shown when enforcement of a Medicaid rule \"may deny [plaintiffs] \nneeded medical care\"); Caldwell v.  Blum.  621  F.2d 491, 498 (2d Cir.  1980), cert.  denied,  452 \nU.S.  909  (1981)  (Medicaid applicants established harm where they would  \"absent relief, be \nexposed to the hardship of being denied essential medical benefits\"). \nIf a preliminary injunction is not issued, Plaintiff Jones will not be able to continue to live \nat home. She will have no option other than to enter to a nursing home and suffer all the injuries \nlisted in Olmstead.  Such discrimination and irreparable injury are unnecessary, if defendants \nwould only authorize Mr. Jones personal attendant services either under its Medicaid waiver or \nMedicaid personal care services programs. The irreparable injury includes more than a violation \n16 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 17 of 20 PageID 38\nof her civil rights under the ADA and Section 504. The irreparable injury is that she will be \ninstitutionalized in a setting that demeans her by taking away her independence and dignity. \nIV.  Balance of Hardships \nThe Court must weigh the harm to Plaintiff Jones against possible damage to Defendants. \nMicshel-Trapaga  v.  City of Gainesville,  907  F.  Supp.  1508,  1513  (N.D.  Fla.  1995).  While \nPlaintiff Jones is threatened with institutionalization, Defendants' only possible damages are \nmonetary.  The harm to Plaintiff Jones here clearly outweighs any harm to Defendants. See, e.g., \nEdmonds,  417 F. Supp. 2d at 1342 (harm to plaintiffs of being deprived of essential medical \nservices outweighs any harm to state); Illinois Hosp. Ass'n v. Illinois Dep't ofP  ublic Aid, 576 F. \nSupp.  360, 371  (N.D.  III.  1983)  (\"once  a state has  voluntarily elected to  participate in the \nMedicaid program ... [it cannot] characterize its duty to comply with the requirements of [the \nprogram] as constituting a hardship to its citizens\"); Kansas Hosp.  Ass'n v.  Whiteman,  835 F. \nSupp.  1548, 1552-53 (D. Kan.  1993) (threatened injuries to plaintiffs outweighed any harm to \ndefendant  that would  result from  issuing  the  temporary restraining  order because  changing \nMedicaid  coverage  \"significantly  alters  the  status  quo  to  the  detriment  of the  individual \nplaintiffs, while its positive budgetary impact on state coffers is negligible in a relative sense\"). \nThe balance of hardships clearly favors Plaintiff Jones in this case. All that she is asking \nis that Defendants spend less of their Medicaid funds and permit her to continue to reside in her \nhome  with  the  personal  attendants  she  needs  to  accomplish  her  activities  of daily  living. \nProviding  the  requested  accommodation  falls  squarely  within  the  duties  imposed  upon \nDefendants by either the Medicaid waiver or the Medicaid personal care option. \nBy  contrast,  if Plaintiff Jones  must  leave  her  home  and  go  to  a  nursing  facility, \n17 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 18 of 20 PageID 39\nDefendants will  expend more Medicaid  funds  than they would  were she in the community. \nFurther,  Plaintiff Jones would be  institutionalized despite the fact  that she  has  successfully \nresided in the community since she became disabled nearly 18 years ago .. \nPlainly, the balance of hardships tips in favor of Plaintiff Jones. \nv. \nThe Public Interest \nA  preliminary  injunction  to  provide  services  to  Plaintiff  Jones  to  avoid \ninstitutionalization is not adverse to the public interest. In determining whether the public interest \nwill be dis served by the granting of a request for preliminary injunction, courts may look to the \nlegislative intent in enacting the statute sought to be enforced. As the Eleventh Circuit found in \nJohnson v.  US.D.A .• 734 F.2d 774, 788 (11 th Cir.l984), cost to the government \"alone\" is not a \nreason to deny a preliminary injunction as being against the public interest. In a case challenging \nforeclosure procedures, the court looked at the legislative purposes of the Housing Act of 1949 \nand found that the public interest of providing decent housing would be served by preventing \npremature foreclosures. ld \nThe public interest also will be served by an order granting a preliminary injunction for \nPlaintiff Jones. There is a strong public policy expressed in the ADA and Section 504. Congress \nfound  that  discrimination  against  people  with  disabilities  is  a  serious  and  pervasive  social \nproblem, and that people with disabilities have been subjected to a history of purposeful unequal \ntreatment and relegated to a position of political powerlessness based on characteristics that are \nbeyond the control of such individuals and resulting from stereotypical assumptions not truly \nindicative of the individual ability of such persons to participate in and contribute to society. 42 \nU.S.C. §1210l. The purpose of the ADA's passage was to provide a clear and comprehensive \n18 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 19 of 20 PageID 40\nnational  mandate  for  elimination  of  discrimination  against  individuals  with  disabilities. \nAccordingly, it serves the public interest to issue the requested preliminary injunctive relief. \nVI.  Waiving the Bond Requirement \nPlaintiffs should be exempted from the bond requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P.65(c). The \namount of required security is within the discretion of the trial court. Bell South, 425 F.3d at 971; \nCaterpillar, Inc.  v.  Nationwide Equipment, 877 F .Supp. 611, 61  7 (M.D. Fla. 1994); Baldree v. \nCargill, Inc., 758 F.Supp. 704 (M.D. Fla. 1990), affd, 925 F.2d 1474 (lIth Cir. 1991). The court \nmay also waive all payment. \nCourts have used their discretion to waive the bond requirement for indigent plaintiffs. \nE.g.,  Bass v.  Richardson,  338 F.  Supp. 478, 490 (E.D.N.Y.  1971) (\"It is clear that indigents, \nsuing individually or as class plaintiffs, ordinarily should not be required to post a bond under \nRule 65(c)\"); Denny v. Shealth & Social Servo  Bd. a/State a/Wis., 285 F. Supp. 526, 527 (E.D. \nWis.  1968) (\"Poor persons ... are by hypothesis unable to furnish security as contemplated in \nRule  65( c),  and  the  court  should  order  no  security  in  connection  with  the  preliminary \ninjunction.\"). See also Maine Ass'n 0/ Interdependent Neighborhoods,  647 F.  Supp. at  1319 \n(court granted waiver of bond, noting impecunious status of plaintiffs, and based on plaintiffs \nstrong case on the merits). \nPlaintiff Jones is indigent and seeks injunctive relief to receive services in the community \nthat Defendants already provide in nursing homes. The case implicates the public interest and the \nbalance of hardships tips sharply in favor of the Plaintiff. This Court should not require Plaintiff \nJones to give security. \nVII.  Conclusion \n19 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 3    Filed 12/02/09   Page 20 of 20 PageID 41\nFor the reasons and on the authority cited above, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this \nHonorable  Court grant  her preliminary  injunctive relief.  She has demonstrated a  substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits; that she will suffer irreparable injury in the event emergency \nrelief is denied; and that the balance of hardships tip in her favor. \nRespectfully submitted, \nStephen F.

ANNA VIAMONTE ROSS, \nin  her  official  capacity  as  Secretary,  Florida  Department  of  Health,  by  undersigned \ncounsel, hereby move pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and (6), Fed. R. Civ. P., to dismiss this \ncause for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, failure to state a claim upon which relief can \nbe granted, and because the claims are barred by issue or claim preclusion.  As grounds \ntherefore, Defendants state as follows: \n  1.  On December 15, 2009, Plaintiff Jones filed an amended complaint, which \nwas  served  on  Defendants  on  the  same  date  via  the  CM/ECF  system  (Amended \n1 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 2 of 17 PageID 144\nComplaint).  The Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants violate Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (ADA), and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (Rehab Act) by denying in-home health services to \nPlaintiff Jones and a putative class of similarly-situated persons.1  \n  2.  This  Court  should  dismiss  Plaintiffs‟  Amended  Complaint.   Plaintiff \nJones‟ case is moot, because Defendants are currently in the process of enrolling Plaintiff \nJones in the Traumatic Brain Injury / Spinal Cord Injury Medicaid Waiver Program \n(TBI/SCI Waiver Program).  Affidavit of Kristen Russell.  Because the named plaintiff‟s \ncase became moot prior to certification of the class2, the action is moot and must be \ndismissed. \n  3.  This Court should dismiss the Amended Complaint pursuant to pursuant \nto Rule 12(b)(1) and (6), Fed. R. Civ. P.. \n  4.  Even if this Court were to find that Plaintiff Jones‟ case is not moot, or \nthat the mootness of Plaintiff Jones‟ case does not render the entire action moot, the \nAmended Complaint should still be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., \nbecause the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \n                     \n1 The putative class consists of Florida disabled residents with a spinal cord injury who are Medicaid \nrecipients; reside in the community; desire to continue to reside in the community instead of a nursing \nfacility; could reside in the community with appropriate Medicaid-funded services; and are at risk of being \nforced to enter a nursing home because Defendants do not provide adequate community-based services.  ¶ \n34 of Amended Complaint. \n \n2 Plaintiff Jones‟ case became moot prior even to any motion for certification of the putative class. \n2 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 3 of 17 PageID 145\n  5.  Plaintiffs‟  claim  for  the  provision  of  community-based  personal  care \nservices exceeds the scope of the ADA, because the applicable statute and implementing \nregulations do not require provision of the services sought by the Amended Complaint. \n  6.  Plaintiffs‟ requested class remedy would result in a fundamental alteration \nof the Florida Medicaid Program, which the ADA does not require. \n  7.  Plaintiff‟s claims, both individually and on behalf of a putative class, are \nbarred by issue or claim preclusion (or collateral estoppel) in that, by the Settlement \nAgreement and Final Order in Dubois v. Levine, Case No. 4:03-CV-107-SPM,  Plaintiff \nimpermissibly seeks to relitigate issues disposed of in that class action litigation. \n8.  As further support for this Motion, the Defendants direct this Court to the \nfollowing Memorandum of Law, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by \nreference. \nMEMORANDUM OF LAW \nI.  The Amended Complaint Should Be Dismissed Because Plaintiff Jones’ Case \nis Moot \n \nPlaintiff Jones‟ case is moot.  According to the December 18, 2009, Affidavit of \nKristen Russell, the Medicaid Waiver Administrator for the State of Florida‟s TBI/SCI \nWaiver Program, Defendants are currently in the process of enrolling Plaintiff Jones onto \nthe TBI/SCI Waiver Program.  A home visit was conducted by TBI/SCI Waiver Program \npersonnel with Plaintiff Jones to discuss her needs on December 17, 2009.  Affidavit of \nKristen Russell, ¶ 2.C.  On December 18, 2009, TBI/SCI Waiver Program personnel \nmailed documents to Plaintiff Jones to be completed by her physician, so that a formal \n3 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 4 of 17 PageID 146\ndetermination of her eligibility for TBI/SCI Waiver Program services could be made by \nthe Department of Elder Affairs, Comprehensive Assessment and Referral for Long Term \nCare Services program (CARES), the entity responsible for determinations of eligibility \nfor community based services in lieu of nursing home services.  Id., ¶ 2.D.  Once such a \ndetermination is made, TBI/SCI Waiver Program personnel will develop a plan of care \nand authorize services based upon Plaintiff Jones‟ needs and the service limitations of the \nTBI/SCI Waiver Program established by rule and law.  Id.  It is anticipated that CARES \nwill generate a Notification of Level of Care within 15 business days of receipt of the \ncompleted documentation from Plaintiff Jones‟ physician, and that Plaintiff Jones can \nexpect to begin receiving services within 5 business days of Defendants‟ receipt of a \npositive CARES Notification of Level of Care.  Id., ¶ 2.E.  Ms. Russell stated that she is \n“unaware of any factors that would suggest that Ms. Jones will not be placed in the \n[TBI/SCI Waiver Program]” once the required processes have been completed.  Id., ¶ 2.F. \nEven though Plaintiff Jones is not yet receiving services from the TBI/SCI Waiver \nProgram as of the date of this Motion, her case is moot now.  Even if the Court were to \norder Defendants to place Plaintiff Jones on the TBI/SCI Waiver Program, the standard \nprocess of determination of eligibility, assessment of needs, and authorization of services \nwould still have to take place.  Defendants are already doing what Plaintiff Jones is \nasking the Court to order them to do: assessing the services and supports that would \nenable Plaintiff Jones to remain in the community and ensuring that Plaintiff Jones has \naccess to Medicaid-covered services (for which she is eligible) that will meet her needs in \n4 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 5 of 17 PageID 147\nthe community.  Amended Complaint, ¶ 51, 54.  There is no case or controversy before \nthe Court with respect to Plaintiff Jones.  As such, her case is moot. \nIn a class action proceeding, once the class has been certified mootness of the \nclass representative‟s claim does not necessarily moot the entire action.  Sosna v. Iowa, \n419 U.S. 393 (U.S. 1975).  However, where, as here, the named plaintiffs‟ case is mooted \nbefore the class is duly certified in accordance with Rule 23, Fed. R. Civ. P., the entire \naction is moot.  Board of School Comm'rs v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 129 (U.S. 1975).  This \nis the law in the Eleventh Circuit.  See Tucker v. Phyfer, 819 F.2d 1030, 1033 (11th Cir. \nAla. 1987) (“In a class action, the claim of the named plaintiff, who seeks to represent the \nclass, must be live both at the time he brings suit and when the district court determines \nwhether to certify the putative class. If the plaintiff's claim is not live, the court lacks a \njusticiable controversy and must dismiss the claim as moot”).  In the instant case, the \nnamed plaintiff‟s case was mooted before any motion to certify was even filed with the \nCourt.  As such, there is no case or controversy before the Court at this time and the \nCourt should dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P. \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Claims for Community-Based Personal Care Services under the \nADA and the Rehab Act Fail to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be \nGranted Because the ADA Does Not Require a Public Entity to Provide \nServices of a Personal Nature \n \nThe entire premise of the Amended Complaint is undermined by the fact that the \nregulations promulgated pursuant to Title II of the ADA specifically provide that public \nentities do not have to provide services of the nature which Plaintiff is demanding.  The \nspecific services the Plaintiff is demanding in her Amended Complaint include assistance \n5 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 6 of 17 PageID 148\ntransferring from her bed to her wheelchair and from her wheelchair back to her bed, \nassistance dressing, grooming, toileting, personal hygiene, food preparation, cleaning her \nroom, and assistance being turned twice a night to prevent decubitus ulcers. Amended \nComplaint, ¶¶ 21, 24.  Plaintiff contends that both the ADA and Rehab Act require the \nprovision of personal care services.  This is not the case. \nTitle II of the ADA states that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by \nreason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of \nthe services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by \nany such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Title II also prescribes remedies available for a \nviolation of the above provision and authorizes the Attorney General to promulgate \nimplementing regulations.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12133, 12134. \n  Several regulatory provisions promulgated pursuant to Title II of the ADA are of \nparticular relevance in this case.  First, there is the “integration mandate” of 28 C.F.R. § \n35.130(d), upon which Plaintiff heavily relies, which states that “[a] public entity shall \nadminister services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to \nthe needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  Second, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7), \nstates that “[a] public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or \nprocedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of \ndisability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would \nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”  Finally, and most \nimportantly, 28 C.F.R. § 35.135 states that the ADA regulations do “not require a public \n6 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 7 of 17 PageID 149\nentity  to  provide  to  individuals  with  disabilities…services  of  a  personal  nature \nincluding assistance in eating, toileting, or dressing” (emphasis added). \nPlaintiff wants the Courts to enforce one regulatory provision while ignoring \nanother that specifically excludes the requested services from the scope of the first.  \nFlorida is required to administer its services “in the most integrated setting appropriate,” \nbut this cannot be read to require the Florida Medicaid Program to provide “services of a \npersonal nature,” which is precisely the kind of services Plaintiff is requesting here.3  The \nADA does not require the provision of these services. \nIt is anticipated that Plaintiff will argue that 28 C.F.R. § 35.135 only operates if \nthe state is not already providing personal care services in institutions.  Once a state \nprovides personal care services in an institution, according to the anticipated argument, \nthe “integration mandate” of 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) kicks in and requires the state to \nprovide those services in the community.  However, that is not what the regulation \nactually says.  It says that “[t]his part,” meaning Title 28, Part 35, Code of Federal \nRegulations, which includes the “integration mandate,” “does not require a public \nentity to provide to individuals with disabilities… services of a personal nature including \nassistance in eating, toileting, or dressing.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.135.  This regulation is not \nambiguous.  There are no disputed terms.  As such, the regulation is not subject to \ninterpretation by the Court or any administrative agency.  It must be given its plain \nmeaning.  As the Eleventh Circuit stated in Charter Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass‟n v. Office of \n                     \n3 While the TBI/SCI Waiver Program does indeed provide “services of a personal nature,” it is not required \nto do so by the ADA‟s integration mandate. \n7 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 8 of 17 PageID 150\nThrift Supervision, 912 F.2d 1569, 1580-1 (11th Cir. 1990), “where the language selected \nby the drafters is clear and unequivocal, the courts are bound to give effect to the plain \nmeaning of the chosen words [of a regulation] and no duty of interpretation arises.” Id., \nciting KCMC, Inc. v. FCC, 600 F.2d 546, 549 (5th Cir. 1979).  \nThe appendix to 28 C.F.R. § 35.130 clarifies that a public entity is not required to \nprovide  personal  care  services  “except  in  special  circumstances,  such  as  where  the \nindividual is an inmate of a custodial or correctional institution.”  28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. \nA, Subpart B, §35.130.  Would the Plaintiff argue that a state that provides personal care \nservices in a correctional institution is required by the integration mandate to provide \nsuch services in the community?  This would be an absurd result, completely nullifying \n28 C.F.R. § 35.135 of any effect. \nThe entire premise of Plaintiff‟s Amended Complaint, which is that the Florida \nMedicaid  Program  is  required  to  provide  personal  care  services  as  a  result  of  the \nintegration mandate, is undermined by 28 C.F.R. § 35.135.  The Amended Complaint \nthus fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and should be dismissed \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P. \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Requested Class Remedy Fails to State a Claim Upon Which Relief \nCan Be Granted Because It Would Result in an Impermissible Fundamental \nAlteration to the Florida Medicaid Program in Violation of the ADA \n \nThe State of Florida has no obligation to provide the putative class of plaintiffs \nwith personal care services either by adding personal care services to its Medicaid State \nPlan or through its TBI/SCI Waiver Program, to the extent there are no unfilled slots. \n8 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 9 of 17 PageID 151\n  Medicaid is a joint federal-state venture created by federal statute, Title XIX of \nthe Social Security Act of 1965, as amended.  42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. (Medicaid Act).  \nIn order to participate in Medicaid, a state must submit a plan to the federal government \noutlining its program to fund medical services for the poor and needy in accordance with \nthe federal Medicaid Act.  If the federal government approves the plan, it “then subsidizes \na certain portion of the financial obligations which the state has agreed to bear.”  Harris v. \nJames, 127 F.3d 993, 996 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing Silver v. Baggiano, 804 F.2d 1211 \n(11th Cir. 1986).  Currently, with the addition of stimulus funds pursuant to the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the federal government provides 67.64% of the \nmoney in Florida‟s Medicaid program for the Fiscal Year 2009.  74 Fed. Reg. 64697-\n64700. \n  The federal Medicaid Act defines “medical assistance” to mean payment for all or \npart of the services listed in 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(1) through (28).  42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a).  \nOnly seven of the twenty-eight services listed are mandatory, meaning that a state must \ninclude  such  in  its  state  plan  in  order  to  participate  in  Medicaid.    42  U.S.C.  § \n1396a(a)(10)(A).  Mandatory services for adults over the age of 21 include inpatient \nhospital services, outpatient hospital services, laboratory and x-ray services, nursing \nfacility services, nurse-midwife services, and certified nurse practitioner services. See 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A) (requiring state plans to provide at least the services listed in § \n1396d(a)(1) through (5), (17) and (21)).  Thus, Florida is required by federal law to make \nnursing facility services available and, if these services are medically necessary for the \n9 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 10 of 17 PageID 152\nputative class members, they are entitled to them as a matter of federal law.  See e.g., \nGoldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970). \n  Florida may include any of the twenty-one services listed in 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a), \nincluding personal care services.  However, it is essential to note that Florida is not \nrequired to provide such services to comply with the Medicaid Act, and, to the extent that \nFlorida opts not to provide any of these twenty-one other services, Florida‟s Medicaid \nrecipients to do not have an entitlement to those services. \n  In addition to the Medicaid services offered under a state‟s Medicaid State Plan, a \nstate may also enter into an agreement with the federal government to offer services under \na waiver program, such as the TBI/SCI Waiver Program.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c).  \nUnder  home  and  community-based  waiver  programs  such  as  the  TBI/SCI  Waiver \nProgram, the federal government agrees to “waive” certain requirements of the Medicaid \nAct without jeopardizing federal financial participation.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(3).  Most \nimportantly  for  the  purposes  of  this  case,  the  Medicaid  Act  permits  waiver  of  the \ncomparability requirement of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(B).  Id.  This provision requires \nstate plans to offer the services in 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a) to all Medicaid recipients in the \nsame amount, duration and scope.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(B).  By providing for a \nwaiver of the comparability requirement, the Medicaid Act permits states to discriminate \non the basis of disability.   \n  The Medicaid Act also permits waiver of Medicaid requirements with respect to \nlimiting  the  number  of  persons  receiving  waiver  services  and  eliminating  the \nstatewideness requirement.  While a state must provide services under its State Plan to \n10 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 11 of 17 PageID 153\neveryone  who  meets  the  state‟s  Medicaid  eligibility  requirements,  the  waiver  law \nspecifically allows states to “cap” the number of persons receiving waiver services.  42 \nU.S.C. § 1396n(c)(9)-(10).  Waiver of statewideness means that states can limit the \nprovision of HCBS services to certain parts of the state as opposed to persons living \nthroughout the state.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(3). \n  It is important to note that while the federal Medicaid Act permits states to create \nhome and community-based waiver programs, it does not require states to do so.  As the \nMedicaid  Act  states,  “a  State  plan  approved  under  this  subchapter  may  include  as \n„medical assistance‟ under such plan payment for part or all of the cost of home or \ncommunity-based  services  (other  than  room  and  board)  approved  by”  the  federal \ngovernment.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1) (emphasis added).  Neither does the Medicaid Act \nrequire the federal government to approve states‟ home and community-based waiver \nprograms.  The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services “may by \nwaiver” allow states to create home and community-based programs.  Id. (emphasis \nadded). \n  The Florida Medicaid Program does not provide in-home personal care services \nfor adults like the putative class member plaintiffs.  While Florida does provide in-home \npersonal care assistance through its TBI/SCI Waiver Program, Florida has opted to place \na cap on the number of persons enrolled in this program.  The TBI/SCI Waiver Program \ndoes not have adequate openings at this time to accommodate all members of the putative \nclass.  The Amended Complaint does not allege that Florida has violated the Medicaid \nAct by failing to provide in-home personal care assistance.  However, it does request that \n11 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 12 of 17 PageID 154\nthe Court order Defendants to provide such services to members of the putative class.  \nSuch an order would effectively nullify one or more provisions of the Medicaid Act, thus \nforcing  modifications  that  would  “fundamentally  alter”  the  Medicaid  Program  in \nviolation of ADA regulations.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n  By  ordering  the  provision  of  such  services,  the  Court  would  invalidate  the \nMedicaid Act‟s explicit statement that the only mandatory services are those found at 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396d(a)(1) through (5), (17), and (21) by converting personal care assistance \nfrom an optional service to a mandatory service.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A).  This \nwould require Florida to undertake a massive program expansion to ensure the provision \nof personal care assistant services to Medicaid recipients, fundamentally altering the \nprogram in the process. \n  In the alternative, such an order would invalidate the provision in 42 U.S.C. § \n1396n(c)(1) declaring that home and community-based waiver programs are optional for \nstates and that states can cap enrollment in such programs.  The TBI/SCI Waiver Program \ndoes  not  have  adequate  numbers  of  qualified  community  providers  to  sustain  the \nsignificant  increase  in  capacity  that  would  come  from  invalidating  enrollment  caps.  \nRequiring Defendants to transfer large numbers of persons onto the TBI/SCI Waiver \nProgram would fundamentally alter it in the process. \nIn summary, no state is required to offer personal care assistance services as part \nof its Medicaid State Plan, and Florida has not opted to do so.  Every state is required to \nprovide nursing facility services as part of its Medicaid State Plan, and Florida provides \nsuch services to eligible Medicaid recipients.  Florida offers personal care services within \n12 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 13 of 17 PageID 155\nnursing  facilities  to  Medicaid  recipients  who  require  them,  both  disabled  and  non-\ndisabled.  No state is required to create home and community-based waiver programs.  \nFlorida has created and received federal approval for several such waivers, including the \nTBI/SCI Waiver Program.  Florida offers personal care services as part of the TBI/SCI \nWaiver Program.  Florida has capped the enrollment in the TBI/SCI Waiver Program to \n375, which is permitted under the Medicaid Act and has been approved by the federal \ngovernment.  The relief requested in the Amended Complaint would fundamentally alter \nFlorida‟s Medicaid Program by requiring Defendants to either offer personal care services \nas part of the Medicaid State Plan or uncap or increase enrollment in the TBI/SCI Waiver \nProgram.  It should be noted that Florida is not able to take either of these measures \nwithout approval from the federal government. \nBecause the relief requested under the ADA would fundamentally alter the Florida \nMedicaid Program, it is not required by the ADA and Plaintiffs have failed to state a \nclaim  upon  which  relief  can  be  granted.    This  Court  should  dismiss  the  Amended \nComplaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P. \nIV.  Issue or Claim Preclusion Bars This Action \nIn Dubois v. Levine, supra, the Federal District Court for the Northern District of \nFlorida addressed a claim on behalf of a statewide class of  persons with brain and spinal \ncord injuries that the State Defendants, the secretaries of the Florida Agency for Health \nCare Administration and the Department of Health (the same defendants in the case sub \njudice)  \nengaged in a “systemic and continuing failure to provide the named Plaintiffs and alleged \n13 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 14 of 17 PageID 156\nclass  members  (Plaintiffs)  with  medically  necessary  home  and  community  based \nservices”  in  violation  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  Section  504  of  the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, Title XIX of the Social Security Act, and all implementing \nregulations.  See Complaint, attached as Exhibit A.   \nThe Court certified as a class “all individuals with traumatic brain or spinal cord \ninjuries who the state has already determined or will determine to be eligible to receive \nservices from Florida‟s Medicaid Waiver Program for persons with traumatic brain and \nspinal  cord  injuries and have not  received such services.”  (Emphasis  added.)  See \nSettlement, attached as Exhibit B.  This Settlement was approved by the Court and the \nCourt dismissed the action with prejudice pursuant to the Settlement‟s terms on January \n4, 2007.  See Order of Dismissal with Prejudice, attached as Exhibit C.   There is no \nquestion Plaintiff Jones (as well as any other representative plaintiff who may be chosen) \nis within the scope of the class. \nFrom these documents, it is self-evident that the issues and claims Plaintiff and \nthe putative class seek to litigate here have been litigated to conclusion in Dubois.   The \nlaw is clear that the doctrine of issue preclusion (or collateral estoppel) bars a party from \nwhat is tantamount to a collateral attack on a settlement issued in a prior class action \nasserting essentially the same claims or issues.  Reyn‟s Pasta Bella, LLC v. Visa USA, \nInc., 442 F. 3d 741 (9th Cir. 2006); Carter v. Rubin, 14 F. Supp. 2d 22 (D.C. D.C. 1998).     \nThere are four core issues that are addressed in applying issue preclusion or \ncollateral  estoppel:  (1)  identity  of  issues;  (2)  prior  adjudication  resulting  in  a  final \njudgment on the merits; (3) whether Plaintiff here was a party or in privity with a party to \n14 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 15 of 17 PageID 157\nthe prior adjudication; and (4) whether that party had a full and fair opportunity to litigate \nthe issue in the prior proceeding.  47 Am. Jur. 2d, Judgments, sec. 489.  In the case at bar, \nthe issues are identical—the provision of Medicaid Waiver Services to BSCIP persons \nwho are on a wait list and therefore not receiving those services and are at risk for \ninstitutionalization. The prior adjudication in Dubois case resulted in a final judgment on \nthe merits. Further, the parties are identical because Plaintiff here is necessarily included \nin the definition of the class in Dubois.  And finally, as a member of the Dubois class, \nPlaintiff had every opportunity through class counsel to litigate her issues in the prior \nproceeding.  (In fact, Plaintiff here makes no challenge to the correctness, propriety or \nfairness of the Dubois proceeding.)  \nThe federal courts generally follow a three-step process in determining whether \nissue preclusion applies: (1) the identification of issues in the two actions to determine \nwhether the issues are sufficiently similar and sufficiently material in both actions to \njustify invoking the doctrine; (2) the examination of the record of the prior case to decide \nwhether the issue was litigated in the first case; and (3) the examination of the record in \nthe prior proceeding to ascertain whether the issue was necessarily decided in the first \ncase.  Id.  Here, there is no doubt the issues are sufficiently similar and sufficiently \nmaterial  to  justify  invoking  the  doctrine;  and  the  issues  were  both  litigated  and \nnecessarily decided in Dubois.   Accordingly, the doctrine of issue preclusion (or claim \npreclusion or collateral estoppel) applies to bar this action. \nCONCLUSION \n15 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 25    Filed 12/29/09   Page 16 of 17 PageID 158\n  This Court should dismiss the Amended Complaint as moot, or, in the alternative, \nfor failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or because the claims are \nbarred by issue or claim preclusion. \n \n  Respectfully submitted this 29th day of December, 2009. \n \nAGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE \nADMINISTRATION \n \n \nBY:  /s Andrew  T.

ANNA VIAMONTE ROSS, in \nher official capacity as Secretary, Florida Department of Health, by undersigned counsel, \npursuant to Rule 23, Fed. R. Civ. P., and Rule 3.01(b), Local Rules, United States District \nCourt,  Middle  District  of  Florida,  submit  this  response  and  memorandum  of  law  in \nopposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification. As grounds therefore, Defendants \nstate as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n  Plaintiff  brings  this  putative  class  action  lawsuit  pursuant  to  Title  II  of  the \nAmericans  with  Disabilities  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  12132  (ADA),  and  Section  504  of  the \n1 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 34    Filed 01/20/10   Page 2 of 11 PageID 406\nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (Rehab Act).  In the Amended Complaint, filed \nDecember 15, 2009, Plaintiff claims that she and the members of the putative class are \nMedicaid-eligible disabled Florida residents with a spinal cord injury who reside in the \ncommunity,  wish  to  continue  to  reside  in  the  community,  and  are  at  risk  of  being \ninstitutionalized in a nursing facility if not provided community-based services through the \nMedicaid program.  Plaintiff claims that Defendants’ failure to provide in-home services \nthrough the Medicaid program constitutes unlawful discrimination under both the ADA and \nthe Rehab Act. \n  On  December  29,  2003,  Defendants  filed  their  Motion  to  Dismiss  Plaintiff’s \nAmended Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, failure to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted, and because the claims are barred by issue or claim preclusion.  \nIn brief: (1) the named Plaintiff’s case is moot as she is already in the process of being \nenrolled  in  the  in  the  Traumatic  Brain  Injury  /  Spinal  Cord  Injury  Medicaid  Waiver \nProgram (TBI/SCI Waiver Program); (2) the mooting of the named Plaintiff’s claim prior to \nthe filing of a motion to certify the class renders the entire action moot; (3) Plaintiff’s claim \nfor the provision of personal care services exceeds the scope of the ADA, because the \napplicable  statute  and  implementing  regulations  do  not  require  the  provision  of  such \nservices; (4) the requested class remedy would result in a fundamental alteration of the \nFlorida Medicaid Program, which the ADA does not require; and (5) the claims are barred \nby issue or claim preclusion (or collateral estoppel). \n2 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 34    Filed 01/20/10   Page 3 of 11 PageID 407\nOn January 6, 2010, Plaintiff filed her Motion for Class Certification (Motion) and \nMemorandum of Law in Support of the Motion (Memorandum).  Plaintiff Jones contends \nthat a putative class exists which is described as: \nFlorida  disabled  residents  with  a  spinal  cord  injury  who  are  Medicaid \nrecipients;  reside  in  the  community;  desire  to  continue  to  reside  in  the \ncommunity instead of a nursing facility; could reside in the community with \nappropriate Medicaid-funded services; and are at risk, as determined by the \nrecipient’s treating physician or other treating health professional, of being \nforced to enter a nursing-home because Defendants do not provide adequate \ncommunity-based services. \n \n Motion ¶ 1. \nDefendants oppose Plaintiff’s Motion because Plaintiff has not met her burden of \nsatisfying the requirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P. \n \nMEMORANDUM OF LAW \nI.  Plaintiff has failed to establish her burden of proving all the requisite elements \nunder Rule 23(a), Fed. R. Civ. P. \n \nIn order for a class action to proceed, all four of the threshold conditions in Rule \n23(a), Fed. R. Civ. P., must be met: (1) the class must be so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable (numerosity); (2) there must be questions of law or fact common \nto the class (commonality); (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties must be \ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class (typicality); and (4) the representative parties \nmust fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class (adequacy of representation).  \nPrado-Steiman v. Bush, 221 F.3d 1266, 1278 (11th Cir. Fla. 2000); Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \nIn addition, the class action must fall into one of the three categories set forth in Rule \n23(b)(1), (2), and (3), Fed. R. Civ. P.  Amchem Prods. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591 (U.S. \n3 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 34    Filed 01/20/10   Page 4 of 11 PageID 408\n1997).  Here, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds \ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making injunctive relief appropriate with respect to \nthe class as a whole, and that the action satisfies thus Rule 23(b)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P. \nThe party seeking class certification has the burden of proof on the Rule 23, Fed. R. \nCiv. P., requirements.  Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharms., Inc., 350 F.3d 1181, 1187 \n(11th Cir. Fla. 2003); Rutstein v. Avis Rent-A-Car Sys., 211 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir. \nFla. 2000).  Furthermore, it is insufficient for the Plaintiff to rely on pleading allegations \nalone to satisfy her burden of proof.  Walker v. Jim Dandy Co., 747 F.2d 1360, 1365 (11th \nCir. Ala. 1984). \nThe Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden of proof as to the class certification.  First \nand foremost, the class action should not be certified because the one named plaintiff has no \njusticiable claim.  In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have failed to \nassess properly the services and supports that would enable Plaintiffs to remain in the \ncommunity and to ensure that Plaintiff has access to Medicaid-covered services that will \nmeet her needs in the community.  But the Defendants are currently in the process of \nassessing Plaintiff Jones’ needs and the services and supports that would meet those needs in \norder to ensure that she receives the Medicaid-covered services for which she is eligible.  See \nDecember 18, 2009, Affidavit of Kristen Russell (Docket number 24).  The Defendants are \nalready doing what Plaintiff Jones is asking this Court to order them to do.  As such, her \nclaims are moot. \nFurthermore, because the provision of personal care services is not required under \nthe ADA, and because the Plaintiff’s requested relief would require a fundamental alteration \n4 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 34    Filed 01/20/10   Page 5 of 11 PageID 409\nof the Florida Medicaid Program, Plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted.  A named plaintiff who fails to state a claim on his or her own behalf cannot \nmaintain a class action on behalf of others.  See Cramer v. Florida, 117 F.3d 1258, 1264 \n(11th Cir. Fla. 1997). \nLacking a valid plaintiff representative, the Court cannot make a determination that \nthe requirements in Rule 23(a), Fed. R. Civ. P., have been met.  Given the Plaintiff’s vague \ndefinition of the class, the Court cannot determine whether the numerosity requirement is \nmet without a plaintiff representative to serve as an example of, among other things, what it \nmeans to be “at risk’ of being forced into a nursing home.  Without a plaintiff representative, \nthe commonality and typicality requirements cannot be established.  Obviously, where there \nis no valid plaintiff representative, there is no showing of adequacy of representation. \n.  As shown below, the facts alleged in Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint and Motion \nfor Class Certification do not sufficiently demonstrate that the requirements of Rule 23(a) \nand Rule 23(b)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., are met, and the Motion for Class Certification should \ntherefore be denied. \n \nA.  Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the class is so numerous that \njoinder of all members is impracticable \n \nPlaintiff alleges that the putative class is so numerous that joinder of all its members \nis impracticable.  To support this, Plaintiff alleges in the Motion and Memorandum that a \nrecent report shows that were “434 people with spinal cord injuries” on the wait list for \nFlorida’s Traumatic Brain Injury / Spinal Cord Injury Medicaid Waiver Program (TBI/SCI \nWaiver Program) in FY 2008.  Motion ¶ 5; Memorandum p 2.   Plaintiff further alleges in \n5 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 34    Filed 01/20/10   Page 6 of 11 PageID 410\nthe Motion and Memorandum that a document prepared by the Florida Medicaid Program \nshows that the “waiting list for persons with spinal cord injuries had increased to 554 \npeople.”  Id.  These documents do not support this allegation of numerosity. \n  The mere fact that someone is on the waiting list for the TBI/SCI Waiver Program \ndoes not demonstrate that such person falls into the putative class.  First, the mere fact that \nsomeone is on the waiting list does not mean that person has a spinal cord injury.  A person \nwho suffered a traumatic brain injury that did not damage his or her spinal cord could still be \neligible for the TBI/SCI Waiver Program.  See Affidavit of Kristen Russell, attached as \nExhibit A. \nSecond, the mere fact that someone is on the waiting list for the TBI/SCI Waiver \nProgram does not mean that such person currently resides in the community.  Not everyone \non the waiting list currently resides in the community.  See Id. \nFinally, the mere fact that someone is on the waiting list for the TBI/SCI Waiver \nProgram does not show that such person is at risk of being forced to enter a nursing home.  \nThis element of the class definition, which is essential for the class members to even have \nstanding, is not sufficiently described.  What does it mean to be “at risk, as determined by the \nrecipients’ treating physician or other treating health professional, of being forced to enter a \nnursing home”?  What standards do the treating professionals use?  How imminent must the \nrisk be? \nPlaintiff Jones is a prime example.  A person must be at least 18 years old to qualify \nfor the TBI/SCI Waiver Program.  Had Ms. Jones applied and been placed on the waiting \nlist at age 18, would she have been considered “at risk” of being forced to enter a nursing \n6 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 34    Filed 01/20/10   Page 7 of 11 PageID 411\nhome?  If so, then such “risk” is devoid of meaning, as Ms. Jones as managed to remain in \nthe community for an additional 17 years after age 18 without receiving any services from \nthe TBI/SCI Waiver Program.  If Ms. Jones would not have been considered “at risk” of \nbeing forced to enter a nursing home at age 18, this clearly demonstrates that simply being \non the TBI/SCI Waiver Program waiting list does not show that a person is part of the \nputative class. \nB.  Plaintiff  has  failed  to  show  that  there  are  question  of  law  or  fact \ncommon to the class \n \nPlaintiff alleges that there “are questions of law and fact that are common to all \nnamed Plaintiff (sic), as well as to all putative class members.”  Motion ¶ 6.  However, given \nthat the Court no longer has a justiciable controversy before it with respect to the named \nPlaintiff, and this was the case even prior to the filing of the Motion, there are no questions \nof law or fact before the Court at all.  See Tucker v. Phyfer, 819 F.2d 1030, 1033 (11th Cir. \nAla. 1987) (“In a class action, the claim of the named plaintiff, who seeks to represent the \nclass, must be live both at the time he brings suit and when the district court determines \nwhether to certify the putative class. If the plaintiff's claim is not live, the court lacks a \njusticiable controversy and must dismiss the claim as moot”).  How can the Court conclude \nthat there is an entire class with common issues of law or fact when there is not even a valid \nPlaintiff representative before the Court?  See Gen. Tel. Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 \nU.S. 147, 158 (U.S. 1982) (commonality requirement tends to merge with typicality and \nadequacy of representation). \n \n \n7 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 34    Filed 01/20/10   Page 8 of 11 PageID 412\n \nC.  Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that her claims are typical of the \nclaims of the class \n \nTo maintain a class action, the Plaintiff must demonstrate that her claims are typical \nof the claims of the class.  Rule 23(a)(3), Fed. R. Civ. P.  This elements requires that the \nnamed plaintiff be a proper member of the class.  Taliaferro v. State Council of Higher \nEducation, 372 F. Supp. 1378, 1387 (E.D. Va. 1974).  In the instant case, the named \nPlaintiff has no justiciable claims.  The Defendants are in the process of assessing her needs \nin order to enroll her in the TBI/SCI Waiver Program pending a determination of her \neligibility.  See December 18, 2009, Affidavit of Kristen Russell (Docket number 24).  This \nis precisely what the Defendants would have to do if the Court were to issue an order in \naccordance with Plaintiff’s requests in the Amended Complaint.  As such, her claims are \nmoot and she is not a member of the putative class.  The Plaintiff has thus failed to meet her \nburden of proof in showing that the typicality requirement has been fulfilled. \nEven if the Court were to determine that Plaintiff Jones case is not moot, she has still \nfailed to show that her claims are typical of the claims of the class because of the numerous \npossible variations associated with determinations by treating physicians or other treating \nhealth professionals of the risk “of being forced to enter a nursing home.”  Motion ¶ 1.  \nThere is any number of reasons that a person may enter a nursing home, and not all of them \nare based on medical indications.  Plaintiff Jones is a good example.  Her alleged “risk” of \nbeing forced to enter a nursing home is not based on any change in her medical condition, \nbut rather upon changes in her overall life circumstances; namely, the abilities of her parents \nto care for her in the home. \n8 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 34    Filed 01/20/10   Page 9 of 11 PageID 413\n \nD.  Plaintiff  has  failed  to  demonstrate  that  she  is  an  adequate \nrepresentative of the class \n \nPlaintiff is required to show that she will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe putative class.  Rule 23(a)(4), Fed. R. Civ. P.  As set forth above, Plaintiff has failed to \nestablish that the putative class exists, and thus has also failed to establish that she will \nrepresent that class adequately.  Even if the Court were to determine that the putative class \nexists, Plaintiff still fails to show that she will fairly and adequately protect its interests.  \nSince Plaintiff Jones is herself already in the process of being enrolled in the TBI/SCI \nWaiver Program, she has no personal stake in seeing that the program is opened up to other \nmembers of the putative class.  See Docket number 24.  As such, Plaintiff is not “interested \nenough to be a forceful advocate” on behalf of the putative class.  Shulman v. Ritzenberg, 47 \nF.R.D. 202, 207 (D.D.C. 1969).  Put another way, Plaintiff’s interests are not “sufficient to \ninduce vigorous advocacy” on behalf of the class.  Wyandotte Nation v. City of Kansas City, \n214 F.R.D. 656, 661 (D. Kan. 2003).  Plaintiff has failed to show that she is an adequate \nrepresentative of the class. \nII.  Plaintiff has failed to establish her burden under Rule 23(b), Fed. R. Civ. P. \n  In her Motion, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have acted or refused to act on \ngrounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making final injunctive relief appropriate \nwith respect to the class as a whole under Rule 23(b)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P.  Motion ¶ 9.  \nPlaintiff has failed to meet her burden to demonstrate that a class action may be maintained \npursuant to Rule 23(b), Fed. R. Civ. P.   \n9 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 34    Filed 01/20/10   Page 10 of 11 PageID 414\nIt is especially important for courts to ensure that the named Plaintiff is a member of \nthe putative class in Rule 23(b)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., cases because of the necessity of \n“cohesiveness” in such cases.  Mays v. Scranton City Police Dep't, 87 F.R.D. 310, 314 \n(M.D. Pa. 1979).  Here, the named Plaintiff is not a member of the putative class.  Plaintiff \nJones is already in the process of being enrolled in the TBI/SCI Waiver Program.  See \nDocket number 24. There is no action or inaction of the Defendants on grounds applicable to \neven the named Plaintiff, much less to an entire putative class.   \n \nCONCLUSION \n  For  the  reasons  stated  above,  this  Court  should  deny  the  Motion  for  Class \nCertification. \n \n  Respectfully submitted this 20th day of January, 2010. \n \nAGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE \nADMINISTRATION \n \n \nBY:  /s/ Andrew  T.

INTRODUCTION \n \n  Defendants assert that because they will provide services to Jacqueline Jones, the named \nPlaintiff, they are entitled to a motion to dismiss. Defendants‟ motion should be dismissed \nbecause  a  judicial  determination  of  her  substantantive  claims  is  necessary  to  avoid,  at  a \nminimum, any future injury to Miss Jones.  This decision is necessary since Miss Jones needs for \ncommunity-based services will certainly increase and change in the future as her parents age and \nbecome weaker.  Defendants have not and cannot assure this Court that Defendants will provide \nher  with  appropriate  community-based  services  for  the  inevitable  increase  in  her  needs.  \nTherefore, Miss Jones‟ action is not moot.  To date, Miss Jones has not been provided or \nguaranteed any services.  It is difficult to envision how Defendants can argue that Miss Jones‟ \nclaim is moot, when she remains at home without any services or certainty as to whether \nDefendants will actually provide services.  In addition, since there are more than 500 putative \n  1 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 2 of 21 PageID 375\nclass members, limited discovery should be permitted to determine if any of the putative class \nmembers wish to become a named class representative.  \nII.  PROCEDURAL POSTURE \nOn September 26, 2007, then Deputy Secretary for Florida Medicaid Thomas W. Arnold, \nwrote to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, stating that the “Total Number \nUnduplicated Number of Participants” in Defendants‟ Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord Injury \nWaiver [“TBI/SCI” Waiver] would be a maximum of 375 per year for the five years of the \nwaiver application. [Attachment “A”]. 1   Regardless of the actual number of otherwise eligible \nand needy people with spinal cord injuries who need and apply for the waiver or who may be on \na waiting list for this waiver, Defendants have capped the number at 375. \n The Kaiser Commission of Medicaid and the Uninsured recently issued a report entitled \n“Medicaid Home and Community-Based Service Programs: Data Update.”  The Kaiser data was \nbased on Defendants‟ data for FY 2008.  At Table 11 the Kaiser Commission reported that there \nwere 434 people on Florida‟s TBI/SCI waiting list for services. [Attachment “B”]. On December \n4, 2008, Defendants wrote a report stating that, as of November 1, 2008, there were 554 people \non the TBI/SCI Waiver wait list. [Attachment “C”].  These 434 to 554 people are the putative \nclass members of the instant action. \nPlaintiff Jones has been on Defendants‟ Spinal Cord Injury waiting list for a number of \nyears.  She is one of the 434 to 554 people who exceeded the maximum 375 available slots \nwhich Defendants have in their SCI waiver.  Approximately once a year, Defendants telephoned \nMiss Jones, asked her questions and then mailed her a “Notice of Decision.”  Each year, the \nNotice was virtually the same: “You have been placed on the TBI/SCI Waiver waiting list.... \n                                                           \n1  Year 1 was July 1, 2007 - June 30, 2008; Year 2 - July 1, 2008 - June 30, 2009; Year 3 - \nJuly 1, 2009 - June 30, 2010; Year 4 - July 1, 2010 - June 30, 2011; and Year 5 - July 1, 2011 -\nJune 30, 2012.  \n  2 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 3 of 21 PageID 376\nReason(s) for placement on waiting list: No openings at this time.”   On July 28, 2009, Miss \nJones received another Notice of Decision from Defendants which stated same reason for denial \nof SCI Waiver services - “No openings at this time.” [Attachment “D.”]   Similarly, on October \n17, 2009, less than six weeks before she filed the instant action, she received a Notice of \nDecision stating again “No openings at this time.” [Attachment “E”.] \nMiss Jones filed her complaint on December 2, 2009. [Dkt.1]   She simultaneously filed \nher motion for a preliminary injunction. [Dkt. 2].  During the first week of December, 2009, \ncounsel learned of the 434 people from the Kaiser report who were similarly situated as Miss \nJones.  Counsel then obtained Defendants‟ report which stated there were 554 people on the \nwaiting list.  These two documents indicated the existence of a putative class. Defendants do not \nand cannot realistically dispute that there are hundreds of persons are on waiting lists -- many \nhave waited for years -- for Medicaid services in Defendants‟ SCI waiver. Nor can they \ndispute that the SCI waiver is capped at 375 through June 30, 2012, so that, but for a judicial \nfinding in the instant action, no more than 375 people with SCI will receive community-\nbased services.  \nOn December 15, 2009, an amended complaint was filed alleging a class. [Dkt.16]. \nMiss Jones was not contacted by defendants until after her amended complaint was filed.  \nDefendants filed their motion to dismiss on December 29, 2009.  [Dkt. 25].  Defendants \nmake four arguments in support of their motion to dismiss.  On January 6, 2010, a motion for \nthe class was filed. [Dkt 28].  \nIII.   ARGUMENT \nA.  MOOTNESS  \n    i.  Defendants Have Failed to Meet Their Heavy Burden to Demonstrate that \nPlaintiff’s Request for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief is Moot. \n \n  3 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 4 of 21 PageID 377\nDefendants cannot prevail on their claim of mootness because defendants have failed to \nsatisfy  their  “heavy  burden”  to  demonstrate  mootness  with  “absolute  clarity.”  Indeed,  the \nSupreme Court has made clear that the party asserting mootness bears the heavy burden of \nproof  that  the  plaintiffs‟  claims  are  moot.  See  Friends  of  the  Earth,  Inc.,  et  al.,  v. \nLaidlaw.Environmemtental Serv. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189, 120 S. Ct. 693 (2000). \nA case might become moot if subsequent events make it absolutely clear that \nthe allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur. . . \nThe heavy burden of persuading the court that the challenged conduct cannot \nreasonably be expected to start up again lies with the party asserting mootness.   \n \n(Internal quotations omitted) (emphases added). \n \nGiven this standard, a party who voluntarily stops an illegal activity may not simply \nassert that its cessation of the challenged activity is sufficient to render injunctive relief \nmoot. Rather, the party must make it absolutely clear that the illegal activity could not and \nwill not reasonably recur. \nThe test for mootness in cases such as this is a stringent one. Mere voluntary \ncessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not moot a case; if it did, the courts \nwould be compelled to leave the defendant free to return to his old ways…. A \ncase might become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the \nallegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur. But \nhere we have only appellees‟ own statement that it would be uneconomical for \nthem to engage in any further joint operations.  Such a statement, standing \nalone, cannot suffice to satisfy the heavy burden of persuasion which we \nhave held rests upon those in appellees’ shoes. \n \nU.S. v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass’n, Inc., 393 U.S. 199, 203, 89 S.Ct. 361, 364 \n(1968) (internal. quotations and citations omitted) (emphasis added); See also U.S. v. W T. \nGrant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S. Ct. 894 (1953) (“voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal \nconduct does not deprive the tribunal of power to hear and determine the case, i.e., does not \nmake  the  case  moot.”);  United  States  v.  Phosphate  Export  Assn.,  393  U.S.  199,  203 \n(1968)(“[m]ere voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not moot a case”); City \nof Erie, et al., v. Pap’s A.M Kandyland, 529 U.S. 277, 287, 120 S.Ct. 382 (2000). \n  4 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 5 of 21 PageID 378\nFurther, the Eleventh Circuit, in Secretary of Labor v. Burger King Corp., 955 F.2d. \n681, 684 (11th Cir. 1992), recognized that courts have a duty to beware of a party‟s last \nminute efforts to defeat injunctive relief. \nBecause of the possibility that the defendant could merely  return to his old \nways, the test for mootness in cases such as this is a stringent one.  A case \nmight  become  moot  if  subsequent  events  made  it,  absolutely  clear  that  the \nallegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur. As the \nSupreme Court has noted, it is the duty of the courts to beware of efforts to \ndefeat injunctive relief by protestations of repentance and reform, especially \nwhen abandonment seems timed to anticipate suit, and there is probability of \nresumption. \n \n(Internal  quotations and citations omitted) (emphasis  supplied).  See  Reich  v.  Occupational \nSafety & Health Review Commission, 102 F. 3d. 1200 (11th Cir.1997) (employer‟s cessation of \nbusiness did not render proceeding moot since existence of case or controversy did not depend \non employer‟s post-violation acts).  \n  Though the Defendants argue that Plaintiff‟s claims are moot, Defendants have failed to \nmeet their burden to demonstrate that the named Plaintiff (let alone class plaintiffs) will not, in the \nfuture, be subject to the same illegal denial of community-based services. See Friends of the \nEarth, supra.  Defendants cannot meet their burden because they admit there is a waiting list of \nmore than 500 people and that at least until 2012 they plan to serve in their Spinal Cord Waiver \nno more than 375 people.   \n  Moreover, given the waiting list, Defendants cannot in good faith say that Plaintiff Jones \nwill not be forced to again wait for community-based services when her needs for services \nincrease.  It is undisputed that Miss Jones has significant disabilities and currently relies on her \naging and infirm parents for whatever assistance the family can provide. As Miss Jones‟ needs \nincrease in the future, Defendants cannot assert “there is no reasonable expectation the wrong \nwill not be repeated.” Grant, supra at 633.  Defendants current offer to provide her with Spinal \nCord Injury Waiver services will, by necessity, take into account the services which her parents \n  5 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 6 of 21 PageID 379\npresently are able to provide her, e.g., cooking her meals and other assistance with activities of \ndaily living.  However, it is a certainty that Miss Jones‟ needs will change in the future as her \nparents age, pass away or become frailer than they presently are.  Sometime in the near future, \nher parents will not be able to provide her with any assistance or with less assistance then the \npresently able to provide.  Defendants cannot assure the Court that when Miss Jones‟ needs \nincrease that Defendants will increase her services. Whether they can increase her services will \ndepend on how many other people are receiving services, costs of other people, and many other \nfactors.  If Defendants are capped out when Miss Jones‟ needs increase, they may not be able to \nprovide her with increased services.  In the future, plaintiff will be forced to wait for needed \nservices to make up for what her parents provide her at the present. Defendants cannot assure \nthis Court they will be able to provide her with those services. 4   \n  Because Defendants have failed to meet their burden of proof, Plaintiffs‟ claims remain \njusticiable.  Without appropriate equitable relief, Plaintiff will be forced to undergo another \nseemingly  endless  wait  on  Defendants‟  waiting  list.    If  Defendants  are  not  barred  from \ndiscriminating against Miss Jones in the future, the exact same controversy will present itself to \nthis Court.  See Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 487 (1980).   \n    ii.    Defendants’ Motion Should Be Denied Due to the Pendency of Plaintiff’s \nMotion for a Class Action  \n \nIn their motions to dismiss, Defendants do not -- and cannot -- argue that the named \nPlaintiff does not have an interest in the relief sought in this case.  Likewise, Defendants do not -\n- and cannot -- assert that no putative class member has an interest in the outcome of \nPlaintiff‟s request for class certification. Consequently, Defendants‟ recent indication that it \nwill provide Miss Jones services does not divest this Court of its jurisdiction over Plaintiff‟s \nrequest for class certification.  The continuing nature of the controversy falls within the \n                                                           \n4   This likelihood of reoccurrence of injury to Miss Jones distinguishes Defendants‟ reliance on Tucker v. \nPhyfer, 819 F.2d 1030 (11th Cir. 1987), \n  6 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 7 of 21 PageID 380\n“narrow class of cases in which the termination of a class representative‟s claim does not \nmoot the claims of the unnamed members of the class.”  Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 111 \nn.11 (1975)(noting there was a “constant existence of a class of persons suffering deprivation \nis certain.  The attorney representing the named respondents is a public defender, and we can \nsafely assume that he has other clients with a continuing live interest in the case.”)  In the \ninstant case, there are approximately 545 other class members  who suffer discrimination.  \nDefendants should not be allowed to “pick off” a named plaintiff to escape their obligation to \nend discriminating against people with disabilities. \nIt is well settled that once a class has been certified, mooting a class representative‟s \nindividual claim does not moot the entire action, because the class “acquire[s] a legal status \nseparate from the interest asserted by [the named plaintiff].” Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 399, \n95 S.Ct. 553 (1975). Significantly, this principle also  addresses  litigation  where,  as  here, \nalthough a class certification has been sought prior to Miss Jones actually receiving services, \na determination as to certification has not  yet been made. Thus, even though the named \nPlaintiff‟s present claims may have remedied, a class action may still be appropriate, and a \nnamed plaintiff will retain his or her standing to pursue the action as a class representative. \nThere may be cases in which the controversy involving the named plaintiffs is \nsuch that it becomes moot as to them before the district court can reasonably \nbe expected to rule on a certification motion. In such instances, whether the \ncertification can be said to `relate back‟ to the filing of the complaint may \ndepend upon the circumstances of the particular case and especially the reality \nof the claim that otherwise the issue would evade review.  \n  \nId. at 402, n.11. \n \n  In Zeidman v. J. Ray McDermott & Co., Inc., 651 F.2d 1.03,0 (5th Cir. 1981), 4  the \nFifth Circuit applied the principles in Sosna when it held that a plaintiff in a putative class \n                                                           \n4  A three-judge panel o f the Fifth Circuit: decided the Zeidman case on July 27, 1981. \nAccordingly, this opinion is binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit until it is overruled by \n  7 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 8 of 21 PageID 381\naction whose individual claims became moot prior to class certification may still have standing \nto pursue the class action if he has filed a motion for class certification and vigorously pursued \nit. In Zeidman, the defendant made a tender of relief to the named plaintiffs after they filed for \nclass  status,  but  before  the  district  court‟s  final  certification  decision.  The  district  court \ndismissed the action based on defendant‟s argument that Article III standingrequired a named \n \nplaintiff to maintain individual standing until the class is certified. The Fifth Circuit reversed, \nholding that under the circumstances presented a district court‟s decision to certify a class \ncould “relate back” to the filing of the motion for class certification. Id. at 1050-1051. Because \n‟\nthe named plaintiffs claims were not moot when they filed their motion for class certification, \nthe  defendant‟s  subsequent  offer  of  settlement  did  not  cause  the  putative  class  action  to \nbecome moot. Id. \nThe Circuit also explained the important policy arguments behind its holding. Where it \nis financially feasible for a defendant to “pick off” the named plaintiffs by providing relief \nprior to class certification, defendants would have the option to “preclude a viable class action \nfrom ever reaching the certification stage.” Id. at 1050.  Because such a “result is precisely \nwhat the relation back doctrine of  Sosna.... condemns,” the  court refused to distinguish \nbetween mootness “caused by the defendant‟s purposive acts\" and that which is caused \"by \nthe naturally transitory nature of the controversy.” Id. Accordingly, the court held that “a suit \nbrought as a class action should not be dismissed for mootness upon tender to the named \nplaintiffs of their personal claims, at least when ... there is pending before the district court a \ntimely filed and diligently pursued motion for class certification.” Id, at 1051. \nZeidman has been characterized, not as an exception to Article III standing, but rather \nas a guide for evaluating whether an action remains a live controversy in the class action \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nthe Eleventh Circuit en banc. See Bowler v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 120&, 1209 (11''' \nCir. 1981). \n  8 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 9 of 21 PageID 382\ncontext - when the named plaintiff receives full compensation for his individual claims prior \nto class certification. Under the circumstances existing in Zeidman the controversy remains \nlive notwithstanding the pre-certification satisfaction of plaintiffs‟ individual claims. District \ncourts within the Eleventh Circuit have continued to apply Zeidman. See Bishop’s Property & \nInvestments, LLC v. Protective Life Insurance Company, 463 F.Supp.2d 1375 (M.D. Ga. 2006) \n(defendant‟s tender of refund to named plaintiff before class could be certified did not render \ncontroversy moot); Candy H. v. Redemption Ranch, Inc., 563 F. Supp. 505 (D. Ala. 1983) \n(Named plaintiffs allowed to pursue class representation. even though the requested immediate \ninjunctive relief was moot with respect to the named plaintiffs as both named plaintiffs had been \nreleased by defendants and did not plan to return.).  \nDefendants‟ conduct amounts to nothing more than an attempt to “pick off” the named \nplaintiff to avoid class liability. Defendants offered a potential for waiver services to Jacqueline \nJones only after she filed both her original complaint and the amended complaint alleging a class \nand seeking class relief.  Such timing suggests that Defendants have engaged in purposive acts \ndesigned to avoid the class litigation.  \nIn the instant action, there has been no change in Defendants‟ policy with regards to \nthe provision of services under their Spinal Cord Waiver program. Defendants have not \nstated they will end discriminating against people with spinal cord injuries who are on the \nwaiting list.  In fact, Defendants‟ own documents show there are more than 500 people like \nMiss  Jones  who  need  services.  Defendants  have  not  made  any  policy  or  program-wide \nchanges to ensure that class members will not have to endure lengthy waits for community-\nbased services. The waiting list continues to exist, evincing the continuing controversy in this \nmatter. Defendants have given no reason for their decision to disregard other people on the \nSpinal Cord  Injury  Waiver  waiting  list  and  to  not  provide  them  with  community-based \n  9 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 10 of 21 PageID 383\nservices. Defendants cannot be allowed to artificially moot this action before the Court has \nhad the opportunity to rule on Plaintiff‟s Motion for Class Certification. \n  B.   REASONABLE MODIFICATION AND FUNDAMENTAL ALTERATION \n \nDefendants Cannot Not Meet Their Burden to Prove A Fundamental \nAlteration Defense Given the Cost Savings that Florida Will Realize by \nServing Ms. Jones and the Class in the Community Instead of in Nursing \nHomes \n \n  Plaintiff Jones and class members want to reside in the community.  Despite meeting the \nlevel of care for a nursing home, the community by definition is “the most integrated setting” in \nwhich to provide them with services as required by both the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 12132 and 28 CFR § 35.130(d)(the integration mandate) and the Rehabilitation Act of \n1973, Section 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) and 28 CFR § 41.51(d). Plaintiff Jones and the class \nallege that Defendants refusal to provide them with services in the community, but instead to \nprovide them with the same services but only in nursing facilities, violates the “most integrated \nsetting” mandate.  \n A reasonable accommodation, i.e., the provision of assistance with daily living activities \nin the community to persons with spinal cord injuries, is obviously feasible. Defendants already \nprovide these services to some people with spinal cord injuries in the community in both their \nMedicaid  Spinal  Cord  Injury  Waiver  and  their  Medicaid  Personal  Care  Option  programs.  \nNamed  and  class  plaintiffs  request  only  that  these  same  community-based  programs  be \nexpanded, instead of requiring named and class plaintiffs to receive the same services in an \ninstitution.  This is precisely what the “most integrated setting” mandate requires. See Olmstead, \n527 U.S. 581, 602-03, 607, 119 S.Ct. 2176 (1999).  \nTo avoid liability under the integration mandate, the burden shifts to the Defendants to \nestablish that the requested accommodation of Medicaid services in the community instead in a \nnursing home would constitute an undue burden or fundamental alteration of its programs. \n  10 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 11 of 21 PageID 384\nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 602-03, 607; Frederick L.. v  Department of Public Welfare, 364 F.3d \n487, 492 n.4 (3rd Cir. 2004), Townsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d  511, 520(9th Cir. 2003). Defendants \ncannot meet that burden in the instant action.    \n  First, Defendants cannot argue that the costs of community-based waiver services will be \nmore costly than these services in a nursing home.  By federal statute, the costs of the Spinal \nCord Waiver must be “cost neutral,” 42 U.S.C. §1396n(c)(4)(A). The federal Medicaid Act \nrequires that the total costs for all the people in a waiver program cannot exceed the costs of the \nsame number of people in a nursing home.   \n  Courts in ADA integration cases have afforded relief to allow individuals with disabilities \nto receive community services. For example, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected \nOklahoma‟s argument that its limitation on a prescription drugs for people receiving services \nthrough a Medicaid HCBS waiver in the community (while providing unlimited prescriptions to \nnursing home residents) was necessary because of the state‟s fiscal crisis. Oklahoma‟s desire to \nsave  funds,  even  if  reasonable,  “does  not  constitute  a  defense”  to  the  ADA‟s  integration \nmandate. Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care Auth., 335 F.3d 1175, 1182 (10th Cir. 2003).  In \nFisher, the court noted “[T]he fact that Oklahoma has a fiscal problem, by itself, does not lead to \nan automatic conclusion that preservation of unlimited medically-necessary prescription benefits \n...will result in a fundamental alteration .... If every alteration in a program or service that \nrequired the outlay of funds were tantamount to a fundamental alteration, the ADA‟s integration \nmandate would be hollow indeed. Id. at 1182-83; Pennsylvania Protection Advocacy, Inc. v. \nDepartment of Welfare, 402 F.3d  374, 381 (3d Cir. 2005); Radaszewski ex rel. Radaszewski v. \nMaram, 383 F.3d 601, 613-15 (7th Cir. 2004); Crabtree v. Goetz,  2008 WL 5330506 at *26 \n(M.D. Tenn. Dec. 19, 2008).  \nIn fact, courts have held that the ADA‟s integration mandate requires states to provide far \nmore costly in-home services than those afforded to Miss Jones in this case. In Crabtree, the \n  11 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 12 of 21 PageID 385\ncourt granted judgment in an ADA integration mandate case to an individual who needed in-\nhome care at a cost of nearly $21,000 per month. The court granted a preliminary injunction to \nrequire the state to continue to provide up to 24 hours per day of skilled care to individuals who \nfaced institutionalization in nursing homes absent such care. In Radaszewski  and Grooms v. \nMaram, 563 F. Supp. 2d 840.859-63(N.D. Ill. 2008) (granting judgment to provide in-home care \nat cost of more than $16,000 per month to person with disability to avoid institutionalization), \nplaintiffs were permitted to seek extensive in-home nursing and home health services.  \n  Second, this is not a case in which Defendants would have to create “new” services for \nMiss Jones or class members. Defendants currently provide the personal care services both in \nnursing homes and in the community. As such, the provision of in-home personal care services \nwould not fundamentally alter Defendants‟ program by forcing them to develop a new service \nfor Miss Jones.  See Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1183 (noting that the plaintiffs were “simply requesting” \na service that the state provided in a nursing home (unlimited prescriptions) to be provided in the \ncommunity and, thus, “are not demanding a separate service or one not already offered by the \nstate”); Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 611 (holding that it is not a fundamental alteration to require \nstates to  simply  adapt  the location of where services  are provided from  institutions  to  the \ncommunity). \n  Third, Defendants do not have a “waiting list that move[s] at a reasonable pace” for \ncommunity services.  Olmstead at 2189.  Defendants‟ Spinal Cord Injury Waiver program caps \nthe number of people who will receive services in the community at 375 through June 30, 2012, \nregardless of: (1) the number of people with spinal cord injuries who are waiting for services;  \n(2) how long they will have to wait for services; and (3) the injury this waiting causes them and \ntheir  families.   Despite  knowing  how  many  individuals  like  Miss Jon es  have  been  on  the \n“waiting list” for the Spinal Cord Injury Waiver, Defendants, have not sought to expand the \nnumber beyond 375.  Defendants do not have a waiting list for community services that can \n  12 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 13 of 21 PageID 386\nmove at a reasonable pace because, as their own documents show, the number of people on the \nwaiting list had not decreased but has increased from 434 to 554 .   \n  Fourth,  modification  of  a  State‟s  Medicaid  Plan  is  not  a  fundamental  alteration.  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs seek a fundamental alteration in service because in order for \nthem to comply they would have to modify their Medicaid program.  This argument is legally \nunsound. The mere fact that Defendants would have to amend its Medicaid Spinal Cord Injury \nWaiver to expand the number of persons eligible to serve Miss Jones and the class is simply not \na fundamental alteration. There is nothing in Olmstead or its progeny that amending a Medicaid \nplan to comply with the ADA is a fundamental alteration.   \nDefendants fail to explain how modification of a Medicaid waiver – in the abstract or \nspecifically in this case -- would rise to a fundamental alteration under Olmstead. This is not \nsurprising since modifying either its Medicaid waiver or the Personal Care Option would not be \ndifficult, costly, or otherwise a fundamental alteration.  States have discretion in designing their \nMedicaid HCBS waivers and have authority to seek amendments from CMS. See Grooms, 563 \nF. Supp. 2d at 857.   Since there is no law or similar barrier that precludes Defendants from \nseeking a modification of the Spinal Cord Injury Waiver, it cannot possibly be a “fundamental \nalteration.”   More importantly, courts have held that it is not a fundamental alteration under the \nADA‟s integration mandate to require states to modify their Medicaid HCBS waivers to provide \nservices to  individuals with  disabilities in  the community.  In  Grooms, the court rejected a \nfundamental alteration defense in a case filed by an individual with complex disabilities to secure \nextensive in-home services and avoid institutionalization. Grooms, 563 F. Supp. 2d at 856-63. \nThe court specifically rejected the state‟s assertion that it would be a fundamental alteration to \nserve the plaintiff in the community because, to do so, the state would have to extend its HCBS \nWaiver to serve individuals who were eligible for hospital-level care in addition to those eligible \nfor nursing facility level of care. Id. at 856-57. \n  13 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 14 of 21 PageID 387\n[R]equiring the State to submit an amendment need not fundamentally alter the ... \nMedicaid waiver program. ... Defendant here presents no basis to believe that the \nfederal government would deny the State‟s application for an amendment in this \ncase and the court will not concoct one. ... Accordingly, the requirement that \n[Defendant] amend its waiver does not constitute a fundamental alteration in the \n... program. \n \nId. at 857; accord Radaszewski, 2008 WL 2097382 at *10, *15 (noting that federal government \nhas always approved state‟s waiver amendments, court held that the state “could modify or alter \nthe waiver ... to meet the community integration contemplated by Olmstead”). \n  Finally, Congress‟ and CMS‟ policies undermine Defendants‟ argument that it would be \na per se fundamental alteration to require a state to amend an HCBS waiver. As the Olmstead \nCourt recognized, the enactment of the HCBS waiver program, 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c), in 1981, \nconstituted a reversal in the prior congressional Medicaid policy that preferred institutional over \ncommunity care. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 601. “[T]he United States points out [as amicus curiae] \nthat the Department of Health and Human Services ... „has a policy of encouraging States to take \nadvantage  of  the  waiver  program  ....”  Id.  Especially  following  Olmstead,  “[t]he  federal \ngovernment  encourages  states  to  use  [HCBS]  waivers  to  attempt  to  achieve  community \nintegration.” Grooms, 563 F. Supp. 2d at 857. \n  More specifically, CMS made clear to state Medicaid directors that the simple fact that \nthe federal Medicaid law allows them to cap HCBS waiver services will not relieve them of \nliability under the ADA‟s integration mandate:  \nMay a State establish a limit on the total number of people who may receive \nservices under an HCBS waiver?   \n \nYes. Under 42 U.S.C. § 441.303(f)(6), States are required to specify the number \nof unduplicated recipients to be served under the HCBS waivers. ... The State \ndoes not have an obligation under Medicaid law to serve more people in the \nHCBS  waiver  than  the  number  requested  by  the  State  and  approved  by  the \nSecretary. If other laws (e.g., ADA) require the State to serve more people, the \nState may do so using non-Medicaid funds or may request an increase in the \nnumber of people permitted under the HCBS waiver. ... Failure to seek or secure \nFederal Medicaid funding does not generally relieve the State of an obligation \n  14 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 15 of 21 PageID 388\nthat might be derived from other legislative sources (beyond Medicaid), such as \nthe ADA). \n \nCMS, Olmstead Update No. 4, at 4 (Jan. 10, 2001) (emphasis in original and added), available at \nhttp://www.cms.hhs.gov/smdl/downloads/smd011001a.pdf. \n  CMS has recognized, once a state has decided to provide services, it must provide those \nservices in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individual -- even if it \nrequires  the  state  to  change  its  Medicaid  program  by  expanding  its  “optional”  community \nprograms. In other words, the state‟s Medicaid program is not exempt from compliance with the \nADA any more than it is exempt from other civil rights laws.  \n  C.  PERSONAL SERVICES \nWhen a State Operates a Program that Includes the Provision of Personal \nServices to Individuals with Disabilities, the ADA’s Title II Regulations \nRequire the State to Provide those Services In the Most Integrated Setting \nAppropriate  \n \n  Defendants argue that the ADA‟s implementing regulations preclude ordering a state to \nprovide personal care assistance as a program modification or reasonable accommodation.  In \nsupport of this argument, Defendants point to 28 C.F.R. 35.135, entitled ”Personal Devices and \nServices,” which provides that the regulations do not:   \nrequire a public entity to provide to individuals with disabilities personal devices, \nsuch  as  wheelchairs;  individually  prescribed  devices,  such  as  prescription \neyeglasses or hearing aids; readers for personal use or study; or services of a \npersonal nature including assistance in eating, toileting, or dressing.   \n \n  According  to  Defendants,  this  regulation  categorically  exempts  public  entities  from \nhaving to provide any personal services (such as the types of services Miss Jones and other \npeople with spinal cord injuries require to reside in the community) to a qualified individual with \na disability as part of a program modification.  However, Defendants over-read this regulation.   \n  The personal devices and services regulation is intended to make clear that public entities \nare  not  generally  required  to  provide  personal  devices  and  services  to  individuals  with \n  15 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 16 of 21 PageID 389\ndisabilities, where the provision of such devices and services is not otherwise a part of the \nprogram or service the entity provides.  In the instant matter, Defendants‟ Spinal Cord Injury \nWaiver already provides precisely the personal care services Ms. Jones and class plaintiffs \nrequest.  Defendants already provide these personal services via their Medicaid program in their \nWaivers, nursing homes and Personal Care Option in assisted living facilities. Plaintiffs are not \nrequesting a service that is not presently provided.  Where a public entity, like Defendants, \nalready operate a program or provide a service that includes the provision of personal services – \nsuch as a program providing waiver services and nursing home services – it cannot discriminate \nagainst individuals with disabilities in the provision of those services.             \n  The  personal  services  regulation  does  not  alter  the  State‟s  obligations  under  the \nintegration regulation. The two provisions must be read together.  In order to have the force of \nlaw,  the  regulations  implementing  Title  II  –  including  the  personal  devices  and  services \nregulation – must reasonably enforce Title II‟s nondiscrimination mandate.  The Supreme Court \nhas already held that the prohibition on discrimination in the statute itself encompasses a ban on \nunjustified isolation or segregation. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597, 600, 119 S. Ct. at 2185, 2187.   \n  The personal devices and services regulation cannot, therefore, exempt the State from \nTitle II‟s requirement that public entities provide programs and services in a setting that is \nneither isolated nor segregated. Indeed, every ADA integration mandate decision involved the \nprovision of personal services to the plaintiffs. In Olmstead, supra,  Radaszewsk, supra,  Fisher, \nsupra,  Crabtree, supra, and Grooms, plaintiffs all sought extensive in-home nursing and home \nhealth services. In Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325 (3d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 813 \n(1995), the plaintiff sought precisely the same in-home attendant care services that Miss Jones \nand the other class members seek.   \n  It is true that Title II would not require the State to provide personal services if the State \ndid not already include such services as part of its program.  However, Florida already provides \n  16 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 17 of 21 PageID 390\npersonal  services to  individuals  in  need of such services  in  nursing homes, to  almost  375 \nindividuals in need of such services who are living in the community and are enrolled in the \nState‟s Spinal Cord Waiver program, and to persons in assisted living facilities who require these \nservices.  \nThe issue in this case is whether, and to what extent, the integration mandate requires \nFlorida to provide services (including personal services) in the community to plaintiff class \nmembers  who  would  otherwise  receive  such  services  only  in  nursing  homes.  Because  the \nintegration mandate requires that the personal services provided in nursing homes be provided to \nclass members in the community, the personal services regulation does not bar relief.  \n  D.  RES JUDICATA \n    The Dubois Settlement Agreement Is Not Res Judicata and Does Not \nPreclude the Instant Action \n \n  Defendants argue that the settlement agreement, class definition and order of dismissal in \nDubois v. Levine, CA. No. 4:03-cv-107 (N.D. Fla.)(attached to Defendants‟ motion) raises issue \nor  claim  preclusion  that  bars  the  instant  action.    The  class  definition  in  Dubois  was  “all \nindividuals with traumatic brain or spinal cord injuries who the state has already determine or \nwill determine to be eligible to receive services from Florida‟s Medicaid Waiver Program for \npersons with traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries and have not received such services.”   \n  Defendants never discuss the actual terms of the Settlement Agreement, but rather argue \nthat all persons with spinal cord injuries who are or may anytime in the future be eligible for \nwaiver services are barred in perpetuity from litigating claims of discrimination.  Defendants‟ \nargument consumes all people with a spinal cord injury, whether or not they had had a spinal \ncord injury when the Dubois Settlement Agreement was signed by counsel on October 3, 2006 or \nwhen the Court signed the Order of Dismissal on January 4, 2007. \n  17 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 18 of 21 PageID 391\n  A review of the actual terms of the Settlement Agreement does not support Defendants‟ \nbroad interpretation.  Rather, the explicit terms show that the class and Settlement Agreement \nwere time-limited.  By its terms, the Dubois Settlement Agreement ended at the end of FY 2008-\n2009, i.e., June 30, 2009.  Specifically, ¶C(1) of the Settlement Agreement states: \nDOH shall make it a priority to seek funding that will be sufficient to expand the \nTBI/SCI Waiver program by a minimum of 50 slots for FY 2006-07, 75 slots for \nFY 2007-08 and 75 slots for FY 2008-09.  DOH shall use its best efforts to have \nits legislative budget request, with each of these stated waiver slot increases for \neach year, included as part of the Governor‟s recommended budget and to obtain \nthe necessary legislative support and funding for this expansion of waiver slots.  \nDOH shall support this request and shall use its best efforts to obtain legislative \napproval of the expansion in each of these fiscal years. (Emphases added.)   \n \n  Defendants have no legal duty under the Settlement Agreement terms after FY 2008-09.  \nAny failure to provide Medicaid services to Miss Jones or anyone else beyond FY 2008-09 was \nneither covered nor contemplated by the Dubois terms.  Certainly, until the end of FY 2008-09, \npersons with a spinal cord injury who were members of the class could not bring individual \nactions for discrimination.   However, there is nothing in the Dubois agreement to preclude Miss \nJones, or anyone else, from litigating after FY 2008-09.  Defendants‟ argument would prevent \nanyone with a spinal cord injury in 2020 or anytime in the future from ever litigating a claim of \ndiscrimination. \n  Other references to dates in the Settlement Agreement also show that the parties intended \nthat the Dubois agreement have a limited or set application for a set period of time:   \nat  ¶B(5),  it  was  agreed  that  “[t]hrough  January  2009,  DOH  shall  provide \nPlaintiffs‟  counsel  with  a  copy  of  any  proposed  changes  to  IOPs  [Internal \nOperating Procedures] at least 30 days prior to their authorization;”  \n \nat ¶B(6), “[t]hrough January 2009, DOH shall provide Plaintiffs‟ counsel with a \ncopy  of  any  proposed  changes  to  the  brochures  at  least  30  days  prior  to \nauthorization;”  \n \nat ¶B(9), “Plaintiffs agree that all requirements upon Defendants of copies or \nnotice  that  run  through  January  2009  contained  in  this  agreement  are  fully \ncomplied by Defendants by sending such copies or notice to Southern Legal \nCounsel, Inc. At the address supplied below;” and  \n  18 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 19 of 21 PageID 392\n \nat ¶C(3), “through June 2009, AHCA agrees to provide Plaintiffs‟ counsel with \ncopies of any approved amendments or renewals, to the state‟s current TBI/SCI \nWaiver  Program  application  (approved  as  of  June  2002)  within  30  days  of \nnotification of approval by CMS (for approved amendments), including but not \nlimited  to  any  amendments  to  the  number  of  waiver  slots,  applied  for  and \napproved by CMS.” (Emphases added.) \n \n  The  terms  of  the  Settlement  Agreement  do  not  suggest  that  it  would  continue  in \nperpetuity or that persons would be barred after the terms expired.  To the contrary, Defendants \nhad  no  legal  duties  under  the  Dubois  Settlement  Agreement  after  the  FY  2008-09  ended.  \nNevertheless, Defendants now argue that members of the class are somehow bound forever.   \n  “[A] prior judgment is res judicata only as to suits involving the same cause of action.”  \nLawlor v. Nat’l Screen Service Corp., 349 U.S. 322, 329 (1955).  While a “judgment precludes \nrecovery on claims arising prior to its entry, it cannot be given the effect of extinguishing claims \nwhich did not even then exist and which could not possibly have been ruled upon in the previous \ncase.”  Id. at 328.  Thus, the resolution of the Dubois action does not bar a subsequent lawsuit \nthat challenges the conduct that occurred after resolution of the first lawsuit.  A new claim of \ndiscrimination is created as the conduct continues since a claim cannot be asserted based on facts \nnot yet in existence.  See, e.g., Lawlor, 349 U.S. at 327-29; Arizona v. California, 530 U.S. 392, \n414 (2000)(class action settlement agreements cannot result  issue preclusion when the issues are \nnot adjudicated on the merits),  United States v. International Bldg. Co., 345 U.S. 502 (1953). \nCourts may bar the litigation of subsequent claims that were not formally presented to the \ncourt only if the settlement reflects an intention to preclude such later and/or unrelated claims \n(e.g., through a broad release). 18 Federal Practice & Procedure § 4443 at 386-87; e.g., In re \nPrudential Ins. Co. of America Sales Practice Litig., 261 F.3d at 366-67.  The Dubois Settlement \nAgreement contains no release whatsoever, let alone a release suggesting that the putative class \nmembers  relinquished  claims  beyond  the  terms  of  the  Settlement  Agreement.  What  makes \nDefendants‟ claim and issue preclusion arguments even more absurd is that the parties explicitly \n  19 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 33    Filed 01/13/10   Page 20 of 21 PageID 393\nrecognized and stated that “the execution of this Agreement by Defendants and/or approval of \nthe same [by the Court] shall not operate in any manner to confer continuing jurisdiction.” (¶C(7) \n(Emphasis added).   \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the above reasons, Defendants‟ motion to dismiss should be denied. \n \n \n            Respectfully submitted,          \n \n            s/ Stephen F.

Case No. 3:09-CV-1170-J34JRK \n \n \nTHOMAS ARNOLD, in his official  \ncapacity as Secretary, Florida Agency for  \nHealth Care Administration, and  \n \nDr. ANNA VIAMONTE ROSS,  \nin her official capacity \nas Secretary, Florida Department of \nHealth,  \n \n  Defendants.   \n____________________________________ \n \nPLAINTIFF MICHELE HADDAD’S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION,  \nEXPEDITED HEARING AND MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT \n \n  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, individual Plaintiff Michele Haddad, through her counsel, moves \n  for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendants from denying her with Medicaid home and \ncommunity-based  services  (“HCBS”),  in  order  to  prevent  Plaintiff  Haddad’s  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization in a nursing home. Due to the emergency nature of her situation, Plaintiff Haddad \nfurther moves for an expedited hearing. As grounds therefore, Plaintiff Haddad states: \n  1.  This action is brought on behalf of a Florida resident who has quadriplegia as a result of a \ncar accident. Plaintiff Haddad is on Medicaid.  Plaintiff Haddad has successfully lived in the community \nsince the accident and desires to continue to reside in her own home and community instead of having to \nenter a nursing facility.  She could continue to reside in the community with appropriate services \n \n1 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 2 of 26 PageID 543\n \nprovided with Medicaid funds. She is at imminent risk of being unnecessarily institutionalized because \nof Defendants’ failure to administer their Medicaid services, programs and activities in an appropriate, \nintegrated community setting. \n  2.   Michele Haddad is a named plaintiff in this action. She was born on August 1, 1960 and \nis forty-nine years old. See Declaration of Michelle Haddad, attached hereto as exhibit 1. \n  3.  Plaintiff Haddad lives in a fully accessible home in Jacksonville, Florida. When she was \n47, on September 7, 2007, she was in a motor cycle accident caused by an intoxicated car driver. She \nbroke her spine as a result of the accident. Id.  \n4.    On or about November, 2007, when she was still hospitalized in Brooks Rehabilitation, \nMs. Haddad applied to Defendants’ Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Program to receive home health care \nthrough the Spinal Cord Injury Medicaid Waiver. She has been on the “wait list” for in-home Waiver \nservices nearly three years. Id.  \n5.  Miss Haddad was recently contacted by the Spinal Cord Injury Waiver and told they have \nno funds to provide her with services.  However, if she would enter a nursing home for 60 days, then \nDefendants would provide her with 10 hours a day of attendant care services in the community. Id.  \n6.  Miss  Haddad  does  not  want  to  live  in  a  nursing  home  but  wants  services  in  the \ncommunity. Id. \n7.  She is unable to open her right hand and she cannot close her left hand.  As a result she \nhas minimal manual dexterity. Id. \n  8.  Ms. Haddad uses a motorized wheelchair for ambulation. Id. \n  9.  Between January 2008, when Ms. Haddad was discharged from Brooks Rehabilitation \nHospital, and March 2010, Ms. Haddad’s husband was her primary caregiver.  In November, 2009, after \n \n2 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 3 of 26 PageID 544\n \n24 years of marriage, the Haddads divorced.  Mr. Haddad remained in the family home and continued to \nserve as her primary caregiver until March 2010, when he left the home. Id. \n10.        O ne of Ms. Haddad’s two adult sons, Anthony, 24, has left his home in Miami to \ntemporarily move in with his mother to provide her with the care she requires in order to remain in the \ncommunity.  See Declaration of Michelle Haddad. \n11.       Ms.  Haddad’s  son  Anthony  now  is  responsible  for  the  tasks  that  her  husband  had \nprovided since the accident: transferring her out of bed to a wheelchair, bathing her, helping her with her \nhygiene needs, dressing her, shopping for food, preparing meals, assisting her with eating, and at the end \nof the day performing the same functions to assist her to get into bed. Id. \n12.  Further, Ms.  Haddad uses a catheter and requires a bowel program.   Her husband was \nresponsible for these toilet needs.  Since March, when Ms. Haddad’s husband left the house, her son, \nAnthony, has had to perform the exact same very personal care for her. Id. \n13.  In early March, 2010, Ms. Haddad again contacted Defendants’ Brain and Spinal Cord \nInjury Program.  She notified the Program that her husband and primary caregiver had moved out and \nshe desperately required Medicaid Waiver services because the only help she was receiving was from \nher son, Anthony. Id. \n14.  Anthony cannot continue to provide services to his mother and has only temporarily \nreturned  home  from  Miami.  Anthony  recently  graduated  from  Florida  International  University  in \nDecember, 2009, majoring in international relations and marketing.  Anthony only returned home to \ncare for his mother due to the exigent circumstances -- his parents’ divorce, his father leaving the house, \nand his mother having no one to care for her.  Anthony intends to move back to Miami, and without the \n \n3 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 4 of 26 PageID 545\n \nservices he has been providing in the home, Ms. Haddad will be forced to enter an unnecessarily \nsegregated setting. See Declaration of Michelle Haddad.   \n15.  Ms. Haddad does not want to go into a nursing home; instead, she wants to continue \nresiding in the community, where she has an active life. Id. \n16.  In  the  community,  she  attends  church,  goes  to  the  movies,  visits  friends  and  goes \nshopping.  She uses the gymnasium at Brooks Rehabilitation Hospital’s out-patient unit for exercise. Id.   \n17.  She does not think it is appropriate for her son to provide the activities of daily living \nwhich she requires (including very private tasks). Id. \n18.  She owns her house which is accessible with a ramp, roll-in shower, and a hoyer lift.    \nHer sole source of income is her monthly Social Security Disability Insurance, and she is eligible for and \nreceives both Medicare and Medicaid. Id. \n19.  Without community-based Spinal Cord Waiver services, Ms. Haddad is at risk of being \ninstitutionalized, even though she desperately does not want to reside in a nursing facility.  Ms. Haddad \nhas lost her primary caregiver and lacks the natural supports that she previously relied on in order to live \nin the community. Id. \n20.  Despite Defendants knowing that Ms. Haddad is at imminent risk of institutionalization, \nthey have not offered her any Medicaid services so she could remain in the community. Id. \n21.  Ms. Haddad has been eligible for Florida’s Medicaid nursing home services since she \nbroke her spine in 2007.  She still meets Florida’s level of care for nursing home eligibility. Id.   \n  22.  Florida’s Medicaid nursing home reimbursement is approximately $178 per diem.   \n23.  Defendants  have  a  community-based  Medicaid  Traumatic  Brain  Injury/Spinal  Cord \nMedicaid Waiver but its capacity is limited, providing 375 slots. Id. \n \n4 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 5 of 26 PageID 546\n \n24.  Defendants have certified to the federal Medicaid agency, the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, that for each person Florida diverts from the nursing home and provides Waiver \nservices in the community, the State and the federal government save approximately $20,000 a year. Id. \n25.  Despite these savings and knowing that Plaintiff Haddad is in imminent risk of nursing \nhome placement, Defendants have refused to provide Miss Haddad with services in her home. Id. \n26.  Plaintiff Haddad needs Defendants’ Medicaid HCBS benefits to assist her with activities \nof daily living. These services could be provided to Plaintiff Haddad either pursuant to “waiver” services \nor “personal care services,” see 42 U.S.C. §§1396n(c) and 1396d(a)(24), both of which are part of the \nFlorida’s Medicaid program. \n27.  Unfortunately, Waiver services have not been made available to Plaintiff Haddad, even \nthough she applied for home and community-based services and is on a waiting list.  Michele Haddad’s \nadvocates have telephoned Defendants’ Jacksonville Medicaid Waiver office regarding waiver services, \nbut none have been provided and no one could tell her when services would be provided for her in the \ncommunity.   \n28.    Further, the personal care option service under the state plan is currently unavailable to \nMs. Haddad in her community placement because the service is limited in Florida to persons with \ndisabilities who reside only in assistive living facilities (not to individuals who live in their own \napartments or houses). \n29.  To obtain the necessary services, Defendants require that Plaintiff Haddad leave the \ncommunity and enter a Medicaid-funded nursing facility setting. Defendants’ Medicaid program will \nonly provide the services she requires by paying for her institutionalization in a nursing facility.  \n \n5 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 6 of 26 PageID 547\n \n30.  Plaintiff Haddad will imminently have no option other than to enter into a nursing home \nwhere Defendants’ Medicaid program will pay for the same services she can and has received in the \ncommunity. \n31.  Defendants refuse to offer her the services in the community and instead are requiring her \nto enter  a nursing facility to receive those services, in violation of both the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (“ADA”), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794a (“Section \n504\"), and their implementing regulations, in particular the “integration mandate,” which requires that  \n“a  public  entity  shall  administer  services,  programs,  and  activities  in  the  most  integrated  setting \nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R.§ 35.130(d). \nWHEREFORE Plaintiff Haddad seeks a preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendants from \ndenying her services in the community to assist her with her daily living activities. \nI.   Plaintiff Meets the Standards for Preliminary Injunctive Relief \n \n  The criteria for granting a preliminary injunction are (1) a strong likelihood of success on the \nmerits, (2) the possibility of irreparable injury to plaintiff if the preliminary relief is not granted; (3) a \nbalance of hardships favoring the plaintiff; and (4) advancement of the public interest. Schiavo Ex Rel. \nSchindler v. Schiavo, 403 F.3d 1223 (11th Cir. 2005). The grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is \nalmost always based on an abbreviated set of facts, requiring a delicate balancing of the probability of \nultimate success at final hearing with the consequences of immediate irreparable injury, which could \nflow from the denial of preliminary relief. Siegal v. Lepore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1178 (11th Cir. 2000). If the \nother factors weigh in favor of granting relief, Plaintiff has only to show a substantial case on the merits \nof the claim. Schiavo, 403 F.3d at 1226. \n  In the instant case, Plaintiff Haddad raises a very strong likelihood of ultimate success on the \n \n6 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 7 of 26 PageID 548\n \nmerits  under  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  42 U .S.C.  §  12101  et  seq.  (“ADA”),  and  the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794a (“Section 504”), and their implementing regulations; a \nvery strong probability of irreparable injury; and both the balance of hardships and public interests \nweigh significantly in her favor. Accordingly, Plaintiff Haddad is entitled to preliminary injunctive \nrelief.  \nII.   Likelihood of Success \n  A.   Defendants’ Responsibilities under the HCBS TBI/SCI Waiver \n  Medicaid is a joint federal/state program authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act. 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1396-1396v. It provides medical assistance to low income individuals who meet certain \neligibility requirements. States are not required to participate in the Medicaid program. If a state elects to \nparticipate,  however,  it  is  required  to  comply  with  all  applicable  federal  statutory  and  regulatory \nrequirements. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a; Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Ass'n, 496 U.S. 498, 502 (1990); Florida \nAss'n of Rehab. Facilities, Inc. v. Florida Dep't of Health & Rehab. Servs., 225 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th \nCir. 2000). \n  Medicaid home and community-based services (HCBS) waiver 1 programs are authorized by 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396n(c) and governed by 42 C.F.R. §§ 441.300-.310. Waiver programs enable states to \nprovide home and community-based services to individuals with disabilities who would otherwise need \n                                                 \n1  States that opt to provide waiver services may “waive” the requirements of statewideness, \ncomparability and income requirements for which a state’s other Medicaid services and programs must \notherwise comply with 42 U.S.C.§1396n(c)(3). The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices has approved nine waivers in Florida for people who would otherwise require care in a nursing \nfacility.  Ms. Haddad meets the eligibility criteria for Florida’s Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord \nInjury Waiver (“TBI/SCI”). \n \n7 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 8 of 26 PageID 549\n \nthe level of care provided in the institutional nursing home.2  Personal care assistant services (PCA) is  \none of the services that can be provided through a waiver. 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(4)(6). Medicaid waiver \nprograms must, in the aggregate, be cost-neutral, in that the total average cost of providing care for \nprogram participants in the home and community based setting must not exceed the estimated total \naverage cost of providing care in the institutional setting that these participants would require. 42 U.S.C. \n§1396n(c)(2)(D), 42 C.F.R. §441.302(e). \n  Florida’s Medicaid waiver program is one of the two Medicaid programs which could prevent \nMs. Haddad’s imminent institutionalization. The other Medicaid program is the “personal care services” \nbenefits, a/k/a “personal care option.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(a)(24). Under the program, states like Florida \nprovide personal attendant services such as Plaintiff Haddad requires. However, Florida has opted to \nlimit its personal care services benefits to only those persons who reside in its Medicaid funded assisted \nliving facilities and does not provide these services to persons who reside in their own apartments or \nhomes. \n  B.   The ADA and Section 504 \n  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794a (“Section 504”) is “commonly \nknown as the civil rights bill of the disabled,” Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transp. \n(ADAPT) v. Skinner, 881 F.2d 1184, 1187 ( 3d Cir. 1989) (en banc), and prohibits disability-based \ndiscrimination by recipients of federal funding, such as Defendants. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Extending the \nprohibitions of Section 504, in 1990, Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n12101 et seq. (ADA), to prohibit discrimination by all public entities, regardless of whether they receive \nfederal funding. H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 49 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 267, 472.  \n                                                 \n2  The Florida Medicaid per diem reimbursement is $178.45 on average for an annual \naverage reimbursement o f $ 65, 134.25.  See, www.fdhc.state.fl.us?Medicaid/cost_reim/nh_fates.shtml. \n \n8 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 9 of 26 PageID 550\n \nLike Section 504, Title II of the ADA broadly prohibits discrimination by public entities, such as \nDefendants. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131(1), 12132. The ADA and Section 504 are analyzed together since \n“there is no significant difference in the analysis of rights and obligations created by the two.” Zulke v. \nRegents of the Univ. of Calif., 166 F.3d 1041, 1045 n.11 (9th Cir. 1999). The ADA provides that the \n“remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in [Section 504] shall be the remedies, procedures and rights \n[applicable  to  ADA  claims].”  42 U .S.C.  §  12133.  Section  504 a nd  the  ADA  reflect  Congress’ \nrecognition of the pervasiveness of disability-based discrimination in society. Congress specifically \nfound that “discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as ... health \nservices ....” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(3) (ADA) (emphasis added); see also 29 U.S.C. § 701(a)(5) (Section \n504). \n  The concept of “discrimination” under these Acts encompasses more than disparate treatment of \npeople with disabilities vis-à-vis individuals without disabilities. See Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, \n598 (1999) (ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 297, 300-01 (1984) (Section 504); Shelen L. v. \nDiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 333, 335 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 813 (1995) (ADA); Nathanson v. \nMedical College of Penn., 926 F.2d 1368, 1384 (3d Cir. 1991) (Section 504). The Supreme Court in \nOlmstead  made  it c lear  that  the  state  cannot  discriminate  between  people  with  disabilities  while \nproviding such care for “categorically needy” persons. 3 \n  Title II of the ADA prohibits public entities from discriminating against persons with disabilities. \n                                                 \n3  The ADA also prohibits discrimination against different categories of people between \npeople with disabilities while providing such care for “categorically needy” persons with disabilities. \nTownsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511 (9th Cir. 2003), Helen L., supra. In Townsend, the plaintiffs alleged \nthat the state was using Medicaid’s home and community based waiver services (“HCBS”) to provide \nessential long term care to some residents with disabilities, but not to others. The Court held that the \nstate violated the ADA by denying community-based long term care for “medically needy” persons. \n \n \n9 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 10 of 26 PageID 551\n \n42 U.S.C. § 12132.4  A “qualified individual with a disability” is a person who “with or without \nreasonable modifications to rules, polices or practices” meets the “essential eligibility requirements for \nthe receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 12132(2). Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff Haddad is a qualified person with a disability \nwho meets the eligibility requirements for Florida’s Medicaid nursing home “level of care” as well as \nfor its waiver and Medicaid programs. \n  C.   The ADA and Section 504’s Integration Mandate \n  Under  both  the  ADA  and  Section  504,  the  Attorney  General  was  directed  to  promulgate \nimplementing regulations. 42 U.S.C. § 12134(a); 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). See Helen L., supra. Congress \nfurther directed that the regulations promulgated under Title II of the ADA be consistent with the \nregulations adopted under Section 504. 42 U.S.C. §12134(b). For purposes of implementing Title II of \nthe  ADA,  the  Attorney  General  promulgated  a  regulation  requiring  public  entities  to  “administer \nservices, programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \nindividuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). The regulation was based upon virtually identical \nregulatory language promulgated to implement Section 504 with respect to federal financial recipients. \n28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d). These two regulations, known as the “integration mandate,” are construed and \napplied in the same manner. Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care Auth., 335 F.3d 1175, 1179 n.3 (10th Cir. \n                                                 \n4  Similarly, Section 504 prohibits the recipients of federal funds from discriminating on the \nbasis of disability:  \n \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability...shall, solely by reason of her \nor his disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected  to  discrimination  under  any  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal \nfinancial assistance.... \n \n29 U.S.C. §794(a). \n \n \n10 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 11 of 26 PageID 552\n \n2003). \n  The integration mandate was analyzed and interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in the \nlandmark decision of Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). The Olmstead plaintiffs were individuals \nwith mental disabilities who were confined in Georgia’s state psychiatric institutions, but who wanted to \nlive in the community. Plaintiffs asserted that the state’s refusal to pay for them to live in community \nsettings violated the integration mandate of Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations. The \nCourt was thus presented with the question of whether the proscription of disability discrimination may \nrequire the placement of individuals with disabilities in community settings rather than institutions. Id. at \n587. \n  The Court began its analysis by citing the relevant Congressional findings that serve as the \nunderpinnings for the ADA: \n(2)   historically,  society  has  tended  to  isolate  and  segregate  individuals  with \ndisabilities, and despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against \nindividuals  with  disabilities  continue  to  be  a  serious  and  pervasive  societal \nproblem; \n(3)   discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas \nas...institutionalization...; \n(5)   individuals  with  disabilities  continually  encounter  various  forms  of \ndiscrimination,  including  outright  intentional  exclusion...failure  to  make \nreasonable modifications to existing facilities and practices, [and] segregation... \n \n42 U.S.C. §12101(a)(2), (3) & (5) (emphasis added) (quoted in Olmstead, 527 U.S.at 588-89).  The \nCourt’s decision was premised on the DOJ integration regulation: \nA public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities. \n     \n28 C.F.R.§ 35.130(d).   \n  After noting the comprehensive scope of discrimination embraced by the ADA, the Olmstead \nCourt explained the nature of discrimination prohibited by Title II of the ADA in the context of the \n \n11 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 12 of 26 PageID 553\n \nintegration mandate: \nRecognition that unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form of \ndiscrimination reflects two evident judgments. First, institutional placement of persons \nwho  can  handle  and  benefit  from  community  settings  perpetuates  unwarranted \nassumptions  that  persons  so  isolated  are  incapable  or  unworthy  of  participating  in \ncommunity life. Second, confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday \nlife activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, \neconomic independence, educational advancement and cultural enrichment.  Dissimilar \ntreatment exists in the key respect: In order to receive needed medical services, persons \nwith  ...  disabilities  must,  because  of  those  disabilities,  relinquish  participation  in \ncommunity  life  they  could  enjoy  given  reasonable  accommodations,  while  persons \nwithout [such] disabilities can receive the medical services they need without similar \nsacrifice. \n \n527 U.S. at 600-601 (citations omitted; emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court concluded, more than \nnine years ago, that “unjustified isolation, we hold, is properly regarded as discrimination based on \ndisability.” Id. at 597.  \n  The facts of the case at bar clearly demonstrate that Plaintiff Haddad will suffer discrimination. \nThere can be no doubt that for Plaintiff Haddad that the “most integrated setting” for her is her own \nhome. By living at home and participating in the community, she has been able to experience and \nbenefit from church activities, family relations, social contacts, educational advancement, and cultural \nenrichment of which the Supreme Court spoke. Being forced to move to a nursing home solely to \nreceive the personal attendant care services that Plaintiff Haddad needs for her activities of daily living \nis exactly the sort of discrimination recognized in Olmstead (recognizing discrimination where “[i]n \norder to receive needed medical services, persons with [] disabilities must, because of those disabilities, \nrelinquish participation in community life they could enjoy given reasonable accommodations, while \npersons without [] disabilities can receive the medical services they need without similar sacrifice.  See \nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 6-7, 17.”  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 601. Defendants’ refusal to \nprovide Medicaid funds for her in the community and its failure to grant a reasonable modification to its \n \n12 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 13 of 26 PageID 554\n \nexisting Medicaid programs that would allow her to remain in the community plainly falls within the \ndisability discrimination condemned by the Supreme Court in Olmstead.  The ADA and Section 504 \nclearly prohibit conditioning receipt of a public service or program on a person being institutionalized.  \nThat was the bedrock of the Olmstead decision. It also demonstrates Judge Ferguson’s conclusion that \n“underfunding of the Home and Community-Based Waiver program compels institutionalization, thus \nnegating a meaningful choice.” Cramer v. Chiles, 33 F.Supp.2d 1342, 1353 (S.D. Fla.1999).   \n  Plaintiff Haddad is at imminent risk of being forced into a nursing home. Due to Defendants’ \nfailure  to  provide  services  in  the  most  integrated  setting,  she  will  be  forced  to  relinquish  her \nindependence in order to receive necessary assistance with her activities of daily living.  Ms. Haddad’s \nunjustified  isolation  triggers  the  concerns  driving  the  Court  in  Olmstead,  of  (1)  “perpetuat[ing] \nunwarranted  assumptions  that  persons  so  isolated  are  incapable  or  unworthy  of  participating  in \ncommunity life” and (2) “severely diminish[ing]” plaintiff’s “everyday life activities…including family \nrelations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural \nenrichment.”  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 601.  Forcing Ms. Haddad to receive services in a nursing home \nsetting will cut her off from the community activities she enjoys, including attending church, going to \nthe movies, visiting friends, going shopping, and exercising. \n  Further, Plaintiff Haddad need not wait until she enters the nursing home to bring a suit under \nOlmstead:   the   risk  of  institutionalization  that  plaintiff  faces  is  itself  discrimination.  In  Fisher  v. \nOklahoma Health Care Auth., 335 F. 3d 1175 (10th Cir. 2003), Oklahoma had changed its Medicaid \nprescription program so that persons in the community would be entitled to receive no more than five \nprescriptions  per  month.  However,  if  persons  resided  in  a  nursing  facility,  they  could  receive  an \nunlimited number of prescriptions. The Fisher Circuit emphasized that “failure to provide Medicaid \n \n13 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 14 of 26 PageID 555\n \nservices in a community-based setting may constitute a form of discrimination.” Id. at 1182. The Tenth \nCircuit noted that the protections in the ADA’s “integration regulation,” 28 C.F.R. §35.130(d), \nwould be meaningless if plaintiffs were required to segregate themselves by entering an \ninstitution before they could challenge an allegedly discrimination law or policy that \nthreatens to force them into segregated isolation. [W]hile it is true that plaintiffs in \nOlmstead were institutionalized at the time they brought their claim, nothing in the \nOlmstead  decision  supports  a  conclusion  that  institutionalization  is  a prerequisite  to \nenforcement of the ADA’s integration requirements.  \n \nId. at 1181. See also Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599, 611 (7th Cir. 2004), Crabtree v. Goetz, 2008 \nU.S.Dist. LEXIS 103097 (M.D. Tenn. 2008). \n  This same principle applies to Plaintiff Haddad. In the community, she currently receives no \nMedicaid-funded personal attendant care services to assist her with her activities of daily living. If she is \nforced  to  enter  a  nursing  home  in  order  to  receive  these  services,  she  will  be  “unnecessarily \ninstitutionalized,” precisely the type of discrimination that Congress intended to end with the enactment \nof the ADA and Section 504. By requiring Plaintiff Haddad to move to a nursing facility to receive the \nsame services she could receive in the community, Florida is conditioning the receipt of these Medicaid \nservices on living in an institutional setting, i.e., the nursing facility, which is segregated, instead of \nproviding them to her in the community. \n  D.   Defendants  Violate  the  ADA  and  Section  504 b y  Failing  to  Make  Reasonable \nModifications and Accommodations in their Policies, Practices, and Procedures \n \n  Section 504 and the ADA prohibit actions by covered entities that have a discriminatory effect \non people with disabilities. See Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. at 297; Frederick L. v. Department of \nPublic Welfare, 364 F.3d 487 (3d Cir. 2004), 422 F.3d 151 (3d 2005). Both the ADA and Section 504 \naffirmatively require that covered entities make reasonable modifications and accommodations to their \npolicies and practices when necessary to accommodate individuals with disabilities, see Olmstead, 527 \n \n14 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 15 of 26 PageID 556\n \nU.S. at 592; Alexander, 469 U.S. at 301, and require that people with disabilities have “meaningful \naccess” to covered entities’ programs. Id.; Chaffin v. Kansas State Fair Bd., 348 F.3d 850, 857 (10th \nCir. 2003); Crabtree, supra.  \n  In the present action, Defendants’ failure to make reasonable modifications and accommodations \nresults  in  Plaintiff  Haddad  being  denied  “meaningful  access”  to  either  Florida’s  Medicaid  waiver \nprograms or its Medicaid personal care services benefits. Because Florida has restricted its Medicaid \npersonal care services benefits, 42 USC § 1396d(a)(24), to persons residing in assisted living facilities, \nPlaintiff Haddad is not able to benefit from either Florida’s Medicaid waiver program or its Medicaid \npersonal care services program.  Similarly, because Florida has capped its TBI/SCI waiver and has not \nincreased it for a number of years to meet the needs of people on the wait list generally, including Ms. \nHaddad’s needs in the community,  an accommodation that is easy to accomplish,  Florida’s Medicaid \nprogram  refuses to make the reasonable modification and accommodation in this program which will \nensure Ms. Haddad remains in her home and is not discriminated against. \n  Beginning with Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 410 (1979), the courts \nhave recognized that Section 504 requires publicly funded programs to provide reasonable modifications \nand accommodations when needed to assure that people with disabilities have meaningful access to its \nprograms and services. See Alexander, 469 U.S. at 300-01 & n.20-21. Title II of the ADA requires: \nA public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures \nwhen the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, \nunless  the  public  entity  can  demonstrate  that  making  the  modifications  would \nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program or activity. \n \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) (authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 12134(b)). \n  The concept of reasonable modification recognizes that strictly “equal” treatment of people with \ndisabilities will not assure meaningful access. See Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 273, 274-75 \n \n15 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 16 of 26 PageID 557\n \n(2d Cir. 2003). Accordingly, the ADA and Section 504 require accommodations assuring that otherwise \nneutral policies and practices do not, in practice, discriminate against people with disabilities by denying \nthem meaningful access to the covered entity’s programs and services. Id., see also US Airways, Inc. v. \nBarnett,  535 U .S.  391,  397 ( 2002)  (in  ADA  employment  discrimination  case,  “preferences  will \nsometimes prove necessary to achieve the Act's basic equal opportunity goal”). For example, Section \n504 and the ADA also prohibit discrimination on the basis of the severity of a person’s disability. In \nJackson v. Fort Stanton Hosp. & Training School, 757 F. Supp. 1243 (D.N.M. 1990), rev’d on other \ngrounds, 964 F.2d 980 (10th Cir. 1992), plaintiffs with developmental disabilities challenged their \nexclusion from the state’s community services program because of the severity of their disabilities. In \nthat case, people with severe disabilities were precluded from living in community settings because the \nprograms lacked amenities that could be reasonably furnished that were necessary to accommodate their \nserious needs. The Court found that “Defendants’ failure to accommodate the severely handicapped in \nexisting  community  programs  while  serving  less  severely  handicapped  peers  is  unreasonable  and \ndiscriminatory.” Id. at 1299.  It concluded that: \nmodifications  of  the  existing  community  service  system  in  New  Mexico  would  not \nrequire  an  excessive  financial  burden  and  that  the  accommodations  would  enable \nseverely  handicapped  residents  of  [residential  facilities]  to  realize  the  benefits  of \ncommunity  settings.  Accordingly,  the  defendants  should  require  those  community \nprograms that receive federal assistance funds to make reasonable accommodations for \nthose severely handicapped residents [of facilities] whose IDTs have determined that a \ncommunity program could be appropriate, if reasonably modified. \n \nId. at 1299. See also Williams v. Wasserman, 937 F. Supp. 524, 530 (D. Md. 1996) (“while the ADA \ndoes not place an affirmative obligation on the state to create or fundamentally alter a program of \ncommunity-based  treatment  options,  the  ADA  does  oblige  the  defendants  to  make  those  options \navailable to otherwise qualified individuals without regard to the severity ... of their disabilities”); \n \n16 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 17 of 26 PageID 558\n \nMartin v. Voinovich, 840 F. Supp. 1175, 1192 (S.D. Ohio 1993) (“Defendants’ failure to accommodate \nthe severely handicapped in existing community programs while serving less severely handicapped \npeers is unreasonable and discriminatory”). \n  A  recent  reasonable  accommodation  case  from  the  Seventh  Circuit  is  quite  instructive.  In \nRadaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. 2004), plaintiff sought 24 hour private duty nursing care \nunder the HCBS waiver program, a service he alleged he would require in a hospital or nursing facility \nif forced to move there. The State argued that it did not provide that level of service under its waiver, \nand that plaintiff could only receive $4,593 per month - the equivalent of five hours a day of private-\nduty nursing care. However, the court found that the state already provided for some private duty \nnursing care, and further that  \nthe integration mandate may well require the State to make reasonable modifications to \nthe form of existing services in order to adapt them to community-integrated settings.... If \nvariations in the way services were delivered in different settings [home vs. institution, or \nassisted living facility vs. an apartment] were enough to defeat a demand for more \ncommunity  integrated  care,  then  the  integration  mandate  of  the  ADA  and  the \nRehabilitation Act would mean very little. \n \nId. at 611. \n  On remand, the district court found that the state’s failure to fully fund at home, private duty \nnursing for the young man under the Medicaid-funded HCBS constituted disability discrimination, and \nthat the state was obligated to provide treatment in the most integrated setting - his home. It rejected the \nstate’s claim that such an outcome would result in a fundamental alteration of the state’s program. \nRadaszewski v. Maram, 2008 WL 2097382, *15 (N.D. Ill., March 26, 2008); see also Grooms v. Maram \n2008 WL 2271492, *16 (N.D. Ill., May 30, 2008),  Long v. Benson, 2008 WL 4571904 (N.D. Flo, Oct. \n14, 2008), on appeal;  Disability Advocates Inc. v. Paterson. 598 F.Supp.2d 289 (E.D.N.Y.2009). \n \n \n17 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 18 of 26 PageID 559\n \n  E.   Plaintiff Haddad’s Requests for Modifications Are Reasonable. \n  It is well-established that the ADA and Section 504 both require Defendants to make reasonable \nmodifications and accommodations to their policies, practices, and procedures when necessary to avoid \ndiscrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) (ADA). In a reasonable accommodation \nand modification claim, it is the plaintiff’s obligation to articulate a modification that “seems reasonable \non its face.” US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 401 (2002); see also Skerski v. Time Warner \nCable  Co.,  257 F .3d  273, 284 ( 3d  Cir.  2001)  (“plaintiff  bears  only  the  burden  of  identifying  an \naccommodation,  the  costs  of  which  do not   clearly  exceed  its  benefits,”  i.e.,  that  is  not  “clearly \nineffectively or outlandishly costly”). If the plaintiff articulates a reasonable modification, then the \nburden shifts to the defendant to prove that the proposed modification would impose an undue burden on \nits resources or a fundamental alteration of its program. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603; Frederick L., 364 \nF.3d at 492 n.4. \n  Defendants have ignored this obligation to Plaintiff Haddad by not providing her with personal \nattendant care services either through their Medicaid TBI/SCI waiver or through their Medicaid personal \ncare services program. Defendants obtained permission from the federal Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid (CMS) to have a Medicaid TBI/SCI waiver which permitted Florida with the option under \nMedicaid  of  providing  home  and  community  based  services,  including  in-home  care  provided  by \npersonal attendants, to a person who would otherwise require nursing home level care. 42 U.S.C. § \n1396n( c)(1) (“but for the provision of such [waiver] services the individuals would require the level of \ncare provided in ... a nursing facility... the cost of which would be reimbursed under the State plan”). \nWhen Defendants obtained this Medicaid waiver, they took on the mandatory obligation to provide such \nin-home care to qualifying individuals such as Plaintiff Haddad. Despite the significant increase in the \n \n18 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 19 of 26 PageID 560\n \nnumber of people on the wait list for the TBI/SCI waiver, Defendants have failed to increase the number \nof Medicaid TBI/SCI waiver slots so that Plaintiff Haddad could reside in the community instead of in a \nnursing facility.5    \n  Courts have held that increasing expenditures and increasing the numbers of people who receive \nwaiver services in the community is not an unreasonable accommodation.  See e.g., Radaxzewski, 383 \nF.3d  at 613-15;  Frederick L. v. Dept’t of Public Welfare, 364 F.3d 487, 500 (3rd Cir. 2004); Fisher , \n335 F. 3d at 1182-83, and Makin v. Hawaii, 114, F. Supp. 2d 1017, 1034 (D. Haw. 1999).  \n  Plaintiff Haddad has done all she can to live integrated into the community. She has received \nattendant care services from her parents and from her husband (now ex-husband) for as long as they \ncould provide the care and services. She does not have money to pay for personal care services and \nwithout services provided through Defendants’ programs, she will be forced to enter an unnecessarily \nsegregated setting to receive needed services. \n  The reasonableness of a particular accommodation “depends on the individual circumstances of \neach  case”  and  “requires  a  fact-specific,  individualized  analysis  of  the  disabled  individual’s \ncircumstances and accommodations that might allow her to meet the program’s standards.” Wong v. \nRegents of the Univ. of Cal.,192 F.3d 807, 818 (9th Cir. 1999). \n  Plaintiff Haddad has identified the specific program modifications and accommodations she \nseeks. She has asked Defendants, as a reasonable accommodation of her disability, to provide Medicaid \npayments, under either their Medicaid TBI/SCI waiver or Medicaid personal care services programs, for \ncare and services with her daily living activities.   Were she to enter a nursing home, Defendants’ per \n                                                 \n5         Similarly, Defendants have restricted their Medicaid personal care services benefits, 42 USC § \n1396d(a)(24), to persons residing in assisted living facilities.  Defendants could easily expand this \nprogram to persons who reside in their own homes and apartments. \n \n \n19 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 20 of 26 PageID 561\n \ndiem reimbursement to Medicaid nursing facilities is $178.45 a day or $5,353.50 a month. Under the \nfederal requirements for a waiver, a state must assure the federal agency that the waiver is “cost \neffective,” that is, on the average, the amount spent on community-based services “will not exceed the \namount of such medical assistance provided for such individual [in the nursing facility] if the waiver did \nnot apply.” 42 USC § 1396n(c)(4)(A). If Defendants were to provide her with services under the \nTBI/SCI waiver, they would save more than $20,000 a year. The reasonable accommodations that \nPlaintiff Haddad requests fall squarely within the existing duties already assigned to Florida under the \nHCBS Waiver. \n  Similarly, under Florida’s Medicaid program that provides personal care services, see 42 U.S.C. \n§1396d(a)(24), Defendants limit these services to persons who reside in an assisted living complex. The \nreasonable accommodation Plaintiff Haddad requests is that the same service be provided to her in her \nown home instead of in an assisted living facility. That would allow her to hire and pay with Medicaid \nfunds personal attendants who would provide the level of care that she needs. As this is a practice that \nDefendants have approved for persons who reside in assisted living facilities, it could not be an undue \nburden to extend the practice so that Plaintiff Haddad can continue to reside in her home. \nIII.   Irreparable Injury \n  Courts have recognized irreparable injury as a result of institutionalization in a nursing facility.  \nMs. Haddad will irreparably suffer if she is must go into an institution.  Forcing her to go into a nursing \nhome, even for 60 days, will have a very negative emotional impact. Courts have recognized that \ninstitutionalization “will inflict an enormous psychological blow. Also, because of the very substantial \ndifference in [plaintiff’s] perceived quality of life in the apartment as compared to the nursing home, \neach day [s]he is required to live in the nursing home will be an irreparable harm.”  Long v. Benson, No. \n \n20 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 21 of 26 PageID 562\n \n08cv26, 2008 WL 4571903 *2 (N.D. Fla. Oct. 14, 2008).  Institutionalization has been recognized will \nalso negatively impact on her care - “forcing … Plaintiff[] into nursing homes … would be detrimental \nto [her] care, causing, inter alia, mental depression, and …, a shorter life expectancy or death.”  \nCrabtree v. Goetz, No. 08-0939, 2008 WL 5330506 *25 (M.D. Tenn. Dec. 19, 2008)(Haynes, J.) \n  It is also well established that the loss of Medicaid benefits constitutes irreparable harm. Indeed, \n“[t]he nature of the claim - a claim against the state for medical services - makes it impossible to say that \nany remedy at law could compensate” plaintiffs. McMillan v. McCrimon, 807 F. Supp. 475, 479 (C.D. \nIII. 1992). See also Maine Ass’n of Interdependent Neighborhoods v. Petit, 647 F. Supp. 1312, 1315 \n(D.Me. 1986) (court found that absent the requested injunction plaintiff would be forced to leave her \nfamily and enter a nursing home, irreparably injuring her physical and mental health). Accord Edmonds \nv. Levine, 417 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1342 (S.D. Fla. 2006) (denial of medical benefits, and resulting loss of \nmedical services, constitutes irreparable harm); Mitson v. Coler, 670 F. Supp. 1568, 1577 ( S.D. Fla. \n1987)(potential denial of nursing home service constituted irreparable injury since many in class would \nbe deprived of essential medical care); Kai v. Ross, 336 F.3d 650, 656 (8th Cir. 2003) (denial of \nMedicaid benefits constitutes \"a danger to plaintiffs' health, even their lives\"); Massachusetts Ass'n of \nOlder Amer. v. Sharp, 700 F.2d 749, 753 (1st Cir. 1983) (termination of benefits that causes individuals \nto forgo medical care is clearly irreparable harm); Beltran v. Meyers, 677 F.2d 1317, 1322  (9th Cir. \n1982) (irreparable injury is shown when enforcement of a Medicaid rule “may deny [plaintiffs] needed \nmedical care”); Caldwell v. Blum, 621 F.2d 491, 498 (2d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 909 (1981) \n(Medicaid applicants established harm where they would \"absent relief, be exposed to the hardship of \nbeing denied essential medical benefits\"). \n  If a preliminary injunction is not issued, Plaintiff Haddad will not be able to continue to live at \n \n21 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 22 of 26 PageID 563\n \nhome. She will have no option other than to enter to a nursing home and suffer all the injuries listed in \nOlmstead.  Such  discrimination  and  irreparable  injury  are  unnecessary,  if  defendants  would  only \nauthorize Ms. Haddad personal attendant services either under its Medicaid waiver or Medicaid personal \ncare services programs. The irreparable injury includes more than a violation of her civil rights under the \nADA and Section 504. The irreparable injury is that she will be institutionalized in a setting that \ndemeans her by taking away her independence and dignity. \nIV.   Balance of Hardships \n  The Court must weigh the harm to Plaintiff Haddad against possible damage to Defendants. \nMicshel-Trapaga v. City of Gainesville, 907 F. Supp. 1508, 1513 ( N.D. Fla. 1995). While Plaintiff \nHaddad is threatened with institutionalization, Defendants’ only possible damages are monetary.  The \nharm to Plaintiff Haddad here clearly outweighs any harm to Defendants. See, e.g., Edmonds, 417 F. \nSupp. 2d at 1342 (harm to plaintiffs of being deprived of essential medical services outweighs any harm \nto state); Illinois Hosp. Ass'n v. Illinois Dep’t of Public Aid, 576 F. Supp. 360, 371 (N.D. III. 1983) (“ \nonce a state has voluntarily elected to participate in the Medicaid program ... [it cannot] characterize its \nduty to comply with the requirements of [the program] as constituting a hardship to its citizens”); \nKansas Hosp. Ass’n v. Whiteman, 835 F. Supp. 1548, 1552-53 (D. Kan. 1993) (threatened injuries to \nplaintiffs outweighed any harm to defendant that would result from issuing the temporary restraining \norder because changing Medicaid coverage “significantly alters the status quo to the detriment of the \nindividual plaintiffs, while its positive budgetary impact on state coffers is negligible in a relative \nsense”). \n  The balance of hardships clearly favors Plaintiff Haddad in this case. All that she is asking is that \nDefendants spend less of their Medicaid funds and permit her to continue to reside in her home with the \n \n22 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 23 of 26 PageID 564\n \npersonal attendants she needs to accomplish her activities of daily living. Providing the requested \naccommodation falls squarely within the duties imposed upon Defendants by either the Medicaid waiver \nor the Medicaid personal care option. \n  By contrast, if Plaintiff Haddad must leave her home and go to a nursing facility, Defendants will \nexpend more Medicaid funds than they would were she in the community.  Further, Plaintiff Haddad \nwould be institutionalized despite the fact that she has successfully resided in the community since she \nbecame disabled nearly 18 years ago.  Plainly, the balance of hardships tips in favor of Plaintiff Haddad. \nV.   The Public Interest \n  A preliminary injunction to provide services to Plaintiff Haddad to avoid institutionalization is \nnot adverse to the public interest. In determining whether the public interest will be disserved by the \ngranting of a request for preliminary injunction, courts may look to the legislative intent in enacting the \nstatute sought to be enforced. As the Eleventh Circuit found in Johnson v. U.S.D.A., 734 F.2d 774, 788 \n(11th Cir.1984), cost to the government “alone” is not a reason to deny a preliminary injunction as being \nagainst  the  public  interest.  In  a  case  challenging  foreclosure  procedures,  the  court  looked  at  the \nlegislative purposes of the Housing Act of 1949 and found that the public interest of providing decent \nhousing would be served by preventing premature foreclosures. Id. \n  The public interest also will be served by an order granting a preliminary injunction for Plaintiff \nHaddad. There is a strong public policy expressed in the ADA and Section 504. Congress found that \ndiscrimination against people with disabilities is a serious and pervasive social problem, and that people \nwith disabilities have been subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment and relegated to a \nposition  of  political  powerlessness  based  on  characteristics  that  are  beyond  the  control  of  such \nindividuals and resulting from stereotypical assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability of \n \n23 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 24 of 26 PageID 565\n \nsuch persons to participate in and contribute to society. 42 U.S.C. §12101. The purpose of the ADA’s \npassage was to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for elimination of discrimination \nagainst individuals with disabilities.  Accordingly, it serves the public interest to issue the requested \npreliminary injunctive relief. \nVI.   Waiving the Bond Requirement \n  Plaintiffs should be exempted from the bond requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P.65(c). The amount of \nrequired security is within the discretion of the trial court. Bell South, 425 F.3d at 971; Caterpillar, Inc. \nv. Nationwide Equipment, 877 F.Supp. 611, 61 7 (M.D. Fla. 1994); Baldree v. Cargill, Inc., 758 F.Supp. \n704 (M.D. Fla. 1990), aff'd, 925 F.2d 1474 (11th Cir. 1991). The court may also waive all payment. \n  Courts have used their discretion to waive the bond requirement for indigent plaintiffs. E.g., Bass \nv. Richardson, 338 F. Supp. 478, 490 (E.D.N.Y. 1971) (\"It is clear that indigents, suing individually or \nas class plaintiffs, ordinarily should not be required to post a bond under Rule 65(c)\"); Denny v. Shealth \n& Social Serv. Bd. of State of Wis., 285 F. Supp. 526, 527 (E.D. Wis. 1968) (\"Poor persons ... are by \nhypothesis unable to furnish security as contemplated in Rule 65(c), and the court should order no \nsecurity  in  connection  with  the  preliminary  injunction.\").  See  also  Maine  Ass'n  of  Interdependent \nNeighborhoods, 647 F. Supp. at 1319 (court granted waiver of bond, noting impecunious status of \nplaintiffs, and based on plaintiff's strong case on the merits).  \n  Plaintiff Haddad is indigent and seeks injunctive relief to receive services in the community that \nDefendants already provide in nursing homes. The case implicates the public interest and the balance of \nhardships tips sharply in favor of the Plaintiff. This Court should not require Plaintiff Haddad to give \nsecurity. \n \n \n24 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52    Filed 04/15/10   Page 25 of 26 PageID 566\n \nVII.   Conclusion \n  For the reasons and on the authority cited above, Plaintiff Haddad respectfully requests that this \nHonorable Court grant her preliminary injunctive relief. She has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits; that she will suffer irreparable injury in the event emergency relief is denied; and \nthat the balance of hardships tip in her favor. \n \n          Respectfully submitted,  \n            \n   \n          s/ Stephen F.

Jacqueline Jones is a 35 year old woman who, as a result of a car accident \nin 1991, broke her spine and now has quadriplegia. Ms. Jones resides with her 74 year \nold father and 67 year old mother, who for a number of years after her accident were her \nprimary caregivers.  As her parents have aged, their health has deteriorated, and they can \nno longer provide the attendant services Ms. Jones requires to survive. \n2.  Ms. Jones is eligible for and receives Medicaid.  For more than four years, \nMs. Jones has applied for Medicaid's home health services, but Defendants have not \nprovided her with any home and community-based services.  Instead they have placed her \n1 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 1    Filed 12/02/09   Page 2 of 13 PageID 2\non a \"wait list.\"  Recently, Defendants have acknowledged that Ms. Jones is at imminent \nrisk of being institutionalized in a nursing home in order to receive the same services she \nhas requested and needs to continue living in the community.  Defendants have Medicaid \nfunded services which would permit Ms. Jones to continue to live successfully at home \nand to participate in church, family and community life. \n3.  Defendants violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Title II, 42 \nU.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing regulations, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct, 29 U.S.C. §794(a), and its implementing regulations.  Among other things, these \nlaws require the Department to administer its services and programs, including Medicaid, \n\"in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate\"  to  the  needs  of the  individual  with \ndisabilities. \n4.  Plaintiff Jones seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to receive Medicaid \nservices which will allow her to continue to reside in the community and not require her \ninstitutionalization. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  The Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1343(a)(3) and (4).  Declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201  and  2202  and  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  65.  Plaintiffs'  causes  of action  for  disability \ndiscrimination are authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 12133 and 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n6.  Venue is proper because a substantial part of the actions and omissions of \nwhich Plaintiff alleges occurred in this District.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \n2 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 1    Filed 12/02/09   Page 3 of 13 PageID 3\nDEFENDANTS \n7.  Thomas Arnold, is the Secretary of the Florida Agency for Health Care \nAdministration (AHCA), and is sued in his official capacity.  AHCA is the chief health \npolicy and planning entity for the  state and  is responsible for administering Florida's \nMedicaid Program. Fla. Stat. § 20.42(3) (2006).  AHCA is the  \"single state agency\" that \noperates Florida' Medicaid program, see 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5), and is the state agency \nresponsible for administering Florida's nursing home and community-based long-term \ncare  system  for  people  with  disabilities.  Secretary  Arnold  is  responsible  for  the \noversight,  supervision  and  control  of AHCA  and  its  divisions,  and  is  ultimately \nresponsible for ensuring that AHCA's services for people with disabilities are provided in \nconformance with federal law. \n8.  Defendant  Dr.  Anna  Viamonte  Ross  is  the  Secretary  of  Florida's \nDepartment of Health (DOH) and is sued in her official capacity.  DOH is the primary \nstate agency responsible for administering the Medicaid Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal \nCord Injury Waiver program for persons who require long-term care in the community. It \nrecommends  legislative  budget  requests  for  programs  and  services  for  the  state's \npopulation who have spinal cord injuries.  The Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord Injury \nWaiver  is  supposed  to  prevent  unnecessary  institutionalization  of persons  like  the \nPlaintiff who have quadriplegia. \nPLAINTIFF JACQUELINE JONES \n3 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 1    Filed 12/02/09   Page 4 of 13 PageID 4\n9.  Plaintiff Jacqueline Jones is 35 years old.  In November, 1991, when she \nwas 17 years old, she was a driver in a car accident which resulted in her breaking her \nspine and being paralyzed in her hands and from her breast area down through her feet. \n10.  Miss Jones was born in Florida and in 1979 she and her parents moved to \nJacksonville, where they continue to reside. \n11.  Miss Jones' car accident occurred in her senior year in high school.  She \ngraduated from high school in 1993 and attended community college for two years. \n12.  She uses a motorized wheelchair which enables her to ambulate. \n13.  As part of the car accident settlement, the damages pennitted her and her \nfamily to make their house fully accessible for a person who uses a wheelchair. \n14.  Miss Jones  is  an  active  member of the  community.  She  is  a Jehovah \nWitness  and  in  her  wheelchair  is  able  to  do  her  community  ministry.  She  attends \nKingdom Hall of Jehovah Witnesses twice a week and also conducts bible study once a \nweek at another person's home. \n15.  She goes out to dinner with friends, goes to the movies, and frequently \ngoes to mall with friends. \n16.  Miss Jones regularly visits friends for supper at their homes. \n17.  She receives Social Security Disability in the amount of $505 a month and \nmanages her own money.  Miss Jones is eligible for  and receives both Medicaid and \nMedicare. \n18.  As a result of her paralysis, she requires physical therapy several times a \nweek which Medicare covers. \n4 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 1    Filed 12/02/09   Page 5 of 13 PageID 5\n19.  Every day, Miss Jones requires assistance transferring from her bed to her \nwheelchair and  from  the  wheelchair back  to  her  bed.  She  also  requires  assistance \ndressing, grooming, toileting, personal hygiene, food preparation, and cleaning her room. \nThese activities of daily living require several hours a day of assistance. \n20.  Miss Jones also requires assistance several  times a day with her supra \npubic urinary catheter and several times a week for a bowel program. \n21.  These activities require a number of hours per week of assistance. \n22.  In order to prevent decubitus ulcers, Miss Jones should be turned twice a \nnight. \n23.  From 1991, when she became paralyzed, until about 2007, Plaintiff Jones' \nparents, Mr. Jack Jones and Mrs. Charmaine Jones, were able to provide the assistance \nand care she required. \n24.  Mr.  Jack Jones  was  a printer and  also  worked  in  maintenance.  Mrs. \nCharmaine Jones was a housewife. \n25.  Several  years  ago,  Mrs.  Charmaine  Jones  was  diagnosed  with \ndegenerative  arthritis,  which  has  gotten  worse  in  the  past  year,  and  she  was  also \ndiagnosed  with  an  inoperable tumor near her  kidneys.  She  can no  longer assist  in \ntransferring, bathing, dressing or bowel care for her daughter. \n26.  In the past year, Mr. Jones has developed back, shoulder and knee pains, \nall  of which  make  it much more difficult for  him to  assist his  daughter in dressing, \nturning at night and transferring. \n27.  For the past eight months, Medicare has paid for a home health aide three \ntimes a week for one hour each session. \n5 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 1    Filed 12/02/09   Page 6 of 13 PageID 6\n28.  Plaintiff Jones initially applied to Defendants for Home and Community-\nBased Medicaid Waiver services on July 15,2005. \nA.  On June 6, 2006, Defendants conducted a telephone interview of \nMiss Jones during which they completed a \"Priorization Screening Instrument.\" \nDefendants issued a ''Notice of Decision\" which stated: \"No openings at this time. \nWe will be calling you from time to time.

Despite  Defendants  knowing  that  Ms.  Jones  was  at  imminent risk  of \ninstitutionalization,  they  have  never offered her any  Medicaid  services  so  she could \nremain in the community. \nTHE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \n31.  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides that \"no \nqualified  individual  with a disability shall,  by  reason  of disability,  be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the  benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity or be subjected to discrimination by such entity.\"  42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n32.  Regulations implementing Title II of the ADA require that a public entity \nadminister  its  services,  programs  and  activities  in  \"the  most  integrated  setting \nappropriate\"  to  the  needs  of qualified  individuals  with  disabilities.  28  C.F .R.  § \n35.130(d). \n33.  Regulations implementing Title II provide that \"a public entity may not, \ndirectly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or other methods of \nadministration:  (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities \nto discrimination on the basis of disability; [o r]  (ii) that have the purpose or effect of \ndefeating  or substantially  impairing  accomplishment of the  objectives  of the entity's \nprogram with respect to individuals with disabilities .... \"  28 C.F.R. § 35.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... , \nshall,  solely  by  reason  of  her  or  his  disability,  be  excluded  from \nparticipation  in,  be  denied  the  benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance .... \" \n29 U.

Defendants' Medicaid program receives Federal financial assistance under \nSection  504  and  its  implementing  regulations.  Federal  Medicaid  funds  pay  for \napproximately 55% of the cost of the Florida's Medicaid program. \nMEDICAID \n8 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 1    Filed 12/02/09   Page 9 of 13 PageID 9\n39.  In 1965, Congress enacted Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396-1 396v, establishing Medicaid, a medical assistance program cooperatively funded \nby the federal and state governments.  The purpose of Medicaid is to furnish, as far as \npracticable, \"medical assistance on behalf of. .. aged, blind or disabled individuals, whose \nincome and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services\" \nand \"to help such families and individuals to attain or retain capability for independence \nor self-care. ...\"   42 U.S.C. § 1396 (emphasis added). \n40.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services administers the Medicaid \nprogram  at the  federal  level  through the  Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid  Services \n(CMS),  which  has  urged  states  pursuant  to  the  ADA  to  avoid  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization of person with disabilities in nursing facilities. \n41.  State  participation  in  Medicaid  is  voluntary.  Once  a  state  elects  to \nparticipate, it must adhere to the federal legal requirements, as provided by the Medicaid \nAct, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973 (Section 504). \n42.  The  Medicaid  Act  allows  states  to  provide  coverage  of home  health \nnursing and personal attendant services, for persons who are otherwise entitled to receive \nnursing  home  services,  if  they  meet  the  state's  nursing  home  \"level  of  care\" \nrequirements, e.g., need assistance with a certain number of activities of daily living.  See \n42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A), 1396d(a)(7), (8), (22).  Based on information and belief, \nthe Plaintiff meets Defendants' \"level of care\" for a nursing facility. \n43.  The Medicaid Act also authorizes states to obtain Home and Community-\nBased Service (HCBS) waivers from CMS to provide for alternatives to nursing home \n9 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 1    Filed 12/02/09   Page 10 of 13 PageID 10\ncare and services. Waiver programs cover a range of home-based services for Medicaid \nrecipients.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c). \n44.  Defendants have received a CMS Waiver entitled the \"Traumatic Brain \nInjury/Spinal Cord Waiver\" for which Miss Jones has been on a waiting list since she \noriginally applied in 2005. \n45.  Defendant ACHA is designated as the \"single state agency\" responsible \nfor the administration and supervision of Florida's Medicaid Program under Title XIX of \nthe Social Security Act. \n46.  Under  the  Medical  Assistance  Act,  the  Defendants  are  required  to \nadminister the Florida's Medicaid program in conformity with federal law, including the \nADA and Section 504. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n47.  Plaintiff Jacqueline Jones is an individual with disabilities in that she has \nphysical and other impairments that substantially limit one or more of her major life \nactivities,  including  but  not  limited  to  breathing,  walking,  bathing,  speaking,  and \nstanding. \n48.  Plaintiff Jones is a qualified person with disabilities in that she is capable \nof safely living at home with necessary services and she meets the essential eligibility \nrequirements  for the receipt of services from  and participation in the  State Medicaid \nprogram  with  reasonable  modification  to  the  rules,  policies,  and  practices  of that \nprogram, 42 U.S.C. §12131(2). \n10 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 1    Filed 12/02/09   Page 11 of 13 PageID 11\n49.  Without reasonable modification of the rules,  policies, and procedures \ngoverning  the  Florida's  Medicaid  program,  Plaintiff will  be  forcibly  isolated  and \nsegregated into an institutional setting.  This is against her will, and she does not want to \nbe placed into a nursing home. \n50.  Defendants' denial of Medicaid funding for the in-home health services \nthat Plaintiff requires to avoid segregation in an institution and remain in the integrated \nhome  settings that  is appropriate to  her needs, constitutes unlawful  discrimination in \nviolation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its \nimplementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. § 130.51(d). \n51.  Defendants  have  utilized  criteria  and  methods  of administration  that \nsubject  Plaintiff to  discrimination  on  the  basis  of disability,  including  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization, by (1) failing to assess properly the services and supports that would \nenable Plaintiff to remain in the community and (2) failing to ensure that Plaintiff has \naccess  to  Medicaid-covered  services that will  meet  her  needs  in the  community,  in \nviolation of Title II of the ADA and implementing regulations. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n52.  Plaintiff is a \"qualified person with disabilities\" within the meaning of \nSection 504, because she has physical and/or mental impairments that substantially limit \none or more major life activities, and she meets the essential eligibility requirements for \nlong term care under Florida's Medicaid program. \n53.  Defendants' denial of Medicaid funding for the in-home health services \nthat Plaintiff requires to avoid segregation in an institution and remain in the integrated \n11 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 1    Filed 12/02/09   Page 12 of 13 PageID 12\nhome  settings  that  is  appropriate  to  her needs  constitutes  unlawful  discrimination  in \nviolation  of  Section  504  of the  Rehabilitation  Act,  29  U.S.C.  §794(a),  and  its \nimplementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. §41.51(d). \n54.  Defendants have also utilized criteria and methods of administration that \nsubject Plaintiff to discrimination on the basis of disability, including risk of unnecessary \ninstitutionalization, by (I) failing to assess properly the services and supports that would \nenable Plaintiff to remain in the community and (2) failing to ensure that Plaintiff has \naccess to Medicaid-covered services that will meet her needs in the community, thereby \nviolating Section 504 and its implementing regulations. \nRELIEF REOUESTED \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiff Jones  respectfully  requests  that  the  Court  grant  the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  Declare that the Defendants'  denial of funding  for Plaintiffs necessary \nand appropriate Medicaid in-home nursing services constitutes unlawful discrimination in \nviolation  of Title  II of the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act and  Section  504 of the \nRehabilitation Act. \nB.  Grant preliminary and permanent injunctions enjoining the  Defendants, \ntheir officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and all persons who are in active concert or \nparticipation with them from denying Plaintiff Medicaid in-home nursing services \"in the \nmost integrated setting,\" her home, including to the extent to which Plaintiffs' service \nneeds can and will be met by enrolling her in the existing Home and Community-Based \nServices waiver. \n12 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 1    Filed 12/02/09   Page 13 of 13 PageID 13\nC.

R. Civ. P. 65, individual Plaintiff Jacqueline Jones, through her counsel, \nmoves for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendants from denying her with Medicaid home \nand community-based services (\"HCBS\"), in order to prevent Plaintiff Jones's unnecessary and \nimminent institutionalization into a nursing home. Due to the emergency nature of her situation, \nPlaintiff Jones further moves for an expedited hearing.  As grounds therefore, Plaintiff Jones \nstates: \n1.  This action is brought on behalf of a Florida resident who is on Medicaid and has \na severe disability that has paralyzed her.  Plaintiff Jones desires to continue residing in her \ncommunity instead of a nursing facility.  She could reside in the community with appropriate \n1 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 2    Filed 12/02/09   Page 2 of 8 PageID 15\nservices  provided  with  Medicaid  funds.  She  is  at  imminent  risk  of being  unnecessarily \ninstitutionalized because of Defendants' failure to administer their Medicaid services, programs \nand activities in an appropriate, integrated community setting. \n2.  Jacqueline Jones is a named plaintiff in this action. She was born on January 17, \n1974, and is thirty-five years old. \n3.  Plaintiff Jones lives in her parents' fully accessible home in Jacksonville, Florida. \nShe has resided with her parents since November, 1991.  When she was 17 and a senior in high \nschool, she broke her spine as a result of a car accident.  The injuries left her paralyzed in her \nhands and from her breast area down through her feet. \n4.  Ms. Jones graduated from high school in 1993 and attended community college \nfor two years. \n5.  Ms. Jones has quadriplegia.  She uses a motorized wheelchair which enables her \nto ambulate. \n6.  Ms.  Jones is  a Jehovah Witness and  in  her wheelchair she  is able  to  do  her \ncommunity ministry.  She attends Kingdom Hall of Jehovah Witnesses twice a week and also \nconducts a bible study once a week at another person's home. \n7.  She goes out to dinner with friends, goes to the movies, and frequently goes to \nmall with friends.  Miss Jones regularly visits friends for supper at their homes. \n8.  She receives Social Security Disability in the amount of $505 a month and \nmanages her own money. \n9.  Miss Jones'  father is now 74  and her mother is 67.  Since her accident, her \nparents  have  been  her  primary  caregivers.  As  her  parents  have  aged,  their  health  has \n2 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 2    Filed 12/02/09   Page 3 of 8 PageID 16\ndeteriorated, and they can no longer provide the additional attendant services which Ms. Jones \nrequires in order to continue residing in the community. \n10.  Ms. Jones is eligible for and receives Medicaid.  For more than four years, Ms. \nJones has applied for Florida's Medicaid home health services for persons who have a spinal \ncord  injury,  but  Defendants  have  not  provided  her  with  any  home  and  community-based \nservices.  Instead, defendants have placed her on a \"wait list.\" \n11.  Due to her quadraplegia, Miss Jones requires assistance with activities of daily \nliving, including transferring from her bed to her wheelchair and from the wheelchair back to her \nbed.  She also  requires assistance dressing,  grooming, toileting,  personal hygiene,  and  food \npreparation.  These activities of daily living require numerous hours a day of assistance. \n12.  Miss Jones also  requires assistance several  times a day with her supra pubic \nurinary catheter and assistance several  times  a week for a bowel  program.  These activities \nrequire a number of hours per week of assistance. Plaintiff Jones does not require extensive \nnursing care or any other oversight. Any health care and services she requires has been and can \nbe provided in the community. \n13.  In order to prevent decubtus ulcers, a dangerous breakdown of the skin, Ms. Jones \nshould be turned twice a night. \n14.  From  1991,  when  she  became  paralyzed,  until  about  2007,  Plaintiff Jones' \nparents,  Mr.  Jack Jones and  Mrs.  Charmaine Jones,  were able to  provide the assistance she \nrequired for these activities of daily living. \n15.  Several  years  ago,  Mrs.  Charmaine  Jones  was  diagnosed  with  degenerative \narthritis, which has gotten worse in the past year, and she was also diagnosed with an inoperable \n3 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 2    Filed 12/02/09   Page 4 of 8 PageID 17\ntumor near her kidneys.  She can no longer assist in transferring, bathing, dressing or bowel care \nfor her daughter. \n16.  In the past year, Mr. Jones has developed back, shoulder and knee pains, all of \nwhich make it much more difficult for him to assist his daughter in dressing, turning at night and \ntransferring. \n17.  For the past eight months, Medicare has paid for a home health aide three times a \nweek for one hour each session.  This is insufficient. Ms. Jones requires much more assistance \nwith activities of daily living. \n18.  Plaintiff Jones initially applied to Defendants for Home and Community-Based \nMedicaid Waiver services on July 15,2005. \n19.  On June 6,  2006, Defendants conducted a telephone interview of Miss Jones \nduring which they completed a \"Priorization Screening Instrument.\"  Defendants issued a Notice \nof Decision which stated: \"No openings at this time.  We will be calling you from time to time. \nMeanwhile, please keep us advised of changes to your condition or situation.\" \n20.  In the June 6, 2006 Notice, Defendants noted that Ms Jones was not \"at risk of \nnursing home placement within the next 30 to 60 days.\" \n21.  On March 7,  2007, Defendants conducted another telephone interview of Miss \nJones during which they completed a second \"Priorization Screening Instrument.\"  Defendants' \nMarch 7, 2007 Notice of Decision stated: \"No openings at this time.  We will be calling you \nfrom  time  to  time.  Meanwhile,  please  keep  us  advised  of changes  to  your  condition  or \nsituation. \" \n4 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 2    Filed 12/02/09   Page 5 of 8 PageID 18\n22.  In the March 7 t 2007 Noticet Defendants wrote that Miss Jones had been \"placed \non the TBI/SCI  [Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord Medicaid]  Waiver waiting list: Date of \nReferral:  7-15 _05.'t \n23.  In this Noticet Defendants noted that Ms Jones was not \"at risk of nursing home \nplacement within the next 30 to 60 days.tt \n24.  On July 28, 2009, Defendants sent Ms. Jones another \"Notice of Decision\" which \nstated \"You have been placed on the TBUSCI Waiver waiting list\" and \"No openings at this \ntime.  We will be calling you from time to time.  Meanwhile, please keep us advised of changes \nto your condition or situation.\" \n25.  On October 8, 2009, Defendants conducted a third telephone interview of Miss \nJones during which they completed the third \"Priorization Screening Instrument.\" Defendants' \nOctober 8, 2009 Notice of Decision stated: \"No openings at this time.  We will be calling you \nfrom  time  to  time.  Meanwhile,  please  keep  us  advised  of changes  to  your  condition  or \nsituation.\" \n26.  However,  on  the  October  8,  2009  \"Priorization  Screening  Instrument.\" \nDefendants noted that Ms. Jones was \"at risk of nursing home placement within the next 30 to 60 \ndays.\" \n27.  Despite  Defendants  knowing  that  Ms.  Jones  was  at  imminent  risk  of \ninstitutionalization, they have not offered her any Medicaid services so she could remain in the \ncommunity. \n28.  Ms. Jones has been eligible for Florida's Medicaid nursing home services since \nshe broke her spine in 1991.  She still meets Florida's level of care for nursing home eligibility. \n5 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 2    Filed 12/02/09   Page 6 of 8 PageID 19\n29.  If Ms.  Jones were  to  enter a nursing home,  Florida's Medicaid nursing home \nreimbursement is approximately $178 per diem. \n30.  Defendants  have  a  community-based  Medicaid  Traumatic  Brain  Injury/Spinal \nCord Medicaid Waiver but has limited the number of slots to 375. \n31.  Defendants  have  certified  to  the  federal  Medicaid  agency,  the  Centers  for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, that for each person Florida diverts from the nursing home and \nprovides  Waiver  services  in  the  community,  the  State  and  the  federal  government  save \napproximately $20,000 a year. \n32.  Despite these savings and knowing that Plaintiff Jones is in  imminent risk of \nnursing home placement, Defendants have refused to provide Miss Jones with services in her \nhome. \n33.  Plaintiff Jones needs Defendants' Medicaid HCBS benefits and assistance with \nactivities of daily living. These services could be provided to Plaintiff Jones either pursuant to \n\"waiver\" services or \"personal care services,\" see 42 U.S.C. §§1396n(c) and 1396d(a)(24), both \nof which are part of the Florida's Medicaid program. Unfortunately, waiver services have not \nbeen made available to Plaintiff Jones, even though she applied for home and community-based \nservices and is on a waiting list.  The personal care option service is limited in Florida to persons \nwith disabilities  who  reside only  in assistive living facilities - not their own apartments or \nhouses. \n34.  To obtain the necessary services, Defendants require that Plaintiff Jones leave the \ncommunity and enter a Medicaid-funded nursing facility setting. Defendants' Medicaid program \nwill only provide the services she requires by paying for her institutionalization in a nursing \n6 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 2    Filed 12/02/09   Page 7 of 8 PageID 20\nfacility. \n35.  Plaintiff Jones will imminently have no option other than to enter into a nursing \nhome  where Defendants'  Medicaid program will pay for the same services she can and has \nreceived in the community. \n36.  Defendants' refusal to offer her the services in the community and instead require \nher to enter  a nursing facility to receive the same services violates both the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101  et seq. ('·ADA\"), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 \nU.S.C. § 794a (\"Section 504\"), and their implementing regulations, in particular the \"integration \nmandate,\" which requires that  \"a public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities \nin the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.\" \n28 C.F.R.§ 35. 130(d). \n37.  Counsel  for Plaintiff Jones consulted  with  Defendants'  counsel  and requested \nservices for Plaintiff Jones, but no services have been provided. \n38.  Jacqueline Jones telephoned  Defendants'  Jacksonville  Medicaid  Waiver office \nregarding waiver services, but none have been provided and no one could tell her when services \nwould be provided for her in the community. \nWHEREFORE Plaintiff Jones seeks a preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendants from \ndenying her services in the community to assist her with her daily living activities. \n7 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 2    Filed 12/02/09   Page 8 of 8 PageID 21\nRespectfully submitted, \nStephen F.

Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 and Local Rule 4.06(b), I, \nMichele Haddad, declare as true the following: \n1..  I am a named plaintiff in this action. \n2.  I  was born on August 1, 1960 and an1 forty-nine years old. \n3.  I live in a fully accessible home in Jacksonville, Florida. \n4.  When I was 47, on September 7, 2007, I was in a motor cycle accident caused by \nan intoxicated car driver. \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52-1    Filed 04/15/10   Page 2 of 5 PageID 569\n5.  I broke my spine as a result of the accident. \n6.  On  or  about  November,  2007,  when  I  was  still  hospitalized  in  Brooks \nRehabilitation, I applied to Defendants' Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Program to receive home \nhealth care through the Spinal Cord Injury Medicaid Waiver. \n7.  I have been on the \"wait list\" for in-home Waiver services nearly three years. \n8.  I was recently contacted by the Defendants' Spinal Cord Injury Waiver and told \nDefendants have no funds to provide me with services.  However, if I would enter a nursing \nhome for 60  days, then Defendants would provide me with 10  hours a day of attendant care \nservices in the community. \n9.  I do not want to live in a nursing home but want services in the conununity. \n10.  I an1 tmable to open my right hand and cannot close my left hand.  As a result I \nhave minimal manual dexterity. \n11.  I use a motorized wheelchair for ambulation. \n12.  Between  January  2008,  when  I  was  discharged  from  Brooks  Rehabilitation \nHospital, and March 2010, my husband was my primary caregiver.  In November, 2009, after 24 \nyears  of marriage,  my  husband  and  I  divorced.  My  husband remained  in our home  and \ncontinued to serve as my primary caregiver until March 2010, when he left the home. \n13.  One  of my  adult  sons,  Anthony,  24,  who  had  been  living  in  Miami  has \ntemporarily move in with me to provide me with the care I require in order to remain in the \ncommunity. \n14.  Anthony now is responsible for the tasks that my husband had provided since the \naccident: transferring me out of bed to a wheelchair, bathing me, helping me with my hygiene \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52-1    Filed 04/15/10   Page 3 of 5 PageID 570\nneeds, dressing me, shopping for food, preparing meals, assisting me with eating, and at the end \nof the day performing the same functions to assist me to get into bed. \n15.  Further,  I  use  a  catheter  and  require  a  bowel  program.  My  husband  was \nresponsible for these toilet needs.  Since March, when my husband left the house, my son, \nAnthony, has had to perform the exact same very personal care for me. \n16.  In early March,  2010,  I  contacted Defendants'  Brain and  Spinal  Cord Injury \nProgram.  I notified the Program that my husband and primary caregiver had moved out and I \ndesperately required Medicaid Waiver services because the only help I was receiving was from \nmy son, Anthony. \n17 .  Earlier tlris week, I received a telephone call from the Spinal Cord Injury Program \nand was told tl1ere were no funds for community-based services, but if I would move into a \nnursing home for 60 days tl1en I could receive 10 hours a day of services in tl1e commwrity. \n18.  Anthony  cannot continue to  provide services to  me  and has  only temporarily \nreturned home from Miami.  Anthony recently graduated from Florida International University \nin December, 2009, majoring in international relations and marketing.  Anthony only retwned \nhome to care for me due to tl1e exigent circumstances -- tl1e divorce, Iris fatl1er leaving the house, \nand I had no  one to care for her.  Anthony intends to move back to Miami, and without the \nservices he has been providing in tl1e home, I will be forced to enter an UJ111ecessarily segregated \nsetting. \n19.  I do not want to go into a nursing home; instead, I want to continue residing in the \nconm1UJ1ity, where I have an active life. \n20.  In the  community,  I  attend  church,  go  to  tl1e  mov1es,  visits  friends  and  go \nshopping.  I use tl1e gy=asiUJU at Brooks Rehabilitation Hospital's out-patient w1it for exercise. \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52-1    Filed 04/15/10   Page 4 of 5 PageID 571\n21.  I do not think it is appropriate for my son to provide the activities of daily living \nwhich she requires (including very private tasks). \n22.  My sole source of income is my monthly Social Security Disability Insurance, \nand I am eligible for and receive both Medicare and Medicaid. \nWithout community-based Spinal Cord Waiver services, I am at risk of being \ninstitutionalized, even though I desperately does not want to reside in a nursing facility. \n24.  Despite Defendants !mowing that I am at imminent risk of institutionalization, \nthey have not offered me any Medicaid services so I can remain in the community. \n25.  Defendants  have  a  community-based Medicaid  Tramnatic  Brain Injury/Spinal \nCord Medicaid Waiver but its capacity is limited, providing 375 slots. \n26.  Defendants  have  certified  to  the  federal  Medicaid  agency,  the  Centers  for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, that for each person Florida diverts from the nursing home and \nprovides  Waiver  services  in  the  community,  the  State  and  the  federal  government  save \napproximately $20,000 a year. \n2 7.  Despite these savings and knowing that I am in imminent risk of nursing home \nplacement, Defendants have refused to provide me with services in my home. \n28.  Unfortunately,  Waiver services  have  not been made  available,  even though I \napplied for home and community-based services and have been on a waiting list.  In early March, \n2010, my advocates have telephoned Defendants' Jacksonville Medicaid Waiver office regarding \nwaiver services, but none have been provided and no one could tell them when services would be \nprovided for me in the community. \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 52-1    Filed 04/15/10   Page 5 of 5 PageID 572\n29.  To obtain tbe necessary services, Defendants require tbat I leave tbe community \nand enter a Medicaid-funded nursing facility setting.  Defendants' Medicaid program will only \nprovide the services I require by paying for my institutionalization in a nursing facility. \nDated tllis  )C:day of April, 2010. \n_L{_ \nSworn to (or affirmed) and subscribed before me tllis  day of April, 2010, \nMICHELE HADDAD, a person of lawful age, who is personally known to me or who \n~~~d  ~~~~an~ \nNo  ·yPublic \nMy Commission Expires: \nNM!CY L.

      "text": "Case 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 29    Filed 01/06/10   Page 1 of 12 PageID 347\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nJACKSONVILLE DIVISION\nJACQUELINE JONES,\nPlaintiff,\nv. Case No. 3:09-CV-1170-J34JRK\nTHOMAS ARNOLD, in his official \ncapacity as Secretary, Florida Agency for \nHealth Care Administration, and \nDr. ANNA VIAMONTE ROSS, \nin her official capacity\nas Secretary, Florida Department of\nHealth, \nDefendants. .\n_________________________________________\nMEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF\nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION\nPlaintiff Jacqueline Jones, through her counsel, submits this Memorandum of Law in support\nof the Motion for Class Certification.  Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court to certify the case to\nproceed on behalf of the following class:\nFlorida disabled residents with a spinal cord injury who are Medicaid\nrecipients; reside in the community; desire to continue to reside in the\ncommunity  instead  of  a  nursing  facility;  could  reside  in  the\ncommunity with appropriate Medicaid-funded services; and are at\nrisk, as determined by the recipient’s treating physician or other\ntreating health professional, of being forced to enter a nursing home\nbecause  Defendants  do  not  provide  adequate  community-based\nservices.\nWhile the Plaintiffs bear the burden of showing that the requirements of Rule 23 have been\nmet, “[f]or the purposes of class certification ... the Court accepts the Plaintiffs’ substantive\nallegations as true.” In Re Carbon Dioxide Antitrust Litig., 149 F.R.D. 229, 232 (M.D. Fla. 1993).\n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 29    Filed 01/06/10   Page 2 of 12 PageID 348\nIn addition, “[t]he Court resolves any doubt in favor of class certification.” Id.  See also  Jackson v.\nMotel 6 Multipurposes, Inc., 175 F.R.D. 337, 340 (M.D. Fla. 1997). Finally, the court is not to\nconduct an inquiry into the merits of the Plaintiffs’ claim as part of the class certification\nproceedings. As stated by the Supreme Court in Eisen v. Carlyle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 178\n(1974): “in determining the propriety of a class action, the question is not whether ... plaintiffs have\nstated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits but rather whether the requirements of Rule 23\nare met.” \nClass  certification  requires  that  the  class  meet  the  four  Rule  23(a)  requirements  of\nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequate representation, and the two Rule 23(b)(2)\nrequirements that the Defendants “acted or refused to act on grounds equally applicable to the class,”\nand that final relief of an injunctive nature or corresponding declaratory nature, settling the legality\nof the behavior with respect to the class as a whole is appropriate. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). As shown\nbelow, the prerequisites are met in this case.\nI.  THE PROPOSED PLAINTIFF CLASS MEETS RULE 23(a) CERTIFICATION\nREQUIREMENTS.\nA. Numerosity\nRule 23 requires that “the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.”\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). Plaintiffs need not know the exact number in the class, but they must\n“proffer some evidence of the number in the purported class or a reasonable estimate.” Leszcynski\nv. Allianz Ins., 176 F.R.D. 659, 669 (S.D. Fla. 1997). The court may then make a “common sense\nassumption in order to find support for numerosity.” Evans v. U.S. Pipe & Foundry, 696 F. 2d 925,\n930 (11th Cir. 1983). In this Circuit, “generally less than twenty-one is inadequate, more than forty\nadequate, with numbers in between varying according to other factors.” Cox v. American Cast Iron\n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 29    Filed 01/06/10   Page 3 of 12 PageID 349\nPipe Co., 784 F.2d 1546, 1553 (11th Cir. 1986).  Other factors that the Court should consider include\nthe geographical dispersion of the class members, judicial economy, and the ease of identifying the\nmembers of the class and their addresses. See  Kreuzfeld A.G. v. Carnehammar, 138 F.R.D. 594,\n598-99 (S. D. Fla. 1991).\nThe proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all the members is impracticable. Cox, 784\nF.2d at 1553; see also Haymons v. Williams, 795 F. Supp. 1511 (M.D. Fla. 1982) (certifying class\nof 178 Medicaid-eligible individuals residing in adult congregate living facilities to challenge failure\nto provide notice and opportunity for hearing concerning termination of home health care services).\nAccording to the recently released Kaiser Commission “Medicaid Home and Community-\nBased Service Programs: Data Update,” at Table 11, there were 434 people with spinal cord injuries\non Florida’s  “wait list” in FY 2008 for Medicaid community-based services.  In December 2008,\nbased on a document prepared by one of the Defendants, the Florida Medicaid waiting list for\npersons with spinal cord injuries had increased to 554 people. [Attachment “A”]. By applying for\ncommunity-based services, these people have indicated that they would rather live in the community.\nJoinder is impracticable because class members lack the knowledge and financial means to maintain\nindividual actions. Thus, while the precise number of people is not known, for purposes of\nnumerosity the number of members of the representative class vastly exceeds 40 and is more\nappropriately estimated at 450 to 550 class members. \nJoinder of the proposed class members is also impracticable because of class members’\nlimited resources, physical disabilities and geographic dispersion. Armstead v. Pingree, 629 F. Supp.\n273, 279 (M.D. Fla. 1986).  Class members are located across the entire state of Florida and have\nlimited ability to prosecute their cases individually due to their limited income and disability status.\nFurther, there is judicial economy in rendering a classwide decision on the requested injunctive and\n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 29    Filed 01/06/10   Page 4 of 12 PageID 350\ndeclaratory relief.\nIn the instant case, the numerosity of the proposed class far exceeds the number of class\nmembers which have been certified as a sufficiently numerous class in other cases. See, e.g., Custom\nv. Trainor, 74 F.R.D. 409 (N.D. Ill. 1977), (permitting a class of welfare recipients numbering in\nexcess of 62 members); National Ass’n of Radiation Survivors v. Walters, 111 F.R.D. 595, 598\n(N.D.Cal. 1986), rev’d on other grounds sub nom., National Ass’n of Radiation Survivors v.\nDerwinski, 994 F.2d 583 (9th Cir. 1992) (conditionally certifying class, stating that if 40 benefit\nclaimants could meet the class description, the class would be sufficiently large); Phillips v. Joint\nLegislative Comm’n, 637 F.2d 1014 (5th Cir. 1981)1 (holding that 33 class members satisfied\nnumerosity); Jack v. American Linen Supply Co., 498 F.2d 122, 124 (5th Cir. 1974) (certifying class\nof 51); Lawson v. Wainwright, 108 F.R.D. 450, 454 (S.D. Fla. 1986) (certifying class of 59).\nIn sum, there are approximately  500  individuals in the purported class and all relevant\nfactors support a finding of numerosity.\nB.  Commonality\nRule 23 also requires that there be “questions of law or fact common to the class.” Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(a)(2).  Allegations of a “policy” or “practice” of treating the entire class unlawfully\ngenerally satisfy the commonality requirement. International Bd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431\nU.S. 324, 336 (1977) (finding commonality where racial discrimination was the company’s standard\noperating procedure – the regular rather than the unusual practice); see also Cooper v. Federal\nReserve, 467 U.S. 867, 878 (1984); Cox v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 784 F.2d 1546, 1557-58\n1 Decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, as the court existed\non September 30, 1981, handed down by that court prior to the close of business on that date, are\nbinding as precedent on the Eleventh Circuit of Appeals, established October 1, 1981. Bonner v. City\nof Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981).\n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 29    Filed 01/06/10   Page 5 of 12 PageID 351\n(11th Cir. 1986). Where a common scheme is alleged, common questions of law or\nfact will exist. See Murray v. Auslander, 244 F.3d 807, 813 (11th Cir. 2001) (class certified to\nchallenge State’s policy of “capping” the per person amount under Florida’s Developmental\nDisabilities Medicaid Waiver Program).\nThe threshold for commonality is not high. Forbush v. J.C. Penny Co., Inc., 994 F.2d 1101,\n1106 (5th Cir. 1990). The Rule does not require complete identity of legal claims among class\nmembers. Johnson v. American Credit Co. of Ga., 581 F.2d 526, 532 (5th Cir. 1978).\nIn this case, the named Plaintiff and purported class are Medicaid recipients who are at risk\nof  unnecessarily institutionalized because of Defendants’ failure to cover services and support in\nappropriate, integrated community settings as required by the ADA. The Amended Complaint lists\nthe challenged practices with specificity. (See Dkt. ¶¶ 57-61).\nCommon questions of fact and law for all class members include  whether Defendants violate\nthe “integration mandate” of the ADA and Section 504 by requiring named Plaintiff and class\nmembers to be institutionalized in nursing facilities in order to receive long-term care services, rather\nthan providing those services in appropriate settings in Plaintiff’s homes and communities.  This\ncommon issue satisfies commonality. \nWhile the circumstances of class members vary in terms of the extent and intensity of the\ncommunity services needed, this does not affect commonality. As stated in Pottinger v. City of\nMiami, 720 F. Supp. 955 (S.D.Fla. 1989): “It is only necessary to find at least one issue common to\nall class members.” (citing Slaughter v. Levine, 598 F. Supp. 1035,1044 (D. Minn.1984)). \nThe fact that there may be minor factual differences in the extent and intensity of the\ncommunity services needed does not defeat the maintenance of a class action if there are common\nquestions of law. Id. at 958; Coley v. Clinton,635 F.2d 1364,1378 (8th Cir. 1980).  In the instant\n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 29    Filed 01/06/10   Page 6 of 12 PageID 352\ncase, the fact that class members may require different and varying levels of services and support to\nlive in the community does not negate commonality.  Further, any difference in the medical\nconditions of the class members is irrelevant as to whether there is commonality as all class members\nseek common relief.\nC.  Typicality\nRule 23 further requires that the claims or defenses of the representative parties be “typical\nof the claims or defenses of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). A representative’s claim is typical\n“[1] if it arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of\nother class members, and [2] if his or her claims are based on the same legal theory.” H. Newberg,\n1 Newberg on Class Actions §3.13, at 3 (4th ed. 2007). This Circuit has stated that typicality exists\nwhen there is: \n[A] nexus between the class representative’s claims or defenses and the common\nquestions of fact or law which unite the class. A sufficient nexus is established if the\nclaims or defenses of the class and the class representative arise from the same event\nor pattern or practice and are based on the same legal theory. Typicality however,\ndoes not require identical claims or defenses. A factual variation will not render a\nclass representative's claim atypical unless the factual position of the representative\nmarkedly differs from that of other members of the class.\nKornberg v. Carnival Cruise Lines, 741 F.2d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir. 1984).\nThe claims of the  named Plaintiff and proposed class members are based on the ADA and\nSection 504, which require that Defendants not unnecessarily confine persons with disabilities in\nsegregated settings such as nursing homes.  The class representative, like the class members, is\nchallenging Defendants’ failure to  provide the class with meaningful choice of community-based\nlong-term care alternatives to nursing facilities.  The legal claims and relief sought by the named\nPlaintiff and the putative class – declaratory and injunctive relief – are identical.  The named Plaintiff\ndoes not seek  individual relief.\n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 29    Filed 01/06/10   Page 7 of 12 PageID 353\nAs with commonality, the incidental variations in Plaintiffs’ factual situations do not defeat\ntypicality, because the basic nature of the injury and the legal theory of recovery is typical for the\nentire class. See Miles v. Metropolitan Dade County, 916 F.2d 1528, 1534 (11th Cir. 1990);\nKornberg v. Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc.,741 F.2d 1332 (11th Cir. 1984), Goodman v. Lukens Steel\nCo., 777 F.2d 113, 123 (3d Cir. 1985) (typicality satisfied despite fact that “in a number of areas the\nclass representatives’ specific allegations are distinct from those of the class as a whole”), aff’d on\nother grounds, 482 U.S. 656 (1987); Edmonds v. Levine, 233 F.R.D. 638, 641 (S.D. Fla. 2006)\n(differences in medical conditions and prescriptions “irrelevant for purposes of the typicality\nrequirement” because the action of Medicaid agency to deny the service and the underlying rationale\nfor the denial were identical for the named plaintiff to those of each proposed class member). \nAs stated in Appleyard v. Wallace, 754 F.2d 955, 958 (11th Cir.1985):\nsubsection a(3) [typicality] primarily directs the district court to focus\non whether named representatives’ claims have the same essential\ncharacteristics as the claims of the class at large...the typicality\nrequirement may be satisfied even if there are factual distinctions\nbetween the claims of the named Plaintiffs and those of other class\nmembers... Thus courts have found that a strong similarity of legal\ntheories will satisfy the typicality requirement despite substantial\nfactual differences.\nIn Appleyard, the court focused on the similarity of relief, stating that all class members were\nsimilarly interested in the requested relief, that the court “declare the policies and customs of the\nDefendants invalid” and “enjoin the defendants from determining any member of the class to be\nineligible without full compliance with applicable federal law.” Id. at 958. Similarly, in the present\ncase, the complaint requests the same declaratory and injunctive relief for all class members.\nD.  Adequacy of Representation\nFurther, Rule 23 requires that the class representatives be persons who “will fairly and\n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 29    Filed 01/06/10   Page 8 of 12 PageID 354\nadequately protect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). In determining whether named\nplaintiffs will adequately represent a potential class pursuant to the requirements of Rule 23(a)(4),\nthe Court should consider (1) “whether plaintiffs’ counsel are qualified, experienced and generally\nable to conduct the proposed litigation and ... (2) whether plaintiffs have interests antagonistic to\nthose of the rest of the class.” Kirkpatrick v. Bradford & Co. , 827 F.2d 718, 726\n(11th Cir. 1987) (quoting Griffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d 1516, 1532 (11th Cir. 1985). \nEach concern is satisfied here.  The proposed class representatives share the interest of the\nputative class in bringing an end to the unlawful practice of Defendants and in obtaining relief for\nthe violations of Plaintiff’s rights. There is no sense in which named Plaintiff’s interests can be said\nto conflict with the interests of other members of the proposed class. The common allegations of\nDefendants’ practices, the nature of the relief sought, and the legal theories advanced demonstrate\nthe required congruity of interests.  The second requirement for adequacy is also satisfied. The\nnamed Plaintiff has obtained experienced counsel who are skilled and knowledgeable about civil\nrights litigation, Americans With Disabilities Act, Medicaid law, practice and procedure in the\nfederal courts and the prosecution and management of class action litigation.\nStephen F. Gold is private practitioner who has been practicing law since 1971 and has\ndedicated most of his career to representing children and adults with disabilities. He has litigated\nover 50 cases under the Americans With Disabilities Act and Section 504, and dozens of other cases\non behalf of persons with disabilities under other statutes. See, e.g., Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care\nAuthority, 335 F.3d 1175 (10th Cir. 2003)(holding the ADA’s “integration mandate” was violated\nby requiring people with disabilities to be segregated in nursing homes to receive appropriate\ncommunity services,  i.e., unlimited prescriptions); Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325 (3d Cir. 1995),\ncert denied, 116 S.Ct. 64 (1995) sub nom. Secretary of DPW of Pa. v. Idell S.

Richman, 367 F.3d 180 (3d Cir. 2004) (challenged Medicaid services’ delivery under\n“reasonable promptness”).\nPlaintiff’s counsel bring substantial relevant experience to the prosecution of this case.  The\ncommon interests of the proposed class will be fairly and adequately represented.\nE.  Defendants Have Acted Or Refused To Act On Grounds Generally Applicable\nTo The Class Making Final Injunctive And Declaratory Relief Appropriate For\nThe Class As A Whole\nCertification under Rule 23(b)(2) further requires a finding that the defendant “acted or\nrefused to act on grounds equally applicable to the class” and “final relief of an injunctive nature or\na corresponding declaratory nature, settling the legality of the behavior with respect to the class as\na whole,” is appropriate. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Rule 23(b)(2) was intended primarily to facilitate\ncivil rights class actions, where, as here, “the class representatives typically seek broad injunctive\nor declaratory relief against Defendants’ discriminatory practices.” Penson, 634 F.2d\n989, 993 (11th Cir. 1981); see also Ass’n for Disabled Am., 211 F.R.D. 457, 465 (S.D. Fla. 2002)\n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 29    Filed 01/06/10   Page 10 of 12 PageID 356\n(certifying class of persons with disabilities alleging failure to meet accessibility requirements under\nADA).\nThe focus of this litigation is on Defendants’ failure to provide the class with appropriate\ncommunity-based long-term care alternatives to nursing facilities.  Injunctive or declaratory relief\nsettling the legality of Defendants’ behavior with respect to the class as a whole is appropriate.\nClass actions pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) are especially appropriate where the Plaintiff class\nseeks declaratory or injunctive relief from unlawful and/or discriminatory policies and practices in\ngovernment benefit programs. See Doe v. Chiles, 136 F.3d 709 (11th Cir. 1998) (concerning certified\nclass of individuals with developmental disabilities waiting for intermediate care facility services);\nHernandez, 209 F.R.D. 665 (certifying class of current and future Medicaid recipients who have or\nwill have prescription drug coverage denied without due process); Tugg v. Towey, 864 F. Supp. 1201\n(S.D. Fla. 1994) (challenging failures in provision of mental health counseling services to deaf\nclients by therapists fluent in sign language); Haymons, 795 F. Supp. at 1522 (certifying class where\nDefendants refused to grant reinstatement, notice and hearing to Medicaid recipients whose home\nhealth care benefits were terminated). See also Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 494 F.2d\n211, 257 (5th Cir. 1974). \nPlaintiff has met the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b)(2). As such, the proposed class\nshould be certified.\nII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court certify the Plaintiff\nclass pursuant to Rule 23(a)&(b)(2).\nRespectfully submitted, \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 29    Filed 01/06/10   Page 11 of 12 PageID 357\ns/ Stephen F.

Plaintiff-Intervenor United States alleges, upon information and belief, that the \nState of Florida fails to provide sufficient community-based services so that Medicaid-\neligible individuals with spinal cord injuries who are at risk of institutionalization may be \nserved in the \"most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.\"  As set forth more fully \nbelow, Florida is in violation oftitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n(ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \n§794, and their implementing regulations (as interpreted in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. \n581 (1999)).  The State continues to fund more costly, institutional care, rather than \nprovide adequate community-based services to persons with disabilities resulting from \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 3 of 18 PageID 777\nspinal cord injuries, in violation of Olmstead and the integration mandate.  The unmet \nneed for community-based services puts individuals with disabilities at risk of being \nforced to \"relinquish participation in community life they could enjoy given reasonable \naccommodations, while persons without [] disabilities can receive the medical services \nthey need without similar sacrifice.\"  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 601.  Indeed, the State \nimproperly conditions receipt of community-based services in its Traumatic Brain \nInjury/Spinal Cord Injury Medicaid Waiver Program (\"TBIISCI Waiver Program\") on \ninstitutionalization in a nursing home. \n2.  The United States brings this action to enforce title II ofthe ADA and Section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act because unjustified isolation is a recognized form of \ndiscrimination that goes to the heart of the ADA and Congress' intent to eliminate the \nsegregation and isolation of individuals with disabilities.  As Congress stated in the \nFindings and Purposes of the ADA: \"historically, society has tended to isolate and \nsegregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive \nsocial problem.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2).  Congress' purpose in enacting the ADA was \nthus \"to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities,\" including discrimination in the form \nof segregation, Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 589 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(l)), and Congress \nintended the Attorney General to enforce the statute.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(3). \n2 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 4 of 18 PageID 778\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3.  This Court has jurisdiction of this action under title II of the ADA, 42 i:J.S.C. \n§§ 12131-12132, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §794(a) and 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331 and 1345.  The Court may grant the relief sought in this action pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n4.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, given that a \nsubstantial part of the acts and omissions giving rise to this action occurred in the Middle \nDistrict ofFlorida.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \nPARTIES \n5.  The proposed plaintiff class consists of \nFlorida disabled residents with a spinal cord injury who are Medicaid recipients; \nreside in the community; desire to continue to reside in the community instead of \na nursing facility; could reside in the community with appropriate Medicaid- · \nfunded services; and are at risk, as determined by the recipient's treating \nphysician or other treating health professional, of being forced to enter a nursing \nhome because Defendants do not provide adequate community-based services. \nSee Motion for Class Certification ~1, Jan. 6, 2010, ECF No. 28. \n6.  Members of the proposed plaintiff class have spinal cord injuries that \nsubstantially limit one or more major life activities, including personal care activities \nsuch as bathing, toileting, and preparing meals.  They are therefore. individuals with \ndisabilities for purposes of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. \n7.  Plaintiff-Intervenor is the United States of America.  The United States brings this \naction to enforce the rights of Medicaid-eligible individuals with disabilities resulting \nfrom spinal cord injuries to receive adequate services in the community so that they will \nnot be unnecessarily segregated in institutions. -\n3 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 5 of 18 PageID 779\n8.  Defendant State of Florida is a \"public entity'' within the meaning ofthe ADA, 42 \nU.S.C. § 12131(1), 28 C.F.R. § 35.104, and is therefore subject to title II ofthe ADA, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12131 et seq., and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. Part 35. \n9.  At all times relevant to this action, Defendant has been, and is, a \"recipient\" of \n\"Federal financial assistance,\" and is therefore subject to Section 504 of the \nI \nI \n~  . \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §794, and the relevant implementing regulations. See \nDefs.' Mot. to Dismiss Amended Complaint at 9-10, Dec. 29,2009, ECF No. 25 \n(acknowledging that defendants receive Federal financial assistance through Medicaid). \n10.  Defendant State ofFlorida administers services to individuals with spinal cord \ninjuries through two state agencies:  the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration \n(AHCA) and the Florida Department of Health (DOH).  See Home and Community-\nBased Services (HCBS) Waivers, \nhttp:// ahca.myflorida.com/medicaidlhcbs waivers/index.shtml (last visited 8/23/201 0); \nFlorida Department ofH  ealth, Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Program, \nhttp://www.doh.state.fl.us/DEMO/BrainSC/index.html (last visited 8/23/201 0). \n11.  AHCA is the chief health policy and planning entity for the State and is \nresponsible for administering Florida's Medicaid services. Fla. Stat. § 20.42(3) (2006). \nAHCA is the \"single state agency\" that operates Florida's Medicaid program, see 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5), and is responsible for administering Florida's nursing home and \ncommunity-based long-term care system for people with disabilities.  See Florida \nMedicaid, http://ahca.myflorida.com/medicaid/flmedicaid.shtml (last visited 8/23/2010). \n12.  DOH is the primary state agency responsible for administering the Medicaid-\nfunded TBIISCI Waiver Program for persons who require long-term care in the \n4 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 6 of 18 PageID 780\ncommunity.  See Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Program, BSCIP Home, \nhttp://www.doh.state.fl.us/demo/BrainSC/index.html (last visited 8/23/2010); Fla. Stat. § \n381.75 (2009). \nFACTS \n13.  Congress enacted Title XIX ofthe Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396-1396v, \nin 1965, thereby establishing the Medicaid program, a medical assistance program \ncooperatively funded by the federal and state governments.  State participation in \nMedicaid is voluntary, but once a state elects to participate in the Medicaid program, it is \nrequired to administer the Medicaid program in accordance with all federal laws, \nincluding the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. \n14.  Florida participates in the Medicaid program.  One source estimates that for each \ndollar that Florida has spent in 2010 on services in the Medicaid program, it received \n$2.09 in federal funding.  See Kaiser Foundation, Medicaid: A Primer, at 38 (2010), \navailable at http://www.kff.org/medicaid/7334.cfm (last visited 8/23/2010). \n15.  The Medicaid Act authorizes states to obtain Home and Community-Based \nServices (\"HCBS\") waivers from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") to provide alternatives to nursing \nhome care and services.  See 42 C.F.R. § 441.300 (\"Section 1915(c) ofthe [Medicaid] \nAct permits states to offer, under a waiver of statutory requirements, an array of home \nand community-based services that an individual needs to avoid institutionalization.\"). \nWaiver programs reimburse state participants' costs for a range ofhome-based services \nprovided to Medicaid recipients.  See 42 U.S. C. § 1396n(c). \n5 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 7 of 18 PageID 781\n16.  Florida provides community-based services to a limited number of individuals \nwith spinal cord injuries through its TBI/SCI Waiver Program.  This waiver program was \nimplemented in 1999 with the express purpose of\"provid[ing] Medicaid-eligible clients \nwho meet nursing home level of care with long-term, community-based services and \nsupports necessary to live safely and independently in the community.\" See Medicaid \nWaiver Programs, \nhttp://www.doh.state.fl.us/Workforce/BrainSC/Medicaid/medicaidhome.html (last visited \n8/23/201 0). \n17.  To be eligible for the TBIISCI Waiver Program, an individual must meet certain \nincome and asset criteria, as well as medical criteria which would qualify them for \nnursing home \"level of care.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c) & (d); 42 C.P.R. §441.301; see also \nFla. Admin. CodeR. 65A-1.710(4).  Florida residents who have sustained moderate to \nsevere traumatic brain or spinal cord injury and are medically stable and at risk of nursing \nhome care are eligible for the program.  See Medicaid Waiver Program, \nhttp://www.doh.state.fl.us/demo/BrainSC/Medicaid/medicaidhome.html (last visited \n8/23/2010). \n18.  States determine the number of individuals to be served under a particular \nMedicaid waiver.  The State of Florida has limited the TBI/SCI Waiver Program to 375 \nrecipients through 2012.  See Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Program, Core Services \nUnder the Waiver, http://www.doh.state.fl.us/demo/BrainSC/Medicaid/providers.html \n(last visited 8/23/201 0). \n19.  While a state typically gains waiver approval for a period oftime spanning \nseveral years, a state may seek amendments or modifications from CMS to increase the \n6 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 8 of 18 PageID 782\nnumber of individuals served under a particular waiver and such requests are typically \ngranted by CMS in a timely fashion.  See Knowles v. Horn, No. 08-CV-1492, 2010 WL \n517591 (N.D. Tex., Feb. 10, 2010) (citing to Grooms v. Maram, 563 F. Supp. 2d 840, \n857 (N.D. Ill. 2008). \n20.  Expansion of the TBI/SCI Waiver Program would be a reasonable modification of \nthe program.  Nonetheless, Florida has maintained the current limit on waiver services in \nthe TBI/SCI Waiver Program despite the long-standing waiting list for services: a \nJanuary 2010 report reflected that, as ofDecember 2009, 605 individuals were on the \nwait list for the TBI/SCI Waiver Program.  See Profile ofF  lorida's Medicaid Home and \nCommunity-Based Services Waivers, Florida Legislature Office of Program Policy \nAnalysis & Government Accountability, Report No. 10-10, January 2010, at 11, available \nat http://www .oppaga.state.fl. us/ summary. aspx?reportnum= 10 -1 0 (last visited \n8/23/201 0). \n21.  Upon information and belief, the limitation on the number of individuals who can \nreceive services in the Waiver Program means that many individuals with disabilities \nresulting from spinal cord injuries who want to remain living in their communities are at \nrisk of placement in unnecessarily segregated settings despite being qualified to receive \nservices in the State's community-based, Medicaid funded programs. \n22.  Named Plaintiff Jacqueline Jones, a 35-year-old woman with quadriplegia, \nbecame at risk of institutionalization when her parents' health deteriorated, and they were \nno longer able to provide all attendant care services Ms. Jones requires to survive. \n(Affidavit of Jacqueline Jones, ECF No. 12, ~~1, 3-4.)  Despite her eligibility to receive. \n7 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 9 of 18 PageID 783\nservices in the State's TBIISCI Waiver Program, she remained on the wait list for four \nyears.1 \n23.  Luis Cruz, a 52 year-old man with quadriplegia, is at risk of institutionalization \nbecause the in-home services he receives through the State's Medicaid plan are \ninadequate, and he has been hospitalized several times since January 2010.2  (Declaration \nofLuis J. Cruz, Cruz, et al. v. Arnold, et al., No. 10-23048 (S.D. Fla.), Aug. 18, 2010, \nECF No. 3, (\"Cruz Decl.\") ,-[,-[ 2, 5)  Mr. Cruz applied to receive services in the State's \nWaiver Program in January 2006, but he remains on the waiting list.  (ld. ,-[ 8.) \n24.  Nigel De La Torre, a 27 year-old man with quadriplegia, is at risk of \ninstitutionalization due to planned changes in his caregiver circumstances and the \ninadequacy of in-home services provided through the State's Medicaid program. \n(Declaration ofNigel De La Torre, Cruz, et al. v. Arnold, et al., No. 10-23048 (S.D. Fla.), \nAug. 18, 2010, ECF No.4 (\"De La Torre Decl.\") ,-[,-[ 2 & 3.)  He applied for the State's \nWaiver Program in October 2007, but he remains on the waiting list.  (De La Torre Decl. \n,-r,-r 5-6.) \n1 After Ms. Jones filed her amended complaint asserting class claims, the defendants began the process of \nassessing her for enrollment in the TBIISCI Waiver Program.  (See Affidavit of Kristen Russell, dated \nDecember 18,2009, ECF No. 24, ~ 2(C); Pltf.'s Mem. in Opp. to Motion to Dismiss, dated January 13, \n2010, ECF No. 33, at 3.) Nonetheless, Ms. Jones's claims remain justiciable under well-settled law. \nFriends oft he Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Service, Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189-91 (2000); Secretary \nofLaborv. Burger King Corp., 955 F.2d 681,684 (11th Cir. 1992). \n2 On January 27,2010, the plaintiff filed a motion to amend the amended complaint to add Mr. Cruz, Nigel \nDe La Torre and Dwayne Davidson as named plaintiffs in this action.  On August 13,2010, the motion to \namend was denied without prejudice because it raised identical issues presented in the motion to dismiss \nthe amended complaint currently pending before the Court.  In light of this Court's May 7, 2010 order, \nholding that unnamed class members in an uncertified class do not have standing to seek preliminary \ninjunctive relief, a motion for preliminary injunctive relief was filed on August 18, 2010 in a separate \naction on behalf of Mr. Cruz and Mr. De La Torre.  Cruz, et al. v. Arnold, et al., No. 10-725 (M.D. Fla.). \nOn August 23, 2010, that action was transferred to the Southern District of Florida where it has been \ndocketed as Cruz, et al. v. Arnold, et al., No. 10-23048 (S.D. Fla.). \n8 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 10 of 18 PageID 784\n25.  Michele Haddad, a 49 year-old woman with quadriplegia, became at risk of \nunnecessary institutionalization when her caregiver situation changed in 2009.  (See \nHaddad Decl. In Support ofMot. for Prelim. Inj., Haddad v. Arnold, No. 10-414 (M.D. \nFla.), ECF No. 2-1  (\"Haddad Decl.\") ~~ 2, 10, 45.)  She applied for the State's Waiver \nProgram in November 2007 and remained on the waiting list until this Court granted her \nrequest for preliminary injunctive relief on June 23, 2010.  (Id. ~ 6; June 23, 2010 Order, \nHaddad v. Arnold, No. 10-414 (M.D. Fla.), ECF No. 46.) \n26.  Defendant has no comprehensive, effectively working plan in place to address \nunnecessary institutionalization of persons with disabilities resulting from spinal cord \ninjuries.  The waiting list for community-based services experiences very little turnover \nand fails to move at a reasonable pace.  Indeed, when Ms. Haddad was on the wait list, \nthe State informed her that few people will be moved off of the waiting list, and that she \nshould seek services elsewhere due to the lack of capacity within the waiver program. \nSee January 8, 2010 Letter to Michele Haddad, Ex. J ofPls.' Response to Defs.' Mem. In \nOpp. to Preliminary Injunction, Haddad v. Arnold, 10-414 (M.D. Fla. June 6, 2010), ECF \nNo. 29-10, stating: \n[p ]resently, the Department of Children and Families does not have funds \navailable (or available openings) to serve additional individuals through these \nprograms .... Placement on the waiting list does not ensure future eligibility. \nFunding is very limited in these programs, and the amount of funding allocated to \nthese programs has not been increased in many years. Unfortunately, moving \nindividuals off the waiting list into these programs does not occur frequently, \ntherefore, we encourage you to continue seeking services from other programs. \n27.  Instead of developing a plan to address unnecessary institutionalization, the State \nis offering to fund community-based services only after an individual relinquishes his or \nher ties to the community and enters a nursing home.  See Affidavit of Kristen Russell, \n9 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 11 of 18 PageID 785\ndated June 2, 2010, Haddad v.

Dudek, No. 1:10-cv-23048 (S.D. Fla.), ECF No. 34-1 ,-r 15 \n(\"If Messrs. Cruz and De La Torre were to enter a nursing home, I estimate they would \nbe transitioned to the TBI/SCI Waiver program after 60 days of nursing home residency, \nor very soon thereafter.\"); see also  Transcript of June 15,2010 Preliminary lnj'n. Hr'g. \nat 104, Haddad v. Arnold, 10-414 (M.D. Fla.) (\"If somebody is going to spend 60 days in \na nursing home, that makes it much more likely that they would have had to, without \nthese services, go into a nursing home.  It's essentially an assessment of need.\") \n28.  Defendant also delivers personal care assistance services to Florida residents \nthrough an Assistive Care Services (\"ACS\") program, an optional State Medicaid plan \nservice.  The Medicaid program allows states considerable discretion in developing \npersonal care service programs and determining what services will be covered.  42 C.P.R. \n441.  Defendant chooses to restrict eligibility for these services to Medicaid-eligible \nindividuals living in assisted living facilities, qualified residential treatment facilities, or \nadult family-care homes (preventing individuals in the community from accessing these \nser\\rices).  See Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, Assisted Care Services, \navailable at: http://ahca.myflorida.com/medicaid/asc/index.shtml (last visited 8/23/2010). \nDefendant could modify this eligibility restriction to allow individuals with disabilities \nresulting from spinal cord injuries, who reside in the community, to receive these \nservices. \n10 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 12 of 18 PageID 786\n29.  The average per capita rate at which Medicaid reimburses nursing homes for \nMedicaid services is $209.20 per day, or roughly $6276 per month.  See AHCA Nursing \nHome Rates, http://ahca.my.florida.com/Medicaid/cost_reimb.  In contrast, the State \nreported that the average monthly per capita cost of services in the TBIISCI waiver \nprogram during fiscal year 2008-2009 was $2,361.47. See Profile ofF  lorida's Medicaid \nHome and Community-Based Services Waivers, Florida Legislature Office of Program \nPolicy Analysis & Government Accountability, Report No. 10-10, January 2010, at 11. \n30.  The State continues to fund costly, unnecessary nursing home placements, while \nit could instead provide community-based services at a lower cost.  The state continues to \nfund these placements despite the fact that it has admitted that \"[i]n most cases, when a \nMedicaid recipient is diverted or transitioned from a nursing facility to an [in-home \nservices] waiver program, costs to Medicaid for providing care to that individual are \nreduced.\" Affidavit of Michele Hudson, AHCA Bureau Chief for Medicaid Program \nAnalysis, dated June 2, 2010, Haddad v. Arnold, 10-414 (M.D. Fla.), ECF No. 26-1 ~15. \nCOUNT I \nVIOLATION OF TITLE II OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \n31.  The allegations ofParagraphs 1 through 30 ofthe Complaint in Intervention are \nhereby realleged and incorporated by reference. \n32.  Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S. C.§ 12132, prohibits public entities from \ndiscriminating against any qualified individual with a disability and from excluding any \nqualified individual with a disability from \"participation in or the benefits of the services, \n11 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 13 of 18 PageID 787\nprograms or activities of the public entity\" on the basis of disability.  42 U.S.C. §§ \n12131-12132. \n33.  Title II requires a public entity to \"administer services, programs, and activities in \nthe most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with \ndisabilities.\"  28 C.P.R.§ 35.130(d).  \"[U]ndue institutionalization,\" \"unjustified \ninstitutional isolation,\" and \"unjustified segregation\" constitute discrimination under the \nADA.

Defendant is subject to title II of the ADA, 42 \nU.S. C. §§ 12131 et seq., and its implementing regulations, 28 C.P.R. Part 35. \n35.  Defendant discriminates against \"qualified individual[s] with a disability,\" in \nviolation of the ADA by administering its Medicaid program, including its TBIISCI \nWaiver Program, in a manner that denies individuals with disabilities the opportunity to \nreceive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, placing them at \nrisk of unnecessary institutionalization. \n36.  Providing adequate community-based services to qualified individuals with \ndisabilities resulting from spinal cord injuries so that they can remain living in the \ncommunity is a reasonable modification of the State's Medicaid program. \n37.  Defendant's actions constitute discrimination in violation of title II of the ADA, \n42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing regulations at 28 CPR§ 35.130. \n12 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 14 of 18 PageID 788\nCOUNT II \nVIOLATION OF SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT \n38.  The allegations ofParagraphs 1 through 37 ofthe Complaint in Intervention are \nhereby realleged and incorporated by reference. \n39.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) provides: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... shall, \nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be \ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving federal financial assistance or under any program or activity ... \n40.  The Rehabilitation Act requires recipients of federal financial assistance to \n\"administer programs or activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs \nof qualified handicapped persons.\"  28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d); see also 45 C.F.R. § 84.4 . \n.. 41.- . -The State of Florida receives federal financial assistance.  -\n42.  Defendant discriminates against \"qualified individual[ s] with a disability,\" in \nviolation of the Rehabilitation Act by administering its Medicaid program, including its \nTBIISCI Waiver Program, in a manner that denies individuals with disabilities the \nopportunity to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, \nplacing them at risk of unnecessary institutionalization. \n43.  Providing adequate community-based services to qualified individuals with \ndisabilities resulting from spinal cord injuries so that they can remain living in the \ncommunity is a reasonable modification of the State's Medicaid program. \n44.  Defendant's actions constitute discrimination in violation of section 504 ofthe \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S. C. § 794, and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. \n§ 41.51(d); 45 C.F.R. § 84.1 et seq. \n13 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 15 of 18 PageID 789\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the United States of America prays that the Court: \nA.  Grant judgment in favor of the United States on its Complaint in \nIntervention and declare that Defendant has violated title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § \n12131, et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §794, and all \nrelevant implementing regulations; \nB.  Enjoin Defendant (1) from discriminating against plaintiffs and other \nmembers of the public in the administration of its Medicaid services, including the \nTBI/SCI Waiver Program, in a manner that puts individuals with disabilities at risk of \nunnecessary institutionalization, and (2) to administer its Medicaid services in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individuals with disabilities.  Relief may \ninclude, but is not necessarily limited to: \n1.  Immediately discontinue the practice of requiring that individuals \nenter an institutional setting, such as a nursing home, in order to receive community-\nbased services; \n2.  Expand the Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord Injury Waiver \nProgram to provide sufficient, periodic increases in Waiver Program slots and \ncommunity-based services to additional eligible individuals, specifically including \npersons who are at risk of institutionalization, and eliminating the unreasonable length of \nthe waiting list; and either in combination or alternatively; \n3.  Expand personal care services, including, but not limited to, the \nAssistive Care Services program, to provide sufficient home and community-based \nservices to individuals who reside in the community, rather than restricting such services \n14 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 84-1    Filed 09/10/10   Page 16 of 18 PageID 790\nto individuals residing in assisted living facilities, qualified residential treatment \nfacilities, adult family-care homes or other similar facilities; \nC.

ANA  VIAMONTE  ROS,  in  her  official  capacity  as \nSurgeon  General,  Florida  Department  of  Health,  by  and  through  the \nundersigned  counsel,  hereby  submit  this  response  in  opposition  to  the \n1 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 87    Filed 10/07/10   Page 2 of 8 PageID 799\nUnited States’ Motion to Intervene.   The Court should deny this motion \nbecause  the  original  case  is  moot,  the  interests  of  the United States are \nadequately represented, and the United States seeks to improperly change \ndefendants.  As further support therefore, Defendants submit the following \nMemorandum of Law, which is attached hereto and is incorporated herein \nby reference. \nMEMORANDUM OF LAW \nI.  The Original Case is Moot \nThis lawsuit was filed by Jacqueline Jones in December, 2009.  On \nFebruary 1, 2010, Jacqueline Jones was enrolled in the Florida Medicaid \nTraumatic Brain Injury / Spinal Cord Injury Waiver Program (TBI / SCI \nWaiver).    At  that  time,  this  case  became  moot  as  Plaintiff  Jones  then \nreceived all the relief she sought in her Amended Complaint.  On January 6, \n2010,  Plaintiff  filed  her  Motion  for  Class  Certification,  which  is  still \npending. \nWhere the named plaintiff’s case is mooted before a motion for class \ncertification  has  been  filed,  the  motion  for  class  certification  should  be \ndenied because there is no underlying case or controversy under Article III of \n                                                             \n1 Pursuant to Rule 25, Fed. R. Civ. P., Elizabeth Dudek is automatically substituted as named Defendant \n2 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 87    Filed 10/07/10   Page 3 of 8 PageID 800\nthe U.S. Constitution.  See Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 403, 95 S. Ct. 553, \n559, 42 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1975) (“A litigant must be a member of the class \nwhich he or she seeks to represent at the time the class action is certified by \nthe district court”).  Some courts would permit a class action to proceed even \nwhere the named plaintiff’s case becomes moot prior to class certification, so \nlong as the plaintiff’s case was not moot at the time the motion for class \ncertification was filed.  See e.g., Cavallo v. Utica-Watertown Health Ins. Co., \nInc.,  191  F.R.D.  342  (N.D.N.Y.  2000).    However,  the  Eleventh  Circuit \nfollows the law in Sosna, and a class action is moot where the putative class \nrepresentative’s case is no longer live at the time of class certification.  See \nTucker v. Phyfer, 819 F.2d 1030, 1033 (11th Cir. Ala. 1987) (“In a class \naction, the claim of the named plaintiff, who seeks to represent the class, \nmust be live both at the time he brings suit and when the district court \ndetermines whether to certify the putative class. If the plaintiff's claim is not \nlive, the court lacks a justiciable controversy and must dismiss the claim as \nmoot”). \nBecause the underlying action was moot at the time the United States \nfiled its Motion to Intervene, the motion should be denied.  The United \n                                                             \nas the successor in office of Thomas W. Arnold. \n3 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 87    Filed 10/07/10   Page 4 of 8 PageID 801\nStates claims to have a substantial legal interest in the subject matter of the \naction,  but  given  that  the  action  is  moot,  there  is  no  action  to  have  a \nsubstantial legal interest in.  Intervention by the United States would only \nserve to “breathe life into a non-existent suit.”  Schulz v. Lotter, 528 F. \nSupp. 675, 677 (E.D. Wis. 1981) (quoting  McKay v. Heyison, 614 F.2d \n899, 906 (3rd Cir. 1980)).  \nII.  The Interests of the United States are Adequately Represented by \nthe Existing Parties. \n \nThe  United  States  claims  that  its  interests  are  not  adequately \nrepresented by existing parties.  However, in its motion, the United States \nmade no attempt whatsoever to distinguish its interests from those of the \nexisting Plaintiff.  Indeed, in two other actions brought by plaintiffs who \nhave previously sought to become named plaintiffs in the instant action, the \nUnited States has filed Statements of Interest that demonstrate its interests \ncoincide with the existing plaintiff exactly.  See Haddad v. Arnold, No. 10-\n414 (M.D. Fla.), ECF No. 10; Cruz v. Dudek, No. 10-23048 (S.D. Fla.), \nECF No. 40.  In neither of these documents does the Department of Justice \ndistinguish its views or positions from those of the private plaintiffs.  Rather, \nthe Department simply reiterates the arguments of these plaintiffs. \n4 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 87    Filed 10/07/10   Page 5 of 8 PageID 802\nThe Department of Justice indicates that the Plaintiff “will not be able \nto make all the arguments that the United States will make if allowed to \nintervene.”  To the contrary, Plaintiff is represented by eminently competent \ncounsel who is more than capable of making every relevant argument on \nPlaintiff’s behalf (and, because Plaintiff’s interests are identical to those of \nthe Department of Justice, these include all argument that the Department of \nJustice would make).  Plaintiff’s attorney, Stephen F. Gold, has litigated \nover 50 cases under the Americans With Disabilities Act and Section 504, \nand dozens of other cases on behalf of persons with disabilities under other \nstatutes.  See,  e.g.,  Fisher  v.  Oklahoma  Health Care Authority, 335 F.3d \n1175 (10th Cir. 2003); Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325 (3d Cir. 1995), \ncert denied, 116 S.Ct. 64 (1995); sub nom. Secretary of DPW of Pa. v. Idell \nS.; Nelson v. Thornburgh, 567 F. Supp. 369 (E.D. Pa. 1983), aff’d, 732 \nF.2d  146  (3d  Cir.  1984),  cert  denied,  105  S.Ct.  955  (1985);  American \nDisabled For Accessible Pub. Transp. (ADAPT) v. Skinner, 676 F. Supp. \n635 (E.D. Pa. 1988), 867 F.2d 1471 (3d Cir. 1989), 881 F.2d 1184 (3d Cir. \n1989)  (en  banc)  (federal  regulation  which  permitted  transportation \nauthorities to cap funds expended on disabled persons violated minimum \nservice  criteria;  required  U.S.  DOT  to  promulgate  new  regulations  – \n5 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 87    Filed 10/07/10   Page 6 of 8 PageID 803\nConcurrence opinion cited with approval by Congress in legislative history \nof ADA); Sabree v. Richman, 367 F.3d 180 (3d Cir. 2004).  Importantly, \nMr.  Gold  has  litigated  all  the  above-listed  cases  without  the  aid  of  the \nDepartment of Justice as an intervening party.2  In fact, in the ADAPT v. \nSkinner case, Mr. Gold prevailed against the Department of Justice, which \nrepresented the Secretary of Transportation.  \nIII.  The United States Seeks To Improperly Change Defendants \n  The  Amended  Complaint  was  brought  by  Plaintiff  Jones  against \nThomas Arnold, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Florida Agency \nfor Health Care Administration and Dr. Ana Viamonte Ros, in her official \ncapacity  as Secretary3 of the Florida Department of Health.  The United \nStates’  Complaint  in  Intervention  lists  only  one  defendant:  the  State  of \nFlorida.    This  is  an  attempt to utterly transform the case.  The Plaintiff \nbrought suit against certain defined defendants, and now the Department of \nJustice is attempting to pull the rug out from under the Plaintiff’s feet by \nchanging the parties to this action.  Furthermore, replacing Defendants with \nthe  State  of  Florida  would  be  unfair  to  this  new defendant.  While the \n                     \n2 In the Helen L. case, the Department of Justice filed an amicus \nbrief.  \n3 The case style has been amended to reflect the Surgeon General’s \ncorrect title. \n6 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01170-MMH-JRK   Document 87    Filed 10/07/10   Page 7 of 8 PageID 804\nSecretary of AHCA and the Surgeon General have had an opportunity to, for \nexample,  oppose  Plaintiff’s  Motion  for  Class  Certification,  the  State  of \nFlorida, as an independent party, has had no such opportunity.
