    "summary": "<p>IN 2010, after Louisiana proposed a reduction in available nursing hours as part of Louisiana Medicaid's Long-Term Personal Care Services (LT-PCS) program, the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. The named Plaintiffs, seeking to represent a class of similarly situated individuals with disabilities, had each been approved for about 40 in-home nursing hours through the LT-PCS program. The proposed cuts would cap nursing hours at 32. The Plaintiffs alleged that this reduction would put them at risk of unnecessary institutionalization in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (under the Supreme Court precedent, Olmstead v. L.C.) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Plaintiffs also argued that the state had provided inadequate notice of the changes in violation of the Medicaid Act and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>The State filed a motion to dismiss (October 21, 2010) which was later converted (in December 2010) to a motion for summary judgment, seeking to resolve the case in their favor before trial.  In April 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a Statement of Interest in support of the Plaintiffs.  On May 18, 2011, Judge James J. Brady denied the Defendants' motion and allowed the case to proceed, and on June 6, 2011, Judge Brady certified the plaintiff class. After these plaintiff successes and a period of discovery, the parties settled. </p><p>In January 2012, the court entered a settlement agreement designed to meet the care needs of the plaintiff population. Under this agreement, the State promised to create enrollment slots so that the affected population could enroll (in an expedited fashion) in the Louisiana's Community Choice Waiver program to meet their home care needs. Recipients who are deemed eligible to receive the new maximum of 32 LT-PCS hours will be notified of the option of expedited enrollment in the CC Waiver instead. The agreement outlines the criteria for admission to the CC Waiver program and obligates the state to resolve such requests by June 30, 2012. The agreement is to be enforceable only until December 31, 2012, but the deadline will be extended if the state has failed to meet its obligations by that time.  </p><p>On Jan. 18, 2013, the parties jointly moved to dismiss the case with prejudice, because both agreed that the conditions outlined in the Settlement Agreement have been met. On Jan. 29, 2013, Judge Brady dismissed the case.</p>",

No. 3:10-cv-00635-JJB-SCR \n  Plaintiffs,  ) \n  )  JUDGE JAMES J. BRADY \nv.   ) \n  )  MAGISTRATE JUDGE STEPHEN  \nBRUCE GREENSTEIN, et al.  )    C. RIEDLINGER \n) \n  Defendants  )  CLASS ACTION \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nThe United States respectfully submits this Statement of Interest, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.    \n§ 517,1 because this litigation implicates the proper interpretation and application of title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (“ADA”), and in particular, its \nintegration mandate.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).  The \nDepartment of Justice has authority to enforce title II, 42 U.S.C. § 12133, and to issue \nregulations implementing the statute, 42 U.S.C. § 12134.  The United States thus has a strong \ninterest in the resolution of this matter.   \n  This lawsuit alleges that the State of Louisiana’s reduction of the maximum number of \nweekly available hours of service in its Long-Term Personal Care Services (“LT-PCS”) program \nwill place individuals with disabilities who receive these community-based services at risk of \ninstitutionalization in violation of the ADA.  (Compl. ¶¶ 1-5, 38, 103-07.)  See 36 La. Reg. 1752 \n(Aug. 2010) (announcing reduction in maximum number of weekly LT-PCS services from 42 to \n32 hours per week.)  Plaintiffs propose to bring this suit on behalf of a class defined as current \n                                                 \n1 28 U.S.C. § 517 permits the Attorney General to send any officer of the Department of Justice “to any State or \ndistrict in the United States to attend to the interests of the United States in a suit pending in a court of the United \nStates.” \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 1 of 23\n\nand prospective Medicaid-eligible Louisiana residents receiving LT-PCS services, “who desire \nto live in the community instead of in a nursing facility[,] who can reside in the community with \nappropriate Medicaid-funded LT-PCS services[,] and who are at risk of being forced to enter a \nnursing home” because of Defendants’ reduction of available LT-PCS services. (Compl. ¶ 97.)   \nEach of the four named plaintiffs and putative class member Cleo Lancaster (collectively, \n“Plaintiffs”) currently live in their own homes in the community and have been able to do so \nbecause Defendants provide reimbursement for Plaintiffs’ personal care services through the \nState’s LT-PCS program.  (Id. ¶ 3.)  The LT-PCS program provides hourly reimbursement for \nmedically necessary assistance to each of the Plaintiffs, including eating, bathing, toileting, \ntransferring, preparing meals, managing medication, and arranging for transportation and \nmedical appointments.  (Id. ¶ 31.)   Defendants’ reduction of the maximum number of weekly \nhours of service available to individuals in the LT-PCS program offers no appeals process to \nindividuals who require greater than 32 hours of service to remain in the community.  36 La. \nReg. 1752 (Aug. 2010).  Plaintiffs allege this reduction presents a grave threat to their ability to \nremain safely in their homes and in the community – placing them and others in the putative \nclass at risk of deteriorating health conditions, repeated hospitalizations and emergency room \nvisits, and, ultimately, entry into a segregated, institutional setting.  (Compl. ¶¶ 1-5, 38-39, 103-\n107.)  Plaintiffs request that the State reasonably modify the LT-PCS program to permit \nPlaintiffs and members of the proposed class to retain their present level of hours, or to allow \nnew enrollees to exceed the 32-hour cap (up to 42 hours) to the extent that level of service is \nnecessary to enable them to live in the community settings.  (Id. ¶ 105; Pls.’ Mem. in Opp. to \nDefs.’ Mot. for Sum. J. (“Pls.’ Mem.”) at 31-32.)  Defendants refuse to make the reasonable \n2  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 2 of 23\n\nmodifications requested by the Plaintiffs, asserting that the reduction is necessary in light of \nbudgetary shortfalls. (Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Defs’ Mot. to Dismiss (“Defs.’ Mem.”) at 2.) \nPlaintiffs commenced this lawsuit on September 22, 2010, to prevent Defendants from \nreducing LT-PCS services as to named plaintiffs and putative class members, each of whom they \nallege will be placed at risk of institutionalization due to the reduction in services.  (Compl. ¶¶ \n37-39, 96-102.)  Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on October 21, 2010.  On December 3, \n2010, this Court converted that motion into a Motion for Summary Judgment, pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(d).  Plaintiffs responded to the Defendants’ converted Motion \nfor Summary Judgment on March 14, 2011.  Defendants filed their Reply on March 30, 2011. \nThe United States respectfully urges this Court to deny Defendants’ converted Motion for \nSummary Judgment.  Plaintiffs have presented ample disputed material facts supporting their \nADA claim, including the potentially devastating effects of Defendants’ reduction of available \nhours in the State’s LT-PCS program and the inadequacy of Defendants’ efforts to ensure long-\nterm care is provided in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of individuals with \ndisabilities.  Moreover, Defendants’ presentation of the law fundamentally mischaracterizes the \nState’s obligations under title II of the ADA.  \nStatutory and Regulatory Background   \n  Congress enacted the ADA in 1990 “to provide a clear and comprehensive national \nmandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.”  42 U.S.C.     \n§ 12101(b)(1).  Congress found that “historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate \nindividuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination \nagainst individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.”  \n3  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 3 of 23\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2).  For those reasons, Congress prohibited discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities by public entities:  \n[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, \nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \nentity. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n \n  As directed by Congress, the Attorney General issued regulations implementing title II, \nwhich are based on regulations issued under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.2  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 12134(a); 28 C.F.R. § 35.190(a); Executive Order 12250, 45 Fed. Reg. 72995 (1980), \nreprinted in 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1.  The title II regulations require public entities to “administer \nservices, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \nqualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  The preamble discussion of the \n“integration regulation” explains that “the most integrated setting” is one that                    \n“enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent \npossible . . . .”  28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. A (2010) (addressing § 35.130).   \nTwelve years ago, the Supreme Court applied these authorities and held that title II \nprohibits the unjustified segregation of individuals with disabilities.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 596.  \nThere, the Court held that public entities are required to provide community-based services to \npersons with disabilities when (a) such services are appropriate; (b) the affected persons do not \noppose community-based treatment; and (c) community-based services can be reasonably \naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the entity and the needs of others \n                                                 \n2 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 similarly prohibits disability-based discrimination.  29 U.S.C.            \n§ 794(a) (“No otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .”).  Claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are treated \nidentically unless one of the differences in the two statutes is pertinent to a claim.  Kemp v. Holder, 610 F.3d 231, \n234-35 (5th Cir. 2010); Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 272 (2d Cir. 2003). \n4  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 4 of 23\n\nwho are receiving disability services from the entity.  Id. at 607.  The Court explained that this \nholding “reflects two evident judgments.”  Id. at 600.  “First, institutional placement of persons \nwho can handle and benefit from community settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that \npersons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.”  Id.  “Second, \nconfinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, \nincluding family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational \nadvancement, and cultural enrichment.”  Id. at 601.   \nTo comply with the ADA’s integration requirement, a state must reasonably modify its \npolicies, procedures or practices when necessary to avoid discrimination.  28 C.F.R.                    \n§ 35.130(b)(7).  The obligation to make reasonable modifications may be excused only where a \nstate demonstrates that the requested modifications would “fundamentally alter” the programs or \nservices at issue.  Id.; see also Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 604-07.   \nSUMMARY OF FACTS \nA.  Louisiana’s Long-Term Care System \n \nThe Medicaid program is a medical assistance program cooperatively funded by the \nfederal and state governments.  See Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 289 n.1 (1985); 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396 et seq.. The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (“DHH”) is the “single \nstate agency” that administers Louisiana’s Medicaid program.  (Defs.’ Mem. at 3); see also 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5).  The Office of Aging and Adult Services (“OAAS”), which is within \nDHH, directs the management and administration of services for long-term care of the elderly \nand persons with adult onset disabilities in Louisiana.  (Ex. 1 to Defs’ Mem., Declaration of \nHugh R. Eley (“Eley Decl.”) ¶ 1).  These services include those provided in public and private \nnursing facilities and several programs providing home and community-based services \n5  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 5 of 23\n\n(“HCBS”), which allow recipients to remain integrated in the community and receive services at \nhome.  (Id. ¶¶ 1, 7-13.)   \nIn fiscal year 2009, Louisiana spent nearly $717 million on reimbursement for care \nprovided in private nursing facilities, serving a population of 30,137 individuals.  (Ex. 1 to Pls.’ \nMem., Transcript of Deposition of Hugh Eley (“Eley Dep.”), p. 216, ll. 12-15; Doc. \nPitts_0001188, attached to Pls.’ Mem. at DKT 38-5 (“Pitts_0001188”), pp. 179-180.)   By \ncontrast, in fiscal year 2009, the State spent approximately $313 million on its various HCBS \nprograms, serving a population of 14,798 individuals.  (Pitts_0001188.)  OAAS administers four \nprimary HCBS programs: the LT-PCS program, two “waivers” authorized by the federal Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”),3 and the Program for All Inclusive Care for the \nElderly (“PACE”) .  (Eley Decl. ¶ 7.)4  \nWhile Louisiana serves fewer than 6,000 individuals through its two waiver programs5 \nand the PACE program,6 Louisiana’s LT-PCS program provided home and community-based \n                                                 \n3 The waiver authority permits the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or her designee, to waive certain \nrequirements of the Medicaid Act in order for the state to offer home and community-based services. See 42 U.S.C.  \n§ 1396n(c)(3); 42 U.S.C. §1396n(d)(3).  \n \n4 Defendants note in their brief that Louisiana participates in the federal “Money Follows the Person” demonstration \nprogram. (Defs.’ Mem. at 8.)  The Money Follows the Person program provides enhanced federal financial \nparticipation to assist states in transitioning currently institutionalized individuals into the community. See Pub. L. \n109-171, Title VI, § 6071, Feb. 8, 2006, 120 Stat. 102.  To be eligible to participate in the program, an individual \nmust reside in a nursing facility for at least 90 days.  See Pub.L. 111-148, Title II, § 2403(a), (b)(1), Mar. 23, 2010, \n124 Stat. 304.  The program does not provide any additional “slots” in the Defendants’ HCBS programs.    \n \n5 Louisiana’s Elderly and Disabled Adults (“EDA”) waiver program has been approved by CMS to offer 4,603 \n“slots.”  (Eley Decl. ¶ 18).  The Adult Day Health Care (“ADHC”) waiver program, which provides at least five \nhours of care per day for one or more days per week in an adult day care center, is also capped  at 825 “slots” and is \navailable only to individuals within a geographically limited area surrounding each center.  (Id. ¶¶ 22,  25.)   \nBecause each of the slots in these waivers is currently occupied, the state operates a “Request for Services Registry,” \nwhich is a waiting list for services for each of the waiver programs.  (Id. 18, 25.)   \n \n6 The PACE program operates out of two State-run centers in New Orleans and Baton Rouge.  (Eley Decl. ¶27.)  \nServices from each PACE center are only available to individuals over the age of 55 who live within a \ngeographically-limited area surrounding the center and who require a nursing facility level of care.  (Id.)  The \nprogram is also space-limited, serving a maximum of 380 individuals. (Id.)  None of the named plaintiffs is eligible \n6  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 6 of 23\n\nservices to more than 12,000 individuals in fiscal year 2009-10.  (Eley Decl. ¶ 35.)  The LT-PCS \nprogram provides reimbursement for medically necessary assistance with activities of daily \nliving (“ADLs”), including eating, bathing, dressing, grooming, transferring, ambulation and \ntoileting.  (Id. ¶ 31.)  Services also include assistance with instrumental activities of daily living \n(“IADLs”), such as housekeeping, food preparation and storage, shopping, laundry, scheduling \nmedical appointments, accessing transportation, and medication reminders.  (Id.)  To be eligible \nfor services in the LT-PCS program, an applicant must meet the program’s criteria for medical \nnecessity, which, for individuals not currently in a nursing facility, include (1) meeting the \nmedical standards for admission to a nursing facility, and (2) being assessed as at risk of nursing \nfacility placement.  (Id. ¶ 32.)  Because LT-PCS is a service provided through the State’s \nMedicaid State Plan for Medical Assistance, rather than through a waiver, there is no limit on \nhow many eligible individuals may receive LT-PCS, and there is therefore no waiting list for LT-\nPCS services.  (Id. ¶ 33.)  \nAt its inception in 2004, the LT-PCS program provided up to 56 hours of personal care \nhours per week.  (Eley Decl. ¶ 36.)  In March 2009, pursuant to a modification of the Barthelemy \nsettlement agreement,7 and to bring the State’s EDA waiver program into compliance with \nfederal law requiring cost-neutrality of waiver programs, Defendants reduced the maximum \nnumber of hours of LT-PCS services to 42 hours per week. (Eley Dep., p. 66, l. 9 – p.67, l. 17); \nsee also 35 La. Reg. 32-34 (Jan. 2009).  In September 2010, Defendants announced another \nreduction in the number of maximum available weekly LT-PCS hours from 42 to 32.  36 La. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nfor this program, either due to their age or because they do not reside within the geographic area served by either of \nthe centers.  (See Pls.’ Mem. at 16-17). \n \n7 OAAS developed each of its current HCBS programs in part to comply with the requirements of a 2001 settlement \nagreement in the lawsuit Barthelemy v. Hood, No. 00-1083 (E.D. La.). (See Eley Decl. ¶ 13; Ex. 14 to Pls.’ Mem., \nBarthelemy Settlement Agreement, at 9-12, 16-17.)    \n \n7  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 7 of 23\n\nReg. 1752 (Aug.  2010.)  The new cap on the number of available hours will take effect when \neach recipient receives his or her annual reassessment, in which the number of weekly hours of \nservice is determined.8  (Eley Decl. ¶ 37.)  There are no exceptions to Defendants’ 32-hour cap \non LT-PCS hours for individuals who require additional hours to prevent their \ninstitutionalization.  (Eley Decl. ¶39.)  According to the Defendants, approximately 28% of the \nindividuals receiving services in the LT-PCS program (all people currently receiving over 32 \nhours) will be affected by the new cap on weekly hours.  (Id. ¶ 37.)  Defendants admit that LT-\nPCS services are less costly than nursing facility services.  (Exhibit 16 to Pls.’ Mem., Letter from \nCaroline Brown dated March 4, 2011, at p. 2, ¶4.)  Defendants believe that the cut in the \nmaximum available hours will save the State approximately 1.6% in its overall budget for HCBS \nservices. (Eley Decl. ¶ 41.) \nB.  Plaintiffs Reside in the Community and Depend Upon Personal Care Services for \nTheir Essential Needs \n \nThe named Plaintiffs, Helen Pitts, Kenneth Roman, Denise Hodges, and Rickii Ainey, \nand proposed class member Cleo Lancaster, are qualified individuals with disabilities who are \neligible for and receive services through Defendants’ Medicaid program.  (See Ex. 3 to Pls.’ \nMem., Declaration of Helen Pitts (“Pitts Decl.”) ¶ 13; Ex. 4 to Pls.’ Mem., Declaration of \nKenneth Roman (“Roman Decl.”) ¶ 7; Ex. 5 to Pls’ Mem., Declaration of Denise Hodges \n(“Hodges Decl.”) ¶ 8; Ex. 6 to Pls.’ Mem., Declaration of Rickii Ainey (“Ainey Decl.”) ¶ 19; Ex. \n7 to Pls.’ Mem, Declaration of Cleo Lancaster (“Lancaster Decl.”) ¶ 12.)  Each currently receives \nservices through Defendants’ LT-PCS program and, because of their participation in this \nprogram, is able to reside in their own home in the community.  (Pitts Decl. ¶¶ 22-23; Roman \n                                                 \n8 Only Plaintiff Rickii Ainey’s and putative class member Cleo Lancaster’s reassessment dates have been reached. \n(Pls.’ Mem. at 4, n. 11.)  The parties have reached a temporary agreement maintaining their services at prior levels, \nrather than requiring plaintiffs to seek preliminary relief from this Court. (Id.) \n8  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 8 of 23\n\nDecl. ¶¶ 19-20; Hodges Decl. ¶¶ 9, 16; Ainey Decl. ¶¶ 28-29; Lancaster Decl. ¶¶ 13, 16.)  Each \nhas been individually assessed by Defendants to require the level of care available in a nursing \nfacility and to receive a certain number of LT-PCS hours to prevent them from entering into a \nnursing facility.  (Pitts Decl. ¶ 15; Roman Decl. ¶¶ 19-20; Hodges Decl. ¶¶ 15-16; Ainey Decl. \n¶¶ 27-28; Lancaster Decl. ¶ 13.)  Each currently receives at least 39 hours of services per week in \nthe LT-PCS program, and if Defendants’ reduction of the maximum number of available LT-\nPCS hours is put into effect, will no longer be eligible to receive their current levels of services.9  \n(Pitts Decl. ¶ 22; Roman Decl. ¶ 20; Hodges Decl. ¶ 16; Ainey Decl. ¶ 28; Lancaster Decl. ¶ 13.)  \nARGUMENT \nPursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is \nappropriate where “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. \n317, 322 (1986).  A genuine issue of material fact exists if a reasonable jury could return a \njudgment for the non-moving party based on the evidence.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 \nU.S. 242, 248 (1986).  The moving party bears the initial burden of “informing the district court \nof the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes \ndemonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325; see also \nNorman v. Apache Corp., 19 F.3d 1017, 1023 (5th Cir. 1994).  If the moving party fails to meet \nthis burden, the motion for summary judgment must be denied, “regardless of the nonmovant’s \nresponse.”  Duffie v. United States, 600 F.3d 362, 371 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing Quorum Health \nRes., L.L.C. v. Maverick County Hosp. Dist., 308 F.3d 451, 471 (5th Cir. 2002).  In evaluating a \n                                                 \n9 Since the filing of this lawsuit, Plaintiffs Helen Pitts and Denise Hodges, and proposed class member Cleo \nLancaster, have been offered and accepted slots in Defendants’ EDA Waiver program, for which they have been on \nthe waiting for over three years.  (See Pls.’ Mem. at 5, n.16, 28, n. 148.)  As of March 14, 2011, they had not started \nreceiving services under the EDA waiver and were each still receiving services under Louisiana’s LT-PCS program. \n(Id.) \n9  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 9 of 23\n\nmotion for summary judgment, the court “construe[s] all facts and inferences in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmoving party.”  Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir. 2005) (quoting \nMurray v. Earle, 405 F.3d 278, 284 (5th Cir. 2005)).       \nDefendants have failed to establish that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  \nAs discussed below, Plaintiffs have presented ample evidence of disputed issues of material fact \nas to whether Defendants’ reduction in available LT-PCS services will place them and others \nsimilarly situated at risk of institutionalization.  Defendants have not demonstrated as a matter of \nlaw that Plaintiffs’ requested modification would fundamentally alter Defendants’ long-term care \nprograms or Defendants’ purported plan for deinstitutionalizing individuals with disabilities.  \nLastly, Plaintiffs have a private right of action to enforce title II of the ADA, as interpreted by \nthe integration regulation.  The integration regulation is a valid and authoritative interpretation of \ntitle II of the ADA. \nA.  Disputed Issues of Material Fact Exist Regarding Whether Defendants’ \nReduction in Available LT-PCS Hours Will Place Plaintiffs and Members of \nthe Proposed Plaintiff Class at Risk of Institutionalization in Violation of the \nADA \n \n1.  Policies that place individuals with disabilities at risk of institutionalization violate \nthe ADA \n \n  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ allegations that the alterations to the LT-PCS program \nwill place them at risk of institutionalization “are not equivalent to allegations of systemic \n‘unjustified isolation’ under Olmstead.”  (Defs.’ Mem. at 20; Defs.’ Reply at 12-16.)  But, as \nnumerous courts have recognized, policies that place individuals with disabilities at risk of \ninstitutionalization are discriminatory under the ADA.10 \n                                                 \n10 Defendants’ assertion that Plaintiffs have not stated a claim for relief under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act \nbecause the ADA does not “require states to provide a certain level of benefits to individuals with disabilities” is \nequally without merit.  (Defs.’ Mem. at 16.)  While the ADA does not mandate what specific services a state must \noffer, it does require states to refrain from adopting policies or engaging in practices that discriminate, including \n1 0 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 10 of 23\n\nIn Fisher, for example, the State of Oklahoma adopted a policy of providing unlimited \ncoverage of medically necessary prescription drugs to individuals in institutions, but only limited  \ncoverage for individuals receiving services in community-based waiver programs.  335 F.3d at \n1177.  Plaintiffs argued that, because of the policy change, many of the plaintiffs would be \nplaced at risk of institutionalization, remaining in their homes only “until their health ha[d] \ndeteriorated” and “eventually end[ing] up in a nursing home.”  335 F.3d at 1185.  The Tenth \nCircuit agreed, reversed the district court’s award of summary judgment to the state, and noted \nthat “nothing in the Olmstead decision supports a conclusion that institutionalization is a \nprerequisite to enforcement of the ADA’s integration requirements.”  Id. at 1181.  The court \nremarked that “Olmstead does not imply that disabled persons who, by reason of a change in \nstate policy, stand imperiled with segregation, may not bring a challenge to the state policy under \nthe ADA’s integration mandate without first submitting to institutionalization.”  Id. at 1182.  \nSimilarly, in Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, the court concluded that “the risk of institutionalization \nis sufficient[,]” to state a claim for violation of the integration mandate and granted the plaintiffs’ \nmotion for preliminary injunction.  656 F. Supp. 2d 1161, 1170 (N.D. Cal. 2009). (quotation \nmarks omitted).11   \n                                                                                                                                                             \nthose that will render individuals at risk of institutionalization.

Cal. 2010) appeal docketed, No. 10-15635 (9th \nCir. Mar. 24, 2010) and V.L. v. Wagner, 669 F. Supp. 2d 1106, 1109 (N.D. Cal. 2009), appeal docketed No. 09-\n17581 (9th Cir.

Rogers, No. CV 00-67, 2009 WL 1395423, at *5 (D. Ariz. Apr. 24, 2009) (holding state liable under the \nADA for failure to provide adequate services to avoid unnecessary institutionalization); Crabtree v. Goetz, No. 3:08-\n0939, 2008 WL 5330506, at *30 (M.D. Tenn. Dec. 19, 2008) (“Plaintiffs have demonstrated a strong likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of their [ADA] claims that the Defendants’ drastic cuts of their home health care services will \nforce their institutionalization in nursing homes.”). \n1 1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 11 of 23\n\nDefendants suggest that LT-PCS recipients who are unable to remain in the community \ndue to Defendants’ reduction in LT-PCS services can enter a nursing facility and, after 90 days, \nwill be placed in a “priority” status to expedite receipt of services through the EDA waiver \nprogram. (See Defs.’ Reply at 19-21.)  They thus dispute that “temporary institutional \nplacements” are discriminatory.  (Id.; Defs.’ Mem. at 20.)  But even policies that risk temporary \ninstitutionalization are discriminatory under the ADA.  See, e.g., Marlo M. v. Cansler, 679 F. \nSupp. 2d 635, 638 (E.D.N.C. 2010) (granting preliminary injunction where evidence \ndemonstrated that plaintiffs would suffer regressive consequences if “even temporarily” \nreturning to an institutional setting); Cruz v. Dudek, No. 10-23048, 2010 WL 4284955, at *3-7 \n(S.D. Fla. Oct 12, 2010) (granting preliminary injunction where state’s denial of community-\nbased services placed plaintiffs at risk of institutionalization and state had proposed entry into \nnursing home for sixty days prior to providing community-based services) (Order adopting \nMagistrate’s Report and Recommendation, Nov. 24, 2010, attached as Exhibit A); Haddad v. \nArnold, No. 3:10-00414 (M.D. Fla. July 9, 2010) (granting preliminary injunction after finding \nthat the plaintiff would suffer irreparable injury if forced to enter a nursing home) (Attached as \nExhibit B).  Just as long-term isolation and segregation in an institutional setting deprives an \nindividual of his or her freedom to interact with others in the community, temporary unjustified \ninstitutionalization similarly disrupts the individual’s established life in the community, placing \nat risk the individual’s psychological, emotional, and physical wellbeing.   \n  Thus, the ADA requires a state to reasonably modify policies to avoid placing individuals \nwith disabilities at risk of even temporary institutionalization. \n1 2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 12 of 23\n\n \n2.  Plaintiffs have submitted evidence of key issues of disputed material fact as to \nwhether Defendants’ reduction in available LT-PCS hours will place Plaintiffs and \nothers similarly situated at risk of institutionalization \n \nDefendants’ alteration to the LT-PCS program lowers the maximum number of weekly \navailable hours from 42 to 32.  36 La. Reg. 1752 (Aug. 2010).  Plaintiffs each currently receive \n39 or more hours of LT-PCS services per week and therefore their services will be reduced upon \ntheir yearly reassessment.  (Pitts Decl. ¶ 15, 22; Roman Decl. ¶¶ 19-20; Hodges Decl. ¶¶ 15-16; \nAiney Decl. ¶¶ 27-28; Lancaster Decl. ¶ 13.)  Because of their disabilities, Plaintiffs rely on \nthese services for medically necessary assistance with activities such as eating, bathing, \ngrooming, toileting, transferring to and from bed, and cleaning after incontinence episodes. (See \nPitts Decl. ¶¶ 24, 28; Roman Decl. ¶¶ 15, 18; Ex. 10 to Pls.’ Mem., Oct. 18, 2010 Letter from \nAlireza Minagar, M.D., (“Minagar Letter”) at 1; Ainey Decl. ¶ 5; Lancaster Decl. ¶¶ 17, 20.) \nPlaintiffs have submitted substantial evidence demonstrating disputed issues of material \nfact regarding the effect of Defendants’ reduction in LT-PCS services.  Each of the Plaintiffs’ \ntreating physicians asserts that decreasing the availability of weekly personal care hours would \nplace Plaintiffs at risk of deteriorating health conditions, increasingly frequent hospital and \nemergency room visits, and ultimately, institutional care.  (See Ward Decl. ¶¶ 9, 11-15; Whitney \nDecl. ¶¶ 8, 11, 13; Minagar letter at 2; Ancira Decl. ¶¶ 9-10; Lafleur Decl. ¶¶ 15, 17.)  The \ndeclaration of Mitchell LaPlante, PhD, a nationally-recognized expert in personal assistance \nneeds of persons with disabilities, supports the assessments of Plaintiffs’ treating physicians.  \n(See Ex. 24 to Pls.’ Mem, Declaration of Mitchell LaPlante, PhD (“LaPlante Decl.”) ¶¶ 1-7.)  Dr. \nLaPlante attests that going without adequate levels of assistance compromises the safety, \ncomfort, and hygiene of persons requiring help with ADLs and IADLs, which “reduc[es] their \n1 3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 13 of 23\n\nability to live independently and increas[es] their risk of institutionalization and death.” \n(LaPlante Decl. ¶ 9-10.)  Based on his review of Louisiana’s reduction of the available maximum \nnumber of hours in its LT-PCS program, he opines that the reduction is “of sufficient magnitude \nthat it is likely to create unmet needs,” which will “increase institutionalization and other health \ncare costs, including hospitalization costs, resulting from treating these unmet needs.”  (Id. ¶ 23.) \nPlaintiffs have thus submitted substantial evidence of disputed facts as to whether \nDefendants’ reduction in available LT-PCS services, which is without any exceptions process, \nthreatens to place Plaintiffs and others similarly situated at risk of institutionalization. \nDefendants do not squarely dispute that Plaintiffs will be placed at risk, but rather strain logic to \nassert that, because a previous reduction in available hours from 56 to 42 hours per week did not \nlead to an overall increased rate of entry into nursing facilities, there is no reason to believe that \nthe instant reduction will place those individuals whose services are reduced at risk of \ninstitutionalization.  (See Defs.’ Mem. at 8-9; Eley Decl. ¶ 40; Defs.’ Reply at 10-11.)  Unlike in \nthe first service reduction, in which only 941 individuals were affected, the instant reduction \nallegedly will affect over 4,000 individuals.  (Eley Decl. ¶ 37.)  Defendants assert that from \nSeptember to December of last year, only 512 of the affected individuals have had their services \nreduced.  (Defs.’ Reply at 11.)  Defendants assert that during the same period, the overall rate of \ninstitutionalization among LT-PCS recipients was 2%, but they decline to offer the rate of \ninstitutionalization for the 512 impacted individuals.  (See Id.)  As discussed above, Plaintiffs \nhave submitted ample evidence, including the assessments of their treating physicians and \ndeclarations of experts who specialize in meeting personal assistance needs of individuals with \ndisabilities, suggesting that many individuals subject to the instant reductions in LT-PCS \n1 4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 14 of 23\n\nservices will be placed at risk of institutionalization.  There thus remain issues of material fact in \ndispute as to the potential impact of Defendants’ reduction in LT-PCS services. \n3.  Disputed issues of fact exist as to Defendants’ efforts to make available alternative \nservices to prevent Plaintiffs from being placed at risk of institutionalization after \nDefendants’ reduction in LT-PCS services takes effect \n \n  Defendants suggest that alternative, “more appropriate” services are available if LT-PCS \nservices are inadequate to meet the Plaintiffs’ needs.  (See Defs.’ Mem. at 21; Eley Decl. ¶ 35).  \nThe Plaintiffs have submitted evidence disputing the assertion that services will, in fact, be \navailable for each of the Plaintiffs and proposed class members to prevent them from being \ninstitutionalized.  For example, among Defendants’ other HCBS programs, each has a set cap on \nthe number of enrolled individuals and a substantial waiting list. See supra at 6, n. 6.  The EDA \nwaiver program has identified “priority” groups for whom services may be made available on an \nexpedited basis, but priority status is limited to individuals who are victims of abuse and neglect \nand those who enter a nursing facility and remain there for at least 90 days.  (Id.) see also 36 La. \nReg. at 2218 (establishing 90-day length-of-stay requirement to meet “priority” criteria for EDA \nwaiver program).  As of January 2011, for individuals who do not meet the State’s criteria for \nthese priority groups, the waiting period to become enrolled in the EDA waiver program was \nover three years.  (See Eley Dep., p. 78, ll. 7-19.)  Should Plaintiffs wish to avail themselves of \n“priority” status, they would have to enter a nursing facility and remain there for, at a minimum, \n90 consecutive days. (See id. p. 78, l. 7 – p. 79, l. 5.)  As noted above, courts have considered the \nrisk of even temporary institutionalization to be discriminatory under the ADA.  See Marlo M., \n679 F. Supp. 2d at 638; Cruz, No. 10-23048, 2010 WL 4284955, at *3-7; Haddad, No. 3:10-\n00414 (M.D. Fla. July 9, 2010).  Moreover, Defendants’ ADHC waiver program and the PACE \nprogram, in addition to being capped in size, limit enrollment to individuals within a geographic \n1 5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 15 of 23\n\narea served by the programs.12  (Eley Decl. ¶¶ 22, 25, 27.) Defendants have established no \nsafeguards or put plans in place to transition individuals to other programs to ensure that the \nreductions at issue here do not place individuals at risk of institutionalization.  (See Defs.’ Mem. \nat 21.)  And the Defendants have announced no plans to increase the size of these programs as \nthe reductions at issue take effect.13   \n  In Brantley, a court rejected vague assurances, similar to those of the Defendant here, \nmade in rebuttal to the plaintiffs’ evidence that a reduction in adult day services would place \nindividuals at risk of institutionalization:   \n[T]he Court is persuaded by Plaintiffs’ concern that Defendants have failed to \nimplement any means of ensuring that, if and when the cuts take effect, the \nnecessary alternative services will be identified and in place . . . .  \n. . . \n[Defendants]  have  taken  an  arguably  cavalier  approach  to  ensuring  their \ncontinuing compliance with the ADA . . . . Defendants refuse to specify how they \nwill ensure their continuing compliance with the ADA . . . in the event that the \nADHC programs fail to comply with their “expectation” to secure alternative \nservices  for  their  participants.  . . . D efendants  certainly  bear  the  burden  of \nensuring more than a “theoretical” availability of services. \n \n656 F. Supp. 2d at 1174; see also Ball v. Rodgers, No. 00-cv-67, 2009 WL 1395423, at *5 (D. \nAriz. Apr. 24, 2009) (holding that defendants violated title II’s integration mandate by “fail[ing] \n                                                 \n12 Defendants argue that all but one of the Plaintiffs are eligible for and reside within the service area covered by the \nADHC waiver program.  (See Defs.’ Reply at 17-18.)  Even assuming these individuals would be able to avail \nthemselves of Defendants’ ADHC services before being institutionalized, the remaining Plaintiff, Kenneth Roman, \nand presumably numerous class members, reside outside the geographic area served by ADHC-centers.  The \navailability of the ADHC waiver program or other alternative services are disputed facts material to whether \nPlaintiffs are being placed at risk of institutionalization, thus this issue is inappropriate for disposition at the \nsummary judgment stage. \n \n13 Defendants point to two proposed, but not yet approved, waiver programs.  (Defs.’ Mem. at 10-11.)  One \nproposed waiver is designed to entirely supplant the existing EDA waiver and will offer several additional services, \nbut will not add any slots to provide services to additional individuals.  (Eley Dep., p. 117, ll. 4-16.)  The other \nprogram, the proposed Adult Residential Care waiver, will add 200 slots of HCBS services to the State’s system, but \nit has not yet been approved by CMS.  (Eley Dep., p. 92, ll. 1-3.)  Pursuant to Defendants’ regulations, the ARC \nwaiver program will provide reimbursement for 24-hour supervision in a DHHS-licensed facility.  See 50 La. \nAdmin. Code §§ 30101-30907.  Participants in the ARC waiver program will not be able to remain in their own \nhomes, as participants of the LT-PCS program are able to do.  Id.  The extent to which either of these programs may \nalleviate the Plaintiffs’ alleged risk of institutionalization is thus a disputed issue of fact and improper for disposition \nat the summary judgment stage. \n1 6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 16 of 23\n\nto provide adequate services to avoid unnecessary gaps in service and [because the] \ninstitutionalization was discriminatory”); Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1181-84; Frederick L. v. Dep’t of \nPub. Welfare of Pa., 364 F.3d 487, 500 (3d Cir. 2004) (“[The State] must be prepared to make a \ncommitment to action in a manner for which it can be held accountable by the courts.”).    \nB.  Defendants Have Not Established that the Plaintiffs’ Requested Modification \nis a Fundamental Alteration of their Programs \n \n  Defendants have the burden of proving that Plaintiffs’ requested reasonable modifications \nwould constitute a fundamental alteration of the State’s services.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603-04.  \nPlaintiffs’ requested modification to Defendants’ LT-PCS program is simple: that each of the \nPlaintiffs and members of the proposed Plaintiff class retain their existing level of service in the \nLT-PCS program, and to allow new enrollees to exceed the 32-hour cap (up to 42 hours), to the \nextent that the receipt of that level of service is necessary to prevent their institutionalization.14  \n(See Pls.’ Mem. at 31.)   \nAs their primary fundamental alteration defense, Defendants assert that they entirely \navoid the ADA’s obligation to reasonably modify the State’s programs to avoid discrimination \nbecause they allegedly have a comprehensive, effectively working plan to address unnecessary \ninstitutionalization. (See Defs.’ Mem. at 2; 17-18.)  In support of their argument, Defendants \npoint to home and community-based programs that the State offers other than the LT-PCS \nprogram.  (See Defs.’ Mem. at 2; 17-18.)  The existence of these other programs, they incorrectly \ncontend, permits them to adopt policies that will place Plaintiffs at risk of institutionalization. \n                                                 \n14 Defendants selectively quote Plaintiffs to assert that Plaintiffs “have not consistently articulated” the modification \nthey seek. (See Defs.’ Reply at 22-23.)  Their request, however, is merely to ensure that, subject to the prior \nmaximum of 42 hours per week, current and prospective recipients of LT-PCS services are able to receive the lelvel \nof service necessary to remain in the community.  (Pls.’ Mem. at 31.)  Defendants misread Plaintiffs’ class definition \nwhen they suggest that Plaintiffs’ requested modification would allow the cap to be applied, without an exceptions \nprocess, to new enrollees.  (See Compl. ¶ 97 (defining proposed class as “current and prospective recipients of \nMedicaid-funded services through the LT-PCS program… who are at risk of being forced to enter a nursing home \nbecause Defendants plan to reduce the level of community-based services.”).) \n1 7 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 17 of 23\n\n(Id. at 17-18, 20.)  This is both a fundamental misreading of the obligations imposed by the ADA \nand a mischaracterization of the fundamental alteration defense.     \n  The Court in Olmstead suggested that where a state has clearly demonstrated that it has in \nplace a “comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with . . . \ndisabilities in less restrictive settings, and a wait list that move[s] at a reasonable pace not \ncontrolled by the State’s endeavors to keep its institutions fully populated” a federal court may \nhave no basis to order displacement of institutionalized persons at the top of a state’s waiting list \nfor community-based services. Id. at 605-06; see also Frederick L. v. Department of Public \nWelfare of Pa. (“Frederick L. II.”), 422 F.3d 151, 157-59 (3d Cir. 2005); Sanchez v. Johnson, \n416 F.3d 1051, 1063 (9th Cir. 2005); ARC of Washington, 427 F.3d at 619.15 \n   The logic underpinning the comprehensive, effectively working plan defense is clear: a \nfederal court should not force a state to immediately expand services, or to permit individuals to \nreceive priority in deinstitutionalization or the receipt of community-based services because \nthose individuals “commenced civil actions,” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 604, when, in light of its \nobligations to all disabled individuals, the State can establish that it has a comprehensive, \neffectively working plan to address its unnecessary reliance on institutional care.   However, that \nlogic fails where, as here, a State seeks to reduce or eliminate services already in existence, and \nupon which Plaintiffs depend to prevent their institutionalization.  Indeed, it is difficult to \n                                                 \n \n15 Courts have strictly interpreted the requirement that a state demonstrate it has in place a comprehensive, \neffectively working plan in offering an alleged fundamental alteration defense.  See, e.g., Pennsylvania Prot. & \nAdvocacy, Inc. v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 402 F.3d 374, 381 (3d Cir. 2005) (requiring the state to demonstrate the \nexistence of a plan before it may even raise a fundamental alteration defense); Frederick L. II, 422 F.3d at 157-59 \n(vacating district court ruling in favor of state defendants where fundamental alteration defense was premised on \n“vague assurance of future deinstitutionalization” rather than a meaningful commitment with measurable goals for \ncommunity integration);  Disability Advocates, Inc. v. Paterson, 653 F. Supp. 2d 184, 271 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) \n(rejecting state’s fundamental alteration defense where it does not “have a comprehensive or effective plan to enable \n[segregated] residents to receive services in more integrated settings, but instead was committed to maintaining the \nstatus quo) appeal docketed, No. 10-235-cv (L) (2d Cir. Jan. 20, 2010). \n \n1 8 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 18 of 23\n\nimagine any scenario where placing individuals at risk of institutionalization by reducing their \nservices could properly be considered part of a state’s comprehensive, effectively working \nOlmstead plan.  If anything, the State undermines its own purported Olmstead plan by reducing \nthe very services that maintain the Plaintiffs in the community.   \n  The only Circuit Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue of what constitutes a \ncomprehensive, effectively working plan have done so in the context of  requests to expand \nexisting services for the purpose of either preventing plaintiffs’ institutionalization or  expediting \ntheir transition out of a facility (as was the case of the Olmstead plaintiffs).  See, e.g., Sanchez v. \nJohnson, 416 F.3d 1051, 1063 (9th Cir. 2005) (request to enhance reimbursement rates to \ncommunity-based providers); ARC of Washington, 427 F.3d at 619 (request for expansion of \nexisting HCBS waiver); Frederick L. II., 422 F.3d 151, (requested expansion of services to \nexpedite deinstitutionalization).  By contrast, Plaintiffs here do not seek to expand the number of \nHCBS programs that the State offers, or the number of slots in these programs.  Rather, in the \nface of Defendants’ plan to drastically reduce the scope of one of the State’s core HCBS \nservices, Plaintiffs seek only to ensure that the State does not alter its LT-PCS program in a \nmanner that places them at risk of institutionalization.  \n  Even if this Court were to hold that a fundamental alteration defense based upon a \ncomprehensive, effectively working plan is a defense that can be properly raised in this case, the \nPlaintiffs have put forward substantial evidence disputing Defendants’ assertion that the State’s \nalleged plan for deinstitutionalization is actually “comprehensive” and “effectively working” and \nhave raised a number of factual issues that contest Defendants’ asserted fundamental alteration \ndefense.  (See Pls.’ Mem. at 34-37; Pls.’ Mem. at 38; Pls.’ Separate Statement of Disputed Issues \n1 9 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 19 of 23\n\nof Fact ¶¶ 5-7.)  Accordingly, these issues are inappropriate for disposition at the summary \njudgment stage. \nC.  Because the Integration Regulation Reasonably Interprets Title II of the \nADA, It Is Enforceable Through Private Right of Action to Enforce the \nStatute \n \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs have no right of action to enforce the integration mandate \nbecause that mandate is codified in regulations implementing title II of the ADA.  (See Defs.’ \nRepl. Br. at 34-35.)16  This argument misunderstands the nature of regulations such as those \nimplementing title II.  The Supreme Court in Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 285 (2001), \nheld that regulations that implement a statutory prohibition are “covered by the cause of action to \nenforce that [statutory] section.”17  As the Court explained: \nSuch  regulations,  if  valid  and  reasonable,  authoritatively  construe  the  statute \nitself, and it is therefore meaningless to talk about a separate cause of action to \nenforce the regulations apart from the statute.  A Congress that intends the statute \nto  be  enforced  through  a  private  cause  of  action  intends  the  authoritative \ninterpretation of the statute to be so enforced as well. \n \n532 U.S. at 284 (citations omitted); see also S.D. ex rel. Dickson v. Hood, 391 F.3d 581, 607 (5th \nCir. 2004); Ability Center of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 905-913 (6th Cir. \n2004).  Thus, if the regulations implementing title II – including the integration mandate – are \nvalid and reasonable, they are enforceable to the same extent as the statute itself. \nAs outlined above, pp. 3-5, Congress directed the Attorney General to issue regulations \nimplementing title II, 42 U.S.C. § 12134; consistent with the goals of eliminating the forms of \ndiscrimination identified by Congress, the Attorney General has done so.  See 28 C.F.R. Part 35.  \n                                                 \n16 Defendants have not challenged the enforceability of title II itself; it is well established that title II is enforceable \nthrough a private right of action.  Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 185 (2002).   \n \n17 The holding in Sandoval was that the disparate impact regulations promulgated under Title VI of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq. may not be enforced through the private right of action to enforce the statute, \nbecause those regulations did not apply the statute’s ban on intentional discrimination.  532 U.S. at 284-85.  That \nconclusion does not apply to title II’s integration regulation because that regulation directly applies the statute’s ban \non discrimination, for the reasons expressed in the text of this brief. \n2 0 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 20 of 23\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that where “Congress explicitly delegated authority to construe the \nstatute by regulation,” courts “must give the regulations legislative and hence controlling weight \nunless they are arbitrary, capricious, or plainly contrary to the statute.”  United States v. Morton, \n467 U.S. 822, 834 (1984); see also NationsBank of North Carolina, N.A. v. Variable Annuity Life \nIns. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 256-57 (1995).  In Olmstead, the Supreme Court noted that, “[b]ecause \nthe Department [of Justice] is the agency directed by Congress to issue regulations implementing \nTitle II, its views warrant respect.” 527 U.S. at 597-98 (internal citations omitted).  The title II \nregulations, the Court acknowledged, “constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to \nwhich courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.”  Id. at 598. \nOn its face, the integration regulation, 28 C.F.R. §35.130(d), is a reasonable \nimplementation of title II.  It is clear from the text of the ADA that Congress intended its \nprohibition on disability-based discrimination to encompass a prohibition on the isolation and \nsegregation of individuals with disabilities.  In the “Findings” section of the statute, Congress \ndefines the “forms of discrimination” it seeks to eliminate as including “isolat[ion]” and \n“segregation.” 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101(a)(2), (a)(5).  Indeed, the Supreme Court in Olmstead relied \nin part on these very findings, holding that prohibiting “unjustified isolation” is “properly \nregarded” as part of prohibiting “discrimination based on disability.”  527 U.S. at 597, 600.  \nBecause the integration mandate directly implements Congress’ prohibition on this type of \ndiscrimination, it is a valid construction of title II and may be enforced by a private right of \naction to enforce title II.  Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 331-33 (3d Cir. 1995); see also Arc \nof Washington, 427 F.3d at 618 (finding that Title II’s integration mandate “serves one of the \nprincipal purposes of Title II of the ADA: ending the isolation and segregation of disabled \npersons”); Townsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511, 516 (9th Cir. 2003) (“The Department of \n2 1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 42     04/07/11   Page 21 of 23\n\nJustice’s integration regulation implements the isolation and segregation concerns that, in part, \nunderlie Title II.”) \nThus, Plaintiffs have properly asserted a cause of action, relying on the ADA’s broad \nprohibition of discrimination, authoritatively interpreted by the Attorney General’s integration \nregulation, 28 U.S.C. § 35.130(d), and by the Supreme Court in Olmstead.  527 U.S. at 607.  The \ndiscrimination contemplated by Congress in enacting title II, and recognized in Olmstead—\nunnecessarily relegating individuals with disabilities to segregated facilities—is exactly what \nPlaintiffs face if they are placed at risk of unnecessary institutionalization by Defendants’ \nreduction in services in the LT-PCS program.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny Defendants’ converted Motion for \nSummary Judgment. \n \nDated: April 7, 2011 \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, by \n               \nDONALD J.

This civil rights action seeks to prevent nearly 11,000 low-income people with \nsevere disabilities from losing services that they have been receiving to live in the \ncommunity and to prevent them from being institutionalized in nursing facilities.  \nDefendants have assessed each of these people, have determined that each meets the \nLouisiana nursing facility level of care, and have identified their specific needs for \nsupport to conduct their activities of daily living in the community.    \n2.   Plaintiffs Helen Pitts, 78, Kenneth Roman, 47, Denise Hodges, 53, and Rickii \nAiney, 30, have severe disabilities and multiple chronic conditions, including paralyses, \nstrokes, chronic heart failures, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, as well as other impairments as \nenumerated below.   \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 1 of 25\n\n \n3.  The Plaintiffs all require assistance with activities of daily living, including but \nnot limited to assistance with bathing, dressing, toileting, eating, bowel and bladder care, \nmeal preparation and clean up, shopping, and laundry, and have been receiving such \nassistance in their homes as part of Defendants’ Medicaid-funded Long Term-Personal \nCare Services Program (“LT-PCS”).  Plaintiffs are active in their communities.   \n4.  The named and class Plaintiffs are all low-income and are recipients of Medicaid-\nfunded services, including those services that they currently receive in the community \nand whose reductions are the subject of their lawsuit.   \n5.  None of them wants to leave their homes, friends, and families and to go into a \nnursing home in order to receive the same Medicaid-funded services that they presently \nreceive in the community.  They are all at risk of institutionalization if their Long Term-\nPersonal Care Services are reduced and capped as defendants propose.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This action for declaratory and injunctive relief arises under Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (“ADA”); the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C.  § 794(a) (“Section 504”); the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§1396a(a)(3); 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.  \n7.  The Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343(a)(3) and (4).  Declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \nand 2202 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.  Plaintiffs’ causes of action for disability discrimination \nare authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 12133 and 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).   \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 2 of 25\n\n \n8.  Venue is proper because a substantial part of the actions and omissions of which \nPlaintiffs allege occurred in this District.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \nPLAINTIFFS \n \n9.  Helen Pitts is a 78 year old resident of Denham Springs, Louisiana.  She is a \nrecipient of Medicaid benefits from the State of Louisiana. She has a disability as defined \nin § 12102(2)(A) of the ADA and a “handicap” as defined in Section 504. \n10.  Kenneth Roman is a 47 year old resident of Jeanerette, Louisiana.  He is a \nrecipient of Medicaid benefits from the State of Louisiana. He has a disability as defined \nin § 12102(2)(A) of the ADA and a “handicap” as defined in Section 504. \n11.  Denise Hodges is a 53 year old resident of Bossier City, Louisiana.  She is a \nrecipient of Medicaid benefits from the State of Louisiana. She has a disability as defined \nin § 12102(2)(A) of the ADA and a “handicap” as defined in Section 504. \n12.  Rickii Ainey is a 30 year old resident of New Orleans, Louisiana.  She is a \nrecipient of Medicaid benefits from the State of Louisiana. She has a disability as defined \nin § 12102(2)(A) of the ADA and a “handicap” as defined in Section 504. \nDEFENDANTS \n \n13.  Bruce Greenstein is the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and \nHospitals (“DHH”). He is sued in his official capacity.  The Secretary of DHH is \nresponsible for the oversight, supervision and control of the DHH and its divisions, and is \nultimately responsible for ensuring that the DHH’s services for people with disabilities \nare provided in conformance with federal laws, including the ADA and Section 504, as \nwell as Medicaid. \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 3 of 25\n\n \n14.  DHH is the chief health policy and planning entity for the state.  It receives \nfederal financial assistance and is responsible for administering Louisiana’s Medicaid \nProgram. DHH is the “single state agency” that operates Louisiana’s Medicaid program, \nsee 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5). It licenses, certifies, and approves Medicaid payments to \nLouisiana’s Medicaid nursing homes, and administers its home- and community-based \nprograms, including the Elderly and Disabled Adult Waiver and Long-Term Personal \nCare Services programs for people with disabilities. \nTHE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \n15.     Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides that “no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.   \n16.      Under the ADA, institutionalization and segregation are prohibited forms of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities, 42 U.S.C. §12101(a)(3) and (5). The \nADA therefore requires that a public entity administer its services, programs and \nactivities in “the most integrated setting appropriate” to the needs of qualified individuals \nwith disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n17.     The ADA prohibits “exclusionary qualifications standards and criteria” and \n“relegation to lesser services, programs, … benefits, or other opportunities,”  42 U.S.C. \n§12101(a)(5), and therefore the regulations implementing Title II provide that “a public \nentity may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or \nother methods of administration:  (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified \nindividuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability; [or] (ii) that have \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 4 of 25\n\n \nthe purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the \nobjectives of the entity’s program with respect to individuals with disabilities....”  28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3). \n18.    Defendant DHH is a public entity under Title II of the ADA and its \nimplementing regulations. \nSECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT \n19.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §794a, provides:  \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States .., \nshall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from participation \nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance….      \n \n20.  Regulations implementing Section 504 require a recipient of federal financial \nassistance to administer its services, programs, and activities in “the most integrated \nsetting appropriate” to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.  28 C.F.R. \n§41.51(d). \n21.     Regulations implementing Section 504 prohibit recipients of Federal financial \nassistance from: \n[u]tiliz[ing] criteria or methods of administration... (i) [t]hat have the effect of \nsubjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of \nhandicap [or] (ii) [t]hat have the...effect of defeating or substantially impairing \naccomplishment of the objectives of the recipient’s program with respect to \nhandicapped persons.  45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(i) and \n(ii). \n \n22.      Defendants’ Medicaid program receives Federal financial assistance and must \ncomply with Section 504 and its implementing regulations.  Federal Medicaid funds \nmake up 81.48% of Louisiana Medicaid payments, including LT-PCS. \n \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 5 of 25\n\n \nTHE LONG TERM PERSONAL SERVICES PROGRAM \n23.  The Medicaid program, authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 \nU.S.C. §1396 et seq., is a joint federal-state program.  Medicaid is a cost-sharing \narrangement under which the federal government reimburses a portion of the \nexpenditures incurred by states that elect to furnish medical assistance to individuals \nwhose income and resources are insufficient to cover the costs of their medical care. The \npurpose of Medicaid is to furnish, as far as practicable, “medical assistance on behalf \nof...aged, blind or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to \nmeet the costs of necessary medical services” and “to help such families and individuals \nto attain or retain capability for independence or self-care....”  42 U.S.C. § 1396.  \n24.  States are not required to participate in the Medicaid program, but, if they choose \nto do so, they must operate their programs within federal statutory and regulatory \nprovisions. They must adopt a State Plan that delineates the standards for determining \neligibility and identifies the extent of Medicaid benefits.  Louisiana has chosen to \nparticipate in the Medicaid program and has adopted a State Plan. \n25.  The Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services \nadministers the Medicaid program at the federal level through the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services (“CMS”), which has urged states pursuant to the ADA to avoid \nunnecessary institutionalization of person with disabilities in nursing facilities. \n26.  One of the programs available through Louisiana’s State Medicaid Plan is LT-\nPCS. The Medicaid Act authorizes states to provide attendant care services under the \nfederal Personal Care Option, 42 U.S.C. §1396d(a)(24).   \n  6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 6 of 25\n\n \n27.  The services of a personal care worker include assistance with basic personal \ncare, toileting and grooming activities; assistance with bladder and/or bowel requirements \nor problems; assistance with eating and food preparation; performance of incidental \nhousehold chores; accompanying to medical appointments; and grocery shopping. \nPersonal care services are normally provided in the recipient's home, though they can be \ndelivered in another location outside of the recipient's home if the provision of these \nservices allows the recipient to participate in community activities.  \n28.  To qualify for LT-PCS in Louisiana, a person must meet the requirements for a \nnursing facility level of care, and must also meet one of the following eligibility criteria: \n(1) be residing in a nursing facility and could be discharged if community-based services \nwere available; (2) be likely to require nursing facility admission within the next 120 \ndays; (3) have a primary care-giver who has a disability or is over the age of 70; or (4) \nface a substantial possibility of deterioration in mental or physical condition or \nfunctioning if either home and community-based services or nursing facility services are \nnot provided in less than 120 days. Louisiana Administrative Code 50:XV.Chapter 129, \n§12505(A); Louisiana Register V. 29 No. 6 (June 20, 2003) pp. 911-13. \n29.  LT-PCS must be prior authorized by DHH after an annual assessment to ensure \nthe person continues to meet eligibility criteria. As a person’s needs change, the amount \nof LT-PCS services he or she receives in the community can change accordingly.  \n30.  Defendants’ annual review of each LT-PCS recipient determines the specific \namount of services in hours that the person requires.  \n31.  Since the inception of the LT-PCS program in 2003, DHH has used an assessment \ntool called the Minimum Data Set-Home Care (“MDS-HC”) to assess the need for LT-\n  7 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 7 of 25\n\n \nPCS.  Until March 1, 2009, the maximum amount of LT-PCS that a person could receive \nwas 56 hours per week. The actual allocation of service hours was based on the person’s \nlevel of need for assistance on each of seven activities of daily living or “ADL’s” (bed \nmobility, transferring, locomotion (in and out of the home), dressing (upper and lower \nbody), eating, toileting, personal hygiene and bathing) and eight “instrumental activities \nof daily living” or “IADL’s” (meal preparation, ordinary housework, managing finances, \nmanaging medication, phone use, shopping and transportation).  \n32.  Beginning March 1, 2009, DHH, while it continued to use the MDS-HC, began \nusing a different scoring system called the “RUG III/HC” to assign LT-PCS recipients a \nmaximum number of hours of LT-PCS.  The maximum number of hours that any LT-\nPCS recipient could receive was reduced from 56 to 42 hours per week. \n33.  In August 2010, DHH announced that it was again changing the method of \ndeciding the number of hours allocated and reducing the maximum number of hours of \nLT-PCS service that recipients could receive, from 42 to 32 hours a week. \n34.  DHH has announced that the number of hours that an individual can receive will \nbe based on the individual’s score using an “ADL index.” The “ADL index” is a \ncomposite of scores as to how much assistance individuals need with only four activities \nof daily living:  eating, toileting, transferring, and moving around in bed. The maximum \nnumber of LT-PCS hours that an LT-PCS recipient will be able to receive varies with the \nperson’s score on the ADL index, from a low of 18 hours to a high of 32 hours, \nregardless of a person’s actual need for more hours. \n35.  Nationally, the mean number of hours of personal assistance services that persons \nwho require assistance for four ADLs receive per week is 85.9 hours, and the mean \n  8 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 8 of 25\n\n \nnumber of hours persons who require assistance for five ADLs receive per week is 118.5 \nhours. \n36.  The reduction in maximum hours that Defendants are imposing on the LT-PCS \nprogram will be implemented for assessments of new LT-PCS recipients and for the \nannual reassessments of current recipients that take place after September 5, 2010. \n37.  The reduction in maximum hours that Defendants are imposing on the LT-PCS \nprogram is being imposed for purely budgetary reasons and is not based on the needs of \nthe persons who have been receiving LT-PCS services.  \n38.  This budgetary reduction will deprive LT-PCS recipients of critical services that \nhave previously been found necessary to permit these individuals to remain safely in their \nhomes.  At the present time, Plaintiff Helen Pitts has been approved to receive 39 hours a \nweek of LT-PCS, Kenneth Roman 39 hours a week, Denise Hodges 39 hours a week and \nRickii Ainey 41 hours of LT-PCS a week, the minimal number of hours Defendants had \ndetermined that each Plaintiff requires. \n39.  The reduction in LT-PCS hours violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 12132 (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § \n794(a) (“Section 504”), and the federal regulations implementing these statutes, by \nplacing LT-PCS recipients at risk of unnecessary institutionalization in nursing homes.   \nDUE PROCESS AND MEDICAID STATUTE VIOLATIONS \n40.      Under the Medicaid Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, Defendants’ notice of termination or reduction of Medicaid benefits must \nprovide adequate and meaningful information so that a recipient can determine whether \nor not the proposed reduction was properly done. \n  9 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 9 of 25\n\n \n41.  Based on information and belief, the notices that DHH will send to recipients \nupon initial assessment, or following their annual assessments, after September 5, 2010, \nwill not give the factual basis of the Department’s decision as to how many hours of LT-\nPCS they are approved to receive in terms that are understandable to the recipient. The \nnotices will be inadequate to explain to recipients the basis of the Department’s decision, \nor to assist recipients in deciding whether to appeal and how to challenge the \nDepartment’s decision if they should decide to appeal.  \n42.  The reduction of services to Plaintiffs and similarly-situated class members based \non such notices violates the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(3), 42 C.F.R. §431.200 et \nseq.; the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution; and 42 U.S.C. §1983.  Plaintiffs seek to enjoin DHH from reducing long-\nterm care services to them and to others who are similarly situated without first giving \nthem a meaningful opportunity to understand, review, and, where appropriate, challenge \nthe Department's action. \nNAMED PLAINTIFFS’ NEEDS FOR PERSONAL CARE \nHelen Pitts \n43.     Helen Pitts is 78 years old. She lives in Denham Springs, Louisiana, and has \nlived in the Baton Rouge area since 1979.  She raised three children and worked as a \nsales clerk and as a sitter for people who were ill before she retired at the age of 65 and \nbegan taking care of her elderly parents.  She is divorced and lives alone. \n44.     Ms. Pitts has had osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and congestive \nheart failure since the early 1980’s.  She was diagnosed with lymphedema two to three \nyears ago. Approximately two years ago, she had two cancerous tumors removed from \n  10 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 10 of 25\n\n \nher leg. She requires the use of oxygen daily and at night.  She is in constant pain in her \nlegs, arms, shoulders and back as a result of the fibromyalgia and lymphedema.   \n45.  Ms. Pitts is eligible for and receives Medicaid.  Her sole source of income is $519 \nper month from Supplemental Security Income and $175 per month in Social Security \nretirement benefits. \n46.  LT-PCS services are essential to keep Ms. Pitts healthy, to enable her to live in \nthe community and to avoid her having to enter a nursing facility.  Ms. Pitts needs \nassistance getting in and out of bed and getting in and out of her motorized scooter, \nwhich she requires for ambulation.  She needs help going to the bathroom because she \ncannot get on and off the toilet without help, needs help pulling her clothes up and down, \nand needs help cleaning herself (in part to avoid decubitus ulcers).  She has incontinent \nepisodes daily. She needs help bathing, dressing and performing most of her personal \nhygiene.   \n47.     Because of the pain and her lack of mobility, Ms. Pitts is unable to prepare \nmeals, do her laundry or attend to household chores. \n48.   Ms. Pitts must use a motorized scooter to independently ambulate, and she uses a \nwalker to walk very short distances such as from her bed to the bathroom. \n49.     Because of her health issues, she must visit her doctor regularly.  She needs her \nLT-PCS personal assistant to not only help her prepare to go to the doctor, but also to \nbring her to the doctor.  Because she is often at the doctor’s office for a couple of hours, \nshe is exhausted afterwards and requires help with a meal and undressing.   \n50.  At Ms. Pitts most recent reassessment, she was allocated 39 hours of LT-PCS per \nweek.   \n  11 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 11 of 25\n\n \n51.  Prior to the most recent reassessment, Ms. Pitts lacked sufficient LT-PCS and her \nhealth declined significantly. There were days when she could not eat because she did not \nhave the strength to make a sandwich, much less prepare a meal.  She could not get to the \ngrocery for food and had to depend on sporadic assistance from neighbors and from her \nelderly brother. She was hospitalized several times. \n52.   Since October, 2009, Ms. Pitts has received 39 hours per week of LT-PCS.  This \nhas made a great difference in her health.  \n53.  Even with the present 39 hours per week of LT-PCS, there are tasks that at times \nare not accomplished or completed in a timely manner.  Ms. Pitts’ physical care takes so \nmuch time that sometimes personal care assistant cannot do the household chores, such as \nlaundry or shopping. \n54.     Ms. Pitts’ brother is 81 years old and her only local relative and support.  Due to \nhis own health problems, he cannot provide his sister with any physical assistance. \n55.   Ms. Pitts wants to stay in her own home and continue receiving the support that \nshe needs.  She does not want to go into a nursing home. \nKenneth Roman  \n56.    Plaintiff Kenneth Roman is 47 years old and has lived in Jeanerette, Louisiana \nfor most of his life. He worked as a hairdresser and as a cook until 2002, when his health \nproblems forced him to retire. \n57.  Mr. Roman was determined eligible for Social Security Disability benefits in \n2002.  He $52 per month in Social Security Disability Insurance and $640 per month in \nSupplemental Security Income. \n  12 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 12 of 25\n\n \n58.    Kenneth Roman has had several strokes. As a result of the strokes, Mr. Roman \nhas left side hemiparesis. He also has  diabetes, congestive heart failure, peripheral \nvascular disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, renal failure and irritable bowel \nsyndrome. \n59.     Plaintiff Roman has also had several heart attacks, the most recent of which was \nin 2009.  \n60.     Mr. Roman uses a four-pronged cane for support and mobility. However, he \noften falls while using the cane due to his left side hemiparesis \n61.  Plaintiff Kenneth Roman is Medicaid eligible and receives LT-PCS services.  He \nlives alone in a trailer.  His parents live nearby, but both of are elderly and are themselves \ndisabled.  They are unable to assist him.  \n62.   Mr. Roman is currently separated from his wife.  One of the primary reasons they \nare separated is because his wife did not want to be his caregiver any longer.   \n63.   Due to his impairments, Plaintiff Roman needs assistance with all of his activities \nof daily living.  He is incontinent and needs assistance cleaning after an incontinence \nepisode.  This is even more important when his irritable bowel syndrome occurs.  He is \noften incontinent of bowel and bladder at night and often must wait until his personal \ncare worker arrives in the morning to assist with cleaning.   \n64.  Plaintiff Roman needs assistance changing to a standing position from a sitting \nposition.  He needs help bathing, washing his face and brushing his teeth.  He has \ndifficulty moving in bed and often is not able to move in bed when he has no assistance.  \nNot moving during the night causes him severe pain.  As a result of the pain, he often \nfalls in the morning when he tries to walk. \n  13 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 13 of 25\n\n \n65.  When Mr. Roman was first determined eligible for the LT-PCS program in 2008, \nhe was assessed and determined to need 47 hours per week of personal care services. In \n2009, Mr. Roman was reassessed and his LT-PCS services were reduced 39 hours per \nweek.  \n66.  The reduction of LT-PCS to 39 hours per week has been very difficult for him.  \nFor example, because his physical care needs are great, his shopping, laundry and \nhousehold chores (such as washing bed linens soiled in incontinence episodes) are not \ndone promptly. In addition, he must wait longer periods of time to be cleaned if he has a \nbowel or bladder accident when his caregiver is not present.   \n67.     Kenneth Roman is active in his church, where his father has been the pastor.  He \nhas several friends that are part of the church with whom he prays.   \n68.     Mr. Roman can safely live at home with 39 hours of LT-PCS services. If his \nLT-PCS hours are reduced, he believes that he would be forced to seek care in a nursing \nhome. Mr. Roman wants to stay home where he can continue to be part of his \ncommunity. \nDenise Hodges \n69.    Plaintiff Denise Hodges is 53 years old and has lived in Bossier City, Louisiana \nsince 1983.  She has worked as a model, a cosmetologist, and an accountant/bookkeeper. \n70.  Ms. Hodges was diagnosed with transverse myelitis in 1989 that left her \nparalyzed from the waist down.   \n71.    In 2001, Ms. Hodges was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.   \n  14 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 14 of 25\n\n \n72.   Ms. Hodges became eligible for Medicaid in 1994.  She receives $610 per month \nin Social Security Disability Insurance and $81 per month in Supplemental Security \nIncome.   \n73.  From 1989 to 2007, Plaintiff Hodges’ husband provided assistance with all her \nactivities of daily living.  However, in 2007, he was diagnosed with Lyme disease, and \nmoved to live with his parents in Atlanta, Texas (approximately 75 miles away).  \n74.  Due to her multiple sclerosis, Ms. Hodges has frequent extreme fatigue and loss \nof stabilitiy.  She requires extensive assistance transferring, dressing, toileting and \nbathing.  She needs help pushing her manual wheelchair. She needs assistance with \npersonal hygiene, meal preparation, shopping, laundry and household chores.  \n75.  Ms. Hodges requires digital stimulation in order to have a bowel movement.  Her \npersonal care workers must assist her with cleaning herself and any laundry that must be \ndone as a result of bowel movements. \n76.     Ms. Hodges has a decubitis ulcers on one of her heels and on her lower spine. \nThese are extremely dangerous and potentially life-threatening. These decubitis ulcers \ndeveloped because she has not had adequate LT-PCS services to help assure that she does \nnot sit or recline in one place for more than two hours at a time.  She needs assistance \ntransferring in and out of the bed and in and out of the wheelchair. \n77.      Ms. Hodges began receiving 48 hours per week of LT-PCS in 2007. In 2008 \nafter her annual reassessment, Ms. Hodges’ LT-PCS hours were reduced to 46 hours per \nweek.  \n78.     In 2009, Ms. Hodges was offered 32 hours of LT-PCS instead of the 46 hours \nper week she had been receiving.  Ms. Hodges asked that her LT-PCS plan be \n  15 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 15 of 25\n\n \nreconsidered based on her needs and because, if her hours were reduced to 32 hours per \nweek, she would be forced into a nursing home. On appeal,  the Office of Aging and \nAdult Services agreed that the 39 hours per week of LT-PCS services were the minimum \nmedically necessary number of hours that she needed to avoid having to enter a nursing \nfacility for care.  \n79.    Currently, Ms. Hodges receives LT-PCS services for seven hours per day \nMonday through Friday and four hours on Saturday.  On Sunday, her husband returns \nhome and provides some assistance.  However, she must make sure that she has had a \nbath and all other difficult tasks have been completed so that he does not have to do them.  \n80.     Ms. Hodges’ husband is able to prepare simple meals and assist her to transfer \nto and from her wheelchair and bed.  He cannot bathe, dress and undress her, or provide \nher with toileting assistance. \n81.     Ms. Hodges is a published poet and illustrator. She has taken continuing \neducation classes, and would like to attend classes again when her health improves, but \nshe will need to have an adequate number of LT-PCS service hours to allow me to remain \nin the community.  \n82.     Ms. Hodges does not want to live in a nursing home in order to receive the same \nservices she presently receives in the community through Defendants’ LT-PCS program.  \nShe could not continue to live in the community with only 32 hours of LT-PCS assistance \neach week. \nRickii Ainey \n83.     Plaintiff Rickii Ainey is 30 years old. She lives alone in New Orleans, \nLouisiana, where she has lived all of her life. \n  16 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 16 of 25\n\n \n84.     Ms. Ainey has arthrogryposis, a congenital form of arthritis.  She is paralyzed \nfrom the waist up and has limited mobility in her legs. She has limited range of motion in \nher legs and the range of motion is deteriorating. \n85.     Because this impairment is progressive, she has required an increasing amount \nof care as she has aged. \n86.  Ms. Ainey has received Medicaid since she was a child.  Her only dependable \nincome is Supplemental Security Income, which is $247.00 per month. \n87.     Ms. Ainey needs assistance with all activities of daily living, including but not \nlimited to bathing her upper body, including her face, arms and torso, and washing her \nhair; dressing in the morning and undressing when she goes to bed; adjusting her clothing \nbefore and after toileting; getting on and off the toilet and cleaning herself after toileting; \nfeminine hygiene; eating and drinking; transferring from any surface to a standing \nposition; and moving once in bed. \n88.     Ms. Ainey cannot prepare meals and cannot shop without assistance. In \naddition, she requires assistance to do all household chores and laundry. \n89.     Ms. Ainey can use the phone by placing it on her bed or other flat surface and \nusing her knuckle to dial.  She then bends at the waist and put her ear to the phone using \nthe bed or other surface for support.  To stand again, she must perform a rolling motion \nuntil she shifts her body to a standing position. If Ms. Ainey falls, which happens from \ntime to time, she cannot stand again without assistance and must wait for someone to \ncome and help her.    \n90.    Ms. Ainey’s mother lives nearby but refuses to assist her daughter. Ms. Ainey \nhas a sister who lives in Arkansas and four brothers who live in New Orleans.  Her \n  17 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 17 of 25\n\n \nbrothers cannot provide the intimate personal care she needs, and Ms. Ainey does not \nbelieve they are responsible enough to help her on a regular basis. \n91.  Ms. Ainey attempted suicide in December of 2006. The primary reason for the \nsuicide attempt was the fact that she had no personal care assistance. \n92.   Ms. Ainey learned about the LT-PCS program and began receiving LT-PCS \nservices in October of 2007.  At that time Ms. Ainey was awarded 37.5 hours per week of \nassistance. \n93.     In 2008, Ms. Ainey had surgery on her right knee.  She was reassessed and was \nawarded 55 hours per week of LT-PCS services.   \n94.   Upon her reassessment in late 2009, Ms. Ainey was told by the assessor that she \nwould receive only 30 hours per week of LT-PCS.  She immediately appealed.  When she \nreceived her official notice, it turned out that she had in fact been allocated 41 hours per \nweek of LT-PCS, which is the number of hours she is currently approved to receive. Ms. \nAiney has no assistance other than the 41 hours per week provided by her LT-PCS \nworker.   \n95.  A reduction of LT-PCS hours to 32 a week will not provide her with adequate \nassistance. Ms. Ainey does not want, at the age of thirty, to be forced to live in a nursing \nhome.  She is active in her community, and wants to continue to receive services in her \nown home.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n96.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2), the named Plaintiffs bring this action \non behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated. \n  18 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 18 of 25\n\n \n97.  The proposed class consists of Louisiana residents with disabilities who are \nrecipients or prospective recipients of Medicaid-funded services through the LT-PCS \nprogram; who desire to continue to reside in the community instead of in a nursing \nfacility; who can reside in the community with appropriate Medicaid-funded LT-PCS \nservices; and who are at risk of being forced to enter a nursing home because Defendants \nplan to reduce the level of community-based services. \n98.  The Plaintiff class is so numerous that joinder of all its members is impracticable.  \nAs of April 2010, DHH reported that there were approximately 10,878 people who were \nreceiving Defendants’ Medicaid LT-PCS services.  These people want to continue living \nin the community but are or will be at risk of institutionalization if they do not receive \nadequate Medicaid LT-PCS community-based services. Joinder is also impracticable \nbecause class members lack the knowledge and financial means to maintain individual \nactions. Future recipients of LT-PCS are also included in the class.  \n99.  The questions of law or fact common to the class include: \n(a)  Whether Defendants violate the ADA and Section 504 statutory \n“integration mandate” and the “methods of administration” prohibition, by \nrequiring named Plaintiffs and class members to enter a nursing facilities in order \nto receive long-term care services, rather than providing those services in \nappropriate settings in Plaintiffs’ homes and communities; \n(b)  Whether DHH violates the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(3), 42 \nC.F.R. §431.200 et seq.; the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution; and 42 U.S.C. §1983, by allocating hours to new \nservice recipients, or reducing services to existing recipients, based on notices that \n  19 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 19 of 25\n\n \nfail to give them a meaningful opportunity to understand, review, and, where \nappropriate, challenge the department's action. \n100.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class as a \nwhole, in that the named Plaintiffs and purported class are Medicaid recipients of LT-\nPCS services who are at risk of being forced to enter a nursing facility to receive the \nsame services they receive in the community, and who desire to and who could live in the \ncommunity with the same, appropriate LT-PCS services that they have been receiving. \n101.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly represent and adequately protect the interests of \nmembers of the class as a whole.  The named Plaintiffs do not have any interests \nantagonistic to those of other class members.  By filing this action, the named Plaintiffs \nhave displayed an interest in vindicating their rights, as well as the claims of others who \nare similarly situated.  The relief sought by the named Plaintiffs will inure to the benefit \nof members of the class generally.  The named Plaintiffs are represented by counsel are \nskilled and knowledgeable about civil rights litigation, disability discrimination, \nMedicaid law, practice and procedure in the federal courts and the prosecution and \nmanagement of class action litigation.  \n102.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \nclass, thereby making final injunctive relief appropriate with respect to the class as a \nwhole under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).   \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF - TITLE II OF THE AMERICANS WITH \nDISABILITIES ACT \n \n103.     Plaintiffs and class members are individuals with disabilities in that they have \nphysical and other impairments that substantially limit one or more of their major life \nactivities. \n  20 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 20 of 25\n\n \n104.     Plaintiffs and the class are qualified persons with disabilities in that they are \ncapable of safely living at home with necessary services.  They meet the essential \neligibility requirements for the receipt of services from and participation in the State \nMedicaid program, 42 U.S.C. §12131(2).  \n105.    Without reasonable modification of the rules, policies, and procedures governing \nLouisiana’s Medicaid program, Plaintiffs at a risk of being isolated and segregated into \nan institutional setting.  This is against their will, and they do not want to be placed in \nnursing homes. \n106.     Defendants’ denial of Medicaid funding for the LT-PCS services that Plaintiffs \nrequire to avoid segregation in an institution and remain in the integrated home settings \nthat are appropriate to their needs, constitutes unlawful discrimination in violation of \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing \nregulation, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  \n107.     Defendants have utilized criteria and methods of administration that subject \nPlaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of disability, including unnecessary \ninstitutionalization, by (1) failing to assess properly the services and supports that would \nenable Plaintiffs to remain in the community and (2) denying Plaintiffs access to \nMedicaid-covered services that will meet their needs in the community, in violation of \nTitle II of the ADA and implementing regulations. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF - SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION \nACT \n \n108.     Plaintiffs are “qualified person with disabilities” within the meaning of Section \n504.  They have physical and/or mental impairments that substantially limit one or more \n  21 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 21 of 25\n\n \nmajor life activities, and they meet the essential eligibility requirements for long term \ncare under Louisiana’s Medicaid program.   \n109.    Defendant DHH’s denial of Medicaid funding for the LT-PCS services that \nPlaintiffs require to avoid segregation in an institution and remain in the integrated home \nsettings that is appropriate to their needs constitutes unlawful discrimination in violation \nof Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §794(a), and its implementing \nregulation, 28 C.F.R. §41.51(d).   \n110.      Defendant DHH has also utilized criteria and methods of administration that \nsubject Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of disability, including risk of \nunnecessary institutionalization, by (1) failing to assess properly the services and \nsupports that would enable Plaintiffs to remain in the community and (2) denying \nPlaintiffs access to Medicaid-covered services that will meet their needs in the \ncommunity, thereby violating Section 504 and its implementing regulations. \n111.     Defendant DHH has failed to make reasonable modifications in its policies, \npractices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on \nthe basis of disability, in violation of Section 504 and its implementing regulations.  DHH \ncannot demonstrate that making such modifications in its programs that would afford \nPlaintiffs the ability in their homes with adequate services and supports would \nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.  \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF--DUE PROCESS AND MEDICAID  \n \n112.  The reduction of services to Plaintiffs and similarly-situated class members based \non notices that are inadequate to explain to recipients the basis of the Department’s \ndecision, or to assist recipients in deciding whether to appeal and how to challenge the \n  22 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 22 of 25\n\n \nDepartment’s decision if they should decide to appeal, violates the Medicaid Act, 42 \nU.S.C. §1396a(a)(3), 42 C.F.R. §431.200 et seq.; the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and 42 U.S.C. §1983. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \n \n           WHEREFORE, named Plaintiffs and the class respectfully request that the Court \ngrant the following relief: \nA.  Declare  that  the  Defendants’  denial  of  necessary  and  appropriately \nadequate Medicaid in-home community-based LT-PCS services for Plaintiffs constitutes \nunlawful discrimination in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  \nB.  Declare that the reduction of services to Plaintiffs and similarly-situated \nclass members based on notices that are inadequate to explain to recipients the basis of \nthe Department’s decision, or to assist recipients in deciding whether to appeal and how \nto challenge the Department’s decision if they should decide to appeal, violates the \nMedicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(3), 42 C.F.R. §431.200 et seq.; the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and 42 U.S.C. \n§1983. \n  C.  Grant  temporary,  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctions  enjoining  the \nDefendants, their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and all persons who are in active \nconcert  or  participation  with  them  from  denying  Plaintiffs’  Medicaid  necessary  and \nappropriate LT-PCS services “in the most integrated setting” so they can reside in their \nhomes, or from reducing Plaintiffs’ LT-PCS services that they currently receive in the \n  23 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 1     09/22/10   Page 23 of 25\n\n \nLT-PCS  program  which  had  been  determined medically  necessary  and  the  minimal \namount of services the Plaintiffs required to avoid institutionalization in nursing facilities.   \nD.  Grant temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctions enjoining the \nDefendants, their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and all persons who are in active \nconcert or participation with them from reducing services to Plaintiffs and similarly-\nsituated class members based on notices that are inadequate to explain to recipients the \nbasis of the Department’s decision, or to assist recipients in deciding whether to appeal \nand how to challenge the Department’s decision if they should decide to appeal, \nE .  Waive the requirement for the posting of a bond as security for the entry \nof preliminary relief. \nF.  Award the Plaintiff the costs of this action and reasonable attorney’s fees \npursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794a and 42 U.S.C. § 12133 and any other applicable provision \nof law. \nG.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \nHELEN PITTS, ET AL \nCIVIL ACTION \nVERSUS \nNO. 10  -635-JJB-SR \nBRUCE GREENSTEIN, IN HIS OFFICIAL \nCAPACITY AS SECRETARY OF THE \nLOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH \nAND HOSPITALS, ET AL \nRULING ON DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nThis  matter  is  before  the  Court  on  Defendants'  Motion  (doc.  11)  for \nSummary  Judgment.  Plaintiffs  have  filed  an  opposition  (doc.  36)  to  which \nDefendants have filed a reply (doc. 39).  On April 20, 2011, this Court heard oral \narguments from the parties.  This Court's jurisdiction exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§  1331.  For the  reasons  stated herein the Court DENIES  Defendants'  motion \n(doc. 11 ). \nBackground \nI.  Facts \nThe following facts are undisputed.  Since 2003, the state of Louisiana, as \npart  of  its  Medicaid  plan,  has  offered  home-and-community-based  services \n(\"HCBS\")  to  disabled  individuals  through  its  long-term  personal  care  services \n(\"LT-PCS\") program (doc. 36, ex.  1, pp.  10-11).  The LT-PCS program provides \ndisabled  individuals  with  a  personal  care  worker  to  assist  the  individual  in \nperforming  basic  tasks,  such  as  personal  care  or  household  chores,  that  the \n1 \n\nindividual  would  otherwise  be  unable  to  perform  (doc.  36,  ex.  1,  pp.  5-8).1 \nThose  who  do  not  qualify for  LT  -PCS,  or  seek  additional  or alternative \nservices, may enter one of the State's waiver programs,2 however, each program \nsuffers from  limited  slots,  geographical  or age  limits,  and/or waiting  lists.  For \nthose programs that have waiting lists, an individual may be moved to the top of \nthe priority list and immediately offered a waiver, but to do so, the individual must \nhave had a hospital stay in excess of 30 days or been treated in a nursing facility \nfor 120 consecutive days (doc. 39-2, ~ 13). \nIn March 2009, in order to address budgetary concerns, the State lowered \nthe maximum weekly LT   -PCS service hours that an individual could receive from \n1 To qualify for LT -PCS,  an  individual must be so physically disabled that he or she would qualify to \nreceive care in a nursing facility and must demonstrate that he or she \"faces a substantial possibility of \ndeterioration in mental or physical condition or functioning if either home or community-based services \nare not provided  in  less than  120 days.\"  34  LAC  50 XV §  12905,  Louisiana Register,  v.  30  no.  12 \nDecember 2004, p. 2831. \nPlaintiffs Helen  Pitts,  Kenneth  Roman,  Denise Hodges,  Rickii Ainey and  Cleo Lancaster each \nreceive an average of 39 hours per week of care through LT-PCS (doc. 36, ex. 3, 1f22; ex. 4, 1f20; ex. 5, \n1f16; ex. 6, 1f28).  Each Plaintiff's primary physician has stated that if his or her hours of in-home care are \nreduced to 32 hours per week, each will suffer a deterioration in condition and will be forced to enter a \nnursing home for care (doc. 36, ex. 8, 1f1f9, 11-15; ex. 9, 1f1f11, 13; ex. 10; ex. 11, 1f1f8-12; ex 121f1f17-\n18). \n2 Louisiana maintains the following waiver services: \nElderly and Disabled Adults (\"EDA\"): The EDA program, which an individual may not participate \nin simultaneously with LT -PCS, provides an annual budget which is typically substantial enough \nto pay for 65 hours of in-home care (doc. 36, ex. 1, pp. 73-74).  However, an individual must wait \napproximately 30  months before receiving the applied-for care (/d.  p.  52).  As of October 10, \n2010, 46% of the 12,021 people who received LT-PCS were also on the EDA waiting list (ld. p. \n69).  Moreover, in 2009 the State capped the program at 4, 603 slots (/d. p. 41 ). \nAdult Day Health Care (\"ADHC\"): The ADHC program provides essential services in an adult day \ncare center.  All ADHC licensed facilities must operate for a minimum of five hours per day and \nmust provide transportation to and from the facility (doc. 11-2, 1f 22).  However, it has only 825 \nslots, a waiting list over five months long and is not available in many parts of the state. \nProgram of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (\"PACE\"): The PACE program has only 400 slots \nand is only available to individuals 55 and older and only in certain parts of Baton Rouge and \nNew Orleans (/d. p. 43-44). \nMoney  Follows  the  Person  (\"MFP\"):  The  MFP  program  offers  assistance  to  individuals \ntransitioning from nursing facilities, but does not provide services to individuals seeking to avoid \nentering a nursing facility (/d. at 89-91 ). \n2 \n\n56  to 42  (doc.  36,  ex.  1,  pp.  11,  66-67).  In  September 2010,  the State again \nlowered  the  maximum  weekly service  hours,  from  42  to  32,  and  changed  the \nassessment criteria (doc. 36, ex.  1, pp.  11, 66-67).3  These provisions apply not \nonly to  new LT  -PCS  recipients but to  individuals currently receiving  assistance \nwhen they undergo their annual eligibility assessments. \nThe  Louisiana  Department  of  Health  and  Hospitals  (\"LADHH\")  has \ndetermined this change will save the state $5 million in 2011  and $24 million in \n2012 (doc. 36, ex.  1, p.  206).  However, Plaintiffs suggest that the average cost \nof services  for  an  individual  in  the  LT  -PCS  program  is  less  than  the  cost  of \nmaintaining the same individual in a nursing home (doc. 36, Pitts_0001 041, p. 2). \nPlaintiffs also suggest that the cost of servicing individuals in nursing homes has \nsteadily increased in recent years (doc. 36, Pitts_000044, Pitts_0001188). \nII. Procedu ral History \nOn  September 22,  2010,  Plaintiffs filed  suit against the  LADHH  and  its \nSecretary,  Bruce Greenstein,  seeking  declaratory and  injunctive relief (doc.  1) . \nPlaintiffs  assert  that  the  reduction  in  LT   -PCS  hours  unlawfully  discriminates \nagainst disabled individuals by depriving them of at-home assistance necessary \n3 As of March 1, 2009, the State determined the level of an individual's disability by the individual's ability \nto  perform (1) seven different \"activities of daily living\" (ADLs):  bed  mobility,  transferring,  locomotion, \ndressing, eating, toileting, personal hygiene and bathing; (2) eight different \"instrumental activities of daily \nliving\"  (IADLs):  meal  preparation,  housework,  managing  finances  or  medication,  using  the  phone, \nshopping and transportation.  In August 2010, the State changed its method of determining the level of an \nindividual's disability to require the individual,  in  order to receive the maximum amount of assistance, \nneed assistance in four ADLs: eating, bathing, transferring, and moving in bed (doc. 36, ex. 1, 164-172). \nNationally, an individual needing assistance in three ADLs receives an average of 59.6 hours per \nweek of personal assistance in order to remain in the community; an individual needing assistance in four \nADLs receives 85.9 (doc. 36). \n3 \n\nto  remain  \"integrated\"  into  the  community  in  violation  of  the  Title  II  of  the \nAmerican's with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (2010), and Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Section 504\"), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (201 0). \nOn  October 21,  2010,  Defendants filed  their Motion (doc.  11) to  Dismiss \nPlaintiffs'  claims,  which  the  Court  later  converted  (doc.  25)  into  a  Motion  for \nSummary Judgment.  Defendants assert that they have not discriminated against \nPlaintiffs under the ADA or Section 504 because they have a comprehensive and \neffective plan  in  place to  provide disabled  individuals with  HCBS.  Defendants \nalso assert that even if they have discriminated against Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' ADA \nand Section 504 claims must fail  because they have failed to meet their burden \nof providing a reasonable modification to the proposed plan (doc. 11 ). \nOn November 10, 2010, Plaintiffs filed their opposition (doc. 17).  Plaintiffs \nassert that Defendants (1) have discriminated against them under the ADA and \nSection 504 by increasing the likelihood that they will be institutionalized; (2) they \nhave proposed a reasonable modification in suggesting the state maintain its 42-\nhour  maximum;  and  (3)  Defendants  have  additionally  discriminated  against \nPlaintiffs by basing the level of care they receive on the severity of their disability \n(doc. 17). \nStandard of Review \nUnder  Federal  Rule  of Civil  Procedure  12(b)(6)  a  federal  district  court \nshould dismiss a plaintiff's complaint if it \"fails to state a claim upon which relief \ncan  be  granted.\"  However,  [i]f,  on  a motion  under Rule  12(b)(6) ... , matters \n4 \n\noutside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion \nmust be treated as one for summary judgment.\"  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(d).  A court \nmay grant a motion for summary judgment if the evidence establishes that there \nis no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56.  If the  movant carries  its  burden,  the  non \nmovant must then demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact \nin  order to  survive the  motion for summary judgment.  Matsushita  Elec.  Indus. \nCo., Ltd. v.  Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986). \nDiscussion \nDefendants  assert that  they  have  not  discriminated  under  the  ADA  or \nSection  504  by  reducing  the  weekly maximum  of LT  -PCS  service  hours  (doc. \n11 ).  Defendants assert that the combination  of LT  -PCS  and  waiver programs \nensure that disabled individuals are not forced into nursing facilities.  Defendants \nassert  that  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  show  that  returning  to  a  42-hour  weekly \nmaximum is a reasonable modification to the current plan. \nPlaintiffs  assert  that  the  State's  plan  increases  their  risk  of \ninstitutionalization because the State's waiver programs are either unavailable in \nmany parts of the state or have lengthy waiting periods.  Plaintiffs also assert that \nreturning to a 42-hour weekly maximum is a reasonable modification because the \nState  will  end  up  spending  more  money  if  LT   -PCS  recipients  are  forced  to \nreceive care in nursing facilities as a result of the reduction.  Therefore, Plaintiffs \nassert,  Defendants now bear the burden of establishing that returning to the 42-\n5 \n\nhour  weekly  maximum  would  constitute  an  undue  burden  or  a  fundamental \nalteration of its program. \nThe ADA prohibits state agencies from  discriminating  against individuals \nwith disabilities in the provision of public services.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 (A)-( B) & \n12132.  In  drafting  the  ADA,  Congress  stated  that  \"historically,  society  has \ntended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities\" and that \"individuals \nwith  disabilities continually encounter various forms  of discrimination,  including \noutright  intentional  exclusion,  .  .  .  failure  to  make  modifications  to  existing \nfacilities and practices ... [and] segregation.\"  42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 (a)(2), (5).  To \neffectuate the  goal  of  integrating  disabled  individuals  into  their  communities, \npublic  entities  are  required  to  \"administer services  . . . in  the  most integrated \nsetting  appropriate to the  needs of qualified individuals with  disabilities\" and to \nmake  \"reasonable  modifications\"  in  furtherance  of  that  goal.  28  CFR  § \n35.130(b)(7), (d) (1998). \nThe  party  challenging  a  State's  program  bears  the  initial  burden  of \ndemonstrating that the program violates the ADA's integration mandate and that \nthe  requested  relief  would  be  a  reasonable  modification.  Henrietta  D.  v. \nBloomberg,  331  F.3d 261,  280  (2d  Cir.  2003).  A State's program violates the \nADA's integration  mandate if it creates the  risk of segregation;  neither present \nnor  inevitable  segregation  is  required.4  In  determining  whether  a  proposed \n4 For example, in Fisher v.  Oklahoma, 335 F.3d 1175 (10th Cir. 2003), Oklahoma adopted a policy under \nwhich  it  provided  unlimited  prescription  medicine to  individuals  in  institutions,  but  not to  individuals \nreceiving community-based services.  Fisher,  335 F.3d at 1181.  The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals \n6 \n\nmodification is reasonable,  courts consider the resources available to the State \nand  the  State's  responsibility  to  equitably  apportion  those  resources  to  all \ndisabled individuals.  Olmstead v.  L.C.  ex ref Zimring,  527  U.S.  581,  597,  604, \n607 (1999).  That is,  courts must consider the cost-effectiveness of community-\nbased  services  globally  and  not  solely  in  relation  to  the  particular  litigants. \nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 604 (stating that although community-based services may \nbe cheaper than institutional services when judged on a purely individual basis, a \n\"[s]tate . . .  may experience increased overall expenses by funding  community \nplacements without being able to take advantage of the savings associated with \nclosure  of  institutions\").  As  such,  a  State  must  be  given  some  leeway  in \ncomplying with the ADA and can satisfy its obligations by \"demonstrat[ing] that it \n[has] a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with \n[]  disabilities  in  less  restrictive  settings,  and  a  waiting  list  that  move[s]  at  a \nreasonable pace.\"  /d.  at 605-06. \nThe Court finds that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment should be \ndenied.  Plaintiffs require, on average, 39 hours of HCBS per week (doc. 36, ex. \n3, ~ 22; ex. 4, ~ 20; ex. 5, ~16; ex. 6, ~ 28).  Therefore,  Louisiana's current plan \nwould require  Plaintiffs to receive, on  average, 7 hours of additional assistance \nper week.  Though the State has waiver programs through which Plaintiffs can \nfound that this violated Title II because the plaintiffs' health might deteriorate, leading to increased need \nfor prescription medication and, therefore, an increased risk of institutionalization.  ld; see also Brantley v. \nMaxwell-Jolly, 656 F. Supp. 2d 1161, 1170 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (stating that the risk of institutionalization is \nsufficient for a violation of the ADA); M.A. C.  v.  Betit, 284 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1309 (D. Utah 2003) (same); \nMakin v. Hawaii, 144 F. Supp. 2d 1017, 1034 (D. Haw. 1999) (same). \n7 \n\nreceive  the  necessary  supplemental  assistance,  each  of  the  programs  has \nlimited slots,  geographical or age limits,  and/or waiting lists of up to two-and-a \nhalf years.  See supra note 2.  Defendants assert that Plaintiffs can be moved to \nthe  top  of the  priority list by submitting  to  a 120-day stay in  a nursing  facility, \nhowever,  this  would  subject  Plaintiffs  to  the  very  institutionalization  which  the \nADA seeks to avoid.  Therefore, the State's current plan plainly violates the ADA \nby creating a greater risk for institutionalization for those individuals who require \nmore than 32 hours per week of assistance.  See Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1181. \nIn  addition,  there  are  genuine  issues  of  material  fact  as  to  whether \nmaintaining  the  42-hour weekly  maximum  is  a \"reasonable  modification\"  or  a \n\"fundamental  alteration\" for purposes of Plaintiffs' ADA claim.  Plaintiffs assert \nthat the  proposed plan will save the state $5  million in  2011  and $24 million in \n2012  (doc.  36,  ex.  1,  p.  206).  However,  Defendants  assert  that  the  cost  of \nservicing  individuals  in  nursing  homes  has  steadily  increased  in  recent  years \n(doc. 36,  Pitts_000044, Pitts_0001188), and that the average cost of serving an \nindividual in the LT  -PCS program is less than the cost of maintaining the same \nindividual in a nursing facility (doc. 36, Pitts_0001 041, p. 2).  Therefore, the Court \nfinds that summary judgment is not appropriate. \n8 \n\nConclusion \nAccordingly,  the  Court hereby DENIES  Defendants'  Motion  (doc.  11) for \nSummary Judgment.  , \nb~ ~1ay  _,_/h----1H--I--' \nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana this /  of  2011. \nJUDGEJA, E  .

INTRODUCTION \n \n  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of Louisiana \nMedicaid recipients who have severe disabilities and are eligible to receive Medicaid \nservices in nursing facilities, but who are receiving Louisiana Medicaid-funded long-term \npersonal care services in their homes instead of being institutionalized in nursing \nfacilities.  They wish to continue to receive services in their homes and communities.  \nDefendants, the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals and its Secretary, have \nannounced their intention to limit home-based personal care services to a maximum of 32 \nhours per week from the current 42 hours per week. This reduction in services will force \nnamed and class Plaintiffs into institutions to receive personal care and assistance with \ntheir activities of daily living, in violation of the “integration mandate” of Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (“ADA”) and the \n1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 30-1     12/20/10   Page 1 of 11\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (“Section 504”).  In this action, named and \nclass Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the Louisiana Department \nof Health and Hospitals from reducing services to a maximum of 32 hours per week.  \nII. PROPOSED CLASS DEFINITION \nThe proposed class is defined as: \n \nLouisiana residents with disabilities who are recipients or prospective recipients \nof Medicaid-funded services through the LT-PCS program; who desire to \ncontinue to reside in the community instead of in a nursing facility; who can \nreside in the community with appropriate Medicaid-funded LT-PCS services; and \nwho are at risk of being forced to enter a nursing home because Defendants plan \nto reduce the level of community-based services. \n \nIII. THE PROPOSED CLASS MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS  \nOF FED. R. CIV. P. RULE 23(a) AND 23(b)(2) \n \n  A class should be certified if plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23 (a) and any of the requirements of subsections (b) (1), (2), or (3).  Amchem \nProducts, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 (1997).   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) provides that \na class should be certified if “the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or \ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; \nand (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass.”  Plaintiffs in this case seek class certification under Rule 23(b)(2), because \nDefendant has acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, making \ninjunctive and declaratory relief appropriate. Plaintiffs are not seeking damages. \nA. Numerosity \nIn Defendants’ Memorandum in Support of their Motion to Dismiss this case \n(Doc. No. 11-1), Defendants state: “Of the approximately 12,000 individuals receiving \n2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 30-1     12/20/10   Page 2 of 11\n\nLT-PCS services, 28% currently receive services in excess of 32 hours per week”).  See \nDeclaration of Hugh Eley, Doc. No. 11-2, ¶37.  As the Eley Declaration makes clear, all \nof these people have been found by the Department not only to have disabilities, but also \n(1) to meet medical necessity criteria that would qualify them for services in a nursing \nhome, and (2) to be at imminent risk of having to enter a nursing facility if they do not \nreceive personal care services.  Eley Decl., ¶32.   \nCourts in this circuit have not required evidence of exact class size or identity of \nclass members to satisfy the numerosity requirement. Zeidman v. J. Ray McDermott & \nCo., 651 F.2d 1030, 1039 (5th Cir. 1981); Bywaters v. United States, 196 F.R.D. 458, 465 \n(E.D. Tex. 2000).  The court may make common-sense assumptions in order to find \nsupport for numerosity.  See Zeidman at 1039; Leszczynski v. Allianz Insurance Co., 176 \nF.R.D. 659, 669 (S.D. Fla. 1997) (quoting Evans v. United States Pipe & Foundry, 696 \nF.2d 925, 930 (11 Cir. 1993).  While it is not presently known how many of the \napproximately 3,300 individuals who are currently receiving more than 32 hours of LT-\nPCS per week are at risk of institutionalization if their services are reduced to the 32-hour \nmaximum, it is reasonable to believe that the number may be in the hundreds or even \nthousands. \nThe Fifth Circuit has held that classes with 100 to 150 members generally satisfy \nthe numerosity requirement. See, e.g., Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, L.L.C., 186 F.3d \n620, 624 (5th Cir. 1999). James v. City of Dallas, 254 F.3d 551, 570 (5th Cir. 2001) (court \ncertified class with at least 100 members); Jones v. Diamond, 519 F. 2d 1090 (5th Cir. \n1975); Phillips v. Joint Legislative Committee, 637 F. 2d 1014, 1022 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. \ndenied, 456 U.S. 960 (1982) (at least 33 members, plus future members, sufficient); see \nalso Cox v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 784 F. 2d 1546, 1553 (11th Cir. 1986), \n(quoting 5 Moore's Federal Practice §23.22(1)(b) n.6 (2005) (“Eleventh Circuit has \nstated that ‘generally less than 21 is inadequate and more than 40 is adequate, with \n3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 30-1     12/20/10   Page 3 of 11\n\nnumbers in between varying according to other factor.’”)). The instant case clearly meets \nthis standard.   \nThe practicality of joining the members of the proposed class is the primary issue \nraised by the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a). Zeidman, 651 F.2d at 1038; Phillips, \n637 F.2d at 1022; Garcia v. Gloor, 618 F.2d 264, 267 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 449 \nU.S. 1113 (1981); Murillo v. Musegades, 809 F.Supp. 487, 502 (W.D. Tex. 1992).  The \nsize of the proposed class and the inclusion of future members are separate and \nindependent factors that make joinder patently impracticable in the instant action.  See \nPederson v. Louisiana State Univ., 213 F.3d 858, 869 (5th Cir. 2000); see also Zeidman, \n651 F.2d at 1038.  Other relevant considerations include geographic dispersion, the \nfinancial resources of class members and the ability of claimants to institute individual \nsuits.  Mullen, 186 F.3d at 624, Zeidman, 651 F.2d at 1038. \nThe instant case involves a very large, geographically dispersed class of people \nwhose financial resources and ability to bring individual actions are severely reduced by \ntheir status as being severely disabled..  The members of the proposed class may number \nas many as 3,300. The requirement that \"the class [be] so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable,\" Fed. R.Civ. P. 23(a)(1), is clearly met. \nB.  Commonality   \nThe commonality test is met when there is at least one issue, the resolution of \nwhich will affect all or a significant number of the putative class members.  Mullen, 186 \nF.3d at 625; Lightbourn v. County of El Paso, 118 F.3d 421, 426 (5th Cir. 1997); \nForbush v. J.C. Penney Co., 994 F.2d 1101, 1106 (5th Cir. 1993); Washington v. CSC \nCredit Services, Inc., 178 F.R.D. 95, 100 (E.D. La.), modified, 180 F.R.D. 309 (E.D. La. \n1998).  Here, there are questions of both law and fact common to all the members of the \nproposed class, including: \n \n4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 30-1     12/20/10   Page 4 of 11\n\n(a)  Whether Defendants violate the ADA and Section 504 statutory \n“integration mandate” and the “methods of administration” prohibition, by \nrequiring named Plaintiffs and class members to enter nursing facilities in order to \nreceive long-term care services, rather than providing those services in \nappropriate settings in Plaintiffs’ homes and communities; \n(b)  Whether DHH violates the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(3), 42 \nC.F.R. §431.200 et seq.; the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution; and 42 U.S.C. §1983, by allocating hours to new \nservice recipients, or reducing services to existing recipients, based on notices that \nfail to give them a meaningful opportunity to understand, review, and, where \nappropriate, challenge the department's action. \nThus, there are thus questions of law or fact common to the proposed class in this case, \nsatisfying the requirement of Fed. R. Civ.P. 23(a)(2). \n  Differences in the specific services needed by plaintiffs because of differing \ndisabilities or levels of need do not defeat commonality.  The essence of plaintiffs’ claims \nis that Defendants’ arbitrary maximum of 32 hours per week of personal care services, \nregardless of the needs of individuals in the plaintiff class, will result in their unnecessary \nsegregation and isolation in nursing facilities, in violation of the rights of plaintiffs and \nsimilarly situated individuals under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.    \nIn order for class members to receive personal attendant services, which are currently \nbeing provided in the community and which could appropriately be continued to be \nprovided to them in their homes and communities, they will be forced to enter segregated \ninstitutions to receive those services. \n5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 30-1     12/20/10   Page 5 of 11\n\nIt is the reduction of community-based services to 32 hours a week and the \nresultant unnecessary institutionalization that satisfy the commonality requirements. \nC.  Typicality \n  The test for typicality in the Fifth Circuit is not demanding.  See Lightbourn, 118 \nF.3d at 426, citing Forbush, 994 F.2d at 1106; See also Shipes v. Trinity Industries, 987 \nF.2d 311, 316, (5th Cir. 1993), cert. denied 114 S.Ct. 548 (1993);  In re Am. Commer. \nLines, LLC, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10116, at * 33 (D. La. May 28, 2002). The typicality \nrequirement is satisfied when the named plaintiffs advance legal and remedial theories \nsimilar to those that would be advanced by class members if they were pursuing parallel \nactions. Mullen, 186 F.3d at 625; Lightbourn, 118 F.3d at 426; Robidoux, 987 F.2d at \n935.  Class representatives need only be “part of the class and ‘possess the same interest \nand suffer the same injury’ as the class members.” General Telephone Co. v. Falcon, 457 \nU.S. 147, 156 (1982) (quoting East Texas Motor Freight Systems, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 \nU.S. 395, 403 (1977). \nEach of the four named plaintiffs in this case is a Louisiana Medicaid recipient \nwho has been found eligible for, and has been receiving, Long-term Personal Care \nServices at home in excess of 32 hours per week.  Each has severe disabilities and \nmultiple chronic conditions.  In the case of each named plaintiff, the Department of \nHealth and Hospitals has previously determined that their level of medical need qualifies \nthem for care in a nursing facility and that they are at risk of entering a nursing facility \nfor care if they do not receive home care.  And each was found by Defendants to need \nhours in excess of the 32-hour maximum in the past. None of them wants to leave her or \nhis homes, friends, and families and go into a nursing home in order to receive the same \nMedicaid-funded services that they presently receive in the community.  They are all at \nrisk of institutionalization if their Long Term-Personal Care Services are reduced and \ncapped as defendants propose.  Therefore, as was the case with the Lightbourn class (all \nvoting-age Texas citizens with blindness or mobility impairments), \"[i]n the event that \n6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 30-1     12/20/10   Page 6 of 11\n\nclass members were to proceed in a parallel action, they would advance legal and \nremedial theories similar, if not identical, to those advanced by the named plaintiffs.\"  \nLightbourn, 118 F.3d at 426.  The requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) that \"the claims \nor defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims of the class\" is met in \nthis case.  \nD.  Adequacy \n  Adequate representation depends primarily on three factors.  The named class \nrepresentatives must have an interest in common with unnamed class members and must \nnot have interests antagonistic to members of the class.  Further,  it must appear that the \nrepresentatives will vigorously prosecute those interests through qualified counsel.  See \nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. at 614; see also East Texas Motor Freight \nSystem Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. at 403.  As the Amchem Products Court noted, \"the \nadequacy-of-representation requirement 'tends to merge' with the commonality and \ntypicality criteria of Rule 23(a), which 'serve as guideposts for determining whether ... \nmaintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named plaintiff's claim and \nthe class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly \nand adequately protected in their absence.’” Id. at 2251 n. 20, (citing General Telephone \nCo. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. at 157 n. 13 (1982)). Any differences between \nthe named plaintiff and class members render the named plaintiff inadequate only if those \ndifferences create conflicts between the interests of the named plaintiff and those of the \nclass.  Mullen, 186 F.3d. at 625-26.  \n  Here, there is no conflict of interest between the named plaintiffs and the other \nmembers of the class.  As was shown in connection with the typicality requirement, the \nnamed plaintiffs in this case have the same claims and seek the same remedies for the \n7 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 30-1     12/20/10   Page 7 of 11\n\nclass as a whole.  Such sharing of common objectives and legal and factual issues among \nclass members satisfies Rule 23(a)(4)'s requirement that representatives' interests be \ncoextensive with those of the class. See id.; Bertulli v. Independent Assn. of Continental \nPilots, 242 F.3d 290, 298.  \n The qualifications of counsel will be discussed in Section IV, infra. \nE.  Rule 23(b)(2) \nThe present action is well suited for certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) \nbecause it alleges that Defendants’ policies and practices generally applicable to class \nmembers as a whole have operated to discriminate against them in violation of the federal \nlaw.  The 23(b)(2) class action is \"an effective weapon for an across-the-board attack \nagainst systematic abuse\" and discrimination, such as that alleged by the plaintiffs here.  \nJones v. Diamond, 519 F.2d at 1090, 1100 (5th Cir. 1975).  The term \"generally \napplicable\" in Rule 23(b)(2) requires only that the defendants’ actions affect all persons \nsimilarly situated, or that their actions apply generally to the whole class. See Johnson v. \nAmerican Credit Co., 581 F.2d 526, 532 (5th Cir. 1978).   \nThis provision has been interpreted to mean that the party opposing the class has \nacted either in a consistent manner toward members of the class, so that his actions may \nbe viewed as part of a pattern of activity, or has established a regulatory scheme or set of \npractices common to all class members. Leszecynski, 176 F.R.D 659 at 673-74; Quigly v. \nBraniff Airways, Inc., 85 F.R.D. 74, 79 (N.D. Tex. 1979); Ware v. Estes, 328 F. Supp. \n657 (N.D. Tex. 1971), aff'd per curiam, 458 F. 2d 1360 (5th Cir.) cert. denied, 409 U.S. \n1027 (1972).  Plaintiffs intend to prove that Defendants’ proposed reduction in the \nmaximum hours of LT-PCS presents a challengeable common pattern of activity. \nCases seeking declaratory or injunctive relief are particularly appropriate for \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2).  Curtis, 159 F.R.D. at 341; 7A C. Wright, et al., \nFederal Practice and Procedure §1775 (1986) (\"If the Rule 23(a) prerequisites have been \n8 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 30-1     12/20/10   Page 8 of 11\n\nmet and injunctive or declaratory relief has been requested, the action usually should be \nallowed to proceed under subdivision (b)(2).\") A number of courts have recognized the \npropriety of class action treatment under Rule 23(b)(2) in actions brought for injunctive \nrelief regarding physical and programmatic accessibility for people with disabilities. \nLightbourn, 118 F.3d at 426; Access Now, Inc. v. Ambulatory Surgery Center Group, \nLtd., 197 F.R.D. 522 (S.D. Fla 2000); Neff v. VIA Metropolitan Transit Authority, 179 \nF.R.D. 185 (W.D. Tex. 1998); Thrope v. Ohio, 173 F.R.D. 483 (S.D. Ohio 1997); Arnold, \n158 F.R.D. at 454; Civic Association of Deaf of New York City v. Guiliani, 915 F. Supp. \n622 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). \nClass certification not only protects class members from the burden of multiple \nactions, it also guarantees a hearing for individuals, such as many of the class members \nhere, who, by reason of poverty, disability, and inability to secure counsel, may not be in \na position to seek one on their own behalf.  Glover v. Crestwood Lake Section 1 Holding \nCorp., 746 F. Supp. 301, 305 (S.D.N.Y. 1996); Adderly v. Wainwright, 58 F.R.D. 389, \n405-07 (M.D.Fla. 1972); c.f. United States ex rel. Morgan v. Sielaff, 546 F.2d 218, 222 \n(7th Cir. 1976).  In addition, failure to certify a class could preclude notice relief \ninforming the class of their rights and their ability to obtain the relief afforded by the suit, \nas authorized by Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332 (1979).  See Mitchell, 701 F.2d at 344-\n45. \n \nIV.  PROPOSED CLASS COUNSEL WILL FAIRLY AND ADEQUATELY \nREPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE CLASS \nProposed class counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class, \nsatisfying the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g). Plaintiffs are represented by a team \nof law firms, and counsel are well qualified to handle this action and will prosecute it \nvigorously on behalf of the class. Lead counsel, Nell Hahn is employed by the Advocacy \nCenter, which is the independent organization charged with protecting and advocating for \nthe rights of persons with disabilities in the State of Louisiana, pursuant to the \n9 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 30-1     12/20/10   Page 9 of 11\n\nDevelopment Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ \n15041 – 15045 (2000); the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness \nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801 – 10807 (1986), and the Protection and Advocacy for Individual \nRights Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794e(a) (2000).  The Advocacy Center has been providing legal \nrepresentation to individuals with disabilities in the State of Louisiana since 1979.   \nNell Hahn has been practicing law for over 30 years, and has successfully handled \na number of class actions (See e.g., Barthelemy v. Louisiana Department of Health and \nHospitals, 2003 WL 1733534, (E.D. La., Mar 31, 2003); Chisholm v. Jindal, 1998 WL \n92272 (E.D. La. Mar. 2, 1998) (class certification, Duval, J.), Chisholm v. Hood 110 F. \nSupp. 2d 499 (E.D. La. 2000) and 133 F.Supp.2d 894 (E.D. La. 2001) (merits); Shipes v. \nTrinity Industries, Inc., supra.  \nCo-counsel Stephen F. Gold Counsel Stephen F. Gold, is a national expert in \ndisability-rights litigation with an extensive resume of teaching, consulting, and litigation \nexperience.  He has 40 years of experience in Medicaid and disability discrimination, \nincluding litigation throughout the country in many landmark cases in the field.  \nPlaintiffs are also represented by experienced attorneys with AARP Foundation \nLitigation, Kenneth Zeller and Bruce Vignery.  Both counsel have practiced over 30 \nyears and are experienced class action litigators. \n \nV. CONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs therefore respectfully move this court to certify that this action may \nproceed as a class action on behalf of the following class: \n \nLouisiana residents with disabilities who are recipients or prospective recipients \nof Medicaid-funded services through the LT-PCS program; who desire to \ncontinue to reside in the community instead of in a nursing facility; who can \nreside in the community with appropriate Medicaid-funded LT-PCS services; and \nwho are at risk of being forced to enter a nursing home because Defendants plan \nto reduce the level of community-based services. \n \nDate:  December 20, 2010. \n10 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 30-1     12/20/10   Page 10 of 11\n\n \n            Respectfully submitted,  \n            /s/ Nell Hahn         \n            Nell Hahn, T.A. \n            LA Bar No. 22406 \n            Advocacy Center \n            600 Jefferson St., Suite 812 \n            Lafayette, LA 70501 \n            (337) 237-7380, ext. 11 \n            Facsimile (337) 205-6166 \n            nhahn@advocacyla.org \n \n             \n            Stephen F.

RIEDLINGER \n*   \n            *  CLASS ACTION \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY TO DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM  \nIN OPPOSITION TO  CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \nPlaintiffs submit herewith Exhibits 1-4, the declarations of the named Plaintiffs, Rickii \nAiney, Helen Pitts, Kenneth Roman, and Denise Hodges; Exhibit 5, the declaration of putative \nclass member Cleo Lancaster; Exhibit 6, the declaration of Carol Congress, Rickii Ainey’s \nmother; Exhibit 7, the declaration of Jeanne Abadie; and Exhibits 8-11, the declarations of \ncounsel, Nell Hahn, Stephen F. Gold, Bruce Vignery, and Kenneth Zeller. These declarations \nestablish that the requirements of Rule 23 are met.  This Court should therefore enter an order \nproviding that this case may proceed as a class action under Rule 23(b)(2).1 \n1.  Plaintiffs’ claims are not atypical.  \nDefendants’ argument that the claims of the named plaintiffs are not typical because \ndefendants may have unique defenses against some plaintiffs (Defendants’ Memorandum in \nOpposition to Class Certification, hereafter “Defendants’ Memorandum,” at 3-5) is unavailing. \nThe Fifth Circuit has specifically held that the presence of an arguable unique defense does not \nnecessarily destroy typicality.  Feder v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 429 F. 3d 125, 137 (5th Cir. 2005); \nsee also In re Enron Corp. Securities, 529 F.Supp.2d 644, 674 (S.D. Tex. 2004). Instead, the \n                                                 \n1 Class certification is necessary to allow plaintiffs to seek class preliminary injunctive relief.  To \ndate, one of the named plaintiffs, Rickii Ainey, and one identified class member, Cleo Lancaster, have been \nfaced with imminent cuts in their services to levels that would not permit them to continue to live in the \ncommunity.  Defendants have stipulated that the cuts will be suspended in these two cases, while this \naction proceeds. \n \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 33     01/25/11   Page 1 of 10\n\ncritical inquiry is whether the “class representative’s claims have the same essential \ncharacteristics as those of the putative class.” James v. City of Dallas, 254 F.3d 551, 571 (5th Cir. \n2001).   If the claims arise from a “similar course of conduct and share the same legal theory, \nfactual differences will not defeat typicality.”  Id.; Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, LLC, 186 \nF.3d 620 (5th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1159 (2000); Musmeci v. Schwegmann Giant \nSuper Markets, CIV.A. 97-2757, 2000 WL 1010254 (E.D. La. July 20, 2000) amended, CIV. A. \n97-2757, 2000 WL 1185510 (E.D. La. Aug. 18, 2000); Chisholm v. Jindal, CIV. A. 97-3274, \n1998 WL 92272 (E.D. La. Mar. 2, 1998). \nThis case is not like Warren v. Reserve Fund, Inc., 728 F.2d 741 (5th Cir. 1984), (cited in \nDefendants’ Memorandum at p. 3) in which characteristics peculiar to the named plaintiffs make \nthem atypical or weak representatives of the class.  Warren dealt with class claims that a mutual \nfund company misled potential investors in prerecorded telephone message.  The proposed class \nrepresentative was a bank president with considerable financial sophistication, making him \natypical of the class of persons who might be misled by the mutual fund’s message. \nEach of the named plaintiffs in this case, Rickii Ainey, Helen Pitts, Denise Hodges, and \nKenneth Roman, is an individual with severe disabilities who will be placed at risk of having to \ngo into a nursing home for care, if the number of hours of Long Term Personal Care Service \n(“LT-PCS”) that he or she will be eligible to receive is reduced to an absolute maximum of 32 \nhours a week. Each raises the same legal claim under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  See \nExhibits 1-4, Declarations of Rickii Ainey, Helen Pitts, Kenneth Roman, and Denise Hodges. \nLike most recipients of LT-PCS services, the named plaintiffs are all on a multi-year \nwaiting list for a more comprehensive set of services called the Elderly and Disabled Adult \nWaiver, which is limited by the State to a certain number of “slots.” They seek to represent other \nindividuals who are similarly threatened with institutionalization as a result of Defendants’ \nproposed cuts in the level of LT-PCS while they wait for waiver services. Plaintiffs and putative \nclass members possess the same legal claim and injury – that their unnecessary \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 33     01/25/11   Page 2 of 10\n\ninstitutionalization violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. The \nclaims of these four individuals have the same essential characteristics as those of the putative \nclass members, arise from the same course of conduct (Defendants’ reduction of the maximum \namount of LT-PCS to 32 hours a week) and share the same legal theory (the claim that reducing \nLT-PCS to a level that would make it impossible for them to safely remain in their homes, which \nviolates the “integration mandate” of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation \nAct). \nPlaintiffs are requesting a reasonable accommodation under which their LT-PCS hours \nwill not be reduced if they can demonstrate that they would otherwise have to enter a nursing \nhome to obtain this care.  Defendants’ recently promulgated system does not allow them to make \nsuch a demonstration.  It provides that no LT-PCS recipient may receive more than 32 hours a \nweek—no matter how acute their need for the additional hours of service, how long it may take \nthem to access other services that can meet this need, and how acute is their risk of \ninstitutionalization if adequate home-based services are not available. \nThis case will not focus on the individual circumstances or defenses to individual claims, \nbecause the named plaintiffs are not seeking to have the Court review the individual situations of \neach class member.  What the plaintiffs are seeking, as a reasonable accommodation, is for the \nState to create a mechanism whereby it will consider class members’ needs for additional \nservices, over and above 32 hours a week, to avoid institutionalization, and provide those services \nif they are necessary to allow them and other class members to remain in the community.  \nThe arguable presence of either individual differences, or what defendants label as \n“unique defenses,” should not defeat class certification here. \nDefendants do not even attempt to identify individual circumstances or “unique defenses” \nthat would defeat named Plaintiff Kenneth Roman’s ability to serve as a class representative \nbased on typicality. \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 33     01/25/11   Page 3 of 10\n\nMoreover, with regards to the other named Plaintiffs, the differences in their \ncircumstances or “defenses” that Defendants attempt to articulate in their memorandum are \ninadequate.  First, they argue that Plaintiff Rickii Ainey’s claim “presents the question of whether \na Medicaid recipient can state a claim under Olmstead after declining placement in a waiver \nprogram that would have provided the services sought in the lawsuit.”  Defendants state that Ms. \nAiney allegedly declined a slot on the Elderly and Disabled Adults Waiver in 2004, and that this \npresents a defense to her Olmstead claims.   \nPlaintiffs submit that events that occurred six or seven years ago to Ms. Ainey are \nirrelevant to her claim that Defendants’ policies are currently placing her at risk of having to enter \na nursing home for care in 2011 that could as easily (and more cheaply) be provided to her in the \ncommunity. As her declaration establishes, her circumstances have significantly changed since \n2004, when Defendants contend that she was offered an EDA waiver slot.  In 2004, she was \nliving with her boyfriend who assisted with her personal care needs. This relationship ended in \n2006, leaving her without natural supports. Exhibit 1, ¶¶18-20. Currently, she has to rely on LT-\nPCS for assistance with all activities of daily living, including bathing, washing her face and hair, \ndressing and undressing, toileting, feminine hygiene, eating and drinking, transferring from any \nsurface to a standing position, moving once in bed, preparing meals, shopping, household chores \nand laundry.2  Exhibit 1, ¶¶2-9,  \nNext, Defendants contend that another named plaintiff, Helen Pitts, never sought an EDA \nwaiver slot prior to the filing of this lawsuit.  They claim that this is a “defense” to her Olmstead \nclaim because she had alternatives to institutionalization that she has not pursued.   \nThe facts are otherwise.  Ms. Pitts has been seeking an EDA waiver slot since at least \n2007. One of Defendant’s attorneys, Michael Coleman, emailed Plaintiff’s counsel on December \n                                                 \n2 Her mother, though she lives near Ms. Ainey, is not a source of support.  She has not helped Ms. Ainey \nsince she was a child.  She has been addicted to drugs for many years, has a criminal record, and refuses to \nassist. Exhibit 1, Declaration of Rickii Ainey, ¶¶8, 10-14; Exhibit 5, Declaration of Carol Congress. \n \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 33     01/25/11   Page 4 of 10\n\n30, 2010, in response to an inquiry, and stated that Ms. Pitts has been on the waiting list for an \nEDA waiver slot since September 5, 2007.  Exhibit 8, Declaration of Nell Hahn ¶¶ 2-4, \nAttachments A-C. \nDefendants next claim that Denise Hodges’ claims are subject to the “unique defense” \nthat she has been offered a slot on the EDA waiver, enabling her to obtain additional hours, and \nthus mooting her Olmstead claim to additional LT-PCS hours. Ms. Hodges’ circumstances are in \nfact typical because she, like most LT-PCS recipients, has applied and is waiting for a slot on the \nEDA waiver.  The only reason that class members are not receiving EDA waiver services is that \nDefendants have not requested sufficient slots from CMS to accommodate all those who need and \nqualify for those services.  Ms. Hodges has been waiting for an EDA waiver slot since September \n11, 2007.  Exhibit 8, ¶¶ 3-4, Attachment C. \n Defendants have not coordinated their programs so that LT-PCS cuts will not take effect \nfor people who have been offered EDA services until those EDA services begin. In connection \nwith Ms. Hodges’ status as a class representative, it is crucial to note that it often takes several \nmonths for persons who have received an offer for an EDA slot to actually receive services.  \nExhibit 7, Declaration of Jeanne Abadie, ¶¶3-5.  As of January 24, 2011, Ms. Hodges did not \nhave a date for her assessment for the EDA waiver.  Id. ¶6. \nPlaintiffs concede that, when Ms. Hodges actually receives the additional services that \nthe EDA waiver can afford, her interest in this action will end.  If this takes place before the \ndistrict court certifies the class, her interest in this action would be moot, and she would not be an \nappropriate class representative.  See Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147 (1975). But Defendants \ndo not contend that Ms. Hodges is actually been provided with services under the EDA waiver, or \nthat these services will actually be in place before her LT-PCS cuts will take effect. She thus \ncurrently continues to possess a live stake in the substantive outcome of the case, see Rocky v. \nKing, 900 F.2d 864, 867 (5th Cir. 1990). \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 33     01/25/11   Page 5 of 10\n\n2.  There are no conflicts between the claims of the named Plaintiffs and those of the putative \nclass. \n \nDefendants point to two sources of conflict between the claims of the named plaintiffs \nand those of members of the putative class, which they contend preclude a finding that the named \nplaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nClass.  First, they contend that at the same time that they imposed the new 32-hour maximum, \nwhich is the sole subject of Plaintiffs’ claims, Defendants changed the priorities of different \ngroups on the waiting list for EDA services, making it easier for LT-PCS recipients to receive \nwaiver services.  If this change in priority groups for the EDA waiver were to be reversed, some \nmembers of the class would suffer and some would benefit. Ergo, Defendants claim, there is a \nconflict between the interests of the named plaintiffs and some members of the class. \nThis argument is specious.  Plaintiffs are not challenging the changes Defendants have \nmade in the order of selection of persons on the EDA waiver waiting list. and there is no reason \nwhy, if they win their challenge to the reduction in maximum hours of LT-PCS, there will have to \nbe a change in priority groups for the EDA waiver.  The order that people on the EDA waiting list \nare given waiver slots is independent of the maximum number of hours in the LT-PCS program.   \nDefendant does not articulate any budgetary or other reason why increasing the \nmaximum number of hours of LT-PCS for people who would otherwise need to be \ninstitutionalized would require DHH to make changes in the waiting list priority for people who \nreceive LT-PCS. Plaintiffs are only challenging the changes in the maximum hours in the LT-\nPCS program, and this does not place them at odds with any other class members. The posited \n“conflict” simply does not exist.  \nThe other “conflict” identified by Defendants is entirely speculative.  Defendants point to \nrapid growth in the LT-PCS program (omitting from that discussion the fact that the program did \nnot come into existence until 2004, as a result of Barthelemy v. Louisiana Department of Health \n  6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 33     01/25/11   Page 6 of 10\n\nand Hospitals, 3 a lawsuit over Louisiana’s utter failure to comply with the integration mandate of \nthe ADA).  They argue and claim  that, “if Defendants are unable to implement the 32-hour \nservices cap and other cost control measures, 4 they will be faced with the difficult decision of \nwhether to eliminate the LT-PCS program entirely.” Thus, they claim, Plaintiffs’ claims conflict \nwith the interests of the class. \nIf Defendants were to eliminate the LT-PCS program entirely, they would still face a \nchallenge under the Americans with Disabilities Act, but the class would be much larger than \nonly those people face institutionalization if they cannot obtain more than 32 hours of services.  \nNumerous courts have clearly held that a state violates the ADA if it requires people to go into \ninstitutions to receive the same services they could receive in the community. See, e.g. Fisher v. \nOkla. Health Care Auth., 335 F.3d 1175, 1180-81 (10th Cir. 2003); Townsend v. Qasim, 328 F.3d \n511, 523 (9th Cir. 2003); Radaszewski ex rel. Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. \n2004); V.L. v. Wagner, 669 F. Supp. 1106, 1120 (N.D. Cal. 2009); Crabtree v. Goetz, 2008 WL \n5330506 (Dec. 19, 2008).  \nDefendants’ argument that the 32-hour cap is essential to the existence of the entire LT-\nPCS program, is one of the ultimate issues to be decided on the merits.  The Court must decide \nwhether the relief that Plaintiffs are requesting constitutes a “reasonable modification” in the \nprogram, or whether it would entail a “fundamental alteration”  of the State’s services and \nprograms.  But it is not appropriate to decide that ultimate legal issue at the class certification \nphase of the proceedings.  \n                                                 \n3 see 2001 WL 1254859 (E.D. La. Oct. 18, 2001) (order approving settlement agreement); 2003 WL \n1733534 (E.D. La. Mar. 31, 2003) (order approving modifications to settlement agreement); 2007 WL \n4589885 (E.D. La. Dec. 28, 2007) (granting in part Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce settlement agreement and \nextending term of agreement);  294 Fed.Appx. 94 (5th Cir. 2008) (denying reconsideration of attorneys’ fee \norder). \n \n4 Defendants do not identify the “other cost control measures” that they claim are vital to the existence of \nthe program.  Whatever they may be, they are not implicated by this action. \n  7 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 33     01/25/11   Page 7 of 10\n\n“Nothing in either the language or the history of Rule 23 gives a court any authority to \nconduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be \nmaintained as a class action.”  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. at 177; Walker v. Jim \nDandy Co., 638 F.2d 1330, 1334 (5th Cir. 1981); Colorado Cross Disability Coalition v. Taco \nBell, 184 F.R.D. 357 (certifying class of people with disabilities in ADA case); Thrope v. Ohio, \n173 F.R.D. at 488 (same). An argument that a finding for Plaintiffs on the merits could lead to the \ncomplete elimination of the LT-PCS program is not the type of conflict that would render the \nnamed plaintiffs inadequate representatives of the class of persons similarly affected by \nDefendants’ proposed cuts. \nDefendants’ attempt to identify groups of putative class members that would oppose the \nrelief Plaintiffs seek in this lawsuit – those who receive less than 32 hours of service; those who \ncurrently receive more than 32 hours but who could continue to live in their homes with less than \n32 hours of service; and future recipients of the service – ignores that the proposed class includes \nonly those LT-PCS recipients who are at risk of institutionalization because of Defendants’ cut in \nthe maximum level of services.  Defendants point to no conflict between the named Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the class they seek to represent. \n3. Plaintiffs do not object to a modification of the proposed class definition, though they do not \nagree with Defendants’ proposed definition. \n \nPlaintiffs agree with one of Defendants’ contentions regarding the breadth of the class \ndefinition.  It is true that Defendants’ rules permit an individual who can establish that he or she \nneeds at least 32 hours of LT-PCS in order to avoid entering a nursing home to receive 32 hours a \nweek. See La. Admin. Code Title 50, § 12901(D); Louisiana Register v. 36 no. 8, p. 1749 (Aug. \n20, 2010). Therefore, there is no reason for the class definition to include individuals who do not \nclaim that they need more than 32 hours a week of service.   \nPlaintiffs do not agree to limit the class to persons whose needs can be met with less than \n42 hours of LT-PCS.  They do note that Defendants’ program rules have contained an inflexible \n  8 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 33     01/25/11   Page 8 of 10\n\n42-hour limitation since March 1, 2009. Louisiana Register, v. 35, no. 1 (January 2009) pp. 32–\n34.  However, if exceptions have been made to those limits, persons who have been receiving \nadequate LT-PCS through such exceptions, and whose continued existence in the community is \nthreatened by the proposed cut to 32 hours, share the named plaintiffs interest and claims and \nshould be included in the class.  \nThe remaining modifications that Defendants suggest are subsumed within the class \ndefinition proposed by plaintiffs: that the class includes those who are at risk of being forced to \nenter a nursing home because of Defendants plan to reduce the level of community-based LT-\nPCS services.  The emphasis Defendants seek to place on alternative sources of care are \nunnecessary and argumentative. \n4.  Plaintiffs do not object to the dismissal of their due process claims without prejudice. \n  In Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Response to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, they concede \nthat their due process claims may be premature.  They do not object to the dismissal of these \nclaims without prejudice. \nPlaintiffs do not object to Defendants’ submission of affidavits to counter \nPlaintiffs’ evidence.  Plaintiffs request that, upon final hearing of this Motion, this Court grant \ntheir motion for class certification. \nDate:  January 25, 2011. \n \n            Respectfully submitted,  \n            /s/ Nell Hahn         \n            Nell Hahn, T.A. \n            LA Bar No. 22406 \n            Advocacy Center \n            600 Jefferson St., Suite 812 \n            Lafayette, LA 70501 \n            (337) 237-7380, ext. 11 \n            Facsimile (337) 205-6166 \n            nhahn@advocacyla.org \n \n             \n            Stephen F.

P ursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23, t he  Parties  hereby  move  for \npreliminary approval of the settlement of this  action, approval of the notice plan, and the \nredefinition of the class. \nI.  Preliminary Approval of the Settlement Agreement \nThe Parties seek preliminary approval of their proposed Settlement Agreement, a \ncopy of which is being filed as Exhibit 1 to this motion.  A brief outline of the most significant \nterms of the agreement follows; the terms of the attached Settlement Agreement are controlling \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 95     01/11/12   Page 1 of 8\n\nin the event of any inconsistency and/or omission.  The Parties share the view that the terms of \nthe Settlement Agreement are “fair, reasonable, and adequate.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). \nThe Settlement Agreement calls for a redefinition of the class so that the class is \ndefined as individuals who were approved for more than 32 hours of LT-PCS when Defendants \nbegan applying the 32-hour cap on September 5, 2010, a nd who are either still approved to \nreceive LT-PCS or have a request for prior authorization pending or in process. This issue is \ndiscussed in greater detail below. See Part III. \nUnder  the  Settlement  Agreement,  the  Department  of  Health  and  Hospitals \n(“DHH”) will accept for review a request for an expedited Community Choice waiver slot from \nany member of the redefined class (hereinafter “class members”). DHH will grant requests for \nexpedited waiver slots if class members show that they will have a decline in mental or physical \nhealth and are at serious risk of nursing facility placement in the absence of an expedited waiver \noffer.  Certain class members (those who are not currently approved for exactly 32 hours of LT-\nPCS a week) must request an expedited waiver slot by June 30, 2012, in order to have the request \nconsidered.   \nThe Settlement Agreement describes how class members will be notified of the \nopportunity to request an expedited waiver slot, describes the standard DHH will apply in \ndetermining whether to grant a request, and states that DHH has discretion to provide individuals \nwho request a slot with interim relief on a case-by-case basis.  The Settlement Agreement \nprovides  that  any  class  member  whose  request  is  received  before  June  30, 2012 a nd  is \nsubsequently denied may administratively appeal the denial, the deadline for appeals, and the \nshowing that the class member must make on appeal.  Under the Settlement Agreement, DHH \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 95     01/11/12   Page 2 of 8\n\nwill provide periodic reports to Plaintiffs’ counsel about the sending of notices to class members, \nand the status and resolution of class members’ requests for expedited waiver slots. \nThe Settlement Agreement further provides that DHH will submit to the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services an amendment to increase the number of slots in the \nCommunity Choice waiver by 200, to a total of 4,803.  O nce approved, the new slots will \ninitially be reserved exclusively for class members but will be added to the general pool of slots \navailable to other individuals on the Community Choice waiver’s waiting list on December 31, \n2012, if not sooner. \nRelief is specified in the proposed Settlement Agreement for the named plaintiffs \nand for other individuals about whom evidence has already been presented in this case. The \nSettlement Agreement also provides for a payment of $250,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs and \ndescribes the circumstances in which Class Counsel may collect additional attorneys’ fees for \nobtaining enforcement of the Settlement Agreement. \nThe  Settlement  Agreement  provides  for  this  Court’s  enforcement  of  the \nAgreement during a defined period and describes the preclusive effect of the Agreement.   \nII.  Notice to Class Members \nRule 23(e)(1) requires that the Court “direct notice in a reasonable manner to all \nclass members who would be bound by the proposal.”   \nThe Parties have agreed to cause the Notice—substantially in the form attached \nhereto as Exhibit 2—to be published in certain Louisiana newspapers no later than fifteen (15) \ndays before the Final Approval Hearing.  The Parties shall, at or before the Final Approval \nHearing, file with the Court proof of publication of the Notice. \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 95     01/11/12   Page 3 of 8\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, the Settlement Agreement provides that DHH will \nsend a copy of Attachment B to the Settlement Agreement to all class members to whom DHH \nhas not already mailed a copy of Attachment A to the Settlement Agreement. \nIII.  Modification of the Class Definition \nContingent upon the Court’s preliminary approval of the proposed Settlement \nAgreement, the Parties additionally request a modification of the class definition.  An order \ncertifying a cl ass may  be altered or amended  before final judgment.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(c)(1)(C).  “[T]his rule vests significant discretion in the district court,” Gene & Gene, L.L.C. \nv. BioPay, L.L.C., 624 F.3d 698, 703 (5th Cir. 2010).  “[A] district court is free to reconsider its \nclass certification ruling as often as necessary before judgment,” McNamara v. Felderhof, 410 \nF.3d 277, 280 (5th Cir. 2005), and indeed, is “required to reassess [its] class rulings as the case \ndevelops,” Boucher v. Syracuse Univ., 164 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir. 1999), quoted in id. at 280 n.8.  \nNotification of unnamed class members excluded from the new definition is not required.  See \nBernard v. Gulf Oil Corp., 890 F.2d 735 (5th Cir. 1989). \nOn June 6, 2011, the Court certified a class and adopted the following class \ndefinition: \nLouisiana residents with disabilities who have been receiving \nMedicaid-funded services through the LT-PCS program; who \ndesire to reside in the community instead of a nursing facility; who \nrequire more than 32 hours of Medicaid-funded personal care \nservices per week in order to avoid entering a nursing facility, and \nwho do not have available (including through family supports, \nshared living arrangements, or enrollment in the ADHC waiver) \nother means of receiving personal care services. \n(Doc. 58, at 5-6) \nAs part of the proposed Settlement Agreement, the Parties are requesting that the \nCourt modify the definition of the class to read as follows: \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 95     01/11/12   Page 4 of 8\n\nAll persons who were approved to receive more than 32 hours of \nservices through Louisiana’s Long-Term Personal Case Services \n(LT-PCS) program as of September 5, 2010, and who are still \napproved to receive LT-PCS or who have a request for prior \nauthorization pending or in process. \nThe parties’ proposed definition likely includes some individuals who would not \nbe considered class members under the June 6 definition of the class (e.g., LT-PCS recipients \nwho used to receive over 32 hours of Medicaid-funded personal care services per week but do \nnot require that level of services in order to avoid entering a nursing facility).  At the same time, \nthe  proposed  definition  likely  excludes  some  individuals  who  would  be  considered  class \nmembers under the June 6 definition (e.g., future class members and individuals who have never \nreceived more than 32 hours per week of LT-PCS). \nExtending the scope of the class in the manner contemplated by the Settlement \nAgreement holds no possibility of prejudice for the additional individuals included.  These are, \nby definition, individuals who do not require more than 32 hours of Medicaid-funded personal \ncare services per week in order to avoid entering a nursing facility.  They cannot be prejudiced \nby inclusion in the class settlement, which provides relief, and encompasses claims for additional \nservices, for people who can show that they do require services in excess of 32 hours per week. \nSimilarly, restricting the scope of the class does not prejudice the rights of persons \nwho were formerly members of the class, because their claims have not been affected and are in \nno way precluded by the Settlement Agreement. \nThe  Parties  agree  that  redefining  the  class  will  facilitate  settlement  and \nimplementation of the Settlement Agreement.  The new definition makes the membership of the \nclass determinate and finite.  With the new definition, the Parties will have greater certainty \nabout the composition of the class for purposes of ensuring that class members benefit from the \nrelief provided under the settlement agreement. \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 95     01/11/12   Page 5 of 8\n\nIV.

How many LT-PCS recipients will be placed at risk of institutionalization as the result of the \nreduction of maximum hours of LT-PCS from 42 to 32? \n2.  What would be the cost to the State be of providing LT-PCS hours in excess of the 32-hour \nmaximum to those LT-PCS recipients who will be placed at risk of institutionalization as the \nresult of the reduction of the maximum to 32?  \n3.  What would be the cost to the State be of providing nursing facility services to those LT-PCS \nrecipients who will be institutionalized as the result of the reduction of the maximum to 32?  \n4.  Whether providing LT-PCS hours in excess of the 32-hour maximum to persons who will be \nat risk of institutionalization is a reasonable accommodation, given the costs of providing \nnursing facility services to those persons? \n5.  Whether Defendants have a “comprehensive effectively working plan” for preventing \nMedicaid recipients who need long term care that can appropriately be provided to them in \ntheir homes and communities, from having to enter nursing facilities to receive that care.  \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38-1     03/14/11   Page 1 of 3\n\n6.  Whether Defendants have actually available alternative services to prevent the \ninstitutionalization of those LT-PCS recipients who will be placed at risk of \ninstitutionalization as the result of the reduction of maximum hours of LT-PCS from 42 to 32,  \ngiven the waiting lists and geographic restrictions that presently exist for potential alternative \nservices. \n7.  Whether Defendants have adequate services, other than LT-PCS, so that persons with severe \ndisabilities will be able to avoid nursing home placement by promptly receiving adequate \nMedicaid personal care services in their homes and communities. \n8.  Whether Defendants’ actions  in reducing funding for home- and community-based services, \nwhile increasing funding to nursing facility services, in the face of increased participation in \nhome- and community-based programs and declining participation in nursing facility \nservices, violates its plan for placing qualified persons with disabilities in less restrictive \nsettings.  \n9.  Whether the reduction in LT-PCS to a maximum of 32 hours a week without any exceptions \nadheres to or significantly departs from Defendant’s plan for long term care services. .  \n10. Whether Defendants waiting lists for Medicaid services in the community are moving at \nreasonable pace. \n11. Whether Defendants’ budget cuts fall disproportionately on people attempting to remain in \ntheir own homes and communities while receiving care. \n12. Whether the State’s reduction of services impacts disproportionately on people with the most \nsevere disabilities. \n13.  Whether the State intentionally discriminates against people who wish to remain in the own \nhomes and communities by increasing the nursing home/institutional  Medical Assistance per \ndiem reimbursements while reducing the Medical Assistance for community-based services.  \n14. Whether the reduction of LT-PCS services was motivated in whole or in part by the State’s \ndesire to maintain compensation levels for providers of nursing facility services at the \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38-1     03/14/11   Page 2 of 3\n\nexpense of services in the community. \nDate:  March 9, 2011. \n \n            Respectfully submitted,  \n            /s/ Nell Hahn         \n            Nell Hahn, T.A. \n            LA Bar No. 22406 \n            Advocacy Center \n            600 Jefferson St., Suite 812 \n            Lafayette, LA 70501 \n            (337) 237-7380, ext. 11 \n            Facsimile (337) 205-6166 \n            nhahn@advocacyla.org \n \n             \n            Stephen F.

RIEDLINGER \n*   \n            *  CLASS ACTION \n \nJOINT MOTION FOR ORDER APPROVING CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT \nAND ORDERING COMPLIANCE  \n \n  The parties seek approval of the Settlement Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit \n1, pursuant to Rule 23(e), Fed. R. Civ. Pro. and an order that the parties comply with its \nterms.  In support of this motion, the parties would show the Court: \n  1.  For the reasons set forth in the attached Memorandum, the parties assert that \nthe proposed Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.  \n  2.  The Settlement Agreement is expressly conditioned on this Court’s entering an \norder requiring the parties to comply with the terms of the Agreement. \n  3.  The class has been given notice of the Settlement Agreement through \npublication of notice in eight Louisiana newspapers prior to January 30, 2012. \n  4.  The Settlement Agreement further provides for the acceptance by Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel of the sum of $250,000 for attorneys’ fees and costs for work done through the \ndate of final approval of the Settlement Agreement, provided that the Court enters an \norder requiring Defendants to pay this amount to Plaintiffs’ counsel within ten days of the \nCourt’s final approval of the Settlement Agreement.  Plaintiffs’ counsel will provide \nappropriate W-9 forms to Defendants’ counsel to facilitate payment. \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 100     02/15/12   Page 1 of 4\n\n  5.  The class was been given notice of this provision of the Settlement Agreement \nin the publication notice described above. \n  6.  The attached declarations and exhibits show that the lodestar sought by \nPlaintiffs’ counsel was $374,000, made up of the following amounts for the work of the \nattorneys and paralegals for the Plaintiff class: \n  Hours  Hourly rate  Lodestar \nNell Hahn  621.45  $300  $186,435 \nJeanne Abadie  518.60  $75  $ 38,895 \n(paralegal) \n \nKen Zeller  39.30  $450  $17,640 \nStephen F. Gold  217.26  $585  $128,760 \n   \n  7.  This lodestar understates the number of hours actually spent by Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel, because it includes no work done after December 22, 2011, even though \nconsiderable additional work was performed by class counsel after that date. \n  8.  The attached declarations and exhibits also show the qualifications and \nexperience of Plaintiffs’ counsel.  They show that the amount of fees for plaintiffs’ \ncounsel established by the agreement was arrived at after substantially reducing the \nnumber of hours compensated. After exercising billing judgment to eliminate hours that \nwere duplicative, excessive, or otherwise not compensable, plaintiffs’ counsel calculated \na lodestar amount.  The lump sum counsel eventually agreed to represents less than 70% \nof this substantially-reduced amount. \n  WHEREFORE the parties request that this Court enter an Order approving the \nSettlement Agreement, ordering the parties to comply with its terms.  \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 100     02/15/12   Page 2 of 4\n\nDATED:  February 15, 2012       Respectfully submitted, \n/s/ Nell Hahn \nNell Hahn, T.A. \nLA Bar No. 22406 \nAdvocacy Center \n600 Jefferson St., Suite 812 \nLafayette, LA 70501 \n(337) 237-7380, ext. 311 \nFacsimile (337) 237-0486 \nnhahn@advocacyla.org \n \nStephen F.

Introduction \nAt issue in this case is whether Defendant s, the Louisiana Department of Health \nand  Hospitals and its Secretary (collectively,   “the Departm ent”  or  “DHH”),  violated the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) when they reduced from 42 to 32 hours per week the \nmaximum amount of services available to participants in the Long Term Personal Care Services \n(“LT-PCS”) program. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs—four individuals who currently receive \nservices in excess of the new  maximum—have failed to show th at the 32-hour cap constitutes \ndiscrimination under the ADA, as it was construed in  Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), \nand, in any event, have dem anded changes to  the Department’s programs that go beyond the \n“reasonable accommodation” required by law. \nWith respect to whether the 32-hour cap on LT-PCS is discriminatory, Defendants \nbelieve the following facts are material and dispositive: \nA.  There  are other program s  (with varying wait tim es  and geographical \navailability) that, alone or in conjunction with LT-PCS, can provide additional \nassistance to someone with Plaintiffs’ needs. \nB.  If Plaintiffs are in fact admitted to a nursing facility, they will have pr iority \naccess to these other services. \nIn support of their alternat ive argument that Louisiana  has a com prehensive, \neffectively  working plan for placing qualifie d  Medicaid beneficiaries in the community, \nDefendants believe the relevant inquiry is results: the State’s overall record in allocating its \nlimited budget to provide a range of institutional and community-based alternatives. To that end, \nDefendants submit that the following facts are relevant and dispositive: \nDC: 3935130-1  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 6 of 46\n\n \nC.  Defendants’ home and community-based services, including LT-PCS, serve \nan  increasing num ber  of individuals   every year, while the population of \nnursing homes steadily declines. \nD.  Defendants  have seen no increase in   the n umber  of LT-PCS recipien ts \ntransitioning  to nursing facilities  since  they adopted the 32-hour cap in \nSeptember; this is consistent with the Department’s prior experience when the \nmaximum was reduced from 56 to 42 hours per week. \nBy contrast, Plaintiffs’ position, as articulated in their Opposition and Statement \nof Disputed Facts, is that the ADA requires an  exhaustive inquiry as to the number of hours of \ncare each individual needs in order to receive adequate assistance in his or her home; predictions \nas to how many individuals will enter nursing homes under a service limitation; a value-inflected \njudgment  as to whether the ch allenged  service m aximum  is “n ecessary”;  a comparison of  \nexpenditures in various service  settings, including whether those  services could be provided \nmore  efficiently;  and  an inqu iry  into  the  motivations  of  state  policymakers  in  making \ndeterminations as to how best to allocate Medicaid resources. \nIn short, Defendants ask the Court to  grant summary judgment based on the \nprogram they have and the outcom es that the current program has produced. Plaintiffs ask the \nCourt to proceed to trial to m ake individual service determinations and to decid e whether the \nState could afford to implem ent some alternative program that might better suit the needs of \nparticular individuals. As set forth below, this  is not a proper inquiry under the ADA, and the \nmotion for summary judgment should be granted. \n2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 7 of 46\n\n \nII.  Statement of Facts \nA.  LT-PCS Is Not Defendants’ Only HCBS Program. \nAs set forth in the background to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (which has been \nconverted to a motion for summary judgment), the State of Louisiana is committed to dedicating \navailable resources to provide individuals with disabilities a full array of quality, long-term care \nservices  that will enab le  them  to enjoy fu ll  lives of inclusion, p roductivity,  and self-\ndetermination in the settings of their choice. In furtherance of that goal, the State currently has  \nseveral programs that provide hom e-and community-based services (“HCBS”) for  individuals \nwith  disabilities, including the Adult Day He alth  Care (“ADHC”) wa iver,  the Elderly and  \nDisabled Adult (“EDA”) waiver,  the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (“PACE”), \nand LT-PCS. Defs.’ Statem ent of Undisputed Facts in Support of  the Motion for Summary \nJudgment ¶4 (“SUF”). \nADHC services are provided at licensed facilities that are operational at least five \nhours per day on a regularly scheduled basis or as  specified in the recipient’s plan of care. SUF \n¶84. In addition to personal care services, ADHC  facilities must provide transportation to and \nfrom the facility; counseling and  education in the areas of heal th and nutrition; individualized \nexercise and recreation programs; nursing services; medical care management; and one hot meal \nand two snacks per day. SUF ¶¶85, 90. LT-PCS reci pients can supplement their benefits with \nservices  offered through the ADHC waiver. SU F  ¶33. There is currently a short wait of \napproximately 5 months, but there is no wait fo r someone who has recently had an overnigh t \nhospital stay. SUF ¶95. \nThe State also provides long-term care to individuals with adult-onset disabilities \nthrough the EDA waiver. In lieu of an hourly ca p on services, the EDA program  provides each \nparticipant with a needs-based “budget” of up to $40,046 per year. S UF ¶54-55. The enrollee \n3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 8 of 46\n\n \nmay  allocate the budget toward a variety of   services, which currently include support \ncoordination, transition intensive su pport coordination, environmental accessibility adaptation, \npersonal assistance services (a combination of personal care services  and companion care), \ntransition services, and ADHC services. See La. Admin. Code tit. 50, § 8301, 37 La. Reg. 18, 19-\n20  (Jan. 20 11);  SUF ¶57. This su mmer,  the EDA waiver will be replaced   with a new \n“Community Choice” waiver that will offer a more  comprehensive package of services and will \nallow recipients greater flexibility to self-direct their care. SUF ¶¶105-108. \nThe EDA waiver has a capped num ber of slots and currently has a waiting list \n(called the “Request for Services Registry”). SUF ¶¶59-60. As slots open up, priority is given to \nindividuals who have been abus ed or neglected, individuals w ith Lou Gehrig’s disease, and \nindividuals in nursing facilities. See La. Admin. Code tit. 50, § 8105(B), 37 La. Reg. 18, 19 (Jan. \n2011). As of March 29, 2011, every individual on th e EDA Registry who was in one of these \npriority groups had already received an offer. SUF ¶64. \nAlthough individuals cannot receive LT-PCS and EDA services at the same time, \nthey can continue to receive LT-PCS while they are on the waiting list for the EDA waiver. SUF \n¶¶33, 72. Until October 2010, applicants who did not  currently receive any HCBS were given \npriority over LT-PCS recipients. See La. Admin. Code tit. 50, § 8105(B), 35 La. Reg. 2447, 2447 \n(Nov. 2009). Now the two groups are treated the same, and both are offered EDA slots according \nto the date of application. See 36 La. Reg. 2217, 2218 (Oct. 2010) (amending id.). \nWhile individuals who are not in one of  the priority groups may wait longer than \ntwo years before being  offered EDA services,1 many individuals put their nam e on the EDA \n                                                 \n1 Before DHH revised the priority groups, the State was offering EDA slots to individuals who requested \nEDA services on or before April 15, 2008. SUF ¶70. LT-PCS recipients who had requested EDA services \n(continued…) \n4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 9 of 46\n\n \nRegistry at the time they apply to be assessed for LT-PCS. In fact, all of the named plaintiffs in \nthe current action are on the EDA Registry, and so far, two Plaintiffs (Denise Hodges and Helen \nPitts)2 and the only unnamed class member identified by Plaintiffs (Cleo Lancaster) have already \nreceived EDA offers. SUF ¶73. \nFinally, Defendants also have two PACE programs, serving the Baton Rouge and \nNew Orleans areas. SUF ¶109. While both of these programs also have limited enrollment, both \nare currently accepting new enrollees. SUF ¶112. (None of the na med plaintiffs live in these \nareas and meet the PACE eligibility criteria, but other members of the purported class might.) \nB.  Individuals in Nursing Facilities Have a Community Alternative. \nAs mentioned above, the EDA and ADHC waiv ers give priority to individuals in \nnursing facilities. Recently, DHH adopted a rule limiting priority offers to individuals who have \nbeen in a nursing facility for 90 c onsecutive days. See 36 La. Reg. at 2218 (am ending La. \nAdmin. Code tit. 50, § 8105(B)).3 This was to address the situation where some individuals were \nonly in need of nursing home care for a short period (for exam ple, rehabilitation after a hospital \nstay) or were trying to avoid the waiting list by entering a nursing home for a brief stay and then \n                                                 \nbefore that date did not get an offer but remained  on the Registry. SUF ¶71. The State ha s since begun \ngiving offers to this group of LT-PCS r ecipients. The State most recently offered EDA slots to LT-PCS \nrecipients who applied for the EDA waiver by November 30, 2007. SUF ¶72. \n2 Defendants wish to correct the st atement in their Memorandum in Opposition to Class  Certification \n(ECF No. 32), that “DHH records indicate that M s. Pitts never sought an ED A waiver slot prior to the \nfiling of this lawsuit.” Id. at 4. This statement was based on Hugh Eley’s declaration of October 21, 2010, \nin which he stated that “Ms. Pitts is not on the Registry for EDA services.” (ECF No. 11-2, ¶21) Although \nMr. Eley’s declaration was correct at the time, after subsequent discussions with Plaintiffs’ counsel, DHH \ndetermined that Ms. Pitts may have called regarding the EDA waiver in 2007  but was not placed on the \nRegistry either because she had not subsequently returned the required paperwork or because of an error \nonce her paperwork was r eceived. As a result, Department personnel manually added Ms. Pitts to t he \nEDA Registry with a request date of September 5, 2007. \n3 There was no length-of-stay requirement under the old rule. See La. Admin. Code tit. 50, § 8105(B)(2), \n35 La. Reg. 2447, 2447 (Nov. 2009). \n5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 10 of 46\n\n \nreturning home to wait for their EDA offer. SUF  ¶75. The agency determined that a “length of \nstay” requirement would close this loophole and  reserve priority offers for nursing facility  \nresidents who truly needed EDA services in or der to transition back into the community. DHH \nconcluded that 90 days was an appropriate length of stay because that is the standard used by the \nfederal government in the Money Follows the Pers on Program to determine who is at risk of \nbeing a long-term resident of a nursing facility. SUF ¶76;  see also 42 U.S.C. § 1396a note, as \namended, Patient Protection and A ffordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, §  2403, 124 Stat. \n119, 304-05 (Mar. 23, 2010).4 \nDHH adopted the new policy after several  discussions with the HCBS Redesign \nWorkgroup. SUF ¶77. The W orkgroup included officials from DHH and several stakeholder \nadvocacy groups—including the Advocacy Center —and was intended to solicit these groups’ \ninput on changes to the State’s HCBS offerings. SUF ¶78. The consensus of the Workgroup was \nthat DHH should revise its policy, SUF ¶79, and that a 90-day period was appropriate, SUF ¶80. \nC.  Defendants’ home and community-based  services, including LT-PCS, serve \nan  increasing  number of individ uals  every  year, w hile  the population of \nnursing homes steadily declines. \nOver the last decade, L ouisiana has taken significant steps to provide a greater \narray of long-term care service options for i ndividuals with different needs. In SFY 2000, \nLouisiana served 34,727 individuals in private nu rsing facilities while providing HCBS to only \n1,030 people. SUF ¶8. As of SFY 2010, the num ber of individuals receiving private nursing \nfacility services dropped to 29,392—a decrease of over  15% in ten years. SUF ¶¶10, 14. 5 As a \n                                                 \n4 Additionally, DHH does not approve stays of over 90 days based solely on the need for rehabilitation-\nrelated services. \n5 While the State also operates two public nursing facilities serving approximately 250 individuals, those \nhomes tend to serve very high needs patients who are hard to place in a private facility and whose needs \n(continued…) \n6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 11 of 46\n\n \nresult, while Louisiana remains among the States with the highest number of nursing home beds \nper capita, SUF ¶17, its nursing faci lities now have nearly the lowest occupancy rate in th e \ncountry. SUF ¶18. Meanwhile, the gr owth in the number of HCBS recipients far outpaced the \ndrop in nursing facility recipients. The State’s HCBS programs served 18,215 individuals in SFY \n2010, an increase of 1668% since SFY 2000 and of 224% since SFY 2005. SUF ¶¶10, 13. \nThe growth in the State’s HCBS populat ion has been accompanied by a shift in \nexpenditures  toward HCBS. In SFY 2010, t he  State  was devoting 29% of long-term   care \nexpenditures to HCBS. SUF ¶22. Between  SFY 2005 and SFY 2010, expenditures on HCBS \nincreased by 277.5% while expenditu res on private nursing facil ities grew by approxim ately \n18%. SUF ¶25. According to Plaintiffs’ expert  witness, once expenditures are adjusted for \ninflation, nursing facilities have seen a decrease  in per capita expenditures over the last decade. \nPls.’ Exh. 25, Declaration of H. Stephen Kaye, at ¶12 (ECF No. 38-3, page 407 of 455). \nThe lion’s share of the growth in HCBS recipients and expenditures has been due \nto the LT-PCS program. Unlike the EDA and ADH C waiver programs, LT-PCS is a Medicaid \nstate plan service, which m eans that the Stat e cannot cap enrollm ent. LT-PCS is an optional \nMedicaid benefit, but once a State  decides to offer the benefit, it must be made available to any \nMedicaid recipient that meets the criteria for enrollment. \nThe number of LT-PCS recipients has increased substantially every year since the \nprogram began: from 1,402 in SF Y 2005 to mo re than 12,000 today, SUF ¶28, the LT-PCS \n                                                 \nlikely could not be met in an HCBS option. Second Decl. of Hugh R. Eley, at ¶30. Therefore, they are not \nincluded in the data. \n7 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 12 of 46\n\n \npopulation has increased by nearly 800% in only five years. SUF ¶29. 6 Enrollment continues to \nincrease by approximately 130 people every month. SUF ¶31. \nNot surprisingly, the increase in recipients has been accompanied by a staggering \nincrease in expenditures. Since SFY 2005, expenditures on LT-PCS have grown by over 600% to \n$237,616,920 in SFY 2010. SUF ¶35. LT-PCS was the fastest growing Medicaid service in three \nof the last five fiscal years, and only one line  item in the State’s entir e Medicaid budget grew \nfaster over the entire five-year period. SUF ¶26.7 The program’s future growth is expected to be \nsignificant as a result of the aging state popula tion and the expansion of  Medicaid eligibility \nunder the Affordable Care Act. SUF ¶31.8 \nFaced with this growth, the policy of DHH is “to serve th e greatest number of \npeople that [it] can serve given  the funding that is available.”  SUF ¶7. In keeping with that \npolicy, DHH decided to reduce the cap on LT-PCS se rvices from 42 hours per week to 32 hours \nper  week. SUF ¶43. DHH has estim ated  that the  32-hour  cap will allow it to avoid new \nexpenditures  of approxim ately  $5 m illion  annually  in SFY 2011 and another $24 m illion \nannually in SFY 2012. SUF ¶36. \nThis is no way signals a retreat from the State’s commitment to providing choice \nin long-term care services. The State has initiated new programs to help individuals move from \n                                                 \n6 These statistics refer to the number of individuals who received LT-PCS but neither ADHC nor EDA. \nSUF ¶28. Currently, individuals can receive  both LT-PCS and ADHC. S UF ¶33. Previously, EDA \nparticipants received personal care services through the LT-PCS program; now such services are paid for \nwith the waiver budget. See SUF ¶32. \n7 The exception was the public psychiatric free standing unit, and those expenditures pale in comparison \nto LT-PCS. SUF ¶26. \n8 The EDA and ADHC wai vers have also seen significant increases in recipients and expenditures since  \nSFY 2000, although the capped nature of those programs means that the growth is more predictable and \ncontrolled than is the expansion of LT-PCS. See SUF ¶¶ 81, 92, 96. \n8 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 13 of 46\n\n \nnursing homes into the community. In 2007, Louisiana successfully applied for a federal grant \nunder the Money Follows the Person (“MFP”)  program. SUF ¶99. Under the MFP program, \nStates qualify for a higher percentage of federa l matching dollars to help cover the costs of \nmoving people out of nursing hom es. SUF ¶100. Louisiana also uses MFP grant m oney to \nengage in outreach to nursing facility residents and to hire staff who can identify those residents \nwho want to move into the community. SUF ¶100. The MFP program also  provides recipients \nwith transition-related services. These include assistance in finding a residence, paying a rental \ndeposit, and identifying an HCBS provider.  SUF ¶101. Once an ind ividual transitions to the \ncommunity, they can receive long term  care through one or more of the State’s several HCBS \nprograms. SUF ¶102. The MFP program  successfully helped 80 individuals tran sition out of \nnursing facilities between November 2009 and February 2011, and another 100 to 120 transitions \nwere pending. SUF ¶103. Many others m ade the transition without the assistance of the MFP \ngrant. SUF ¶104. \nPart of Louisiana’s strategy for serving a  greater percentage of individuals with \nadult-onset disabilities in the community involv es reducing the supply o f institutional services. \nSUF ¶117. To that end, Louisiana  has instituted a “Bed Buyback  Program” that has led to the  \nelimination of 461 nursing hom e beds from the market since July 2008 and to the perm anent \nclosure of 4 nursing facilities. SUF ¶¶118-119. Going forward, the State expects this program to \nlead to the elimination of 2 nursing facilities per year and an average of 115 to 144 beds pe r \nfacility. SUF ¶120. For each facility closed un der this program, the State expects to incur new \ncosts for five years but then see savings of $378,706 per year thereafter. SUF ¶121. Additionally, \nthe State established a Private Room Conve rsion Program in 2007. SUF ¶122. The program \ngives nursing facilities a financial incentive to convert semi-private Medicaid rooms into private \n9 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 14 of 46\n\n \nrooms and, in doing so, eliminate nursing home beds from the market. So far the program has led \nto the closure of 310 beds. SUF ¶123. \nD.  There Is No Evidence that the Imposi tion of the 32-Hour Maximum Will \nLead to an Increase in Nursing Home Admissions. \nThe LT-PCS program has always had a limit on the number of hours of personal \ncare any individual could receive in a given week. From its inception in 2005 until March 2009, \nthe LT-PCS program provided up to 56 hours  per week of Medicaid -funded personal care \nservices. SUF ¶37. In March 2009, the cap was reduced to 42 hours per week.  See 35 La. Reg. \n401, 402 (Mar. 2009) (amending La. Admin. Code tit. 50, § 12915(A)).9 Effective September 5, \n2010, the cap became 32 hours per week.  See 36 La. Reg. 1749, 1752 (Aug. 2010) (am ending \nLa. Admin. Code tit. 50, § 12915(A)). Both reductions in the se rvice cap were accompanied by \nchanges to the m ethod for allocating hours among  recipients so that the distribution would \naccount for the new cap and better re flect recipients’ relative acuity. See Opp’n at 18-19. DHH \nhas closely monitored the effects of these chan ges to the LT-PCS program. SUF ¶46. In neither \ninstance has the agency observed an uptick in the rate at which LT-PCS recipients transition into \nnursing facilities. SUF ¶47-52. \nThere were 941 LT-PCS participants who received more than 42 hours of services \nper week before the 42-hour cap took effect and  received fewer than 42 hours afterwards. SUF \n                                                 \n9 The State reduced the cap on LT-PCS  hours to 42 in order to bring the EDA waiver into co mpliance \nwith  federal  laws r egarding  waiver “ cost  effectiveness.”  Opp’n  at 18. This servic e  reduction  was \ndiscussed with class counsel in the Barthelemy litigation, including lead counsel in the  Pitts case. SUF \n¶39. Class counsel agreed to the reduc tion, which was incorporated into  the Barthelemy settlement \nagreement. SUF ¶40. Plaintiffs included the initial  Barthelemy Settlement Agreement and the First \nSupplemental Settlement Agreement as Exhibits 14 a nd 15 in their summary judgment materials. (ECF \nNo. 38-3, pages 297 and 334 of 455)  Defendants are attaching the Second Supplem ental Settlement \nAgreement, which Plaintiffs omitted, as Attachment E to the Second Declaration of Hugh R. Eley.  \nPlaintiffs have asked the Court to take judicial notice of the Barthelemy pleadings. (Opp’n at 11 n.55) \n10 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 15 of 46\n\n \n¶42. Although nearly 1000 individuals had service reductions as a result of the 42-hour cap, the \nrate of transitions from LT-PCS to nursing homes did not increase after DHH cut the number of \nhours of paid care participants  received. SUF ¶48. Rather, the per centage of LT-PCS recipients \ntransitioning into nursing facilities steadily declined from 6% in October-December 2005 to 4% \nin January-March 2009 to 3% in July-Septe mber 2010. SUF ¶47. The State announced the 32-\nhour cap on August 20, 2010, and it took effect on Septem ber 5. See 36 La. Reg. at 1749, 1752. \nIn September-December 2010, 512 individuals who previously received greater than 32 hours of \nLT-PCS had their services reduced under the new rule. SUF ¶49. The  data show that 2% of the \nLT-PCS recipients who were enrolled in September transitioned into nursing facilities in October \nthrough December. SUF ¶50. That is the lowest rate of any quarter sin ce the LT-PCS program \nbegan.  SUF ¶46-50. T he  data for transitions fr om  LT-PCS to nursing f acilities  in January \nthrough March are not yet available, but Defendants are continuing to monitor the rate of nursing \nhome admissions for LT-PCS recipients. SUF ¶51-52. \nIII.  Standard of Review \n“The court shall grant summ ary judgment if the movant shows that the re is no \ngenuine dispute as to any m aterial fact and the  movant is entitled to judgm ent as a m atter of \nlaw.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “[ T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the \nparties will not defeat an otherwise properl y supported motion for summary judgm ent; the \nrequirement is that there be no  genuine issue of material fact.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., \n477  U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986). The applicable subs tantive  law determ ines  which facts are \nmaterial, and “[f]actual disputes that are ir relevant or unnecessary will not be counted.”  Id. at \n248. An issue as to a material fact is genuine “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could \nreturn a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Id.; see also Firemen’s Mut. Ins. Co. v. Aponaug Mfg. \n11 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 16 of 46\n\n \nCo., 149 F.2d 359, 362 (5th Cir. 1945) (“A pretended i ssue, one that no substantial evidence can \nbe offered to maintain, is not genuine.”). \nBecause “[o]ne of the principal pu rposes of the summary judgment rule is to  \nisolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims,” Rule 56 does not require “that the moving \nparty  support its m otion  with affida vits  or other sim ilar  materials  negating  the opponent’s \nclaim.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, 323-24 (1986). “[T]he opposing party is not \nentitled to hold back his evidence until trial on the possibility that an issue of material fact might \narise. . . .” Sagers v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. , 529 F.2d 721, 728 n.13 (5th Cir. 1976) (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted). The fact that the nonmovant “vigorously dispute[s] the \nlegal conclusions to be drawn fr om the facts presented” is “no bar to the grant of summ ary \njudgment.” Id. \nIV.  The 32-Hour Cap Is Not Discrimination  Under The ADA Because It Does Not \nSubject LT-PCS Recipients To “Unjustified Isolation.” \nPlaintiffs purport to rest their ADA clai m on the interpretation of the statut e \nadopted by the Supreme Court in  Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). At the sam e time, \nPlaintiffs observe of  Olmstead that “[t]he instant action presen ts a very different situation.” \n(Opp’n at 33) We agree. The heart of Plaintiffs’  legal theory is that the ADA requires States to \nprovide Medicaid recipients with  enough personal care services to eliminate the risk that they \nwill have to enter a nursing facility. No reading of Olmstead supports that theory. \nA.  The ADA Does Not Mandate that a State Provide Each LT-PCS Recipient \nwith Services Sufficient to Eliminate the Risk of Institutional Care. \nIn Olmstead, the Supreme Court considered whether the ADA required a State to \nallow two women with developmental disabilities and mental illness to leave the state psychiatric \nunit and to receive treatment instead through the State’s HCBS waiver program. See 527 U.S. at \n593. There was no question in  Olmstead of whether the waiver provi ded services sufficient to \n12 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 17 of 46\n\n \neliminate the risk that the plaintiffs would agai n need institutional placement. Rather, the Court \nobserved that the plaintiffs’ needs could be m et by a community-based waiver program that the \nState already supported, id., and that the waiver had unfilled slots that could be of fered to the \nplaintiffs, id. at 601 (noting that the State was usi ng 700 of 2109 approved slots). Under these \ncircumstances,  the Co urt  held  that  the  plaintiffs’  “continued confinem ent  in a segregated  \nenvironment,” id. at 593, qualified as “unjustified isolati on of individuals with disabilities” and \nwas “properly regarded as discrimination based on disability,” id. at 597. \nThe limits of Olmstead are clear from the facts of  the case as well as from the \nCourt’s cautionary language. The  Olmstead Court expressly declined to hold “that the ADA \nimposes on the States a standard of care for whatever medical services they render” or “that the \nADA requires States to provide a certain level of benefits to individuals with disabilities.” Id. at \n603 n.14 (citation and internal quotation m arks omitted). And the Court made clear that “[t]he \nState’s responsibility, once it provides community-based treatment to qualified persons with \ndisabilities, is not boundless.” Id. at 603. \nThese limitations on Olmstead’s reach are consistent with the Court’s long-settled \ninterpretation  of  the Rehabilita tion  Act.10  In  Alexander  v. Choate ,  469 U.S. 287 (1985), a \nunanimous Court established that a “State is no t required to assure the handicapped ‘adequate \nhealth care.’” Id. at 309. The plaintiffs in  Choate brought a Rehabilitation Act challenge to \nTennessee’s reduction from 20 to 14 in the number of inpatient hospital days that the State would \nreimburse through its Medicaid program . Id. at 289. The Court upheld the service lim itation, \nfinding “unsound” the plain tiffs’ suggestion that the policy was discriminatory because they \n                                                 \n10 Plaintiffs agree that the  RA and the  ADA should be treated as coterminous. (Opp’n to Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss at 4 n.1 (ECF No.  17)). Our references to the ADA refer to both statutes unless the \ncontext forbids it. \n13 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 18 of 46\n\n \nrequired more than 14 days of i npatient care in order to have meaningful access to the service. \nId. at 302-03. The claim that 14 days was inadequate to meet their needs “rest[ed] on the notion \nthat  the benefit provided through state Me dicaid  programs  is the am orphous  objective of \n‘adequate health care.’ But Medicaid programs do not guarantee that each recipient will receive \nthat level of health care precisely tailored to hi s or her particular needs. Instead, the benefi t \nprovided through Medicaid is a part icular package of health care  services, such as 14 days of  \ninpatient coverage.” Id. at 303.  \nSo too here. The State offers a service that provides 32 hours per week of personal \ncare. Like the plaintiffs in  Choate, Plaintiffs here consider the  service the State o ffers to be \ninadequate, and their proposed rule  would establish a m inimum level of services that the State \nmust provide to  individuals in the community (i.e., the level necessary to prevent them from \nbeing “placed at risk of institutionalization”). (Opp’n at 31) In short, Plaintiffs ask this Court to \nfind in the ADA exactly what the Supreme Court has twice declined to. Cf. Buchanan v. Maine, \n469 F.3d 158, 174 (1st Cir. 2006) (“[T]he ADA does not itself mandate the provision of services \n. . . .”); Cercpac v. Health & Hosps. Corp., 147 F.3d 165, 168 (2d Cir. 1998) (“[T]he disabilities \nstatutes do not guarantee any par ticular level of medical care for disabled persons, nor assure \nmaintenance of service previously provided.”). \nPlaintiffs rely (Opp’n at 30-32) on  Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care A uthority, \n335 F.3d 1175 (10th Cir. 2003), but  Fisher is not as broad as Plaintiffs claim . In that case, the \nTenth Circuit held that the plaintiffs had stat ed a claim under the ADA when they challenged a \nState’s policy of providing unlimited prescriptions to nursing facility residents but no more than \nfive prescriptions to indi viduals in the community. See id. at 1178-79. Thus, the comm unity-\nbased plaintiffs in Fisher asked for exactly the same services that they could receive in a nursing \n14 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 19 of 46\n\n \nfacility. In this case, Plaintiffs’ physicians have stated that their patients receive more one-on-one \nattention to activities of daily living in the community than they would in a nursing facility.11 \nThus while Fisher itself went beyond what  Olmstead said the ADA requires, Plaintiffs ask this \nCourt to go much further. Cf. M.R. v. Dreyfus, No. C10-2-52Z, 2011 WL 588511, at *13 (W.D. \nWash. Feb. 9, 2011) (to be published) (distinguishing Fisher on this and other grounds). There is \nno limiting principle on the a mount of services Pl aintiffs would require the State to provide , \nother than that the State need not provide more than is adequate. But see Choate, 469 U.S. at 309 \n(holding a “State is not required to assure the handicapped ‘adequate health care.’”). \nNor is there any merit to Plaintiffs’ effort to reformulate their Olmstead-based \nargument as an argument that the 32-hour cap  on LT-PCS services “discriminates against LT-\nPCS recipients based on the severity of their disabilities.” (Opp’n at 29-30) First, if Plaintiffs are \nright, any limit on services discriminates against individuals who require more. Yet as their own \nevidence shows, nearly every State caps either hours or co sts in its HCBS programs.  See Pls.’ \nExh. 26, Henry J. Kaiser Fam ily Found., Medicaid Home and Community-Based Programs : \nData Update (Feb. 2011), at 38 tbl.9 (ECF No. 38-3, page 450 of 455); see also Memorandum in \nSupport of Defs.’ Motion to Dism iss at 22 (ECF No. 11-1) (noting that 20  States do not have a \n                                                 \n11 Pls.’ Exh. 8, Decl. of Gregor y Ward, MD, at ¶14 (ECF No. 38- 3, page 278 of 455) (“In  a nursing \nfacility, [Helen Pitts] will not receive the same one-on-one attention to her activities of daily living, which \nshe presently receives.”); Pls.’ Exh. 9, Decl. of Keyna Whitney, MD, at ¶12 (ECF No. 38-3, page 281 of \n455) (“In a nursing facility, [ Kenneth Roman] will not receive the same o ne-on-one attention to hi s \nactivities of daily living  or his health care which  he presently receives.”); Pls.’ Exh. 10, Letter from \nAlireza Minagar, MD, FAAN, at 2 (ECF No. 38-3, page 285 of 455) (“I do not believe Ms. Hodges can or \nwill receive the same level of medical/health care and attention in a nursing facility that she receives in \nthe community, and she will not receive the same o ne-on-one attention to her activities of  daily living, \nwhich she presently receives and requires.”); Pls.’ Exh. 11, Decl. of Christopher Lege, MD, at ¶11 (ECF \nNo. 38-3, page 288 of 455) (“In a nursing facility, [Rickii Ainey] will not receive the same level of one-\non-one attention to her activities of daily living.”). With limited exceptions, the minimum requirement in \nLouisiana is that nursing facilities provide 2.35 hours of direct care per resident per day. SUF ¶19. \n15 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 20 of 46\n\n \npersonal care state plan service, and m any that do provide less than 32 hours a week). Second, \nPlaintiffs’ theory would render discrim inatory any change in any Medicaid program  if that \nchange “disproportionately affects” recipients with different levels of acuity. The result would be \nparalysis for the entire Medicaid program. Cf. M.R. v. Dreyfus, 2011 WL 31553, at *8 n.8 (W.D. \nWash. Jan. 5, 2011) (“[T]he variati on in federally approved State li mitations on the availability \nof personal care services is indicative of the discretion afforded to the States in crafting personal \ncare programs.”). Third, assuming the cases Plaintiffs cite stand for the proposition Plaintiffs say \nthey do, they are all inconsistent with th e narrower reading of the ADA adopted in  Olmstead. \nPlaintiffs cite no post-Olmstead cases that support their argument. Fourth, the Complaint did not \nallege facts sufficient to give rise to this theory of Plaintiffs’ case; to do so, the Complaint would \nhave had to allege how the challenged rule incomparably affected LT-PCS recipients outside the \nasserted class. It d idn’t, and Plaintiffs should not be perm itted to constructively am end the \nComplaint now. Cf. Dussouy v. Gulf Coast Inv. Corp., 660 F.2d 594, 604 (5th Cir. 1981) (stating \nthat a complaint need not “categorize correctly the legal theory giving rise to the claim” but must \n“allege[] facts upon which relief can be granted”).  In short, both their main argum ent and their \nnew one lack merit. \nB.  Other HCBS Programs in the State Are Open to LT-PCS Recipients Who \nSeek Additional Services. \nAlthough  Olmstead  concluded  that  “unjustified  isolation”  in an institu tion \nconstitutes discrimination under the ADA, Plaintiffs have not shown  that they will be subjected \nto “unjustified isolation” and therefore have  not shown that the 32 -hour cap on LT-PCS is  \ndiscriminatory. Louisiana provides personal car e services through several HCBS program s in \naddition  to  LT-PCS, and these s ervices  are avai lable  to Plaintiffs, e ither  immediately  or \n16 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 21 of 46\n\n \neventually. In these circumstances, the 32-hour cap on LT -PCS cannot fairly be said to cause  \n“unjustified isolation” under Olmstead. \n1.  LT-PCS Recipients Can Supplement Their Services with ADHC \nServices. \nAs set forth above, LT-PCS recipients, in cluding those who need m ore than 32 \nhours of personal care assistance per week, ca n supplement their LT-PCS with ADHC services. \nPlaintiffs did not mention the ADHC program in the Complaint and even now have little to say \nabout it. They m ake basically two points: the wait for services  is too long and there are not \nADHC facilities in every area of the State. The  first argument is m eritless, and the second is  \ninapplicable to at least three of the named plaintiffs. \nLT-PCS  recipients  who apply for ADHC services cu rrently  wait abo ut  five \nmonths for their waiver offer.12 Plaintiffs describe the five-m onth wait as “lengthy.” (Opp’n at \n15) The fact is that the LT-PCS service reductions are being implemented on a rolling basis, SUF \n¶44, and LT-PCS recipients can apply for ADHC services at any time. SUF ¶33. If Plaintiffs had \nrequested  services  rather  than f iling  suit,  they  would already have  received  their  offers.13 \nPlaintiffs cannot reasonably claim that a wait of this length is unreasonable.  \nPlaintiffs also note (Opp’n  at 16) that some members of the proposed class m ay \nnot have an ADHC fac ility near their current  residence. Each ADHC facility is required to \nprovide recipients with transp ortation to and from  the facility. SUF ¶85. Of the four na med \n                                                 \n12 Individuals who have had an overnight hospital stay in the last 30 days and those who have been in a \nnursing facility for at least 90 consecutive days do not have a wait. SUF ¶95. \n13 As of March 22, 2011, the State was offering ADHC  slots to LT-PCS recipients who applied for the \nADHC waiver on October 22, 2010. SUF ¶94. \n17 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 22 of 46\n\n \nplaintiffs, three live within the transportation range of an ADHC facility that accepts Medicaid.14 \nThat other individuals do not liv e near an ADHC facility  does not explain why  these plaintiffs \nhave decided not to take advantage of the services the State has to offer. \nThe fourth plaintiff, Kenneth Roman, lives 34 miles from an ADHC facility that \naccepts Medicaid, and Defendants have not determ ined whether a facility in h is region would \nprovide him with transportation  to and from his home. SUF ¶89.  Even if that transportation \nservice  is lacking, its unavail ability  is not discrim inatory.  The ADA’s prohibition against \nunjustified isolation in institutions does not mean that States must provide HCBS wherever any \nqualified individual chooses to live, and Mr. Rom an would have the services he needs if he \nrelocated to a community where they are available or if he relied on other form al or informal \nsupports to provide all or part of his transportation. \n2.  LT-PCS Recipients Can Request EDA Services, and Many Already \nHave. \nAs mentioned above, Louisiana also offers the EDA waiver , which provides a \nbudget for services that Plaintiffs concede “w ould certainly be adequate” for them  to avoid \nnursing facility placement. (Opp’n at 14) Two of  the four named plaintiffs, and the only cla ss \nmember referenced in Plaintiffs’ filings, have al l already received EDA offers, with services to \nbegin shortly. \nThe two plaintiffs who have not yet receiv ed EDA offers do not argue that they \nshould be allowed to bypass the waiting list and enroll in the EDA program ahead of others, and \nOlmstead would foreclose such an argument. See 527 U.S. at 606 (“[ A] court would have no \n                                                 \n14 Helen Pitts lives 2.6 miles away from the ADHC of Livingston Parish, SUF ¶86; Denise Hodges lives \n7.7 miles away from Christus Schumpert ADHC, SUF ¶87; and Rickii Ainey lives 4.2 miles away from \nNew Directions ADHC, SUF ¶88. \n18 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 23 of 46\n\n \nwarrant effectively to order displacement of persons at the top of the community-based treatment \nwaiting list by individuals lower down who commenced civil actions.”). Instead, Plaintiffs make \nthe more aggressive argument that the State is required to p rovide them with whatever services \nthey need through the LT-PCS program, making it unnecessary for them to receive EDA services \nat all. That line of argument cannot be sustained in light of the substantial authority holding that \nwaiting lists for waiver services are permissible. See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 605-06; see also Arc \nof. Wash. State, Inc. v. Braddock , 427 F.3d 615, 621 (9th Cir. 2005);  Boyd v. Steckel, 2:10-cv-\n688, 2010 WL 4683997 passim (M.D. Ala. Nov. 12, 2010); Bryson v. Stephen, 99-CV-558, 2006 \nWL 2805238 passim (D.N.H. Sept. 29, 2006). \n3.  LT-PCS Recipients Who Are in Fact Admitted to a Nursing Facility \nWill Receive Priority for EDA Services. \nAssuming the 32-hour cap on LT-PCS does re sult in Plaintiffs seeking nursing \nfacility services, they will be given priority for an EDA offer after 90 days. Plaintiffs’ temporary \nstay in a nursing facility in the interim is not “unjustified isolation” under Olmstead. \nIt is undisputed that Plaintiffs would be  placed in a high priority group for the \nEDA waiver if they entered a nursing facility for 90 consecutive days, SUF ¶62, and that, during \nthis period, they would not be  required to forfeit their resi dence in the community. SUF ¶66. \nAlthough they would “not be guaranteed adequate community services on the 91st day,” (Opp’n \nat 30), it is undisputed that, as of March 29, 2011, no one on the EDA Registry who had resided \nin a nursing facility for 90 days  was still waiting for a waiver offer. SUF ¶64. Once an offer is  \nmade, it generally takes another  60 to 90 days for EDA serv ices to commence, although the \nindividual would not be required to rem ain in the nursing facility if he or she wished to return \nhome prior to the commencement of EDA services. SUF ¶¶65, 67. This latter period results from \nthe person-centered planning that is part of the EDA waiver. The support coordinator is required \n19 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 24 of 46\n\n \nto meet with the indiv idual and complete their evaluation, to determine the recipient’s EDA \nbudget, to help develop a com prehensive plan of care tailored to the i ndividual’s needs and \npreferences, and to find the recipient housing (if necessary). SUF ¶65. \nPlaintiffs maintain that the State discriminates against them to the extent that they \nmust “physically enter a nursing facility as  a condition of receiving [services].” (Opp’n at 30) \nPlaintiffs are incorrect. Again Plaintiffs rely on the Tenth Circuit’s  Fisher decision. Fisher \ninvolved a challenge to a State’ s decision to provide nursing f acility residents with unlim ited \nprescriptions and HCBS recipients with no more than five. See 335 F.3d at 1178-79. There is no \nindication in the opinion that  individuals who required more than five prescriptions would  ever \nbe able to get them outside a nursing home. Because it is undisputed that Plaintiffs in this case \nwill enter a nursing facility only temporarily, if at all, Fisher is inapposite, as are most of the \ndistrict court cases Plaintiffs cite without explanation. \nPlaintiffs do cite one unpublished district  court decision that does support their \nposition. Haddad v. Arnold, No. 10-00414 (M.D. Fla. July 9, 2010) (ECF. No. 49); see also Cruz \nv. Dudek, No. 10-23048-CIV, 2010 WL 4284955, at *13 (S .D. Fla. Oct. 12, 2010) (following \nHaddad). The Haddad court addressed the issue presented here in only a single paragraph of an \notherwise lengthy opinion, it did so without any citations to supporting authority, and it assumed \nwithout analysis that even a tem porary stay in a nursing facility is discrim inatory. See Haddad, \nsupra, at 35-36.  \nHaddad was wrongly decided, and it is inconsistent with  Olmstead. At issue in \nOlmstead was whether “continued confinement” in an institution was discriminatory. 527 U.S. at \n593 (majority opinion); see also id. at 626 (Thom as, J., dissenting) (agreeing that the case \ninvolves “[c]ontinued institutional treatment”). The Court acknowledged that som e individuals \n20 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 25 of 46\n\n \nwho are qualified for H CBS “may need institutional care from time to time” when their needs \nexceed the level of care available in the community. Id. at 605 (plurality opinion).15 Because the \nCourt  considered  such  temporary  placements  appropriate,  they  cannot also qualify as \ndiscriminatory “unjustified isolation,” id. at 597.  \nThe State’s policy is to promptly offer EDA services to qualified individuals who \nprove unable to remain in the community with the services LT-PCS provides. This policy is not \nrepresentative of the  “isolat[ion] and segregat[ion]” that the ADA and  Olmstead identified as \ndiscrimination, Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 588-89, 600 (quoting  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2)), does not \n“perpetuate[]  unwarranted assum ptions  that  [Plaintiffs]  are incapable or unworthy of \nparticipating in community life,” id. at 600, and will not lead to the “continued confinement” of \nPlaintiffs or the class they purport to represent, id. at 593. \nV.  The ADA Does Not Require The State T o Fundamentally Alter The Services It \nProvides To Individuals With Disabilities. \nAs discussed in Part IV, Plaintiffs have  not shown the S tate’s policies to be \ndiscriminatory. Accordingly, there is no need to consider whether the relief Plaintiffs seek would \nbe a “reasonable m odification” of the State’s  programs (which is required) or a “fundam ental \nalteration” (which is not). See Buchanan, 469 F.3d at 176 n.12;  Rodriguez v. City of New York , \n197 F.3d 611, 619 n.6 (2d Cir. 1999) (declining to reach the reasonable-modification question). \n                                                 \n15 Several lower court opinions indicate that  Olmstead concerns only indefinite institutionalization. See, \ne.g., Frederick L. v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare (Frederi ck II), 422 F.3d 151, 158 (3d Cir. 2005) (concluding \nthe State lacked an adequate plan to end the plaintiffs’ “unnecessary and indefinite institutionalization”); \nFrederick L. v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare , 157 F. Su pp. 2d 509, 541 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (concluding that \ninstitutionalized plaintiffs “are not left without recourse under  Olmstead simply because the State has  \nsecured their indefinite placement on a waiting list”);  cf. Williams v. Wasserman, 164 F. Supp. 2d 591, \n597 (D. Md. 2001) (noting the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the State cannot “confine the plaintiffs \nin state psychiatric hospitals indefinitely”). \n21 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 26 of 46\n\n \nHowever, even if the Court were to conclude that Plaintiffs may be able to prove \n“unjustified  isolation” in vi olation  of the A DA,  Defendants  are  still  entitled  to summ ary \njudgment, because it is apparent that Plain tiffs’ request for relief goes beyond a reasonab le \nmodification and would funda mentally alter the Medicaid servic es offered by the State. The \n“Supreme Court has instructed courts to be symp athetic to fundamental alteration defenses, and \nto give states ‘leeway’ in adm inistering services for the disabled.”  Braddock, 427 F.3d at 618 \n(quoting Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 605); see Boyd, 2010 WL 4683997, at *10. Any rule that “would \nleave the State virtually defenseless” is “unacceptable.” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603. \nA.  Plaintiffs Have Not Proposed a Reasonable Modification. \nPlaintiffs bear the burden of proposing a reasonable modification, Frederick L. v. \nDep’t  of Pub. Welfare (Frederick I ),  364 F.3d 487, 492 n.4 (3d Ci r.  2004), which under \nOlmstead must take into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with \ndisabilities. See 527 U.S. at 607. 16 Plaintiffs have not consistent ly articulated the modification \nthey seek and have not shown why it would not result in reduced services for others. \nIt is not clear whether Plaintiffs’ requested modification would allow the State to \ncontinue applying its pr evious 42-hour cap on LT-PCS. Plaint iffs suggested in their initial \nopposition to Defendants’ motion to dismiss that “[t]he reasonable accommodation proposed is \nto continue to assess each person with a disability individually and to authorize only the number \nof hours, up to 42 per  week, that the person requires to a void institutionalization.” (Opp’n to \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss at 19 (ECF No. 17)) But their more recent brief and their reply in \nthe class certification pleadings appear to go  much further: “the ADA  requires Defendants to \n                                                 \n16 Defendants disagree with Plaintiffs that the burden shifts to Defendants to demonstrate that refusing a \nrequested accommodation is “necessary for budgetary  reasons,” (Opp’n at 23) particularly when, unlike \nin Olmstead, the State is not raising an exclusively cost-based defense. \n22 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 27 of 46\n\n \nallow  persons who need m ore  than 32 hours of   personal care services in order to avoid \ninstitutionalization to receive those services.” (Opp’n at 27; Pls.’ Reply to Defs.’ Memorandum \nin Opp’n to Class Certification  at 3 (ECF No. 33)) In any event,  Plaintiffs fail to offer any \nprincipled reason why capping LT-PCS at 32 hours  discriminates against individuals who need \nmore than 32 hours while capping LT-PCS at 42 hours does not discriminate against individuals \nwho need more. \nAt other points in their briefing, Plaintiffs describe their proposed modification a \nthird way: “The m odification that Plaintiffs propose is that the y, and others in the class, be \npermitted to retain their hours of LT-PCS, which they have already been receiving, to the extent \nthat the receipt of those hours of  service is n ecessary to prevent their institutionalization.” \n(Opp’n at 31) Presumably, this means that the State will never need to provide up to 42 hours of \nservices to individuals currently receiving less. But this is not a passable description of the relief \nPlaintiffs  seek, and Plaintiffs provide no just ification  for why indivi duals  who have been \nreceiving  LT-PCS  can continue to receive se rvices  in excess of  32  hours while the cap \npresumably could be applied to new enrollees. (In fact, Medicaid rules on comparability would \ngenerally prohibit such a distinction.)  \nPlaintiffs insist that they “are not seek ing to enjoin r eductions in the LT-PCS \nprogram to all recipients in the LT-PCS  program—only those reductions to people who will be  \nput at risk of unnecessary institutionalization by the reduction.” (Opp’n at 27) This statement is \nmeaningless. All LT-PCS recipients, by definition, must meet a nursing facility level of care and \nmust satisfy additional factors  showing that they have an im mediate need for personal care \nassistance. See La. Admin. Code tit. 50, § 12905, 30 La. Reg. 2831, 2831-32 (Dec. 2004); Opp’n \nat 17 (quoting id.). All are “at risk” of nursing home admission. \n23 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 28 of 46\n\n \nUnder  Olmstead,  Plaintiffs  can succeed only if the relief   they seek “can be \nreasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs \nof others with . . . disabilities.” 527 U.S. at 587.  Plaintiffs have not made the required showing \nthat the hours of care they s eek is a reason able accommodation in light of “the resources \navailable” and “the needs of others.” \nB.  The State Maintains a Comprehensive and Effectively Working Plan to Move \nIndividuals from Nursing Facilities to the Community. \nThe Olmstead Court explained that the “reason able-modifications standard” has \nbeen met if the State maintains “a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified \npersons with . . . disabilities in less restrictive settings, and a waiting list that moved at a \nreasonable pace not controlled by the State’s en deavors to keep its institutions fully populated.” \n527 U.S. at 605-06. Louisiana’s HCBS programs, taken as a whole, clearly satisfy these criteria. \nEven Plaintiffs’ expert witness recognizes that: \nLouisiana has made substantial inroads in making LTC [long-term \ncare]  services m ore  available  in  community settings   and in  \nreducing  reliance  on institu tional  services. Expanding HCBS, \nprimarily through the creation and  expansion of the state personal \ncare plan (LT-PCS), appears to have been accompanied by a large \nreduction  in the institutionalized   population in the state, with \ndeclines exceeding both the national average and the other states in \nthe South Central region. \nPls.’ Exh. 25, Declaration of H. Stephen Kaye, at ¶16 (ECF No. 38-3, page 411 of 455). \n1.  Louisiana  has achieved and co ntinues  to achieve great success in \nproviding alternatives to institutionalization. \nIn confirming that a State has a “com prehensive, effectively working plan” that \nprovides  a defense under  Olmstead,  appellate courts have looked to whether the State’s \n“commitment to deinstitutionalization” is “genuine, comprehensive, and reasonable.” Sanchez v. \nJohnson, 416 F.3d 1051, 1067 (9th Cir. 2005). This test re quires looking primarily at the State’s \n24 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 29 of 46\n\n \npast  efforts  at de institutionalization  “(i.e.,  [whether] it has dem onstrated  a comm itment  to \ncomply with the ADA and RA).” Pa. Protection & Advocacy, Inc. v. Pa. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, \n402 F.3d 374, 381 (3d Cir. 2005). In som e cases, the court also looks to whether the State \nremains committed to deinstitutionalization going forward. See, e.g., Sanchez, 416 F.3d at 1067. \nBut see Braddock, 427 F.3d at 621 (affirm ing summary judgment in favor of the State without \nsuch analysis).17 \nState  Medicaid program s  are constant ly  evolving, and policym akers  must \nsometimes respond to unforeseen circum stances. Courts therefore view the S tate’s efforts at \ndeinstitutionalization in their  broader historical context.  See, e.g., Braddock, 427 F.3d at 621 \n(considering developments since 1983); Sanchez, 416 F.3d at 1067 (considering developm ents \nsince 1991). Additionally, “[i]t is of central importance . . . that courts apply [Olmstead] . . . with \nappropriate deference to the program f unding decisions of state policym akers.” Olmstead, 527 \nU.S. at 610 (Kennedy, J., concurring). \nThe decisions in Braddock and Sanchez are instructive. In both cases, plain tiffs \nwho were currently institutionalized (or suing on behalf of institutionalized persons) brought suit \nunder  Olmstead,  and  the court of appeals af firmed  the  district court’s entry of summ ary \njudgment in favor of the State based on its “co mprehensive, effectively working plan” for \ndeinstitutionalization. In both cases, the state maintained a waiver program but (apparently) no \nstate Medicaid plan service that could meet the plaintiffs’ needs. \n                                                 \n17 The Third Circuit has said that the State must meet only a “minimal burden” in demonstrating that its \npast progress will continue. Pa. Protection & Advocacy, 402 F.3d at 382. Nevertheless, the court has held \nin two different cases that a State has not met its burden and has required the State to make a very specific \nshowing of its future plans. See id. at 383-85; see also Frederick II, 422 F.3d 151; Frederick L. v. Dep’t \nof Pub. Welfare, 364 F.3d 487 (3d Cir. 2004). All of these cas es, however, involved a State’s efforts to \nreduce the population of a single state-run instituti on. When, as in this case , a State’s  entire HCBS \nprogram is at issue, it is neither practical nor possible to require a comparable showing. \n25 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 30 of 46\n\n \nIn Braddock, the court of appeals noted that the State’s  HCBS program was \n“substantial in size” at 10,000 people; that the State’s waiver program was full, with slots being \nfilled as they opened up; that the HCBS program had increased from 1,227 slots to 9,977 slots \nfrom 1983 to 1998; that the state budget for HCBS “more than doubled” from 1994 to 2001; that \nthe budget for institutional prog rams “remained constant” from 1994 to 2001; and that the  \ninstitutionalized population declined by 20% from  1994 to 2001.  See Braddock, 427 F.3d at \n621.18 \nIn Sanchez, the court of appeals affirm ed the entry of summary judgm ent based \non  evidence that the HCBS population in creased  by 55% between 1991 and 2001; that  \nexpenditures on HCBS increased by 196% between 1991 and 2001; that the State had reduced its \ninstitutionalized population by 20% between 1996 and 2000; that the State had applied for m ore \nwaiver slots in the future; that the State had budgeted for the creation of new HCBS facilities; \nand that the State expected to close at least one institution within  the next tw o years. See \nSanchez, 416 F.3d at 1067. \nWith respect to almost every variable, Louisiana’s programs are comparable to \nthose at issue in these two cases. The St ate’s HCBS population in SFY 2010 was 18,215. SUF \n¶10. Both the EDA and ADHC waivers are full, and  slots are offered, as they become available, \nfirst to individuals in nursing  facilities and then to individuals already in the community. SUF \n¶¶59-63, 91-95. The HCBS population increas ed by 1668% between SFY 2000 a nd SFY 2010 \nand by 224% between SFY 2005 and SFY 2010;  meanwhile, the LT-PCS population alone  \nincreased by 777% between SFYs 2005 and 2010.  SUF ¶29. The State’s expenditures on HCBS \n                                                 \n18 The court also noted that the current HCBS-to-institutional population ratio was 10:1. See Braddock, \n427 F.3d at 621. The cou rt did not state how that ratio had changed in the  past or how many  of the \ninstitutionalized persons were qualified for community-based care.  \n26 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 31 of 46\n\n \ngrew by over 250% between SFYs 2005 and 2010, and its expenditures on LT-PCS grew by over \n600%. SUF ¶35. These numbers indicate that payments to providers of HCBS gene rally and to \nLT-PCS providers in particular gr ew faster than payments to private providers of any other \nMedicaid service over the same period. See Second Decl. of Hugh R. Eley, att. C. A dditionally, \nbetween SFYs 2000 and 2010, per capita expenditure s on private nursing facilities decreased \n(once adjusted for inflation), Pls.’ Exh. 25, Declaration of H. Stephen Kaye, at ¶12 (ECF No. 38-\n3, page 407 of 455), and expenditures on the S tate’s two public institutions that provide skilled \nnursing services remained roughly the same (without any adjustment for inflation), Second Decl. \nof Hugh R. Eley, att C. Over th e same period, the population of priv ate nursing facilities in the \nState dropped by 15%. SUF ¶14. \nPlaintiffs’ own expert witness acknowledge s that Louisiana has been successful \nrelative to other States. Professor H. Stephen Kaye states that Louisiana’s expenditures on HCBS \n“increased sharply” between 2004 and 2009 and  that, “[b]y 2008, Louisiana’s per-capita HCBS \nexpenditure ($72) had exceeded that of the re mainder of its region ($56), and by 2009 ($84), it \nwas approaching the U.S. average ($91).” Pls.’  Exh. 25, Declaration of H. Stephen Kaye, at ¶9 \n(ECF  No. 38-3, page 404 of 455). This trend  reflected  comparable  improvement  in the \nproportion of long term care spending devoted to HCBS, with Louisiana besting the other South \nCentral states in 2009 and approaching the national average. See id. at ¶10 (page 405).19 \n                                                 \n19 On at least one point, Plaintiffs  misrepresent their expert’s evidence. Plaintiffs say Louisiana’s HCBS \nspending has “declined sharply” since 2009 “so that  it is now below both the  national and the regional \naverage.” (Opp’n at 26) As Prof. Kaye’s affidavit clearly explains, however, “for other states, data for \n2010 and 2011 are not available, and the dotted lines [on his graphs] indicate linear projections based on \nexpenditures for 2005-2009.” Pls.’ Exh. 25, Declaration of H. Stephen Kaye, at ¶8 (ECF No. 38-3, page \n404 of 455). No record evidence shows how the y responded to the financial crises all States have faced \nsince 2008. \n27 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 32 of 46\n\n \nLouisiana is also working to ensure that these successes continue into the future. \nThe State expects that the LT-PCS program will expand rapidly due to the aging population and \nchanges  to Medica id  eligibility  rules.  SUF ¶31.  The State is also   currently  overseeing the \nexpansion of the ADHC program into currently under-served areas: Nearly a dozen new facilities \nbegan accepting Medicaid since October,20 and 22 facilities have applications pending. SUF ¶98. \nLouisiana also recently designed a “Community  Choice” waiver tha t will replace the EDA \nwaiver; the new program will offer recipients a more comprehensive menu of services and will \nallow them greater flexibility to self-dir ect their care. S UF ¶¶105-108. The PACE program, \nwhich started in 2008, continues to  enroll new recipients in Ba ton Rouge and New Orleans and \nto provide services without a waiting list. SUF ¶¶112-113. The State is currently awaiting federal \napproval of a new AR C waiver that will create 200 new waiver  slots, SUF ¶116, and recen t \nchanges to the EDA Registry made available approximately 75 slots that were previously going \nunused, SUF ¶¶114-115.21 Meanwhile, the State has successfully applied for a grant under th e \nfederal  Money  Follows  the Per son  program;  it is now using th ese  resources  to iden tify \nindividuals in nursing facilities  who want to leave and th en to help them transition to the \ncommunity. SUF ¶¶99-100. And the State has recen tly initiated multiple programs designed to \nclose nursing facilities and eliminate nursing facility beds. SUF ¶¶117-123. \nIn sum, the State operates a com prehensive, effectively working plan to provide \nalternatives to nursing facilities, and it remains committed to ensuring that its pas t successes \n                                                 \n20 According to Plaintiffs, there were on ly 27 ADHC facilities that accepted Medicaid in October 2010. \n(Opp’n at 16) As of March, the number was 38. SUF ¶98. \n21 There were previously 150 slots in the EDA waiver set aside for individuals with ALS. See La. Admin. \nCode tit. 50, § 8105(C), 35 La. Reg. 2447, 2447 (Nov. 2009).

The “requested relief would require [the  court] to disrupt this working \nplan and to restrict impermissibly the leeway that [the State] is permitted in its operation of . . . \nservices under Olmstead.” Sanchez, 416 F.3d at 1068. As one court observed: \nAlthough more can always be done, the reality is that states m ust \nmake  difficult  decisions  when alloca ting  necessarily  limited \nresources.

Stephen, 2006 WL 2805238, at *5 (D.N.H. Sept. 29, 2006). \n2.  None of Plaintiffs’ Three Counterarguments Has Merit. \nPlaintiffs point to “three reasons” (Opp’n at 34) they believe that Louisiana lacks \na “comprehensive, effectively working plan” of the kind described in  Olmstead. In each case, \nPlaintiffs are wrong on the law. \n1. Plaintiffs mainly argue (Opp’n at 33- 36) that Louisiana has not published a \ndocument that lays ou t with sufficient specificity how the State plans to keep th e individual \nplaintiffs  from  entering  nursing  homes.  Plaintiffs note that   the  State h as  published  two \ndocuments outlining action steps designed to faci litate community placements for individuals \nwho would otherwise require institutional care—the  Plan for Immediate Action  (2005) and \nLouisiana’s Plan for Choice in Long-Term Care (2007)—and since updated them several times. \nBut Plaintiffs argue that these docum ents are not sufficiently “specific” to support the State’s \ndefense. \nPlaintiffs’ argument rests on two unsupported legal assumptions, neither of which \nis correct. Plaintiffs’ first mistake is to assume that any particular document or documents must \nset forth the State’s plan for providing community-based services. Plaintiffs’ second mistake is to \n29 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 34 of 46\n\n \nassume that because Plaintiffs are currently in the community, the State can establish its defense \nonly if it has developed a plan to keep the individual plaintiffs out of nursing facilities. \nPlaintiffs argue that the Plan for Immediate Action and Plan for Choice in Long-\nTerm Care “cannot serve as a defense to claims of unjustified institutionalization” (Opp’n at 36) \nbecause  these docum ents  are not sufficiently de tailed,  and  Plaintiffs  list  several  perceived \ndeficiencies. The problem with this argument is that the State’s defense can succeed without any \nwritten plan at all. The “plan” referenced in  Olmstead comprises “the range of services that a \nstate  already provides.”   Disability Advocates,   Inc. v. Paterson ,  653 F. Supp. 2d 184, 268 \n(E.D.N.Y.  2009);  see  also id.   at 269-70 (noting that the St ate  has “no single docum ent \nconstituting an ‘Olmstead plan’” but continuing on to review  “the steps Defendants have taken \nand plan to take to enable Adult Home residents to receive services in more integrated settings”). \nPlaintiffs  read the Thir d  Circuit’s decision in  Frederick  L. v. Department of \nPublic Welfare (Frederick II) , 422 F.3d 151 (3d Cir. 2005), to require the State to develop a \nwritten document setting forth “reasonably specific and measurable” benchmarks “for which [the \nstate] may be held accountable.” (Opp’n at 35). But that cannot be what the Third Circuit meant \nin Frederick II because in a p rior appeal in the sam e case the court said, “The issue is no t \nwhether  there  is a   piece  of  paper  that ref lects  that the re  will be   ongoing  progress  toward \ncommunity placement.” Frederick I, 364 F.3d at 500. And other circ uits have rejected such \nburdensome oversight. See, e.g., Bruggeman ex rel Bruggeman v. Blagojevich , 324 F.3d 906, \n913 (7th Cir. 2003) (“The purpose of the [‘integra tion mandate’] is not to constitute the federal \ncourts the supervisors of the care and treatment of disabled persons.”). \nBut Frederick II is beside the point for another  reason, and that brings us to \nPlaintiffs’ second mistake. At issue in Frederick II was whether the State had a com prehensive, \n30 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 35 of 46\n\n \neffectively working plan for deinstitutionalizing individuals presently isolated in institutions. See \nFrederick II, 422 F.3d at 153-54. Not only that,  Frederick II involved whether the State was \nadequately working to discharge  “long-term mental health patients” from a particular state-run \nhospital. Id. It was in that con text that the Third  Circuit developed the  standards by which it \nwould  judge the State’s plan  for  deinstitutionalization.  The  instant  case doe s  not invo lve \ndeinstitutionalization of individuals presently in an institutional setting, and it does not involve a \nsingle state institution. It makes little sense to apply the criteria developed by the Third Circuit to \na case like this one, where the plaintiffs are not currently institutionalized and where the case \ninvolves the comprehensiveness of the State’s HCBS program as a whole. \nPlaintiffs cite the unpublished decision in Haddad v. Arnold, No. 10-00414 (M.D. \nFla. July 9, 2010) (ECF. No. 49), for the p roposition that the State’s plan m ust “address the \neffectiveness of the particu lar program available to the plaintiff,” even when the plaintiff is \ncurrently living in the community. (Opp’n at 36) Haddad is an unclear opinion that may or may \nnot stand for that proposition. The Haddad court does seem to assume that, when the plaintiff is \ncurrently in the community, the qu estion is whether the State has “an efficient co mprehensive \nplan to avoid institutionalization,” slip op. at 35, and the court did appear particularly concerned \nwith how long the plaintiff would need to wait to receive waiver services if the plaintiff were not \nin an institution, see id. at 34-35. \nHaddad is both wrong and distingu ishable. The result of Haddad, particularly \nwhen combined with Frederick II, is to make it more difficult for individuals who are presently \nconfined in institutions to succeed on an  Olmstead claim than it is for indiv iduals who are \nalready receiving HCBS. When the plaintiff is institutionalized, the State will need to show only \nthat it has HCBS programs that will allow the plaintiff and others similarly situated to leave \n31 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 36 of 46\n\n \ninstitutions in a reasonable tim e frame. See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 606;  Sanchez, 416 F.3d at \n1068 (“Olmstead does not require the immediate state-wide deinstitutionalization of all eligible \n… disabled persons”). Applied literally,  Haddad would appear to give those in the comm unity \nthe greater right of avoiding institutionalization altogether. This cannot be correct. In any event, \nHaddad is different from this case. In Haddad, the State did not present  any evidence that its \ninstitutionalized  population  had  steadily declined.  Haddad,  slip op. at 35. In the case of \nLouisiana, the evidence is substantial and undisputed. \n2.  Although Plaintiffs also contend  (Opp’n  at 36-37) that the State’s \ncomprehensive plan is not “effectively working,” their argument is probably better understood as \na complaint that the waiting lists for the ADHC  and EDA waivers do not move at a “reasonable \npace,” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 606.  \nAs discussed above, Plaintiffs would alrea dy have received an offer for a slot in  \nthe ADHC program if they had requested one wh en they filed their Co mplaint, and nothing \nprevented them from requesting an offer earlier. \nRegarding the EDA wa iver, Plaintiffs are wrong to focus  on the length of the \nwaiting list for individuals who  live in the community. W hen the Olmstead Court said tha t a \nState’s compliance with the ADA m ay turn on wh ether it has “a waiting  list that moved at a  \nreasonable pace,” 527 U.S. at 606, it was obviously  talking about a waiting list for individuals \n(like the Olmstead plaintiffs) who were waiting to leave an institution. See id. (“It is reasonable \nfor the State to ask someone to wait until a community placement is available.”). And Plaintiffs \nare  not well positioned  to  challenge  the  relatively  short  length-of-stay requirem ent  for \nindividuals who are in nursing ho mes for two reasons. First, Plaintiffs claim  is that the ADA \nrequires the State to provide them with services to avoid institutionalization; the State’s policies \n32 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 37 of 46\n\n \non moving individuals out of in stitutions, though certainly part  of the State’s defense under \nOlmstead, are not being challenged in this action.  Second, Plaintiffs are represented by an \norganization that agreed to the policy that made the wait for EDA services long er than it was \npreviously. SUF ¶¶77-80. \nAs to whether the State’s HCBS progra ms are “effectively working,” the proper \nfocus  is on the State’s dem onstrated  success  in providing hom e-  and community-based \nalternatives to institutions. See, e.g., Braddock, 427 F.3d at 620 (“So long as states are genuinely \nand effectively in the process of deinstitutiona lizing disabled persons ‘with an even hand,’ we  \nwill not interfere.”). Louisiana’s accomplishments over the last decade are remarkable, and it \ncannot fairly be said that the system is not “effectively working.” \n3. Finally, Plaintiffs argue (Opp’n at 37)  that Defendants cannot rely on the Plan \nfor Immediate Action and Plan for Choice in Long-Term Care because those documents did not \ncontemplate the reduction in LT-PCS services to 32-hours per week or various recent budgetary \nadjustments. Again Plaintiffs misunderstand the State’s defense, which is not pinned solely to \nthese particular documents. In any event, the S tate can hardly be faulted for not foreseeing the  \nexplosion of LT-PCS costs or the recession that amplified the need to control those costs.  \nMoreover, Plaintiffs cite no authority for their argument that a State cannot reduce \nservices without first declaring it s intent to do so in a policy pa per that (if States are held to  \nPlaintiffs’ standards) must describe the State’s entire HCBS program down to the last detail. To \nthe extent that courts have addressed the issue, they have concluded  that once a State has a \ndeinstitutionalization program in place, “Olmstead does not require .  . . that a State’s plan be \nalways and in all cases successful.” Sanchez, 416 F.3d at 1068; cf. Frederick I, 364 F.3d at 496 \n33 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 38 of 46\n\n \n(suggesting that the responsible  agency’s “unsuccessful attempts at fund procurem ent through \nthe Governor’s budget” weighed in its favor). \nMore significant are the array of HCBS  programs the State continues to m ake \navailable  and  the State ’s  demonstrated  commitment  to offering elderly and disabled adults \nalternatives to institutional ca re. As discussed above, over the  last decade Louisiana has seen \nconsiderable accomplishments in expanding the  HCBS options for its diverse pop ulation of \nelderly and disabled adults. The dram atic growth in the LT-PCS program  and the financial \ndifficulties  of the las t  two-and-a-half  years have pres ented  some  budgetary ob stacles,  but \nDefendants have managed to overcome them to serve a population that is increasing every single \nmonth. \nC.  The DOJ’s “Most Integrated Setting” Regulation Does Not Create A Right \nTo Home And Community-Based Services Beyond What Olmstead Requires. \nPlaintiffs contend that the ADA requires  States to provide an individual with \ndisabilities whatever level of services is necessary for that individual to reside outside a nursing \nhome. Although their more recent  brief (ECF No. 38) la cks any substantial discussion of the  \nstatutory basis for this claim, their earlier brief made clear that their argument is based on what \nPlaintiffs call the “integration mandate.” Opp’n to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss at 11-13, 15-\n18, 21 & nn.4-5, 8 (ECF No. 17). This “integrati on mandate” is a rule prom ulgated by the \nDepartment of Justice under Section 12134 of the ADA.  See 28 C.F.R. §  35.130(d); see also \nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 592 (labeling this  the “integration regulation” ). The rule provides: “A  \npublic entity shall adm inister services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \nNothing in the text of the ADA itself contains the requirement that States \nadminister services in the most integrated setting appropriate. What the ADA does contain is a \n34 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 39 of 46\n\n \nprohibition of discrimination by reason of an individual’s disability. In Olmstead, the Court held \nthat the “[u]njustified isolation” of individuals with disabilities qualified as “discrimination” \nwithin the meaning of ADA. 527 U.S. at 597. The Court mentioned the integration regulation, \nsee id. at 592-93, 596, 602, but it was not the basis for the decision. \nWhatever the force of the integration regulation in cases not involving claims of \n“unjustified isolation,” in a case such as this one, the regulation does not provide a basis for the \nCourt to order relief not required by Olmstead itself, because a regulation cannot be the basis for \na private cause of action to enforce requirements not set forth in the statute itself, at least in the \nabsence of another statute expressly authorizing such an action. See Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 \nU.S. 275 (2001); Lonberg v. City of Riverside, 571 F.3d 846, 851-52 (9th Cir. 2009) (holding \nthat private litigants cannot sue to enforce an ADA regulation that imposes obligations not found \nin the statute). Nor can the Department of Justice itself authorize private actions to enforce the \nintegration regulation. See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 291-93 (“[I]t is most certainly incorrect to say \nthat language in a regulation can conjure up a private cause of action that has not been authorized \nby Congress.”). \nIn  this  case,  Olmstead,  not the “integration regulation,”   governs  the State’s \nobligations under the ADA.22 \n                                                 \n22 The analysis under the Rehabilitation Act is parallel. Substantively, the statute provides in part: “No \notherwise qualified individual with a disability .  . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disa bility, . . . be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .” 29 \nU.S.C. § 794(a). The same section directs the head  of each agency to “promulgate such regulations as \nmay be necessary to carry out,” id., the statute’s substantive command. And another sect ion confers a \nprivate right of action “to  any person aggrieved by any act or failure to act by  any recipient of Federal \nassistance  or Federal provider of suc h  assistance  under  section 794  of  this  title,”  id.  § 794a(a)(2) \n(emphasis added), but says nothing of action or inaction under the regulations.  \nFor  this reason, Plaintiffs’ argument that DHH  has  waived  its sovereign immunity   under  the \nRehabilitation Act by accepting federal funds m ust be rejected. The provision on which plaintiffs rely  \n(continued…) \n35 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 40 of 46\n\n \nVI.  The Matters That Plaintiffs Claim To Be In Dispute Are Not Material To The ADA \nInquiry. \nPlaintiffs argue (Opp’n 37-40) that there  is a genuine dispute  as to whether it \nwould be “inequitable” to exempt them from the 32-hour cap on LT-PCS and contend that this \nquestion can be resolved only at a trial addressing a slew of factual questions about the needs of \nindividuals with disabilities,23 the services provided for them in Louisiana and elsewhere,24 and \nhow those services are funded.25 Many of these questions are complicated or abstract, some are \n                                                 \napplies only to “suit in Federal court for a violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 . . . or \nthe  provisions  of any   other  Federal  statute  prohibiting  discrimination.”  42 U.S.C. §  2000d-7(a)(1) \n(emphasis added). \n23 Fact issues identified by plaintiffs include: How many hours of care people eligible for LT-PCS might \nactually need to live safely in the community (Opp’n at 19); How long it takes people with disabilities to \nperform ADLs (Opp’n at 19); Whether unmet need  for home care” is “correlate[d]” with “increased risk \nof institutionalization” (Opp’n at 19); Whether the 32-hour cap on LT-PCS puts people at risk of needing \nnursing facility care (Opp’n at 28); How people who currently live in the community can manage to stay \nthere with no more than 32 hours of LT-PCS (Opp’n at 34-35). \n24 Plaintiffs inquire: How Louisiana’s eligibilit y criteria for LT-PCS co mpare with the criteria used in \nother States, including w hether other States “require a nursing facility  level of care,” whether those \nStates’ nursing facility level of care is the same as Louisiana’s, whether other States require all recipients \nto show “imminent risk  of institutionalization,” whether those States define that risk t he same way \nLouisiana does (Opp’n at 21, 32); Whe ther other States use waiver or non-waiver services as their main \nprogram for personal care services (Opp’n at 22, 32); How waiting lists for waiver services  in Louisiana \ncompare with waiting lists in other States (Opp’n at 23); What is the number of waiver and non-waiver \nrecipients in other States (Opp’n at 22); Whether o ther States providing fewer hours of services than  \nLouisiana are in compliance with the ADA (Opp’n at 32). \n25 Issues raised by Plaintiffs include: How much Louisiana spends on waiver services compared to others \nStates (Opp’n at 22, 32); Whether a reduction in LT-PCS services is “necessary for budgetary reasons” \n(Opp’n at 23); Whether past increases in t he per diem reimbursement rate for nursing fa cilities was \nnecessary to continue providing  nursing facility services to those who need t hem (Opp’n at 23); Why \nexpenditures on nursing facilities have increased over the last decade (Opp’n at 24); Why Louisiana has \nreduced its reimbursement rate for LT-PCS by 3.67% since SFY 2006 (Opp’n at 24); What is “the cost of \nproviding  services in  excess  of the 32-hour cap onl y  to those individuals who face  a  risk  of \ninstitutionalization as a result of the cap” (Opp’n at 24); How much would it cost for the plaintiff class to \nbe placed in institutions (Opp’n at 38); Whether the State accurately calculated how much it would save \nfrom reducing the cap on LT-PCS (O pp’n at 37-38); How  much less the State would have saved if it  \nwaived the 32-hour cap f or individuals “at risk of  institutionalization” (Opp’n at 38); W hat is “the \nbudgetary effect of the 32-hour cap” and how this figure should be calculated (Opp’n at 24); Whether the \n32-hour cap will increase “hospitalization or emergency room Medicaid expenditures” and, if so, by how \nmuch (Opp’n at 25); How do Louisiana’s per capita expenditures on HCBS and nursing facilities compare \n(continued…) \n36 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 41 of 46\n\n \ninherently  value-laden,  and others m ay  be unanswerable.  But  none is m aterial  to whether  \nLouisiana has discriminated in its administration of its HCBS programs or whether the State has \nin  place a com prehensive,  effectively worki ng  plan for providing alternatives to nursing \nfacilities. \nThe Court should not accept Plaintiffs’ invitation to explore the intricacies of the \nState’s Medicaid funding in order to determine whether limiting LT-PCS services is “equitable,” \nand  there is no need to consid er  all of the expenditure-relate d  issues raised by Plaintiffs. \nDefendants’ argument here is that the State al ready maintains a comprehensive and successful \nHCBS plan that provides thousands of individuals similarly situated to Plaintiffs with community \ncare. Under Olmstead, that is sufficient. See 527 U.S. at 605-06; cf. Pa. Protection & Advocacy, \n402 F.3d at 381-82 (“When an agency has implemented a sufficient compliance plan (i.e., when \nit has demonstrated a commitment to comply with the ADA and R A), we must be wary of \njudicial mandates that could thwart or undermine the agency’s authority to carry out that plan as \nit sees fit.”). \n“Throughout Olmstead, the Justices’ cautious reluctance to question State funding \ndecisions is apparent,” Ligas v. Maram, No. 05C4331, 2010 W L 1418583, at *2 n.5 (N.D. Ill. \nApr. 7, 2010) (No. 05-4331), and the standardless a nd broad-ranging inquiry Plaintiffs ask the \nCourt to undertake is simply not  appropriate. “[T]he judiciary is not well-suited to superintend \nthe internal budgetary decisi ons of [a state agency],”  Frederick I, 364 F.3d at 498, and “[t]he \npurpose of the [‘integration mandate’] is not to constitute the federal courts the supervisors of the \ncare and treatment of disabled persons.”  Bruggeman, 324 F.3d at 913. Plenary review of a \n                                                 \nwith those of other States (Opp’n at 25-26); How mu ch it would cost to provide “services necessary to \nsustain [individuals who need more than 32 hours of LT-PCS] in the community” (Opp’n at 35). \n37 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 42 of 46\n\n \nState’s expenditures on its entire  Medicaid program for elderly an d disabled adults is highly \nburdensome. Such an unmanageable inquiry is not warranted whenever an individual currently \nreceiving services in the community is shown to be at risk of a temporary institutional placement, \nand Plaintiffs cite no authorit y for the relevance of the innu merable budgetary considerations \nthey think have bearing on the State’s defense.  Cf. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 610 (Kennedy, J., \nconcurring) (noting that because of “the federa lism costs inherent in  referring state decisions \nregarding . . . the allocation of resources to the reviewing authority of the federal courts” “[i]t is \nof central importance .  . . that courts apply [ Olmstead] . . . with appropriate deference to the \nprogram funding decisions of state policym akers”). Appellate courts have not required this \nburdensome inquiry in cases where they have affirmed the entry of summary judgment based on \na State’s comprehensive, effectively working plan. See, e.g., Braddock, 427 F.3d 615; Sanchez, \n416 F.3d 1051. \nVII.  Plaintiffs Have Abandoned Their Remaining Claims. \nPlaintiffs’ “criteria and methods” ADA claim should be dismissed with prejudice \nas abandoned; their Third Claim for Relief should be dismissed without prejudice as unripe. \nThe  Complaint  included as an altern ative  basis for relief under the ADA \nallegations that “Defendants have utilized crit eria and methods of administration that subject \nPlaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of disability, including unnecessary institutionalization, \nby (1) failing to assess properly the services and s upports that would enable Plaintiffs to rem ain \nin the community and (2) denying Plaintiffs access to Medicaid-covered services that will meet \ntheir needs in the community . . . .” Compl. ¶107 (ADA claim); see also id. ¶110 (Rehabilitation \nAct claim). The Complaint also described the evolution from 2003 to the present of Defendants’ \nmethodology for allocating hours among LT-PCS recipients.  Id. ¶¶31-34. Plaintiffs also discuss \nthe  allocation m ethodology  in th eir  opposition brief. (O pp’n  at  18-19)  At the sam e  time, \n38 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 43 of 46\n\n \nPlaintiffs now maintain that they “are not challenging the ch ange in allocation methodology in \nthis case.” (Opp’n at 19 n.105) \nBecause the Complaint clearly incorporated allegations that the State’s allocation \nmethodology discriminated in some fashion and  because Plaintiffs have expressly abandoned \nthat theory, their “criteria and methods” claims should be dismissed with prejudice. See Michel v. \nSaint-Gobain Containers, Inc., Civ. A, 05-207, 2005 W L 3339568, at *2 (W.D. La. Dec. 8, \n2005) (unpublished) (dismissing with prejudice claims abandoned by the plaintiff); Woodland v. \nNalco  Chem. Co. ,  Civ.  A 01-3337, 2004 WL 253442, at   *1 (E.D. La. Feb. 10, 2004) \n(unpublished) (same), aff’d, 114 Fed. App’x 150, 2004 WL 2722523 (5th Cir. Nov. 22, 2004). \nPlaintiffs  concede that all of their claim s  not  founded on the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act “may be premature.” Opp’n to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss at 22. This is \nin effect an acknowledgement that the claims are unripe and that the Cour t lacks jurisdiction to \nhear them. See Roark & Hardee L P v. City of Austin, 522 F.3d 533, 544 n.12 (5th Cir. 2008). \nThe Court should therefore dismiss Plaintiffs’ Third Claim for Relief under Rule 12(b)(1). \nVIII.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants resp ectfully request that the Co urt enter \njudgment in their favor on Plaintiffs’ First and  Second Claims for Relief and dismiss Plaintiffs’ \nThird Claim for Relief for lack of jurisdiction. \n39 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39     03/30/11   Page 44 of 46\n\n \nDated: March 30, 2011        Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Kimberly Humbles  \nKimberly Humbles \nLa.

L.C. ,  527 U.S. 581 (1999).  W hile  the  Olmstead  Court  affirmed  that “undue \ninstitutionalization” is a form of discrimination, id. at 597, the Court expressly disavowed a  \nconstruction of the ADA that would require States  to “provide a certain  level of benefits to \nindividuals with disabilities,” id. at 603 n. 14; acknowledged that individuals m ay have to wait \nfor a community placement or have to seek institutional services from time to time, id. at 605-06; \ndeclined to address th e validity of the DOJ’s  “integration regulation,” id. at 592 (“We recite \nthese regulations with the caveat that we do not here determine their validity.”); and rejected as \n“unacceptable” the “fundamental alteration” test of the court below (which DOJ urged the Court \n- 1 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 48     04/15/11   Page 1 of 12\n\n \nto affirm), id. at 603, because it did not leave States  with sufficient “leeway” “to m aintain a \nrange of facilities and to administer services with an even hand,” id. at 605. \nTwelve years later, the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division has atte mpted to rewrite the \nSupreme  Court’s  Olmstead  decision in its ow n  image,  through a series of “Statem ents  of \nInterest” filed in cases, like this one, where States have attempted to implement changes to their \nhome  and community-based services (“HCBS”)  programs  for individuals  with  disabilities.  \nWhile some district courts have accepted the position advanced, others (not mentioned by DOJ) \nhave rejected it as not consistent with the statute or the governing case law.  See M.R. v. Dreyfus, \n2011 WL 588511, at *12-15 & n.42 (W .D. Wash. Feb. 9, 2011) (to be published);  Boyd v. \nSteckel, 2010 WL 4683997, at *10-12 & n.19 (M.D. Ala.  Nov. 12, 2010) (to be published).  A \ncareful reading of the Olmstead decision confirms that DOJ’s interpretation of the statute cannot \nbe sustained.  Like the district courts in Washington and Alabama, this Court should decline the \nDOJ’s invitation to read into the ADA requirements that the Supreme Court has already said are \nnot there. \nI.  There  Is No Sound Basis Fo r  Holding  That  An Individual “At Ris k  Of \nInstitutionalization” Has Been Subjected To Discrimination Under The ADA. \nThe DOJ contends that the ADA requires St ates to offer all individuals with \ndisabilities a level of hom e- and community-based services (“HCBS”) adequate to ensure that \nnone faces any risk of institutional placement. (DOJ Br. at 10-17) This argument is inconsistent \nwith Supreme Court precedent and has no foundation in the ADA: Recognition that “unjustified \ninstitutional isolation of persons with disabilities” is a form of discrimination does not mean that \nthere  is an affir mative  obligation to provide se rvices  to elim inate  any  risk of   institutional \nplacement, however temporary.  Persons at risk of institutionalization, by definition, are living in \ntheir homes and communities and are not iso lated.  DOJ fails to provide a rationale for how \n- 2 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 48     04/15/11   Page 2 of 12\n\n \nindividuals who are not isolated have a claim  for discrimination simply because there is som e \ndegree of “risk” that they may in the future require institution-based services for a limited time. \nAs previously argued, Supreme Court precedent forecloses the argument that the \ngeneral  discrimination  prohibitions  in the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act require States to \nprovide a certain level or type of  services to individuals with disabilities. (Reply Br. at 12-14 \n(discussing Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603 & n.14, and  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 302-03, \n309 (1985))).  In fact, DOJ’s own rules expressly state that they do not require “a public entity to \nprovide  to individuals with disa bilities  personal devices, su ch  as wheelchairs ;  individually \nprescribed devices, such as prescription eyeglasses or hearing aids; readers for personal use or \nstudy; or services of a personal nature including assistance in eating, toileting, or dressing.” 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.135 (2010) (emphasis added). This provision “serves  as a limitation on all of the \nrequirements of the regulation,” 56 Fe d. Reg. 35,694, 35,707 (July 26,  1991), and expressly \napplies to the rule requiring reasonable service modifications, id. (citing § 35.130(b)(7)).  \nWhile DOJ purports to agree tha t the ADA does not require a m inimum level of \nservices, it contends th at a State discriminates when it f ails to provide sufficient HCBS to \neliminate the risk that an individual with a disability will require institutional care. (DOJ Br. at \n10 n.10) That response completely fails to acknowledge that the DOJ’s rule in fact establishes a \nminimum level of services—the amount needed to avoid institutionalization— a result that is in \nno way consistent with the governing Supreme Court precedent. \nMoreover, the DOJ’s proposed standard—t hat a State has discrim inated against \nany individual who is “at risk of institutionalization”—is as vague as it is sweeping.1 As the DOJ \n                                                      \n1 The DOJ’s standard is also shifting. J ust a year ago, the DOJ was telling c ourts that discrimination \nrequired  a “ serious  risk  of  being institutionalized.” Brief   for t he  United States  as  Amicus  Curiae \n(continued…) \n- 3 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 48     04/15/11   Page 3 of 12\n\n \nrecognizes, an individual must be “at risk of  nursing facility placement” to receive LT-PCS \nservices in the first place – it is one of the eligibility criteria for the program. (DOJ Br. at 7) The \npopulation served by L T-PCS, the ADHC and EDA  waivers, and similar programs in other \nStates is comprised of people who are elderly and disabled. Whether or not they receive personal \ncare assistance, everyone in that population is “at  risk of institutionalization” to some degree. A \nshort  stay in a hospital or rehabilitation  in  a nursing hom e  is not uncommon, and often \nunavoidable. HCBS programs can mitigate the “risk” that institutional services will be needed. \nThey can postpone the need for in stitutional placement. But they cannot eliminate the “risk.” \nIndeed, two of the persistent difficulties of ad ministering an HCBS program for the elderly and \nindividuals with adult-onset disabilities are gauging who is likely to require institutional care and \nassessing the relative needs of a diverse group of individuals, all  of whom are to some extent \nvulnerable. See Pls.’ Exh. 1, Deposition of Hugh Eley at  137 (line 4) to 138 (line 13) (ECF No. \n38-3, pages 138-139 of 455). That a recip ient of LT-PCS is “at risk of institutionalization” does \nnot mean that she has a meritorious ADA claim; it simply means she is like everyone else being \nserved in one of the programs administered by OAAS.   \nDefendants’ Reply Brief explained why most cases cited by the DOJ are off-point \nor wrong, but the DOJ relies on two district court cases (one unpublished) from the Ninth Circuit \nthat  warrant a response here. Specifical ly,  the DOJ asks this Court to follow  Brantley  v. \nMaxwell-Jolly, 656 F. Supp. 2d 1161 (N.D. Cal. 2009), appeal docketed, No. 10-15635 (9th Cir. \nMar. 24, 2010), and Ball v. Rogers, No. 00-cv-0067, 2009 WL 1395423 (D. Ariz. Apr. 24, 2009) \n(ECF No. 394), appeal docketed, No. 09-16022 (9th Cir. May 19, 2009). The Brantley court held \n                                                      \nSupporting Plaintiffs-Appellees at 13, Oster v. Wagner, No. 09-17581 (9th Cir. Mar. 2, 2010) (emphasis \nadded). \n- 4 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 48     04/15/11   Page 4 of 12\n\n \nthat California’s decision to pr ovide only three days of ADHC serv ices instead of the previous \nfive, 656 F. Supp. 2d at 1164, was discrim inatory because the State did not have “any measures \nin place to ensure th at the transition from ADHC service to alternative [HCBS] services is  \nseemless [sic],” id. at 1175. The  Ball court similarly held that Arizona’s “failure to provide \nadequate  services to avoid  unnecessary  gaps in s ervice  and  institutionalization  was \ndiscriminatory.” 2009 WL 1395423, at *5.  \nNeither Brantley nor Ball is sound authority, if for no other reason than because \nneither court applied  Olmstead’s test for unjustified institutionalization.  See Brantley, 656 F. \nSupp. 2d at 1169-75; Ball, 2009 WL 1395423, at *4. Both relied instead on Townsend v. Quasim, \n328 F.3d 511, 519 (9th Cir. 2003), for the proposition that an “integration mandate claim” should \nbe  analyzed “under the traditional test appl icable  to ADA claim s  brought  under Title II.” \nBrantley, 656 F. Supp. 2d at 1170 & n.3;  see also Ball, 2009 WL 1395423, at *4. They did so \neven though Olmstead is controlling Supreme Court precedent and ev en though Ninth Circuit  \ndecisions after Townsend have correctly app lied Olmstead, see, e.g., Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 \nF.3d 1051 (9th Cir. 2005). Although the  Brantley court also stated that “Plaintiffs have made a \nsufficient showing under either form ulation,” 656 F. Supp. 2d at 1170 n.3, the court never  \nexplained how its decision squared with Olmstead, and the Ball court’s analysis was even more \nsummary.  This Court should adhere to  Olmstead  and not adopt the am orphous  “risk of \ninstitutionalization” standard of Brantley and Ball. \nThe DOJ further suggests th at an individual who is at  risk of requiring nursing \nfacility care even for a short period before the State offers her a slot in an HCBS waiver program \nhas  been discrim inated  against no less th an  an individual who endures prolonged  \ninstitutionalization  despite  the ava ilability  of  appropriate waiver sl ots.  (DOJ Br. at 12) \n- 5 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 48     04/15/11   Page 5 of 12\n\n \nDefendants  previously explained (Reply Br .  at 13, 20-21) that th e  ADA’s prohibition of \n“unjustified isolation of individuals with disabilities,” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597, is lim ited to \ncases of “continued confinement in a segregated environment,” id. at 593. The Olmstead Court \nrecognized as much when it observed that indi viduals who are qualified for HCBS “may need \ninstitutional care from time to time” when their needs exceed the level of care available in the \ncommunity.  Id.  at 605. Given the opportunity to res pond  to Defendant’s reliance on this \nlanguage in Olmstead, the DOJ only notes that three district  courts have concluded otherwise. \nDefendants submit that the Supreme Court is the better authority. \nBased on its finding that, “historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate \nindividuals  with disabilities,” 42 U.S.C.  § 12101(a)(2),  Congress prohibited “unjustified \ninstitutionalization” as a for m of discrimination under the ADA,  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597. \nDOJ’s leap from “unjustified institutionalization” to a “risk of institutionalization,” especially \nwhen any institutional stay is likely to be temporary, is simply another means of arguing that the \nstatute requires a minimum level of services; th at leap is not supported by the language of the  \nstatute and should be rejected.   \nII.  It Is Not Disputed That At Least Three Of The Four Named Plaintiffs Could Access \nADHC Services. \nPlaintiffs have indicated that they  cannot supplement their LT-PCS hours with \nservices provided through the ADHC waiver b ecause there are not ADH C facilities in every \ncorner of the State and because there is a wait of five months for some individuals. (Opp’n at 15-\n16) Defendants presented undisputed evidence that three of the four plaintiffs live no m ore than \n10 miles away from an ADHC facility that will provide them with the necessary transportation, \nSUF ¶¶85-88, and that Plaintiffs would have al ready been offered ADHC services had they \napplied when they filed this lawsuit, SUF ¶¶93-94. \n- 6 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 48     04/15/11   Page 6 of 12\n\n \nThe DOJ acknowledges these facts only in  a footnote, and it has little to say. \n(DOJ Br. at 16 n.12) T here it notes that there may not be an  ADHC facility that will provide \ntransportation  to and f rom  the current re sidence  of Kenneth Rom an,  and it says that the \navailability of ADHC services is a “disputed fact.” It is not clear whether the DOJ thinks this fact \nis disputed as to all Plaintiffs or only as to Kenneth Roman. If the former, there is no basis in the \nrecord for that contention, and the DOJ cites nothing to support its statement.  If the latter, DOJ \ndoes not explain why the location of a single plaintiff is material in light of the Supreme Court’s \nadmonition, in Olmstead, that the proper focus of the ADA inquiry is not on the immediate relief \nsought by individual plaintiffs but on the “responsibility the State has undertaken for the care and \ntreatment of a large and diverse population of persons with . . . disabilities.” 527 U.S. at 604.  \nIII.  The  DOJ Has Wron gly  Argued The “Com prehensive  Plan” Defense Out of \nExistence. \nThe DOJ argues that “[c]ourts have strictly interpreted the requirement that a state \ndemonstrate it has in place a com prehensive, effectively working plan in offering an alleged \nfundamental alteration defense.” (DOJ Br . at 18 n.15) This is not correct. In  Olmstead, the \nSupreme Court explained that the funda mental-alteration defense gives States “m ore leeway” \nthan  the courts below (and the DOJ as am icus)  allowed, 527 U.S. at 605, and that any \nconstruction of the defense that  “would leave the State virtually  defenseless” is “unacceptable,” \nid. at 603. Lower courts have explained that States bear only a “minimal burden,” Pa. Protection \n& Advocacy, Inc. v. Pa. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 402 F.3d 374, 382 (3d Cir. 2005), and that courts \nmust “be sympathetic to fundamental alteration defenses,” Arc of Wash. State Inc. v. Braddock , \n427 F.3d 615, 618 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that a State’s HCBS program was comprehensive and \neffectively working). \n- 7 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 48     04/15/11   Page 7 of 12\n\n \nThe DOJ not only strictly construes the  “comprehensive plan” defense; it argues \nthe defense is entirely unavailable in cases where HCBS recipients challenge a service reduction. \n(Br. at 18-19) This argum ent gets things preci sely backwards, and the DOJ cites no judicial \ndecision  that endorses it. Adopting the DOJ’s  rule  would be counter-productive. The rule \nrequires a State to devote unlimited resources to individuals already receiving HCBS even when \nthose resources could otherwise help other persons at risk of institutionalization or already \ninstitutionalized persons leave nursing facilities. It makes it harder for a State that does provide \nHCBS to mount a defense than it  is for a State that offers none . And it discourages States from \ncreating state plan services like LT -PCS, which (unlike waiver services) are not subject to  \nenrollment caps. No wonder no court has agreed with this position.2 \nOnce it turns to the m erits of Louisiana’s comprehensive plan, the D OJ offers \nonly a tepid endorsement of Plaintiffs’ position. (DOJ Br. at 19-20)  The DOJ does not support \nPlaintiffs’ primary argument (that Louisiana lacks a “comprehensive, effectively working plan” \nbecause no single piece of paper sets forth the State’s policies for providing HCBS to individuals \nwith adult-onset disabilities). Instead, the DOJ su mmarily states that Plaintiffs “have raised  a \nnumber of factual issues.” ( DOJ Br. at 19) The DOJ does not suggest which of the dozens of \n“factual issues” raised by Plaintiffs are actually material or whether a trial would need to explore \nall of them. Nor could the DOJ provide significant insight on this question given its position that \nthe “comprehensive plan” defense is inapplicable to States that have successful HCBS programs. \n                                                      \n2  Employment  discrimination  cases ari sing  under t he  ADA confirm  that the fundam ental-alteration \ndefense is available even when a plaintiff seeks to maintain the status quo or to regain services that were \nprovided voluntarily in the past. See, e.g., Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 284 (4th Cir.1995) (“A particular \naccommodation  is not neces sarily  reasonable, and t hus  federally  mandated,  simply  because  the \n[employer] elects to establish it as a  matter of policy.”). These cases provide important guidance in the \nOlmstead context. See 527 U.S. at 606 n.16. \n- 8 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 48     04/15/11   Page 8 of 12\n\n \nThe upshot of the DOJ’s position is that,  in its view, a State discrim inates under \nthe ADA if it does not provide HCBS adequate to ensure that no individual with a disability risks \neven a temporary ins titutional placement. Once an individual shows that she is “at risk of \ninstitutionalization,” the State either has no de fense to that individual’s ADA claim or has to \ndefend every aspect of its entire Medicaid program in a lengthy and open-ended trial. This is not \nwhat Congress intended when it prohibited discrimination against individuals with disabilities or \nwhat the Supreme Court anticipated when it agreed that such discrimination includes unjustified \nisolation. Indeed, the Olmstead Court emphasized that a “State’s responsibility, once it provides \ncommunity-based treatment to qualified persons with disabilities, is not boundless.” 527 U.S. at \n603.  \nIV.  The  DOJ’s “Most Integrated Setting” Regulation Does Not Create A Right To \nHCBS Beyond What Olmstead Requires. \nDefendants have argued that Plaintiffs lack a private right of action to enforce the \nDOJ’s  integration regulation, 28 C.F.R. §  35.130(d),  to  the e xtent  the r egulation  imposes \nrequirements  not contained in the ADA itself .  (Reply Br. at 34-35) The DOJ’s response \nmisunderstands either Defendants’ argument or the relevant Supreme Court precedent. \nThe  DOJ apparently believ es  that  if  its inte gration  regulation  is “ valid  and \nreasonable,” then it is enforceable through a priv ate right of action.  (DOJ Br. at 20) This is \nplainly wrong. In  Alexander v. Sandoval, the Supreme Court considered whether there was a \nprivate right of action to enfo rce DOJ regulations promulgated under Title VI and prohibiting \nactivities that had a disparate  impact on the basis of race.  532 U.S. 275, 278 (2001). The Court \nassumed that the disparate-impact regulations were a valid and reasonabl e interpretation of the \nstatute, id. at 281-82, but went on to hold that the regulations were not privately enforceable, see \nid. at 284-93. \n- 9 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 48     04/15/11   Page 9 of 12\n\n \nUnder Sandoval, the question is not whether th e integration regulation is “valid \nand reasonable” but whether it “applies” th e ADA’s prohibition on discrimination. “We do not \ndoubt that regulations  applying § 601’s ban on intentional di scrimination are covered by the \ncause of action to enforce that section,”  id. at 284 (em phasis added), the Court explained in \nSandoval,  but  “[i]t  is clear  now that the  disparate-impact regula tions  do not simply apply \n§ 601—since they indeed forbid conduct that §  601 permits—and therefore clear that the private \nright of action to enforce § 601 does not include a private right to enforce these regulations.” Id. \nat 285 (emphasis added). Thus, the holding of  Sandoval is that the p rivate right of action to \nenforce a statute does not includ e a private right to enforce its implementing regulations (even \nvalid and reasonable ones) when  the regulations prohibit conduct not prohibited by the statute \nitself. \nDefendants’ real disagreement with the DOJ is about what the text of the ADA \nitself does or does not require. As Defendants  have explained, the ADA’s prohibition of the \nunjustified isolation and segregation of individuals with disabilities in institutions is not so broad \nas to require the State to provide HCBS adequate  to ensure that no individual with a disability \never sets foot in an institution, even for a temporary stay. The DOJ’s argument to the contrary is \ninconsistent with governing preced ent, has been adopted b y no court of appeals, and “would \nleave the State virtually defenseless once it is shown that the plaintiff is qualified for the service \nor program she seeks.” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603. As the Supr eme Court explained when it \ndisagreed with the DOJ’s endorsement of  the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in  Olmstead, that \nargument “is unacceptable.” Id. \nV.  Conclusion \nThe DOJ offers no sound basis for denyi ng the motion for summary judgment, \nand Defendants respectfully request that the motion be granted. \n- 10 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 48     04/15/11   Page 10 of 12\n\n \nDated: April 13, 2011      Respectfully  submitted, \n \n  /s/ Kimberly Humbles  \nKimberly Humbles \nLa.

Background \nUndisputed Fact  Evidence \n1.  The Department of Health and Hospitals (“DHH”) is the  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \nstate agency responsible for the development and provision  § 36:251(B) (2010). \nof health and medical services for the citizens of Louisiana, \nand it provides health and medical services for the uninsured \nand medically indigent citizens of the State. \n2.  The Office of Aging and Adult Services (“OAAS”) is the  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \nagency within DHH responsible for programs related to the  § 36:258(F) (2010). \nlong-term care of the elderly and the protection and long-\nterm care of persons with adult-onset disabilities. \n3.  OAAS maintains several programs that serve recipients  First Eley Decl. ¶7. \noutside of institutional settings by providing home- and \ncommunity-based services (“HCBS”) funded through the \nMedicaid program. \n4.  Louisiana currently makes personal care services available  First Eley Decl. ¶7. \nto individuals with adult-onset disabilities through four \nHCBS programs: the Elderly and Disabled Adult (“EDA”) \nwaiver; the Adult Day Health Care (“ADHC”) waiver; the \nLong-Term Personal Care Services (“LT-PCS”) program; \nand the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly \n(“PACE”). \n5.  Pursuant to the Medicaid statute, Louisiana limits the  First Eley Decl. ¶¶18, 25. \nnumber of recipients that can be served through the EDA \nand ADHC waivers at any given time, and these limits are \napproved by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices (“CMS”). \n6.  Because LT-PCS is a Medicaid state plan service, rather  First Eley Decl. ¶33. \nthan a waiver, the State cannot cap the number of recipients. \n \n- 4 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39-1     03/30/11   Page 4 of 17\n\n \nII.  Louisiana’s HCBS Programs Have Grown Continuously for a Decade. \nA.  The Number of HCBS Recipients Has Steadily Increased While the Number \nof Nursing Facility Residents Has Steadily Dropped. \nUndisputed Fact  Evidence \n7.  It is the policy of DHH “to serve the greatest number of  Eley Tr. 181 (line 25) to 182 \npeople that [it] can serve given the funding that is available.” (line 1). \n8.  In SFY 2000, only 1,030 individuals received HCBS, while  Second Eley Decl. att. A. \n34,727 individuals received nursing facility services. \n9.  In SFY 2000, approximately 97% of individuals receiving  First Eley Decl. ¶9; Second \nMedicaid-funded long-term care obtained those services in a  Eley Decl. att. A. \nnursing facility, while 3% received HCBS. \n10. In SFY 2010, State Medicaid funds paid for 18,215  Second Eley Decl. att. A. \nindividuals to receive HCBS, while they paid for 29,392 \nindividuals to receive nursing facility services. \n11. In SFY 2010, approximately 62% of individuals receiving  First Eley Decl. ¶9. \nlong-term care obtained those services in a nursing facility, \nwhile 38% received HCBS. \n12. When monthly, as opposed to annual, populations are  First Eley Decl. ¶9. \nconsidered, the ratio of HCBS-to-institutional recipients \nmore strongly favors HCBS; in June 2010, for example, \n42% of long-term care recipients were being served in \nHCBS and 58% in institutions. \n13. By SFY 2010, the HCBS population had increased by  Second Eley Decl. att. A. \n1668% since SFY 2000 and by 224% since SFY 2005. \n14. There were approximately 15% fewer recipients of nursing  Second Eley Decl. att. A. \nfacility services in SFY 2010 than in SFY 2000. \n15. The number of individuals receiving HCBS in Louisiana has  First Eley Decl. att. A; \nincreased every year since SFY 2000.  Second Eley Decl. att. A. \n16. The number of individuals receiving nursing facility services  Second Eley Decl. att. A. \nhas decreased every year since SFY 2001 save one, \nfollowing Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. \n17. Louisiana has traditionally had the highest or nearly the  Eley Tr. 27 (lines 1-12). \nhighest number of nursing home beds per capita in the \ncountry. \n18. Now Louisiana has a nursing home occupancy rate lower  Eley Tr. 31 (lines 19-21). \n- 5 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39-1     03/30/11   Page 5 of 17\n\n \nthan almost any other State. \n19. Individuals who receive HCBS generally receive more one- Second Eley Decl. ¶31. \non-one care than individuals in nursing facilities.  Except for \na few categories of individuals, the minimum requirement \nfor direct care in a nursing facility is 2.35 hours per resident \nper day. \n \nB.  Expenditures on HCBS Have Generally Grown at a Faster Pace than \nExpenditures on Nursing Facilities and Other Programs. \nUndisputed Fact  Evidence \n20. In SFY 2000, expenditures for HCBS were $8,101,961,  Second Eley Decl. ¶4. \nwhile expenditures for nursing facilities were $503,992,717. \nLess than 2% of expenditures were on HCBS \n21. In SFY 2005, expenditures for HCBS were $79,613,310,  Second Eley Decl. att. C. \nwhile expenditures for nursing facilities were $624,081,039. \nAbout 17% of expenditures were for HCBS. \n22. In SFY 2010, expenditures for HCBS were $300,538,453,  Second Eley Decl. att. C. \nwhile expenditures for nursing facilities were $737,529,166. \nAbout 29% of expenditures went to HCBS. \n23. DHH expects HCBS expenditures for SFY 2011 to be  Second Eley Decl. att. D. \n$311,060,252. \n24. Once adjusted for inflation, per capita expenditures for  Kaye Decl. at ¶12. \nnursing facility services have declined since SFY 2000. \n25. Between SFYs 2005 and 2010, expenditures for HCBS  Second Eley Decl. att. C. \nincreased by 277.5% while expenditures for nursing \nfacilities increased by approximately 18%. \n26. In the five-year period between SFY 2005 and SFY 2010,  Second Eley Decl. att. C. \nLT-PCS was the second-fastest growing line item in the \nState’s entire Medicaid budget. The only service for which \nexpenditures grew faster—the public psychiatric free \nstanding unit—saw all of its growth in SFY 2010, but its \nbudget is only 25% of LT-PCS expenditures. In three of the \nfive years, no service’s budget grew faster than LT-PCS’s. \n \n- 6 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39-1     03/30/11   Page 6 of 17\n\n \nIII.  Long-Term Personal Care Services (“LT-PCS”) \nA.  The LT-PCS Program Has Expanded Dramatically Since Its Inception. \nUndisputed Fact  Evidence \n27. In SFY 2005, Louisiana added the LT-PCS program to the  Eley Tr. 62 (line 22) to 63 \nexisting array of HCBS programs providing personal care  (line 2); First Eley Decl. ¶35. \nservices. \n28. In SFY 2005, there were 1,402 individuals who received  Second Eley Decl. att. A. \nLT-PCS but no waiver services, and that number has \nincreased every year since: to 2,939 in SFY 2006; to 5,421 \nin SFY 2007; to 7,536 in SFY 2008; to 9,216 in SFY 2009; \nand to 12,295 in SFY 2010. \n29. The LT-PCS population grew by 777% between SFY 2005  Second Eley Decl. att. A. \nand SFY 2010. \n30. By the end of February 2011, the State had served 12,571  Second Eley Decl. ¶6. \nLT-PCS recipients in SFY 2011. \n31. There is currently a net increase of approximately 130 LT- Second Eley Decl. ¶6. \nPCS recipients every month, and DHH expects significant \ngrowth in the program due to the State’s aging population \nand changes in Medicaid’s eligibility rules. \n32. Until June 2010, participants in the EDA waiver received  Eley Tr. 63 (line 19) to 66 \ntheir personal care services through the LT-PCS program.  (line 8). \n33. Individuals who do not also receive EDA services can  First Eley Decl. ¶26; Second \nsupplement their LT-PCS with ADHC services.  Eley Decl. ¶13. \n34. If individuals who also receive waiver services are included,  Second Eley Decl. att.

In SFY 2005, expenditures on the LT-PCS program totaled  Second Eley Decl. att. C. \n$33,519,293.  Expenditures increased by 115.48% in SFY \n2006 (to $72,226,870); by 67.76% in SFY 2007 (to \n$121,164,204); by 60.21% in SFY 2008 (to $194,115,778); \nand by another 25.02% in SFY 2009 (to $242,683,496).  In \nSFY 2010, expenditures decreased by 2.09% (to \n$237,616,920). \n36. DHH estimated that the 32-hour cap on LT-PCS will allow  Eley Tr. 201 (lines 2-13). \nit to avoid new expenditures of $5 million annually in SFY \n- 7 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39-1     03/30/11   Page 7 of 17\n\n \n2011 and $24 million annually in SFY 2012. \n \nB.  Reductions to the LT-PCS Service Cap Have Not Increased the Rate of \nNursing Facility Admissions. \nUndisputed Fact  Evidence \n37. From the inception of the LT-PCS program until March  Eley Tr. 66 (lines 5-8). \n2009, recipients could receive up to 56 hours of personal \ncare services per week. \n38. Effective March 20, 2009, the 56-hour cap was reduced to  La. Admin. Code tit. 50, \n42 hours. Individuals who were already receiving LT-PCS  § 12915(A), 35 La. Reg. 401, \nbefore March 20 were able to continue receiving more than  402 (Mar. 2009); Eley Tr. 59 \n42 hours per week until their next annual reassessment.  (lines 5-20). \n39. Prior to reducing the LT-PCS cap to 42 hours, DHH  Second Eley Decl. ¶7. \ndiscussed the issue with class counsel in the Barthelemy \nlitigation, including lead counsel in the Pitts case. \n40. The Barthelemy class counsel agreed to the reduction in the  Second Eley Decl. ¶7; Second \nLT-PCS cap, and the change was incorporated into the  Eley Decl. att. E. \nSettlement Agreement. \n41. Prior to the implementation of the 42-hour cap on LT-PCS,  Second Eley Decl. ¶8. \n18% of recipients received at least 42 hours of services. \n42. There were 941 individuals who received more than 42  Second Eley Decl. ¶8. \nhours of LT-PCS per week prior to March 2009 who \nsubsequently received fewer than 42 hours. \n43. In August 2010, OAAS reduced the service cap to 32 hours  La. Admin. Code tit. 50, \nof LT-PCS per week.  § 12915(A), 36 La. Reg. \n1749, 1752 (Aug. 2010). \n44.

Individuals who were already receiving LT-PCS  Reg. 1749, 1749 (Aug. 2010). \nbefore September 5 may continue receiving more than 32 \nhours per week until their next annual reassessment. \n45. Prior to the implementation of the new 32-hour maximum,  First Eley Decl. ¶37; Eley Tr. \napproximately 28% of LT-PCS recipients (approximately  161 (lines 1-3). \n3300 individuals) were receiving greater than 32 hours of \nservices every week.

The Elderly and Disabled Adults (“EDA”) waiver is another  First Eley Decl. ¶14-21. \nof Louisiana’s HCBS programs that provides long-term care \nto individuals with adult-onset disabilities. \n54. EDA recipients are given a “budget” they can allocate  First Eley Decl. ¶16. \ntoward a variety of services offered through the program. \n55. The maximum EDA budget, which is currently about  First Eley Decl. ¶16; Eley Tr. \n$40,046 annually, represents 120% of the average cost of  72 (lines 9-13); Opp’n at 14. \nnursing facility care. \n56. The maximum EDA budget “would certainly be adequate to  Opp’n at 14. \nmaintain the Plaintiffs and others like them at home, and \nprevent their having to enter an institution for care.” \n57.

The EDA waiver is currently capped at 4,603 slots.  First Eley Decl. ¶18. \n60. Because the EDA waiver is full, DHH maintains a “Request  First Eley Decl. ¶18. \nfor Services Registry” or “waiting list” for individuals who \nwant EDA services. \n61. Slots in the EDA waiver are offered first to applicants in  First Eley Decl. ¶18. \ncertain priority groups and then according to the date they \napplied for the waiver. \n62. Currently, three groups have priority for EDA slots:  La. Admin. Code tit. 50, \n(1) individuals who are victims of abuse or neglect and who  § 8105(B), 37 La. Reg. 18, 19 \nwould require institutional placement to avoid further abuse  (Jan. 2011). \nand neglect unless they are enrolled in the waiver program; \n(2) individuals with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou \nGehrig’s disease); and (3) individuals who have been in a \nnursing facility for 90 consecutive days. \n63. Individuals in any of the three groups with priority over LT- First Eley Decl. ¶18. \nPCS recipients are offered slots as they become available.  \n64. As of March 29, 2011, every individual on the EDA  Second Eley Decl. ¶23.  \nRegistry who was in one of the high priority groups had \nalready received an EDA offer. \n65. Once an EDA offer is extended, it takes an average of 60 to  Eley Tr. 88 (lines 3-8); \n90 days for services to begin—depending on the individual  Second Eley Decl. ¶24. \ncircumstances of the applicant—while the support \ncoordinator meets with the individual and completes their \nevaluation, determines the recipient’s EDA budget, helps \ndevelop a comprehensive plan of care tailored to the \nindividual’s needs and preferences, and helps find the \nrecipient housing (if necessary). \n66. Individuals may qualify for a priority EDA offer due to a 90- Eley Tr. 87 (lines 6-11); \nday stay in a nursing facility even if they have not forfeited  Second Eley Decl. ¶22. \ntheir residence in the community while staying in the \nnursing facility. \n67.

Until October 2010, EDA applicants who did not currently  La. Admin. Code tit. 50, \nreceive HCBS were given priority over those who were  § 8105(B), 35 La. Reg. 2447, \nalready receiving HCBS through other programs, including  2447 (Nov. 2009). \nLT-PCS.  \n69. In October 2010, in connection with the reduction in the  36 La. Reg. 2217, 2218 (Oct. \nmaximum number of hours from 42 to 32, DHH amended its  2010) (amending La.

As of October 19, 2010, DHH was offering EDA waiver  First Eley Decl. ¶20. \nslots to individuals who were not currently receiving HCBS \nand who applied for a waiver by April 15, 2008, while LT-\nPCS recipients who applied prior to that date remained on \nthe Registry without an offer. \n71. After revising the priority groups in October 2010, DHH  First Eley Decl. ¶20. \nbegan offering EDA slots to LT-PCS recipients who applied \nfor the waiver before April 15, 2008. \n72. DHH most recently offered EDA slots to LT-PCS recipients  Second Eley Decl. ¶21. \nwho applied for the waiver on or before November 30, 2007.\n73. All four named plaintiffs are on the EDA Registry.  Since  Opp’n at 28 n.148; First Eley \nthe Pitts lawsuit was filed, two named plaintiffs (Helen Pitts  Decl. ¶21. \nand Denise Hodges) have been offered EDA slots, as has the \nonly unnamed plaintiff identified in the pleadings (Cleo \nLancaster). \n74. Until October 2010, individuals who were admitted to a  La. Admin. Code tit. 50, \nnursing facility were given priority EDA offers regardless of  § 8105(B)(2), 35 La. Reg. \nhow long they had stayed there.  2447, 2447 (Nov. 2009). \n75. DHH adopted the rule limiting priority offers to individuals  Eley Tr. 78 (line 20) to 82 \nwho have been in a nursing facility for 90 consecutive days  (line 4); Second Eley Decl. \nto address a situation where some individuals were only in  att. G. \nneed of nursing home care for a short period (for example, \nfor rehabilitation after a hospital stay), or were trying to \navoid the waiting list by entering a nursing home for a brief \nstay and then returning home to wait for their EDA offer. \n76. DHH concluded that 90 days was an appropriate duration for  Eley Tr. 81 (line 12) to 83 \nthe length-of-stay requirement because that is the standard  (line 10); 42 U.S.C. § 1396a \nused by the federal government in the Money Follows the  note, as amended, Patient \n- 11 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39-1     03/30/11   Page 11 of 17\n\n \nPerson Program to determine who is at risk of being a long- Protection and Affordable \nterm resident of a nursing facility.

The HCBS Redesign Workgroup included officials from  Decl. of Jeanne Abadie, at ¶2. \nOAAS and several stakeholder advocacy groups—including \nthe Advocacy Center—and was intended to solicit these \ngroups’ input on changes to the State’s HCBS offerings. \n79. The consensus of the Workgroup was that DHH should  Eley Tr. 81 (lines 20-25); \nrevise its policy to adopt a length-of-stay requirement.  Second Eley Decl. att. F; \nSecond Eley Decl. att. H. \n80. The Workgroup also reached a consensus that 90 days was  Eley Tr. 81 (line 16) to 82 \nan appropriate duration for the length-of-stay requirement.  (line 4). \n81. The number of EDA recipients grew steadily from 552 in  Second Eley Decl. att. A. \nSFY 2000 to 4,870 in SFY 2010. \n82. Expenditures on the EDA waiver increased by 43% between  Second Eley Decl. att. C. \nSFY 2005 and SFY 2010. \n \nV.  Adult Day Health Care (“ADHC”) Waiver \nUndisputed Fact  Evidence \n83. ADHC services are a planned, diverse daily program of  First Eley Decl. ¶22. \nindividual services and group activities structured to \nenhance the recipient’s physical functioning and to provide \nmental stimulation. \n84. ADHC services are provided at licensed facilities that are  First Eley Decl. ¶22. \noperational at least five hours per day on a regularly \nscheduled basis or as specified in the recipient’s plan of \ncare. \n85.

In addition to transportation, ADHC facilities must provide  First Eley Decl. ¶22. \nat a minimum: individualized training and assistance with \nactivities of daily living; counseling and education in the \nareas of health and nutrition; individualized exercise and \nrecreation programs; nursing services; medical care \nmanagement; and one hot meal and two snacks per day. \n91. There are currently 825 slots in the ADHC waiver, but the  Eley Tr. 41 (lines 16-18). \nState is able to serve a higher number of people over the \ncourse of the year because of turnover. \n92.

Recent DHH Initiatives Have Helped Individuals Leave Nursing Facilities and Have \nAllowed the State to Close Several Nursing Facilities Permanently. \nA.  Money Follows the Person \nUndisputed Fact  Evidence \n99. In 2007, Louisiana successfully applied for a federal grant  Eley Tr. 89 (lines 7-10). \nunder the Money Follows the Person (“MFP”) program. \n100.  Under the MFP program, States qualify for a higher  Eley Tr. 84 (lines 5-18). \npercentage of federal matching dollars to help cover the \ncosts of transitioning people out of nursing homes, and \nLouisiana also uses MFP grant money to engage in outreach \nto nursing facility residents and to hire staff who can \nidentify those residents who want to move into the \ncommunity. \n101.  The MFP program provides recipients with transition- Eley Tr. 91 (lines 1-6). \nrelated services including assistance in finding a residence, \npaying a rental deposit, and identifying an HCBS provider. \n102.  Once individuals transition to the community with MFP  Eley Tr. 89 (line 22) to 90 \nfunding, they can receive long term care through one or  (line 4). \nmore of the State’s several HCBS programs \n103.

Many individuals have transitioned out of nursing  Second Eley Decl. ¶26. \nfacilities without the assistance of the MFP grant. \n \nB.  Community Choice Waiver \nUndisputed Fact  Evidence \n105.  DHH recently received CMS’s approval for a new  First Eley Decl. ¶17; Eley Tr. \nwaiver (the “Community Choice” waiver) that DHH  38 (lines 15-19). \ndesigned to replace the EDA waiver. \n106.  The Community Choice waiver will be more  First Eley Decl. ¶17. \ncomprehensive than its predecessor and will include skilled \nnursing services, skilled therapy services, home-delivered \n- 14 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 39-1     03/30/11   Page 14 of 17\n\n \nmeals, assistive technology, and transportation \n107.  The Community Choice waiver will also allow enrollees  First Eley Decl. ¶17. \nto self-direct their services and, in many cases, purchase \nmore services within the same budget. \n108.  DHH expects the Community Choice waiver to be  First Eley Decl. ¶17; Eley Tr. \noperational by the middle of 2011.  All EDA enrollees will  75 (lines 3-10). \nbe transitioned to the Community Choice waiver. \n \nC.  Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly \nUndisputed Fact  Evidence \n109.  Louisiana currently has two facilities that operate as  First Eley Decl. ¶27. \nProgram of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (“PACE”) \ncenters: one in New Orleans and one in Baton Rouge. \n110.  The services provided at PACE centers include, among  La. Admin. Code tit. 50, \nothers: personal care and supportive services; restorative  § 303, 30 La. Reg. 244, 245-\ntherapies; nutritional counseling; recreational therapy;  46 (Feb. 2004). \nmeals; and primary care and medical specialty services. \n111.  PACE centers must provide recipients with  First Eley Decl. ¶27. \ntransportation to and from the center. \n112.  The PACE centers are authorized to serve up to 380  First Eley Decl. ¶27. \nindividuals (180 in Baton Rouge and 200 in New Orleans), \nbut they currently serve a total of approximately 230 \nindividuals and there is no wait list. \n113.  Neither PACE center was providing services prior to  Second Eley Decl. att. A. \nSFY 2008. \n \nD.  75 Newly Available Slots in the EDA Waiver \nUndisputed Fact  Evidence \n114.  Until recently, 150 of the slots in the EDA waiver were  Second Eley Decl. ¶25. \nset aside for individuals with Lou Gehrig’s disease, but only \nabout 75 of these slots were filled. \n115.

Part of Louisiana’s strategy for serving a greater  Eley Tr. 224 (lines 10-15). \npercentage of individuals with adult-onset disabilities in the \ncommunity involves reducing the supply of institutional \nservices. \n118.  Louisiana recently created a “Bed Buy-back Program”  Second Eley Decl. ¶28. \nintended to lead to the permanent closure of nursing \nfacilities and the elimination of nursing home beds from the \nmarket. \n119.  Since July 2008, the Bed Buy-back Program has led to  Second Eley Decl. ¶28. \nthe elimination of 461 nursing home beds and the permanent \nclosure of 4 nursing facilities. \n120.  Going forward, the State expects the Bed Buy-back  Second Eley Decl. ¶28. \nProgram to lead to the elimination of 2 nursing facilities per \nyear and an average of 115 to 144 beds per facility. \n121.  For each nursing facility closed under the Bed Buy-back  Second Eley Decl. ¶28. \nProgram, the State expects to incur new costs for five years \nbut then see savings of $378,706 per year thereafter. \n \nG.  Private Room Conversion \nUndisputed Fact  Evidence \n122.

Introduction \n \n  When reviewing a motion to dismiss, the court accepts all well-pleaded factual \nallegations as true, and construes the complaint liberally, with “all reasonable inferences \ndrawn in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.” Elsensohn v. St. Tammany Parish \nSheriff's Office, 530 F.3d 368, 371-72 (5th Cir. 2008); Woodward v. Andrus, 419 F.3d \n348, 351 (5th Cir. 2005). Motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) are disfavored and are \nrarely granted. Lormand v. US Unwired, Inc., 565 F.3d 228, 232 (5th Cir. 2009); Priester \nv. Lowndes County, 354 F.3d 414, 418 (5th Cir. 2004).  A claim will survive an attack \nunder Rule 12(b)(6) if it “may be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with \nthe allegations in the complaint.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 563 \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 1 of 24\n\n(2007). Applying this strict standard, Plaintiffs’ allegations demonstrate a valid claim for \nrelief and the motion to dismiss must not be granted. \n  The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) construes unnecessary \ninstitutionalization and segregation as prohibited forms of discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(3) and (5).  As such, the ADA \nrequires public entities to administer services to qualified individuals in “the most \nintegrated setting appropriate.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  It has been determined that the \nunjustified isolation of individuals in institutions, thus limiting their exposure to the \ncommunity, constitutes discrimination based on disability.  Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. \n581, 596-597 (1999). \n  Plaintiffs, as well as other class members, are individuals with severe disabilities \nwho are qualified to receive, and who currently receive, services under Louisiana’s \nMedicaid-funded Long-Term Personal Care Services (“LT-PCS”) program.  This \nprogram currently provides critical home-care services for a maximum of 42 hours per \nweek to people who are eligible for nursing home care, and who would be at risk of \nhaving to enter a nursing home for care, if they did not receive home services.  If the \nState cuts the maximum number of program hours to 32, as it has announced it plans to \ndo, then Plaintiffs will not have access to the care that is necessary for them to remain in \ntheir homes.  As such, Defendants’ actions place Plaintiffs at risk of unwarranted \ninstitutionalization and segregation in violation of the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)(“Section 504”). \n  Since Plaintiffs’ pleadings set forth viable claims, dismissal under F. R. Civ. Pro. \n12(b)6) is improper.  The Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 2 of 24\n\nDoc. No. 11-1 (“Defendants’ Memorandum”) presents, at pp. 4-14, a slew of factual \nassertions in an attempt to convince the Court that Defendants have an effectively \nworking plan to provide community services as an alterative to nursing home care.  As \nPlaintiffs will show, this Court may not consider these factual assertions in connection \nwith a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.   \nPlaintiffs will be able to show, on the merits, that Defendants’ plans in fact do not \neven address the issue of allowing persons with disabilities, like the Plaintiffs and the \nputative class, to avoid nursing home placement by promptly providing adequate \nMedicaid personal care services for them in their homes and communities.  Plaintiffs will \nbe able to show, among other things, that there are over 17,000 people on a waiting list \nfor the Elderly and Disabled Adults waiver (the “comprehensive” service that Defendants \ncontend is more appropriate for individuals like Plaintiffs with a “higher level of need” \n[Defendants’ Memorandum at p. 8]), and that the 2 ½-year wait for services under that \nprogram is the same now as it was in March of 2006.  Plaintiffs will further be able to \nshow that while they, and others with disabilities who want to receive services in their \nhomes, must wait years for adequate services, people who are willing to go into \nsegregated institutional facilities for services can receive them immediately, and that \nrecent budget cuts in long term care have primarily targeted home- and community-based \nservices rather than institutional services.  In sum, Plaintiffs will show that Defendants do \nnot have an affirmative defense to their claims.  However, these are matters to be \naddressed on the merits—not in connection with a motion to dismiss. \n \n \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 3 of 24\n\nII.  Plaintiffs’ Factual Allegations \nBefore the Court are four named Plaintiffs, Helen Pitts, 78, Kenneth Roman, 47, \nDenise Hodges, 53, and Rickii Ainey, 30, representing themselves and a proposed class \nof similarly situated individuals.  They all are disabled and are qualified individuals under \nboth the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of \n1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  1 \n  All the Plaintiffs have extremely severe impairments, with multiple chronic \nconditions such as paralyses, strokes, chronic heart failures, arthritis, and multiple \nsclerosis.  They all require assistance with multiple activities of daily living (sometimes \nabbreviated “ADL’s”), including, but not limited to, assistance with bathing, dressing, \ntoileting, eating, bowel and bladder care, meal preparation and clean up, shopping, and \nlaundry.  They all have been receiving such assistance for multiple activities of daily \nliving in their homes as part of Defendants’ LT-PCS Program.   \n   Defendants have proposed to change the maximum number of LT-PCS from 42 \nhours a week to 32.  The reduction in maximum hours in the LT-PCS program is being \nimposed for purely budgetary reasons, is not based on the needs of the persons who have \nbeen receiving LT-PCS services, and does not it take into account the Supreme Court’s \nadmonition in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S.581, 597 (1999) that “[u]njustified isolation … \nis properly regarded as discrimination based on disability.” With the proposed reduction \nof hours of LT-PCS, all of the Plaintiffs are at serious and imminent risk of requiring \ninstitutionalization and segregation in nursing homes, where they will receive the exact \nsame services that they presently receive in the community. None of the Plaintiffs want to \n                                                 \n1   The ADA and Section 504 are analyzed together since “there is no significant difference in the \nanalysis of rights and obligations created by the two.” Bennett-Nelson v. La. Bd. of Regents, 431 F.3d 448, \n454 (5th Cir. 2005); Zulke v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif., 166 F.3d 1041, 1045 n.11 (9th Cir. 1999). \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 4 of 24\n\nreside in an institution. They have active lives in the community and want to continue to \nreside in their own homes and apartments. \n  What distinguishes the named Plaintiffs and putative class from most other people \nwith disabilities is the severity of their disabilities and the concomitant assistance with \nactivities of daily living they require.  It is critical to understand that many, if not most \n,people with disabilities, could adequately reside in the community with a maximum of \n32 hours a week of LT-PCS.  It is only the minority of people with disabilities who have \nthe severest disabilities, who require more than 32 hours – to wit, the named Plaintiffs \nand the proposed class.  2 \n  Defendants have in the past administered the LT-PCS to require “prior \nauthorization” of the number of LT-PCS hours Plaintiffs have received.  That is, \nDefendants have determined that the named Plaintiffs require more than 32 hours of LT-\nPCS services, up to 42 hours a week. The number of hours each Plaintiff has been \nreceiving has been determined by Defendants to be required both to reside safely in the \ncommunity and to avoid institutionalization.  Plaintiffs need for assistance with their \nADLs has not changed or diminished.  Plaintiffs have not been receiving unnecessary \nhours of service, but have been receiving the bare minimum number of hours up to 42 a \nweek each requires.   For example, at the present time, Plaintiff Helen Pitts has been \napproved to receive 39 hours a week of LT-PCS, Kenneth Roman 39 hours a week, \nDenise Hodges 39 hours a week and Rickii Ainey 41 hours of LT-PCS a week. \n  The pleaded facts are: \n•  Plaintiff Helen Pitts is 78 years old. She is divorced and lives alone.   Ms. Pitts \nhas had osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and congestive heart \n                                                 \n2   According to Defendants’ memorandum at pg. 9, 28% of the people on the LT-PCS currently \nreceive between 32 and 42 hours of service per week.   \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 5 of 24\n\nfailure and lymphedema.  She requires the use of oxygen daily and at night.  \nShe is in constant pain in her legs, arms, shoulders and back. Plaintiff Pitts \nneeds assistance getting in and out of bed and getting in and out of her \nmotorized scooter.  She needs help going to the bathroom because she cannot \nget on and off the toilet without help, needs help pulling her clothes up and \ndown, and needs help cleaning herself (in part to avoid decubitus ulcers).  She \nhas  incontinent  episodes  daily.  She  needs  help  bathing,  dressing  and \nperforming most of her personal hygiene.  Ms. Pitts is unable to prepare \nmeals, do her laundry or attend to household chores. \n \n•  Plaintiff Kenneth Roman is 47 years old.  Plaintiff Roman has had several \nstrokes  which  has  caused  left  side  hemiparesis.  He  also  has  diabetes, \ncongestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, coronary \nartery disease, renal failure and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as several \nheart attacks, the most recent of which was in 2009. Mr. Roman is currently \nseparated from his wife.  One of the primary reasons they are separated is \nbecause his wife did not want to be his caregiver any longer.  Due to his \nimpairments, Plaintiff Roman needs assistance with all of his activities of \ndaily  living.    He  is  incontinent  and  needs  assistance  cleaning  after  an \nincontinence episode.  This is even more important when his irritable bowel \nsyndrome occurs.  He is often incontinent of bowel and bladder at night and \noften must wait until his personal care worker arrives in the morning to assist \nwith  cleaning.    Plaintiff  Roman  needs  assistance  changing  to  a  standing \nposition from a sitting position.  He needs help bathing, washing his face and \nbrushing his teeth.  Often he is not able to move in bed when he has no \nassistance.  Not moving during the night causes him severe pain.  As a result \nof the pain, he often falls in the morning when he tries to walk. \n \n•  Plaintiff Denise Hodges is 53 years old. She was diagnosed with transverse \nmyelitis in 1989 that left her paralyzed from the waist down, and in 2001, was \ndiagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  Due to her multiple sclerosis, Ms. Hodges \nhas frequent extreme fatigue and loss of stabilitiy and requires extensive \nassistance transferring, dressing, toileting and bathing.  She cannot push her \nmanual  wheelchair  and  needs  assistance  with  personal  hygiene,  meal \npreparation,  shopping,  laundry  and  household  chores.  Plaintiff  Hodges \nrequires digital stimulation in order to have a bowel movement and needs help \nwith cleaning herself and any laundry that must be done as a result of bowel \nmovements.  Ms. Hodges developed decubitis ulcers on one of her heels and \non her lower spine during a period of time when she was not receiving \nadequate assistance. \n \n•  Plaintiff  Rickii  Ainey  is  30  years  old  and  lives  alone.  Ms.  Ainey  has \narthrogryposis (a congenital form of arthritis), is paralyzed from the waist up \nand has limited mobility in her legs. She has limited range of motion in her \nlegs and the range of motion is deteriorating.  Ms. Ainey needs assistance with \nall activities of daily living, including but not limited to bathing her upper \n  6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 6 of 24\n\nbody, including her face, arms and torso, and washing her hair; dressing in the \nmorning and undressing when she goes to bed; adjusting her clothing before \nand after toileting; getting on and off the toilet and cleaning herself after \ntoileting; feminine hygiene; eating and drinking; transferring from any surface \nto  a  standing  position;  and moving  once  in  bed.   Plaintiff  Ainey  cannot \nprepare meals and cannot shop without assistance. In addition, she requires \nassistance to do all household chores and laundry. \n \n  None of the Plaintiffs have family or friends who can provide the Medicaid \nservices they receive from LT-PCS.  They all fervently want not to have to go into a \nnursing home or institution to receive the same assistance with activities of daily living \nthat they currently receive.   \nIII.  Argument \nA.  Defendants Inappropriately Reference Materials Outside the Complaint in \nthe Motion to Dismiss. \n \n  In deciding a rule 12(b)(6) motion, a district court may not go outside the \ncomplaint, except in one “limited exception.”  Scanlan v. Tex. A&M Univ., 343 F.3d 533, \n536 (5th Cir. 2003).  This exception allows the movant to attach to its motion, and the \ncourt to consider, documents that are “referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and are \ncentral to the plaintiff's claim.” Boyd v. Driver, 579 F.3d 513, 515 n. 4 (5th Cir. 2009); \nScanlan at 536. Further, a court may take judicial notice of facts of public record in \ndeciding a rule 12(b)(6) motion only when the facts are not subject to reasonable dispute \nin that they are either generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court, \nor are capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy \ncannot be reasonably questioned.  FED. R. EVID. 201(b).   \nThe declaration and documents that are repeatedly referenced in Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss do not fall within the exception, are not subject to judicial notice, and \ncannot be relied upon in deciding this motion.  The declaration and documents are not \n  7 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 7 of 24\n\nmentioned or referenced at all in the complaint, an important factor in cases interpreting \nthe exception.  See Collins v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 224 F.3d 496, 498-99 (5th \nCir. 2000) (explaining that the exception in this and other jurisdictions requires that the \nplaintiff’s complaint have referred to the documents attached to the Defendant’s motion \nto dismiss and that the documents be central to the plaintiff’s claim), Scanlan, 343 F.3d at \n537 (finding that the defendant’s document not being referenced in the complaint was an \nimportant distinction from cases where the exception was applied).  Moreover, it would \nhave been impossible for Plaintiffs to reference the declaration, as it was a document \ncreated by Defendants specifically for this case, a fact which precludes it from being \nsubject to judicial notice.  See Scanlan, 343 F.3d at 537 (holding that a document created \nby the movant for its own use cannot be characterized as “generally known” or “capable \nof accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot \nreasonably be questioned”).  Finally, the declaration and documents are not central to \nPlaintiffs’ claim, but are  in fact more relevant to the Defendants’ defenses, a \ndistinguishing factor specifically referenced by the Scanlan court.  Id. (“certainly [it] \nalone is not central to their claims. Indeed, it is much more central to [defendant’s] \ndefenses.  Consequently, the district court’s first error was going outside the plaintiffs’ \ncomplaints.”). 3  \n  While the declaration and documents may be relevant at a hearing on the merits, \nthey are not relevant or appropriate in a motion to dismiss.  At the hearing on the merits, \nPlaintiffs will have the opportunity to cross-examine Defendants’ witnesses and to \nintroduce evidence to show inaccuracies in and irrelevance of Defendants’ documents.  \n                                                 \n3   These documents are also hearsay and /or contain hearsay statements, which have not been shown \nto be within any hearsay exception.  They are therefore objectionable under Rule 802, Fed.R.Evid.   \n \n  8 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 8 of 24\n\nThese documents are not appropriate for consideration at this time.   \n \nB.  Plaintiffs’  Pleadings  Allege  Discrimination  in  Violation  of  the  ADA  and \nSection 504 \n \n  The Supreme Court in Olmstead and lower courts have held that the ADA \nprohibits unnecessary segregation in institutions and requires states to provide services to \nindividuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, \nunless the state can prove that doing so would result in an undue burden or in a \nfundamental alteration to their programs.   \n  Defendants fund the provision of personal care services to individuals with \ndisabilities both in nursing homes and in the community. It is important to point out that \nPlaintiffs’ claims that Defendants’ actions violate the ADA and Section 504 are not per \nse because Defendants have reduced the maximum LT-PCS benefit from 42 to 32 hours a \nweek.  That reduction implicates ADA and Section 504 prohibited discrimination only \nwhen it puts people with disabilities at risk of being institutionalized.  That is, if the \nreduction of hours does not cause such risk, then at least for purposes of the instant action \nit may not run afoul of the ADA and Section 504  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ claims are very \nlimited:  if the reduction of  LT-PCS hours causes the risk of unnecessary \ninstitutionalization, then the ADA and Section 504 are violated.   \nMoreover, it is also important to point out that presently Defendants’ Medicaid \npays for Plaintiffs’ LT-PCS in the community.  When Plaintiffs are institutionalized,  \nDefendants’ Medicaid will pay for their nursing home care.  To the extent these \nexpenditures equal or exceed the expenditures on LT-PCS, there will be no cost savings \n  9 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 9 of 24\n\nfor Defendants but there will be unnecessary institutionalization and segregation for \nPlaintiffs – precisely what Congress prohibited and wanted to end.  See infra. \ni.  Background of the ADA \n  In enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990, Congress made \nexplicit findings that plainly delineated its concern that people with disabilities had been \nlong isolated from society and its goal to promote integration of those individuals.  \nSpecifically, Congress found:  that discrimination against individuals with disabilities \npersists in “such critical areas as institutionalization [and] health services”; that people \nwith disabilities “continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including ... \nsegregation”; that “the Nation’s proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to \nensure equal opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-\nsufficiency”; and that the continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary discrimination \n... costs the United States billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from \ndependency and nonproductivity.”  42 U.S.C. §§ 12101(a)(3), (5), (7), and (8).  These \nfindings reflect Congress’s understanding that “[i]ntegration is fundamental to the \npurposes of the ADA.”  H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 56 (1990), reprinted in 1990 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 479; see also S. Rep. No. 101-116 at 20 (1989) (there is a \n“compelling need to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate .. for the \nintegration of persons with disabilities into the economic and social mainstream of \nAmerican life.”). \n \n \n \n  10 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 10 of 24\n\nii.  Title II of the ADA, as the Supreme Court Has Held, \nBars Unnecessary Institutionalization and Segregation of People with \nDisabilities. \n \n  Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities by \npublic entities, such as Defendants.  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Rather than delineate the \nspecific forms of prohibited discrimination barred by Title II, Congress directed the \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) to promulgate regulations to implement Title II and, in \ndoing so, to adhere to specific regulations promulgated under Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12134(a)-(b).  Adhering to the congressional mandate, \nDOJ adopted regulations to implement Title II including the following integration \nmandate that requires public entities to: \nadminister services, programs, and activities in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \nindividuals with disabilities. \n \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). 4 \n  The integration mandate was analyzed and interpreted by the United States \nSupreme Court in the landmark Olmstead decision. The Olmstead plaintiffs were \nindividuals with mental disabilities who were confined in Georgia’s state psychiatric \ninstitutions, but who wanted to live in the community. Plaintiffs asserted that the state’s \nrefusal to pay for them to live in community settings violated the integration mandate of \n                                                 \n4 The ADA’s integration mandate is virtually identical to 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d) promulgated by DOJ \npursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which accords with Congress’s direction that the Title II \nADA regulations must be consistent with the coordination regulations.  42 U.S.C. § 12134(b); see also \nHelen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 332 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 813 (1995).  Plaintiffs asserted \nclaims under the integration mandates of both the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Since courts have held that \nthese provisions have the same scope and effect, see, e.g., Radaszewski ex rel. Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 \nF.3d 601, 607 (7th Cir. 2004); Grooms v. Maram, 563 F. Supp. 2d 840, 851 (N.D. Ill. 2008), Plaintiffs’ \n \ndiscussion focuses on the ADA but applies as well to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n \n  11 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 11 of 24\n\nTitle II of the ADA and its implementing regulations. The Court was thus presented with \nthe question of whether the proscription of disability discrimination may require the \nplacement of individuals with disabilities in community settings rather than institutions. \nOlmstead, Id. at 587. \n  The Court faced the question of whether a state has an obligation under the \nADA’s integration mandate, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), to provide community services to \npeople with disabilities who were unnecessarily institutionalized.  Explaining that \n“unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form of \ndiscrimination,” id. at 600, the Court wrote: \n[C]onfinement  in  an  institution  severely  diminishes  the \neveryday  life  activities  of  individuals,  including  family \nrelations,  social  contacts,  work  options,  economic \nindependence,  educational  advancement  and  cultural \nenrichment.  [citation omitted]  Dissimilar treatment exists \nin this key respect:  In order to receive needed medical \nservices, persons with ... disabilities must, because of those \ndisabilities, relinquish participation in community life they \ncould  enjoy  given  reasonable  accommodations,  while \npersons  without  ...  disabilities  can  receive  the  medical \nservices they need without similar sacrifice. \n \nId. at 600-01. 5 \nThe facts of the case at bar clearly demonstrate that Plaintiffs will suffer \ndiscrimination. There can be no doubt that for Plaintiffs, the “most integrated settings \nappropriate” are their own homes. By living at home and participating in their \ncommunities, they have been able to experience and benefit from church activities, social \n                                                 \n5 Following Olmstead, a number of federal appellate courts have applied the ADA’s integration mandate in \ncases  involving  individuals  with  disabilities  who  are  unnecessarily  institutionalized  or  at  risk  of \nunnecessary institutionalization.  See, e.g., Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 602 (7th Cir. 2004); Fisher v. Okla. \nHealth Care Auth., 335 F.3d 1175, 1180-81 (10th Cir. 2003) (individuals at risk of institutionalization in \nnursing facilities); Townsend v. Qasim, 328 F.3d 511, 523 (9th Cir. 2003); Pennsylvania Protection and \nAdvocacy, Inc. v. Pa. Dep’t of Public Welfare, 402 F.3d 374, 379 (3d Cir. 2005). \n \n  12 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 12 of 24\n\ncontacts, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment of which the Supreme Court \nspoke.  Forcing them to move to nursing homes solely to receive the personal attendant \ncare services that they need for their activities of daily living is exactly the sort of \ndiscrimination recognized in Olmstead.   \n  DOJ’s ADA integration regulation is consistent with Congress’s findings and \ngoals in enacting the ADA.  Congress’s clear goal in enacting in the ADA -- as evidenced \nby its extensive findings -- was to end unnecessary segregation and institutionalization of \npeople  with  disabilities  and,  concomitantly,  to  promote  their  full  integration  and \nparticipation in society. Plaintiffs have clearly stated a claim for relief under the ADA \nand Section 504. \n  Defendants claim that Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to establish a \nviolation of the ADA's integration mandate because Louisiana has a plan \"oriented to \nprevent the isolation and segregation of individuals in institutions\" (Defendants' \nMemorandum at 18).  They argue that the fact that their expenditures on home- and \ncommunity based services have grown dramatically in the past decade,6  and that they \nhave published documents designated as “plans” dealing with long-term care, \nconclusively establish that Louisiana has “a  comprehensive, effectively working plan to \nserve individuals with disabilities in their homes and communities…” (Defendants’ \nMemorandum, p. 2).  The defense they seek to establish, however, involves more than the \nexistence of a “plan”—it requires that the plan be “effectively working” to place qualified \npeople in less restrictive settings, and that waiting lists “move at a reasonable pace” to \n                                                 \n6 Defendants' offerings of home- and community based services as an alternative to nursing facility services \nessentially began a decade ago as a result of another ADA class action lawsuit, Barthelemy v. Louisiana \nDepartment of Health and Hospitals, C.A. No. 00-1083 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Louisiana, see 2001 WL 1254859 (approval of settlement agreement); 2003 WL 1733534 (modifying \nsettlement agreement).  The cutback at issue in this case represents a significant retreat from the services \ninstituted as a result of that lawsuit. \n  13 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 13 of 24\n\nensure that persons leave institutions.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 605-606.  Defendants’ \nreduction in community-based services will have the opposite effect – it will increase \nunnecessary institutionalization.  Neither Congress nor the Supreme Court intended more \nunnecessary institutionalization and segregation but intended less.  \n  Plaintiffs are aware of no reported case in which a State has been held to have \nestablished this defense at the pleadings stage.  The “plans” to which Defendants allude \nare clearly outside the pleadings and are not relied on or referred to in any way in \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint.  If the Court were to review them, however, it would find that they \ndo not even address the issue of allowing persons with disabilities like the Plaintiffs and \nthe putative class to avoid nursing home placement by promptly providing adequate \nMedicaid personal care services for them in their homes and communities.  They contain \nno plans to address the problem of the lengthy, and growing, waits for community-based \nservices, and certainly do not include the current cutbacks, which will only exacerbate \nthose waits.  \n  Currently, Plaintiffs are able to receive up to 42 hours of personal care services in \ntheir homes.  The cutback that is the subject of this action will result in their inability to \nreceive adequate services in their homes and will force them (and others similarly \nsituated) into institutions.  While Defendants claim that one of the named Plaintiffs will \nsoon be offered the “more comprehensive” services that will keep her from having to \nenter a nursing home (Defendants’ Memorandum, p. 6), it admits that the current wait for \nservices under that program is 2 ½ years, and does not suggest when the other named \nPlaintiffs, or members of the putative class, will be able to obtain these services. 7 \n                                                 \n7 Defendants state that approximately 28% of the 12,000 people receiving LT-PCS are currently receiving \nmore than 32 hours (Defendants’ Memorandum p. 9), and that there are 4,603 EDA waiver slots (Id. at 5). \nSince Defendants admit that the wait for an EDA slot is over 2 ½ years (Id. at 6), it is logical to infer that \nmost, if not all, of the 4,603 slots are currently occupied. While one of the named Plaintiffs may soon be \nreached on the waiting list, slots will not be available for many other named Plaintiffs and class members \nwho are put at risk of institutionalization as a result of these cutbacks. \n  14 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 14 of 24\n\nDefendants do not state that they plan to add EDA slots to prevent the unnecessary \ninstitutionalization of Plaintiffs and the members of the putative class. \n  In a very similar recent case, the court in Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, 656 \nF.Supp.2d 1161 (N.D.Cal. 2009)(on appeal) entered a preliminary injunction against a \ncutback in the amount of Adult Day Health Care services that seniors and adults with \ndisabilities were able to receive.  It found that these cutbacks threatened the plaintiffs and \nthe putative class with a serious risk of institutionalization, and that “..[T]o the extent that \nDefendants are claiming that alternative services satisfy their obligations under the \nintegration mandate, Defendants certainly bear the burden of ensuring more than a \n“theoretical” availability of such services.” Id. at 1174. See also V.L. v. Wagner, 669 F. \nSupp. 1106, 1120 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (enjoining change in eligibility standards that would \nreduce or terminate in-home personal care services, creating a risk of institutionalization \nfor people with disabilities, where the record demonstrated that alternative services would \nnot be available for a large portion of class members who face a risk of \ninstitutionalization). \n  Here, Defendants do not even suggest that alternative services will actually be \navailable to replace the services that Plaintiffs (other than possibly Ms. Hodges) and the \nother class members will lose in the cutback.  The “plans” that Defendants tout certainly \ndo not provide for this.  The facts that Defendants offer some other long-term care \nservices, and that it has documents entitled “plans” for long-term care, do not negate \nPlaintiffs’ claims. \n \n \n  15 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 15 of 24\n\nC.    Defendants Have Not Established a Fundamental Alteration Defense   \n \n  Given that the Plaintiffs have alleged that the community -- not a nursing home – \nis the most integrated setting in which to provide them with personal care services, and \nthat a reasonable accommodation (i.e., the provision of up to 42 hours a week of personal \ncare services in the community) is feasible, they have satisfied their burden of pleading \nthat Defendants violated the ADA’s integration mandate.  See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 602-\n03, 607; Frederick L., 364 F.3d at 492 n.4.  To avoid liability under the integration \nmandate, the burden at trial will shift to the Defendants to establish that the requested \naccommodation of up to 42 hours a week of personal care services would constitute an \nundue burden or fundamental alteration of its programs.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 602-03, \n607; Frederick L., 364 F.3d at 492 n.4; Townsend, 328 F.3d at 520.  Defendants cannot \nmeet that burden. 8 \nFirst, Defendants have not shown that it will in fact cost the State of Louisiana \nmore to provide the named and class Plaintiffs with personal care services in their own \nhomes than it would cost to fund their care in nursing homes. The State will have to pay \nfor nursing home care for each person who requires such care as a result of the reduced \nhours in the community. At the current hourly LT-PCS rate of $12.28, it may cost the \n                                                 \n8 “Fundamental alteration” is essentially the flip side of a “reasonable accommodation.”  If something is a \nreasonable accommodation, it cannot be a fundamental alteration and vice versa.  Courts have applied these \nconcepts in ADA cases that did not involve the integration mandate, stressing the breadth of the ADA’s \nrequirement  for  reasonable  accommodation  and,  concomitantly,  the  narrowness  of  the  fundamental \nalteration defense.  See, e.g., American Council of the Blind v. Paulson, 525 F.3d 1256,1268-69 (D.C. Cir. \n2008) (holding it is not a fundamental alteration to require the Treasury Department to use currency that is \naccessible to blind persons); US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 397 (2002) (in ADA employment \ncase,  court  noted  that  reasonable  accommodation  sometimes  requires  “preferences”  to  people  with \ndisabilities to achieve equal opportunity); PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 688 (2001) (in holding \nthat allowing a player to ride in a golf cart during a tournament was not a fundamental alteration, the court \nrefused to the defer to the “expertise” of the PGA and stressed that the PGA’s refusal “to consider Martin’s \npersonal circumstances in deciding whether to accommodate his disability runs counter  to the  clear \nlanguage and purpose of the ADA.”) \n \n  16 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 16 of 24\n\nMedicaid program $24,903 per year to provide home services to a person who, like Helen \nPitts, receives 39 hours a week of care in her home.  A recent DHH report showed that \nthe average cost of care to people receiving services in Medicaid-funded nursing homes \nis $33,915. Thus, a cutback in Ms. Pitts’ services from 39 to 32 hours a week would \nactually cost the State over $9,000 if she is forced into an institution as a result.  If only \n147 of the class members enter a nursing facility as a result of these cuts, the $5 million \nin savings the State projects from these cutbacks will evaporate. \n  Second, courts in other ADA integration cases have afforded relief to allow \nindividuals with disabilities to receive community services even when the state might \nincur greater costs for such services than it would absent the relief.  For example, the \nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected Oklahoma’s argument that its limitation \non a prescription drugs for people receiving services through a Medicaid HCBS waiver in \nthe community (while providing unlimited prescriptions to nursing home residents) was \nnecessary because of the state’s fiscal crisis.  Oklahoma’s desire to save funds, even if \nreasonable, “does not constitute a defense” to the ADA’s integration mandate.  Fisher, \n335 F.3d at 1182. \n[T]he fact that Oklahoma has a fiscal problem, by itself, \ndoes not lead to an automatic conclusion that preservation \nof unlimited medically-necessary prescription benefits ... \nwill result in a fundamental alteration ....  If every alteration \nin a program or service that required the outlay of funds \nwere tantamount to a fundamental alteration, the ADA’s \nintegration mandate would be hollow indeed. \n \nId. at 1182-83 (emphasis added); accord Pennsylvania Protection and Advocacy, Inc., \n402 F.3d at 381; Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 613-15; Crabtree, 2008 WL 5330506 at *26; \n  17 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 17 of 24\n\nMessier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 345; Cota v. Maxwell-Jolly, 688 F.Supp. 2d 980, 995 (N.D. \nCal. 2010). \n  In fact, courts have held that the ADA’s integration mandate requires states to \nprovide far more costly in-home services than those afforded to Plaintiffs in the instant \ncase.  In Radaszewski, 2008 WL 2097382 at *6, *14-*15, the court granted judgment in \nan ADA integration mandate case to an individual who needed in-home care at a cost of \nnearly $21,000 per month.  In Crabtree, 2008 WL 5330506 at *2-*12, *31, the court \ngranted a preliminary injunction to require the state to continue to provide up to 24 hours \nper day of skilled care to individuals who faced institutionalization in nursing homes \nabsent such care.  See also Grooms, 563 F. Supp. 2d at 847, 859-63 (granting judgment to \nprovide in-home care at cost of more than $16,000 per month to person with disability to \navoid institutionalization). \n  Third, this is not a case in which Defendants would have to create “new” services \nfor Plaintiffs.  Defendants currently provide personal care services both in nursing homes \nand in the community.  As such, the provision of in-home personal care services would \nnot fundamentally alter Defendants’ program by forcing them to develop a new service \nfor the Plaintiffs.  See Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1183 (noting that the plaintiffs were simply \nrequesting a service that the state provided in a nursing home (unlimited prescriptions) to \nbe provided in the community and, thus, “are not demanding a separate service or one not \nalready offered by the state”); Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 611 (holding that it is not a \nfundamental alteration to require states to simply adapt the location of where services are \nprovided from institutions to the community). \n  Fourth, beginning with Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, \n  18 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 18 of 24\n\n410 (1979), the courts have recognized that Section 504 requires publicly-funded \nprograms to provide reasonable modifications and accommodations when needed to \nassure that people with disabilities have meaningful access to its programs and services. \nSee Alexander, 469 U.S. at 300-01 & n.20-21. Title II of the ADA requires: \nA public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, \nor  procedures  when  the  modifications  are  necessary  to  avoid \ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of  disability,  unless  the  public  entity  can \ndemonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the \nnature of the service, program or activity. \n \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) (authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 12134(b)). \n  Plaintiffs agree that they have the burden to propose a reasonable accommodation, \nsee Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss at 21.  The reasonable \naccommodation proposed is to continue to assess each person with a disability \nindividually and to authorize only the number of hours, up to 42 per week, that the person \nrequires to avoid institutionalization. \n  Defendants’ only response is that it will cost $5 million annually to provide more \nthan 32 hours and less than 42 hours a week of LT-PCS. See Memorandum in Support of \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss at 21.  What Defendants fail to inform the Court is that \ntheir Medicaid nursing home budget in FY 2010 was $744 million dollars – nearly twice \nthe amount expended on all their community-based programs for people with disabilities. \nFurther, as noted above, they do not present to the Court the additional nursing home \ncosts that will be incurred by reducing LT-PCS to a maximum of 32 hours.   \n  The concept of reasonable accommodation or reasonable modification recognizes \nthat strictly “equal” treatment of people with disabilities will not assure meaningful \naccess to services. See Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 273-75 (2d Cir. 2003). \n  19 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 19 of 24\n\nAccordingly, the ADA and Section 504 require accommodations assuring that otherwise \nneutral policies (e.g., limiting the number of hours to 32) and practices do not, in practice, \ndiscriminate against people with disabilities by denying them meaningful access to the \ncovered entity’s programs and services. Id., see also US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 \nU.S. 391, 397 (2002) (in ADA employment discrimination case, “preferences will \nsometimes prove necessary to achieve the Act's basic equal opportunity goal”). \n  In addition to violating “the most integrated setting” mandate,  Defendants also \nviolate Section 504 and the ADA’s prohibition against discriminating on the basis of the \nseverity of a person’s disability. In Jackson v. Fort Stanton Hosp. & Training School, 757 \nF. Supp. 1243 (D.N.M. 1990), rev’d on other grounds, 964 F.2d 980 (10th Cir. 1992), \nplaintiffs with developmental disabilities challenged their exclusion from the state’s \ncommunity services program because of the severity of their disabilities. In that case, \npeople with severe disabilities were precluded from living in community settings because \nthe programs lacked amenities that could be reasonably furnished that were necessary to \naccommodate their serious needs. The Court found that “Defendants’ failure to \naccommodate the severely handicapped in existing community programs while serving \nless severely handicapped peers is unreasonable and discriminatory.” Id. at 1299.  It \nconcluded that: \nmodifications of the existing community service system in New Mexico \nwould  not  require  an  excessive  financial  burden  and  that  the \naccommodations  would  enable  severely  handicapped  residents  of \n[residential  facilities]  to  realize  the  benefits  of  community  settings. \nAccordingly, the defendants should require those community programs \nthat receive federal assistance funds to make reasonable accommodations \nfor those severely handicapped residents [of facilities] whose IDTs have \ndetermined that a community program could be appropriate, if reasonably \nmodified. \n \n  20 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 20 of 24\n\nId. at 1299. See also Wagner v. Fair Acres Geriatric Center, 49 F. 3d 1002, 1016 n. 15 \n(3d Cir. 1995) (reversing the dismissal of a Rehabilitation Act claim by a woman who \nhad been turned down for admission to a nursing home based on the severity of her \ndisability); Cable v. Department of Developmental Services, 973 F. Supp. 937, 942 (C. D. \nCal. 1997) (State’s choice of certain patients for community placement because they were \nmore disabled than others may constitute discrimination under the ADA); Williams v. \nWasserman, 937 F. Supp. 524, 530 (D. Md. 1996) (“while the ADA does not place an \naffirmative obligation on the state to create or fundamentally alter a program of \ncommunity-based treatment options, the ADA does oblige the defendants to make those \noptions available to otherwise qualified individuals without regard to the severity ... of \ntheir disabilities”).  \n  Accordingly, courts have held that it is not a fundamental alteration under the \nADA’s integration mandate to require states to modify their Medicaid HCBS waivers to \nprovide services to individuals with severe disabilities in the community. In Grooms, the \ncourt rejected a fundamental alteration defense in a case filed by an individual with \ncomplex disabilities to secure extensive in-home services and avoid institutionalization.  \nGrooms, 563 F. Supp. 2d at 856-63. \n  Since Defendants have chosen to provide personal care services -- both in nursing \nhomes and in the community via the LT-PCS and the Waiver programs -- they cannot \nevade their obligations under the ADA’s integration mandate to provide those services to \nPlaintiffs in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  The state’s Medicaid \nprogram is not exempt from compliance with the ADA any more than it is exempt from \nother civil rights laws.  \n  21 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 21 of 24\n\nD.  Plaintiffs’ Due Process and Medicaid Claims May be Premature. \n \nDefendants acknowledge that “individual notices have not been issued,” but that \nwhen they are, sometime in the future, “each recipient whose hours will be reduced as a \nresult of the reassessment will receive an individual notice stating the basis of the State’s \naction.”   Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss at 23.  Plaintiffs \nbase their Complaint on draft notices that Defendants have provided, but agree that until \nthe notices are actually issued, this claim may be premature.   \nE.  None of Plaintiffs’ Claims are Barred by the Eleventh Amendment \nIt is settled law in the Fifth Circuit that a state department waives its Eleventh \nAmendment immunity from suit in federal court under §504 of the Rehabilitation Act of \n1973 when it accepts federal funds,  which are granted by Congress under authority of the \nConstitution's Spending Clause, and are expressly conditioned on waiver of immunity \nfrom §504. Miller v. Texas Tech Univ. Health Sciences Ctr., 421 F.3d 342, 345 (5th Cir. \n2005) (en banc), and Pace v. Bogalusa City Sch. Bd., 403 F.3d 272 (5th Cir.2005) (en \nbanc). \nDefendants’ citation to In Re Soileau, 488 F. 3d, 302, 305 (5th Cir. 2007) for the \nproposition that Louisiana enjoys 11th Amendment immunity from suit is misplaced. That \ncase  concerned  a  bankruptcy  action  and  whether  the  Bankruptcy  clause  of  the \nConstitution validly abrogates states’ immunity. This case, which involves claims under \nthe Rehabilitation Act, is controlled by Miller and Pace.    \nTo the extent that Plaintiffs’ Complaint asserts claims against the Louisiana \nDepartment of Health and Hospitals under the ADA, these claims are not necessary for \nthe relief Plaintiffs seek. It is well settled that Title II of the Americans with Disabilities \n  22 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 17     11/10/10   Page 22 of 24\n\nAct can be enforced through suits for prospective relief against state officers pursuant to \nthe Ex parte Young doctrine. McCarthy ex rel. Travis v. Hawkins, 381 F.3d 407, 413 (5th \nCir. 2004) (affirming denial of motion to dismiss in ADA action against state officers \nalleging that they failed to adequately provide community-based living options to \nindividuals with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities); Bd. of Trustees. \nof the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 374 n. 9 (2001).  Plaintiffs’ ADA Title II \nclaims for prospective injunctive and declaratory relief are appropriate against Bruce \nGreenstein, Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, in his official \ncapacity.   \nIV. Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs request that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nbe denied, except as to Plaintiffs’ Due Process claims.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to re-\nfile these claims if warranted after individualized notices have been issued.   \nDate:  November 11, 2010. \n            Respectfully submitted,  \n            /s/ Nell Hahn         \n            Nell Hahn, T.A. \n            LA Bar No. 22406 \n            Advocacy Center \n            600 Jefferson St., Suite 812 \n            Lafayette, LA 70501 \n            (337) 237-7380, ext. 11 \n            Facsimile (337) 237-0486 \n            nhahn@advocacyla.org \n \n             \n            Stephen F.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), which this Court converted to a motion for summary \njudgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). Because there are material facts in dispute and \nbecause Defendants’ motion is not correct on the law, the motion should be denied.1 \nINTRODUCTION \nIn 1990, Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), requiring all \npublic entities to refrain from discrimination, see 42 U.S.C. §12132. Congress’s findings \nexplicitly identified unjustified \"segregation\" of persons with disabilities as a \"for[m] of \ndiscrimination.\"   See §12101(a)(2);2  §12101(a)(3) (discrimination … persists in such critical \nareas as ... institutionalization...”); and §12101(a)(5) (\"discrimination, include[s] ... segregation\"). \nTen years after the ADA was enacted, Louisiana had one of the most segregated systems \nof long-term care in the country.  Ninety-seven percent of individuals with disabilities received \nlong term care3 under Medicaid only if they were confined in nursing homes.4  Only \n                                                 \n1  Pursuant to Local Rule 56.2, Plaintiffs also submit a separate Statement of Disputed Facts, which is \nattached hereto. \n2  Congress found that \"historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, \nand, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities \ncontinue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\" \n3 “Long term care,” as used in this memorandum, means programs that assist the elderly and adults with \ndisabilities with activities of daily living (“ADL’s”), such as eating, moving around, bathing, dressing, \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 1 of 41\n\napproximately 1,000 elderly individuals and persons with disabilities in 2000, out of a total of \nover 35,000 persons who received long term care services, received Medicaid-funded services in \nan integrated setting – their homes and communities.5 \nSince 2000, primarily as the result of Barthelemy, et al.v. Louisiana Department of \nHealth and Hospitals, et. al.,6 a class action brought in 2000 against the State, based on the ADA \nand Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 596-597 (1999), Louisiana has made progress in providing \nhome- and community-based services.  In Olmstead, the Supreme Court recognized that \nunjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination that \nviolates the ADA.  The Barthelemy action was dismissed without prejudice in January 2010.   \nDespite the Barthelemy Settlement Agreement, and the Olmstead decision, Louisiana has \nmaintained, and even increased, its Medicaid expenditures on segregated nursing home services, \neven though demand for nursing homes is dwindling.  The present action focuses on Louisiana’s \nimposition of heavy and disproportionate service reductions in Medicaid home and community-\nbased services.  Specifically, Defendants propose to reduce their Long Term – Personal Care \nServices (“LT-PCS”) from 42 hours a week to a maximum of 32 hours a week, with no \nexceptions to prevent the unnecessary institutionalization of LT-PCS recipients in nursing homes, \nand no plan to assure them access to alternative community services instead of \ninstitutionalization.  \nThese reductions fall disparately and most heavily on the most vulnerable group of \npeople with disabilities -- those who have the most severe disabilities and the most critical service \n                                                                                                                                                \ngrooming, toileting, transferring, cooking, shopping, housekeeping, and medication administration, because \nof disabilities. Long term care can be provided in a nursing home, at home, or in another community \nlocation.  While other populations in Louisiana, notably persons whose disabilities have onset before age \n22 and are considered to have developmental disabilities, receive long term care services, this case \nconcerns services only to the population of persons who have adult-onset disabilities or disabilities related \nto aging.   \n4 Defendants’ Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, Doc.

Several of these individuals \nhave brought this action claiming that these drastic reductions, as applied to them, constitute \nillegal discrimination under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 USC § 794, \nbecause they will force them and the class members whom they represent to go into segregated \nnursing homes in order to obtain the services they need and could receive in the community.7  \n  Defendants argue that the progress Louisiana made as a result of Barthelemy in offering \nhome- and community-based services, coupled with its stated commitment to achieving balance \nbetween institutional and community-based services, insulates it from ADA discrimination \ncharges.  They assert, without any support, that the modifications that Plaintiffs request will be \nunduly expensive to the State. \nFACTS \n \nThe LT-PCS Program \nLouisiana instituted the LT-PCS program approximately six years ago as part of the \nsettlement in Barthelemy v. DHH.  It is the largest program providing home- and community-\nbased services to the aged and disabled adult population.8 From the inception of the program, it \nprovided persons with disabilities who would otherwise need care in a nursing home with up to \n56 hours of help with activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, feeding, and toileting, in \ntheir homes.9  In March of 2009, Defendants reduced the maximum number of hours of LT-PCS \nto 42.10 In September of 2010, Defendants promulgated a new rule reducing the maximum \n                                                 \n7 Plaintiffs are not seeking in this action to enjoin the reduction in services as to all recipients of the \nservice—only as to the class members, who are, by definition, at serious risk of institutionalization as a \nresult of reducing community-based services. \n8 Exhibit 1, Deposition of Hugh Eley (“Eley deposition”) p. 102 l. 13 – 103 l. 2; Pitts Doc. 44 (documents \nproduced by Defendants in this case were referred to in Mr. Eley’s deposition, and will be referred to \nherein, by the number given them by Defendant). \n9 Louisiana Register Vol. 29, No. 6 June 20, 2003, pp. 911-13; Eley deposition p. 66, l. 5-8. \n10 Louisiana Register Vol. 35, No. 1 January 20, 2009, pp. 32-34; Eley deposition p. 66, l. 9 – p. 67, l. 17. \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 3 of 41\n\nnumber of hours that a participant in its LT-PCS program could receive from 42 to 32. There are \nno exceptions for people at risk of institutionalization as a result of the reduced hours.11   \nThe cut in the maximum number of hours from 42 to 32 will result in an average cut of \napproximately three hours of services for LT-PCS recipients.12  However, Plaintiffs all receive 39 \nor more hours of service a week, and their hours will be reduced by at least seven hours a week.13  \nThe severity of their disabilities causes them to need far more than the average number of hours \nof service.14  The reduction in hours falls disproportionately on them.  Plaintiffs do not believe or \nargue that all of the 3,600 individuals whose LT-PCS will be reduced to 32 hours a week will be \nplaced at risk of institutionalization.15  In Plaintiffs’ cases, their treating physicians confirm that \nthey face this risk. \nFacts Pertaining to the Named Plaintiffs: \n  The named Plaintiffs, Helen Pitts, 78, Kenneth Roman, 47, Denise Hodges, 53, and \nRickii Ainey, 30, and class member Cleo Lancaster, 61, all have severe disabilities.  Defendants \nhave not disputed any of the following facts regarding their disabilities, their needs for care, nor \nthe dire consequences of the reduced LT-PCS hours. \n                                                 \n11 Louisiana Register Vol. 36, No. 8 August 20, 2010, pp. 1749-52; Attachment E to Eley Decl., Doc. 11-3 \np. 11. The State reassesses each recipient annually and sets the number of weekly hours of service.  Of the \nnamed Plaintiffs, only Rickii Ainey’s assessment date has been reached, and Defendants have agreed to \ntemporarily maintain her services at their prior level, rather than require her to seek temporary relief in this \naction.   The same temporary agreement has been reached with Defendants for class member, Cleo \nLancaster, see infra. \n12 Eley deposition p. 206, lines 18-21. \n13 Exhibit 3, Declaration of Helen Pitts (“Pitts Decl”) ¶22; Exhibit 4, Declaration of Kenneth Roman \n(“Roman Decl.”) ¶20; Exhibit 5, Declaration of Denise Hodges (“Hodges Decl.”) ¶16; Exhibit 6, \nDeclaration of Rickii Ainey (“Ainey Decl.”) ¶28. \n14 Eley deposition p. 206, l. 18 – p. 207, l. 9; p. 208, l. 9-20. \n15 As of the date of the filing of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, of the approximately 12,000 individuals \nreceiving LT-PCS services, 28% received services in excess of 32 hours per week. The remainder received \nless. Defendants’ Memorandum at 9; See Eley Decl., ¶37.  Defendants do not have the breakdown of \npeople who receive 33 or up to 42 hours a week.   Plaintiffs have requested documents showing the number \nof hours that recipients of LT-PCS receive now, and how many they were receiving as of July 10, 2010. In \nresponse to Request No. 9 of Plaintiffs’ First Set of Requests for Production of Documents (Exhibit 2, p. \n12), which requested “Documents sufficient to show how many hours (from 1 to 42) of LT-PCS per week \nrecipients of LT-PCS receive: (a) As of July 1, 2010; and (b) Currently,” Defendants produced Pitts Docs. \n1701-1703, which do not provide any breakdown besides stating the total number percentage of those \nreceiving more than 32 and more than 42 hours a week. \n \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 4 of 41\n\nHelen Pitts:16 \n  Plaintiff Helen Pitts is 78 years old. She is divorced and lives alone in the community.17  \nMs. Pitts has had osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, congestive heart failure and \nlymphedema. She requires the use of oxygen daily and at night.  She is in constant pain in her \nlegs, arms, shoulders and back18. Plaintiff Pitts needs assistance getting in and out of bed and \ngetting in and out of her motorized scooter.  She needs help going to the bathroom because she \ncannot get on and off the toilet without help, needs help pulling her clothes up and down, and \nneeds help cleaning herself (in part to avoid decubitus ulcers).  She has incontinent episodes \ndaily. She needs help bathing, dressing and performing most of her personal hygiene.  Ms. Pitts is \nunable to prepare meals, do her laundry or attend to household chores.19 \n  Ms. Pitts’ physician, Dr. Gregory Ward, a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist \npracticing in Baton Rouge, who has treated her for over ten years, confirms her diagnoses, her \nfunctional limitations, and her need for in-home care, and notes that her multiple diagnoses put \nher “in a precarious situation.”20  He notes that when she lacked adequate in-home care for a \nperiod of time in 2008 or 2009, her condition greatly deteriorated.21  He expressed the opinion \nthat the 39 hours a week of in-home care that she is currently receiving is minimally adequate, but \nthat if her hours of care are reduced to the new maximum of 32 hours a week, her condition will \nagain deteriorate and she will be at risk of having to enter a nursing home for care.22 \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16 Helen Pitts has been on the waiting list for an Elderly and Disabled Adults waiver slot since September \nof 2007.  Since the filing of this action, she was offered and has accepted a waiver slot, but her waiver \nservices have not begun. \n17 Pitts Dec. ¶¶ 1-3. \n18 Pitts Decl. ¶8-12. \n19 Pitts Decl. ¶¶24-28. \n20 Exhibit 8, Declaration of Gregory Ward, M.D., (“Ward Decl.”) ¶¶1-10. \n21 Ward Decl. ¶11. \n22 Ward Decl. ¶¶9, 11-15.  \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 5 of 41\n\nKenneth Roman: \n  Plaintiff Kenneth Roman is 47 years old.23  Plaintiff Roman has had several strokes \nwhich has caused left side hemiparesis(paralysis). He also has diabetes, congestive heart failure, \nperipheral vascular disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, renal failure and irritable \nbowel syndrome, as well as had several heart attacks, the most recent of which was in 2009.24 Mr. \nRoman lives in the community and is currently separated from his wife.  One of the primary \nreasons they are separated is because his wife did not want to be his caregiver any longer. 25  Due \nto his impairments, Plaintiff Roman needs assistance with all of his ADLs, including bathing, \nwashing, and brushing his teeth.  He is incontinent and needs assistance cleaning after an \nincontinence episode.  This is even more important when his irritable bowel syndrome occurs.  \nHe is often incontinent of bowel and bladder at night and often must wait until his personal care \nworker arrives in the morning to assist with cleaning.  Plaintiff Roman needs assistance changing \nto a standing position from a sitting position.  Often he is not able to move in bed without \nassistance.  Not moving causes him severe pain and at risk of falling, when he tries to walk.26 \n  Kendra Whitney, M.D., a family practitioner in New Iberia, Louisiana, has been his \ntreating doctor for five years.27 She states that without adequate home care services, Mr. Roman is \nat great risk of falling and skin problems.  Lack of adequate in-home assistance would cause him \nto require expensive in-patient hospitalizations and use of hospital emergency rooms much more \noften.28  In her experience, not only in treating Mr. Roman but also in treating numerous patients \nwith disabilities, Mr. Roman’s 39 hours a week are medically necessary and the minimum that he \n                                                 \n23 Roman Decl. ¶1. \n24 Roman Decl. ¶12. \n25 Roman Decl. ¶10. \n26 Roman Decl. ¶¶15-18. \n27 Exhibit 9, Declaration of Kendra Whitney, M.D. (“Whitney Decl.”) ¶¶1-4. \n28 Whitney Decl. ¶8 \n  6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 6 of 41\n\nneeds to reside safely in his home.29  A reduction in his hours of service will put him at significant \nrisk of having to go into a nursing facility.30 \nDenise Hodges: 31 \n  Plaintiff Denise Hodges is 53 years old and lives alone in the community.32 She was \ndiagnosed with transverse myelitis in 1989 that left her paralyzed from the waist down, and in \n2001, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.33 Due to her multiple sclerosis, Ms. Hodges has \nfrequent extreme fatigue and loss of stability and requires extensive assistance transferring, \ndressing, toileting and bathing.  She cannot push her manual wheelchair, and she requires \nassistance with personal hygiene, meal preparation, shopping, laundry and household chores. \nPlaintiff Hodges requires digital stimulation in order to have a bowel movement and needs help \nwith cleaning herself and any laundry that must be done as a result of bowel movements. 34 Ms. \nHodges developed decubitis ulcers on one of her heels and on her lower spine during a period of \ntime when she was not receiving adequate community-based assistance.35 \n  Ms. Hodges has been under the care of Dr. Alreesa Minegar, a Board-certified \nneurologist, vascular neurologist, behavioral neurologist, and neuro-immunologist at LSU \nMedical Center in Shreveport.  He detailed Ms. Hodges’ need for home care and the devastating \nconsequences to her of a lack of such care.36  He noted that she faces extreme danger from \npossible complications of the incurable decubitus ulcers she has on her feet and legs if she does \nnot receive adequate home care. In addition to needing help with all ADLs, she needs frequent \nassistance after leaks to her urinary catheter.  In Dr. Minegar’s experience, people with \n                                                 \n29 Whitney Decl. ¶¶5, 7, 10. \n30 Whitney Decl. ¶¶11, 13. \n31 Like Helen Pitts, Denise Hodges has been on the EDA waiver waiting list for many years, since \nSeptember 11, 2007.

Therefore, he \nstates that the 39 hours a week of home care that she receives is clearly medically necessary.  \nWithout it, he believes that she would be at significant risk of deteriorating or having to enter a \nnursing facility.37 \nRickii Ainey: \n  Plaintiff Rickii Ainey is 30 years old and lives alone in the community. Ms. Ainey has \narthrogryposis (a congenital form of arthritis), is paralyzed from the waist up and has limited \nmobility in her legs. She has limited range of motion in her legs and the range of motion is \ndeteriorating.38  Ms. Ainey needs assistance with all activities of daily living, including but not \nlimited to bathing her upper body, including her face, arms and torso, and washing her hair; \ndressing in the morning and undressing when she goes to bed; adjusting her clothing before and \nafter toileting; getting on and off the toilet and cleaning herself after toileting; feminine hygiene; \neating and drinking; transferring from any surface to a standing position; and moving once in bed.  \nPlaintiff Ainey cannot prepare meals and cannot shop without assistance. In addition, she requires \nassistance to do all household chores and laundry.39 \n  Ms. Ainey’s internist, Christopher Lege, M.D., an internal medicine specialist at Touro \nInfirmary in New Orleans, has been treating Ms. Ainey for four years.  He confirms her diagnosis \nand functional limitations.40  He attributes Ms. Ainey’s having remained healthy to the fact that \nshe has had home-care assistance.  According to Dr. Lege, having dependable home-care has \nprevented her condition from progressing, by lessening stress she would place on her joints by \nattempting to do things on her own.41 He expresses the opinion that the 41 hours of personal care \na week that she receives is the minimum that is medically necessary, and that any reduction in her \n                                                 \n37 Id. \n38 Ainey Decl. ¶¶1-3. \n39 Ainey Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5. \n40 Exhibit 11, Declaration of Christopher Lege, M.D. (“Lege Decl.”) ¶¶ 1-7. \n41 Lege Decl. ¶8. \n  8 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 8 of 41\n\nin-home care is likely to cause her to be institutionalized in a nursing home.   He states that \nnursing home placement would be inappropriate and medically contraindicated for Ms. Ainey.42   \n  Ms. Ainey is also the care of a psychiatrist, Robert Ancira of New Orleans.43  He has \nbeen treating her for depression since 2007, which he attributes to uncertainty over whether she \nwould receive adequate personal care assistance.44  He states that the amount of personal care \nassistance she receives is necessary for her emotional, as well as her physical health.  If she were \nto have to enter a nursing home for care, he believes her emotional health would decline \ndrastically. 45 \nCleo Lancaster: 46 \n  Cleo Lancaster, a class member, is 61 years old and lives alone in the community in \nRayville, Louisiana.47  She has achodroplastic dwarfism, severe osteoporosis, and secondary \nhyperparathyroidism. Her condition has caused multiple fractures of her upper and lower \nextremities, her shoulders, and her hips, that have never healed.  These existing fractures cause \nboth physical deformity and severe pain, and prevent her from engaging in any weight-bearing \nactivities. Her use of her extremities is essentially confined to her hands.48  Ms. Lancaster unable \nto stand or to transfer herself from a bed to a wheelchair, or from her wheelchair to a toilet. She \ncannot use the toilet without assistance, and must therefore use incontinence underwear.  Ms. \nLancaster requires total assistance with transferring, toileting, dressing, showering, and personal \nhygiene. She is unable to move herself in bed.49   \n                                                 \n42 Lege Decl. ¶¶9-12. \n43 Exhibit 12, Declaration of Robert Ancira, M.D. (“Ancira Decl.”) ¶¶1,2. \n44 Ancira Decl. ¶3. \n45 Ancira Decl. ¶¶6-9. \n46 Defendants stipulated that Ms. Lancaster’s hours would be extended for 90 days, or through March 31, \n2011, rather than requiring her to seek preliminary relief in this action.

Even now, with almost 40 hours a week of \nservices, there are tasks that at times do not get done for her, and occasions when she has to sit in \na wet brief for extended periods.  If her hours are further reduced, she fears having to go into a \nnursing home for care.50 \n  Dan J. Lafleur, a physician practicing family medicine in Rayville, Louisiana, has been \ncaring for Ms. Lancaster for 15 years.  He works intensively with elderly people and people who \nhave disabilities, such as mobility impairments,  who require assistance with 'activities of daily \nliving.  His declaration states that none of his 2,000 patients have more serious disabilities than \nMs. Lancaster.51  He confirms her diagnoses and states that the 39.75 hours of home care that she \nis currently receiving are medically necessary, that Ms. Lancaster’s lack of mobility puts her at \nrisk for skin breakdown and decubitus ulcers, and that this condition is extremely dangerous.52  \nHe states that if Ms. Lancaster’s hours of home-care services are reduced, she will be at imminent \nrisk of needing to go into a nursing facility for care.  In his medical opinion, Ms. Lancaster’s \nhealth would be jeopardized if she went to a nursing home due to the effect this would have on \nher emotional state.  He believes that she would become depressed, that her health would decline, \nand that her life expectancy would be significantly shortened.53 \nNone of the Plaintiffs have family or friends who can provide the services they currently \nreceive from LT-PCS.54 \n \n \n                                                 \n50 Lancaster Decl. ¶¶ 18-20, 23, 26. \n51 Lafleur Decl. ¶¶1-6. \n52 Lafleur Decl. ¶¶7-12. \n53 Lafleur Decl. ¶¶17, 18. \n54 Ainey Decl. ¶9-15, 18,20-23, 28,  Hodges Decl. ¶10-12, 27, Roman Decl. ¶8-11, 23, Pitts Decl. ¶3, 7, 30, \nLancaster Decl. ¶2, 25. \n  10 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 10 of 41\n\nLouisiana’s History of Segregation and Institutionalization \n  Louisiana’s progress in expanding home- and community based services since 2000 was \nlargely the result of a Court-approved Settlement Agreement in the Barthelemy case.55  The \noriginal Settlement Agreement was approved at class fairness hearing October 18, 2001 (in SFY \n02).56 \nThe Barthelemy Settlement Agreement required DHH to create additional “slots” for \npeople in its Elderly and Disabled Adults Waiver (“EDA”), its Personal Care Attendant Waiver, \nand the Adult Day Care Center Waiver.  Most importantly for the instant action, the Settlement \nAgreement required the creation of the LT-PCS program.57  Due to a delay in implementing the \nLT-PCS program, the parties negotiated and entered a Supplemental Settlement Agreement, \nwhich called for a later date for start of the LT-PCS program, and for additional slots in the \nWaivers, on top of those to be created pursuant to the original court-approved and ordered \nAgreement.58 \nThe Louisiana Legislature attempted to kill the LT-PCS program before it started.   In \n2003, the Legislature reduced funding for the new program LT-PCS and ordered the Department \nto ask the Court for permission to add 2,000 waiver slots instead of implementing LT-PCS as \n                                                 \n55 Plaintiffs request that the Court take judicial notice, pursuant to Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of \nEvidence, of pleadings and stipulations filed in that case, in which the Louisiana Department of Health and \nHospitals and its Secretary were defendants.

Louisiana has one of the highest, if \nnot the highest, number of nursing home beds per capita in the nation,66 and institutionalizes a \nhigher percentage of its population over the age of 85 than any other state.67  In December of \n                                                 \n59 Motion by defendant LA Dept Health, defendant David Hood to alter or amend court-approved class \naction settlement, 00-1083 Doc.

No. 11-3, p. 2, shows that 17,185 “unduplicated” HCBS recipients \nwere added between SFY 2000 and SFY 2010. The number of “unduplicated recipients” is normally larger \nthan the number of waiver slots because turnover in slots allows more than one individual to receive \nservices under a waiver slot in a given year.  Eley deposition p. 75 l. 24 – p. 76 l. 6.  According to Doc. \n1041, in 2010 12,295 (71.5%) received only LT-PCS services (“LT-PCS non-waiver”); 905 received \nADHC services, 4,870 received EDA waiver services, and 221 of received services under the PACE \nprogram.

In contrast to the institutional expenditures, the total for home- and community-\nbased services (the sum of expenditures for LT-PCS ($189,137,091), Waiver-Adult Day Health \n($7,577,091), Waiver-Elderly and Disabled Adults ($104,623,458), and PACE ($9,722,518)) is \n$311,060,252.68  \nWaiting Lists for Appropriate Home- and Community-Based Services \n  If LT-PCS is reduced to a maximum of 32 hours a week, with no exceptions based on \nneed for services to avoid institutionalization in nursing homes, Plaintiffs and class members who \nhave the most severe needs for in-home care will have no options for community-based services, \nother than entering nursing facilities. As will be more fully discussed below, people receiving \nservices in the community do not take priority for waiver services.  To be able to advance to the \ntop of the waiting list, people must first go into a nursing facility, remain there for at least 90 \ndays, and then wait another 60 to 90 days, or even longer, to receive services once a slot is \noffered, assuming one will become available within that time period.69   \nIn Defendants’ Memorandum at pp. 8 and 21, they assert a defense that they have “more \ncomprehensive programs” that “may be more appropriate [than LT-PCS] for individuals with a \nhigher level of need.” These programs are the Elderly and Disabled Adult Waiver program, the \nAdult Day Health Care program, the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, and the \nMoney Follows the Person program.  However, because of limitations in the number of waiver \nslots, lengthy waiting lists, limited geographical availability and age limits, many people \ncurrently receiving LT-PCS cannot access these services as an alternative to nursing facility care.   \nElderly and Disabled Adults Waiver \nThe Elderly and Disabled Adults (“EDA”) waiver affords people who qualify an annual \n                                                 \n68 Pitts Doc. 1487, Eley deposition p. 23, lines 7-19. \n69 Eley deposition p. 78, line 7 –  p. 79 l. 5; p. 88, lines 3-12. \n  13 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 13 of 41\n\n“budget” of approximately $40,046, of which $1,680 must be spent for support coordination.70 \nThe remainder of the budget can be spent on a variety of services including service coordination, \nenvironmental modifications (to make a home more accessible), a personal response system, and \nhome care.71  The major service that is used is payment for a person to come into the home and \nprovide care.72 At the current rate of $11.32 per hour,73 the EDA will afford approximately 65 \nhours a week of home care.  This would certainly be adequate to maintain the Plaintiffs and \nothers like them at home, and prevent their having to enter an institution for care.  \n  However, as the following chart shows, there have been since at least 2007, and currently \nare, lengthy wait times for the EDA Waiver.74 The chart shows, for each date in the “Date” \ncolumn, the date the last person who was on the waiting list received an offer for waiver services, \nand the length of time the next person on the list had been waiting for an offer:  \n \nDate  Date of last EDA offer  Length of wait (months) \n01/01/07  1/30/2004  35.6 \n01/01/08  2/28/2005  34.6 \n01/01/09  1/8/2007  24.1 \n01/01/10  9/30/2007  27.5 \n01/01/11  8/15/2007*  41.2 \n \n*From March 2009 to September 2010, people on the waiting list who were not receiving LT-\nPCS were given priority over those who were receiving LT-PCS.  In September 2010 DHH \nchanged this policy.  The change in policy resulted in reaching people receiving LT-PCS who had \nbeen on the waiting list longer than some of those who were not receiving LT-PCS. \n  \n                                                 \n70 Eley deposition p. 73, line 20 – p. 74, line 9. \n71 Eley deposition p. 58, line 16 – p. 62, line 16.  The “new, more comprehensive waiver program” that \nDefendants refer to at p. 11 of their Memorandum as a replacement for the EDA waiver will add services \nfor people who are on the EDA waiver, but will add no new or additional waiver slots.

These priorities allow some persons to come to the top of the waiting \nlist —but they do not guarantee an immediate waiver offer.  Persons in priority groups are only \nguaranteed the “next available” waiver slot.80 In any event, these priorities do not apply to any of \nthe Plaintiffs, nor to many other individuals who need more than 32 hours of personal care \nservices to safely remain in their homes.  \nAdult Day Health Care Waiver \nThe Adult Day Health Care (“ADHC”) waiver affords care, including meals, nursing, \nsome therapies, and attendants, for at least five hours per day in an adult day care center.  ADHC \nis not available in many areas of the state, has slots for only 825 people, and has a waiting list \nover five months long.  \nWait times for the ADHC waiver are lengthy now and have been so for at least the last \n                                                 \n75 Eley deposition p. 69, line 10 – p. 71, line 16; Doc. 1687,  p. 2, items (d) and (e). \n76 Eley deposition p. 77, lines 4-10. \n77 Eley deposition p. 88, lines 3-8. \n78 Eley deposition p. 74, line 24 – p. 75, line 2, \n79 Eley deposition p. 41, lines 4-15. Though the Office of Aging and Adult Services requested funding of \n1,000 additional waiver slots in SFY 2011, this recommendation was not carried forward in the Executive \nBudget.  Therefore, the Legislature was never asked to fund the slots.

It also provides the State with additional funding for services to assist in \ntransitioning people from nursing facilities to the community.  It does not increase the number of \nslots in waivers, nor does it provide any additional services for people once the transition is made \nto the community.88 In order to be eligible for the MFP program, participants must have resided \nin a nursing home for at least 90 days.89 “Benchmarks” for the MFP program called for only 165 \npersons to be transitioned out of nursing homes by the end of 2010; however, Louisiana did not \nmeet the benchmarks set in its written protocol for the MFP demonstration project.90  \nNeeds of Plaintiffs and Class Members for LT-PCS \n  Unlike personal care programs in other states,91 Louisiana’s LT-PCS program requires \nrecipients to meet a nursing facility “level of care” in order to qualify for the program. Applicants \nfor home- and community-based programs, as well as nursing facility services, are screened for \neligibility using a tool called the “LOCET” or “level of care eligibility tool.”92 In addition, an \napplicant for the LT-PCS program must demonstrate that he or she “faces a substantial possibility \nof deterioration in mental or physical condition or functioning if either home and community-\nbased services or nursing facility services are not provided in less than 120 days.”93 The process \nby which this is determined is set forth in the definition of “imminent risk” in the manual for the \n                                                 \n87 Of the Plaintiffs discussed herein, only Rickii Ainey lives in one of the areas served by the PACE \nprogram, and she is only 37 years old. \n88 Eley deposition p. 89, line 7 – p. 91, line 13. \n89 Eley deposition p. 82, lines 5-23. \n90 Eley deposition p. 93, line 19 – p. 94, l. 13; p. 95, lines 8-25; Doc. 59, p. 38. \n91 Eley deposition p. 34, lines 4-8.  \n92 Eley deposition p. 132, l. 16 – p. 133, l. 6. \n93 34 LAC 50 XV §12905, Louisiana Register, v. 30 no. 12 December 2004, p. 2831. \n  17 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 17 of 41\n\nscreening process for LT-PCS.94 This requires the administration of stringent criteria set forth in \np. 7 of Exhibit 19.95   \n  When the LT-PCS program was started as a result of the Barthelemy case, the Settlement \nAgreement provided that the maximum number of hours was 56.  Prior to March of 2009, DHH \nused a level of services guide that attempted to estimate the actual number of care hours needed \nto determine how many hours of service recipients of LT-PCS would receive.96   Defendants do \nnot know and have no opinion as to whether or not the hourly amounts of service  were excessive \nto meet the needs of persons who required assistance with ADL’s.97  \nAs part of the Barthelemy Settlement Agreement, in March of 2009 the Defendants \nreduced the maximum number of hours in the LT-PCS program to 42.  The reduction was \nnecessary to restore the EDA waiver to cost-effectiveness, a requirement of the federal Medicaid \nstatute. 42 U.S.C. §1396n(c)(2)(D).98 At the same time, the Defendants began using a new \nassessment and allocation method, known as SHARe.99 The people in the highest acuity levels \nwere are assigned the highest number of weekly support hours to a maximum of 42.100 Recipients \ncould appeal their SHARe allocation to get a more hours (to a maximum of 42 hours) if they \ncould show that they needed the hours to avoid going into a nursing home. \n                                                 \n94 Exhibit 18, Level of Care Eligibility Tool (Eley Deposition Exhibit 2), p. 5. \n95 Exhibit 19, Institutional Risk CAP (Eley deposition Exhibit 3), p. 7. The test for “imminent risk,” as \nmodified by DHH, is for the person to show that he or she meets at least three of eight specified criteria: (1) \nhas had a prior nursing home placement within last 5 years; (2) does not leave their residence more than \nonce in a typical week in the last 30 days before the assessment; (3) urinary incontinence; (4) neurological \ndiagnosis (Alzheimer’s, dementia, head trauma, or multiple sclerosis); (5) a functional decline in the last 90 \ndays; (6) loss of ability to care for oneself (bathing, dressing, personal hygiene); (7) a sudden change in \nmental functioning, or (8) neither meal preparation nor shopping occurred in the last week.  People who are \nseeking to enter a nursing home are screened using the LOCET, but do not have to show that they meet the \n“imminent risk” criteria in order to qualify for nursing home services.

The new allocation methodology used data derived from \nExhibit 20, the MDS-HC, to identify recipients’ need for support in conducting activities of daily living \n(ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). The MDS-HC assessment generates a \nscore that assigns the individual to one of seven Resource Utilization Groups.  Some of the groups have \nsubgroups.  Each group and subgroup is then assigned a range of weekly support hours. \n100 Eley deposition p. 207, lines 5 – 9. \n  18 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 18 of 41\n\nThe reduction of the maximum from 42 to 32 in September of 2010 was not based on any \ndata regarding the weekly LT-PCS needs of the eligible population.101  In fact, Defendants have \nno data on how many hours of care that people eligible for LT-PCS might actually need to live \nsafely in the community and to avoid unnecessary institutionalization in a nursing home.102 They \nare unaware of any studies, analyses, or data on how many hours of personal care people who are \neligible for LT-PCS actually need to live in the community.  Defendants have not collected any \nsuch data, nor has it tried to collect information even on how long it takes people with disabilities \nto perform ADLs.103  Defendants are unaware of any studies that correlate unmet need for home \ncare with increased risk of institutionalization. 104 \nDefendant Department of Health and Hospitals in September of 2010 also adopted a \ndifferent method to determine how many hours of LT-PCS a person could receive.105  DHH \nbegan using an “ADL Index.”106  People who will be eligible to receive the highest number of \nhours of LT-PCS under this new methodology must score at least a 14 on the ADL index.All \npersons in the highest category in the ADL index must need actual physical assistance even to \nmove in bed, eat food placed in front of them, go to the toilet, and move from a bed to a chair.  \nFor more than one of these activities, they must need weight-bearing support to complete these \nbasic tasks.107  \n                                                 \n101 Eley deposition p. 160, lines 22-25. \n102 Eley deposition p. 152 l. 23 – p. 153 l. 1; Response to Request No. 5 of Plaintiffs’ First Set of Requests \nfor Production of Documents. \n103 Eley deposition p. 149, line 6 – p. 150, line 17. \n104 Eley deposition p. 151 lines 1-4. \n105 Plaintiffs are not challenging the change in allocation methodology in this case. \n106 Doc. 1949, p. 2; Exhibits 21 and 22 (Eley deposition exhibits 4 and 5); Eley deposition p. 164, l. 3- \np.172, l. 7; Exhibit 16, p. 2, items 7 and 8. \n107 The ADL index is constructed based on only four activities of daily living: (1) Mobility in bed: \nincluding moving to and from lying position, turning side to side, and positioning body while in bed; (2) \nTransfer—including moving to and between surfaces—to/from bed, chair, wheelchair, sanding position \n[Note—Excludes to/from toilet]; (3) Eating including taking food by any method, including tube feedings.  \nIt does not include “meal preparation” (“planning meals, cooking, assembling ingredients, setting out food \nand utensils”) which is an “IADL.” (4) Toilet use—including using the toilet room or commode, bedpan, \nurinal, transferring on/off toilet, cleaning self after toilet use or incontinent episode, changing pad, \nmanaging any special devices required (ostomy or catheter) and adjusting clothes.

Her teaching and research at the University of California, San \nFrancisco, has been focused on long term care, nursing homes, managed care, and home and \ncommunity based programs, with primary emphasis on Medicaid-funded programs.108  She has \npublished widely, has been principal investigator on major government projects dealing with care \nfor people with disabilities and the elderly, and has co-authored two scholarly publications on the \nunmet needs for personal assistance services and how to estimate the need for personal assistance \nservices for people with disabilities. She has done research for the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services and has been an expert for the U.S. Department of Justice.109  \nDr. Harrington examined the Defendants’ evaluations of the named plaintiffs.  Her \ndeclaration states that the national mean number of personal assistance hours received by persons \nlike Helen Pitts and Kenneth Roman who require assistance with three ADL’s, is 59.6 per week \nto remain safely and appropriately in the community.  For persons like Denise Hodges, who \nrequires assistance with four ADL’s, the national mean number of hours of personal assistance \nhours received is 85.9 per week.  For persons like Rickii Ainey, who requires assistance with four \nor five ADL’s, the national mean number is 118.5 hours per week.  Clearly, 32 hours per week is \nfar below the number of hours of care that these, and similarly-situated, individuals need to avoid \nthe risk of institutionalization and reside in the community.110 \nMitchell LaPlante, Ph.D. a national expert in personal assistance needs of persons with \ndisabilities has testified before Congress, conducted numerous studies and done extensive \n                                                                                                                                                \n    To score a 4 in any area, a person must need “extensive assistance,” “maximal assistance,” have “total \ndependence,” or have not had the activity occur at all, in the last three days.

Such individuals “are highly vulnerable and their \nmore detached informal networks do not compensate for lack of access to or reductions in public \nservices.”  Inadequate levels of help reduce the ability of people with disabilities to live \nindependently and increases their risk of institutionalization and death.  Dr. LaPlante goes on to \ndetail the consequences of inadequate levels of assistance:112 \nUnmet needs are especially serious for persons needing help with activities of daily living \n(“ADL’s”) such as when individuals go unbathed, remain in the same clothing for an \nextended period, are left in a bed or chair longer than is acceptable, or are unassisted \nwhen they need to go to the bathroom or eat.  These activities involve satisfying primary \nbiological functions that, if not fulfilled, cannot be tolerated for long and have immediate \nand serious consequences leading to death, institutionalization, injury, or worsening \nhealth. \n \nResearch has established a link between unmet need in ADL’s and increased risk of death \nin older persons with dementia; increased risk of being admitted to a nursing home; and rates of \nhospital admission; and depression.113  \nComparisons with Other States \nDefendants’ comparisons of Louisiana’s LT-PCS maximum to programs in other states \n(Eley declaration ¶43) ignore critically important differences between HCBS in other states and \nthose in Louisiana.  For example, Defendants did not compare the eligibility criteria for LT-PCS \nin other states to Louisiana’s.  They did not know if those other states require a nursing facility \nlevel of care, or imminent risk of institutionalization, as Louisiana does. 114 \n                                                 \n111 Exhibit 24, Declaration of Mitchell Laplante (“Laplante decl.”) ¶7. \n112 Laplante decl. ¶10. \n113 Laplante decl.  ¶¶ 11, 12, 14, and 15. \n114 Eley deposition p. 174, l. 20 - p. 175 l. 9.   \n  21 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 21 of 41\n\nFurther, a State plan personal care option is only one part of a State’s HCBS program.115 \nSome States use the personal care option as their main vehicle to provide home and community-\nbased services, and some States use waivers as their main program to provide these services.  In \ncomparing Louisiana’s offerings in the LT-PCS program to other states’, Defendants did not \nconsider what those other states offered in the way of waiver services.116 They did not compare \nthe waiting lists for the waivers in those states with the waiting lists for Louisiana waivers.117  \nIn fact, in 2007, Louisiana served 8,625 in its LT-PCS program, but Arkansas served \n14,223, Michigan 57,980, Texas 59,025, and North Carolina 49,877. 118 In 2007, Louisiana  \nserved 3,806 people in its waivers for the aged and disabled, while Arkansas served 9,249, North \nCarolina served 14,502,  and Texas served 53,770 individuals.119  \nIn 2009, Louisiana had 14,163 on waiting lists for its aged and disabled adults waivers, \nwhile Arkansas, the District of Columbia, Nebraska, and Oregon had no waiting lists; Maine had \nonly 107 people on its waiting list, Montana had 600, and Texas had 745,058.120  \nIn 2009, Louisiana was ranked 38th in per capita spending on home- and community \nbased waivers for the aged and disabled, expending only $15.85 per capita.121  Arkansas ranked \n19th, Texas 29th, North Carolina 23rd, District of Columbia 2d, and Idaho 8th.

Its participants must meet the level of care for a \nnursing facility and, if they went into a nursing home, the State would have to pay the Medicaid \nper diem to the nursing home proprietor.  Instead, participants in the LT-PCS program receive \nservices in their own homes.  The average cost of services for a person on the LT-PCS program \nonly is considerably less than the cost of maintaining a person in a nursing facility, and it has \nbeen so since the inception of the program.123  \n  Defendants claim (Memorandum at p. 21) that the reduction of LT-PCS will save $5 \nmillion annually. However, while the State is slashing spending for LT-PCS, it is increasing \nspending on nursing facilities. Nursing home rates have increased in every year since SFY 2003, \neven as numbers of individuals served in nursing homes have steadily declined.124  In SFY 2011, \nthe nursing home Medicaid per diem reimbursement was increased by approximately $8 per \npatient per day.125  The State’s Medicaid report shows that private nursing facilities were paid \n$737,529,166 in SFY 2010126 and were estimated to receive $801,550,525 in SFY 2011.127  State-\nowned nursing homes received another $20,735,439 in SFY 2010, and were allocated \n$20,857,156 in the budget for SFY 2011.128 This represents an increase of $64,143,076 (8.5%) in \na program in which numbers of individuals served have declined. \n                                                 \n123 Pitts Doc. 1041; Exhibit 16, p. 2, item 4.  \n124 Pitts Docs. 1188 and 44. \n125 Eley deposition p. 215, line 4 – p. 216, line 3. \n126 Pitts Doc. 43. \n127 Pitts Doc. 1487, p. 5. \n128 Id., p. 6. \n  23 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 23 of 41\n\n  Louisiana has one of the lowest occupancy rates of nursing facility beds of any state in \nthe U.S,129 yet expenditures on nursing homes continue to increase.  Annually, Louisiana’s long \nterm care budget includes over $23 million in payments to nursing homes for empty nursing home \nbeds.130 \n  Home and community based services, on the other hand, have been cut dramatically.  \nRates paid provider agencies for LT-PCS services (which include all overhead, employers’ share \nof taxes, workers’ compensation premiums, training, and recruitment costs, as well as direct care \nworker salaries131), have been reduced 17.4% since February of 2009. In SFY 2006, the \nreimbursement rate was $12 per hour.132 In February, 2007, the rate was raised by $2 per hour to \nincrease the wages of direct service workers.133 In February of 2009, the reimbursement rate was \nreduced by 3.5%, to $13.51.134   In August of 2009, the reimbursement rate was again reduced, \nthis time by 4.8%, to $12.86.135 In August of 2010, the reimbursement rate was reduced by 4.6% \nto $12.27, and in January of 2011, the rate was reduced by another 5.8% to $11.56. 136 \n  Defendants have produced no evidence as to the cost of providing services in excess of \nthe 32-hour cap only to those individuals who face a risk of institutionalization as a result of the \ncap.  Defendants have also produced no evidence that in calculating the budgetary effect of the \n32-hour cap, they took into account any increased costs in the other long-term care programs, \nsuch as nursing home care, the EDA waiver, the ADHC waiver, or PACE, from individuals such \nas plaintiffs who face institutionalization as a result of the cut. 137  Similarly, Defendants have not \n                                                 \n129 Eley deposition  p. 31, lines 19-21. \n130 Pitts Doc. 1353, Eley deposition p. 220, l. 21 – p. 223, line 5. \n131 Eley deposition p. 213, line 213, line 8 – p. 214, line 7. \n132 Pitts Doc. 1188, Eley deposition p. 19, lines 4-24. \n133 Louisiana Register, V. 34, No. 2 p. 253 (February 20, 2008). \n134 Louisiana Register, V. 35, No. 9 p. 1901 (September 20, 2009). \n135 Louisiana Register, V. 36, No. 2 p. 215 (February 20, 2010). \n136 Louisiana Register, V. 37, No. 1 p. 37-8 (January 20, 2011). \n137 In Exhibit 2, Plaintiffs’ First Request for Production of Documents, no. 22, Plaintiffs requested all \ndocuments that contain, refer, or relate to estimates of the budgetary effect that the implementation of the \nEmergency Rule of August 2010, effecting a reduction in the hours of LT-PCS available to recipients from \n42, on Defendants’ Medicaid expenditures for nursing facilities, the EDA program, the ADHC program, or \n  24 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 24 of 41\n\nincluded in any cost estimates the effect of reductions in services on hospitalization or emergency \nroom Medicaid expenditures. \nDecision-making Process for Reduction in Maximum Hours-  \n  The decision to reduce the maximum hours of LT-PCS that the Plaintiffs could receive \nfrom 42 to 32 was not made pursuant to any long-term plan for providing a mix of nursing facility \nand home and community-based services to Louisiana’s population of elderly and disabled adults.  \nInstead, it was made in response to a specific $61 million line-item reduction in the budget for the \nLT-PCS program in the Executive Budget for SFY 2011.138  The Office of Aging and Adult \nServices, the agency that is primarily responsible for developing the overall direction of programs \nfor the A/D population, did not recommend this reduction—in fact, it had recommended an \nincrease in the LT-PCS program for SFY 2011.139  As late as February 23, 2011, Mr. Eley had no \nidea where the idea for the reduction originated,140 At the same time that the Secretary of DHH \nand the Governor were reversing the Office of Aging and Adult Services on the issue of the LT-\nPCS budget, they failed to put OAAS’s recommendation for an additional 1,000 slots in the EDA \nwaiver in the Executive Budget.141  \n  Steve Kaye, a nationally-recognized expert,142 analyzed trends in Louisiana’s long-term \ncare services and compared them to those of other states.  Louisiana’s per capita expenditures on \nhome- and community-based services, starting from very low spending in 2000, increased above \n                                                                                                                                                \nthe PACE program.  Defendants’ response (Exhibit 2) invited further discussion.  Plaintiffs’ counsel \ncorresponded with Defendants’ counsel on February 4, asking: “Did DHH make any estimates of the effect \nthe reduction of hours of LT-PCS from 42 would have on the budget for Medicaid expenditures for nursing \nfacilities, the EDA program, the ADHC program, or the PACE program?  If so, we are seeking documents \nrelated to these estimates.”After a discussion, Defendants’ counsel responded on February 15 that \nDefendants had not identified any responsive documents.  \n138 Eley deposition p. 195, l. 15 – p. 203, l. 2; Pitts Docs. 3142 and 3121 (redacted by Defendants). \n139 Eley deposition p. 196, lines 14-23. \n140 Eley deposition p. 196, lines 10-11. \n141 Eley deposition, Letter from Caroline Brown, item 3, p. 1. \n142 Exhibit 25, Declaration of H.

However, \nsince 2009, Louisiana’s expenditures on HCBS have declined, and remain far below the national \naverage.143  This is also true when the proportion of expenditures on HCBS, as compared with \ninstitutional care (for the non-DD population), is compared among states and nationally.  \nLouisiana’s proportion of spending on HCBS grew from 2000 to 2009, but has declined sharply \nsince, so that it is now below both the national and the regional average.144  Louisiana has \ndeviated from the national trend of realizing cost savings on institutional care as HCBS \nexpenditures have increased.145  Though there has been a large reduction in the institutionalized \npopulation in the state, with declines exceeding both the national average and the other states in \nthe South Central region, per capita nursing home expenditure has increased substantially in \nLouisiana.146 While other states that have increased their HCBS spending generally saw a \ncommensurate reduction in nursing home expenditures, Louisiana has not succeeded in achieving \nsuch savings, because of increases in per-resident nursing home expenditures.  Dr. Kaye opines \nthat reducing nursing home spending, in line with already-achieved reductions in nursing home \nusage, would be more likely to generate savings in overall LTC expenditures than would cuts in \nHCBS programs, which would probably drive more people into nursing homes.147   \nARGUMENT \nStandard For Summary Judgment \nSummary judgment is appropriate when the record discloses “that there is no genuine \nissue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 56(c).  The moving party bears the burden of identifying those portions of the \npleadings and the discovery in the case that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact.

Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, (1986).  “If the moving party fails to meet its initial burden, \nthe motion for summary judgment must be denied, regardless of the nonmovant's response.\" \nDuffie v. United States, 600 F.3d 362, 371 (5th Cir. 2010).  \nIn deciding a summary judgment motion, the court must draw all reasonable inferences in \nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id. Citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 \nU.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).  Furthermore, the party opposing a \nmotion for summary judgment does not need to present additional evidence, but may identify \ngenuine issues of fact extant in the summary judgment evidence produced by the moving party. \nLavespere v. Niagara Mach. & Tool Works, Inc., 910 F.2d 167, 178 (5th Cir. 1990); Isquith v. \nMiddle South Utilities, Inc., 847 F.2d 186, 198-200 (5th Cir. 1988). The evidence of the \nnonmovant is to be believed, with all justifiable inferences drawn and all reasonable doubts \nresolved in his favor. Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 562, 124 S. Ct. 1284, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1068 \n(2004). \n1.  Analytical Framework \nIn Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 598-603 (1999), the Supreme Court held that \nunjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination based on \ndisability.  Thus, public entities must make reasonable accommodations in policies, practices and \nprocedures regarding the services that they provide to avoid such discrimination.  Id. at 603-606.  \nThey are not required to make modifications that constitute “fundamental alterations” of their \nprograms. Id. \nIn the instant action, the ADA requires Defendants allow persons who need more than 32 \nhours of personal care services in order to avoid institutionalization to receive those services. It is \nimportant to note that plaintiffs are not seeking to enjoin reductions in the LT-PCS program to all \nrecipients in the LT-PCS program — only those reductions to people who will be put at risk of \nunnecessary institutionalization by the reduction.  \nDefendants do not contest the fact that Plaintiffs are qualified persons with disabilities, \n  27 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 27 of 41\n\nwho can appropriately be served in the community. Neither do they contest Plaintiffs’ claims that \nthese reductions, if applied to them and to others like them, place them at risk of having to move \ninto institutions to receive care.148  Indeed, Defendants’ motion assumes the truth of Plaintiffs’ \nallegations that the named Plaintiffs and class members will be forced into institutions to receive \nthe services they are currently receiving in the community.  See Defendants’ Memorandum at 20, \n“The complaint alleges that Plaintiffs are likely to require institution-based services but those \nallegations, even if true, do not constitute discrimination”; and “…a State does not violate the \nADA’s antidiscrimination principle solely because some qualified individuals who prefer HCBS \nmight instead receive services in institutional settings.” \nDefendants’ Memorandum misunderstands the ADA, ignores the Supreme Court's \nOlmstead decision, and misstates the parties' burdens of pleading and proving discrimination.  \n2.  Plaintiffs have established a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act by showing \nthat they will be unnecessarily institutionalized. \n \nFar from establishing, as Defendants contend in their Memorandum at 2, that in \nchallenges like this one, “the court is not to look at individual plaintiffs or a single aspect of the \nState’s program but rather the entirety of the State’s program…,” Olmstead and its progeny make \nit clear that individuals with disabilities, who could appropriately be served in the community and \nare placed unnecessarily at risk of institutionalization by a State’s policies, establish \ndiscrimination under the ADA unless the State demonstrates that to provide services to them in \nthe community would entail a fundamental alteration of its programs. See, e.g.,  Radaszewski v. \nMaram, 383 F.3d 599, 614-15 (7th Cir.2004); Ball v. Rogers, No. 00-67 (D. Ariz. April 24, 2009) \n                                                 \n148 Defendants do point out that one of the named plaintiffs, Denise Hodges, by virtue of the fact that she \nhas already been on the waiting list for the EDA waiver since September 11, 2007, will soon be offered an \nEDA waiver slot and therefore will be able to access additional services.  Since Defendants’ motion was \nfiled, she and one of the other named Plaintiffs, Helen Pitts, and class member Cleo Lancaster, have also \nbeen offered waiver slots by virtue of their having already been on the EDA waiting list for more than three \nyears.  However, it takes 60 to 90 days after a slot is offered and accepted for services to begin. Defendant \nhas not established that these persons have received approval for their EDA services to begin.  When and if \nthey do, their claims in this case will be moot.  Yet other named plaintiffs, and many class members, will \ncontinue to be at risk.   \n  28 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 28 of 41\n\n(holding that defendants’ failure to provide adequate services to avoid unnecessary \ninstitutionalization was discriminatory); Makin v.

Cal. 2009) \n(all granting preliminary injunctions where plaintiffs were at risk of institutionalization due to \ncuts in community-based services). \n3.  Plaintiffs have established a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act by showing \nthat Defendants’ implementation of budget cuts discriminates against those  LT-PCS \nrecipients based on the severity of their disabilities. \n \nFurther, Defendants reduction of the maximum number of hours from 42 to 32 \ndisproportionately affects people who receive close to 42 hours a week.  While the average \nreduction that LT-PCS recipients will receive is 3 hours a week, recipients with the greatest needs \nfor services face cuts of 7 or more hours a week.  These are the people whose current allocation \nof service hours is greatest because their “acuity level”—the extent of their disabilities—is \ngreatest. The way in which these cuts are being implemented thus discriminates against LT-PCS \nrecipients based on the severity of their disabilities, in violation of the ADA. See Clark v. Cohen, \n613 F.Supp. 684, 693 (E.D.Pa.1985) (holding that a claim of a denial of access to a program \nbased on the relative severity of disability qualifies under section 504); Jackson by Jackson v. \n  29 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 29 of 41\n\nFort Stanton Hospital and Training School, 757 F.Supp. 1243 (D.N.M.), rev'd in part on other \ngrounds, 964 F.2d 980 (10th Cir.1992) (holding the failure of community programs for people \nwith developmental disabilities to accommodate the “severely handicapped” while serving less \nseverely handicapped persons stated a claim under section 504); Plummer by Plummer v. \nBranstad, 731 F.2d 574, 578 (8th Cir.1984) (same); see also Wagner v. Fair Acres Geriatric \nCenter, 49 F. 3d 1002 (3d Cir. 1995). \n4.  Plaintiffs and class members have no practical alternatives to nursing facility admission. \nWhile Defendants assert that it has other, comprehensive programs for persons who need \nmore than 32 hours a week of personal care for ADL’s, these programs are not in fact available to \nmany class members.  People who are living in the community are not able to access Defendants’ \nother programs (e.g., EDA, ADHC, PACE) without lengthy waits.  Though it may be possible to \nshorten this wait time if they enter a nursing facility and remain there for 90 days, they will still \nnot be guaranteed adequate community services on the 91st day.  What they will have is “priority” \nfor the next available waiver slot.   \nTo the extent that Defendants’ policy forces Plaintiffs to physically enter a nursing \nfacility as a condition of receiving the same services they have been receiving in the community, \nit.violates the ADA.  The Tenth Circuit, in Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care Auth., 335 F. 3d \n1175, 1181 (10th Cir. 2003), rejected the defendants’ argument that plaintiffs could not make an \nintegrate mandate challenge until they were placed in the institution, reasoning that   the \nprotection of the integration mandate, 28 C.F.R. §35.130(d): \n..would be meaningless if plaintiffs were required to segregate themselves by entering an \ninstitution before they could challenge an allegedly discrimination law or policy that \nthreatens to force them into segregated isolation. ..[W]hile it is true that plaintiffs in \nOlmstead were institutionalized at the time they brought their claim, nothing in the \nOlmstead decision supports a conclusion that institutionalization is a prerequisite to \nenforcement of the ADA’s integration requirements..  \n \nCongress did not intend that a person must wheel into the nursing facility in order to demonstrate \nto the State they want community-based services instead of institutional services.   \n  30 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 30 of 41\n\n  In Fisher, the Court concluded that “Olmstead does not imply that disabled persons who, \nby reason of a change in state policy, stand imperiled with segregation, may not bring a challenge \nto the state policy under the ADA’s integration mandate without first submitting to \ninstitutionalization.”  Id at 1182.  See also M.A.C. v. Betit, 284 F.Supp. 2d 1298,1309 (D.Utah \n2003), Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, 2009 WE 2941519,*7 (N.D.Cal. Sept. 10, 2009);  Haddad v. \nArnold, Case No. 3:10-cv-414-J-99-MMH-TEM, at DE #49 (M.D. Fla. July 9 2010); cf. Long v. \nBenson, 2008 WL 4571903 (N.D. Fla. Oct 14, 2008), aff’d 2010 WL2500349 (11th Cir.2010).    \n5.  The modification that Plaintiffs propose is a reasonable accommodation. \nThe modification that Plaintiffs propose is that they, and others in the class, be permitted \nto retain their hours of LT-PCS, which they have already been receiving, to the extent that the \nreceipt of those hours of service is necessary to prevent their institutionalization.  Again, \nPlaintiffs wish to emphasize that this does not necessarily mean that no one will be subject to the \n32-hour maximum—only that those individuals who would be placed at risk of \ninstitutionalization as a result of such reductions should be able to receive the services necessary \nto maintain their independence. \nDefendants have failed to establish that there are no material issues of fact in dispute and \nthat they are entitled to summary judgment on reasonableness of Plaintiffs’ requested \naccommodation.  They do not argue that Plaintiffs or other LT-PCS recipients should have their \nservices reduced because they are receiving services in excess of their needs.   \nPlaintiffs are not seeking a new service, as were the plaintiffs in Rodriguez v. City of New \nYork, 197 F. 3d 611 (2d Cir. 1999), or seeking to require Defendants to request new slots on their \nwaiver programs, as were the plaintiffs in ARC of Washington State v. Braddock, 427 F.3d 615 \n(9th Cir. 2005).  Plaintiffs are simply seeking to be allowed to keep the services that Defendants \nhave been and are currently providing, because those services are vital to their ability to continue \nto live independently in the most integrated setting, 28 C.F.R. §35.130(d).  \nPlaintiffs’ ADA claims are very similar to those in Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care \n  31 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 31 of 41\n\nAuthority, 335 F.3d 1175 (10th Cir. 2003), in which plaintiffs living in the community sought to \nretain pharmacy benefits that they already had, and to avoid having to enter a nursing home in \norder to receive the same services they could be and were receiving in the community.  The \nFisher Court held it was not clear “why the preservation of a program as it has existed for years \nand as approved by the federal government would ‘fundamentally alter the nature’ of the \nprogram.” Id. at 1183. \nDefendants cite examples of other states that they allege either do not offer LT-PCS as \npart of their State plan at all, or that have such services capped at less than 32 hours a week.149 \nHowever, these comparisons ignore important differences between the home and community \nbased service programs in the other states and in Louisiana, such as eligibility criteria for the \npersonal care program, the existence and ready availability of alternative programs, and overall \nexpenditures on HCBS.  These differences present clear factual disputes regarding the extent to \nwhich Louisiana compares favorably with other states.  But more importantly, without a showing \nthat these other states are in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act’s integration \nmandate, such comparisons are not probative on any material issue. \n6.  Defendants have not proved an affirmative defense. \nIn order to avoid liability under the ADA and Section 504, Defendants  must establish, as \nan affirmative defense, that the requested relief is not a reasonable accommodation but a \nfundamental alteration. See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 604; Frederick L. v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, \n364 F.3d 487, 492 n. 4 (3d Cir. 2004); Townsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511, 520 (9th Cir. 2003); \nDisability Advocates, Inc. v. Paterson, 598 F.Supp.2d 289 (E.D. N.Y. 2009); Joseph S. v. Hogan, \n561 F. Supp. 2d 280, 293 (E.D.N.Y. 2008); Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., 562 F.Supp.2d \n294, 323 (D.Conn.2008); Makin v. Hawaii, 114 F. Supp. 2d 1017, 1034 (D. Haw. 1999). C.f. \nJohnson v. Gambrinus Company/Spoetzl Brewery, 116 F. 3d 1052, 1059-60 (5th Cir. 1997) (in an \nADA Title III case, plaintiff bears burden of introducing evidence of accommodation that is \n                                                 \n149 See Defendants’  Memorandum at 22 and Eley decl, Doc. 11-2 ¶43. \n  32 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 32 of 41\n\nreasonable “in the general run of cases”; burden then shifts to defendant to plead and prove that \nthe requested modification would fundamentally alter the nature of the public accommodation: \n“The type of evidence that satisfies this burden focuses on the specifics of the plaintiff's or \ndefendant's circumstances and not on the general nature of the accommodation.”) \nA.   DHH does not have an “effectively working plan”  \n  The Olmstead Court’s delineation of defenses to unjustified institutionalization claims \nwas in the context of a claim by two individuals who were institutionalized and were on a waiting \nlist for waiver services. The two Plaintiffs argued that, because the cost of providing services in \nthe community was less than the cost of institutional services, it could not be a “fundamental \nalteration” of the State’s programs for them to receive community-based waiver services rather \nthan remain on a waiting list.  It was in that context that the Court stated that a State could avoid \nliability by demonstrating that it had “a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing \nqualified persons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings, and a waiting list that moved \nat a reasonable pace not controlled by the State’s endeavors to keep its institutions fully \npopulated.”150  If there was a plan to address the needs of institutionalized people on waiting lists \nand if the waiting list moved at a “reasonable pace,” then the modifications the Olmstead \nplaintiffs suggested would entail a fundamental alteration of those plans.  \n  The instant action presents a very different situation.  Here, the named plaintiffs and class \nmembers are not institutionalized and do not request to move ahead of others on the waiting lists \nfor waiver services.  They are simply seeking to maintain the services that they already have in \nthe community through the LT-PCS program.  Thus, to constitute an affirmative defense to \nplaintiffs’ claims, Defendants’ plans would need to address persons with disabilities who are in \nthe community and at risk of institutionalization, and the services necessary to prevent this.     \nDefendants point to two documents as constituting their “Olmstead” plans.  (1) A \n                                                 \n150 Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 601-03. \n  33 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 33 of 41\n\ndocument entitled “Plan for Immediate Action,” developed in 2005,151 which it states was a “first \nstep” that “sought to identify the key system components and hallmarks that States must have in \nplace if they are to rebalance their long-term care systems and provide a choice between \ninstitutionally-based and community-based long-term care services;” and (2) a 2007 document \nentitled “Louisiana’s Plan for Choice in Long-Term Care,”152 which outlines a number of \n“concrete steps” to be implemented over several year period.  Defendants claim that the existence \nof these documents, and the fact that home- and community-based services have greatly increased \nsince Louisiana’s near-total reliance on institutions in 2000, constitutes a complete defense to \nPlaintiffs’ request for a reasonable modification in its program to prevent their unjustified and \nunnecessary institutionalization. \nThese documents do not establish an affirmative defense to Plaintiffs’ claims for three \nreasons.  First, they do not actually contain plans for maintaining qualified persons with \ndisabilities in community settings. They do not even articulate meaningful, measurable goals for \nactually providing adequate community services.  Second, they are not “effectively working.” \nSufficient services continue to be unavailable and waiting lists continue to be unreasonably long \nand continue to grow.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly in this case, the actions that \nPlaintiffs are challenging here are not part of these plans.  If anything, the reduction in LT-PCS \ncontravenes the goals and strategies set forth in the plans.   \nLack of specificity: \n  While Defendants’ plans pronounce a commitment to the goal of allowing people to \nchoose to receive long-term care in the community rather than in institutions, they do not actually \nset forth a plan to achieve that goal.  They do not address specific programs, like the LT-PCS \nprogram, or the question of how people who cannot continue to survive in the community with \n                                                 \n151 Exhibit 2, Defendants’ Response to Plaintiffs’ First Set of Requests for Production of Documents, \nRequest 6; Pitts Doc. 256  \n152 Pitts Doc. 216. \n  34 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 34 of 41\n\nonly 32 hours of LT-PCS can be enabled to continue to live at home, rather than in institutions.153 \nThey do not even estimate the funding that would be needed to provide the services necessary to \nsustain such individuals in the community.154 The only time that the 2005 “Plan for Immediate \nAction” refers to the lengthy waiting list for waiver services for the aged and disabled population \nis when it states that it cannot include a recommendation for “allocating funding for all people \ncurrently on home and community-based waiver waiting lists,” because that would be  \ninconsistent with the requirement that the plan be “budget neutral.”155 The only reference to \nwaiting lists or registries in Louisiana’s Plan for Choice for Long Term Care is a “Major Action \nStep” listing: “Develop strategies to address management of the Request for Services \nRegistry.”156  \n  A fair reading of the plans and of updates to the plans,157 reveals that they do not set forth \nplans for actually achieving the stated goal of permitting people who meet a nursing facility level \nof care to choose community-based services over institutional services.   \n  Cases subsequent to Olmstead have held that to demonstrate a “comprehensive, \neffectively working plan” as an affirmative defense to a claim of unjustified institutionalization \nrequires more than simply introducing a document styled as a plan.  For example, in Frederick L. \nv. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare (Frederick L. II ), 422 F.3d 151 (3d Cir. 2005), the Third Circuit held \nthat to constitute a defense under Olmstead, a State plan had to “adequately demonstrate a \nreasonably specific and measurable commitment to deinstitutionalization for which [the state] \nmay be held accountable.” Id. at 157.  Though the State had a plan, it was insufficient because:  \n DPW remains silent as to when, if ever, eligible patients at NSH can expect to be \ndischarged.   Instead, DPW proffers general assurances and good faith intentions to \neffectuate deinstitutionalization.   General assurances and good-faith intentions neither \nmeet the federal laws nor a patient's expectations.   Their implementation may change \n                                                 \n153 Eley deposition p. 182, lines 4-13. \n154 Eley deposition p 183 line  - p. 184, line 5. \n155 Doc. 256, Plan for Immediate Action, p. 15-16, item 4. \n156 There are other references in this document to “Direct Service Worker” or “DSW” registries.  These are \nworkforce listings, not lists of people waiting for community services.  \n157 Pitts Docs. 26 and 31. \n  35 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 35 of 41\n\nwith each administration or Secretary of Welfare, regardless of how genuine; they are \nsimply insufficient guarantors in light of the hardship daily inflicted upon patients \nthrough unnecessary and indefinite institutionalization.   Thus, notwithstanding any \nannounced commitment to deinstitutionalization, DPW's failure to articulate this \ncommitment in the form of an adequately specific comprehensive plan for placing \neligible patients in community-based programs by a target date places the “fundamental \nalteration defense” beyond its reach.  \n \nId. at 158-59. See Haddad v. Arnold, supra at 34 (holding that an effectively working plan, would \nneed to show more than the fact that other programs had increased in size and expenditures but \nwould have to address the effectiveness of the particular program available to the plaintiff). \n  Louisiana’s plans have far less substance than the plans found lacking in Frederick L.158  \nIts “outcomes/indicators” are mostly lists, reports, and communications with “stakeholders.”  The \nonly “outcome or indicator” that calls for actual services to persons with disabilities is utterly \nnon-specific:  under the fourth objective, one “outcome/indicator” is “implementation of services \nthat are currently under development.”  What those services are, to whom they will be available, \nand when—all are significantly absent from the plan. \n  There is nothing inherently wrong with Defendants’ having plans of this nature, but such \ndocuments cannot serve as a defense to claims of unjustified institutionalization. \nPlan is not “effectively working”: \n   Not surprisingly, these plans have not resulted in the provision of adequate services to \nprevent institutionalization of people in the named plaintiffs’ situation.  The waiting list for \npeople in the community to access the most comprehensive service, the EDA waiver (except \n“documented cases of abuse and neglect” and people with ALS), is over 41 months long.  \nAlternative programs, such as the ADHC waiver and the PACE program, are not available \n                                                 \n158 The section dealing with Aging and Adult Services in “Louisiana’s Plan for Long-term Care,” Pitts Doc. \n216, pp. 13-15, states as its goal: “to provide affordable, accessible, timely, and customer-driven supports \nand services to the elderly and persons with adult onset disabilities in a variety of settings.” Placement of \npersons with disabilities in less restrictive settings, or diverting them from institutions via the provision of \nadequate community services is not even a stated goal.  Under the stated goal of providing timely services \nin a variety of settings, there are four “objectives“: (1) assess the current array of supports and services to \nidentify gaps and evaluate for effectiveness; (2) identify, evaluate and propose new or improved services \nand supports consistent with the stated goal; (3) develop a strategy to address barriers and obstacles to \nimplementation, access, and use of new and improved services; and (4) implement new or improved \nservices consistent with the stated goal. \n  36 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 36 of 41\n\nstatewide.  The ADHC waiver has a waiting list that is almost 6 months long.  People may access \nthese waivers sooner if they enter a nursing home for services, but Defendant has recently passed \na rule that even people in nursing homes must wait three months before gaining priority for \nwaiver services.  Once they are offered a waiver slot, it takes another 60 to 90 days, or more, for \ncommunity services to begin.   \nLT-PCS reduction is not included in plans: \n \n  Finally, it would not make sense to permit Defendants to use these plans as a defense to \nPlaintiffs’ claims unless they show, at the least, that the LT-PCS reduction was contemplated in \nthose plans or is at least consistent with them.  Defendants do not and cannot make such a \nshowing.  When these plans were developed in 2005 and 2007, people in Plaintiffs’ position were \nentitled to access up to a maximum of 56 hours a week of LT-PCS.  Neither of these plans, nor \nany updates, mention the reduction in available hours to a maximum of 32, with no exceptions for \npeople who may be institutionalized without more services.  They do not discuss budget cuts in \nLT-PCS, decreases in reimbursement rates to providers of LT-PCS, increases in reimbursement to \nnursing homes, or decreases in the proportion of the long term care budget devoted to home- and \ncommunity-based services.   \n7.  Defendants have not shown that to grant the modification Plaintiffs request would be \ninequitable \n \n  The fundamental alteration defense under Olmstead permits Defendants to demonstrate \nthat, despite the fact that the challenged action puts Plaintiffs at risk of unnecessary \ninstitutionalization, it would be inequitable to grant the reasonable accommodation.  Defendants \ncannot show that the modest accommodation Plaintiffs request—the maintenance of services to \nthose LT-PCS recipients who would be placed at risk of institutionalization if the maximum were \nenforced as to them--would be in any way inequitable.  \n  Defendants do not actually substantiate their claim that the “change” Plaintiffs are \nrequesting would cost the State “close to $5 million annually.”  Defendants’ Memorandum at 21.  \n  37 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 37 of 41\n\nDefendants have produced no evidence regarding the number of people, out of the approximately \n3,000 who currently receive services above the 32-hour-a-week level, that will be actually placed \nat risk of institutionalization as a result of the cuts.  Many of them will probably not be placed at \nrisk because the cuts they will receive may be minimal (e.g., from 33 to 32 hours a week), or \nbecause they have family members or other unpaid caregivers who can and will make up the \nreduced hours. Without any evidence of the actual cost of allowing only those persons placed at \nrisk of institutionalization to retain their service, Defendants cannot assert that they have \nestablished an affirmative defense. \n  Further, Defendants have not included the cost of institutionalizing Plaintiffs or other \nclass members in any of their estimates of the cost of continuing to provide LT-PCS to them in \nexcess of 32 hours a week. LT-PCS costs are far less than nursing facility costs.159  Assuming, \narguendo, a person presently receives the maximum of 42 hours of LT-PCS a week, at the current \nprovider rate of $11.56 per hour it costs the State $485.52 per week or $25,247 per year.  The \naverage cost of providing care to a Medicaid recipient in a nursing facility, on the other hand, is \n$37,480.160 By failing to even consider the cost of providing services to Plaintiffs and class \nmembers in nursing facilities, Defendants have ignored one side of the cost equation and stacked \nthe deck.  \n  Even if the modification Plaintiffs request to prevent their unnecessary \ninstitutionalization did cost “close to $5 million annually,” as Defendants assert, that alone would \nnot establish that to provide them with this relief would be inequitable. Budgetary constraints, \ntaken alone, are not enough to establish a fundamental alteration defense. Pa. Prot. & Advocacy, \nInc. v. Pa. Dep’t of Public Welfare, 402 F.3d 374, 381 (3d Cir. 2005).  As the Court of Appeals \nfor the Tenth Circuit stated, in rejecting Oklahoma’s argument that its limitation on a prescription \ndrugs for people receiving services through a Medicaid HCBS waiver in the community (while \n                                                 \n159 Pitts Doc. 44; Exhibit 16, item 4, p. 2. \n160 Pitts Doc. 1687, p. 3, item h. \n  38 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 38 of 41\n\nproviding unlimited prescriptions to nursing home residents) was necessary because of the state’s \nfiscal crisis:  \n[T]he fact that Oklahoma has a fiscal problem, by itself, does not lead to \nan automatic conclusion that preservation of unlimited medically-\nnecessary prescription benefits ... will result in a fundamental alteration \n....  If every alteration in a program or service that required the outlay of \nfunds were tantamount to a fundamental alteration, the ADA’s \nintegration mandate would be hollow indeed. \n \nId. at 1182-83 (emphasis added); see also Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 613-15; Crabtree v. Goetz, \n2008 WL 5330506 at *26; Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., 562 F.Supp.2d 294, 323, 345 \n(D.Conn.2008); Cota v. Maxwell-Jolly, 688 F.Supp. 2d 980, 995 (N.D. Cal. 2010). \n  On the contrary, the evidence before the Court suggests that it is the cut in LT-PCS that is \ninequitable.  The LT-PCS program is in demand and has been steadily growing.  The people \nserved by the LT-PCS program have to meet criteria for care in a nursing facility—in fact, they \nhave to meet are additional objective criteria that as to “imminent” or “institutional” risk, that \npersons seeking services in a nursing home do not have to meet.  \nThere is no reason to believe that people in the program are utilizing more services than \nthey need.  The reduction in hours came about strictly in response to a budget cut targeted \nspecifically at the LT-PCS program by someone in either the office of the Secretary of DHH or \nthe Governor’s office. The Office of Aging and Adult Services—the agency responsible for all \nlong term care services, both in nursing facilities and in the community-- did not propose this cut \nand in fact proposed increases in the program.  \n  In contrast, the number of persons in nursing facilities has been steadily declining, both in \nLouisiana and nationally.  Louisiana’s nursing home occupancy rate is only 72%--among the \nlowest, if not the lowest, in the nation.161  Despite the fact that this program is serving fewer and \nfewer people, the nursing facility budget, the per capita cost of nursing facility services, and the \n                                                 \n161  Pitts Doc. 1484.  Annually, payments to nursing homes include payments for empty nursing facility \nbeds that total more than $23 million. Pitts Doc. 1353; Eley deposition p. 220, l. 21 – p. 223, line 5. \n \n \n  39 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 38     03/14/11   Page 39 of 41\n\naverage nursing facility reimbursement rates have increased in SFY 2011 as in previous years, \nwhile rates to LT-PCS providers were cut drastically and maximum hours of service reduced \nfrom 56 to 32 hours a week over a two year period.  In the same year that LT-PCS was targeted \nfor a $61 million reduction in Medicaid reimbursements, nursing facilities received an increase in \ntheir Medicaid budget of over $48 million.  The reduction in LT-PCS services, with no \nexceptions, will force people like the Plaintiffs into more expensive, as well as more segregated \nnursing homes..  \nCONCLUSION \n  Defendants have failed to carry their burden of demonstrating that there are no issues of \nmaterial fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiffs’ claims.  \nPlaintiffs therefore request that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (converted to a Motion for \nSummary Judgment) be denied.  \nDate:  March 9, 2011. \n \n            Respectfully submitted,  \n            /s/ Nell Hahn         \n            Nell Hahn, T.A. \n            LA Bar No. 22406 \n            Advocacy Center \n            600 Jefferson St., Suite 812 \n            Lafayette, LA 70501 \n            (337) 237-7380, ext. 11 \n            Facsimile (337) 205-6166 \n            nhahn@advocacyla.org \n \n             \n            Stephen F.

In any event, the proposed  class  definition  sweeps far beyond the scope of \nplaintiffs’ claims; even if the Court believ es that certification is appropriate, the proposed class \nshould be redefined to make clear that it is limited to LT-PCS recipients who need more than 32 \nhours, and less than 42 hours, of state-funded personal care services each week. \nI.  Class Certification Should Be Denied. \nBefore certifying a class acti on, the Court m ust find that: “(1) the class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all m embers is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law o r fact \ncommon to the class, (3 ) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of the class ; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a).  Because Plain tiffs seek certification \nunder Rule 23(b)(2), the Court m ust also find that Defendants have “acted or refused to act on \ngrounds  that apply generally to the class, so   that final injunctive  relief  or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2). \nDefendants oppose certification of the pr oposed class on the grounds that the \nnamed plaintiffs’ claims are atypical of those  of absent class m embers and that conflicts of  \ninterest within the class preclude a finding that the named plaintiffs will adequately protect the \ninterests of the class.1 \n                                                 \n1 In the interests of judicial economy, Defendants ask the Court to exercise its discretion to defer \nruling on the motion for class certification until after it decides the pending motion for summary \njudgment.  See Floyd v. Bowen, 833 F.2d 529, 534-35 (5th Cir. 1987);  see also FED. R. CIV. P. \n23(c)(1) advisory committee’s note (2003); ALBA CONTE & HERBERT NEWBERG, NEWBERG ON \nCLASS ACTIONS § 7:15, at 53 (4th ed. 2002); FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER, MANUAL FOR COMPLEX \nLITIGATION  § 21.133,  at 253 (2004) (“[C]ourts  should  rule ear ly  on m otions  to dism iss, \nchallenging whether the plainti ffs have stated a cause of ac tion.  Early resolution of these  \nquestions may avoid expense for the parties and burdens for the court . . . .” (emphasis added)). \n- 2 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 32     01/10/11   Page 2 of 14\n\n \nA.  The named plaintiffs’ claims are atypical of those of other class members. \nRule 23(a)(3) requires Plaintiffs to demonstrate that “the claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative  parties are typica l  of the claim s  or defe nses  of  the clas s.”   T he  typicality \nrequirement  is not  satisfied  here  because, if the nam ed  plaintiffs’  claims  survive summary \njudgment, Defendants anticipate raising various defenses to their claims that are not available as \nto other members of the proposed class.   See, e.g., Warren v. Reserve Fund, Inc., 728 F.2d 741, \n747 (5th Cir. 1984);  Garonzik v. Shearson Hayden Stone, Inc. , 574 F.2d 1220, 1221 (5th Cir. \n1978).  But cf. Feder v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp. , 429 F.3d 125, 136-39 & n.7 (5th Cir. 2005) \n(finding no abuse of discretion wh ere the named plaintiff was “arguably,” but not necessarily, \nsubject to unique defenses). \nOne named plaintiff’s claim presents the question of whether a Medicaid recipient \ncan state a claim under Olmstead after declining placement in a waiver program that would have \nprovided the services s ought in the lawsuit.  DHH records  indicate that one of the nam ed \nplaintiffs, Rickii Ainey, was offered a slot in  the Elderly and Disabled Adult (“E DA”) waiver \nprogram in approximately 2004 but refused EDA se rvices.  Had Ms. Ainey accepted that offer, \nher personal care services would not be subject to the 32-hour cap she now challenges.2   \nA plaintiff in Ms. Ainey’s circ umstances cannot prevail on an Olmstead claim.  \nFirst, a State should not be subject to claim s of discriminatory and “unjustified placement or \nretention  of  persons  in  institutions,”  Olmstead  v. L.C. ,  527 U.S. 581, 596 (1999), by an \n                                                 \n2  Additionally, the Complain t  states  that Ms.  Ainey’s  mother  “lives nearby” but does not \ncontribute to her personal care (Doc. 1, ¶90) .  Although the Com plaint alleges Ms. Ainey’s  \nmother “refuses to assist her daughter,”  id., the Complaint does not alle ge that her mother is \nincapable of providing the nine hours of car e between the new 32-hou r maximum and the 41 \nhours that Ms. Ainey has been receiv ing, or that she will continue to  refuse if her assistance is  \nneeded to keep her daughter from entering a nursing home. \n- 3 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 32     01/10/11   Page 3 of 14\n\n \nindividual who enters a nursing  facility after having declined  adequate Home and Community \nBased (“HCBS”) services.   Second, even if relief under  Olmstead were sometimes available to \nsuch an individual, where other persons remain on the waiting list for such services, “immediate \nrelief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable, given the responsibility the State has undertaken for \nthe care and treatment of a large and diverse population of persons with mental disabilities.”  Id. \nat 604.  Third, when the plaintiff is so situated, a  federal court should be reluctant to exercise its \nequitable discretion to restructure and im pose substantial financial burdens on a state program . \nCf. Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312-13 (1982) (“The  grant of jurisdiction to \nensure compliance with a statute hardly suggest s an absolute duty to do so under any and all  \ncircumstances, and a federal judge sitting as chancellor is not mechanically obligated to grant an \ninjunction for every violation of law.”).  Alth ough Defendants do not know what portion of the \nproposed class would b e subject to each of th ese defenses, each argu ment presents a uniqu e \ndefense applicable to Ms. Ainey but not to the cl ass as a whole.  As a result,  the typicality \nrequirement of Rule 23(a)(3) is not satisfied. \nThe claims of another nam ed plaintiff, Helen Pitts, face a different but related \nproblem.  While Ms. Ainey has previously turned down a slot in the EDA waiver program, DHH \nrecords indicate that Ms. Pitts never sought an EDA waiver slot prior to the filing of this lawsuit.  \nAlthough Defendants anticipate challe nging Ms. Pitts’ claim s with defenses similar to those \noutlined above with respect Ms. Ainey, the def enses applicable to Ms. Pitts r est on different \ngrounds.  Put simply, when an Olmstead plaintiff’s temporary institutional placement results in \npart  from  her failure to have   pursued available services s ooner,  that placem ent  is not \n“unjustified”; granting her relief would be inequitable in light of the State’s obligations to others; \nand the court should not exercise its discretion to grant declaratory or injunctive relief.  Ms. Pitts’ \n- 4 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 32     01/10/11   Page 4 of 14\n\n \nclaims are therefore aty pical of those of absent class members who have pursued adequate \nalternative services and, under Plaintiffs’ understanding of the ADA, presumably have a stronger \nclaim for relief. \nA third named plaintiff, Denise Hodges, is  also subject to a defense not equally \napplicable to the r est of the proposed class.  As discussed below,  infra at 6-7, rule changes \nassociated with those challenged in this lawsuit have dramatically reduced the time that some \nmembers of the proposed class would have waited for a slot in the EDA waiver.  See Defendants’ \nExh. 1, Declaration of Hugh R. Eley, at ¶¶18-21 [h ereinafter Eley Decl.].  Denise Hodges is \namong that group.  On January 10, 2011, Defendants  offered slots in the EDA waiver to 158 \nindividuals.  Ms. Hodges is the recipient of one of these offers.  As a result, Ms. Hodges’ claim s \nare moot.  Additionally, because the 32-hour cap was unlikely ever to be applied to Ms. Hodges, \nshe may have lacked standing to sue in the first instance. 3  The same defenses are not equally \napplicable to most absent members of the proposed class, making Ms. Hodges’ claims atypical. \nDefendants have not been able to iden tify -- based on the Complaint and their \nown records -- a defense uniquely applicable to  the fourth named plaintiff, Kenneth Rom an.  \nNevertheless, the diverse circumstances of the four named plaintiffs alone suggests even greater \ndiversity among the proposed class as a whole and raises serious doubts that any named plaintiff \ncould adequately represent the enti re class.  In any event, wit hout further factual development, \nDefendants are not prepared to concede that Mr. Roman’s claims are typical of those of the class. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the claim s of three of the four nam ed plaintiffs are \natypical of those of the absent class m embers.  The diverse circumstances of the class members \n                                                 \n3 Ms. Hodges also now lacks any in centive to vigorously pursue class-wide relief, so she is not \nan adequate class representative under Rule 23(a)(4). \n- 5 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 32     01/10/11   Page 5 of 14\n\n \nsuggest the fourth named plainti ff is likewise an inadequate re presentative of the class as a \nwhole.  Regardless, no class shou ld be certified without further  factual development as to Mr. \nRoman’s adequacy as a class representative. \nB.  Plaintiffs cannot fairly and adequately  protect the interests o f the putative \nclass. \nConflicts of interest between named plaintiffs and members of the proposed class \npreclude a finding that the named plaintiffs will “fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).   The adequacy inquiry  “serves to uncover conflicts of interest \nbetween the named plaintiffs and the class they seek to represen t,” Amchem Prods., Inc. v.  \nWindsor, 521 U.S. 591, 625 (1997), and “‘[i]t is axiom atic that a putative representative cannot \nadequately protect the class if his interests are antagonistic to or in conflict with the objectives of \nthose he purports  to represent.’”  Payne v. Travenol Labs., Inc. , 673 F.2d 798, 810 (5th Cir . \n1982)  (quoting 7 C HARLES  ALAN  WRIGHT  &  ARTHUR  R.  MILLER,  FEDERAL  PRACTICE  & \nPROCEDURE § 1768, at 638 (1st ed. 1972)).  Certificat ion of Plaintiffs’ proposed class would \nviolate “the cardinal principle that a class representative may not head a class including persons \nwhose interests substantially conflict with his or her own.”  Id. \nIt is important to understand that the  32-hour services cap for LT-PCS services \nwas only one of several related adjustments made to the State’s comprehensive HCBS program.  \nIn light of the new cap, Defendants revised the priority groups for the EDA Request for Services \nRegistry so that current recipients of LT-PCS no longer fall into a low-priority group.   See Eley \nDecl., at ¶¶18-21.  As a result of this package  of reforms, some of the proposed class m embers \nwill receive offers for the more comprehensive services offered through the EDA waiver sooner \nthan they would have absent the reforms.  Indeed, a num ber will be offered EDA slots before  \ntheir  next annual assessm ent  and never be s ubject  to the lim it  on LT-PCS services.  (As  \n- 6 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 32     01/10/11   Page 6 of 14\n\n \ndiscussed above, Denise Hodges  has already benefited from  the new rules. )  Because m any \nputative class members will only benefit from the reforms challenged by the nam ed plaintiffs, \nthere is a clear conflict of interests within the proposed class. \nThe  interests of the proposed class ar e  fundamentally  conflicted for another \nreason as well.  Person al care services are an optional benefit.  The Medicaid Act does not \nrequire States to provide them.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A), 1396d(a)(viii)(24).  Both the \nsize and cost of this optional service have considerably exceeded the State’s expectations when it \ncreated the LT-PCS program.  See generally Eley Decl., at ¶¶31-43.   The program now serves \nnearly three times the number of recipients as it did only five years ago, but it costs nearly five \ntimes as much.  See id. at ¶34.  Because the costs of the LT-PCS program have been soaring \nwhile state revenue continues to decline, the program has drawn the attention of the state \nlegislature, which has di rected DHH to develop cost-control m echanisms.  See Declaration of \nEmergency, 36 La. Reg. 1749, 1749 (Aug. 20, 2010) (c iting Senate Resolution 180 and House \nResolution 190 of the 2008 Regular Session). \nIf Defendants are unable to im plement the 32-hour services cap and other cost-\ncontrol measures, they will be faced with the difficult decision of whether to eliminate the LT-\nPCS program entirely.  See Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss at 13-14.  The State’s choice will be \nbetween placing reasonable limits on the amount of LT-PCS service available to each recipient -- \nan  approach that allows the State to serve  an ever-growing population  of individuals with \ndisabilities -- and am ending the state Medicaid plan to eliminate the LT-PCS program  -- an \napproach that may allow the State to provide a greater amount of services to a smaller number of \nrecipients.  Although the State fortunately is not immediately faced with this dilemma, the choice \nhas bearing on the sustainability of the proposed class action.   \n- 7 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 32     01/10/11   Page 7 of 14\n\n \nThe Supreme Court addressed a comparable problem in Amchem Products, Inc. v. \nWindsor, a case invo lving certification of a class of  individuals who had been, or m ay in the \nfuture be, adversely affected by exposure to asbestos.  See 521 U.S. at 597.  The Court held that \nclass certification was improper because of the di sparity of interests between the plaintiffs who \nwere currently injured and those who m ight suffer future injury as a result of their exposure, as \nwell as the diversity within each category.   See id. at 626-27.  The Court explained: “Most \nsaliently, for the currently injured, the critical goal is generous immediate payments.  That goal \ntugs against the interests of e xposure-only plaintiffs in ensuring  an ample, inflation-protected \nfund for the future.”  Id. at 626.   \nA similar conflict of interests permeates the proposed class in this case.  Here, the \nquestion is whether class m embers favor a fis cally sustainable LT-PCS program that offers \nrecipients up to 32 hours of services every week , or a LT-PCS program with a higher m aximum \nand a greater probability that the program will be discontinued. \nDifferently  situated  members  of  the putative   class ar e  likely to an swer  this \nquestion differently.  At least  three categories of putative class members are likely to favor \nsustainability over immediate relief: (1) those who currently receive fewer than 32 hours of LT-\nPCS; (2) those who currently receive greater than 32 hours of LT-PCS but who could continue to \nlive in their current residence with 32 hours of LT-PCS and either a better allocation of their LT-\nPCS  services or supp lemental  assistance  from  family,  friends, or   other supports; and \n(3) “prospective recipients” of LT-PCS regardless of their current circumstances.  Putative class \nmembers  who fall into none of these catego ries  may  well favor  immediate  relief over a \nsustainable program, but that is not necessarily so. \n- 8 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 32     01/10/11   Page 8 of 14\n\n \nFor these reasons -- that some class members benefit from the challenged policies \nand that class members have divergent interests in the long-term sustainability of the LT-PCS \nprogram -- the named plaintiffs cannot adequately represent the interests of the class as a whole.4 \nII.  In Any Event, The Proposed Class Definition Is Overly Broad. \nAlthough Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges th at it is brought on be half of “nearly \n11,000 low-income people with severe disabilities” (Doc. 1, at ¶1) who have been receiving LT-\nPCS,” the named plaintiffs each fall within th e minority of LT-PCS recipients who have been \nreceiving in excess of 32 hours of services per week.  Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Opposition to \nthe Motion to Dismiss also acknowledges that “many, if not most, people with disabilities, could \nadequately reside in the community with a maximum of 32 hours a week of LT-PCS” and that \n“[i]t is only the minority of people with disabilities . . . who require m ore than 32 hours” (Doc. \n17, at 5).  The Mem orandum also asserts that Plaintiffs’ claim s “are very limited” in that the \nreduction from 42 to 32 hours “im plicates ADA and Section 504 . . . only  when it puts people \nwith disabilities at r isk of being institutionalized.”  Id. at 9.  Si milarly, Plaintiffs’ production \nrequests have defined the “people in the proposed class” as “those people who receive more than \n                                                 \n4 Plaintiffs’ motion suggests that Defendants’ concession that Plaintiffs can satisfy Rule 23(a)(2) \nnecessitates the conclusion that they can also satisfy the typicality and adequacy criteria of Rules \n23(a)(3) and (4).  See Memorandum in Support of Class Certifi cation at 7-8.  This is incorrect, \nand the Supreme Court has said as much.  See General Telephone Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. \n147, 157 n.13 (1982) (explaining that the typicality and commonality criteria “tend to merge with \nthe adequacy-of-representation requirement, although the latter requirement also raises concerns \nabout the competency of class counsel and conflic ts of interest.”).  “T here is considerable \noverlap  among the Rule 23(a) pr erequisites,  though each serves   discrete purposes and has \ndiscrete tests.”  N EWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS § 3.22.  Plaintiffs conflate the requirem ents of \nRule 23(a)(2), (3), and (4) entire ly; they flatly assert the absence of conflicts of interest within \nthe class, but their assertion is conclusory, unsupported by factual allegations or record evidence, \nand based on a faulty understanding of what Rule 23 demands. \n- 9 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 32     01/10/11   Page 9 of 14\n\n \n32 hours of LT-PCS before the reduction to 32  hours is implemented for them.” (Request \nNumber 62 in Plaintiffs’ First Set of Requests for Production of Documents). \nDespite these assertions that their claims are limited and that only a m inority of \nindividuals are affected by the challenged acti ons, the proposed class definition broadly (and \nvaguely) refers only to those “who can reside  in the community with appropria te Medicaid-\nfunded LT-PCS services.”  It is  not limited to those who have be en receiving in excess of 32 \nhours; nor is it clear that it is limited to those whose needs can be met within the current 42 hour \ncap.  Nor does it refer to the availability (or lack thereof) of family or other community support, \nor state services such as A dult Day Health Care (“ADHC”) available to supplem ent their LT-\nPCS services.  All of these limitations are necessary if a class is to be certified. \nFirst, as Defendants’ rules make clear, an individual who can establish that he or \nshe needs additional LT-PCS hours in order to avoid entering a nursing home can request and/or \nappeal  for additional hours,  up  to the 32 hours m aximum.    See  La. Admin.  Code tit. 50, \n§ 12901(D); 36 La. Reg. 1749, 1749 (Aug. 20, 2010).  Theref ore, there is no basis for the clas s \ndefinition to include individuals who do not claim that they need in excess of 32 hours, as there \nis already a process for requesting additional hours, up to the maximum. \nSecond, if a class is to be certified, th e definition must make clear that th e \nPlaintiffs are challenging only the most recen t reduction from a maximum of 42 hours to 32  \nhours, and that the class does no t include individuals whose need s can only be m et with more \nthan 42 hours of care. \nThird, the definition should make clear that state-funded services are intended to \nsupplement, not supplant, the natural supports th at individuals with di sabilities can and do \nreceive from their families and communities.  Therefore, the class should not include individuals \n- 10 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 32     01/10/11   Page 10 of 14\n\n \nwho have available natural supports or who can make arrangements, for example, to share living \nquarters, that may reduce the need for state-funded services.   \nFourth, the definition should clearly exclude individuals who could remain in the \ncommunity by supplementing their LT-PCS services  with services offered through other state \nprograms such as the ADHC waiver.  See Eley Decl., at ¶26. \nIn light of the above, Defendants propose that, if a class is to be certified, the class \ndefinition be as follows: \nLouisiana  residents  with  disabilities who have been receiving \nMedicaid-funded  services  through the LT-P CS  program;  who \ndesire to reside in the community instead of a nursing facility; who \nrequire more than 32 and less  than 42 hours of Medicaid-funded \npersonal  care  services  per week   in order to  avoid  entering a \nnursing facility, and who do not ha ve available (including through \nfamily supports, shared living arrangem ents, or enrollment in the \nADHC waiver) other means of receiving personal care services.   \nIII.  Further Development Of The Record Is N ecessary Before The Court Can Rule On \nPlaintiffs’ Motion For Class Certification. \n“The plain text of Rule 23 requires the  court to ‘find,’ not m erely assume, the \nfacts favoring class certification,” Unger v. Amedisys Inc., 401 F.3d 216, 321 (5th Cir. 2005), \nand “the party seeking certification bears the burden of proving a ll elements of rule 23(a),” \nBerger v. Compaq Computer Corp., 257 F.3d 475, 482 (5th Cir. 2001).   Plaintiffs have not yet \nestablished an evidentiary record sufficient to  support their class allegati ons.  Once Plaintiffs \nmake the necessary prima facie showing, Defendants may submit affidavits to counter Plaintiffs’ \nevidence and may seek class discovery.  Should m aterial facts remain in dispute, a hearing may \nbe warranted.   Cf. Bradford v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. , 673 F.2d 792 (5th Ci r. 1982).  In any \nevent, certification on the pleadings alone would be premature. \n- 11 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 32     01/10/11   Page 11 of 14\n\n \nIV.  The  Court Should Dismiss All Claims   Not Arising Under The ADA or \nRehabilitation Act. \nPlaintiffs’ motion for class certification b arely gestures at their Third Claim  for \nRelief, which they have all but  abandoned (Doc. 30, at 5).  Plainti ffs have previously conceded \nthat all of their claims not founded on the ADA or the Rehabilita tion Act “may be premature.” \nPlaintiffs’ Memorandum in Opposition to the Moti on to Dismiss at 22. This is in effect an  \nacknowledgement that the claims are unripe and th at the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear them. \nSee Roark & Hardee LP v. City of Austin , 522 F.3d 533, 544 n.12 (5th Cir. 2008). Because \nintroduction of matters outside the pleadings is no bar to dism issal under Rule 12(b)(1), see \nWilliamson v. Tucker, 645 F.2d 404, 412-13 (5th Cir. 1981),  the Court should dismiss the Third \nClaim for Relief now without awaiting further  proceedings on Defendants’ motion for summary \njudgment or Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. \nV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, class certification should be denied.  In any event, the \nproposed  class is overly broad and any clas s  certified should be lim ited  to those LT-PCS \nrecipients requiring between 32 an d 42 hours of service per week.   Additionally, the Court \nshould dismiss as unripe Plaintiffs’ Third Claim for Relief. \n- 12 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 32     01/10/11   Page 12 of 14\n\n \nDated:  January 10, 2011        Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/  Kimberly Humbles   \nKimberly Humbles \nLa.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n \nHELEN PITTS, ET AL \nCIVIL ACTION \nVERSUS \nNO. 10-635-JJB-SR \nBRUCE GREENSTEIN, IN HIS OFFICIAL \nCAPACITY AS SECRETARY OF THE  \nLOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH \nAND HOSPITALS, ET AL \n \n \nRULING ON PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n  This matter is before the Court on  Plaintiffs’ Motion (doc. 30) for Class  \nCertification.  Defendants  have filed an opposition (d oc. 32) to which Plaintiffs \nhave filed a reply (doc. 33).  There i s no need for oral argument.  This Court’s \njurisdiction exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.   \nBackground \nI.  Facts \n  This  case arises out of the State  of  Louisiana’s  decision  to lower the \nmaximum number of home-and-community-based health service (“HCBS”) hours \navailable to its disabled citizens.   Since 2003, Loui siana has offered HCBS to \ndisabled  individuals  through its long-t erm  personal  care ser vices  (“LT-PCS”) \nprogram.  The LT-PCS program provides disabled individuals with personal care \nworkers to assist them in performing basic tasks that they would ot herwise be \nunable to perform, such as personal car e or household chores.  Those who do \nnot qualify for LT-PCS, or seek additional or alternative services, may enter one \n1 \n \n\nof the State’s waiver programs.  However, each program suffers from limited \nslots, geographical or age limits, and/or waiting lists.  \nIn September 2010, in order to add ress budgetary concerns, the State \npassed Act 490, which lowered the maximum weekly LT-PCS service hours from \n42 to 32 (doc. 36, ex. 1, pp. 11, 66-67).  The cut applies not only to new LT-PCS \nrecipients  but al so  to indi viduals  currently  receiving  assistance  when  they \nundergo their annual eligibility assessments.   \nII.  Procedural History \n  On  September  22, 2010, Plai ntiffs  filed sui t  against  the Louisiana \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“LADHHS”) and its Secretary, Bruce \nGreenstein, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief (doc. 1). Plaintiffs assert that \nthe  reduction in LT -PCS  hours  unlawfully  discriminates  against  disabled \nindividuals  by depriving them of at- home  assistance  necessary  to rem ain \n“integrated” into the community in violation of the Title II of  the Americans with \nDisabilities  Act (“ADA”), 42  U.S.C.  § 12132 (2010),  and  Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 (“S ection 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (2010).  Plaintiffs \nrequest  that the Court order Defendants   to return to the 42-hour weekly \nmaximum.   \n  On December 20, 2010, Plaintiffs filed their Motion (doc. 30) for Class \nCertification.  Plaintiffs provided the following class definition:  \nLouisiana residents with disabilities who are recipients \nor  prospective recipient s  of  Medicaid-funded  services \nthrough the LT-PCS program; who desire to continue to \n2 \n \n\nreside in the community instead of in a nursing facility; \nwho  can reside i n  the co mmunity  with appr opriate \nMedicaid-funded LT-PCS services; and who are at risk \nof  being forced t o  enter  a nurs ing  home bec ause \nDefendants  plan  to reduce t he  level  of community-\nbased services.  \n \n(doc. 30, p. 1).  Plaintiffs assert that the class, as defined, satisfies Federal Rule \nof Procedure 23 for class certification. \n  On  January 10,   2011, Defendant s  filed  their oppositi on  (doc.  32).  \nDefendants assert that the proposed class definition is overly broad.  Defendants \nalso  assert that the named plaintiffs’   claims  and the defens es  likely  to be \nasserted against them are not typical of  the remaining class members.  Finally, \nDefendants assert that the named pl aintiffs have conflicting interests with the \nremaining class members and so will not  fairly and adequately represent their \ninterests.   \n  On January 25, 2011, Plaintiffs filed their reply (doc. 33).  Pl aintiffs assert \nthat the class is not overly broad.  Plaintiffs also assert that the named plaintiffs’ \nclaims and defenses are sufficiently typical to the remaining class members and \nthat the named plaintiffs will fairly a nd adequately represent the remaining class \nmembers.   \nDiscussion \nI.  The proposed class definition \nDefendants  assert t hat  the  proposed class i s  overly  broad bec ause  it \nincludes individuals who (1) do not require more than 32 hours of weekly service; \n3 \n \n\n(2) require more than 32 hou rs of weekly service, but have access to waiver \nprograms, financial resources or other means to secure supplemental care; and \n(3) require more than 42 hours of weekly service (doc. 32).   Defendants assert \nthat the class should be defined to e xclude these individuals and propose the \nfollowing class definition:  \nLouisiana  residents with  disabilities  who have been \nreceiving Medicaid-funded services through the LT-PCS \nprogram; who desire to reside in the community instead \nof a nursing facility; who re quire more than 32 and less \nthan  42 hour s  of Medicaid-funded per sonal  care \nservices per week i n order to avoid entering a nursing \nfacility,  and who do not  have  available (including \nthrough family supports, shared living arrangements, or \nenrollment  in the ADHC waiver) other means of  \nreceiving personal care services. \n \n(doc. 32).   \nPlaintiffs concede that the class definition should not include individuals \nwho do not need more than  32 hours of weekly service (doc. 33).  However, \nPlaintiffs disagree that the class should exclude individuals who require mor e \nthan 42 hours per week of service.  Plaintiffs also assert that the class should not \nexclude individuals who have access to the necessary supplemental care.   \nThe Court finds that the class should be defined to (1) exclude individuals \nwho do not require at least  32 hours of weekly ser vice; (2) exclude individuals \nwho  are capable of recei ving  the ne cessary  supplemental care through \nalternative sources; and (3) include individuals who require over 42 hours of care \nper week.  The Louisiana Administrative Code, states that “[t]he mission of [ LT-\n4 \n \n\nPCS] is to supplement the family and/or community supports that are available to \nmaintain the recipient in the  community” and that “[it] is  not intended to be a \nsubstitute for available family and/or community supports.”  La. Admin. Code tit. \n50, § 34 12901 (20 10) (emphasis added).  T herefore, whether a recipient has \naccess  to other means of   care shoul d  be considered  in  defining  the cl ass, \nkeeping in mind that the St ate has necessarily determined that current LT-PCS \nrecipients lack access to supplemental care.   \nHowever, individuals requiring over 42 hours of care per week should be \nincluded  in the c lass.   T he  ADA’s an d  Section 504’ s  “integration  mandate” \nprohibits  a stat e  from increasi ng  an indi vidual’s  risk of   institutionalization  if \nreasonable accommodations are available.  Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel Zimring, 527 \nU.S. 581, 597, 604, 607 ( 1999).  Individuals requiring more than 42 hours of \nweekly LT-PCS and who have  managed to remain out of  nursing facilities have \nnecessarily found access to supplemental care.  If these individuals are suddenly \nforced to make due with 10  less hours of weekly as sistance, the supplemental \ncare they have secured may  no longer be sufficient to avoid institutionalization.  \nAs such they almost certainly face a risk of institutionalization due the reduction \nand, in all likelihood, face a gr eater risk than those requiring between 32 and 42 \nhours  of weekl y  service.    Therefore,  the Court adopts the foll owing  class \ndefinition:  \nLouisiana  residents with  disabilities  who have been \nreceiving Medicaid-funded services through the LT-PCS \nprogram; who desire to reside in the community instead \n5 \n \n\nof a nursing facility; who require more  than 32 hours of \nMedicaid-funded  personal ca re  services  per  week  in \norder to avoid entering a nursing facility, and who do not \nhave  available (including  through  family  supports, \nshared living arrangements, or enrollment in the ADHC \nwaiver)  other  means of r eceiving  personal  care \nservices. \n \nII.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 \nPlaintiffs  assert that  they  meet F ederal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23’s \nrequirements for class certification (doc. 30).  Defendants assert that the named \nplaintiffs’ claims and possible defenses  thereto are not typical of the remaini ng \nclass members (doc. 32).  Defendants also  assert that the named plaintiffs will  \nnot fairly or adequately  represent the interests of the remaining class members \n(doc. 32).   \nThe class-action device was designed as a way to efficiently litigate cases \ninvolving issues common to a large group of individuals and turning on questions \nof law that appl y to each  member of the gr oup.  Gen. Tel. Co. of the S. W. v. \nFalson, 457 U.S. 147, 155 ( 1982).  In determining whether to certify a class, a \ndistrict court maintains substantial discretion.  Id.  To qualify for class relief under \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Pr ocedure, the plaintiffs must satisfy each of Rule \n23(a)’s requirements and at least one of Rule 23(b)’s requirements.  Rule 23(a) \nstates: \nOne or more members of a  class may sue or be sued \nas representative parties on behalf of all only of  (1) the \nclass  is  so n umerous  that  joinder  of all members i s \nimpracticable,  (2) t here  are  questions  of law or fac t \ncommon to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the \n6 \n \n\nrepresentative  parties are  typical  of  the clai ms  or \ndefenses of the class and (4) the representative parties \nwill  fairly and adequately pr otect  the interests of the \nclass. \n \nFed.  R.  Civ. P. 23(a).    Rule 23(b)(2) states that   “[a] class   action  may  be \nmaintained if . . . the part y opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds  that  apply  generally  to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”   \nA. Numerosity \n  Plaintiff  asserts  that the “numeros ity”  requirement  is  met  because  it is \nimpracticable  to join each of   the indivi dual  members of the class.     Plaintiff \nasserts that joinder is impr acticable because of the sh eer size of the class and \nbecause the class may include future members.  In addition, the class members \nare geographically dispersed and many lack sufficient financial resources to bring \nsuit individually.  Defendants do not contest that the proposed class is sufficiently \nnumerous.   \nThere  is  no magic number   for determining when  a  class  is suffi ciently \nnumerous for purposes of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.   See Mullen v. \nTreasure Chest Casino, L.L. C., 186 F.3d 620, 624 (5t h Cir. 1999) (stating that \nclasses  with over one hundred member s  generally  suffice).  The primar y \nconsideration for courts is the practicality of joining the  members of a proposed \nclass.  Zeidman v. J. Ray McDermott & Co., 651 F.2d 1030, 1038 (5th Cir. 1981).  \nThe practicality of joining  members of a class i s based on a number of factors \n7 \n \n\nincluding the sheer si ze of the class and whether  the class will include future  \nmembers.  Id. at 1039.   \nThe Court finds that the proposed clas s is sufficiently numerous.  Twenty-\neight  percent  of the 12,000 indivi duals  currently  receiving LT-PCS services \nreceive in excess of 32 hours per week (doc. 11, ex. 2, ¶ 37).  It would be nearly \nimpossible to join t he over 3,300 cases  were they to be f iled individually.  In \naddition, there are countless potential future members of the class who have not \nyet qualified for LT-PCS who may wish to preserve their rights.  Finally, many of \nthe proposed class members face severe financial hardship bec ause of their \nconditions.  These class members lack the financial resources necessary to bring \nsuit individually in order to vindicate thei r rights.  Therefore, Court finds that the \n“numerosity” requirement is satisfied.   \nB. Commonality \nPlaintiffs assert that there are common issues of law and fact as to each of \nthe class members, such as (1) whether Defendants violate the ADA or Section \n504’s integration mandate by lowering the maximum weekly services hours from \n42 to 32; or (2) whether Defendants vi olate the ADA or Section 504 by  requiring \nindividuals to submit to a  90-day stay in a  nursing facility to immediately qualify \nfor critical, supplemental services (doc. 30).  Plai ntiffs assert that differences in \neach member’s condition or the specific services each member requires do not \ndefeat  a finding of   commonality.  Defe ndants  do not contest t hat  there are \nquestions of law and fact common to the putative class members (doc. 32). \n8 \n \n\n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 requires that there be questions of law \nand fact that are common to each of the proposed class members.  See Mullen, \n186 F.3d at 625 (stating that the commonality requirement is satisfied if there is \nat least one issue, the resolution of whic h will affect a signif icant number of the \nputative class members); Lightbourn v. Cnty. of El Paso, 118 F.3d 421, 426 (5th \nCir. 1997) (same).    \nThe Court finds that there are questions of law and fact common to each of \nthe putative class members.  The cl ass includes all “Louisiana residents with \ndisabilities who have been receiving Medi caid-funded services through the LT-\nPCS  program” and “who r equire  more  than  32 hours   of Medic aid-funded \npersonal care services per week in order to avoid  entering a nursing facility.”   \nAny individual falling in this  class is at risk of bein g forced to en ter a nursing \nhome as a result of the reduction.  The overriding question of law in the case is \nwhether this risk violates the ADA’s integration mandate.  Moreover, whether the \nState’s waiver programs are sufficient to pick-up slack created by the reduction is \na question of fact common an d significant to all of the putative class members.  \nBecause  common questi ons  of law and fact exist, the Court finds that the \n“commonality” requirement is satisfied.   \nC. Typicality \nPlaintiffs  assert that  the  named plaintiffs’ clai ms  are typical to the \nremaining class members because (1) the proposed reduction in LT-PCS hours \nexposes class members to an increased risk of institutionalization, and all class \n9 \n \n\nmembers  would assert that   doing  so vi olates  the  ADA and Section 504’ s \nintegration mandate; and (2) all the class members would assert that the State’s \nwaiver programs provide supplemental services that are insufficient to avoid this \nrisk;  and  (3) all cla ss  members  would  assert  that, though an indivi dual  may \nimmediately receive sufficient supplemental services by submitting to a 90-day \nstay in a nursing facility,  this requirement violates the ADA and Section 504 by \nrequiring institutionalization (doc. 30).    \nDefendants assert that they anticipate advancing defenses to the named  \nplaintiffs’ claims that are at ypical to the remaining members of the class (doc.  \n32).  For instance, Defendant asserts that (1) unlike most other members of the \nclass, (1) Ainey was offered but declined placement in one of the State’s waiver \nprograms and therefore contributed to her risk of bein g institutionalized; (2) Pitts \nnever  sought placement  in  a waiver progr am  and  therefore  her bei ng \ninstitutionalized is not unju stified; (3) Hodges has be en offered placement in a \nwaiver program and her claim is therefore moot. \nIn reply, Plaintiffs assert that the individual circumstances cited for each of \nthe named plaintiffs are either mischaracterized or irrelevant (doc. 33).1 \nFederal rule of Civil Procedure 23( a) requires that the claims or defenses \nof the representative parties are typical of the c laims or defenses of the c lass.  \nThat is, the named representatives must advance claims and defenses that are \n                                            \n1 For instance, Plaintiffs assert that Ainey declined placement in a waiver program in 2004 because she \nwas on better financial footing and that her doing so is irrelevant to whether she is currently at risk of \ninstitutionalization.  Plaintiffs also assert that Pitts and Hodges are still on waiting lists for the EDA waiver \nprogram (doc. 33, ex. 8, ¶¶ 2-4).   \n10 \n \n\nsimilar, though not identical, to the claims and defenses that the remaining class \nmembers would advance were they to individually file parallel suits.  Lightbourn, \n118 F.3d at 426.  According to district courts throughout the Fifth Circuit, the test \nfor typicality is not demanding.  See, e.g., id.  That said, if th e facts surrounding \nthe named plaintiff are sufficiently different than othe r members of the cla ss, a \ndistrict court may deny class certification.  See, e.g., Warren v. Reserve Fund, \nInc., 728 F.2d 741, 747 (5 th Cir. 1984).  Courts ma y do so on the grounds t hat \nrepresentation of the class will suffer if the named plaintiff is preoccupied with a \ndefense which is applicable only to himself.  J. H. Cohn & Co.  v. Am. Appraisal \nAssocs., Inc., 628 F.2d 994, 999 (7th Cir.1980). \nThe Court finds that the named plaintiffs’ claims and the defenses to which \nthey are subject are sufficiently typical to the claims and defenses applicable to \nthe remaining class members.  First, whether and why the named Plaintiffs failed \nto avail themselves of the State’s waiver programs is reasonably in dispute.  It is \nquite possible that Plaintiffs did not require additional services when receiving 42 \nhours  of car e  per week, but now do as  a  result of the reducti on.   Mor e \nimportantly, the “typicality” test is “n ot demanding,” and the  parties’ claims and \ndefenses must be merel y “typical,” not “identical.” Lightbourn, 118 F.3d at 426.  \nHere, the named plaintiffs and remaining class members each claim that (1) the \nreduction  in servi ce  hours i ncreases  their  risk of institutionalization; (2) the \nwaiting lists for the State’s waiver programs do not move fast enough to provide \nthe supplemental care they require to avoid institutionalization; and (3) they must \n11 \n \n\nsubmit  to  the very type i nstitutionalization  they seek   to av oid  in order to be \nmoved up the waiti ng lists.  Because the named plaintiffs’ and remaining class \nmembers’  claims  are  sufficiently  similar,  the Court finds that   the  “typicality” \nrequirement is satisfied.   \nD. Fair and adequate representation by the class representatives \nPlaintiffs  assert t hat  the named plai ntiffs  will fairly   and adequately \nrepresent  the remaining cl ass  members  (doc.  30).  Plaintiffs   assert  that the \nnamed plaintiffs and remaining class members share the common interest in \nreturning to the 42-hour maximum.   In addition, Plaintiffs assert that the named \nplaintiffs will necessarily  and vigorously protect the  remaining members’ claims \nbecause the two groups’ claims are so factually and legally similar.   \nDefendants  assert t hat  some of the named plai ntiffs  will not fairly and \nadequately represent the r emaining members of the  class because (1) some \nnamed plaintiffs may be placed into wa iver programs sooner than they  would \nhave been absent the new rules and may not wish to invalidate them;2 (2) class \nmembers may conflict as to whether t he State should offer greater services, \nthereby risking that the State will eventually eliminate the program altogether for \nfinancial reasons or should offer lesser, more sustainable services (doc. 32).   \nIn reply, Plaintiffs assert that the  alleged conflicts are too speculative to \njustify the Court in denying class certification (doc. 33) \n                                            \n2 Defendants assert that Act 490 not only lowered the maximum weekly hours of service from 42 to 32, \nbut also made certain waiver programs easier to enter.  As such, class members who more easily entered \na waiver program as a result of the  Act, and thus had their care adequately supplemented, may not \nvigorously pursue having the Act invalidated.   \n12 \n \n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 requires that “the representative parties \nwill fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  The Supreme Court \nof the United States has stated that “the adequacy-of-representation requirement \n‘tends to merge’ with the commonality and typicality criteria of Rule 23(a), which \n‘serve as guideposts for determining whether . . . main tenance of a class action \nis economical and whether the named plaintiff’s claim and the class claims are so \ninterrelated that the interests of the class members w ill be fairly and adequately \nprotected in their absence.  Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 626 \nn. 20 (1997).  In determi ning the adequacy of representation, c ourts consider \nwhether  and t o  what exte nt  the class representati ves  have  common  and/or \nantagonistic  interests  to  the  remaining members   of the c lass,  and only  \ndifferences which create conflicts of interests between the named plaintiffs and \nthe  remaining  class member s  render  representation inadequate.   Id.  at  614; \nMullen, 186 F.3d at 625- 26.  Finally, Cour ts may consider whether the named \nplaintiffs have retained qualified counsel.  Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 614. \n  The Court finds that the  named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the remaining class members.  Plaintiffs have only challenged the \ncut in weekly LT-PCS service hours, not the State’s method of attending to the \nwaiting  lists for its waiver programs.    Though some indi viduals  may enter a \nwaiver program faster than they would have without the corresponding diminution \nin weekly service, Defendants have failed to demonstrate that this has occurred \nin fact.  In addition, De fendants correctly state that some class members may \n13 \n \n\nprefer to receive lesser services than others if necessary to make the LT-PCS \nprogram more sustainable.  However, the suit m akes clear the interest of the \nclass: to return to a 42-hour weekly maximum.  Issues relating to the program’s \neconomic viability are pertinent only to w hether such a return would constitute a \n“reasonable accommodation” or a “fundamental alteration”  to the proposed 32-\nhour maximum.   \n  In  addition, the Court finds that  the  named plaintiffs   have r etained \nsufficiently competent counsel.  Lead counsel, Nell Hahn, is an employee of the \nAdvocacy  Center, an or ganization  that advocates fo r  disabled i ndividuals  in \nLouisiana.  Hahn has practiced law for over 30 y ears and has participated in a \nnumber of class action suit s.  In addit ion, Co-Counsel Stephen F. Gold i s a \nnationally  recognized  expert in litigatio n  involving  the rights of disabl ed \nindividuals and has over 40  years of experience in that  field.  Therefor e, the \nCourt finds that the named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests \nof the remaining class members.   \nE. Actions generally applicable to the class \nPlaintiffs  assert t hat  the St ate’s  action  applies to th e  class  generally \nbecause each member will be subject to the 32-hour weekly maximum (doc. 30).  \nDefendants do not challenge Plaintiffs’ assertion (doc. 32).  \nFederal Rule of Procedure Rule 23(b)(2) states that “[a] class action may \nbe maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if . . . the party opposing the class has \nacted or refused to act on gr ounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \n14 \n \n\ninjunctive relief or corresp onding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting t he \nclass as a whole.”  The term “generall y,” as its used in Rul e 23(b)(2), requires \nonly that the Defendants actions affect all similarly situated persons or apply to \nthe class as a whol e.  Johnson v. Am. Credit Co., 581 F.2d 526, 532 (5t h Cir. \n1978).   \nThe Court finds that the State has acted on grounds that apply generally to \nthe class such that injunctive or declaratory relief would be appropriate.  The 32-\nhour weekly maximum plainly applies, not only to members of the class, but to all \nLouisiana citizens seeking HCBS.  As such, Plaintiffs’ suit satisfies Rule 23(b)(2).   \nConclusion \nAccordingly,  the Court  hereby  GRANTS Plainti ffs’  Motion (doc. 30) for \nClass Certification.  In ad dition, the Court adopt s the class definition stated on \npages five (5) and six (6) of this Ruling.   \nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana this 6th day of June, 2011. \nS\n \nJUDGE JAMES J.

This civil rights action seeks to prevent hundreds of low-income people with \nsevere disabilities from losing services that they have been receiving to live in the \ncommunity and to prevent them from being institutionalized in nursing facilities.  \nDefendants have assessed each of these people, have determined that each meets the \nLouisiana nursing facility level of care, and have identified their specific needs for \nsupport to conduct their activities of daily living in the community.    \n2.   Plaintiffs Kenneth Roman, 47, Rickii Ainey, 31, and Elizabeth Foster, 84, have \nsevere disabilities and multiple chronic conditions, including paralyses, strokes, chronic \nheart failures, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, as well as other impairments as enumerated \nbelow.   \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 1 of 21\n\n3.  The Plaintiffs all require assistance with activities of daily living, including but \nnot limited to assistance with bathing, dressing, toileting, eating, bowel and bladder care, \nmeal preparation and clean up, shopping, and laundry, and have been receiving such \nassistance in their homes as part of Defendants’ Medicaid-funded Long Term-Personal \nCare Services Program (“LT-PCS”).  Plaintiffs are active in their communities.   \n4.  The named and class Plaintiffs are all low-income and are recipients of Medicaid-\nfunded services, including those services that they currently receive in the community \nand whose reductions are the subject of their lawsuit.   \n5.  None of them wants to leave their homes, friends, and families and to go into a \nnursing home in order to receive the same Medicaid-funded services that they presently \nreceive in the community.  They are all at risk of institutionalization if their Long Term-\nPersonal Care Services are reduced and capped as defendants propose.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This action for declaratory and injunctive relief arises under Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (“ADA”) and the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.  § 794(a) (“Section 504”). \n7.  The Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343(a)(3) and (4).  Declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \nand 2202 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.  Plaintiffs’ causes of action for disability discrimination \nare authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 12133 and 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).   \n8.  Venue is proper because a substantial part of the actions and omissions of which \nPlaintiffs allege occurred in this District.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \n \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 2 of 21\n\nPLAINTIFFS \n \n9.  Kenneth Roman is a 47 year old resident of Jeanerette, Louisiana.  He is a \nrecipient of Medicaid benefits from the State of Louisiana. He has a disability as defined \nin § 12102(2)(A) of the ADA and a “handicap” as defined in Section 504. \n10.  Rickii Ainey is a 30 year old resident of New Orleans, Louisiana.  She is a \nrecipient of Medicaid benefits from the State of Louisiana. She has a disability as defined \nin § 12102(2)(A) of the ADA and a “handicap” as defined in Section 504. \n11.  Elizabeth Foster is an 84 year old resident of New Orleans, Louisiana. She is a \nrecipient of Medicaid benefits from the State of Louisiana. She has a disability as defined \nin § 12102(2)(A) of the ADA and a “handicap” as defined in Section 504.  Her daughter, \nDonna Zeno, has Ms. Foster’s power of attorney and brings this action as her next friend. \nDEFENDANTS \n \n12.  Bruce Greenstein is the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and \nHospitals (“DHH”). He is sued in his official capacity.  The Secretary of DHH is \nresponsible for the oversight, supervision and control of the DHH and its divisions, and is \nultimately responsible for ensuring that the DHH’s services for people with disabilities \nare provided in conformance with federal laws, including the ADA and Section 504, as \nwell as Medicaid. \n13.  DHH is the chief health policy and planning entity for the state.  It receives \nfederal financial assistance and is responsible for administering Louisiana’s Medicaid \nProgram. DHH is the “single state agency” that operates Louisiana’s Medicaid program, \nsee 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5). It licenses, certifies, and approves Medicaid payments to \nLouisiana’s Medicaid nursing homes, and administers its home- and community-based \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 3 of 21\n\nprograms, including the Elderly and Disabled Adult Waiver and Long-Term Personal \nCare Services programs for people with disabilities. \nTHE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \n14.     Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides that “no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.   \n15.      Under the ADA, institutionalization and segregation are prohibited forms of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities, 42 U.S.C. §12101(a)(3) and (5). The \nADA therefore requires that a public entity administer its services, programs and \nactivities in “the most integrated setting appropriate” to the needs of qualified individuals \nwith disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n16.     The ADA prohibits “exclusionary qualifications standards and criteria” and \n“relegation to lesser services, programs, … benefits, or other opportunities,”  42 U.S.C. \n§12101(a)(5), and therefore the regulations implementing Title II provide that “a public \nentity may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or \nother methods of administration:  (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified \nindividuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability; [or] (ii) that have \nthe purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the \nobjectives of the entity’s program with respect to individuals with disabilities....”  28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3). \n17.    Defendant DHH is a public entity under Title II of the ADA and its \nimplementing regulations. \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 4 of 21\n\n \nSECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT \n18.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §794a, provides:  \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States .., \nshall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from participation \nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance….      \n \n19.  Regulations implementing Section 504 require a recipient of federal financial \nassistance to administer its services, programs, and activities in “the most integrated \nsetting appropriate” to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.  28 C.F.R. \n§41.51(d). \n20.     Regulations implementing Section 504 prohibit recipients of Federal financial \nassistance from: \n[u]tiliz[ing] criteria or methods of administration... (i) [t]hat have the effect of \nsubjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of \nhandicap [or] (ii) [t]hat have the...effect of defeating or substantially impairing \naccomplishment of the objectives of the recipient’s program with respect to \nhandicapped persons.  45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(i) and \n(ii). \n \n21.      Defendants’ Medicaid program receives Federal financial assistance and must \ncomply with Section 504 and its implementing regulations.  Federal Medicaid funds \nmake up 81.48% of Louisiana Medicaid payments, including LT-PCS. \nTHE LONG TERM PERSONAL SERVICES PROGRAM \n22.  The Medicaid program, authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 \nU.S.C. §1396 et seq., is a joint federal-state program.  Medicaid is a cost-sharing \narrangement under which the federal government reimburses a portion of the \nexpenditures incurred by states that elect to furnish medical assistance to individuals \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 5 of 21\n\nwhose income and resources are insufficient to cover the costs of their medical care. The \npurpose of Medicaid is to furnish, as far as practicable, “medical assistance on behalf \nof...aged, blind or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to \nmeet the costs of necessary medical services” and “to help such families and individuals \nto attain or retain capability for independence or self-care....”  42 U.S.C. § 1396.  \n23.  States are not required to participate in the Medicaid program, but, if they choose \nto do so, they must operate their programs within federal statutory and regulatory \nprovisions. They must adopt a State Plan that delineates the standards for determining \neligibility and identifies the extent of Medicaid benefits.  Louisiana has chosen to \nparticipate in the Medicaid program and has adopted a State Plan. \n24.  The Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services \nadministers the Medicaid program at the federal level through the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services (“CMS”), which has urged states pursuant to the ADA to avoid \nunnecessary institutionalization of person with disabilities in nursing facilities. \n25.  One of the programs available through Louisiana’s State Medicaid Plan is LT-\nPCS. The Medicaid Act authorizes states to provide attendant care services under the \nfederal Personal Care Option, 42 U.S.C. §1396d(a)(24).   \n26.  The services of a personal care worker include assistance with basic personal \ncare, toileting and grooming activities; assistance with bladder and/or bowel requirements \nor problems; assistance with eating and food preparation; performance of incidental \nhousehold chores; accompanying to medical appointments; and grocery shopping. \nPersonal care services are normally provided in the recipient's home, though they can be \n  6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 6 of 21\n\ndelivered in another location outside of the recipient's home if the provision of these \nservices allows the recipient to participate in community activities.  \n27.  To qualify for LT-PCS in Louisiana, a person must meet the requirements for a \nnursing facility level of care, and must also meet one of the following eligibility criteria: \n(1) be residing in a nursing facility and could be discharged if community-based services \nwere available; (2) be likely to require nursing facility admission within the next 120 \ndays; (3) have a primary care-giver who has a disability or is over the age of 70; or (4) \nface a substantial possibility of deterioration in mental or physical condition or \nfunctioning if either home and community-based services or nursing facility services are \nnot provided in less than 120 days. Louisiana Administrative Code 50:XV.Chapter 129, \n§12505(A); Louisiana Register V. 29 No. 6 (June 20, 2003) pp. 911-13. \n28.  LT-PCS must be prior authorized by DHH after an annual assessment to ensure \nthe person continues to meet eligibility criteria. As a person’s needs change, the amount \nof LT-PCS services he or she receives in the community can change accordingly. \n29.  Defendants’ annual review of each LT-PCS recipient determines the specific \namount of services in hours that the person requires. \n30.  Since the inception of the LT-PCS program in 2003, DHH has used an assessment \ntool called the Minimum Data Set-Home Care (“MDS-HC”) to assess the need for LT-\nPCS.  Until March 1, 2009, the maximum amount of LT-PCS that a person could receive \nwas 56 hours per week. The actual allocation of service hours was based on the person’s \nlevel of need for assistance on each of seven activities of daily living (bed mobility, \ntransferring, locomotion (in and out of the home), dressing (upper and lower body), \neating, toileting, personal hygiene and bathing) and eight “instrumental activities of daily \n  7 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 7 of 21\n\nliving” (meal preparation, ordinary housework, managing finances, managing \nmedication, phone use, shopping and transportation).  \n31.  Beginning March 1, 2009, DHH, while it continued to use the MDS-HC, began \nusing a different scoring system called the “RUG III/HC” to assign LT-PCS recipients a \nmaximum number of hours of LT-PCS.  The maximum number of hours that any LT-\nPCS recipient could receive was reduced from 56 to 42 hours per week. \n32.  In August 2010, DHH announced that it was again changing the method of \ndeciding the number of hours allocated and reducing the maximum number of hours of \nLT-PCS service that recipients could receive, from 42 to 32 hours a week. \n33.  DHH has announced that the number of hours that an individual can receive will \nbe based on the individual’s score using an “ADL index.” The “ADL index” is a \ncomposite of scores as to how much assistance individuals need with only four activities \nof daily living:  eating, toileting, transferring, and moving around in bed. The maximum \nnumber of LT-PCS hours that an LT-PCS recipient will be able to receive varies with the \nperson’s score on the ADL index, from a low of 18 hours to a high of 32 hours, \nregardless of a person’s actual need for more hours.  \n34.  Nationally, the mean number of hours of personal assistance services that persons \nwho require assistance for four ADLs receive per week is 85.9 hours, and the mean \nnumber of hours persons who require assistance for five ADLs receive per week is 118.5 \nhours. \n35.  The reduction in maximum hours that Defendants are imposing on the LT-PCS \nprogram will be implemented for assessments of new LT-PCS recipients and for the \nannual reassessments of current recipients that take place after September 5, 2010. \n  8 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 8 of 21\n\n36.  The reduction in maximum hours that Defendants are imposing on the LT-PCS \nprogram is being imposed for purely budgetary reasons and is not based on the needs of \nthe persons who have been receiving LT-PCS services.  \n37.  This budgetary reduction will deprive LT-PCS recipients of critical services that \nare necessary to permit these individuals to remain safely in their homes.  At the present \ntime, Kenneth Roman receives 39 hours a week; Rickii Ainey, 41 hours of LT-PCS a \nweek; and Elizabeth Foster, 39 hours a week. \n38.  In deciding how many hours of LT-PCS will be allowed to each recipient, \nDefendants have not assessed or considered the amount of services that each needs, \nincluding such considerations as the unavailability of unpaid supports.    \n39.  Defendants have estimated that the reduction in maximum LT-PCS hours from 42 \nto 32 will impose an average reduction of three hours of service to LT-PCS recipients.  \nThe reduction thus falls disproportionately on recipients with the most severe disabilities \nand service needs, who receive more than 35 hours a week of services. \n40.  The reduction in LT-PCS hours results in the systematic provision of amounts of \nLT-PCS that are inadequate to allow plaintiffs and class members to live in integrated \nsettings. \n41.  The cost of providing care to plaintiffs in a nursing facility is higher than the cost \nof providing them with 42 hours a week of LT-PCS. \n42.  The reduction in LT-PCS hours violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 12132 (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § \n794(a) (“Section 504”), and the federal regulations implementing these statutes, by \nplacing LT-PCS recipients at risk of unnecessary institutionalization in nursing homes.   \n  9 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 9 of 21\n\nNAMED PLAINTIFFS’ NEEDS FOR PERSONAL CARE \nKenneth Roman  \n43.    Plaintiff Kenneth Roman is 47 years old and has lived in Jeanerette, Louisiana \nfor most of his life. He worked as a hairdresser and as a cook until 2002, when his health \nproblems forced him to retire. \n44.  Mr. Roman was determined eligible for Social Security Disability benefits in \n2002.  He $52 per month in Social Security Disability Insurance and $640 per month in \nSupplemental Security Income. \n45.    Kenneth Roman has had several strokes. As a result of the strokes, Mr. Roman \nhas left side hemiparesis. He also has  diabetes, congestive heart failure, peripheral \nvascular disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, renal failure and irritable bowel \nsyndrome. \n46.     Plaintiff Roman has also had several heart attacks, the most recent of which was \nin 2009.  \n47.     Mr. Roman uses a four-pronged cane for support and mobility. However, he \noften falls while using the cane due to his left side hemiparesis \n48.  Plaintiff Kenneth Roman is Medicaid eligible and receives LT-PCS services.  He \nlives alone in a trailer.  His parents live nearby, but both of are elderly and are themselves \ndisabled.  They are unable to assist him.  \n49.   Mr. Roman is currently separated from his wife.  One of the primary reasons they \nare separated is because his wife did not want to be his caregiver any longer.   \n50.   Due to his impairments, Plaintiff Roman needs assistance with all of his activities \nof daily living.  He is incontinent and needs assistance cleaning after an incontinence \n  10 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 10 of 21\n\nepisode.  This is even more important when his irritable bowel syndrome occurs.  He is \noften incontinent of bowel and bladder at night and often must wait until his personal \ncare worker arrives in the morning to assist with cleaning.   \n51.  Plaintiff Roman needs assistance changing to a standing position from a sitting \nposition.  He needs help bathing, washing his face and brushing his teeth.  He has \ndifficulty moving in bed and often is not able to move in bed when he has no assistance.  \nNot moving during the night causes him severe pain.  As a result of the pain, he often \nfalls in the morning when he tries to walk. \n52.  When Mr. Roman was first determined eligible for the LT-PCS program in 2008, \nhe was assessed and determined to need 47 hours per week of personal care services. In \n2009, Mr. Roman was reassessed and his LT-PCS services were reduced 39 hours per \nweek.  \n53.  The reduction of LT-PCS to 39 hours per week has been very difficult for him.  \nFor example, because his physical care needs are great, his shopping, laundry and \nhousehold chores (such as washing bed linens soiled in incontinence episodes) are not \ndone promptly. In addition, he must wait longer periods of time to be cleaned if he has a \nbowel or bladder accident when his caregiver is not present.   \n54.     Kenneth Roman is active in his church, where his father has been the pastor.  He \nhas several friends that are part of the church with whom he prays.   \n55.     Mr. Roman can safely live at home with 39 hours of LT-PCS services. If his \nLT-PCS hours are reduced, he believes that he would be forced to seek care in a nursing \nhome. Mr. Roman wants to stay home where he can continue to be part of his \ncommunity. \n  11 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 11 of 21\n\nRickii Ainey \n56.     Plaintiff Rickii Ainey is 30 years old. She lives alone in New Orleans, \nLouisiana, where she has lived all of her life. \n57.     Ms. Ainey has arthrogryposis, a congenital form of arthritis.  She is paralyzed \nfrom the waist up and has limited mobility in her legs. She has limited range of motion in \nher legs and the range of motion is deteriorating. \n58.     Because this impairment is progressive, she has required an increasing amount \nof care as she has aged. \n59.  Ms. Ainey has received Medicaid since she was a child.  \n60.  Ms. Ainey needs assistance with all activities of daily living, including but not \nlimited to bathing her upper body, including her face, arms and torso, and washing her \nhair; dressing in the morning and undressing when she goes to bed; adjusting her clothing \nbefore and after toileting; getting on and off the toilet and cleaning herself after toileting; \nfeminine hygiene; eating and drinking; transferring from any surface to a standing \nposition; and moving once in bed. \n61.     Ms. Ainey cannot prepare meals and cannot shop without assistance. In \naddition, she requires assistance to do all household chores and laundry. \n62.     Ms. Ainey can use the phone by placing it on her bed or other flat surface and \nusing her knuckle to dial.  She then bends at the waist and put her ear to the phone using \nthe bed or other surface for support.  To stand again, she must perform a rolling motion \nuntil she shifts her body to a standing position. If Ms. Ainey falls, which happens from \ntime to time, she cannot stand again without assistance and must wait for someone to \ncome and help her.    \n  12 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 12 of 21\n\n63.    Ms. Ainey’s mother lives nearby but refuses to assist her daughter. Ms. Ainey \nhas a sister who lives in Arkansas and four brothers who live in New Orleans.  Her \nbrothers cannot provide the intimate personal care she needs, and Ms. Ainey does not \nbelieve they are responsible enough to help her on a regular basis. \n64.  Ms. Ainey attempted suicide in December of 2006. The primary reason for the \nsuicide attempt was the fact that she had no personal care assistance. \n65.   Ms. Ainey learned about the LT-PCS program and began receiving LT-PCS \nservices in October of 2007.  At that time Ms. Ainey was awarded 37.5 hours per week of \nassistance. \n66.     In 2008, Ms. Ainey had surgery on her right knee.  She was reassessed and was \nawarded 55 hours per week of LT-PCS services.   \n67.   Upon her reassessment in late 2009, Ms. Ainey was told by the assessor that she \nwould receive only 30 hours per week of LT-PCS.  She immediately appealed.  When she \nreceived her official notice, it turned out that she had in fact been allocated 41 hours per \nweek of LT-PCS, which is the number of hours she is currently approved to receive. Ms. \nAiney has no assistance other than the 41 hours per week provided by her LT-PCS \nworker.   \n68.  A reduction of LT-PCS hours to 32 a week will not provide her with adequate \nassistance. Ms. Ainey does not want, at the age of thirty, to be forced to live in a nursing \nhome.  She is active in her community, and wants to continue to receive services in her \nown home.  \n \n \n  13 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 13 of 21\n\nElizabeth Foster \n69.  Elizabeth Foster is 84 years old and has a history of strokes, arthritis, and \ncognitive impairment.  She lives alone in New Orleans, Louisiana, next door to her \ndaughter, Donna Zeno. \n70.  Due to Ms. Fosters’ medical conditions, she has no ability to perform her own \npersonal care.  Ms. Foster cannot use her left arm.  She cannot stand or put any weight on \nher legs.  She is unable to reposition her body in bed. \n71.  Ms. Foster requires total assistance with transferring, toileting, bathing, personal \nhygiene tasks, and dressing.  She often needs to be fed by hand, as she sometimes cannot \nfeed herself with a spoon.  \n72.  Ms. Foster is incontinent of bowel and bladder and needs to be promptly cleaned \nand changed after her frequent incontinent episodes, to make sure that she does not \ndevelop pressure sores or other health problems.   \n73.  Ms. Foster cannot do her own shopping, use a telephone, prepare a meal or \nperform any housekeeping chores, including laundry. Ms. Foster receives 39 hours a \nweek of LT-PCS.  In addition, she receives services from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., five \ndays a week, at an Adult Day Health Care Center.  \n74.  Ms. Foster’s LT-PCS worker takes care of Ms. Foster at home in the morning \nprior to going to the ADHC, in the evenings after she returns home from the ADHC, and \non weekends, as well as accompanying her to medical appointments and grocery \nshopping for her.  \n75.  Ms. Foster’s daughter, Elizabeth Zeno, lives next door to her mother and sees her \ndaily. However, due to her own disabilities, Ms. Zeno cannot assist her mother with her \n  14 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 14 of 21\n\nactivities of daily living, and cannot dependably assist with her with her household needs, \nincluding meal preparation. \n76.  Ms. Foster’s other children live in other states and are not available to assist her. \n77.  Ms. Foster resides in the New Orleans “double” she purchased with her husband \nover 40 years ago. For many years, she worked peeling shrimp and cleaning fish in the \nseafood industry in New Orleans.  She worked until she was in her late sixties, when she \ndecided to retire. Ms. Foster was active in church most of her life and still enjoys going to \nchurch when she can.  \n78.  Based on her treating physician’s declaration, if Ms. Foster’s hours of LT-PCS \nwere to be reduced to 32 per week, she would deteriorate physically and cognitively, and \nwould require institutionalization in a nursing facility.  \n79.  Ms. Foster does not want to go into a nursing home.  She enjoys attending \nKingsley House Adult Day Health Care Center Mondays through Fridays. She has a \nclose-knit group of friends there, who have been attending the Center together for a \nseveral years.  She enjoys participating in games and field trips with her group from the \nCenter, and sharing meals with them. Ms. Foster also enjoys going out to eat and to \nchurch.  If she were to be institutionalized in a nursing home, her mental and physical \ncondition would deteriorate rapidly and unnecessarily. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n80.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2), the named Plaintiffs bring this action \non behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated. \n81.  The proposed class consists of Louisiana residents with disabilities who are \nrecipients or prospective recipients of Medicaid-funded services through the LT-PCS \n  15 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 15 of 21\n\nprogram; who desire to continue to reside in the community instead of in a nursing \nfacility; who can reside in the community with appropriate Medicaid-funded LT-PCS \nservices; and who are at risk of being forced to enter a nursing home because Defendants \nplan to reduce the level of community-based services. \n82.  The Plaintiff class is so numerous that joinder of all its members is impracticable. \nAs of October 21, 2101, of the approximately 12,000 individuals receiving LT-PCS \nservices, 28% received services in excess of 32 hours per week.  \n83.  These people want to continue living in the community.  A substantial number of \nthem are or will be at risk of institutionalization if they do not receive adequate Medicaid \nLT-PCS community-based services. Joinder is also impracticable because class members \nlack the knowledge and financial means to maintain individual actions. Future recipients \nof LT-PCS are also included in the class.  \n84.  The questions of law or fact common to the class include whether Defendants \nviolate the ADA and Section 504 statutory “integration mandate” and the “methods of \nadministration” prohibition, by requiring named Plaintiffs and class members to enter a \nnursing facilities in order to receive long-term care services, rather than providing those \nservices in appropriate settings in Plaintiffs’ homes and communities; \n85.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class as a \nwhole, in that the named Plaintiffs and purported class are Medicaid recipients of LT-\nPCS services who are at risk of being forced to enter a nursing facility to receive the \nsame services they receive in the community, and who desire to and who could live in the \ncommunity with the same, appropriate LT-PCS services that they have been receiving. \n  16 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 16 of 21\n\n86.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly represent and adequately protect the interests of \nmembers of the class as a whole.  The named Plaintiffs do not have any interests \nantagonistic to those of other class members.  By filing this action, the named Plaintiffs \nhave displayed an interest in vindicating their rights, as well as the claims of others who \nare similarly situated.  The relief sought by the named Plaintiffs will inure to the benefit \nof members of the class generally.  The named Plaintiffs are represented by counsel are \nskilled and knowledgeable about civil rights litigation, disability discrimination, \nMedicaid law, practice and procedure in the federal courts and the prosecution and \nmanagement of class action litigation.  \n87.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \nclass, thereby making final injunctive relief appropriate with respect to the class as a \nwhole under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).   \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF - TITLE II OF THE AMERICANS WITH \nDISABILITIES ACT \n \n88.  Plaintiffs and class members are individuals with disabilities in that they have \nphysical and other impairments that substantially limit one or more of their major life \nactivities.  \n89.  Plaintiffs and the class are qualified persons with disabilities in that they are \ncapable of safely living at home with necessary services. They meet the essential \neligibility requirements for the receipt of services from and participation in the State \nMedicaid program, 42 U.S.C. §12131(2).   \n90.  Without reasonable modification of the rules, policies, and procedures governing \nLouisiana’s Medicaid program, Plaintiffs are at risk of being isolated and segregated into \n  17 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 17 of 21\n\nan institutional setting.  This would be against their will.  They do not want to be placed \nin nursing homes. \n91.     Defendants’ denial of Medicaid funding for the LT-PCS services that Plaintiffs \nrequire to avoid segregation in an institution and remain in the integrated home settings \nthat are appropriate to their needs, constitutes unlawful discrimination in violation of \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing \nregulation, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  \n92.     Defendants have utilized criteria and methods of administration that subject \nPlaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of disability, including unnecessary \ninstitutionalization, by (1) failing to properly consider the services and supports that \nwould enable Plaintiffs to remain in the community; (2) by imposing the cuts in such a \nmanner that they fall disproportionately on recipients with the most severe disabilities \nand service needs; (3) by systematically failing to provide the amount of LT-PCS that is \nadequate to allow plaintiffs and class members to live in integrated settings; and (4) by \nproviding additional funding for services only if plaintiffs will enter nursing homes for \ncare, all in violation of Title II of the ADA and implementing regulations. \n93.  Defendant DHH has failed to make reasonable modifications in its policies, \npractices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on \nthe basis of disability, in violation of the ADA and its implementing regulations.  DHH \ncannot demonstrate that making such modifications in its programs that would afford \nPlaintiffs the ability in their homes with adequate services and supports would \nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity. \n \n \n  18 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 18 of 21\n\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF - SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION \nACT \n \n94.    Plaintiffs are “qualified person with disabilities” within the meaning of Section \n504.  They have physical and/or mental impairments that substantially limit one or more \nmajor life activities, and they meet the essential eligibility requirements for long term \ncare under Louisiana’s Medicaid program.   \n95.    Defendant DHH’s denial of Medicaid funding for the LT-PCS services that \nPlaintiffs require to avoid segregation in an institution and remain in the integrated home \nsettings that is appropriate to their needs constitutes unlawful discrimination in violation \nof Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §794(a), and its implementing \nregulation, 28 C.F.R. §41.51(d).   \n96.      Defendant DHH has also utilized criteria and methods of administration that \nsubject Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of disability, including risk of \nunnecessary institutionalization, by (1) failing to properly consider the services and \nsupports that would enable Plaintiffs to remain in the community; (2) by imposing the \ncuts in such a manner that they fall disproportionately on recipients with the most severe \ndisabilities and service needs; (3) by systematically failing to provide the amount of LT-\nPCS that is adequate to allow plaintiffs and class members to live in integrated settings; \nand (4) by providing additional funding for services only if plaintiffs will enter nursing \nhomes for care, thereby violating Section 504 and its implementing regulations. \n97.     Defendant DHH has failed to make reasonable modifications in its policies, \npractices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on \nthe basis of disability, in violation of Section 504 and its implementing regulations.  DHH \ncannot demonstrate that making such modifications in its programs that would afford \n  19 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 63     06/27/11   Page 19 of 21\n\nPlaintiffs the ability in their homes with adequate services and supports would \nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.  \nRELIEF REQUESTED \n \n           WHEREFORE, named Plaintiffs and the class respectfully request that the Court \ngrant the following relief: \nA.  Declare  that  the  Defendants’  denial  of  necessary  and  appropriately \nadequate Medicaid in-home community-based LT-PCS services for Plaintiffs constitutes \nunlawful discrimination in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  \n  B.  Grant  temporary,  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctions  enjoining  the \nDefendants, their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and all persons who are in active \nconcert  or  participation  with  them  from  denying  Plaintiffs’  Medicaid  necessary  and \nappropriate LT-PCS services “in the most integrated setting” so they can reside in their \nhomes, or from reducing Plaintiffs’ LT-PCS services that they currently receive in the \nLT-PCS  program  which  had  been  determined medically  necessary  and  the  minimal \namount of services the Plaintiffs required to avoid institutionalization in nursing facilities.   \nC .  Waive the requirement for the posting of a bond as security for the entry \nof preliminary relief. \nD.  Award the Plaintiff the costs of this action and reasonable attorney’s fees \npursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794a and 42 U.S.C. § 12133 and any other applicable provision \nof law. \nE.

Defendants \nadmit that individuals who receive greater than 35 hours per week immediately before these \nchanges are implemented will have their hours reduced by more than 3 hours per week.  \nDefendants deny the remaining allegations in paragraph 39. \n40.

Introduction \n   \n  This case arises out of the State of Louisiana’s decision to lower the maximum number of \nhours of home-and-community-based personal care service to 32 for the elderly and people with \nsevere disabilities who otherwise qualify for institutional care in nursing homes. Under the Long \nTerm-Personal Care Services program (hereinafter “LT-PCS”), Louisiana Medicaid provides \npersonal care workers to assist people with severe disabilities in their own homes to perform \nbasic activities of daily living, shopping, and household chores. In addition to its LT-PCS \nprogram, Louisiana provides home and community-based services (“HCBS”) through its \n \n1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 4 of 166\n\n \nMedicaid waiver programs.  As this Court has already noted in denying Defendants’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment, each of Defendants’ waiver program suffers from limited slots, \ngeographical or age limitations, and/or significant waiting lists,1 making the waiver programs \neffectively unavailable to large numbers of persons threatened with institutionalization as a result \nof the reduction of services in the LT-PCS program.  \n  Following this Courts’ denial of the Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment and its \ncertification of the class, Defendants promulgated a revision to its rules governing the waiting \nlist for services under its Elderly and Disabled Adults (“EDA”) Waiver,2 (hereafter referred to as \nthe “July 2011 Emergency Rule”). This revised rule for the first time provides some class \nmembers, who are threatened with institutionalization because they need more than the 32-hour \nmaximum, with a means of obtaining the services necessary to keep them out of a nursing home \nvia the EDA, without requiring that they first going into a nursing home as a condition to receive \nthese waiver services.  Pursuant to the July 20, 2011 Emergency Rule, EDA waiver opportunities \nwill be granted to up to 100 persons in the community who currently receive the maximum 32 \nhours of services allowable under the LT-PCS program and would require institutional \nplacement, unless offered an emergency waiver slot. \n  Though the July 2011 Emergency Rule provides a way some class members may avoid \nthe risk of institutionalization, it is so restricted that it will be practically useless to prevent \nplacing hundreds of vulnerable class members at risk.   \n  Plaintiffs seek a Preliminary Injunction requiring Defendants: \n                                                 \n1 Ruling on Motion for Summary Judgment (Rec. Doc. 54, May 18, 2011), p. 2. According to Hugh \nEley’s Second Declaration (Rec. Doc. 39-2), as of March 20, 2011, there was a wait time of 40 months \nfor people living in the community to access EDA waiver services. \n2 37 La. Reg. 1490-91 (June 20, 2011) (amending La. Admin. Code tit. 50, §8105). \n \n2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 5 of 166\n\n \n(a) To continue the LT-PCS services of class members, whose services have not yet been \nreduced to the 32-hour maximum, at their current level, and to provide a mechanism for class \nmembers whose services have already been reduced to obtain LT-PCS services above  the 32-\nhour cap; or, in the alternative,  \n(b)  To expand the operation of the July 2011 Emergency Rule making EDA waiver \nopportunities available to persons subjected to Defendants’ LT-PCS reductions, in order to \nprevent irreparable harm to class pending trial on the merits in this action, and to ensure that the \nprocess effectively and expeditiously provides these waiver services. \nII.  Background and procedural history \n  To qualify for LT-PCS in Louisiana, an individual who is living in the community must \nmeet the requirements for a nursing facility level of care, and must also meet one of the \nfollowing eligibility criteria: (1) be likely to require nursing facility admission within the next \n120 days; (2) have a primary care-giver who has a disability or is over the age of 70; or (3) face a \nsubstantial possibility of deterioration in mental or physical condition or functioning if either \nhome and community-based services or nursing facility services are not provided in less than 120 \ndays.3  \n  From the inception of the LT-PCS program until March of 2009, a person who received \nLT-PCS could receive as many as 56 hours of LT-PCS per week. The State reassesses each \nrecipient annually and sets the number of weekly hours of service. Until March of 2009, the \namount of LT-PCS that an individual could receive was determined by an independent assessor’s \nevaluation of the amount of assistance she required to complete the necessary activities of daily \n                                                 \n3 La. Admin. Code tit. 50 §12505(A); 29 La. Reg. 911-13 (June 20, 2003). \n \n3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 6 of 166\n\n \nliving and instrumental activities of daily living. In March 2009, Defendants instituted a 42-hour \nper week limit on LT-PCS.4  In September 2010, the State lowered the maximum weekly LT-\nPCS service hours from 42 to 32 – the issue in the instant action.5 The reduction in maximum \nhours to 32 per week is being imposed for purely budgetary reasons and is not based on the \nneeds of the persons who have been receiving LT-PCS services. (However, as this Court noted in \nits Ruling on Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment,6 the average cost of serving \nindividuals in the LT-PCS program, prior to the reduction, was less than the cost of maintaining \nthe same individual in a nursing facility.) The 32-hour “hard cap” on LT-PCS services applies \nnot only to new LT-PCS applicants but also to individuals currently receiving assistance. Most \ncritically, Defendants provide for no exceptions above 32 hours regardless of the acuity of the \npatient and regardless of the consequences of imposing the cap, regardless of any medical \nnecessity for services above 32 hours a week, and regardless of the imminence of \ninstitutionalization as a result of the capped hours. \n  Plaintiffs brought this action in September of 2010 to enjoin the State from imposing the \n32-hour maximum on individuals who would be placed at risk of institutionalization by the \nimposition of this cap. Plaintiffs claim that the reduction in maximum hours deprives LT-PCS \nrecipients of critical services that are necessary to permit them to remain safely in their homes, \nand that this violates Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and its implementing \nregulations,7 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and its implementing regulation.8  \n                                                 \n4 See 35 La Reg. pp. 32 – 34 (January 20, 2009), La. Admin. Code tit. 50 §12915(A).  \n5 36 La Reg. pp. 1752 (August 20, 2010), La. Admin. Code tit. 50 §12915(A) (hereafter called the \n“September 2010 Emergency Rule.”) \n6 Rec.

After preliminary discovery and briefing, \nthis Court denied Defendants’ Motion on May 18, 2011, holding that “the State’s current plan \nplainly violates the ADA by requiring a greater risk of institutionalization for people who require \nmore than 32 hours a week of assistance.”  \n  Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification on December 20, 2011.  On June 6, 2011, \nthis Court entered an Order 9 certifying that the case could proceed as a class action on behalf of: \nLouisiana  residents  with  disabilities  who  have  been  receiving \nMedicaid-funded  services  through  the  LT-PCS  program;  who \ndesire to reside in the community instead of a nursing facility; who \nrequire  more  than  32  hours  of  Medicaid-funded  personal  care \nservices per week in order to avoid entering a nursing facility, and \nwho do not have available (including through family supports, \nshared living arrangements, or enrollment in the ADHC waiver) \nother means of receiving personal care services.  \n \nIII.  Inadequacy of the July 2011 Emergency Rule \n \n  The  July  2011  Emergency  Rule  governing  allocation  of  slots  on  the  EDA  waiver \nprovides, in pertinent part: \nE. Notwithstanding the priority group provisions, up to 100 EDA Waiver \nopportunities may be granted to qualified individuals who require emergency \nwaiver services. These individuals shall be offered an opportunity on a first-\ncome, first-serve basis.  \n1.  To be considered for an emergency waiver opportunity, the individual \nmust currently receive the maximum amount of services allowable \nunder the Long Term Personal Care Services Program and \nrequire institutional placement, unless offered an emergency \nwaiver opportunity.  \n2.  The following criteria shall be considered in determining whether or \nnot to grant an emergency waiver opportunity:  \na.  support through other programs is either unavailable or \n                                                                                                                                                            \n \n9 Ruling on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (Rec. Doc. 58, June 6, 2011) pp. 5-6. \n \n5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 8 of 166\n\n \ninadequate;  \nb.  the death or incapacitation of an informal caregiver leaves the \nperson without other supports;  \nc.  the support from an informal caregiver is not available due to a \nfamily crisis; or  \nd.  the person lives alone and has no access to informal support.  \n37 La. Reg. 1490-91 (June 20, 2011) \n  From the date the case commenced, when Plaintiffs notified Defendants that either the \nnamed Plaintiffs or specific class members, who required more than 32 hours  week of LT-PCS, \nwould seek a preliminary injunction on behalf of specific persons, Defendants agreed that LT-\nPCS for those specific people would be provided in excess of the 32 hour cap, thus obviating the \nneed to file and seek a preliminary injunction.  Defendants have stipulated that the current level \nof LT-PCS hours will be extended at least until December 31, 2011, for all named Plaintiffs and \nsix other individuals whose situations Plaintiffs’ counsel have brought to their attention.  \nHowever, many other class members, including E.B. and C.D., discussed below, have already \nhad their services reduced, and others are threatened with reductions, irrespective of their risk of \ndeterioration and institutionalization. \n  As of June 15, 2011, 1,567 persons who had more than 32 hours a week of service as of \nSeptember 5, 2010 (the date the 32-hour cap went into effect), have had their service hours \nreduced to 32 hours a week or fewer.10   \n  An additional 1,991 people who are currently receiving over 32 hours a week of LT-PCS \n                                                 \n10 Exhibit 1, Third Declaration of Jeanne Abadie (“Abadie Decl.”), ¶¶ 2-4.  Defendants provided \nPlaintiffs with a file entitled “Master Spreadsheet—Interrogatory No. 2” in response to Interrogatory No. \n2 of Plaintiffs’ First Set of Interrogatories.  This spreadsheet included information on individuals who \nwere approved to receive more than 32 hours a week prior to the application of the September 5, 2010 \nreduction.  \n \n \n6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 9 of 166\n\n \nare threatened with reduction because of the 32-hour maximum.11 \n  The July 2011 Emergency Rule clearly represents a step in the right direction.  For the \nfirst time, some 100 class members will have an opportunity to access sufficient services to keep \nthem in their homes and communities without first having to enter a nursing home for their \ncare.12 However, it still leaves substantial numbers of class members at risk of deterioration and \ninstitutionalization while this case is being litigated. \n  Following the promulgation of the July 2011 Emergency Rule establishing a preference \non the EDA waiver waiting list for people on the LT-PCS program who need additional services \nto stay out of a nursing home, counsel for the Plaintiffs requested informal discovery on the \nimplementation of the Emergency Rule.13  They sent a letter containing questions to Defendants’ \ncounsel, and met with Assistant Secretary Hugh Eley, his assistant Rick Henley, and Defendants’ \ncounsel on July 13, 2011 to discuss the answers.     \n  Since then, Plaintiffs’ counsel communicated with Defendants’ counsel to get more \nspecific information on how the July 2011 Emergency Rule would be implemented.  \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs’ counsel sought information on how class members would be notified as \n                                                 \n11 Exhibit 1, Abadie Decl. ¶5. It is interesting to note that Defendants do not appear to have applied the \n32-hour maximum uniformly.  This maximum was supposed to take effect for individuals who were \nassessed after September 5, 2010.  Yet the data that Defendants supplied show that of almost 2,000 \nindividuals whose plans of care were implemented after December 1, 2010—three months after the Rule \ntook effect--over 400 were approved to receive more than 32 hours a week of LT-PCS. Abadie Decl. ¶¶8-\n9. Plaintiffs’ counsel has requested an explanation for this, but none has been provided.  \n \n12 Prior to the July 2011 Emergency Rule, the only groups that had priority for EDA waiver slots were \nindividuals with substantiated cases of abuse or neglect, who, absent EDA Waiver services, would \nrequire institutional placement to prevent further abuse and neglect; individuals diagnosed with \nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS); and individuals presently residing in nursing facilities for 90 or \nmore continuous days.

Doc. 38-4) p. 52, l. 6-15. \n \n13 Exhibit 2, Declaration of Nell Hahn (“Hahn Decl.”), ¶¶ 2-4. \n \n7 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 10 of 166\n\n \nto how to apply for an emergency waiver slot if they faced a risk of institutionalization if not \nprovided with more than 32 hours a week of LT-PCS; information as to whether LT-PCS would \nbe continued at current levels while emergency waiver applications were pending; and \ninformation as to whether only people whose reductions put them at exactly 32 hours would be \nable to apply for an emergency waiver slot.  Plaintiffs counsel also sought copies of forms, \nguidelines, fact sheets, instructions, and other documents that will be revised as a result of these \nchanges and all documents that will be used to implement the changes.14  Plaintiffs’ counsel also \nsought emergency EDA slots for the named plaintiffs and class members discussed in this \nMemorandum, through communications with defendant’s counsel.15 \n  Defendants’ counsel’s response to those inquiries16 shows that DHH will consider only an \nindividual for an emergency EDA waiver slot if he or she is currently approved for 32 hours per \nweek of LT-PCS.  Individuals approved for fewer than 32 hours must file an administrative \nappeal for the 32-hour maximum before DHH will consider them for emergency EDA slots. \n1,255 persons who had been receiving more than 32 hours a week prior to the implementation of \nthe cap have had their LT-PCS reduced to less than 32 hours.17   \n  Further, an Emergency Elderly and Disabled Adult Waiver Slot Process and Protocol \nattached to Defendants’ counsel’s response (“Process and Protocol”) makes it clear that only \npersons for whom a cut in services would necessitate an immediate admission to a nursing \nfacility will be granted waiver slots.  Persons who appear to meet the eligibility requirements for \nan emergency slot receive a home visit from Office of Aging and Adult Services Regional Office \n                                                 \n14 Id. ¶ 6. \n15 Id. ¶8. \n16 Id. ¶ 7 and Attachment C. \n17 Exhibit 1, Abadie Decl., ¶7.

Individuals who need additional services to avoid deterioration or risk of nursing \nhome placement, after the 100 slots set aside by the rule have been filled;19 \n2.  Individuals who need additional services to avoid deterioration or risk of nursing \nhome placement, whose hours of service have  been or will in the future be \nreduced pursuant to the September 5, 2010 rule, to fewer than 32 hours per week;  \n3.  Individuals who need more than 32 hours of LT-PCS a week, who are not able to \nremain  in  the  community  without  deterioration  while  their  applications  for \nemergency EDA slots are pending.  \n4.  Individuals who need more than 32 hours of LT-PCS a week for whom the lack of \nservices will likely cause a decline in health, safety, or welfare that will lead to \nthe  individual’s  eventual,  though  perhaps  not  immediate,  placement  in  an \ninstitution.        \nIV.   Class members’ needs for continued LT-PCS services above the cap \n  As noted above, Defendants have agreed to extend services temporarily for a number of \nclass members that Plaintiffs’ counsel have learned about and brought to the attention of \nDefendants’ counsel.  However, there is no reason to assume that all class members who need \n                                                 \n18 Exhibit 2, Hahn Decl.Attachment C, Process and Protocol, p. 2. \n19 At the meeting on July 13, 2011, Defendants indicated that they intended to set aside additional slots if \n \n9 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 12 of 166\n\n \nsuch extensions of their services have contacted Plaintiffs’ counsel.  The situations of the named \nplaintiffs, and of those class members who have come to the attention of Plaintiffs’ counsel, are \nlikely to be typical of numerous other class members. \n  Many class members who require more than 32 hours a week of LT-PCS to remain safely \nin their homes are currently receiving (or have been approved to receive) less than 32 hours a \nweek of LT-PCS.  Class members20 P.M., E.S., and C.D. (discussed below) exemplify their \nplight. According to the July 2011 Emergency Rule, they are not eligible to apply for an \nemergency EDA waiver slot.  \n  Class members who are approved for less than 32 hours of LT-PCS a week will not even \nbe notified of the availability of emergency waiver slots or permitted to apply.  In June 2011, \n1,255 people had already faced reductions to less than 32 hours of LT-PCS a week.21  It is \nunknown how many of them need more than 32 hours to reside in the community, and would \napply for emergency EDA waiver slots if they were told about them. \n  Named plaintiffs Kenneth Roman (discussed at pp. 6-7 of Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in \nOpposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, Rec. Doc. No. 36-1), Rickii Ainey \n(discussed at pp. 8-9 of Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment, Rec. Doc. No. 36-1), and Elizabeth Foster (discussed below) currently (and \ntemporarily) receive more than 32 hours of LT-PCS by agreement with Defendants’ counsel.\n  Many class members who are eligible to apply for emergency EDA waiver slots because \nthey are currently approved to receive 32 hours a week will not face immediate admission to a \n                                                                                                                                                            \nthe initial 100 were taken, but there is no assurance that this will take place.

They, or their families, will struggle to remain in their \nhomes and communities, and experience deterioration in health, safety, and welfare that will lead \nto their eventual institutionalization.  Preliminary injunctive relief is necessary to prevent this \nfrom happening.  V.U.S., I.M.L., S.M., and E.B. (discussed below) exemplify their plight. \nA.  Class members currently approved for less than 32 hours a week: \n1.  Class member P.M. \n  P.M. is 54 years old and lives with her husband in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  She and her \nhusband are both blind and have multiple disabilities.22  Mrs. M. has severe psoriasis and \npsoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, diabetes, and congestive heart \nfailure. Both of her knees have been replaced, and she has severe daily back spasms.23  Constant \npain in her knees, hands, shoulders, back, and ankles make it impossible for her to perform \nactivities of daily living independently.  She cannot stand for more than five minutes at a time, so \nis unable to cook or clean house.  She needs help for any task, like grooming, bathing, and even \ntoileting, which requires gripping objects with her hands. She needs assistance transferring in \nand out of bed and moving in bed, and transferring in and out of a chair.24 She uses a wheelchair \noutside the house, and cannot propel herself in the chair or use a cane to navigate when using the \nwheelchair.  She has incontinent episodes once or twice a day.  She needs assistance in cleaning \nand dressing after these episodes, and in doing the large volume of laundry this generates.25 She \nmust have assistance in bathing; having her food set out, cut up, and identified on her plate. 26 \nShe also needs assistance cooking, doing dishes, shopping, and labeling purchased items in \n                                                 \n22 Exhibit 3, Declaration of P.M.

He uses a wheelchair, and is unable to assist in \nhis wife’s care.28  \n  Mrs. M. is currently receiving 38 hours a week of LT-PCS.29  She believes if her LT-PCS \nis capped at 32 hours a week, both she and her husband are at risk of having to enter a nursing \nhome for care..  If Mrs. M. were to be institutionalized, they would no longer be able to afford \ntheir subsidized apartment, and it is likely that Mr. M. would also enter a nursing home. With \ntheir current hours of help, they are able to enjoy their home together and to participate in the \ncommunity by going to church, concerts, and restaurants.

He has treated Mrs. M. for two years.31  He states in his declaration \nthat Mrs. Marshall’s multiple medical conditions put her in a “precarious situation,” and that she \nneeds assistance in performing all personal care tasks and housekeeping.32  He states that the 38 \nhours of personal care assistance that she currently receives is the minimum necessary for her to \nreside safely in the community, and that a reduction to 32 hours a week will jeopardize her health \nand safety and place her at “significant risk” of having to enter a nursing facility, where her \n                                                                                                                                                            \n26 Id. at ¶¶15 – 16. \n27 Id. at ¶¶19 – 21. \n28 Id. at ¶4. \n29 Id. at ¶12. \n30 Id. at ¶¶22 – 24. \n31 Exhibit 4, Declaration of W.

She raised nine children.34  She now has arthritis and \ndiabetes, and weighs approximately 330 lbs. As a result of her arthritis, she loses her grip on \nitems such as a fork, a knife or a hairbrush.35  She must have assistance with grooming, because \nof her inability to grip items and her inability to raise her arms.  Often, she is unable to feed \nherself, and must be spoon fed.36  She is able to walk, but her balance is so poor that she uses a \nwheelchair when outside her house.  Because her house is too small for her to be able to use the \nwheelchair at home, she moves around her house by holding on to furniture or the walls, but she \nis constantly afraid of falling.37  She cannot get in and out of a chair without assistance, and has \ndifficulty moving around in bed.  She cannot get on and off the toilet without help, adjust her \nclothing, or clean herself independently when toileting.  She has incontinent episodes daily, and  \nneeds help bathing and dressing.38 She is unable to prepare meals, do her laundry or attend to \nhousehold chores.39  She must undertake all activities very slowly, because she any exertion \ncauses shortness of breath.40 \n  E.M.S.’s  LT-PCS hours were reduced from 38 hours a week to 32 hours a week in April \n                                                 \n33 Id. at ¶¶ 8-11. \n34 Exhibit 5, Declaration of E.M.S., ¶1. \n35 Id. ¶2. \n36 Id., ¶¶ 3, 12.  \n37 Id. ¶4. \n38 Id. ¶5. \n39 Id. ¶6. \n40 Id. ¶7. \n \n13 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 16 of 166\n\n \nof 2011.41  Her hours have since been temporarily restored to 38, by agreement with Defendants’ \ncounsel.

Her worker did \nnot have time to prepare her evening meal.42  Even with the 38 hours that she is currently getting, \nshe is not being cleaned properly.43  She feels that she is getting weaker, and believes she will \nhave to go into a nursing home if she does not get more help soon.44 \n3.

Rather than \nfind in her favor, the Administrative Law Judge told her to reapply for services, which she did.  \nHer June 2011 assessment correctly showed that she needs extensive assistance in the areas of \ntoileting, transferring, eating, bathing, dressing, locomotion, and personal hygiene.

She recommends that she \nreceive ten to twelve hours per day for optimal emotional and physical functioning.57 \n  C.D. did not appeal the level of services she was given in June of 2011.  She did not think \nthat her needs would be considered, and at any rate the amount of services she could receive on \nappeal, 32 hours a week, would still be inadequate.58  She was not told that there was a \npossibility that she could qualify for an emergency waiver slot if she appealed and received 32 \nhours a week.  She does not think she can continue living on her own with only 30 hours a week \nof care, and is considering going into a nursing home.59 \nB.

She cannot pick up a \nglass to drink, hold a fork or spoon to feed herself, adjust her clothing or clean herself after \ntoileting, get up from a chair or bed without great effort and pain, or bathe without assistance.  \nShe relies on her worker for meal preparation, housekeeping, and shopping.66  Her worker puts \nher to bed when she leaves at 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon, and because of her disabilities, she \noften remains in bed until the worker returns the following day at 9:00 a.m.67  If her LT-PCS \nhours are reduced below their current level, she very much fears that she will have to go into a \nnursing home for care.68 \n  Scharmaine Baker is an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse with a doctorate in nursing. \nShe is a Board-certified Family Nurse Practitioner who specializes in making home visits to care \n                                                                                                                                                            \n61 Id. ¶15. \n62 Id. ¶16.

She visits her once a month to \nmonitor her medications, prescribe home care therapies, and monitor her overall health with the \ngoal of keeping her out of the hospital.70  She states in her declaration that persons with the \ndegree of disability that I.M.L. has generally require at least six hours a day of personal care and \nhousekeeping assistance to avoid deterioration.71  She testifies that I.M.L.’s health will \ndeteriorate due to the consequences of having to spend too much time in bed, missing meals, and \nhaving to use her bedside commode.  She states that it is likely that I.M.L. will have to seek care \nin a nursing home if she does not have an adequate home care.72 \n2.  Class member V.U.S. \n  V.U.S. is 36 years old and has quadriplegia, as a result of injuries she received when she \nwas 25 years old and in medical school.  She has obtained a Masters in Public Health from \nTulane University since her injury, and until recently was working as a Clinical Research \nCoordinator at the Oschsner Foundation in New Orleans.73  Currently, she is looking for full-\ntime work and is working part-time for a medical laser company.74  She lives alone in New \nOrleans, but enjoys an active  life in the community, socializing in her home and her friends’ \nhomes, going to movies and out to dinner, and attending local festivals.75    \n  Because of her disabilities, V.U.S. must have assistance for all of her personal care \nactivities.

V.U.S. is able to care \nfor herself during the day, especially when she is working and co-workers can assist her.  Her \nworker returns in the evening.  The personal care worker’s evening chores, including preparing \ndinner, doing the dishes, doing housework and laundry, then putting V.U.S. to bed, take \napproximately three hours.  In addition, the worker must assist V.U.S. with shopping and \nerrands, which takes her two to three hours a week.77  \n  V.U.S. was notified in July of 2011 that her hours of LT-PCS will be reduced to 32 per \nweek.  The notice she received did not provide any information on how she could obtain an \nemergency waiver slot if she cannot make it on 32 hours a week.  She cannot.  Her worker \nsimply cannot provide her with the care she needs in 32 hours a week. Because of the likelihood \nthat she will miss meals, have to remain in bed or in her wheelchair for extended periods, and \nwill find it hard to maintain hygiene and grooming. She anticipates that she will have to move \ninto a nursing home if she has to face such a drastic cutback in hours.78  \n  Dr. Cherie Drez is a Board-certified internist in New Orleans who has treated V.U.S. for \nfour years.79  Her practice includes many people with spinal cord injuries, and she is familiar \n                                                                                                                                                            \n75 Id. ¶¶1, 15. \n76 Id. ¶13 \n77 Id. ¶¶3, 5-6. \n78 Id. ¶¶16-19.

When she was \nassessed after March 2009 (when the 42-hour cap went into effect), her hours were reduced to 38 \nper week.97  She is scheduled to be assessed in August, and if the 32 hour maximum were to be \napplied, she would only be able to get 32 hours a week.  She will not be able to remain in her \nhome with only 32 hours a week of help, because her family will not be able to provide the \nsupplemental care she needs.98  She desperately wants to remain at home with her daughter, who \n                                                 \n90 Id. ¶¶9-10. \n91 Id. ¶12. \n92 Id. ¶¶11,16. \n93 Id. ¶13. \n94 Id. ¶¶14-15. \n95 Id. ¶¶18-19. \n96 Id. ¶24. \n97 Id. ¶7. \n98 Id. ¶28. \n \n21 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 24 of 166\n\n \nis still young and still needs her mother, but knows that she will deteriorate and have to go into a \nnursing home for care if her hours are further reduced.99 \n  Daniel Renois, a Board-certified Family Practice physician has been treating S.M. for \napproximately three years.100  His declaration confirms her disabilities and her need for total \nassistance in areas personal care, including transfering, bathing, dressing, personal hygiene,  \nemptying her urinary catheter bag whenever needed, recognizing seizure activity, repositioning \nher, performing housework and shopping.101  He states that she needs at least the 38 hours of \npersonal care services that she receives now to remain safely in her home.

Landreth;140 Bluefield Water Ass’n v. \nCity of Starkville.141 \n  The grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is almost always based on an abbreviated \nset of facts, requiring a delicate balancing of the probability of ultimate success at final hearing \nwith the consequences of immediate irreparable injury that could flow from the denial of \npreliminary relief. Enter. Int’l, Inc. v. Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuadoriana;142 see also \n                                                 \n135 Id. ¶¶8-12. \n136 Exhibit 17, Declaration of Donna Zeno, ¶18. \n137 Id. ¶5. \n138 Id. ¶25; Exhibit 18, Declaration of Lisa Richards, M.D., ¶13.

Camenisch143 (a preliminary injunction is customarily granted on the basis of \nprocedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits. A \nparty thus is not required to prove his case in full at a preliminary-injunction hearing).   \n  In the instant case, the class raises a very strong likelihood of ultimate success on the \nmerits under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”),144 the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n(“Section 504\"),145 and their implementing regulations. This Court has already found, in \nconnection with Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, that the State’s system violates the \nADA by requiring a greater risk of institutionalization for people who require more than 32 \nhours a week of assistance.  The State has, in response, taken steps that will allow a small \nnumber of class members to avoid this risk.  However, because the Defendants’ new rule setting \naside only 100 emergency EDA waiver slots and is so limited both in size and in its applicable \ncriteria, it will not prevent irreparable injury to numerous class members. Both the balance of \nhardships and public interest weigh significantly in favor of the class. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are \nentitled to a preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to either:   \n  (a) Continue the services of class members whose services have not yet been reduced to \nthe 32-hour maximum at their current level, and to provide a mechanism for class members \nwhose services have already been reduced to obtain services in excess of the 32-hour cap; or, in \nthe alternative, \n  (b)  Expand the operation of the new rule making EDA waiver opportunities available \npersons subjected to Defendants’ cuts, in order to prevent irreparable harm to class pending trial \non the merits in this action, and to ensure that the process effectively and expeditiously provides \n                                                 \n143 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). \n144 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213. \n \n28 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 31 of 166\n\n \nthese waiver services. \n  To be effective, such expansion would have to include: \n(a)  Granting emergency waiver slots to individuals who need more than 32 hours a week \nof LT-PCS to avoid a decline in health, safety, or welfare that will lead to the \nindividual’s eventual, though perhaps not immediate, placement in an institution; \n(b)  For those class members who apply for emergency waiver slots whose services have \nnot yet been reduced, maintaining services at their current level until Defendants have \nacted on their applications;  \n(c)  For class members whose services have already been reduced, who apply for \nemergency waiver slots, restoring services to their previous level until Defendants \nhave acted on their applications; \n(d)  Notifying persons who have been approved for less than 32 hours a week of LT-PCS \nof the availability of emergency waiver slots and afford them an opportunity to apply \nfor them; and \n(e)  If the person is found to be in need of an emergency waiver slot, maintaining their \nLT-PCS hours at the level that they had prior to the application of the September 5, \n2010 rule until they begin to receive EDA waiver services. \nVI.  The Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act require \nDefendants to take all reasonable steps to avoid placing individuals at risk of \ninstitutionalization. \n \n  The parties and the United States Department of Justice have submitted extensive briefs \nin this case on the requirements of the ADA and Section 504.  This Court correctly held that “a \nState’s program violates the ADA if it creates the risk of segregation; neither present nor \n                                                                                                                                                            \n 145 29 U.S.C. § 794a. \n29 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 32 of 166\n\n \ninevitable segregation is required.”146  This holding has received additional support recently in a \ntechnical assistance guide promulgated by the Unites States Department of Justice to assist state \nand local governments to comply with the ADA.147 In that guide, the agency that Congress \ntasked with the responsibility of promulgating regulations to implement the ADA148 has \ninterpreted the Act and regulations to apply to persons, like the class members in this case, who \nare at risk of institutionalization.  The technical assistance guide states:   \nA plaintiff could show sufficient risk of institutionalization to make out an Olmstead \nviolation if a public entity’s failure to provide community services or its cut to such \nservices will likely cause a decline in health, safety, or welfare that would lead to the \nindividual’s eventual placement in an institution. (emphasis supplied). \n \n  According to the Justice Department, public entities have a duty to take all reasonable \nsteps to avoid placing individuals at risk of institutionalization “where budget cuts require the \nelimination or reduction of community services specifically designed for individuals who would \nbe institutionalized without such services.”  In such cases,  \nPublic entities may be required to make exceptions to the service reductions or to provide \nalternative services to individuals who would be forced into institutions as a result of the \ncuts  If providing alternative services, public entities must ensure that those services are \nactually available and that individuals can actually secure them to avoid \ninstitutionalization. (emphasis supplied). \n \n  Thus, the court in Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly149 stated: “..[T]o the extent that Defendants \nare claiming that alternative services satisfy their obligations under the integration mandate, \n                                                 \n146 Order on Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (Rec. Doc. No. 54) at 6 (citing Fisher v. \nOklahoma, 335 F.3d 1175, 1181 (10th Cir. 2003); Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, 656 F. Supp. 2d 1161, 1164 \n(N.D. Cal. 2009); M.A.C. v. Betit, 284 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1309 (D. Utah 2003); Makin v. Hawaii, 114 F. \nSupp. 2d 1017, 1034 (D. Haw. 1999)). \n147 http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm.  \n148 42 U.S.C. §12134(a). In Frame v. City of Arlington, __F.3d __, 2011 WL 4089778 (5th Cir., Sept. 15, \n2011, en banc) the Court noted at *4 that the views of the Department of Justice on the construction of the \nADA “warrant respect,” and may be entitled to more deference.  \n149 656 F. Supp. 2d 1161, 1174 (N.D. Cal. 2009), appeal docketed, No. 11-71801 (9th Cir. Jun. 27, 2011). \n \n30 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 33 of 166\n\n \nDefendants certainly bear the burden of ensuring more than a “theoretical” availability of such \nservices.” And in V.L. v. Wagner,150 the court enjoined change in eligibility standards that would \nreduce or terminate in-home personal care services, creating a risk of institutionalization for \npeople with disabilities, where the record demonstrated that alternative services would not be \navailable for a large portion of class members who face a risk of institutionalization. \nVII.  Plaintiffs need not demonstrate that they will be immediately institutionalized if \nadequate LT-PCS is not available. \n \nThe elimination of services that have enabled Plaintiffs to remain in the community \nviolates the ADA, regardless of whether it causes them to enter an institution immediately, or \nwhether it causes them to decline in health over time and eventually enter an institution to seek \nnecessary care. In Fisher,151 the Seventh Circuit found that Oklahoma’s policy of limiting \nprescriptions for persons living in the community, but not for persons living in nursing homes, \nviolated the ADA’s integration mandate, though there was no allegation that any of the plaintiffs \nwould be immediately institutionalized because of the limit. Rather, the evidence showed that \nmany of the plaintiffs would remain in their homes “until their health ha[d] deteriorated” and \nwould “eventually end up in a nursing home.”152   \nIn Hiltibran v. Levy,153 the court held that Missouri violated the integration mandate of \nthe ADA when it refused to provide incontinence briefs under its Medicaid state plan to adults \nresiding in the community. The court held that despite the plaintiffs’ ability thus far to pay for \nthe briefs themselves to avoid institutional placement, the plaintiffs were nonetheless likely at \n                                                 \n150 669 F. Supp. 2d. 1106, 1120 (N.D. Cal. 2009). \n151 335 F.3d 1175, 1185 (10th Cir. 2003). \n152 Id. (emphasis added). \n153 ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2011 WL 2534332 (W.D. Mo. June 24, 2011). \n \n31 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 34 of 166\n\n \nrisk of institutionalization because the cost of the briefs strained the plaintiffs’ already precarious \nfinancial situations, and caused them to go to great lengths to avoid institutionalization.154  \nIn Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, the court granted a preliminary injunction against cuts in \nAdult Day Health services, explicitly rejecting the defendants’ assertion that “in order to state a \nTitle II violation, Plaintiffs must show that the [State’s reduction in community-based services] \nleaves ‘no choice’ other than to be institutionalized . . .” The court held, instead, as has this \nCourt, that “the risk of institutionalization is sufficient.”155  See also V.L., supra,156 (concluding \nthat plaintiffs may establish a violation of the integration mandate by showing that the denial of \nservices could lead to an eventual “decline in health” that puts them at “risk [of] being placed in \na nursing home.”).  \nSimilarly, in Cruz v. Dudek,157 the district court found that although the plaintiffs resided \nin the community for multiple years without the services they sought, they were likely at risk of \ninstitutionalization due to the lack of sufficient community services.  \nVIII.   Plaintiffs’ requested modifications are reasonable. \n \n  It is well-established that the ADA and Section 504 both require Defendants to make \nreasonable modifications and accommodations to their policies, practices, and procedures when \nnecessary to avoid discrimination.158 In a reasonable accommodation and modification claim, it \nis the plaintiff’s obligation to articulate a modification that “seems reasonable on its face.” US \n                                                 \n154 Id. at *3, *7. \n155 656 F.

Barnett;159 see also Johnson v. Gambrinus Co./Spoetzl Brewery160 (plaintiff \nmeets his burden of proof “by introducing evidence that the requested modification is reasonable \nin the general sense, that is, reasonable in the run of cases”); Skerski v. Time Warner Cable \nCo.161 (“plaintiff bears only the burden of identifying an accommodation, the costs of which…do \nnot clearly exceed its benefits,” i.e., that is not “clearly ineffective or outlandishly costly”). If the \nplaintiff articulates a reasonable modification, then the burden shifts to the defendant to prove \nthat the proposed modification would impose an undue burden on its resources or a fundamental \nalteration of its program. Olmstead v. L.C.;162 Frederick L. v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare.163  \n  The reasonableness of a particular accommodation “depends on the individual \ncircumstances of each case” and “requires a fact-specific, individualized analysis of the disabled \nindividual’s circumstances and accommodations that might allow him to meet the program’s \nstandards.” Wong v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal.164   \n  The modifications that Plaintiffs request in the instant action are the minimum necessary \nto insure that class members are able to safely remain in their homes and communities.  There \nmust be exceptions to the blanket policy of capping LT-PCS hours at 32 per week that will \nenable class members to have an adequate amount of services.  Defendants have taken steps \ntoward recognizing and providing for this in the July 2011 Emergency Rule.  However, the \nemergency waiver slots offered as alternative services in Defendants’ July 2011 Emergency Rule \n                                                 \n159 535 U.S. 391, 401 (2002). \n160 116 F.3d 1052, 1059 (5th Cir. 1997) \n161 257 F.3d 273, 284 (3d Cir. 2001) \n162 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999) \n163 364 F.3d 487, 492 n.4 (3d Cir. 2004). \n164 192 F.3d 807, 818 (9th Cir. 1999).  \n \n \n33 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 36 of 166\n\n \nmust not simply be theoretically available.  Defendants must insure that they are “actually \navailable and that individuals can secure them to avoid institutionalization,” for whoever requires \nthese services. \n  First, given the fragility and extreme needs of persons who receive LT-PCS, and the large \nnumber of individuals whose services have been reduced, it is doubtful that 100 EDA slots will \nbe adequate to meet the needs of all individuals placed at risk by the reductions.  Second, \nalternative services will only prevent the risk of deterioration and institutionalization if they are \nmade available at a meaningful time—before the cuts that threaten to force class members into \nnursing homes, or threaten their health and safety, actually occur—or as soon as possible \nthereafter.  Requiring class members whose services have been reduced to less than 32 hours, but \nwho need more than 32 hours of services to avoid deterioration and institutionalization, to go \nthrough a lengthy administrative appeal process before even being able to apply for alternative \nservices, unreasonably limits the availability of the relief.  As set forth above in part VI, supra, \nthe standard for awarding an emergency EDA slot must be a showing that a class member will \nexperience a deterioration in health or safety that will require eventual instituitionalization, rather \nthan immediate admission to a nursing facility. And there must be adequate provision for \nmaintaining services until the emergency waiver services actually become available. \nIX. Irreparable Injury \nIn demonstrating the likelihood of irreparable harm, the moving party need only \n“establish that at the time of the injunction it was under a substantial [] threat of harm which \ncannot be undone [] through monetary remedies,” Spiegel v. City of Houston.165   \n  It is well established that the loss of Medicaid benefits constitutes irreparable harm.166 \n \n34 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 37 of 166\n\n \nIndeed, \"[t]he nature of [the] claim - a claim against the state for medical services - makes it \nimpossible to say that any remedy at law could compensate\" plaintiffs. McMillan v. \nMcCrimon167; see also Indep. Living Ctr. of S. Cal., Inc. v. Maxwell-Jolly168 (showing that \nMedicaid recipients would be denied needed medical care constituted irreparable harm); Me. \nAss'n of Interdependent Neighborhoods v. Petit169 (court found that absent the requested \ninjunction plaintiff would be forced to leave her family and enter a nursing home, irreparably \ninjuring her physical and mental health); accord, Kai v. Ross170 (denial of Medicaid benefits \nconstitutes a \"danger to plaintiffs' health, and perhaps even their lives\"); Mass. Ass'n of Older \nAms. v. Sharp171 (termination of benefits that causes individuals to forgo medical care is clearly \nirreparable harm); Beltran v. Meyers172 (irreparable injury is shown when enforcement of a \nMedicaid rule \"may deny [plaintiffs] needed medical care\"); Caldwell v. Blum173 (Medicaid \napplicants established harm where they would \"absent relief, be exposed to the hardship of being \ndenied essential medical benefits\"); Edmonds v. Levine174 (denial of medical benefits, and \nresulting loss of medical services, constitutes irreparable harm); Mitson v. Coler175 (potential \ndenial of nursing home service constituted irreparable injury since many in class would be \ndeprived of essential medical care). \n  In recent cases dealing with cuts to home- and community-based services similar to those \n                                                                                                                                                            \n165 636 F.2d 997, 1001 (5th Cir. 1981) (quoting Parks v.

Brantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, supra \n(preliminary injunction entered to prevent reduction of Medicaid Adult Day Health Care services \nfrom five to three days a week); V.L. v. Wagner, supra (injunction entered to halt change in \neligibility criteria that would reduce or terminate home- and community-based services to people \nwith disabilities); Ball v. Rodgers176 (State’s failure to provide personal care services needed by \npersons with disabilities to participate in everyday life activities, such as bathing, dressing, \ncleaning, and shopping, threatened Plaintiffs with institutionalization and justified injunctive \nrelief).  \n  If a preliminary injunction is not issued, class members will not be able to continue to \nlive at home. Their health will deteriorate, and they will have no option other than to eventually \nenter to a nursing home and suffer all the injuries listed in Olmstead. Such discrimination and \nirreparable injury are unnecessary. The irreparable injury includes more than a violation of civil \nrights under the ADA and Section 504. The irreparable injury is that class members will be \ninstitutionalized in a setting that demeans them by taking away their independence and dignity. \nX. Balance of Hardships \n  The Court must weigh the harm to class members against possible damage to Defendants. \nWhile class members are threatened with institutionalization, or with deteriorating health and \nlack of autonomy, Defendant will suffer no harm from providing the preliminary relief Plaintiffs \nare requesting.   \n                                                                                                                                                            \n175 670 F. Supp. 1568, 1577 (S.D. Fla. 1987). \n176 No. 00-67-TUC-EHC, 2009 WL 1395423 (D. Ariz. Apr. 24, 2009) \n \n36 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 39 of 166\n\n \n  By promulgating the July 2011 Emergency Rule, Defendants have already decided that \nalternative services in the form of emergency waiver slots can be extended to class members to \nallow them to avoid institutionalization.  Plaintiffs are simply seeking to insure that all class \nmembers have a fair opportunity to demonstrate their need for these services, and to obtain them \nif necessary.  It is not fair that only those class members whose services have been reduced to \nexactly 32 hours, or those who gotten special assistance from the Advocacy Center, should be \nable to request these services. Allowing all class members who are facing deterioration and \ninstitutionalization to apply for alternative services at a meaningful time and in a meaningful \nmanner, and presenting them with an opportunity to demonstrate that they need emergency \nservices, will harm no one. \n  On the other hand, hundreds of class members have already suffered service reductions.  \nMany, like E.M.S., C.D., and E.B., may be hanging on to their lives in their homes and \ncommunities by the most slender of threads.  They deserve the opportunity to qualify for \nemergency waiver services, if such services are going to be made available to others. \n  Finally, class members will continue to be at risk of institutionalization unless their \nservices are extended at current levels, or restored to previous levels, until emergency waiver \nservices actually become available.  This will entail an expense to Defendants, though until the \nnumber of class members is determined, the size of that expense is unknown.  However, it \nappears that Defendants have already made exceptions to the 32-hour maximum – not only by \nextending the services of the nine class members who are named plaintiffs or who have been \nbrought to their attention by Plaintiffs’ counsel, but for a substantial number of others.  As noted \n \n37 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 40 of 166\n\n \nabove,177 Defendants’ response to Interrogatory No. 2 of Plaintiffs’ First Set of Interrogatories \nindicates that almost 25% of the persons who were receiving more than 32 weekly hours of LT-\nPCS on September 5, 2010, who had new plans of care implemented after December 1, 2010, \nwere allocated more than 32 hours of LT-PCS, despite the supposed 32-hour maximum.178  \nAllowing class members who identify themselves as requiring services to avoid nursing home \nplacement to retain, or be restored, services above the 32-hour maximum on a temporary basis, \nwill not significantly raise costs to the State.  And, as this Court has pointed out, if these \nindividuals do enter nursing facilities as the result of the reductions, the State will incur even \nlarger expenses for their care in nursing homes.   \n  The harm to class members here clearly outweighs any harm to Defendants. See, e.g., \nBrantley v. Maxwell-Jolly, supra; Edmonds v. Levine179 (harm to plaintiffs of being deprived of \nessential medical services outweighs any harm to state); Ill. Hosp. Ass'n v. Ill. Dep’t of Pub. \nAid180 (\"once a state has voluntarily elected to participate in the Medicaid program . . . [it cannot] \ncharacterize its duty to comply with the requirements of [the program] as constituting a hardship \nto its citizens\"); Kan. Hosp. Ass'n v. Whiteman181 (threatened injuries to plaintiffs outweighed \nany harm to defendant that would result from issuing the temporary restraining order because \nchanging Medicaid coverage \"significantly alters the status quo to the detriment of the individual \nplaintiffs, while its positive budgetary impact on state coffers is negligible in a relative sense\"). \n  The balance of hardships clearly favors class members in this case. Providing the \nrequested accommodations falls squarely within the duties imposed upon Defendants by the \n                                                 \n177 See note 11, supra. \n178 Exhibit 1, Abadie Decl. ¶9. \n179 417 F.

Denying the accommodations will \nrisk class members’ institutionalization, despite the fact that they have successfully resided in the \ncommunity.  Their medical practitioners have sworn that this will result in less effective health \nand medical care, and will generally jeopardize their health.182  In addition, institutionalization \nthreatens the independence, community involvement, relationships, and personal autonomy that \nclass members enjoy. \nXI.  The Public Interest \n  A preliminary injunction to provide services to class members to avoid \ninstitutionalization is not adverse to the public interest. In determining whether the public interest \nwill be disserved by the granting of a request for preliminary injunction, courts may look to the \nlegislative intent in enacting the statute sought to be enforced. Cost to the government “alone” is \nnot a reason to deny a preliminary injunction as being against the public interest. See, e.g., \nJohnson v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.183  In that case, in which borrowers challenged government \nforeclosure procedures, the court looked at the legislative purposes of the Housing Act of 1949 \nand found that the public interest of providing decent housing would be served by preventing \npremature foreclosures. See also Camacho v. Texas Workforce Com'n184  (Public interest will be \nserved by enjoining state rules and allowing Plaintiffs to continue receiving Medicaid assistance-\nbenefits; State budgetary savings does not justify denial of injunction); Newton-Nations v. \nRogers185 (Public interest favored a preliminary injunction sought by state Medicaid \nbeneficiaries against the enforcement of a rule that required Medicaid beneficiaries to pay \n                                                                                                                                                            \n181 835 F. Supp. 1548, 1552-53 (D. Kan. 1993) \n182 See Exhibits 4, 8, 10, 12, and 14. \n183 734 F.2d 774 (11th Cir. 1984). \n184 326 F.Supp.2d 794 (W.D.Tex. 2004). \n \n39 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 42 of 166\n\n \ncopayments purportedly in excess of amounts authorized under federal law). \n  The public interest also will be served by an order granting a preliminary injunction for \nthe class. There is a strong public policy expressed in the ADA and Section 504. Congress found \nthat discrimination against people with disabilities is a serious and pervasive social problem, and \nthat people with disabilities have been subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment and \nrelegated to a position of political powerlessness based on characteristics that are beyond the \ncontrol of such individuals and resulting from stereotypical assumptions not truly indicative of \nthe individual ability of such persons to participate in and contribute to society.186  \n  As the en banc Fifth Circuit recently observed in Frame v. City of Arlington,187 the \npurpose of the ADA’s passage was to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate “to \neliminate discrimination against disabled individuals, and to integrate them into the economic \nand social mainstream of American life.”  The Frame court noted that “Title II does not only \nbenefit individuals with disabilities.  Congress recognized that isolating disabled individuals \nfrom the social and economic mainstream imposes tremendous costs on society,” including \n“billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and nonproductivity.”188 \nAccordingly, it serves the public interest to issue the requested preliminary injunctive relief. \nXII.   Waiving the Bond Requirement \n  Plaintiffs should be exempted from the bond requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). The \namount of required security is with in the discretion of the trial court, and the court may elect to \n                                                                                                                                                            \n185 316 F. Supp. 3d 883 (D. Az. 2004). \n186 42 U.S.C. §12101. \n187 __ F. 3d __, 2011 WL 4089778 at *3, *8 (5th Cir., Sept. 15, 2011, en banc). \n188 Id. *8. \n \n40 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 43 of 166\n\n \nrequire no security at all.189  \n  Persons suing individually, or as a class, to obtain access to public benefits, ordinarily are \nnot required to post bond for an injunction under Rule 65(c).  See, e.g., Doe v. Perales190 (bond \nnot required of nursing home residents prior to injunction precluding changes in Medicaid \nprogram that have the effect of reducing the amount of exempt resources available to certain \nrecipients); Montoya v. Johnston191 (injunction against $50,000 cap on payments under Medicaid \nprogram for inpatient hospital expenses issued without bond); Bartels v. Biernat192; Bass v. \nRichardson193 (\"It is clear. . .that indigents, suing individually or as class plaintiffs, ordinarily \nshould not be required to post a bond under Rule 65(c)”), discussed at 11A Charles Alan Wright \n& Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §2954 (2d ed. 1987).  \n  The class seeks injunctive relief to receive services in the community that Defendants \nalready provide in nursing homes. The case implicates the public interest, and the balance of \nhardships tips sharply in favor of the Plaintiffs. This Court should not require Plaintiffs to give \nsecurity. \nXIII.   Conclusion \n  For the reasons and on the authority cited above, Plaintiffs respectfully requests that this \nHonorable Court grant preliminary injunctive relief to the class. They have demonstrated a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits; that they will suffer irreparable injury in the event \nemergency relief is denied; and that the balance of hardships tip in their favor. \nDated September  27, 2011. \n                                                 \n189 Kaepa, Inc. v.

I have been employed as the Compliance Specialist in the New Orleans, Louisiana \noffice of the Advocacy Center since May of 2002.  \n2.  I have reviewed the Excel Spreadsheet entitled “Master Spreadsheet—Interrogatory \nNo. 2” that was provided to the Advocacy Center on July 11, 2011 in response to \nInterrogatory No. 2 of Plaintiffs’ First Set of Interrogatories.   \n3.  This spreadsheet included information on individuals who were approved to receive \nmore than 32 hours a week of LT-PCS prior to the application of the September 5, \n2010 reduction.   \n4.  The spreadsheet shows that 1,567 persons who had had more than 32 hours a week of \nLT-PCS on September 5, 2010, had been reduced to 32 or fewer hours a week as of \nJune 15, 2011. I obtained this number by totaling the number of people who had a \nnumber greater than 32 in column X (“Weekly Units on Sept 5, 2010”) and a number \nless than or equal to 32 in column Y (“Weekly Units on June 15, 2011”). \n5.  The spreadsheet shows that 1,991 people were receiving more than 32 hours a week \nof services on June 15, 2011. I obtained this number by totaling the number of people \nwho had a number greater than 32 in column Y. \n6.  The spreadsheet shows that of the 1,567 persons who were receiving more than 32 \nhours a week on September 5, 2010, and whose authorized services had been reduced, \nonly 312 were approved to receive exactly 32 hours a week of LT-PCS as of June 15, \n2011. I obtained this number by totaling the number of people who had a number \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 47 of 166\n\ngreater than 32 in column X and 32 in column Y. \n7.  The spreadsheet shows that of the 1,567 persons who were receiving more than 32 \nhours a week on September 5, 2010, and whose authorized services had been reduced, \n1,255 were approved to receive less than 32 hours a week of LT-PCS as of June 15, \n2011. I obtained this number by totaling the number of people who had a number \ngreater than 32 in column X and a number less than 32 in column Y. \n8.  I counted the number of individuals for whom the date in the column Z, headed “PA \nbegin for Plans of Care that span June 15, 2011” was after December 1, 2010.  It was \nmy understanding that these were individuals who were receiving LT-PCS as of June \n11, 2011, whose plans of care were implemented after December 1, 2010. \n9.  The spreadsheet shows that a total of 400 individuals were receiving more than 32 \nhours a week of LT-PCS services as of June 15, 2011, under plans of care that were \nimplemented after December 1, 2010. I obtained this number by totaling the number \nof people who had a number greater than 32 in column Y and a date after 12/1/10 in \ncolumn Z.  This represents 23% of the all the people whose plans of care were \napproved after 12/1/10 (1,739 people had a date after 12/1/10 in column Z and were \nreceiving LT-PCS as of June 15, 2011).  \n10. I speak with the named plaintiffs and the class members discussed in Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction periodically. Since their declarations were signed, \nclass members I.M.L. and V.U.S. have been offered emergency EDA waiver slots.  \nClass member E.B. has been assessed for an emergency EDA waiver slot, since his \nmother, L.M., signed her declaration and named plaintiff Elizabeth Foster has been \ncontacted for an appointment for an assessment, since her daughter, Donna Zeno, \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 48 of 166\n\nsigned her declaration.

I sent the letter attached hereto as Attachment A to counsel for Defendants \non June 29, 2011. \n  3.  Defendants’ counsel responded to my letter of June 29 via email, stating \nthat a meeting would be the best way of answering the questions it posed. \n  4.  Jeanne Abadie and I met with Hugh Eley, Assistant Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Hospitals (“DHH”) for Aging and Adult Services; Rick \nHenley, his deputy; Charles Daspit, counsel for DHH; and Matthew Berns, counsel for \nDHH (by phone) at DHH offices on July 13, 2011 and obtained DHH’s answers to the \nquestions in the letter. \n5.  At the meeting on July 13, 2011, Mr. Eley indicated that he intends to set \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 51 of 166\n\naside additional slots if the initial 100 were taken, but there is nothing in the Emergency \nRule to assure that this will take place. \n  6.   Following that meeting, I sent the email attached hereto as Attachment B \nto Defendants’ counsel, to get more specific information on how the July 2011 \nEmergency Rule would be implemented.  I again sought copies of forms, guidelines, fact \nsheets, instructions, and other documents that will be revised as a result of these changes \nand all documents that will be used to implement the changes. \n  7.    Defendants’ response to this inquiry is attached hereto as Attachment C. \n  8.  After I learned about the availability of emergency EDA waiver slots \nthrough the July 2011 Emergency Rule, I requested emergency EDA slots for the named \nplaintiffs and the class members discussed in Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction through Defendants’ counsel. \n \n  9/21/11          /s/ Nell Hahn         \nDate            Nell Hahn \n \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 52 of 166\n\nAttachment A\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 53 of 166\n\n \n \n \n \n \nVia email \n \n            June 29, 2011 \n \nKimberly L.

Greenstein et al., No. 3:10-cv-00635 in the U.S. District Court for the \nMiddle District of Louisiana \n \nDear Counsel: \n \n   As I mentioned on the phone with Judge Riedlinger, we would like some \ninformation on the meaning and implementation of the recent Emergency Rule changing \nDHH EDA waiver waiting list priorities.  We would like to start by getting this \ninformation informally.  I had called Caroline to start this process, but, in an email, Matt \nasked that I send our questions in writing.  Here are some of our questions: \n \n1.  Regarding the change in the priority given nursing home residents for an EDA slot: \n \n(a)  How will DHH identify “individuals admitted to a nursing facility who are \napproved for a stay of more than 90 days” on the waiting list so that they can be \noffered a waiver slot? \n \n(b)  Does there have to be an approval that explicitly says that it extends for more than \n90 days, or will the person qualify so long as approval is not explicitly limited to \nless than 90 days? \n \n(c)  How will DHH publicize this change to people who are on the waiting list? \n \n \nVoice 337-237-7380 •• TDD 1-866-935-7348 • Fax 337-237-0486 • Toll Free 1-800-822-0210 • \nwww.advocacyla.org \n600 Jefferson Street • Suite 812 • Lafayette, Louisiana 70501 \nThe Protection and Advocacy System for Louisiana \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 54 of 166\n\nKimberly Humbles \nCaroline Brown \nMatt Berns \nJune 29, 2011 \nPage 2 \n \n(d)  How many people on the EDA list are currently admitted to nursing facilities, and \nhow long have they been residing there?  How many are approved for stays of \nmore than 90 days?  How many are not approved for more than 90 day stays and \nhow long are they approved for? \n \n(e)  How will DHH identify individuals who are initially approved for a stay of less \nthan 90 days but who later receive one or more extensions that result in a nursing \nhome stay of more than 90 days?  Will such persons receive priority for an EDA \nwaiver slot? \n \n(f)  What are the current criteria for determining the approved length of stay in a \nnursing home? Who is responsible for making this determination? Since what \ndate have the current criteria been in effect, and, if these were changed in the last \nfew years, what were the previous criteria?  What changes, if any, do you \nanticipate to these criteria? \n \n \n2.  Regarding the 100 waiver slots that “may” be available to persons who require \nemergency waiver services: \n \n(a)  How did the Department decide on the number 100?  What analysis was done to \narrive at this number? \n \n(b)  If a person who has been given one of these emergency waiver opportunities \nleaves the waiver, will their slot be held open as an emergency waiver slot for \nsomeone else who meets the criteria in this rule?  For how long will these slots be \nmade available in this way, and how will it be decided how long they will be \nmade available? \n \n(c)  Will there be a corresponding increase in the total number of EDA waiver slots, \nor will the use of these 100 slots for LT-PCS recipients result in a longer wait for \nothers who are on the EDA waiting list? \n \n(d)  What does “may” mean in the following context:  \"Notwithstanding the priority \ngroup provisions, up to 100 EDA Waiver opportunities may be granted to \nqualified individuals...\"?  Does it mean that it is not definite that an EDA waiver \nopportunity will be available to a person who requires emergency services?  If it \nis definite, why is the word “may” used, instead of the word “shall”? \n \n(e)  How will DHH identify individuals who require emergency waiver services under \nthis provision? \n \n(f)  How will DHH publicize this change to people on the waiting list?  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 55 of 166\n\nKimberly Humbles \nCaroline Brown \nMatt Berns \nJune 29, 2011 \nPage 3 \n \n \n(g)  How will DHH publicize information about the availability of these slots to \npeople who are receiving, or have received, cuts in their LT-PCS? \n \n(h)  What does this mean: “To be considered for an emergency waiver opportunity, \nthe individual must currently receive the maximum amount of services allowable \nunder the Long Term Personal Care Services Program”?  \n  \n•  Does the person have to be receiving 32 or more hours of services?   \n•  What if they have been evaluated since September 2010 and are receiving less \nthan 32 hours of services?  \n•  Do they have to have appealed for the maximum amount of services and won \nthe appeal in order to get one of the waiver slots? \n•  What if they are not currently receiving any services (e.g., they are a new \napplicant for LT-PCS)?  \n \n(i)  How will DHH determine if the person will require institutional placement unless \noffered an emergency waiver slot? \n \n(j)  What will happen if more than 100 people who need more than 32 hours of LT-\nPCS are identified? \n \n(k)  Are any other criteria, besides those listed in §8105(E)(2) to be considered in \ndetermining whether or not to grant an emergency waiver slot, or is (E)(2) an \nexclusive list? \n \n(l)  Who will make the decision as to whether or not a person will be granted an \nemergency waiver slot?  What will the application process consist of?   \n \n(m)  Please provide a sample notice that will be given to a person who is denied an \nemergency waiver slot, advising him or his or her right to appeal the denial. \n \n3.  Has DHH sought CMS approval for these changes?  If so, please provide copies of all \ndocuments related to that submittal (including, but not limited to, the requested \namendment and any correspondence to or from CMS).  If DHH has not sought CMS \napproval, why has it not done so? \n \n4.  Please provide us with copies of forms, guidelines, fact sheets, instructions, and other \ndocuments that will be revised as a result of these changes and all documents that will be \nused to implement the changes.   \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 56 of 166\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 57 of 166\n\nAttachment B\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 58 of 166\n\nAdvocacy Center Mail - Requested stipulations in Roman v.

The defendants are prepared to agree to the following alternative\nstipulations, which more accurately characterize DHH's current thinking regarding the emergency slots.\n1. Beginning on August 3, DHH began enclosing information about the availability of emergency EDA slots\nwith the letters sent to people approved for 32 hours per week of LT-PCS following an assessment or\nreassessment. (Individuals in Region 2 began receiving the materials at an earlier date.)  DHH will\nretroactively notify individuals whose 32-hour plan began on or after July 1, the effective date of the rule\ncreating the emergency slots.  DHH is currently evaluating when and how to inform other individuals who\nmay be eligible for consideration for emergency slots.\n2. DHH is determining on a case-by-case basis whether to maintain the current level of LT-PCS hours for\nindividuals who are requesting more than 32 hours per week of LT-PCS.  To date, DHH has continued to\nmaintain the current level of services for all individuals identified by Plaintiffs as at risk of institutionalization\nif their hours are reduced.\n3. As stated in the rules governing emergency slots, DHH will consider an individual for an emergency EDA\nwaiver slot if he or she is currently approved for 32 hours per week of LT-PCS.  Individuals approved for\nfewer than 32 hours must exercise their option to appeal for more LT-PCS hours before DHH will consider\nthem for emergency EDA slots.\n4. DHH will provide individualized notice of the availability of emergency EDA slots to individuals approved\nfor 32 hours per week of LT-PCS. Individuals approved for fewer than 32 hours will continue to be notified\nof their right to appeal for up to 32 hours by demonstrating that there was an error in the assessment or\nthat they need additional services to avoid entering a nursing home.\nBest,\nMatt Berns\nFrom: Nell Hahn [mailto:nhahn@advocacyla.org]\nSent: Wednesday, August 10, 2011 6:42 PM\nTo: Berns, Matthew; Brown, Caroline; Kimberly.Humbles@la.gov\nCc: Bruce Vignery; Jeanne Abadie; Kenneth Zeller; SteveGoldADA@cs.com; Susan Meyers\nSubject: Requested stipulations in Roman v.

To be considered for an \nemergency waiver slot, the individual must currently receive the maximum amount of \nservices allowable under the Long Term Personal Care Services (LT-PCS) Program and \nrequire institutional placement, unless offered an emergency waiver slot.  The following \ndetails the procedures that the Office of Aging and Adult Services (OAAS) and OAAS-\ncontracted staff shall follow when these requests are received.\nREQUESTS FOR EMERGENCY WAIVER SLOTS\nRequests for emergency EDA Waiver slots may be made to OAAS Help Line at \n1-866-758-5035.  However, it is likely that other OAAS staff or OAAS-contracted \nstaff will be contacted with requests for EDA Emergency Waiver slots.  In response, \nOAAS or OAAS-contracted staff shall state the following when these requests are \nreceived:\n“There are emergency EDA Waiver slots available for persons who get \nLT-PCS if certain requirements are met.   Let me get some information \nfrom you and someone will be in touch with you on what to do next.” \nOAAS or OAAS-contracted staff shall obtain the following information: \nName of person requesting an EDA Waiver Emergency Slot, and, if applicable, the name \nof their responsible representative;\nAddress; \nTelephone Number; and\nDate of Birth. \nDate and time the person contacted OAAS or the OAAS contractor.\nOnce this information is obtained, it should be forwarded to the OAAS Help Line \nstaff.\nREQUEST PROCESSING\nOnce information regarding the emergency EDA Waiver slot request is received, \nOAAS Help Line staff will log in the request and determine if:\nthe person requesting an emergency EDA Waiver Slot is currently receiving LT-PCS; \nwhether or not the person is approved to receive the LT-PCS weekly program maximum \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 64 of 166\n\namount of 32 hours per week; \nwhether or not the person has been reassessed under the ADL Index Service Hour  \nAllocation of Resources methodology; and\nwhether  or  not  the  person  receives  services  through  any  other  DHH  program  (for \nexample, ADHC, PACE, or Supports Waiver).  \nIf the person is not currently receiving LT-PCS, OAAS Help Line staff will call the \nperson and tell them how to apply for services.  \nIf the person is currently receiving LT-PCS, but has not been approved to receive 32 \nhours  a  week  under  the  ADL  Index  Service  Hour  Allocation  of  Resources \nmethodology and/or exhausted all administrative appellate relief, OAAS Help Line \nstaff shall call the person.   OAAS Help Line Staff shall explain that in order to \nrequest an emergency EDA Waiver slot, the person must have been reassessed on or \nafter September 5, 2010 and have been approved to receive the LT-PCS maximum \namount of 32 hours per week.  OAAS Help Line Staff shall also assist the person in \nthe appeal process (if applicable).  \nIf the person is currently receiving 32 or more hours per week of LT-PCS and they \nhave not been reassessed since September 5, 2010, OAAS Help Line staff shall \nadvise that they have to be reassessed before they can apply for an emergency slot. \nOAAS Help Line staff shall also assist the person in determining if there are any \nother programs or assistance that may be available.  \nIf the person is currently receiving LT-PCS and has been approved to receive the LT-\nPCS maximum of 32 hours per week, the OAAS Helpline Staff shall refer the \nrequest via email to the person’s OAAS Regional Office of residence for a home \nvisit.   \nHOME VISIT\nOnce OAAS Regional Office staff receives the request, they shall call the person to set \nup a home visit within five (5) days of receiving the request.  Prior to the home visit, \nOAAS Regional Office staff shall review the current Minimum Data Set-Home Care \nassessment as well as any other relevant information or documentation concerning the \nparticipant.  \nThe purpose of the home visit is to determine if the individual can establish that additional \nservices are necessary to prevent immediate admission to a nursing facility.  During the \nhome visit, Regional Office staff should introduce themselves and explain the purpose of \ntheir  visit.    While  at  the  home,  Regional  Office  staff  should  be  cognizant  of  any \ninformation/observations that may show a need for immediate institutional placement and \nwhether there may be additional resources that may be able to assist the person.  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 65 of 166\n\nIssues to consider during the home visit include, but are not limited to:\nIs the person getting all the LT-PCS services they are approved for, i.e., are the direct \nservice workers actually providing the full 32 hours a week of service?\nAre services being provided as authorized in the Plan of Care, i.e., are the direct service \nworkers performing the tasks set forth on the Plan of Care in accordance with the \npersons’ wishes? \nHas the person applied for admission to a nursing home?\nIs the person getting any other formal services besides LT-PCS and if so, is additional \nassistance available from those services?  If not, why not?\nAre the services the person is getting through different programs being combined in the \nmost efficient manner?\nWas the person previously getting service(s) from other programs, and if so, why are \nthey no longer getting those services?  Can those services be reinstated?\nIs the person getting any informal help from family or friends?\nWas the person previously getting informal help from family or friends, and if so, why \nare they no longer getting informal help?  Are other sources of informal help available?\nDoes the person live alone?\nHave they applied for any other services?\nAre there alternatives to providing additional personal care services, such as changes to \nthe person’s medications or providing technological support that could help the individual \navoid a nursing home?\nWill the provision of additional personal care services address the issue/condition that the \nparticipant/responsible representative cite as the reason(s) driving the participant towards \nimmediate nursing facility placement (e.g., “need 24-hour care”, require nursing services \nnot provided by LT-PCS or EDA waiver services)?\nRegional Office staff shall also provide the person with information about, and offer \nassistance in applying for, services other than LT-PCS and EDA -- including but not \nlimited to ADHC, PACE, Home Health, and Supports Waiver.\nSERVICE REVIEW PANEL \nThe result of the home visit shall be documented immediately upon completion, and the \nRegional Office staff shall refer the request to the Service Review Panel via OAAS-\nIF-08-004.  The form should be sent via email to the Regional Office Supervisor and \nDHH Legal.  The form should be marked “Urgent Review”.  Regional Office staff shall \nclearly document their findings on the Service Review Panel form, but not make a \nrecommendation. \nOnce the documentation is received and the Service Review Panel convenes, a final \ndecision shall be made on the person’s request for an emergency EDA Waiver slot.  The \nService Review Panel shall consider the following criteria in determining whether or not \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 66 of 166\n\nto grant an emergency waiver opportunity:\n(1) Based on the experience and expertise of the Service Review Panel, the applicant \nwill require admission to a nursing facility unless offered an emergency waiver \nopportunity; and\n(2) a. support through other programs is either unavailable or inadequate;\nb. the death or incapacitation of an informal caregiver leaves the person \nwithout other supports;\nc. the support from an informal caregiver is not available due to a family \ncrisis; or\nd. the person lives alone and has no access to informal support.\nDECISION\nIf  the  Service  Review  Panel  determines  that  an  emergency  EDA  Waiver  slot  is \nappropriate, the person shall be notified via telephone of the decision as well as what they \ncan expect regarding their application for EDA Waiver services.  OAAS staff shall also \ncontact the data management contractor and instruct that an emergency EDA Waiver slot \noffer be made.  \nIf the Service Review Panel determines that an emergency EDA Waiver slot is not \nappropriate, the person shall be sent a letter advising of the Service Review Panel’s \ndecision.  \n For purposes of determining whether or not an emergency EDA Waiver slot should be granted, the \nService Review Panel may also include stakeholders.\nOffice of Aging and Adult Services                                 Emergency Elderly and \nDisabled Adult                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                            Waiver Slot Process and \nProtocol\nIssued August 4, 2011\nOAAS-ADM-11-018\nPage  PAGE 1 of 4\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 67 of 166\n\nDate:\nDear __________________________: \n \nYou have been approved to receive 32 hours per week of Long-Term \nPersonal Care Services (LT-PCS).

Document 75     09/28/11   Page 78 of 166\n\nDECLARATION OF P.M. \nP.M. subscribes under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, as follows: \n1.  My name is P.M.. I am 54 years old.  I was born in Ascension parish and have lived in \nthe Baton Rouge area most of my life.  \n2.  I went to kindergarten through high school at the Louisiana School for the Blind and \ngraduated in 1976.  I went to Louisiana State University and earned a Bachelors of Arts \ndegree in Social Studies with a secondary degree in education.  After college, I worked as a \nparaprofessional for the Ascension Parish Public School System from 1980-1992. \n3.  I am married to D.M.  We were married in 1992.   We have no children.  After our \nmarriage, we moved often in Louisiana for my husband’s employment until we, finally, \nsettled in Baton Rouge in 2009.    \n4.  My husband is blind and has avascular necrosis, arthritis and diabetes.  The avascular \nnecrosis has affected my husbands hips in such a drastic way that he must now use a \nwheelchair. My husband needs assistance with bed mobility, toileting, transferring and \nbathing.  He cannot do laundry, perform household chores or prepare meals. He cannot assist \nme with my personal care needs because he does not have the strength, and I cannot assist \nhim because of my own disabilities. My husband also receives Long-term Personal Care \nServices.  All of my husband’s family members live out of state and cannot assist either of us \nwith our care. \n5.  I attempted to find work after I was married but couldn’t.  I believe that one of the \nreasons that I could not find a job was because the school system did not want to hire a \nteacher or even a paraprofessional who is blind. \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 79 of 166\n\n6.  My mother and father are deceased.  I have two siblings, a sister who is twenty years \nolder than me and a brother who is seventeen years older than me.  My sister lives in \nAscension parish.  We speak daily, but she does not understand my disabilities and believes I \nam contagious.  My brother and I have not spoken in years. \n7.  I have congenital blindness.  I also have several physical disabilities that make it \nimpossible for me to care for myself.  I have severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, for which \nI received IV therapy at home for about one month.  The IV therapy required that a nurse \ncome to my home daily to administer the medication and check the IV apparatus. The IV \ntherapy ended on June 2, 2011.   In addition, I have osteoarthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, \nasthma, diabetes, and was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure.  In 1999, I had \ntwo knee replacements, which seem to be wearing down. Although I am unsure what causes \nit, I have recently started having back spasms, which cause severe pain, daily.  \n8.  Both forms of arthritis that I have cause me to have pain on a constant basis in my \nhands, knees, shoulders, back and ankles and make it impossible for me to perform many of \nmy activities of daily living independently. Due to the significant pain, I cannot stand in one \nplace for more than five minutes, or I will incur excruciating pain in my legs and back. This \nprevents me from cooking and cleaning.  Due to the arthritis in my hands I cannot grip things \nsuch as a hairbrush, washcloth or even toilet paper.  I need help with all of these tasks.  I can \nusually get myself into bed, but often I need help getting my legs into the bed.  Once in bed, I \nneed someone to move my legs for me.  I need assistance to get in and out of a chair.  \n9.  I lose my balance one to two times each week when walking in my home.  The personal \ncare worker will have to rush over and steady me.  Luckily this hasn’t happened when the \npersonal care worker wasn’t there. \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 80 of 166\n\n10.  In addition, my asthma and congestive heart failure cause me to become breathless \nwhenever I exert myself, so I must do everything slowly, and sometimes I must stop and wait \nbefore continuing, so I can catch my breath.  I cannot move quickly.  If I try to rush to get out \nof the house for an appointment, I only cause myself further delay because I have to sit down \nuntil my breathing returns to normal. \n11.  I am eligible for and receive Medicaid.  I also receive $388 each month from \nSupplemental Security Income and $255 each month from Social Security Disability \nInsurance. \n12.  I receive 38 hours of long-term personal care services. I began receiving these services \nin 2009.  My personal care worker provides me assistance with bed mobility, transferring, \ntoileting, bathing, dressing, personal hygiene and ambulating outdoors. I must use a \nwheelchair whenever I am outside of the house, and I cannot push the wheelchair for myself.  \nI do not have the strength and if I did, I could not push the wheelchair and use a white-tip \ncane. \n13.  Since being diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure, my doctor has prescribed Lasix.  \nI, now, have a bedside commode, but still have incontinent episodes one to two times daily.  \nSometimes I have accidents because I move too slowly to reach the toilet.  However, I also \nhave a damaged bladder, which has lessened the sensation of when I have to urinate, so, at \ntimes, I do not even realize that I have to use the toilet until it is too late. \n14.  After the incontinent episodes, I need help cleaning myself and getting dressed, again.  \nMy incontinence also creates an extraordinary amount of laundry, so my direct service \nworker must do laundry daily. \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 81 of 166\n\n15.  I need help reaching all of my body when I bathe and my worker must bathe me.   To \nbathe, I have a seat in my shower.  My personal care worker must help me to get on and off \nthe shower seat. \n16.  I can eat independently, but I need my food set out for me, and I need information \nabout what is on my plate and where the food is located.  I also need my meat cut for me, \nbecause I cannot grip a knife. \n17.  Due to my arthritis, I am in constant pain and I believe it takes me longer to finish tasks \nbecause of the pain.  For example, because of my psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, I cannot do \ndishes.  I have difficulty gripping the dishes, but also if I do the dishes it makes the sores \nfrom psoriasis bleed and become painful. \n18.  Although I am not sure what to attribute it to, I also have lost my stamina.  I do not \nhave the energy needed to do many of things that I could once do for myself. \n19.  I also need assistance cooking.  I cannot stand to cook, but also have difficulty cooking \ndue to my visual impairment.  I can help with recipes, but cannot actually prepare the meal. \n20.  I can make a grocery list for my personal care worker.  But, if I actually do the \nshopping it takes many hours.  Someone has to read each label to me, so that I can cost \ncompare and know exactly what I am buying.  Due to my physical disabilities, it is difficult \nfor me to maneuver in the grocery store. \n21.  Once my personal care worker returns to my home with groceries, everything has to be \nlabeled in Braille, so that I know what we have.  This also takes time, but I cannot do it \nmyself.  If items aren’t labeled and I need to get something out of the cupboard when the \npersonal care worker isn’t there, I would not know what it was I was grabbing.  I could think \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 82 of 166\n\nI am getting a can of milk for my coffee, it could turn out to be green beans. It is very \nimportant to me that I know what is in my own cupboard. \n22.  My husband and I enjoy taking advantage of our community when we can.  We enjoy \ntheater, the symphony and music concerts.  Our favorite activity is going out to eat.  We also \nenjoy attending our church whenever it is possible to do so.  \n23.  This Medicaid program provides assistance with activities of daily living.  In order to \nbe eligible for Long-term Personal Care Services (LT-PCS), I have been determined to meet \nthe level of care requirements for nursing home. I understand that the LT-PCS is supposed to \ngive the choice of living in my own home instead of in a nursing home. At a minimum, I \nbelieve that I need 38 hours per week to live a healthy and safe life in my own home. \n24.  My husband and I live in a subsidized apartment, i.e. permanent supportive housing.  I \nwant to stay in this home and continue living with my husband.  I do not want to go into a \nnursing home. If I or my husband went into a nursing home, we could not keep our \napartment, because it would be unaffordable without both of our incomes.  I do not believe \nthat this is a sensible option, but if my hours are reduced, I believe that I will deteriorate and \nnot be able to keep up myself or my home. \n \n \n  7/22/11                  /s/P.M.        \nDate          P.M. \n \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 83 of 166\n\nExhibit 4  Declaration of W. Patrick Gahan, M.D.\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 84 of 166\n\nDECLARATION OF W. PATRICK GAHAN, MD \n  W. Patrick Gaban, MD subscribes under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§1746, as follows: \n1. My name is W. Patrick Gahan and I am a licensed physician practicing in Baton \nRouge, Louisiana since 1979. I received by medical degree from the University of \nIllinois in 1976. I completed my residency in Internal Medicine in 1979 at Jewish \nHospital in St Louis, Missouri. I have been Board Certiﬁed by the American Board \nof Internal Medicine since 1979 and the American Board of Geriatrics since 1988. \n2. I have been afﬁliated with Lake Physician Group since 1993. \n3. I have been treating P.M. for two years. P.M. is blind, has \npsoraisis, which is accompanied by psoriatic arthritis, osteo arthritis, irritable bowel \nsyndrome, asthma, diabetes and congestive heart failure. Her overall medical \ncondition is not expected to improve. The fact that she suffers from a combination of \nthese diseases puts her in a precarious situation. \n4. Due to Ms. M.'s medical conditions, she needs assistance performing her \npersonal care tasks such as transferring, bed mobility, bathing, dressing, walking, and \nperforming personal hygiene tasks. Ms. M. experiences extreme pain from her \narthritis, which compounds her inability to care for herself. \n5. Ms. M. can only stand for a limited amount of time which makes it unsafe \nfor her to prepare her own meals or perform household chores, such as housekeeping \nand laundry. \n6. Ms. M. is incontinent and needs assistance cleaning herself after her \nfrequent incontinent episodes, Ms. M. not only takes Lasix, which is a medication \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 85 of 166\n\ncausing frequent urination, but she also has a damaged bladder, which \nsometimes causes her to not feel the sensation of having to urinate. These reasons, \ncoupled with her inability to move quickly cause her incontinence. \n7. To my knowledge Ms. M., has no family or friends who can assist with her \npersonal care needs, so she depends exclusively on her paid assistance. \n8. To my knowledge, P.M. is currently receiving 38 hours per week of \npersonal care services at home for her activities of daily living. These hours of \nservice are medically necessary for her and are at a minimum what she requires. In \nmy opinion, she cannot reside in the community with less assistance for her personal \nand household care needs. \n9. In my opinion, reducing Ms. M.'s current in-home personal care services \nwould jeopardize her community life and her health care. \n10. If Ms. M.'s hours of personal care services are reduced to 32 hours per \nweek or less, she will be at signiﬁcant risk of going into a nursing facility. This \nreduction is medically inappropriate. \n11. In my experience, Ms. M. would not receive the same level of \nmedical/health care and attention in a nursing facility, which she receives presently in \nthe community. In a nursing facility, she will not receive the same one-on-one \nattention to her activities of daily living, which she presently receives. \n12. I am quite concerned that if Ms. M. were forced to enter a nursing facility, \nher physical and emotional health would deteriorate rapidly and unnecessarily. \n \n  7/6/11             /s/ W. Patrick Gahan, M.D.   \nDate            W.

My name is E.M.S. I am 70 years old.  I live alone in Winnsboro, Louisiana.  I \nhave lived in Franklin parish all of my life. \n2.  I began working in the fields when I was a child, so I only went to school \nthrough the third grade.  Because I had no opportunity to get an education, I cannot \nread or write.  I continued working in cotton and other farming fields until I was \napproximately 50 years old.   \n3.  I was married once and my husband died in 1978.  I raised nine children. Two \nof my children, both sons, are now deceased.  Both died in car accidents \napproximately 20 years ago.  I have six daughters.  Five of my daughters live within \ntwenty minutes of my home, but all of my daughters work and have families of their \nown.  One of my daughters lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  My son lives \napproximately twenty minutes away, and he works full-time, sometimes seven days \nper week.   \n4.  My youngest daughter is the one that I talk to most often and is the one who \nhelps me with my mail and visits when she can.  She has three children ages 13, 17 \nand 21.  Her 21 year old has a developmental disability and requires a great deal of \nher time, since she is his primary caregiver.  She tries to do what she can for me, but \nshe cannot help me on a daily basis. \n5.  I have arthritis and diabetes.  I am also very overweight. I weigh approximately \n330 pounds.  I am about five feet, eight inches tall.  However, at one time in my life I \nwas approximately six feet tall.   \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 88 of 166\n\n6.  The severity of my arthritis stems from the manual labor I performed as a child \nand later as an adult.  I find that, often, I cannot use my fingers to grip items, such as \na fork, a knife or a hairbrush.  When I am able to grip, I lose my strength easily and \ndrop things. \n7.  I am able to walk but I have poor balance and get dizzy easily.  To get around, I \nuse a wheelchair when I am outside my house, but my house is too small for me to be \nable to use the wheelchair at home so I walk around my house holding on to furniture \nor the walls, but I am constantly afraid of falling.  When my aide is with me, she \nhelps keep me steady while I walk.   \n8.  I cannot get in and out of a chair without assistance. And, when I first stand, I \ncannot move right away because I tend to feel dizzy and disoriented.  \n9.   I have difficulty moving around in bed.  Often, I lie in one position because \nmoving is too difficult.  \n10.  I cannot get on and off the toilet without help, I need help undressing before \nusing the toilet and dressing after I use the toilet. \n11.  I need help cleaning myself after toileting.  I need help bathing and dressing.  I \nalso need help doing something as simple as brushing my hair because I cannot grip \nthe hairbrush and I cannot lift my arm over my head.   \n12.  When I eat my noon meal, which is my largest meal, my worker often has to \nfeed me, because I cannot grip the fork for very long, and I begin spilling food.  \n13.  Because of the pain and my lack of mobility, both caused by my arthritis, I am \nunable to prepare meals, do my laundry or attend to household chores. My worker has \nto do these chores. \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 89 of 166\n\n14.  When I stand for too long, or exert myself, I become breathless.  I think this is \ndue to my weight.  As a result of this shortness of breath, I often have to do all \nactivities very slowly.  For example, bathing and dressing causes me to become out of \nbreath while my worker is assisting me.  If its done very slowly, I manage a lot better. \n15.  I have incontinence episodes daily and need help from my long-term personal \ncare worker to clean myself after these incidents.  When I am alone and these \naccidents occur, I do my best to clean myself, but find that I cannot reach to \ncompletely clean myself and cannot change my clothes and dress myself after the \nincidents. \n16.  I have constant pain in my back and in my knees, which causes difficulty to \nwalk, sit or stand for any length of time. \n17.  I am eligible for and receive Medicaid.  I receive $521 per month in Social \nSecurity from my husband, and I get $93 per month in Supplemental Security \nIncome.   \n18.  I received 38 hours of long-term personal care services until sometime in April \nof 2011.  After my most recent assessment, the Office of Aging and Adult Services \nrecommended that I receive only 22 hours per week, and I appealed that decision.  \nBecause my appeal was not recognized timely by the Office of Aging and Adult \nServices, the number of my Long-term Personal Care Services was erroneously \nreduced to 22 hours per week of assistance for approximately two weeks.   \n19.  When I was only receiving 22 hours each month I missed meals because my \nworker did not have time to prepare them and I cannot prepare them for myself.  My \nworker was not always available to bathe me, and it is very important that I bathe \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 90 of 166\n\nregularly due to my bowel and bladder accidents.  I stayed in bed most of the time \nbecause I was afraid if I tried to walk I would fall. \n20.  Because I appealed timely, I should never have had my hours reduced to 22 \nhours per week.  When the mistake of lowering my hours to 22 per week was \nrealized, my hours were raised to 32 hours per week.  However, with assistance from \nthe Advocacy Center, I am now receiving thirty-eight hours per week, again \n21.  When I was getting 32 hours of assistance each week.  I continued to miss \nmeals because I am unable to prepare an evening meal and the worker does not have \nthe time to do this and to care for me.   \n22.  Even with thirty-eight hours per week, I have no one to assist me to prepare for \nbed, so my hygiene is not as good as it should be.  When I have accidents and my \nworker is not with me, and I try to clean myself as best I can, but I need assistance to \ncompletely clean myself.   \n23.  My daughters try to assist me, but they cannot provide all of the care that I need. \nI know that if my hours are, again, reduced to thirty-two hours per week, I will have \nto enter a nursing home which I do not want to do. I find that I generally feel weaker \nwhen I am forced to do more for myself. \n24.  Because of my health issues, it is important that I see my doctor regularly.  Each \ntime I go to the doctor, I am gone for two to three hours.  I need my personal care \nworker to not only help me prepare to go to the doctor, but she also assists me while I \nam at the doctor.   I cannot push my own wheelchair, so my worker has to push me.  \n25.  I am worried that without an adequate number of Long-term Personal Care \nServices, I will not be able to see my doctor as often as I am supposed to see him.  \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 91 of 166\n\n26.  I want to stay in my home and receive that amount of support that I need.  I do \nnot want to go into a nursing home, but if I only receive 32 hours of assistance each \nweek, I will deteriorate and be forced into a nursing home.  I believe I am cared for \nbetter in my home than I would be in a nursing home. \n27.   I want to stay in my house because I want to have control over my own life, and \nI know I will be happier and healthier if I remain in my own home. \n \n \n8/29/2011            /s/E.M.S.       \nDate            E.M.S. \n \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 92 of 166\n\nExhibit 7  Declaration of C.D.\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 93 of 166\n\nDECLARATION OF C.D. \nC.D. subscribes under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, as follows: \n1.  My name is C.D. I am 62 years old.  I live in Abbeville, Louisiana.  I have lived \nin Abbeville most of my life. \n2.  I am diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), \nrheumatoid arthritis, congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, carpal tunnel \nsyndrome, lumbar and cervical degenerative disc disease, chronic pain, macular \ndegeneration, major depression and panic disorder. \n3.  I woke up one morning in 1977 and could not get out of bed due to back pain.  I \nwas able to get to the doctor two days later and was told I had ruptured discs.  I was \n29 years old when that happened, and since that time, I have always been in pain.   \n4.  I have had approximately sixteen back surgeries over the past 34 years.  In the \nlatter part of 2008, I had rods put in my back, and I have been able to do less for \nmyself since that surgery. \n5.  Since the surgery in 2008, I need extensive help to transfer from and to bed, and \nto toilet, bathe, dress, ambulate, prepare food, shop and eat.  Due to pain and stiffness, \nI cannot perform these tasks on my own. \n6.  I have a manual wheelchair, but I cannot propel the chair myself, so it is useless \nunless someone is with me to push me.  I can walk, but cannot walk more than \napproximately ten feet before having to rest due to pain.  If I stand for longer than \nfive minutes, I am in great pain.   \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 94 of 166\n\n7.  I have a bed that I can raise and lower electronically, so I can reposition myself \nin bed and avoid developing bed sores and ulcers.  However, I cannot transfer myself \nout of the bed without a great amount of pain. \n8.  I also experience severe headaches, periodically. These headaches make it even \nmore difficult for me to manage anything on my own.  The headaches almost \nparalyze me.  I cannot eat or move because if I do the pain seems to become worse. \n9.  When I have headaches, I do not want to eat or drink, but my doctors have told \nme that it is dangerous for me not to eat at regular intervals, because my diabetes can \ncause my blood glucose levels to drop. \n10.  Approximately three to four times each week, I must be fed.  My arms and \nhands become numb, and I am unable to hold a fork or spoon.  I cannot pick up a \nglass during these times, so my worker has to hold the glass to my mouth.  \n11.  I cannot go to the toilet on my own.  My worker has to help me to transfer on \nand off the toilet. She must clean me because I cannot reach behind to clean myself. \nShe also must assist me to undress before toileting and dress after toileting. As I \nmentioned above, I need help dressing in the morning and undressing at night because \nI have pain lifting my arms and bending over. \n12.  I have a shower chair, which allows me to sit in the shower.  However, I cannot \nbend to get to all parts of my body, so I need assistance from my worker to wash \nmyself, as well as assistance into and out of the shower chair. \n13.  All of the assistance I am provided must be done very slowly. On an average \nday, just the routine activities I have described can take approximately five to six \nhours.  For example, showering alone takes about forty-five minutes, with the \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 95 of 166\n\ndressing and undressing, assistance getting into and out of the shower, and washing. \nJust getting out of bed in the morning can take fifteen to twenty minutes.   \n14.   I cannot move quickly due to pain, which is mostly in my back and right leg \nbut also sometimes in my left leg.  I also experience pain in my hands where I \nrecently had carpal tunnel surgery.  In addition to the pain, the COPD and congestive \nheart failure cause me to become breathless if I do anything to exert myself. \n15.  I cannot stand to prepare meals.  The most I can do for myself is prepare cold \ncereal or make a cold sandwich.  I go to the grocery with my worker once each \nmonth, using the motorized scooters provided by the grocery store, so that I can \nchoose what I want.  However, my worker must get things from the shelves, push the \nbasket with the groceries, load the groceries into the car, take the groceries into the \nhouse and store whatever was purchased. \n16.  I do not drive, but do still have a driver’s license.  I haven’t driven in over a \nyear.  Either my worker or my aunt, who lives in Lafayette, must bring me to doctor’s \nappointments. \n17.  My worker does my laundry, and folds and puts away the clothes for me. \n18.  I began receiving services in 2009 from the Long-term Personal Care Services \nprogram. I was awarded thirty-two hours and thirty minutes at that time, but I believe, \nI could have used more assistance.   In 2011, I lost my services for approximately \nthree months due to a poorly done assessment, which took place on December 1, \n2010.   That assessment found that I was ineligible.  The assessment incorrectly \nindicated that I was independent in toileting, transferring and eating; however, I need \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 96 of 166\n\nextensive help with all of those activities, and I needed extensive help with those \nactivities at the time of the assessment. \n19.  I appealed the decision, and brought letters from my doctors stating that I \nneeded help with personal care tasks, and still my services were stopped in late March \nof 2011.   \n20.  During the appeals hearing, the administrative law judge suggested I reapply for \nservices and gave me the number to call.  I reapplied for assistance, was found \neligible and my services started again in July of 2011.  The assessment that found be \neligible was done on June 3, 2011, and it correctly indicates that I need assistance \nwith toileting, transferring and eating, as well as, bathing, dressing, locomotion and \ntending to personal hygiene. \n21.  I believe that my physical and mental health deteriorated during the time that I \ndid not have services.  My depression worsened and I had great difficulty getting out \nof bed to eat, shower or toilet.  Sometimes, I didn’t eat or get out of bed for the full \nday.  \n22.  The only assistance that I had was from my, then twelve-year old grandson who \nwould come to my home after school to help me and would help me on weekends. \nWithout my grandson’s assistance, I would have had no choice, but to go into a \nnursing home.  My grandson, not only assisted me with personal care, but he also, \nassisted me with meals, laundry and shopping. .  My grandson is now thirteen and I \nlove him dearly, but I do not think this is something that a thirteen-year old child \nshould have had to do for me.   \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 97 of 166\n\n23.  When my services were reinstated, I was granted 30 hours of services per week.  \nNow, once my worker leaves I often go to bed and do not get up. Frequently, there is \nnot enough time to shower and have three meals a day.  This means that I do not get \nthe meals I should, which is important with my diabetes, and I do not drink the \namount of water I should because I cannot go to the toilet. \n24.  I feel like a prisoner in my bed.  \n25.  Even though thirty hours per week does not give my worker enough time to care \nfor my personal care as well household chores, I did not appeal. In the previous \nhearing I had been through, my needs did not seem to be considered, and I was just \ntold to reapply.  If I appealed, I could only get up to 32 hours a week of help, which \nwould still be inadequate. I have not been told that any emergency waiver slots could \nbe made available to me if I won my appeal.  It is too late for me to appeal now. \n26.  If I had more assistance, I might have the energy to do things that I enjoy, such \nas visiting with friends and shopping, It has been a very long time since I have been \nable to get out and do anything other than go to the doctor’s office. \n27.  I believe I need three to four hours of assistance in the morning and three to four \nhours of assistance in the evening to assure that all of my personal care tasks are \naccomplished, along with the household chores that I cannot do such as cleaning, \nlaundry, shopping and cooking. \n28.  I am divorced and have three grown children.  None of my children assist me on \na regular basis.  I cannot depend on them for assistance.  One of my daughters has \ntaken on the role of caregiver for my ex-husband who has a significant disability, and \ndoes not have time to assist me since she must also work. \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 98 of 166\n\n29.  My mother is 88 years old and has Alzheimer’s disease, so she cannot assist me.  \nI have seven brothers, but they do not help me. \n30.  I am eligible for and receive Medicaid.  I receive $674 per month in Social \nSecurity retirement and $20 per month in supplemental security income. \n31.  I do not think I can continue for much longer with only thirty hours of \nassistance per week, and I hate to think about it, but I realize I might have to go into a \nnursing home for care. \n32.  If I were in a nursing home, I know my mental and physical health would \ndeteriorate.  I would not have the joy of seeing my grandson as often, and I would not \nhave much to live for.  \n33.  I can live in my own home with adequate assistance and I want to stay in my \nown home.  \n \n  9/21/11                  /s/C.D.          \nDate          C.D. \n \n  6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 99 of 166\n\nExhibit  8 Declaration of Lecy Broussard, A.P.R.N.\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 100 of 166\n\nDECLARATION OF LECY BROUSSARD, APRN \nLecy Broussard subscribes under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, as \nfollows: \n1.  My name is Lecy Broussard.  I am a Board-certified Family Psychiatric and \nMental Health Nurse Practitioner. I have a bachelor’s degree in nursing from the \nUniversity of Southwestern Louisiana and masters in science from the University \nof South Alabama College of Nursing, which I received in 2005. \n2.  I am in private practice in Crowley, Louisiana and my business is Acadiana Psych \nAssociates, LLC. I work in collaboration with Edgardo Concepcion, MD.  As a \nBoard-certified Adult Psychiatric and Mental Health Nurse Practitioner I perform \npsychiatric evaluations, and provide medication management and supportive \ntherapy.  I have been doing this type of work for approximately five years.  \n3.  I have been treating C. D. for approximately five years for Major Depression and \nPanic Disorder.  I provide her with medication management and supportive \ntherapy in an outpatient setting.  \n4.  Ms. D. is diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart \nfailure, macular degeneration, as well as the conditions causing chronic pain such \nas arthritis, disc disease, and carpal tunnel syndrome.  These physical ailments \ncompound the affects of Ms. D.’s  depression and panic disorder.  It seems that \nwhen Ms. D. is forced to perform her own self-care and take care of her \nhousehold, she is in much greater pain.  The increased pain causes her to have \ndifficulty sleeping, which leads to an exacerbation of her depression. \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 101 of 166\n\n5.  It is my understanding that Ms. D. currently receives thirty hours per week of \nhome care services through the Long-term Personal Care Services program.  Due \nto chronic pain and her inability to care for herself and perform her household \nduties, she needs this program to avoid institutionalization in a nursing home. \n6.  Earlier this year, Ms. D.’s services were terminated.  During this time, I noticed \nthat her pain seemed to intensify, she decompensated mentally and her depression \nintensified.  I noticed that during this time she had severe and persistent crying \nspells, she had insomnia and she was greatly agitated. It is my professional \nopinion that this change in her emotional and mental health was due to the \nwithdrawal of home care services. \n7.  During the time, that Ms. D. had no services at home, I feared she would need to \nbe hospitalized.  Often in appeared that she could not cope with her life as it was, \nand I feared that she could get to a point of harming herself.  Her appointments \nwith me became much more frequent during the time that she did not have \npersonal care services.   I made changes to her medication during that time, but \nshe has, now, resumed the medication regime she had prior to her services being \neliminated.  \n8.  Although, Mr. D.’s services were restored in July of 2011 and her health is \nbeginning to stabilize, I do not believe that thirty hours per week will adequately \nmeet Ms. D.’s needs over time. It seems that Ms. D.’s needs are still not being \nmet.  She is not eating properly because she often doesn’t get all of her meals, and \nshe is still forced to do things for herself the remaining time of the day when no \nworker is available.  Ms. D. should have assistance each time she goes to the \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 102 of 166\n\ntoilet.  She should have liquids when needed, and not be afraid to drink because \nshe will have to get out of bed to toilet.  She should not have to stand and walk to \nthe kitchen to get water or food when her pain is too great to allow her to do so. \nMy understanding from Ms. D. is that she is not always being bathed if the \nworker does not have time to do that, and that is important to her, especially if she \nhas had an accident during the day or night.  As stated earlier the exertion of \nperforming self-care activities causes Ms. D. a great deal of pain, which \nintensifies her mental health and also appears detrimental to her physical health. \n9.  Ms. D.’s health, although better now that her services are restored, is not as strong \nas it could be.  I believe she may never be as healthy as she once was.  Her pain \nonly seems to have deepened, and she seems to need more assistance with her \nactivities of daily living. \n10. Ms. D. still relies on her thirteen-year old grandson to provide some of her care \nbecause she does not have enough paid assistance.  This causes undue emotional \nstress on Ms. D., because she does not believe her grandson should have to help \nher.  And, it is my opinion that her grandson should not have to do these things \nfor his grandmother. She wants his company, but she does not want him to be her \ncaregiver.  I believe that Ms. D. mental health would be greatly improved, if she \nknew she did not have to depend on her grandson.   \n11. Based on my observations of Ms. D., I believe she has not, yet, gone into a \nnursing home because she struggling to stay in her own home.  I do not believe \nthat the current amount of services she receives is enough to keep her out of a \nnursing home. I believe that without adequate assistance her mental and physical \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 103 of 166\n\nhealth will continue to deteriorate and she, eventually, will be forced into a \nnursing home.  \n12. For all reasons identified in the above paragraph, I recommend that Ms. D. \nreceive between ten and twelve hours per day of home care services.  I believe \nthat this amount of  personal care services is necessary for her to attain and hold \nonto her optimal level of emotional and physical functioning.   \n13. Ms. D. should be provided the services she needs to remain in her home. She will \nbe healthier, both mentally and physically, if she remains at home rather than \nenters a nursing home. \n \n/s/ L.

My name is I.M.L. I live alone.  I am 81 years old and have lived and worked in \nNew Orleans, Louisiana most of my life.   \n2.  I began working when I was ten years old, washing dishes for a neighbor, which \nwas the year my mother died.  My father died when I was three years old, so I \nnever knew him. \n3.  I worked until I was seventy-six years old.  I worked as a cook, as a nurse’s aid in \na nursing home, and as a janitor for an office building.  I held many jobs, but my \nfavorite was cooking. \n4.  Because of my chronic disabling conditions, I can no longer cook, clean, do \nlaundry or tend to my own personal care.   \n5.  I need help with everything I do.  I need help transferring, toileting, bathing, \ngrooming, ambulating, dressing, and eating. \n6.  I was diagnosed with diabetes when I was in my twenties, and when I was in my \nseventies, I was diagnosed with kidney disease and arthritis.  I continued working \nfor three years after the diagnoses of kidney disease and arthritis, but eventually I \nhad to leave my job.  I was asked to return to work by the manager of the job I \nleft, but didn’t feel that I could manage it any longer. \n7.  Approximately one year ago, I began having blood clots and was diagnosed with \nParkinson’s Disease and gout.   These diagnoses were made after going to the \ndoctor because I fell outside while walking up the steps to my apartment. \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 106 of 166\n\n8.  All of my medical conditions are chronic and are not expected to improve.  In \nfact, I find that as my Parkinson’s Disease, my gout and my arthritis progresses \nand, as I age, I have become much weaker. \n9.  I cannot pick up a glass to drink and have difficulty holding a fork or spoon to \nfeed myself.  I have a cup that I can hold once my worker hands it to me, and I \ndrink out of that cup.  When taking my medicine, I often drop pills on the floor \nand have to wait for someone to pick them up.  I cannot bend to the floor to \nretrieve the medication. \n10. I cannot undress before toileting and cannot dress after toileting.  I cannot clean \nmyself after going to the toilet. I have a bedside commode with railings, and using \nall of my strength, I can get myself on and off the bedside commode; however, I \nstill cannot clean myself.  I have fallen trying to get out of the bed to the toilet, so \nI only get up, if it is absolutely necessary. \n11. I cannot get up from a chair without assistance.  I cannot get in and out of the \nbathtub without assistance and I cannot wash myself or towel myself dry after \nbathing. \n12. When I applied for services in 2007, I was given twenty-eight hours per week of \nLong-term Personal Care Services.  Because twenty-eight hours per week was not \nenough time, I still had to do many things for myself that my worker did not have \ntime to do, such as cooking and cleaning, and even tending to my personal needs.  \n13.  During this time, I was forced to transfer on my own, which was extremely \ndifficult and painful for me, and  toileting on my own was very hard.   \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 107 of 166\n\n14.   Since 2007, my ability to do things for myself became more difficult, because \nmy muscles and body were less able to deal with the stress of performing \nactivities that were too difficult to perform. \n15. In 2008, my hours were increased to thirty-nine hours per week.  My worker now \nhas time to provide me with most, but not all, of my personal care and take care of \nmy household needs, such as cleaning, laundry and shopping. \n16. After I had my annual assessment on July 13, 2011, I received the attached notice \ninforming me that I was approved to receive only 32 hours a week of services, \nbeginning August 8, 2011.  I have never gotten notice from the State that I could \napply for an emergency EDA waiver slot if the 32 hours of service were not \nenough to prevent me from having to enter a nursing home for care. \n17. On a typical day my worker arrives at 9:00 AM.  She empties my bedside \ncommode, assists me to get out of bed, bathes me and dresses me.  These few \nactivities, alone, can take approximately ninety minutes. \n18.  My worker then prepares my meals for the day and feeds me breakfast. Eating \ntakes a lot more time than when I could feed myself and could chew easier.  \n19.  My worker makes sure I have something to drink and takes care of household \nchores that should be done that day.  In addition, she helps me as needed to go to \nthe toilet.  Toileting also takes a lot of time because I cannot, alone, get to the \ntoilet, sit on it, or clean myself. \n20. If my worker brings me to the doctor that day or has to do shopping, then some of \nthe personal-related chores usually do not get done.  That could be a bath or \nmaybe she will not prepare a meal. \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 108 of 166\n\n21. My worker leaves at 3:00 PM on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and \nshe leaves at 2:00 PM on Thursday Friday and Saturday.   Before she leaves, she \nassists me to the toilet and helps me get into the bed, where I usually remain until \nthe next morning when my worker comes to help me get out of the bed.  She \nleaves food in the kitchen for me and if I feel strong enough, I can have an \nevening meal, but often I do not eat after she leaves because it hurts too much to \nget out of bed. \n22. Until about a year ago, I was very active in my church, which is the same church I \nhave enjoyed attending for more than forty-five years.  I would still be active, \ntoday, if my health permitted.  The priest from my church visits at least once each \nweek to give me communion and pray with me.  I still go to mass when I feel \nstrong enough, but those times are rare.  If I do go to church, my priest will either \npick me up or send someone else to pick me up and bring me to church.  I very \nmuch enjoy these occasions.   \n23.  Neighbors and friends also sometimes visit me.   \n24. I raised nine children, and usually worked two jobs to make sure they could have \nan education.  Five of my children are now deceased.  I have one son that is in a \nnursing home, after being severely beaten by the police approximately ten years \nago.  I have another son that lives in New Orleans, but he does not assist me.  He \nhas an intellectual disability and is an alcoholic.  I have two living daughters, one \nhas Alzheimer’s Disease and lives with her daughter in New Orleans, and one \nlives in Texas, which is where she remained after evacuating as a result of \nHurricane Katrina in 2005. \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 109 of 166\n\n25. I had eight sisters, and they are all deceased. \n26. I am eligible for and receive Medicaid.  My income is approximately $700 per \nmonth from Social Security.  I also receive Medicare. \n27. Medicaid pays for my Long-term Personal Care Services, and I need at least the \namount of assistance I have now.   However, I believe I could benefit from a \ncouple of hours each night, so that I would not have to get into bed in the \nafternoon, in addition to the thirty-nine hours that I have, and to make sure I have \nan evening meal and use the toilet. \n28. If my hours are reduced, I am afraid that I will have to go into a nursing home \nwhich I very much do not want.  I have lived in my apartment for eighteen years \nand want to continue to live here. \n29. I know the poor care that a nursing home can provide based on the care my son \nreceives and based on what I saw when working in nursing homes.   \n30. I do not want to go to a nursing home.  I worked too hard and for too many years, \nto be forced out of my home and into a nursing home. \n31. I want to stay in my home where I believe I can live a healthier and safer life. \n \n  /s/I.M.L.              8/17/2011     \nI.M.L.

My name is Scharmaine Lawson-Baker.  I am an Advanced Practice Registered \nNurse, practicing in New Orleans, Louisiana.  I received my Baccalaureate in Nursing \nfrom Dillard University in New Orleans, Louisiana. I received a doctorate in Nursing \nPractice in 2008 from Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I am Board \nCertified as a Family Nurse Practitioner. \n2.  In the scope of my practice I treat many people with disabilities, including the \nelderly, who cannot get out of their homes to see their physician.  I specialize in \nmaking home visits through my company, Advance Clinical Consultants, LLC.  I \nhave the only nurse practitioner-owned house call practice in New Orleans.  I have \nbeen treating people with disabilities in their homes since 2004.  I currently visit \napproximately 500 patients who have chronic disabilities and who need to receive \ncare in their homes. \n3.  I have been treating I.M.L. for approximately seven years.  I monitor her blood \npressure, check the edema in her lower extremities, refill her medications, prescribe \nhome care therapies, as needed and monitor her overall health with the goal of \nkeeping her out of the hospital. I visit Ms. L. once a month.  \n4.  Ms. L. is diagnosed with diabetes, kidney disease, arthritis, blood clots, gout, \nParkinson’s disease and high cholesterol.   \n5.  These combined chronic conditions cause Ms. L. a great deal of pain on a daily \nbasis and render her unable to perform basic personal care and household chores. \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 112 of 166\n\n6.  Ms. L. needs extensive assistance transferring, toileting, eating, drinking, \ngrooming, bathing, dressing and ambulating.  In addition, she no longer has the \ncapability to perform household chores, such as laundry and cleaning.  She no longer \nshops for herself, and cannot prepare meals. \n7.  My understanding is that Ms. L. is currently receiving thirty-nine hours per week \nof home care assistance through the Long-Term Personal Care Services program.  It \nis my professional opinion that Ms. L. needs at least that amount of assistance to \nremain healthy and stable in her own home.   \n8.  I have treated hundreds of elderly people with disabilities similar to those that \nMs. L. has.  Though the amount of assistance required with personal care tasks, \nhousekeeping, and shopping varies based on the individual, the size of the home, and \nthe amount of help available, I can state that persons with the degree of disability that \nMs. L. has, who need extensive assistance with eating, toileting, transferring, and \nambulating generally require at least six hours a day of personal care and \nhousekeeping assistance to avoid deterioration in their conditions, and thus to avoid \nhaving to enter a nursing home. \n9.  It would be better for Ms. L.’s health if she were not forced to go to bed in the \nafternoon.  Ms. L. should not miss meals because of her diabetes, and with the \nassistance she has now, she goes to bed in the afternoon and sometimes is not able to \neat an evening meal.  It would be better for the edema in Ms. L.’s lower extremities if \nshe were not in bed for such long periods of time.  If Ms. L. had assistance to get to \nthe toilet later in the day, it would be less likely that she would have to use her \nbedside commode, which she has fallen out of bed trying to do.    \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 113 of 166\n\n10.  Without adequate home care assistance, Ms. L.’s health will deteriorate and she \nwill likely have to seek care in a nursing home. It is my opinion that her physical \nhealth, as well as her mental health, will decline without adequate home care.  If she \ndoes not have proper nutrition and get her medications as prescribed her health will \nsuffer.  If forced to stay in bed for even longer periods of time, I fear the edema she \ncurrently has would get worse and hospitalization or even, nursing home care would \nbe required.    \n11.  Ms. L. has proven that she can remain in her home with personal care assistance.  \nShe should not have to enter a nursing home to get the care that she needs.  I believe \nthe amount of personal care she gets is important to her health, happiness and well-\nbeing, and I see no reason for that to be jeopardized. \n \n  /s/ Scharmaine Lawson-Baker      8/17/11     \nScharmaine Lawson-Baker, DNP, FNP-BC    Date \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 114 of 166\n\nExhibit  11 Declaration of V.U.S.\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 115 of 166\n\nDECLARATION OF V.U.S. \nV.U.S. subscribes under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, as follows:  \n1.  My name is V.U.S. I live in New Orleans, Louisiana, and have lived here all of \nmy life. I am thirty-six years old. I live with a roommate who works out of town \nmost of the time. My roommate is not available to help with my care.  \n2.  I had a traumatic injury when I was 25 years old that caused me to have \nquadriplegia, which means I am paralyzed from the upper chest down. I cannot \nmove my legs and only have gross movement of my arms. I also have diabetes.  \n3.  I need assistance with all of my personal care activities, including toileting, bed \nmobility, transferring, showering, personal hygiene, and dressing. Described \nbelow is a typical day in my life.  \na.  My personal care attendant arrives, and I let her in by using a remote \ncontrol to open the door. She quickly empties my catheter bag because it \nﬁlls up completely overnight. Too full a bag can lead to urinary problems, \ninfection, and a drastic spike in my blood pressure called autonomic \ndysreﬂexia. I use a catheter because I am incontinent.  \nb.  Next, she gets me into my Hoyer lift. She cannot lift me without the Hoyer \nlift. Using the Hoyer lift, she transfers me to my shower chair. She gives \nme an enema. Getting in and out of bed in the morning and transferring to \nthe shower chair can take a half an hour a day.  \nc.  I have a roll-in shower, so she rolls me into the shower, and while I am in \nmy shower chair, I have a bowel movement. Afterward, she bathes my \nentire body and washes my hair. I brush my teeth while I am in the \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 116 of 166\n\nshower. Brushing my teeth is one of the few things I can do \nindependently, once she puts toothpaste on the toothbrush and puts my \ntoothbrush into my hand. The shower task alone can take an hour or more \neach day.  \nd.  Once she dries me after the shower, she transfers me back to my bed using \nthe Hoyer lift, and she then dresses me. To put on my shirt, she puts one \narm in one of the sleeves, and then rolls me to one side to put the shirt \nunder me and put the other arm through the second sleeve. She then puts \non my pants or skirt. This activity can take thirty minutes.  \ne.  When I have urinary tract infections, which occur about once every other \nmonth, she also has to put a diaper on me.  \nf.  Once I am dressed, she transfers me into my wheelchair. While in my \nwheelchair I am fairly independent. I can use a computer by using two of \nmy ﬁngers to type or using certain software that helps me to type. \ng.  My attendant prepares breakfast for me and sets in on the table. She places \nmy utensil in my hand, so that I can eat. I can feed myself. She also \nprepares something for me for lunch and puts in a place where I can reach \nit. She cleans the breakfast dishes and the kitchen area.  \nh.  Once I am in my wheelchair and have food prepared, I can take care of \nmost of my needs. The morning tasks that I described above take between \nthree to four hours a day.  \ni.  When my worker returns to my home in the evening, she prepares an \nevening meal for me, and places it on the table.  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 117 of 166\n\nj.  While I eat, she takes care of household chores, such as cleaning the house \nand the bathroom and doing laundry.  \nk.  Once I have eaten, she cleans the area where I have eaten, and cleans \ndishes that need to be cleaned.  \nl.  After I have eaten, she assists me to prepare for bed. She assists me to \nwash my face, put toothpaste on my toothbrush and comb my hair.  \nm. Before assisting me into bed, she makes sure that a dry pad is placed on \nmy bed in case I have an accident at night. Approximately once each \nweek, I wet the bed and the sheets must be changed and cleaned when this \nhappens.  \nn.  She transfers me into bed from my wheelchair using my transfer board.  \no.  She then disconnects my catheter from my leg bag and connects my \ncatheter to a larger overnight bag.  \np.  She then takes care of any odds and ends around the house, and leaves me \nfor the night. The evening tasks, from preparation of my evening meal to \nleaving me for the night, take my worker approximately another three \nhours.  \n4.  When I am alone at night, I cannot exit my home in an emergency. However, this \nis a risk that I prefer to take, if my only other option is a nursing home.  \n5.  I need assistance with laundry, house cleaning, and meal preparation. I cannot \nperform any of these tasks independently. I am able to plan meals and make \nshopping lists.  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 118 of 166\n\n6.  In addition to the tasks listed above, I need assistance with shopping and errands. \nMy worker usually assists with these tasks on the weekends. I can get to the store \nin my van, but I need someone to handle my purchases and my money. Assisting \nme to shop for food, clothing, household items, and other personal needs \ngenerally takes my worker approximately 2 to 3 hours a week.  \n7.  Until May of 2011, I was working for Ochsner Foundation as a Clinical \nResearch Coordinator. Once my attendant got me ready for work, I could drive \nmyself to work in an adapted van. While at work, my co-workers would assist me \nby assisting me to heat food that I have for lunch and getting my lunch to the \ntable. They also helped me get water and other liquids during the day. I was \nprovided with adaptations to my phone and my computer, and had clerical \nassistance to perform tasks I could not perform. Currently, I am looking for full-\ntime work.  \n8.  I work put-time for a medical laser company doing things such as advertising, \nweb design, and some general bookkeeping. I work 1-2 hours per week and am \npaid $20 per hour. I also receive $247 per week in unemployment and as of this \nweek have only 18 weeks left before my unemployment is terminated. I have \napplied for Social Security Disability Insurance, but am still waiting to hear from \nthe Social Security Administration.  \n9.  I received my Masters Degree in Public Health from Tulane University in 2004 \nand my Bachelor's Degree in Psychology from Tulane in 1997. I was in medical \nschool at Louisiana State University when my injury occurred, and the university \nasked me to leave the program because the Louisiana State University Medical \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 119 of 166\n\nSchool did not think I could meet all of the physical requirements of medical \nschool.  \n10. My parents live in New Orleans and provide me with a lot of emotional support. \nThey cannot provide me with physical care because they are not able to lift me. In \naddition, they work at the French Market in New Orleans, which means they work \nseven days a week from about 8:00 AM until 8:00 PM. When they are not \nworking they are assisting my 30 year-old brother who lives with my parents and \nhas an intellectual disability.  \n11. I have a sister who provided me with some assistance in the past, but she now is \nmarried, pregnant and has a three-year old child. She no longer has time to \nprovide me with personal care.  \n12. I received an Elderly and Disabled Adult (EDA) Waiver slot in October of \n2002; however, when I started working, I was told I earned too much money to \nremain on the EDA Waiver, so I was discharged from that Waiver.  \n13. 1 purchase Medicaid through the Medicaid Purchase Plan, so I am able to access \nLong- term Personal Care services. Currently I receive 39 '/2 hours per week of \nLong-term Personal Care services. At one time I was receiving 56 hours per \nweek. I believe I need 42-45 hours per week to be healthy and safe at home and in \nthe community, or approximately 3 hours of assistance in the morning and three \nhours of assistance in the evening with extra time on the weekends for shopping \nand errands.  \n14. Even working full-time, I cannot afford to pay for all of the personal care services \nthat need. When I was working for Ochsner, I made $30,000 per year, and my \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 120 of 166\n\nattendant care would cost me approximately $32,850.09 per year. This is based on \n$15 per hour of personal assistance services, which was the rate quoted to me by \nmy current provider in April of 2011, when I lost Medicaid for three weeks \ncausing me to pay out of pocket for care.  \n15. Without adequate personal care attendant services, I would be trapped in my own \nhome and not able to work or enjoy a social life. I enjoy going to movies, out to \ndinner, local festivals and generally spending time with family and friends. I also \nhave a group offriends that gets together for \"game night\" once each month, \nwhere we play cards or board games. My friends and I alternate homes for game \nnight. It would be impossible for me to enjoy this time with friends if I were \nforced into a nursing home.  \n16. My most recent annual assessment for LT-PCS was performed on July 8, 2011. \nThough my needs have not changed, my assessor notiﬁed me on the day of my \nassessment that my hours would be reduced to 32 hours per week starting August \n1, 2011. I have not received any notice from the Department of Health and \nHospitals about the availability of an Emergency EDA waiver slot if I needed \nmore hours to avoid having to go into a nursing home. If I am only approved to \nreceive 32 hours of Long-term Personal Care Services per week, I will have to \nmove into a nursing home.  \n17. Thirty-two hours of personal care assistance a week would not be sufﬁcient to \nmeet my needs. My worker would not have time to take care of my personal \nneeds, prepare my meals, do my housekeeping, and assist me with necessary \nshopping for food and other household items and personal needs. Because of the \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 121 of 166\n\nlack of time for meal preparation and shopping, I may be forced to skip meals \nwhich are not advisable for a diabetic. In the evening, if my worker's time were \nshortened, I would have to go directly to bed after I eat, which will make it hard \nfor me to digest my food properly. With the hours of help I have now, I can sit up \nfor a while after eating and before going to bed, while my worker completes her \nhousekeeping and laundry tasks.  \n18. The agency that provides my long term personal care services has told me that \nthey will have difﬁculty ﬁnding and keeping staff to work the shorter shifts that \nwould be needed if my hours were reduced. When staff does not show up, I can \nbe left in my bed for a full day or be forced to sleep in my wheelchair. Staying in \nbed or my wheelchair for this long can cause skin breakdown which could lead to \ndecubitus ulcers, which are extremely dangerous for a person with quadriplegia. \nStaying in bed also causes depression, hypoglycemia, dysreﬂexia, all very \ndangerous conditions for me. I also am a diabetic, take numerous pills for other \nhealth concerns, and need food, water, medicine at certain times and seven days a \nweek.  \n19. It will be difﬁcult for me to ﬁnd and keep a job if I do not have a reliable worker \nto provide an adequate amount of personal care. My hygiene will suffer, and I will \nnot be able to keep a normal work schedule.  \n20. I do not want to go into a nursing home. I do not want to lose my independence \nand my freedom. If I were living in a nursing home, I would lose my opportunity \nto work, and would not have the opportunity to remain active in my community. I \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 122 of 166\n\nbelieve my physical health, as well as my mental health would decline \ndrastically.  \n \n  8/19/2011            /s/ V.U.S.       \nDate              V.U.S. \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 123 of 166\n\nExhibit 12  Declaration of Cherie Drez, M.D.\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 124 of 166\n\nDECLARATION OF CHERIE DREZ, MD \n  Cherie Drez, MD subscribes under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1746, as follows: \n1.  My name is Cherie Drez and I am a licensed physician practicing Internal \nMedicine in Gretna, Louisiana, which is in the Greater New Orleans area. \n2.  I have been affiliated with Ochsner Medical Center for approximately ???. \n3.  I am Board certified in Internal Medicine and in Pediatrics. \n4.  My practice includes many people with traumatic spinal cord injuries, so I am \nfamiliar with the personal care needs of people with such injuries. \n5.  I have been treating V.U.S. for approximately four years.  Although her condition \nis medically stable, she requires extensive assistance to live at home and remain \nindependent. \n6.  Ms. S. needs assistance with toileting, bathing, dressing, transferring and personal \ngrooming.  In addition, she does not have the physical capability to perform \nhousehold chores, do laundry, or prepare meals. \n7.  She has no functional use of her legs.  She has gross motor movement in her arms, \nbut cannot pick up an item from a table, the floor or a counter top.  She cannot \ngrab a glass from the cabinet to get her own water.  She is dependent on others to \nassure she receives proper nourishment and hydration. \n8.  Ms. S. has an indwelling suprapubic catheter that empties into a catheter bag.  If \nthat bag is not emptied timely, the urine can back up causing autonomic \ndysreflexia, a life-threatening condition. It is crucial that Ms. S. have timely \nassistance to assure her catheter bag is emptied throughout the day and night. \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 125 of 166\n\n9.  It is important that Ms. S. not be left in her wheelchair for long periods of time.  \nShe must be transferred into her bed at night or in the evening and transferred out \nof bed in the morning to avoid skin breakdowns.  \n10. Having proper nutrition and hydration is especially important to someone with \nquadriplegia.  Eating nutritious food at regular intervals will positively contribute \nto keeping her bowel functioning regular.  Hydration is extremely important \ntoward preventing skin breakdowns.  Ms. S. requires someone to prepare her \nmeals and make sure she has water.  She must have an adequate amount of home-\ncare assistance to assure proper nourishment and hydration. \n11. Ms. S. has been in relatively good health since I have been her physician.  I \nattribute much of that to the fact that she has received an adequate amount of \npersonal care services at home.  She currently receives 39.5 hours of personal care \nservices at home.  I believe that her health and safety would be improved if she \nhas 42-45 hours of care each week.  She would be able to eat and hydrate on a \nregular schedule, her catheter bag would be emptied, as needed, and she would \nreceive assistance to perform pressure releases, as needed. \n12. It is my understanding that Ms. S. has been told that her home care hours will be \nreduced to 32 hours per week.  It is my professional opinion that with only 32 \nhours per week of assistance, Ms. S.’s physical health will be jeopardy.   \n13. If Ms. S. were only provided with 32 hours per week, I believe her health would \ndeteriorate and she would eventually be hospitalized and from there be forced into \nan nursing home.  She would be in danger of increased urinary tract infections, \nskin breakdowns and autonomic dysreflexia without adequate assistance.  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 126 of 166\n\n14. I believe if Ms. S. were forced into a nursing home, it would not only cause her \nphysical health to deteriorate, but would also cause significant deterioration in her \nmental health. \n \n  /s/ Cherie Drez, M.D.           9/8/11      \nCherie Drez, M.D.            Date \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 127 of 166\n\nExhibit 13  Declaration of S.M.\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 128 of 166\n\nDECLARATION OF S.M. \nS.M. subscribes under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, as follows: \n1.  My name is S.M.  I live in Ball, Louisiana, and have lived here most of my life.  \nI am 46 years old.  I live with my seventeen year-old daughter. \n2.  I graduated from Tiago High School in 1983.  After graduation and through \nmuch my adulthood, I worked different jobs.  Jobs that I enjoyed very much were \nbeing a designer in a floral shop and being a cook in a local restaurant. \n3.  When I was fourteen years old, a diving accident left me with a spinal cord \ninjury that affected my left side.  After much rehabilitation, I became independent in \ncaring for myself after the spinal cord injury; however, the injury did take its toll on \nmy joints and my overall body, including my muscles. \n4.  While working as a cook in 2006, I had to have knee replacement surgery.  I \nreturned to work after the surgery, but I found I could not stand for as long as I once \ncould and I needed more support when walking.  I began using a walker soon after \nthe knee replacement surgery and had to quit my job as a cook because I could not \nstand without holding onto the walker. \n5.  On December 27, 2007, I had a massive stroke and was found on my bedroom \nfloor approximately six or seven hours after the stroke occurred.  The stroke primarily \naffected my right side, which was my “good side” after the spinal cord injury.  \nHowever, my left side is also affected, and, in fact, I have little movement or feeling \non either side. \n6.  The stroke has left me fully incapacitated.  I can move my left arm from the \nelbow down, and if someone puts a specific cup on the table in front of me, I can put \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 129 of 166\n\nmy thumb through it and drink for myself.  This is the extent of my ability to care for \nmyself. \n7.  Currently, I receive 38 hours per week from Medicaid’s Long-term Personal \nCare Services program.  However, I used to receive 52 hours per week of Long-term \nPersonal Care Services before the maximum number of hours allowed was reduced to \n42 hours per week, causing my hours to be reduced to 38 hours per week.  My \ndaughter had much more freedom when I received 52 hours per week.  Now, because \nI do not have a paid assistant as often, my daughter must make sure I have meals, \ntend to my hygiene, and do all of the household shopping.  My paid staff no longer \nhas enough time to make sure I have three meals each day and sufficient liquids \nthroughout the day.  There are some days when I am not bathed because my worker \ndid not have the time to bathe me.  \n8.  I need total help with all of my care.  I cannot move myself in bed, but I do have \nan air mattress that relieves pressure, and helps prevent me from getting decubitis \nulcers or bedsores, which are extremely dangerous.  \n9.  I have and use a suprapubic catheter, because I am incontinent, that must be \nmonitored by home health every other week.    \n10.  I stay in bed for bowel movements and use pads.  I must be cleaned by someone \nelse, after each bowel movement.  Whoever is assisting me must also change the pads \nafter I have a bowel movement, to assure there are new pads in case I have an \naccident.  I cannot do anything to help with my toileting needs. \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 130 of 166\n\n11.  I cannot transfer myself from or to the bed or the wheelchair, and cannot even \nassist with the transfer. I must be transferred using a Hoyer lift, and it usually takes \ntwo people to assist me even with the Hoyer lift \n12.  I cannot perform any of my personal hygiene tasks, including bathing, washing \nmy face, brushing my teeth, combing my hair or shaving.  I am bathed while in bed, \nwhich means someone has to not only wash me, but also change the linens of my bed \nafter each bath. All of these tasks are done for me by someone else and all of them \nrequire a lot of time. \n13.  I use a feeding tube to eat and gain nourishment.  I can eat some soft foods by \nmouth, but someone must feed me.  If medications by mouth are prescribed, I must \ntake those through my feeding tube.  My family always uses my feeding tube to make \nsure I have enough fluids. \n14.  My head must be elevated or I tend to have seizures.  I am on medication to \nprevent the seizures and the medication seems to work fairly well.  However, if I am \nleft in a reclined position or left on my side for too long when being cleaned after a \nbowel movement, I have a tendency to have seizures.  I have a hospital bed that \nallows me to keep my head elevated.  \n15.  I have aphasia, which means that I have great difficulty talking and expressing \nmyself.  Because my family knows me well, they find ways to determine what I am \ntrying to tell them.  I have good receptive language skills, and understand what people \nare saying to me. \n16.  After becoming completely inactive after the stroke in December 2007, I have \ngained weight and currently weigh close to 400 pounds.  I must use an ambulance to \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 131 of 166\n\ntravel to and from the doctor’s office.  I do not have my own transportation, so I do \nnot go anywhere other than to the doctor’s office or to the emergency room, when \nneeded.    \n17.  I cannot cook, clean my home, do laundry, go grocery shopping or shop for \nclothes or incidentals.  I must depend on someone else to assure these tasks are \naccomplished. \n18.  I am, now, divorced after having been married for approximately twenty years.  \nMy ex-husband is not in touch with me, and I cannot even find him to force him to \npay child support. \n19.  I have a 17 year-old daughter who is a senior in the 2011-2012 school year.  She \nhas her license as a certified nursing assistant and works in a nursing home.  \nDepending on the demands of her school schedule and her workload at school, she \nmay or not work during her senior year. \n20.  My daughter does what she can to help me, but she is only seventeen years old \nand needs to live the life of a seventeen year old.  She should not have to stay home to \ntake care of her mother.  I want her to have the opportunities that other children have, \nand I want her to be happy. \n21.  My mother who lives nearby assists me some, typically at night, but she works \nfor the Tioga Heritage Park and Museum.  She is the only paid employee, so she must \nbe there whenever the museum is open and she must be there when there are special \nevents, or if workmen need to be met at the museum to do any repairs.  \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 132 of 166\n\n22.  My mother also cares for my father who has diabetes and a heart condition.  My \nfather is not able to walk well and needs some assistance with self-care.  My mother \nprovides all of this assistance for my father. \n23.  I have a brother that I haven’t seen in over two years. \n24.  I have a sister, who provides me with care as my paid provider, and also \nprovides me with care when she is not being paid.  This sister is looking for another \njob because she needs to earn more money.  Depending on the job she gets, I fear she \nwill not be as available to assist me. \n25.  Since I had the stroke, I am unable to visit as often with friends as I had done \nbefore, or do what I love, which is gardening.  However, I do still enjoy sitting \noutside whenever I have the opportunity, talk to neighbors, and enjoy the garden and \nthe outdoors.  I very much enjoy spending time with my family. \n26.  I am eligible for and receive Medicaid.  I receive $633 each month in Social \nSecurity Disability Insurance and I receive $61 in Supplemental Security Income. \n27.  I own the home that my daughter and I live in, and I do not want to give up my \nhome and be forced to enter a nursing home.   \n28.  If I am only provided with 32 hours per week, I will not be able to stay in my \nown home because my family will not be able to provide enough supplemental care to \nallow me to remain in my home and I will not receive the assistance I need to survive.   \n29.  I need more assistance than the 38 hours per week that I am currently receiving.  \nI am able to get by right now because my sister can put in extra time for which she is \nnot paid; however, as I said before, once she gets another job, I am not sure what I \nwill do. \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 133 of 166\n\n30.  I want to stay in my home and receive the support that I need.  I want the chance \nto watch my daughter grow into adulthood.  Right now, my daughter is still a \nteenager and does still need me.  I want to be sure I am there for her.  I do not want to \nbe forced into a nursing home, but I know that if I only received 32 hours of \nassistance each week, I will deteriorate and be forced into a nursing home. \n \n  8/26/11        /s/ S.M.         \nDate          S.M. \n \n  6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 134 of 166\n\nExhibit 14  Declaration of Daniel Renois, M.D.\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 135 of 166\n\nDECLARATION OF DANIEL RENOIS, MD \n  Daniel Renois, MD subscribes under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1746, as follows: \n1.  My name is Daniel Renois. I am a physician practicing Family Medicine in \nAlexandria, Louisiana. I am certified by the Board of Family Practice.  I graduated \nfrom medical school in 2003, and have been a practicing physician in Alexandria for \nover five years. \n2.  I have been treating S.M. for approximately three years.  Ms. M. had a stroke \napproximately four years ago, which left her physically incapacitated Ms. M. has no \nfunctional use of her arms or legs.  She cannot stand and cannot move herself. She is \nincontinent of bowel and bladder. Prior to the stroke she had damage to her spinal \ncord resulting from an accident when she was in her teens. She is also morbidly \nobese. \n3.  Ms. M. cannot perform her own personal care.  She must have full physical \nassistance in order to transfer, bathe, dress or tend to her hygiene needs.  She has a \nfeeding tube, which is used to not only assure she receives nourishment through food \nand fluids, but also to provide a mechanism for her to receive her medicine. \n4.  Ms. M. has a supra-pubic catheter that is monitored by a home health nurse every \ntwo weeks.  The bag that collects the urine; however, must be emptied several times \ndaily.  A larger bag can be used at night, but it must be emptied in the morning.   \n5.  Ms. M. does not have the physical capability to empty her own catheter bag and \nmust depend on someone else to perform this task.  It is extremely important that this \nbag be emptied or her urine can back up causing a spike in blood pressure that can \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 136 of 166\n\nlead to autonomic dysreflexia, a life-threatening condition.  Ms. M. is prescribed a \nprophylactic antibiotic to prevent urinary tract infections. \n6.  Ms. M. also has seizures and should have a caregiver that knows her to identify \nwhen a seizure is occurring, and to reposition Ms. M., when needed, to prevent \nseizure activity. \n7.  It is my understanding that Ms. M. lives with her seventeen-year old daughter \nand they are the sole occupants of the home.  Ms. M. cannot prepare food, clean the \nhome, do laundry, go shopping, or write a check to pay her bills.  She needs complete \nassistance with these tasks \n8.  Ms. M. needs personal care services to continue living in her home.  Without the \nservices, I do not think she would have any other options other than a nursing home. \n9.  Ms. M. has difficulty with expressive speech as a result of the stroke, which \nmeans that she needs a caregiver with patience and time to attend to understanding \nher requests.  If Ms. M. were to receive services in a nursing home, I do not believe \nthat staff would have the time required to understand what Ms. M. is saying.   \n10.  It is my understanding that Ms. M. is currently receiving thirty-eight hours per \nweek of Long-term Personal Care Services.  It is my opinion that she needs at least \nthat amount of home care to remain at home and remain healthy. If Ms. M. has less \ncare, I would have concerns that she would possibly not get meals timely, she would \nnot be changed after accidents, and her catheter bag would not be emptied, timely \n11.  If Ms. M. were to receive fewer hours of services in the home, it is quite possible \nthat her health would deteriorate rapidly, and that she would require much more care \nthan she does at present. \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 137 of 166\n\n12.  I do not believe that Ms. M. would receive the proper care if she were in a \nnursing facility.  I believe the one to one care that Ms. M. receives is much better for \nher physical needs, as well as her cognitive and emotional needs.  \n \n  8/24/11            /s/Daniel Renois M.D.   \nDate              Daniel Renois, MD \n \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 138 of 166\n\nExhibit 15  Declaration of L.M.\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 139 of 166\n\nDECLARATION OF L.M. \nL.M. subscribes under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, as follows: \n1.  My name is L.M.  I am forty-four years old and I live with my son, E.B., in Baton \nRouge, Louisiana.  E. and I are the only members of our household. \n2.  I work full-time for the city of Baton Rouge in the Department of Public Works, \ninspecting sewer and water line repairs.  My job hours vary, as the outdoor work \ncrews take advantage of long days in summer.  During the summer, I am working \nfrom 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, and either one or two days \nevery other weekend.  It takes me approximately 1 hours to commute to my job \non weekdays, and approximately 15 to 30 minutes to commute home, so I must be \nabsent from the home from about 6:30 a.m. to 5:45 or 6:00 p.m., Monday through \nFriday, and for approximately ten hours every other weekend.  There is no one to \ntake care of E. while I am at work, other than a paid personal care worker.  \n3.  I have had to take off so much work in the last two years that I have only \napproximately 16 hours of leave time left.  I need my job to support myself and \nmy son.   \n4.  My son, E. B. is twenty-five years old.  On July 10, 2008, he was in a car accident \nand incurred a traumatic brain injury.  He was in a coma for 22 days.  After the \naccident he was in Our Lady of the Lake Hospital until September 9, 2008, when \nhe was moved to Touro Rehabilitation Center in New Orleans, Louisiana.  He was \ndischarged to my home in December of 2008. \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 140 of 166\n\n5.  At the time of the accident, E. was living independently and working full-time.  \nHe had a five and a half month old son, E. B., Jr.  Now, he cannot take perform of \nany of his self-care, much less care for his son. \n6.  E.’s injuries have left him with very little ability to communicate. He usually does \nnot understand what is said to him, and he can only speak one or two words.  \nEvery now and then, if he is asked a question, he will respond with “yes” or “no”, \nbut if you ask him the question more than once the answer is not consistent, and \nhis answer often wrong. \n7.  He has no functional use of his arms and very limited use of his legs. \n8.  He cannot use his left hand or arm at all. He can now bend his right arm, but \ncannot use his hand to grip objects or do any tasks.  My understanding is that he \nhas developed calcium deposits in his joints that cause his limbs to be stiff.  On \nJune 22, 2011, he had surgery on his right arm to remove the deposits and enable \nhim to bend his arm.  He had to have an additional surgery to repair some damage \non August 2, 2011.  The doctors have told me that it will take three to six months \nbefore they will know if the surgery was successful.  \n9.  Since the surgery on his right arm, he has had to have his right arm strapped into a \nContinuous Passive Motion (“CPM”) machine every day.  The machine \nmechanically bends his arm and straightens it out.  His arm is supposed to be in \nthe machine for six hours, then he takes a two-hour break, and is then he is back \non the machine for another six hours.  He needs assistance to be strapped into the \nmachine. When on the machine, he must be in bed or in a chair set up next to the \nmachine. The motion is often painful, and E. sometimes becomes agitated and \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 141 of 166\n\ntries to get his arm out of the machine.  This is how he damaged his arm after the \nsurgery, necessitating corrective surgery on August 2.  Either his worker or I must \nconstantly remind and physically assist him to remain on the machine as \nprescribed by his doctor. \n10. The brain injury has left E. unable to provide any care for himself.  He cannot get \nin or out of bed on his own, he cannot dress himself, and he cannot brush his own \nteeth or hair.  \n11. E. does not have control of his bowels or his bladder, so he uses adult diapers.  \nHis doctor has recommended that E. receive a tub bath daily to help prevent staff \ninfections.  It takes his worker approximately 55 minutes each day to bathe him.  \nOften E. will try to scratch himself through the diaper, which results in the diaper \nbeing moved and the bed getting soiled.  This creates a need for laundry to be \ndone and sheets to be changed at least twice each day. \n12. E. cannot feed himself.  Since the accident, E. is using a feeding tube.  He cannot \nchew food or swallow properly, so he must be given all nourishment and fluids \nthrough a tube that goes directly to his stomach.  My son cannot even experience \nthe joy of a good meal any longer.  Having the PEG tube is another reason that the \ndoctor recommends daily tub baths. \n13. E. has very poor balance and can only walk a few steps before falling.  His gait is \nextremely unsteady.  Some one must hold on to him while he walks.  He cannot \nuse a walker because he cannot use his hands to grip the walker, and because of \nhis balance and gait problems. When he has to travel more than a few steps, he \nuses a wheelchair.  However, he cannot get into and out of the wheelchair without \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 142 of 166\n\nphysical assistance, and he cannot use his hands and arms to propel the \nwheelchair.  Someone must push the wheelchair for him.  \n14. E. cannot perform any household chores and cannot prepare the formula for his \nfeeding tube.  Either his worker or I must prepare the formula for the feeding \ntube, and I must attach the bag to the feeding tube.  \n15. E.’s worker must accompany to his therapy appointments and doctors’ \nappointments, because they take place when I am at work.  He attends physical \ntherapy occupational therapy three times a week.  The appointments are in the \nsame building.  He also receives speech therapy three times each week. His \npersonal care worker typically accompanies him to these appointments because \nthey take place when I am at work.  Each therapy appointment takes one hour, \nand it takes approximately 40 minutes round trip to take him to the physical and \noccupational therapy clinic, and approximately 30 minutes round trip to take him \nto the speech therapy clinic.  Thus, just his therapy appointments take the personal \ncare worker 18.5 hours a week. I am not willing to cancel the therapy \nappointments because it is very important that he receive these services since his \ndoctors believe he may still recover some function, but only if he continues the \ntherapy. \n16. With the reduction in E.’s LT-PCS hours from 42 to 32, his LT-PCS worker has \nsaid that she sometimes does not have time to bathe E. as recommended by the \ndoctor.  In addition, she may not have time to do the laundry that has been soiled.   \n17. My son has seizures approximately two to three times each month as a result of \nthe brain injury. He is on seizure medications, but the medication does not \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 143 of 166\n\ncompletely control the seizures.  He cannot report these to the doctor himself, so \neither his LT-PCS worker or I need to be able to observe him and report seizures \nto his doctor.   \n18. E. also has problems with judgment and memory since the accident.  He does not \nalways have a clear understanding of what he can and cannot do.  He will try to \nget out of bed or a chair if no one is with him and he will fall after taking only a \ncouple of steps.  He needs physical assistance with walking and transferring for \nhis own safety. \n19. I applied for Long-term Personal Care Services for E. when he came home from \nTouro Rehabilitation Center in December of 2008 and he began receiving services \nin January of 2009.  In 2009, he was awarded 42 hours per week.   and received \n42 hours per week until June 14, 2011, when his hours were reduced to 32 hours \nper week. \n20. At some point in 2010, I was notified that E.’s hours had been reduced to 32 hours \nper week.  I appealed that reduction, and while the case was on appeal, his hours \nstayed at 42 per week.  I was notified that I won the appeal, but almost \nimmediately, he was reassessed and his hours reduced to 32 per week. To the best \nof my knowledge, he started receiving 32 hours of LT-PCS a week starting on \nJune 6, 2011. \n21. I contacted the Advocacy Center in August of 2011 about trying to get additional \nLT-PCS for E..  It was through the Advocacy Center that I learned that I could \napply for an emergency EDA waiver slot for E..  I was not notified in any way by \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 144 of 166\n\nthe Department of Health and Hospitals of the availability of emergency EDA \nwaiver slots. \n22. I believe my son’s ability to understand and communicate has improved since the \naccident.  However, his physical condition and his need for care has not changed \nfrom the time that his services began to the time his hours were reduced.  He \ncontinues to require the same care with all activities of daily living that he has \nneeded since returning from the hospital. \n23. Since June of 2011 when the services were reduced, I have had take off work, and \nhave had to pay out of pocket for someone to care for E. when I am not able to be \nat home.  I will not be able to continue to make these financial contributions much \nlonger.  In addition to the missed work and the out-of-pocket expenses for care \nservices, I must pay over $300 per month for his diapers and gloves needed to \nhandle his PEG tube and diapers. \n24. E. used to enjoy spending time with his friends when he wasn’t working.  Now, \nhe has very few friends, but does still enjoy seeing his best friend.  However, he \ncannot drive, and he must depend on me to have the time to bring him to see his \nfriend.  Because of my work schedule and the time I spend caring for E., I have \nlittle time to help E. see his friends and family members. \n25. He is still able to see his son, and I can tell by the joy on his face that these times \nmake him very happy. \n26. E. has no family available to help other than me.  He has one sister who is an \nadult, but she works full time. In addition, she lives with and cares for my aging \nparents.  My father recently had a stroke and my daughter has become his primary \n  6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 145 of 166\n\ncaregiver.  My father is eighty-four years old and my mother is seventy-six years \nold.   \n27. E. has been determined eligible for services through the Capitol Area Human \nServices District.  In 2010 he started receiving funding that enabled me to pay a \npersonal care worker for an additional ten hours a week, but at the end of June \n2011, these services were discontinued.  I have requested that the services \ncontinue, but a representative from Capitol Area Human Services District told me \nthat their funds were limited and that they would not be able to continue this \nfunding for E..  \n28. E. is too young to enter a nursing home, and I will do everything I can to prevent \nthat from happening. However, if I quit my job, we will not have the income \nneeded to sustain our home.  As it is now, I do not have much leave left, and am \nhaving to take leave more often to assure that someone is with E.. \n29. I want E. to remain at home with me, where he is happy, is making progress in \nunderstanding and communicating, and gets to see his family and friends \noccasionally.  I am willing to continue doing what I can do, but he cannot make it \nif all he will receive is thirty-two hours per week.  E. deserves to be able to stay \nhome with me, and that is where I want him.  I do not want him to go to a nursing \nhome. \n \n  /s/L.M.

My name is Vasanthi Vinayagam and I am a licensed physician practicing in \nBaton Rouge, Louisiana since 1979.  I received by medical degree in 1985 .  I \ncompleted my residency in Family Practice at Baton Rouge General Medical Center. \nI am Board Certified in Family Practice. \n2.  I am affiliated with Lane Regional Medical Center, Baton Rouge General \nMedical Center, and Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center. \n3.  I have been treating E. B. at the Primary Care Group for approximately one year. \n4.  In 2008 Mr. B. suffered a traumatic brain injury as the result of a car accident.  \nHis injury has left him with little functional use of his arms and legs, and has resulted \nin him having to use a PEG tube to receive nourishment.  In addition, he has a seizure \ndisorder which seems to be a result of the traumatic brain injury. \n5.  Mr. B. is incontinent of bowel and bladder and uses adult diapers on a daily \nbasis.  The diapers must be changed whenever soiled, and Mr. B. must be thoroughly \ncleaned to prevent skin breakdowns.  Mr. B. is not able to tend to any of his toileting \nneeds and must depend on others to do this. \n6.  Mr. B. cannot transfer from a sitting to a standing position or from a standing to \na sitting position without assistance. He must have physical assistance to get in and \nout of bed.  \n7.  Mr. B. does not have stability and has poor equilibrium, so will not be able to \nstand up straight for more than a couple of steps.  He needs weight-bearing assistance \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 148 of 166\n\nto ambulate.  He is not able to use a walker because of his inability to use his hands \nand arms.  He cannot propel himself in a wheechair. \n8.  Based on Mr. B. inability to functionally use his hands, arms or legs, he needs \nfull help dressing and undressing, as well as bathing.  I recommend that he be bathed \nin the tub daily because of his use of diapers and because of his PEG tube.  The area \nwhere the catheter is inserted into the stomach must be cleaned thoroughly on a daily \nbasis. \n9.  Mr. B.’ traumatic brain injury also left him with poor judgment, impaired short \nand long term memory, and problems with expressive and receptive speech. \n10.  Due to Mr. B. physical impairments, as well as cognitive impairments, he cannot \nperform any household chore activities. \n11.  Mr. B. had surgery on his right arm in June of 2011 to enable him to bend his \narm.  He had to have an additional surgery to repair some damage on August 2, 2011.   \n12.  His surgeon has prescribed use of a Continuous Passive Motion (“CPM”) \nmachine every day.  The machine mechanically bends his arm and straightens it out.  \nHis arm is supposed to be in the machine for six hours, then he takes a two-hour \nbreak, and is then he is back on the machine for another six hours.  He needs \nassistance to be strapped into the machine. He must be assisted into and out of the \nCPM machine and must be reminded to continue to use it.  \n13.  Mr. B. has seizures as a result of his brain injuries.  These are only partially \ncontrolled with medication.  It is important for someone to be with him to be able to \nrecognize when he is having a seizure, ensuring that he is safe, and reporr the seizure \nto me so that I can adjust his medication if needed.  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 149 of 166\n\n14.  Mr. B. needs physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy three \ntimes a week to assist him in rehabilitating from his injuries.  He must be \naccompanied to these appointments. \n15.   It is my understanding that, presently, Mr. B. is only receiving thirty-two hours \nof assistance per month.   He needs more assistance to ensure that he can remain at \nhis current level of functioning. \n16.  Mr. B. should be able to remain at home, and can do so with adequate personal \ncare assistance. \n \n/s/ Vasanthi Vinayagam, M.D.        9/8/11    \nVasanthi Vinayagam, M.D.          Date \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 150 of 166\n\nExhibit 17  Declaration of Donna Zeno\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 151 of 166\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 152 of 166\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 153 of 166\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 154 of 166\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 155 of 166\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 156 of 166\n\nExhibit 18  Declaration of Lisa Richards, M.D.\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 157 of 166\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 158 of 166\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 159 of 166\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 160 of 166\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n \n________________________     \n            * \nKenneth Roman, Rickii Ainey, and    * \nElizabeth Foster, on behalf of  themselves  *  C.A.

It appears to the Court that the motion \nhas merit and that members of the Plaintiff class will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, in \nthat they will be deprived of the in-home services and supports that are necessary for them to \ncontinue to live in their own homes and communities, which is the most integrated setting \nappropriate for them; and the deprivation of these services will lead to a decline in their health, \nsafety, or welfare, leading to their eventual placement in institutions.   \n  It is therefore: \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 164 of 166\n\n  ORDERED that Defendants, the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals Bruce \nGreenstein, Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health  and Hospitals, in his official \ncapacity, are enjoined:  \n1.  From reducing the LT-PCS services of class members, whose services have not yet been \nreduced to the 32-hour maximum, below their current level; \n2.  To provide a process for class members to obtain LT-PCS or alternative home-based services \nabove the 32-hour cap, which shall include: \n(a)  Providing LT-PCS or alternative home and community-based services in excess of 32 \nhours a week to individuals who need more than 32 hours to avoid a decline in health, \nsafety,  or  welfare  that  will  lead  to  the  individual’s  eventual  placement  in  an \ninstitution; \n(b)  Maintaining services at their current level until Defendants have acted on applications \nfor LT-PCS or alternative home and community-based services in excess of 32 hours \na week;  \n(c)  For class members whose services have already been reduced, who apply for services \nin excess of 32 hours a week, restoring services to their previous level until \nDefendants have acted on their applications; \n(d)  Notifying persons who have been approved for less than 32 hours a week of LT-PCS \nof the availability of services in excess of 32 hours a week and affording them an \nopportunity to apply for them; and \n(e)  If the person is found to be in need of services in excess of 32 hours a week, \nmaintaining their LT-PCS hours at the level that they had prior to the application of \nthe September 5, 2010 rule until they begin to such additional services. \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 165 of 166\n\n  It further appears that to the Court that granting this relief will not cause substantial harm \nor the public interest.  \n  Plaintiffs are low-income persons for whom the posting of a bond would be a hardship. \nTherefore, no security is required of them. \n  SIGNED the      day of       , 2011 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. \n \n \n              _________________________________ \n              UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n               \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 75     09/28/11   Page 166 of 166",

A settlement has been proposed in Pitts v. Greenstein, \n10-cv-635, that affects some Louisiana residents who are receiving long-term personal care \nservices (LT-PCS) through the Medicaid program. \n \nDoes this notice apply to you? \n \n1.  This settlement only applies to persons who were approved to receive more than 32 hours \nof services through Louisiana’s Long-Term Personal Case Services (LT-PCS) program as \nof September 5, 2010, and who are still approved to receive LT-PCS or who have a \nrequest for prior authorization pending or in process. \n \nWhat is this lawsuit about? \n \n2.  This lawsuit challenges the reduction in maximum hours of services under Louisiana’s \nLong-Term Personal Care Services program, which provides services funded by \nLouisiana Medicaid to eligible individuals in their homes. It claims that this reduction \ncould lead to people having to enter nursing facilities, because they are not able to receive \nenough care at home.  \n \nWhat are the key terms of the Settlement Agreement? \n \n3.  Under the Settlement Agreement, class members may apply for an expedited Community \nChoices Waiver slot.  Class members who are not currently approved to receive at least \n32 hours must request a slot before June 30, 2012 in order to be considered.  To get an \nexpedited offer, a class member must show that without the additional services the waiver \nprovides, he or she will not be able maintain his or her mental or physical health and is at \nserious risk of having to go into a nursing home. \n \n4.  The parties have agreed to ask the Court to approve $250,000 as the award to class \ncounsel for attorney’s fees and costs incurred for work on this case. \n \nWhat can you do next? \n \n5.  If you agree with the Settlement Agreement, you do not have to do anything. \n \n6.  If you disagree with any part of the Settlement Agreement and you want to tell the judge, \nyou have to do these things: \n \n-  You must write a letter to the judge.

No. 3:10-cv-00635-JJB-SCR \n*       \n  PLAINTIFFS       *         \n            *  JUDGE JAMES J.

RIEDLINGER \n*   \n            *  CLASS ACTION \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY TO DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE IN \nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n  To require people with disabilities who need more than 32 hours of LT-PCS to go \ninto nursing homes in order to access sufficient personal care service is segregation and \ndiscrimination that violates their rights under the ADA.  When cuts are made to \ncommunity-based programs, States must insure that the alternative services needed to \navoid institutionalization are actually (not merely theoretically) available.1   \n  While Defendants’ response suggests that they have accomplished this, the \nreality, for most class members, is that they still must actually be admitted to a nursing \nfacility in order to immediately access the care they need, whether in the community (by \nway of an immediate waiver slot offer2) or in a nursing facility. The circumstances of the \nnamed plaintiffs and class members set forth in their own and their physicians’ \ndeclarations, undisputed by Defendants, show that they need more than 32 hours of \n                                                 \n1 Exhibit 19, Statement of the Department of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate \nof Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Olmstead v. L.C., p. 3, question 9:  “Can \nbudget cuts violate the ADA and Olmstead?,” http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm \n(last visited November 9, 2011). \n2 While this motion was pending, the name of the waiver program that would provide sufficient \nhome-based services for class members was changed from the Elderly and Disabled Adult waiver \nto the Community Choice waiver.  Plaintiffs will refer to this waiver as the CC waiver.  \nReferences in previous pleadings to the EDA waiver apply to the CC waiver. \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 1 of 202\n\npersonal care services to remain safely in their homes and to avoid institutionalization. \nDefendants have voluntarily, and temporarily, extended their services. To require \nDefendants to provide a process by which this can be done for similarly-situated class \nmembers while this action is pending would not fundamentally alter Defendants’ \nprograms—indeed, this can be accomplished by a reasonable expansion of steps \nDefendants have already taken. \n  When, following class certification, Defendants promulgated a new rule providing \nfor emergency waiver opportunities for class members,3 Plaintiffs hoped that this would \nobviate the need for preliminary injunctive relief. However, Plaintiffs have learned that \nthe opportunities under this policy are far too limited to provide for class members with \nthe services they need pending trial on the merits. \n1.  Class members are at risk \n  The detailed declarations of named plaintiffs, class members, and their doctors \nand nurses show the risks to which the reduction in services subjects the class in this \ncase.  While none of them have sought admission to nursing facilities, the risks they run \nare real and immediate.  They risk not being cleaned after incontinence episodes because \nno one is there to change them.4  They risk missing meals or being bathed.5  They risk \n                                                 \n3 Exhibit 20 37 La. Reg. 1490-91 (June 20, 2011) (amending La. Admin. Code tit. 50, §8105). \n4 Exhibit 5, Declaration of E.M.S., ¶15; Exhibit 21, Declaration of Mary Dunn, ¶16; Exhibit 22, \nDeclaration of Bessie Foreman, ¶16; Exhibit 23, Declaration of Estelle Curtain, ¶11 and 12. \n5 Exhibit 5, Declaration of E.M.S., ¶¶19, 21; Exhibit 7, Declaration of C.D., ¶23; Exhibit 8, \nDeclaration of Lecy Broussard, ¶8; Exhibit 9, Declaration of I.M.L., ¶¶20, 21, 27; Exhibit 10, \nDeclaration of Scharmaine Baker, ¶9; Exhibit 11, Declaration of V.U.S. ¶17; Exhibit 12, \nDeclaration of Cherie Drez, M.D. ¶13; Exhibit 13, Declaration of S.M. ¶7; Exhibit 14, \nDeclaration of Daniel Renois, M.D. ¶10; Exhibit 15, Declaration of L.M. ¶16; Exhibit 21, \nDeclaration of Mary Dunn, ¶¶19, 25; Exhibit 22, Declaration of Bessie Foreman, ¶¶13, 14; \nExhibit 23, Declaration of Estelle Curtain, ¶18, 20. \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 2 of 202\n\nhaving to limit their fluid intake so that they will not have to urinate as often.6 They risk \nfalling if no one is with them to assist them with transferring.7 They risk having to remain \nin bed even during the day after their worker leaves, because no one will be available to \nput them to bed later.8 These are exactly the types of unmet needs that studies have \nshown lead to death, institutionalization, injury, or worsening health in people with \ndisabilities.9   \n  The defendants have voluntarily extended LT-PCS services at their pre-\nSeptember 2010 levels for these class members, through February 29, 2012.10  This case \nwill probably not be tried before that date, so these class members have no assurance that \nthey will continue to receive the services they need without the intervention of this Court. \nFurther, here is no reason to think that all class members know to contact the Advocacy \nCenter so that class counsel can request a voluntary extension of their services until next \nFebruary. This Court must intervene to prevent irreparable harm, through the denial of \nmedically necessary services, to the class. \n2.  The steps Defendants have taken to date are not sufficient to prevent irreparable harm \nto class members \n \n  While Defendants persuasively extol recent changes to their programs, these \nchanges do not alter the situation facing many class members:  in order to obtain enough \npersonal care service to remain safely at home, without experiencing a years-long wait, \nthey must be first admitted to a nursing facility.   \n                                                 \n6 Exhibit 7, Declaration of C.D., ¶23; Exhibit 8, Declaration of Lecy Broussard, ¶8 \n7 Exhibit 10, Declaration of Scharmaine Baker, ¶9; Exhibit 21, Declaration of Mary Dunn ¶23; \nExhibit 23, Declaration of Estelle Curtain, ¶14. \n8 Exhibit 5, Declaration of E.M.S., ¶¶19, 21; Exhibit 7, Declaration of C.D., ¶23; Exhibit 8, \nDeclaration of Lecy Broussard, ¶8; Exhibit 9, Declaration of I.M.L., ¶¶20, 21, 27; Exhibit 10, \nDeclaration of Scharmaine Baker, ¶9; Exhibit 11, Declaration of V.U.S. ¶17. \n9 See Exhibit 24, Declaration of Mitchell LaPlante ¶¶ 10-17 (Rec.

The replacement of the EDA waiver with the CC waiver \n  This is not a new development. Though approval from CMS for the CC Waiver \nonly came through in October of 2011, Defendants bruited this revamp in connection \nwith their motion to dismiss and for summary judgment.11  As Plaintiffs pointed out \nthen,12 the changes in the CC waiver will add services for people who are already on the \nwaiver, but since the CC waiver will add no new waiver slots, by itself it will do nothing \nto reduce the lengthy wait for adequate community services that is the central problem \nfacing the class. \nB.  Creation of a process for granting expedited waiver slots \n  The process for granting expedited CC waiver slots for some class members (the \nJuly 2011 Emergency Rule) is indeed a positive development.  Its adoption, and the fact \nthat several of the individuals who have been brought to Defendants’ attention in this \naction have received waiver slots under the program, shows that an exception to \nDefendants’ rules that will offer expedited services to class members is indeed workable.  \n  However, the current rules and procedures limit this program so that it cannot \nhelp many class members. \n1.  Class members who are not approved to receive at least 32 hours a week cannot even \napply for these slots.  \n \n  According to the Third Declaration of Hugh Eley, ¶7, 13 approximately 2,000 of \nthe 2,900 persons who are now receiving LT-PCS, who have had their hours reduced \nfrom above 32 hours a week, had them reduced to less than 32 hours.  These individuals \n                                                 \n11 Memorandum in Support of the Motion to Dismiss (Rec Doc 11-1) p. 11; Defendants’ Reply to \nPlaintiffs’ Response to Motion for Summary Judgment (Rec.

About 375 individuals have not yet \nhad the 32-hour cap applied to them. \n  Contrary to Defendants’ contention, the class in this case is not limited to \nindividuals who are currently approved to receive exactly 32 hours of LT-PCS a week.  \nThe class definition is as follows: \nLouisiana  residents  with  disabilities  who  have  been  receiving \nMedicaid-funded  services  through  the  LT-PCS  program;  who \ndesire to reside in the community instead of a nursing facility; who \nrequire  more  than  32  hours  of  Medicaid-funded  personal  care \nservices per week in order to avoid entering a nursing facility, and \nwho do not have available (including through family supports, \nshared living arrangements, or enrollment in the ADHC waiver) \nother means of receiving personal care services.14  \n  \n  Also contrary to Defendants’ assertions, at pp. 16-17 and n. 10 of their Response, \nclass members who are receiving less than 32 hours of care are affected by the 32-hour \ncap. Because of it, they cannot access the expedited waiver slots through the existing \nappeals process. \n  This was recently demonstrated in the case of R.M., a twenty-six-year-old woman \nwith severe disabilities caused by a traumatic brain injury in 2003. Her father has \nsubmitted a detailed declaration concerning her disabilities and needs. 15  \n  R.M. had been receiving 36.5 hours of LT-PCS for at least the last two years prior \nto May of 2011.16  In May, she was reassessed under the September 2010 rule that is \nchallenged here.  Though her abilities had declined since her last assessment, she was \napproved for only 29 hours of LT-PCS 2011, because her “ADL index” (explained \n                                                 \n14 Ruling on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (Rec. Doc. 58, June 6, 2011) pp. 5-6. \n15 Exhibit 25, Declaration of C.M, ¶¶ 2-9, 17; Attachment B to Declaration of C.M. (letter dated \nAugust 8. 2011 from Mario Moreno, M.D.) \n16 Exhibit 25, Declaration of C.M., ¶12. \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 5 of 202\n\nbelow) only came out to 11.17  Her application for an emergency waiver slot was denied \nbecause she was not approved to receive exactly 32 hours.18   \n  When she attempted to use the appeals process to appeal the award of only 29 \nhours, arguing that she needed more than 32 hours of LT-PCS to avoid placement in a \nnursing home, and that she had to be approved for 32 hours in order to be able to apply \nfor an emergency waiver slot, the Administrative Law Judge denied her appeal on the \ngrounds that the maximum amount of LT-PCS that could be awarded, 32 hours, would \nnot be sufficient to keep Ms. M. from having to enter a nursing home.  In her appeal, Ms. \nM. showed that her family cannot physically or emotionally cope with any additional \ncaregiving, and cannot go on paying out of pocket for the 8 to 10 hours of care a week \nthat have been taken away. She presented evidence that her parents have already taken \nsteps to determine her eligibility for nursing home services, in preparation for admitting \nher to a nursing home if additional hours of LT-PCS are not provided.  R.M.’s doctor is \nalso concerned that the decrease in R.M.’s service hours could force the family to seek \nnursing home placement, as she is in constant need of care and supervision. He expressed \nconcern that her health could deteriorate if she is not provided with more than 32 hours a \nweek of care.19 \n  The Administrative Law Judge credited this evidence, yet specifically held: \n…Although Appellant’s representative presented credible evidence that Appellant \nrequires additional hours, the LT-PCS program is limited to 32 hours a week. \nLouisiana Register 36:2818.  Both Appellant’s representative and her doctor have \nstated that thirty-two hours a week of LT-PCS will not be enough to prevent \nAppellant from entering a nursing facility.  Therefore Appellant failed to show \nthat obtaining additional hours per week of LT-PCS will avoid her entering into a \nnursing facility. \n                                                 \n17 Id. ¶¶ 13, 14. \n18 Id. ¶16. \n19 Id. ¶17, 18 and Attachments B and C. \n  6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 6 of 202\n\n   The Department correctly held that Appellant is entitled to twenty-nine hours a \nweek of LT-PCS.20 \n \n  Thus Ms. M., and other class members who were awarded less than exactly 32 \nhours under the September 2010 rule, are caught in a classic Catch-22:  they cannot \nobtain the hours of care that they need to remain out of a nursing facility unless they \nreceive an emergency waiver slot, but they cannot succeed in appealing the 32 hours of \ncare they need in order to apply for an emergency waiver slot because they need more \nthan the 32 hour maximum to stay out of a nursing home.  Any appeal for 32 hours, for a \nperson who needs more than 32 hours to remain in his or her home, would be futile. \n  Lest the Court believe that individuals who are approved to receive less than 32 \nhours of services a week do not have severe disabilities, and cannot require more than 32 \nhours of care to remain safely in their homes, Plaintiffs would remind the Court that, in \norder to even qualify for the LT-PCS program, recipients must meet a nursing facility \n“level of care,” and must demonstrate that they “face a substantial possibility of \ndeterioration in mental or physical condition or functioning if either home and \ncommunity-based services or nursing facility services are not provided in less than 120 \ndays.”21 This “imminent risk” determination requires the administration of stringent \ncriteria, and can be satisfied by a statement from a physician that the person is at \nsubstantial risk of nursing home placement or mental or physical deterioration if he or she \ndoes not receive home- and community-based services within 120 days.22   \nSince September of 2010, the determination of how many hours of LT-PCS a \n                                                 \n20 Attachment C to Exhibit 25, Declaration of C.M., p. 5. \n21 See Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment (Rec.

The index does not include \ninformation obtained on Defendants’ assessment instruments about what are termed \n“instrumental activities of daily living” or “IADL’s” (meal preparation, housework, \nmanaging finances, managing medications, using the phone, shopping, or transportation).  \nThe index similarly ignores data that is collected in Defendants’ assessment instruments \non each recipient25 about such crucial factors as cognitive impairments; difficulty with \nvision, hearing, or communicating; behavioral symptoms; bladder and bowel continence; \ndisease diagnoses; health problems such as diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, shortness of \nbreath, edema, delusions, and hallucinations; exent of pain; falls; nutritional status (unless \nthe person is tube-fed); presence or absence of pressure sores; the number and types of \nmedication the person takes; and, most importantly, how much informal support the \nperson has.   \nPeople are not eligible to receive 32 hours a week of LT-PCS under this \nmethodology unless they score at least a 14 on the ADL index.

Therefore, mathematically, to qualify for the maximum of 32 hours, a \nperson would have to score at least 4 in two of these areas, and 3 in two others; or 4 in \nthree areas, and 2 in one other.26 \n  Examples of class members who have scored less than a 14 on the ADL index, \nand thus have been approved for fewer than 32 hours a week of LT-PCS, are P.M. (Paula \nMarshall), E.M.S. (Eddie Mae Shaw), C.D., R.M., Mary Dunn, Bessie Foreman, and \nEstelle Curtain.

Because of a fall \nshe experienced as a result of her attempting to transfer to her bedside commode \nunattended, she has a fracture in her hip.29  \n  Until June of this year, she was receiving 38 hours a week of LT-PCS.

She was not notified that if she appealed and \nreceived 32 hours, she would be eligible to apply for an emergency waiver slot.31 She \nneeds 38 to 40 hours of LT-PCS to remain in her own home.32 \n  As her declaration details, 32 hours of personal care a week is not enough for a \nworker to handle all of Ms. Dunn’s personal care, meal preparation, housework, and \naccompanying to medical appointments, so she is sometimes forced to miss meals and \nskip hygiene tasks.33 Since her hours were reduced, she has had incontinence “accidents” \nwhen her worker was not there, and has had to wait for many hours for her worker to \nchange and clean her.34  \n  Ms. Dunn’s declaration, and that of Emile A. Barrow, Jr., the Board-certified \ncardiologist who has treated her for the last 24 years, establish that it is medically \nnecessary for Ms. Dunn to receive more than thirty-two hours per week to live safely in \nher home.  Dr. Barrow stated unequivocally that in his professional medical opinion, if \nMs. Dunn’s hours are not increased, her condition will deteriorate quickly, and she will \nhave to consider going into a nursing facility.35   \nBessie Foreman \n  Bessie Foreman is 86 years old and lives alone in Iowa, Louisiana.36 She has a \nsubmitted a detailed declaration. \n                                                 \n31 Id. ¶5, 6. \n32 Id. at ¶7. \n33 Id. ¶¶8-22, 25. \n34 Id. ¶24. \n35 Exhibit 35, Declaration of Emile A.

She filed an \nappeal of that decision.  On or about May 1, 2011, her hours were reduced to thirty-two \nhours per week pending the appeal hearing.37  The hearing was held by phone and Ms. \nForeman could not participate because she cannot hear.  The decision on appeal was to \nuphold the Department’s reduction of her hours to 26.38  The appeal hearing was held \nprior to the Department’s implementation of the new emergency waiver rule, but because \nher hours were reduced to under 32 per week, Ms. Foreman will not be able to apply for a \nwaiver slot unless this Court requires it. \n  As her declaration details, 32 hours a week is insufficient to provide for the home \ncare Ms. Foreman needs.  Since her LT-PCS hours have been reduced, Ms. Foreman has \nhad to cut down on meals, is no longer able to have a bath daily, and often has to wait for \nextended periods without being cleaned after bowel or bladder accidents.39  Her daughter, \nwho lives 30 miles away and works two jobs, is currently helping her, but she cannot \ncontinue to provide this help on a daily basis.40 \nEstelle Curtain \n  Estelle Curtain is 58 years old and lives alone in Baton Rouge.41  She has \nsubmitted a detailed declaration. \n  Until she was reassessed in 2011, Ms. Curtain was receiving 37.25 hours of LT-\nPCS a week.  At the time she was notified that her hours would be reduced to 29 per \nweek, she did not know about the Advocacy Center.  She tried to appeal the reduction, \n                                                 \n37 Id. ¶3, \n38 Id. ¶4.  \n39 Id. ¶¶13, 14, and 16. \n40 Id. ¶¶9 and 10. \n41 Exhibit 23, Declaration of Estelle Curtain ¶1.  \n  11 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 11 of 202\n\nbut the appeals agency told her that they could not find her paperwork.  Her hours were \nreduced to 29 in mid-June of 2011, prior to the July 2011 emergency rule.42  \n  After her hours were reduced (and before they were restored in October by \nrequest from the Advocacy Center), Ms. Curtain had to sit or lie in wet diapers or bed \npads for many hours because her worker was not there to change her.43  Her worker did \nnot have time to do her laundry for days at a time, which forced her to live in unclean and \nunsanitary conditions.44 Her nutrition suffered, and she began experiencing a recurrence \nof symptoms of depression.45 \n  When class members appeal cuts in service to below 32 hours a week, they can \nonly receive continued benefits while appeals are pending of up to 32 hours a week. It \ntypically takes the agency several months to decide an appeal.46 \n2.  It is likely that more than 100 class members need emergency waiver slots \n \n  Though Defendants state that they will request 500 additional waiver slots to \naccommodate class members and others on the years-long waiting list for waiver \nservices, there is no assurance that this request will be funded, or even make it into the \nExecutive Budget.47  One hundred slots may or may not be sufficient to provide \n                                                 \n42 Id. ¶¶2-4. \n43 Id. ¶14. \n44 Id. ¶15 \n45 Id. ¶¶25, 28. \n46 In response to discovery requests, Defendants have provided Plaintiffs with a spreadsheet \nlisting the dates and dispositions of appeals of reductions in LT-PCS since September 5, 2010.  \nThree hundred appeals have been decided, and the agency took an average of 68 days to decide \nthem.  The maximum number of days a decided appeal pended was 183.  Forty appeals had not \nbeen decided as of the date of the spreadsheet, and they had pended an average of 57 days.  The \nlongest an open appeal had pended was 314 days. Exhibit 36. Fourth Declaration of Jeanne \nAbadie, ¶4. \n47 The fact that the Office of Aging and Adult Services (“OAAS”) requests additional waiver slots \ndoes not mean that these slots will become available.  As Hugh Eley testified in his deposition, \neach DHH office comes up with a proposed budget.  The Secretary of DHH then submits a \nproposed budget to the Division of Administration, which may or may not fully fund each \n  12 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 12 of 202\n\nemergency waiver services to all class members who are reduced to exactly 32 hours, but \nit is very unlikely that it will be enough to serve all class members who are affected by \nthe cap, if the 2,000 individuals whose services have been reduced to below the cap, as \nwell as the 375 whose services have not yet been reduced, are permitted to apply.   \n3.  Class members must not be required to demonstrate that they will enter nursing \nfacilities “immediately” in order to qualify for additional hours of service \n \n  On the one hand, Defendants appear to deny that only persons for whom a cut in \nservices would necessitate an immediate admission to a nursing facility will be granted \nwaiver slots.  On the other hand, they make it clear that they are not prepared to follow \nthe standard set forth in the United Stated Department of Justice’s technical assistance for \nevaluating risk of institutionalization or segregation.  Defendants claim that it is \nimpossible for them to apply a standard that would award an emergency waiver slot to \nindividuals for whom the cuts in LT-PCS are “likely to cause a decline in health, safety, \nor welfare that would lead to the individual’s eventual placement in an institution,” \nbecause many LT-PCS recipients have degenerative diseases and conditions, and because \nDefendants are not aware of “sound diagnostic tools” that would assess whether a person \nrequires a specified number of hours to avoid such a decline. \n  Class members’ doctors can and have stated that in their medical opinions they \nwill suffer such a decline if their hours of home care are reduced to 32 or fewer.48  To the \n                                                                                                                                                \noffice’s budget proposal.  The Division of Administration then develops the Executive Budget to \nsubmit to the Legislature, which usually includes less that the amounts that agency offices ask \nfor. Exhibit 29, Eley deposition, p. 196, l. 24 – p. 200, l. 7. In SFY 2010,  OAAS requested \nfunding for 1,000 additional waiver slots, but these were not even included in the Secretary’s \nproposed budget to the Division of Administration.

Interim relief must be made available while emergency waiver applications are \nprocessed and services initiated. \n \n  Defendants’ new emergency waiver slot policy makes no provision for continuing \nor restoring necessary LT-PCS hours while requests for emergency slots are pending, \napplications processed, and waiver services planned and initiated. Though Defendants \nclaim that it is takes only two weeks for it to process emergency waiver applications, this \nis not borne out by Defendants’ response to discovery dated November 2, 2011,49 and \nignores that historically it has typically taken 60 to 90 days for waiver services to begin, \nonce an offer has been made. As of October 11, 2011, only three emergency waiver \noffers had been made.  Two were made within two weeks of their request dates, but one \nwas made on September 7, 2011, 43 days after it was requested.  This person’s waiver \nservices were not started until October 18, 2011.50 \n  As of October 11, 2011, six requests for emergency waiver slots were pending for \nclass members who are approved to receive 32 hours a week of LT-PCS. Defendants’ \nspreadsheet shows that four of these had requested emergency waiver slots between July \n26, 2011 and September 15, 2011.  \n                                                                                                                                                \n(Rec.

Hugh Eley testified earlier in \nthis case that it takes an average of 60 to 90 days, and sometimes longer—for services to \nbegin once a waiver offer is made.51  To avoid deterioration and risk of \ninstitutionalization during this period, interim LT-PCS exceeding the 32-hour limit is \nneeded. \nC.  Elimination of the 90-day stay rule for offers to nursing facility residents still requires \nunlawful segregation and institutionalization in order to receive adequate personal care \nservices. \n \n  Prior to June 20, 2011, Defendants not only required people with disabilities to be \nadmitted to a nursing facility in order to get access to immediate home care services in \nexcess of 32 hours a week—they also required them to remain in the nursing home for at \nleast 90 consecutive days before they could receive an EDA waiver offer.52  On June 20, \n2011, the Department revised its rule to delete the requirement that the person remain for \n90 consecutive days in a nursing facility before a waiver offer can be made.  However, it \nhas retained the requirement that a person be actually admitted to a nursing facility in \norder to qualify for a waiver offer.   \n  Though clearly the elimination of the 90-day consecutive stay requirement is an \nimprovement, any requirement that a person actually be admitted to a nursing facility \nbefore he or she receives a waiver offer violates the ADA (especially given the 60- to 90-\nday start-up period for waiver services). See, e.g., Marlo M. v. Cansler53 (granting \npreliminary injunction because plaintiffs would suffer regressive consequences if “even \n                                                 \n51 Defendants’ Statement of Undisputed Facts in Support of the Motion for Summary Judgment \n(Rec.

The only exceptions to this rule were individuals with substantiated cases of \nabuse or neglect referred by Adult Protective Serivces or Elderly Protective Services, and \nindividuals with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease).   \n53 679 F. Supp. 2d 635, 638 (E.D.N.C. 2010) \n  15 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 15 of 202\n\ntemporarily” returning to an institutional setting); Cruz v. Dudek54 (granting preliminary \ninjunction where state proposed entry into nursing home for sixty days prior to providing \ncommunity-based services); Haddad v. Arnold55 (granting preliminary injunction after \nfinding that the plaintiff would suffer irreparable injury if forced to enter a nursing \nhome).  “Temporary” unjustified institutionalization disrupts the individual’s established \nlife in the community and places him or her at risk of psychological, emotional, and \nphysical deterioration.  \n  Defendants must provide meaningful opportunities for class members to obtain \nthe same personal care services that they would obtain in a nursing facility in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate for them—their own homes and communities. It must not \ncondition receipt of those services upon first being admitted to a segregated institutional \nsetting. \n \nD.  Offering EDA waiver slots to LT-PCS recipients who have had to wait for years for \nthose services does not meet immediate needs of class members  \n \n  Defendants tout progress in offering waiver slots to 1,500 recipients of LT-PCS in \nthe last year, including two of the original named plaintiffs—Helen Pitts and Denise \nHodges.  What Defendants neglect to say is that these individuals, like virtually all \nindividuals in the community who need services in excess of 32 hours a week, have had \nto wait for years on a waiting list before being offered these services. No new EDA \nwaiver slots have been added since 2009; as of the first of this year, there were 19,156 \n                                                 \n54 No. 10-23048, 2010 WL 4284955, at *3-7 (S.D. Fla. Oct 12, 2010) (Order adopting \nMagistrate’s Report and Recommendation, Nov. 24, 2010). \n55 784 F.Supp. 2d 1284 (M.D. Fla. 2010). \n  16 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 16 of 202\n\npeople on the waiting list for these services.56 As of March 30, 2011, there was a wait \ntime of 40.5 months for EDA services.57 \n  Plaintiffs Helen Pitts and Denise Hodges, for example, had been on the waiting \nlist since September of 2007 when they were offered slots in 2011. Because their \nsituations were spotlighted in this action, they were spared the reduction in their LT-PCS \nhours that would have placed them at grave danger of physical and mental deterioration.58  \nDefendants voluntarily extended their services at their pre-September 2011 level because \nof their involvement in this case. But many members of the certified class in this action \nhave been, or will be, waiting years for waiver slots, without the protections that Ms. Pitts \nand Ms. Hodges were able to get because they personally came to the attention of class \ncounsel.   They need this Court to protect them against the risk of mental and physical \ndeterioration that may lead to institutionalization. \nE.  Voluntary extensions of LT-PCS services to named Plaintiffs and others identified by \nclass counsel do not meet the needs of unnamed class members. \n \n  Defendants have voluntarily extended LT-PCS services at their pre-September \n2010 level for approximately 20 class members that class counsel has brought to their \nattention.  However, Defendants have made it clear that they have not committed to \nextending these services past February 29, 2011.  Further, this does nothing to meet the \nneeds of class members that class counsel has not encountered.  \n  The Advocacy Center has not succeeded, despite its attempts to reach out to \n                                                 \n56 Exhibit 42, Document 2482, Email from Steven Buco to Rick Henley. \n57 Second Declaration of Hugh Eley (Rec. Doc. 39-2) ¶21. \n58 Ms. Pitts’ physician, Dr. Gregory Ward, a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist \npracticing in Baton Rouge, who has treated her for over ten years, noted that her multiple \ndiagnoses put her “in a precarious situation,” and that that when she lacked adequate in-home \ncare for a period of time in 2008 or 2009, her condition greatly deteriorated. Exhibit 43, \nDeclaration of Gregory Ward, M.D. (Rec. Doc. 36-4, pp. 275-278). \n  17 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 17 of 202\n\nmembers of the class, in identifying more than a small fraction of the persons placed at \nrisk by these cuts. For example, Defendants have provided, in response to discovery in \nthis case, a list of 366 people who have filed administrative appeals of the cuts in their \nLT-PCS hours since September 2010.  Only  26 of them have contacted the Advocacy \nCenter (not necessarily about the appeals).59 \n  The fact that Defendants have extended LT-PCS hours at their previous level for \nnumerous class members shows that to do so is not a “fundamental alteration” of their \nprogram.  All Plaintiffs are seeking to do in this motion is to obtain this same \nconsideration pendente lite on a fair and even-handed basis to all class members who \nneed it. \nARGUMENT \nA.  Plaintiffs have standing to seek preliminary injunctive relief for the class \n  Defendants devote considerable effort to arguing that the named plaintiffs do not \nhave standing to challenge aspects of the emergency waiver process.  Defendants claim \nthat the named plaintiffs are not affected by the alleged deficiencies in the process. \nHowever, of the three named plaintiffs, only Rickii Ainey has been offered an emergency \nwaiver slot60 under the new policy. Kenneth Roman and Elizabeth Foster have been \npermitted to apply for emergency slots, but a decision has not yet been reached on their \napplications.  Defendants have voluntarily extended LT-PCS hours for all the named \nplaintiffs at their pre-September 2010 levels until February 29, 2011.  \n                                                 \n59 Exhibit 36, Fourth Declaration of Jeanne Abadie, ¶3. \n60 This offer was made on or about October 27, 2011.  Id., ¶7. \n  18 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 18 of 202\n\n  Defendants cite Lewis v. Casey61 for the proposition that the named plaintiffs do \nnot have standing to seek additional slots beyond the 100 currently allocated, to seek to \nprovide emergency slots to people approved to receive fewer than 32 hours of LT-PCS, \nto provide interim benefits for persons while they apply for emergency slots, or to \nchallenge the standard for awarding emergency slots. \n  When they brought this action, all of the named plaintiffs were at risk of \ndeterioration and institutionalization because of the September 2010 rule mandating \nreductions in their LT-PCS hours.  This policy had no exceptions process for people who \nneed more than 32 hours of LT-PCS to remain in their homes and communities.  The \nnamed plaintiffs were all personally affected by this lack of an exceptions policy and had \nstanding to challenge it. The fact that Defendants have now voluntarily adopted an \nexceptions policy of sorts does not deprive the named plaintiffs of standing. \n  Voluntary actions taken by a defendant in a class action to alleviate harm to the \nnamed class representative do not affect that representative’s standing. As the Fifth \nCircuit explained in Mississippi Prot. & Advocacy Sys., Inc. v. Cotton,62 named plaintiffs \nwho present a live controversy when filing their complaint and at the time of class \ncertification cannot be “mooted out” by voluntary actions of defendants in such a way as \nto destroy their ability to represent the class.  Their claims are seen as “capable of \nrepetition, yet evading review.” Sosna v. Iowa;63 Zeidman v. J. Ray McDermott.64 \n  Lewis v. Casey is inapposite.  In Lewis, a sweeping injunction minutely regulating \nArizona’s prison law libraries had been obtained even though actual harm had only been \n                                                 \n61 518 U.S. 343 (1996). \n62 929 F.2d 1054, 1057-58 (5th Cir. 1991) \n63 419 U.S. 393, 399-400 (1975), \n64 651 F. 2d 1030 (5th Cir. 1981) \n  19 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 19 of 202\n\nshown by two class members, and the harm they had suffered did not rise to the level of a \nsystematic constitutional violation.  Similarly, Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina,65 differs \nfrom the instant case because there, the named plaintiffs did not have standing to seek \ninjunctive relief when the case was filed, because they were not threatened with future \nharm. These cases do not support the argument that the named plaintiffs in this case, who, \nwhen the case was filed, were threatened with actual harm from a systematic policy \nwhose effects they shared with other class members, lack standing. \n  The applications of plaintiffs Roman and Foster for an emergency waiver slot are \nstill pending.  Thus, they have standing to challenge the standard being used in the \nexceptions process. \n  The one area in which the named plaintiffs may differ from some class members \nis that they have all been approved to receive 32 hours a week of LT-PCS in their most \nrecent assessment.  Thus, they are eligible to apply for emergency waiver slots under the \nJuly 2011 Emergency Rule.  To satisfy any necessity for a class representative that is \napproved to receive less than 32 hours of LT-PCS, class members Eddie Mae Shaw \n(“E.M.S.” in Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction), \nPaula Marshall (“P.M.”), Mary Dunn, Bessie Foreman, and Estelle Curtain will seek \nleave to intervene as additional class representatives.  \nB.  Plaintiffs have satisfied the the preliminary injunction requirements.. \n \n  Though Defendants characterize this motion as seeking a mandatory injunction, \nand cite cases that purport to establish a higher standard for such relief, for most class \nmembers the relief requested here will simply retain the status quo as of the date this \naction was instituted. Where a defendant an injunction proceeding takes the actions \n                                                 \n65 199 F.3d 1037 (1999). \n  20 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 20 of 202\n\nsought to be enjoined, the court may enter a preliminary injunction to restore the status \nquo.”66 In any event, the need for Court intervention to protect the civil rights of class \nmembers outweighs any considerations purporting to disfavor mandatory injunctions.   \n  Defendants’ cite Martinez v. Matthews67 (finding despite a “clearly favoring” \nanalysis, that the Migrant Health Act required immediate appointment of migrant workers \nto a majority of the health provider’s board of directors), for the proposition that \nmandatory injunctions require a much higher standard than those seeking to only \nmaintain the status quo. While Plaintiffs do not concede they are requesting any more \nthan protecting the status quo ante, reading on in Martinez reveals that while that facts \nand law should clearly favor the moving party, the analysis the Court is to apply is \notherwise the same. There must “…be an evaluation of the equitable considerations \ninvolved: the plaintiffs' likelihood of prevailing on the merits, the possibility of \nirreparable harm to the plaintiffs, the counterbalancing risk of harm to the defendants, \nand the public interest.  Id.  The Martinez court then went on to look at congressional \nconcern in the adoption of the Migrant Health Act, which was to assure the recipients of \nmigrant health services had a voice in the provision of their health care, and to prevent \nhealth care for migrants from being lost in the shuffle, and found that Plaintiffs were \nentitled to their preliminary injunction. \n  Plaintiffs have set forth in their Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for a \n                                                 \n66 Porter v. Lee, 328 U.S. 246 (1946) (reversing denial of preliminary injunction restoring tenant \nto property from which evicted); Cohen v. Brown University, 991 F.2d 888 (1st Cir. 1993) \n(affirming grant of preliminary injunction in Title IX case restoring women’s varsity teams);  \nF.T.C. v. Weyerhouser Co., 648 F.2d 739 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (enjoining challenged merger which \nhad already occurred).  In such cases, courts have defined the “status quo” as the “last peaceable \nuncontested status” between the parties, United States v. F.D.I.C., 881 F.2d 207, 210 (5th Cir. \n1989); Alexander v. Sav. Life Ins. Co., CIV.A. 87-1477, 1987 WL 13226 (E.D. La. June 30, \n1987). \n67 544 F.2d 1233, 1243 (5th Cir. 1976). \n  21 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 21 of 202\n\nPreliminary Injunction a detailed argument regarding how they meet the four Winter \nrequirements for issuance of an injunction.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief \nunder the ADA’s and the Rehabilitation Act’s integration mandate. With this Court’s \nearlier ruling that the state’s system violates the ADA by requiring a greater risk of \ninstitutionalization for people who require more than 32 hours per week of assistance, \nand the fact that Defendants still require a person to enter the nursing home before getting \nan immediate waiver slot, prevailing on the merits of the ADA claim is utterly clear. \nIrreparable injury and the balance of the equities are clear from the loss of services \nPlaintiffs will suffer because of the Defendants’ policies. Likewise, an injunction is \nclearly in the public interest.   \nC.  The relief Plaintiffs are requesting would not fundamentally alter Defendants’ \nprograms. \n \n  Plaintiffs suggest two alternative means of preventing irreparable harm to the \nclass pending trial on the merits:  (1) an expansion of the steps Defendants have already \ntaken to provide access to immediate waiver services for class members; and (2) the \ninstitution of an exceptions process that would allow class members to receive LT-PCS in \nexcess of the 32-hour limit if they can show that they need more than 32 hours to avoid \ndeterioration and eventual placement in a nursing facility.  These types of relief will not \nfundamentally alter Defendants’ programs. \n1.  It is workable for Defendants to provide emergency Community Choice waiver slot \noffers to persons who can demonstrate that they need more than 32 hours of LT-PCS to \navoid “a decline in health, safety, or welfare that would lead to the individual’s eventual \nplacement in an institution.” \n \n  Defendants assert that it would be impossible for it to administer the standard \narticulated by the Justice Department in its June 2011 technical assistance guide to state \n  22 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 22 of 202\n\nand local governments on Olmstead compliance: \nA plaintiff could show sufficient risk of institutionalization to make out an \nOlmstead violation if a public entity’s failure to provide community services or its \ncut to such services will likely cause a decline in health, safety, or welfare that \nwould lead to the individual’s eventual placement in an institution. (emphasis \nsupplied). \n \n  Defendants contend this standard is impossible to apply because (1) the program \nprimarily serves the elderly and persons with degenerative conditions; and (2) they are \nnot aware of any “sound diagnostic tool” that can be used to assess whether someone \nneeds a particular level of assistance to avoid institutionalization.  They claim that \n“nursing home admission is often the result of unpredictable (e.g., a slip-and-fall, the loss \nof a caregiver, or a family’s decision that a nursing home is most appropriate) rather than \nsomeone receiving 32 hours of personal care assistance every week”68 and therefore \nassert that they cannot apply the Justice Department’s standard to determine whether or \nnot class members are placed at risk. \n  Though Mr. Eley may be unaware of any “sound diagnostic tool”  to determine \nthe number of hours of services that are necessary to prevent deterioration in health, \nsafety, and welfare that will lead to eventual nursing home placement, medical \nprofessionals routinely make these judgments.  The medical professionals who have \ntreated the named plaintiffs and other class members in this case, have in fact testified \nprecisely to the fact that a reduction in service hours to these individuals will indeed \nplace them at risk of physical and mental deterioration and eventual institutionalization.69   \n  Further, Defendants’ rules currently permit a class member to appeal to obtain \n                                                 \n68 Third Eley Decl. at ¶47; Attachment E to Third Eley Declaration, pp. 2, 3 (Rec. Doc. 81-2, pp. \n23 and 24) (showing plan amendment not submitted until September 30, 2010, and not approved \nuntil December 14.)  \n69 See n. 48 supra. \n  23 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 23 of 202\n\nmore hours than number dictated by their ADL index (up to a maximum of 32 hours), by \nshowing “that he or she needs additional hours to avoid entering a nursing facility.”70  \nDefendants do not explain why it is workable for a recipient to show that he needs more \nhours, up to a maximum of 32, to avoid institutionalization, but not workable for a \nrecipient to show they need more than 32 hours to avoid deterioration and eventual \ninstitutionalization. \n  Similarly, Defendants’ policies already require a finding that a person is at \n“imminent risk” of nursing facility placement if home and community-based services are \nnot provided within 120 days.71 This requires just the type of medical judgment that \nDefendants contend in their response is impossible to make. \n2.  The changes Plaintiffs seek in the emergency waiver slot program would not \noverwhelm the system. \n \n  If current experience is any indication, the number of people who will apply for \nan emergency waiver slot if the eligibility for the slot is expanded is not huge.  \nDefendants state that of the 2,900 people whose services have been reduced to a \nmaximum of 32 hours a week, and who still receive LT-PCS, 500 individuals had their \nservices reduced to exactly 32 hours a week, and were thus eligible to apply for \nemergency waiver slots. Yet even though this change was implemented last July, as of \nthe middle of October, only about 30 applications had been received.  At this response \nrate, the number of applications for emergency slots is extremely unlikely to overwhelm \nthe system, even if (as Defendants suggest at p. 18 of their Response) “the percentage of \nrequests that are actually granted would likely be relatively small.”   \n                                                 \n70 Exhibit 44, 37 La. Register 1113 (April 20, 2011), amending La. Admin. Code Tit. 50, part \nXV, §12901(D)(2)(b). \n71 See nn. 21 and 22, supra. \n  24 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 24 of 202\n\n  Similarly, extending LT-PCS benefits temporarily, for those who apply for \nemergency waiver slots, is not likely to overwhelm the system.  Defendants suggest that \nit is able to start waiver services within six weeks of a request, for those whose \nemergency waiver requests are granted.  If this is true,72 the extension of LT-PCS for this \nshort period will not cost very much, and will alleviate much unnecessary and unjustified \nsuffering on the part of class members. \n3.  It would not fundamentally alter Defendants’ LT-PCS program to provide a \nmechanism for class members to seek an exception to the 32-hour maximum.    \n   \na.  The State Medicaid plan is not a barrier to services in excess of the 32-hour cap.  \n  Louisiana has had several different rules placing maximum hours on its State \nMedicaid plan LT-PCS.  Until 2009, the maximum was 56 hours a week.  In 2009, the \nState reduced the maximum to 42 hours a week.  In September of 2010, Defendants \nimplemented the 32-hour cap on LT-PCS. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nservices (“CMS”) approved all of these arrangements.  Louisiana did not seek to amend \nits State Medicaid plan prior to implementing the rule challenged in this case, and in fact \nMr. Eley states that approval was not received until December of 2010.73  If this Court \nrequires the State to provide a mechanism for class members to seek an exception to the \n32-hour cap, there is absolutely no reason to believe that CMS will not readily approve \nsuch an amendment retroactively to the date of its implementation, as it has routinely \ndone in the past.  \n                                                 \n72 Only four waiver slot offers have been extended to date.  Three of these were to class members \nbrought to the attention of Defendants by class counsel.  None of these persons services were \nstarted within six weeks of their request. Exhibit 36, Fourth Declaration of Jeanne Abadie, ¶¶6,7. \n73 Third Eley Decl. ¶67; Attachment E to Third Eley Declaration, pp. 2, 3 (Rec. Doc. 81-2, pp. 23 \nand 24) (showing plan amendment not submitted until September 30, 2010, and not approved \nuntil December 14). \n \n  25 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 25 of 202\n\nb.  Allowing class members who need more than 32 hours to alleviate the risk of \ninstitutionalization by obtaining an exception to the cap does not “redefine” the LT-PCS \nbenefit. \n \n  Defendants’ argues that the LT-PCS benefit is by its nature limited to 32 hours, \nand that the program is not intended to satisfy class members’ need for services to \nprevent them from having to be institutionalized.  They cite Alexander v. Choate74 for the \nproposition that the ADA does not require it to “redefine” the “particular package of \nhealth care services” available through the LT-PCS program. \n  Alexander v. Choate is distinguishable from this case because it did not involve \nclaims of unnecessary institutionalization and segregation.  While Alexander stands for \nthe proposition that not every distinction in Medicaid benefits that disproportionately \ndisfavors individuals with disabilities violates the ADA, Olmstead v. L.C. stands for the \nproposition that states may not condition the receipt of Medicaid services upon the \nacceptance of unnecessary segregation and institutionalization.  For Louisiana to define \nits benefit so that people who need more than 32 hours of personal care must enter a \nnursing facilty to obtain it does violate the ADA. \n  Defendants’ characterization of the LT-PCS program is disingenuous.  The \nprogram has always been aimed at providing home- and community-based services as an \nalternative to nursing facility services.  It was instituted in 2003 as a result of the \nBarthelemy litigation, which was a case under the ADA to require the Defendants to \nprovide home- and community-based services as an alternative to nursing facility \nservices.  The rule establishing LT-PCS provided that “The purpose of personal care \nservices is to enable an individual whose needs would otherwise require placement in an \n                                                 \n74 369 U.S. 287 (1985). \n  26 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 26 of 202\n\nacute or long-term care facility to remain safely in that individual’s own home.”75  This \nrule was repromulgated many times with similar language.76 Though the rule Plaintiffs \nchallenge here omits (for the first time) any reference to allowing individuals with \ndisabilities to remain safely in their own homes, neither it, nor any subsequent \nrepromulgations, have announced any fundamental change in the program, other than to \ncut the maximum hours.  Defendants did not offer any additional services, when the \nSeptember 2010 rule was promulgated, to take the place of the LT-PCS program.  And as \nin previous rules, the September 2010 rule allows class members to obtain the maximum \nnumber of hours on appeal, despite their ADL index, if they show that they need that \nnumber of hours to avoid having to enter a nursing facility.  To credit Defendants’ \nargument that the purpose of the LT-PCS program is simply to offer a limited benefit, \nand that to require changes in that benefit to accommodate people who require more \nservices to avoid deterioration and eventual nursing facility placement will ipso facto \nfundamentally alter the program, would be to allow Defendants to circumvent the ADA \nby simply “wordsmithing” their rule. \n  Defendants’ argument that creating a means for class members to obtain services \nin excess of the 32-hour cap would fundamentally alter its program because DHH “does \nnot allocate services in the LT-PCS program based on how many hours of assistance an \nindividual requires to avoid entering a nursing home”77 is difficult to understand.  \nDefendants claim that their allocation of hours is based on “an evidence-based uniform \nassessment tool not to determine how many hours of assistance each recipient “needs” \nbut the recipient’s demonstrated independence in performing ADL’s as compared with \n                                                 \n75 La. Register 29:911 (June 20, 2003). \n76 See La Reg 38: (December 20, 2008); La Reg 39:11 (November 20, 2010). \n77 Defendants’ Memorandum at 21; Third Eley Decl. at ¶66), \n  27 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 27 of 202\n\nothers in the LT-PCS program.”78 They claim that this method produces an allocation of \nLT-PCS hours that is “more fair and efficient” than an unspecified “previous \napproach,”79 and that to permit approval of more hours based on a showing of a need for \nmore hours to avoid institutionalization would somehow disrupt the program. \n  Defendants do not explain how an allocation of hours of service that does not \nconsider the individual’s need for services can be considered “fair.” Though they assert \nthat there is some “evidence” that supports an allocation mechanism that does not \nconsider need, it is hard to imagine what question this evidence might address. Indeed, \nusing an allocation method that provides different levels of services to Medicaid \nrecipients based on distinctions unrelated to medical need would violate the Medicaid \nstatute’s “comparability” requirement, 42 U.S.C. ß 1396a(a)(10)(B).80  \n  As noted above, DHH already permits class members to receive services in excess \nof the amount dictated by the allocation mechanism if they can show that they need more \nhours up to a maximum of 32, to avoid entering a nursing facility.81 The class members \ndiscussed in Plaintiff’s motion have demonstrated, through their own testimony and the \ntestimony of their treating physicians, that they need hours in excess of 32 to remain \n                                                 \n78 Defendants’ Memorandum at 21. \n79 Defendants assert that their current methodology was adopted in 2009.  In fact, a completely \ndifferent methodology—one which took into account significantly more information from the \nMDS—was adopted in 2009, and the current methodology was only adopted in August, 2010. \n80 V.L. v.

Calif. 2010). \n81 Defendants’ previous rules, using a different allocation methodology and applying a 42-hour \ncap, permitted recipients to obtain services up to the maximum cap of 42 hours, on a showing that \nthey needed more hours than the allocation method assigned to avoid entering a nursing facility. \n  28 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 28 of 202\n\nsafely in their homes.  To allow them and others to obtain additional services on such a \nshowing will not fundamentally alter the LT-PCS program.  \nb.  There is no reason to believe that requiring an exceptions mechanism while this action \nis pending will jeopardize the financial stability of the LT-PCS program.   \n \n  Defendants have already allowed exceptions to the ceiling on LT-PCS hours for \nthe named Plaintiffs and other class members brought to their attention by class counsel.  \nDefendants have pointed to no harm to the LT-PCS program as a result of these \nexceptions, and they have not offered any estimate of the cost of providing such \nexceptions to other class members, as Plaintiffs are requesting here.  They acknowledge \nthat only 30, of a potential 500, class members have come forward to request emergency \nwaiver slots under the rule implemented last July, that permits them to seek an \nemergency slot if 32 hours of LT-PCS are insufficient to prevent them from having to \nenter a nursing facility.  There is no reason to believe that extending or restoring the LT-\nPCS services to class members who are able to come forward and demonstrate that they \nneed more hours to avoid deterioration and nursing facility placement while this case is \npending will jeopardize the financial stability of the program. \nConclusion \n  For the reasons and on the authority cited above, Plaintiffs respectfully requests \nthat this Honorable Court grant preliminary injunctive relief to the class. \nDate:  November 14, 2011. \n            Respectfully submitted: \n \n/s/ Nell Hahn           \nNell Hahn, T.A., Louisiana Bar No. 22406 \nADVOCACY  CENTER  \n600 Jefferson St., Suite 812 \nLafayette, LA 70501 \n  29 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 29 of 202\n\n(337) 237-7380, ext. 311 \n(337) 237-0486 FAX \nEmail: nhahn@advocacyla.org  \n \n            Stephen F.

L.C.\nIn the years since the Supreme Court’s decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the goal of the integration mandate in title II of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act – to provide individuals with disabilities opportunities to live their lives like individuals without disabilities – has yet\nto be fully realized.  Some state and local governments have begun providing more integrated community alternatives to individuals in or at risk of\nsegregation in institutions or other segregated settings.  Yet many people who could and want to live, work, and receive services in integrated settings\nare still waiting for the promise of Olmstead to be fulfilled.  \nIn 2009, on the tenth anniversary of the Supreme Court’s decision in Olmstead, President Obama launched “The Year of Community Living” and\ndirected federal agencies to vigorously enforce the civil rights of Americans with disabilities.  Since then, the Department of Justice has made\nenforcement of Olmstead a top priority.  As we commemorate the 12th anniversary of the Olmstead decision, the Department of Justice reaffirms its\ncommitment to vindicate the right of individuals with disabilities to live integrated lives under the ADA and Olmstead.  To assist individuals in\nunderstanding their rights under title II of the ADA and its integration mandate, and to assist state and local governments in complying with the\nADA, the Department of Justice has created this technical assistance guide.\nThe ADA and Its Integration Mandate\nIn 1990, Congress enacted the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act “to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination\nof discrimination against individuals with disabilities.”1  In passing this groundbreaking law, Congress recognized that “historically, society has\ntended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with\ndisabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.”2  For those reasons, Congress prohibited discrimination against individuals with\ndisabilities by public entities:\n[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the\nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.3\nAs directed by Congress, the Attorney General issued regulations implementing title II, which are based on regulations issued under section 504 of\nthe Rehabilitation Act.4  The title II regulations require public entities to “administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”5  The preamble discussion of the “integration regulation” explains that “the most\nintegrated setting” is one that “enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible . . . .”6 \nIn Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999),the Supreme Court held that title II prohibits the unjustified segregation of individuals with disabilities. \nThe Supreme Court held that public entities are required to provide community-based services to persons with disabilities when (a) such services are\nappropriate; (b) the affected persons do not oppose community-based treatment; and (c) community-based services can be reasonably accommodated,\ntaking into account the resources available to the entity and the needs of others who are receiving disability services from the entity.7  The Supreme\nCourt explained that this holding “reflects two evident judgments.”  First, “institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit from\ncommunity settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.” \nSecond, “confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work\noptions, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.”8 \nTo comply with the ADA’s integration mandate, public entities must reasonably modify their policies, procedures or practices when necessary to\navoid discrimination.9  The obligation to make reasonable modifications may be excused only where the public entity demonstrates that the\nrequested modifications would “fundamentally alter” its service system.10 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 35 of 202\n1 of 6 11/14/11 6:22 PM\n\nStatement of the Department of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of Title II... http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm\nIn the years since the passage of the ADA and the Supreme Court’s decision in Olmstead, the ADA’s integration mandate has been applied in a wide\nvariety of contexts and has been the subject of substantial litigation.  The Department of Justice has created this technical assistance guide to assist\nindividuals in understanding their rights and public entities in understanding their obligations under the ADA and Olmstead. This guide catalogs and\nexplains the positions the Department of Justice has taken in its Olmstead enforcement. It reflects the views of the Department of Justice only.

What is the most integrated setting under the ADA and Olmstead?\nA: The “most integrated setting” is defined as “a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with non-disabled persons to the fullest\nextent possible.” 11  Integrated settings are those that provide individuals with disabilities opportunities to live, work, and receive services in the\ngreater community, like individuals without disabilities.  Integrated settings are located in mainstream society; offer access to community activities\nand opportunities at times, frequencies and with persons of an individual’s choosing; afford individuals choice in their daily life activities; and,\nprovide individuals with disabilities the opportunity to interact with non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible.  Evidence-based practices that\nprovide scattered-site housing with supportive services are examples of integrated settings.  By contrast, segregated settings often have qualities of an\ninstitutional nature.  Segregated settings include, but are not limited to: (1) congregate settings populated exclusively or primarily with individuals\nwith disabilities; (2) congregate settings characterized by regimentation in daily activities, lack of privacy or autonomy, policies limiting visitors, or\nlimits on individuals’ ability to engage freely in community activities and to manage their own activities of daily living; or (3) settings that provide\nfor daytime activities primarily with other individuals with disabilities.\n2. When is the ADA’s integration mandate implicated?\nA: The ADA’s integration mandate is implicated where a public entity administers its programs in a manner that results in unjustified segregation of\npersons with disabilities.  More specifically, a public entity may violate the ADA’s integration mandate when it: (1) directly or indirectly operates\nfacilities and or/programs that segregate individuals with disabilities; (2) finances the segregation of individuals with disabilities in private facilities;\nand/or (3) through its planning, service system design, funding choices, or service implementation practices, promotes or relies upon the segregation\nof individuals with disabilities in private facilities or programs.12\n3. Does a violation of the ADA’s integration mandate require a showing of facial discrimination?\nA: No, in the Olmstead context, an individual is not required to prove facial discrimination.  In Olmstead, the court held that the plaintiffs could make\nout a case under the integration mandate even if they could not prove “but for” their disability, they would have received the community-based\nservices they sought.  It was enough that the state currently provided them services in an institutional setting that was not the most integrated setting\nappropriate.13  Additionally, an Olmstead claim is distinct from a claim of disparate treatment or disparate impact and accordingly does not require\nproof of those forms of discrimination.\n4. What evidence may an individual rely on to establish that an integrated setting is appropriate?\nA: An individual may rely on a variety of forms of evidence to establish that an integrated setting is appropriate. A reasonable, objective assessment\nby a public entity’s treating professional is one, but only one, such avenue.  Such assessments must identify individuals’ needs and the services and\nsupports necessary for them to succeed in an integrated setting.  Professionals involved in the assessments must be knowledgeable about the range of\nsupports and services available in the community.  However, the ADA and its regulations do not require an individual to have had a state treating\nprofessional make such a determination.  People with disabilities can also present their own independent evidence of the appropriateness of an\nintegrated setting, including, for example, that individuals with similar needs are living, working and receiving services in integrated settings with\nappropriate supports.  This evidence may come from their own treatment providers, from community-based organizations that provide services to\npeople with disabilities outside of institutional settings, or from any other relevant source. Limiting the evidence on which Olmstead plaintiffs may\nrely would enable public entities to circumvent their Olmstead requirements by failing to require professionals to make recommendations regarding\nthe ability of individuals to be served in more integrated settings.  \n5.  What factors are relevant in determining whether an individual does not oppose an integrated setting? \nA:  Individuals must be provided the opportunity to make an informed decision.  Individuals who have been institutionalized and segregated have\noften been repeatedly told that they are not capable of successful community living and have been given very little information, if any, about how\nthey could successfully live in integrated settings.  As a result, individuals’ and their families’ initial response when offered integrated options may be\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 36 of 202\n2 of 6 11/14/11 6:22 PM\n\nStatement of the Department of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of Title II... http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm\nreluctance or hesitancy.  Public entities must take affirmative steps to remedy this history of segregation and prejudice in order to ensure that\nindividuals have an opportunity to make an informed choice. Such steps include providing information about the benefits of integrated settings;\nfacilitating visits or other experiences in such settings; and offering opportunities to meet with other individuals with disabilities who are living,\nworking and receiving services in integrated settings, with their families, and with community providers.  Public entities also must make reasonable\nefforts to identify and addresses any concerns or objections raised by the individual or another relevant decision-maker.    \n6. Do the ADA and Olmstead apply to persons at serious risk of institutionalization or segregation?\nA:  Yes, the ADA and the Olmstead decision extend to persons at serious risk of institutionalization or segregation and are not limited to individuals\ncurrently in institutional or other segregated settings.  Individuals need not wait until the harm of institutionalization or segregation occurs or is\nimminent.  For example, a plaintiff could show sufficient risk of institutionalization to make out an Olmstead violation if a public entity’s failure to\nprovide community services or its cut to such services will likely cause a decline in health, safety, or welfare that would lead to the individual’s\neventual placement in an institution.       \n7. May the ADA and Olmstead require states to provide additional services, or services to additional individuals, than are\nprovided for in their Medicaid programs?\nA:  A state’s obligations under the ADA are independent from the requirements of the Medicaid program.14  Providing services beyond what a state\ncurrently provides under Medicaid may not cause a fundamental alteration, and the ADA may require states to provide those services, under certain\ncircumstances.  For example, the fact that a state is permitted to “cap” the number of individuals it serves in a particular waiver program under the\nMedicaid Act does not exempt the state from serving additional people in the community to comply with the ADA or other laws.15 \n8. Do the ADA and Olmstead require a public entity to provide services in the community to persons with disabilities when it\nwould otherwise provide such services in institutions?\nA: Yes.  Public entities cannot avoid their obligations under the ADA and Olmstead by characterizing as a “new service” services that they currently\noffer only in institutional settings.  The ADA regulations make clear that where a public entity operates a program or provides a service, it cannot\ndiscriminate against individuals with disabilities in the provision of those services.16  Once public entities choose to provide certain services, they\nmust do so in a nondiscriminatory fashion.17   \n9. Can budget cuts violate the ADA and Olmstead?\nA: Yes, budget cuts can violate the ADA and Olmstead when significant funding cuts to community services create a risk of institutionalization or\nsegregation.  The most obvious example of such a risk is where budget cuts require the elimination or  reduction of community services specifically\ndesigned for individuals who would be institutionalized without such services.  In making such budget cuts, public entities have a duty to take all\nreasonable steps to avoid placing individuals at risk of institutionalization.  For example, public entities may be required to make exceptions to the\nservice reductions or to provide alternative services to individuals who would be forced into institutions as a result of the cuts.  If providing\nalternative services, public entities must ensure that those services are actually available and that individuals can actually secure them to avoid\ninstitutionalization. \n10. What is the fundamental alteration defense?\nA: A public entity’s obligation under Olmstead to provide services in the most integrated setting is not unlimited.  A public entity may be excused in\ninstances where it can prove that the requested modification  would result in a “fundamental alteration” of the public entity’s service system.  A\nfundamental alteration requires the public entity to prove “that, in the allocation of available resources, immediate relief for plaintiffs would be\ninequitable, given the responsibility the State [or local government] has taken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse population of persons\nwith [ ]  disabilities.”18  It is the public entity’s burden to establish that the requested modification would fundamentally alter its service system.      \n11. What budgetary resources and costs are relevant to determine if the relief sought would constitute a fundamental\nalteration? \nA:  The relevant resources for purposes of evaluating a fundamental alteration defense consist of all money the public entity allots, spends, receives,\nor could receive if it applied for available federal funding to provide services to persons with disabilities.  Similarly, all relevant costs, not simply\nthose funded by the single agency that operates or funds the segregated or integrated setting, must be considered in a fundamental alteration analysis. \nMoreover, cost comparisons need not be static or fixed.  If the cost of the segregated setting will likely increase, for instance due to maintenance,\ncapital expenses, environmental modifications, addressing substandard care, or providing required services that have been denied, these incremental\ncosts should be incorporated into the calculation.  Similarly, if the cost of providing integrated services is likely to decrease over time, for instance\ndue to enhanced independence or decreased support needs, this reduction should be incorporated as well.  In determining whether a service would be\nso expensive as to constitute a fundamental alteration, the fact that there may be transitional costs of converting from segregated to integrated settings\ncan be considered, but it is not determinative.  However, if a public entity decides to serve new individuals in segregated settings (“backfilling”),\nrather than to close or downsize the segregated settings as individuals in the plaintiff class move to integrated settings, the costs associated with that\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 37 of 202\n3 of 6 11/14/11 6:22 PM\n\nStatement of the Department of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of Title II... http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm\ndecision should not be included in the fundamental alteration analysis.    \n12. What is an Olmstead Plan?\nA: An Olmstead plan is a public entity’s plan for implementing its obligation to provide individuals with disabilities opportunities to live, work, and\nbe served in integrated settings.  A comprehensive, effectively working plan must do more than provide vague assurances of future integrated options\nor describe the entity’s general history of increased funding for community services and decreased institutional populations.  Instead, it must reflect\nan analysis of the extent to which the public entity is providing services in the most integrated setting and must contain concrete and reliable\ncommitments to expand integrated opportunities.  The plan must have specific and reasonable timeframes and measurable goals for which the public\nentity may be held accountable, and there must be funding to support the plan, which may come from reallocating existing service dollars.  The plan\nshould include commitments for each group of persons who are unnecessarily segregated, such as individuals residing in facilities for individuals\nwith developmental disabilities, psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes and board and care homes, or individuals spending their days in sheltered\nworkshops or segregated day programs.  To be effective, the plan must have demonstrated success in actually moving individuals to integrated\nsettings in accordance with the plan. A public entity cannot rely on its Olmstead plan as part of its defense unless it can prove that its plan\ncomprehensively and effectively addresses the needless segregation of the group at issue in the case.  Any plan should be evaluated in light of the\nlength of time that has passed since the Supreme Court’s decision in Olmstead, including a fact-specific inquiry into what the public entity could have\naccomplished in the past and what it could accomplish in the future. \n13. Can a public entity raise a viable fundamental alteration defense without having implemented an Olmstead plan?\nA: The Department of Justice has interpreted the ADA and its implementing regulations to generally require an Olmstead plan as a prerequisite to\nraising a fundamental alteration defense, particularly in cases involving individuals currently in institutions or on waitlists for services in the\ncommunity .  In order to raise a fundamental alteration defense, a public entity must first show that it has developed a comprehensive, effectively\nworking Olmstead plan that meets the standards described above.  The public entity must also prove that it is implementing the plan in order to avail\nitself of the fundamental alteration defense.  A public entity that cannot show it has and is implementing a working plan will not be able to prove that\nit is already making sufficient progress in complying with the integration mandate and that the requested relief would so disrupt the implementation\nof the plan as to cause a fundamental alteration.   \n14. What is the relevance of budgetary shortages to a fundamental alteration defense? \nA:  Public entities have the burden to show that immediate relief to the plaintiffs would effect a fundamental alteration of their program.  Budgetary\nshortages are not, in and of themselves, evidence that such relief would constitute a fundamental alteration.  Even in times of budgetary constraints,\npublic entities can often reasonably modify their programs by re-allocating funding from expensive segregated settings to cost-effective integrated\nsettings.  Whether the public entity has sought additional federal resources available to support the provision of services in integrated settings for the\nparticular group or individual requesting the modification – such as Medicaid, Money Follows the Person grants, and federal housing vouchers – is\nalso relevant to a budgetary defense.  \n15.  What types of remedies address violations of the ADA’s integration mandate? \nA:  A wide range of remedies may be appropriate to address violations of the ADA and Olmstead, depending on the nature of the violations. \nRemedies typically require the public entity to expand the capacity of community-based alternatives by a specific amount, over a set period of time. \nRemedies should focus on expanding the most integrated alternatives.  For example, in cases involving residential segregation in institutions or large\ncongregate facilities, remedies should provide individuals opportunities to live in their own apartments or family homes, with necessary supports. \nRemedies should also focus on expanding the services and supports necessary for individuals’ successful community tenure.  Olmstead remedies\nshould include, depending on the population at issue: supported housing, Home and Community Based Services (“HCBS”) waivers,19 crisis\nservices, Assertive Community Treatment (“ACT”) teams, case management, respite, personal care services, peer support services, and supported\nemployment.  In addition, court orders and settlement agreements have typically required public entities to implement a process to ensure that\ncurrently segregated individuals are provided information about the alternatives to which they are entitled under the agreement, given opportunities\nthat will allow them to make informed decisions about their options (such as visiting community placements or programs, speaking with community\nproviders, and meeting with peers and other families), and that transition plans are developed and implemented when individuals choose more\nintegrated settings.    \n16. Can the ADA’s integration mandate be enforced through a private right of action?\nA: Yes, private individuals may file a lawsuit for violation of the ADA’s integration mandate.   A private right of action lies to enforce a regulation\nthat authoritatively construes a statute.  The Supreme Court in Olmstead clarified that unnecessary institutionalization constitutes “discrimination”\nunder the ADA, consistent with the Department of Justice integration regulation.  \n17. What is the role of protection and advocacy organizations in enforcing Olmstead? \nA:  By statute, Congress has created an independent protection and advocacy system (P&As) to protect the rights of and advocate for individuals\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 38 of 202\n4 of 6 11/14/11 6:22 PM\n\nStatement of the Department of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of Title II... http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm\nwith disabilities.20  Congress gave P&As certain powers, including the authority to investigate incidents of abuse, neglect and other rights\nviolations; access to individuals, records, and facilities; and the authority to pursue legal, administrative or other remedies on behalf of individuals\nwith disabilities.21  P&As have played a central role in ensuring that the rights of individuals with disabilities are protected, including individuals’\nrights under title II’s integration mandate.  The Department of Justice has supported the standing of P&As to litigate Olmstead cases.\n18.  Can someone file a complaint with the Department of Justice regarding a violation of the ADA and Olmstead?\nA:  Yes, individuals can file complaints about violations of title II and Olmstead with the Department of Justice.  A title II complaint form is available\non-line at www.ADA.gov and can be sent to: \nU.S. Department of Justice\nCivil Rights Division\n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW\nDisability Rights Section - NYAV\nWashington, DC 20530\nIndividuals may also call the Department’s toll-free ADA Information Line for information about filing a complaint and to order forms and other\nmaterials that can assist you in providing information about the violation.  The number for the ADA Information Line is (800) 514-0301 (voice) or\n(800) 514-0383(TTY).\nIn addition, individuals may file a complaint about violations of Olmstead with the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services.

My name is Mary Dunn.  I am 81 years old, and I live alone in my home in \nMonroe, Louisiana. \n2.  I have osteoporosis, arthritis, heart problems and have had back surgery. I had \nback surgery, when I was about thirty years old, to correct a spinal problem that I \nhad at birth.  It does not seem that my back ever healed properly. Due to the \ncombination of the osteoporosis, the arthritis and the back surgery, I am often in \nexcruciating pain.  I take medication to help with the pain.  The effects of the \nmedication, and the fact that I am getting older, makes it hard for me to remember \nthings. The facts in this declaration are true to the best of my knowledge and \nrecollection. \n3.  I am eligible for and receive Medicaid.  I have also been found eligible for and \nreceive Long-term Personal Care Services. \n4.  In September of 2010, I was receiving thirty-eight hours per week of Long-term \nPersonal Care Services.  I received notification sometime in May of 2011 that as \nof June 1, 2011, my hours would be reduced to twenty-nine hours per week. \n5.  At my request, the personal care worker I had at that time appealed for me.  I do \nnot know to whom she sent the appeal, and I do not know when she sent the \nappeal.  I do not remember attending an appeal hearing.ecause of the medication I \ntake and my problems remembering things, I was not able to deal with the appeal \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 45 of 202\n\npersonally.  I do not remember being notified that if I appealed and received 32 \nhours of LT-PCS, I would be able to apply for an emergency waiver slot. \n6.  On October 7, 2011, I met with someone, who I assumed worked for the state of \nLouisiana, about my need for more hours through Long-term Personal Care \nServices.  After our discussion, I was awarded one more hour per week, and I am \nnow approved for thirty hours per week. \n7.  I need thirty-eight to forty hours to continue to live in my home and remain \nindependent. \n8.  I need assistance with transferring from and to my bed and my wheelchair.  I need \nhelp transferring to and from the toilet and need help cleaning myself after \ntoileting. My worker also helps me bathe, dress and perform all grooming tasks.  I \nalso need assistance with meal preparation, laundry, household chores and \nshopping. \n9.  In the morning my personal care worker comes to my home to help me. She \nbegins her work by helping me to bathe, tend to personal hygiene tasks and get \ndressed.  This takes an hour and thirty minutes to one hour and forty-five minutes.  \nShe then helps me get into my wheelchair and that takes about fifteen minutes. \n10. As I said above, due to the combination of the osteoporosis, the arthritis and the \nback surgery, I am often in excruciating pain.  During those times I return to bed \nto lie down in the late morning.  Lying down is sometimes the only position that \ngives me some relief from the pain.   This means that it takes another twenty to \nthirty minutes to help me transfer in and out of bed. \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 46 of 202\n\n11. I use a motorized wheelchair when I am not in bed.  I can maneuver the chair \nmyself once I am in it, but I cannot get in and out of the chair on my own.  I do \nnot remember when I started using the wheelchair.  It seems that it was three to \nfive years ago. \n12. My personal care worker prepares my breakfast after helping me get into my \nwheelchair.  Preparing my meal and cleaning the kitchen after I eat takes about \nthirty minutes.  \n13. I need help eating when I am too weak to hold the utensils. When this happens, \nmy worker must spend an extra fifteen minutes or so feeding me. \n14. She fixes my lunch before she leaves and also gets something for dinner prepared \nin a crock-pot or makes sure that a frozen meal bought from the grocery is readily \navailable.  Preparing the meals and cleaning the kitchen after preparation takes \nabout forty-five minutes. \n15. During the day, I will go to the toilet once or twice.  My personal care worker \nhelps me to get on and off the toilet, as well as helps me to clean myself.  Each of \nthese tasks takes approximately fifteen minutes. \n16.  I am incontinent, and my worker assists me with pads and to clean myself after \naccidents.  If the worker is not around when I have an accident, I have to wait \nuntil she arrives the next day to be cleaned.  I try to control my incontinence with \nmedication and fluid intake, but the accidents still occur. \n17. When I do have a bowel accident and my personal care worker is with me, she \nhelps clean me and change my pad.  This activity can take approximately thirty \nminutes. \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 47 of 202\n\n18. If you add the time that I need from my worker on a daily basis, you will see that I \nneed approximately four hours and fifteen minutes each day.  This means that if I \nam not feeling well and move slower, something doesn’t get done.  What doesn’t \nget done can be a hygiene task, preparation of a meal, or assisting me back into \nand out of bed in the late morning. \n19. It also means that when I have shopping, laundry or household chores that must \nbe done, something else doesn’t get done during that day.  If I have to go to a \ndoctor, which seems to be about once each month, my personal care worker \naccompanies me.  On those days, she has no time to prepare my meals and may \nnot have time to do all of my personal care. \n20. I live approximately 15 minutes from the closest grocery store, so grocery \nshopping takes approximately one and a half hours.  It takes longer if I go with \nmy worker because I must use my manual wheelchair since my worker cannot \ntransport my motorized chair. \n21. My personal care worker must do all of my household chores, including cleaning \nmy home and doing my laundry.  She also assists me with my mail and paying my \nbills.  I seem to be forgetting things lately, so she helps to make sure I don’t forget \nanything important. \n22. Assisting me with household chores, bill paying and laundry can take another two \nhours per week.  \n23. I have a bedside commode, which I attempt transfer to and from at night or \nwhenever I am in bed, but I have fallen several times.  Some of the falls have \ntaken place during times of the day when if my hours had not been reduced, my \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 48 of 202\n\npersonal are worker would have been with me.  After my most recent fall, which \nwas only about three weeks ago, I fractured my hip; however, the doctor does not \nrecommend surgery because of the affects the anesthesia may have on my heart. \n24. Since that fall, I find I have had great difficulty to transferring to the commode \nand have had accidents when my worker wasn’t with me, which means I wasn’t \ncleaned and changed for many hours.  \n25. With the reduction in hours, my worker does not have time to prepare proper \nmeals for me.  I often have to buy food that is already prepared, which, often \ntimes, does not follow the diet that has been suggested by my doctor as a result of \nmy heart problems. \n26. Presently, I only receive sponge baths because I have a wound on my foot that \nwill not heal and the doctor things might be cancerous. My doctor has said that I \ncannot submerge my foot into water.   Once I am able to have full baths again, I \nam not sure my worker will have time to fully bathe me on a daily basis because \nin the past each bath took forty-five minutes to an hour because my personal care \nworker had to undress me, transfer me to the bath, wash me, dry me, dress me and \ntransfer me back to the wheelchair. \n27. I have a home health nurse that provides wound care for the wound on my foot, \nand also checks my vital signs. \n28. I had eight children.  Two died as infants,  One of my daughters died when she \nwas an adult as a result of seizures, and my youngest son died in 2010 from \ncancer.  I have four living children.  Three of them do not provide me with any \nhelp:  a son who lives in about 22 miles away in Rayville, and who has health \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 49 of 202\n\nproblems similar to mine; a daughter who lives in Choudrant, LA and cannot \ndrive due to seizures; and a second daughter in Rayville that I only see one or two \ntimes each year.  \n29. I have one son who lives in the same apartment complex as I do; however, he has \nosteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis.  He can and does check in on me, but he \ncannot lift me due to his own health issues, nor can he help with toileting or other \nADLs.  When I am not feeling well, he sometimes stays with me at night; \nhowever, he is often in the hospital attending to his own health problems.  \n30. When my son is able, he helps me by putting the dinner that was prepared earlier \nby my personal care worker on a plate, and putting the plate of food on the table \nfor me. \n31. My husband died approximately twenty years ago.  I have no other family that \ncan assist me. \n32. If I continue to receive only thirty hours per week, I believe my health will \ndeteriorate and I will be forced to go into a nursing home. \n33. I also wish to continue to control my own life and do not want to move to a \nnursing home where that opportunity will be taken from me. \n34. I do not think I should be forced into a nursing home.  I know from past \nexperience that I can remain healthy and safe in my own home, if I am provided \nwith adequate assistance.  I want to stay in my own home. \n/s/ Mary Dunn             11-9-2011   \nMary Dunn              Date \n  6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 50 of 202\n\nExhibit 22  Declaration of Bessie Foreman\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 51 of 202\n\nDECLARATION OF BESSIE FOREMAN \nBessie Foreman subscribes under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, as \nfollows: \n1.  My name is Bessie Foreman.  I live alone in Iowa, Louisiana.  I am 86 years old. \n2.  I am eligible for and receive Medicaid.  Until May of 2011, I was receiving thirty-\neight hours per week of Long-Term Personal Care Services.  I have been \nreceiving Long-term Personal Care Services for approximately seven years. \n3.  In March, I was told that my hours would be reduced from thirty-five to twenty-\nsix hours per week.  I appealed that decision, and on or around May 1, 2011, my \nhours were reduced to thirty-two hours per week pending my appeal hearing. \n4.  In May of 2011, my daughter participated in my hearing, which was held over the \nphone.  Because the hearing was over the phone, I would not have been able to \nhear the proceedings, so my daughter represented me.  My daughter participated \nfrom my home using my phone.  After the hearing she told me that the Judge said \nthat the state’s decision to reduce my hours would be upheld. \n5.  My hours were reduced to 26 hours per week in June of 2011. \n6.  Since May of 2011, my daughter has been doing what my worker does not have \ntime to do; however, this is only temporary, while we try to find out if there is any \nway my services can be restored to 38 hours a week.  If my hours of home care \nhave to stay at 26 per week, I will have to enter a nursing home. \n7.  Right now, my daughter helps me to get dinner, she assists me to clean myself \nafter incontinence episodes and redress.  My daughter also helps to get me ready \nfor bed in the evening.  In addition, to save time, my daughter has been helping \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 52 of 202\n\nmy personal care worker bathe me, so that there is time for the worker to \ncomplete other tasks such as meal preparation, household chores and assisting me \nwith toileting. \n8.  My daughter and I have had discussions about me needing more assistance than \nthe twenty-six hours per week that I am provided and the possibility of me \nentering a nursing home.   If I do not have more help, I do not think I can avoid \nhaving to enter a nursing home. \n9.  My daughter cannot continue to provide the help I need to stay in my home.  She \nlives approximately thirty miles from my home.  She has two part-time jobs, and \nshe has had to cut back on hours at one of these jobs.  She needs to return to \nworking the hours she was working before my hours were reduced.  She has many \nfriends and a boyfriend that she enjoys seeing in the evenings and on weekends \nand she has not been able to spend time with these friends because she assists me \nevery morning and every night. \n10. My daughter will continue to be there for me in an emergency, and will continue \nto see me a few times each week, but she has told me that she cannot and will not \nkeep assisting me on a daily basis.  If my hours of LT-PCS are not restored, I will \nhave no choice but to enter a nursing home. \n11. I have heart problems, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, cataracts in both eyes, and I am \nhard of hearing. I have had right knee replacement and three back surgeries.  I had \nsurgery on my right arm, which has left my right arm fairly immobile.  I am also \nobese. \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 53 of 202\n\n12. With these impairments, I cannot do anything for myself, other than feed myself.  \nIf I am alone, I cannot walk to get a glass of water or get food, cannot get on and \noff the toilet, cannot dress or undress myself and cannot rise to a standing \nposition.  If I am in my wheelchair, I cannot propel the chair very far without \nbecoming completely fatigued.  In addition, I do not have the strength to prepare \nmeals, even simple meals such as a sandwich, do my laundry or my other \nhousehold chores. \n13. Since my hours have been reduced, my personal care worker has not been able to \nattend to all of my care needs.  She leaves at noon everyday, which means she \nonly helps me to get one meal each day, rather than the three meals and snacks I \nshould have because of my diabetes.  She is not available to help me use the toilet \nin the afternoon or evening, undress me and dress me for bed, or help me into bed.   \n14. In the morning, my personal care worker helps me to get out of bed, bathe, brush \nmy teeth, brush my hair, wash my face, prepare my breakfast, and while I am \neating she attends to household chores.  Since my hours have been reduced, I no \nlonger get a bath daily.  Typically, I bathe only three times each week.  Because I \nam obese and have incontinent episodes, I need to bathe daily, and I think that it \nwould be healthier for me to do so. \n15. Because my hours have been reduced, my daughter has been assisting my \npersonal care worker to bathe me.  Bathing, even with my daughter assisting my \npersonal care worker, takes approximately 45 minutes to one hour, because I need \nhelp getting into the shower then my worker and my daughter bathe me.  Once I \nam bathed, my worker and my daughter then help me out of the shower, dry me \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 54 of 202\n\nand dress me.  Without my daughter’s assistance this task would probably take \napproximately one hours and thirty minutes. \n16. I am incontinent of bowel and bladder.  When I have accidents, I need immediate \nassistance to clean myself.  My personal care worker is not with me past noon, so \nshe is not able to assist me.  If my daughter is not with me when this happens, I \nhave had to wait for her to return to my home or have had to wait until my \npersonal care worker arrives in the morning until I can be cleaned.   \n17. I have two to three incontinent episodes each day and must be cleaned after each \naccident.  Because of my size, it takes either my personal care worker or my \ndaughter approximately thirty minutes to undress me, clean me, change my pad, \nredress me. \n18. I believe that the surgeries and my arthritis are the major reasons that I can no \nlonger physically care for myself.  My doctor has told me that my left knee is in \nneed of replacement, too, but this surgery is not yet scheduled. \n19. I have great difficulty walking and must use a wheelchair, a cane or a walker \naround my home.  When I leave my home, I always use a wheelchair.  I do not \nwalk unattended for fear of falling.  It seems that I fall almost once a month, and \nas a result of a fall in March of 2010, I broke my ankle.  I am fearful of what a fall \ncould do to my physical condition, so I always try to have someone with me when \nI walk.  \n20. When I use the wheelchair, I have difficulty propelling my own, so whenever I \nwant to move in the chair, someone usually pushes me. \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 55 of 202\n\n21. If there is a table or something to hang on to, I can move my wheelchair by \npulling myself along the table or other object and moving by chair that way.  I \ncannot even do this for long distances because I become fatigued. \n22. When I stand, I become very dizzy and must wait for that feeling to subside \nbefore moving, again. This is another reason, I do not like to stand or attempt to \ntransfer into my bed or any other surface when I am alone. \n23. As a result of the back surgeries, I no longer walk completely erect.  My body is \nalways in a position of leaning forward when I am standing.  I also walk very \nslowly. \n24. I take 18 different medications, including insulin injections.  Due to my diabetes \nand the number of medications that I take, it is important that I eat healthy meals \nand snacks on a regular schedule.  Because my worker is only here until noon, she \nis only able to give me breakfast and sometimes a mid-morning snack.  My \nworker prepares my lunch and dinner before leaving my home, but I must depend \non my daughter to get my meals and place them on the table. \n25. My husband died in 1998.  When he was living we both worked hard to raise our \nchildren, and make sure we could provide for them.  We owned a grocery store \nand were also rice farmers.   \n26. Only the daughter I have mentioned assists me with my care.  None of my other \nchildren assist me with my care, and I have no other family that assists me. \n27. If I do not get more assistance, I am afraid that a nursing home will be my only \noption.  \n28. I do not want to go into a nursing home.     \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 56 of 202\n\n29. After raising a family and assisting my husband with the family businesses, I \nthought that I could live the remaining years of my life in my own home.  I \nbelieve that I should have the opportunity to do just that.  And, I believe I should \nbe provided with the necessary assistance to do that. \n30. I do not believe I would receive the assistance I need to get out of bed on a regular \nbasis and believe that my health would decline as a result if I were in a nursing \nhome. \n31. I want to continue living in my own home, where I am relatively healthy and in \ncontrol of my own life. \n \n/s/ Bessie Foreman            11/9/11     \nBessie Foreman            Date \n  6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 57 of 202\n\nExhibit 23 Declaration of Estelle Curtain\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 58 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 59 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 60 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 61 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 62 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 63 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 64 of 202\n\nExhibit 24 Declaration of Mitchell LaPlante\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 65 of 202\n\n \n1  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n2 \n________________________________________ \n3 \nHELEN PITS, KENNETH ROMAN,     ) \n4  DENISE HODGES, and RICKII AINEY, on   )  C.A.

A true and correct copy of \n21 \nmy curriculum vitae is attached hereto as Exhibit A. \n22 \n2.  My academic research has addressed the demography and epidemiology of health and \n23 \ndisability and long-term care, how the prevalence of disability varies by race and \n24 \nethnicity and by state; the relationship of disability with various chronic illness and \n25 \nimpairments; the relationship of disability to use of health care and health care \n26 \n27  expenditures; the relationship of disability and insurance rates; employment of \n1 \n \n \n \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 66 o  f 202\n    \n\n \n1  individuals with disabilities; the housing of individuals, families and children with \n2 \ndisabilities; the use of, and unmet need for, assistive technology; and the use of and \n3 \nunmet need for personal assistance with activities of daily living and adverse \n4 \nconsequences associated with such unmet needs.    \n5 \n3.  I have served, by invitation, on several high-ranking national and international expert \n6 \npanels in the fields of disability research and policy, including the Institute of Medicine, \n7 \n8  the National Academy of Social Insurance, the National Institutes on Health, the Social \n9  Security Administration Disability Research Institute Advisory Panel, the United Nations \n10 \nand the World Health Organization.  I have advised Congress on the costs of the \n11 \nCommunity Choice Act and similar legislation, testified before the United States Senate \n12 \nFinance Committee, and advised the Congressional Budget Office and Centers for \n13 \nMedicare and Medicaid Services on the costs and cost effectiveness of community long \n14 \nterm services and support.  I have also served as a consultant to the State of California \n15 \n16  Medicaid Infrastructure Grant and the California Governor’s Committee on Disability.  I \n17 \nwas a member of the Institute of Medicine study panel that produced the book Disability \n18 \nin America:  Toward a National Agenda for Prevention and the National Academy of \n19 \nSocial Insurance Disability Policy Panel.  In 2007, I received a Commendation Award \n20 \nfrom the National Association of Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers \n21 \nrecognizing my career accomplishments in disability research, teaching, and policy.  I am \n22 \n23  recognized as one of the foremost researchers in the field of disability in the United \n24  States and internationally.  As Co-Principal Investigator of the Center on Personal \n25 \nAssistance Services, a Rehabilitation Research and Training Center funded primarily by \n26 \nthe National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, and Co-Director of the \n27 \n2 \n \n \n \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 67 o  f 202\n    \n\n \n1  UCSF Disability Statistics Center, I have been consulted widely as an authority on \n2 \ndisability statistics, epidemiology, and disability policy.   \n3 \n4.  I am a member of many professional organizations; have given numerous juried and \n4 \ninvited presentations at professional society conferences; am a popular reviewer for \n5 \nseveral professional journals, currently on the Editorial Board of the Disability and \n6 \nHealth Journal and the Journals of Gerontology: Social Sciences and previously on the \n7 \n8  Editorial Board of the Disability Studies Quarterly.   \n9  5.  I am the current recipient of research grants from the National Institute on Disability and \n10 \nRehabilitation Research, establishing the Personal Assistance Services Rehabilitation \n11 \nResearch and Training Center, and the San Diego State University Research Foundation.  \n12 \nI have previously received research grants from the National Institute on Aging, the \n13 \nSocial Science Research Council, the United States Departments of Health and Human \n14 \nServices and Education, and the California Department of Health Care Services Office of \n15 \n16  Disability and Health.  \n17 \n6.

I recently published, with co-authors, the results of a study of unmet need for personal \n6 \nassistance services, which relied on data from the National Health Interview Survey, a \n7 \n8  large, nationally representative survey of individuals living in households conducted by \n9  the Census Bureau for the United States National Center for Health Statistics (LaPlante, \n10 \nKaye, Kang, & Harrington, 2004). For some individuals, unmet need occurred when they \n11 \nneeded help with activities of daily living but did not receive any help at all. However, \n12 \nthat was rare. Most people with unmet needs for personal assistance got some help, but \n13 \nthey lacked help with certain activities (such as getting help with personal care like \n14 \nbathing and dressing, but not getting any help with meal preparation), or they did not get \n15 \n16  sufficient help in one or more activities (such as only getting help with preparing \n17 \nbreakfast but not other meals). We found that, when elderly and disabled individuals who \n18 \nwere in need of personal assistance services with activities of daily living did not have \n19 \nadequate levels of help, they had higher rates of adverse consequences in 48 of 53 \n20 \nmeasures tested than those whose needs were met, including experiencing discomfort \n21 \n(such as going hungry), wasting (losing weight unintentionally and dehydration), injuries \n22 \n23  due to falls, burns, bedsores, contractures (limbs that cannot be straightened out) and \n24  dissatisfaction with help (such as not being satisfied with scheduled hours or availability \n25 \nof help when it is actually needed).  \n26 \n27 \n4 \n \n \n \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 69 o  f 202\n    \n\n \n1  8.  These problems are particularly acute for disabled individuals who live alone rather than \n2 \nwith family members.  Individuals who live alone report higher unmet needs than those \n3 \nliving with others (31 percent versus 19 percent) (LaPlante, et al., 2004) and experience \n4 \nhigher rates of adverse consequences.  Such individuals are highly vulnerable and their \n5 \nmore detached informal networks do not compensate for lack of access to or reductions in \n6 \npublic services. \n7 \n8  9.  Having inadequate levels of help compromises the safety, comfort, and hygiene of \n9  individuals requiring help with ADLs and IADLs, reducing their ability to live \n10 \nindependently and increasing their risk of institutionalization and death.   \n11 \n10. Unmet needs are especially serious for persons needing help with activities of daily living \n12 \n(“ADLs”) such as when individuals go unbathed, remain in the same clothing for an \n13 \nextended period, are left in a bed or chair longer than is acceptable, or are unassisted \n14 \nwhen they need to go to the bathroom or eat.  These activities involve satisfying primary \n15 \n16  biological functions that, if not fulfilled, cannot be tolerated for long and have immediate \n17 \nand serious consequences leading to death, institutionalization, injury, or worsening \n18 \nhealth (Allen & Mor, 1997; Gaugler, Kane, Kane, & Newcomer, 2005; LaPlante, et al., \n19 \n2004).  \n20 \n11. A link between unmet need in ADLs and increased risk of death has been established in a \n21 \nlongitudinal study of older persons with dementia (Gaugler, et al., 2005).  Persons with \n22 \n23  two or more unmet ADL needs (measured as not getting any or enough help as assessed \n24  by caregivers) were 1.4 times as likely to die within 18 months, controlling for age, \n25 \ngender, and other demographics, severity of disability, and cognitive and behavioral \n26 \nfunctioning.  The study did not assess unmet needs in instrumental activities of daily \n27 \n5 \n \n \n \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 70 o  f 202\n    \n\n \n1  living (“IADLs”).  While the study is limited to persons with dementia, it is important in \n2 \ndemonstrating that many persons with severe disabilities are at higher risk of death when \n3 \ntheir needs go unmet.  \n4 \n12. Gaugler and colleagues (2005) also established a link between unmet need in ADLs and \n5 \nbeing admitted within 18 months to a nursing home. Individuals with unmet needs in two \n6 \nor more ADLs (measured as not getting any or enough help) were 1.8 times as likely to \n7 \n8  enter a nursing home than those whose needs were met, controlling for age, gender, and \n9  other demographics, severity of disability, and cognitive and behavioral functioning.    \n10 \n13. A retrospective mortality study of older persons who needed home care before their death \n11 \n(Nanda, Bourbonniere, Wetle, & Teno, 2010) investigated the perceptions of the \n12 \ndecedents’ survivors, and found that 23 percent experienced unmet needs for home care \n13 \nbefore their death, and that after adjusting for age, gender, insurance, education, race, \n14 \ncause of death, functional status, and place of residence, decedents who were reported as \n15 \n16  not receiving enough care were 1.8 times as likely to die in a nursing home than those \n17 \nwho had adequate care.  \n18 \n14. One study has found that the rate of hospital admission was 1.5 times as high for frail \n19 \nolder persons with unmet needs (measured as not getting any or enough help) prior to \n20 \ntheir enrollment in a formal services program and 1.3 times as high 6 months after \n21 \nenrollment (Sands, et al., 2006).  However, after 6 months, the provision of adequate \n22 \n23  services eliminated the higher risk of hospitalization for those who had entered the study \n24  with unmet needs.  In this study, unmet need was measured as the absence of any help in \n25 \none or more ADLs rather than insufficient help. The study suggests that having adequate \n26 \nhelp with ADLs is protective against hospitalization.  \n27 \n6 \n \n \n \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 71 o  f 202\n    \n\n \n1  15. Higher rates of depression have been found among older persons with unmet needs in \n2 \nIADLs and ADLs compared to those whose needs are met (Choi & McDougall, 2009). In \n3 \nthis study, unmet need was measured as not having enough help with formal services in \n4 \nIADLs or ADLs, as well as lacking other formal supportive and enabling services.   \n5 \n16. While most studies have focused on unmet needs in ADLs, unmet needs in IADLs also \n6 \ncreate adverse consequences that impact individuals’ paying their bills, keeping their \n7 \n8  home clean and managed, communicating, managing their medications, and getting \n9  around and participating in their communities.  As a group, these may appear to be less \n10 \nserious than unmet needs in ADLs, but in fact, some can be quite serious.  Lack of help \n11 \nmanaging medications can lead to dire health results if medications are not taken \n12 \nappropriately, and lack of help to participate in social and community activities can lead \n13 \nto isolation and depression. Lack of help shopping for groceries and preparing meals \n14 \nelevates the risk of poor nutrition, which can lead to unintentional weight loss and \n15 \n16  dehydration.   \n17 \n17. In summary, unmet need in IADLs and ADLs, are associated with numerous life \n18 \nthreatening adverse events, reduced mental and physical health, discomfort, and \n19 \ndiminished quality of life, all of which threaten the ability of individuals to live safely \n20 \nand independently in their own homes.  This is the case even if the unmet need in ADLs \n21 \nor IADLs is temporary, but especially so if those unmet needs last over time.  The \n22 \n23  correlations with negative consequences are especially strong among persons with severe \n24  levels of disability and those who live alone and lack familial support. \n25 \n18.  My colleagues and I have analyzed historical Medicaid spending patterns on institutional \n26 \nservices versus what are called home- and community-based services (HCBS) under \n27 \n7 \n \n \n \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 72 o  f 202\n    \n\n \n1  Medicaid, including the Louisiana Medicaid program (Kaye, LaPlante, & Harrington, \n2 \n2009). The Medicaid program is the primary financier of long term care for persons with \n3 \nlow incomes and assets. Medicaid requires all participating states to provide institutional \n4 \nlong term care services. Medicaid also allows states to provide home and community \n5 \nbased services as an option, one that is designed to allow states to provide long term care \n6 \nmore cost-effectively while allowing greater choice to individuals to live more \n7 \n8  independently and in the least restrictive setting. Some states do not fully utilize the \n9  options that are available to them, which results in the underfunding of community based \n10 \nservices and the overfunding of institutional services, a situation that is not cost-effective. \n11 \nResearch has shown that states that provide less home and community based services \n12 \nhave higher risks of institutionalization (Muramatsu et al., 2007). My colleagues and I \n13 \nhave also found that states that provide less home and community based services overpay \n14 \nfor institutional services, which is not cost effective (Kaye, LaPlante, & Harrington, \n15 \n16  2009). \n17 \n19. The state of Louisiana has, in the past decade, utilized several options to serve thousands \n18 \nmore individuals under the Medicaid personal care services program and under several \n19 \nMedicaid waivers. In 2004, 10.6 % of the state of Louisiana’s Medicaid expenditures for \n20 \nAged and Disabled Adult  long term services and supports went to community services \n21 \nwith the rest to institutions. By 2009, 32.5% of the state of Louisiana’s Medicaid \n22 \n23  expenditures for Aged and Disabled Adults on long term services and supports went to \n24  community services with the rest to institutions. Among all the states, Louisiana now \n25 \nranks in the middle in the amount of total Medicaid long term services and supports \n26 \nexpenditures that go to community based services. While Louisiana has shown much \n27 \n8 \n \n \n \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 73 o  f 202\n    \n\n \n1  progress, the state still has more progress to make, as is suggested by the states of Oregon \n2 \nand Washington which spent two-thirds or more of their total long term services and \n3 \nsupports budget for Aged and Disabled Adults on community services.  \n4 \n20.  Based on an analysis of a decade of Medicaid spending data from several states, my \n5 \ncolleagues and I have observed that several states that have expanded home and \n6 \ncommunity-based services, as Louisiana has done over the past decade, have achieved \n7 \n8  reductions in institutional spending and long-term cost savings (Kaye, LaPlante, & \n9  Harrington, 2009).  This is mainly attributable to the greater cost of institutional care as \n10 \ncompared to home and community-based care.  A national study (Kitchener et al.: 2006) \n11 \nshowed that the average total public expenditure on a recipient of Medicaid home and \n12 \ncommunity-based services was substantially less per year than a person receiving \n13 \ninstitutional services. However, cost savings have been offset in some states, including \n14 \nLouisiana, when they have also increased institutional reimbursement rates (see separate \n15 \n16  testimony of Dr. H. Stephen Kaye).  \n17 \n21.  Providing more personal assistance services is not only cost-effective, it also reduces \n18 \nunmet needs in the community and adverse consequences leading to hospitalization and \n19 \ninstitutionalization. The reverse is also true.  A state like Louisiana that has recently \n20 \ndeveloped and expanded its community-based long term care programs and that then \n21 \nsubstantially reduces spending on home and community-based services, by limiting \n22 \n23  hours, as Louisiana proposes to implement, is likely to experience an overall increase in \n24  long-term care costs resulting from increased utilization of institutions and other costs \n25 \nassociated with increased levels of unmet needs (Mollica, Kassner, & Houser, 2009).  \n26 \n27 \n9 \n \n \n \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 74 o  f 202\n    \n\n \n1  22.  Louisiana state has proposed to cap the number of hours in its Medicaid personal care \n2 \noption program (“LT-PCS”) to 32 hours a week, where it had previously had a cap of 42 \n3 \nhours a week.  Given the extremely restrictive eligibility limits for the LT-PCS program, \n4 \n1 such a reduction in hours would result in actual care hours falling well below the level \n5 \nthat many people eligible for the program, particularly those with the most serious care \n6 \nneeds, require to avoid the adverse consequences detailed above, including discomfort \n7 \n8  (such as going hungry), wasting (losing weight unintentionally and dehydration), injuries \n9  due to falls, burns, bedsores, contractures (limbs that cannot be straightened out), risk of \n10 \ninstitutionalization, and death.    \n11 \n23.  The proposed reduction is of sufficient magnitude that it is likely to create unmet needs \n12 \nand an increase in the many adverse consequences that are documented in the several \n13 \nstudies discussed in this declaration.  The creation of unmet need is likely to increase \n14 \ninstitutionalization and other health care costs, including hospitalization costs, resulting \n15 \n16  from treating these unmet needs. While the average amount of hours cut may be as low as \n17 \n3 hours a week, the reductions will be on the order of 7 to 10 hours a week for persons \n18 \nwho have already demonstrated the most acute needs for services. Thus, the reductions in \n19 \nhours will have a disproportionate negative impact on individuals who have the most  \n20 \n \n21 \n \n22 \n23   \n24 \n                                                 \n25  1   Unlike many states, Louisiana requires that persons meet a nursing facility level of care \nand demonstrate, according to objective criteria, that they face a substantial possibility of \n26  deterioration in mental or physical condition or functioning if either home and community-based \nservices or nursing home services are not provided in less than 120 days.  People who meet these \n27  criteria are likely to need a substantial amount of assistance with ADLs, especially if they live \nalone or otherwise lack unpaid care givers.  \n10 \n \n \n \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 75 o  f 202\n    \n\n \n1  severe disabilities and individuals who live alone.  \n2 \nExecuted this _2___ day of March,  2011 at San Francisco, California. \n3 \n \n4 \n5 \n           \n          Mitchell LaPlante \n6 \n \n7  References \n8  Allen, S.

My name is C.M.  I am 55 years old and I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana with my \nwife and my daughter, R.M.   \n2.  R.M. is my only daughter.  She is twenty-six years old. At the age of eighteen, when \nshe was a student at LSU, she was in an automobile accident.  She suffered a \ntraumatic brain injury.  After a lengthy period of hospitalization and rehabilitation, \nshe returned home to live with us. \n3.  Our only other child, our son, died in 2007. \n4.  As a result of her injuries, R.M. has been diagnosed with dementia, peripheral \nvascular disease and depression. She has hemiparesis (paralysis) on her left side, and \nataxia (gross lack of coordination) on her right side.  R.M. has no fine motor control \nand her gross motor control is very limited. She has double vision.  \n5.  R.M. has little functional use of her hands.  She cannot walk without assistance and \nhas little coordination.   She cannot propel herself in a wheelchair. She has no fine \nmotor control and her gross motor control is very limited. She has a history of \ndecubitis. She needs assistance with all of her activities of daily living, including \nwalking, eating, transferring, toileting, bathing, dressing, and attending to personal \nhygiene. She cannot prepare a meal for herself, manage her medication or dial the \nphone without difficulty. The only task she can even participate in is eating, and she \ncan barely bring a fork or spoon to her mouth. She needs to be spoon-fed much of the \ntime. \n  1 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 80 of 202\n\n6.  She can operate a remote control for the television, but if she drops or misplaces it, \nsomeone must fetch it for her. \n7.  The most challenging effect of R.M.’s injury is her lack of short-term memory, lack \nof inhibition, and poor judgment.  She frequently has outbursts of anger and \nfrustration because of her situation, and takes her frustration out on either her family \nor her paid supports. She is combative and disruptive.  She also wakes up at least \nonce every night and needs help with toileting.  \n8.  R.M.’s lack of judgment makes caring for her very challenging.  Although she cannot \nwalk, and she will try to get up and walk if left unattended.  When she tries to walk \non her own, she falls.  \n9.  If her mother is home, R.M. insists on being cared for by her.  She calls out to every \n15 to 20 minutes, to do little things that often do not really need to be done.  For \nexample, R.M. decided recently that she was not getting enough to eat, and she cried \nout for food and snacks virtually constantly.  We would give her a snack, and twenty \nminutes later, she would forget having eaten and call out for us to feed her again.  \nDespite our efforts to resist, she gained weight.  If we do not respond to her when she \nwants something, she will scream and scream until we do respond.  \n10. I am the sole support for my family.  I work full time as an accountant for an \ninsurance company.  I also run my own CPA business at home, which requires me to \nwork approximately 40 hours a week between January and April every year.  Other \ntimes, I devote 10-20 hours per week to the business.  My wife attends school and \nspends hours per day studying, and she also volunteers at her church. During tax time, \nshe puts in about 20 hours a week working in my tax business.  \n  2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 81 of 202\n\n11. Since her accident, my wife and I have cared for R.M. in our home. She has received \nLT-PCS from the State of Louisiana since approximately 2006.  This assistance is \ncritical to enabling us to continue to keep her at home with us.  The LT-PCS worker \nis there from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays \nand from 8:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on Wednesdays, while both my wife and I are out of \nthe home.  \n12. For the last two years, until June of 2011, R.M. had been receiving 36.5 hours \nthrough the LT-PCS program. Before that, she was receiving 38 hours of care.  She \nneeds at least that amount of care.   \n13. R.M.’s needs have not decreased over the last two years—in fact, her condition has \ngotten worse in a number of ways—in her cognitive ability, her mental state, her \nvision, her ability to communicate, and her behavioral symptoms.  She needs more \nassistance now than she did when she was approved for 36.5 hours of care in ADL’s \nof transferring, dressing, personal hygiene, bathing, and locomotion.   She is \nbecoming more difficult to care for because of her behavioral issues. \n14. In June of 2011, I received the attached notice (Attachment A) that stated that R.M.’s \nhours would be reduced to 29 a week, based on a new method for determining service \nhours. I filed an appeal of this action.  While the appeal was pending, R.M. was able \nto get 32 hours a week of LT-PCS. I was able to pay $50 a week out of pocket to \ncover the hours of care that had been taken away while the appeal was pending.   \n15. I filed R.M.’s appeal the last week of June, 2011.  I did not request any postponement \nof the hearing, but I did request an in-person hearing so the judge could see R.M..  \nThe hearing was postponed once because the judge did not realize it was supposed to \n  3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 82 of 202\n\nbe in person, and once the State asked for a continuance so they could have their \nlawyer present.  The hearing did not take place until October 5, 2011, and the \ndecision denying the appeal was dated October 25, 2011. \n16. I understood that the Advocacy Center requested an emergency waiver slot for R.M. \nin July of 2011, while her appeal was pending.  I understand that the waiver program \nwould provide her with at least 36.5 hours a week of personal care.  I received a \ndenial of that request, on the ground that she had to be approved to receive the \nmaximum amount of LT-PCS, 32 hours a week, in order to apply for an emergency \nwaiver slot. \n17. I was able to obtain a statement from R.M.’s physician, Dr. Mario Moreno, to submit \nat the administrative hearing.  It is attached as Attachment B.  Dr. Moreno also \ntestified by telephone at the hearing. \n18. The decision on R.M.’s administrative appeal to get the maximum number of hours is \nattached as Attachment C.  As I understand it, the decision said that R.M. couldn’t be \nawarded the maximum number of hours of LT-PCS, 32 a week, because she needs \nmore than that to avoid going to a nursing home. \n19. If R.M.’s hours of LT-PCS are not restored, a 24-hour nursing home is the solution \nfor R.M. to obtain the assistance she needs. My wife and I are already providing 136 \nhours of week of care and cannot assume the additional home-based care hours that \nR.M. needs. The 24-hour care that my wife and I provide for R.M. on weekends, and \nthe 16 to 20 hours a day every weekday, are all that we can do.  We love R.M., but \nwe are simply exhausted both physically and emotionally from the demands of her \ncare. We have not been one night away from R.M. since her accident in 2003. \n  4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 83 of 202\n\n20. I have taken the first steps toward placing R.M. in a nursing home, by contacting the \nState’s Options in Long-term Care program and completing the preliminary \napplication.   I was told that she was eligible and that the next step is to choose a \nnursing home to complete the registration process.  I will not take this step until I \nexhaust all avenues of appeal. As any parent would, I want to avoid institutional care \nfor my daughter because, as with most disability cases, home-based care is better for \nRegan. \nDate: November 9, 2011        /s/C.M.         \n            C.M. \n  5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 84 of 202\n\nAttachment A\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 85 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 86 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 87 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 88 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 89 of 202\n\nAttachment B\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 90 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 91 of 202\n\nAttachment C\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 92 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 93 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 94 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 95 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 96 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 97 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 98 of 202\n\nExhibit 26 30 La.

All right.\n2   BY MS. HAHN:  \n3       Q.   So I'm just going to sort of explain to you my \n4   understanding of how it works and I want you to correct \n5   me if I get it wrong.  \n6            It's to identify people who are at high risk \n7   of institutionalization in the coming months, and in \n8   order to determine if a person meets that risk there's \n9   a specific set of things that they're required to have, \n10   and there's a list of eight different things, and this \n11   protocol says that at least four of these have to be \n12   present for institutional risks to be found; is that \n13   right?\n14       A.   That's right.\n15       Q.   And I believe you said that we negotiated \n16   about that during the Barthelemy case and changed \n17   that.  Was the change that we made that you would only \n18   have to have at least three of those factors?\n19       A.   That's right.\n20       Q.   And the other change that we made during the \n21   negotiations over the Barthelemy case was that we also \n22   said that if they did not meet these they could provide \n23   medical documentation that they were at risk of either \n24   institutionalization, or I think it was substantial \n25   deterioration and mental or physical condition if they \nBaton Rouge Court Reporters, LLC\n225-292-8686\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 119 of 202\n\nHugh Eley\nFebruary 23, 2011\n141\n1   didn't get care within 120 days?\n2       A.   Yeah, that's the process we just described.\n3       Q.   Okay.  Under prior nursing home placement, I \n4   just want to relate this if I can.  I'm looking over on \n5   this same page that says institutionalization risk on \n6   the Exhibit 3 -- \n7       A.   Uh-huh (affirmative response)\n8       Q.   -- these numbers and letters off to the \n9   right.  It says under prior nursing home placement, it \n10   says CC-7 equals 1 in brackets.  Can you relate that to \n11   Exhibit 1, the MDS-HC?  Is that referring to questions \n12   that are asked on Exhibit 1?\n13       A.   I honestly don't know.\n14       Q.   Can you look, for example, under Section CC?  \n15       A.   You're consulting your MDS expert and I don't \n16   have mine in the room, but I'll look and see.\n17       Q.   Section CC is on the first page.  \n18       A.   Okay.\n19       Q.   So under CC-7, what does CC-7 say?\n20       A.   It says, \"Prior nursing home placement.  \n21   Resided in a nursing home during five years prior to \n22   the case opening.\"\n23       Q.   Doesn't it actually say \"resided in a nursing \n24   home at any time during five years prior to case \n25   opening\"?\nBaton Rouge Court Reporters, LLC\n225-292-8686\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 120 of 202\n\nHugh Eley\nFebruary 23, 2011\n162\n1       A.   Yes.\n2       Q.   Has it ever been higher than that?\n3       A.   I don't believe it's ever been higher than 14 \n4   dollars, no.\n5       Q.   And since then would the reductions in the \n6   LT-PCS rate be reflected in the rules in the Louisiana \n7   Register?\n8       A.   Yes.\n9       Q.   Would that be the best source of information \n10   for that?\n11       A.   Yes.\n12       Q.   If you'll look at page 2 of Document 1949, is \n13   that the document shows the maximum number of hours per \n14   week that can be awarded to different groupings of \n15   people on the LT-PCS Program?\n16       A.   Yes.\n17       Q.   So that's your current -- that's the guide \n18   that's being used in the current program?\n19       A.   Yes, I believe so.\n20       Q.   Okay.  Now if you'll turn to pages 13 and 14 \n21   of Document 1949, there's a document that explains how \n22   Louisiana determines Long-Term Personal Care Services \n23   hours.  Is that a document that describes how -- that \n24   partially describes how a person's ADL index in the \n25   guide on page 2 is determined?\nBaton Rouge Court Reporters, LLC\n225-292-8686\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 121 of 202\n\nHugh Eley\nFebruary 23, 2011\n163\n1       A.   Yes, I think that's what that does.  It's an \n2   explanation of how that ADL index number is derived \n3   based on your answers to the MDS-HC.\n4       Q.   And the MDS-HC is the document that was Eley \n5   Exhibit 1; is that correct?  \n6       A.   Yes.\n7       Q.   So if I understand it correctly, to get the \n8   ADL index you look at only four activities of daily \n9   living:  getting in or out of bed or a chair, also \n10   known as transferring, that's one; going from a lying \n11   to a sitting position in bed, bed mobility, using the \n12   toilet, and eating; is that correct?\n13       A.   That's what it says.\n14       Q.   Now when you talk about eating, a minute ago \n15   we went over the questions on the MDS-HC dealing with \n16   meal preparation.  Eating is different from meal \n17   preparation; is it not?  \n18       A.   That's my understanding, yes.  I'm not an \n19   expert in this assessment tool, but that's my \n20   understanding.\n21       Q.   Eating means actually getting food into your \n22   mouth or into your stomach if you don't eat by mouth; \n23   is that right?\n24       A.   I believe so, yes.\n25       Q.   So that the types of activities you're talking \nBaton Rouge Court Reporters, LLC\n225-292-8686\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 122 of 202\n\nHugh Eley\nFebruary 23, 2011\n164\n1   about here are pretty basic; would you agree with me?\n2       A.   Yes.\n3       Q.   The people that score in the highest group \n4   that would get the 32 hours of the LT-PCS have to score \n5   a 14 or 15 or their ADL index, right?\n6       A.   That's correct.\n7       Q.   How do you get to the score of 14 or 15; do \n8   you know?  Do you know what you have to be able to do \n9   or not be able to do in order to get to that point?\n10       A.   No, I don't.  I mean it's a cumulative \n11   number.  It's based on your answers to these questions \n12   about these ADLs, but exactly what -- that's as much as \n13   I know.\n14       Q.   Okay.  So you don't actually know how the \n15   scores are assigned to the ADL index except for through \n16   an algorithm of some kind?\n17       A.   It's based on the answers to the ADL questions \n18   and how you answer those questions.  I don't think it's \n19   an algorithm.  I think it's just additive, but I may be \n20   wrong.\n21       Q.   I'm showing you what's been marked Eley \n22   Exhibit 4.  Could you identify that document?\n23            (ELEY EXHIBIT NO. 4 FOR IDENTIFICATION WAS \n24   MARKED FOR THE RECORD.)\n25       A.   It appears to be the questions on the MDS and \nBaton Rouge Court Reporters, LLC\n225-292-8686\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 123 of 202\n\nHugh Eley\nFebruary 23, 2011\n165\n1   how they relate to the calculation of the index.  I \n2   don't think I've ever seen this particular document \n3   before.\n4       Q.   It says at the bottom, \"prepared by Mandi \n5   Jones.\"  Is that somebody that works for you?\n6       A.   Yes.\n7       Q.   I'm showing you a document that's been marked \n8   Exhibit 5.  Can you identify that document?\n9            (ELEY EXHIBIT NO. 5 FOR IDENTIFICATION WAS \n10   MARKED FOR THE RECORD.)\n11       A.   Again, I don't know that I've seen it before, \n12   but it says, \"Detailed Explanation of Scoring Method.\"\n13       Q.   Does it appear to be an explanation of the \n14   construction of the ADL index?\n15       A.   I wouldn't say that.  It looks more like it's \n16   some sort of instructions about how to score the \n17   specific responses on the assessment tool.\n18       Q.   Are you aware of any other document that shows \n19   actually how the ADL index is constructed?\n20       A.   I would assume it's in the MDS-HC manuals, the \n21   training manuals and the user manuals for those things \n22   that are put out by the people who developed the tool, \n23   but I don't know that for sure.\n24       Q.   Does your Department have a copy of something \n25   that would show how the ADL index is constructed?\nBaton Rouge Court Reporters, LLC\n225-292-8686\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 124 of 202\n\nHugh Eley\nFebruary 23, 2011\n166\n1       A.   I think this document right here shows how \n2   it's constructed; the first document you handed me, \n3   Exhibit 4.\n4       Q.   You think Exhibit 4 explains how the ADL index \n5   is constructed?\n6            MS. BROWN:  Well, he said he's not familiar \n7   with either document.\n8            THE WITNESS:  But that's what it appears to \n9   do.\n10   BY MS. HAHN:  \n11       Q.   Are you aware of any other document within \n12   your department that shows how the ADL index is \n13   constructed?\n14       A.   As I said, it may be in the manual.  I don't \n15   know for sure if it is or not.\n16            MS. HAHN:  Was the manual supplied to us as \n17   part of discovery; do you know? \n18            MS. BROWN:  I don't know.\n19   BY MS. HAHN:  \n20       Q.   Well, if you have any other document that \n21   shows how the ADL index is constructed, would you \n22   supply that to us?\n23       A.   Sure.\n24            MS.

HAHN:  \n4       Q.   But looking at the MDS-HC and looking, for \n5   example, under eating, let me just take you to page 3 \n6   of Exhibit 1, the MDS-HC.\n7       A.   Okay.\n8       Q.   And looking at mobility in bed, it's defined \n9   as \"moving to and from a lying position, turning side \n10   to side, and positioning body while in bed\"; is that \n11   correct?\n12       A.   Yes.\n13       Q.   Okay.  Now just comparing that to the \n14   explanation which was on page 13 of Document 1949, it \n15   described bed mobility as \"going from a lying to a \n16   sitting position in bed.\"  \n17            Which definition is actually used in \n18   constructing the ADL index:  the one on the MDS-HC, \n19   Exhibit 1, or the one in this explanation, how \n20   Louisiana determines Long-Term Personal Care Service \n21   hours?\n22            MS. BROWN:  If you know the answer.\n23            THE WITNESS:  Ask me the question again.\n24   BY MS. HAHN:  \n25       Q.   Okay.  Which definition of mobility in bed is \nBaton Rouge Court Reporters, LLC\n225-292-8686\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 126 of 202\n\nHugh Eley\nFebruary 23, 2011\n168\n1   actually used in constructing a person's ADL index to \n2   determine how many hours of personal care service \n3   they're going to get?  Is it the definition on the \n4   MDS-HC which says \"moving to and from a lying position, \n5   turning side to side, and positioning body while in \n6   bed,\" or is it the shorter definition on 1949, page 13, \n7   which says \"going from a lying to a sitting position in \n8   bed\"?  \n9            Which one of these is the actual definition to \n10   use?\n11       A.   The one on the MDS-HC.\n12       Q.   The one on Exhibit 1?\n13       A.   Yes.\n14       Q.   And in terms of the -- if you'll look on the \n15   previous page on the MDS-HC, you look at what is meant \n16   by the different values that can be assigned from \n17   independence to activity did not occur, that's down in \n18   the lower right-hand corner of the page.  \n19       A.   Yes.\n20       Q.   So there are eight possible -- no, there are \n21   seven possible -- \n22            MS. BROWN:  Eight.\n23   BY MS.

Yes.\n2       Q.   And it shows on this guide, Exhibit 4, how \n3   many points you would get depending on what answer was \n4   given for mobility in bed; is that correct?\n5       A.   It appears to.\n6       Q.   And so what this guide appears to be saying -- \n7   first of all -- \n8            MS. BROWN:  He's already said he's not \n9   familiar with this.\n10            MS.

HAHN:  But I just kind of want to know -- \n4   let me just do this one, and then I won't go through \n5   the whole thing -- how's that -- and then could we \n6   stipulate if it works this way we can apply it to the \n7   rest of the things.  Okay?\n8            MS. BROWN:  Yes.\n9   BY MS. HAHN:  \n10       Q.   So just taking bed mobility, if you score a \n11   zero, 1 or a 2 in bed mobility, that would be \n12   independent, set-up help only, or supervision under ADL \n13   self-performance, Section H-2, right?  \n14       A.   I'm sorry.  Where are you?  \n15       Q.   That's okay.  I've been over it before.  All \n16   right.  You take MDS question H-2-A.  \n17       A.   Which is?  \n18       Q.   It's in Section H, physical function.  \n19       A.   ADL self-performance.  All right.\n20       Q.   And that's A, mobility in bed?\n21            MS. BROWN:  Next page.\n22            THE WITNESS:  Okay.  There's a lot of A's on \n23   here.  Okay.\n24   BY MS. HAHN:  \n25       Q.

Okay?\n2       A.   Okay.\n3       Q.   It's going to be a number from zero to 8.  \n4       A.   Okay.\n5       Q.   All right.  And if you score a zero, a 1 or a \n6   2, and those are all defined on the previous page -- \n7   independent, set-up help only, or supervision -- you'd \n8   get one point toward your ADL index, right?\n9       A.   H-2-A, zero, 1 or 2, you'd get one point.  \n10   That's what this document says, yes.\n11       Q.   And to get a 3, you would have to score a 3 in \n12   bed mobility, and that would be limited assistance, \n13   right?\n14       A.   Right.\n15       Q.   And then it defines limited assistance as \n16   \"received physical help in guided maneuvering of limbs \n17   or other non-weight bearing assistance 3 or more times \n18   or a combination of non-weight bearing help with more \n19   help provided only 1 or 2 times during the period, for \n20   a total of 3 or more episodes of physical help.\"  \n21            That's what limited assistance is defined as, \n22   right?\n23       A.   That's what it says, yes. \n24       Q.   Okay.

That's what it says.\n4       Q.   That's what it says.  And it would be during \n5   the last three days? \n6       A.   Yes, that's what -- well, I believe that's \n7   correct.\n8       Q.   I guess 8 would be you haven't moved in bed in \n9   three days.  So that's how that would work, right, if \n10   this is a correct document?\n11       A.   Yes.\n12       Q.   Does the state have to report to the CMS on \n13   some documents called 372 and 64, some forms?\n14       A.   Yes.\n15       Q.   And these forms will list the number of \n16   participants and the Medicaid expenditures in various \n17   programs?\n18       A.   Yes.\n19       Q.   You have an attachment to your declaration, \n20   Attachment F.  You testified about it in Paragraph 43 \n21   of your declaration.  Attachment F is talking about 15 \n22   states that have been reported in the -- let me just \n23   look at it again.\n24            You talk about 15 states that provide less \n25   than 32 hours a week of personal care assistance?\nBaton Rouge Court Reporters, LLC\n225-292-8686\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 131 of 202\n\nHugh Eley\nFebruary 23, 2011\n196\n1   BY MS. HAHN:  \n2       Q.   Maybe I better go back.  Tell me how this came \n3   about if you can starting when you learned you were \n4   going to make -- that you were going to need to make a \n5   cut in the LT-PCS Program.\n6       A.   There was a 61 million dollar line item \n7   reduction in LT-PCS.\n8       Q.   Specifically in that program?\n9       A.   Specifically in that program.\n10       Q.   And who suggested that line item cut?\n11       A.   I have no idea.\n12       Q.   Did you suggest it?\n13       A.   No, absolutely not.\n14       Q.   If it had been your decision to make, would \n15   you have suggested it?\n16       A.   Well, let me answer your question this way.  \n17   When we submitted our budget documents in 2000 in the \n18   budget preparation we actually submitted to add money \n19   to LT-PCS, and if you look at the actual budget \n20   documents there is some money added to account for \n21   projected utilization, you know, increase, but then \n22   that's added and then the 61 million dollars is taken \n23   away.\n24       Q.   When you start preparing the budget for the \n25   next fiscal year, is each department head asked to \nBaton Rouge Court Reporters, LLC\n225-292-8686\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 132 of 202\n\nHugh Eley\nFebruary 23, 2011\n197\n1   submit a proposed budget or how does that work?\n2       A.   Yes, each department, each office, submits a \n3   proposed budget.  Medicaid submits a proposed budget.\n4       Q.   When you submit the budget for your office, do \n5   you include things like LT-PCS and the waiver programs?\n6       A.   Those funds are not in the OAAS budget.  \n7   They're in the Medicaid budget.  But we're involved in \n8   preparing those sections of the Medicaid budget that \n9   cover those programs that we manage.\n10       Q.   And when you put in your budget, you put in \n11   for an increase in the LT-PCS Program for fiscal 2011?\n12       A.   A utilization increase, yes.\n13       Q.   And a utilization increase means more people \n14   are using the service so you need more money; is that \n15   right?\n16       A.   Correct.\n17       Q.   How did you learn that there was a line item \n18   cut to the LT-PCS Program?\n19       A.   I'm honestly not sure.  I was either told by \n20   someone or I saw it when the budget documents came out, \n21   but I really don't remember.\n22       Q.   We got a couple of e-mails in the documents \n23   that we got recently.  Let me see if I can find them.  \n24   I want you to look at Document 3142, please.  \n25       A.   Okay.\nBaton Rouge Court Reporters, LLC\n225-292-8686\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 133 of 202\n\nHugh Eley\nFebruary 23, 2011\n198\n1       Q.   If you look at these, it's an e-mail chain, \n2   and to look at them you've got to start at the bottom.  \n3       A.   Yeah.\n4       Q.   Was this the e-mail in which you learned about \n5   the proposed sixty -- well, in this one it says a 62 \n6   million cut or a 61 million cut.  \n7       A.   This is dated February -- the first e-mail is \n8   dated February 19th.  This is probably not the first \n9   information I had, but I don't know what exact date the \n10   executive budget was released that year.  But I would \n11   certainly have known about it by then.\n12       Q.   When do you usually learn?\n13       A.   I don't think there is a usually.  We have \n14   budget meetings and we talk about what's in or what's \n15   not in the budget, but there's nothing official until \n16   the Governor releases the executive budget.\n17       Q.   When does that happen?\n18       A.   Forty-five days before the start of the \n19   legislative session.  So this year it's March 11th.  \n20   Last year the session started earlier, so it would have \n21   been sometime in February.\n22       Q.   This set of e-mails, you've got an e-mail from \n23   Randy Davidson.  Who is Randy Davidson?\n24       A.   He is a Medicaid waiver assistant in the \n25   compliance unit in Medicaid.\nBaton Rouge Court Reporters, LLC\n225-292-8686\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 134 of 202\n\nHugh Eley\nFebruary 23, 2011\n199\n1       Q.   And he sent you an e-mail on February 19th \n2   saying, \"Jerry asked me to do a one-pager about a 62 \n3   million decrease for LT-PCS in next year's budget.  Is \n4   this number familiar to you?\"  And Jerry, who is the \n5   Jerry that he refers to?\n6       A.   Jerry Phillips.  \n7       Q.   And who is Jerry Phillips?  \n8       A.   He was at that time I believe still the \n9   Medicaid director.  He's currently the Under Secretary \n10   of DHH.\n11       Q.   And your reply to the question was that you \n12   were not familiar with the number 62 million.  You \n13   said, \"The best I can piece together, this number \n14   was -- it should be agreed to -- in meetings between \n15   the 9th floor and the Division or Governor's Office.\"  \n16            What did you mean when you referred to the \n17   ninth floor?\n18       A.   The Secretary's office.\n19       Q.   The Secretary of DHH?\n20       A.   Yes.\n21       Q.   And what is the Division?\n22       A.   The Division of Administration.\n23       Q.   And what does the Division of Administration \n24   have to do with it?\n25       A.   Well, the Division of Administration is the \nBaton Rouge Court Reporters, LLC\n225-292-8686\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 135 of 202\n\nHugh Eley\nFebruary 23, 2011\n200\n1   ones who make the budget.\n2       Q.   They draw up the budget of all the agencies?\n3       A.   They take what the agencies have submitted to \n4   them as a budget request, they determine what the size \n5   of the pie is, and then they divvy up the pie amongst \n6   all those agencies and either give you more or less \n7   than what you ask for.  Usually less.\n8       Q.   And then they -- and of course the Governor's \n9   Office.  So you say it was somewhere between the \n10   Secretary of DHH, the Division of Administration, and \n11   the Governor were the ones that told you to make the 62 \n12   million dollar cut in the LT-PCS Program?\n13       A.   It came out in the executive budget.  So it's \n14   part of that process that goes on within the Division \n15   of Administration.  That's where that got put in.\n16       Q.   And it wasn't cut 62 million dollars from the \n17   Medicaid budget or the Long-Term Care budget; it was \n18   cut 62 million dollars from the LT-PCS Program?\n19       A.   That's correct.\n20       Q.   And you really didn't have an option of \n21   cutting it somewhere else?\n22       A.   No, although at the end of the day we didn't \n23   cut at 61 million dollars.\n24       Q.   Well, you didn't feel like you could cut at 61 \n25   million dollars, did you?\nBaton Rouge Court Reporters, LLC\n225-292-8686\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 136 of 202\n\nExhibit  30 Doc. 1949\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 137 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 138 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 139 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 140 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 141 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 142 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 143 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 144 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 145 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 146 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 147 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 148 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 149 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 150 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 151 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 152 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 153 of 202\n\nExhibit  31 MDS-HC (Eley deposition Exh. 1)\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 154 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 155 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 156 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 157 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 158 of 202\n\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 159 of 202\n\nExhibit 31 Eley Deposition Exhibit 4-scoring sheet\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 160 of 202\n\nInterRAI scales \nADL index: points are assigned for each task as described below and then summed.

I am affiliated with St. Francis Medical Center in Monroe, Louisiana. \n3.  I have been treating Mary Dunn for approximately twenty-four years.   \n4.  Ms. Dunn has a history of cardiovascular disease and has had a stroke.  She has \narthritis and lower lumbar disk disease, which combined with a back surgery she \nhad many years ago, causes her to have chronic back pain. \n5.  Ms. Dunn also has osteoporosis.  After a recent fall, which I understand was the \nresult of her attempting to transfer to her bedside commode unattended, she has a \nfracture in her hip.  However, due to other cardiovascular complications, surgery \nis not recommended at this time. \n6.  Ms. Dunn uses a wheelchair and needs complete assistance with moving from one \nsurface to another, toileting, bathing, grooming, and dressing.  In addition, due to \nthe severity of her pain and her lack of movement someone else must prepare her \nmeals, do her shopping, and take care of her laundry and other household chores. \n7.  It is my understanding that the maximum number of hours offered by the Long-\nterm Personal Care Services program is thirty-two hours per week, and Ms. Dunn \nis receiving only thirty hours per week of assistance.  I believe that it is medically \nnecessary for Ms. Dunn to receive more than thirty-two hours per week to live \nsafely in her home. \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 170 of 202\n\n8.  I believe that if Ms. Dunn had adequate assistance and had not had her service \nhours reduced, it is possible that she would have had adequate assistance to \ntransfer to her commode and she would not have fallen. \n9.  It is my professional medical opinion that if Ms. Dunn’s hours are not increased \nher condition will deteriorate quickly and she will be forced to consider nursing \nhome services. \n10. I do not think Ms. Dunn wants to live in a nursing home, and I do not think that \nshe should have her independence taken from her when she has shown that with \nadequate assistance she can safely stay in her own home. \n \n/s/ Emile Barrow, Jr.            11/7/11     \nEmile Barrow, Jr., MD          Date \n \n \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 171 of 202\n\nExhibit 36  Fourth Declaration of Jeanne Abadie\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 172 of 202\n\nFOURTH DECLARATION OF JEANNE ABADIE \nJeanne Abadie subscribes under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, as \nfollows: \n1.  My name is Jeanne Abadie.  I work at the Advocacy Center and my title is \nCompliance Specialist. \n2.  I have reviewed some of the discovery documents provided to the Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel by the Defendants. \n3.  Defendants have provided, in response to discovery in this case, a spreadsheet \nlisting 366 LT-PCS recipients who were receiving over 32 hours of LT-PC on \nSeptember 5, 2010, and who had appealed an adverse action regarding their LT-\nPCS between that date and approximately September 30, 2011.  I have checked \nthis list against Advocacy Center intake records, and only 26 of the people on that \nlist have contacted the Advocacy Center.  Not all of these contacts appeared to \nrelate to the appeals. \n4.  The spreadsheet referred to in ¶3 above included the dates and dispositions of the \nindividuals’ appeals of reductions in LT-PCS between September 5, 2010 and \nSeptember 30, 2011.  I have performed calculations on these records, and offer \nthe following summary of my calculations:  300 appeals have been decided, and \nthe agency took an average of 68 days to decide them.  The maximum number of \ndays a decided appeal pended was 183.  Forty appeals had not been decided as of \nthe date of the spreadsheet, and they had pended an average of 57 days.  The \nlongest an open appeal had pended was 314 days. \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 173 of 202\n\n5.  Also in response to discovery in this case, Defendants provided a spreadsheet \nshowing the individuals who have requested emergency waiver slots under the \nprocess that was begun July 2011, and the status of those requests as of October \n11, 2011. I am attaching a copy of that spreadsheet, after removing the columns \nfor name and date of birth.  As of October 11, 2011, only three emergency waiver \noffers had been made.  Two were made within two weeks of their request dates, \nbut one (for V.U.S., a class member discussed in Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in \nSupport of their Motion for Preliminary Injunction) was made on September 7, \n2011, 43 days after it was requested.   \n6.  Two of the three emergency waiver slot offers shown on the spreadsheet were to \nindividuals for whom the Advocacy Center had requested the slot.  In neither of \ntheir cases were waiver services started within six weeks of the request. V.U.S.’s \nwaiver slot was requested on July 26, 2011.  Her services started on October 18, \n2011.  E.B. requested an emergency waiver slot on August 24, 2011.  His waiver \nservices started October 22, 2011. \n7.  Rickii Ainey was also referred for an emergency waiver by the Advocacy Center.  \nThe referral was made on July 26, 2011.  An offer for an emergency waiver slot \nwas made to Ms. Ainey on October 27, 2011, so it is not on the spreadsheet.  As \nof November 14, 2011, her Waiver services have not started. \n \n/s/Jeanne Abadie          11/14/11     \nName              Date \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 174 of 202\n\nIs the \nperson \napproved  Date RO  Date R.O. \nfor the  Called to  sent to  Decision of  Date  Date of \nmaximum  If Yes to E  Schedule  Service  Service  Response  Service \nDate of  Region of  number of  and F, Date  Home  Date of  Review  Review  Letter  Review \nRequest Residence LTPCS  weekly  sent to R.O.

My name is Mark Operario. I am a physician practicing Internal Medicine and \nFamily Medicine in Columbia, Louisiana.  I received by medical degree in 1985 from \nthe Cebu Doctors College of Medicine Philippines. I have been in practice in \nColumbia since 1995.  I am Board Certified in Internal Medicine. \n2.  I have been treating Eddie M. Shaw for approximately three years.  Ms. Shaw is \n70 years old and has a history of arthritis and diabetes.  \n3.  Her overall medical condition is not expected to improve. Ms. Shaw seems to be \ngetting weaker, and due to her inactivity it is unlikely that she will lose weight, which \nalso contributes to her lack of mobility. \n4.  Ms. Shaw has difficulty performing self-care tasks due to her arthritis and her \nweight. Her hands are significantly affected, so she cannot grip items, such as a knife, \nfork, hairbrush or soap, which means she needs assistance eating, bathing and \nperforming all hygiene tasks. \n5.  Ms. Shaw requires assistance with transferring and toileting.  She must put her \nweight on someone or something to go from a seating position to a standing position \nand vice versa.  She cannot walk without holding on to something.  When visiting my \noffice, she uses a wheelchair.  \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 187 of 202\n\n6.  It is my opinion that she cannot safely prepare her own meals or perform \nhousehold chores, such as housekeeping and laundry. \n7.  Ms. Shaw has bladder incontinence episodes daily, and should be cleaned \nthoroughly after each episode to prevent skin breakdowns.   \n8.  I have been monitoring Ms. Shaw’s condition closely, and have been seeing her \napproximately once every three to four months. \n9.  To my knowledge, Eddie Shaw is currently receiving 38 hours per week of \npersonal care services at home for her activities of daily living and light housekeeping \ntasks.  The 38 hours a week of personal care service that Ms. Shaw receives in her \nhome are medically necessary for her to continue to live in her home and the \nminimum amount of help that she requires to remain healthy and stable in the \ncommunity.  \n10.  If Ms. Shaw’s service hours were reduced, I would expect her health to \ndeteriorate, which would lead to institutionalization in a nursing facility. In my \nopinion, reducing her current in-home personal care services would jeopardize her \nhealth, safety and welfare. \n11.  Ms. Shaw can live in her home with the appropriate number of hours, and should \nbe given the opportunity to do so.  It is my opinion, that she can be better cared while \nliving in her own home than if she were living in a nursing home. \n \n9-29-11            /s/ Mark Operario, M.D.   \nDate              Mark Operario, MD \n \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 188 of 202\n\nExhibit 41 36 La Reg 2217-20\nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 85     11/15/11   Page 189 of 202\n\nC.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \nHELEN PITTS, ET AL \nCIVIL ACTION \nVERSUS \nNO.10-635-JJB-SR \nBRUCE GREENSTEIN, IN HIS OFFICIAL \nCAPACITY AS SECRETARY OF THE \nLOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH \nAND HOSPITALS, ET AL \nRULING ON DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nThis  matter  is  before  the  Court  on  Defendants'  Motion  (doc.  11)  for \nSummary  Judgment.  Plaintiffs  have  filed  an  opposition  (doc.  36)  to  which \nDefendants have filed a reply (doc. 39).  On April 20, 2011, this Court heard oral \narguments from the parties.  This Court's jurisdiction exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§  1331.  For the  reasons  stated  herein the Court DENIES  Defendants'  motion \n(doc. 11). \nBackground \nI.  Facts \nThe following facts are undisputed.  Since 2003, the state of Louisiana, as \npart  of  its  Medicaid  plan,  has  offered  home-and-community-based  services \n(\"HCBS\")  to  disabled  individuals  through  its  long-term  personal  care  services \n(\"LT-PCS\") program (doc. 36, ex.  1,  pp.  10-11).  The LT-PCS program provides \ndisabled  individuals  with  a  personal  care  worker  to  assist  the  individual  in \nperforming  basic  tasks,  such  as  personal  care  or  household  chores,  that  the \n1 \n\nindividual  would  otherwise  be  unable  to  perform  (doc.  36,  ex.  1,  pp.  5-8).1 \nThose  who  do  not  qualify for  LT  -PCS,  or  seek  additional  or alternative \nservices, may enter one of the State's waiver programs,2 however, each program \nsuffers from  limited  slots,  geographical  or age  limits,  and/or waiting  lists.  For \nthose programs that have waiting lists, an individual may be moved to the top of \nthe priority list and immediately offered a waiver, but to do so, the individual must \nhave had a hospital stay in excess of 30 days or been treated in a nursing facility \nfor 120 consecutive days (doc. 39-2, ~ 13). \nIn March 2009, in order to address budgetary concerns, the State lowered \nthe maximum weekly LT   -PCS service hours that an individual could receive from \n1 To qualify for LT -PCS,  an  individual must be so physically disabled that he or she would qualify to \nreceive care in a nursing facility and must demonstrate that he or she \"faces a substantial possibility of \ndeterioration in mental or physical condition or functioning if either home or community-based services \nare not provided  in  less than  120 days.\"  34  LAC  50 XV §  12905,  Louisiana  Register,  v.  30  no.  12 \nDecember 2004, p. 2831. \nPlaintiffs Helen  Pitts,  Kenneth  Roman,  Denise Hodges,  Rickii Ainey and  Cleo Lancaster each \nreceive an average of 39 hours per week of care through LT-PCS (doc. 36, ex. 3, 1l22; ex. 4, 1l20; ex. 5, \n1l16; ex. 6, 1l28).  Each Plaintiff's primary physician has stated that if his or her hours of in-home care are \nreduced to 32 hours per week, each will suffer a deterioration in condition and will be forced to enter a \nnursing home for care (doc. 36, ex. 8, 1l1l9, 11-15; ex. 9, 1l1l11, 13; ex. 10; ex. 11, 1l1l8-12; ex 121l1l17-\n18). \n2 Louisiana maintains the following waiver services: \nElderly and Disabled Adults (\"EDA\"): The EDA program, which an individual may not participate \nin simultaneously with LT -PCS, provides an annual budget which is typically substantial enough \nto pay for 65 hours of in-home care (doc. 36, ex. 1, pp. 73-74).  However, an individual must wait \napproximately 30  months before receiving the applied-for care (Id.  p.  52).  As of October 10, \n2010, 46% of the 12,021 people who received LT-PCS were also on the EDA waiting list (Id.  p. \n69).  Moreover, in 2009 the State capped the program at 4,603 slots (Id. p. 41). \nAdult Day Health Care (\"ADHC\"): The ADHC program provides essential services in an adult day \ncare center.  All ADHC licensed facilities must operate for a minimum of five hours per day and \nmust provide transportation to and from the facility (doc. 11-2, 1l 22).  However, it has only 825 \nslots, a waiting list over five months long and is not available in many parts of the state. \nProgram of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (\"PACE\"): The PACE program has only 400 slots \nand is only available to individuals 55 and older and only in certain parts of Baton Rouge and \nNew Orleans (Id. p. 43-44). \nMoney  Follows  the  Person  (\"MFP\"):  The  MFP  program  offers  assistance  to  individuals \ntransitioning from nursing facilities, but does not provide services to individuals seeking to avoid \nentering a nursing facility (Id. at 89-91). \n2 \n\n56  to 42  (doc.  36,  ex.  1,  pp.  11,  66-67).  In  September 2010,  the  State again \nlowered  the  maximum  weekly service  hours,  from  42  to  32,  and  changed  the \nassessment criteria (doc. 36, ex.  1, pp.  11, 66-67).3  These provisions apply not \nonly to  new LT  -PCS  recipients but to  individuals currently receiving  assistance \nwhen they undergo their annual eligibility assessments. \nThe  Louisiana  Department  of  Health  and  Hospitals  (\"LADHH\")  has \ndetermined this change will save the state $5 million in 2011  and $24 million in \n2012 (doc. 36, ex.  1, p.  206).  However, Plaintiffs suggest that the average cost \nof services  for  an  individual  in  the  LT  -PCS  program  is  less  than  the  cost  of \nmaintaining the same individual in a nursing home (doc. 36, Pitts_0001 041, p. 2). \nPlaintiffs also suggest that the cost of servicing individuals in nursing homes has \nsteadily increased in recent years (doc. 36, Pitts_000044, Pitts_0001188). \nII. Procedu ral History \nOn  September 22,  2010,  Plaintiffs filed  suit against the  LADHH  and  its \nSecretary,  Bruce Greenstein,  seeking  declaratory and  injunctive relief (doc.  1). \nPlaintiffs  assert  that  the  reduction  in  LT   -PCS  hours  unlawfully  discriminates \nagainst disabled individuals by depriving them of at-home assistance necessary \n3 As of March 1, 2009, the State determined the level of an individual's disability by the individual's ability \nto  perform (1) seven different \"activities of daily living\" (ADLs):  bed  mobility,  transferring,  locomotion, \ndressing, eating, toileting, personal hygiene and bathing; (2) eight different \"instrumental activities of daily \nliving\"  (IADLs):  meal  preparation,  housework,  managing  finances  or  medication,  using  the  phone, \nshopping and transportation.  In August 2010, the State changed its method of determining the level of an \nindividual's disability to require the individual,  in  order to  receive the maximum amount of assistance, \nneed assistance in four ADLs: eating, bathing, transferring, and moving in bed (doc. 36, ex. 1, 164-172). \nNationally, an individual needing assistance in three ADLs receives an average of 59.6 hours per \nweek of personal assistance in order to remain in the community; an individual needing assistance in four \nADLs receives 85.9 (doc. 36). \n3 \n\nto  remain  \"integrated\"  into  the  community  in  violation  of  the  Title  II  of  the \nAmerican's with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (2010), and Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Section 504\"), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (2010). \nOn  October 21,  2010,  Defendants filed  their Motion  (doc.  11) to  Dismiss \nPlaintiffs'  claims,  which  the  Court  later  converted  (doc.  25)  into  a  Motion  for \nSummary Judgment.  Defendants assert that they have not discriminated against \nPlaintiffs under the ADA or Section 504 because they have a comprehensive and \neffective plan  in  place to  provide disabled  individuals with  HCBS.  Defendants \nalso assert that even if they have discriminated against Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' ADA \nand Section 504 claims must fail  because they have failed to meet their burden \nof providing a reasonable modification to the proposed plan (doc. 11). \nOn November 10, 2010, Plaintiffs filed their opposition (doc. 17).  Plaintiffs \nassert that Defendants (1) have discriminated against them under the ADA and \nSection 504 by increasing the likelihood that they will be institutionalized; (2) they \nhave proposed a reasonable modification in suggesting the state maintain its 42-\nhour  maximum;  and  (3)  Defendants  have  additionally  discriminated  against \nPlaintiffs by basing the level of care they receive on the severity of their disability \n(doc. 17). \nStandard of Review \nUnder  Federal  Rule  of Civil  Procedure  12(b)(6)  a  federal  district  court \nshould dismiss a plaintiff's complaint if it \"fails to state a claim upon which relief \ncan  be  granted.\"  However,  [i]f,  on  a motion  under Rule  12(b)(6) ... , matters \n4 \n\noutside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion \nmust be treated as one for summary judgment.\"  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(d).  A court \nmay grant a motion for summary judgment if the evidence establishes that there \nis no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56.  If the  movant carries  its  burden,  the  non \nmovant must then demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact \nin  order to  survive the  motion for summary judgment.  Matsushita  Elec.  Indus. \nCo., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986). \nDiscussion \nDefendants  assert that  they  have  not  discriminated  under  the  ADA  or \nSection  504  by  reducing  the  weekly maximum  of LT  -PCS  service  hours  (doc. \n11).  Defendants assert that the combination  of LT  -PCS  and  waiver programs \nensure that disabled individuals are not forced into nursing facilities.  Defendants \nassert  that  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  show  that  returning  to  a  42-hour  weekly \nmaximum is a reasonable modification to the current plan. \nPlaintiffs  assert  that  the  State's  plan  increases  their  risk  of \ninstitutionalization because the State's waiver programs are either unavailable in \nmany parts of the state or have lengthy waiting periods.  Plaintiffs also assert that \nreturning to a 42-hour weekly maximum is a reasonable modification because the \nState  will  end  up  spending  more  money  if  LT   -PCS  recipients  are  forced  to \nreceive care in nursing facilities as a result of the reduction.  Therefore, Plaintiffs \nassert,  Defendants now bear the burden of establishing that returning to the 42-\n5 \n\nhour  weekly  maximum  would  constitute  an  undue  burden  or  a  fundamental \nalteration of its program. \nThe ADA prohibits state agencies from  discriminating  against individuals \nwith disabilities in the provision of public services.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 (A)-(8) & \n12132.  In  drafting  the  ADA,  Congress  stated  that  \"historically,  society  has \ntended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities\" and that \"individuals \nwith  disabilities continually encounter various forms  of discrimination,  including \noutright  intentional  exclusion,  ...  failure  to  make  modifications  to  existing \nfacilities and practices ... [and] segregation.\"  42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 (a)(2), (5).  To \neffectuate the  goal  of  integrating  disabled  individuals  into  their  communities, \npublic  entities  are  required  to  \"administer services  . . . in  the  most integrated \nsetting  appropriate to the  needs of qualified individuals with  disabilities\" and  to \nmake  \"reasonable  modifications\"  in  furtherance  of  that  goal.  28  CFR  § \n35.130(b)(7), (d) (1998). \nThe  party  challenging  a  State's  program  bears  the  initial  burden  of \ndemonstrating that the program violates the ADA's integration mandate and that \nthe  requested  relief  would  be  a  reasonable  modification.  Henrietta  D.  v. \nBloomberg,  331  F.3d 261,  280  (2d  Cir.  2003).  A State's program  violates the \nADA's integration  mandate if it creates the  risk of segregation;  neither present \nnor  inevitable  segregation  is  required.4  In  determining  whether  a  proposed \n4 For example, in Fisher v.  Oklahoma, 335 F.3d 1175 (10th Cir. 2003), Oklahoma adopted a policy under \nwhich  it  provided  unlimited  prescription  medicine  to  individuals  in  institutions,  but  not to  individuals \nreceiving community-based services.  Fisher,  335 F.3d at 1181.  The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals \n6 \n\nmodification is  reasonable,  courts consider the resources available to the State \nand  the  State's  responsibility  to  equitably  apportion  those  resources  to  all \ndisabled individuals.  Olmstead v.  L.e.  ex reI Zimring,  527  U.S.  581,  597,  604, \n607 (1999).  That is,  courts must consider the cost-effectiveness of community-\nbased  services  globally  and  not  solely  in  relation  to  the  particular  litigants. \nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 604 (stating that although community-based services may \nbe cheaper than institutional services when judged on a purely individual basis, a \n\"[s]tate .. ,  may experience increased overall expenses by funding  community \nplacements without being able to take advantage of the savings associated with \nclosure  of  institutions\").  As  such,  a  State  must  be  given  some  leeway  in \ncomplying with the ADA and can satisfy its obligations by \"demonstrat[ing] that it \n[has] a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with \n[]  disabilities  in  less  restrictive  settings,  and  a  waiting  list  that  move[s]  at  a \nreasonable pace.\"  Id. at 605-06. \nThe Court finds that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment should be \ndenied.  Plaintiffs require, on average, 39 hours of HCSS per week (doc. 36, ex. \n3, ~ 22; ex. 4, ~ 20; ex. 5, ~16; ex. 6, ~ 28).  Therefore,  Louisiana's current plan \nwould require  Plaintiffs to receive, on  average, 7 hours of additional assistance \nper week.  Though the State has waiver programs through which Plaintiffs can \nfound that this violated Title\" because the plaintiffs' health might deteriorate, leading to increased need \nfor prescription medication and, therefore, an increased risk of institutionalization.  Id; see also Brantley v. \nMaxwell-Jolly, 656 F. Supp. 2d 1161, 1170 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (stating that the risk of institutionalization is \nsufficient for a violation of the ADA); M.A. C.  v. Be tit, 284 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1309 (D. Utah 2003) (same); \nMakin v. Hawaii, 144 F. Supp. 2d 1017,1034 (D. Haw. 1999) (same). \n7 \n\nreceive  the  necessary  supplemental  assistance,  each  of  the  programs  has \nlimited slots,  geographical or age limits,  and/or waiting lists of up to two-and-a \nhalf years.  See supra note 2.  Defendants assert that Plaintiffs can be moved to \nthe  top  of the  priority list by  submitting  to  a 120-day stay in  a nursing  facility, \nhowever,  this  would  subject  Plaintiffs  to  the  very  institutionalization  which  the \nADA seeks to avoid.  Therefore, the State's current plan plainly violates the ADA \nby creating a greater risk for institutionalization for those individuals who require \nmore than 32 hours per week of assistance.  See Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1181. \nIn  addition,  there  are  genuine  issues  of  material  fact  as  to  whether \nmaintaining  the  42-hour weekly  maximum  is  a \"reasonable  modification\"  or  a \n\"fundamental  alteration\" for purposes of Plaintiffs' ADA claim.  Plaintiffs assert \nthat the  proposed plan will  save the state $5  million in  2011  and $24  million in \n2012  (doc.  36,  ex.  1,  p.  206).  However,  Defendants  assert  that  the  cost  of \nservicing  individuals  in  nursing  homes  has  steadily  increased  in  recent  years \n(doc. 36,  Pitts_000044, Pitts_0001188), and that the average cost of serving an \nindividual in the LT  -PCS program is less than the cost of maintaining the same \nindividual in a nursing facility (doc. 36, Pitts_0001 041, p. 2).  Therefore, the Court \nfinds that summary judgment is not appropriate. \n8 \n\nConclusion \nAccordingly,  the Court hereby DENIES  Defendants'  Motion  (doc.  11) for \nSummary Judgment.  , \nbt ~lay  ..!...ih----1H--I--, \nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana this /  of  2011. \nJUDGEJA, E  .

INTRODUCTION \nIn  August  2010,  the  Louisiana  Department  of  Health  and  Hospitals  (“DHH”) \npromulgated a rule changing the way in which personal care services are allocated to Medicaid-\neligible individuals in the State’s Long-Term Personal Care Services (“LT-PCS”) program. The \nchange included a reduction in the maximum number of hours that the State would provide from \n42 hours per week to 32 hours per week. Shortly thereafter, four individuals filed this lawsuit, \nalleging that the State’s reduction of the cap from 42 hours per week would force them and \nthousands of others into nursing homes, thereby violating the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(ADA). Last May, the Court ruled that there was a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether \nthe ADA required the State to make any changes to the LT-PCS program. \nThe timing and basis of the Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction is inexplicable \nand unjustified. The Plaintiffs do not seek to maintain the status quo, but to change it. More than \na year has passed since the beginning of the litigation. Contrary to the Plaintiffs’ predictions in \ntheir  complaint,  the  number  of  LT-PCS  recipients  transitioning  to  nursing  homes  has  not \nincreased—has, in fact, decreased—even though the State has now reduced services for nearly \nall of the beneficiaries, including thousands who were receiving more than 32 hours a year ago. \nMoreover, in response to the Court’s summary judgment ruling and questions at oral argument, \nthe State promptly undertook several modifications to its home- and community-based services \n(“HCBS”) programs to accommodate individuals who believe they will need to move to a \nnursing home without more than 32 hours of paid assistance. The Plaintiffs acknowledge that \nthese steps have been positive. And when class counsel has informed Defendants that specific \nindividuals require additional assistance—including every individual referenced in the Plaintiffs’ \nmotion—Defendants have provided informal relief through individualized accommodations. \n- 1 - \n \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 7 of 38\n\nGiven that Defendants’ have made and may continue to make changes to their programs, \ntheir demonstrated willingness to accommodate individuals brought to their attention by class \ncounsel, and the lack of evidence suggesting the 32-hour cap has led to an increase in nursing \nfacility admissions, there is no need for judicial intervention prior to a decision on the merits. \nAccordingly, the Court should deny the motion.  \nII.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS \nDefendants’  previous  filings  have  described  the  full  array  of  Louisiana’s  HCBS \nprograms,  the  substantial  and  growing  financial  commitment  the  State  has  made  to  those \nprograms, DHH’s past success in serving more individuals in the community every year, and its \nongoing efforts to reduce the nursing home population.1 Following the Court’s May order, DHH \nhas made a number of modifications to these programs. \nA.  Replacement Of The EDA Waiver With The CC Waiver \nLouisiana recently replaced the Elderly & Disabled Adult (“EDA”) waiver with the more \ncomprehensive Community Choices (“CC”) waiver. As previously explained, each beneficiary \nenrolled in the waiver receives an acuity-based “budget” of up to $40,046 per year, which he or \nshe  may  allocate  to  an  appropriate  mix  of  services.  Defs.’  Statement  of  Undisputed  Facts \n(“SUF”), Doc. 11-1, at ¶¶ 54-55. In the EDA waiver, the beneficiary could use the budget to \narrange for not only personal assistance services (which include both the personal care services \nat issue in this case and companion care services, id. ¶ 58), but also support coordination, \ntransition  intensive  support  coordination,  environmental  accessibility  adaptation,  transition \nservices, and Adult Day Health Care services. Id. ¶ 57. Since the CC waiver replaced the EDA \n                                                 \n1 See generally Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Doc. 11-1, at 3-14; First Declaration of \nHugh R. Eley, Doc. 11-2, at ¶¶ 7-43; Defendants’ Reply to Plaintiffs’ Opposition to the Motion for Summary \nJudgment, Doc. 39, at 3-11. \n- 2 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 8 of 38\n\nprogram on October 1, 2011, beneficiaries have the additional options of physical therapy, \noccupational  therapy,  respiratory  therapy,  speech/language  therapy,  nursing  services,  home \ndelivered meals, assistive devices and medical supplies, respite services (temporary support for \ninformal caregivers), and non-medical transportation. Exhibit 1, Third Declaration of Hugh R. \nEley ¶ 18. Because the CC waiver offers these additional services and allows beneficiaries to \nreceive more personal care services than LT-PCS, the CC waiver will generally be the more \nattractive option for individuals with the most severe disabilities.2  \nB.  Creation Of A Process For Granting Expedited Waiver Slots \nThere are a limited number of CC waiver slots. Id. ¶ 22. The program is always near \ncapacity, but turnover allows DHH to extend offers to individuals on the waiting list on a rolling \nbasis. Offers are made in the order that individuals applied for the program, unless an individual \nfalls within one of the designated “priority” groups. Id. ¶¶ 23-26. In June 2011, DHH issued an \nemergency rule that created a process through which people who are receiving the maximum \nnumber of hours of LT-PCS (32 hours per week) can enroll in the waiver without delay if, but \nfor the provision of additional services through the waiver, they would require admission to a \nnursing  home.  Id.  ¶¶ 28-43.3  Under  the  rule,  waiver  slots  are  made  available  to  qualified \napplicants  on a n  expedited  basis  “[n]otwithstanding  the  priority  group  provisions”  for  the \nwaiver’s waiting list. Id. Att. B. This means that recipients of expedited waiver offers get access \nto CC services ahead of other individuals on the waiting list. See id. ¶¶ 28, 54. \n                                                 \n2 In addition to expanding the array of services available through the waiver, DHH is requesting the addition of 500 \nnew slots for the upcoming fiscal year. Third Eley Decl. ¶ 49-51. The final decision to fund the expansion will be \nmade by the Governor’s Division of Administration and the legislature. \n3 The rule is codified at La. Admin. Code tit. 50, § 8105(E). It was initially published at 37 La. Reg. 1490, 1491 \n(June 2011), and then republished without amendment at 37 La. Reg. 2558, 2559 (Sept. 2011). The latter version \nappears as Attachment B to the Third Declaration of Hugh R. Eley. \n- 3 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 9 of 38\n\nRequests for an expedited waiver offer are made by phone or by referral to DHH staff. \nSee id. ¶ 31. If the applicant meets the threshold criterion of having exhausted the available LT-\nPCS  resources,  a  Medical  Certification  Specialist  from  one  of  DHH’s  Regional  Offices \nschedules a “home visit” to evaluate whether the applicant will enter a nursing home without \nwaiver services, whether alternative support is available from other formal or informal sources, \nand whether CC waiver services are appropriate for the individual under the circumstances. See \nid. ¶¶ 31-33. The Medical Certification Specialist’s findings are examined by the Service Review \nPanel (“SRP”), which decides whether to offer the applicant an expedited slot. Id. ¶ 34-35. DHH \nis  currently  able  to  act  on  a  request  within  two  weeks  of  receiving  it.  Id.  ¶¶ 30,  59,  63. \nIndividuals who are denied an expedited waiver offer can reapply if their circumstances change. \nId. ¶ 37. \nDHH has reserved 100 slots for these emergency placements. Id. ¶ 41. To date, it has \nreceived over 30 applications, and has extended offers to several people. Id. ¶¶ 38-40, 75-77.4 \nC.  Elimination Of The 90-Day Stay Rule For High Priority Offers To Nursing \nHome Residents \nIn addition to the emergency slots reserved for individuals who have “maxed out” their \nLT-PCS services, DHH has revised the criteria for its “priority groups” for regular CC waiver \nslot offers. Individuals in the priority groups quickly receive waiver offers despite the waiting \nlist. When the parties were before the Court in May, the priority groups were: (1) victims of \nabuse and neglect who would require institutionalization to prevent future abuse and neglect in \nthe absence of access to the waiver; (2) individuals with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS); \n                                                 \n4 At least three other individuals who requested expedited waiver offers received offers through the regular process \nfor offering slots. Third Eley Decl. ¶ 72. Two individuals were referred to the Office of Citizens with Developmental \nDisabilities for services through that office’s waiver programs. Id. ¶ 40. Several requests came from people who \nwere not enrolled in LT-PCS at all or were not approved for 32 hours. Id. ¶ 39. \n- 4 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 10 of 38\n\n(3) individuals residing in nursing facilities for at least 90 days. SUF ¶¶ 62, 74-78. DHH has now \nremoved the 90-day stay requirement for the third group. On June 20, 2011, the rules were \nmodified to allow any individual “approved for a stay of more than 90 days” to receive a high-\npriority CC waiver offer. Third Eley Decl. Att. B. As a result, DHH can now extend a waiver \noffer to an individual promptly upon his or her admission to a nursing home, without the person \nstaying there for 90 days. Id. ¶ 44-48. DHH determined that individuals who are not “approved \nfor a stay of more than 90 days” are typically admitted to address short-term needs such as \nrehabilitation after a hospital stay and do not require CC waiver services to leave the nursing \nfacility. Id. ¶ 45. \nD.  Over 1,500 LT-PCS Recipients Offered Slots In The EDA/CC Waiver \nAs Defendants have previously informed the Court, as part of the changes to the LT-PCS \nprogram, DHH eliminated the rule that put LT-PCS recipients at the bottom of the waiting list \nfor waiver services. SUF ¶¶ 68-71. Prior to implementation of the 32-hour cap, DHH placed a \nlower priority on providing waiver services to individuals who were already receiving some \npersonal care services than those who were receiving none. With the implementation of the cap, \nDHH recognized that LT-PCS recipients could benefit from the additional services available \nthrough the waiver, and it therefore moved them out of the “lowest priority” category. As a result \nof  the  new  policy,  about  1,500  LT-PCS  recipients  have  been  offered  slots  in  the  waiver, \nincluding over 600 who previously received more than 32 hours per week. Third Eley Decl. \n¶¶ 27, 74. Of those, two of the four original named plaintiffs—Helen Pitts and Denise Hodges—\nand over 300 other people who had been receiving over 32 hours of LT-PCS now receive CC \nwaiver services instead. Id. ¶¶ 73-74.  \n- 5 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 11 of 38\n\nE.  A Decrease In Nursing Facility Admissions \nOn  September  5, 2010,   DHH  began  applying  the  32-hour  cap  to  current  LT-PCS \nrecipients on a rolling basis after their next annual reassessment and to new recipients when they \nenrolled in the program. At the time, about 3,900 individuals were approved to receive more than \n32 hours of LT-PCS per week. Id. ¶ 5. As of October 1, 2011, about 2,500 of those individuals \nhad been reassessed for 32 hours or less; about 375 have not yet been reassessed; and about \n1,000 no longer receive LT-PCS. Id. ¶¶ 6-8. \nThe number of LT-PCS recipients transitioning into nursing homes has not increased \nsince DHH began applying the 32-hour cap. Id. ¶¶ 4-12. In fact, data for the first three quarters \nsince the 32-hour cap took effect show that transitions to nursing homes are lower than they were \nin the quarter before the cap took effect: \n  LT-PCS  Number  Percent  Number Reduced \nQuarter  Population at  Transitioning  Transitioning  from Above 32 by \nStart of Quarter  to NFs  to NFs  Start of Quarter \nJuly-Sept. 2010  12,124  347  2.86%  0 \nOct.-Dec. 2010  12,227  270  2.21%  19 \nJan.-Mar. 2011  12,668  280  2.21%  250 (approx.) \nApr.-June 2011  12,923  292  2.23%  785 (approx.) \nJuly-Sept. 2011  13,325  n/a  n/a  1,530 (approx.) \n \nThird Eley Decl. ¶¶ 9-11 & Att. A. Thus, while the size of the LT-PCS population has increased \nsubstantially since September 2010, id. ¶¶ 14-15, both the percentage and the absolute number of \ntransitions into nursing homes dropped. The State’s preliminary data for the third quarter of 2011 \nsuggest the downward trend in nursing home transitions will continue to hold steady. Id. ¶ 12. \nF.  Informal Accommodations \nFrom the time the lawsuit was filed, class counsel have brought about 20 individuals to \nthe attention of DHH who they allege need in excess of 32 hours of care. Id. ¶ 71. Defendants \n- 6 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 12 of 38\n\nhave voluntarily agreed to keep in place existing plans of care for each of these individuals \nunless  the  commencement  of  waiver  services  made  an  extension  unnecessary.  Id.  ¶ 70. \nDefendants have already agreed to extend or restore the previous level of LT-PCS for all of the \nindividuals mentioned in the Plaintiffs’ motion as well as for several individuals who are not, and \nDefendants are prepared within reasonable limits to make similar accommodations for other \nputative class members identified by the Plaintiffs.  Id.  \nIII.  ARGUMENT \nThe context surrounding the Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction makes their \nmotion highly unusual. The Plaintiffs did not see fit to move for preliminary relief until a year \ninto the litigation, four months after the Court’s summary judgment ruling, and after DHH had \napplied the challenged 32-hour cap to nearly everyone in the LT-PCS program. The Plaintiffs do \nnot contend that any recent action by DHH warrants the extraordinary relief they seek. To the \ncontrary,  after  oral  argument  in  April,  Defendants  began  taking  significant  steps  to  make \nadditional HCBS available to LT-PCS recipients. DHH created a process for granting expedited \naccess to CC waiver services for LT-PCS recipients who believe they need additional HCBS to \navoid institutionalization. And DHH revised its rules to eliminate the wait for CC waiver slots \nfor someone who does enter a nursing facility. The Plaintiffs concede that the amendment of the \nCC waiver rules “clearly represents a step in the right direction,” Pls.’ Mem. of Law in Support \nof Motion for a Prelim. Injunct. (Pls.’ Mem.), Doc. 73-2, at 7, and they acknowledge that \nDefendants have also accommodated individuals brought to their attention by class counsel. \nMeanwhile, the passage of time has revealed no increase in the number of LT-PCS recipients \ntransitioning to nursing facilities. The Plaintiffs’ request for extraordinary relief directing DHH \nto make further changes to its HCBS programs thus comes despite the events of the last year—\nnot because of them.  \n- 7 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 13 of 38\n\nThe Plaintiffs’ motion asks the Court to find that they have a substantial likelihood of \nprevailing on the merits, even though last spring the Court ruled that there was a genuine dispute \nof material fact as to whether the ADA required the State to make any changes to the LT-PCS \nprogram,  and  the  development  of  the  facts  to  date  does  not  support  the  allegations  and \npredictions in the Complaint. The requested relief is based entirely on speculative harm to \nunnamed and unidentified class members.  There is no basis or need for extraordinary judicial \naction  at  this  stage  of  the  litigation.  The  Court  should  deny  the  motion  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction and reserve judgment on the merits until the parties are able to fully develop the \nrecord and the Court can make a reasoned decision on all of the facts. \nA.  The Plaintiffs Do Not Have Standing To Seek Relief For Speculative Harm \nTo Unnamed Class Members.  \nThe class cannot properly seek the proposed changes to how DHH awards expedited CC \nwaiver slots because they have not shown that any of the named plaintiffs are harmed by the \nalleged deficiencies in DHH’s policies. The plaintiffs identify four groups of “class members” \nwho allegedly remain at risk of institutionalization: \n(1)  Individuals  who  request  expedited  waiver  services  after  the  100 s lots  currently \nallocated to expedited waiver offerees are filled; \n(2) Individuals who have been approved for fewer than 32 hours per week of LT-PCS;  \n(3) Individuals “who are not able to remain in the community without deterioration while \ntheir applications for emergency [CC] slots are pending”; and  \n(4) Individuals who will be denied an expedited CC waiver slot because their risk of \neventual institutionalization is not sufficiently immediate. \nId. at 9. The named plaintiffs cannot show that they are personally harmed by the rules governing \nexpedited CC waiver slots, nor have they attempted to. As a result, the Plaintiffs lack standing to \nseek relief on behalf of these four groups, and the Court may not properly grant the relief they \nrequest. \n- 8 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 14 of 38\n\nNamed plaintiffs “must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that \ninjury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and \nwhich they purport to represent.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 502 (1975); Simon v. E. Ky. \nWelfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 40 n.20  (1976) (quoting id.). And they “must demonstrate \nstanding separately for each form of relief sought.” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. \nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 185 (2000); DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, \n352 (2006) (quoting id.); see also Hodgers-Durgin v. De la Vin, 199 F.3d 1037, 1044-45 (9th \nCir. 1999) (en banc) (“Unless the named plaintiffs are themselves entitled to seek injunctive \nrelief, they may not represent a class seeking that relief.”); Johnson v. Rodriguez, 110 F.3d 299, \n304 n.8 (5th Cir. 1997) (“[A]s a general rule class injuries attributable to members of a class but \nnot sustained by a named class representative cannot be remedied in the class action lawsuit.”).  \nIn Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343 (1996), the Supreme Court applied this principle to hold \nthat injunctive relief must be tailored to redress the injuries of the named plaintiffs rather than the \ninjuries  of  unnamed  class  members.  In  that  case,  a  certified  class  of  all  adult  prisoners \nincarcerated by the Arizona Department of Corrections claimed that they had been denied their \nconstitutional right to access the courts. See id. at 346. The district court issued an injunction \nrequiring prison officials to make various changes to their policies regarding access to their law \nlibraries, including changes to ensure that lockdown prisoners had regular access to the libraries \nand that illiterate and non-English-speaking inmates had sufficient direct assistance to make their \ntime in the library effective. See id. at 347-48. The Supreme Court held that this injunction was \noverbroad because the only injury demonstrated by a named plaintiff resulted from the prison’s \nfailure to provide special services to inmates who were illiterate. See id. at 357. Insofar as there \nwere inadequacies in the prison’s policies regarding services “required by non-English speakers, \n- 9 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 15 of 38\n\nby prisoners in lockdown, and by the inmate population at large,” “they have not been found to \nhave harmed any plaintiff in this lawsuit, and hence were not the proper object of this District \nCourt’s remediation.” Id. at 358. The illiterate named plaintiff, the Court explained, “lacked \nstanding to complain of injuries to non-English speakers and lockdown prisoners.” Id. at 358 n.6. \nThe named plaintiffs in this case face the same difficulty as the named plaintiff in Lewis \nv. Casey. None of them purports to belong to any of the four groups they believe remain at risk \nof institutionalization, and none of them has shown that they have been personally harmed by the \nalleged defects in how the State allocates expedited CC waiver offers. Their memorandum in \nsupport of their motion barely mentions two of the three named plaintiffs—Kenneth Roman and \nRickii Ainey—and they have not shown that the third—Elizabeth Foster—falls within any of the \ngroups the Plaintiffs claim remain at risk of institutionalization. \nEven if the named plaintiffs have standing to challenge the 32-hour cap on LT-PCS, that \ndoes not mean that they have standing to seek broad changes to the rules governing expedited \nslots in the CC waiver. Again, Lewis v. Casey is instructive: “The remedy must of course be \nlimited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has established.” 518 \nU.S. at 357. “The actual-injury requirement would hardly serve the purpose . . . of preventing \ncourts  from  undertaking  tasks  assigned  to  the  political  branches  . . .  if  once  a  plaintiff \ndemonstrated harm from one particular inadequacy in government administration, the court were \nauthorized to remedy all inadequacies in that administration.” Id.  \nBecause the Plaintiffs have not shown that any of the named plaintiffs has been or will \nimminently be harmed by the rules governing the allocation of CC waiver slots, the class lacks \nstanding to seek changes to the waiver process. \n- 10 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 16 of 38\n\nB.  The Plaintiffs Have Not Satisfied The Preliminary Injunction Requirements. \n“A  plaintiff  seeking  a  preliminary  injunction  must  establish  [1]  that he  is  likely  to \nsucceed  on  the  merits,  [2]  that  he  is  likely  to  suffer  irreparable  harm  in  the  absence  of \npreliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is in \nthe public interest.” Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). The Fifth Circuit “ha[s] cautioned \nrepeatedly that a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy which should not be granted \nunless the party seeking it has clearly carried the burden of persuasion on all four requirements.” \nLake Charles Diesel, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 328 F.3d 192, 196 (5th Cir. 2003) (emphasis \nadded; internal quotation marks omitted).   \nPreliminary relief of the kind sought by the Plaintiffs here—a mandatory preliminary \ninjunction that goes beyond maintaining the status quo—is “particularly disfavored, and should \nnot be issued unless the facts and law clearly favor the moving party.” Martinez v. Mathews, 544 \nF.2d 1233, 1243 ( 5th Cir. 1976); accord O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal v. \nAshcroft, 389 F.3d 973, 975 (10th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (motions for a mandatory preliminary \ninjunction or a preliminary injunction that alters the status quo “must be more closely scrutinized \nto assure that the exigencies of the case support the granting of [such] a remedy . . . .”); Stanley \nv. Univ. of S. Cal., 13 F.3d 1313, 1320 ( 9th Cir. 1994). Furthermore, when plaintiffs seek \ninjunctive relief against state agencies, federal courts must give “appropriate consideration . . . to \nprinciples of federalism in determining the availability and scope of equitable relief.” Rizzo v. \nGoode, 423 U.S. 362, 379 (1976); cf. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 610 (1999) (Kennedy, J., \nconcurring,  joined  by  Breyer,  J.)  (noting  the  “federalism  costs  inherent  in  referring  state \ndecisions regarding the administration of treatment programs and the allocation of resources to \nthe reviewing authority of the federal courts”). \n- 11 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 17 of 38\n\n1.  The Plaintiffs Have Not Met Their Burden Of Showing That They \nAre Likely To Succeed On The Merits. \n“The sine qua non of [the preliminary-injunction analysis] is whether the plaintiffs are \nlikely to succeed on the merits.” Weaver v. Henderson, 984 F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1993). If the \nPlaintiffs cannot show a “substantial likelihood of success on the merits, [the Court] need not \naddress” the remaining factors in order to deny them preliminary relief. La Union del Pueblo \nEntero v. FEMA, 608 F.3d 217, 225 ( 5th Cir. 2010). The Plaintiffs cannot make the required \nshowing  here  because  (a) Louisiana  has  already  taken  steps  to  reasonably  accommodate \nindividuals who require more than 32 hours per week of personal care services and (b) the \nPlaintiffs’  request  for  additional  accommodations  would  fundamentally  alter  the  State’s \nprograms. \na)  Louisiana Has Already Taken Steps To Modify Its Programs \nTo Accommodate The Needs Of Those Who Need More Than \n32 Hours Of Paid LT-PCS Services.  \nLouisiana is committed to dedicating available resources to provide individuals with \ndisabilities a full array of quality, long-term care services that will enable them to live in the \nsettings of their choice, and it has a comprehensive, effectively working plan to provide those \nservices in the community when appropriate. The State has demonstrated that commitment not \nonly through the dramatic expansion of its HCBS programs over the last several years, 5 but also \nthrough the steps it has taken since the Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit to accommodate LT-PCS \nrecipients who require assistance for more than 32 hours per week in order to avoid unnecessary \ninstitutionalization. Cf. Arc of Wash. State, Inc. v. Braddock, 427 F.3d 615, 620 (9th Cir. 2005) \n                                                 \n5 The Advocacy Center has recognized DHH’s efforts to expand HCBS services in the state. See Seniors and People \nwith Disabilities Avoid Institutionalization, Louisiana is First State in the Country to Expand Eligibility for Home \nand Community Based Services, http://www.advocacyla.org/index.php/news-reader/items/seniors-and-people-with-\ndisabilities-avoid-institutionalization.html (dated Aug. 10, 2011) (last visited Oct. 27, 2011). \n- 12 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 18 of 38\n\n(“So long as states are genuinely and effectively in the process of deinstitutionalizing disabled \npersons ‘with an even hand,’ [the courts] will not interfere.” (quoting Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 605 \n(plurality opinion))). \nThe  modifications  already  made  by  the  State  are  in  fact  more  generous  than  those \noriginally  proposed  by  the  Plaintiffs.  The  Plaintiffs  initially  asked  the  State  to  restore  the \nprevious level of personal assistance they received through the LT-PCS program. Instead, the \nState has decided to allow LT-PCS recipients who would otherwise require institutionalization to \nmove to the front of the waiting list for CC waiver services. The CC waiver allows recipients to \nreceive more hours of personal assistance than the Plaintiffs sought in their Complaint plus \nadditional services that are not available in the LT-PCS program. Third Eley Decl. ¶ 18. DHH \nexpects that this broader array of services will generally be more effective in keeping individuals \nout of nursing homes than adding a few more hours of LT-PCS would be. Id. \nAdditionally, the absence of any waiting list for individuals in nursing homes to enroll in \nthe CC waiver demonstrates the effectiveness of Louisiana’s HCBS programs. The Olmstead \nCourt recognized that a State could be fully compliant with the ADA even if there was a waiting \nlist for people in nursing homes to obtain  HCBS waiver services. 527 U.S. at 605-06.  In \nLouisiana,  nursing  home  residents  do not   need  to  wait  for  a  waiver  offer.  The  Plaintiffs \nrecognize that allowing LT-PCS recipients to access expedited waiver slots “clearly represents a \nstep in the right direction,” Pls.’ Mem. at 7, but they maintain that the State’s HCBS programs \nstill are not quite good enough. But the ADA does not require the State’s modifications to be \nperfect.6 Nor does it r equire the State to provide precisely the modifications the Plaintiffs \n                                                 \n6 See Fink v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Personnel, 53 F.3d 565, 567 (2d Cir. 1995) (“[The RA] does not require the perfect \nelimination of all disadvantage that may flow from the disability . . . .”); see also Stewart v. County of Brown, 86 \nF.3d 107, 112 (7th Cir. 1996); Fink v. Richmond, 405 Fed. App’x 719, 723 (4th Cir. Dec. 16, 2010) (unpublished). \n- 13 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 19 of 38\n\nrequest.7  Rather,  the  State  must  be  given  some  “leeway”  in  how  it  administers  its  HCBS \nprograms. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 605; see also Pa. Protection & Advocacy, Inc. v. Pa. Dep’t of \nPublic Welfare, 402 F.3d 374, 381-82 (3d Cir. 2005) (“When an agency has implemented a \nsufficient compliance plan (i.e., when it has demonstrated a commitment to comply with the \nADA  and  RA),  [a  federal  court]  must  be  wary  of  judicial  mandates  that  could  thwart  or \nundermine the agency’s authority to carry out that plan as it sees fit.”). \nb)  The  Plaintiffs’  Request  For  Further  Changes  To  The  CC \nWaiver Offer Would Fundamentally Alter That Program. \nThe Plaintiffs propose a list of changes to how DHH operates the new emergency slots in \nthe CC waiver program. Pls.’ Mem. at 28-29. Their proposed changes include:  \n(1) Offering expedited CC waiver slots to any “individuals who need more than 32 hours \nper week of LT-PCS to avoid a decline in health, safety, or welfare that will lead to \nthe individual’s eventual, though perhaps not immediate, placement in an institution”;  \n(2) Allowing individuals whom DHH has approved for fewer than 32 hours per week to \nrequest expedited CC waiver slots without first asking for more LT-PCS;  \n(3) For anyone who was receiving more than 32 hours of LT-PCS on September 5, 2010, \nand who requests an expedited CC waiver slot, restoring or maintaining their previous \nlevel of LT-PCS between the time of their request and DHH’s decision, and between \nthe offer and the commencement of services.8 \nAs set forth below, the Plaintiffs’ requests would fundamentally re-align DHH’s policy \ndeterminations of how best to best use a limited resource (EDA/CC waiver slots) to serve \n                                                 \n7 See Huber v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 486 F.3d 480, 484 (8th Cir. 2007) (Title I of the ADA does not require the \nplaintiff’s “most preferred alternative” or “an accommodation that is ideal from the [plaintiff’s] perspective, only an \naccommodation that is reasonable”); see also Fink v. N.Y.C., 53 F.3d at 567; Trepka v. Bd. of Educ. of the Cleveland \nCity Sch. Dist., 28 Fed. App’x 455, 460 (6th Cir. Jan. 24, 2002) (unpublished); Gile v. United Airlines, Inc., 95 F.3d \n492, 499 (7th Cir. 1996). \n8 Although the Plaintiffs suggest that 100 CC waiver slots may be insufficient to accommodate the entire class, Pls.’ \nMem. at 9, they have not asked the Court to void the current 100-slot cap. Pls.’ Mem. at 28-29 & Proposed Order. In \nany event, that relief would be premature. Most of the slots remain unfilled, and DHH will consider whether to add \nmore if and when the time comes.  See Third Eley Decl. ¶ 41. \n- 14 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 20 of 38\n\nindividuals at risk of institutionalization, and would pose logistical and practical difficulties that \ntake the Plaintiffs’ demands well beyond requests for “reasonable accommodation.” \n(1)  DHH cannot, without fundamentally altering the CC waiver, offer expedited slots to \n“individuals who need more than 32 hours per week of LT-PCS to avoid a decline in health, \nsafety, or welfare that will lead to the individual’s eventual . . . placement in an institution.” \nFirst, a standard that requires the State to provide each LT-PCS recipient a level of \nbenefits sufficient “to avoid a decline in health, safety, or welfare” would be impossible to \nadminister in a program that serves primarily the elderly and individuals with degenerative \ndisabilities and diseases. See, e.g., Decl. of Lisa Richards, Doc. 73-3, at 113 (explaining that \nElizabeth Foster’s “dementia is gradually progressing, which will lead to a greater and greater \nneed for assistance”).  Nor are Defendants aware of any sound diagnostic tool that could be used \nto assess whether someone requires a specified number of hours of paid assistance in order “to \navoid a decline in health, safety or welfare” that would result in “eventual” admission to a \nnursing facility.  As a result, the availability of the EDA/CC waiver would be entirely subjective. \nSecond, because the Plaintiffs’ “eventuality” standard sets such a low bar, its practical \neffect would be to eliminate DHH’s ability to give expedited offers to those LT-PCS recipients \nwho require them most immediately while displacing other groups on the waiting list, including \nthose in the high priority groups.  \nEven though the number of waiver slots is fixed, the turnover in the waiver population \ncurrently allows DHH to offer slots to individuals in the high priority groups (those subject to \nabuse and neglect, those with ALS, and those already in nursing homes) with virtually no wait. \nThere is a significant waiting list for LT-PCS recipients and individuals without any access to \nHCBS, but the list does move and DHH is able to make hundreds of new offers every quarter. In \n- 15 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 21 of 38\n\nthe last year, over 1,500 LT-PCS recipients have been offered EDA/CC waiver slots.  Because \nindividuals who receive expedited waiver slots skip ahead of all of the people just mentioned, \nexpanding the category of individuals eligible for expedited slots would very likely prevent DHH \nfrom promptly offering waiver services to  everyone in the high-priority  groups  and would \nprolong the already-lengthy waits faced by others on the waiting list. \nOlmstead prohibits these unfair results. Under Olmstead, the ADA does not require States \nto  modify  their  programs  to  accommodate  individuals—even  those  who  are  currently \ninstitutionalized—when,  “in  the  allocation  of  available  resources,  immediate  relief  for  the \nplaintiffs would be inequitable, given the responsibility the State has undertaken for the care and \ntreatment of a large and diverse population of persons with . . . disabilities.” 527 U.S. at 604. If \nthe ADA does not allow a court to order a State to move an institutionalized plaintiff ahead of \nothers  on  the  waiting  list,  it c ertainly  does  not  allow  a  court  to  order  the  State  to  move \ncommunity-based  plaintiffs  ahead  of  others  on  the  waiting  list.  The  Plaintiffs’  requested \nmodification is therefore exactly the kind that Olmstead says would be a fundamental alteration.9 \n(2) The Plaintiffs also seek an order directing DHH to allow individuals who have been \napproved for fewer than 32 hours of LT-PCS per week to obtain expedited CC waiver slots. \nThese individuals are not class members10 and the named plaintiffs lack standing to seek this \n                                                 \n9 The Plaintiffs’ challenge to the use of the word “immediate” in the protocol for processing expedited waiver \nrequests rests on an over-reading of that document.  The word “immediate” does not appear in the rule or the \nguidance that is actually applied by the Service Review Panel.  The word was used to describe the kind of \ninformation a Medical Certification Specialist should look for during a home visit.  DHH is reissuing the protocol to \nclarify that the Medical Certification Specialist need not limit the information collected to evidence demonstrating a \nneed for “immediate” institutional placement. See Third Eley Decl. Att. C.  \n10 Individuals who are approved for fewer than 32 hours receive that amount of LT-PCS not because of the 32-hour \ncap but because of DHH’s methodology for allocating services within the permissible range—a methodology the \nPlaintiffs are “not challenging” in this case. Pls. Opp’n to the Mot. for S.J., Doc. 38, at 19 n.105 \n- 16 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 22 of 38\n\nrelief. In any event, granting the Plaintiffs’ request would fundamentally alter both the LT-PCS \nprogram and the CC waiver program. \nFirst, allowing individuals who are allocated fewer than 32 hours of LT-PCS to request \nan  expedited  CC  waiver  slot  would  fundamentally  alter  the  LT-PCS  program  by  allowing \nindividuals to circumvent the existing appeals process—a process required by both state statute \nand federal Medicaid regulations. See 42 C.F.R. § 431.200 et seq.; La. Rev. Stat. § 46:107. That \nprocess gives individuals approved for less than the program maximum the option of appealing \nDHH’s decision and receiving up to 32 hours of LT-PCS. Third Eley Decl. ¶ 57-58. If they \nremain approved for fewer than 32 hours it is because they have decided not to appeal or because \nthey were unable to demonstrate an error in DHH’s determination of their acuity level. Id. ¶ 58.11 \nThe Plaintiffs effectively ask the Court to wipe out the LT-PCS appeals process and \nallow anyone who thinks they need more help to request an expedited CC waiver offer instead of \nmore LT-PCS. The Plaintiffs cite no legal authority to support their argument that individuals \nshould be allowed to circumvent the agency’s established and well-functioning procedures.   \nSecond, well over 12,000 LT-PCS recipients are currently approved for less than 32 \nhours of LT-PCS. Allowing them to apply for expedited waiver slots would likely increase the \nnumber of requests to a level where DHH could not process them in a timely fashion. Id. ¶¶ 59-\n61. \nWith the number of requests it receives now, DHH can process and grant a request within \ntwo weeks. Id. ¶ 30. This quick turnaround would be impossible if the agency were inundated \nwith requests from people receiving less than 32 hours. As a result, those who are eligible under \nthe current rules would face new delays in the processing of their requests. Id. ¶ 59. \n                                                 \n11 If the Plaintiffs are correct that some individuals choose not to file an appeal because they view the process as too \ninconvenient or not worth their time, this suggests that their needs are not as great as the Plaintiffs paint them. \n- 17 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 23 of 38\n\nGranting the Plaintiffs’ request would also divert agency resources away from other \nimportant matters. Id. ¶ 60. Each home visit with an applicant for an expedited slot requires \napproximately three hours of the Medical Certification Specialist’s time. Id. That is time not \nspent on his or her other responsibilities: implementing the new CC waiver, reviewing critical \nincidents among the waiver population, assisting waiver recipients and applicants, and providing \nextra assistance to those transitioning out of nursing facilities. Id. The current demands of the \nprocess  for  granting  expedited waiver slots  are burdensome but manageable.  Id.  ¶ 59. The \nadditional burden of processing requests from people who have been approved for less than 32 \nhours per week would make it impossible for DHH staff to carry out their other duties. Id. ¶¶ 59-\n61. Because DHH has determined that the people approved for fewer than 32 hours are more \nindependent than those approved for 32 hours, the percentage of their requests that are actually \nbe granted would likely be relatively small, and  the  costs associated  with processing their \nrequests would well outweigh the benefits. See id. ¶ 58. \nThird, for the reasons discussed above in connection with the Plaintiffs’ “eventual” \ninstitutionalization standard, offering an expedited CC waiver slot to individuals who have not \nyet been approved for 32 hours of LT-PCS would cause additional delays for other people on the \nwaiting list, including people who currently receive no state-funded HCBS at all. Id. ¶ 54. \n(3) Finally, the Plaintiffs ask that, for anyone who was receiving more than 32 hours of \nLT-PCS on September 5, 2010, DHH be required to restore their previous level of services \nduring the periods (1) between their  request for an expedited waiver offer and the Service \nReview Panel’s determination about whether to grant the request and (2) when the request is \ngranted, between the panel’s decision and the commencement of waiver services. Again, the \nADA does not require DHH to alter its program as the Plaintiffs propose. \n- 18 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 24 of 38\n\nThe time between a request for expedited CC waiver services and the commencement of \nthose services is already short: about six weeks. See id. ¶¶ 30, 36, 59, 63. Moreover, because of \nthe administrative realities of operating a program with over 13,000 beneficiaries, processing a \nDHH directive to override the 32-hour cap for an individual takes around a week, and sometimes \nmore. Id. ¶ 64. Consequently, the restored LT-PCS level would still be unavailable for the \nindividual for a good portion of the period that he or she is waiting for CC services to begin. In \nthe event that DHH becomes aware of a situation where an increase in hours is necessary to \navoid  institutionalization  during  that  brief  period,  it r etains  the  discretion  to  make \naccommodations as appropriate. There is no need for an administratively burdensome, blanket \nrule of the type the Plaintiffs’ propose.   \nc)  The Plaintiffs’ Alternative Request For Changes To LT-PCS \nWould Fundamentally Alter That Program. \nIn the alternative to their request for changes to the CC waiver, the Plaintiffs ask for a \npreliminary injunction requiring the State to “continue the [LT-PCS] services of class members \nwhose services have not yet been reduced to the 32-hour maximum at the current level, and to \nprovide a mechanism for class members whose services have already been reduced to obtain \n[LT-PCS] services in excess of the 32-hour cap.” Pls.’ Mot. at 28. Because DHH has already \nreassessed almost everyone in the LT-PCS program using the new rule, Third Eley Decl. ¶¶ 6-7, \nmaintaining services at their current level is an option only for a negligible portion of the class.  \nThe alternative relief requested is completely unjustified and unnecessary in light of \nDefendants’ decision to offer expedited access to the CC waiver for individuals who believe they \nneed more than the 32 hours of paid assistance available through the LT-PCS program in order to \navoid institutionalization. The Plaintiffs are not specific about what kind of “mechanism” the \nState must create, and Defendants cannot conceive of any “mechanism” for identifying class \n- 19 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 25 of 38\n\nmembers and determining how many hours to provide each that would not fundamentally alter \nthe LT-PCS program or impose an undue burden on DHH. But because the Plaintiffs’ proposal is \nso lacking in detail, neither Defendants nor the Court can properly assess the financial and \nadministrative burdens associated with creating and implementing it. In any event, the Plaintiffs \nare not substantially likely to obtain a judgment ordering DHH to create a “mechanism” for LT-\nPCS recipients to exceed the program’s 32-hour cap. \n(1)  Providing  Additional  LT-PCS  Beyond  The  32-Hour \nCap Would Fundamentally Alter The Nature Of The \nService. \nFirst,  allowing  class  members  to  receive  services  above  the  32-hour  cap  would \nfundamentally alter the LT-PCS program because it would violate Louisiana’s state Medicaid \nplan. The state plan provides that the State will furnish up to 32 hours of paid personal care \nservices to individuals who meet the State’s criteria. See id. ¶ 67 & Att. E. It is a fundamental \ntenet  of  Medicaid  law  that  the  federal  government  will  only  provide  federal  financial \nparticipation for services covered by the state plan. Therefore, if the State were to provide \nadditional hours beyond those set forth in its state plan, the State would have to pay for those \nadditional services with 100% state dollars. (Currently, the federal government reimburses the \nState  in  excess  of  70%  for  its  Medicaid  expenditures.)  By  contrast,  if  the  State  provides \nadditional  services  through  the  CC  waiver  (as  it  is  doing),  its  expenditures  are  federally \nreimbursed. The Plaintiffs’ proposal to provide LT-PCS beyond what is approved in the state \nplan would be fiscally disastrous for the State. See id.12   \n                                                 \n12 It is also important to note that the very fact that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) \napproved this state plan amendment implicitly reflects a judgment that the service, with the 32-hour cap, is \n“sufficient in amount, duration, and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose.” 42 C.F.R. § 440.230(b). \n- 20 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 26 of 38\n\nSecond, the Plaintiffs’ proposed relief would fundamentally alter the nature of the benefit \nprovided in the LT-PCS program. Louisiana does not allocate services in the LT-PCS program \nbased on how many hours of assistance an individual requires to avoid entering a nursing home, \nto avoid “risk of institutionalization,” or even more vaguely, “to avoid a decline in health, safety, \nor welfare that will lead to the individual’s eventual . . . placement in an institution.” Pls.’ Mem. \nat 29. The State provides a limited benefit of 18 to 32 hours of personal care services. Third Eley \nDecl.  ¶¶ 57,  69.  The  agency  relies  on  an  evidence-based  uniform  assessment  tool  not  to \ndetermine how many hours of assistance each recipient “needs” but the recipient’s demonstrated \nindependence in performing ADLs as compared with others in the LT-PCS program. Id. ¶¶ 66, \n69. The agency then allocates service hours based on the recipient’s relative acuity and the \nfunding available. Id. This means that providing more services to individuals at one part of the \nacuity spectrum leaves others with less. Id. ¶ 69. \nDHH  adopted  this  resource-allocation  methodology  in  2009  after  evaluating  and \nexperimenting with a number of different alternatives and consulting with experts in the field. Id. \nBased on the State’s experience with this methodology so far, DHH believes it produces an \nallocation of LT-PCS hours that is more fair and efficient than the agency’s previous approach \nand gives individual beneficiaries more flexibility in how they utilize the services available. Id. \nThe Plaintiffs’ preferred methodology for allocating service hours would be not only different \nbut unworkable. Defendants are unaware of any established diagnostic tool for determining how \nmany hours of state-funded assistance  any particular individual “needs” to avoid a risk of \ninstitutionalization.  Id. ¶ 47. This kind of prediction is difficult, if not impossible, because \nplacement in an institution is often the result of the entirely unpredictable: a slip-and-fall or a \ndifficult family decision about what is best for all involved. Id. No less significantly, providing \n- 21 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 27 of 38\n\nindividuals with higher levels of acuity with whatever services they need to remain in their \nhomes would reduce the amount of funding DHH can devote to LT-PCS recipients with lower \nlevels of acuity or to filling new waiver slots. See id. ¶¶ 68-69. \nThe  Plaintiffs’  proposed  redefinition  of  the  benefit  available  through  the  LT-PCS \nprogram is thus exactly the kind of redefinition that the Supreme Court has held States are not \nrequired to undertake. In Alexander v. Choate, individuals with disabilities challenged a State’s \n“reduction from 20 to 14 in the number of inpatient hospital days per fiscal year that Tennessee \nMedicaid would pay hospitals on behalf of a Medicaid recipient.” 369 U.S. 287, 289 (1985). The \nCourt held that the State was not required to change its rules to provide more than 14 days of \ncoverage for individuals with disabilities even if they had a greater need. See id. at 302-03. As \nthe Court explained, “Medicaid programs do not guarantee that each recipient will receive that \nlevel of health care precisely tailored to his or her particular needs. Instead, the benefit provided \nthrough Medicaid is a particular package of health care services, such as 14 days of inpatient \ncoverage.”  Id.  at  303.  Nothing  in  federal  disability  discrimination  law,  the  Court  held, \n“require[d] the State to alter this definition of the benefit being offered simply to meet the reality \nthat the handicapped have greater medical needs.” Id. For exactly the same reason, federal law \ndoes not require Louisiana to redefine the “particular package of health care services” available \nthrough  the  LT-PCS  program  to  satisfy  the  amorphous  objective  of  eliminating  risk  of \ninstitutionalization. \n(2)  Requiring  An  “Exceptions  Mechanism”  Would \nSignificantly  Increase  The  Costs  Of  The  Program, \nJeopardizing  The  Financial  Stability  Of  The  HCBS \nProgram As A Whole.  \nEnrollment in the LT-PCS program grew by over 10% in the last year alone, thereby \npresenting significant fiscal challenges for the State. Without the cap, LT-PCS expenditures \n- 22 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 28 of 38\n\nwould be significantly greater, and the State would have been unable to accommodate the \nprogram’s dramatic enrollment growth. But the creation of an “exceptions mechanism” could \nerase all of those savings and more, especially as the Plaintiffs do not propose any limitation on \nthe upper limit of hours that they are seeking (not even the 42 hour limit to which Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel previously agreed as part of the Barthelemy settlement). See Third Eley Decl. ¶¶ 68-69. \nWhile the State’s HCBS programs have continued to grow, there is no evidence that \ncapping LT-PCS at 32 hours has led to an increase in nursing home utilization that might, as the \nPlaintiffs expected, increase total long-term care costs. See id. ¶¶ 4-16. Under Olmstead, the \nmillions of dollars in new spending that would accompany the Plaintiffs’ proposed modification \nis sufficient to reject their claim, cf. 527 U.S. at 603-05, and the Court must give “appropriate \ndeference to the program funding decisions of state policy makers.” Id. at 610 (Kennedy, J., \nconcurring, joined by Breyer, J.). “No State has unlimited resources, and each must make hard \ndecisions on how much to allocate to treatment of diseases and disabilities.” Id. at 612 (Kennedy, \nJ.,  concurring).  The  State’s  decisions  about  how  to  allocate  its  limited  resources  may  be \n“unfortunate” or even tragic. Id. “The judgment, however, is a political one and not within the \nreach of the [ADA].” Id. at 612. \nThe Plaintiffs do not squarely answer the State’s evidence, because their analysis of the \ncosts and benefits of the 32-hour cap applies the wrong legal standard. They have focused solely \non whether the average cost of treating a class member in the community is less than the average \ncost of treating her in a nursing home. Olmstead held that that analysis was incorrect. Like the \nPlaintiffs here, the district court in Olmstead had “compared the cost of caring for the plaintiffs \nin a community-based setting with the cost of caring for them in an institution. That simple \ncomparison showed that community placements cost less than institutional confinements.” 527 \n- 23 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 29 of 38\n\nU.S. at 604; see also id. at 594-95. The district court held that this was enough for the plaintiffs \nto prevail, but the Supreme Court disagreed because “a comparison so simple overlooks costs the \nState cannot avoid.” See id. at 604-06 (plurality opinion); see also id. at 604 & n.15 (observing, \nfor example, that a State may not be able to offset increased overall HCBS expenditures with the \nimmediate closure of institutions); cf. id. at 607 (Stevens, J., concurring) (courts must consider \n“costs unrelated to the treatment of [the individual plaintiffs]”). Plaintiffs thus ask the Court to \nrest its decision on exactly the same calculus that the Supreme Court rejected in Olmstead. \nCourts must consider system-wide, not individual-specific, costs. \nEven  if  the  individual-specific  analysis  were  appropriate,  the  Plaintiffs’  simplistic \nanalysis is incomplete. The Plaintiffs argue that raising the cap on LT-PCS to 42 hours is \nreasonable because the cost of providing the average beneficiary a full year of nursing facility \nservices is less than the cost of providing the average beneficiary a full year of LT-PCS at 42 \nhours per week. That analysis is inadequate for at least two reasons. First, it overlooks that many \nLT-PCS recipients who are actually admitted to a nursing facility for a long-term stay will not \nremain institutionalized because they will receive a CC waiver slot. Second, the Plaintiffs’ \ncomparison also fails to recognize that some people who are “at risk of institutionalization” with \n32 hours of LT-PCS will never transition to a nursing facility, that some people who receive 42 \nhours of LT-PCS will still transition to a nursing facility, and that the State will need to pay for \nsome amount of LT-PCS during the period(s) when the individual is not in a nursing facility. A \nmore complete analysis would compare whether the total cost of the mix of LT-PCS and nursing \nfacility services that an individual will receive over the course of her lifetime will be more or less \nif the cap on LT-PCS is 32 hours or 42 hours. See generally Vernon L. Greene, Nursing Home \nAdmission Risk and the Cost-Effectiveness of Community-Based Long-Term Care: A Framework \n- 24 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 30 of 38\n\nAnalysis, 22 Health Services Research 655 (Dec. 1987). In any event, given that capping the LT-\nPCS  program  at  32  hours  has  allowed  the  State  to  continue  serving  an  increasing  HCBS \npopulation, the ADA provides no basis for reversing the State’s decision. \nFor these reasons and more, the Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits. 13 \n2.  The  Plaintiffs  Have  Not  Established  That  They  Would  Suffer \nIrreparable Harm In The Absence Of A Preliminary Injunction. \nThe Plaintiffs must also “demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an \ninjunction.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis in original). Further, this likely injury must be \nimminent. Humana, Inc. v. Jacobson, 804 F.2d 1390, 1394 (5th Cir. 1984). \nAs  discussed  below,  the  Plaintiffs’  evidence  does  not  demonstrate  a  likelihood  of \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief. And the year they waited before moving for \npreliminary relief weighs against a finding in their favor. See, e.g., Charlesbank Equity Fund II \nv. Blinds To Go, Inc., 370 F.3d 151, 163 (1st Cir. 2004); Kan. Health Care Ass’n, Inc. v. Kan. \nDept. of Soc. and Rehab. Servs., 31 F.3d 1536, 1543-44 (10th Cir. 1994). \na)  Defendants  Have  Voluntarily  Removed  Any  Threat  Of \nIrreparable  Harm  To  Every  Individual  Brought  To  Their \nAttention By Class Counsel. \nDHH has  already  extended  or restored the level of service that each  of the named \nplaintiffs was receiving before the 32-hour cap took effect. DHH has done the same for each of \nthe seven unnamed plaintiffs identified in the Plaintiffs’ motion and several other individuals the \nPlaintiffs do not mention in their motion. Third Eley Decl. ¶ 70. These extensions will remain in \neffect through at least February 29, at which time DHH will assess whether further extensions \n                                                 \n13 In addition to the arguments set forth above, Defendants maintain that capping the LT-PCS program at 32 hours \nper week is not “discrimination” within the meaning of the ADA, even if some LT-PCS recipients are at risk of, or \nin fact require, institutionalization. See Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss, Doc. 11; Defs.’ Reply to Pls.’ Opp’n to the Mot. for \nS.J., Doc. 39; Defs.’ Response to the Statement of Interest of the U.S., Doc. 48. Defendants have not repeated those \narguments here in light of the Court’s denial of summary judgment in May. However, Defendants respectfully \nrequest that the Court reconsider that aspect of its decision. \n- 25 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 31 of 38\n\nare appropriate for all or some of the individuals. Id. As a result, none of them currently face any \nthreatened harm as a result of the 32-hour cap. DHH is inclined to offer similar extensions to \nother individuals whom class counsel bring to Defendants’ attention, provided that the number of \nrequests remains reasonably small. Id. \nMoreover, four of the unnamed individuals cited by the Plaintiffs as facing irreparable \nharm—I.M.L., V.U.S., S.M., and E.B.—have already received offers to enroll in the CC waiver.  \nId. ¶¶ 72, 75. Two received expedited offers under the June 2011 Rule; two received ordinary \noffers from the waiting list. Id. One of the named plaintiffs, Rickii Ainey, has likewise been \noffered an expedited slot.  Id. ¶ 76. \nb)  The  Plaintiffs  Have  Not  Demonstrated  A  Likelihood  Of \nIrreparable Harm To The Broader LT-PCS Population. \nWhile  the  Plaintiffs  cannot  show  a  likelihood  of  irreparable  harm  to  any  of  the \nindividuals identified in their motion because of the extensions granted by Defendants, they \nsuggest that “there is no reason to assume that all class members who need such extensions have \ncontacted Plaintiffs’ counsel.” Pls. Mem. at 9-10. But the Plaintiffs’ speculation that a large \ngroup of unidentified beneficiaries will be irreparably harmed by the denial of their motion is \nbelied by the absence of any noticeable increase in transitions from LT-PCS to nursing facilities \nduring the year that DHH has been implementing the 32-hour cap. Third Eley Decl. ¶¶ 4-12. \nThe Plaintiffs’ inability, after a year of litigation, to identify more than a handful of \nindividuals who they believe are at risk of institutionalization reinforces the statistical evidence. \nThe Advocacy Center, whose lawyers serve as lead class counsel, has deep connections to the \ncommunity of individuals with disabilities and is well known to individuals receiving LT-PCS. \nMany if not most recipients will contact the Advocacy Center if they are having issues with their \n- 26 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 32 of 38\n\nMedicaid services. Id. ¶ 71. Moreover, the Advocacy Center has been soliciting class members \nfor a year. Id. ¶ 71 & Atts. F-H.14 \n  The availability of expedited CC waiver slots mitigates the risk that the Advocacy Center \nhas failed to identify some individuals who would be institutionalized without preliminary relief. \nWhile DHH’s rules allow the agency to fill at most 100 waiver slots with expedited offers at any \ngiven time, all but a handful remain available now. Id. ¶ 41. The current allotment is unlikely to \nrun out before the parties file dispositive motions this Spring, and DHH will consider revising its \nrules to allow more expedited waiver offers if need be.   \n3.  Balancing The Equities And Consideration Of The Public Interest \nWeigh  Heavily  Against  Granting  The  Plaintiffs’  Request  For  A \nPreliminary Injunction \nEven if the Plaintiffs could establish likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable \nharm, the Court should deny the motion because they have failed to establish that the balance of \nequities tips in their favor and the injunction is in the public interest. When the government is the \nparty the plaintiffs seek to enjoin, these two factors merge. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418 \n(2009); see also Spiegel v. City of Houston, 636 F.2d 997, 1002 (5th Cir. 1981).  \nAs set forth above and in the declaration of Hugh R. Eley, the preliminary injunction \nrequested by the Plaintiffs would have significant negative consequences for the State’s HCBS \nprogram and its beneficiaries. See generally Third Eley Decl. ¶¶ 52-69. Assistant Secretary \nEley’s analysis of the programmatic impact of the Plaintiffs’ proposed injunction merit careful \n                                                 \n14 See, e.g., DHH Changes EDA Waiver Rules, http://advocacyla.org/index.php/news-reader/items/dhh-changes-\neda-waiver-rules.html (dated July 5, 2011) (last visited Oct. 27, 2011) (“[If] you need more than 32 hours a week of \nLT-PCS to avoid having to go into a nursing facility, please contact [the Plaintiffs’ counsel] . . . .”); Judge Rules: \nPitts  v.  DHH  Can  Proceed,  http://advocacyla.org/index.php/news-reader/items/judge-rules-pitts-v-dhh-can-\nproceedhtml (dated May 25, 2011) (last visited Oct. 27, 2011) (“If you are receiving or are about to receive LT-PCS \nservices, and you need more than 32 hours of service to be able to avoid going into a nursing home, contact the \nAdvocacy  Center.”);  Class  Action  Filed  To  Stop  Cuts  In  Home  Care,  http://advocacyla.org/index.php/news-\nreader/items/class-action-filed-to-stop-cuts-in-home-care.html (dated Sept. 22, 2010) (last visited Oct. 27, 2011).  \n- 27 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 33 of 38\n\nattention and his conclusions warrant deference. Cf. Winter, 555 U.S. at 27 (reversing the entry \nof a preliminary injunction where the district court “failed properly to defer to senior Navy \nofficers’ specific, predictive judgments about how the preliminary injunction would reduce the \neffectiveness of the Navy’s SOCAL training exercises”); Cellnet Commc’ns Inc. v. FCC, 149 \nF.3d 429, 441 (6th Cir. 1998) (“[A]n agency’s predictive judgments about areas that are within \nthe agency’s field of discretion and expertise are entitled to particularly deferential review.”).  \nFirst, the Plaintiffs proposed changes to the CC waiver would negatively affect countless \nothers  seeking  access  to  the  same  service,  and  would  introduce  significant  administrative \ndifficulties. Third Eley Decl. ¶¶ 52-64. Making expedited CC waiver offers to LT-PCS recipients \napproved  for  less  than  32 hour s  and  LT-PCS  recipients  facing  only  “eventual” \ninstitutionalization would increase the time others wait for waiver offers and increase the time it \ntakes DHH to process expedited waiver requests from those who are currently eligible. Id. ¶¶ 53-\n54, 59-61. Given the minimal showing applicants would need to make under the Plaintiffs’ \n“eventuality” standard, the 100 expedited waiver slots currently available would quickly be \nfilled, creating a backlog for others and/or reducing the number of regular spot available to \npeople who do not receive LT-PCS. Id. ¶ 54. Maintaining all service levels over 32 hours, or \nrestoring pre-cap service levels that were over 32 hours, for individuals waiting to receive CC \nservices through an expedited slot would be unlikely to prevent a significant number of people \nfrom entering nursing homes, and it would be unfeasible to try to change service levels for such a \nshort period of time.  Id. ¶¶ 36, 62-64. \nFurther, the problems that the Plaintiffs’ proposal would create for others on the CC \nwaiting list would be irreversible. DHH will not be able to revoke waiver offers made pursuant \n- 28 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 34 of 38\n\nto the preliminary injunction in the event that Defendants ultimately prevail. The effects of the \npreliminary injunction would be felt long past the conclusion of the litigation. \nSecond, the equities and the public interest also counsel against granting the Plaintiffs’ \nbroader  request  for  a  preliminary  injunction  requiring  DHH  to  create  a  “mechanism”  for \nawarding more than 32 hours of LT-PCS to class members. See id. ¶¶ 65-69. DHH set the 32-\nhour cap in order to constrain the growing costs of LT-PCS in a way that would allow the State \nto continue providing assistance to a growing population. See id. The agency has determined that \nthis cap strikes the right balance between the interests of different groups of elderly Medicaid \nbeneficiaries and individuals with disabilities, id., and that conclusion warrants respect. Cf. \nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 612 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“No State has unlimited resources, and \neach  must  make  hard  decisions  on how   much  to  allocate  to  treatment  of  diseases  and \ndisabilities.”). The funding required to comply with a preliminary injunction would need to be \ndrawn from the other programs that provide medical assistance to other beneficiaries. Third Eley \nDecl. ¶¶ 68-69. And the harm to the State’s pecuniary interests is exacerbated because the \nPlaintiffs request that the Rule 65(c) security requirement be waived. See Nichols v. Alcatel USA, \nInc., 532 F.3d 364, 379 (5th Cir. 2008) (“Since the [plaintiffs] appear unable to meet the bond \nrequirement of Rule 65(c), we hold that the damage the preliminary injunction might cause [the \ndefendant] greatly outweighs any threatened injury to the Retirees.”). \nThe Plaintiffs’ proposed injunction is all the more burdensome to the extent that it would \nrequire DHH to establish a “mechanism” for determining which recipients should receive more \nthan 32 hours. As described above, the LT-PCS program is not designed to provide a small group \nof individual recipients with an unlimited amount of personal care assistance, up to the amount \nnecessary  to  maintain  their  current  level  of  health.  Third  Eley  Decl.  ¶¶ 68-69.  DHH’s \n- 29 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 35 of 38\n\ncomprehensive plan for providing HCBS calls for an LT-PCS program that provides a limited \nbenefit to a larger population and other programs, including the CC waiver, that are more \nappropriate for those who are more dependent on others. By converting the LT-PCS program \ninto one that provides whatever amount of services someone “needs,” the preliminary injunction \nwould interfere substantially with how the State has decided to structure the package of services \nit provides. \nThe Court should therefore deny the Plaintiffs’ request for relief for the same reasons the \ncourt in M.R. v. Dreyfus, 767 F. Supp. 2d 1149, 1175 (D. Wash. 2011), declined to preliminarily \nenjoin Washington State’s reduction of its state plan personal care service: \n[E]ven  if  a  few  of  the  plaintiffs  ultimately  require \ninstitutionalization as a result of the State’s reduction in services, \nthe  Court  cannot  conclude  that  the  threat  to  these  individuals \noutweighs  the  State’s  interest  in  preserving  the  carefully \norchestrated personal care services program that currently serves \nmore than 45,000 individuals. For the same reasons, the Court \ncannot conclude that the possible threat of institutionalization for a \nfew  personal  care  service  beneficiaries  outweighs  the  State’s \ninterest in balancing the competing needs of a host of different \nstate-sponsored social service programs that currently provide aid \nto a diverse group of medically and financially disadvantaged state \nresidents. \nId. Neither the public interest nor equity warrants a different decision here.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the Plaintiffs’ motion. \n- 30 - \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 81     10/28/11   Page 36 of 38\n\nDated: October 28, 2011        Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Kimberly Humbles   \nKimberly Humbles \nLa.

RIEDLINGER \n  *   \n  DEFENDANTS  *  CLASS ACTION \n \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nThis Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement” or “Agreement”) is entered into \nbetween Plaintiffs Rickii Ainey, Kenneth Roman, and Elizabeth Foster, by her next friend Donna \nZeno (“Plaintiffs”), on behalf of themselves and a class of other similarly situated persons, and \nDefendants Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (“DHH”) and its Secretary, Bruce \nGreenstein (“Defendants”).  Plaintiffs and Defendants are referred to herein as “the Parties.” \nOn September 22, 2010, Plaintiffs filed this action in the United States District Court for \nthe Middle District of Louisiana (the “District Court”).  On June 1, 2011, Plaintiffs filed a \nComplaint in Intervention.  The Complaint in Intervention alleges that the reduction in maximum \nhours of Long-Term Personal Care Services imposed pursuant to its Emergency Rule \npromulgated in 36 La. Reg. 1752 (August 20, 2010), La. Admin. Code tit. 50, § 12915(A), \ndeprives Plaintiffs of critical services that are necessary to permit them to remain safely in their \nhomes, and that this violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (“ADA”) \nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (“Section 504”), and the \nfederal regulations implementing these statutes, by placing them at risk of unnecessary \ninstitutionalization in nursing homes.  Defendants deny these claims. \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 100-1     02/15/12   Page 2 of 27\n\nThe Parties mutually desire to resolve the claims asserted by Plaintiffs in this action \nwithout the need for further litigation, and without any admission of liability by any party.  \nAccordingly, the Parties hereby agree to compromise, settle and resolve all of the claims asserted \nby Plaintiffs in this action on the following terms and conditions:  \n1.  Definitions   \n(a)  Class: All persons who were approved to receive more than 32 hours of services through \nLouisiana’s Long-Term Personal Case Services (LT-PCS) program as of September 5, \n2010, and who are still approved to receive LT-PCS or who have a request for prior \nauthorization pending or in process.  \n(b)  Long-Term Personal Care Services (LT-PCS): the personal care services funded by \nLouisiana Medicaid and provided to eligible individuals in their homes pursuant to \nLouisiana’s Medicaid State plan and regulations at La. Admin. Code tit. 50, Part XV, \nSubpart 9.   \n(c)  Community Choice Waiver (CC Waiver): a program of home- and community-based \nservices administered by DHH’s Office of Aging and Adult Services pursuant to \n§ 1915(c) of the Social Security Act, the terms of the waiver documents filed with the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and regulations at La. Admin. Code tit. 50, \nPart XXI.   \n(d)  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS): the agency within the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human Services that administers the federal Medicaid \nprogram.   \n(e)  Expedited Waiver Offer: an offer of an opportunity to receive services under the CC \nWaiver on an expedited basis, ahead of others on the Request for Services Registry. \n   \n2 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 100-1     02/15/12   Page 3 of 27\n\n2.  Notice to class members of opportunity to obtain expedited waiver slots   \n(a)  DHH has sent one of the notices attached hereto as Attachment A to each individual who \nwas approved for more than 32 hours of LT-PCS on September 5, 2010, and has since \nbeen approved for exactly 32 hours of LT-PCS, informing them that they may request an \nexpedited waiver offer.   \n(b)  DHH will send the notice attached hereto as Attachment B to all other class members. In \norder to facilitate timely processing of requests for expedited waiver services, DHH will \nstagger the notices into three equally-sized groups. DHH will send notice to one-third of \nthese other class members by January 16, 2012 or seven days after the Court \npreliminarily approves the Settlement Agreement, whichever is later. It will send notices \nto the second group of other class members by February 13, 2012; and to the third group \nof other class members by March 9, 2012. DHH will use its best efforts to prioritize the \ngroups based on the order in which class members’ LT-PCS were reduced after \nSeptember 5, 2010. For example, class members whose LT-PCS were first reduced will \nreceive the notice first.   \n3.  Provision of expedited waiver slots   \n(a)  The class members described in ¶ 2(a) above may request an expedited waiver offer at \nany time, so long as they are approved to receive 32 hours of LT-PCS. If their hours of \nLT-PCS are reduced to below 32 prior to June 30, 2012, they will be permitted to apply \nfor an expedited waiver slot until June 30, 2012, and will be provided Attachment B.   \n(b)  The class members described in ¶ 2(b) above may request an expedited waiver \nopportunity by June 30, 2012.  If they are allocated 32 hours of LT-PCS, either through \nreassessment or through appeal, they may request an expedited waiver offer at any time \nfollowing such allocation.  \n3 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 100-1     02/15/12   Page 4 of 27\n\n(c)  Subject to the provisions of Section 4 below, DHH will accept and evaluate the requests \nreceived before June 30, 2012 of all class members described in Section 2 above who \ncontact DHH seeking an expedited waiver offer (including phone requests), and will \ngrant a request if the class member shows that, considering the totality of the \ncircumstances, he or she will have a decline in mental or physical health and is at serious \nrisk of nursing facility placement in the absence of an expedited waiver offer.  Consistent \nwith DHH’s rules and practices, the following criteria shall be considered in determining \nwhether the individual will require nursing facility placement in the absence of an \nexpedited waiver offer:   \ni.  support through other programs is either unavailable or inadequate to prevent \nnursing facility placement;   \nii.  the death or incapacitation of an informal caregiver leaves the person without \nother supports;   \niii.  the support of an informal caregiver is not available due to a family crisis;   \niv.  the person lives alone and has no access to informal support;   \nv.  or, for other reasons, the person lacks access to adequate informal support to \nprevent nursing facility placement.   \n(d)  Applicants who are offered an expedited waiver opportunity must still satisfy all criteria \nfor certification into the CC Waiver, including the medical, financial, and health and \nwelfare requirements set forth in the applicable state and federal regulations and in the \nwaiver documents filed with CMS. See 42 C.F.R. § 435.217; 42 C.F.R. § 441.302;  La. \nAdmin. Code tit. 50, Part XXI, §§ 8901, 8903.  \n4 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 100-1     02/15/12   Page 5 of 27\n\n(e)  DHH will continue apply the criteria set forth in ¶ 3(c) to all class members receiving 32 \nhours of LT-PCS who request an expedited waiver slot after June 30, 2012 but before the \nend date of the Agreement.  \n4.  Appeals   \n(a)  This agreement neither establishes a right to appeal the denial of a request for an \nexpedited waiver opportunity nor precludes any claim that such a right exists.   \n(b)  Solely for the purpose of this agreement, DHH agrees that class members described in \nSection 2 above will be permitted to appeal any denial of a request for an expedited \nwaiver slot if DHH receives the request for the expedited waiver slot by June 30, 2012.   \n(c)  DHH will notify all class members described in Section 2 whose pre-June 30, 2012 \nrequests are not granted that they may appeal this determination, by sending the notice \nattached hereto as Attachment C.   \n5.  Interim services    \n(a)  For the purposes of this agreement, DHH may in its discretion provide temporary, \ninformal accommodations to class members who have been granted an expedited waiver \nslot for the period before waiver services begin. Such accommodations may include, but \nare not limited to, providing the class member with additional hours of LT-PCS until \nwaiver services commence.   \n(b)  For the purposes of this agreement, DHH may in its discretion provide temporary, \ninformal accommodations to class members who have requested an expedited waiver \nslot. Such accommodations may include, but are not limited to, providing the class \nmember with additional hours of LT-PCS until DHH acts on the request.  \n6.  Additional CC Waiver slots   \n5 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 100-1     02/15/12   Page 6 of 27\n\n(a)  Within one week of preliminary approval of this Agreement, DHH will submit a waiver \namendment to CMS to increase the number of CC Waiver slots by 200, to a total of \n4,803. Upon CMS’s approval of the amendment, DHH will reserve these 200 slots \nexclusively for class members eligible for expedited waiver slots through December 31, \n2012, unless DHH determines, based on the number of class members applying for such \nslots, that fewer than 200 slots will be needed for class members. After December 31, \n2012, or at such time as DHH determines that fewer than 200 slots will be needed for \nclass members, DHH shall include any remaining slots in the general pool of CC Waiver \nslots to be offered to other individuals on the Request for Services Registry.   \n(b)  If the 100 slots reserved for individuals eligible for expedited waiver slots under DHH’s \nexisting regulations and the 200 slots reserved for class members pursuant to ¶ 6(a) are \ninsufficient to accommodate the number of class members granted expedited waiver \nslots, DHH will ensure that additional services are provided to class members who would \nqualify for an expedited waiver offer, either by (1) using other available slots in the CC \nWaiver; (2) adding additional expedited slots to the CC Waiver; or (3) providing \nadditional LT-PCS hours, up to a maximum of 42 hours per week, until such time as an \nexpedited slot becomes available.   \n(c)  DHH will use its best efforts to have its request for 500 additional CC Waiver slots \nincluded in the Division of Administration budget request for state fiscal year 2013. The \nAdvocacy Center and AARP will use their best efforts to support the inclusion of the \nadditional CC Waiver slots in the state budget for state fiscal year 2013.   \n7.  Attorneys’ fees and expenses  \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel agree to accept $250,000 as the full and final amount of \nall attorneys’ fees and costs for work done through the date of the final approval of this \n6 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 100-1     02/15/12   Page 7 of 27\n\nSettlement Agreement, provided that the Court enters an order requiring Defendants to pay this \namount to Plaintiffs’ counsel within ten days of the date of the Court’s final approval of the \nSettlement Agreement.  Plaintiffs’ counsel agrees that any attorneys’ fees and costs for work \nrelated to this settlement done after final approval of the Settlement Agreement are limited to \nfees and costs for work performed in successfully obtaining judicial enforcement of the \nSettlement Agreement.  The Court will not award fees and costs associated with any \nadministrative appeal of the denial of an expedited waiver slot. \n8.  Reports   \nDHH will report the following to Plaintiffs’ counsel, in both a Microsoft Excel document \nand in a .pdf document, within the time frames set forth below:   \n(a)  By February 1, 2012, the names of all class members who have already been sent notices \nattached as Attachment A, the dates that the notices were sent, and the addresses to which \nthe notices were sent.   \n(b)  Within ten days of DHH sending Attachment B to other class members (those approved \nfor less than 32 hours), the names and addresses (to which notices were sent) of these \nclass members. \n(c)  At the end of each month, the names of the class members for whom notices were \nreturned as undeliverable.   \n(d)  By the 15th of every month, beginning March 15, 2012, and ending at the settlement \nending date, the following data from the previous calendar month: the number of class \nmembers who requested expedited waiver slots, the number of class members granted \ninterim services, the number of requests for expedited waiver slots from class members \nthat were granted, the number of requests for expedited waiver slots from class members \nthat were denied, the number of requests for expedited waiver slots from class members \n7 \nCase 3:10-cv-00635-JJB -SCR   Document 100-1     02/15/12   Page 8 of 27\n\npending as of the last day of the previous calendar month, the number of appeals from \nclass members of denials of requests for expedited waiver slots, and the number of those \nappeals that were granted, the number that were denied, and the number that were \notherwise resolved.  These monthly reports will also include the names of all class \nmembers whose requests for expedited waiver slots were granted or denied during the \nprevious calendar month.   \n(e)  By February 29, 2012, the most recent information available as to the telephone numbers \nof class members and their other contacts, as an update to information that was provided \nto Plaintiffs’ counsel in the document entitled “Master Spreadsheet-Interrogatory 2 \n(CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER).xls” on or \nabout July 11, 2011.  \n9.

Defendants do not necessarily agree that any of these individuals \nmeet the standards set forth in ¶ 3(c) for granting an expedited waiver offer.    \n10.
