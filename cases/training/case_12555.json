The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court to declare that the California Family Code and the Defense of Marriage Act were unconstitutional.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs brought suit after they were denied a marriage license by the County Clerk of Orange County on two separate occasions because they were both men. The plaintiffs claimed that by not issuing them an application for a marriage license pursuant to California Code the County had violated their rights under the Due Process, Equal Protection, and Full Faith and Credit Clauses of the United States Constitution. The plaintiffs also challenged the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).</p>\r\n<p>On June 16, 2005, the Court (Judge Gary L. Taylor) issued a ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment. 374 F.Supp.2d 861. First, the Court held that it was proper for the District Court to abstain from judgment on the constitutionality of state law here, as a set of consolidated cases was pending before California state court on this issue <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=10898\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(In re Marriage Cases).</a> Second, the Court held that Section 3 of DOMA (defining marriage as opposite-sex for Federal purposes) was constitutional and also denied plaintiffs standing to challenge Section 2 of DOMA (preventing states from recognizing same-sex marriages authorized in other states).</p>\r\n<p>On May 5, 20016, following an appeal by plaintiffs, the Ninth Circuit, in an opinion written by Judge Ferdinand Fernandez, denied the district court's finding that it was proper to abstain from deciding the constitutionality of state law. 447 F.3d 673. The Ninth Circuit also upheld Judge Taylor's determination that plaintiffs lacked standing regarding Section 2 of DOMA, the state-recognition provision. However, the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court regarding Section 3 of DOMA, the definitional provision; the appeals court instead held that plaintiffs did not have a particularized injury, and therefore lacked constitutional standing to challenge this provision as well.</p>\r\n<p>On August 29, 2008, the District Court (Judge David O. Carter) issued an order dismissing the case pursuant to the Ninth Circuit Order. The plaintiffs later brought a related suit against the United States in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Smelt v. United States </a> in 2008.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Taylor: 1) the\n18\ndecision to abstain from considering the constitutionality of California state laws regarding\n19\nmarriage; and 2) the decision to dismiss their claims challenging the Constitutionality of the\n20\nDOMA.  The latter ruling was based on Plaintiffs’ lack of standing to challenge DOMA § 2 and\n21\nthe merits of their DOMA § 3 claim.  \n22\nThe Ninth Circuit upheld the District Court’s decisions on the state law issues and\n23\nDOMA § 2 but vacated the decision on DOMA § 3 and ruled as follows:\n24\n“[W]e affirm the district court’s decision to abstain until the Marriage Cases are resolved,\n25\nand the district court’s decision to dismiss as to the DOMA Section 2 claim.  However, we\n26\nvacate its decision regarding the merits of the DOMA Section 3 claim and remand with\n27\ndirections to dismiss that claim.\n28\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01042-DOC -MLG   Document 152    Filed 08/29/08   Page 2 of 2   Page ID #:149\n1 The case was assigned to this Court on remand.\n2 After the Ninth Circuit so ruled, the California Supreme Court handed down In re\n3 Marriage Cases, 43 Cal. 4th 757 (2008), which struck down the California state statutes\n4 prohibiting same-sex marriage.  Plaintiffs’ were subsequently married.  Although this decision of\n5 the California Supreme Court and Plaintiffs’ decision to marry is of utmost significance, it does\n6 not change the legal landscape.  The Ninth Circuit’s decision is binding on this Court.\n7 With regard to the challenges of California state-law, the California Supreme Court\n8 resolved these challenges based on the state Constitution.  Thus, there is no need to resolve the\n9 Federal Constitutional issues, absent some subsequent change in law.  Accordingly, this claim is\n10 hereby DISMISSED.\n11 With regard to the DOMA § 2 Claim, Plaintiffs argue that they now have standing\n12 because they are legally married.  Judge Taylor’s decision, and that of the Ninth Circuit, were\n13 explicitly based on the fact that Plaintiffs lacked standing because they were unmarried. \n14 Standing is ordinarily assessed when Plaintiffs file suit.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.\n15 555, 569 n.4, 112 S. Ct. 2130 (Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U.S. 826, 830, 109\n16 S.Ct. 2218 (1989)).  Accordingly, this claim is hereby DISMISSED.\n17 Finally, the Ninth Circuit specifically directed the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs’ DOMA § 3\n18 claim.  Accordingly, this claim is hereby DISMISSED.  \n19 Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ DOMA claims are hereby DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n20 and Plaintiffs’ state law claims are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.  \n21 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n22 DATED:  August 29, 2008\n23\n24 _______________________________\nDAVID O.

The  Court  finds  it  is  a  against Plaintiffs on the constitutionality of the federal \nlegitimate  interest  to  encourage  the  stability  and  Defense  of  Marriage  Act.25  The  matter  of  the \nconstitutionality  of  the  California  state  statutes  is \nlegitimacy  of  what  may  reasonably  be  viewed  as  the \nSTAYED.26 This stay is immediately appealable.27 \noptimal union for procreating and rearing children by both \n  \nbiological parents. \n   \t\r  \nBecause  procreation  is  necessary  to  perpetuate \nhumankind,  encouraging  the  optimal  union  for \n Footnotes \n1  “Marriage is a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between a man and a woman, to which the consent of the parties \ncapable of making that contract is necessary. Consent alone does not constitute marriage. Consent must be followed by the \nissuance of a license and solemnization as authorized by this division, except as provided by Section 425 and Part 4 (commencing \nwith Section 500).” Cal. Fam.Code § 300 (West 2004). \n \n \n\n \n \n2  “An unmarried male of the age of 18 years or older, and an unmarried female of the age of 18 years or older, and not otherwise \ndisqualified, are capable of consenting to and consummating marriage.” Cal. Fam.Code § 301 (West 2004). \n \n3  “Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.” Cal. Fam.Code § 308.5 (West 2004). \n \n4  Defense of Marriage Act, 1 U.S.C. § 7 (2005), 28 U.S.C. § 1738C (Supp.2005). \n \n5  “No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or \njudicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that \nis treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such \nrelationship.” 28 U.S.C. § 1738C (Supp.2005). \n \n6  “In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative \nbureaus and agencies of the United States, the word ‘marriage’ means only a legal union between one man and one woman as \nhusband and wife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.” 1 U.S.C. § 7 \n(2005). \n \n7  The Court received amicus curiae briefs from the City and County of San Francisco and the plaintiffs in Woo v. Lockyer, one of the \ncases consolidated into the coordinated proceeding in California state court, Coordination Proceeding, Special Title [Rule 1550(c) \n], Marriage Cases, Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding No. 4365, slip op. (Cal.Super.Ct. Apr. 13, 2005) (tentative decision \nat 2005 WL 583129 (Cal.Super. Mar. 14, 2005)) [hereinafter Marriage Cases ]. The Court’s editorial coordinator was Erin Smith. \n \n8  The trial court decision in the Marriage Cases held only Family Code sections 300 and 308.5 are unconstitutional under the state \nconstitution. Marriage Cases, slip op. at *1-2, 2005 WL 583129, at *1. It appears the court interpreted section 301 as designating \nthe minimum age to get married, but not as prohibiting same-sex marriages. Marriage Cases, slip op. at *11, 2005 WL 583129, at \n*5 (stating the perceived ambiguity in the language of section 301 as to whether it prohibits same-sex marriages led to the passage \nof section 300). The court apparently did not find section 301 raised any constitutional issues. \n \n9  A dismissal or stay pursuant to Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 \nL.Ed.2d 483 (1976), would not apply here. Colorado River applies when there is parallel litigation in a federal and state court. \nMoses H. Cone Mem’l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 28, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983) (“When a district \ncourt decides to dismiss or stay under Colorado River, it presumably concludes that the parallel state-court litigation will be an \nadequate vehicle for the complete and prompt resolution of the issues between the parties. If there is any substantial doubt as to \nthis, it would be a serious abuse of discretion to grant the stay or dismissal at all.”). Federal and state cases are parallel if they are \n“substantially similar.” Nakash v. Marciano, 882 F.2d 1411, 1416 (9th Cir.1989) (citations omitted). \nThis case and the California state court Marriage Cases are not substantially similar. The cases involve different parties. Although \nboth cases challenge the same state statutes, this case challenges them under the U.S. Constitution, while the Marriage Cases \nchallenge them under the California state constitution. The Marriage Cases will not decide the federal constitutional issues raised \nin this case. \n \n10  The recent Nebraska federal case Citizens for Equal Protection, Inc. v. Bruning is not to the contrary. 368 F.Supp.2d 980, 984-85 \n(D.Neb.2005). There, the court found a state constitutional provision much broader than the statutes in this case violated the First \nAmendment’s protections of free association and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. Id. at 989-998. The \nstate constitutional provision in Bruning prohibited same-sex marriages as well as same-sex civil unions, domestic partnerships, \nand other similar same-sex relationships. Id. at 984-85. The breadth of the constitutional provision was significant in the court’s \nanalysis. Id. at 995 (“The amendment goes far beyond merely defining marriage as between a man and a woman.”). The California \nstatutes in this case are limited to marriage, and other state provisions permit domestic partnerships. Cal. Fam.Code §§ 297-299.6 \n(West 2004 & Supp.2005). Bruning’s holding is not applicable here. \nBut see David B. Cruz, “Just Don’t Call It Marriage”: The First Amendment and Marriage as an Expressive Resource, 74 S. Cal. \nL.Rev.  925  (2001)  (arguing  denying  same-sex  couples  access  to  the  expressive  resource  of  marriage  violates  the  First \nAmendment’s proscriptions against viewpoint-and content-based discrimination). \n \n11  “All people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and \nliberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy.” Cal. Const. art \nI, § 1. \n \n12  Compare Cal. Const. art. I, § 7(a) (“A person may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law or denied \nequal protection of the laws ....”), with U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 (“No state shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or \nproperty, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”), and U.S. \nConst. amend. V (“No person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law ....”). \n \n13  For example, although it is not clearly established whether sexual orientation is a suspect classification entitled to heightened \n \n\n \n \nscrutiny under California equal protection doctrine, at least one state court has suggested it is. See Children’s Hosp. & Med. Ctr. v. \nBonta, 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 118 Cal.Rptr.2d 629, 650 (2002) (identifying sexual orientation as an example of a suspect \nclassification for purposes of equal protection analysis). Under federal law, it is clear sexual orientation is not a suspect or quasi-\nsuspect class, and federal equal protection jurisprudence subjects sexual orientation classifications to rational basis review. Romer \nv. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632-33, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996) (applying rational basis review to state law creating \nsexual orientation classification). In California, sex-based classifications receive strict scrutiny. Catholic Charities of Sacramento, \nInc. v. Superior Court, 32 Cal.4th 527, 564, 10 Cal.Rptr.3d 283, 85 P.3d 67 (2004) (“[D]iscrimination based on gender violates the \nequal protection clause of the California Constitution (art. I, § 7(a)) and triggers the highest level of scrutiny.”). Under federal law, \nsex-based classifications are subject to intermediate scrutiny. E.g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197, 97 S.Ct. 451, 50 L.Ed.2d \n397 (1976) ( “[C]lassifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to \nachievement of those objectives.”). \n \n14  For example, domestic partnerships do not receive the same state tax benefits as marriages. Cal. Fam.Code § 297.5(g); see also \nKnight, 26 Cal.Rptr.3d at 699-700 (listing statutory and other differences between domestic partnerships and marriages in \nCalifornia). \n \n15  At present, Massachusetts is the only state that gives marriage licenses to same-sex couples. \n \n16  A previous decision in this District supports the position Plaintiffs have standing to challenge section 3. In Adams v. Howerton, \ntwo male plaintiffs received a marriage license and completed a marriage ceremony in Colorado. 486 F.Supp. 1119, 1120 \n(C.D.Cal.1980). The court held, under both Colorado and federal law, plaintiffs were not married. Id. at 1123-24. The court went \non to consider whether this definition of marriage as between a man and a woman violated federal constitutional principles of equal \nprotection and due process. Id. at 1124-25. The court did not discuss whether plaintiffs, as non-married individuals, had standing to \nraise the constitutional challenge. Either the court concluded plaintiffs had standing or it did not consider the issue, but in either \ncase the court reached the merits of the constitutional challenge. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, but not on the constitutional grounds. \nAdams v. Howerton, 673 F.2d 1036, 1038-39, 1039 n. 2 (9th Cir.1982). It also did not address plaintiffs’ standing. \nAlso, an Oregon state court in an unpublished opinion held same-sex couples without marriage licenses had standing to challenge \nstate laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples under the state constitution. Li v. State, No. 0403-03057, 2004 WL 1258167, \nat *2-3 (Or.Cir.Ct. Apr. 20, 2004), rev’d on other grounds by 338 Or. 376, 110 P.3d 91 (2005) (en banc). Under Oregon’s standing \nrules, plaintiffs had to show the court’s decision would have a practical effect on them. Id. at *2. The court held its decision would \nhave a practical effect and allowed plaintiffs to bring their constitutional challenge. Id. at *3. Oregon’s practical effect requirement \nappears to be similar to federal standing rules requiring an injury in fact, causation, and redressability. \n \n17  Until 1988, the Supreme Court had mandatory appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1257(2) (repealed 1988). \n \n18  The Court disagrees with Wilson v. Ake’s finding a constitutional challenge to DOMA presents the “same issues” as Baker v. \nNelson. 354 F.Supp.2d 1298, 1304-05 (M.D.Fla.2005). Wilson did not explain what issues it found to be the same. \n \n19  This view is not inconsistent with Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d \n526 (1989). That case held it was improper for a lower court to refuse to follow a Supreme Court opinion because it believed later \nSupreme Court decisions reduced its reasoning to “obsolescense.” Id. at 479, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917. It stated lower courts are not \nfree to disregard Supreme Court opinions due to doctrinal developments unless the Supreme Court has overruled them. Id. at 484, \n109 S.Ct. 1917. However, the case considered the binding effect of full opinions of the Supreme Court, not a dismissal for want of \nsubstantial federal question. \nThe Supreme Court has stated summary dismissals “do not ... have the same precedential value ... as does an opinion of this Court \nafter briefing and oral argument on the merits.” Confederated Bands & Tribes, 439 U.S. at 476 n. 20, 99 S.Ct. 740. In contrast to \nfull opinions of the Supreme Court, the Court also has stated doctrinal developments may show a summary dismissal is no longer \nbinding. Hicks, 422 U.S. at 344, 95 S.Ct. 2281. Rodriguez de Quijas is not analogous to this case. Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, \n117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997), is not applicable here for the same reason. \n \n20  This finding is apparently consistent with all previous decisions on the constitutionality of DOMA or state laws prohibiting same-\nsex marriage. At least one other court explicitly found a sexual orientation classification. Li, 2004 WL 1258167, at *7 (finding, \nunder Oregon law, there was a classification because of the law’s discriminatory effect on homosexuals); Baker v. State, 170 Vt. \n194, 744 A.2d 864, 890 (1999) (Dooley, J., concurring) (“The marriage statutes do not facially discriminate on the basis of sexual \norientation. There is, however, no doubt that the requirement that civil marriage be a union of one man and one woman has the \neffect of discriminating against lesbian and gay couples ... who are unable to marry the life partners of their choice.”). Other courts \napparently implicitly found such a classification because they proceeded to rational basis review. See, e.g., Wilson, 354 F.Supp.2d \nat 1308; In re Kandu, 315 B.R. at 141. No court has declined to conduct rational basis review altogether on the ground that there is \nno sexual orientation classification. \n \n21  Some state courts have defined the right protected by their state constitutions as the fundamental right to marry the person of one’s \nchoice. See, e.g., Brause, 1998 WL 88743, at *1 (“The court finds that marriage, i.e., the recognition of one’s choice of a life \n \n\n \n \npartner, is a fundamental right.”); Perez v. Sharp, 32 Cal.2d 711, 198 P.2d 17, 19 (1948) (“[T]he right to marry is the right to join \nin marriage with the person of one’s choice ....”); Marriage Cases, slip op. at *21, 2005 WL 583129, at *11 (“Family Code \nsections 300 and 308.5 implicate the basic human right to marry a person of one’s choice.”); Goodridge v. Dep’t of Pub. Health, \n440 Mass. 309, 798 N.E.2d 941, 958 (2003) (“[T]he right to marry means little if it does not include the right to marry the person \nof one’s choice, subject to appropriate government restrictions in the interests of public health, safety, and welfare.”); Hernandez, \n794 N.Y.S.2d at 596 (“[T]he right to choose one’s life partner is fundamental to the right of privacy ....”). \n \n22  The Court does not engage in the “circular reasoning” feared by some courts. See, e.g., Goodridge, 798 N.E.2d at 961 n. 23 (“[I]t is \ncircular reasoning, not analysis, to maintain that marriage must remain a heterosexual institution because that is what it historically \nhas been.”). The Court does not here hold marriage must remain a heterosexual institution. The Court holds that, for defining the \nfundamental right, marriage historically has been a heterosexual institution. \n \n23  Plaintiffs also separately challenge DOMA under the “right to privacy” recognized in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 \nS.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965). The “right to privacy” is not an independent right. It is “implicit in the ... Due Process Clause.” \nZablocki, 434 U.S. at 384, 98 S.Ct. 673. Having decided to review Plaintiffs’ due process claim, there is no separate claim to be \ndecided. \n \n24  Plaintiffs assert, and Defendants do not contest, federal law bestows over 1,000 rights and responsibilities on opposite-sex married \ncouples. \n \n25  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), the Court directs the entry of final judgment as to this claim and finds there is \nno just reason for delay. \n \n26  A stay, rather than dismissal, is appropriate. Almodovar, 832 F.2d at 1141. \n \n27  28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) (1993); Porter, 319 F.3d at 489. \n \n \n\t\r  \n \t\r  \n \n ",

California does not use the phrase “legal \nrequirement  that  they  show  some  actual  or  imminent  union”;  it  merely  gives  registered  domestic  partners \ninjury as opposed to a mere conjectural or hypothetical  certain  legal  rights  and  obligations.32  And,  those  are \none.  certainly  not  the  only  legal  relationships  or  unions \n  \npossible if, indeed, we are going to move beyond the \nNo  state  has  determined  that  Smelt  and  Hammer  are \nkinds  that  have  historically  defined  a  marriage.

See Cal. Fam.Code § 299 (2004). \n \n5  Several other parties and amici have since become involved. The United States intervened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2403 to defend \nthe constitutionality of DOMA. The district court permitted Campaign for California Families (CCF) and Proposition 22 Legal \nDefense and Education Fund (Prop 22 Fund) to intervene. CCF argues that DOMA and the state statutes limiting marriage to \nopposite-sex couples are constitutional. Prop 22 Fund argues to this court that DOMA is constitutional. Equality California (an \norganization that represents lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered Californians) moved to intervene in this appeal. Equality \nCalifornia’s request was denied by a motions panel, and its opening brief was filed as an amicus brief. It argues that we should not \nreach the merits of the claims. Finally, the National Legal Foundation filed an amicus brief in this court, urging affirmance on the \nmerits of the DOMA challenges. \n \n6  Cal. Fam.Code § 300 reads as follows, in pertinent part: “Marriage is a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between a \nman and a woman, to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary. Consent alone does not \nconstitute marriage. Consent must be followed by the issuance of a license and solemnization....” \n \n7  Cal. Fam.Code § 301 reads as follows: “An unmarried male of the age of 18 years or older, and an unmarried female of the age of \n18 years or older, and not otherwise disqualified, are capable of consenting to and consummating marriage.” \n \n8  Cal. Fam.Code § 308.5 reads as follows: “Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.” \n \n9  “Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And \nthe Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the \nEffect thereof.” U.S. Const. art. IV, § 1. \n \n10  “No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or \njudicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that \nis treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such \nrelationship.” 28 U.S.C. § 1738C. \n \n11  “In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative \nbureaus and agencies of the United States, the word ‘marriage’ means only a legal union between one man and one woman as \nhusband and wife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.” 1 U.S.C. § 7. \n \n12  In re Coordinated Proceeding, Special Title [Rule 1550(c) ], Marriage Cases, No. 4365, 2005 WL 583129 (Cal.Super.Ct.

The cases \n \n\n \nwere fully briefed as of January 25, 2006, and no date for argument has been set. \n \n13  The district court anticipated that the Marriage Cases would ultimately reach and be decided by the California Supreme Court.

See, e.g., 2 Samuel Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (London, \nW. Strahan et. al. 1755) (Marriage is: “The act of uniting a man and woman for life.” To marry is: “To join a man and woman.”); \nNoah Webster, A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language 185 (1806) (Marriage is: “the act of joining man and \nwoman.”); Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1384 (3d ed. 1986) (Marriage is: “the state of being united to a person of \nthe opposite sex as husband or wife.”); Black’s Law Dictionary 972 (6th ed. 1990) (Marriage is: “Legal union of one man and one \nwoman as husband and wife.”); The Compact Oxford English Dictionary 1039 (2d ed. 1994) (Marriage is: “The condition of being \na husband or wife....”). \n \n19  Cal. Fam.Code §§ 301, 302. \n \n20  Cal. Fam.Code §§ 301, 2201. \n \n21  Cal. Fam.Code § 2200. \n \n22  We do not overlook Smelt and Hammer’s claim that this case touches on First Amendment issues, which should dissuade us from \nabstention. See Ripplinger, 868 F.2d at 1048. But it is difficult, or impossible, to see a true speech problem here, which is what \nRipplinger was concerned with. All that is involved here is the failure to issue a marriage license. In all events, state litigation on \nthe issues is already well underway. See Almodovar, 832 F.2d at 1141; see also Askew v. Hargrave, 401 U.S. 476, 477-78, 91 S.Ct. \n856, 857-58, 28 L.Ed.2d 196 (1971) (per curiam). \n \n23  The Court has decided that a county clerk and county recorder could not disobey state statutes about marriage based on their \npersonal opinions about the constitutionality of those statutes. See Lockyer v. City & County of S.F., 33 Cal.4th 1055, 1119-20, 95 \nP.3d 459, 498-99, 17 Cal.Rptr.3d 255, 272-74 (2004). However, the Court did not decide the question of whether the state laws on \nmarriage were constitutional. Id. at 1125, 95 P.3d at 502, 17 Cal.Rptr.3d at 277 (Moreno, J., concurring). \n \n24  For example, California’s constitutional law on privacy is different from federal law on that subject. See Am. Acad. of Pediatrics v. \nLungren, 16 Cal.4th 307, 326, 940 P.2d 797, 808, 66 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 221 (1997). \n \n25  See DOMA Section 2 (28 U.S.C. § 1738C) and DOMA Section 3(1 U.S.C. § 7). \n \n26  Even if Smelt and Hammer were now in a California registered domestic partnership, that is not by any means a marriage. See \nKnight v. Superior Court, 128 Cal.App.4th 14, 30, 26 Cal.Rptr.3d 687, 699 (2005); cf. Cal. Fam.Code § 297.5(k) (stating that the \nsection does not modify any federal benefits or protections). \n \n27  See Goodridge v. Dep’t of Pub. Health, 440 Mass. 309, 798 N.E.2d 941, 968 (2003); see also Cote-Whitacre v. Dep’t of Pub. \nHealth, 446 Mass. 350, 844 N.E.2d 623, 635 (2006) (Spina, J., concurring). \n \n28  See Smelt I, 374 F.Supp.2d at 870-71. \n \n29  See id. at 871. \n \n30  As we noted in footnote 18 with respect to the similar California statutes, that definition is not extraordinary; it is traditional. \n \n31  See Cal. Fam.Code § 297.5. \n \n32  Id. \n \n33  If it were, as we pointed out in footnote 4, that legal relationship has been dissolved under California law. If it conferred standing at \nfirst, it no longer can. See Elk Grove, 542 U.S. at 11-13, 124 S.Ct. at 2308-09. \n \n\n \n \n34  We recognize that Congress did already address the definition of marriage in DOMA, but Smelt and Hammer’s generalized attack \nremains a fit topic for that body rather than the courts. For example, legislation about same-sex couples is currently pending in \nCongress. See Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act, H.R. 3267, 109th Cong. (2005); Family and Medical Leave \nInclusion Act, H.R. 475, 109th Cong. (2005); Marriage Protection Amendment, S.J. Res. 1, 109th Cong. (2005). \n \n35  It seems that Smelt and Hammer would leave us to fossick in over a thousand statutory provisions to find those that may apply to \nthem at this time should they seek benefits. \n \n36  That could be a polygamist, a polyandrist, one or both of two roommates or friends (perhaps loving friends), any member of a \ngroup of two or more people, a member of a partnership, a corporation, and-as the latter suggests-even a single person. \n \n37  Supra note 36. \n \n \n\t\r  \n \t\r  \n  \n ",
