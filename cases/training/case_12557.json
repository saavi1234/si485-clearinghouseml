    "summary": "<p>On December 29, 2008, two men married in the state of California, filed suit against the United States, the State of California, and 'Does 1 through 1,000' alleging violations by the Federal Defense of Marriage Act (\"DOMA\", 1 U.S.C. §7) of the Full Faith and Credit, Equal Protection, and Due Process clauses to the Constitution, as well as the rights to Privacy, Speech, Travel, and the Ninth Amendment to the Constitution.  The case was originally filed in Superior Court of California for the County of Orange and removed to the US District Court for the Central District of California, Southern Division. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, alleged that DOMA discriminated along lines of gender and sexual orientation by prohibiting any requirement that any state recognize same sex marriages conducted in another state, and in turn permitting the limitation of federal benefits tied to marital status that are due those couples on such grounds. Plaintiffs also complained that the California state constitutional prohibition of same-sex marriage (\"Proposition 8\") violated the same set of rights as DOMA. These allegations had been brought twice before by the couple, but were dismissed or withdrawn for jurisdictional and technical reasons.</p><p>The portion of the case pursuing California law was dismissed as moot on July 25, 2009, since plaintiffs were already and continued to be legally married in the state of California. The Court, Judge David O. Carter, ultimately dismissed the portion of the case concerning DOMA on technical grounds on August 24, 2009, citing improper initial filing in state court (despite removal to proper federal court). The case is notable for the two different stances taken by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") during briefing. The DOJ initially defended the law substantively in briefing filed June 11, 2009, citing public policy considerations to validate DOMA's diminishment of the legal status of same-sex marriages in states where they are prohibited by law, and consequent limitation on the federal benefit rights afforded such couples whose marriages are not legal in all states. In later briefing filed on August 17, 2009, the DOJ withdrew support for the law, stating that it should be \"repealed as a matter of policy\" due to its \"discriminatory\" nature, but continued to defend it on the presumption of constitutionality afforded acts of Congress and its practice of defending federal statutes as long as reasonable arguments can be made in support of their constitutionality. This was an intermediate step towards the DOJ's later position that DOMA is unconstitutional.</p>",

    "summary_short": "Two married men in California brought suit alleging that DOMA and Proposition 8 violated their Equal Protection and Due Process Rights. The case, dismissed for jurisdictional reasons and withdrawn previously, was dismissed again because of improper filing. Smelt is significant because the DOJ began briefing by defending DOMA on substantive grounds, but changed its argument during defense of its dispositive summary judgment motion, stating that the law was \"discriminatory\" in nature and should be \"repealed as a matter of policy.\"",

The  grounds  for  removal  are  as  follows: \n4  1.  On  December  29,  2008,  plaintiffs  filed  an  action  against \n5  the  United  States  of  America,  the  State  of  California,  and  Does  1 \n6  through  1,000  in  Orange  County  Superior  Court  seeking,  among  other \n7  things,  an  order  that  the  federal  Defense  of  Marriage  Act,  1  U.S.C. \n8  §  7,  28  U.S.C.  §  1738C,  violates  the  United  States  Constitution. \n9  A  copy  of  the  Complaint  is Attachment  1  hereto. \n10  2.  This  action  includes  a  claim  against  the  United  States, \n11  such  that  removal  is  proper  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1442(a) (1).  The  case \n12  also  involves  a  question  of  federal  constitutional  law,  such  that \n13  original  jurisdiction  lies  in  this  Court  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1331 \n14  (civil  actions  arising  under  the  Constitution,  law,  or  treaties  of \n15  the  United  States).  The  defenses  available  to  the  United  States  in \n16  this  action  include  the  federal  defense  of  sovereign  immunity. \n17  3.  This  Notice  of  Removal  is  timely  filed  because  the  United \n18  States  was  never  served  in  the  State  court  action.  See  Murphy \n19  Bros.,  Inc.,  v.  Michetti  Pipe  Stringing,  Inc.,  526  U.S.  344,  347-48 \n20  (1999)  (\"An  individual  or  entity named  as  a  defendant  is  not \n21  obliged  to  engage  in  litigation unless  notified  of  the  action,  and \n22  brought  under  a  court's  authority,  by  formal  process.\")  (emphasis \n23  added).  Although  a  proof  of  service  was  filed  in  State  court \n24  purporting  to  reflect  service  on  the  \"Attorney  General  Office\"  at \n25  the  address  of  the  Office  of  the  United  States  Attorney  in  Santa \n26  Ana,  California,  that  Office  has  no  record  of  ever  having  received \n27  the  subject  Complaint.

Counsel  for  the  United \n3  States  first  received  a  copy  of  the  subject  Complaint  on  March  3, \n4  2009,  by  contacting  the  Orange  County  Superior  Court. \n5  4.  A  copy  of  this  Notice  will  be  filed  promptly  with  the \n6  Clerk  of  the  Orange  County  Superior  Court.  That  filing  will  auto-\n7  matically effect  the  removal  of  the  subject  action  to  this  Court, \n8  in  its entirety,  for  future  proceedings  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C. \n9  §  1446(d).  See  Ely  Valley  Mines,  Inc.  v.  Hartford Accident  & \n10  Indem.

Jurisdiction is proper in the California State Superior Court because \n21  the State of California is a defendant and the Constitution of the State of California is \n2 2  at issue.  Original federal question jurisdiction of this Court is proper pmsuant to \n28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.  Jurisdiction for declaratory and injunctive relief is \n23 \n24  proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and Rule 65 Fed. R. Civ. Proc. \n25  \\\\\\ \n26  \\\\\\ \n27  \\\\\\ \n28  \\\\\\ \nSMELT/HAMMER vs.  UNITED STATES,  ~T AL  1  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 8:09-cv-00286-DOC-MLG   Document 1    Filed 03/09/09   Page 6 of 15   Page ID #:6\n. \n. \n1  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n2  2.  Plaintiffs are a same-sex couple who married lawfully within the State \n3  of California on or subsequent to July 10, 2008.  A true and correct copy of the \n4  License and Certificate of Marriage is attached hereto and incorporated herein as \ns  Exhibit \"A''. \n6  3.  The refusal of all states and jurisdictions of the United States of \n7  America to recognize the validity of Plaintiffs' lawful marriage results in the denial \n8  of hundreds of state law rights, benefits and responsibilities, and more than a \nthousand federa) rights, benefits, and responsibilities, that are automatically \n9 \n1 o  bestowed upon opposite-gender couples who marry in every state or jurisdiction of \n11  the United States of America that refuses to recognize the validity ofPlaintiffs' \n12  lawful marriage. \n13  4.  Some of these automatic rights, benefits and responsibilities are:  The \n14  right to social security survivor benefits;  decision-making authority for funeral \n15  arrangements and disposition of the body; the right to bereavement leave in the event \n16  of a partner's death; the preswnption that both spouses are the legal parents of a child \n17  born during marriage; and, the right to community property,  and a share of separate \n1 a  property,  upon the death of a partner who dies intestate. \n19  5.  Denial of the recognition of Plaintiffs' lawful marriage has caused \n20  Plaintiffs to suffer severe emotional distress, humiliation, mental anguish. a loss of \n21  liberty and the pursuit of happiness, a denial of equal protection of the laws, a denial \n22  of due process oflaw,  a denial of the exercise of freedom of speech, a denial of \nfreedom of association,  a denial of privacy rights, and a denial of the right to travel \n2 3 \n24  to establish residency anywhere in the United States with full recognition of the \nlegality of Plaintiffs' marriage. \n2 5 \n2 6  6.  The Federal Defmition of Marriage Act (1 U.S.C. § 7) is gender-\nspecific, defining marriage as between one man and one woman at the exclusion of \n2 7 \nsame-gender couples and is, therefore,  unconstitutional. \n2 8 \nSMELT/HAMMER vs.  UNITED STATES,  ET AL  COMPLAINT \n2 \n\nCase 8:09-cv-00286-DOC-MLG   Document 1    Filed 03/09/09   Page 7 of 15   Page ID #:7\n'  ' \n1  7.  Federal law provides that States do not have to recognize or give effect \n2  to legal relationships of same-gender couples that are treated as a marriage under the \n3  laws of another state (28 U.S.C. § 1738c), and,  therefore, restricting same-gender \n4  couples' rights to specific jurisdictions, in contrast to opposite-sex couples, is \n5  unconstitutional. \n8.  In this lawsuit, Plaintiffs ask for a pennanent injunction compelling the \n6 \n7  Defendants to take all necessary acts to require the entire nation of the United States \n8  of America, all of its territories and jurisdictions, to eliminate any distinction in the \n9  law that prejudices the rights of Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs further seek declaratory \n10  judgment establishing any law that restricts Plaintiffs' rights or distinguishes \n11  Plaintiffs' rights in any way from any opposite gender married couple to be \n12  unconstitutional, Wlder the United States Constitution, including all provisions of the \n13  Federal Defense of Marriage Act. 1 U.S.C. § 7 and its sub-parts \n14  PARTIES \n15  9.  Plaintiffs are Arthur Bruno Smelt and Christopher David Hammer. \n16  Plaintiffs  have been in a committed relationship since January 1, 1997. Plaintiffs \n17  have exchanged wedding rings and participated in a marriage ceremony in 1997 as a \n18  demonstration of their love and affection for one another, their desire to be married \n19  spouses, and a family unit forever.  As a further demonstration of Plaintiffs' love and \n20  affection for one another, Plaintiffs applied for and received a Declaration of \n21  Domestic Partnership from the State of California dated January I 0, 2000.  Plaintiffs \n2 2  reside in Orange County, California. \n2 3  10.  Defendant is the United States of America.  Defendant refuses to give \n24  legal recognition to Plaintiffs' marriage license solely based on gender.  Plaintiffs are \na same-sex couple who married lawfully within the State of California on or \n25 \n2 6  subsequent to July 10, 2008.

After reviewing the moving papers, hearing oral argument, and for the reasons set forth\nbelow, the Court hereby GRANTS the Motion.\nI. BACKGROUND\nOn December 29, 2008, Plaintiffs Arthur Bruno Smelt and Christopher David Hammer\n(“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant case in California Superior Court.  The case was removed to this Court on\nMarch 9, 2009.  The Plaintiffs in this case are a same-sex couple who received a Declaration of\nDomestic Partnership from the State of California on January 10, 2000 and were subsequently married\nunder the laws of California, “on or subsequent to July 10, 2008\" – i.e., before Proposition 8 was passed\nin California’s November 4, 2008 election.  Plaintiffs allege that “the refusal of all states and\njurisdictions” to recognize the validity of their marriage results in the denial to them of numerous rights,\nbenefits and responsibilities bestowed on all other married couples, so long as they are opposite-sex\ncouples.  Plaintiffs state that the rights, benefits and responsibilities that they are denied include the\nMINUTES FORM 11 DOC Initials of Deputy Clerk _kh_\nCIVIL - GEN Page 1 of 4\n\nCase 8:09-cv-00286-DOC-MLG   Document 36    Filed 07/15/09   Page 2 of 4   Page ID #:211\nright to social security survivor benefits, decision-making authority for funeral arrangements and the\ndisposition of a spouse’s body, the right to bereavement leave in the even to of a spouse’s death, the\npresumption that both spouses are the parent of a child born during marriage, and the right to a certain\ndivision of their spouse’s separate property and the couple’s marital property upon the death of a spouse\nwho dies intestate.  Plaintiffs further argue that the denial of such rights, benefits and responsibilities\nhas caused them to suffer severe emotional distress, mental anguish, humiliation, loss of liberty and the\npursuit of happiness, denial of equal protection of laws, denial of freedom of association, denial of\nprivacy rights, and denial of the right to travel to establish residency anywhere in the United States with\nthe full recognition of the legality of Plaintiffs’ marriage.\nPlaintiffs target their action at the federal Defense of Marriage Act, 1 U.S.C. §7; 28\nU.S.C. §1738C (the “DOMA”), as well as “Proposition 8\".  Proposition 8 was a provision on the\nCalifornia state ballot in the November 4, 2008 election that amended the California Constitution to\ndefine marriage as between a man and a woman only.   Plaintiffs assert that this amendment violates\nseveral portions of the U.S. Constitution.\nPlaintiffs seek broad relief.  Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction compelling the United\nStates and the State of California (“Defendants”) to “take all necessary acts to require the entire nation\nof the United States of America, all of its territories and jurisdictions, to eliminate any distinction in the\nlaw that prejudices the rights of Plaintiffs.”  Additionally, Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment\n“establishing that any law that restricts Plaintiffs’ rights of distinguishes Plaintiffs’ rights in any way\nfrom any opposite gender couple to be unconstitutional, under the United States Constitution, including\nall provisions of the [DOMA].” \nIn the instant Motion, California moves to dismiss the claims against it, which pertain\nonly to Proposition 8, arguing that Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue said claims.\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nA. Standing\nEach element of standing is \"an indispensable part of the plaintiff's case,\" and accordingly\n\"must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden, i.e.,\nwith the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\"  Lujan v.\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S. Ct. 2130 (1992).  To establish standing, a plaintiff\nmust demonstrate: (1) an ‘injury in fact’ – an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a)\nconcrete and particularized, and (b) ‘actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical’”; (2) “there\nmust be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of – the injury has to be\n‘fairly ... trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not ... th[e] result [of] the\nindependent action of some third party not before the court;” and (3) “it must be ‘likely,’ as opposed to\nmerely ‘speculative,’ that the injury will be ‘redressed by a favorable decision.’”   Id. at 2136 (internal\nMINUTES FORM 11 DOC Initials of Deputy Clerk _kh_\nCIVIL - GEN Page 2 of 4\n\nCase 8:09-cv-00286-DOC-MLG   Document 36    Filed 07/15/09   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #:212\ncitations omitted).

DISCUSSION\nThis is the second time that Plaintiffs have come before this Court, presenting\nsubstantially similar arguments each time.  In Smelt, et al. v. County of Orange, California, et al.,\nSACV04-1042 DOC (MLGx), Plaintiffs filed suit before Judge Gary L. Taylor, arguing that they had\napplied for, and been denied, a marriage license by the County Clerk of Orange County, California, in\nviolation of the U.S. Constitution.   More specifically, Plaintiffs argued that Section 2 of the DOMA\nviolates the United States Constitution’s Due Process, equal protection rights under the Fifth\nAmendment, the Right to Privacy and the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  Additionally, they argued that\nSection 3 of the DOMA violates the “liberty interests protected by the Due Process Clause”;\ndiscriminates “on the basis of gender” and “sexual orientation” in violation of equal protection; and\nviolates “the privacy interest protected by the Right to Privacy.”  Plaintiffs also argued that the\nCalifornia Family Code violated the U.S. Constitution.  Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that\nthe relevant sections of the California Family Code and the DOMA were unconstitutional as well as\ninjunctive relief “[m]andating the use of gender-neutral terms and issuing a marriage license to [them].”\nJudge Taylor (1) abstained from deciding the constitutionality of the challenged sections\nof the California Family Code until the resolution of cases then-pending before the California Court of\nappeal concerning whether the portions of the California Family Code that limit marriage to opposite-\nsex couples violated the California Constitution, (2) held that Plaintiffs had no standing to challenge\nSection 2 of the DOMA, and (3) held that Plaintiffs had no standing to challenge Section 3 of the\nDOMA but that that section did not violate the U.S. Constitution.  In Smelt v. County of Orange, 374\nF.Supp.2d 861, 685 (C.D. Cal. 2005), the Ninth Circuit reviewed Judge Taylor’s ruling in SACV04-\n1042 DOC (MLGx), upholding his decision to abstain as to Plaintiffs’ challenge to the California\nFamily Code, upholding his decision that Plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge either Section 3\nor Section 2 of the DOMA as Plaintiffs were not married (and as they presented abstract and\ngeneralized grievances), and vacating his decision regarding the merits of the DOMA Section 3 claim\nas, given the “abstract facial attack made,” no one could “know whether in the context of some\nparticular statute as applied to some particular person in some particular situation Congress’s use of the\nword ‘marriage’ [would] amount to an unconstitutional classification.”   \nOn remand, the case was transferred to this Court.  On August 29, 2008, this Court\ndismissed the case, as directed by the Ninth Circuit.  The Plaintiffs filed the instant lawsuit on\nNovember 3, 2008, this time including the fact that, after the filing of the initial lawsuit, they had been\nmarried under California law. \nMINUTES FORM 11 DOC Initials of Deputy Clerk _kh_\nCIVIL - GEN Page 3 of 4\n\nCase 8:09-cv-00286-DOC-MLG   Document 36    Filed 07/15/09   Page 4 of 4   Page ID #:213\nOnce again, the instant Motion turns not on the merits of the dispute, but on standing. \nCalifornia correctly asserts that Plaintiffs no longer have standing to pursue their claims against the\nState of California, as they relate to the enforcement of Proposition 8.  Proposition 8, as codified in\nSection 7.5 to Article I of the California Constitution, was recently held by the California Supreme\nCourt to present no bar to the recognition of Plaintiffs’ marriage within California, as said marriage was\nperformed before Proposition 8 was passed.  Strauss v. Horton, 46 Cal.4th 364 (Cal. 2009).  As\nPlaintiffs’ marriage is valid within California, they cannot present an injury with respect to the\nrecognition of their marriage by the State of California under Lujan and, therefore, they do not have\nstanding to pursue their claims against the State of California.  504 U.S. 555.\nIV. OUTCOME\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Motion is GRANTED and the State of California is\nHEREBY DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  \nThe Clerk shall serve this minute order on all parties to the action. \nMINUTES FORM 11 DOC Initials of Deputy Clerk _kh_\nCIVIL - GEN Page 4 of 4",

The Court should decline that invitation for a number of \nreasons. This case can and should be decided on much narrower grounds -- plaintiffs’ failure to establish the Court’s \njurisdiction over this action and plaintiffs’ inability to demonstrate that they have standing to pursue their claims. The \nplaintiffs have not shown that any other state has refused to recognize their California marriage, and they do not allege that \nthe federal definitions of “marriage” and “spouse” set forth in DOMA have been applied to them (e.g., plaintiffs do not allege \nthat they have applied for and been denied any federal benefits because of the operation of DOMA). Nothing in plaintiffs’ \nopposition to the United States’ motion to dismiss -- to the extent it addresses the issues at all -- undercuts either of these \nthreshold arguments (Doc. 40).1 Thus, on the issues of jurisdiction and standing alone, without even reaching the merits, this \ncase should be dismissed. \n  \nFootnotes \n \nWith  respect  to  the  merits,  this  Administration  does  not  support  DOMA  as  a  matter  of  policy,  believes  that  it  is \ndiscriminatory, and supports its repeal. Consistent with the rule of law, however, the Department of Justice has long followed \nthe practice of defending federal statutes as long as reasonable arguments can be made in support of their constitutionality, \neven if the Department disagrees with a particular statute as a policy matter, as it does here.2 And in this case, plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional claims are unavailing. In their opposition brief, plaintiffs offer only a token response to the United States’ \narguments on the merits. Indeed, they say nothing at all in response to the arguments concerning their “full faith and credit,” \nright to travel, right to privacy, First Amendment, or Ninth Amendment claims. On that basis alone, those claims should be \ndismissed. \n  \n1  Much of plaintiffs’ opposition is irrelevant to the United States’ motion to dismiss. Specifically, four of the memorandum’s six \npages are a verbatim repetition of plaintiffs’ opposition (Doc. 33) to the State of California’s motion to dismiss in this action, \nfocusing on issues of state sovereign immunity that are inapplicable here. \n  1 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 2610458...   \n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present motion to dismiss should be granted. \n  \nARGUMENT \nI. This Court Lacks Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Claims Against the United States Because the State Court Lacked \nJurisdiction \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that a federal court, after removal of a case from state court, “has no more jurisdiction than the state \ncourt” did before removal, see Salveson v. Western States Bankcard Ass’n, 731 F.2d 1423, 1431 (9th Cir. 1984), nor that the \nSuperior Court of California for the County of Orange lacked jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims in this case before removal. \nSee Powelson v. United States, 150 F.3d 1103, 1105 (9th Cir. 1998) (dismissing removed matter where “[t]he government \n[had] not waived its immunity from suit in state courts”); Nebraska v. Bentson, 146 F.3d 676, 679 (9th Cir. 1998) (“Without \nan express waiver of the IRS’s sovereign immunity as an agency of the United States, the state court lacked jurisdiction.”). \nPlaintiffs’ only response to these principles is to allege that the parties herein “understood” between themselves that this \naction would initially be filed in state court, followed by removal to this Court by the United States (Doc. 40 at 2). That, \nhowever, is inaccurate.3 As explained in the accompanying declaration, the United States at no time agreed to the initial \nfiling of this action in state court, and counsel for the parties did not communicate regarding removal of the case to federal \ncourt until after the United States had transmitted its Notice of Removal to this Court. (See Declaration of W. Scott Simpson \n¶¶ 2-4 (Attachment 1 hereto).) Thus, there was no “understanding” between the parties regarding the filing of this action in \nstate court or its removal to this Court. In any event, even if there had been such an “understanding” between counsel, it \ncould not create jurisdiction in this Court contrary to the established principles set forth above. See United States v. New York \nRayon Importing Co., 329 U.S. 654, 660, 67 S. Ct. 601, 604, 91 L.Ed. 577 (1947) ( “[O]fficers of the United States possess \nno power through their actions to ... confer jurisdiction on a court in the absence of some express provision by Congress.”); \nsee also United States v. Judge, 944 F.2d 523, 525 (9th Cir. 1991) (“[I]t is well-established that litigants cannot confer \n[subject matter] jurisdiction by consent where none exists.”). \n 2  This longstanding and bipartisan tradition accords the respect appropriately due to a co-equal branch of government and ensures \nthat subsequent administrations will faithfully defend laws with which they may disagree on policy grounds. \n \n \nII. Plaintiffs’ Claims and Allegations Against the United States Must Be Dismissed for Lack of Standing \nPlaintiffs lack standing to challenge either section of DOMA. Section 2 provides that one state need not recognize a same-sex \nmarriage performed under the laws of another state. 28 U.S.C. § 1738C. Plaintiffs are married under the laws of California, \nbut they are residents of California and do not allege that any other state has refused to recognize their marriage (Complaint \n¶¶ 9, 10). Section 3 of DOMA defines the words “marriage” and “spouse” for purposes of federal law, but plaintiffs do not \nallege that that definition has ever been applied to them. 1 U.S.C. § 7.4 \n 3  Plaintiffs also assert that the United States has “inadvertently led [this Court] to misunderstand why Plaintiffs filed in State court,” \nby “fail [ing] to mention” plaintiffs’ state court filing (Doc. 40 at 2). That is also incorrect, as the United States’ motion to dismiss \nsets forth in detail the facts regarding plaintiffs’ attempted filing in this Court, the denial of in forma pauperis status, and the \nsubsequent filing in state court (Doc. 25 at 8). \n \n \nPlaintiffs’ only response in support of standing is to assert that “the Ninth Circuit ruled [in Smelt v. County of Orange, 447 \nF.3d 673 (9th Cir. 2006)] that if Smelt and Hammer were married they had standing to address DOMA in it’s [sic] entirety” \n(Doc. 40 at 7). But that is a misreading of the Court of Appeals’ decision, and a misunderstanding of the requirements for \nstanding. Regarding plaintiffs’ lack of standing to challenge Section 2, the court said, “In sum, while Section 2 may affect \nsomeone who has been declared married in some state, Smelt and Hammer do not come within that category of people.” \nSmelt, 447 F.3d at 683 (emphasis added). In other words, marriage was a necessary, but not a sufficient, circumstance for \n  2 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 2610458...   \n \n \nchallenging Section 2. That also is stated in this Court’s opinion granting summary judgment to the defendants: \nPlaintiffs ... have not shown they will suffer an imminent injury as a result of section 2. They do not \nclaim to have plans or a desire to get married in Massachusetts or elsewhere and attempt to have the \nmarriage recognized in California. They do not claim to have plans to seek recognition of their eventual \nCalifornia marriage in another state. Without definite plans to engage in an act that will cause them to \nsuffer an injury in fact, Plaintiffs have not established an imminent injury sufficient to confer standing to \nchallenge section 2. \n   \nSmelt v. County of Orange, 374 F. Supp. 2d 861, 871 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (emphasis added). Because plaintiffs “do not claim to \nhave plans to seek recognition of their ... California marriage in another state,” they still lack standing to challenge Section 2. \n  \nFurthermore, plaintiffs’ argument ignores the Court of Appeals’ separate holding regarding plaintiffs’ lack of standing to \nchallenge Section 3, the definitional section. In that regard, the Court said: \nIn fact, [plaintiffs] do not suggest that they have applied for any federal benefits, much less been denied any at this point. \nThat they might someday be married under the law of some state or ask for some federal benefit which they are denied is not \nenough. \n   \nSmelt, 447 F.3d at 684 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). These principles apply regardless of plaintiffs’ marital status. \nThey still have “not suggest [ed] that they have applied for any federal benefits, much less been denied any at this point.” Id. \nThus, plaintiffs lack standing to challenge Section 3. Accordingly, the instant motion to dismiss should be granted. \n  \nIII. Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection and Due Process Claims Must Be Dismissed Because DOMA Survives Rational Basis \nReview \nPlaintiffs’ equal protection and due process claims raise several issues, all of which were addressed in the United States’ \nmotion to dismiss. As established in the government’s opening memorandum, federal courts have unanimously upheld the \nconstitutionality of DOMA.5 Plaintiffs’ only response to the government’s arguments in favor of dismissal is to assert, \nwithout elaboration, that “same gender marriage is a ... fundamental right” such that DOMA is subject to “heightened \nscrutiny,” and to imply that DOMA constitutes “gender discrimination” (Doc. 40 at 4, 5). The United States refuted these \nassertions in its opening memorandum. \n 4  The Court has dismissed plaintiffs’ claims against the State of California in this case for lack of standing (Doc. 36). \n \n \nCourts have held that challenges to DOMA are subject to rational basis review.6 Under that deferential standard of review, \nthis Court should find that Congress could reasonably have concluded that there is a legitimate government interest in \nmaintaining the status quo regarding the distribution of federal benefits in the face of serious and fluid policy differences in \nand among the states. That there is now a debate taking place in this country about same-sex marriage does not make \nCongress’s belief in this regard any less rational. Basic federalism principles allowed Congress in 1996, and allow Congress \nnow, to take this uniform approach based on a traditional definition of marriage that all 50 states recognize while the states \ngrapple with the emerging debate over same-sex marriage. Under rational basis review, Congress can reasonably take the \nview that it wishes to wait to see how these issues are resolved at the state level before extending federal benefits to \nmarriages that were not recognized in any state when Congress tied eligibility for those benefits to marital status. \n 5  See In re Kandu, 315 B.R. 123, 140 (Bankr. D. Wash. 2004); Wilson v. Ake, 354 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1307 (M.D. Fla. 2005); Hunt v. \nAke, Case No. 04-1852 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 20, 2005); Smelt v. County of Orange, 374 F. Supp. 2d 861, 879 (C.D. Cal. 2005); see also \nBishop v. Oklahoma, 447 F. Supp. 2d 1239, 1252 (N.D. Okla. 2006), rev’d on other grounds, No. 06-5188, 2009 WL 1566802 \n(10th Cir. June 5, 2009). \n \n \nUnlike the intervenors here, the government does not contend that there are legitimate government interests in “creating a \nlegal structure that promotes the raising of children by both of their biological parents” or that the government’s interest in \n“responsible procreation” justifies Congress’s decision to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman (Doc. \n42 at 8-9). Since DOMA was enacted, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychological Association, the \n  3 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 2610458...   \n \n \nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Medical Association, and the Child Welfare League \nof America have issued policies opposing restrictions on lesbian and gay parenting because they concluded, based on \nnumerous studies, that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are as likely to be well-adjusted as children raised by \nheterosexual parents.7 Furthermore, in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 605 (2003), Justice Scalia acknow-ledged in his \ndissent that encouraging procreation would not be a rational basis for limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples under the \nreasoning of the Lawrence majority opinion -- which, of course, is the prevailing law -- because “the sterile and the elderly \nare allowed to marry.” For these reasons, the United States does not believe that DOMA is rationally related to any legitimate \ngovernment interests in procreation and child-rearing and is therefore not relying upon any such interests to defend DOMA’s \nconstitutionality. \n 6  As noted in the government’s opening brief, under existing Ninth Circuit precedent, plaintiffs’ claims are subject to rational basis \nreview (Doc. 25 at 25-32). Courts that have considered constitutional challenges to DOMA have applied a rational basis test (see \nsupra n.5). \n \n \nIV. Plaintiffs Have Conceded the United States’ Motion to Dismiss As to All of Their Other Claims \nPlaintiffs’ response says nothing about any of their other claims -- under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the right to travel, \nthe right to privacy, the First Amendment, and the Ninth Amendment -- all of which the United States fully addressed in its \nmotion to dismiss. Given that plaintiffs have not responded to the United States’ arguments on those claims, such arguments \nmust be taken as conceded. See adidas-America, Inc. v. Payless Shoesource, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1076 (D. Or. 2008) \n(failing to respond to opponent’s argument constitutes conceding argument); Canatella v. Stovitz, 365 F. Supp. 2d 1064, \n1083-84 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (same); Southern Nevada Shell Dealers Ass’n v. Shell Oil Co., 725 F. Supp. 1104, 1109 (D. Nev. \n1989) (same). Thus, the Court can and should dismiss those claims on this basis alone. \n  \nCONCLUSION \nAccordingly, the United States’ motion to dismiss should be granted, and all of plaintiffs’ claims against the United States \nshould be dismissed with prejudice. \n  \nDated: August 17, 2009 \n  \nRespectfully submitted, \n  \nTONY WEST \n  \nAssistant Attorney General \n  \nARTHUR R.

Given the prejudice caused by the late filing, the Court may properly disregard the opposition and grant the motion \nwithout leave to amend. \n  \nMoreover, none of Plaintiffs’ arguments defeat the motion. The United States Supreme Court decisions on sovereign \nimmunity cited by Plaintiffs have no bearing on their standing to sue.

PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO THE MOTION TO DISMISS IS UNTIMELY AND VIOLATES THE LOCAL \nRULES OF COURT. \n  1 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiff, v...., 2009 WL 2135250...   \n \n \nPlaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion to dismiss on Thursday, July 9, 2009, two court days before the scheduled \nhearing on the motion. Under the local rules, the opposition was due “not later than fourteen (14) days before the date \ndesignated for the hearing of the motion,” in this case, by no later than June 29, 2009. (L.R. 7-9.) \n  \nThe Court may decline to consider the late opposition or deem it as consent to granting the motion: \nThe Court may decline to consider any memorandum or other paper not filed within the deadline set by \norder or local rule. The failure to file any required paper, or the failure to file it within the deadline, may \nbe deemed consent to the granting or denial of the motion. \n   \n(L.R. 7-12.) \n  \nFurther, the proof of service attached to the amended opposition shows that the pleading was served by mail on the Attorney \nGeneral’s Office on July 9, 2009. The Central District local rules require a party opposing the motion to “serve upon all other \nparties and file with the Clerk” the evidence and memorandum in opposition. (L.R. 7-9.) The date and form of mailing made \nit unlikely that the Attorney General would receive the opposition before the hearing and, at a minimum, did not comply with \nthe spirit of the local rules.1 \n Footnotes \n \nPlaintiffs’ time of filing and method of service have made it impossible for the State to file a reply brief within the time limit \nspecified by the local rules. They have also left the State with little time to prepare a reply brief and respond to the cases and \narguments presented in the brief. \n  \nThe Court may appropriately consider these factors in deciding whether to consider the Plaintiffs’ opposition or the weight to \nbe given to the arguments made therein. Because of the extremely late filing, and the presumptive prejudice caused to the \nState from the late filing, the Court is respectfully requested to disregard the opposition on this basis and grant the motion to \ndismiss. \n  \nII. PLAINTIFFS’ RELIANCE ON SUPREME COURT SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY CASES DOES NOT ADDRESS \nTHE STANDING ISSUES RAISED BY THE MOTION. \nIn their brief, Plaintiffs rely heavily on a series of Supreme Court decisions that they characterize as addressing the doctrine \nof sovereign immunity. (Opp., pp. 1-4.) These citations miss the mark because the motion to dismiss is not based on \nsovereign immunity but on Plaintiffs’ lack of standing to bring suit against the State. \n  \nFor example, in United States v. Georgia (2006) 543 U.S. 151, the Supreme Court addressed whether a state prison inmate \nmay sue the State for damages under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Relying on Congress’s enforcement \npowers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court held that “insofar as Title II creates a private cause of action \nfor damages against the States for conduct that actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Title II validly abrogates state \nsovereign immunity.” Id. at p. 159 (original emphasis). \n  \nPlaintiffs cite United States v. Georgia as unqualifiedly asserting that “Congress is expressly granted authority to enforce the \nsubstantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment” and assert that the decision “clearly says that state governments may \nbe sued for violating the Constitution so far as it is reasonably practical.”2 (Opp., p. 3:17-20.) But the full passage in United \nStates v. Georgia actually states: “ ‘In [§ 5] Congress is expressly granted authority to enforce ... the substantive provisions of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment’ by providing actions for money damages against the States.” United States v. Georgia, 543 U.S. \nat p. 158, quoting Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer (1976) 427 U.S. 445, 456. \n 1  The Attorney General’s Office obtained a copy of the motion only by checking the Court’s docket to see if one had been filed. \n \n \nThus, United States v. Georgia is easily distinguishable from the Plaintiffs’ lawsuit because the Plaintiffs are not presenting a \nclaim derived from Congress’s section 5 enforcement power. Nor are the Plaintiffs, unlike the petitioner in United States v. \nGeorgia, bringing suit to enforce rights under a federal statute. \n  2 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiff, v...., 2009 WL 2135250...   \n \n \n  \nSimilarly, the Supreme Court’s decision in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank \n(1999) 527 U.S. 627 addressed Congress’s section 5 enforcement power to implement a legislative solution, not the particular \npetitioner’s standing to sue. There, the Court held that the abrogation of the States’ sovereign immunity in the Patent and \nPlant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act was invalid because it could not be sustained as legislation enacted to \nenforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. (See, id. at pp. 633-648.) \n  \nThe same is true of the other cases cited by Plaintiffs. See Tennessee v. Lane (2004) 541 U.S. 509 [holding that Title II of the \nADA, as applied to cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts, constitutes a valid exercise of Congress’s \nenforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment]; Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs (2003) 538 U.S. 721 \n[recognizing power of Congress to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit and enable employees to recover \ndamages against State for violation of Family Medical Leave Act]; City of Boerne v. Flores (1997) 521 U.S. 507 [holding \nthat Religious Freedom Restoration Act exceeded Congress’s power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment]. \n  \nNone of these decisions bear on the question of whether these particular Plaintiffs have sufficient standing to sue California \nin federal court to obtain a declaratory judgment holding that a duly enacted state initiative violates the United States \nConstitution.  Since  Plaintiffs  are  not  seeking  to  validate  rights  recognized  by  Congress  acting  under  its  Fourteenth \nAmendment enforcement power, this line of authority does not counter or even address the arguments made in the motion to \ndismiss. Therefore, this portion of Plaintiffs’ opposition should be disregarded. \n  \nIII. THE CALIFORNIA PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL STATUTE DOES NOT CONFER STANDING ON \nPLAINTIFFS TO BRING SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT. \nIn the heading that begins their brief and in one short paragraph, Plaintiffs, without citation to any authority whatsoever, \nassert that California’s private attorney general law confers standing on Plaintiffs to challenge the constitutionality of \nProposition 8. (Opp., pp. 1, 4.) No such authorization can be inferred from this doctrine. \n  \n“The ‘private attorney general’ concept ‘seeks to encourage suits effectuating a strong congressional or national policy by \nawarding substantial attorney’s fees, regardless of defendants’ conduct, to those who successfully bring such suits and \nthereby bring about benefits to a broad class of citizens.’ ” 7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Judgment, § 256, p. 836, \nquoting D’Amico v. Board of Med. Examiners (1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 27. In California, the doctrine has been codified to define \nthe circumstances authorizing a fee award. Cal. Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.5. \n  \nUnmentioned by Plaintiffs is the federal Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976, which “gives the district courts \ndiscretion to award reasonable attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party (other than the United States) in an action or proceeding \nto enforce provisions of various [federal] statutes ....” 7 Witkin, § 242, p. 816. \n  \nPlaintiffs cite no authority suggesting that these attorney fee provisions independently confer standing to bring the claims \nsought in this case. Absent supporting authority, Plaintiffs may not bootstrap their way to subject matter jurisdiction in this \nmatter. \n  \nIV. PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED ANY BASIS FOR STANDING. \nNear the end of their brief, Plaintiffs, again without any citation to authority, suggest that they have standing on grounds that \ntheir marriage is a “second class marriage.” This assertion is not consistent with the California Supreme Court’s holding in \nStrauss v. Horton. \n  \nAs noted in the motion to dismiss, Strauss held that Proposition 8 was not retroactive and did not apply to the approximately \n18,000 same-sex marriages occurring before passage of Proposition 8. Because Plaintiffs allege that they were married in \nJuly 2008, before the November election in which the voters adopted the measure, they are among the same-sex couples \nwhose marriages were recognized as valid under California law by the Supreme Court. \n  3 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiff, v...., 2009 WL 2135250...   \n \n \n  \nNor can their marriage be pejoratively characterized as “second-class” under California law consistently with the holding in \nStrauss. There, the California Supreme Court held that the pre-election marriages, which would include Plaintiffs’ marriage, \n“remain valid in all respects.” Strauss v. Horton, 46 Cal.4th at p. 474. \n  \nAlternatively, plaintiffs appear to argue that they may bring suit because other couples are being denied fundamental \nconstitutional rights. But this is clearly not a basis for these plaintiffs, whose marriage is unaffected by Proposition 8, to \nassert standing to challenge the measure’s constitutionality. “The claim must be for injury to plaintiff’s own legal rights and \ninterests, rather than the legal or interests of third parties.” Schwarzer, et. al., Federal Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter \nGroup 2009) § 2:1207, p. 2E-3 (original emphasis).) \n  \nFurther, Plaintiffs mischaracterize the outcome of their prior lawsuit. (Opp., p. 5:14-19.) The district court ultimately \ndismissed their lawsuit against the State as moot because they had been lawfully married. (See Request for Judicial Notice.) \nThe same result should be reached here. \n  \nFinally, it bears noting that Plaintiffs completely mischaracterize the Attorney General’s argument regarding Proposition 8 \nand the reasons why Plaintiffs lack standing. (Opp., pp. 4:22-5:19.) Needless to say, this mischaracterization does not \nestablish any basis for standing. \n  \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs’ untimely opposition should be disregarded as in violation of the local district court rules. Further, Plaintiffs have \nfailed to meet their burden to establish sufficient basis for standing to challenge the constitutionality of Proposition 8 in \nfederal court. Because standing is a fundamental element of subject matter jurisdiction, the motion to dismiss under Rule \n12(b)(6) should be granted without leave to amend. \n  \nDated: July 10, 2009 \n  \nRespectfully submitted, \n  \nEDMUND G. BROWN JR. \n  \nAttorney General of California \n  \nJONATHAN K. RENNER \n  \nSenior Assistant Attorney General \n  \nSTEPHEN P. ACQUISTO \n  \nSupervising Deputy Attorney General \n  \n/s/ Mark R.

Carter. \nHearing Date: July 13, 2009 \n  \nHearing Time: 8:30 a.m. \n  \nCourtroom: 9D \n  \nINTRODUCTION \n  \nIntervenors Proposition 8 Official Proponents Dennis Hollingsworth, Gail J. Knight, Martin F. Gutierrez, Hak-Shing William \nTam, and Mark A. Jansson, and Proposition 8 Campaign Committee ProtectMarriage.com - Yes on 8, a Project of California \nRenewal, (collectively referred to as “Intervenors”) join the Motion to Dismiss Action against Defendant State of California, \nand submit this memorandum in support thereof. Plaintiffs Arthur Smelt and Christopher Hammer allege, among other \nthings, that California’s marriage amendment (commonly known as Proposition 8) violates various provisions of the United \nStates Constitution. (Compl. at ¶ 29.) Plaintiffs, however, lack standing to challenge the constitutionality of Proposition 8. \n  \nUnder Article III of the United States Constitution, a plaintiff in federal court does not have standing to assert a claim unless \nhe demonstrates that (1) he has suffered an “actual or imminent” injury, (2) there is a causal connection between the injury \nand the complained-of conduct, and (3) the injury will “likely” be “redressed by a favorable decision.” Lujan v. Defenders of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). Plaintiffs cannot establish any of these elements; thus, their challenge to Proposition 8 \nshould be dismissed for lack of standing. \n  \n  1 \n \n\nArthur SMELT et al., Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES OF..., 2009 WL 1899555...   \n \n \nARGUMENT \nI. Plaintiffs Cannot Satisfy The Three Irreducible Constitutional Requirements of Standing To Challenge Proposition \n8. \n“The judicial power of the United States defined by [Article] III is not an unconditioned authority to determine the \nconstitutionality of legislative or executive acts.” Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church and \nState, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982). \nThe federal courts are not empowered to seek out and strike down any governmental act that they deem \nto be repugnant to the  Constitution.  Rather,  federal courts sit solely[] to decide on the rights of \nindividuals, and must refrain from passing upon the constitutionality of an act unless obliged to do so in \nthe proper performance of [the] judicial function, when the question is raised by a party whose interests \nentitle him to raise it. \n   \nHein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U.S. 587, 127 S. Ct. 2553, 2562 (2007) (quotations, citations, and \nalterations omitted). \n  \n“In every federal case, the party bringing the suit must establish standing to prosecute the action.” Elk Grove Unified Sch. \nDist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 11 (2004). “[A] plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press.” \nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006). “The irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains \nthree requirements”: “injury in fact, causation, and redressability.” Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. \n83, 102-03 (1998) (citations omitted). “Injury in fact” is a harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. “Causation” is “a fairly traceable connection between the \nplaintiff’s injury and the complained-of conduct of the defendant.” Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 103. “Redressability” is “a \nlikelihood that the requested relief will redress the alleged injury.” Id. “The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the \nburden of establishing these elements.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. Plaintiffs’ allegations do not satisfy these elements; instead, \nthe facts in their complaint show unmistakably that they lack standing to challenge Proposition 8. \n  \nFirst, Proposition 8 has not inflicted, nor threatened to inflict, any concrete or particularized injury on Plaintiffs. According to \ntheir complaint, Plaintiffs entered into a legal union “on or subsequent to July 10, 2008,” that the State of California \nconsidered to be a “marriage.” (Compl. at ¶ 2.) Recently, the California Supreme Court held that all same-sex unions entered \nbefore the enactment of Proposition 8 in November 2008 and considered to be “marriages” by the State “remain valid in all \nrespects.” Strauss v. Horton, 207 P.3d 48, 122 (Cal. 2009). Thus, Proposition 8 did not affect Plaintiffs’ legal union, and \nneither did it inflict a legally cognizable injury for purposes of standing analysis. \n  \nSecond, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate the requisite causal connection to establish standing. “[A] federal court [may] act only \nto redress injury that fairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant, and not injury that results from the \nindependent action of some third party[.]” Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976). But, \nhere, none of the harm alleged by Plaintiffs can be attributed to the enactment of Proposition 8. For example, Plaintiffs \nlament “[t]he refusal of all states and jurisdictions of the United States of America to recognize” their legal union. (Compl. at \n¶ 3.) Plaintiffs also complain that the refusal of other jurisdictions to recognize their legal union “results in the denial of \nhundreds  of  state  law  rights,  benefits[,]  and  responsibilities,  and  more  than  a  thousand  federal  rights,  benefits,  and \nresponsibilities.” (Compl. at ¶ 3.) But the Strauss decision makes clear that California continues to grant all “marital” rights, \nbenefits, and responsibilities to Plaintiffs under California law. Strauss, 207 P.3d at 122. And the refusal of other States or the \nfederal government to recognize their legal union is not connected to the enactment of Proposition 8. Thus, Plaintiffs’ \ncomplained-of harm cannot be attributed to Proposition 8. \n  \nThird, Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the redressability requirement. Redressability requires “that prospective relief will remove the \n[alleged] harm.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 505 (1975). “Relief that does not remedy the injury suffered cannot bootstrap \na plaintiff into federal court.” Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 107. Instead, the plaintiff must show “that he personally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court’s intervention.” Warth, 422 U.S. at 508. In this case, Plaintiffs request an injunction \n“mandating and compelling the State of California to eliminate” Proposition 8 from its Constitution. (Compl. at Prayer for \nRelief ¶ 6.) But that relief would not redress any harm alleged by Plaintiffs. Even with Proposition 8 in place, California \n  2 \n \n\nArthur SMELT et al., Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES OF..., 2009 WL 1899555...   \n \n \ncontinues to recognize and affirm Plaintiffs’ legal union “in all respects.” Strauss, 207 P.3d at 122. Invalidating and \neradicating that provision from California’s Constitution would not affect Plaintiffs’ legal union nor remedy any harm alleged \nby them. As a result, they cannot satisfy the redressability requirement of standing. See, e.g., Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 \nU.S. 614, 618 (1973) (finding no standing where the plaintiff did not demonstrate “the ‘direct’ relationship between the \nalleged injury and the claim sought to be adjudicated”). \n  \nII. Prudential-Standing Considerations Further Demonstrate That Plaintiffs Lack Standing To Challenge Proposition \n8. \nPrudential-standing  considerations  additionally  weigh  against  finding  that  Plaintiffs  have  standing  to  challenge  the \nconstitutionality of Proposition 8. On the issue of prudential standing, the Supreme Court has said: \nThe command to guard jealously and exercise rarely our power to make constitutional pronouncements \nrequires strictest adherence when matters of great national significance are at stake. Even in cases \nconcededly within our jurisdiction under Article III, we abide by a series of rules under which we have \navoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon us for decision. Always \nwe must balance the heavy obligation to exercise jurisdiction[] against the deeply rooted commitment not \nto pass on questions of constitutionality unless adjudication of the constitutional issue is necessary[.] \n   \nNewdow, 542 U.S. at 11 (quotations, alterations, and citations omitted). “One of the principal areas in which this Court has \ncustomarily declined to intervene is the realm of domestic relations.” Id. at 12. “[I]n general it is appropriate for the federal \ncourts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.” Id. at 13. \n  \nPlaintiffs’ challenge to Proposition 8 raises issues of great national significance involving domestic relations. Twenty-nine \nother States, in addition to California, have enacted constitutional amendments similar or identical to Proposition 8.1 \nPlaintiffs’ challenge to Proposition 8 threatens all these state constitutional provisions defining marriage-- society’s most \nfundamental domestic relation. Thus, prudential-standing considerations further demonstrate that Plaintiffs lack standing to \nchallenge Proposition 8. \n *  Admitted pro hac vice. \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant the Motion to Dismiss Action against Defendant State of California.2 \n 1  See Ala. Const. art. I, § 36.03; Alaska Const. art. 1, § 25; Ariz. Const. art. XXX § 1; Ark. Const. amend. 83, § 1-3; Col. Const. art. \nII, §31; Fla. Const. art. I § 27; Ga. Const. art. I, §IV; Haw.

XIII, § 13. \n \n \nDated: June 29, 2009 \n  \n/s/Brian W. Raum \n  \nBrian W. Raum (NY Bar No. 2856102)* \n 2  Intervenors emphasize that their interests and involvement in this case will not cease if the Court finds that Plaintiffs lack standing \nto challenge Proposition 8 directly. As discussed in Intervenors’ Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of their Motion \nto Intervene, their significantly protectable interests in Proposition 8 might be adversely affected by a finding that the Federal \nDefense of Marriage Act’s definitional provision, which defines “marriage” for federal purposes as the “legal union between one \nman and one woman as husband and wife,” 1 U.S.C. § 7, violates the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses of the United States \nConstitution. The relevant legal analysis in resolving Plaintiffs’ claims against Federal DOMA will require this Court to determine \n  3 \n \n\nArthur SMELT et al., Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES OF..., 2009 WL 1899555...   \n \n \nwhether the federal government’s definition of marriage is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. See Kimel v. Fla. \nBd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 83-84 (2000) (defining rational-basis review for equal-protection analysis). If this Court were to find \nthat the government lacks a rational basis for defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman, and thus conclude that Federa \nDOMA’s definitional provision violates the United States Constitution, it would create a judicial precedent that gravely jeopardizes \nthe federal constitutionality of Proposition 8, which defines marriage the same as Federal DOMA. This clear and significant \nprecedential impact on Proposition 8 demonstrates that Intervenors’ interests very well might be impaired by this Court’s ruling on \nPlaintiffs’ challenge to Federal DOMA. For this reason, as well as others, Intervenors will continue to zealously litigate this case \neven if this Court dismisses Plaintiffs’ direct claims against Proposition 8. \n \n \nATTORNEYS FOR PROPOSED INTERVENORS \n  \n*  Admitted pro hac vice \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  4 \n ",

P. 12(b)(6)  ........................................................................................................   2, 9 \n   \n \nINTRODUCTION \n  \nOn May 26, 2009, the California Supreme Court issued its highly anticipated decision in a set of consolidated cases \nchallenging the validity of Proposition 8 under the California Constitution. Although it upheld Proposition 8 as a valid \nconstitutional amendment, the Court narrowly construed the measure’s scope and, most importantly for this motion, held that \nProposition 8 did not retroactively apply to same-sex marriages solemnized before the measure was approved by the voters in \nthe November 2008 election. “Those marriages,” wrote the court, “remain valid in all respects.” Strauss v. Horton (May 26, \n2009) 2009 WL 1444594 at 65, 93 Cal. Rptr. 2d 591, 680. \n  \n  2 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiff, v...., 2009 WL 1683905...   \n \n \nStrauss leaves no doubt that same-sex marriages lawfully occurring in California before the November election remain valid \nand recognized under California law notwithstanding the passage of Proposition 8. This means that Plaintiffs, a same-sex \ncouple who allege that they were lawfully married in California before the election, lack standing to challenge the facial \nvalidity of Proposition 8 under the United States Constitution. As for this challenge, Plaintiffs are unable to establish any of \nthe essential elements of standing that would demonstrate the presence of a “case or controversy” within the meaning of \nArticle III. Quite simply, there is no relief that this Court can grant Plaintiffs that California has not already recognized. \n  \nBecause Plaintiffs lack standing to bring any of the claims alleged in their complaint against the State of California, the state \nmust be dismissed from this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Moreover, because there is no possibility \nthat Plaintiffs can amend these claims to assert standing, the action against the state should be dismissed without leave to \namend. \n  \nIt is not unlikely that the constitutionality of Proposition 8 will be challenged by litigants in other federal court proceedings. \nIndeed, at least one highly publicized challenge has already been filed in the Northern District: Perry v. Schwarzenegger, \nNorthern District case no. CV09-2292. But if such challenges are to be heard by the federal courts, they must be brought by \nplaintiffs who come with sufficient standing to satisfy Article III. The plaintiffs in this case, their marriage unaffected in any \nway by the passage of Proposition 8, lack standing to sue and are not the proper parties to present this challenge. \n  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  \nI. THE FIRST SMELT LAWSUIT AND THE MARRIAGE CASES DECISION. \n  \nThis case is the second time that Plaintiffs Arthur Smelt and Christopher Hammer have challenged the constitutionality of \nCalifornia marriage laws in federal court. In the previous case (Smelt v. County of Orange, Central District case no. SACV \n04-1042), which was the subject of published opinions in the district court and the Ninth Circuit, Plaintiffs’ claims against the \nState of California were dismissed as moot after the California Supreme Court held that the state’s ban on same-sex marriage \nviolated the state Constitution. In re Marriage Cases (2008) 43 Cal. 4th 757, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 683. \n  \nIn this initial lawsuit, filed in 2004, Plaintiffs alleged that the Orange County Clerk had denied them a marriage license \nbecause they were a couple of the same sex. Smelt v. County of Orange, 374 F. Supp. 2d 861, 864 (C.D. Cal. 2005). In \naddition to suing the County of Orange, Plaintiffs sued the State Registrar of Vital Statistics and the Department of Health \nServices, alleging that California statutes prohibiting same-sex marriage violated provisions of the United States Constitution, \nincluding the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. Id. Among other statutes, Plaintiffs challenged California Family \nCode section 300, which defined marriage as “a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between a man and a woman,” \nand section 308.5, which provided that “[o]nly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.” \nId. \n  \nPlaintiffs also challenged the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (“DOMA”). Smelt v. County of Orange, \n374 F. Supp. 2d at 864. They asserted that section 2 of the DOMA, which provides that no state is required to recognize a \nrelationship between a same-sex couple treated as marriage by another state, violated the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the \nUnited States Constitution.1 Id. at 865. And they asserted that section 3 of the DOMA, which defines marriage for purposes \nof federal law, violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. Constitution and their right of privacy.2 Id. \nAt the Court’s invitation, the United States intervened to respond to the DOMA challenge. Id. \n  \nFootnotes \n \n1  Section 2 of the DOMA provides: “No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give \neffect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship \nbetween persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a \nright or claim arising from such relationship.” 28 U.S.C. § 1738C. \n \n \n  3 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiff, v...., 2009 WL 1683905...   \n \n \nIn his published decision, Judge Taylor granted the state defendants’ motion to abstain and to stay the part of the case \nchallenging the state statutes pending resolution of In re Marriage Cases in the California Supreme Court. Smelt v. County of \nOrange, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 865-870. As for the DOMA claims, Judge Taylor held that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge \nSection 2, and, although he found that they had standing to challenge section 3, upheld that section as constitutional. Id. at \n870-880. \n  \nAffirming in part and reversing in part, the Ninth Circuit upheld Judge Taylor’s decision to abstain from deciding the \nconstitutionality of the state marriage laws until the California Supreme Court had resolved their validity under the state \nConstitution. Smelt v. County of Orange, 447 F. 3d 673, 678-682 (9th Cir. 2006). Further, the Ninth Circuit agreed that \nplaintiffs lacked standing to challenge section 2 of the DOMA. Id. at 682-683. But the appellate court concluded that \nplaintiffs also lacked standing to challenge section 3 of the DOMA and held that the district court should not have reached \nthe question of its constitutionality. Id. at 683-686. Therefore, while upholding the decision to abstain from the state claims \nand to dismiss the section 2 claim, the Ninth Circuit vacated the district court’s decision on the section 3 claim and remanded \nwith instructions to dismiss that claim as well. Id. at 686. \n  \nIn May 2008, the California Supreme Court issued its long-awaited decision in In re Marriage Cases. Holding that the \nstatutes violated the California Constitution, the Court struck down Family Code section 308.5 in its entirety and language in \nFamily Code section 300 limiting marriage to a union between a man and a woman. In re Marriage Cases, 43 Cal. 4th at 857. \n  \nAfter the opinion in Marriage Cases was issued, the district court in the first Smelt case (now reassigned to Judge Carter) \ndismissed the action on remand from the Ninth Circuit. (See Request for Judicial Notice, Order Dismissing Case Pursuant to \nNinth Circuit Order.) In its order, the district court took note of the Marriage Cases decision, adding that plaintiffs “were \nsubsequently married.” (Id. at 2.) Addressing the state law claims, the district court wrote: \n  \nWith regard to the challenges of California state-law, the California Supreme Court resolved these challenges based on the \nstate Constitution. Thus, there is no need to resolve the Federal Constitutional issues, absent some subsequent change in law. \nAccordingly this claim is hereby DISMISSED. \n  \n(Id. at 2 (original emphasis).) \n  \nThe district court specified that the state law claims were dismissed with prejudice. Id. Additionally, the court dismissed the \nsection 2 and section 3 DOMA claims. Id. \n  \nII. PROPOSITION 8 AND THE STRAUSS V. HORTON DECISION. \n  \nIn the November 2008 election, after the decision in Marriage Cases and the dismissal of the first Smelt lawsuit, California \nvoters approved Proposition 8. This measure added the following provision to the California Constitution: “Only marriage \nbetween a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.” Cal. Const., art. I, § 7.5. This wording was identical to the \nwording of Family Code section 308.5, found unconstitutional in Marriage Cases. \n  \nThe measure was immediately challenged in three original petitions filed in the California Supreme Court, later consolidated \nunder the lead case of Strauss v. Horton, no. 168047.3 In accepting the petitions for review, the Supreme Court directed the \nparties to brief three issues: (1) Is Proposition 8 invalid because it constitutes a revision of, rather than an amendment to, the \nCalifornia Constitution? (2) Does Proposition 8 violate the separation of powers doctrine under the California Constitution? \n(3) If Proposition 8 is not unconstitutional, what is its effect, if any, on the marriages of same-sex couples performed before \nthe adoption of Proposition 8? Strauss v. Horton, 2009 WL 1444594 at 13 fn. 4. \n  \n2  Section 3 of the DOMA provides: “In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or \ninterpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word ‘marriage’ means only a legal \nunion between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a person of the opposite sex \nwho is a husband or a wife.” 1 U.S.C. § 7. \n \n \n  4 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiff, v...., 2009 WL 1683905...   \n \n \nThe Court upheld Proposition 8 as a constitutional amendment validly approved through the initiative process. Strauss v. \nHorton, 2009 WL 1444594 at 43-54. Additionally, the Court held that Proposition 8 did not violate the separation of powers \ndoctrine. Id. at 57-59. \n  \nOn the third issue, the measure’s impact on existing same-sex marriages, the court held that Proposition 8 “should be \ninterpreted to apply prospectively and not to invalidate retroactively the marriages of same-sex couples performed prior to its \neffective date.” Id. at 62. “[A]pplying ... well-established principles of interpretation relating to the question of retroactivity,” \nthe Court concluded that “Proposition 8 cannot be interpreted to apply retroactively so as to invalidate the marriages of \nsame-sex couples that occurred prior to the adoption of Proposition 8.” Id. at 65. Therefore, “[t]hose marriages remain valid \nin all respects.” Id. \n  \nMoreover, Strauss interpreted Proposition 8 in a “limited fashion” and construed the measure “as eliminating only the right \nof same-sex couples to equal access to the designation of marriage, and as not otherwise affecting the constitutional right of \nthose couples to establish an officially recognized family relationship.” Strauss v. Horton, 2009 WL 1444594 at 19. \n“Accordingly, ... those couples continue to possess ... ‘the core set of basic substantive legal rights and attributes traditionally \nassociated with marriage,’ including, ‘most fundamentally, the opportunity of an individual to establish--with the person with \nwhom the individual has chosen to share his or her life-an officially recognized and protected family possessing mutual rights \nand responsibilities and entitled to the same respect and dignity accorded a union traditionally designated as marriage.’ ” Id. \nat 20, quoting In re Marriage Cases, supra, 43 Cal. 4th at p. 781 (original emphasis). \n  \nIII. THE PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS. \n  \nPlaintiffs commenced this lawsuit on December 29, 2008 in the aftermath of Proposition 8 by filing their Complaint for \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief in Orange County Superior Court. The Complaint names the United States of America and \nthe State of California as defendants along with unnamed Does 1 through 1,000. On March 9, 2009, the United States \nremoved the action to the district court. \n  \nIn their complaint, Plaintiffs allege that “they are a same-sex couple who married lawfully within the State of California on or \nsubsequent to July 10, 2008.” (Compl., ¶2.) \n  \nMost of the substantive allegations of the complaint are directed at the DOMA and the United States, not Proposition 8 and \nthe State of California. (Compl., ¶¶ 6-8, 10-28.) With respect to the State of California, all of the substantive allegations \nappear in paragraph 29, which alleges: \n  \nDefendant, State of California, caused Proposition 8 to be published on the ballot for the November 4, 2008 election. \nProposition 8 amends the California Constitution to defined (sic) marriage as between a man and a woman and to prohibit \nsame gender marriage. As amended, the State of California Constitution violates the United States Constitution as follows: \nViolation of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses and violation of the Right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of \nHappiness. The prohibition further violates the right to be free from an undue invasion of the Right of Privacy; and violates \nthe Ninth Amendment Right of Reservation of all Rights not Enumerated to the People and the Right to Travel, and The \nRight of Free Speech. \n  \n(Compl., ¶ 29.) \n  \nThe complaint does not allege separate claims for relief, but the prayer asks for a declaration that Proposition 8 violates \nprovisions of the United States Constitution, including the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. (Compl. at p. 6 \n[prayer, ¶ 5].) Further, Plaintiffs ask for an injunction “mandating and compelling the State of California to eliminate from its \nConstitution the amendment which bans same gender marriage and defines marriage as between a man and woman \ncommonly known as Proposition 8.” (Id. at p. 7 [prayer, ¶ 6].) Finally, Plaintiffs ask for “an injunctive order mandating the \nuse of gender-neutral terms in all legislation affecting marriage.” (Id. at p. 7 [prayer, ¶ 7].) \n  \nWith respect to the DOMA claims, Plaintiffs appear to focus again on sections 2 and 3 (1 U.S.C. § 7; 28 U.S.C. § 1738C), the \nsubject of their earlier challenge. (Compl. at ¶¶ 15-16.) Plaintiffs allege that these sections violate various provisions of the \nU.S. Constitution. (Id. at ¶¶ 17-28.) They ask for a declaratory judgment that these provisions are unconstitutional. (Id. at p. 7 \n  5 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiff, v...., 2009 WL 1683905...   \n \n \n[prayer, ¶¶ 1-5].) \n  \nARGUMENT \nI. THE COURT MAY DISMISS A CLAIM FOR RELIEF PURSUANT TO RULE 12(B)(6) WHEN THE \nPLAINTIFF LACKS STANDING TO SUE. \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint may be dismissed for “failure to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted.” In the Ninth Circuit, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is the appropriate vehicle to attack a complaint that \nfails to allege standing. Sacks v. Office of Foreign Assets Control, 466 F. 3d 764, 771 (9th Cir. 2006) [“To survive a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, Sacks must allege facts in his Amended Complaint that, if proven, would confer standing upon \nhim.”] \n  \n“[A] Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim can be used when plaintiff has included allegations in the \ncomplaint that, on their face, disclose some absolute defense or bar to recovery.” Schwarzer, et. al., Federal Civ. Pro. Before \nTrial (The Rutter Group 2009) § 9:193, p. 9-34. On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, “[i]f the pleadings establish facts compelling a \ndecision one way, that is as good as if depositions and other expensively obtained evidence on summary judgment establishes \nthe identical facts.” Weisbach v. County of Los Angeles, 119 F. 3d 778, 783 fn. 1 (9th Cir. 1997). \n  \nHere, plaintiffs allege that they were lawfully married in California in July 2008 before the passage of Proposition 8. \nMoreover, their previous lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in August 2008, before passage of the measure, based in part \non the court’s finding that plaintiffs were in fact married following the In re Marriage Cases decision. Therefore, the \nquestion of Plaintiffs’ standing to challenge Proposition 8 at this time may be properly assessed under Rule 12(b)(6). \n  \nII. PLAINTIFFS LACK STANDING TO CHALLENGE PROPOSITION 8 BECAUSE CALIFORNIA LAW \nRECOGNIZES THEIR MARRIAGE AS VALID. \n“Article III of the Constitution limits the judicial power of the United States to the resolution of ‘cases’ and ‘controversies.’ ” \nCouncil of Insurance Agents & Brokers v. Molasky-Arman 522 F. 3d 925, 930 (9th Cir. 2008). “[P]arties cannot ‘invoke the \njudicial power of the United States in a case that does not present an actual case or controversy.’ ” Williams v. Boeing Co., \n517 F. 3d 1120, 1129 (9th Cir. 2008), Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 398 (1975). \n  \nThe doctrine of standing is one of the elements of justiciability in the federal courts, and “the core component of standing is \nan essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 \n(1992). The “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing” contains three elements: \nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an ‘injury in fact’--an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and \nparticularized, [cit. omit] and (b) “actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical’ ” [cit omit]. Second, there must be a \ncausal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of-the injury has to be “fairly ... traceable to the challenged \naction of the defendant, and not ... the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.” [Cit. omit.] \nThird, it must be “likely,” as opposed to merely “speculative,” that the injury will be “redressed by a favorable decision.” \n[Cit. omit.] \n   \nId. (internal brackets omitted). \n  \nHere, the complaint demonstrates that Plaintiffs cannot establish any of the core components of standing with respect to their \nclaims against the State of California. \n  \nWith respect to the first element, Plaintiffs have not suffered an “injury in fact” because Proposition 8, as interpreted by the \nCalifornia Supreme Court, has no effect on their marriage. In holding that Proposition 8 lacks retroactive effect, the \nCalifornia Supreme Court recognized that the estimated 18,000 same-sex marriages performed before the election, including \n  6 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiff, v...., 2009 WL 1683905...   \n \n \nPlaintiffs’ marriage, remain valid in all respects. See Strauss v. Horton, 2009 WL 1444594 at 65. Thus, plaintiffs’ legally \nprotected interest--their marriage-has not in any sense been invaded by the measure’s enactment. \n  \nThis conclusion is bolstered by the California Supreme Court’s determination that Proposition 8 did not alter any of the \nsubstantive rights of same-sex couples recognized by In re Marriage Cases other than the right to have their relationship \nlegally afforded the designation of marriage. Strauss v. Horton, 2009 WL 1444594 at 18-22. As noted above, although \nProposition 8 restricts the designation of marriage to opposite-sex couples only, “in all other respects same-sex couples retain \nthe same substantive protections ... as those accorded to opposite-sex couples.” Id at 22. Unlike unmarried same-sex couples, \nPlaintiffs retain the only right impacted by Proposition 8--the designation of marriage--while also retaining all of the rights \nleft uninfringed by the measure. \n  \nMoreover, Plaintiffs’ inability to satisfy the injury-in-fact element is virtually compelled by the district court’s determination \nthat their marriage mooted the prior lawsuit. (See Request for Judicial Notice, Order Dismissing Case.) Previously, the \ndistrict court held that In re Marriage Cases and the Plaintiffs’ subsequent marriage mooted their claims against the State. \n(Id. at p. 2). Plaintiffs are in no different situation today. They retain all of the substantive rights that were left unaffected by \nProposition 8 and retain the designation of marriage that was not retroactively altered by Proposition 8. Thus, for the same \nreasons their earlier challenge to California marriage laws was rendered moot, Plaintiffs’ challenge to Proposition 8 falters \nfor lack of an injury-in-fact that would support standing. \n  \nThe fact that unmarried same-sex couples might have sufficient standing to challenge the constitutionality of Proposition 8 \ndoes nothing to confer standing on Plaintiffs. “The claim must be for injury to plaintiff’s own legal rights and interests, rather \nthan the legal or interests of third parties.” Schwarzer, § 2:1207, p. 2E-3 (original emphasis); accord: Warth v. Seldin, 422 \nU.S. 491, 499, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 [“[E]ven when the plaintiff has alleged injury sufficient to meet the ‘case or \ncontroversy’ requirement, this Court has held that the plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and \ncannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.”] \n  \nThe absence of an injury-in-fact disposes of the remaining elements of causation and redressability. Without a cognizable \ninjury, Plaintiffs cannot establish a connection between an actionable harm and any act of the defendant. And Plaintiffs do \nnot seek any relief that would redress any harm actually suffered by them. As the United States Supreme Court has said: \n“Relief that does not remedy the injury suffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court; that is the very essence of the \nredressability requirement.” Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 107, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d \n210 (1998). Plaintiffs will be in the identical situation-married with rights recognized by California Supreme Court--whether \nthe court overturns Proposition 8 under the U.S. Constitution or upholds it. Plainly, standing may not rest on such shallow \nground. \n  \nPlaintiffs’ allegation that the “refusal of all states and jurisdictions of the United States of America” to recognize their \nmarriage has resulted “in the denial of hundreds of state law rights, benefits and responsibilities, and more than a thousand \nfederal rights, benefits, and responsibilities” is insufficient to confer standing. (Compl. at ¶ 3.) This conclusory allegation is \nplainly directed to the DOMA claims, not the Proposition 8 claims; it would make little sense to allege that Plaintiffs are be \ndenied rights under California law by Proposition 8 when the California Supreme Court has expressly held otherwise. \nMoreover, Plaintiffs fail to allege that the State of California or any state actor has failed to recognize the legitimacy of their \nmarriage or has denied them any benefit available under state law. \n  \nBecause Plaintiffs cannot establish any of the essential elements of standing, their complaint must be dismissed. Moreover, \nbecause no allegation consistent with the pleading could possibly cure this deficiency, the state respectfully submits that the \nmotion to dismiss should be granted without leave to amend. See Schreiber Distributing Co. v. Serv-Well Furniture Co., 806 \nF. 2d 1393, 1401 (9th Cir. 1986) [recognizing that a court need not grant leave where “the allegation of other facts consistent \nwith the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency.”] \n  \nCONCLUSION \nAs a couple who allege that they were lawfully married before the passage of Proposition 8, a measure the California \nSupreme Court has held does not retroactively apply to marriages performed before its approval by the voters, Plaintiffs lack \n  7 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiff, v...., 2009 WL 1683905...   \n \n \nstanding to challenge its validity under the U.S. Constitution.

Cramin. \nINTRODUCTION \n  \n1. Jurisdiction is proper in the California State Superior Court because the State of California is a defendant and the \nConstitution of the State of California is at issue. Original federal question jurisdiction of this Court is proper pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. Jurisdiction for declaratory and injunctive relief is proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and \nRule 65 Fed. R. Civ. Proc. \n  \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n2. Plaintiffs are a same-sex couple who married lawfully within the State of California on or subsequent to July 10, 2008. A \ntrue and correct copy of the License and Certificate of Marriage is attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit “A”. \n  \n3. The refusal of all states and jurisdictions of the United States of America to recognize the validity of Plaintiffs’ lawful \nmarriage results in the denial of hundreds of state law rights, benefits and responsibilities, and more than a thousand federal \nrights, benefits, and responsibilities, that are automatically bestowed upon opposite-gender couples who marry in every state \nor jurisdiction of the United States of America that refuses to recognize the validity of Plaintiffs’ lawful marriage. \n  \n4.  Some  of  these  automatic  rights,  benefits  and  responsibilities  are:  The  right  to  social  security  survivor  benefits; \n  1 \n \n\nArthur SMELT et al, v. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA et al., 2009 WL 1471476 (2009)   \n \n \ndecision-making authority for funeral arrangements and disposition of the body; the right to bereavement leave in the event \nof a partner’s death; the presumption that both spouses are the legal parents of a child born during marriage; and, the right to \ncommunity property, and a share of separate property, upon the death of a partner who dies intestate. \n  \n5.  Denial  of  the  recognition  of  Plaintiffs’  lawful  marriage  has  caused  Plaintiffs  to  suffer  severe  emotional  distress, \nhumiliation, mental anguish. a loss of liberty and the pursuit of happiness, a denial of equal protection of the laws, a denial of \ndue process of law, a denial of the exercise of freedom of speech, a denial of freedom of association, a denial of privacy \nrights, and a denial of the right to travel to establish residency anywhere in the United States with full recognition of the \nlegality of Plaintiffs’ marriage. \n  \n6. The Federal Definition of Marriage Act (1 U.S.C. § 7) is gender-specific, defining marriage as between one man and one \nwoman at the exclusion of same-gender couples and is, therefore, unconstitutional. \n  \n7. Federal law provides that States do not have to recognize or give effect to legal relationships of same-gender couples that \nare treated as a marriage under the laws of another state (28 U.S.C. § 1738c), and, therefore, restricting same-gender couples’ \nrights to specific jurisdictions, in contrast to opposite-sex couples, is unconstitutional. \n  \n8. In this lawsuit, Plaintiffs ask for a permanent injunction compelling the Defendants to take all necessary acts to require the \nentire nation of the United States of America, all of its territories and jurisdictions, to eliminate any distinction in the law that \nprejudices the rights of Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs further seek declaratory judgment establishing any law that restricts Plaintiffs’ \nrights or distinguishes Plaintiffs’ rights in any way from any opposite gender married couple to be unconstitutional, under the \nUnited States Constitution, including all provisions of the Federal Defense of Marriage Act. 1 U.S.C. § 7 and its sub-parts \n  \nPARTIES \n9. Plaintiffs are Arthur Bruno Smelt and Christopher David Hammer. Plaintiffs have been in a committed relationship since \nJanuary 1,1997. Plaintiffs have exchanged wedding rings and participated in a marriage ceremony in 1997 as a demonstration \nof their love and affection for one another, their desire to be married spouses, and a family unit forever. As a further \ndemonstration of Plaintiffs’ love and affection for one another, Plaintiffs applied for and received a Declaration of Domestic \nPartnership from the State of California dated January 10,2000. Plaintiffs reside in Orange County, California. \n  \n10. Defendant is the United States of America. Defendant refuses to give legal recognition to Plaintiffs’ marriage license \nsolely based on gender. Plaintiffs are a same-sex couple who married lawfully within the State of California on or subsequent \nto July 10,2008. A true and correct copy of the License and Certificate of Marriage is attached hereto and incorporated herein \nas Exhibit “A”. \n  \n11. Defendants are the United States of America and DOES 1 through 1,000. \n  \n12. Plaintiffs are ignorant of the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate or otherwise of \nDefendants sued herein as DOES 1 through 1,000, inclusive, and therefore sues said Defendants by such fictitious names and \nwill amend this Complaint to show their true names and capacities when ascertained. \n  \n13. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that at all times herein mentioned, Defendants, and each of them, \nwere agents, servants, and employees of each of the remaining Co-defendants and were acting within the course and scope of \nsaid agency and employment and with the consent and permission of each of the remaining Co-defendants. \n  \n14. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that each of said Defendants is responsible in some manner for the \nevents alleged herein and negligently and proximately caused injuries and damage to Plaintiff as hereinafter set forth. \n  \n15. The Federal Definition of Marriage Act (1 U.S.C. § 7) defines the words “marriage” to mean “only a legal union between \none man and one woman as husband and wife,” and “spouse” to refer to “only a person of the opposite sex who is a husband \nor a wife.” \n  \n  2 \n \n\nArthur SMELT et al, v. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA et al., 2009 WL 1471476 (2009)   \n \n \n16. Federal law provides that “no state... of the United States... may be required to give effect to any public act, record, or \njudicial proceeding of any other state... respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage \nunder the laws of such other state... arising from such relationship” (28 U.S.C. § 1738c). \n  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n17. The Federal Defense of Marriage Act, Title 1 U.S.C. §7 and all its sub-parts, violate the individual constitutional rights as \nprescribed by the United States Constitution, to wit: Violation of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses and violation \nof the Right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. The prohibition further violates the right to be free from an undue \ninvasion of the Right of Privacy; and violates the Ninth Amendment Right of Reservation of all Rights not Enumerated to the \nPeople, and the Right to Travel, and The Right of Free Speech, \n  \n18. The Federal Defense of Marriage Act, Title 1 U.S.C. §7 and all its sub-parts, violate the liberty interests protected by the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (42 U.S.C. § 1983). \n  \n19. The Federal Defense of Marriage Act, Title 1 U.S.C. §7 and all its sub-parts, violates and discriminates on the basis of \ngender in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (42 U.S.C. § 1983). \n  \n20. The Federal Defense of Marriage Act, Title 1 U.S.C. §7 and all its sub-parts, violates and discriminates on the basis of \nsexual orientation in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (42 U.S.C. § 1983). \n  \n21. The Federal Defense of Marriage Act, Title 1 U.S.C. §7 and all its sub-parts, violates the privacy interests protected by \nthe Right to Privacy (Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)). \n  \n22. The Federal Defense of Marriage Act, Title 1 U.S.C. §7 and all its sub-parts, additionally violates the Full Faith and \nCredit Clause of Article Five of the United States Constitution (28 U.S.C. § 1738). \n  \n23. The Federal Definition of Marriage Act (28 U.S.C. 1738c), if concluded to exclude same-gender couples, violates the \nindividual constitutional rights as prescribed by the United States Constitution. \n  \n24. The Acts violate the liberty interests protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (42 U.S.C. § \n1983). \n  \n25. The Acts discriminate on the basis of gender in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983). \n  \n26. The Acts discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation in violation of Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment (42 U.S.C. § 1983). \n  \n27. The Acts violate the privacy interests protected by the Right to Privacy (Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)). \n  \n28. Federal law providing that “no state... of the United States... may be required to give effect to any public act, record, or \njudicial proceeding of any other state... respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage \nunder the laws of such other state...arising from such relationship” (28 U.S.C. § 1738c) is unconstitutional violating Due \nProcess Clause (42 U.S.C. § 1983), the Equal Protection Clause (42 U.S.C. § 1983), and the Right to Privacy (Griswold v. \nConnecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)) of the same-gender couple, and the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States \nConstitution (28 U.S.C. § 1738). \n  \n29. Defendant, State of California, caused Proposition 8 to be published on the ballot for the November 4,2008 election. \nProposition 8 amends the California Constitution to defined marriage as between a man and a woman and to prohibit same \ngender marriage. As amended, the State of California Constitution violates the United States Constitution as follows: \nViolation of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses and violation of the Right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of \nHappiness. The prohibition further violates the right to be free from an undue invasion of the Right of Privacy; and violates \n  3 \n \n\nArthur SMELT et al, v. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA et al., 2009 WL 1471476 (2009)   \n \n \nthe Ninth Amendment Right of Reservation of all Rights not Enumerated to the People, and the Right to Travel, and The \nRight of Free Speech. \n  \n“FREEDOM MEANS FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE” \nVice President Cheney \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray, and respectfully request that the Court enter judgment: \n  \n1.

Plaintiffs’ Opposition To The Motion To Intervene Was Untimely. \nLocal Rule 7-9 requires that all opposing papers shall be filed “not later than ... fourteen (14) days before the date designated \nfor the hearing of the motion ....” The hearing for the Motion to Intervene is scheduled for May 11, 2009, but Plaintiffs’ \nOpposition to Motion to Intervene was not dated until May 1, 2009, which is after the 14-day deadline. (It is unclear when \nPlaintiffs filed their Opposition, but Proposed Intervenors did not receive it until May 5, 2009, which explains why Proposed \nIntervenors did not file this reply memorandum until May 6, 2009.) Thus, Plaintiffs opposing papers were untimely. \n  \nLocal Rule 7-12 prescribes two possible consequences for a party’s failure to file his opposing papers within the relevant \ndeadline. First, “[t]he Court may decline to consider any memorandum or other paper not filed within the deadline set by \norder or local rule.” Id. Or “the failure to file [papers] within the deadline[] may be deemed consent to the granting ... of the \nmotion.” Id. Proposed Intervenors ask that the Court refuse to consider Plaintiffs’ Opposition to the Motion to Intervene or, \nalternatively, deem Plaintiffs to have consented to the request. \n  \nII. Plaintiffs Do Not Address The Relevant Legal Principles. \nIn their opposing papers, Plaintiffs argue only that Proposed Intervenors should not be allowed to intervene because they do \nnot present a “unique legal argument.” The relevant legal standard for mandatory intervention, however, does not focus on \nwhether Proposed Intervenors will present a “unique legal argument,” but instead on the following four requirements: (1) the \nintervention motion must be timely filed; (2) the applicant must have a “significantly protectable” interest relating to the \nsubject of the action; (3) a showing that the disposition of the action might, as a practical matter, impair the applicant’s ability \nto protect its interest; and (4) a showing that the applicant’s interest might be inadequately represented by the existing parties. \nSw. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 817-18 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Nw. Forest Res. Council v. Glickman, \n82 F.3d 825, 836 (9th Cir. 1996)). Plaintiffs do not specifically address these factors. \n  \nBy objecting to the alleged lack of “uniqueness” in Proposed Intervenors’ likely arguments, Plaintiffs contest only one \nconsideration under one of the four mandatory intervention factors-the adequacy of representation by existing parties. \nPlaintiffs thus apparently concede that Proposed Intervenors have satisfied the other three factors. \n  2 \n \n\nArthur SMELT et al., Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES OF..., 2009 WL 1683904...   \n \n \n  \nIII. Proposed Intervenors Will Present “Unique” Legal Arguments, And Their Interests Are Not Adequately \nRepresented By Existing Parties. \nIt is important to clarify an incorrect assertion in Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Motion to Intervene. Plaintiffs state that Proposed \nIntervenors “previously intervene[d] in this same case.” But Proposed Intervenors have never before intervened in this case. \nPlaintiffs apparently believe that Proposed Intervenors are the same persons and organization who intervened in the \npreviously litigated case, Smelt v. County of Orange, No. SACV 04-1042 GLT (MLGx). But they are not. \n  \nProposed Intervenors demonstrated in their Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Intervene the \nmany reasons why their interests are inadequately represented by the existing parties. In doing so, Proposed Intervenors have \nshown, among other things, that they will present arguments that will likely differ from those asserted by the existing parties. \nThat assertion is not based on speculation, but is supported from past experience. \n  \nIn 2000, Californians enacted a statutory initiative that defined “marriage,” like Proposition 8 does, as a union between “a \nman and a woman.” Cal. Fam. Code § 308.5 (2000). California Attorney General, Edmund G. Brown, unsuccessfully \ndefended that statute against state constitutional attack. See In re Marriage Cases, 43 Cal.4th 757, 76 Cal.Rptr.3d 683 (Cal. \n2008). When litigating that case, he presented only two state interests for defining marriage as the union of a man and a \nwoman: (1) the government’s interest in maintaining its longstanding definition of marriage; and (2) its interest in affirming \nthe will of its citizens. See Answer Brief of State of California and the Attorney General to Opening Brief on the Merits, In re \nMarriage Cases, No. S147999, at pp. 43-54 (attached to Proposed Intervenors’ Memorandum of Points and Authorities in \nSupport of Motion to Intervene as Exhibit L). Here, Proposed Intervenors intend to argue additional state interests including \nbut not limited to: promoting stability in relationships between a man and a woman because they naturally (and at times \naccidentally) produce children; and promoting the statistically optimal child-rearing household where children are raised by \nboth a mother and a father. The Attorney General has proven unwilling to argue these state interests, which have been found \nby other courts to satisfy constitutional review. See, e.g., Hernandez v. Robles, 7 N.Y.3d 338, 855 N.E.2d 1 (N.Y. 2006). \nImportantly, the Attorney General does not dispute that he will not address these additional arguments raised by Proposed \nIntervenors. \n  \nNot only has Attorney General Brown proven unwilling to make arguments that Proposed Intervenors plan to present, his \nview  of  Proposition  8  is  different  from  that  of  Proposed  Intervenors-specifically,  he  believes  that  Proposition  8  is \nunconstitutional. In the suit currently pending before the California Supreme Court, Attorney General Brown argues that \n“Proposition 8 should be invalidated ... because it abrogates fundamental rights ... without a compelling interest.” See Answer \nBrief in Response to Petition for Extraordinary Relief, Strauss v. Horton, No. S168047, at p. 75 (attached to Proposed \nIntervenors’ Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Intervene as Exhibit K). The Attorney \nGeneral’s deputy communicated this message more pointedly at oral argument, when he identified himself as a “challenger” \nto  Proposition  8.  See  California  Supreme  Court  Website,  Proposition  8  Cases,  available  at  http:// \nwww.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/prop8.htm (linking to audio and video coverage of the oral argument). The \nAttorney General has not disputed these facts. This Court should thus conclude that a self-identified “challenger” to \nProposition 8 will not adequately represent the interests of Proposed Intervenors, who diligently labored for its enactment. \n  \nCONCLUSION \nProposed Intervenors have satisfied the requirements for both mandatory and permissive intervention. The California \nAttorney General will not adequately represent Proposed Intervenors’ interests because he has argued that Proposition 8 \nshould be invalidated, and he will not present all Proposed Intervenors’ arguments. This Court should thus allow Proposed \nIntervenors to intervene in this action. \n  \nDated: May 6, 2009 \n  \n/s/Brian W. Raum \n  \n  3 \n \n\nArthur SMELT et al., Plaintiffs, v.

See HB \n436, An Act Relative to Civil Marriage & Civil Unions, 2009 N.H. Laws ch. 59; LD 1020, An Act To End Discrimination in \nCivil Marriage & Affirm Religious Freedom, 2009 Me. Legis. Serv. ch. 82 (West); S. 115, An Act to Protect Religious \nFreedom & Recognize Equality in Civil Marriage, 2009 Vt. Acts & Resolves no. 3; Varnum v. Brien, 763 N.W.2d 862 (Iowa \n2009); Kerrigan v. Comm’r of Pub. Health, 957 A.2d 407 (Conn. 2008); Good-ridge v. Dep’t of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941 \n(Mass. 2003). Yet, as same-sex couples in these States have won what they understandably view as a vital personal right of \nsurpassing importance to their happiness and well-being, other States have reaffirmed the traditional understanding of \nmarriage as the union of a man and a woman as husband and wife, see Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 878 n.5 - an understanding \nheld as a matter of profound moral and religious conviction by many of their citizens. \n  \n  10 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \nThis case does not call upon the Court to pass judgment, however, on the legal or moral right of same-sex couples, such as \nplaintiffs here, to be married. Plaintiffs are married, and their challenge to the federal Defense of Marriage Act (“DOMA”) \nposes  a  different  set  of  questions:  whether  by  virtue  of  their  marital  status  they  are  constitutionally  entitled  to \nacknowledgment of their union by States that do not recognize same-sex marriage, and whether they are similarly entitled to \ncertain federal benefits. Under the law binding on this Court, the answer to these questions must be no. \n  \nDOMA reflects a cautiously limited response to society’s still-evolving understanding of the institution of marriage. \nCongress passed DOMA in 1996, at a time when States and their citizens were just beginning to address the legal status of \nsame-sex marriage. Consistent with our federalist system, which allows each State to “serve as a laboratory[,] and try novel \nsocial and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country,” New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311, \n52 S. Ct. 371, 76 L.Ed. 747 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), DOMA does not address whether a same-sex couple may marry \nwithin the United States. Instead, it permits the citizens of each State to decide that question for themselves. To preserve the \nautonomy of the States in this area, therefore, Section 2 of DOMA provides that each State may decide whether to recognize \na same-sex marriage performed under the law of another State. \n  \nSection 3, in turn, addresses the effects of new State definitions of marriage on federal programs that tie entitlement to certain \nbenefits to married status. Congress had long conferred various financial and other benefits on the basis of marriage in light \nof the central role the institution has played in advancing a variety of societal interests. When States began to consider \nadopting historically novel forms of marriage, Congress took a wait-and-see approach. It codified, for purposes of federal \nbenefits, a definition of marriage that all fifty states had adopted (i.e., that between a man and a woman) and continued to \naccord financial and other benefits on the basis of that historical definition. At the same time, it cautiously declined to extend \nfederal benefits on the basis of a newer definition of marriage that no States had adopted at the time of DOMA’s passage (and \nonly a very small minority of States have since). Thus, by defining “marriage” and “spouse” as the legal union of a man and a \nwoman and affording federal benefits on that basis, Section 3 of DOMA simply maintained the status quo: it continues the \nlongstanding federal policy of affording federal benefits and privileges on the basis of a centuries-old form of marriage, \nwithout committing the federal government to devote scarce resources to newer versions of the institution that any State may \nchoose to recognize. \n  \nThe plaintiffs in this case, a same-sex couple married under the laws of California, make a number of claims against DOMA. \nSpecifically, they allege that Section 2 violates the Full Faith and Credit Clause and their “right to travel,” that both sections \nof DOMA violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (including its equal protection component) and their “right \nto privacy,” and that Section 3 violates their “right of free speech” and their “rights” under the Ninth Amendment. Plaintiffs \ninitially filed this action in State court, and the defendant United States removed it to this Court. \n  \nRather than reaching the merits of these claims, the Court should dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, for \ntwo reasons. First, a federal court has no more jurisdiction in a removed case than did the State court before removal, and the \nUnited States was immune from suit on plaintiffs’ claims in State court. All claims against the United States should be \ndismissed on that basis alone. Second, even in absence of that principle, plaintiffs lack standing to challenge either Section 2 \nor Section 3 of DOMA. Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge Section 2, because they nowhere allege that they have actually \nbeen denied any rights or benefits under the laws of another State resulting from the refusal of that State to acknowledge their \nmarital status. They lack standing as well to challenge Section 3 of DOMA, because they do not allege that the federal \ndefinitions of “marriage” and “spouse” in Section 3 have ever been applied to them for purposes of any federal law. Plaintiffs \nfail to allege that they have ever applied for any federal benefits that are available on the basis of married status - let alone \nthat they have been denied any as a result of DOMA. Because they have not been injured by Section 3’s definitions, their \nchallenge to this provision must be dismissed for lack of standing. \n  \nOn the merits, plaintiffs’ claims that DOMA violates the Full Faith and Credit Clause and their “right to travel” both fail as a \nmatter of law. In allowing each State to withhold its recognition of same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions, \nCongress was merely confirming longstanding conflict-of-laws principles in a valid exercise of its express power to settle \nsuch questions under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. That Clause ensures that each State retains the authority to decline to \napply another State’s law when it conflicts with its own public policies. DOMA is fully consistent with that constitutional \nprinciple, as it permits States to experiment with and maintain the exclusivity of their own legitimate public policies - such as \nwhether that State chooses to recognize or reject same-sex marriages. Similarly, in relation to plaintiffs’ purported “right to \ntravel” claim, DOMA simply does not impinge upon anyone’s ability to travel among the States. Again, it merely permits \n  11 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \neach State to follow its own policy with respect to marriage. \n  \nPlaintiffs’ due process and equal protection claims also must be dismissed. Like all federal statutes, DOMA is entitled to a \npresumption of constitutionality. Because DOMA does not restrict any rights that have been recognized as fundamental or \nrely on any suspect classifications, it need not be reviewed with heightened scrutiny. Properly understood, the right at issue in \nthis case is not a right to marry. After all, the federal government does not, either through DOMA or any other federal statute, \nissue marriage licenses or determine the standards for who may or may not get married. Indeed, as noted above - and as \nevidenced by the fact that plaintiffs have married in California - DOMA in no way prohibits same-sex couples from \nmarrying. Instead, the only right at issue in this case is a right to receive certain benefits on the basis of a same-sex marriage. \nNo court has ever found such a right to federal benefits on that basis to be fundamental - in fact, all of the courts that have \nconsidered the question have rejected such a claim. (And even if the right at issue in this case were the right to same-sex \nmarriage, current Supreme Court precedent that binds this Court does not recognize such a right under the Constitution.) \nLikewise, DOMA does not discriminate, or permit the States to discriminate, on the basis of a suspect classification; indeed, \nthe Ninth Circuit has held that sexual orientation is not a suspect classification. \n  \nDOMA therefore must be analyzed under rational-basis review. Under the highly deferential rational basis standard, \nmoreover, a court may not act as superlegislature, sitting in judgment on the wisdom or morality of a legislative policy. \nInstead, a legislative policy must be upheld so long as there is any reasonably conceivable set of facts that could provide a \nrational basis for it, including ones that the Congress itself did not advance or consider. DOMA satisfies this standard. \n  \nIndividuals are born into, or form, a broad spectrum of human relationships, founded in kinship or affection, whether of \nspouses, siblings, parent and child, cousins, companions, partners, or otherwise. Yet of all these relationships, Congress has \nlong extended certain federal benefits and protections on the basis of just one - that between a husband and wife (and their \nminor children). Congress is entitled under the Constitution to address issues of social reform on a piecemeal, or incremental, \nbasis. It was therefore permitted to maintain the unique privileges it has afforded to this one relationship without immediately \nextending the same privileges, and scarce government resources, to new forms of marriage that States have only recently \nbegun to recognize. Its cautious decision simply to maintain the federal status quo while preserving the ability of States to \nexperiment with new definitions of marriage is entirely rational. Congress may subsequently decide to extend federal benefits \nto same-sex marriages, but its decision to reserve judgment on the question does not render any differences in the availability \nof federal benefits irrational or unconstitutional. \n  \nFinally, plaintiffs’ other claims must be dismissed as well. First, DOMA does not impinge on plaintiffs’ ability to express \ntheir views and therefore does not violate their First Amendment rights. In any event, marriage (whether same-sex or \nheterosexual) does not constitute expressive conduct under the First Amendment. Second, the right to privacy encompasses \nonly rights that are constitutionally fundamental, and, as noted earlier, the right to receive benefits on the basis of same-sex \nmarriage (as well as same-sex marriage itself) has not been recognized by the courts as a fundamental right. Third, plaintiffs \ncannot plead a claim under the Ninth Amendment because that provision is not an independent source of rights. \n  \nAccordingly, all of plaintiffs’ claims against the United States in this action should be dismissed. \n  \nSTATUTORY BACKGROUND \nIn 1996, Congress enacted, and President Clinton signed into law, the Defense of Marriage Act, Pub. L. No. 104-199, 110 \nStat. 2419 (1996). Section 2 of DOMA provides that “[n]o State ... shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or \njudicial proceeding of any other State ... respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a \nmarriage under the laws of such other State.” 28 U.S.C. § 1738C. Section 3 of DOMA defines the terms “marriage” and \n“spouse,” for purposes of federal law, to include only the union of one man and one woman. Specifically, it provides that: \nIn determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the \nvarious administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word “marriage” means only a legal \nunion between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word “spouse” refers only to a \nperson of the opposite sex who is a husband or wife. \n   \n  12 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \n1 U.S.C. § 7. \n  \nThe House Judiciary Committee issued a report describing the background and purposes of DOMA. As the Committee \nexplained, DOMA was enacted following the decision in Baehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993), in which a plurality of \nthe Hawaii Supreme Court concluded that the definition of marriage under Hawaii law (as the union of one man and one \nwoman) might warrant heightened scrutiny under the State constitution. See H.R. Rep. No. 104-664, at 2, reprinted in 1996 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2905, 2906. In response, Congress sought both to “preserve [ ] each State’s ability to decide” what should \nconstitute a marriage under its own laws and to “lay[ ] down clear rules” regarding what constitutes a marriage for purposes \nof federal law. Id. In enacting Section 2 of DOMA, Congress relied on its “express grant of authority,” under the second \nsentence of the Constitution’s Full Faith and Credit Clause, “to prescribe the effect that public acts, records, and proceedings \nfrom one State shall have in sister States.” Id. at 25, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2930. That provision, said the \nCommittee, empowers Congress to “resolv[e] conflicts” between the enactments of the different States, id., and Section 2 of \nDOMA does so by preserving the power of the States to decline to give effect to the laws of other States respecting same-sex \nmarriage. \n  \nThe House Judiciary Committee went on to state that Section 3 of DOMA merely codifies, for purposes of federal law, the \ndefinition of marriage set forth in “the standard law dictionary.” Id. at 29, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2935 (citing \nBlack’s Law Dictionary 972 (6th ed. 1990)). In explaining  why  Congress chose to limit federal  marital benefits to \nopposite-sex couples, the Committee acknowledged that “[t]here are relations of deep, abiding love” between persons of all \nkinds, “brothers and sisters, parents and children, grandparents and grandchildren,” that “cannot be diminished as loves [just] \nbecause they are not ... expressed in marriage.” Id. at 13, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2917 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). Nevertheless, the Committee stressed, DOMA grants  “preferred legal status” to a particular kind of loving \nrelationship - heterosexual marriage - based on four asserted government interests. Id. at 12, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. \nat 2916. First, the Committee advanced an interest in “defending and nurturing the institution of traditional, heterosexual \nmarriage” because of the role it plays in “procreation and child-rearing.” Id. at 12, 15, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at \n2916, 2919. Second, the Committee believed that DOMA furthered Congress’s asserted interest in “traditional notions of \nmorality.” Id. at 15, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2919. Third, the Committee maintained that DOMA advances the \ngovernment’s  interest in  “protecting  state  sovereignty  and  democratic  self-governance.”  Id.  at  16,  reprinted  in  1996 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 2920. Fourth, the Committee explained that DOMA advances the government’s interest in “preserving \nscarce government resources.” Id. at 18, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2922. \n  \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nPlaintiffs first challenged DOMA in an action filed in this Court on September 1, 2004, Arthur Bruno Smelt, et al. v. County \nof Orange, California, et al., Case No. SACV04-1042 GLT (MLGx). In that action, they alleged that DOMA violated the \nDue Process Clause, principles of Equal Protection, and the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Ruling on cross-motions for \nsummary judgment, this Court held that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge Section 2 of DOMA. The Court’s reasoning \nwas two-fold: First, because plaintiffs were not married at the time under the law of any State, there was no “public act... \nrespecting a relationship between persons of the same sex” to which the statute could apply. Smelt v. County of Orange, 374 \nF. Supp. 2d 861, 870-71 (C.D. Cal. 2005) [hereinafter Smelt I]; see 28 U.S.C. § 1738C. And second, since plaintiffs did not \n“claim to have plans to seek recognition of their eventual California marriage in another state,” they had not established an \n“imminent injury” due to Section 2. 374 F. Supp. at 871. The Court then addressed the merits of Section 3 (the definitional \nsection) and rejected all of plaintiffs’ challenges, holding that Section 3 does not discriminate on the basis of a suspect \nclassification, that it does not impinge upon a right held by the courts as fundamental, and that it is “rationally related to the \nlegitimate government interest[s]” that Congress identified in enacting DOMA. 374 F. Supp. 2d at 880. \n  \nPlaintiffs appealed, and the Ninth Circuit held that they lacked standing to challenge either section of DOMA. Smelt v. \nCounty of Orange, 447 F.3d 673 (9th Cir. 2006) [hereinafter Smelt II]. As to Section 2, the court essentially agreed with this \nCourt’s rationale. See id. at 683. In relation to Section 3, the appellate court reasoned: \nDOMA itself simply does not injure [the plaintiffs] or exclude them from some undefined benefit to \nwhich they might have been or might someday be entitled. In fact, they do not suggest that they have \napplied for any federal benefits, much less been denied any at this point. That they might someday be \nmarried under the law of some state or ask for some federal benefit which they are denied is not enough. \nIn short, they have not spelled out a legally protected interest, much less one that was injured in a \n  13 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \nconcrete and particularized way. \n   \nId. at 684 (citations omitted). The court also noted, in addition to this holding regarding constitutional standing, that plaintiffs \nlacked prudential standing because their challenge constituted a “generalized grievance [ ] pervasively shared,” such that \n“[a]ny citizen or taxpayer could as easily claim that some application or other of the DOMA definition to some as yet \nundesignated statute, which confers some public benefit or right, might exclude that person because DOMA requires a legal \nunion, a man, and a woman.” Id. at 684, 685. On remand, this Court dismissed the case on August 29, 2008, as directed by \nthe Court of Appeals. \n  \nThe plaintiffs then filed a new Complaint challenging DOMA on November 3, 2008, this time including an allegation that \nthey had married under California law. The proposed Complaint in that matter, docketed as Case No. SACV08-01244 UA, \ncontained the same claims against DOMA as the Complaint herein, and named as defendants the United States of America \nand “Does 1 through 1,000.” That Complaint was submitted with plaintiffs’ Requests to Proceed in Forma Pauperis, which \nThe Honorable Alicemarie H. Stotler denied on November 26, 2008. That matter (Case No. SACV08-01244 UA) has now \nbeen closed. \n  \nPlaintiffs filed the present Complaint in the Superior Court of California for the County of Orange on December 29, 2008, \nnaming as defendants the United States, the State of California, and “Does 1 through 1,000.” The Complaint filed in State \ncourt is identical to the Complaint submitted earlier in this Court,1 except for the addition of the State of California as a \ndefendant and several sentences related to the new defendant. Plaintiffs filed applications for waivers of fees and costs in \nState court, and those applications were granted. See Attachment 1 hereto.2 \n Footnotes \n \n1  Plaintiffs allege that they were married in California on July 10, 2008, see Complaint ¶ 10 -- that is, approximately four months \nbefore the addition of Article 1, Section 7.5, to the State constitution, which declares that “[o]nly marriage between a man and a \nwoman is valid or recognized in California.” The California Supreme Court has rejected challenges to this new constitutional \nprovision, but has declared that same-sex marriages contracted before its enactment remain valid. See Strauss v. Horton, 207 P.3d \n48 (Cal. May 26, 2009). \n \n \nThe United States, upon learning of the action in State court, filed a Notice of Removal in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § \n1442(a)(1) (Doc. #1). The parties thereafter stipulated that defendants’ responses to the Complaint would be due on June 11, \n2009 (Doc. #14), and the Court entered an Order pursuant to such stipulation on May 21, 2009 (Doc. # 20). \n  \nARGUMENT \nI. This Court Lacks Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Claims Against the United States Because the State Court Lacked \nJurisdiction \nAfter removal of a case from State court, the district court must determine the scope of its jurisdiction. See FBI v. Superior \nCourt of Cal., 507 F. Supp. 2d 1082, 1090 (N.D. Cal. 2007). When a case is “removed from state court pursuant to [28 \nU.S.C.] § 1442, [the federal court’s] jurisdiction is derivative of the state court’s jurisdiction.” See In re Elko County Grand \nJury, 109 F.3d 554, 555 (9th Cir. 1997). In other words, a federal court, after removal, “has no more jurisdiction than the \nstate court” did before removal. See Salveson v. Western States Bankcard Ass’n, 731 F.2d 1423, 1431 (9th Cir. 1984). Thus, \n“if the state court from which [a case] was removed lacked subject matter jurisdiction,” then the federal court will also lack \njurisdiction, “even though the federal court would have had jurisdiction had the suit been brought there originally.” See FBI \nv. Superior Court of Cal., 507 F. Supp. 2d at 1090 (quoting Beeman v. Olson, 828 F.2d 620, 621 (9th Cir.1987)); see also \nGlass v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., 570 F. Supp. 2d 1180, 1183 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (“This Court agrees with the \ndiscussion and holding in FBI, 507 F. Supp. 2d at 1090-92, that the derivative jurisdiction doctrine is alive and well and \napplies to 28 U.S.C. § 1442 removals.”).3 \n 2  The State court entered form orders on both applications (Attachment 1 hereto). On both orders, the court checked the box \n  14 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \nindicating “It is ordered that the application is granted in whole.” On the order regarding plaintiff Hammer’s request, another box \nwas also checked -- contradictorily and apparently in error -- indicating that he would be required to pay certain fees. \n \n \nIn this case, the Superior Court of California for the County of Orange lacked jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims against the \nUnited States before removal. “[T]he United States has sovereign immunity and may only be sued where it has waived that \nimmunity, subject to conditions on such waiver.” Glass, id. at 1183. Absent a waiver of immunity, the United States is \nimmune from suit in State courts. See Powelson v. United States, 150 F.3d 1103, 1105 (9th Cir. 1998) (dismissing removed \nmatter where “[t]he government [had] not waived its immunity from suit in state courts”); Nebraska v. Bentson, 146 F.3d \n676, 679 (9th Cir. 1998) (“Without an express waiver of the IRS’s sovereign immunity as an agency of the United States, the \nstate court lacked jurisdiction.”). Counsel for the United States is aware of no waiver of sovereign immunity that would have \napplied to plaintiffs’ claims against the United States in the Superior Court of California, and the Complaint in this action \nsuggests no such waiver. Accordingly, the State court lacked jurisdiction over those claims, and this Court necessarily also \nlacks jurisdiction. \n  \nFurthermore, the procedural history of this case illustrates one salutary effect of the derivative jurisdiction doctrine. Plaintiffs \ninitially filed their challenge against DOMA in this Court with a request to proceed in forma pauperis. When that request was \ndenied, they added the State of California as a defendant and filed essentially the same action in State court approximately \none month later, again with a request for waiver of fees and costs. The State court, unlike this Court, granted the request to \nfile without payment of fees and costs. Plaintiffs have, therefore, engaged in a sort of “forum shopping” in an effort to avoid \npaying fees and costs. Moreover, plaintiffs’ conduct, if permitted, would essentially transfer certain of their expenses to the \nUnited States, which has borne the cost of filing a notice of removal in this Court and a notification of removal in State court. \nFailing to dismiss an action based on the derivative jurisdiction doctrine under these circumstances would encourage this \nkind of conduct. \n  \nII. Plaintiffs’ Claims and Allegations Against the United States Must Be Dismissed for Lack of Standing \nFor several reasons - including some of the same reasons relied on by this Court, and the Ninth Circuit, in holding that \nplaintiffs lacked standing in their first action - the plaintiffs are still without standing to bring their present claims against the \nUnited States. Specifically, because plaintiffs still do not “claim to have plans to seek recognition of their ... California \nmarriage in another state,” they have not established an “imminent injury” due to Section 2. See Smelt I, 374 F. Supp. at 871. \nAnd because they still “do not suggest that they have applied for any federal benefits, much less been denied any at this \npoint,” plaintiffs still lack standing to bring any claim against Section 3 of DOMA, the definitional provision. See Smelt II, \n447 F.3d at 684. Further, even if plaintiffs otherwise had standing to challenge DOMA, they would lack standing to pursue \ncertain aspects of the sweeping nationwide relief they seek against the United States, such as their request for “a permanent \ninjunction compelling the Defendants to take all necessary acts to require the entire nation of the United States of America, \n[and] all of its territories and jurisdictions, to eliminate any distinction in the law that prejudices the rights of Plaintiffs.” See \nComplaint ¶ 8. \n  \nA. The Case or Controversy Requirement of Article III \nThe power of federal courts extends only to “Cases” and “Controversies,” see U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, and a litigant’s \nstanding to sue is “an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement.” See Lujan v. Defenders of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). To satisfy this requirement, a plaintiff must \ndemonstrate, as the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing to sue, an “injury in fact”, a “fairly traceable” causal \nconnection between the injury and defendant’s conduct, and redressability. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 \nU.S. 83, 102-03, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998); see also Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, \n12, 124 S. Ct. 2301, 2309, 159 L.Ed.2d 98 (2004) (“The plaintiff must show that the conduct of which he complains has \ncaused him to suffer an ‘injury in fact’ that a favorable judgment will redress.”). \n  \nThe injury needed for constitutional standing must, in addition, be “concrete,” “objective,” and “palpable,” not merely \n  15 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \n“abstract” or “conjectural” See Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155, 110 S. Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990); Bigelow \nv. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 816-17, 95 S. Ct. 2222, 44 L.Ed.2d 600 (1975). The standing inquiry, moreover, must be \n“especially rigorous when,” as here, “reaching the merits of the dispute would force [a court] to decide whether an action \ntaken by [another] branch[ ] of the Federal Government was unconstitutional.” Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819-20, 117 S. \nCt. 2312, 138 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997). And if the plaintiff lacks standing, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. See \nFW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231, 110 S. Ct. 596, 107 L.Ed.2d 603 (1990) (“standing ‘is perhaps the most \nimportant of [the jurisdictional] doctrines’ ”) (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750, 104 S. Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 \n(1984)). \n  \nIn addition to these constitutional mandates, the Courts adhere to certain “prudential” requirements of standing. These \ninclude, most notably for this case, “the general prohibition on a litigant’s raising another person’s legal rights [and] the rule \nbarring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches.” Allen v. Wright, \n468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S. Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). “There are good and sufficient reasons for th[e] prudential \nlimitation on standing when rights of third parties are implicated - the avoidance of the adjudication of rights which those not \nbefore the Court may not wish to assert, and the assurance that the most effective advocate of the rights at issue is present to \nchampion them.” Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envt’l Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 80, 98 S. Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 \n(1978). Additionally, this limitation ensures that a court does not “decide abstract questions of wide public significance even \nthough other governmental institutions [including other courts] may be more competent to address the questions and even \nthough judicial intervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S. Ct. \n2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). \n  \nUnder these principles, the plaintiffs in this action lack standing to challenge either section of DOMA under any theory, and \nto pursue relief of such breathtaking scope as they purport to seek in their Complaint. \n  \nB. Plaintiffs Lack Standing to Challenge DOMA’s Reservation of the States’ Authority Regarding Recognition of \nSame-Sex Marriages Performed in Other States \nSection 2 of DOMA provides that one State need not recognize a same-sex marriage performed under the laws of another \nState; specifically, it states that “[n]o State ... shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding \nof any other State ... respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of \nsuch other State.” 28 U.S.C. § 1738C. Thus, for example, if a same-sex couple were married under the laws of California and \nlater moved to another State that does not allow or recognize same-sex marriages, DOMA would make clear that the second \nState would not be required, under federal constitutional or statutory law, to recognize their California marriage. \n  \nObviously, as plaintiffs’ circumstances now stand, they cannot show that this provision of DOMA has any effect upon them. \nThey complain that States other than California, exercising the choice preserved to them by Section 2 to withhold recognition \nof plaintiffs’ marriage, can thus deny them rights and benefits “automatically bestowed upon opposite-gender couples,” such \nas “decision-making authority for funeral arrangements” and “the right to bereavement leave in the event of a partner’s death; \nthe presumption that both spouses are the legal parents of a child born during marriage; and, the right to community \nproperty,” among others. See Complaint ¶¶ 3, 4. These, of course, are rights and benefits that another State could deny to \nplaintiffs only if they were visitors, residents, and/or citizens within that State at an unknown time in the future when an \noccasion to assert such rights might arise. Plaintiffs allege, however, that they “reside in Orange County, California.” See id. \n¶ 9. They allege no plans to move to another State, and, as in their first action challenging DOMA in this Court, they do not \notherwise “claim to have plans to seek recognition of their ... California marriage in another state.” Smelt I, 374 F. Supp. at \n871. Accordingly, as this Court held in the prior action, “[p]laintiffs have not established an imminent injury sufficient to \nconfer standing to challenge section 2.” Id. \n  \nC. Plaintiffs Lack Standing to Challenge the Definitions of “Marriage” and “Spouse” Under Federal Law \nIn challenging Section 3 of DOMA, which defines the words “marriage” and “spouse” for purposes of federal law, plaintiffs \nallege that the refusal to recognize their marriage “results in a denial of... more than a thousand federal rights, benefits, and \nresponsibilities,” such as “[t]he right to social security survivor benefits” and “the right to bereavement leave in the event of a \n  16 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \npartner’s death.” See Complaint ¶¶ 3-4.4 Plaintiffs do not allege, however, that they have actually been denied any federal \nmarital benefits because of DOMA, or even that they have applied for benefits under any program to which this statute might \napply. Thus, plaintiffs have not shown that they have suffered any concrete “injury in fact” due to the definitional provision \nof DOMA. See Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 102-03. \n 3  Although certain amendments to 28 U.S.C. § 1441 have eliminated the derivative jurisdiction doctrine in cases removed under that \nsection, the doctrine continues to operate in cases removed under 28 U.S.C. § 1442. See FBI v. Superior Court of Cal., 507 F. \nSupp. 2d at 1091-92; see also Palmer v. City Nat’l Bank, 498 F.3d 236, 247-48 (4th Cir. 2007) (discussing reasons why “Congress \ndecided to retain the traditional rule that removal jurisdiction is derivative of state court jurisdiction prior to removal [under § \n1442]”). \n \n \nIn fact, by failing to allege the denial of any federal benefits because of DOMA, plaintiffs have failed to correct one of the \nvery defects that caused the Ninth Circuit to hold that they lacked standing in their first challenge to DOMA. In finding that \nplaintiffs lacked standing to challenge Section 3 of DOMA, the Court of Appeals relied on the fact that the definitional \nprovision had never been applied to them under any federal statute: \nDOMA itself simply does not injure [the plaintiffs] or exclude them from some undefined benefit to \nwhich they might have been or might someday be entitled. In fact, they do not suggest that they have \napplied for any federal benefits, much less been denied any at this point. That they might someday be \nmarried under the law of some state or ask for some federal benefit which they are denied is not enough. \nIn short, they have not spelled out a legally protected interest, much less one that was injured in a \nconcrete and particularized way. \n   \n447 F.3d at 684 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Except for the reference to being “married under the law of some \nstate,” all of these statements remain true. Plaintiffs have still “not suggest[ed] that they have applied for any federal benefits, \nmuch less been denied any at this point.” Hence, having suffered no concrete injury attributable to Section 3, either, plaintiffs \nare without standing to challenge its constitutionality. \n  \nD. Plaintiffs Cannot Establish Standing to Seek Certain Sweeping Relief Requested in Their Complaint \nEven if plaintiffs otherwise had standing to challenge either Section 2 or Section 3 of DOMA, plaintiffs would lack standing \nto pursue the expansive relief alluded to in their Complaint. Specifically: \n• Plaintiffs purport to seek “a permanent injunction compelling the Defendants to take all necessary acts to require the entire \nnation of the United States of America, [and] all of its territories and jurisdictions, to eliminate any distinction in the law that \nprejudices the rights of Plaintiffs.” See Complaint ¶ 8 (emphasis added). \n  \n• And plaintiffs request “declaratory judgment establishing any law that restricts Plaintiffs’ rights or distinguishes Plaintiffs’ \nrights in any way from any opposite gender married couple to be unconstitutional, under the United States Constitution.” Id. \n(emphasis added). \n   \nAlthough plaintiffs do not include requests of this nature among their prayers for relief, the above-quoted paragraph in the \nComplaint explicitly “ask[s] for” and “seek[s]” this relief. Id. \n  \nPlaintiffs lack standing to pursue these requests, under both constitutional and prudential requirements of standing. From a \nconstitutional standpoint, plaintiffs have not attempted to allege an “injury in fact” - or any specific effect at all upon them - \ndue to “any” law other than DOMA. And since they have not even identified any particular “conduct of which [they] \ncomplain[ ],” other than DOMA, plaintiffs would necessarily be unable to show how any such laws have “caused [them] to \nsuffer an ‘injury in fact’ that a favorable judgment will redress.” See Elk Grove Unified School Dist., 542 U.S. at 12. Further, \njudgment against the present defendants - the United States government and one State - could not possibly redress every \nalleged injury to the plaintiffs from “any distinction in the law” throughout “the entire nation of the United States of America, \nall of its territories and jurisdictions.” See Complaint ¶ 8. \n  \nThese aspects of the Complaint also seek to “rely on the rights or interests of third parties,” in violation of the prudential \n  17 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \nrequirements of standing. See Hong Kong Supermarket v. Kizer, 830 F.2d 1078, 1081 (9th Cir. 1987). Only those who suffer \ncognizable injury due to laws in other “territories and jurisdictions” have standing to challenge those laws. See Complaint ¶ \n8. As the Supreme Court has held, “even if a governmental actor is discriminating on the basis of [a suspect classification], \nthe resulting injury ‘accords a basis for standing only to those persons who are personally denied equal treatment by the \nchallenged discriminatory conduct.’ ” United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737, 743-44, 115 S. Ct. 2431, 132 L.Ed.2d 635 (1995) \n(quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at 755). This rule “applies with as much force in the equal protection context as in any other.” Hays, \nid. at 743. \n  \nIII. DOMA Is a Valid Exercise of Congress’s Power under the Full Faith and Credit Clause \nEven if the Court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs’ claims, it would nevertheless have to dismiss them on the \nmerits. Plaintiffs assert that Section 2 of DOMA - which preserves a State’s prerogative to decline to give “effect” to another \nState’s laws respecting same-sex marriage - violates the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution. See Complaint ¶ 28. \nThis challenge fails as a matter of law. \n  \nSection 2 is fully consistent with the Full Faith and Credit Clause, for two important reasons. First, the principle of according \n“Full Faith and Credit” has never been construed to require one State to give absolute deference to another State’s laws in all \ncircumstances. Rather, this provision has long been understood to leave room for the application of traditional principles of \nconflict of laws, including the concept that each State retains the authority to decline to apply another State’s law when it \nconflicts with its own legitimate public policies. Section 2 of DOMA easily fits within this principle, which has long been \napplied to recognize the power of each State to apply its own licensing standards - including, specifically, for marriage \nlicenses - when they conflict with those of another State. Second, in any event, plaintiffs completely ignore the second \nsentence of the Full Faith and Clause, which expressly empowers Congress to prescribe “the Effect” of one State’s laws in \nanother State, and clearly condones the exercise of that power in DOMA. Under any conceivable construction of this \n“effects” provision, Congress clearly has the power to recognize the authority of each State to give primacy to its own \nstandards for marriage licensing and to decline to give effect to the conflicting standards of another. \n  \nA. Section 2 is Consistent With Common Law Conflicts Principles \nThe principle of “Full Faith and Credit” has never been construed to require the States literally to give effect, in all \ncircumstances, to the statutes or judgments of other States. Indeed, “[a] rigid and literal enforcement of the full faith and \ncredit clause, without regard to the statute of the forum, would lead to the absurd result that, wherever the conflict arises, the \nstatute of each state must be enforced in the courts of the other, but cannot be in its own.” Alaska Packers Ass’n v. Industrial \nAccident Comm’n, 294 U.S. 532, 547, 55 S. Ct. 518, 79 L. Ed. 1044 (1935). \n  \nConsistent with this principle, the Supreme Court has indicated that the Framers of the Constitution had an “expectation” that \nthe Full Faith and Credit Clause “would be interpreted against the background of principles developed in international \nconflicts law.” Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U.S. 717, 723 & n.1, 108 S. Ct. 2117, 100 L.Ed.2d 743 (1988). And, as the \nCourt has repeatedly acknowledged, longstanding principles of conflicts of law do “not require a State to apply another \nState’s law in violation of its own legitimate public policy.” See, e.g., Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410, 422, 99 S. Ct. 1182, 59 \nL.Ed.2d 416 (1979); see also Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287, 296, 63 S. Ct. 207, 87 L. Ed. 279 (1942) (“Nor is \nthere any authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and credit clause compels the courts of one state to \nsubordinate the local policy of that state, as respects its domiciliaries, to the statutes of any other state.”). Under this \nlongstanding public policy doctrine, out-of-state statutes or acts that are contrary to the forum State’s policy need not be \nfollowed under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. See, e.g., Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, 306 \nU.S. 493, 501, 59 S. Ct. 629, 83 L. Ed. 940 (1939) (holding that California courts need not apply Massachusetts law of \nworkers compensation to Massachusetts employee of Massachusetts employer, where that law was contrary to California’s \n“policy to provide compensation for employees injured in their employment within the state”); see also Hilton v. Guyot, 159 \nU.S. 113, 167, 16 S. Ct. 139, 40 L. Ed. 95 (1895) (“A judgment affecting the status of persons, such as a decree confirming or \ndissolving a marriage, is recognized as valid in every country, unless contrary to the policy of its own law.”); Bank of \nAugusta v. Earle, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 519, 589, 10 L. Ed. 274 (1839) (noting the longstanding principle of conflicts that the \nlaws of one country “will, by the comity of nations, be recognised and executed in another ... provided that law was not \n  18 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \nrepugnant to the laws or policy of their own country”) (emphasis added). \n  \nThe courts have followed this principle, moreover, in relation to the validity of marriages performed in other States. Both the \nFirst and Second Restatements of Conflict of Laws recognize that State courts may refuse to give effect to a marriage, or to \ncertain incidents of a marriage, that contravene the forum State’s policy. See Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws § 134; \nRestatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 284.5 And the courts have widely held that certain marriages performed \nelsewhere need not be given effect, because they conflicted with the public policy of the forum. See, e.g., Catalano v. \nCatalano, 170 A.2d 726, 728-29 (Conn. 1961) (marriage of uncle to niece, “though valid in Italy under its laws, was not valid \nin Connecticut because it contravened the public policy of th[at] state”); Wilkins v. Zelichowski, 140 A.2d 65, 67-68 (N.J. \n1958) (marriage of 16-year-old female held invalid in New Jersey, regardless of validity in Indiana where performed, in light \nof N.J. policy reflected in statute permitting adult female to secure annulment of her underage marriage); In re Mortenson’s \nEstate, 316 P.2d 1106 (Ariz. 1957) (marriage of first cousins held invalid in Arizona, though lawfully performed in New \nMexico, given Arizona policy reflected in statute declaring such marriages “prohibited and void”). \n 4  All of the other examples given in the Complaint are products of State law, to the extent they are supported by law at all: \n“decision-making authority for funeral arrangements and disposition of the body ... the presumption that both spouses are the legal \nparents of a child born during marriage; and, the right to community property, and a share of separate property, upon the death of a \npartner who dies intestate.” See Complaint ¶ 4. \n \n \nAccordingly, Section 2 of DOMA hews to long-established principles in relation to the recognition of marriages performed in \nother States, and ensures that States may continue to rely on their own public policies to reject (or accept) requests to \nrecognize same-sex marriages. The fact that States have long had the authority to decline to give effect to marriages \nperformed in other States based on the forum State’s public policy strongly supports the constitutionality of Congress’s \nexercise of its authority in DOMA. Surely the Full Faith and Credit Clause cannot be read, in light of these established \nprinciples, to preclude a State from applying its own definition of marriage in situations involving same-sex couples, married \nelsewhere, who are domiciled within its own borders. That Clause clearly does not mandate such interference with “long \nestablished and still subsisting choice-of-law practices.” Sun Oil Co., 486 U.S. at 728-29. \n  \nB. Section 2 Was Enacted Under Congress’s Authority to Prescribe to Prescribe the “Effect” of One State’s Acts in \nOther States \nThe constitutionality of Section 2 of DOMA is further confirmed by the second sentence of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, \nwhich expressly empowers Congress to prescribe “the Effect” to be accorded to the laws of a sister State. See U.S. Const. art. \nIV, § 1, cl. 2. Although the broad contours of this provision have not been conclusively established, the power exercised by \nCongress in enacting DOMA clearly conforms to any conceivable construction of the effects provision. \n  \nFirst, there is ample support in both history and case law for according plenary power to Congress under the effects \nprovision. When the Framers considered the Full Faith and Credit Clause, they explained that it was designed to make up for \nthe inadequacies of a predecessor provision in the Articles of Confederation - a provision that called for according full faith \nand credit to a sister State’s laws, but that recognized no legislative power to prescribe the “effect” of such laws. In the \nFramers’ view, the provision in the Articles of Confederation was “deficien[t],” because it did not “declare what was to be \nthe effect of a judgment obtained in one state in another state.” McElmoyle ex rel. Bailey v. Cohen, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 312, \n325-26, 10 L. Ed. 177 (1839) (Mem) (emphasis added). In the absence of any provision as to such “effect,” the Framers \nviewed the meaning of “full faith and credit” as “extremely indeterminate,” and “of little importance.”6 \n 5  Among the “incidents” of marriage mentioned in the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws are “that the spouses may lawfully \ncohabit as man and wife ... the marital property interests which each spouse may have in the other’s assets ... the forced share or \nintestate share which the surviving spouse has in the estate of the deceased spouse [and] that a party to the marriage is the ‘spouse’ \nof the other ... within the meaning of these terms when used in a will, trust or other instrument.” See Restatement (Second) of \nConflict of Laws § 284 cmt. a. \n \n \nAs the Supreme Court explained in McElmoyle, this historical record accords limited significance to the first sentence of the \nFull Faith and Credit Clause, and plenary power to Congress to prescribe the substantive effects of a sister State’s laws. \n  19 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \nSpecifically, the first sentence merely provides that the judgments of one State “are only evidence in a sister state that the \nsubject matter of the suit has become a debt of record.” McElmoyle, id. at 325 (emphasis added). It “does not declare what \nwas to be the effect of a judgment obtained in one state in another state,” id. (emphasis added); the prescription of any \nsubstantive effect of a sister State’s laws is left to Congress under the second sentence - the effects provision. \n  \nThis same construction was embraced by the Court in Mills v. Duryee, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 481, 3 L. Ed. 411 (1813). At issue \nin Mills was the Full Faith and Credit statute of 1790, now codified in substantially similar terms at 28 U.S.C. § 1738, which \nprovided that one State’s judgment would have the same effect in other States as it would have in the rendering State. In \nrejecting a reading of the statute that would treat “judgments of the state Courts ... as prima facie evidence only,” the Court \nnoted that “the constitution contemplated a power in congress to give a conclusive effect to such judgments.” Id. at 485 \n(emphasis added). As in McElmoyle, then, the Mills decision reads the effects provision - not the first sentence of the Full \nFaith and Credit Clause - as conferring on Congress the broad power “to give a conclusive effect” to the laws of another \nState. \n  \nUnder this view, Congress obviously acted within its plenary effects power in enacting Section 2 of DOMA. If the \nConstitution itself does not declare “the effect” of the law of “one state in another state,” McElmoyle, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) at \n325, but instead leaves that “power in congress,” Mills, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) at 485, then Congress clearly had the authority in \nDOMA to declare that no State is “required to give effect” to the same-sex marriage laws of other States. 28 U.S.C. § 1738C. \n  \nMoreover, the Court need not embrace this plenary reading of Congress’s effects power in order to sustain Section 2 of \nDOMA. Whatever the breadth of Congress’s power under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, it clearly encompasses the \nauthority to confirm the applicability of one of the longstanding, generally applicable principles of conflicts law that formed \nthe background to the Clause. See Sun Oil Co., 486 U.S. at 723 & n.1. As explained in detail above, one such principle was \nthe public policy doctrine, which has long recognized the sovereign authority of the States to decline to give effect to the laws \nof a sister State at variance with their own legitimate public policy. Section 2 of DOMA merely confirms the specific \napplicability of that longstanding principle in the context of laws regarding same-sex marriage. \n  \nThis exercise of Congress’s effects power easily fits within any conceivable construction of this provision. As the Supreme \nCourt recognized in Sun Oil Co., the conflicts law that formed the “background” of the Full Faith and Credit Clause was \ncommon law, subject to further “development.” Id. In authorizing Congress to declare the “effect” of one State’s laws in \nanother State, the Constitution empowers Congress, at the very least, to codify the applicability of a longstanding common \nlaw principle in a context where State public policies are poised to clash. That is all that Congress has done in enacting \nSection 2 of DOMA, and its exercise of that authority must be upheld under any reasonable interpretation of its power. \n  \nIV. DOMA Cannot Be Said to Violate an Asserted “Right to Travel” \nIn addition to their Full Faith and Credit Clause claim, plaintiffs contend that DOMA violates an asserted “right to travel.” \nSee Complaint ¶ 17. Although the complaint does not specify, presumably plaintiffs are referring to the freedom to travel \nfrom one State to another, long protected by the Constitution as a basic right. See Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, \n629-31, 89 S. Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969). This claim also fails. \n  \nTo begin with, plaintiffs lack standing to raise this claim. They have failed to allege any plans to travel to, reside in, or \nbecome citizens of any State other than California. They thus do not and cannot allege that DOMA has actually interfered \nwith such travel. See Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 155, 157, 158 (injury alleged cannot be  “conjectural or hypothetical,” \n“speculative,” or “abstract,” but must be “certainly impending”). \n  \nIn all events, DOMA simply does not curtail anyone’s right to travel. It merely permits each State to follow its own policy \nwith respect to marriage, and defines that term for purposes of federal statutes. Thus, DOMA does not affect “the right of a \ncitizen of one State to enter and to leave another State, the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly \nalien when temporarily present in the second State, [or], for those travelers who elect to become permanent residents, the \nright to be treated like other citizens of that State.” Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 500, 119 S. Ct. 1518, 143 L.Ed.2d 689 (1999) \n(noting that “right to travel” cases embrace these three components). \n  \n  20 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \nFurthermore, given that DOMA merely codifies long-standing principles of conflict of laws under Congress’s express \nauthority to prescribe the effect of one State’s acts in the other States, it cannot violate any implied constitutional “right to \ntravel.” Requiring adherence to one State’s codified social policies by every other State, in the name of a right to travel, \nwould eliminate conflict-of-laws principles in this context and “would lead to the absurd result that, wherever [a] conflict \narises, the statute of each state must be enforced in the courts of the other, but cannot be in its own.” Alaska Packers Ass’n, \n294 U.S. at 547; see Ellis v. Anderson, 901 S.W. 2d 46, 47-48 (Ky. Ct. App. 1995) (notwithstanding right to travel, “states \nhave considerable power to adopt an appropriate conflict of laws doctrine in a situation touching more than one state”); \nMiller v. Stauffer Chem. Co., 581 P.2d 345, 348-49 (Idaho 1978) (same). Put differently, the plaintiffs’ theory of the to travel \nwould invalidate the Constitution’s express grant of authority to Congress to prescribe “the Effect” to be accorded to the laws \nof another State. As the Supreme Court has held, “Full Faith and Credit does not ... enable one state to legislate for the other \nor to project its laws across state lines ....” Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. at 423-24. The Full Faith and Credit Clause expressly \npreserves this State sovereign prerogative, and surely no implicit “right to travel” can be read to take it away. \n  \nV. DOMA Is Consistent with Equal Protection and Due Process Principles \nPlaintiffs further allege that DOMA violates their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, including its \nequal protection component. DOMA, however, merely preserves for each State the authority to follow its own law and policy \nwith respect to same-sex marriage for purposes of State law. And it maintains the status quo of federal policy, preserving a \nlongstanding federal policy of promoting traditional marriages, by clarifying that the terms “marriage” and “spouse,” for \npurposes of federal law, refer to marriage between a man and a woman, and do not encompass relationships of any other kind \nwithin their ambit. Thus, because DOMA does not make a suspect classification or implicate a right that has been recognized \nas fundamental, it is necessarily subject to rational-basis scrutiny, see National Ass’n for Advancement of Psychoanalysis v. \nCalifornia Bd. of Psychology, 228 F.3d 1043, 1049 (9th Cir. 2000), which it satisfies. \n  \nCongress makes a wide array of federal financial and other benefits available to men and women united in marriage - to the \nexclusion of all other human relationships (save for that of parent and minor child), not just same-sex marriage. In enacting \nDOMA, Congress (1) recognized the right of some States to expand the traditional understanding of marriage while, at the \nsame time, it (2) protected the rights of other States to adhere to their traditional understandings of the institution, and (3) \nmaintained the longstanding federal policy of affording benefits to the traditional, and universally recognized, version of \nmarriage. This measured response to society’s evolving understandings of marriage is entirely rational. Indeed, under rational \nbasis scrutiny, Congress is entitled to respond to new social phenomena one step at a time, and to adjust national policy \nincrementally. DOMA reflects just such a response. It adopts on the national level, and permits on the state level, a \nwait-and-see approach to new forms of marriage. DOMA thus maximizes democratic flexibility under our federalist scheme, \nby simply preventing some States from requiring other States and the federal government to grant benefits to forms of \nmarriages that, under their own constitutions, state or federal governments are not obligated to recognize. Because it is \nrationally related to legitimate governmental interests, plaintiffs cannot overcome the “presumption of constitutionality” that \nDOMA, like all federal statutes, enjoys. See, e.g., Califano v. Gautier Torres, 435 U.S. 1, 5, 98 S. Ct. 906, 55 L.Ed.2d 65 \n(1978). \n  \nA. Federal Courts Have Unanimously Upheld the Constitutionality of DOMA \nDOMA codifies, for purposes of federal statutes, regulations, and rulings, the longstanding, traditional definition of marriage \nas “a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife,” see 1 U.S.C. § 7, and preserves to each State the \nability to retain that definition as its policy if the State so chooses, or to alter it, as it sees fit. See 28 U.S.C. § 1738C.7 As far \nas counsel for the defendants are aware, every court to address a federal constitutional challenge to this definition of marriage \nhas rejected the challenge. See, e.g., Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning, 455 F.3d 859, 864-69 (8th Cir. 2006); Lofton v. \nSecretary of Dep’t of Children & Family Servs., 358 F.3d 804, 811-27 (11th Cir. 2004); Adams v. Howerton, 673 F.2d 1036, \n1041-43 (9th Cir. 1982); Dean v. District of Columbia, 653 A.2d 307, 331-33, 362-64 (D.C. 1995); Baehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d \n44, 55-57 (Haw. 1993); Baker v. Nelson, 191 N.W.2d 185, 186-87 (Minn. 1971), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 810, 93 S. Ct. \n37, 34 L.Ed.2d 65 (1972) (mem). \n 6  See The Federalist No. 42, at 271 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (“The meaning of the [the full faith and credit \nclause in the Articles] is extremely indeterminate, and can be of little importance under any interpretation which it will bear.”). \n  21 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \n \n \nIndeed, a number of federal courts have specifically addressed the constitutionality of one or both sections of DOMA, and \nhave expressly upheld them against all constitutional challenges. See Smelt v. County of Orange, 374 F. Supp. 2d 861 (C.D. \nCal. 2005) (Section 3), vacated on other grounds, 447 F.3d 673 (9th Cir. 2006); Wilson v. Ake, 354 F. Supp. 2d 1298 (M.D. \nFla. 2005) (Section 2 and Section 3); In re Kandu, 315 B.R. 123 (Bankr. W. D. Wash. 2004) (Section 3), appeal dismissed \nKandu v. United States Trustee, Case No. 3:04-cv-05544-FDB (W.D. Wash.) [hereinafter Kandu]; see also Bishop v. \nOklahoma, 447 F. Supp. 2d 1239 (N.D. Okla. 2006) (rejecting certain constitutional challenges but deferring others pending \nfurther development). This Court should do likewise here. \n  \nRomer v. Evans, which was decided before all of these cases, does not compel a different conclusion. 517 U.S. 620, 116 S. \nCt. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996). In Romer, the Supreme Court applied rational-basis review to invalidate a State \nconstitutional amendment of “unprecedented” breadth that barred homosexuals from securing any protection under State or \nlocal anti-discrimination statutes or ordinances. Id. at 633. The amendment bore no rational relationship to any legitimate \ngovernment interest, raising an “inevitable inference” that it was born solely “of animosity toward [homosexuals].” Id. at \n634-35. \n  \nFor purposes of Fifth Amendment analysis, DOMA cannot be equated with the Colorado amendment struck down in Romer. \n“DOMA is not ... exceptional and unduly broad.” Kandu, 315 B.R. at 147-48 (distinguishing DOMA and the amendment in \nRomer on that basis); cf. Standhardt v. Superior Court, 77 P.3d 451, 464-65 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2003) (rejecting challenge to \nState definition of marriage). Codifying the traditional definition of marriage, moreover, is by no means “unprecedented.” \nSee Kandu, 315 B.R. at 148 (“DOMA simply codified that definition of marriage historically understood by society”). And, \nunlike the Colorado amendment struck down in Romer, DOMA is rationally related to legitimate government interests and \ncannot fairly be described as “born of animosity toward the class of persons affected.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 634. DOMA \nsimply preserves longstanding federal and state policies that have afforded protections and privileges to a traditional form of \nmarriage, while simultaneously recognizing the right of States to extend such protections and privileges to same-sex \nmarriage. Under our federalist system, preserving the autonomy of state and federal governments to address evolving \ndefinitions of an age-old societal institution is itself a legitimate governmental interest. Moreover, because DOMA protected \n“the ability of elected officials to decide matters related to homosexuality,” including their right to recognize same-sex \nmarriage, it plainly was not born solely as a result of animosity towards homosexuals. See H.R. Rep. No. 104-664, at 17, \nreprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2921. \n  \nNor does the Supreme Court’s decision in Lawrence v. Texas overrule or otherwise undermine the precedents, cited above, \nthat uphold DOMA. In Lawrence, the Supreme Court held that the government cannot criminalize private, consensual, adult \nsodomy. At the same time, the Court unequivocally noted that the case before it did “not involve whether the government \nmust give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.” 539 U.S. 558, 578, 123 S. Ct. 2472, \n156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003) (emphasis added). Thus, in light of this limiting language, Lawrence simply does not address the \naffirmative right to receive official and public recognition of a same-sex relationship. Because Lawrence declined to address \nany question regarding marriage, it does not disturb prior precedents in which the courts have declined to recognize a federal \nconstitutional right to same-sex marriage. \n  \nB. DOMA Does Not Impinge Upon Rights That Have Been Recognized as Fundamental \nEven in the absence of the foregoing precedents, plaintiffs’ equal protection and substantive due process claims still would \nfail as a matter of law. Most such claims are subject to “rational basis” review, under which the challenged statute will be \nupheld “as long as it bears a rational relation to a legitimate state interest.” See Squaw Valley Dev. Co. v. Goldberg, 375 F.3d \n936, 944 (9th Cir. 2004) (equal protection); accord Richardson v. City & County of Honolulu, 124 F.3d 1150, 1162 (9th Cir. \n1997) (due process). Only if the statute “makes a suspect classification or implicates a fundamental right” will it be subjected \nto a higher standard of review. National Ass’n for Advancement of Psychoanalysis, 228 F.3d at 1049. In this case, because \nDOMA does not impinge upon any fundamental right, it is not entitled to heightened scrutiny. \n  \nA fundamental constitutional right protected by the Due Process Clause is one that is “objectively, deeply rooted in this \nNation’s history and tradition” and “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, \n  22 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \n720-21, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997). The Supreme Court has mandated extreme caution in elevating individual \nliberty interests, no matter how genuinely and profoundly important they may be to the parties asserting them, to the status of \nfundamental constitutional rights. As the Court has explained: \nBy extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place \nthe matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action. We must therefore exercise the \nutmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field, lest the liberty protected by the Due \nProcess Clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the Members of this Court. \n   \nGlucksberg, id. at 720 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see Williams v. Attorney Gen. of Ala., 378 F.3d 1232, \n1250 (11th Cir. 2004) (observing that conferring constitutional status on an asserted right prevents future revision through \ndemocratic process). Accordingly, only a “small number” of substantive rights qualify under the Fifth Amendment as \n“fundamental.” United States v. Deters, 143 F.3d 577, 582 (10th Cir. 1998). \n  \nA court must reach a “careful description” of the alleged right before determining whether it is fundamental. Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. at 721. Most importantly, the asserted right must be defined with specificity, rather than in general terms. Only when \nthis specific, “careful description” is reached can a court proceed to determine whether the asserted right is fundamental.8 \n 7  Portions of plaintiffs’ Complaint confuse the United States Code citations for the two substantive sections of DOMA. As stated \ncorrectly in paragraphs 15 and 16 of the Complaint, Section 2 of DOMA, which provides that a State is not required to give effect \nto a same-sex marriage from another State, is codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1738C, and Section 3, which defines “marriage” and \n“spouse” for purposes of federal law (erroneously called the “Federal Definition of Marriage Act” in paragraph 15), is codified at 1 \nU.S.C. § 7. Most of the remainder of the Complaint, however, reverses those citations, referring to 28 U.S.C. § 1738C as the \n“Federal Definition of Marriage Act” and to 1 U.S.C. § 7 as the “Federal Defense of Marriage Act.” \n \n \nHere, the asserted right on which plaintiffs’ claims rest in this case is not a right to marry. DOMA does not prohibit gay and \nlesbian couples from marrying. It does not prohibit the States from acknowledging gay marriages. And it does not in any way \npenalize those couples, or States, that do so. Instead, plaintiffs’ claims rest on an asserted right to receive federal benefits on \nthe basis of a relationship other than the sole relationship on which Congress (and many States) have decided to base \neligibility for such benefits. Thus, properly characterized, the right asserted here is far from fundamental, as there is no \nconstitutional right to State or federal financial benefits. See, e.g., Lavine v. Milne, 424 U.S. 577, 584 n.9, 96 S. Ct. 1010, 47 \nL.Ed.2d 249 (1976) ( “Welfare benefits are not a fundamental right, and neither the State nor Federal Government is under \nany sort of constitutional obligation to guarantee minimum levels of support.”) (citing Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, \n90 S. Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970)). \n  \nEven viewing the right asserted here as the right of gay and lesbian couples to marry, DOMA does not directly or \nsubstantially interfere with the ability of anyone, including homosexuals, to marry the individual of his or her choice. Instead, \nSection 2 of DOMA simply underscores that, notwithstanding the evolution in some States’ legal understanding of marriage, \nthe remaining States may continue to follow their own policy so far as recognition of same-sex marriage is concerned, a \nprerogative they already retained, as discussed above, under the conflict-of-laws principles that underlie the Full Faith and \nCredit Clause. Hence, under DOMA, gay and lesbian couples suffer no greater interference with their ability to obtain \nrecognition of their marriages, either in the States where they were wed, or elsewhere. \n  \nLikewise, Section 3 of DOMA merely clarifies that federal policy is to make certain benefits available only to those persons \nunited in heterosexual marriage, as opposed to any other possible relationship defined by law, family, or affection. As a \nresult, gay and lesbian individuals who unite in matrimony are denied no federal benefits to which they were entitled prior to \ntheir marriage; they remain eligible for every benefit they enjoyed beforehand. DOMA simply provides, in effect, that as a \nresult of their same-sex marriage they will not become eligible for the set of benefits that Congress has reserved exclusively \nto those who are related by the bonds of heterosexual marriage. \n  \nIn short, then, the failure in this manner to recognize a certain subset of marriages that are recognized by a certain subset of \nStates cannot be taken as an infringement on plaintiffs’ rights, even if same-sex marriage were accepted as a fundamental \nright under the Constitution. See DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 196, 109 S. Ct. 998, 103 \nL.Ed.2d 249 (1989) (Due Process Clause “generally confer[s] no affirmative right to governmental aid, even where such aid \nmay be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual”); \n  23 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \nLyng v. Automobile Workers, 485 U.S. 360, 368, 108 S. Ct. 1184, 99 L.Ed.2d 380 (1987) (holding that a decision “not to \nsubsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right.”); Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 317-18, 100 S. Ct. \n2671, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980) (“Although the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause affords protection against \nunwarranted government interference with freedom of choice in the context of certain personal decisions, it does not confer \nan entitlement to such [government assistance] as may be necessary to realize all the advantages of that freedom.”); see also \nRust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 201, 111 S. Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991); Webster v. Reproductive Health Servs., 492 \nU.S. 490, 507, 109 S. Ct. 3040, 106 L.Ed.2d 410 (1989). \n  \nFinally,  regardless  of  whether  same-sex  marriage  is  appropriate  policy,  under  current  legal  precedent  there  is  no \nconstitutional right to it, and that precedent is binding on these parties and this Court. While the Supreme Court has held that \nthe right to marry is “fundamental,” Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 383-87, 98 S. Ct. 673, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (1978), that \nright has not been held to encompass the right to marry someone of the same sex. To the contrary, in Baker v. Nelson, the \nSupreme Court dismissed a claim that the Constitution provides a right to same-sex marriage for lack of a “substantial federal \nquestion.” 409 U.S. 810, 93 S. Ct. 37, 34 L.Ed.2d 65 (1972) (Mem). In Baker, the Minnesota Supreme Court had rejected the \ncontention that a State statute limiting marriage to one man and one woman violated federal due process and equal protection \nprinciples. The court found no “fundamental right” to same-sex marriage, 191 N.W.2d at 186-87, and concluded that the \ntraditional definition of marriage effects no “invidious discrimination,” and that the definition easily withstood rational-basis \nreview. Id. at 187. \n  \nInvoking the Supreme Court’s then-mandatory appellate jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. § 1257(2) (repealed 1988), a same-sex \ncouple sought review of those rulings. See Jurisdictional Statement, Baker v. Nelson, No. 71-1027, at 3 (Attachment 2 \nhereto)9 (questions presented include whether denial of same-sex marriage “deprives appellants of their liberty to marry ... \nwithout due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment” and “violates their rights under the equal protection clause \n...”).10 Upon review, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal “for want of a substantial federal question.” 409 U.S. at 810. \n 8  For example, in Washington v. Glucksberg, the right was not - properly characterized - a “right to die,” but rather a “right to \ncommit suicide.” 521 U.S. at 722-23. Similarly, in Reno v. Flores, in which juvenile aliens challenged their detention by the \ngovernment, the Supreme Court rejected an invitation to characterize the asserted right as “freedom from physical restraint,” and \ninstead characterized it as “the alleged right of a child who has no available parent, close relative, or legal guardian, and for whom \nthe  government  is  responsible,  to  be  placed  in  the  custody  of  a  willing-and-able  private  custodian  rather  than  of  a \ngovernment-operated or government-selected child-care institution.” 507 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S. Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). \n \n \n9  Submission of the two attachments to this memorandum does not convert the United States’ motion to dismiss into a motion for \nsummary judgment. See, e.g., Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 268 n.1, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986) (court may \nconsider matters of public record in adjudicating motion to dismiss); Shaw v. Hahn, 56 F.3d 1128, 1129 n.1 (9th Cir. 1995) (“In \ndeciding whether to dismiss a claim under [Rule] 12(b)(6), a court may look beyond the plaintiff’s complaint to matters of public \nrecord.”). \n \n \nThe decision in Baker has precedential effect and is binding here. As the Supreme Court has explained, a dismissal for lack \nof a substantial federal question is a decision on the merits. See Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 343-44, 95 S. Ct. 2281, 45 \nL.Ed.2d 223 (1975). Referring to an earlier appeal that had been dismissed for lack of a substantial federal question, the \nCourt said in Hicks: \nThat case was an appeal from a decision by a state court upholding a state statute against federal \nconstitutional attack. A federal constitutional issue was properly presented, it was within our [mandatory] \nappellate jurisdiction ... and we had no discretion to refuse adjudication of the case on its merits .... We \nare not obligated to grant the case plenary consideration, and we did not; but we were required to deal \nwith its merits. We did so by concluding that the appeal should be dismissed because the constitutional \nchallenge to the California statute was not a substantial one. \n   \nId. (emphasis added). As the Eighth Circuit has observed, therefore, the Supreme Court’s dismissal in Baker is “binding on \nthe lower federal courts.” McConnell v. Nooner, 547 F.2d 54, 56 (8th Cir. 1976) (per curiam); accord Adams, 673 F.2d at \n1039 n.2 (acknowledging that Supreme Court’s dismissal in Baker “operate[d] as a decision on the merits”). Moreover, \n“dismissals for want of a substantial federal question without doubt reject the specific challenges presented in the statement \n  24 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \nof jurisdiction.” Mandel v. Bradley, 432 U.S. 173, 176, 97 S. Ct. 2238, 53 L.Ed.2d 199 (1977). \n  \nAccordingly, Baker stands for the proposition that equal protection principles do not bar the States from limiting marriage to \none man and one woman. This precedent is binding on the federal courts. See Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American \nExpress, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S. Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989) (“If a precedent of this Court has direct \napplication in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, [a lower court] should follow the \ncase which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.”); see also Agostini v. \nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 237-38, 117 S. Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997) (“The Court neither acknowledges nor holds that \nother courts should ever conclude that its more recent cases have, by implication, overruled an earlier precedent.”); Wilson, \n354 F. Supp. 2d at 1305 (“The Supreme Court has not explicitly or implicitly overturned its holding in Baker or provided the \nlower courts, including this Court, with any reason to believe that the holding is invalid today.”). It follows, therefore, that the \nfederal government may incorporate the traditional opposite-sex definition of marriage for purposes of federal statutes, and \n(in exercise of its express authority under the Full Faith and Credit Clause) may permit the States to retain this definition as \nwell. \n  \nIn short, therefore, DOMA, understood for what it actually does, infringes on no one’s rights, and in all events it infringes on \nno right that has been constitutionally protected as fundamental, so as to invite heightened scrutiny. \n  \nC. DOMA Does Not Rest on Any Suspect Classification \nPlaintiffs also maintain that DOMA discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, in violation of their right to the equal \nprotection of the law, see Complaint, ¶ 20, but DOMA is not subject to heightened scrutiny on that basis. As an initial matter, \nplaintiffs misperceive the nature of the line that Congress has drawn. DOMA does not discriminate against homosexuals in \nthe provision of federal benefits. To the contrary, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is prohibited in federal \nemployment and in a wide array of federal benefits programs by law, regulation, and Executive order. See, e.g., 13 C.F.R. § \n127.303(b)(3) (small business assistance); 31 C.F.R. § 0.214(a) (prohibiting discrimination by Department of the Treasury \nemployees against other employees, applicants for employment, or “person[s] dealing with the Department on official \nbusiness”); Exec. Order No. 13,160, § 1-102, 65 Fed. Reg. 39,773 (June 23, 2000), reprinted in 42 U.S.C. § 2000d note \n(nondiscrimination in federally conducted education and training programs); Exec. Order No. 11,478, § 1, 34 Fed. Reg. \n12,985 (Aug. 8, 1969), reprinted as amended in 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e note (equal employment opportunity in federal \ngovernment). Within the context of such programs, Section 3 of DOMA does not distinguish among persons of different \nsexual orientations, but rather it limits federal benefits to those who have entered into the traditional form of marriage. See \ninfra at 33-36. Section 2 merely reserves to the States the prerogative to make the same choice. \n  \nEven if viewed as establishing a classification on the basis of sexual orientation, DOMA still could not be subjected to \nheightened scrutiny on the theory that it draws any suspect classification; the Ninth Circuit has concluded that sexual \norientation does not constitute a suspect classification. See High Tech Gays v. Defense Indus. Sec. Clearance Office, 895 F.2d \n563, 571 (9th Cir. 1990) (rejecting challenge to policy of conducting expanded investigations of homosexual applicants for \nsecurity clearances). That holding is of course binding here. \n  \nDOMA also does not discriminate on the basis of sex. See Complaint ¶ 19. To begin with, the effect of DOMA - to the extent \nthe statute has any direct effect on a person - is the same on men and women. See Wilson, 354 F. Supp. 2d at 1307-08 \n(“DOMA does not discriminate on the basis of sex because it treats women and men equally.”). Thus, as the court noted in \nKandu, in holding that DOMA does not discriminate on the basis of sex, “Women, as members of one class, are not being \ntreated differently from men, as members of a different class.” Kandu, 315 B.R. at 143. \n  \nLoving v. Virginia is not to the contrary. There the Supreme Court rejected a contention that the assertedly  “equal \napplication” of a statute prohibiting interracial marriage immunized the statute from strict scrutiny. 388 U.S. 1, 8, 87 S.Ct. \n1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967). The Court had little difficulty concluding that the statute, which applied only to “interracial \nmarriages involving white persons,” was “designed to maintain White Supremacy” and therefore unconstitutional. Id. at 11. \nNo comparable purpose is present here, however, for DOMA does not seek in any way to advance the “supremacy” of men \nover women, or of women over men. Thus DOMA cannot be “traced to a ... purpose” to discriminate against either men or \nwomen. Personnel Adm’r v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 272, 99 S. Ct. 2282, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979). In upholding the traditional \n  25 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \ndefinition of marriage, numerous courts have expressly rejected an alleged analogy to Loving. See, e.g., Kandu, 315 B.R. at \n144 (“[T]he Supreme Court did not hold [in Lawrence] that same-sex couples constitute a suspect or semi-suspect class under \nan equal protection analysis.”); Baker v. Vermont, 744 A.2d 864, 880 n. 13 (Vt. 1999) (rejecting claim that “defining \nmarriage as the union of one man and one woman discriminates on the basis of sex”); Singer v. Hara, 522 P.2d 1187, \n1191-92 (Wash. Ct. App. 1974); Baker v. Nelson, 191 N.W.2d at 187; see also Dean, 653 A.2d at 362-63 & n.2 (Steadman, \nA.J., concurring) (“It seems to me to stretch the concept of gender discrimination to assert that it applies to treatment of \nsame-sex couples differently from opposite-sex couples.”). \n  \nD. DOMA Satisfies Rational-Basis Review \nBecause DOMA neither burdens fundamental rights nor allocates federal benefits on the basis of a suspect classification, it is \nnecessarily subject only to rational-basis review. See, e.g., Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 728. The Supreme Court has described \nthe elements of rational-basis review in Heller v. Doe: \n[R]ational-basis review ... is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices. [A] \nclassification neither involving fundamental rights nor proceeding along suspect lines is accorded a strong presumption of \nvalidity. Such a classification cannot [be found unconstitutional] if there is a rational relationship between the [challenged \ngovernment action] and some legitimate governmental purpose.... [A] classification must be upheld ... if there is  any \nreasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification. \n  \n[The government], moreover, has no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification. A \nlegislative choice is not subject to courtroom factfinding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence \nor empirical data. [T]he burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which \nmight support it, whether or not the basis has a foundation in the record. Finally, courts are compelled under rational-basis \nreview to accept a legislature’s generalizations even when there is an imperfect fit between means and ends. A classification \ndoes not fail rational-basis review because it is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some \ninequality. \n   \n509 U.S. 312, 319-20, 113 S. Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993) (emphasis added) (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted); see Dittman v. California, 191 F.3d 1020, 1031 (9th Cir. 1999) (“It is ... irrelevant for constitutional purposes \nwhether, at the time the legislature acted, it articulated the ‘conceivable basis’ for the legislation.”) (emphasis added). As the \nNinth Circuit has held, a court applying rational-basis review “may even hypothesize the motivations of the state legislature \nto find a legitimate objective promoted by the provision under attack.” Shaw v. Oregon Public Employees’ Retirement Bd., \n887 F.2d 947, 948-49 (9th Cir. 1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). Obviously, this imposes a “heavy burden” on the \nplaintiffs, Dittman, 191 F.3d at 1031; rational-basis analysis is, in short, “a paradigm of judicial restraint.” FCC v. Beach \nCommunications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 314, 113 S. Ct. 2096, 124 L. Ed. 2d 211 (1993); see Kahawaiolaa v. Norton, 386 F.3d \n1271, 1279 (9th Cir. 2004) (rational-basis standard is “highly deferential”). \n  \nDOMA withstands review under this highly deferential standard. In light of society’s still-evolving understanding of \nmarriage, the statute adopted what amounted to a cautious policy of federal neutrality towards a new form of marriage. \nDOMA maintains federal policies that have long sought to promote the traditional and uniformly-recognized form of \nmarriage, recognizes the right of each State to expand the traditional definition if it so chooses, but declines to obligate \nfederal taxpayers in other States to subsidize a form of marriage their own States do not recognize. This policy of neutrality \nmaximizes state autonomy and democratic self-governance in an area of traditional state concern, and preserves scarce \ngovernment resources. It is thus entirely rational. Plaintiffs’ contrary claim rests, at bottom, on an improper effort at \nconstitutional bootstrapping: the fact that some States have decided to expand the definition of marriage cannot create an \nequal protection-based duty in other States, or the federal government, to grant such recognition. \n  \nAs Congress explained when enacting DOMA, “[t]here are relations of deep, abiding love” between persons of all kinds, \n“brothers and sisters, parents and children, grandparents and grandchildren,” that “cannot be diminished as loves just] \nbecause they are not ... expressed in marriage.” H.R. Rep. No. 104-664, at 13, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2917 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). But the sole relationship on the basis of which Congress and many States have long made \ncertain benefits available is the legally recognized union of marriage between a man and a woman. In recent years, of course, \nsome States have extended the same legal recognition, protections and benefits to same-sex marriages. Such recognitions, \n  26 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \nhowever, do not compel Congress to extend to this newly recognized form of marriage the same federal benefits it chose to \nafford to the centuries-old institution of heterosexual marriage. Instead, under rational basis scrutiny, Congress is entitled to \nadopt a cautious, wait-and-see approach to newer types of marriage and to society’s still-evolving understandings of the \ninstitution. Legislatures may “refin[e] their preferred approach as circumstances change and as they develop a more-nuanced \nunderstanding of how best to proceed.” Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 524, 127 S. Ct. 1438, 167 L.Ed.2d 248 (2007); \nsee SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 202, 67 S. Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) (“Some principles must await their own \ndevelopment, while others must be adjusted to meet particular, unforeseeable situations.”); Butler v. Apfel, 144 F.3d 622, 625 \n(9th Cir.1998) (“[R]eform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute \nto the legislative mind.”); Medeiros v. Vincent, 431 F.3d 25, 31-32 (1st Cir. 2005) (“[A] statute or regulation is not lacking in \na rational basis simply because it addresses a broader problem in small or incremental stages. It is only necessary that there \nbe some rational relation between the method chosen and the intended result.”) (citation omitted). \n  \nSection 3 of DOMA reflects just such an approach: it maximizes democratic flexibility and self-governance under our \nfederalist system, by adopting a policy of federal neutrality with respect to a matter that is primarily the concern of state \ngovernment. Because all 50 States recognize hetero-sexual marriage, it was reasonable and rational for Congress to maintain \nits longstanding policy of fostering this traditional and universally-recognized form of marriage. At the same time, because \nCongress recognized both the freedom of States to expand the traditional definition, and the freedom of other States to \ndecline to recognize this newer form of marriage, a policy of neutrality dictated that Congress not extend federal benefits to \nnew forms of marriage recognized by some States. Given the strength of competing convictions on this still-evolving issue, \nCongress could reasonably decide that federal benefits funded by taxpayers throughout the nation should not be used to foster \na form of marriage that only some States recognize, and that other States do not. See H.R. Rep. No. 104-664, at 16, reprinted \nin 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2920 (DOMA advances government’s interest in “protecting state sovereignty and democratic \nself-governance.”); The White House, Office of Communications, President on Signing Same Gender Marriage Ban, 1996 \nWL 533626 (Sept. 22, 1996) (“The Act confirms the right of each state to determine its own policy with respect to same \ngender marriage ....”). \n  \nAlthough the Constitution does not require Congress to be so solicitous of divergent state policies and prerogatives, equal \nprotection principles do not forbid such solicitude as irrational, particularly on matters of evolving and contentious social \npolicy. See Mixon v. Ohio, 193 F.3d 389, 403 (6th Cir. 1999) (“State legislatures need the freedom to experiment with \ndifferent techniques to advance public education and this need to experiment alone satisfies the rational basis test.”); see also \nBarefoot v. City of Wilmington, 306 F.3d 113, 123 (4th Cir. 2002) (“[S]tates frequently have a variety of annexation \nprocedures; the need to experiment to find the best procedure is itself a rational basis for the North Carolina law.”); Moore v. \nDetroit School Reform Bd., 293 F.3d 352, 372 (6th Cir 2002) (holding that the Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit \nState and local “experimentation where no suspect classification or fundamental right is involved”); cf. Morton v. Mancari, \n417 U.S. 535, 555, 94 S. Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974) (refusing to disturb, on equal protection grounds, a congressional \njudgment “rationally designed to further Indian self-government”); Artichoke Joe’s Cal. Grand Casino v. Norton, 353 F.3d \n712, 732-35 (9th Cir. 2003) (rejecting equal protection challenge to Tribal-State compacts that Congress adopted “to resolve \nthe conflicting interests of the tribes and the states, which it acknowledged as two equal sovereigns”) (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted); Newbury v. Prisoner Review Bd., 791 F.2d 81, 87 (7th Cir. 1986) (rejecting due process challenge \nto parole procedures, partly based on “the public interest in encouraging state experimentation in proper parole release \nprocedures”). Indeed, when “[t]hroughout the Nation, Americans are engaged in an earnest and profound debate about the \nmorality, legality, and practicality” of a particular social policy, it is entirely rational for Congress (and the courts) to “permit \n[ ] this debate to continue, as it should in a democratic society.” Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 751. \n  \nThus, in order to adopt a measured response of federal neutrality, Congress had to draw lines and distinctions between \ndifferent types of State-recognized marriage. The very process of line-drawing “inevitably requires that some persons who \nhave an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line, and the fact [that] the line \nmight have been drawn differently at some points is a matter for legislative, rather than judicial, consideration.” United States \nR.R. Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 179, 101 S. Ct. 453, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted). As the Ninth Circuit has observed, “[a] classification does not fail rational-basis review because it ‘is not made with \nmathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.’ ” Aleman v. Glickman, 217 F.3d 1191, 1201 (9th \nCir. 2000) (quoting Dandridge, 397 U.S. at 485). Thus, “it is within the province of Congress, not the courts, to weigh the \nevidence and legislate on such issues, unless it can be established that the legislation is not rationally related to a legitimate \ngovernmental end.” Kandu, 315 B.R. at 146 (emphasis added). \n  27 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \n  \nThe constitutional propriety of Congress’s decision to decline to extend federal benefits immediately to newly recognized \ntypes of marriages is bolstered by Congress’s articulated interest in preserving the scarce resources of both the federal and \nState governments. DOMA ensures that evolving understandings of the institution of marriage at the State level do not place \ngreater financial and administrative obligations on federal and state benefits programs. Preserving  scarce government \nresources - and deciding to extend benefits incrementally - are well-recognized legitimate interests under rational-basis \nreview. See Butler, 144 F.3d at 625 (“There is nothing irrational about Congress’s stated goal of conserving social security \nresources, and Congress can incrementally pursue that goal.”); Hassan v. Wright, 45 F.3d 1063, 1069 (7th Cir. 1995) \n(“[P]rotecting the fisc provides a rational basis for Congress’ line drawing in this instance.”). Congress expressly relied on \nthese interests in enacting DOMA: \nGovernment currently provides an array of material and other benefits to married couples in an effort to \npromote, protect, and prefer the institution of marriage.... If [a State] were to permit homosexuals to \nmarry, these marital benefits would, absent some legislative response, presumably have to be made \navailable to homosexual couples and surviving spouses of homosexual marriages on the same terms as \nthey are now available to opposite-sex married couples and spouses. To deny federal recognition to \nsame-sex marriages will thus preserve scarce government resources, surely a legitimate government \npurpose. \n   \nH.R. Rep. No. 104-664, at 18, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2922. \n  \nIn the final analysis, plaintiffs contend that equal protection principles effectively precluded Congress from adopting a federal \npolicy of neutrality in the face of evolving state understandings of marriage. On plaintiffs’ view, even though Congress was \nunder no independent constitutional obligation to recognize same-sex marriage before any State did so, once a single State \nlegalized same-sex marriage, equal protection principles mandated that Congress extend federal benefits to such marriages, or \nwithdraw them from all marriages. No constitutional principle, however, mandates such a result, which is fundamentally at \nodds with our federalist scheme of divided sovereignty, and which could be a substantial disincentive for States to recognize \nnew rights and privileges as circumstances evolve. \n  \nVI. DOMA Does Not Violate the Right to Privacy \nPlaintiffs also assert that DOMA constitutes “an undue invasion of the Right of Privacy,” citing Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 \nU.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965). See Complaint ¶¶ 17, 27, 28. This claim must fail, first, because the \nSupreme Court has rejected a “right to privacy” claim in relation to same-sex marriage. One of the arguments made in Baker \nv. Nelson, referred to above, was that Minnesota’s refusal to permit same-sex marriage constituted “an unwarranted invasion \nof... privacy” in violation of the Constitution. See Jurisdictional Statement, Baker v. Nelson, No. 71-1027, at 18 (Attachment \n2 hereto). In dismissing the appeal in Baker “for want of a substantial federal question,” the Supreme Court necessarily \naddressed the merits of that claim, and rejected it. 409 U.S. 810 (1972) (Mem); see Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. at 343-44. \n  \nEven if Baker were not dispositive in this regard, this Court should reject plaintiffs’ right-to-privacy claim. The Supreme \nCourt has described the contours of this right as follows: \nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however ... the \nCourt has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, \ndoes exist under the Constitution ... These decisions make it clear that only personal rights that can be \ndeemed “fundamental” or “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” are included in this guarantee of \npersonal privacy. \n   \nRoe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 152, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973) (citations omitted) (emphasis added); see Paul v. \nDavis, 424 U.S. 693, 712-13, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976). The Ninth Circuit has reiterated the underlined \nlanguage. See Grummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 493-94 (9th Cir. 1985). And this Court has observed more recently: “The \nfederal  constitutional  right  of  privacy  is  extremely  narrow.  The  right  is  limited  to  those  personal  rights  which  are \n‘fundamental’ or ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.’ ” Yorkshire v. IRS, 829 F. Supp. 1198, 1202 (C.D. Cal. 1993) \n(emphasis added); accord Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions, Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 532 (1st Cir. 1995); Shields v. Burge, \n  28 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \n874 F.2d 1201, 1210 (7th Cir. 1989). \n  \nUnder this precedent, plaintiffs cannot rely on a  “right to privacy” to supersede DOMA, for as explained above, a \n“fundamental” right to same-sex marriage has not been recognized as such by the courts. See supra at 25-30; see also Smelt I, \n374 F. Supp. 2d at 877-79; Wilson v. Ake, 354 F. Supp. 2d at 1306-07; Kandu, 315 B.R. at 140. Further, as also explained \nabove, even if same-sex marriage had been acknowledged as a fundamental right, there would still be no “fundamental” right \nto receive federal benefits based on a gay or lesbian marriage, or to require other States to recognize such a marriage. \n  \nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Lawrence v. Texas does not support plaintiffs’ right-to-privacy claim. Although the Court \nthere relied in part on the right to privacy, the decision dealt with “private” conduct - an adjective that appears twenty-four \ntimes in the majority decision. 539 U.S. 558, 564-65 (2003). The Court struck down the subject statute because it “touch[ed] \nupon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home.” That statute, the Court \ncontinued, sought “to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within \nthe liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.... [A]dults may choose to enter upon this relationship in \nthe confines of their homes and their own private lives ....” Id. at 567 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court emphasized that the \ncase before it did “not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual \npersons seek to enter.” Id. at 578. Lawrence thus offers no support for the proposition that DOMA violates plaintiffs’ right to \nprivacy. \n  \nVII. DOMA Cannot Be Said to Infringe Upon any Rights of Speech \nPlaintiffs next assert, without elaboration or any specific factual allegations, that DOMA violates their “Right of Free \nSpeech.” See Complaint ¶ 17. Apparently plaintiffs’ theory is that their marriage constitutes “speech” under the First \nAmendment. This claim is groundless because, first, DOMA does not curtail anyone’s right to marry the person of his or her \nchoice, just as it does not affect an individual’s right to travel or right to privacy. DOMA merely permits each State to follow \nits own policy with regard to same-sex marriage, and defines “marriage” and “spouse” for purposes of federal statutes. It does \nnot affect the ability of any person to contract any marriage permitted by State law, and it cannot, for this reason alone, be \nsaid to infringe upon any speech rights related to same-sex marriage. \n  \nEven if DOMA could be seen as limiting one’s ability to enter into a same-sex marriage, plaintiffs’ “free speech” claim \nwould fail because marriage, whether same-sex, or heterosexual, is not “expressive conduct” under the First Amendment. \nThe Supreme Court has “rejected the view that conduct can be labeled ‘speech’ whenever the person engaging in the conduct \nintends thereby to express an idea.” See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Inst’l Rights, 547 U.S. 47, 65-66, 126 S. Ct. \n1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, conduct may be considered speech under the First \nAmendment only if it is “inherently expressive” - that is, when it is “the equivalent of speech.” See id. at 66; James v. City of \nLong Beach, 18 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1082 (C.D. Cal. 1998). \n  \nIn determining whether conduct falls within the First Amendment, the courts consider “whether an intent to convey a \nparticularized message was present, and [whether] the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those \nwho viewed it.” See Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S. Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989) (internal quotation marks \nomitted)).  The  courts  also  examine  whether  the  conduct  in  question  is  “integral  to,  or  commonly  associated  with, \nexpression,” and whether “the challenged statute is directed narrowly and specifically at expression or conduct commonly \nassociated with expression.” See Roulette v. City of Seattle, 97 F.3d 300, 304, 305 (9th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).11 Whether conduct is expressive must be judged based on the conduct alone, not in light of whatever speech may \naccompany it. See Forum for Academic & Inst’l Rights, 547 U.S. at 66. If it is “unclear” what message the actor intends to \nconvey, it will not constitute expressive conduct. See Villegas v. City of Gilroy, 363 F. Supp. 2d 1207, 1217-18 (N.D. Cal. \n2005). “The party asserting that [his] conduct is expressive bears the burden of demonstrating that the First Amendment \napplies, and that party must advance more than a mere ‘plausible contention’ that its conduct is expressive.” Church of Amer. \nKnights of the Ku Klux Klan v. Kerik, 356 F.3d 197, 205 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Clark v. Community for Creative \nNon-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 n.5, 104 S. Ct. 3065, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984)). \n 10  Because Baker held that the denial of same-sex marriage did not violate the equal protection clause, it also relevant to our \nargument that DOMA does not make distinctions based on any suspect classifications. See infra at Part V.C. \n \n  29 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \n \nGetting married or being married does not, under the circumstances presented here, constitute “expressive conduct” pursuant \nto  these  principles.  Marrying  is  not  “inherently  expressive”  or  “commonly  associated”  with  expression,  and  no \n“particularized message” is likely to be “understood” from the plaintiffs’ being married.12 See Forum for Academic & Inst’l \nRights, 547 U.S. at 66; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. at 404; Roulette, 97 F.3d at 304. As this Court observed in relation to \nplaintiffs’ First Amendment claim against the State statute in their earlier action, “[i]t is not readily apparent [that] obtaining \na marriage license is protected First Amendment activity.” Smelt I, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 867. Similarly, the Ninth Circuit noted, \nin affirming this Court’s decision to abstain from deciding plaintiffs’ State-law claim: \n 11  Thus, for example, picketing, burning a flag, wearing a black armband, or dancing for an audience may constitute “speech,” see \nTexas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. at 404-06; Willis v. Town of Marshall, N.C., 426 F.3d 251, 257-61 (4th Cir. 2005), whereas attending a \nsports event, possessing a firearm, engaging in sexual activity in a commercial establishment, or dancing for one’s own enjoyment \n(even in a public place) does not. See James v. City of Long Beach, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 1082-83; Nordyke v. King, 319 F.3d 1185, \n1189-90 (9th Cir. 2003); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 705, 106 S. Ct. 3172, 92 L.Ed.2d 568 (1986); Willis, 426 F.3d \nat 257-61. \n \n \nWe do not overlook Smelt and Hammer’s claim that this case touches on First Amendment issues, which should dissuade us \nfrom abstention .... But it is difficult, or impossible, to see a true speech problem here .... All that is involved here is the \nfailure to issue a marriage license. \n  \nSmelt II, 447 F.3d at 681 n.22; see Samuels v. New York State Dep’t of Health, 811 N.Y.S.2d 136, 146-47 (N.Y. App. Div. \n2006) (holding that State’s prohibition of same-sex marriage did not violate constitutional free speech rights). \n  \nTherefore, DOMA does not violate any speech rights under the First Amendment. \n  \nVIII. DOMA Cannot Be Said to Infringe Upon any “Right” under the Ninth Amendment \nFinally, plaintiffs contend that DOMA violates what they call “the Ninth Amendment Right of Reservation of all Rights not \nEnumerated to the People.” See Complaint ¶ 17. The Court of Appeals has repeatedly held, however, that the Ninth \nAmendment  is  not  an  independent  source  of  rights;  this  provision  of  the  Constitution  “has  not  been  interpreted  as \nindependently securing any constitutional rights for purposes of making out a constitutional violation.” Schowengerdt v. \nUnited States, 944 F.2d 483, 490 (9th Cir. 1991). \n  \n“It is a common error, but an error nonetheless, to talk of ‘ninth amendment rights.’ The ninth amendment is not a source of \nrights as such; it is simply a rule about how to read the Constitution.” San Diego County Gun Rights Comm. v. Reno, 98 F.3d \n1121, 1125 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 776 n.14 (2d ed. 1988)) (emphasis in \noriginal); accord Jenkins v. Commissioner, 483 F.3d 90, 92 (2d Cir. 2007) (“The Ninth Amendment is not an independent \nsource of individual rights; rather, it provides a ‘rule of construction’ ....”); Froehlich v. Wisconsin Dep’t of Corrections, 196 \nF.3d 800, 801 (7th Cir. 1999) (“The Ninth Amendment is a rule of interpretation rather than a source of rights. Its purpose is \nto make clear that the enumeration of specific rights in the Bill of Rights is not intended ... to deny the existence of \nunenumerated rights.”) (citations omitted).13 Thus, even more to the point in relation to this case, the Court of Appeals has \nspecifically held that “the ninth amendment has never been recognized as independently securing any constitutional right, for \npurposes of pursuing a civil rights claim.” Strandberg v. City of Helena, 791 F.2d 744, 748 (9th Cir. 1986). \n 12  Without any accompanying speech, an observer would not even know, for example, whether plaintiffs were expressing their \nfeelings for each other, their views about same-sex marriage as a social matter, their views about the constitutionality of not \npermitting same-sex marriage, or their views on some other subject. See Villegas, 363 F. Supp. 2d at 1217-18 (rejecting \n“expressive conduct” claim where plaintiff’s message was “unclear”). \n \n \nAccordingly, plaintiffs cannot assert a personal “right” under the Ninth Amendment. \n  \nCONCLUSION \n  30 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 1683906...   \n \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the United States’ motion to dismiss should be granted, and all of plaintiffs’ claims against the \nUnited States should be dismissed with prejudice. \n  \nDated: June 11, 2009 \n  \nRespectfully submitted, \n  \nTONY WEST \n  \nAssistant Attorney General \n  \nJAMES J.

Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 488-489 (Goldberg, J., concurring)). Even if this \nstatement in Choate were the law, it would not help the plaintiffs here, given that, as shown above, same-sex marriage has not been \nrecognized as a “fundamental” right. \n \n \n \n  31 \n ",

      "text": "Arthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 2610459...   \n \n \n \n  \n2009 WL 2610459 (C.D.Cal.) (Trial Motion, Memorandum and Affidavit) \nUnited States District Court, C.D. California, \nSouthern Division. \nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, State of California, and Does 1 through 1,000, Defendants. \nNo. SACV09-00286 DOC (MLGx). \nAugust 17, 2009. \nUnited States of America’s Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Deem the Complaint Filed Nunc Pro \nTunc and the Fee Waiver Granted \nTony West, Assistant Attorney General, Arthur R. Goldberg, Assistant Director, W. Scott Simpson, Senior Trial Counsel, \nDepartment of Justice, Civil Division, Room 7210, Federal Programs Branch, Post Office Box 883, Washington, D.C. 20044, \nTelephone: (202) 514-3495, Fax: (202) 616-8470, E-mail: scott.simpson @usdoj.gov, Attorneys for Defendant United States \nof America. \nThe United States of America, by its undersigned counsel, responds as follows to “Plaintiffs’ Motion to Deem the Complaint \nFiled Nunc Pro Tunc and the Fee Waiver Granted” (Doc. 41): \n  \n1. Plaintiffs’ motion is based entirely on what the parties allegedly “understood” regarding the filing of this action and its \nremoval to federal court. In truth, however, no such “understanding” ever existed. As explained in the accompanying \ndeclaration of counsel, the United States at no time agreed to the initial filing of this action in state court, and counsel for the \nparties did not communicate regarding its removal to federal court until after the United States had transmitted its Notice of \nRemoval  to  this  Court.  (See  Declaration  of  W.  Scott  Simpson  ¶¶  2-4  (Attachment  1  hereto).)  Thus,  there  was  no \n“understanding” between the parties regarding the filing of this action in State court or its removal to this Court. \n  \n2. In any event, any such understanding between counsel would have been entirely void and ineffective. As stated in the \nUnited States’ motion to dismiss, a federal court, after removal of a case from state court, “has no more jurisdiction than the \nstate court” did before removal. See Salveson v. Western States Bankcard Ass’n, 731 F.2d 1423, 1431 (9th Cir. 1984). No \nagreement of counsel could provide otherwise, given that “officers of the United States possess no power through their \nactions to ... confer jurisdiction on a court in the absence of some express provision by Congress.” See United States v. New \nYork Rayon Importing Co., 329 U.S. 654, 660, 67 S. Ct. 601, 91 L.Ed. 577 (1947); see also United States v. Judge, 944 F.2d \n523, 525 (9th Cir. 1991) (“[I]t is well-established that litigants cannot confer [subject matter] jurisdiction by consent where \nnone exists.”). \n  \n3. Further, permitting the kind of “understanding” posited by the plaintiffs would be totally inappropriate, aside from the \njurisdictional difficulty. Permitting the parties to a dispute to agree beforehand that plaintiff would file a lawsuit in state court \nand that defendant would thereafter remove to federal court would allow the plaintiff to sidestep all pre-filing requirements in \nfederal court, including the payment of a federal filing fee. The plaintiffs should not be allowed to do so here. \n  \n4. Plaintiffs are also asking for relief that makes no sense procedurally. They ask this Court to grant a fee waiver request that \nwas actually filed in a different case, and that a different judge of this Court has already denied. Indeed, they seek an order \ngranting a fee waiver request when no such request is currently pending before the Court. Plaintiffs cite no authority or \nprecedent for such novel action, and the United States is aware of none. Rather than seeking such extraordinary relief, \nplaintiffs could have appealed the denial of their fee waiver requests in Case No. SACV08-01244 UA. See Andrews v. King, \n398 F.3d 1113, 1118 (9th Cir. 2005) (“The denial of a motion to proceed IFP is appealable as a final judgment under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1291.”) (citing Roberts v. United States Dist. Ct., 339 U.S. 844, 845, 70 S. Ct. 954, 94 L.Ed. 1326 (1950)). But they \ndid not do so. \n  1 \n \n\nArthur SMELT and Christopher Hammer, Plaintiffs, v...., 2009 WL 2610459...   \n \n \n  \n5. Lastly, plaintiffs’ motion violates at least two important Local Rules of this Court. First, no conference of counsel has \noccurred regarding this motion pursuant to Local Rule 7-3.

Gilbert / SBN 85912, 950 West Seventeenth Street, Suites D & E, Santa Ana, California 92706-3573, Telephone: \n714/ 667-1038, Fax: 714/ 667-2388, Attorney for Plaintiffs. \nTHE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL STATUTE OF CALIFORNIA \nOver the last decade, few areas of constitutional law have received more attention from the Supreme Court than sovereign \nimmunity. It’s most recent ruling on the issue, in United States vs. Georgia, Nos. 04-12-3, 04-1236, 2006. WL 4397 (U.S. \nJan. 10, 2006) actually opens the door to more lawsuits against states by holding that Plaintiffs may use federal laws to sue \nstate governments if they claim that the state is violating the Constitution. \n  \nIn City of Bourne, the Supreme Court declared that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) is a 1993 \nUnited States federal law aimed at preventing laws which substantially burden a person’s free exercise of their religion, was \nunconstitutional as applied to state and local governments, because it exceeded the scope of Congress’s power under Section \n5. \n  \nIn subsequent cases, the Supreme Court considered whether several other statutues constituted a valid exercise of Congress’s \nSection 5 authority and thus could be used to sue state governments. In Florida Prepaid vs. College, 527 U.S. 627 (1999) the \nSupreme Court held that state governments could not be sued for patent infringement even though a federal statute expressly \nauthorized such suits. \n  \nThe Supreme Court explained that the federal law did not fit under Congress’ Section 5 power because Congress had not \nproven that the states were engaged in pervasive unconstitutional behavior when infringing patents. \n  \nThe Supreme Court shifts course in two more recent cases, the Supreme Court allowed more leeway for lawsuits filed against \nstate governments under federal statutes. Nevada Department of Human Resources vs. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721 (2003), was a \nSupreme Court case which held that Congress had constitutionally abrogated the states’ sovereign immunity by enacting the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act of 1993. The Court held that state governments may be sued for violating the family leave \nprovisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act. \n  \nThe Supreme Court found that when Congress enacted this law it was concerned with gender discrimination and that the loss \nof family leave disproportionately affected women in the workplace. The Supreme Court said gender discrimination receives \nintermediate scrutiny rather than the rational-basis review that applies to age or disability cases, and it concluded that \nCongress has more latitude to legislate under Section 5 when it aims to eliminate discrimination that receives the courts’ \nheightened scrutiny. \n  \nA year after Hibbs, in Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004) was a case in the Supreme Court of the United States \ninvolving Congress’ enforcement powers under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, The Supreme Court held that state \n  1 \n \n\nArthur Bruno SMELT and Christopher David Hammer,..., 2009 WL 2135249...   \n \n \ngovernments may be sued under Title II of the ADA when they discriminate against people with disabilities by limiting their \naccess to the courts. \n  \nThe case involved a criminal defendant who crawled on his hands and knees to reach a second-floor courtroom that had no \nwheelchair access or other accommodation for those with disabilities. In its ruling, the Supreme Court emphasized that access \nto the courts is a long-recognized, basic right and that states can be sued for keeping people with disabilities from exercising \nit. \n  \nBut the Lane ruling left many questions unanswered. The Supreme Court said only that states can be sued under Title II if \nthey violate a fundamental right; it did not consider whether Title II could be used to sue state governments for any other \nreasons. \n  \nThe Eleventh Circuit upheld a trial court ruling that dismissed Goodman’s claims, but the Supreme Court reversed in a \nunanimous decision. In a brief opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court stated, “While the members of \nthis Court have disagreed regarding the scope of Congress’ ‘prophylactic’ enforcement powers under Section 5 of the \nFourteenth Amendment, no one doubts that Section 5 grants Congress the power to ‘enforce ... the provisions of the \namendment by creating private remedies against the states for actual violations of those provisions.’ The Court declared that \n“Congress is expressly granted authority to enforce the substantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision \nclearly says that state governments may be sued for violating the Constitution so far as it is reasonably practical. \n  \nAfter the flurry of sovereign immunity cases the Supreme Court decided between 1996 and 2004, a simple, but controversial \nprinciple which has emerged. If a federal law targets types of discrimination that receive heightened scrutiny, then it can be \nused to sue state governments, even without proof of past constitutional violations. But if the statue involves discrimination \nor other rights violations that don’t receive heightened scrutiny, then Congress cannot authorize suits against states, no matter \nhow elaborate the legislative history. In the instant case of Smelt and Hammer, it has always been argued that same gender \nmarriage is a constitutional fundamental right no different than opposite gender marriage and that, at a minimum, heightened \nscrutiny must be the standard to adjudicate a fundamental constitutional right. \n  \nIn Hibbs, for example, the Court found that states could be sued for violating the family leave provision, even without finding \nthat the absence of family leave results in unconstitutional gender discrimination. \n  \nUnited States v. Georgia does not alter this framework but adds to it in an important way. The Supreme Court held that a \nstate government can be sued for violating a federal law when the law authorizes a remedy for a constitutional violation. This \nwill expand the circumstances in which such lawsuits can go forward. \n  \nThe Hibbs and Lane decisions involve rights that receive heightened scrutiny. In United States vs. Georgia, the Supreme \nCourt focused on the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The Supreme Court has never \narticulated a level of scrutiny for this right. In fact, Scalia’s opinion never mentions heightened scrutiny. \n  \nPerhaps we cannot interpret United States vs. Georgia as simply holding that a state can be sued using federal law if the suit \nalleges a direct violation of a right or if there is a heightened-scrutiny claim. If so, then the ruling significantly expands the \npossibilities for suing state governments. Again, Smelt and Hammer have always asserted, and still do, a heightened scrutiny \nissue in this case. \n  \nCalifornia’s Private Attorney General Statute authorizes this case by private counsel because the State of California is alleged \nto be violating a fundamental constitutional right. guaranteed by the United States Constitution. \n  \nThe Attorney General for the State of California simply argues the “M” word as a misnomer, and certainly not as a \nfundamental constitutional right. \n  \nCalifornia is now using the word “marriage” as a misnomer like smoke and mirrors to present a misleading argument that \nsince Smelt and Hammer are recognized by California to have a second class marriage, less than a fundamental constitutional \nright guaranteed by the United States Constitution there is no standing. \n  \n  2 \n \n\nArthur Bruno SMELT and Christopher David Hammer,..., 2009 WL 2135249...   \n \n \nThis court must look to what the State of California means by the use of the word “marriage” as it is applied to Smelt and \nHammer. \n  \nCalifornia does not mean that Smelt and Hammer have any fundamental constitutional right to be married. In fact, California \ndoes not even permit same gender marriage to take place at this time. Not only is there no fundamental constitutional right for \nsame gender couples to marry in California, there is no right at all. Hence, the smoke screen argument that uses the word \n“marriage” with a wholly different meaning than that of an opposite gender couple. \n  \nTherefore, the motion to dismiss is a sham. Marriage to the moving party in this case means nothing more than a second class \nstatutory right to be married until such time as the State of California decides to dissolve the right to this second class \nmarriage. \n  \nIf this same argument were applied to opposite gender marriages in California there would be a revolution. \n  \nFurthermore, in Smelt and Hammer I, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the case “stayed” based upon the claim that \nSmelt and Hammer must be married to present the issues at bar. It is therefore absurd for California to urge this Court to \nignore the ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals now that Smelt and Hammer have achieved second class marriage \nstatus. Clearly, the Ninth Circuit ruled that if Smelt and Hammer were married they had standing to address DOMA in it’s \nentirety. \n  \nFor these reasons, it is respectfully requested that the Court deny the Motion. \n  \nDated: July 9, 2009 \n  \nRespectfully Submitted, \n  \n<<signature>> \n  \nRichard C.

Stat. § 20-1-101  ...........................................................................................................   7 \n   \n \nINTRODUCTION \n  \nThis is the second time Plaintiffs have tried to challenge the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The \nNinth Circuit dismissed their first attempt because they lacked standing. Smelt v. County of Orange, 447 F.3d 673, 683-686 \n(9th Cir. 2006). Plaintiffs raise the same arguments again in this case, the only difference being that they have now entered \ninto a legal relationship recognized by the State of California as a marriage. But that fact alone does not remedy the standing \ndeficiencies identified by the Ninth Circuit in Plaintiffs’ previous lawsuit. Plaintiffs still have not alleged that another state \nhas refused to recognize their relationship, nor that they have actually sought or been denied any federal benefit given to \nmarried couples-the two ways in which DOMA can be triggered. Thus, Plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge DOMA. \n  6 \n \n\nArthur SMELT, et al., Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES OF..., 2009 WL 2251796...   \n \n \n  \nPlaintiffs’ challenge to DOMA also fails on the merits. Many of their allegations lack the factual support required to plead a \ncognizable claim under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. But even if Plaintiffs have provided sufficient factual support \nfor their claims, DOMA is subject only to rational-basis review, which is satisfied as a matter of law. Accordingly, \nIntervenors join in the United States of America’s motion and respectfully request that Plaintiffs’ challenge to DOMA be \ndismissed. \n  \nARGUMENT \nIn recent years, the Supreme Court has raised the bar for pleading standards under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. Gone \nare the days when a complaint could be dismissed only when “it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of \nfacts in support of his claim.” See Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45 (1957). A sheer possibility of success is no longer \nenough-now a complaint must include “sufficient factual matter” to make a claim “plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted). And while courts should generally accept factual \nallegations as true when considering a motion to dismiss, legal conclusions and “naked assertions” do not receive this same \npresumption of truth. Id. at 1949-50. \n  \nAs a result, complaints that rely entirely on “labels and conclusions” or on a “formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause \nof action” should be dismissed. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). Legal conclusions can frame a \ncomplaint, but they must be enhanced by “well-pleaded factual allegations.” Ashcroft, 129 S. Ct. at 1950. \n  \nPlaintiffs fall short of this standard. Their complaint rests on legal conclusions and lacks the requisite factual enhancements \nneeded for this case to move forward. Thus, the motion to dismiss should be granted. \n  \nI. In their DOMA challenge, Plaintiffs have not pled sufficient facts to meet the constitutional standing requirements. \nIn every federal suit, the plaintiff bears the burden to show standing for each of his claims. DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, \n547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006). The “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing” includes three elements: injury in fact, \ncausation, and redressability. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 102-03 (1998) (citations omitted). “Injury \nin fact” is a harm that is concrete and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. Id. at 103. “Causation” is a \ntraceable connection between the plaintiff’s injury and the defendant’s conduct. Id. “Redressability” is the likelihood that the \nrequested relief will redress the alleged injury. Id. Just as with their previously dismissed challenge to DOMA, Plaintiffs have \nfailed to allege an injury in fact, and thus they do not have standing to bring this case. \n  \nA. The Ninth Circuit’s decision dismissing Plaintiffs’ previous challenge to DOMA for lack of standing still controls, \nas Plaintiffs have failed to cure all the deficiencies raised in that decision. \nJust as in their previous lawsuit, Plaintiffs are challenging Sections 2 and 3 of DOMA. Section 2 provides that no state is \nrequired to give full faith and credit to another state’s determination that “a relationship between persons of the same sex ... is \ntreated as marriage.” 28 U.S.C. § 1738C. In the previous suit, this Court concluded, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, that \nPlaintiffs lacked standing because they did not claim “to have plans to seek recognition of their eventual California marriage \nin another state.” Smelt v. County of Orange, 374 F. Supp. 2d 861, 871 (C.D. Cal. 2005), aff’d, 447 F.3d at 683. \n  \nPlaintiffs now allege that they have entered into a legal union recognized by California as a marriage. See Complaint ¶ 2. But \nthey still have not alleged any plans to seek recognition of that union in another state. Without this sort of factual allegation, \nSection 2 is not implicated, and Plaintiffs cannot claim to have suffered any concrete, particularized injury. So the Ninth \nCircuit’s holding still controls here. \n  \nPlaintiffs’ renewed challenge to Section 3 is equally lacking. Section 3 defines the words “marriage” and “spouse” for the \n  7 \n \n\nArthur SMELT, et al., Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES OF..., 2009 WL 2251796...   \n \n \npurposes of federal statutes, rules, and regulations. While it defines marriage as “a legal union between one man and one \nwoman as husband and wife,” 1 U.S.C. § 7, Section 3 “does not purport to preclude Congress or anyone else in the federal \nsystem from extending benefits to those who are not included within that definition.” Smelt, 447 F.3d at 683. \n  \nAgainst this backdrop, the Ninth Circuit held that Plaintiffs lacked standing in their first challenge to Section 3 because they \ndid not allege “that they have applied for any federal benefits, much less been denied any at this point.” Id. at 684. “That they \nmight someday ... ask for some federal benefit which they are denied is not enough” to establish an injury in fact. Id. \n  \nThis Complaint is no different. Plaintiffs again do not allege that they have applied for or been denied any federal benefits. \nSo the Ninth Circuit’s previous decision controls, and Plaintiffs again lack standing to challenge Section 3. \n  \nB. Prudential-standing considerations further show that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge Section 3 of DOMA. \nThe Ninth Circuit also found that Plaintiffs’ initial challenge to Section 3 “stumbles on at least one of the prudential standing \nhurdles.” Smelt, 447 F.3d at 684. That same roadblock exists here. When considering prudential standing, the Supreme Court \nhas instructed courts to exercise caution and only decide significant constitutional questions when it is necessary to do so: \nThe command to guard jealously and exercise rarely our power to make constitutional pronouncements \nrequires strictest adherence when matters of great national significance are at stake. Even in cases \nconcededly within our jurisdiction under Article III, we abide by a series of rules under which we have \navoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon us for decision. Always \nwe must balance the heavy obligation to exercise jurisdiction against the deeply rooted commitment not \nto pass on questions of constitutionality unless adjudication of the constitutional issue is necessary. \n   \nElk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 11 (2004) (quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted). The \nNinth Circuit appropriately exercised this restraint in Smelt because the Section 3 challenge was “excessively generalized,” \n447 F.3d at 686, implicating the definition of terms that are used in well over one thousand federal statutory enactments. Id. \nat 684-85. Due to the generality of Plaintiffs’ challenge-which remains essentially unchanged here-a court could not possibly \nknow “whether in the context of some particular statute as applied to some particular person in some particular situation \nCongress’s use of the word ‘marriage’ will amount to an unconstitutional classification.” Id. at 685. \n  \nFinding that Plaintiffs lack standing here does not close the courthouse doors to all DOMA challenges. A plaintiff who has \nactually applied for and been denied a federal benefit because of the DOMA definitions, or whose union has been denied \nrecognition in another state, will be better suited to allege a concrete and particularized harm. And plaintiffs in other \ncircumstances may also be able to satisfy the requirements for standing.1 But here, the facts alleged in the Complaint are \nplainly insufficient to establish standing. \n *  Admitted pro hac vice \n \n \nII. Plaintiffs have failed to state a valid due-process claim. \nPlaintiffs claim that DOMA violates their due-process rights because it impermissibly impairs their right to marry each other. \nLaws challenged on substantive-due-process grounds need only satisfy the “unexacting” standard of rationally advancing \nsome legitimate state purpose, unless the plaintiff shows that the law infringes a “fundamental” right, in which case strict \nscrutiny applies. Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302-06 (1993). Here, Plaintiffs cannot show that DOMA infringes on a \nfundamental right, and DOMA easily satisfies rational-basis review. Thus, the due-process claim should be dismissed. \n  \nA. Plaintiffs’ interest in marrying a person of the same sex is not a fundamental right under the Due Process Clause. \nThe Supreme Court has “always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for \nresponsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended.” Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. \n  8 \n \n\nArthur SMELT, et al., Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES OF..., 2009 WL 2251796...   \n \n \n115, 125 (1992). Any judicially imposed expansion carries with it significant consequences because it places the issue \n“outside the arena of public debate and legislative action.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720 (1997). Courts \nshould thus “exercise the utmost care whenever ... asked to break new ground in this field, lest the liberty protected by the \nDue Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the [court].” Id. (quotation marks and citations \nomitted). \n  \nTo avoid such improper expansion, courts begin substantive-due-process analysis by carefully describing the asserted right. \nId. at 721. This Court has already defined the asserted right at issue in this case. Smelt, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 879. Plaintiffs are \nnot asserting the longstanding right to marry recognized by the Supreme Court. Instead, they are asserting a newly fashioned \n“right to same-sex marriage.” Id. \n  \nAfter carefully identifying the asserted right, a court must then determine if that right is fundamental. Fundamental rights are \nthose that are so rooted in our history and tradition that they are considered “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” such \nthat “neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.” Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721 (quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). \n  \nAs this Court has already held, the right to same-sex marriage is not deeply rooted in our Nation’s history and tradition. \nSmelt, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 879. The Supreme Court has always understood marriage as “the union ... of one man and one \nwoman.” See Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 U.S. 15, 45 (1885). For over two hundred years prior to 2003, there was never a time in \nour Nation’s history that marriage meant anything else. See Goodridge v. Dep’t of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003) \n(judicially creating same-sex marriage in Massachusetts). And recently, large majority of voters and legislators have strongly \nreaffirmed marriage as the union of one man and one woman. The law in 44 States now defines marriage as such, and 30 of \nthose States have enshrined that definition in their constitutions.2 Federal law also defines “marriage” as “a legal union \nbetween one man and one woman as husband and wife.” 1 U.S.C. § 7. \n 1  For example, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts recently filed a federal lawsuit challenging DOMA’s constitutionality. See \nCommonwealth v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., No. 1:09-cv-11156-JLT (D. Mass. filed July 8, 2009). Intervenors take \nno position here on whether the Commonwealth has standing to bring such a challenge. \n \n \nIn light of this background, it is not surprising that every other federal court and a majority of state appellate courts that have \naddressed this issue have refused to find a fundamental right to same-sex marriage. See, e.g., Wilson v. Ake, 354 F. Supp. 2d \n1298, 1307 (M.D. Fla. 2005); In re Kandu, 315 B.R. 123, 140 (Bankr. W.D. Wash. 2004); Conaway v. Deane, 932 A.2d 571, \n627 (Md. 2007); Hernandez v. Robles, 855 N.E.2d 1, 9 (N.Y. 2006); Andersen v. King County, 138 P.3d 963, 978 (Wash. \n2006) (plurality); Morrison v. Sadler, 821 N.E.2d 15, 32-33 (Ind. Ct. App. 2005). \n  \nMoreover, all of the Supreme Court’s cases “infer that the right to marry enjoys its fundamental status due to the male-female \nnature of the relationship and/or the attendant link to fostering procreation of our species.” Conaway, 932 A.2d at 619; see \nalso Andersen, 138 P.3d at 978. For the High Court, protecting the right to marry is about ensuring “our very existence and \nsurvival,” Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967); Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942); \nmaintaining our “civilization,” Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 384 (1978); and “rais[ing] ... child[ren] in a traditional \nfamily setting,” id. at 386. This inherently procreative nature of marriage is unique to opposite-sex couples, and thus the \nfundamental  right  to  marry  is  confined  to  those  relationships.  Accordingly,  Plaintiffs’  asserted  right  is  not  the \nCourt-recognized fundamental right to marry, but a novel legal theory-the alleged “right” to same-sex marriage. This is not a \nfundamental right, and thus heightened scrutiny does not apply. \n  \nB. DOMA satisfies rational-basis review. \nWith Plaintiffs’ theory of fundamental rights foreclosed, DOMA need only be “rationally related to legitimate government \ninterests.” Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 728. Rational-basis review is “a paradigm of judicial restraint,” and not “a license for \ncourts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices.” FCC v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313-14 \n(1993). A law analyzed under rational-basis review has “a strong presumption of validity.” Id. at 314. And the burden is on \nthe challenging party to “negat[e] every conceivable basis which might support it.” Id. at 315 (quotation marks and citation \n  9 \n \n\nArthur SMELT, et al., Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES OF..., 2009 WL 2251796...   \n \n \nomitted). \n  \nHere, the United States has at least two closely related interests for defining marriage as the union of one man and one \nwoman, both of which derive from the government’s legitimate-indeed compelling-interest in promoting the welfare o \nchildren, our most precious and vulnerable citizens. See Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836, 852-53 (1990) (“[I]t is evident \nbeyond the need for elaboration that a State’s interest in safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of [children] \nis compelling”) (quotation marks and citation omitted). First, the government has a compelling interest in creating a legal \nstructure that promotes the raising of children by both of their biological parents. Only marriage as defined by DOMA unites \nthe biological, legal, and social dimensions of parenthood. Second, the government has a compelling interest in “responsible \nprocreation”-that is, directing the inherently procreative capacity of sexual intercourse between men and women into stable, \nlegally bound relationships. \n  \nOnly a relationship between a man and a woman “is capable of producing biological offspring of both members.” Conaway, \n932 A.2d at 630-31; see also Andersen, 138 P.3d at 982-83. Thus, recognizing those relationships as marriages directly and \nrationally furthers the government’s interest in encouraging the raising of children by their biological mother and father. By \ncontrast, no matter what measures are taken by same-sex couples, they cannot both be a biological parent of the same child. \nIn fact, the only way for same-sex couples to produce children is to involve a third party, a process that risks commoditizing \nchildren and intentionally deprives them of  having both biological parents in their family. So recognizing same-sex \nrelationships as marriages does not further the government’s interest in encouraging children to be raised by both biological \nparents.  Not  surprisingly,  then,  many  courts-including  this  one-have  found  that  this  government  interest  satisfies \nrational-basis review. See, e.g., Smelt, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 880 (finding that the government has legitimate interests in \nencouraging the optimal union for procreation and for rearing children by both biological parents); Kandu, 315 B.R. at 146 \n(listing cases and holding that “encourag[ing] the maintenance of stable relationships that facilitate to the maximum extent \npossible the rearing of children by both of their biological parents is a legitimate congressional concern”). \n  \nThe government also has an interest in promoting “responsible procreation” among its citizens. This interest is rooted in a \nconcern for children, i.e., the natural result of sexual intercourse between men and women. Relationships between men and \nwomen are unique in that they may unintentionally result in the birth of children. See Morrison, 821 N.E.2d at 24 (“ ‘Natural’ \nprocreation ... may occur only between opposite-sex couples and with no foresight or planning”). The government has an \ninterest in directing these unintended children into committed, legally bound relationships between both of their parents. See \nHernandez, 855 N.E.2d at 3-4 (stating that a legislature could rationally conclude that marriage “create[s] more stability and \npermanence in the relationships that cause children to be born” and that “it is better, other things being equal, for children to \ngrow up with both a mother and a father”). \n  \nSame-sex relationships, however, do not naturally or unintentionally result in pregnancy and child birth. Hence, recognizing \nthose relationships as marriages “would not further [the government’s] interest in ... ‘responsible procreation.’ ” Morrison, \n821 N.E.2d at 24-26, 29-31; Standhardt v. Superior Court, 77 P.3d 451, 462-63 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2003). \n  \nSimilarly, it would not further the federal government’s interests to force states that define marriage as the union of one man \nand one woman to recognize same-sex marriages from other states. Section 2 of DOMA reasonably allows each state to \nestablish its own public policy on this important issue of domestic relations-an issue “that has long been regarded as a \nvirtually exclusive province of the States.” Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 404 (1975); see also Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, \n734-35 (1877) (“The State ... has [the] absolute right to prescribe the conditions upon which the marriage relation between its \nown citizens shall be created”), overruled on other grounds by Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186 (1977). \n  \nIn sum, DOMA furthers compelling government interests and is properly tailored to promote those interests. Thus, Plaintiffs \ncannot offer a cognizable legal theory that their due-process rights have been violated, and as a result, the motion to dismiss \nshould be granted. \n  \nIII. Plaintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to maintain their equal-protection claim. \nThe Equal Protection Clause “is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.” City of \nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). It prohibits the government from “invidiously classif[ying] \n  10 \n \n\nArthur SMELT, et al., Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES OF..., 2009 WL 2251796...   \n \n \nsimilarly situated people on the basis of the immutable characteristics with which they were born.” Michael M. v. Superior \nCourt, 450 U.S. 464, 477-78 (1981). But it “does not require things which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law \nas though they were the same.” Skinner, 316 U.S. at 540 (quotation marks and citation omitted). \n  \nPlaintiffs have not alleged a cognizable equal-protection claim because (1) they cannot show that DOMA invidiously \ndiscriminates against any class of persons; (2) they cannot show that they, as a same-sex couple, are similarly situated to \nopposite-sex couples; (3) they cannot show that DOMA impermissibly discriminates based on sex; and (4) they cannot show \nthat DOMA impermissibly discriminates based on sexual orientation. This claim should be dismissed. \n  \nA. Plaintiffs have not alleged that DOMA invidiously discriminates against a class of persons-a required element of \nequal-protection claims. \nA threshold requirement for any equal-protection claim is a showing of invidious discrimination. See Michael M., 450 U.S. at \n477-78. This requires proof that the government acted with discriminatory intent or purpose. See City of Cuyahoga Falls v. \nBuckeye Cmty. Hope Found., 538 U.S. 188, 194 (2003); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976). The Complaint fails \nto allege that the United States acted with discriminatory intent or purpose in passing DOMA, and it provides no factual \nallegations to support such a claim. Thus, the equal- protection claim should be dismissed. \n  \nB. Same-sex couples are not similarly situated to opposite-sex couples for the purpose of DOMA. \nAnother threshold requirement for an equal-protection claim is showing that a similarly situated class has been treated \ndisparately. Christian Gospel Church, Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco, 896 F.2d 1221, 1225-26 (9th Cir. 1990), \nsuperseded on other grounds, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that biological differences \nbetween men and women may preclude a plaintiff from satisfying the similarly situated requirement. See, e.g., Miller v. \nAlbright, 523 U.S. 420, 445 (1998) (“The biological differences between... men and ... women provide a relevant basis for \ndiffering rules ...”); Michael M., 450 U.S. at 477-78 (finding that men and women are not “similarly situated with respect to \n... intercourse and pregnancy”); Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 78 (1981). In short, the Equal Protection Clause “surely \ndoes not require [the government] to pretend that demonstrable differences between men and women do not really exist.” \nMichael M., 450 U.S. at 481. \n  \nMarriage is an inherently relational construct; thus, challenges to marriage laws necessarily involve different treatment \nbetween two classes of couples-same-sex and opposite-sex couples-rather than two classes of individuals. These two classes \nof couples exhibit biological, sociological, and emotional differences, most notable of which pertain to procreation. Put \nsimply, an opposite-sex couple is a procreative unit, while a same-sex couple is not. Cf id. at 478 (noting that the “most \nbasic” differences between males and females relate to pregnancy and intercourse). Intercourse between opposite-sex couples \nnaturally produces children, but the sexual acts of same-sex couples cannot. Opposite-sex couples provide children with both \nof their biological parents, but same-sex couples cannot. These undisputed biological differences demonstrate that same-sex \nand opposite-sex couples are not similarly situated for the purpose of marriage-a relationship that the Supreme Court has \nalways linked to procreation. See Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 384. Thus, Plaintiffs’ equal-protection claim cannot satisfy this \nthreshold requirement and should be dismissed. \n  \nC. DOMA does not impermissibly discriminate on the basis of sex. \nAs this Court has already found, “Supreme Court precedent has only found [impermissible] sex-based classifications in laws \nthat have a disparate impact on one sex or the other.” Smelt, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 876-77 (listing cases). Yet, as many courts \nhave recognized, laws (like DOMA) that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman treat men and women \nequally-neither may marry a person of the same sex. See, e.g., id. at 877; Kandu, 315 B.R. at 143 (concluding that “the \nmarriage definition contained in DOMA does not classify according to gender”); Baker v. State, 744 A.2d 864, 880 n.13 (Vt. \n1999); In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384, 440 (Cal. 2008); Andersen, 138 P.3d at 988; Conaway, 932 A.2d at 598; \nHernandez, 855 N.E.2d at 10-11. DOMA does not separate men and women into classes and grant benefits to only one class. \n  11 \n \n\nArthur SMELT, et al., Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES OF..., 2009 WL 2251796...   \n \n \nNor does it place men or women in an unequal position in relation to the other. Consequently, Plaintiffs’ equal-protection \nclaim based on sex discrimination should be dismissed. \n  \nD. DOMA does not impermissibly discriminate based on sexual orientation. \nDOMA does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. It neither mentions nor makes any distinction based on \nsexual orientation. A man and a woman can marry regardless of their sexual orientation. And a same-sex couple cannot \nmarry, regardless of whether they are “oriented” to persons of the same sex, the opposite sex, or both sexes. Thus, DOMA \ntreats persons who identify as heterosexual in precisely the same manner it treats persons who identify as homosexual. \n  \nPlaintiffs will likely argue that DOMA results in sexual-orientation discrimination because it has a disparate impact on \npersons who identify as homosexual. But disparate impact is insufficient to establish an equal-protection violation without \nproof of a discriminatory intent or purpose. See City of Cuyahoga Falls, 538 U.S. at 194; Davis, 426 U.S. at 239. And, as \ndiscussed above, Plaintiffs have not alleged that the United States acted with discriminatory intent or purpose when it enacted \nDOMA. Thus, this claim fails as a matter of law. \n  \nEven if this Court were to find that DOMA discriminates based on sexual orientation, controlling precedent requires \nrational-basis scrutiny. Sexual orientation is not one of the few classifications-race, alienage, national origin, sex, and \nillegitimacy-that trigger heightened scrutiny under federal law. See Ball v. Massanari, 254 F.3d 817, 823-24 (9th Cir. 2001). \nNinth Circuit precedent on this point is unmistakably clear. That court expressly held that “homosexuals do not constitute a \nsuspect or quasi-suspect class entitled to greater than rational basis scrutiny.” High Tech Gays v. Def Indus. Sec. Clearance \nOffice, 895 F.2d 563, 574 (9th Cir. 1990). And it has reaffirmed this holding in at least two decisions since. See Flores v. \nMorgan Hill Unified Sch. Dist., 324 F.3d 1130, 1137 (9th Cir. 2003); Witt v. Dep’t of Air Force, 527 F.3d 806, 821 (9th Cir. \n2008) (noting that its precedent requiring rational-basis review to an equal-protection claim alleging sexual-orientation \ndiscrimination “was not disturbed by Lawrence, which declined to address equal protection”). \n  \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts that would support creating a new suspect class. The Supreme Court has \nidentified four distinguishing characteristics of suspect classes: (1) a history of discrimination; (2) a trait that “bears no \nrelation to ability to perform or contribute to society;” (3) an immutable trait; and (4) political powerlessness. See City of \nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 440-41. Here, Plaintiffs are unable to establish the latter two characteristics as a matter of law. \n  \n“Immutability” defines a human characteristic determined “solely by the accident of birth.” Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 \nU.S. 677, 686 (1973). The Ninth Circuit has already held that “[h]omosexuality is not an immutable characteristic; it is \nbehavioral and hence is fundamentally different from traits such as race, gender, or alienage.” High Tech Gays, 895 F.3d at \n573. \n  \nPlaintiffs likewise cannot establish the political-powerlessness  factor. Suspect classes are created,  inter alia, because \ndiscrimination against that class “is unlikely to be soon rectified by legislative means.” City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440. But \nlegislatures across the country routinely address perceived sexual-orientation discrimination.3 Thus, “homosexuals are not \nwithout political power; they have the ability to and do ‘attract the attention of the lawmakers,’ as evidenced by such \nlegislation.” High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 574 (citing City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 445). \n 2  See Ala. Const. art. I, § 36.03; Alaska Const. art. 1, § 25; Ariz. Const. art. XXX, § 1; Ark. Const. amend. 83, § 1-3; Cal. Const. art. \nI, § 7.5; Col. Const. art. II, § 31; 13 Del. Code § 101; Fla.

Stat. § 20-28 \n \n \nAdditionally, the Supreme Court has sternly cautioned against creating new suspect classifications because heightened \nscrutiny requires an exacting investigation into legislative decisionmaking, and “respect for the separation of powers” weighs \n  12 \n \n\nArthur SMELT, et al., Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES OF..., 2009 WL 2251796...   \n \n \nagainst expanding this area of constitutional jurisprudence. Id. at 441; see also Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986) \n(declining to extend strict scrutiny to close relatives); Mass. Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 313 (1976) (per \ncuriam) (declining to extend strict scrutiny to a class of older persons). \n  \nFor all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ equal-protection claim based on sexual orientation should be dismissed. \n  \nIV. DOMA is a valid exercise of the federal government’s power under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. \nDOMA codifies the well-established legal principle that states are not required, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, to \nrecognize foreign marriages contrary to their own public policy. While the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not compel \nstates to recognize foreign marriages that conflict with their own public policy, Congress has taken the additional step of \nenacting DOMA to further protect states’ rights in this regard. \n  \nArticle IV, section 1 of the U.S. Constitution provides that: \nFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of \nevery other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the manner in which such Acts, \nRecords, and Proceedings shall be proved and the Effect thereof. \n   \n(emphasis added). \n  \nThe plain language of this clause authorizes Congress to determine the effect of one state’s law in another state. Indeed, the \nSupreme Court has long recognized that Congress retains the power to regulate the extraterritorial effects of state laws. See, \ne.g., M’Elmoyle v. Cohen, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 312, 324-25 (1839) (holding that “the authenticity of a judgment and its effect, \ndepend upon the law made in pursuance of the Constitution”) (emphasis added); Bank of Alabama v. Dalton, 50 U.S. (9 \nHow.) 522, 528 (1849) (“the legislation of Congress, so far as it has gone, does not prevent a State from passing acts of \nlimitation ...”) (emphasis added). DOMA is precisely the type of legislation that the Effect Clause gives Congress the power \nto enact. It simply declares that a state law will not have mandatory effect in another state. \n  \nBut states have never been legally required under the Full Faith and Credit Clause to recognize marriages of sister states. \nMarriage recognition has always been an issue of comity (rather than full faith and credit). Comity is a common-law doctrine \nused to determine “the recognition which one [state] allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of \nanother [sovereign].” Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, 164 (1895). That comity controls marriage-recognition questions is a \nprinciple that has been universally accepted in courts around the country. See, e.g., Gaines v. Poindexter, 155 F. Supp. 638, \n643 (W.D. La. 1957) (“The rule that the lex loci contractus is controlling as to the validity of a marriage rests on comity \nalone, and an exception thereto exists where the marriage is repugnant to the public policy of the domicile of the parties or is \ncontrary to its positive laws”) (quoting 55 C.J.S. Marriage § 4(2)); Mason v. Mason, 775 N.E.2d 706, 709 (Ind. Ct. App. \n2002) (holding that “Indiana’s recognition of the existence of a foreign marriage is a matter of comity,” and rejecting the \nargument that the Full Faith and Credit Clause required Indiana to recognize an out-of-state marriage); Kelderhaus v. \nKelderhaus, 467 S.E.2d 303, 304 (Va. Ct. App. 1996) (referring to comity as the basis for recognizing common-law \nmarriages from other states); Hesington v. Estate of Hesington, 640 S.W.2d 824, 826 (Mo. Ct. App. 1982) (“[A]s a matter of \ncomity, Missouri will recognize a marriage valid where contracted unless to do so would violate the public policy of this \nstate”); Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Chase, 189 F. Supp. 326, 333 (D. N.J. 1960) (stating that comity does not require recognition \nof a common-law marriage that may have been valid in the District of Columbia “if contrary to the policy of [New Jersey]”); \nBrinson v. Brinson, 96 So. 2d 653, 659 (La. 1957) (“[T]he spirit of comity between states does not require a state to \nrecognize a marriage which is contrary to its own public policy”); Henderson v. Henderson, 87 A.2d 403, 409 (Md. 1952) \n(noting that out-of-state marriages are recognized “merely because of comity”); Milliken v. Pratt, 125 Mass. 374, 380 (1878) \n(similar). \n  \nDOMA merely codifies the general principle that states may follow their own public policies concerning marriage, rather \nthan the policies of other states. The Supreme Court “has often recognized that, consistent with the appropriate application of \nthe full faith and credit clause, there are limits to which the laws and policy of one state may be subordinates to those of \nanother.” Pink v. A.A.A. Highway Express, Inc., 314 U.S. 201, 210 (1941) (listing cases); see also Pacific Employers Ins. Co. \n  13 \n \n\nArthur SMELT, et al., Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES OF..., 2009 WL 2251796...   \n \n \nv. Indus. Accident Comm’n, 306 U.S. 493, 501 (1939). \n  \nBy enacting DOMA, Congress made clear that if a state redefines marriage to include same-sex couples, it may not impose \nthat policy choice on other states. Other states are free to recognize or ignore such marriages according to their own public \npolicy. Thus, DOMA does not run afoul of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, and Plaintiffs’ claim to the contrary should be \ndismissed. \n  \nV. Plaintiffs’ remaining claims should be summarily dismissed. \nPlaintiffs also claim that DOMA violates their rights to privacy, travel, and speech. But these claims are stated as legal \nconclusions, with no factual allegations supporting them. They make no factual claims whatsoever alleging that DOMA \nrestricts their private conduct, efforts to travel, or ability to communicate with others. These are precisely the type of \n“unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation[s]” that the Supreme Court has said are insufficient to satisfy \nthe pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. Ashcroft, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (holding that the plaintiff’s \ncomplaint was deficient under Rule 8). \n  \nLikewise, Plaintiffs’ Ninth Amendment claim should also be dismissed. It is well established that the Ninth Amendment does \nnot “independently secur[e] any constitutional rights for purposes of making out a constitutional violation.” Schowengerdt v. \nUnited States, 944 F.2d 483, 490 (9th Cir. 1991). \n  \nCONCLUSION \nIn Plaintiffs’ initial challenge to DOMA, the Ninth Circuit clearly explained why Plaintiffs had not alleged a concrete, \nparticularized injury resulting from DOMA. Yet in filing this suit, Plaintiffs still have not offered any such allegation; thus \ntheir renewed challenge should be dismissed on the same grounds. Nevertheless, if this Court reaches the merits of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims, DOMA clearly satisfies the applicable standard of rational-basis review. \n  \nRespectfully submitted this 27th day of July, 2009. \n  \n/s/Brian W.

(Trial Motion, Memorandum and Affidavit) \nUnited States District Court, C.D. California, \nSouthern Division. \nArthur Bruno SMELT and Christopher David Hammer, Plaintiffs, \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, State of California, and Does 1 through 1,000, inclusive, Defendants. \nNo. SACV09-00286 DOC (MLGx). \nJuly 27, 2009. \nPlaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendant United States of America’s Motion to Dismiss \nRichard C. Gilbert / SBN 85912, 950 West Seventeenth Street, Suites D & E, Santa Ana, California 92706-3573, Telephone: \n714/ 667-1038, Fax: 714/ 667-2388, Attorney for Plaintiffs. \nFILED CONCURRENTLY WITH PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO DEEM THE COMPLAINT FILED NUNC PRO TUNC \nAND THE FEE WAIVER GRANTED \n  \nRES JUDICATA \nIn Smelt and Hammer I, the United States Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit published its ruling in CV-04-01042-GLT. \n  \nIn that ruling, the Appellate Court held that to have standing to address all legal issues in DOMA, the parties must be \nmarried. The Court did not address the issue of whether the marriage could be a second class marriage not protected as a \nfundamental Constitutional right as all same gender California marriages are second class marriages unprotected by the \nUnited States Constitution. \n  \nWhile Plaintiffs respectfully disagree with the Court’s analysis of standing, to accommodate the ruling of the Court, Plaintiffs \nreluctantly, but successfully, obtained their second class fishing license style marriage from the State of California subject to \nrevocation, at will, by the State of California, unlike any opposite gender marriage which is protected as a fundamental \nConstitutional right. \n  \nNow that Plaintiffs have this fishing license class B marriage, Plaintiffs have standing to address the issues in the Complaint. \n  \nPLAINTIFFS SOUGHT ORIGINAL JURISDICTION FOR THIS CASE IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \nCOURT BUT WERE DENIED A FEE WAIVER \nOn November 4, 2008, Plaintiffs sought to file this instant Complaint in Smelt and Hammer II. Every prior Court including \nJudge Gary Taylor, the Appellate Court for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the United States Supreme Court \napproved of each Plaintiffs’ application for a fee waiver. Each Plaintiff is permanently disabled and unable to work. \n  \nThe same applications for a fee waiver for each Plaintiff was submitted to this Federal District Court with this instant \nComplaint. Judge Stotler denied the fee waivers. As a result, it was necessary for the Plaintiffs to file in State court because \nthe doors to the Federal Court were locked shut to Smelt and Hammer as a result of the denial of the fee waivers. \n  \nCounsel for Smelt and Hammer contacted counsel for the United States of America and advised counsel of the above facts. It \nwas understood in the course of the meet and confer that the United States would remove the case back to Federal Court. \n  1 \n \n\nArthur Bruno SMELT and Christopher David Hammer,..., 2009 WL 2251795...   \n \n \n  \nPerhaps it was an oversight for the United States of America to fail to mention any of the above facts in their motion which \nmay have inadvertently led the court to misunderstand why Plaintiffs filed in State court. \n  \nConcurrently with this Opposition, Plaintiffs are filing a motion to have the original filing and fee waiver applications be \ndeemed filed and approved NUNC PRO TUNC in the interests of justice. \n  \nOver the last decade, few areas of constitutional law have received more attention from the Supreme Court than sovereign \nimmunity. It’s most recent ruling on the issue, in United States vs. Georgia, Nos. 04-12-3, 04-1236, 2006. WL 4397 (U.S. \nJan. 10, 2006) actually opens the door to more lawsuits against states by holding that Plaintiffs may use federal laws to sue \nstate governments if they claim that the state is violating the Constitution. \n  \nIn City of Bourne, the Supreme Court declared that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) is a 1993 \nUnited States federal law aimed at preventing laws which substantially burden a person’s free exercise of their religion, was \nunconstitutional as applied to state and local governments, because it exceeded the scope of Congress’s power under Section \n5. \n  \nIn subsequent cases, the Supreme Court considered whether several other statutes constituted a valid exercise of Congress’s \nSection 5 authority and thus could be used to sue state governments. In Florida Prepaid vs. College, 527 U.S. 627 (1999) the \nSupreme Court held that state governments could not be sued for patent infringement even though a federal statute expressly \nauthorized such suits. \n  \nThe Supreme Court explained that the federal law did not fit under Congress’ Section 5 power because Congress had not \nproven that the states were engaged in pervasive unconstitutional behavior when infringing patents. \n  \nThe Supreme Court shifts course in two more recent cases, the Supreme Court allowed more leeway for lawsuits filed against \nstate governments under federal statutes. Nevada Department of Human Resources vs. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721 (2003), was a \nSupreme Court case which held that Congress had constitutionally abrogated the states’ sovereign immunity by enacting the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act of 1993. The Court held that state governments may be sued for violating the family leave \nprovisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act. \n  \nThe Supreme Court found that when Congress enacted this law it was concerned with gender discrimination and that the loss \nof family leave disproportionately affected women in the workplace. The Supreme Court said gender discrimination receives \nintermediate scrutiny rather than the rational-basis review that applies to age or disability cases, and it concluded that \nCongress has more latitude to legislate under Section 5 when it aims to eliminate discrimination that receives the courts’ \nheightened scrutiny. \n  \nA year after Hibbs, in Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004) was a case in the Supreme Court of the United States \ninvolving Congress’ enforcement powers under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, The Supreme Court held that state \ngovernments may be sued under Title II of the ADA when they discriminate against people with disabilities by limiting their \naccess to the courts. \n  \nThe case involved a criminal defendant who crawled on his hands and knees to reach a second-floor courtroom that had no \nwheelchair access or other accommodation for those with disabilities. In its ruling, the Supreme Court emphasized that access \nto the courts is a long-recognized, basic right and that states can be sued for keeping people with disabilities from exercising \nit. \n  \nBut the Lane ruling left many questions unanswered. The Supreme Court said only that states can be sued under Title II if \nthey violate a fundamental right; it did not consider whether Title II could be used to sue state governments for any other \nreasons. \n  \nThe Eleventh Circuit upheld a trial court ruling that dismissed Goodman’s claims, but the Supreme Court reversed in a \nunanimous decision. In a brief opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court stated, “While the members of \nthis Court have disagreed regarding the scope of Congress’ ‘prophylactic’ enforcement powers under 6 Section 5 of the \n  2 \n \n\nArthur Bruno SMELT and Christopher David Hammer,..., 2009 WL 2251795...   \n \n \nFourteenth Amendment, no one doubts that Section 5 grants Congress the power to ‘enforce ... the provisions of the \namendment by creating private remedies against the states for actual violations of those provisions.’ The Court declared that \n“Congress is expressly granted authority to enforce the substantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision \nclearly says that state governments may be sued for violating the Constitution so far as it is reasonably practical. \n  \nAfter the flurry of sovereign immunity cases the Supreme Court decided between 1996 and 2004, a simple, but controversial \nprinciple which has emerged. If a federal law targets types of discrimination that receive heightened scrutiny, then it can be \nused to sue state governments, even without proof of past constitutional violations. But if the statue involves discrimination \nor other rights violations that don’t receive heightened scrutiny, then Congress cannot authorize suits against states, no matter \nhow elaborate the legislative history. In the instant case of Smelt and Hammer, it has always been argued that same gender \nmarriage is a constitutional fundamental right no different than opposite gender marriage and that, at a minimum, heightened \nscrutiny must be the standard to adjudicate a fundamental constitutional right. \n  \nIn Hibbs, for example, the Court found that states could be sued for violating the family leave provision, even without finding \nthat the absence of family leave results in unconstitutional gender discrimination. \n  \nUnited States v. Georgia does not alter this framework but adds to it in an important way. The Supreme Court held that a \nstate government can be sued for violating a federal law when the law authorizes a remedy for a constitutional violation. This \nwill expand the circumstances in which such lawsuits can go forward. \n  \nThe Hibbs and Lane decisions involve rights that receive heightened scrutiny. In United States vs. Georgia, the Supreme \nCourt focused on the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The Supreme Court has never \narticulated a level of scrutiny for this right. In fact, Scalia’s opinion never mentions heightened scrutiny. \n  \nPerhaps we cannot interpret United States vs. Georgia as simply holding that a state can be sued using federal law if the suit \nalleges a direct violation of a right or if there is a heightened-scrutiny claim. If so, then the ruling significantly expands the \npossibilities for suing state governments. Again, Smelt and Hammer have always asserted, and still do, a heightened scrutiny \nissue in this case. \n  \nCalifornia’s Private Attorney General Statute authorizes this case by private counsel because the State of California is alleged \nto be violating a fundamental constitutional right. guaranteed by the United States Constitution. \n  \nThe Attorney General for the State of California simply argues the “M” word as a misnomer, and certainly not as a \nfundamental constitutional right. \n  \nCalifornia is now using the word “marriage” as a misnomer like smoke and mirrors to present a misleading argument that \nsince Smelt and Hammer are recognized by California to have a second class marriage, less than a fundamental constitutional \nright guaranteed by the United States Constitution there is no standing. \n  \nThis court must look to what the State of California means by the use of the word “marriage” as it is applied to Smelt and \nHammer. \n  \nCalifornia does not mean that Smelt and Hammer have any fundamental constitutional right to be married. In fact, California \ndoes not even permit same gender marriage to take place at this time. Not only is there no fundamental constitutional right for \nsame gender couples to marry in California, there is no right at all. Hence, the smoke screen argument that uses the word \n“marriage” with a wholly different meaning than that of an opposite gender couple. \n  \nTherefore, the motion to dismiss is a sham, Marriage to the moving party in this case means nothing more than a second class \nstatutory right to be married until such time as the State of California decides to dissolve the right to this second class \nmarriage. \n  \nIf this same argument were applied to opposite gender marriages in California there would be a revolution. \n  \nFurthermore, in Smelt and Hammer I, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the case “stayed” based upon the claim that \n  3 \n \n\nArthur Bruno SMELT and Christopher David Hammer,..., 2009 WL 2251795...   \n \n \nSmelt and Hammer must be married to present the issues at bar. It is therefore absurd for California to urge this Court to \nignore the ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals now that Smelt and Hammer have achieved second class marriage \nstatus. Clearly, the Ninth Circuit ruled that if Smelt and Hammer were married they had standing to address DOMA in it’s \nentirety. \n  \nFor these reasons, it is respectfully requested that the Court deny the Motion. \n  \nDated: July 24, 2009 \n  \nRespectfully Submitted, \n  \n/S/ \n  \nRichard C. Gilbert, Attorney for Plaintiffs \n  \n \n \n  4 \n ",

Carter ruled that U.S. District Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the \nbroader constitutional questions. \n  \nEXPERT WITNESSES: \nATTORNEYS: \nPlaintiff: Richard C. Gilbert; Gilbert & Marglowe; Santa Ana, CA (Arthur Smelt, Christopher Hammer) \nDefendant: W. Scott Simpson; Department of Johnson; Washington, DC (State of California, United States of America) \nJUDGE: Andrew J. Guilford; David O. Carter; Marc L. Goldman \nRANGE AMOUNT: 0 \n \nSTATE: California \nCOUNTY: Not Applicable \nINJURIES: Smelt and Hammer argued that the denial of such rights, benefits and responsibilities caused them severe \nemotional distress, mental anguish, humiliation, loss of liberty and the pursuit of happiness, denial of equal protection \nof laws, denial of freedom of association, denial of privacy rights, and denial of the right to travel to establish \nresidency anywhere in the U.S. with the full recognition of the legality of their marriage. \nFacts: \nOn Jan. 10, 2000, plaintiffs Arthur Smelt and Christopher Hammer, a same-sex couple, received a Declaration of Domestic \nPartnership from the State of California. They subsequently got married under state law before Proposition 8, which banned \nsame-sex marriage in California, was passed on Nov. 4, 2008. \n  \n  1 \n \n\n \nArthur Smelt and Christopher Hammer v. United States of..., 2009 WL 5948309...   \n \n \nThe plaintiffs alleged that “the refusal of all states and jurisdictions” to recognize the validity of their marriage results in the \ndenial to them of numerous rights, benefits and responsibilities bestowed on all other married couples, so long as they are \nopposite-sex couples. \n  \nThey sued the United States of America and the State of California. (On July 15, 2009, their claims against the state were \ndismissed for lack of standing.) \n  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel asserted that they are denied the right to Social Security survivor benefits, decision-making authority for \nfuneral arrangements and the disposition of a spouse’s body, the right to bereavement leave in the event of a spouse’s death, \nthe presumption that both spouses are the parent of a child born during marriage, and the right to a certain division of their \nspouse’s separate property and the couple’s marital property upon the death of a spouse who dies intestate. They targeted \ntheir action at the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). \n  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel argued that DOMA violated the Constitution’s Full Faith and Credit Clause; their constitutional right to \ntravel; the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, including its equal protection component; their constitutional right to \nprivacy; their right to free speech; and their rights under the Ninth Amendment. \n  \nThe defense argued that U.S. District Court lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims, that the plaintiffs lack standing to \nassert their claims, and that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \n  \nThey sought a permanent injunction compelling the U.S. to “take all necessary acts to require the entire nation of the United \nStates of America, all of its territories and jurisdictions, to eliminate any distinction in the law that prejudices the rights of \nplaintiffs.” \n  \nThey additionally sought declaratory judgment “establishing that any law that restricts plaintiffs’ rights or distinguishes \nplaintiffs’ rights in any way from any opposite gender couple to be unconstitutional, under the United States Constitution, \nincluding all provisions of the [DOMA].” \n  \nALM Properties, Inc. \nUnited States District Court, Central District, Santa Ana \nPUBLISHED IN: VerdictSearch California Reporter Vol. 9, Issue 10 \n  \n \n \n  2 \n ",
