On 2/21/2012, plaintiff filed a motion to amend/correct the agreed order and another motion for preliminary injunction 132 . the motion seeks to amend the agreed order by adding provisions to which the parties cannot agree.

Plaintiff sought to have defendant agree to provide the additional relief he is seeking immediately, pending the outcome of the hearing before this Court, to which defendant would not agree. This Court does not have jurisdiction to order defendant to provide the immediate relief that plaintiff seeks, which is, in effect, a temporary restraining order.

    "summary": "<p>Several young adults who were considered medically fragile (having severe disabilities and relying on technology for survival) filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on May 20, 2010.  The named plaintiffs were each 20 years old and were able to live in the community because they received care through a Medicaid waiver for medically fragile or technology dependent (MF/TD) individuals with disabilities.  This waiver program was only available to those who were 21 or younger.  Upon the 21st birthday of the recipient, the State had a policy of drastically reducing the services available to the recipient (an approximately 50% reduction) because of a change in funding source.  Plaintiffs brought their complaint against the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (DHFS), alleging that the named policy violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (under the 1999 Supreme Court precedent, Olmstead v. L.C.) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Plaintiffs, represented by a private disability advocacy firm, sought declaratory and injunctive relief. </p><p>The Plaintiffs moved for class certification on June 2, 2010.  The U.S. Department of Justice filed a brief supporting this motion on July 16, 2010, and the court (Judge Ruben Castillo) certified the class on November 22, 2010, defining the class as all persons who are, were, or will be enrolled in Illinois' MF/TD program and are subjected to reduced Medicaid funding upon turning 21. Discovery proceeded.  While waiting for potential class-wide relief to be granted, individual plaintiffs moved for and were granted injunctions preventing the reduction of their services at their 21st birthdays.  </p><p>In May 2012, Judge Castillo ordered the parties to submit a proposed consent decree to the court.  When the parties were unable to come to a settlement agreement, on August 21, 2012, he ordered the parties to submit motions for summary judgment.  </p><p>In an order on January 8, 2013, Judge Castillo denied both parties' summary judgment motions, finding that issues of fact existed as to 1) whether the plaintiffs were qualified individuals with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA; and 2) whether the plaintiffs' requested accommodation was reasonable. 917 F.Supp.2d 805.</p><p>In May 2013, the parties again met to negotiate a settlement agreement. On May 16, they came to a settlement regarding all issues. Finding the agreement fair and reasonable, Judge Castillo entered a Consent Decree on October 3, 2013. The Consent Decree established that a class member's need, level, and amount of services should be based upon medical need, not age. Each class member would have a service plan based on a holistic assessment of their needs and resources. The Decree also required any changes in service plans or case management to be discussed with families and patients. It also outlined when and how often class members must be assessed. It was to remain in effect until October 3, 2016.</p><p>Finally, the Decree awarded attorneys' fees and litigation costs to the plaintiffs in the amount of $525,000. On August 26, 2015, the court awarded additional attorneys' fees to the plaintiffs. Following September 2015, there was no further action on the docket, indicating the Consent Decree was completed without issue. The case now appears closed.</p>",

See \nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).  The Department of Justice has authority to enforce title \nII, 42 U.S.C. § 12133, and to issue regulations implementing the statute, id. at § 12134.  \nAccordingly, the United States has a strong interest in the resolution of this matter. \nINTRODUCTION \n  This litigation involves the defendant’s systematic failure to modify its current policies \nand practices of providing insufficient home-based medical care for Medicaid-eligible adults to \nprevent institutionalization.  Children and young adults in the State of Illinois who have \nexceptional medical needs are eligible to receive home-based Medicaid services to avoid \ninstitutionalization under the State’s Medically Fragile/Technology Dependent (“MF/TD”) \nwaiver program.  Under defendant’s regulatory scheme, however, once these individuals reach \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 26 Filed: 07/16/10 Page 2 of 16 PageID #:520\nthe age of 21, they are ineligible for the MF/TD waiver.  Because the adult waiver program to \nwhich a majority of people transition does not provide community-based services at the same \nlevel, these individuals may be forced to enter an institution in order to receive the medical \nservices they need to survive. 1  These institutional placements are often more costly to the State.  \nThis lawsuit alleges that defendant administers the waiver programs available in Illinois, \nincluding the MF/TD and the Home Services Program (“HSP”) waiver programs, in a manner \nthat constitutes unlawful discrimination under title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 and Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  (Compl. ¶ 52-68).  Plaintiffs are a putative \nclass of: \n[A]ll  persons  who  are  enrolled  or  will  be  enrolled  in  the  State  of  Illinois \nMedically  Fragile,  Technology  Dependants  Waiver  Program  (MF/TD)  or \nMedicaid and when they obtain the age of 21 years are subjected to reduce [sic] \nMedicaid funding which reduces the medical level of care which they had been \nreceiving prior to obtaining 21 years.  (Mot. Class. Cert. ¶ 2).  \n \n  The United States supports the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification because it \nadvances the important public interest in community integration. 2  The proposed class meets the \nlegal standard for certification under Rule 23.3  Class actions provide appropriate mechanisms \n                                                 \n1 A state report on the MF/TD waiver indicates that “the children in the MF/TD waiver \ntypically transition into the persons with disabilities waiver at 21 years of age.”  See “Report of \nMedicaid Services for Persons who are Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent,” January \n2010, Pl. Ex. A at 13.   \n2 Recent litigation highlights the State of Illinois’ heavy reliance on segregated, \ninstitutional settings to serve people with disabilities, contrary to the national trend of serving \npeople with disabilities in the community and the Olmstead mandate. See Ligas v. Maram, No. \n05-C-4331 (N.D. Ill.); Williams v. Quinn, No. 05-C-4673 (N.D. Ill.).  The Department of Justice \nhas participated in both cases in various capacities, including by participating as a non-party in \nthe Ligas settlement conference and filing a statement of interest in support of the Joint Proposed \nConsent Decree in Williams.   \n3The proposed class does not require individual determinations of eligibility as “qualified \nindividuals with disability” or “otherwise qualified” under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 26 Filed: 07/16/10 Page 3 of 16 PageID #:521\nfor enforcing the integration mandate of title II and certification of the proposed class is \nconsistent with decisions by federal courts in cases alleging similar discrimination.  Accordingly, \nthis Court should grant the Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification.   \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n  The State of Illinois has opted to take advantage of Medicaid’s waiver programs in order \nto provide home and community-based services to persons with disabilities who would otherwise \nbe cared for in hospitals and other institutions.  The “waiver” authority permits the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to waive certain Medicaid requirements in order for the State to \noffer the services.  See 42 U.S.C. §1396m(b)-(h); 42 C.F.R. §430.25(d). 4  Defendant has \nrestricted eligibility for the MF/TD waiver program for persons under the age of 21. 5   See Ill. \nAdm. Code tit. 89, § 120.530.  These individuals would otherwise require a level of care required \nby a skilled nursing facility or a hospital.  Id.  After reaching the age of 21, most individuals \ntransition to the HSP waiver program, which provides in-home care for adults with severe \ndisabilities who would otherwise have to be cared for in institutions.  See Ill. Admin. Code tit. \n89, § 676.10.  The HSP program has significant funding caps, and as a result, individuals often \n                                                                                                                                                             \nbecause the disabilities which qualify them for enrollment in the MF/TD waiver similarly make \nthem eligible for protection under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  \n4 States can submit requests for approval to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices (“CMS”) to alter the terms of a particular waiver application at any time. See 42 C.F.R. \n§ 441.355.  Such requests are regularly granted by CMS.  See Knowles v. Horn, 2010 WL \n517591 (N.D. Tex., Feb. 10, 2010) (citing to Grooms v. Maram, 563 F. Supp. 2d 840, 857 (N.D. \nIll., 2008) (“[T]he federal government has not denied a single waiver application in the last ten \nyears. Defendant here presents no basis to believe the federal government would deny the State’s \napplication for an amendment in this case and the court will not concoct one.”)   \n5 The Illinois Medicaid plan includes nine separate waiver programs.  See Illinois \nDepartment of Healthcare and Family Services, “Home and Community Based Services Waiver \nPrograms,” http://www.hfs.illinois.gov/hcbswaivers/. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 26 Filed: 07/16/10 Page 4 of 16 PageID #:522\nexperience a significant reduction of services, which places them at risk of institutionalization. \n  Plaintiff William R. Hampe has severe and profound disabilities and extensive medical \nneeds.  (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 18a-c).   Prior to this lawsuit, he received funding for approximately 16 \nhours a day (112 hours per week) of skilled nursing care in his home at a cost of approximately \n$18,000 per month.  (Compl. ¶ 19).  He requires a skilled nursing level of care and his treating \nphysician states that the alternative to medical home care is inpatient hospitalization, at a rate of \napproximately $55,000 per month.  (Id. at ¶¶ 18e, 19). \n  Plaintiff Hampe aged out of the MF/TD waiver program on his 21st birthday, June 18, \n2010.  In April 2010, defendant notified him that he would transition to the HSP program,6 under \nwhich he was entitled to an “exceptional care rate” of only $9,429 per month for medical care in \nhis home.  (Id. at ¶ 42).  This amount is approximately 50 percent less than the amount he \nreceived under the MF/TD waiver program and is insufficient to meet the costs of the skilled \nnursing services he requires to remain in the community.  (Id. at ¶ 43).  Consequently, Plaintiff \nHampe faces the prospect of entering a hospital or remaining in the community without \nsufficient medical services, placing him at risk of death.  (Id. at ¶ 20).  Defendant agreed to \nmaintain the level of services Plaintiff received prior to his 21st birthday until further order of this \nCourt.  (Agreed Order, May 28, 2010 [Docket No. 11]).   \n  Plaintiff Hampe resides with his mother and guardian, Jill Hampe, in Wheaton, Illinois.  \n(Compl. at ¶ 18f).  The proposed reduction will force him into an institutional setting, isolating \n                                                 \n6 The HSP program provides services to assist individuals with severe disabilities in \nremaining in their homes instead of an institutional setting.  See \nhttp://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=36737.  The HSP is authorized by the Persons with \nDisabilities waiver program.  See Radaszewski v. Maram, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24923, at *7 \n(N.D. Ill. 2008) (overturned on other grounds). \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 26 Filed: 07/16/10 Page 5 of 16 PageID #:523\nhim from the community and his mother.  (Id. at ¶¶ 45, 49).  The cost of his care in an institution, \nat a rate of $55,000 per month, would be substantially greater than the cost of allowing him to \nremain in the community, at approximately $18,000 per month.  (Id. at ¶¶ 19, 22).   \nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \n  This case involves the proper interpretation and application of the integration mandate of \ntitle II of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, which the Department of Justice has the authority \nto enforce and for which the Department issues implementing regulations.  See 42 U.S.C. § 2133 \nand § 12134.  The United States has a strong commitment to realizing the goals of community \nintegration as set forth in Olmstead.7  Ending the unnecessary segregation of individuals with \ndisabilities is one of the key tenets of the ADA.  In enacting the ADA in 1990, Congress found \nthat “historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, \ndespite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities \ncontinue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.”  42 U.S.C.  § 12101(a)(2).  As directed \nby Congress, 42 U.S.C. § 12134, the Attorney General issued regulations implementing title II, \nwhich are based on regulations issued under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.8  See 42 \n                                                 \n7 See “President Obama Commemorates Anniversary of Olmstead and Announces New \nInitiatives to Assist Americans with Disabilities,” June 22, 2009, Office of the Press Secretary, \navailable at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Commemorates-\nAnniversary-of-Olmstead-and-Announces-New-Initiatives-to-Assist-Americans-with-\nDisabilities/). \n8 Title II, which prohibits discrimination by public entities, was modeled closely on \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, which prohibits discrimination \non the basis of disability in federally conducted programs and in all of the operations of public \nentities that receive federal financial assistance.  Title II provides that “[t]he remedies, \nprocedures, and rights” set forth under Section 504 shall be available to any person alleging \ndiscrimination in violation of Title II.  42 U.S.C. § 12133; see also 42 U.S.C. § 12201(a) (ADA \nmust not be construed more narrowly than Rehabilitation Act).  The ADA directs the Attorney \nGeneral to promulgate regulations to implement Title II and requires those regulations to be \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 26 Filed: 07/16/10 Page 6 of 16 PageID #:524\nU.S.C. § 12134(a); 28 C.F.R. § 35.190(a); Executive Order 12250, 45 Fed. Reg. 72995 (1980), \nreprinted in 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1.  The title II regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), require public \nentities to “administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  The preamble discussion of \nthe “integration regulation” explains that “the most integrated setting” is one that “enables \nindividuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.”  \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n  Eleven years ago, the Supreme Court applied these authorities and held that title II \nprohibits the unjustified segregation of individuals with disabilities.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 586.  \nOlmstead held that public entities are required to provide community-based services for persons \nwith disabilities who would otherwise be entitled to institutional services when a) treatment \nprofessionals reasonably determine it is appropriate; b) the affected persons do not oppose such \ntreatment; and c) the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the \nresources available to the entity and the needs of others who are receiving disability services \nfrom the entity.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607. \n  A public entity’s duty to provide integrated (i.e., community-based) services, however, is \nnot absolute.  A public entity is required only to make reasonable modifications that do not \n                                                                                                                                                             \nconsistent with preexisting federal regulations that coordinated federal agencies’ application of \nSection 504 to recipients of federal financial assistance and interpreted certain aspects of Section \n504 as applied to the federal government itself.  42 U.S.C. § 12134(a)-(b).  Title II thus extended \nSection 504’s pre-existing prohibition against disability-based discrimination in programs and \nactivities (including state and local programs and activities) receiving federal financial assistance \nor conducted by the federal government itself to all operations of state and local governments, \nwhether or not they receive federal assistance.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are \ngenerally construed to impose the same requirements.  See Radaszewski ex rel. Radaszewski v. \nMaram, 383 F.3d 599, 607 (7th Cir. 2004); Washington v. Indiana High School Athletic Ass’n, \nInc., 181 F.3d 840, 845 n.2 (7th Cir. 1999).  \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 26 Filed: 07/16/10 Page 7 of 16 PageID #:525\n“fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) \n(2009).  Thus, a public entity violates title II if it segregates individuals in institutions when those \nindividuals could be served in the community through reasonable modifications to its program, \nunless it is able to demonstrate that doing so would result in a “fundamental alteration” of its \nprogram.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 595-596.      \nARGUMENT \n  Defendant’s policy of providing inadequate home and community-based services for the \nproposed class solely because they reach the age of 21 places them at risk of institutionalization \nand therefore violates the integration mandate of title II.  Courts in this district, as well as the \nIllinois Court of Appeals, have recognized that defendant’s “age-out” policy under the MF/TD \nwaiver program is problematic under title II.  See Radaszewski v. Maram, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n24923 (N.D. Ill. 2008) (J. Darrah) (State of Illinois violates title II of the ADA by failing to fully \nfund the cost of private-duty nursing care that plaintiff, who had aged out of the MF/TD waiver \nprogram, required in order to remain in the community); Grooms v. Maram, 563 F. Supp. 2d 840 \n(N.D. Ill. 2008) (J. Pallmeyer); Sidell v. Maram, No. 05-C-1001 (C.D. Ill. 2009) (ordering relief \nfor plaintiff who aged out of MF/TD waiver program because the “State of Illinois may modify \nthe adult waiver program to accommodate [plaintiff]’s needs and provide services”); Jones v. \nMaram, 867 N.E.2d 563 (Ill. App. Ct. 2007) (affirming lower court granting of preliminary \ninjunction for plaintiff who aged out of  MF/TD waiver program and was at-risk of \ninstitutionalization); Fisher v.

Plaintiffs Meet the Legal Standard for Class Certification Under Rule 23. \n \n  Certification of the proposed class is proper. 9  To proceed as a class action, a class must \nfirst satisfy the threshold requirements under Rule 23(a): (1) the class is so numerous that joinder \nof all members is impracticable; (2) there are common questions of fact and law; (3) the claims \nor defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) \nthe representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  Fed R. Civ. \nP. 23(a).  Harper v. Sheriff of Cook County, 581 F.3d 511, 513 (7th Cir. 2009); Rosario v. \nLivaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1017 (7th Cir. 1992).  Second, the moving party must show that the \nproposed class falls within at least one of the three categories set forth in Rule 23(b).10       \na.  Plaintiffs Meet the Numerosity Requirement. \n  Rule 23(a)(1) requires that the proposed class be “so numerous that joinder of all persons \nis impracticable.”  Plaintiffs need not specify the exact number of class members.   See Marcial \nv. Coronet Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 954 (7th Cir. 1989).  The Seventh Circuit has held that joinder was \nimpracticable where a class was comprised of 40 individuals.  See, e.g., Swanson v. Am. \nConsumer Indus., 415 F.2d 1326, 1333 (7th Cir. 1969); see also Armes v. Shanta Enterprise, \nInc., 2009 WL 2020781, at *2 (N.D.Ill. 2009).  As of September 1, 2009, 504 children were \n                                                 \n9 While the Court need not accept as true all facts alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint at this \nstage of litigation, the decision to certify a class does not depend on the strengths or weaknesses \nof the claims, but rather on whether the representatives and potential class satisfy the \nrequirements of Rule 23.  See Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177 (1974); Szabo v. \nBridgeport Machines, Inc., 249 F.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir. 2001); Williams, 2006 WL 3332844, at * \n3.  The Court’s determination whether class certification is appropriate therefore does not \ninvolve an inquiry into the merits.  Young v. County of Cook, 2007 WL 1238920, at *5 (N.D. Ill. \n2007). \n10 Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2), which permits certification if the \ndefendant has “acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby \nmaking appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole.”  See Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(b)(2); Mot. Class Certif. ¶1.   \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 26 Filed: 07/16/10 Page 9 of 16 PageID #:527\nreceiving services in the MF/TD waiver program.  See Pl. Ex. A at 3.  From July 1, 2007, \nthrough June 30, 2008, 606 children received services under the MF/TD waiver.  Id.  Thirty-\nseven individuals aged out of waiver eligibility for the period from July 2007 to December 2009.  \nId. at 9.  Based solely on the number of individuals who will likely age out of the waiver in the \nnext 24 months, the proposed class approximates at least 40 individuals.  The class will include \nan even larger number given the fact that hundreds of individuals are currently enrolled in the \nMF/TD waiver.  The numerosity requirement is therefore satisfied.  \na.  Plaintiffs Meet the Commonality Requirement. \n \nThe commonality requirement does not necessitate “every class member’s factual or legal \nsituation to be a carbon copy” of those of the named plaintiffs, and thus the “low commonality \nhurdle is easily surmounted.”  Wesley v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 1992 WL 57948, at *3 \n(N.D. Ill. 1992); see also Gen. Tel. Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 155 (1982).  A \ncommon nucleus of operative fact satisfies the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).  See \nRosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d at 1018.  Common nuclei of fact exist where, as in this case, the \ndefendant has engaged in standardized conduct towards members of the proposed class.  See \nChandler v. Southwest Jeep-Eagle, Inc., 162 F.R.D. 302, 308 (N.D. Ill. 1995) (citing cases).     \nDefendant’s conduct in reducing services for all participants of the MF/TD waiver \nprogram has been uniform with respect to the plaintiff class and constitutes a “common nucleus \nof operative fact.”  Rosario, 963 F.2d at 1018.  Defendant’s policy applies regardless of \nindividual medical need and results solely because an individual has reached the age of 21.  \nMemo Class Cert. at 7.  Differences in the individualized facts regarding class members’ specific \nmedical needs and the community supports they require do not bar class certification.  Rolland v. \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 26 Filed: 07/16/10 Page 10 of 16 PageID #:528\nPatrick, 2008 WL 4104488, *4 (D. Mass.) (“any identified factual differences between the \nnamed Plaintiffs and some of the class . . . did not undermine commonality and, in particular, did \nnot preclude certification of a class of persons with mental retardation who were challenging \nDefendants’ practices.”)  Such factual differences can be addressed in the remedial phase.  \nRolland, 1999 WL 34815562, at *5 (D. Mass. 1999) (class certification was appropriate and \n“individualized determinations of needs and services were more properly left for post-judgment \nrelief”); Marisol A. v. Guiliani, 126 F.3d 372, 375 (2d Cir. 1997) (individual needs did not defeat \ncommonality).   Plaintiffs have therefore satisfied the commonality requirement. \nb.  Plaintiffs Meet the Typicality Requirement. \n \n  The question of typicality is closely related to the question of commonality.  Rosario, 963 \nF.2d at 1018.  A “plaintiff’s claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course \nof conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and his or her claims are based on \nthe same legal theory.”  De La Fuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir. \n1983) (citations and internal quotation omitted).  This requirement “primarily directs the district \ncourt to focus on whether the named representatives’ claims have the same essential \ncharacteristics as the claims of the class at large.”  Retired Chicago Police Ass’n v. City of \nChicago, 7 F.3d 584, 596-7 (7th Cir. 1993).11  Plaintiff Hampe’s claim has the “same essential \ncharacteristics” as the proposed class, namely, that defendant violates the integration mandate \nthrough its policy of reducing services when an individual reaches the age of 21.  Further, the \n                                                 \n11 This requirement is intended to ensure that class representatives will represent the best \ninterests of the class members who take a less active role.  It overlaps substantially with the \nrequirement that class representatives be members of the class.  Robinson v. Sheriff of Cook Co., \n167 F.3d 1155, 1157 (7th Cir. 1999). \n \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 26 Filed: 07/16/10 Page 11 of 16 PageID #:529\nremedy that plaintiffs seek is a declaratory judgment requiring the State to maintain services in \nthe community.  (Compl. at 16-17).  The typicality requirement is therefore satisfied. \nc.  Plaintiff Hampe is an Adequate Representative of the Class. \n \n   Rule 23(a)(4) requires that the named plaintiff “fairly and adequately protect the interests \nof the class.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4).  Courts generally make two inquiries here.  First, plaintiff \nmust not have claims antagonistic to or in conflict with those of other class members and must \nhave sufficient interest in the case’s outcome to be a vigorous advocate.  Second, plaintiff's \ncounsel must be qualified, experienced, and able to conduct the proposed litigation.  See Rosario, \n963 F.2d at 1018.  Plaintiff Hampe is an adequate representative of the class.  His claims derive \nfrom the same violation of federal law as the other proposed class members.  His interest in \nobtaining injunctive relief to prevent defendant from reducing medical services coincides with \nthe general interests of the proposed class.12  Thus, adequacy of representation is satisfied.   \nd. Plaintiffs Meet the Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). \n  Finally, plaintiffs seek certification as a class under Rule 23(b)(2), which requires that \n“plaintiffs . . .  need merely show that defendants acted on grounds generally applicable to the \nclass for which they seek declaratory and injunctive relief.”  Williams, 2006 WL 3332844, at * 4. \nDeclaratory and injunctive actions that present common questions such as a state policy for \ntreatment of persons who automatically become ineligible for continued Medicaid benefits is \nsuitable for class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2).  See Jefferson v. Ingersoll Int’l Inc., 195 \n                                                 \n12 Plaintiff’s counsel also satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(g).  Robert Farley is an \nexperienced advocate who previously has represented clients in both title II cases and class \nactions.  See Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, No. 00-C-5392 (N.D. Ill.) (Title II case); Bullock v. \nSheahan, No. 04-C-1051 (N.D. Ill.) (class counsel); Gary v. Sheahan, No. 96-C-7294 (N.D. Ill.) \n(class counsel).   \n \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 26 Filed: 07/16/10 Page 12 of 16 PageID #:530\nF.3d 894, 897 (7th Cir. 1999.)  Plaintiffs do not seek damages, so the concern for individualized \ndamage awards that often drives the distinction between certifying a Rule 23(b)(2) class and a \nRule 23(b)(3) class is not present.  Lemon v. IUOE, Local 139, 216 F.3d 577 (7th Cir. 1999).13  \nPlaintiffs allege that defendant’s policies and practices discriminate against them by denying \nclass members the resources necessary to reside in the community.  Defendant’s conduct is \ngenerally applicable and therefore satisfies the requirement under Rule 23(b)(2).    \nII.  Title II Integration Claims Often Require Systemic Reform and Class \nActions are Appropriate Mechanisms for Adjudicating Such Claims. \n \nThe class action is an appropriate mechanism for achieving relief for violations of title II \nin the community integration context.  Integration claims typically involve large service systems \nthat affect hundreds or thousands of individuals who rely on the state for their medical care.  \nCourts have routinely granted class certification in ADA cases and specifically in Olmstead \ncases.14   The class action is therefore a useful and necessary tool for addressing such systemic \nproblems.  The alternative — forcing individual plaintiffs, who are by virtue of their membership \nin the class, without resources to litigate independently to pursue individual complaints — is an \nunfair and inefficient use of judicial resources.15   \n                                                 \n13 Even if the Court were to determine that individual determination of each class \nmember’s claims were important, the Court could bifurcate the case and review the injunctive \nrelief — i.e., changing the state’s policy — under Rule 23(b)(2), and the delivery of appropriate \nremedy under Rule 23(b)(3) on a case-by-case basis.  See Jefferson, 195 F.3d at 898.  \n14 See, e.g., Ball et al v. Rodgers, 492 F.3d 1094 (9th Cir. 2007); Frederick L. v. Dept. of \nPublic Welfare, 364 F.3d 487 (3d Cir. 2004); State of Connecticut Office of Protection and \nAdvocacy v. Connecticut, 2010 WL 1416146 (D. Conn. 2010); Messier v. Southbury Training \nSchool, 562 F. Supp. 2d 294 (D. Conn. 2008); Rolland v. Patrick, 2008 WL 4104488 (D. Mass. \nAug. 19, 2008); Colbert v. Blagojevich, No. 07-C-4737 (N.D. Ill. 2008); Williams v. Quinn, No. \n05-C-4673 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 11, 2006).   \n15 This is a case in which the declaratory judgment as to the entire class may lead to \nnegotiations on each class member’s actual remedy, but that does not change the determination \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 26 Filed: 07/16/10 Page 13 of 16 PageID #:531\nFor instance, in Williams, Judge Hart certified a class of Illinois residents alleging title II \nviolations who a) have a mental illness; b) are institutionalized in a privately owned Institution \nfor Mental Diseases; and c) with appropriate supports and services may be able to live in an \nintegrated setting.  Williams, 2006 WL 3332844, at *5.  The Court determined that class \ncertification was appropriate because, as in this case, “defendant’s conduct toward the class \nlargely defines the class.”  Id. at *12.  In Colbert, Judge Lefkow certified a class of “all \nMedicaid-eligible adults with disabilities in Cook County, Illinois, who are being, or may in the \nfuture be, unnecessarily confined to nursing facilities and who, with appropriate supports and \nservices, may be able to live in a community setting.”  Colbert, 2008 WL 4442597, at *10.   \n  Defendant’s administration of its waiver programs constitutes an extensive benefits \nsystem that serves thousands of Illinois residents.  The MF/TD waiver program sets the \nmaximum capacity of individuals at 700 persons,16 while the PWD waiver program has a \ncapacity at 27,870 persons.17  Together, these programs constitute a sizeable amount of the \nstate’s community-based services.  Plaintiffs’ claims will require system-wide change in policies \nto ensure that defendant’s Medicaid program allows individuals to live in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to their needs.  \n  Moreover, defendant’s refusal to modify the policy and practice despite the fact that \nindividual plaintiffs have successfully challenged this very policy in five separate lawsuits \nunderscores the need to address this problem on a systemic, class-wide basis.  See Radaszewski, \n                                                                                                                                                             \nthat this is suitable for a decision under Rule 23(b)(2).

LEXIS 24923;18 Grooms, 563 F. Supp. 2d 840; Sidell, No. 05-C-1001; Jones, \n867 N.E.2d 563; Fisher, No. 06-C-4405.  Each of these lawsuits determined that defendant’s \npolicy of reducing medical funding at age 21 violates the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  \nCertification of the proposed class advances the Court’s interest in judicial economy because it \nallows simultaneous and efficient adjudication of the issues common to the class.  See \nThorogood v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 547 F.3d 742, 744 (7th Cir. 2008) (“The class action is an \ningenious device for economizing on the expense of litigation.”)  If the class is not certified, \nproposed class members will be required to file individual lawsuits. Due to their limited financial \nresources and extensive medical issues, class members are unlikely to initiate individual actions. \nContrary to defendant’s assertion that the court must first conduct individualized hearings \nas to whether a plaintiff is “qualified” or “otherwise qualified,” (Def. Resp. Class Cert. at 5-\n11), the issue for declaratory judgment is common to all members of the class — whether the \nstate’s polices violate the integration mandate of Olmstead and title II of the ADA.  Any need for \nindividualized determinations of benefits is a mechanical application of correct policies and \nprocedures.  See Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 151 F.3d 402, 414 (5th Cir. 1998); Jefferson, \n195 F.3d at 898; Berger, 338 F.3d at 763.  The central question in this litigation — whether the \ndefendant’s administration of its waiver programs is consistent with the Olmstead integration \nmandate — can be answered without regard to individual class members’ diagnoses or \ncircumstance.  Indeed, it is the state’s systemic failure to make individualized determinations \n                                                 \n18 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court’s entry of \njudgment on the pleadings for the defendant after a thorough analysis of the Olmstead integration \nmandate, the waiver programs and the state’s claimed defenses.  Radaszweski v. Maram, 383 \nF.3d 599 (7th Cir 2004).  The court determined that “the integration mandate may well require \nthe State to make reasonable modifications to the form of existing services in order to adopt them \nto community-integrated settings.”  Id. at 611. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 26 Filed: 07/16/10 Page 15 of 16 PageID #:533\nbased on a person’s need that has led to this litigation.    \nConclusion \n  For the above stated reasons, the Court should grant Plaintiff’s Motion for Class \nCertification.  With the Court’s permission, counsel for the United States will be present at any \nupcoming hearings. \nDated: July 16, 2010   \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n              ERIC H.

Farley, Jr., Ltd., and \nfiles the following second amended complaint against the Defendant as follows: \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Plaintiffs, William R. Hampe (William), Richard L. Winfrey III (Richard) and \nAdam Cale (Adam) are  medically fragile disabled persons who currently receives funding from \nthe Defendant for approximately 16 hours a day skilled nursing level of care at their home at a \ncost of approximately $18,000 per month, so that they do not have to be institutionalized or \nhospitalized for their entire life at a rate of approximately $55,000 per month.  William's, \nRichard's and Adam's funding from the Defendant comes from the State of Illinois \"Medicaid \nHome and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver for Children that are Medically Fragile, \nTechnology Dependent\" program  (MF/TD) and Medicaid. \n1 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 2 of 29 PageID #:715\n2.  William's, Richard's and Adam's enrollment in the MF/TD program is only available \nto persons under the age of21 and William will turn 21 on June 18, 2010; Richard will turn 21 \non August 16, 2010; and Adam will turn 21 on August 29,2010.  When William or Richard or \nAdam or any disabled person turns 21 in the MF/TD program, the Defendant's policy and \npractice is to reduce the existing medical funding by approximately 50% based solely on the fact \nthat the person is now 21.  The reduction in funding is not due to a change in William's or \nRichard's or Adam's medical needs but on the fact that William's, Richard's and Adam's \nfunding at age 21 comes from a different State program, which has significant caps on funding. \nThe reduction in funding will either result in William, Richard and Adam becoming \ninstitutionalized (hospitalized) or if they remain in their family home without sufficient skilled \nnursing care, then they face a strong possibility of imminent death. \n3.  Prior to the filing of this lawsuit by William, Richard and Adam, the Defendant has \nbeen successfully challenged by individual plaintiffs in 5 separate lawsuits over its practice and \npolicy of reducing medical funding which results in a reduction of medical services when the \ndisabled person turns 21 years of age.1  Despite the fact that the Defendant has not prevailed to \nprovide reduce medical funding in these 5 separate federal and state lawsuits brought by similarly \nsituated persons like the Plaintiff who were turning 21 and aging out of the MF /TO program, the \nDefendant continues the same practice to date to reduce medical funding at age 21 as evidence by \nWilliam's, Richard's and Adam's case.  Accordingly, William, Richard and Adam brings this \n1  See Radaszewski v. Maram, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24923 (N.D. Ill.); Grooms v. \nMaram, 563 F.Supp.2d 840 (N.D.Ill. 2008); Jones v. Maram, 373 Ill.App.3d 184, 867 N.E.2d \n563 (Tct Dist. 2007); Sidell v. Maram, 05 cv 1001 (C.D. Ill.) and Fisher v. Maram, 06 C 4405 \n(N.D. Ill.). \n2 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 3 of 29 PageID #:716\nlawsuit, individually and on behalf of a class, seeking injunctive relief to prevent the Defendant \nfrom reducing the level of medical care currently provided to William, Richard and Adam and \nthe putative class, which are necessary to prevent institutionalization (hospitilization), which is a \nmore costly and a more restrictive setting than the current home placement. \n4.  This class action lawsuit is necessary in order to stop the Defendant from continuing to \nsystematically violate the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act for persons \naging out of the \"MF/TD\" program.  (See prior successful litigation by plaintiffs against the State \nof Illinois over the \"MFl TD\" program where the State was required to continue to fund the same \nlevel of medical services which existed prior to the age of 21 years: Radaszewski v. Mar am, 2008 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 24923 (N.D. Ill.)(March 26, 2008); Grooms v. Maram, 563 F.Supp.2d 840 \n(N.D.Ill. 2008); Jones v. Maram, 373 Ill.App.3d 184 (3rd Dist. 2007); Sidell v. Maram, 05 cv \n1001 (C.D. Ill.)(January 14, 2009); and Fisher v. Maram, 06 C 4405 (N.D. Ill.)(January 8, \n2009)). \nII.  JURISDICTION & VENUE \n5.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relieve to enforce the rights of the \nPlaintiff and the class he seeks to represent under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \nSec. 12132 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794(a). \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs federal law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \nSections 1331 and 1343.

When he attends class \nhe has technology support and a nurse accompanies him to class. \n9( d).  A skilled nursing level of care is required for Richard. \n9(e).  The alternative to Richard's skilled nursing care at his residence is inpatient \nhospitalization.  Dr. Gregory Milania has stated that Richard's alternative to medical home care \nis admission to a hospital. \n9(f).  Richard resides with his mother, father and brother in Aurora, Illinois. \n10(a).  The Plaintiff, Adam Cale (Adam) will be 21 years old on August 29,2010, is \nmedically fragile and currently receives funding from the Defendant for approximately 16 hours a \nday skilled nursing level of care at his home (116.5 hours per week) plus he is eligible for 336 \nrespite skilled nursing hours per year.

Adam also receives funding for 51.5 hours of \npersonal assistant services per week. \n1O  (b ).  Adam is severely disabled and medically fragile.  He has quadriplegia secondary \nto a cervical cord injury during infancy.  Due to his quadriplegia, his respiratory system has been \ncompromised and he remains on C-pap at night.  He has multiple medical factors that complicate \nhis condition, thus necessitating increased needs in assisting of his care.  He has a neurogenic \nbladder, tracheostomy and feeding tube that requires more care than he is able to provide.  He is \nwheelchair dependent.  His disability is permanent.  Adam is completely dependent on someone \nfor all his care. \n5 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 6 of 29 PageID #:719\n10 ( c).

Adam is enrolled at Western Illinois University and will be a senior when school \ncommences in August, 2010 and is a double major and resides in the dormitory and currently \nreceives skilled and unskilled nursing services so he can remain in the community. \n11.  The Defendant, Julie Hamos, is the Director ofthe Illinois Department ofHealthcare \nand Family Services (HFS) and is being sued in her official capacity. \nIV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n12.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and as a class action pursuant to \nRule 23(b)(2) ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n13.  The Class consists of the following: \nAll persons who are enrolled or will be enrolled or were \nenrolled in the State of Illinois Medically Fragile, Technology \nDependent Medicaid Waiver Program (MF/TD) or Medicaid and \nwhen they obtain the age of21 years are subjected to reduce \nMedicaid funding which reduces the medical level of care which \nthey had been receiving prior to obtaining 21 years. \n14.  The Class is so numerous that joinder of all persons is impracticable.  The Illinois \nDepartment of Healthcare and Family Services \"Report of Medicaid Services for Persons who \nare Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent\" dated December, 2009 stated that as of \nSeptember 1, 2009, 504 children were receiving services in the MF lTD program on that specific \ndate.  The report further states that from July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008, 606 children had \n6 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 7 of 29 PageID #:720\nreceived services in the MF/TD program and for the period of July 1, 2007 through December, \n2009, 37 individuals aged out ofthe waiver.  In Jones v. Maram, 373 Ill.App.3d 184 (3'd Dist. \n2007), Barbara Ginder from the State of Illinois stated in an affidavit \"there were 34 active cases \nof 18 to 20-year-old individuals, 19 of whom were ventilator dependent\" in the MFTDC \nprogram. !d., at 192.  \"Ginder stated these individuals are likely to transition from MF/TD to \nHSP [Home Services Program] (ifthey select) at age 21.\" !d.  The class members have limited \nfinancial resources and are unlikely to institute individual actions. \n15.  The claims of the class members raise common questions of law and fact.  These \ninclude: \n(a)  Whether the Defendant  violated the ADA and Rehabilitation Act by reducing the \nlevel of funding for persons enrolled in the Illinois Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent \nMedicaid Waiver Program which resulted in a reduction of medical services. \n(b) Whether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act permits the Defendant to reduce the \nlevel of funding which results in a reduction of medical services for disabled persons after the \nage of 21, even though there has been no change in their medical needs. \n(c) Whether a fundamental alteration of the Illinois disability programs would occur if \nthe Defendant provided funding to continue the same level of services for the Plaintiff and the \nputative class when they turn the age of 21 years. \n(d)  Whether compelling an increase in the \"exceptional care rate\" for persons exiting \nthe MF/TD program into the Illinois Home Services Program is unreasonable under the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act. \n(e) Whether the Illinois disability programs can reasonable accommodate a \n7 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 8 of 29 PageID #:721\nmodification to their existing programs to allow the Plaintiff and putative class to continue to \nreceive the same level of care in the community when they turn 21 years of age. \nThe common questions of fact and law predominate over questions affecting only \nindividual class members. \n16.  The Plaintiffs claims are typical ofthe class members' claims. \n17.  The Plaintiffs are an adequate representative of the class because they suffer from \ndeprivations identical to those of the class members and has been denied the same federal rights \nthat they seek to enforce on behalf of the other class members.  The Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately represent the interests ofthe other class members, many of whom are unable to \npursue claims on their own behalf as the result of their disabilities.  Plaintiffs interest in obtaining \ninjunctive relief for the violations of constitutional rights and privileges are consistent with and \nnot antagonistic to those of any person within the class.  Plaintiffs counsel is qualified, \nexperienced and able to conduct the proposed litigation. \n18.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of the controversy in that: \n(i) A multiplicity of suits with consequent burden on the courts and defendants \nshould be avoided. \n(ii) It would be virtually impossible for all class members to intervene as parties \nplaintiffs in this action. \n19.  The Defendant has acted or refused to act on grounds applicable to the class, thereby \nmaking appropriate final injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \nV.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  Plaintiff William R. Hampe \n8 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 9 of 29 PageID #:722\n20(a).  The Plaintiff, William R. Hampe (William) will be 21 years old on June 18, 2010, \nis medically fragile and currently receives funding from the Defendant for approximately 16 \nhours a day skilled nursing level of care at his home (112 hours per week) plus he is eligible for \n336 respite skilled nursing hours per year.  These nursing services are either provided by a \nregistered nurse (RN) or a licensed practical nurse (LPN). \n20(b).  William is severely and profoundly developmentally disabled.  He is blind, non \nverbal and wheelchair bound.  William is completely dependent on someone for all his care. \n20(c).  William is medically fragile and has a complex medical history including \ndiagnoses reactive airway disease, cerebral palsy, intractable epilepsy, developmental delay and \nmicrocephaly.  He remains on BiPap (a ventilatory support system) and continues to require \nfrequent suctioning ofhis tracheostomy.  William gets all his nutrition via aj-tube. \n20( d).  A skilled nursing level of care is required for William. \n20(e).  The alternative to William's skilled nursing care at his residence is inpatient \nhospitalization.  Dr. Keith Veselik, William's treating physician has stated that William's \nalternative to medical home care is admission to a hospital. \n20(f).  William resides with his mother I guardian, Jill Hampe in Wheaton, Illinois. \n21.  William's current funding from the Defendant comes from the \"Medicaid Home and \nCommunity-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver for Children that are Medically Fragile, Technology \nDependent.\" (MF/TD) and Medicaid.  William receives funding from the Defendant for skilled \nnursing level of care at his home at a cost of approximately $18,000 per month, so that he does \nnot have to be institutionalized or hospitalized for his entire life at a rate of approximately \n$55,000 per month. \n9 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 10 of 29 PageID #:723\n22.  William's enrollment in the MF/TD program is only available to persons under the \nage of21 and William will turn 21 on June 18,2010.  When William or any disabled person \nturns 21 in the MF/TD program, the Defendant's policy and practice is to reduce continuing \nmedical funding by approximately 50% based solely on the fact that the person is now 21.  The \nreduction in funding is not due to a change in William's medical needs but on the fact that \nWilliam's funding at age 21 comes from a different State program, which has significant caps on \nfunding.  The reduction in funding will either result in William becoming institutionalized \n(hospitalized) or if he remains in his family home without skilled nursing care, then he faces a \nstrong possibility of imminent death. \n23.  William has been informed by the Defendant that when he turns 21 years of age on \nJune 18, 2010, he will be subjected to reduce funding at approximately 50% of his cun-ent rate \nand that William will be unable to maintain the same level of intensive skilled nursing care \nwhich he needs.  The State of Illinois has informed William through his mother, that once \nWilliam turns 21, he will only be entitled to receive an \"exceptional care rate\" of $9,426 per \nmonth in funding to address his medical needs ifhe wishes to remain living in the family home. \nThis monthly rate of $9,426 is completely inadequate to provide William the current skilled \nnursing level of care in his home which he requires due to his medical condition.  Accepting the \nrate of $9,426 and remaining in his home would likely result in the death of William.  This State \npolicy of paying only an 'exceptional care rate' of $9,426 per month is in conflict with 5 recent \nFederal and State court cases, where the Defendant was not permitted to reduce funding when a \nperson ages out of the MFTDC program. (See cases listed in paragraph 4 above) \n24.  If William was unable to receive the current level of skilled nursing care in his home, \n10 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 11 of 29 PageID #:724\nthen he would be forced to be institutionalized and obtain medical care in a hospital setting at a \nrate of approximately $55,000 per month, which costs more than his current level of funding in \nthe family home. \n25.  William is requesting injunctive relief to require the Defendant to provide funding to \nmaintain the current level of skilled nursing care which he receives in order that he may remain \nin the community and not be institutionalized or hospitalized for his entire life.  The actions of \nthe Defendant constitute unlawful discrimination under Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12132, and Section 504 ofthe Rehabilitation Act, 29 \nU.S.C. Sec. 794(a). \n26.  William is an individual with a disability. \n27.  William is a recipient ofMedical Assistance, commonly known as Medicaid. \nB.  Plaintiff Richard L. Winfrey, III \n28(a).  The Plaintiff, Richard L. Winfrey, III (Richard) will be 21 years old on August 16, \n2010, is medically fragile and currently receives funding from the Defendant for approximately \n16 hours a day skilled nursing level of care at his home (126 hours per week) plus he is eligible \nfor 336 respite skilled nursing hours per year.  These nursing services are either provided by a \nregistered nurse (RN) or a licensed practical nurse (LPN). \n28(b ).  Richard is severely disabled.  He has quadriplegia.  Richard is completely \ndependent on others for all activities of daily living.  Richard has a tracheostomy and an \nimplanted phrenic pacemaker. \n28(c).  Richard is continuing his education at Waubaunsee College.  When he attends \nclass he has technology support and a nurse accompanies him to class. \n11 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 12 of 29 PageID #:725\n28( d).  A skilled nursing level of care is required for Richard. \n28(e).  The alternative to Richard's skilled nursing care at his residence is inpatient \nhospitalization.  Dr. Gregory Milania has stated that Richard's alternative to medical home care \nis admission to a hospital. \n28(f).  Richard resides with his mother, father and brother in Aurora, Illinois. \n29.  Richard's current funding from the Defendant comes from the \"Medicaid Home and \nCommunity-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver for Children that are Medically Fragile, Technology \nDependent.\" (MF/TD) and Medicaid.  Richard receives funding from the Defendant for skilled \nnursing level of care at his home at a cost of approximately $18,000 per month, so that he does \nnot have to be institutionalized or hospitalized for his entire life at a rate of approximately \n$55,000 per month. \n30.  Richard's enrollment in the MF/TD program is only available to persons under the \nage of21 and Richard will turn 21 on August 16,2010.  When Richard or any disabled person \nturns 21  in the MF/TD program, the Defendant's policy and practice is to reduce continuing \nmedical funding by approximately 50% based solely on the fact that the person is now 21.  The \nreduction in funding is not due to a change in Richard's medical needs but on the fact that \nRichard's funding at age 21 comes from a different State program, which has significant caps on \nfunding.  The reduction in funding will either result in Richard becoming institutionalized \n(hospitalized) or if he remains in his family home without skilled nursing care, then he faces a \nstrong possibility of imminent death. \n3 1.  Richard has been informed that when he turns 21 years of age on August 16, 2010, he \nwill be subjected to reduce funding at approximately 50% of his current rate and that William \n12 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 13 of 29 PageID #:726\nwill be unable to maintain the same level of intensive skilled nursing care which he needs. \n32.  If Richard was unable to receive the current level of skilled nursing care in his home, \nthen he would be forced to be institutionalized and obtain medical care in a hospital setting at a \nrate of approximately $55,000 per month, which costs more than his current level of funding in \nthe family home. \n33.  Richard is requesting injunctive relief to require the Defendant to provide funding to \nmaintain the current level of skilled nursing care which he receives in order that he may remain \nin the community and not be institutionalized or hospitalized for his entire life.  The actions of \nthe Defendant constitute unlawful discrimination under Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12132, and Section 504 ofthe Rehabilitation Act, 29 \nU.S.C. Sec. 794(a). \n34.  Richard is an individual with a disability. \n35.  Richard is a recipient of Medical Assistance, commonly known as Medicaid. \nC.  Plaintiff Adam Cale \n36(a).  The Plaintiff, Adam Cale (Adam) will be 21 years old on August 29,2010, is \nmedically fragile and currently receives funding from the Defendant for approximately 16 hours a \nday skilled nursing level of care at his home (116,5 hours per week) plus he is eligible for 336 \nrespite skilled nursing hours per year.  These nursing services are either provided by a registered \nnurse (RN) or a licensed practical nurse (LPN).  Adam also receives funding for 51.5 hours of \npersonal assistant services per week. \n36(b ).  Adam is severely disabled.  He has quadriplegia secondary to a cervical cord \ninjury during infancy.  Due to his quadriplegia, his respiratory system has been compromised and \n13 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 14 of 29 PageID #:727\nhe remains on C-pap at night.  He has multiple medical factors that complicate his condition, \nthus necessitating increased needs in assisting of his care.  He has a neurogenic bladder, \ntracheostomy and feeding tube that requires more care than he is able to provide.  He is \nwheelchair dependent.  His disability is permanent.  Adam is completely dependent on someone \nfor all his care. \n36(c).  Adam is continuing his education at Western Illinois University and will be a \nsenior when school commences in August, 2010 and is a double major and resides in the \ndormitory and currently receives skilled and unskilled nursing services so he can remain in the \ncommunity. \n36(d).  A skilled nursing level of care is required for Adam. \n36(e).  The alternative to Adam's skilled nursing level of care at his residence or \ndormitory is inpatient hospitalization.  Dr. David L. Miller, Adam's treating physician has stated \nthat Adam's alternative to medical home care is admission to a hospital. \n37.  Adam's current funding from the Defendant comes from the \"Medicaid Home and \nCommunity-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver for Children that are Medically Fragile, Technology \nDependent.\" (MF/TD) and Medicaid.  Adam receives funding from the Defendant for skilled \nnursing level of care at his home at a cost of approximately $18,000 per month, so that he does \nnot have to be institutionalized or hospitalized for his entire life at a rate of approximately \n$55,000 per month. \n38.  Adam's enrollment in the MF/TD program is only available to persons under the age \nof21 and Adam will turn 21 on August 29,2010.  When Adam or any disabled person turns 21 \nin the MF/TD program, the Defendant's policy and practice is to reduce continuing medical \n14 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 15 of 29 PageID #:728\nfunding by approximately 50% based solely on the fact that the person is now 21.  The reduction \nin funding is not due to a change in Adam's medical needs but on the fact that Adam's funding at \nage 21 comes from a different State program, which has significant caps on funding.  The \nreduction in funding will either result in Adam becoming institutionalized (hospitalized) or if he \nremains in his family home without skilled nursing care, then he faces a strong possibility of \nimminent death. \n39.  Adam has been informed that when he turns 21 years of age on August 29,2010, he \nwill be subjected to reduce funding of approximately 50% of his current rate.  Karen Engrstrom, \nthe Supervisor at the Division of Rehabilitation Services in Macomb, Illinois initially told Adam \nand/ or  his mother, that Adam would only receive funding of approximately $3,300 per month. \nOn August 6, 2010, Karen Engrstrom of DRS told Adam and his mother that he would receive \nfunding of $8,000 per month based on an exceptional care rate.  Adam will be unable to maintain \nthe same level of intensive skilled nursing care which he needs at the rate of $8,000 per month. \n40.  If Adam was unable to receive the current level of skilled nursing care in his home, \nthen he would be forced to be institutionalized and obtain medical care in a hospital setting at a \nrate of approximately $55,000 per month, which costs more than his current level of funding in \nthe family home. \n41.  Adam is requesting injunctive relief to require the Defendant to provide funding to \nmaintain the current level of skilled nursing care which he receives in order that he may remain \nin the community and not be institutionalized or hospitalized for his entire life.  The actions of \nthe Defendant constitute unlawful discrimination under Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12132, and Section 504 ofthe Rehabilitation Act, 29 \n15 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 16 of 29 PageID #:729\nU.S.C. Sec. 794(a). \n42.  Adam is an individual with a disability. \n43.  Adam is a recipient of Medical Assistance, commonly known as Medicaid. \nD.  The Federal/State Medical Assistance Program \n44.  Medical Assistance, commonly known as Medicaid, is a joint federal and stated \nfunded program enacted to provide necessary medical assistance to needy aged or disabled \npersons and families with dependent children, whose income and resources are insufficient to \nmeet the cost of care.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396.  States choosing to participate in the Medicaid \nprogram must operate the program in conformity with federal statutory and regulatory \nrequirements.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396a. \n45.  Each State participating in the Medicaid program must submit a Medicaid plan to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for approval.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396. \n46.  Each State must designate a single state agency to administer and I or supervise the \nadministration of the state's Medicaid plan.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396a(a)(5). \n47.  In Illinois, the Department ofHealthcare and Family Services (HFS) is the single \nstate agency responsible for administering the Medicaid program. \n48.  States have the option of covering persons needing home-and-community-based \nservices, if these persons would otherwise require institutional care that would be paid for by \nMedicaid.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396n(c)(l).  Under this waiver authority, the Secretary ofHHS may \ngrant waivers of specified requirements like service limitations that are otherwise applicable to \nthe State's Medicaid plan.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396n(c)(3).  Waiver programs must be cost-neutral in \nthat the average cost of providing care for program participants in the home or community based \n16 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 17 of 29 PageID #:730\nsetting must not exceed the estimated average cost of providing care in the institutional setting \nthey would require.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396n(c)(2)(D); 42 C.F.R. Sec. 441.302(e). \n49.  Illinois has implemented a total of nine (9) federally approved home-and-community \nbased care waiver programs in its Medicaid program which were approved by the Secretary of \nHealth & Human Services (HHS).  Two of the nine waiver programs are as follows: \n-Children that are Technology Dependent I Medically Fragile (MF/TD \n-Persons with Disabilities (Home Services for Adults with Disabilities) (HSP) \nE.  Medically Fragile I Technology Dependent Program (MF/TD). \n50.  Under the waiver program for Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent Children, \nIllinois pays for home-based care for children under age 21 who have exceptional medical needs. \nThe Illinois Department ofHealthcare and Family Services (HFS) administers this waiver \nprogram with participation of the University of Illinois' Division of Specialized Services for \nChildren (DSCC) under an agreement with HFS. \n51.  The Illinois Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (\"HCBS\") waiver \nprogram, which includes the MF/TD program, allows the State of Illinois to provide services to \npersons, like the Plaintiffs, in an individual's home or community as long as those services \nprevent the individual from being institutionalized or hospitalized. \n52.  The MF/TD waiver for children serves persons under 21 years of age who would \nrequire institutional care in a hospital or nursing facility, if nursing and waiver services were not \nprovided in the home.  Cost-effectiveness for eligibility is compared to service costs in a hospital \nor nursing facility.  The primary expenditure for children in the MF/TD waiver is skilled \nnursmg. \n17 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 18 of 29 PageID #:731\nF.  l~ersons with Disabilities (Home Services Program) (HSP) \n53.  Under the Home Services waiver program (HSP), Illinois funds services to \nenable disabled adults to remain in their homes or in a community setting.  The Illinois \nDepartment of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) administers the HSP program with the \nparticipation of the Division of Rehabilitative Services (DRS) of the Illinois Department of \nHuman Services (DHS) through an agreement with HFS. \nG.  William's Current Medical Plan \n54.  Currently, HFS provides a medical plan for William that is medically necessary and a \ncost-effective alternative to care in the institutional setting that HFS determined William would \notherwise require. \n55.  HFS has determined that William has a hospital need for care. \n56  Through the MF/TD waiver program and Medicaid, HFS pays for skilled nursing care \nwhich William needs in his home. \n57.  HFS approved and pays for approximately $18,000.00 of monthly medical services \nprovided by a registered nurse and a licensed practical nurse.  This plan allows William to meet \nthe costs for the salaries and benefits of the skilled nursing services that he requires. \n58.  William's current level of services is based upon a determination made by DSCC, \nafter a full evaluation of William, that he needed that level of care to avoid institutionalization \n(hospitilization).  DSCC's concluded that William would require hospitilization at an annual cost \nthat would far exceed the amount he was awarded. \n59.  As William approached his 21st birthday, DSCC staff discussed William's transition \ninto the Office of Rehabilitation Services Home Services (HSP) program and \"aging out\" of the \n18 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 19 of 29 PageID #:732\nMFITD waiver program. \n60.  William, through his mother, was advised by the Home Services Program (HSP) \noperated by the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS) in April, 2010, that William was \nentitled to an \"exceptional care rate\" for his in home care at a rate of $9,429 per month.  DHS \nadvised William, through his mother that this rate was the \"maximum\" which could be offered. \n61.  The exceptional care rate for William's medical care set forth in the above paragraph \nis not sufficient to meet the costs of the skilled nursing services which William requires. \n62.  The proposed reduction in funding I services by the Defendant is based solely on the \nfact that William will reach 21 years of age on June 18,2010.  The reduction in funding I \nservices is not due to a change in William's medical needs, which in fact have remained \nunchanged. \n63.  William's strong bond to his mother is threatened by isolation in an institution. \n64.  William's physicians have determined that William can be cared for at home safely \nand appropriately. \n65.  Under the laws governing the Home Services Program, HFS has discretion to set \nfunding for services for persons whose needs cannot be met by otherwise applicable caps, \nprovided that the program is cost neutral. \n66.  With no modifications in its regulations, and little modifications in its practices, HFS \ncould continue to fund the level of nursing care that William requires in order to remain at home \nat a cost that is less than would be required to serve him in an appropriate institutional setting for \nthe care he needs. \n67.  If allowed to go into effect, the proposed reduction in funding for William's medical \n19 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 20 of 29 PageID #:733\ncare will ultimately force William into an institutional setting (hospital), isolating him from \nhome and community, or alternatively, will likely result in his imminent death if he remains in \nhis home. \n68.  The Defendant has informed the Plaintiff, through his mother, that the reduced \nfunding will take effect on William's birthday, June 18, 2010. \nH.  Richard's Current Medical Plan \n69.  Currently, HFS provides a medical plan for Richard that is medically necessary and a \ncost-effective alternative to care in the institutional setting that HFS determined Richard would \notherwise require. \n70.  HFS has determined that Richard has a hospital need for care. \n71  Through the MF/TD waiver program and Medicaid, HFS pays for skilled nursing care \nwhich Richard needs in his home. \n72.  HFS approved and pays for approximately $18,000.00 of monthly medical services \nprovided by a registered nurse and a licensed practical nurse.  This plan allows Richard to meet \nthe costs for the salaries and benefits of the skilled nursing services that he requires. \n73.  Richard's current level of services is based upon a determination made by DSCC, \nafter a full evaluation of Richard, that he needed that level of care to avoid institutionalization \n(hospitilization).  DSCC's concluded that Richard would require hospitilization at an annual cost \nthat would far exceed the amount he was awarded. \n74.  As Richard approached his 21st birthday, DSCC staff discussed Richard's transition \ninto the Office of Rehabilitation Services Home Services (HSP) program and \"aging out\" of the \nMF/TD waiver program. \n20 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 21 of 29 PageID #:734\n75.  Richard has been advised under the HSP program, he is only entitled to an \n\"exceptional care rate\" for his in home care at a rate of approximately $9,429 per month. \n76.  The exceptional care rate for Richard's medical care set forth in the above paragraph \nis not sufficient to meet the costs of the skilled nursing services which Richard requires. \n77.  The proposed reduction in funding I services by the Defendant is based solely on the \nfact that Richard will reach 21 years of age on August 16, 201 0.  The reduction in funding I \nservices is not due to a change in Richard's medical needs, which in fact have remained \nunchanged. \n78.  Richard does not desire to be isolated in an institution and away from his horne I \ncommunity. \n79.  Richard's physician, Dr. Gregory Milani, has determined that Richard can be cared \nfor at home safely and appropriately. \n80.  Under the laws governing the Horne Services Program, HFS has discretion to set \nfunding for services for persons whose needs cannot be met by otherwise applicable caps, \nprovided that the program is cost neutral. \n81.  With no modifications in its regulations, and little modifications in its practices, HFS \ncould continue to fund the level of nursing care that Richard requires in order to remain at home \nat a cost that is less than would be required to serve him in an appropriate institutional setting for \nthe care he needs. \n82.  If allowed to go into effect, the proposed reduction in funding for Richard's medical \ncare will ultimately force Richard into an institutional setting (hospital), isolating him from home \nand community, or alternatively, will likely result in his imminent death if he remains in his \n21 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 22 of 29 PageID #:735\nhome. \n83.  The Plaintiff has been informed that the reduced funding will take effect on his \nbirthday, August 16, 2010. \nI.  Adam's Current Medical Plan \n84.  Currently, HFS provides a medical plan for Adam that is medically necessary and a \ncost-effective alternative to care in the institutional setting that HFS determined Adam would \notherwise require. \n85.  HFS has determined that Adam has a hospital need for care. \n86  Through the MF/TD waiver program and Medicaid, HFS pays for skilled nursing care \nwhich Adam needs in his home or community. \n87.  HFS approved and pays for approximately $18,000.00 of monthly medical services \nprovided by a registered nurse and a licensed practical nurse and unskilled nursing services.  This \nplan allows Adam to meet the costs for the salaries and benefits of the skilled and unskilled \nnursing services that he requires. \n88.  Adam's current level of services is based upon a determination made by DSCC, after \na full evaluation of William, that he needed that level of care to avoid institutionalization \n(hospitilization).  DSCC's concluded that Ada would require hospitilization at an annual cost that \nwould far exceed the amount he was awarded. \n89.  As William approached his 21st birthday, DSCC staff discussed Adam's transition \ninto the Office of Rehabilitation Services Home Services (HSP) program and \"aging out\" of the \nMF/TD waiver program. \n90.  Adam and/or his mother, was advised by the Home Services Program (HSP) operated \n22 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 23 of 29 PageID #:736\nby the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS) in July, 2010, that Adam was entitled to \nfunding for his in home care at a rate of approximately $3,300 per month.  On August 6, 2010, \nKaren Engstrom of DRS advised Adam and his mother, that Adam would be funded at an \nexceptional care rate of $8,000 per month. \n91.  The care rate for Adam's medical care set forth in the above paragraph is not \nsufficient to meet the costs of the skilled and unskilled nursing services which Adam requires. \n92.  The proposed reduction in funding I services by the Defendant is based solely on the \nfact that Adam will reach 21 years of age on August 29,2010.  The reduction in funding I \nservices is not due to a change in Adam's medical needs, which in fact have remained \nunchanged. \n93.  Adam's strong bond to his mother is threatened by isolation in an institution. \n94.  Adam's physicians have determined that Adam can be cared for at home safely and \nappropriately. \n95.  Under the laws governing the Home Services Program, HFS has discretion to set \nfunding for services for persons whose needs cannot be met by otherwise applicable caps, \nprovided that the program is cost neutral. \n96.  With no modifications in its regulations, and little modifications in its practices, HFS \ncould continue to fund the level of nursing care that Adam requires in order to remain at home or \nin the community at a cost that is less than would be required to serve him in an appropriate \ninstitutional setting for the care he needs. \n97.  If allowed to go into effect, the proposed reduction in funding for Adam's medical \ncare will ultimately force Adam into an institutional setting (hospital), isolating him from home \n23 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 41 Filed: 08/11/10 Page 24 of 29 PageID #:737\nand community, or alternatively, will likely result in his imminent death if he remains in his \nhome or community. \n98.  The Defendant has informed the Plaintiff and his mother, that the reduced funding \nwill take effect on Adam's birthday, August 29,2010. \nVI.

Farley, Jr., Ltd., and \nCahill & Associates, and pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(a)(2), files this Memorandum of Law in \nsupport of Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment, as follows: \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nThe Plaintiff Class are medically fragile disabled persons who are enrolled or will be \nenrolled or were enrolled in the State of Illinois Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent \nWaiver Program (\"MFITD\") and when they obtain the age of21 years are subjected to reduced \n1 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 2 of 21 PageID #:2683\nMedicaid funding which reduces the level of medical care which they had been receiving prior to \nattaining 21 year of age.  (Doc. 75; Plts. Stmt. 1) \nThe Defendant, the Illinois Department ofHealthcare and Family Services (\"HFS\") \ndetermined that the Plaintiffs, Hampe, Winfrey, Cale, Welter, Baron, Stracka and Stout, \n(hereinafter referred to as the \"7 Plaintiffs\")1 were all Medicaid eligible (Pits. Stmt. 30) and prior \nto the age of21 years, due to their disability, required a hospital level of care (Pits. Stmt. 34, 36-\n38)  and approved them for funding for community-based skilled nursing services. (Pits. Stmt. \n33)  The Plaintiffs received approximately 112 hours a week (16 hours per day) ofnursing \nservices plus 336 hours of nursing respite services per year from either a registered nurse (RN) or \nlicensed practical nurse (LPN).  (Pits. Stmt. 33)  The Defendant determined that the cost of the \ncommunity-based care skilled nursing services for the Plaintiffs was less than the cost of \ninstitutional (hospital) level of care for them.  (Pits. Stmt. 48)  The Defendant through their \nagent, the University of Illinois, Division of Specialized Care for Children (\"DSCC\") calculated \nthat the in-home monthly care costs for the Plaintiffs was estimated to be in the range from \n$16,621 to $22,669 in contrast to the estimate institutional (hospital) monthly care costs in the \nrange of from $42,971 to $50,884.  (Plts. Stmt. 48) \nUpon the Plaintiffs obtaining the age of 21 years, without any change in their medical \nconditions or disability, the Defendant's policy and practice is to reduce the level of Medicaid \nfunding by approximately 50% and cap or limit their funding based on a nursing home level of \n1  The 8111 Plaintiff, Jessica Lytle, is not a class member due to the fact that she is not \nenrolled in the MF/TD waiver.  However, Jessica received approval from the Defendant for in \nhome skilled nursing services prior to her 21st bi1ihday and faced reduced funding upon obtaining \nthe age of 21 years.  (Pits. Stmt. 5) \n2 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 3 of 21 PageID #:2684\ncare as opposed to a hospital level of care.  (Plts. Stmt. 54-63)  The level of care that the \nPlaintiffs need cmmot be provided in a nursing home.  (Plts. Stmt. 64-66) \nThe Seventh Circuit has previously framed the issue to be decided by this Comi with \nrespect to medically fragile persons seeking extension of services past 21 years of age.  The \nSeventh Circuit stated: \nAlthough a State is not obliged to create entirely new services or to \notherwise alter the substance of the care that it provides to Medicaid \nrecipients in order to accommodate an individual's desire to be cared \nfor at home, the integration mandate may well require the State to make \nreasonable modifications to the form of existing services in order to \nadapt them to community-integrated settings.  Radaszewski, 383 F.3d \nat 611. \n*  *  * \nIf the State would have to pay a private facility to care for Eric, for example, \nand the cost of that placement equaled or exceeded the cost of caring for \nhim at home, then it would be difficult to see how requiring the State to \npay for at-home care would amount to an unreasonable, fundamental \nalteration of its programs and services.  (emphasis added)  !d. at 614. \nAfter Radaszewski was remanded to the District Court, three Federal District Courts \nfound that the Defendant violated the ADA and RA by reducing funding for medically fragile \nplaintiffs who had been previously enrolled in the MF/TD waiver when they turned 21 years of \nage.2  See Radaszewski v. Maram, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24923, *37-41 (N.D. Ill. 2008) (J. \nDanah);  Grooms v. Maram, 563 F.Supp.2d 840 (N.D. Ill. 2008) (J. Pallmeyer); and Sidell v. \nMaram, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131324 (C.D. Ill. 2009) (J. McDade). \n2 Two other medically fragile plaintiffs have prevailed against the Defendant in Illinois. \nSee:  Jones v. Maram, 867 N.E.2d 563 (3rd Dist. 2007) (Illinois Appellate Court affirming lower \ncourt granting of preliminary injunction for plaintiff who aged out of MF lTD waiver program \nand was at-risk of institutionalization); Fisher v. Maram, 06 C 4405 (N.D. Ill.) (January 8, 2009-\nDoc. 118) (J. Guzman) (enjoining Defendant from reducing services for plaintiffwho aged out of \nMF/TD waiver program). \n3 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 4 of 21 PageID #:2685\nDue to the failure of the Defendant to change its policy and practice to reduce funding \nwhen a medically fragile person turns 21 years of age, after not prevailing in Radaszewski, \nGrooms and Sidell, this case was brought as a class action by the Plaintiffs in order to obtain \nrelief for the class.3 \nThe United States of America has filed a Statement oflnterest in this case and asserts as \nfollows: \n[T]his litigation implicates the proper interpretation and application \nof the integration mandate of title II of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct (cites omitted). \n*  *  * \nThis litigation involves the defendant's systematic failure to modify \nits current policies and practices of providing insufficient home-based \nmedical care for Medicaid-eligible adults to prevent institutionalization. \nChildren and young adults in the State of Illinois who have exceptional \nmedical needs are eligible to receive home-based Medicaid services to \navoid institutionalization under the State's Medically Fragile/Technology \nDependent (\"MF/TD\") waiver program.  Under defendant's regulatory \nscheme, however, once these individuals reach the age of 21, they are \nineligible for the MF/TD waiver.  Because the adult waiver program to \nwhich a majority of people transition does not provide community-based \nservices at the same level, these individuals may be forced to enter an \ninstitution in order to receive the medical services they need to survive. \nThese institutional placements are often more costly to the State. \n(Doc. 26 at 1-2) \n*  *  * \nDefendant's policy of providing inadequate home and community \nbased services for the proposed class soley because they reach the age \nof 21 places them at risk of institutionalization and therefore violates the \n3 The State of Illinois through the Illinois Department of Human Services acknowledges \nthe ongoing problem of the \"cliff effect\" which occurs to the Plaintiffs and the Class when they \nturn 21.  When children in the MFl TD waiver turn 21 years of age and age out of the MFl TD \nwaiver, their only current options for continued long term, Medicaid-funded care are Home \nServices Program (HSP) services or nursing facilities.  Since HSP must stay within nursing home \nrates, its topmost level of reimbursement for care for both types of care is a bit less than half of \nwhat the children are receiving through MF/TD.  This \"cliff effect\" has been an issue for some \ntime.  (Plts. Stmt. 52) \n4 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 5 of 21 PageID #:2686\nintegration mandate of title II.  (Id at 7) \nSince the filing of this lawsuit, this Court has entered Agreed Orders for approximately \n23 Plaintiffs and Class members to continue the same level of Medicaid and skilled nursing \nservices past their 21st birthday pending the outcome of this case. 4 \nThe Defendant's reduction of Medicaid benefits to the Plaintiffs threatens to force the \nPlaintiffs into an institution to obtain the care he or she needs, which violates Title II of the ADA \nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \nII.  STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nRule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment is \nproper: \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together \nwith the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the \nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter oflaw.\" F.R.C.P. 56( c), Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby Inc., 4 77 U.S. 242, 250 (1986).  In order for an issue to be a genuine issue of fact that may \ndefeat a motion for summary judgment, there must be \"sufficient evidence favoring the \nnonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.\" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250.  In \naddition, the nonmoving party may not \"rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading\" \nbut, instead, must \"set forth specific facts.\"  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. \nIII.  AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT and REHABILITATION ACT \nThere are two federal statutes with implementing regulations that, read together, \ncommand that the Defendant be prevented from forcing the Plaintiffs into segregated institutions \n4 Doc. 11, 33, 49, 58, 73, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 95, 98, 104, 106, 108, 112, 114,.118, 146, \n155, 166, 167, 169. \n5 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 6 of 21 PageID #:2687\nby arbitrarily reducing their community services. \nTitle II of the ADA prohibits public entities from discriminating against persons with \ndisabilities: \nNo qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, \nbe excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such entity.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 12132. \nA \"qualified individual with a disability\" is a person who \"with or without reasonable \nmodifications to rules, policies or practices\" meets the \"essential eligibility requirements for the \nreceipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.\"  42 \nU.S.C. Sec. 12131 (2).  Similarly, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits recipients of \nfederal funds from discriminating based on disability.  29 U.S.C. Sec. 794(a). \nThe Attorney General of the United States has promulgated regulations to implement \nboth these statutory prohibitions.  Under 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.130(d), a public entity must \nadminister services, programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \nneeds of qualified individuals with disabilities.  This regulation was based on the virtually \nidentical regulation previously promulgated by the Attorney General to implement the \nRehabilitation Act, 28 C.F.R. Sec. 41.51(d), known as the \"integration mandate,\" requiring that \nrecipients of federal funds administer their programs and activities in the \"most integrated setting \nappropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons.\"  Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d \n599, 607 (7111 Cir. 2004).  The above-described provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, \nand the integration mandate regulations promulgated under them, are construed and applied in \nthe same manner.  Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d at 607. \n6 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 7 of 21 PageID #:2688\n\"[U]njustified institutional isolation\" of a disabled individual receiving medical care from \na state institution constitutes an actionable form of discrimination under Title II of the ADA. \nOlmsteadv. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581,597-603. (1999)  Institutional placement of \nindividuals who can benefit from community-based settings perpetuate \"unwarranted \nassumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community \nlife\"; and institutional confinement \"severely diminishes the everyday life activities .of \nindividuals, including family relations, social contacts ... and cultural emichment.\" !d. at 600-\n601.  Thus a state may violate Title II if it refuses to provide an existing benefit to a disabled \nindividual that would enable that person to live in a more community-integrated setting.  See \nRadaszewski, 383 F.3d at 609; Fisher v.  Oklahoma Health Care Auth., 336 F.3d 1175, 1182-84 \n(lOth Cir. 2003); Townsendv. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511, 516-520 (9th Cir. 2003). \nA state is obligated to provide community-based treatment for disabled persons if: (1) the \nstate's treatment professionals find that community-based treatment is appropriate; (2) the \naffected individuals do not oppose community-based treatment; and (3) placement in the \ncommunity can reasonably be accommodated, taking into account the state's resources and the \nneeds of others with similar disabilities.  See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607; Radaszewski, 383 F.3d \nat 608. \nUnder the fundamental-alteration defense, the public entity may demonstrate that it \nshould not be required to accommodate the disabled individual by providing the services in the \ncommunity instead of an institution would affect a fundamental alternation of its programs and \nservices.  See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603-606; Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 611, 614. \n7 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 8 of 21 PageID #:2689\nA.  Plaintiffs Are Eligible For Illinois' Medicaid Program And Are \n\"Qualified lndividual[s] With A Disability\" \nAll the Plaintiffs are recipients of Medical Assistance, commonly known as Medicaid. \n(Plts. Stmt. 30)  The Plaintiffs are \"qualified individual[s] with a disability\" and \"with or without \nreasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices ... meets the essential eligibility \nrequirements of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public \nentity.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 12131(2).  Prior to their 21st birthday, the Plaintiffs and Class met the \neligibility requirements of services provided by the Defendant, a \"public entity\" for community-\nbased services.  (Plts. Stmt. 5, 30-33) \nIn Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. 2004), the Seventh Circuit found that a \nplaintiff who had been served in the MF/TD waiver program was a qualified individual with a \ndisability.  The Seventh Circuit stated: \nEric thus appears to meet these \"essential\" requirements for at-home \ncare.  See Townsend, 328 F.3d at 516 (plaintiff was a \"qualified individual \nwith a disability \"for purposes of Title II because he was eligible to \nreceive services through State's Medicaid programs, he prefeiTed to \nreceive such services in a community-based setting, and community-based \nservices were appropriate for his needs).  Radaszewski, at 613. \n*  *  * \nConsequently, we discern no impediment concerning Eric's status as a \n\"qualified individual with a disability\" that would preclude the relief his \nmother seeks under Title II.\"  Jd at 614. \nIn addition, every District Court in the State of Illinois has found that a person previously \nenrolled in the MF/TD program has been found to be an \"individual with a disability\" without \nany difficulty. See Grooms, at 850-851 (\"There is no dispute that Grooms meets all these criteria . \n. . .A  ccordingly, Grooms is a qualified individual with a disability); See Radaszewski, 2008 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS at *38-39 (\"Eric is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA and the \n8 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 9 of 21 PageID #:2690\nRA.  Eric and his parents do not oppose community-based treatment and specifically seek to \nallow Eric to remain at home and seek the same level of care he has been receiving for the last \nseveral years.\"); See Sidell v. Maram, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131324 at *26 (\"Gretchen is a \nqualified individual under the ADA and the RA, Gretchen is a qualified Medicaid recipient, \nDefendant is a public entity under the ADA and RA.  Gretchen and Plaintiff do not oppose \ncommunity treatment.\") \nB.  Community-Based Treatment Is Appropriate For The Plaintiffs And \nThey Do Not Oppose Community Placement. \nPrior to the Plaintiffs' 21st birthday, the Defendant found that community-based treatment \nis appropriate as the Defendant approved funding for \"In-home care plan ... for nursing care.\" \n(Plts. Stmt. 25, 27, 33)  The Plaintiffs do not oppose community placement.  (Plts. Stmt. 25-29) \nC.  Placement In The Community Can Be Reasonably Accommodated \nAs The Cost of Care In A Community Setting Is Less Than The \nCost Of Care In An Institutional (Hospital) Setting. \nPrior to the Plaintiffs 21st birthday, the  Defendant determined that the cost of the \ncommunity-based care skilled nursing services and other services for the Plaintiffs were less than \nthe cost of institutional (hospital) level of care for them.  (Plts. Stmt 48)  The Plaintiffs medical \nneeds did not change when they obtained the age of21.  (Pits. Stmt. 64) \n(i) The Defendant Found That The Plaintiffs Required A Hospital \nLevel of Care Prior To Age 21. \nPrior to the Plaintiffs turning 21, the Defendant found that the Plaintiffs required a \nhospital level of care.  (Pits. Stmt. 34)  The Defendant's physician determined that the Plaintiffs \nneed a hospital level of care.  (Plts. Stmt. 35-37)  The Defendant's physicians wrote that for the \nPlaintiffs, the \"alternative care is long-term hospitalization.\"  (Pits. Stmt. 38)  Moreover, prior to \n9 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 10 of 21 PageID #:2691\nage 21, the Plaintiffs personal physicians stated that the Plaintiffs alternative to medical home \ncare would be admission to a hospital.  (Plts. Stmt. 39-46) \n(ii) Plaintiffs Medical Condition and Needs Did Not Change Upon \nTurning 21 Years of Age- Plaintiffs Still Require A Hospital \nLevel of Care. \nUpon attaining the age of 21 years, the Plaintiffs medical conditions and needs did not \nchange and they still require a hospital level of care.5  (Plts. Stmt. 64)  The level of care that the \nPlaintiffs need cannot be provided in a nursing home.  (Plts. Stmt. 65) \n(iii)  Community-Based Care For The Plaintiffs Is Less Than \nInstitutional (Hospital) Cost. \nProviding in-home care for the Plaintiffs is less than the institutional (hospital) costs. \n(Plts. Stmt. 48)  Prior to age 21, the Defendant approved community-based services for the \nPlaintiffs which is less than them receiving institutional costs.  (Plts. Stmt. 33, 48)  Providing \nskilled nursing care in their home and community is cheaper than the institutional equivalent. \n(Plts. Stmt. 33, 48-53) \nIV.  DEFENDANT'S POLICY AND PRACTICE  OF REDUCING MEDICAID \nBENEFITS TO THE PLAINTIFFS AND CLASS  WHEN THEY TURN 21 \nWhen children in the MF lTD waiver turn 21 years of age and age out of the MFl TD \nwaiver, their only current options for continued long term, Medicaid-funded c_are are Home \nServices Program (HSP) services, nursing facilities or hospitals.  Since HSP must stay within \nnursing home rates, its topmost level of reimbursement for care for both types of care is a bit less \nthan half of what the children are receiving through MFITD.  This \"cliff effect\" has been an issue \n5 (See Sidell v. Maram, 2009 U.S. Dist. Lexisl31324 at *28) (\"While there may not be a \nhospital that would be available for Gretchen's care, the unavailability of an institution is \nirrelevant to the question of what level of care Gretchen requires.\") \n10 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 11 of 21 PageID #:2692\nfor some time.6  (Plts. Stmt 54) \nChildren in the MF/TD waiver typically transition into the Persons With Disabilities \n(PWD) waiver at 21 years of age. 7  (Plts. Stmt. 10 5)  The PWD Waiver is part of a larger \nprogram called the Home Services Program (HSP).8  (Plts. Stmt 106)  The PWD waiver limits \nmedicaid benefits based on a nursing home level of care as opposed to a hospital level of care. \n(Plts. Stmt. 10 4)  For example, in fiscal year 2010, the Service Cost Maximum (\"SCM\") for \nmonthly benefits could not exceed the sum of$3,533.  (Plt. Stmt. 112)  For an individual who \nhas complex medical needs and who cannot be served within the allowable SCM, that person \nmay receive an Exceptional Care Rate (\"ECR\").  (Plt. Stmt. 113)  The ECR rate is based on a \nnursing home rate (Id) despite the level of care needed by a particular individual. \nThe Exceptional Care Rate offered to the Plaintiffs were in the range of $5,13 3 to \n$11,484.  The ECR is approximately fifty percent (50%) ofthe cost ofthe services which the \nPlaintiffs and Class received prior to them obtaining 21 years of age.  (Plts. Stmt. 48, 54,57-63, \n115)  Offering the Plaintiffs one-half the funding for services based only on the fact that they \nhave obtained the age of21 is a violation ofboth Title II ofthe ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. \n6  Prior to age 21, the combination of EPSDT, waiver services, and other State plan \nservices allow children with disabilities to remain in their own homes and communities and \nreceive the support they needs.  (Plts. Stmt. 83) \n7 A few young adults transition from the MFTD children's waiver into the adults with \ndevelopmental disabilities waiver (DD), however, individuals that make that transfer do not \nrequire 24-hour nursing care.  (Pits. Stmt. 10 5) \n8 The HSP offers services which include: personal assistants, homemaker, skilled \nprofessional nursing, certified nursing assistants, therapies, adult day care, emergency home \nresponse, respite, home-delivered meals, environmental modifications, and special medical \nequipment and supplies. \n11 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 12 of 21 PageID #:2693\nV.  PLAINTIFFS AND CLASS CAN BE REASONABLY ACCOMMODATED \nNO FUNDAMENTAL ALTERATION \nGranting relief to the Plaintiffs and Class would not fundamentally alter the State's \nprogram or services as the costs of community-based services is less than the institutional \n(hospital) level of care.  (Plts. Stmt. 48)  The Seventh Circuit in Radaszewski at 611, determined \nthat \"the integration mandate may well require the State to make reasonable modifications to the \nform of existing services in order to adapt them to community-integrated settings.\" \nThe State has the ability to make reasonable modifications to the form of existing services \nin order to provide relief to the Plaintiffs while maximizing medicaid funding from the federal \ngovermnent.  The Defendant could make a number of modifications as follows: \nA.  Defendant Could Amend the MF/TD Waiver To Provide \nServices Past The Age Of 21 Years. \nThe Defendant could amend the MF/TD Waiver to provide services past the age of21 \nyears.  Such an amendment would not be a fundamental alteration.  Currently, the Defendant has \nlimited the MF/TD Waiver to medically fragile and technology dependent individuals under the \nage of21 years.  (Tab \"29\" HFS-000012)  However, States can submit requests for approval to \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") to alter the terms of a particular waiver \napplication at any time.  See 42 C.F.R Sec. 441.355.  Such requests are regularly granted by \nCMS.  See Knowles v. Horn, 2010 WL 517591 (N.D. Tex., Feb. 10, 2010) (citing to Grooms v. \nMaram, 563 F.Supp.2d 840, 857 (N.D. Ill. 2008) (\"[T]he federal government has not denied a \nsingle waiver application in the last ten years.  Defendant here presents no basis to believe that \nthe federal govermnent would deny the State's application for an amendment in this case and the \n12 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 13 of 21 PageID #:2694\ncourt will concoct one.\")9 \nThe Defendant initiated review on 9 states that serve MF/TD children through HCBS \nwaivers and 3 of the 9 states did not have transition issues from children to adult services as \nIowa, Minnesota and Vermont serve adults under their MF/TD waivers.  (Plts. Stmt 135) \nLikewise, Illinois could avoid transition issues and the \"cliff effect\" by amending the MF lTD \nwaiver to serve the Plaintiffs and Class past the age of 21 years. \nB.  Defendant Could Amend PWD Waiver To Provide A \nHospital Level Of Care. \nThe Defendant could amend the Persons With Disabilities waiver to provide both a \nnursing home level of care and a hospital level of care.  In Grooms, at 856-857,  the District \nCourt stated: \nThe waiver format requires the applying state to specify whether it seeks \na waiver \"in order to provide home and community-based services to \nindividuals who, but for the provision of such services, would require\" care \nin-among other alternatives-a nursing facility or a hospital. (Pl.'s 56.1 P 1; \nPWD Waiver Renewal at 3025.)  It was the State of Illinois's choice to seek a \nwaiver only for individuals who would require nursing-facility level care; the \noption to provide a waiver for individuals who would require hospital-level \ncare demonstrates that the federal government would approve a waiver for \nindividuals requiring a hospital level of care.  Indeed, there is no indication \nthat a need for care that exceeds what is available in a nursing facility \n9  On May 20, 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sent a letter to \nState Medicaid Directors reaffirming the federal commitment to the enforcement of the ADA \nwith respect to Medicaid programs.  The letter states that \"[t]he HHS Office for Civil Rights is \nalso collaborating with the Department of Justice to advance civil rights enforcement of the ADA \nand the U.S. Supreme Court's Olmstead decisions.\"  (Plts. Stmt 132 at page 1)  The letter fmiher \nstates that \"CMS recognizes the importance role that Medicaid plays in State's efforts to ensure \ncompliance with the ADA and Olmstead.  (Plts. Stmt.132 at p.l-2)  To that end, CMS is offering \nto provide to States, such as Illinois, \"technical assistance ... regarding the design and operations \nof their Medicaid programs\" \"to help them meet their obligations under the ADA.\"  (Plts. Stmts \n132 at p. 2-3) \n13 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 14 of 21 PageID #:2695\ndisqualifies an individual for the PWD waiver.  See Opinion and Order, \nSidell v. Maram, No. 05-1001, at 19-20.  The parties agree that the State had \ndiscretion when designing the PWD waiver and is, even now, permitted to alter \nthe waiver's terms by submitting an amendment to the federal government for \napproval. (Def.'s Am. Resp. To Pl.'s 56.1 P 3.)  Through the amendment \nprocess, the State may add services to the waiver, delete services from the \nwaiver, and/or change the selection of comparable institution for determining \ncost-neutrality. (!d. P 5.)  This would not be the first time Illinois amended its \nwaiver; the State has submitted several waivers to the federal government in \nrecent years. (!d. P 4.) (footnote omitted) \nAs Judge Dan-ah explained in his decision on remand in the Radaszewski \ncase, requiring the State to submit an amendment need not fundamentally \nalter the HSP or Medicaid waiver program. Radaszewski, 2008 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 24923, 2008 WL 2097382.  In his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n52 findings, Judge Darrah observed: \"Illinois could act in cooperation with \nthe federal government to achieve community-based integration which may \notherwise be impeded by existing rules or requirements. Thus, there is no \nneed to adapt existing institutional-based services to a community-based \nsetting that would impose unreasonable burdens or fundamentally alter the \nnature of Illinois' services and programs.\" 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24923, \n[WL] at * 15. He noted, further, that the federal government has not denied a \nsingle waiver application in the last ten years. 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24923, \n[WL] at * 10 .  Defendant here presents no basis to believe the federal \ngovernment would deny the State's application for an amendment in this \ncase and the court will not concoct one.  In fact, there are reasons to believe \nthat the federal government would agree to amend the PWD waiver. \nDefendant does not dispute that the federal government encourages states to \nuse waivers to attempt to achieve community integration. (Pl.'s 56.1 P 9.) \nNor has Defendant established that such an amendment would impose \nsignificant costs on the State or the federal government. Accordingly, the \nrequirement that HFS amend its waiver does not constitute a fundamental \nalteration in the PWD program. \nAccordingly, Defendant can reasonably accommodate the Plaintiffs and Class by \namending the Persons with Disabilities waiver to provide a hospital level of care. \nC.  Defendant Has Flexibility To Adjust Cap In The Home Services \nProgram \nThe Defendant has the flexibility to adjust the cap in the Home Services Program. \n14 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 15 of 21 PageID #:2696\nHSP is an umbrella program which includes three waiver programs: the Persons with Disabilities \nWaiver (PWD), the HIV/AIDS waiver, and the Brain Injury Waiver.  Nevertheless, the State has \none set of regulations for the HSP.  See, e.g., 89 Ill. Admin. Code Sec. 682.100.  Nothing in the \nIllinois regulations governing the HSP actually limits the HSP to a nursing facility/home level. \n(See Sidell v. Maram, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97649 at *4: \"The limitation of the waiver \ndocument is not coextensive with the 'institutional care' restriction on which eligibility for the \nHSP is determined.  89 Ill.Admin. Cod 682.1 00\" and Sidell v. Maram, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n97649 at *24:  \"there is nothing in the State's general eligibility criteria that articulates either a \nmaximum level of disability or a bar against those who require a greater level of institutional care \nthan what can be provided in a nursing home\").  Accordingly, without a change to its rules, the \nstate could accommodate the hospital-level-of-care relief plaintiff seeks. 10 \nD.  Reasonable Accommodations \nThe cost to allow the Plaintiffs and Class to continue receiving the same services in the \ncommunity after age 21 as they did prior to age 21 is less than the cost of caring for them in the \nproper institutional setting. 11  As such, continuing the funding for these services after age 21 is a \nreasonable accommodation and would not impose an unreasonable burden on the Defendant or \nfundamentally alter its programs and services. \nIn Radaszewski v. Maram, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24923, after the case was remanded \nfrom the U.S. Comi of Appeals, the District Court found that the State of Illinois violated the \n10  In Radaszewski, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24923, *26, the District Court stated that \nIllinois law permits exceptional care rates up to a hospital rate. \n11  Plts. Stmt. 34-47,48,51-53 \n15 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 16 of 21 PageID #:2697\nADA and Rehabilitation Act when Eric Radaszewsli exited the MF/TD program and the State of \nIllinois reduced the level of funding which would not adequately fund skilled nursing care for \nEric to remain in his home.  The Court stated: \nEric has severe, long-term disabilities.  Eric is eligible to receive services \nthrough the Illinois Medicaid Program.  Eric is at risk of being placed in \nan institutional setting, and Eric is qualified to receive services through \nHSP.  Community-based treatment is an existing benefit under the Illinois \nMedicaid Program and is appropriate for Eric. Radaszewski, 2008 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 24923, *39. \n*  *  * \nThe services that Eric requires and presently receives at home are, in substance, \nthe services that would be required in a hospital.  The unrebutted evidence \nclearly shows that the cost of caring for Eric in the proper institutional \nsetting - - a hospital -- would be substantially greater than the cost of allowing \nEric to remain in the community and receive the same proper treatment and \nhealth care. Allowing Eric to remain in the community can be readily \naccommodated, taking into Illinois resources and the needs of others with \nsimilar disabilities.  Illinois can approve an HSP plan for Eric that exceeds the \nnursing home rate.  If otherwise necessary, Illinois could also modify or alter \nthe waiver from the federal government, which encourages the states to use \nhome and community-based waivers to meet the community integration \ncontemplated by Olmstead.  Illinois could act in cooperation with the federal \ngovernment to achieve community-based integration which may otherwise be \nimpeded by existing  rules or requirements.  Thus, there is no need to adapt \nexisting institutional-based services to a community-based setting that would \nimpose unreasonable burdens or fundamentally alter the nature of Illinois' \nservices and programs. \nIllinois has not demonstrated that providing the requested accommodation \nto Eric would impose an unreasonable burden on the state or fundamentally \nalter the nature of its programs and services.  The evidence offered by the \nstate, ... has not shown that Eric's healthcare needs cannot be reasonably \naccommodated by community placement considering the state's resources \nand the needs of others similarly situated.  !d. at *39-41. \nIn Grooms v. Maram, 563 F.Supp.2d 840, 846, (N.D. Ill. 2008), the plaintiff, David \nGrooms was dependent upon a ventilator and relied on others for virtually all his care and he was \nfunded under the MF/TD program and he received approximately $17,000 per month for home \n16 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 17 of 21 PageID #:2698\nbase skill nursing funding. When he turned 21, the State would only approve an exceptional care \nrate of $8,517 per month.  (Id at 84 7)  For the same reasoning as in all the other cases litigated \nagainst the State of Illinois for persons exiting the MF/TD program, the Court found that \"HFS \ncould reasonably accommodate Grooms's request for home care\"  Id. at 856.  The Court entered \na Permanent Injunction Order against the State of Illinois and in favor of David Groom, so that \nthe State is required to restore the level of approved skill nursing services which he had prior to \nhis 2P1 birthday.  (See Grooms v. Maram, No. 06-2211 (N.D. IL), at Doc. 196- Permanent \nInjunction Order of June 13, 2008)) \nIn Sidall v. Maram, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131324 (C.D. Ill. 2009) the plaintiff, \nGretchen Sidell was on a ventilator 24 hours a day.  When Gretchen aged out of the MF/TD \nprogram, the State proposed to reduce her funding of$27,232 per month to $9,289 per month. \n(Id. at * 15-16)  The Court found that Gretchen required 24 hours per day skilled nursing care. \n(Id. at *21)  The Court found that the cost of housing Gretchen in a hospital exceeds the cost of \ncaring for her at home with skilled nurses. (Id. at* 18)  The Court held that the State's reduction \nof funding for skilled nursing for Gretchen violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and the \nRehabilitation Act. (Id. at. *29) \nIn Jones v. Maram, 373 Ill.App.3d 184, 867 N.E.2d 563 (3'd Dist. 2007), the Illinois \nAppellate Court upheld the Circuit Court's entry of a preliminary injunction against the State of \nIllinois to prevent the State from reducing the funding for the plaintiff who had aged out of the \nMF/TD program.  The plaintiff, Michael Jones \"is completely ventilator dependent\" and \n\"requires skilled nursing services in order to survive.\"  !d., at 185-186.  Under the MFTDC \nprogram, Michael received home nursing services at a cost of $17,000 per month and if he was to \n17 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 18 of 21 PageID #:2699\nbe hospitalized, the cost of the care would be approximately $49,400 per month.  The Court \nstated: \n... Michael's condition has not changed, only his age has changed. \nIt seems likely the Department can accommodate the needs of Michael \nand others like him with reasonable modification to existing programs. \nThe cost of caring for Michael at home would not exceed the cost of \nthe comparable facility capable of meeting his needs, the intensive \ncare unit of a hospital.  !d., at 197. \nIn summary, the Defendant can reasonably accommodate the Plaintiffs' and Class' need \nfor continued skilled nursing care past their 21st birthday.  As noted above, numerous Federal \nCourts have addressed this precise issue and have concluded that Illinois can reasonably \naccommodate the Plaintiffs' continued need for skilled nursing care past their 21st birthday. \n18 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 176 Filed: 08/23/12 Page 19 of 21 PageID #:2700\nV.  CONCLUSION \nConsistent with the Supreme Comi's ruling in Olmstead and the Seventh Circuit's ruling \nin Radaszewski and the District Court rulings in  Radaszewski, Grooms and Sidell, the Plaintiffs \nand Class are entitled to summary judgment against the Defendant on the their Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA) and Rehabilitation Act (RA) claims and an award of reasonable attorneys \nfees and costs. \nFurthermore, after the finding of liability in favor of the Plaintiffs I Class and against the \nDefendant, this Court should direct the pmiies to meet and confer to attempt to develop a joint \nremedial plan consistent with this Comi's ruling.12 \nRespectfully submitted, \nIs/ Robert H  Farley, Jr. \nOne of the Attorneys for \nthe Plaintiffs & Class \n12 See: Memisolvski v.

STATEMENT OF FACTS. \n  Defendant adopts and incorporates by reference all the facts set forth in Defendant’s \nLocal Rule 56.1(b)(3)(C) Statement of Additional Material Facts and Defendant’s Local Rule \n56.1(a)(3) Statement of Material Facts as the Statement of Facts. \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW. \n  Summary judgment may be an appropriate means by which to resolve issues of law.  \nFlath v. Garrison Public School Dist, 82 F.3d 244, 246 (8th Cir. 1996) (where unresolved issues \nare primarily legal rather than factual, summary judgment is particularly appropriate).  As this \ncase is presently postured, it presents issues of law.  Under the Third Amended Complaint filed \nOctober  28,  2010,  the  named  Plaintiffs  and  class  (hereafter  collectively  referred  to  as \n“Plaintiffs”) claimed that Defendant violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and \nits implementing regulation by the “planned reduced funding or actual reduced funding of the \nhome nursing and other services” that they allegedly need in order to avoid institutionalization \nupon their reaching the age of twenty-one.  Hampe v. Hamos, 10 C 3121, U.S. Civil Docket at \n54, Paragraphs 210-18 (hereafter “Hampe Civil Docket at ___”).  The Plaintiffs claimed that \nDefendant  violated  the  Rehabilitation  Act  and its  implementing  regulation  by  the  “planned \nreduced funding or actual reduced funding of the home nursing” that they allegedly need in order \nto avoid institutionalization upon their reaching the age of twenty-one.  Hampe Civil Docket at \n54, Paragraphs 219-227.  The Third Amended Complaint prayed for a declaratory judgment that \nDefendant’s reduction in funding when aging out of the MF/TD Waiver violates the ADA, \nRehabilitation Act and regulations.  Hampe Civil Docket at 54, page 54.  Plaintiffs prayed for a \npermanent injunction “to restore the funding to maintain the existing medical services for the \nPlaintiffs and the putative class prior to aging out of the … [MF/TD] program …”  Hampe Civil \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 3 of 18 PageID #:2892\nDocket at 54, page 55.  The Plaintiffs claim that they are entitled to “funding for services” and \nservices that are only available to children under the age of twenty-one.  At bottom, all Plaintiffs \nwant in-home private duty nursing services to continue, at a minimum, at the level they had prior \nto  reaching  age  twenty-one.    Regardless  of  how  Plaintiffs  cast  their  claims,  a  declaratory \njudgment and permanent injunction to require Defendant to 1) modify the Medicaid program by \nremoving the EPSDT age limit for Plaintiffs, or 2) modify the Home Services Program to allow \nPlaintiffs  to  receive  the  services  at  the  level  they  received  as  children  is  not  a  reasonable \nmodification under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Plaintiffs have not established that they are \nentitled to judgment in their favor for all the reasons set forth below. \nIII.  ARGUMENT. \nDEFENDANT DOES NOT VIOLATE THE ADA, THE REHABILITATION ACT OR \nTHE REGULATIONS BY ENDING PRIVATE DUTY NURSING SERVICES TO \nTHE PLAINTIFFS AND THE CLASS UPON ATTAINING THE TWENTY-FIRST \nBIRTHDAY. \n \n  A.  The Plaintiffs Are Not Qualified Individuals With A Disability. \n \n  The relevant portion of the ADA states: \n    [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, \n    be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \n    programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination  \n    by any such entity. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 12132 (Westlaw 2012).  \n  The ADA defines a “qualified individual with a disability” as one who “with or without \nreasonable  modifications  to  rules,  policies,  or  practices  …  meets  the  essential  eligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by \na public entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2) (Westlaw 2012).  In order to determine whether Plaintiffs \nare a “qualified individual with a disability,” for ADA purposes, the court must first determine \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 4 of 18 PageID #:2893\nwhether the age limit in EPSDT is an essential eligibility requirement of the Medicaid program.  \nSee Aughe v. Shalala, 885 F. Supp. 1428, 1432-33 (W.D. Wash. 1995).  If the age requirement is \nessential, only then should the court determine whether Plaintiffs meet the requirement with or \nwithout modification.  Id.     \n  An eligibility requirement may be deemed “essential” only if the program’s purposes \ncould not be achieved without the requirement.  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 \n(1985) (citing Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 413-14 (1979)).  The \nanalysis of whether an individual is “otherwise qualified” and whether an individual has been \ndiscriminated against on the basis of disability, is really two sides of the same coin.  Choate, 469 \nU.S. at 299, n.19.  The ultimate question will always be whether the relief the plaintiff is seeking \nis a reasonable modification to the program.  Id.   Requiring modification is unreasonable when it \nwould necessitate modification of the essential nature of the program, Choate, 469 U.S. at 302-\n06; Davis, 442 U.S. at 410, 413 (1979), or entail unreasonable expense.  Choate, Id. at 306-09;  \naccord: Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603-07 (1999) (under the ADA the State may resist \nmodifications that entail fundamental alterations of the State’s services and programs).  Under \nthese authorities, extending the benefit of EPSDT services to any Medicaid-eligible individual \nwho has passed the twenty-first birthday is not a reasonable modification. \n The Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. (Westlaw 2012), was established to allow \nstates to provide medical assistance to eligible individuals and families with insufficient income \nor resources to pay for certain medical services.  Id.; Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 301 (1980).  \nA state’s participation in the Medicaid program is voluntary, but once a state elects to participate, \nit must abide by all federal requirements and standards as set forth in the Medicaid Act.  Wilder \nv. Virginia Hospital Ass’n, 496 U.S. 498, 502 (1990).  Illinois participates in Medicaid.   \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 5 of 18 PageID #:2894\n One such requirement of the Medicaid Act is EPSDT.  Congress directed the single state \nMedicaid agency to ensure that certain health services are available to children.  The EPSDT \nprovisions  of  the  Medicaid  program  obligate  the  Medicaid  agency  to  make  certain  routine \nhealthcare  like  screening  services  and  immunizations  available  to  children.    42  U.S.C.  §§ \n1396a(a)(43); 1396d(r).  Title XIX requires a State participating in the Medicaid program, as a \ncondition of its participation, to include EPSDT as part of its Title XIX State Medicaid Plan.  42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(43); 1396a(a)(10) (Westlaw 2012); Collins v. Hamilton, 349 F.3d 371, 374 \n(7th Cir. 2003).  EPSDT is not a program; it is a service.  Collins, Id.   \nThe  Act  of  Congress  defines  “screening  services”  at  42  U.S.C.  §  1396d(r)(1)-(4).  \nScreening services include a comprehensive health and developmental history that includes an \nassessment  of  physical  and  mental  health  development,  Section  1396d(r)(1)(B)(i),  a \ncomprehensive unclothed physical exam, Section 1396d(r)(1)(B)(ii), immunizations, laboratory \ntests,  health  education,  vision  services,  dental  services  and  hearing  services.    Section \n1396d(r)(1)(B); (2); (3); (4).  Screening services are to be made available at intervals which meet \nreasonable professional practices, or as medically necessary.  Section 1396d(r)(1)(A); (2)(A); \n(3)(A); (4)(A). \n The Act of Congress imposes no  general  requirement on the single state Medicaid \nagency  to  provide  screening  services  to  all  Medicaid-eligible  children.    42  U.S.C.  §§ \n1396a(a)(43); d(r) (Westlaw 2012).   At Section 1396a(a)(43)(A) (Westlaw 2012), the Act of \nCongress requires that the State Medicaid plan provide for “informing all persons in the State \nwho  are  under  the  age  of  21  …  of  the  availability  of  …  [EPSDT]  services  …”    Section \n1396a(a)(43) also states, in pertinent part, that with respect to EPSDT the single state Medicaid \nagency shall:  \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 6 of 18 PageID #:2895\n     (B) provid[e] or arrang[e] for the provision of such screening \n     services in all cases where they are requested, \n     (C) arrang[e] for (directly or through referral to appropriate \n     agencies, organizations, or individuals) corrective treatment \n     the need for which is disclosed by such child health screening  \n     services ... \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396a(a)(43)(B);  (C)  (Westlaw  2012)  (emphasis  added).    42  U.S.C.  § \n1396a(a)(43)(D), obligates the single state Medicaid agency to report to the federal Secretary of \nHHS certain information respecting EPSDT services provided during each fiscal year, including: \nthe number of children receiving child health screening services, the number of children referred \nfor corrective treatment and the State’s results in meeting the participation goals set for it by the \nSecretary of HHS.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(43)(D)(i), (ii), (iv) (Westlaw 2012). \nThe Act of Congress also defines the term EPSDT to include: \n     (5) Such other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, \n     and other measures described in subsection (a) of this section to \n     correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and \n     conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not such \n     services are covered under the State [Medicaid] plan. \n42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5) (Westlaw 2012).  Under EPSDT, a Medicaid-eligible child shall receive \nservices and treatment allowable in 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a) to correct or ease the conditions \ndiscovered through the periodic screenings, whether the State includes the corrective services in \nits State Medicaid plan or not.  (Emphasis supplied).  The Act of Congress directs the federal \nSecretary of HHS to set annual participation “goals” for each state in order to measure how many \nMedicaid-eligible children are participating in EPSDT services.  Section 1396d(r)(5). \n First, the language Congress used could not be plainer.  EPSDT is a separate provision to \nhave  certain  Medicaid  services  available  to  children  under  the  age  of  21.    42  U.S.C.  §§ \n1396d(a)(4);  1396a(a)(10)  (Westlaw  2012).    Congress  did  not  create  EPSDT  to  clothe  the \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 7 of 18 PageID #:2896\nMedicaid agency with the authority to operate home and community-based services programs.  \n42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(43); d(r) (Westlaw 2012).  Rather, that authority lies in 42 U.S.C. § \n1396n(c) (Westlaw 2012).  Second, under the plain language of Title XIX, Congress clearly \nintended to confer the benefit of certain services, such as designated out-of-State plan corrective \nand ameliorative services, on children only.  Sections 1396a(a)(43); d(r) (Westlaw 2012).  There \nis no reason for EPSDT or 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a) to exist if the State is obligated to make the \nentire  basket  of  every  conceivable  medical  service  accessible  to  each  Medicaid-eligible \nindividual.    Third,  there  is  no  general  Medicaid  counterpart  to  EPSDT’s  requirement  that \nmedical services, including out-of-State plan services, be provided whenever need for such \nservices has been demonstrated.  In fact, other Medicaid benefits are defined by age.  See e.g., 42 \nU.S.C.  §  1396d(a)(B)  (Westlaw  2012)  (IMD  exclusion;  certain  services  not  available  to \nMedicaid recipients under the age of 65 who reside in IMDs).  Fourth, the EPSDT statutes target \nthe  single  state  Medicaid  agency’s  obligation  to  provide  EPSDT  services  and  treatment  to \nphysical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services.  42 U.S.C. § \n1396d(r)(5) (emphasis added); 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(43)(C).  In other words, EPSDT does not \nimpose a wholesale, generic obligation on Defendant to uncover conditions in children that may \nrequire correction or amelioration.  Rather, EPSDT obligates Defendant to act after the results of \na healthcare professional’s screening demonstrate a “need” for corrective treatment.  42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(a)(43)(C) (Westlaw 2012).  Fifth, Title XIX directs the federal Secretary of HHS to set \nannual participation goals in EPSDT services for Medicaid-eligible children in the State, i.e., a \nyardstick,  by  which  the  federal  government  can  measure  the  amount  of  EPSDT  services \nprovided.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(43); d(r)(5) (Westlaw 2012).  The EPSDT statutes do not \nauthorize the Secretary of HHS to order the single State Medicaid agency to provide services, or \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 8 of 18 PageID #:2897\nto create a program for the provision of services.  Lastly, Congress’ intent in enacting in EPSDT \nwas both to benefit Medicaid-eligible children and to preserve Medicaid funds.  EPSDT is for \nchildren and any waiver of the age limit contained in the Medicaid Act is at odds with Congress’ \nintent in devising a set of services available to children only. \nHaving concluded that the age limit is an essential eligibility requirement, the court must \nnext determine, as part of the ADA analysis, whether the Plaintiffs meet the age requirement \nwith or without modification.  Aughe v. Shalala, 885 F. Supp. 1428, 1432 (W.D. Wash. 1995).  \nObviously, once each Plaintiff reaches his or her twenty-first birthday, they cannot meet the \nEPSDT  age  limit  without  modification.    Neither  waiving  the  age  limit  for  Plaintiffs,  nor \nrequiring Defendant to cover private duty nursing for them beyond the twenty-first birthday, nor \nrequiring Defendant to provide “funding” at a level they enjoyed as children, is a reasonable \nmodification.  First, the State of Illinois cannot waive the requirements of an Act of Congress.  \nAughe, 885 F. Supp. at 1431.  Second, a modification that rewrites an Act of Congress is not \nreasonable as a matter of law.  Id. at 1432.  Third, a modification is not reasonable when it \ncompels the State to cover an optional Medicaid service, i.e., private duty nursing, that Congress \npermitted the State to cover or not.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A); 1396d(a)(8) (Westlaw 2012).  \nSee Defendant’s Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(C) SMF at Nos. 139, 142-43, 154-55; Defendant’s Local \nRule 56.1(a)(3) SMF at Nos. 13, 16-17, 27-28 (Illinois’ Title XIX State Medicaid Plan and \nMF/TD Medicaid Waiver do not include private duty nursing as a covered Medicaid service). \nFourth, modifications, as previously stated, are not reasonable if they impose undue financial and \nadministrative burdens or if they require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program.  \nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985); Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. \n397 (1979); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).  The relief Plaintiffs seek, if granted, would \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 9 of 18 PageID #:2898\nfundamentally alter the structure of Title XIX.  Title XIX is a program of cooperative federalism; \na State cannot be compelled to fund services that Congress itself is unwilling to fund.  Harris v. \nMcRae,  448  U.S.  297,  308-310  (1980).    General  civil  rights  statutes,  like  the  ADA  and \nRehabilitation Act, do not evidence Congress’ intent to impose massive funding obligations on \nStates that Congress itself has chosen not to fund.  Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 22-27 (1981) (citing Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 309 (1980)); \nDuquette by Duquette v. Dupuis, 582 F. Supp. 1365, 1369-1372 (D.N.H. 1984). \nMoreover, under Choate, 469 U.S. at 301-09 (1985), the State need not alter the benefits \noffered under its Medicaid program simply to meet the reality that disabled persons have greater \nmedical needs because, to conclude otherwise, would be to find that the Rehabilitation Act \nrequires that States view certain medical conditions as more important than others and more \nworthy of cure through government subsidization.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 302-04.  Choate found \nthat  Tennessee’s  limitation  on  hospital  days  covered  by  Medicaid  does  not  offend  the \nRehabilitation Act because the denial of benefits, even when left unmodified, was not linked in \nany way to those plaintiffs’ particular disabilities.  Choate, Id. at 302-03, 309; accord: Frances J. \nby Murphy v. Bradley, 1992 WL 390875 *7 (N.D. Ill. December 15, 1992) vacated on other \ngrounds Frances J. v. Wright, 19 F.3d 337 (7th Cir. 1994) (elderly disabled who claimed that \nthey did not receive enough in benefits under certain home and community-based Medicaid \nwaiver program because of the program caps linked to the assessment tool the State used to grant \nthose benefits, failed to state a claim under Rehabilitation Act; plaintiffs were not deprived of \nmeaningful access to the benefits because the Medicaid Act gives the states substantial discretion \nin defining the allocation of benefits). \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 10 of 18 PageID #:2899\nFurthermore, once the court determines that the EPSDT age limit is an essential eligibility \nrequirement that is mandatory and non-waivable, the court cannot give Plaintiffs the type and \nquantity  of  services  they  received  as  children,  i.e.,  private  duty  nursing,  by  calling  it  a \n“reasonable modification” to some other Medicaid-funded program.  For all the reasons set forth \nabove, if it is a not a reasonable modification to extend the benefits of EPSDT services to \nindividuals  simply  because  they  passed  the  twenty-first  birthday,  it  is  not  a  reasonable \nmodification  to  the  Home  Services  Program  to  revive  the  benefits  of  EPSDT  for  some \nindividuals so that they can continue the status quo they enjoyed as children.  Like Alexander v. \nChoate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985), the funding caps in place in the Home Services Program, see e.g., \nPlaintiffs’ Local Rule 56.1(a)(3) SMF at Nos. 104-116, even when left unmodified, are not \nlinked to the Plaintiffs’ particular disabilities.  Defendant has not denied Plaintiffs meaningful \naccess to the Home Services Program. \nLastly, if the State of Illinois is required to continue funding out-of-State plan services for \nan individual simply because he or she is beyond the twenty-first birthday, the financial impact \non the State of Illinois is far from minimal.  The permanent injunctive relief sought here would \nrequire Defendant to maintain private duty nursing services for the Plaintiffs at the current level \nthey enjoy as the minimum service level.  Hampe Civil Docket at 54, pages 54-55.  Presumably, \na system must be in place by which Defendant can evaluate whether Plaintiffs have established a \nmedical need for private duty nursing services, because private duty nursing is listed in 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396d(a).  See Bontrager v. Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, ___ \nF.3d ___, 2012 WL 4372524 (C.A. 7th (Ind.) September 26, 2012).  The Plaintiffs are or were \nparticipating in a federal Medicaid Waiver for Medically Fragile and Technology Dependent \nChildren  (“MF/TD”)  and,  presumably,  want  the  case  management  services  they  received \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 11 of 18 PageID #:2900\ntogether with other MF/TD Waiver services to continue.   Moreover, there is a putative class in \nHarris v. Hamos, 12 C 7105 (N.D. Ill.), seeking continuation of private duty nursing services \nafter they attain age twenty-one.  See Harris Civil Docket at Doc. No. 1. The relief sought in \nHampe together with the relief sought in Harris, if granted, would impose massive funding \nobligations on Defendant that Congress declines to fund because of the EPSDT age limitation, as \npreviously stated.  As in Choate, the request to modify  Tennessee’s  Medicaid program by \nremoving the cap on the duration of hospital days covered “would be far from minimal” and well \nbeyond the accommodations that were required under Davis.  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. \n287, 308 (1985).  Given the financial impact, the State can properly resist the broad-based \ndistributive decision that would be required.  Id. \n B.  Plaintiffs Are Not “Otherwise Qualified” Within The Rehabilitation Act. \n \n The Rehabilitation Act, at 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (Westlaw 2012), requires Plaintiffs to show \n1) that they are disabled within the meaning of the Act, 2) that they are “otherwise qualified” for \nthe services sought, 3) that they were excluded from the services “solely by reason of her or his \ndisability,” and 4) that the program in question receives federal funds.  Aughe v. Shalala, 885 F. \nSupp. 1428, 1431 (W.D. Wash 1995).  Defendant adopts all the factual matter, arguments and \nauthorities contained in pages 3 through 11 of this combined Response and Memorandum of \nLaw to demonstrate that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the second requirement set forth above.  Since \nthe Rehabilitation Act requires the court to determine both whether an individual meets all the \nessential eligibility requirements and whether reasonable modifications exist, Aughe, id. at 1431, \nall the matters set forth above also establish that Plaintiffs are not “otherwise qualified” with the \nRehabilitation Act.  \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 12 of 18 PageID #:2901\n C.  Defendant Did Not Discriminate Against Plaintiffs  \nOn The Basis Of Disability. \n \n  Even  if  Plaintiffs  were  “qualified  individuals  with  a  disability”  under  the  ADA  or \n“otherwise qualified” individuals under the Rehabilitation Act, they cannot show that they been \ndenied the benefits of EPSDT, or any Medicaid services because of disability.  The ADA, at 42 \nU.S.C. § 12132 (Westlaw 2012), provides in pertinent part that “ … no qualified individual with \na disability shall, by reason of such disability, be denied the benefits of the … services … of a \npublic entity.” (Emphasis supplied).  The Rehabilitation Act, at 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (Westlaw \n2012), provides in pertinent part that no otherwise qualified individual with a disability “shall, \nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in … any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance ...” (Emphasis supplied).  When, as here, a neutral \nrule incidentally disqualifies a disabled individual from participation in services, then the neutral \napplication of that rule, i.e., the EPSDT age limit, cannot be said to be a decision actuated “solely \non the basis of disability.”  Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 400, 405 \n(1979); Wimberly v. Labor and Industrial Relations Commission of Missouri, 479 U.S. 511, 516-\n17 (1987); Sandison v. Michigan High School Athletic Ass’n, 64 F.3d 1026, 1030-34, 1036-37 \n(6th Cir. 1995).  The phrase “by reason of” requires a showing of proximate causation that is \nlacking in this case.  Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U.S. 258, 268 \n(1992).  \n  D.  Participation In The MF/TD Waiver Confers No  Right to Receive \nEPSDT Services Beyond The Age Of Twenty-One. \nUnder 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c), States may apply to the Secretary of HHS for a “waiver” to  \nallow the State to make medical assistance payments for home or community-based services \napproved by the Secretary and provided pursuant to a written plan of care to Medicaid-eligible \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 13 of 18 PageID #:2902\nindividuals with respect to whom there has been a determination that, but for the provision of \nsuch services, the individuals would require the level of care provided in a hospital, nursing \nfacility, or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded (“ICF/MR”) the cost of which \nwould be reimbursed under the State’s Title XIX plan.  42 U.S.C § 1396n(c)(1).  Illinois has in \neffect a federally-approved Medicaid waiver to provide to allow eligible medically fragile, and \ntechnology dependent children i.e., persons up to age twenty-one to remain in their homes \nknown as the Illinois Section 1915(c) Home and Community-based Services Waiver for Children \nthat are Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent.  The Defendant’s proposed renewal to the \nMF/TD Waiver is under discussion with representatives from the federal Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services. \n  Under the MF/TD Waiver, the services included: respite, specialized medical equipment \nand  supplies,  environmental  modifications,  family  training,  nurse  training,  placement \nmaintenance counseling and medically supervised day care.  Hampe Civil Docket at 173-5, \nPlaintiffs’ Exhibit No. 29 at HFS 000003; Defendant’s Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(C) SMF at Nos. \n154-55; Defendant’s Local Rule 56.1(a)(3) SMF at Nos. 27-28.  Nursing is the primary service \nreceived by waiver participants, but “it is not a waiver service.”  Id.  (Emphasis supplied).  The \nPlaintiffs are clearly seeking relief that is not available to them through the MF/TD Waiver.  Id.  \nParticipation in the MF/TD Waiver is neither material nor relevant to the disposition of the \nPlaintiffs’ claims.  Moreover, to the extent Plaintiffs argue that Defendant “can” or “should” or \n“could” apply to CMS to amend various federal Medicaid Waivers to secure terms that Plaintiffs \nwould like incorporated, Hampe Civil Docket at 176, pages 12-15, that is also neither relevant \nnor material to their claims.  Indeed, once the Secretary of HHS approves the waiver pursuant to \n42  U.S.C.  1396n(c),  the  federally-approved  waiver  document  controls  all  the  terms  and \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 14 of 18 PageID #:2903\nconditions for all home and community-based services offered.  Bertrand v. Maram, 2006 WL \n2735494 at *6 (N.D. Ill. September 25, 2006) (affirmed) Bertrand ex rel. Bertrand v. Maram, \n495 F.3d 452 (7th Cir. 2007).  Once the federal government approves the home and community-\nbased services waiver, courts will not second-guess or undo its provisions.  See Id.   Under the \nauthorities above, Plaintiffs’ arguments would appear to be a concession that the court cannot \norder Defendant to create, extend or amend a federal Medicaid Waiver in any particular manner.   \n  E.  Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) Does Not Aid Plaintiffs. \nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) does not help Plaintiffs.  In Olmstead, a group of \nmentally  disabled  individuals  brought  suit  against  State  officials  under  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act.  The Court characterized the issue as one concerning the proper construction of \nthe anti-discrimination provision of 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 587.  The Court \nstated that no constitutional issues were before it, id. at 588, and expressly stated that it was not \nruling on the validity of the regulations issued by the Attorney General.  Id. at 592.  Under \nOlmstead, officials of the State of Georgia were found to have violated Title II of the ADA by \nfailing to grant a reasonable modification to the State’s Medicaid program in the form of placing \ninstitutionalized persons into existing and unfilled community-based services programs.  Id. at \n601-03.  Nevertheless, the Supreme Court held that the State is permitted to resist modifications \nthat entail fundamental alterations of the State’s services and programs.  Id. at 603-07.  The \nCourt  held  that  “unjustified  isolation  …  is  properly  regarded  as  discrimination  based  on \ndisability.”  Id. at 597.  Olmstead is not a mandate to furnish all services to Medicaid-eligible \npersons in a home or community-based setting.  Id. at 605.  The Court also ruled that the States \nare obligated to mete out existing services with an “even hand” and “equitably.”  Olmstead, 527 \nat 597, 605.   The even handed treatment requirement of the ADA means that the State need not \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 15 of 18 PageID #:2904\ncreate new programs for anyone, because federal court review of the State’s judgment about \nestablishing or declining to establish new programs raises grave constitutional concerns.  Id. at \n612-13 (Kennedy, J. concurring).  The Court stated that the “States must adhere to the ADA’s \nnondiscrimination requirement with regard to the services they in fact provide.”  Id. at 603, n.14 \n(emphasis supplied). \nAs  previously  stated,  private  duty  nursing  is  not  a  Medicaid-covered  service  under \nIllinois’ Title XIX State Plan.  Nothing in Olmstead requires Defendant to provide optional \nMedicaid services the State of Illinois has chosen not to cover.  Nothing in Olmstead obligates \nDefendant to create a program for individuals who age-out of EPSDT services.  Olmstead does \nnot stand for the proposition that creating a program for persons who are not eligible for any \nservices is a reasonable modification; rather, the modification Olmstead found to be reasonable \nwas  the  affirmative  act  of  taking  qualified  individuals  from  an  institution  into  existing \ncommunity placements for which they were eligible.  No such facts are present in this case.  \nMoreover, the medical evidence Plaintiffs presented here, even if competent, is not material to \nwhether Plaintiffs could qualify for any other Medicaid programs or services. \n  F.  28 C.F.R. §§ 35.10(d) and 41.51(d) Do Not Create Any Right \nTo Integration. \n \nThe integration regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.10(d) and 41.51(d) (Westlaw 2012) do not \nimpose any affirmative obligations on the Defendant independent of the ADA and Section 504.  \nRegulations  creating  rights  independent  of  any  federal  statute  are  not  enforceable  laws.  \nMungiovi v. Chicago Housing Authority, 98 F.3d 982, 983-84 (7th Cir. 1996).  In Alexander v. \nSandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 285-93 (2001), the Supreme Court held that federal agencies were \nauthorized to “effectuate” Title VI by issuing regulations, but that they could only effectuate \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 16 of 18 PageID #:2905\nrights already created by statute and could not themselves create new rights or rights of action.  \nSee also Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 592 (1999).  Both 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(d) and 41.51(d) \nstate that the “public entity” and “recipient” shall administer services, program and activities “in \nthe most integrated setting appropriate to the needs” of qualified individuals with disabilities.  \nThese regulations, compared to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, previously cited, impose new \naffirmative obligations that have no textual support in the statutes.  Compare 42 U.S.C. § 12132 \nand 29 U.S.C. § 7949(a) with 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(d) and 41.51(d)    Under these authorities, \nsince the integration regulations create new rights and new causes of action that the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act themselves do not recognize, they are not enforceable and do not authorize \nthe relief Plaintiffs seek here. \nG.  Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. 2004) Does Not Aid Plaintiffs. \n \nThe Seventh Circuit’s decision in Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. 2004) \ndoes not aid Plaintiffs.  In Radaszewski, the Seventh Circuit reversed the lower court’s dismissal \nof Plaintiff’s ADA claim and reversed a judgment on the pleadings for Defendant under the \nRehabilitation Act that the claim failed as a matter of law.  The claims asserted in Radaszewski \nwere claims for a reasonable modification for an individual and are not similar to the claims \nasserted here on behalf of the Plaintiff class.   \nIn Radaszewski, the Seventh Circuit did not merely confine itself to a determination that \nthe Radaszewski complaint stated a claim for relief and could proceed to trial.  Instead, the court \nheld as a matter of law, without an answer from the Defendant, and without the benefit of a fully \ndeveloped record that, first, Eric Radaszewski is a “qualified individual with a disability” under \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 612-613 (“[f]or present purposes it \nappears undisputed that Eric is qualified for the receipt of home services through the HSP ...”).  \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 17 of 18 PageID #:2906\nSecond, the Seventh Circuit held as a matter of law, and without the benefit of a fully developed \nrecord  that  Eric  Radaszewski  was  “qualified”  i.e.,  eligible  for  Defendant’s  Home  Services \nProgram.  Id. at 613.  Third, the Seventh Circuit found, as a matter of law, that an inference \ncould be drawn from the pleadings that Eric Radaszewski satisfied the Olmstead criteria.  Id. at \n614-615.  Fourth, the Seventh Circuit described the services Eric Radaszewski received before \nhe turned twenty-one.  The court stated that Eric was in the Medically Fragile and Technology \nDependent Children’s Waiver and received “private duty shift nursing” through that Medicaid \nWaiver.  Id. at 602.  It was not clear that private duty nursing was an MF/TD service at that time.  \nIn any event, since 2001 when Illinois’ Title XIX State Medicaid plan was amended to remove \noptional private duty nursing services, private duty nursing is available only to children through \nthe EPSDT requirements, whether a child is in the MF/TD Waiver or not.  Defendant’s Local \nRule 56.1(b)(3)(C) SMF at Nos. 139, 142-43, 154-55; Defendant’s Local Rule 56.1(a)(3) SMF at \nNos.  13,  16-17,  27-28.    Finally,  Radaszewski  and  its  progeny  were  claims  for  ADA  and \nRehabilitation Act modifications by individuals in individual cases.  To the extent Plaintiffs \nargue these cases can be read for the proposition that the ADA and Rehabilitation Act authorize \nthe court to rewrite an Act of Congress and modify Defendant’s EPSDT obligations, or the \nHome Services Program, to extend the benefits of EPSDT and MF/TD to individuals who have \npassed the twenty-first birthday, e.g., Hampe Civil Docket at 176, pages 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 at n.5, \n12, 13, 14, 15-18, all the arguments and authorities set forth in this combined Response and \nMemorandum of Law establish that such modifications are not reasonable.  \n \n \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 193 Filed: 10/10/12 Page 18 of 18 PageID #:2907\nIV.

HAMPE, by and through his  ) \nmother I guardian Jill Hampe, individually  ) \nand on behalf of a class,  ) \nPlaintiff,  ) \n)  No.  10-3121 \nvs.  ) \n)  Judge:  William J. Hibler \nJULIE HAMOS, in her official capacity  ) \nas Director of the Illinois Department of  )  Magistrate: Arlander Keys \nHealthcare and Family Services,  ) \n) \nDefendant.  ) \nPLAINTIFF'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW \nIN SUPPORT OF CLASS CERTIFICATION \nNow comes the Plaintiff, by and through his attorney and files this Memorandum of Law \nin support of the Plaintiffs Motion for Class Certification as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Plaintiff, a medically fragile person, on behalf of himself and others similarly \nsituated, has been found by the State of Illinois to be eligible and have been enrolled in the \nIllinois \"Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver for Children that are \nMedically Fragile, Technology Dependent\" program (MFITD) or Medicaid.  Enrollment in the \nMFITD program is only available to persons under the age of21 and when William will tum 21 \non June 18, 2010 or when any person enrolled in the program turns 21 in the MF I lTD program, \nthe Defendant's policy and practice is to reduce the existing medical funding by approximately \n50% based solely on the fact that the person is now 21.  The reduction in funding is not due to a \nchange in a person's medical needs but on the fact that the person's funding at age 21 comes \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 13 Filed: 06/02/10 Page 2 of 13 PageID #:173\nfrom a different State program, which has significant caps on funding.  The reduction in funding \nwill either result in William and others similarly situated  becoming institutionalized \n(hospitalized) or if the person remains in his family home without sufficient skilled nursing care, \nthen that person faces a strong possibility of imminent death. \nThe Plaintiff has brought this action to enjoin the policy and/or practice of the Defendant \nto reduce funding for necessary and needed medical services when aging out of the State of \nIllinois Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent program (MF/TD).  The Plaintiff claims that \nthe Defendant's practice to reduce necessary medical funding when aging out of the MF/TD \nprogram or Medicaid violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12132  and \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794(a) and their implementing regulations, \n28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.130(d), 41.51(d). \nCLASS DEFINITION \nThe Plaintiffs seek certification as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure.  The proposed class is defined as follows: \nAll persons who are enrolled or will be enrolled or were \nenrolled in the State of Illinois Medically Fragile, Technology \nDependent Medicaid Waiver Program (MF/TD) or Medicaid and \nwhen they obtain the age of21 years are subjected to reduce \nMedicaid funding which reduces the medical level of care which \nthey had been receiving prior to obtaining 21 years. \nARGUMENT \nParties seeking class action certification must first satisfy the provisions of Rule 23(a) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Then, in addition, the case must fit within at least one of \n111 \nthe three subcategories under Rule 23(b).  Rosario v. Lividitis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1017 (7 Cir. \n2 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 13 Filed: 06/02/10 Page 3 of 13 PageID #:174\n1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1051, 113 S. Ct.972 (1993).  All four 23 (a) prerequisites are quite \nundoubtedly satisfied here, and this case falls squarely under the 23 (b )(2) category. \nOn a motion for class certification, the Court must accept as true all facts alleged in \nPlaintiffs' complaint.  See Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-178, 94 S. Ct. 2140, \n2152 ( 197 4) (\"We find nothing in either the language or history of Rule 23 that gives court any \nauthority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether \nit may be maintained as a class action.\"); Gammon v. GC Services Limited Partnership, 162 \nF.D.R. 313, 315, n. 2 (N.D. Ill. 1995) (When evaluating a motion for class certification, the Court \naccepts all well-pleaded facts as true.\"); Pertiz v. Liberty Loan Corp., 523 F.2d 349, 353-54(7th \n. \nCir. 1975); Gomez v. Illinois State Bd. Of Educ., 117 F.R.D. 394, 396 (N.D. Ill. 1987): Newburg \non Class Actions, Sec. 3.20, p. 3-124 (\"It is settled law that any preliminary inquiry into or \nconsideration of the merits of litigation is improper in connection with a determination of the \npropriety of a class action,\") Moreover, \"the interests of justice require that in a doubtful \ncase ... any error, if there is to be one, should be committed in favor of allowing a class action.\" \nEisenberg v. Gagnon, 766 F.2d 770, 785 (3rct Cir.), cert. Denied, 474 U.S. 946 (1985); Esplin v. \nHirschi, 402 F.2d 94, 101 (lOth Cir), cert denied, 394 U.S. 928 (1969); Tapken v.  Brown, 1992 \nWL 17894, *26 (S.D. Fla); Horton v. Goose Creek Independent School District, 690 F.2d 470, \n487, n. 32 (5th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1207 (1983); Brown v. Cameron-Brown Co., 92 \nF.R.D. 32,50 (E.D. Va. 1981). \nAdditionally, civil rights cases alleging discriminatory policies or practices are \"by \ndefinition\" class actions, provided they meet the other requirements of Rule 23(a).  General \nTelephone Co., v.  Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 (1982); see also Robert E.  v. Lane, 530 F.Supp. \n3 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 13 Filed: 06/02/10 Page 4 of 13 PageID #:175\n930, 944 (N.D. Ill. 1980) (a case alleging civil rights violations represent a \"prototypical \ncandidate\" for class certification).  Class certification is routinely allowed in civil rights cases \nalleging states' violations ofthe community integration mandates of the Americas with \nDisabilities Act.  See Colbert v. Blagojevich, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75102, *28 (N.D. Ill. Sept. \n29, 2008) (J. Lefkow) (certifying class consisting of\"all Medicaid-eligible adults with disabilities \nin Cook County, Illinois, who are being, or may in the future be, unnecessary confined to nursing \nfacilities and who, with appropriate supports and services, may be able to live in a community \nsetting\"). \n1.  Plaintiff Has Established The Prerequisites For A Class Action Pursuant To \nRule 23(a) \nA.  Numerosity \nThe Class is so numerous that joinder of all persons is impracticable. The Illinois \nDepartment of Healthcare and Family Services \"Report of Medicaid Services for Persons who \nare Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent\" dated December, 2009 stated that as of \nSeptember 1, 2009, 504 children were receiving services in the MF/TD program on that specific \ndate.  The report fm1her states that from July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008, 606 children had \nreceived services in the MF/TD program.  (See Exhibit \"A\" attached to Plaintiffs Motion for \nClass Certification at page 3, Section 1) \n37 individuals aged out of the waiver for the period of July 1, 2007 through December, \n2009.  (See Exhibit \"A\" attached to Plaintiffs Motion for Class Certification at page 9, Section \n6)  In Jones v. Maram, 373 Ill.App.3d 184 (3rct Dist. 2007), Barbara Ginder from the State of \nIllinois stated in an affidavit \"there were 34 active cases of 18 to 20-year-old individuals, 19 of \n4 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 13 Filed: 06/02/10 Page 5 of 13 PageID #:176\nwhom were ventilator dependent\" in the MFTDC program. !d., at 192.  \"Ginder stated these \nindividuals are likely to transition from MF/TD to HSP [Home Services Program] (if they select) \nat age 21.\" !d.  The class members have limited financial resources and are unlikely to institute \nindividual actions. \nCourts have ruled that a class action can proceed with a group which would encompass \nthe size of the persons either enrolled or exiting the MF/TD program.  See Barner v.  City of \nHarvey,  1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3570, No. 95 C 3316, 1997 WL 139469, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 25, \n1997) (class of 13 sufficiently numerous); Davy v. Sullivan, 354 F.Supp. 1320 (M.D. Ala. 1973) \n(class of 10 adequate). \nCase law has also recognized that courts should make \"common assumptions\" to support \na finding of numerosity.  Grossman v.  Waste Management, Inc., 162 F.R.D. 322, 329 (N.D. Ill. \n1995).  The numerosity requirement should be construed liberally in civil rights actions.  Jones v. \nDiamond, 519 F.2d 1090, 1100 (51 Cir, 1975). \nh \nOther circumstances also point to impracticability of joinder.  As Medicaid recipients, \nclass members are located throughout the state and do not have the financial means to bring \nindividual lawsuits.  Fields v. Maram, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16291, *18 (\"Because the class \nmembers reside throughout the state, and because they are disabled and therefore are often of \nlimited financial resources, joinder would be particulary difficult in this case.\").  Finally, judicial \neconomy plainly would be served by consolidating the actions of all similarly-situated persons \nrather than having them litigate individually.  Arenson v.  Whitehall Convalescent & Nursing \nHome,  164 F.R.D. 659, 663  (N.D. Ill. 1996).  Accordingly, in this case, numerosity is satisfied \nbecause the joinder of all individuals affected by the Defendant's policy is impracticable. \n5 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 13 Filed: 06/02/10 Page 6 of 13 PageID #:177\nB.  Commonality \nRule 23(a) requires that there \"need be only a single issue common to all members of the \nclass.\"  Edmondson v. Simon, 86 F.R.D. 375, 380 (N.D. Ill. 1980); Hispanics United v.  Vi!!.  of \nAddison, 160 F.R.D. 681, 688 (N.D. Ill. 1995).  \"A common nucleus of operative fac is usually \nenough to satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).\"  Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d \n1013, 1018 (7th Cir. 1992).  See also Lightbourn v. County of El Palso, 118 F.3d 421,425 (5th \nCir. 1997) (\"The commonality test is met when there is at least one issue, the resolution of which \nwill affect all or a significant number ofthe putative class members.\") (citations omitted); Baby \nNeal v.  Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 55 (3rd Cir. 1994) (commonality met where \"named plaintiffs share at \nleast one question of fact or law with the grievances of the prospective class\"); Maris of A. v. \nGuiliani, 126 F.3d 372,375 (2nd Cir. 1997) (class must \"share a common question of law or \nfact\"). \nIn fact, \"[w]hen the party opposing the class has engaged in some course of conduct that \neffects a group of persons and gives rise to a cause of action, one or more of the elements of that \ncause of action will be common to all of the persons affected.\"  Newburg on Class Actions, Sec. \n3.1 0, p 3-51.  So long as one issue of law or fact is common to the class, \"the presence of \nindividual questions will not prevent satisfaction of the Rule 23 (a) (2) prerequisite.\" !d. at p. 3-\n60.  See also Ivy v. Meridian Coco-Cola Bottling Co., 108 F.R.D. 118, 123 (S.D. Miss. 1985) \n(holding that commonality and typicality were satisfied in an employment discrimination case \ndespite the defendant's argument that individual questions would predominate concerning each \nhiring decision); Patrykus, 121 F.R.D. at 361 (holding that \"[d]ifferences in individual cases \nconcerning treatment or damages does not defeat commonality\"); Krislov v. Rednour, 946 \n6 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 13 Filed: 06/02/10 Page 7 of 13 PageID #:178\nF.Supp. 563, 568 (N.D. Ill1996). \nEven when the effect on each class member differs, an allegation that the defendant's \ndiscriminatory policy or practice affects the class as a whole will suffice to prove commonality of \nclaims.  Rosairio v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1017 (7th Cir. 1992) (\"The fact that there is some \nfactual variation among class grievances will not defeat a class action.\") (citing Patterson v. \nGeneral Motors Corp., 631 F.2d 476,481 (7th Cir.) cert. denied, 451 U.S. 914 (1980)).  Thus, \neven if each class member's remedy differs, there is commonality if the injury flows from the \nsame discriminatory acts or omissions.  See Marisol A. v.  Guiliani, 126 F.3d 372, 376 (2\"ct Cir. \n1997) (in class action involving foster children, \"[t]he unique circumstances of each child do not \ncompromise the common question of whether, as plaintiffs allege, defendants have failed to meet \ntheir federal and state law obligations.\") \nThe common questions of law and fact in the present case are as follows: \n(a)  Whether the Defendant violated the ADA and Rehabilitation Act by \nreducing the level of funding for persons enrolled in the Illinois Medically \nFragile, Technology Dependent Medicaid Waiver Program or Medicaid which \nresulted in a reduction of medical services. \n(b) Whether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act permits the Defendant to reduce the \nlevel of funding which results in a reduction of medical services for disabled \npersons after the age of 21, even though there has been no change in their \nmedical needs. \n(c) Whether a fundamental alteration of the Illinois disability programs would \noccur if the Defendant provided funding to continue the same level of services \nfor the Plaintiff and the putative class when they turn the age of 21 years. \n(d)  Whether compelling an increase in the \"exceptional care rate\" for persons \nexiting the MF/TD program into the Illinois Home Services Program is \nunreasonable under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. \n(e) Whether the Illinois disability programs can reasonable accommodate a \n7 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 13 Filed: 06/02/10 Page 8 of 13 PageID #:179\nmodification to their existing programs to allow the Plaintiff and putative \nclass to continue to receive the same level of care in the community when \nthey turn 21 years of age. \nAccordingly, this Court should find that commonality exists. \nC.  Typicality \nTypicality determines whether a sufficient relationship exists between the injury to the \nnamed plaintiff and the conduct affecting the class, so that the court may properly attribute a \ncollective nature to the challenged conduct.  General Telephone Company ofS outhwest v. \nFalcon, 457 U.S. 147, 152 (1982).  When it is alleged that the same unlawful conduct was \ndirected at or affected both the named plaintiff and the class sought to be represented, the \ntypicality requirement is met irrespective of varying fact patterns which underlie individual \nclaims.  ld; see also Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 936-937 (2nd Cir. 1998); Baby Neal ex ref \nKanter v.  Casey, 43 F.3d 48,56 (3rct Cir. 1994).  Courts should look to the elements ofthe cause \nof action that the class representative must prove in order to establish the defendant's liability.  If \nthey are substantially the same as those needed to be proved by the class members' claims, the \nrepresentative's claim is typical.  Johns v. DeLeonardis, 145 F.R.D. 480, 483 (N.D. Ill. 1992). \nAs with commonality, typicality does not require that all class members suffer the same \ninjury as the named plaintiff.  \"Instead, we look to the defendant's conduct and the plaintiffs \nlegal theory to satisfy Rule 23(a)(3).\"  Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (71 Cir. 1992); \nh \nsee also De La Fuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, 713 F.2d 225, 232 (71 Cir. 1983) (typicality \nh \nsatisfied regardless of whether \"there are factual distinctions between the claims of the named \nplaintiffs and those of other class members.  Thus, similarity of legal theory may control even in \nthe face of differences of fact.\"). \n8 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 13 Filed: 06/02/10 Page 9 of 13 PageID #:180\nHere, the Plaintiffs claims are typical of the claims of the class.  The Plaintiff, a medically \nfragile person, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, has been found by the State of \nIllinois to be eligible and have been enrolled in the Illinois \"Medicaid Home and Community-\nBased Services (HCBS) Waiver for Children that are Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent\" \nprogram.  (MF/TD)  When the Plaintiff turns 21 or when any person enrolled in the MF/TD \nturns 21, the Defendant's policy and practice is to reduce the existing medical funding by \napproximately 50% based solely on the fact that the person is now 21.  The reduction in funding \nis not due to a change in a person's medical needs but on the fact that the person's funding at age \n21 comes from a different State program, which has significant caps on funding. 1  The reduction \nin funding will either result in the Plaintiff and others similarly situated  becoming \ninstitutionalized (hospitalized) or if the person remains in his family home without sufficient \nskilled nursing care, then that person faces a strong possibility of imminent death. \nBecause the named Plaintiff and the class share the same deprivations of federal rights, \ntypicality is met here. \nD.  Adequacy of representation \nThe two factors that are universally recognized as the guidelines for adequate \nrepresentation are: 1) the representative must not have interests antagonistic to or conflicting with \nthe interests of the class, and 2) the representative must appear able to prosecute the action \n1  William currently receives funding from the Defendant for approximately 16 hours a \nday skilled nursing level of care at his home (112 hours per week) plus he is eligible for 336 \nrespite skilled nursing hours per year.  (Plts. Complaint par. 18(a)).  The current level of funding \nis approximately $18,000 per month, so that he does not have to be institutionalized or \nhospitalized at a rate of approximately $55,000 per month.  (Plts.

Solar Power Modules Tax Shelter Invs. Sees. \nLitig., 122 F.R.D. 251, 257 (C.D. Cal. 1988) (holding that the plaintiffs were adequate \nrepresentatives for the class where they expressed an interest in and understanding of the case \nand participated in depositions).  The party opposing a class has the burden to establish that \nrepresentation is inadequate.  Lewis v.  Curtis, 671 F.2d 779, 788 (3rd Cir. 1982 ), cert. denied, \n459 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 176 (1982). \nThe Plaintiff is an adequate representative of the putative class.  The ability of the \nPlaintiff to represent the class goes to whether he has \"sufficient interest in the outcome to insure \nvigorous advocacy,\" Rosario, 963 F.2d at 1018, as well as any interests \"antagonistic to the \ninterests ofthe class.\"  Riordan, 113 F.R.D. 60, 64 (N.D. Ill. 1986).  Courts may deny \ncertification based on grounds of antagonism only if that antagonism \"goes to the subject matter \nof the litigation.\" !d. Potential conflicts that are remote or speculative will not defeat class \ncertification.  Hi~panics United,  160 F.R.D. at 689. \nIn this case, the Plaintiffs interest is entirely coextensive with those of the class.  The \nPlaintiff and the putative class share the same claim to prevent the Defendant from reducing the \nlevel of necessary medical funding when they turn 21 years of age in order to avoid \ninstitionalization (hospitalization) or avoid remaining in the community with reduced funding \nwithout sufficient skilled nursing care faces a strong possibility of imminent death.

Plaintiffs Meet The Requirements Of Rule 23(b )(2) \nPlaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b) (2), which allows courts to certify a class if \nthe defendant \"has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby \nmaking appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole.\"  Fed.R.Civ.Proc.23(b)(2).  Civil rights cases against parties charged with \nbroad-based discrimination are \"prime examples\" of actions under Rule 23(b )(2).  Amchem \nProducts v.  Windsor,  521 U.S. 591, 613 (1997). \nThis case is exemplary of a Rule 23(b)(2) action because the Defendant's policies and \npractices affect all members ofthe class as well as the named Plaintiffs, the remediation of which \nis well-suited for and requires declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs do not seek monetary \ndamages for themselves or the class.  Indeed, it is commonplace for courts to certify classes \nunder Rule 23(b )(2) in cases where Medicaid recipients seek to enforce their rights to benefits. \nSee  Doe by Doe, v.

Rules Civ. P. 20 and 21, stating as \nfollows: \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 2 of 15 PageID #:1086\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n  The original named Plaintiff to this action, William R. Hampe, seeks declaratory relief on \nhis own behalf, and on behalf of a class, because the Defendant allegedly violates the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (hereinafter “ADA”), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (hereinafter “Section 504”), and their implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. \n§§  35.130(d)  and  41.51(d)  (appended  as  Defendant’s  Exhibit  A),  by  reducing  funding  and \nconcomitant medical services when they reach age 21 and lose eligibility for the State of Illinois’ \nMedical Fragile and Technology Dependent Children’s Medicaid Waiver.  (Hampe v. Hamos, U.S. \nCivil Docket, 10 C 3121 at Doc. No. 1, Request for Relief (b), p. 27, hereinafter cited as “Civil \nDocket  Doc.  No.  ___”).    Plaintiff  Hampe  and  the  putative  class  also  seek  preliminary  and \npermanent injunctive relief “requiring the Defendant to restore the level of funding to maintain the \nexisting medical services for the Plaintiffs and putative class prior to aging out of the State of \nIllinois Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent program (MF/TD).”  (Id. at Request for Relief \n(c), p. 28). \nPlaintiff Hampe alleged that before he reached age 21, he was eligible to participate in a \nfederally-approved Medicaid Waiver that allowed him to receive certain services in his home that \nwould not otherwise be available to Medicaid recipients.  (Id. at ¶¶ 1, 2).  Plaintiff alleged that \nthese services ended when he reached the age of 21 because the federally-approved Medicaid \nWaiver involved, the State of Illinois Medically Fragile and Technology Dependent Children’s \nWaiver (hereinafter “MF/TD”), is limited to individuals under the age of 21.  (Id. at ¶ 1).  Plaintiff \nalleged and Defendant denied that he received 16 hours per day of skilled nursing care in his home \nthrough MF/TD.  (Id. at ¶ 1; Civil Docket at Doc. No. 16, ¶ 1). \nPlaintiff Hampe did not allege that Defendant intentionally discriminated against him, or \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 3 of 15 PageID #:1087\nthat any act on Defendant’s part had a disparate impact on him.  Rather, Plaintiff’s claim is that \nDefendant  “systemically”  or  “per  se”  violates  the  ADA,  Section  504  and  the  implementing \nregulations by “reducing” funding and medical services simply because he and the putative class \nmembers “aged out” of MF/TD when they reached age 21.  Defendant vigorously contests this \nclaim.  (Civil Docket at Doc. No. 1, ¶¶ 3, 4; Doc. No. 16, ¶¶ 3, 4).  Among other things, Defendant \noffered each Plaintiff an opportunity to participate in a home and community-based services \nprogram for adults based on their individual circumstances and needs. \nDefendant answered the original Complaint on June 14, 2010.  (Civil Docket at Doc. No. \n16).  Before the Defendant filed her Answer, Plaintiff Hampe and Defendant agreed to maintain \nthe status quo for him.  (Civil Docket at Doc. No. 11).  Within a month of the filing of the Answer, \nPlaintiff  moved  for  leave  to  file  an  Amended  Complaint  to  add  a  new  Plaintiff,  Richard  L. \nWinfrey, III (Civil Docket at Doc. No. 22), and filed the Amended Complaint on July 15, 2010.  \n(Civil Docket at Doc. No. 21). \nPlaintiff Richard L. Winfrey, III made identical allegations as to Defendant’s purported \nsystemic violations of the ADA, Section 504 and the implementing regulations (Civil Docket at \nDoc. No. 21, ¶¶ 1, 2), and sought the same relief as Plaintiff Hampe.  (Id. at Prayer for Relief (a) \nthrough (d), pp. 21-22).  However, the factual allegations of each Plaintiff set forth at Paragraphs \n19(a) through 34 and Paragraphs 45 through 74 demonstrate that the situations of each Plaintiff are \ndissimilar.  (Civil Docket at Doc. No. 21, ¶¶ 19(a)-34, 45-74).  Each Plaintiff has alleged different \ndisabilities and differing needs.  (Id.)  The factual allegations show that the degrees to which each \nPlaintiff requires assistance with the activities of daily living vary.  (Id.)  The factual allegations of \neach Plaintiff require different proof, including the introduction of differing medical histories and \nopinions from different physicians.  (Id.)  The alleged threatened loss of in-home skilled nursing \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 4 of 15 PageID #:1088\nservices resulted, not from any adverse action taken against any Plaintiff by any State employee, \nbut because each Plaintiff lost eligibility for a home and community-based services program due to \nage.  (Id.)  The actions complained of occurred at different times.  (Id.)  There are no allegations \nthat there is a causal link between a common and identifiable wrongful act on Defendant’s part and \nadverse actions taken with respect to each Plaintiff.  (Id.)  No Plaintiff alleged that there is any \nrelationship between them as to their alleged threatened loss of in-home nursing.  (Id.)  The alleged \n“policy” to which each Plaintiff claims to have been subjected is not a policy at all, but, rather, loss \nof eligibility for Medicaid-funded benefits due to age.  (Id.)   \nShortly before Defendant answered the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff Winfrey secured an \nAgreed  Order  to  maintain  his  pre-21st  birthday  status  quo.    (Civil  Docket  at  Doc.  No.  33).   \nDefendant answered the Amended Complaint on August 3, 2010 (Civil Docket at Doc. No. 37), \nand Plaintiff repeated the pattern of obtaining leave to add a new Plaintiff, Adam Cale, filing a \nSecond Amended Complaint, and securing an Agreed Order to maintain Adam Cale’s pre-21st \nbirthday status quo.  (Civil Docket at Doc. Nos. 38, 41, 49).  A comparison of Plaintiff Cale’s \nfactual allegations to those of the other two Plaintiffs demonstrates that all the dissimilarities \npreviously described between Plaintiffs Hampe and Winfrey are present among the three named \nPlaintiffs in the Second Amended Complaint.  (Civil Docket at Doc. No. 41, ¶¶ 20(a)-43, 54-98). \n           Plaintiff Hampe’s motion for class certification was fully briefed as of July 16, 2010.  (Civil \nDocket  at  Doc.  Nos.  12,  17,  27).    The  motion  for  class  certification  is  awaiting  decision.  \nAdditionally, by order entered September 7, 2010, the Court set the Pretrial Scheduling Order.  \n(Civil Docket at Doc. No. 51).  Discovery has been progressing since the entry of the Pretrial \nScheduling Order.  The Scheduling Order gave the parties until October 29, 2010 to amend the \npleadings and to “add new parties.”  (Id.) \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 5 of 15 PageID #:1089\nOn October 28, Plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Complaint that added five new Plaintiffs.  \n(Civil Docket at Doc. No. 54).  A comparison of Plaintiff Welter’s, Baron’s, Lytle’s, Stracka’s, \nand  Stout’s  allegations  to  those  of  Plaintiffs  Hampe,  Winfrey  and  Cale,  shows  that  all  the \ndissimilarities previously identified between the Plaintiffs are present among all eight.  (Civil \nDocket at Doc. No. 54, ¶¶ 27(a)-92, 103-209).  Plaintiff, Olivia Welter, on November 2, 2010, \nsecured an Agreed Order maintaining her pre-21st birthday status quo.  (Civil Docket at Doc. No. \n58).  Before the time for Defendant to answer or otherwise plead to the Third Amended Complaint \nelapsed, Plaintiffs moved for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint instanter.  (Civil Docket at \nDoc. No. 61).  The Fourth Amended Complaint seeks to add a new Plaintiff, Kristen Kocourek.  A \ncomparison of Ms. Kocourek’s factual allegations to those of the eight Plaintiffs already in the \ncase under the Third Amended Complaint shows that all the dissimilarities previously identified \nbetween the Plaintiffs are present among all nine individuals.  (Civil Docket at Doc. No. 61, \nExhibit A at ¶¶ 28(a)-99, 110-240). \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  PLAINTIFF’S  MOTION  FOR  LEAVE  TO  FILE  A  FOURTH  AMENDED \nCOMPLAINT INSTANTER SHOULD BE DENIED. \n   \n  The decision to grant or deny a party’s request to amend a complaint rests with the sound \ndiscretion of the District Court.  Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962).  Under Foman, leave \nto  amend  should  ordinarily  be  freely  given,  unless  the  non-moving  party  establishes  undue \nprejudice by virtue of the allowance of the amendment.  Foman, Id.; Ferguson v. Roberts, 11 F.3d \n696, 706 (7th Cir. 1993); Lover v. District of Columbia, 248 F.R.D. 319, 322 (D.D.C. 2008).  The \nSeventh Circuit has recognized that amendment of a complaint will result in prejudice to the \nDefendant when the amended complaint contains new complex and serious charges which would \nundoubtedly require additional discovery for the Defendant to rebut, or when it appears to be a \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 6 of 15 PageID #:1090\ntactic to postpone presentation of the case on the merits.  Ferguson, 11 F.3d at 706.  In Ferguson, \nplaintiff sought to amend the complaint one month before the close of discovery.  Id.  The Seventh \nCircuit found that denying leave to amend the complaint comported with Foman.  Id. \n  Here, Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File a Fourth Amended Complaint came after the time \nfor amending pleadings and adding parties set by the Court’s Pretrial Scheduling Order.  First, the \nCourt should simply enforce its Pretrial Scheduling Order and summarily deny leave to amend the \nComplaint yet again.  Second, even if Plaintiffs satisfy the Court that they had valid reasons to \ndisregard the time limit as to amendment of pleadings, allowing the Fourth Amended Complaint to \nbe filed is unduly prejudicial to Defendant by expanding the scope of discovery that Defendant \nwould be required to take in order to prepare to rebut Ms. Kocourek’s case.  Defendant is engaged \nin attempting to complete discovery as to the three Plaintiffs (Hampe, Winfrey and Cale) who were \nin the case when the Pretrial Scheduling Order was entered.  The parties have not even begun the \nprocess of disclosures required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 or discovery as to any other Plaintiffs.  Fact \ndiscovery is set to close on January 31, 2011 and Defendant does not believe that discovery could \nbe completed in that time in light of the state of the pleadings.  Defendant must start the disclosure \nand discovery process anew if Ms. Kocourek joins the case as a Plaintiff.  Additionally, as the \nStatement of Facts shows, Plaintiffs are simply engaged in pressing new claims from time to time \nso as to delay close of discovery and disposition of the merits of the case.  Under Ferguson, leave \nto file the Fourth Amended Complaint must be denied. \n  Finally, if a proposed amendment would add additional parties to the litigation, the Court \nmust also consider Fed. R. Civ. P. 20 which governs permissive joinder.  Lover v. District of \nColumbia, 248 F.R.D. 319, 322-23 (D.D.C. 2008) citing Robinson v. Gillespie, 219 F.R.D. 179, \n188 (D. Kan. 2003).  The addition of Ms. Kocourek does not satisfy the criteria for permissive \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 7 of 15 PageID #:1091\njoinder set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(1) under all the arguments and authorities set forth in \nArgument II which Defendant fully adopts here.   \nII.  CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS SHOULD BE DISMISSED AS MISJOINDED PARTIES \nAND  DIRECTED  TO  PURSUE  THEIR  CLAIMS  AGAINST  DEFENDANT  IN \nSEPARATE,  INDIVIDUAL  ACTIONS  BECAUSE  THE  REQUIREMENTS  FOR \nPERMISSIVE JOINDER PURSUANT TO Fed. R Civ. P. 20(a)(1) HAVE NOT BEEN MET. \n \n  Fed. R. Civ. P. 21 states that, “On motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just \nterms, add or drop a party.”  Since Rule 21 does not provide any standards by which district courts \ncan determine if parties are misjoined, courts have looked to Fed. R. Civ. P. 20 for guidance.  \nAcevedo v. Allsup’s Convenience Stores, Inc., 600 F.3d 516, 521 (5th Cir. 2010) citing Pan Am. \nWorld  Airways,  Inc.  v.  U.S.  District  Court,  523  F.2d  1073,  1079  (9th  Cir.  1975).    Rule  21 \nauthorizes the court to dismiss any misjoined party at any stage of a lawsuit.  Bailey v. Northern \nTrust Co., 196 F.R.D. 513, 515 (N.D. Ill. 2000).  In such a case, the court can dismiss all but the \nfirst named plaintiff without prejudice to the institution of new, separate lawsuits by the dropped \nplaintiffs against the present defendant based upon the claims attempted to be set forth in the \npresent complaint.  Coughlin v. Rogers, 130 F.3d 1348, 1350 (9th Cir. 1997).  \n  Fed. R. Civ. P. 20 provides in pertinent part: \n \n      (1)  Plaintiffs.  Persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if: \n           \n             (A)  they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in \n           the alternative with respect to or arising out of the \n               same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions \n           or occurrences; and \n \n             (B)  any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs \n          will arise in the action.  \n \nParties are misjoined when they fail to satisfy either of the preconditions for persmissive joinder \nset forth above in Rule 20(a)(1).  Bailey, 196 F.R.D. at 515; Harris v. Spellman, 150 F.R.D. 130, \n131 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (two independent prerequisites must be present to support permissive joinder \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 8 of 15 PageID #:1092\nunder Rule 20(a):  a right to relief arising from a single occurrence or series of occurrences and a \ncommon question of law or fact).  Emphasis in original. \n    A.     The Claims Asserted By Plaintiffs Do Not Arise Out Of The  \n             Same Transaction Or Occurrence. \n \n  The Third Amended Complaint does not even purport to allege that  the eight named \nPlaintiffs are asserting a right to relief jointly or severally within Rule 20(a)(1)(A).  (Civil Docket \nat Doc. No. 54).  Moreover, the eight named Plaintiffs’ alleged right to relief does not arise out of \nthe  “same  transaction,  occurrence,  or  series  of  transactions  or  occurrences”  within  Rule \n20(a)(1)(A).  In determining whether plaintiffs have been misjoined, a case-by-case approach is \ngenerally pursued because no hard and fast rules have been established.  Grayson v. K-Mart Corp. \n849 F. Supp. 785, 787 (N.D. Ga. 1994); Berry v. Illinois Department of Human Services, 2001 WL \n111035 at *17 (N.D. Ill. February 2, 2001) (appended as Defendant’s Exhibit B); 7 C. Wright, A. \nMiller & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 1653, ns. 8, 9 (3d ed.). \n  In  order  to  satisfy  the  “same  transaction  or  occurrence”  requirement,  some  similarity \namong the plaintiffs in the factual background of their claims must be present.  Coughlin v. \nRogers, 130 F.3d 1348, 1350 (9th Cir. 1997) (an allegation of general delay in processing pending \nimmigration petitions does not suffice to create a common transaction or occurrence); Harris v. \nSpellman; 150 F.R.D. 130, 132 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (allegedly similar procedural errors occurring at \ndifferent times by different tribunals does not convert independent prison disciplinary hearings into \nthe same series of transactions or occurrences); Papagiannis v. Pontikis, 108 F.R.D. 177, 179 \n(N.D. Ill. 1985) (the fact that there were similarities in the methods used to commit fraud in \ndifferent transactions with plaintiffs does not satisfy Rule 20 so as to permit joinder of plaintiffs); \nSmith v. North American Rockwell Corp., 50 F.R.D. 515, 522-23 (N.D. Okla. 1970) (even an \nallegation that plaintiffs were subjected to discrimination under a general policy does not support \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 9 of 15 PageID #:1093\njoinder, because the court would have to consider how the alleged general policy affected each \nplaintiff  and  focus  in  detail  on  the  separate  histories  of  each  plaintiff); Lover  v.  District  of \nColumbia, 248 F.R.D.  319, 324-25 (D.D.C. 2008) (joinder of plaintiffs is not proper  where, \nalthough the claims levied against defendants are substantially the same for each plaintiff, factual \ndissimilarities exist in the events that gave rise to each plaintiff’s claims); Bailey v. Northern Trust \nCo., 196 F.R.D. 513, 515-17 (N.D. Ill. 2000) (plaintiffs could not properly join their employment \ndiscrimination claims because adverse employment actions taken against them were not a single \naction by defendant and a general claim of hostility toward African-American employees does not \ntransform separate decisions into the same transaction or occurrence); Rohlfing v. Cat’s Paw \nRubber Co., 99 F. Supp. 886, 894 (N.D. Ill. 1951) (plaintiffs, owners of shoe repair shops, are not \nproperly joined when their alleged antitrust claims against defendants are premised on individual \nfacts  arising  between  each  plaintiff  and  defendant).    Factors  that  have  been  considered  in \ndetermining whether discrimination claims arise from the same transaction, occurrence, or series \nof transactions or occurrences include the time period during which the alleged acts occurred, \nwhether the alleged acts of discrimination are related, and whether the plaintiff challenges an \nacross the board policy.  Berry v. Illinois Department of Human Services, 2001 WL 111035 at *17 \n(N.D. Ill. February 2, 2001).  (Defendant’s Exhibit B). \n  Here, a review of the factual allegations of the eight Plaintiffs proceeding under the Third \nAmended Complaint (Civil Docket at Doc. No. 54, ¶¶ 27(a)-92, 103-209), establishes that the \nalleged injury to each Plaintiff is premised on individual facts that exist between each Plaintiff and \nthe Defendant, and that the alleged injury could only have arisen from the unique circumstances of \nthe individual relationship with the Defendant.  The Court should apply the cases cited in the \npreceding paragraph to conclude that Plaintiffs Winfrey, Cale, Welter, Baron, Lytle, Stracka and \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 10 of 15 PageID #:1094\nStout have been misjoined and must be dismissed.  Admittedly, each Plaintiff is advancing the \nsame claims against Defendant, but under the cases cited on pages 8 and 9 of this memorandum, \npursuit  of  the  same  claims,  alone,  does  not  support  permissive  joinder  pursuant  to  Rule \n20(a)(1)(A).  Here, the times at which the alleged loss occurred to each Plaintiff are separate and \ndiscrete events.  The alleged disabilities, needs and strengths of each Plaintiff are unique so that \nthe question of whether an age limit in a program can or should be modified or waived turns on \nhighly individualized facts.  The viability of each Plaintiff’s claim against Defendant will involve \neach individual’s medical conditions and medical history.  Similarly, since the Plaintiffs’ claims \ninvolve  to  what  extent,  if  any,  a  modification  of  the  eligibility  requirements  of  Defendant’s \nprograms (including the age requirement) is reasonable, the facts that underlie the reasonableness \nanalysis  are  discrete,  unique  and  highly  individualized  for  each  Plaintiff.    Lastly,  under  the \nauthorities cited above, the fact that each Plaintiff claims to be challenging a “policy” does not \nsupport permissive joinder pursuant to Rule 20(a)(1)(A).   Accordingly, Plaintiffs fail to satisfy the \n“same transaction or occurrence” prong of Rule 20(a)(1)(A). \n    B.  No Question Of Law Or Fact Common To All Plaintiffs Will \n      Arise In This Action. \n \n  The Plaintiffs cannot meet the criteria set forth in Rule 20(a)(1)(B).  No question of law \nor fact common to all Plaintiffs will arise in this action.  The ADA at, Section 12132, provides in \npertinent part that “. . . no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, \nbe excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132. To \nestablish a violation of Title II of the ADA, the Plaintiff must show that 1) he is a qualified \nindividual with a disability, 2) he was excluded from participation in or otherwise discriminated \nagainst with regard to a public entity’s services, programs, or activities, and 3) such an exclusion \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 11 of 15 PageID #:1095\nwas by reason of his or her disability.  Sandison v. Michigan High School Athletic Ass’n., Inc., \n64 F.3d 1026, 1036 (6th Cir. 1995).  Under the law of the Seventh Circuit, the public entity’s \nfailure to grant a reasonable accommodation is a theory of liability separate from intentional \ndiscrimination.  Good Shepherd Manor Foundation, Inc. v. City of Momence, 323 F.3d 557, 561-\n62 (7th Cir. 2003); Wisconsin Community Services, Inc., v. City of Milwaukee, 465 F.3d 737, 753 \n(7th Cir. 2006).  In this Circuit, a plaintiff pursuing a reasonable accommodation claim under \nTitle II need not allege either disparate treatment or disparate impact.  Wisconsin Community \nServices, Id. \n  Turning, next, to Section 504, it provides in pertinent part that, “. . . [n]o otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . .”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \nTo establish a violation of Section 504, the Plaintiff must show that 1) he is handicapped within \nthe meaning of Section 504, 2) he is otherwise qualified for the benefit or services sought, 3) he \nwas denied the benefit solely by reason of his handicap, and 4) the program providing the benefit \nor services received federal financial assistance.  Plummer by Plummer v. Branstad, 731 F.2d \n574, 577 (8th Cir. 1984); Sandison, 64 F.3d at 1030-31. \n  In Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301-08 (1985), the Supreme Court held that \nmeaningful access to Medicaid services for the disabled did not restrict the State’s discretion \nunder federal Medicaid law to choose the proper amount, scope and duration limitations on \ncovered services.  The Court observed that Section 504 does not require the State to alter the \nbenefits offered under its Medicaid program simply to meet the reality that disabled persons have \ngreater medical needs because, to conclude otherwise, would be to find that the Rehabilitation \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 12 of 15 PageID #:1096\nAct requires that States view certain medical conditions as more important than others and more \nworthy  of  cure  through  government  subsidization.   Alexander,  469  U.S.  at  303-04.    Thus, \nTennessee’s limitation on hospital days covered by Medicaid did not offend Section 504 because \nthe denial of benefits, even when left unmodified, was not linked in any way to those plaintiffs’ \nparticular disabilities.  Accord: Frances J. by Murphy v. Bradley, 1992 WL 390875 at *7 (N.D. \nIll. 1992) vacated on other grounds 19 F.3d 337 (7th Cir. 1994) (appended as Defendant’s \nExhibit C). \nBoth the plain language of the ADA and Section 504, together with the purposes for \nwhich Congress enacted these statutes, make clear that each Plaintiff must establish whether he \nor she is a member of the group that Congress intended to benefit by proving whether he or she \nis a “qualified individual with a disability” or “otherwise qualified.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 \nU.S.C. § 794(a).  Those questions, in turn, include an analysis of whether each Plaintiff can meet \nthe  essential  eligibility  requirements  of  Defendant’s  program,  with  or  without  a  reasonable \nmodification.  Each Plaintiff, thus, must submit proof of his or her own unique circumstances as \npart of the claim, call different witnesses, and submit different documentary proof.  The court \nmust determine for each individual not only whether discrimination occurred, but also whether \nsuch discrimination was unlawful.  Cf. Hohider v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 574 F.3d 169, \n191-94 (3rd Cir. 2009). \n        Moreover, Defendant, here, was ready, willing and able to give individualized consideration \nof each Plaintiff’s needs for participation in a home and community-based services program for \nadults.  All factual and legal questions between the Plaintiffs and Defendant are based upon the \nwholly separate acts of Defendant with respect to each Plaintiff, and, there is a complete lack of \ncommon questions of law and fact.  See Grayson v. K-Mart Corp., 849 F. Supp. 785, 789 (N.D. \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 13 of 15 PageID #:1097\nGa. 1994).  See also Harris v. Spellman, 150 F.R.D. 130, 132 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (because a claim of \ndenial of procedural due process is in part a function of the severity of the loss to the plaintiff, the \nlegal issues raised by each plaintiff are not logically related in any way); Smith v. North American \nRockwell Corp., 50 F.R.D. 515, 524 (N.D. Okla. 1970) (the fact that each plaintiff is pursuing the \nsame theory of law against the defendant is not sufficient because the question whether a defendant \nunlawfully  discriminated  against  one  plaintiff  is  not  common  with  the  question  whether  a \ndefendant discriminated against another plaintiff); Grayson v. K-Mart Corp., 849 F. Supp. 785, \n789 (N.D. Ga. 1994) (no common questions of law or fact arise within the meaning of Rule 20 \nwhen the factual and legal questions between the plaintiffs and the defendant are based upon \nwholly separate acts of the defendant with respect to each plaintiff).    \n    C.  Assuming, Arguendo, That Plaintiffs Satisfy The Requirements  \n      For Permissive Joinder Set Forth In Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(1), The \n      Court Should Exercise Its Discretion To Refuse Joinder To Avoid \n      Prejudice To Defendant And Delay.   \n \n  Even if Plaintiffs can satisfy the Court that they have met the criteria for permissive joinder \nset forth in Rule 20(a)(1), the court has the discretion to refuse joinder in the interest of avoiding \nprejudice and delay.  Acevedo v. Allsup’s Convenience Stores, Inc., 600 F.3d 516, 521 (5th Cir. \n2010).  If permissive joinder were proper, the Court should refuse joinder in any event because the \nrepeated pattern of adding Plaintiffs to this lawsuit is likely to expand discovery and delay final \ndisposition of this case, to the detriment of Defendant.  First, when counsel crafted the Pretrial \nScheduling  Order,  counsel  for  Defendant  evaluated  the  likely  time  and  resource  needs  for \ndiscovery in light of the fact that three Plaintiffs were in the case.  The time for fact discovery \nunder the Pretrial Scheduling Order will close on January 31, 2011.  (Civil Docket at Doc. No. 51).  \nThe Third Amended Complaint on October 28, 2010 added five new Plaintiffs.  These new parties \nhave not made disclosures as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1) and there has, as yet, been no \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 14 of 15 PageID #:1098\ntime set in which to do so.  Discovery that Defendant is presently conducting is taking place with \nPlaintiffs Hampe, Winfrey and Cale. \n  Moreover, individuals participating in the MF/TD Waiver reach their 21st birthdays at \ndifferent times.  Defendant is aware of the identities of individuals who will attain the age of 21 \nbetween now and 2015.  In theory, Plaintiffs’ counsel can keep repeating the pattern of amending \nthe Complaint to add a new party, securing an agreed order to maintain the pre-21st birthday status \nquo, and indefinitely delaying final disposition of this case.  Indeed, once each Plaintiff reaches \nagreement with Defendant to maintain the status quo, he or she has no incentive to press this case \nto judgment. This is highly prejudicial to Defendant.  Also, prejudice is likely if an amended \ncomplaint contains new, complex and serious charges which would undoubtedly require additional \ndiscovery for defendant to rebut or require postponing resolution of the merits.  Ferguson v. \nRoberts, 11 F.3d 696, 706 (7th Cir. 1993).  Each new Plaintiff requires the Defendant to start the \ndiscovery process from scratch.  This is nothing more than seriatem presentation of facts and \nissues and, as such, prejudices the Defendant.  Parish v. Frazier, 195 F.3d 761, 764 (5th Cir. 1999). \n  Second, delaying a decision on the merits by the practice of adding a Plaintiff from time to \ntime requires Defendant to continue to pay medical assistance under the terms of the Agreed TROs \nwithout any end point.   \n  Finally, the failure to meet the criteria for permissive joinder dooms Plaintiff’s motion for \nclass certification.  Harris v. Spellman, 150 F.R.D. 130, 132, n.2 (N.D. Ill. 1993).  Since every \nclass action requires an identity of questions of law or fact common to the class plus a finding that \nthe claims of the representative parties are typical of the claims of the class, since Plaintiffs here \nthemselves raise disparate claims, the case clearly does not qualify for class certification.  Id.; see \nalso Robinson v. Gillespie, 219 F.R.D. 179 (D. Kan. 2003).   \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 64 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 15 of 15 PageID #:1099\nCONCLUSION \n  WHEREFORE,  for  the  foregoing  reasons,  Defendant  JULIE  HAMOS,  in  her  official \ncapacity as Director of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services prays that: \nA.

Hibler \nJULIE HAMOS, in her official capacity  ) \nas Director of the Illinois Department of  )  Magistrate: Arlander Keys \nHealthcare and Family Services,  ) \n) \nDefendant.  ) \nPLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nNow comes the Plaintiffs, by and through their attorney, Robert H. Farley, Jr., Ltd., and \nrequests that this Court pursuant to Rule 23 ofthe F.R.C.P. to certify a class of Plaintiffs.  In \nsupport ofthis motion, the Plaintiffs state as follows: \n1.  Plaintiffs seek certification of this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n2.  The Class consists ofthe following: \nAll persons who are enrolled or will be enrolled or were \nenrolled in the State of Illinois Medically Fragile, Technology \nDependent Medicaid Waiver Program (MF/TD) or Medicaid and \nwhen they obtain the age of21 years are subjected to reduce \nMedicaid funding which reduces the medical level of care which \nthey had been receiving prior to obtaining 21 years. \n3.  The Class is so numerous that joinder of all persons is impracticable.  As of September \n1, 2009, 504 children were receiving services in the MF/TD program on that specific date.  From \n1 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 12 Filed: 06/02/10 Page 2 of 5 PageID #:143\nJuly 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008, 606 children had received services in the MF/TD program.1 \n\"For the period of July 1, 2007 through [December, 2009], 37 individuals aged out of the \nwaiver. \"2  In Jones v. Mar am, 3 73 Ill.App.3d 184  Dist. 2007), Barbara Ginder from the \n(3rd \nState of Illinois stated in an affidavit \"there were 34 active cases of 18 to 20-year-old individuals, \n19 of whom were ventilator dependent\" in the MFTDC program. !d., at 192.  \"Ginder stated \nthese individuals are likely to transition from MF/TD to HSP [Home Services Program] (if they \nselect) at age 21.\" !d.  The class members have limited financial resources and are unlikely to \ninstitute individual actions. \n4.  The claims of the class members raise common questions oflaw and fact.  These \ninclude: \n(a)  Whether the Defendant  violated the ADA and Rehabilitation Act by reducing the \nlevel of funding for persons enrolled in the Illinois Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent \nMedicaid Waiver Program or Medicaid which resulted in a reduction of medical services. \n(b) Whether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act permits the Defendant to reduce the \nlevel of funding which results in a reduction of medical services for disabled persons after the \nage of 21, even though there has been no change in their medical needs. \n(c) Whether a fundamental alteration of the Illinois disability programs would occur if \nthe Defendant provided funding to continue the same level of services for the Plaintiff and the \nputative class when they tum the age of 21 years; \n1  Exhibit \"A\" at page 3, Section 1 -\"Report of Medicaid Services for Persons who are \nMedically Fragile, Technology Dependent- December, 2009.\" \n2  Exhibit \"A\" at page 9, Section 6. \n2 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 12 Filed: 06/02/10 Page 3 of 5 PageID #:144\n(d)  Whether compelling an increase in the \"exceptional care rate\" for persons exiting \nthe MF/TD program into the Illinois Home Services Program is unreasonable under the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act; and \n(e) Whether the Illinois disability programs can reasonable accommodate a \nmodification to their existing programs to allow the Plaintiff and putative class to continue to \nreceive the same level of care in the community when they tum 21 years of age. \nThe common questions of fact and law predominate over questions affecting only \nindividual class members. \n5.  The Plaintiff's claims is typical ofthe class members' claims. \n6.  The Plaintiff is an adequate representatives ofthe class because he suffers from \ndeprivations identical to those of the class members and has been denied the same federal rights \nthat he seeks to enforce on behalf of the other class members.  The Plaintiff will fairly and \nadequately represent the interests of the other class members, many ofwhom are unable to \npursue claims on their own behalf as the result of their disabilities.  Plaintiff's interest in \nobtaining injunctive relief for the violations of constitutional rights and privileges are consistent \nwith and not antagonistic to those of any person within the class.  Plaintiff's counsel is qualified, \nexperienced and able to conduct the proposed litigation. \n7.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of the controversy in that: \n(i) A multiplicity of suits with consequent burden on the courts and defendants \nshould be avoided. \n(ii) It would be virtually impossible for all class members to intervene as parties-\n3 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 12 Filed: 06/02/10 Page 4 of 5 PageID #:145\nplaintiffs in this action. \n8.  This matter is brought as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure because the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \ngenerally applicable to the class, making appropriate final injunctive relief.  The prosecution of \nseparate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent or varying \nadjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would establish \nincompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class. \nWherefore, the Plaintiffs request that this Court enter an order certifying this action as a \nclass action under Rule 23(b )(2). \nRespectfully submitted, \nIs/ Robert H  Farley, Jr. \nAttorney for Plaintiff \nRobert H.

Lytle, Jacob Stracka, by and through\nhis parents/guardians David Stracka and Nicole Stracka, and Charles Stout, on their own behalf\nand a class of others similarly situated, and Defendant Julie Hamos, in her official capacity as\nDirector of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, hereby file this Consent\nDecree to resolve the claims raised in the Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint for Declaratory\nand Injunctive Relief, alleging violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42\n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 240 Filed: 10/03/13 Page 2 of 10 PageID #:3122\nU.S.C. $ 12132,28 C.F.R. $ 35.130), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. $ 794(a),\n28.C.F.R. $ 41.51), and42 U.S.C. $ 1983.\n2. \nThe Plaintiffs are individuals with disabilities who, at the time this action was\ninitiated, were eligible for Medicaid under Title XIX of the Social Security Act pursuant to a\nfederally-approved  Home and Community Based Services Waiver for Medically Fragile and\nTechnology Dependent Children (MF/TD Waiver) for children under 2l years of age, and who,\nupon attaining 2l years of age, were no longer eligible for the MF/TD Waiver and were\nallegedly subjected to reduced Medicaid funding.\n3. \nThe Defendant is the Director of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family\nServices, which is the agency responsible for overseeing and implementing Illinois' Medical\nAssistance or Medicaid program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. $ 1396(aX5).\n4. \nThe Plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that when individuals attain2l years of age, they\nage out of the MF/TD Waiver and into a different waiver program that provides substantially less\nfunding. The Plaintiffs allege that without the funding provided by the MF/TD Waiver program,\nthey will have to be institutionalized or hospitalized to provide for their medical needs. The\nPlaintiffs allege that the Defendant's policy violates Title II of the Americans with Disabilities\nAct,42 U.S.C. T2132, and the Rehabilitation Act, 29U.5.C.794.\n5. \nBy Order dated November 22,2010, the Court certified this case to proceed as a\nclass action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on\nbehalf of \"[a]ll persons who are enrolled or will be enrolled or were enrolled in the State of\nIllinois' Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent Medicaid Waiver Program (MF/TD) and\nwhen they obtain the age of 21 years are subjected to reduced Medicaid funding which reduces\nthe medical level of care which they had been receiving prior to obtaining2l years.\"\n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 240 Filed: 10/03/13 Page 3 of 10 PageID #:3123\n6. \nThe Defendant denies the allegations of the Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint\nfor Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and further denies any violations of statutes or regulations.\nThe Defendant makes no admission of liability, and nothing herein shall be deemed an admission\nof fault of any kind by Defendant.\n7. \nThe parties have stated their desire to resolve this matter amicably and without\ngoing to trial.\n8. \nThe parties agree that this Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this\ncase pursuant to 28 U.S.C. $ 1331 and 28 U.S.C. $ 1345.\n9. \nThe parties agree that the issue in this case is limited to individuals who age out of\nthe MF/TD waiver program upon attaining 2l years of age and are no longer eligible for the\nMF/TD waiver program. The parties further agree that the MF/TD Waiver program and\neligibility for the MF/TD waiver program for those who have not yet attained the age of 21 years\nis not the subject of this litigation and that any actions taken by Defendant with respect to the\nMF/TD waiver program and eligibility for the MF/TD waiver program are not material to this\naction. Nothing in this Consent Decree is intended to prevent or direct any changes to the\nMF/TD Waiver program for persons prior to the date they attain the age of 21 years.\n10. \nThis Consent Decree shall not override or supersede any requirements or\nrestrictions established by Title XIX, federal law, federal regulation, state law, state regulation,\nor the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), including the extent to which\nany procedure and/or covered service available under this Consent Decree may require or be\nsubject to federal approval by federal CMS in accordance with Title XIX. Any service covered\npursuant to this Consent Decree must be eligible for Federal Financial Participation. The terms\nof this Consent Decree shall not require the Defendant to cover or fund any services that the\n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 240 Filed: 10/03/13 Page 4 of 10 PageID #:3124\nindividual did not receive, or for which the individual was not eligible, prior to attaining 2l years\nof age. The terms of this Consent Decree shall not require the Defendant to cover Class Members\nunder any specific program, including but not limited to the Home Services Program as it exists\nat the time this Consent Decree is entered, or federal financing mechanism. Defendant shall have\nthe flexibility to work with the federal government to determine the most appropriate financing\nmechanism.\n1. \nI  HFS may establish eligibility and/or resource allocation requirements, standards\nand limitations. HFS will utilize a standardized assessment tool(s) that objectively determines\nmedical necessity, level of services, and resource allocation requirements, standards or\nlimitations for class members. HFS will utilize a person-centered approach.\n12. \nA class member's need, level and amount of medical services will be based upon\nmedical necessity, not the chronological age of the class member. The tool will allocate\nresources based on medical need and allow the class member the option to choose federally\napproved services including but not limited to licensed nursing and/or personal attendant\nservices.\n13. \nService plans and assessments will be based upon the individual's support system\nin addition to the medical needs. The service plans will address the numbers and levels of\nservice hours-including back-up plans, emergency plans, and training of caregivers. If the\nmedical needs allow for self-direction, service plans will give participants the opportunity to\nchoose self-directed  models of care conceivably allowing more service hours.\n14. \nEmergency room and hospitalizations will be monitored and if there are frequent\nEmergency Room visits or hospitalizations, the service plan, including nursing services or care\ncoordination, may be adjusted temporarily to attempt to reduce Emergency Room visits and\n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 240 Filed: 10/03/13 Page 5 of 10 PageID #:3125\nhospitalizations.\n15. \nExcept as described in Paragraph23, service plans will be reviewed annually and\nmay be reviewed in interim periods if necessary to address changes in needs, stability, risk\nfactors, or other circumstances found through case management.\n16. \nAny changes in medical services and service plans will be discussed with the\nindividual and family prior to implementation.\n17. \nSince services will be based on medical necessity, where indicated through\nassessment, service will be gradually reduced through titration. In these instances, individuals\nwill be closely monitored to assure their medical needs are not compromised.\n18.  Medical case management will be available beyond age 2l for continuity of care\nupon transition from children to adult services.\n19.  The level of case management will be determined by an HFS approved\nassessment and will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Higher levels of case management will\nprovide support for families, with more assistance to families with greater needs, linkage to\nservices, and availability for trouble shooting and problem solving. Higher levels of case\nmanagement will also include promptly identifying and acting on changes in medical conditions\nto determine the need for any temporary increase in hours.\n20. \nAny changes in case management will be discussed with the individual and family\nprior to implementation.\n21.  HFS, or any successor agency, may make medical necessity, or resource\ndeterminations, and/or establish utilization control procedures through the use of Quality\nImprovement Organrzations. HFS shall retain the authority to establish eligibility criteria,\nmedical necessity criteria and cost sharing as permitted by Title XIX and, where applicable,\n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 240 Filed: 10/03/13 Page 6 of 10 PageID #:3126\napproved by federal CMS. HFS may require class members to enroll with a managed care entity\nor other form of care coordination  entity for any or all care coordination, case management\nand/or services delivered and nothing in this Consent Decree shall prohibit the Defendant, HFS\nor any successor agency from using care coordination entities or managed care entities as\nauthorized under Title XIX.\n22. \nUpon entry of the Consent Decree, any Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) or\nPreliminary Injunction shall be dissolved by the Court. In the time frame described in paragraph\n23, HFS shall review the level of services identified in any TRO or Preliminary Injunction\nthrough the completion of an assessment and establishment of a new service plan via the level of\ncare tool described herein. HFS will agree to maintain the level of services identified in any\nTRO or Preliminary Injunction until the completion of an assessment and establishment of a new\nservice plan.\n23. \nClass members will be initially assessed as follows:\na. \nat 6 months prior to turning 21 years of age;\nb.  within 120 days from the date of the Consent Decree for any class\nmembers with a TRO or preliminary injunction in place;\nc. \nwithin 120 days of a request for individuals who were served under the\nMF/TD Waiver and who have turned 2l years old and who do not have a\nTRO in place.\n24. \nClass members who are dissatisfied with any service planning issue shall have the\nright to appeal under the administrative processes set forth at 89 Ill. Admin. Code Sections 104.1\n- 104.80.\n25. \nNothing in this Consent Decree shall operate to limit any individual's freedom of\n6\n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 240 Filed: 10/03/13 Page 7 of 10 PageID #:3127\nchoice as required by Title XIX of the Social Security Act and, to the extent any class member\nchooses to participate in any other home and community-based  services program, which may be\noperated pursuant to a federal Title XIX waiver, the terms of this Consent Decree shall not apply\nand shall not require the alteration or modification of the program chosen by the individual.\n26.  This Consent Decree is based on existing State and Federal law. If either party\nbelieves a change in State or Federal law impacts the terms of the Decree, it shall notify the other\nparty and attempt to negotiate a resolution. If negotiation is unsuccessful, after 45 days, the issue\nmay be presented to the Court for resolution. Until such time as there is a negotiated or court-\nimposed resolution, both parties will continue to abide by the terms of the Consent Decree.\n. \n27  This Consent Decree shall be in effect for three years from the date of entry. The\nCourt shall retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the Consent Decree during its duration,\nafter which time the case shall be dismissed with prejudice.\n28. \nDefendant shall provide to Plaintiffs' counsel, upon a reasonable request and\nwithin a reasonable time frame, identifying information as to the Class Members. All\ninformation provided to the Plaintiffs' counsel shall be considered confidential in accordance\nwith the terms of the Agreed Protective Order, entered in this case on September 27,2010 (Civil\nDocket Document No. 53), which shall continue apply to any such disclosure of confidential\ninformation to the Plaintiff s counsel.\n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 240 Filed: 10/03/13 Page 8 of 10 PageID #:3128\n29. \nWithin 90 days of the date of entry of this Consent Decree, the Defendant shall\npay to Plaintiffs' counsel the sum of $525,000 (Five Hundred Twenty-Five  Thousand Dollars),\nin settlement of all claims by Plaintiffs or their attorneys for attorneys' fees and litigation costs.\ndoL/-.'\nrt \nSo ordered thisflta aur \nStates District Judge\nISTGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWSI\n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 240 Filed: 10/03/13 Page 9 of 10 PageID #:3129\nEacH UNpSRSTGNED  Pe,nry enters into this Consent Decreo in the matter of Hampev\"\nHamos, Case No, 10-3121, pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District\nof Iilinois, Eastem Division.\nFoRrnr Plamnrr Cuss:\nn\"t\", b/nf t?\nSEL: /r\nF'oR Dsrui{peNT, DlnscroR oF\nIurnors Drpnnrnarnr or\nHr,lr,rnc.a.nr axo FEurr,Y\nSeRvrcps:\nDate:\nAs ArronNBY FoR DEFENTTaNT:\nDate:\n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 240 Filed: 10/03/13 Page 10 of 10 PageID #:3130\nEncu UNoenstcNru PlRrv enters into this Consent Decree in the matter of Hampe v.\nHamos, Case No. 10-3121, pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District\nof lllinois, Eastem Division.\nFonrsB PlnlnnrrCLAss:\nDate:\nFon Cuass Counsrl:\nDate:\nFon DprsxDANT, Dlnsc'roR or\nIuunols DEPARTMENToF\nHslrrHcaRr  Feurly\nAND \nSnnvtcss:\nAs ATToRNEY roR DurrnnexT:\n9",

The DHFS restricts enrollment in the MF/TD \nProgram to persons under the age of 21, and according to the Plaintiffs, when they age out of the \nprogram they transition into a different program that provides substantially less funding.  The Plaintiffs \nallege that without the funding provided by the MF/TD Program, they will have to be institutionalized \nor hospitalized to provide for their medical needs. The Plaintiffs claim that Defendant's policy violates \n1 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 75 Filed: 11/22/10 Page 2 of 11 PageID #:1321\nTitle II ofthe Ameicans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \n§ 794. Plaintiffs seek to certify a class ofp ersons similarly situated to themselves to pursue their claims. \nI.  Background \nMedicaid provides medical assistance to both to disabled individuals and to families with \ndependent children whose income and resources are otherwise insufficient to pay for the cost of the \nmedical care that they require, and is jointly funded by both the federal government and the states that \nchoose to participate.  42 U.S.C. § 1396; 305 ILCS 5/5-1.  States that participate in the Medicaid \nprogram must submit a plan outlining the services it will provide in its Medicaid program to the United \nStates Secretary ofHealth and Human Services (HHS).  42 U.S.C. § 1396a. In addition to the services \nprovided for under their Medicaid plans, states may request HHS approval to provide home and \ncommunity-based services (HCB) to individuals who would otherwise require institutional care.  The \nSecretary has the authority to waive certain Medicaid requirements in order for states to offer such \nservices.  42 U.S.C.  § 1396n(b)-(h); 42 C.F.R. § 430.25(d).  Specifically, the Secretary may issue \nwaivers to allow a state to provide HCB services only to individuals who would otherwise require \ninstitutionalization (rather than to every citizen who is eligible for Medicaid), provided that the average \ncost per-person of services offered under the waiver authority is cost-neutral (i.e., the average cost of \nHCB services does not exceed the cost of providing care in an institution).  42 U.S.C.§§ 1396n(c)(l), \n1396n(c)(2)(d); 42 C.F.R. § 441.302(e). \nIllinois has sought and received a waiver for its Medically Fragile/Technology Dependent \nChildren Program, which provides HCB  services and medical equipment to children who would \notherwise require institutional care.  89 Ill. Admin. Code § 120.530.  Among other requirements, the \nMFl TD Program requires a determination that recipients would require the level of care provided by a \n2 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 75 Filed: 11/22/10 Page 3 of 11 PageID #:1322\nhospital or skilled nursing facility unless they received HCB services. 89 Ill. Admin Code§ 120.530(b) . \nThe MF lTD Program provides funding only for persons who are under 21 years of age.  89 Ill. Admin. \nCode § 120.530(a).  After reaching the age of 21, individuals in the MF/TD Program transition to \nanother Medicaid waiver program, the Home Services Program (HSP).  89 Ill. Admin. Code § 676.10. \nThe HSP, however, contains funding caps that restrict the amount of assistance individuals can receive. \n89 Ill. Admin. Code § 679.50. \nOne of the named Plaintiffs, William Hampe, has been diagnosed with reactive airway disease, \ncerebral palsy, intractable epilepsy, developmental delay, and microcephaly. He requires a ventilatory \nsupport system, frequent suctioning of his tracheostomy, and receives his nutrition from a j-tube. \nHampe currently receives funding for 16 hours a day of skilled nursing care in his home under the \nMF/TD Program.  Hampe's physician states that without medical home care, Hampe would require \ninpatient hospitalization, which would separate and isolate him from his mother and community.1  As \nHampe approached his 21st birthday, the Defendant notified him that he would transition to the HSP \nand would be eligible for $9,429 per month for medical care in his home,  under the Program's \n\"exceptional care rate.\" This funding would allow Hampe to receive approximately one-halfthe amount \nof skilled nursing care that he currently receives. \nThe ADA prohibits discrimination against disabled persons by public entities.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 12132. The regulations implementing the ADA provide that public entities \"shall administer services, \nprograms, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals \nwith disabilities.\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  The Rehabilitation Act contains similar anti-discrimination \n1 Allegedly, hospitalization would also cost approximately three times as much as the in \nhome skilled nursing care that Hampe currently receives. \n3 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 75 Filed: 11/22/10 Page 4 of 11 PageID #:1323\nand integration provisions.  29 U.S.C. § 794(a) & 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d).  The Supreme Court has held \nthat these regulations prohibit the \"unjustified institutional isolation\" ofd isabled individuals. Olmstead \nv. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 599-601, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999).  In Olmstead, the Supreme \nCourt held that public entities must provide community based treatment to qualified individuals with \ndisabilities, provided that the placement can be reasonably accommodated. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607; \nsee also 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) (allowing states to resist modifications that entail a fundamental \nalteration of the States' services and programs). The Plaintiffs' claims flow from the Supreme Court's \nholding in Olmstead. \nII.  Class Certification Standard \nIn order to certify a class action, a court must first find that each element ofFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) \n-numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation-is satisfied. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a); Siegel v. Shell Oil Co., 612 F.3d 932,935 (7th Cir. 2010); Harper v. SheriffofCook Cnty, 581 \nF .3d 511, 513 (7th Cir. 2009). Once a court finds that the requirements of Rule 23(a) are met, the court \nmust also find that the putative class meets one of the three categories of class actions set forth in Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(b); Siegel, 612 F.3d at 935; Harper, 581 F.3d at 513.  In this case, the Plaintiffs pursue \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief and seek certification under Rule 23(b )(2), which permits certification \nift he defendant has \"acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making \nappropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); see also Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 797-99 (7th Cir. 2008); Rahman \nv. Cherto.IJ, 530 F.3d 622,626 (7th Cir. 2008);Allen v. Int'l Truck and Engine Corp., 358 F.3d469, 470 \n(7th Cir. 2004). \nIII.  Analysis \n4 \n--------------------\n---\n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 75 Filed: 11/22/10 Page 5 of 11 PageID #:1324\nA.  Numerosity \nRule 23(a)(l) requires that the proposed class be so numerous that joinder of all persons is \nimpracticable.  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  23(a)(l).  There is no threshold at which joinder becomes per se \nimpracticable.  George v. Kraft Foods Global, Inc., No. 08 C 3799,2010 WL 3386402, at *7 (N.D. Ill. \nAug. 25, 201 0).  Generally, a class of forty plaintiffs is sufficiently numerous for Rule 23(a) purposes. \n!d.; Swanson v. Am. Consumer Indus., 415 F.2d 1326, 1333 (7th Cir. 1969). \nThe Plaintiffs point to a December 2009 DHFS report that indicates that 504 individuals were \nenrolled in the MF lTD Program as of September 1, 2009 and 606 individuals received services between \nJuly 1, 2007 and June 30,2008. The report further indicates that 37 individuals aged out of the MFITD \nProgram between July 2007 and December 2009.  The Plaintiffs also point to an affidavit of a DHFS \nofficial stating that 34 cases of 18 to 20 year old individuals received services pursuant to the MF lTD \nProgram as of October 2005.2 Given that the Plaintiffs have put forward evidence to suggest that at two \nrecent points in time, 34-37 individuals would age out of the MFITD Program in a two-year period and \nthat over 500 individuals receive services pursuant to the MF lTD Program, the Court finds that the class \nis sufficiently numerous that joinder would be impracticable. \nB.  Commonality \nA common nucleus of operative fact is usually sufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement \nofRule 23(a)(2). Keele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir. 1998). Where a defendant has engaged \n2 The Defendantsuggests that it has been \"unable to locate\" this document in the \nPlaintiffs' filings.  The Defendant also implies that the affidavit is not sufficiently precise.  These \narguments are curious, given that in their brief the Plaintiffs cite Jones v. Maram, 373 Ill. App. 3d \n184 (Ill. pp. Ct. 2007) as the source of the affidavit.  Defendant submitted the affidavit in Jones in \nsupport of its arguments in that case.  Having relied on the affidavit in prior litigation, \nDefendant's attempt to call into question both the existence of and the precision ofthe affidavit is \ninsincere, at best.  Defendant does itself no favors in disavowing or impugning such evidence. \n5 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 75 Filed: 11/22/10 Page 6 of 11 PageID #:1325\nin standardized conduct towards members of the proposed class that standardized conduct is sufficient \nto provide a common nucleus of operative fact. !d.  Here, Defendant's conduct in limiting participation \nin the MF lTD Program to individuals under the age of 21 and requiring individuals receiving services \nunder the MF lTD Program to apply for benefits under the HSP when they tum 21  constitutes a \n\"common nucleus of operative fact.\" The Defendant makes no determination ofa n individual's medical \nneeds when it finds that an individual is no longer eligible to receive services under the MF lTD Program \nand instead makes that determination based solely on the fact that the individual has reached the age of \n21.  The named Plaintiffs may have different medical needs and require different HCB services, but \nthese individual differences are not sufficient to bar class certification. Although the effect ofDHFS 's \nconduct on each class member may differ, the allegation that its discriminatory policy or practice affects \nthe class as a hole is sufficient to demonstrate commonality.  See Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, \n101 7 (7th Cir.  1992). The Plaintiffs'  alleged injuries flow from  the  same discriminatory act -\nDefendant's limitation of participation in the MFITD Program to individuals under the age of21. \nThe Defendant argues that a threshold statutory issue-whether the prospective class members \nare qualified individuals within the meaning ofthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act-poses individualized \nquestions that require individualized fact-finding.  In support, DHFS relies primarily on the Third \nCircuit's holding in Hohider v.  United Parcel Serv.,  Inc., 574 F.3d 169 (3rd Cir. 2009).  Hohider \nreasons that because the statutory language of the ADA limits the protection of the statute to \"qualified \nindividuals\" that a court must ensure that class members are in fact qualified prior to a classwide \ndetermination that the defendant engaged in discriminatory conduct. \nDefendant's argument is a red herring.  The Defendant is correct that the ADA prohibits \ndiscrimination only against qualified individuals with disabilities. Putting aside the question ofw  hether \n6 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 75 Filed: 11/22/10 Page 7 of 11 PageID #:1326\nHohider's reasoning is persuasive, the Court is not convinced that even if the court were to conduct an \nindividualized inquiry into whether class members were qualified individuals that such an inquiry would \n\"negate the very benefits Rule 23\" confers.  Def. Resp. at 13.3 \nThe statute defines qualified individuals as disabled individuals who \"with or without reasonable \nmodifications to rules, policies, or practices ... mee[t] the essential eligibility requirements for the \nreceipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.\" 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12131 (2).  The proposed class definition, however, includes only persons who are receiving or have \nor will receive services under the MF lTD Program. In that sense, the prospective class members' receipt \nof services under the MF lTD Program demonstrates that he or she meets the essential eligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of services or participation in the MFl TD Program because to participate \nin the MF lTD Program the Defendant must determine that recipients would require the level of care \nprovided by a hospital or skilled nursing facility unless they received HCB services. See Radaszewski \nv. Maram, 383 F.3d 599, 612-613 (7th Cir. 2004) (discussing whether similar disabled individual was \na \"qualified individual\").  Because the Defendant has already made a threshold determination that the \nprospective class members are qualified to receive services under the MF lTD Program and because the \nDefendant's decision to exclude the prospective class members from that Program is based not on a \nchange in their medical condition but on a change in their age, the Court concludes that any inquiry into \nwhether the class members are \"qualified individuals\" is likely to be minimally taxing. \n3 In this vein, much ofDefendant's argument seems to suggest that it argues that although \nthere are common issues, they do not predominate.  Indeed, Defendant earlier argues that \n\"claiming that an issue predominates does not make it so.\"  Def. Resp. at 13.  Of course, whether \nthe common issues predominate over individualized issues is a question for plaintiffs who seek \ncertification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) and not those who seek certification under 23(b)(2). \n7 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 75 Filed: 11/22/10 Page 8 of 11 PageID #:1327\nCommon questions-for example, whether Defendant's policy oftransitioning individuals from \nthe MFITD Program to the HSP and thereby reducing their medicaid benefits violates the ADA, or \nwhether requiring the Defendant to allow individuals in the MF lTD to continue to receive the same level \nof benefits after their 21st birthday that they received prior to their 21st birthday is a reasonable \naccommodation-clearly exist. The Court therefore finds that there are common issues oflaw and fact. \nC.  Typicality \nThe question of typicality is closely related to the question of commonality. Rosario, 963 F.2d \nat 1018.  Typicality can be satisfied even where there are factual distinctions between the named \nplaintiffs claim and the claims of other class members. Muro v. Target Corp., 580 F.3d 485,492 (7th \nCir. 2009).  The requirement directs the court to focus on whether the named representative's claims \nhave the same essential characteristics as the claims ofthe class at large.  !d.  A claim is typical '\"if it \narises from the same event or practice or course of conduct\"' that gives rise to the other class members' \nclaims.  Retired Chicago Police Ass 'n v. City ofC  hicago, 7 F.3d 584, 597 (7th Cir. 1993) (quoting H. \nNewberg, CLASS ACTIONS§ 1115(b) at 185 (1977)).  Here, Hampe's claims are typical ofthose of \nthe class-he receives HCB services under the MF lTD Program and when he turns 21, the DHFS will \nboot him from that Program and transition him to the HSP, which in tum, will result in a reduction of \nhis funding for HCB services.  The proposed class includes other individuals who will receive, are \nreceiving or have received services under the MF lTD Program who will be subject to a reduction in \nMedicaid funding once they reach the age of 21.  The Defendant raises the same red herring it raises in \nresponse to the Plaintiffs' argument on commonality, which remain unconvincing.  The Court finds that \nHampe's claims are typical ofthe claims ofthe proposed class. \nD.  Adequacy ofR  epresentation \n8 \n\n. \n'  Case: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 75 Filed: 11/22/10 Page 9 of 11 PageID #:1328\nCourts make a two-part inquiry into the adequacy of representation for the purposes of class \ncertification.  First, courts examine whether the class representative can fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class.  Second, courts ask whether counsel is able to prosecute the action.  Retired \nChicago Police Ass 'n, 7 F .3d at 598.  A named representative cannot fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests ofthe class ifhe has interests antagonistic to that class or if he lacks a sufficient interest in the \noutcome of the litigation.  !d. \nDefendant raises an argument bordering on frivolous.  Defendant suggests that because some \nmembers of the prospective class lack standing, have moot claims, have time-barred claims, or are not \n\"qualified individuals\" that Hampe's interests are antagonistic to the class.4  Even if the Court were to \naccept the Defendant's underlying premises (which as noted below it does not), it does not follow that \nHampe's interests are antagonistic to prospective class members who lack standing or had mooted or \ntime-barred claims.  Hampe's injury arises from the same the same alleged violation of federal law as \nthe other proposed class members and he clearly has an interest in obtaining the injunctive relief. \nDefendant makes no argument that counsel is not qualified to prosecute the interest of the class.  The \n4 Most ofDefendant's underlying premise is itself without merit.  Defendant suggests that \nsome plaintiffs claims may be moot because they accepted funding under the HSP.  But merely \nbecause an individual has submitted to the allegedly discriminatory conduct does not undo that \ndiscrimination.  An employer who demoted an employee because of his race or gender could not \nargue that the employee's discrimination claim was \"moot\" because the employee accepted the \ndemotion rather than quit.  Defendant also suggests that some plaintiffs lack standing because \ntheir claims are not yet ripe because they are not nearing their 21st birthday.  But that does not \nmake the injury abstract or hypothetical.  Individuals in the MF/TD Program face an inexorable \nmarch towards transition and exclusion from that Program.  Defendants further suggest that some \nprospective class members claims are time-barred because they have already aged out of the \nMF/TD Program.  Because the prospective class members' exclusion from the MF/TD Program is \nongoing, their claims would not be time-barred.  Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, \n380-81, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982). \n9 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 75 Filed: 11/22/10 Page 10 of 11 PageID #:1329\nCourt finds that Hampe is an adequate class representative and that counsel can adequately protect the \ninterests of the class. \nE.  Rule 23(b)(2) \nPlaintiffs seek certification under Fed R. Civ. P. 23(b )(2), which requires that \"plaintiffs ... need \nmerely show that defendants acted on grounds generally applicable to the class for which they seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); Pella Corp. v. Saltzman, 606 F.3d 391,392 \n(7th Cir. 2010).  Although certification under Rule  23(b)(2) is not automatic merely because the \nplaintiffs seek only declaratory and injunctive relief, it is an appropriate device to remedy a state policy \nthat treats the prospective class uniformly and presents common questions of law and fact.  See, e.g. \nJefferson v.  Ingersoll Int 'l Inc.,  195 F .3d 894, 897-99 (7th Cir.  1999) (discussing the use of Rule \n23(b)(2) class actions to prosecute Title VII claims before Title VII allowed compensatory and punitive \ndamages); Bishop v. Gainer, 272 F .3d 1009 (7th Cir. 2001) (involving 23(b )(2) class seeking declaratory \nand injunctive relief concerning Illinois  State Police hiring practices).  Defendants make no real \nargument that certification is not appropriate under Rule 23(b )(2), instead suggesting merely that it is \nnot automatic. \nHere, the proposed class seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief concerning Defendant's \npolicy oftransitioning individuals receiving services in the MF lTD Program to the HSP when they reach \nthe age of21.  The Defendant's conduct towards the entire proposed class is identical- individuals \nage-out of the MF lTD Program regardless of their medical needs and instead based solely on their age. \nMoreover, Defendant has refused to modify this policy and practice despite the fact that other individual \nplaintiffs have successfully challenged the policy in five separate lawsuits. Certification ofthe proposed \nclass advances the Court's interest in judicial economy because it avoids the strain of repetitive, \n10 \n\nCase: 1:10-cv-03121 Document #: 75 Filed: 11/22/10 Page 11 of 11 PageID #:1330\nidentical lawsuits, thus economizing the expense of litigation over the common issue of whether \nDefendant's policy to transition individuals from the MF lTD Program to the HSP at the age of 21 \nviolates the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. \nThe Court finds that the proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b )(2). \nF.  Adequacy of the Class Definition \nFinally, Defendant raises arguments that the proposed class is vague and indefinite. The Court \nhas disposed of many ofDefendant's arguments in its analysis of the Rule 23 requirements, and need \nnot repeat that analysis.  With regard to any remaining arguments, the Defendant raised similar \narguments in Colbert v. Blagojevich, No. 07 C 4737, 2008 WL 4442597, at **2-4 (N.D. Ill. Sep. 29, \n2008).  Colbert rejected those arguments, and the Court finds that reasoning persuasive and adopts it \nhere. \nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the Plaintiffs' Motion to Certify a \nClass and certifies a class as follows: \nAll persons who are enrolled or will be enrolled or were enrolled in the State of Illinois' \nMedically Fragile, Technology Dependent Medicaid Waiver Program (MF/TD) and when they \nobtain the age of21 years are subjected to reduced Medicaid funding which reduces the medical \nlevel of care which they had been receiving prior to obtaining 21 years. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nI \nDated \n11 ",
