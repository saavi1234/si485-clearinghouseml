BOB RAJCOOMAR\nand DOROTHY RAJCOOMAR,\nPlaintiffs, CASENO:\nv.\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nTRANSPORTATION SECURITY\nADMINISTRATION, SHAWN\nMcCULLERS and SAMMUMMA,\nagents ofthe Transportation Security\nAdministration sued in their individual\ncapacities\nDefendants.\nCOMPLAINT\nJurisdiction\n1. This action is brought pursuant to Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2671, and\nthe Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution, 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331\nand 1346(b).\n2. On September 18, 2002, Plaintiffs submitted an Administrative Claim for\nthe claim set forth below to the Transportation SecurityAdministration, formerly part of\nthe Department ofTransportation and now part ofthe Department ofHomeland Security\n(\"TSA\").\n3. Six months having elapsed, all conditions precedent to a Federal Tort\n\nClaims Acthave been met.\n4. Venue is properly within this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1402(b)\nas the acts complained ofoccurred in the Eastern District ofPennsylvania.\nParties\n5. Plaintiffs are residents ofPalm Beach County, Florida.\n6. Both the United States ofAmerica and its Transportation Security\nAdministration are appropriate defendants under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n7. Defendants Shawn McCullers and Sam Mumma are TSA agents and are\nsued in their individual capacities.\nFacts\n8. On August 31, 2002, Dr. Rajcoomar and his wife, Dorothy, traveled on\nDelta Airline Flight 442, from Atlanta to Philadelphia.\n9. During that flight, Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in Row ID. Mrs. Rajcoomar\nwas seated further back.\n10. Approximately 30 minutes before the plane landed, TSA agents\nMcCullers and Mumma responded to a passenger's disturbance in coach class.\n11. Dr. Rajcoomar, having not left his seat since the plane's departure from\nAtlanta, was unaware ofthe nature ofthe disturbance.\n12. He was made aware both ofthe disturbance and the TSA agents' presence\non that flight when the agents utilized the seat next to him in orderto restrain the\npassenger from the rear ofthe plane. Not wishing to remain seated next to the restrained\n\nindividual, Dr. Rajcoomar requested and received from flight attendants a change ofseat.\nAs a result, he was relocated to a seat which had been vacated by one ofthe agents.\n13. During the next 30 minutes, the TSA agents trained their firearms on the\npassengers while threatening all ofthe passengers with bodily injury should they so much\nas move. Dr. Rajcoomar complied with all ofthe agents' directions.\n.\n14. Dr. Rajcoomar, Mrs. Rajcoomar, and, on information and belief, the rest of\nthe passengers on Flight 442 experienced terror caused by the extreme and unwarranted\nconduct ofthe TSA agents.\n15. Upon arriving at the gate ofthe Philadelphia airport, Dr. Rajcoomar\nremained seated while the TSA agents removed the individual who had been involved in\nthe disturbance.\n16. At that point, Dr. Rajcoomar assumed he would be permitted to disembark.\nYet before he was evenpermitted to rise, he was instructed, without any ~urther\nexplanation, by one ofthe TSA agents to lean forward and place his hands on his head.\nNotwithstanding the fact that he began to comply with this request, one ofthe TSA\nagents pushed him forward. As soon as his hands were on his head, he was handcuffed\n(causing the breaking ofhis wrist watch), and immediately thereaftertaken offthe plane.\n17. Dr. Rajcoomar was then led roughly down to the tarmac where he was\nforced to endure the cursing ofPhiladelphia police officers before being placed in a\npolice van. Prior to being placed in the van, he asked for, yet received absolutely no\nexplanation from either the TSA agents or Philadelphia police as to why he was being\n\ntreated in such fashion.\n18. Transported to a Philadelphia police station, Dr. Rajcoomar was booked;\nhis personal possessions such as wallet, briefcase (both ofwhich were completely\nsearched without his consent), and cell phone were taken from him. He was then\ndeposited in a foul-smelling cell where he remained for the next four hours. During that\ntime, he again repeatedly asked for an explanation as to why he was being detained. The\nonly explanation everprovided by the TSA agents consisted ofthe following two\nstatements:\n(i) \"We didn't like the way you look,\" and\n(ii) \"We didn't like the way you looked at us.\"\n19. Neither ofthese assertions could provide legaljustification for Dr.\nRajcoomar's arrest and detention.\n20. A TSA spokesperson quoted by the Philadelphia Inquirer essentially\nconfirmed this second assertion, stating that Dr. Rajcoomar \"had been observing too\nclosely.\" See \"Profiling charged on 'nightmare' flight,\" September 19, 2002.\n21. Dr. Rajcoomar denies making suchobservationwhich, even having\noccurred, would not have provided legaljustificationfor his arrest and detention.\n22. Increasing Dr. Rajcoomar's emotional turmoil, which his arrest and\ndetention had inflicted, was the fear that his wife would have no idea as to what had\nbecome ofhim. Indeed, during his detention, he could hear his cell phone repeatedly\nringing. Convinced that it was his wife who was calling to ascertain his condition and\n\nwhereabouts, Dr. Rajcoomar repeatedly asked permission to answer his phone. These\nrequests were continuously denied.\n23. At the end offour hours, without apology or explanation from eitherTSA\nagent or the police, Dr. Rajcoomar's property was returned and he was told that he was\nfree to go. At this point, he requested that the TSA agents provide him their names. This\nrequest was refused and the TSA agents hastily left the police station.\n24. As a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army Reserves, and a\nphysician in private practice for the last 20 years, this entire situation was enormously\ndemoralizing, physically abusive and has taken a psychological toll, leaving Dr.\nRajcoomarwith difficulty sleeping at night and concentrating during the day. It has\nshattered the sense ofpersonal security which he had enjoyed as a citizen ofthe United\nStates.\n25. The actions ofthe TSA agents were undertaken because oft~e race and\nethnicity ofDr. Rajcoomar in violation ofthe laws ofthe Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania and the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nFirst Cause ofAction\n26. The warrantless detention and searches by the TSA agents constitute false\narrest, assault, battery, false imprisonment, unlawful search, and unlawful invasion of\nprivacyofDr. Rajcoomar and also constitute intentional or negligent infliction of\nemotional distress ofDr. and Mrs. Rajcoomar under the laws ofthe Commonwealth of\n\nPennsylvania.\n27. Under the Federal Torts Claims Act, defendants United States ofAmerica\nand TSA are liable for the above described actions ofagents McCullerand Mumma as\nthey were acting within the scope oftheir employment as law enforcement officers for the\nUnited States ofAmerica and its Transportation SecurityAdministration.\nSecond Cause ofAction\n28.
