    "summary": "<p>On January 17, 2006, the Center for Constitutional Rights and five of its attorneys who represented clients suspected of involvement with terrorist organizations, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The plaintiffs originally sought an injunction that would prohibit the government from conducting warrantless surveillance of communications in the U.S, claiming that such surveillance violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\"), the Separation of Powers doctrine, and the First and Fourth Amendments. Plaintiffs based these allegations primarily upon statements by President George W. Bush and other government officials in December 2005 admitting that the NSA had monitored, without a warrant, communications between the U.S. and a foreign country where one of the parties was believed to be a member or affiliate of al-Qa'ida. FISA explicitly authorized electronic surveillance for the purposes of collecting foreign intelligence only upon orders issued by federal judges on a special court.</p>\r\n<p>By January 2007, the government claimed to have shut down the surveillance program, having received approval from a FISA Court judge to carry out the same surveillance pursuant to court order. (On re-application, it seems that another FISA Court judge disagreed; the threatened end of the program led to the enactment first of the Protect America Act and then the FISA Amendments Act, in 2007 and 2008, respectively; these allowed the surveillance in question.) There remained, however, one final set of claims not affected by the end of the non-FISA surveillance program: the plaintiffs asked the Court to order the government to destroy any records of surveillance of the plaintiffs. The government argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they lacked evidence that they had actually been surveilled.</p>\r\n<p>In late 2006, the Multi District Litigation (MDL) Panel transferred the case to the Northern District of California to be consolidated with the Multi District Litigation. On February 23, 2007, the Panel consolidated the case with the MDL, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13881\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In Re National Security Agency Telecommunications Records Litigation</a>. For information about what happened while the case was a part of the consolidation see <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12825\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hepting v. AT&amp;T</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, on January 31, 2011, the District Court (Judge Vaughn R. Walker) granted summary judgment in favor of the government. The Court held that the plaintiffs had failed to establish standing for any of their claims. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\r\n<p>On June 12, 2013, Judge McKeown wrote for the Ninth Circuit and affirmed the district court's dismissal. In re Nat'l Sec. Agency Telecommunications Records Litig., 522 F. App'x 383 (9th Cir. 2013). The Court of Appeals relied on the Supreme Court's decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12972\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Clapper v. Amnesty International</a>, (133 S. Ct. 1138 (2013)). On November 1, 2013, The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing, and on March 19, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari review. The case is therefore done.</p>",

This is  an action for  injunctive relief,  seeking an order that would require President \nGeorge W.  Bush and his agents to halt an illegal and unconstitutional program of electronic \nsurveillance of American citizens and other residents of this country.  The President recently \nadmitted to the nation that, pursuant to a secretly issued executive order, the National Security \nAgency  (NSA)  has  for  over  four  years  engaged  in  a  program  of widespread  electronic \nsurveillance of telephone calls and emails, without warrants from  any court,  in some cases \n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document1-1    Filed02/23/07   Page2 of 16\ntargeting persons within the United States and/or obtaining the contents of communications of \npersons within the United States (hereinafter, \"NSA Surveillance Program\"). \n2.  Defendants'  electronic surveillance without court orders is contrary to clear statutory \nmandates provided in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), 50 U.S.C. § 1801-62. \nIndeed,  because  the  NSA  Surveillance  Program  conducts  electronic  surveillance  without \nstatutory authorization, it constitutes a series of criminal acts under FISA.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1809. \nThe  NSA  Surveillance  Program  also  violates  the  separation  of powers,  as  it  exceeds  the \nconstitutional powers of the President under Article II of the Constitution, and violates the First \nand  Fourth Amendments to  the  Constitution.  To  the  extent that electronic  surveillance  is \nessential to protect the national security of this country, Congress has provided a comprehensive \nset of procedures for such surveillance in FISA, which allows for court authorization of such \nsurveillance upon individualized  showings  that the  targets are  agents  of foreign  powers  or \nforeign terrorist groups.  FISA includes provisions for short-term emergency surveillance while \nan application for a court order is being prepared, and for warrantless surveillance during the first \nfifteen days of a war.  Congress has provided that FISA and specified provisions of the criminal \ncode  are  the \"exclusive  means  by which  electronic  surveillance  ...  and the  interception  of \ndomestic wire, oral, and electronic communications may be conducted.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(f) \n(emphasis added). Yet the President declined to pursue these \"exclusive means,\" and instead \nunilaterally  and  secretly  authorized  electronic  surveillance  without  judicial  approval  or \nCongressional authorization. \n3.  The Center for Constitutional Rights represents many persons whose rights have been \nviolated by detention and intelligence gathering practices instituted in the wake of the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, 2001. Lawyers at the Center represent, among others: representatives of \n2 \n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document1-1    Filed02/23/07   Page3 of 16\na potential class of hundreds of Muslim foreign nationals detained in the wake of September 11 \nand labeled \"of interest\" to tbe investigation of the attacks; hundreds of men detained without \ncharge as \"enemy combatants\" at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station; and a Canadian citizen \nstopped while changing planes at JFK Airport in New York while on his way home to Canada, \nand sent to Syria, where he was tortured and detained without charges for nearly a year. \n4.  The vast majority of these clients are individuals whom tbe government has at some time \nsuspected of a link, however attenuated and unsubstantiated, to al Qaeda, groups supportive of al \nQaeda, or to terrorist activity generally. For this reason, Plaintiffs' clients are within the class of \npeople the government has described as the targets of the warrantless NSA surveillance program \nchallenged here. \n5.  Plaintiffs believe that their conversations and emails with these clients, and with other \npersons abroad with whom they have communicated in connection with these cases, have been \nsubject to surveillance pursuant to the NSA Surveillance Program. It is likely that Plaintiffs' \nprivileged attorney-client communications were and continue to be intercepted by Defendants. \n6.  The  secretive nature  of the NSA Surveillance Program,  combined witb Defendants' \nadmission that it is targeted at persons alleged to have some connection to al Qaeda or groups \nthat support it, has inhibited Plaintiffs' ability to represent their clients vigorously. \nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff the Center for Constitutional Rights, Inc. (\"the Center\" or \"CCR\") is a non-profit \nlaw finn maintaining its only office within this district at 666 Broadway, 7th Floor, New York, \nNew York 10012.  It sues in its own capacity and on behalf of its lawyers and legal staff. \n3 \n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document1-1    Filed02/23/07   Page4 of 16\n8.  Plaintiffs Tina M. Foster, Gitanjali S. Gutierrez, Maria LaHood, and Rachel Meeropol are \nattorneys at the Center for Constitutional Rights. Plaintiff Seema Ahmad is a legal worker at the \nCenter. Plaintiff Foster resides in Queens, New York. Plaintiff Gutierrez resides in Ithaca, New \nYork. Plaintiffs LaHood and Meeropol reside in Brooklyn, New York. Plaintiff Ahmad resides in \nManhattan, New York.  All  work primarily out of the Center's Manhattan office, and all are \nUnited States citizens. \n9.  George W. Bush is President of the United States.

The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York is a proper venue \nof this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 139l(e) because defendants are officers and employees of \nthe United States or its agencies operating under color of law, no real property is involved in this \naction, and a plaintiff resides in this district. In addition, Defendants' actions caused injury to \nPlaintiffs in this district, where their law office is  located and from which they engaged in \ninternational communications. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nSTATUTORY BACKGROUND \n23.  In 1978,  after the disclosure of widespread spying on American citizens by various \nfederal law enforcement and intelligence agencies,  including the NSA, Congress enacted the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (\"FISA\"), Pub. L. 95-511, Title I, 92 Stat. 1796 \n(Oct. 25, 1978), codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1801-62, as amended.  FISA provides a comprehensive \nstatutory  scheme  for  conducting  electronic  surveillance  for  foreign  intelligence  or  national \nsecurity purposes.  FISA requires that such surveillance be conducted pursuant to orders from the \nstatutorily created Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, with narrow exceptions that would \n6 \n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document1-1    Filed02/23/07   Page7 of 16\nnot  authorize  the  surveillance  that  is  the  subject  of  this  lawsuit.  In  enacting  this \nstatute, Congress provided that it and specified provisions of the criminal code are the \"exclusive \nmeans by which electronic surveillance ...  and the interception of domestic wire,  oral,  and \nelectronic  communications  may  be  conducted.\"  18  U.S.C.  § 2511(2)(f)  (emphasis  added). \nCongress  further  established  that  conducting  electronic  surveillance  without  such  statutory \nauthorization is a crime.  50 U.S.C.  § 1809 (making it a crime to \"(1) engage[] in electronic \nsurveillance  under color  of law except as  authorized  by  statute;  or (2)  disclose[]  or use[] \ninformation obtained under color of law by electronic surveillance, knowing or having reason to \nknow  that  the  information  was  obtained  through  electronic  surveillance  not  authorized  by \nstatute\"). \n24.  FISA specifically addresses the issue of domestic electronic surveillance during wartime. \nIn a provision entitled \"Authorization during time of war,\" FISA dictates that \"[n]otwithstanding \nany other law, the President, through the Attorney General, may authorize electronic surveillance \nwithout a court order under this subchapter to acquire foreign intelligence information for a \nperiod not to exceed fifteen calendar days following a declaration of war by the Congress.\"  50 \nU.S.C. § 1811 (emphasis added).  The FISA Conference Report states that \"this [15-day] period \nwill allow time for consideration of any amendment to this act that may be appropriate during a \nwartime emergency.  ...  The conferees expect that such amendment would be reported with \nrecommendations within 7 days and that each House would vote on the amendment within 7 \ndays thereafter.\"  H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1720, at 34 (1978). \n25.  Thus, existing law provides that the President may conduct electronic surveillance only \npursuant to FISA and specified provisions of the criminal code, and that doing so outside of \nthese \"exclusive means\" is a crime. \n7 \n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document1-1    Filed02/23/07   Page8 of 16\nTHE NSA SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM \n26.  Since as early as September 2001, the National Security Agency,  under authorization \nfrom  President  George  W.  Bush,  has  engaged  in  a  systematic  program  of warrantless \neavesdropping upon phone and email communications of thousands of individuals, including \nAmerican citizens and permanent legal residents, both within and outside of the United States. \n27.  The  government claims that the NSA  Surveillance  Program targets  communications \nbetween a party outside the United States and a party inside the United States when one of the \nparties of the communication is believed to be \"a member of al Qaeda, affiliated with al Qaeda, \nor a member of an organization affiliated with al Qaeda, or working in support of al Qaeda.\" \nAttorney General Alberto Gonzales, Press Briefing by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and \nGeneral Michael Hayden, Principal Deputy Director for National Intelligence (Dec. 19, 2005). \n28.  The decision that a person fits these criteria may be made by an operations staffer with \napproval of a shift supervisor within NSA.  There is no review of the decision by other executive \nagencies prior to implementing the electronic surveillance.  There is no review of the decision at \nany point by a court or by Congress. \n29.  The NSA Surveillance Program has intercepted both phone and email communications \nwhere both parties to the communications were located with the United States. \n30.  Defendants claim the NSA Surveillance Program is subjected to an internal review within \nthe executive branch approximately every 45 days, and that the President has reauthorized the \nprogram over thirty times to date. \n31.  Upon information and belief, at some point between its inception and the present, the \nNSA  Surveillance  Program  was  suspended  for  several  months  due  to  concerns  about  its \nillegality. Nonetheless, Defendants have defended the legality of the NSA Surveillance Program \n8 \n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document1-1    Filed02/23/07   Page9 of 16\nsince its existence became public knowledge on or about December 15, 2005, and the President \nhas stated that he intends to reauthorize the program \"for as long as our nation faces a continuing \nthreat from al Qaeda and related groups.\" \n32.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  NSA  Surveillance  Program  collects  not  only  the \nidentities of persons communicating with targets of surveillance, but also the contents of those \ncommunications (e.g. recordings or transcripts of a phone call or the text of an email). \n33.  Upon  information  and  belief,  other  government  agencies  and  officials,  including \nDefendants DIA, CIA, DHS, FBI,  and Defendant Negroponte, have received from the NSA \ninformation obtained through the NSA Surveillance Program, without court approval or statutory \nauthorization. \n34.  Upon information and belief, Defendant DIA has used information obtained from the \nNSA Surveillance Program as the basis for carrying out further surveillance of persons within the \nUnited States. \nTHE EFFECT OF THE UNLAWFUL NSA SURVEILLANCE SCHEME ON \nPLAINTIFFS' COMMUNICATIONS WITH CLIENTS AND OTHERS \n35.  Plaintiff the  Center  for  Constitutional  Rights  is  a  non-profit  legal  and  educational \norganization dedicated to protecting and advancing the rights guaranteed by the United States \nConstitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. CCR uses litigation proactively to \nadvance the law in a positive direction, to empower oppressed communities, to guarantee the \nrights of those with the fewest protections and least access to legal resources, and to strengthen \nthe broader international movement for constitutional rights and human rights under international \nlaw. CCR and its attorneys consider their legal advocacy and public education work to be modes \nof political expression and association. \n9 \n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document1-1    Filed02/23/07   Page10 of 16\n36.  Plaintiffs Tina Foster and Gitanjali Gutierrez are attorneys at the Center whose primary \njob responsibilities involve managing the litigation of habeas petitions filed on behalf of foreign \nnationals detained at Guantanamo  Bay Naval  Station, Cuba, often through \"next friends\" \ntypically relatives of the detained-located overseas. The Center is lead counsel on some of \nthese cases; on most, the Center serves as co-counsel with lead counsel outside the Center, who \ninclude lawyers at transnational law firms, located throughout the United States and overseas. In \nthis capacity Plaintiffs Foster and Gutierrez communicate regularly with family members of the \ndetainees, potential witnesses in the habeas cases, officials of foreign governments located in the \ndetainees' home countries, former detainees who have been released and returned to their home \ncountries, and cooperating counsel, located both inside and outside of the United States, who are \nlitigating  individual  cases.  Plaintiff Foster  also  routinely  is  required  to  communicate  with \ntranslators and interpreters located overseas in the course of her work on these cases.  Some of \nthe people Plaintiffs Foster and Gutierrez communicate with in connection with their legal work \neither have officially been deemed by the United States as \"enemy combatants,\" and therefore fit \nwithin the criteria articulated by Attorney General Gonzales,  or are reasonably likely to  be \nviewed by the United States as fitting within those criteria. \n37.  Plaintiff Seema Ahmad is a legal worker at the Center whose primary job responsibilities \nalso involve coordination of the habeas petitions for Guantanamo detainees. Plaintiff Ahmad \ncommunicates regularly  with family  members  of the  detainees, cooperating counsel, human \nrights lawyers located overseas, former detainees, and other individuals in relation to these cases. \nSome of the people she communicates with in connection with her legal team duties either have \nofficially been deemed by the United States as \"enemy combatants,\" and therefore fit within the \n10 \n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document1-1    Filed02/23/07   Page11 of 16\ncriteria articulated by Attorney General Gonzales for targets of the NSA Surveillance Program, \nor are reasonably likely to be viewed by the United States as fitting within those criteria. \n38.  Plaintiffs Gutierrez, Foster and Ahmad participate in frequent training and joint strategy \nsessions with other counsel on the Guantanamo cases. These meetings generally involve some \nlawyers  attending  in  person,  and  others  conferencing in via videoconference  technology or \ntelephonic conference calls. Co-counsel or other participants frequently use such means to call \ninto these meetings from overseas.  Counsel on the Guantanamo cases also rely heavily on an \nemail Iistserv and a private extranet site (accessible via the Internet) to coordinate their efforts in \nthe cases. \n39.  Plaintiff Maria  LaHood  is  a  staff attorney  at  the  Center  for  Constitutional  Rights \nresponsible  for  litigating  a number  of cases  in CCR' s  International  Human Rights  docket, \nincluding Arar v. Ashcroft, 04-CV-0249 (E.D.N.Y.), a case on behalf of a Syrian-born Canadian \ncitizen detained in New York while changing flights at JFK Airport and sent by United States \nofficials to  Syria to  be tortured.  In the course of her work on that case she communicates \nfrequently by phone and e-mail with the plaintiff, Maher Arar, who lives in Canada, as well as \nwith others abroad. The United States government continues to assert, incorrectly, that Mr. Arar \nis a member of al Qaeda, and therefore Mr. Arar fits within the criteria for targets of the NSA \nSurveillance Program described by Attorney General Gonzales. \n40.  Plaintiff Rachel  Meeropol  is  a  staff attorney  at  the  Center for Constitutional Rights \nresponsible  for  litigating  cases  in the  Center's  prisoners'  rights  docket,  and  serves  as  lead \ncounsel  in  Turkmen  v.  Ashcroft,  02-CV-2307  (E.D.N.Y.).  The  Turkmen  case  involves  the \ndetention  and  abuse  of so-called  \"special  interest\"  immigration  detainees  swept  up  in the \nimmediate aftermath of 9/11 and held long after their fmal deportation orders so that tl1ey could \n11 \n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document1-1    Filed02/23/07   Page12 of 16\nbe investigated for links to terrorism. In her capacity as an attorney at the Center, Ms. Meeropol \nroutinely discusses matters by telephone or email with potential clients overseas.  In the course \nof her work on the Turkmen case she communicates with the named plaintiffs and potential class \nmembers, all of whom now live overseas, via both e-mail and telephone calls.  Some of the \nindividuals outside the United States Ms. Meeropol communicates with are likely to be viewed \nby  the  United  States  as  fitting  within the broad  criteria for  NSA  surveillance  outlined  by \nAttorney General Gonzales. \n41.  All of the individual Plaintiffs above have traveled internationally in the course of their \nwork with the Center. During these trips, other attorneys and employees of the Center routinely \nneed  to  communicate  with  these  Plaintiffs  concerning  work-related  matters  via  email  or \ntelephone. \n42.  The  revelation  that  the  government  has  been  carrying  on  widespread  warrantless \ninterception  of electronic  communications,  especially  of international  communications,  has \nimpaired Plaintiffs' ability to communicate via telephone and email with their overseas clients, \nwitnesses, and other persons, out of fear that their privileged communications are being and will \nbe overheard by the NSA Surveillance Program.  As a ·matter of professional ethics in their role \nas attorneys, Plaintiffs are obligated to take reasonable and appropriate measures to reduce the \nrisk of disclosure of certain client confidences, once they have been apprised that a program of \nunlawful electronic surveillance by the government exists.  The risk that their conversations are \nbeing overheard has forced  Plaintiffs to  institute protective measures to  reduce the potential \nimpact of such surveillance on their representation of their clients, including not communicating \nwith certain individuals at all by phone or email, and avoiding subjects central to the attorney \nclient relationship and work product in electronic communications with others.  Plaintiffs are \n12 \n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document1-1    Filed02/23/07   Page13 of 16\ncompelled to undertake international travel to avoid the risk of jeopardizing the confidentiality of \nprivileged communications.  As a result, Plaintiffs are suffering irreparable harm to their ability \nto advocate vigorously on their clients' behalf. \n43.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Plaintiffs'  communications,  including  attorney-client \nprivileged communications and attorney work product, have been and continue to be intercepted \nby the NSA Surveillance Program. \n44.  The NSA Surveillance Program permits the surveillance of conversations of people for \nwhom the government would not be able to establish probable cause that the subject of the \nsurveillance  is  an  agent  of a  foreign  power.  Knowledge  that  their  conversations  may  be \noverheard chills persons outside the United States who are not agents of foreign powers from \ncontacting the Plaintiffs through electronic means to seek their legal advice and/or to provide \ninformation  in  connection  with  legal  matters  pursued  by  Plaintiffs.  The  unlawful  NSA \nSurveillance Program has negatively affected Plaintiffs' ability to communicate with clients, co-\ncounsel, witnesses,  and other relevant individuals in the course of carrying out their role as \nadvocates for their clients and others, and has thus done irreparable harm to their ability to \neffectively advocate for  these  individuals,  and will  continue to  inflict such harm until  it is \nstopped. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Administrative Procedure Act and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) \n45.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the preceding \nparagraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n46.  The NSA  Surveillance Program  is  not authorized  by the  statutes that Congress  has \nmandated shall be the \"exclusive means by which electronic surveillance ... and the interception \n13 \n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document1-1    Filed02/23/07   Page14 of 16\nof  domestic  wire,  oral,  and  electronic  communications  may  be  conducted,\"  18  U .S .C. \n§ 2511(2)(f), namely FISA, 50 U.S.C. § 1801-62, and the specific criminal code provisions listed \nin  18  U.S.C.  § 2511(2)(f).  FISA makes  it a crime to  obtain electronic  surveillance without \nstatutory authorization, and also makes it a crime to disclose or use information obtained through \nsuch  surveillance.  50  U.S.C.  § 1809.  Defendants  engaged  in  electronic  surveillance,  and \ndisclosed and used information obtained therefrom, without statutory authorization.  Defendants' \nactions are therefore contrary to law and subject to judicial review under the Administrative \nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Separation of Powers) \n47.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the preceding \nparagraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n48.  Defendants, by carrying out their program of unlawful warrantless surveillance, have \nacted in excess of the President's Article II authority by failing to take care to execute the laws, \nand instead violating those laws, and by acting in contravention of clear statutory dictates in an \narea in which Congress has Article I authority to regulate, and where Congress has specifically \nprohibited the President from engaging in the conduct at issue here. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Fourth Amendment violations) \n49.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the preceding \nparagraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n14 \n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document1-1    Filed02/23/07   Page15 of 16\n50.  Defendants have carried out unreasonable surveillance of Plaintiffs' private telephone \nand  email  communications  without probable  cause  or  warrants,  in  violation  of the  Fourth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(First Amendment Violations) \n51.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the preceding \nparagraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n52.  Defendants,  by carrying out and/or asserting the right to  carry out their program of \nunlawful warrantless surveillance, have impaired Plaintiffs' ability to freely provide legal advice, \nto join together in an association for the purpose of legal advocacy, to freely form attorney-client \nrelationships, to vigorously advocate for clients and to petition the government for redress of \ngrievances  all of which are  modes  of expression  and  association  protected  under the  First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n(a.)  Declare that Defendants' program ofwarrantless surveillance is unlawful, and enjoin any \nfurther such warrantless surveillance; \n(b.)  Order  that  Defendants  disclose  to  Plaintiffs  all  unlawful  surveillance  of Plaintiffs' \ncommunications carried out pursuant to the program; \n(c .)  Order that all Defendants tum over to  Plaintiffs all  information and records  in their \npossession relating to Plaintiffs that were acquired through the warrantless surveillance \n15 \n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document1-1    Filed02/23/07   Page16 of 16\nprogram or were the fruit of surveillance under the program, and subsequently destroy \nany such information and records in Defendants' possession; \n(d.)  Award costs, including an award of attorneys' fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, \n28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(l)(A); \n(e.)  Award such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \nlfi['l); \nJ \nl=Gooilirum[WG-lt \nShayana Kadidal [SK-1278] \nMichael Ratner [MR-3357] \nCENTER FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS \n666 Broadway, 7th Floor \nNewYork,NY 10012-2317 \n(212) 614-6427 \nCCR Cooperating Counsel: \nDavid Cole \nc/o Georgetown University Law Center \n600 New Jersey Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C.  20001 \n(202) 662-9078 \nMichael Av  ery \nNATIONAL LA WYERS GUILD \nc/o Suffolk Law School \n120 Tremont Street \nBoston, MA 92108 \n(617) 573-8551 \ncounsel for Plaintif.fe \n16 ",

On May 27, 2010, defendants — certain high-ranking\n5\ngovernment officials and associated government agencies — filed a\n6\nrenewed motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary\n7\njudgment based in part on plaintiffs’ failure to establish\n8 standing.  Doc #731/39.1  On July 29, 2010, plaintiffs filed a\n9\nrenewed motion for summary judgment and opposition to defendants’\n10\nmotion for summary judgment.  Doc ##742/46, 743/47.

Plaintiffs alleged that defendants engaged in\n19\nelectronic surveillance without court order and thereby violated\n20\nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”), the Separation\n21\nof Powers Doctrine and the First and Fourth Amendments.  Id at 2. \n22\nPlaintiffs based these allegations primarily upon statements by\n23\nPresident George W Bush and other officials in December 2005\n24\nadmitting that the National Security Agency (“NSA”) had monitored,\n25\nwithout a warrant, communications between the United States and a\n26\n27\n1   \nDocuments will be cited both to the MDL docket number (No M 06-\n28 1791) and to the indiv idual docket number (No C 07-1115) in the\nfollowing format: Doc #(MDL)/(individual).\n2\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page3 of 22\n1\nforeign country where one of the parties was believed to be a\n2\nmember or affiliate of al-Qa’ida.  Id at 8.\n3\nThe complaint alleges that plaintiff Center for\n4\nConstitutional Rights (“CCR”) represented, and continues to\n5\nrepresent, clients who are suspected by the United States\n6\ngovernment of having some link to al-Qa’ida or other terrorist\n7\norganizations.  Doc #333-1/16-1 at 2-3.  These clients include\n8\nMuslim foreign nationals detained after the September 11 terrorist\n9\nattacks as persons “of interest” and others detained as “enemy\n10\ncombatants” at Guantanamo Bay.  Id.  Plaintiffs — CCR and five of\na\nni 11\nr its attorneys who represent such clients — “believe that their\nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa conversations and emails with [CCR clients], and with other persons\nCC\nrict ct of  13 abroad with whom they have communicated in connection with these\nstri 14\nDist cases, have been subject to surveillance pursuant to the [TSP].” \ni\n D\ns\nten  15 Id at 3.  Plaintiffs further allege that “[i]t is likely that\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 [p]laintiffs’ privileged attorney-client communications were and\no\nteN\nUnihe  17 continue to be intercepted by Defendants.”  Id.\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF Plaintiffs claim that they were harmed by the\n19\ngovernment’s surveillance program in various ways.  Plaintiffs\n20\nallege that, after they became aware of the program, they were\n21\ncompelled to “institute protective measures to reduce the potential\n22\nimpact of such surveillance on their representation of their\n23\nclients.”  Doc #333-1/16-1 at 12.

In a December 19, 2005 press conference,\n22\nAttorney General Alberto Gonzales explained that the program\n23\ninvolved surveillance of communications between a party in the\n24\nUnited States and a party outside of the United States where there\n25\nis “a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the\n26\ncommunication is a member of [al-Qa’ida], affiliated with [al-\n27\nQa’ida], or a member of an organization affiliated with [al-\n28\nQa’ida], or working in support of [al-Qa’ida].”  Doc #333-4/16-4 at\n7\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page8 of 22\n1\n62.

Doc\n5\n#333-4/16-4 at 90-91.  This program has been referred to by the\n6\ngovernment and others as the Terrorist Surveillance Program\n7\n(“TSP”).  See, for example, Doc #308/3 at 5.\n8\nOn January 17, 2007, Attorney General Gonzales sent a\n9\nletter regarding the TSP to various members of Congress.  Doc\n10\n#127/xxx.

Instead, plaintiffs limited their\n4\nevidence and argument to the claim that their constitutional rights\n5\nwere “chilled” by the mere risk that they were surveilled under the\n6\nTSP.  Plaintiffs claim that this risk forced them to review past\n7\ncommunications that may have been intercepted by the TSP, take\n8\ncorrective action and implement measures to prevent future\n9\ncommunications from being intercepted by the government.  See Doc\n10\n#333-4/16-4 at 6-10.

Id at 6, 9.  Plaintiffs\n23\nallege that this “divert[s] staff time and organizational resources\n24\naway from core mission tasks,” which “hurts [their] organization by\n25\nreducing the number of cases [they] can bring, and undermin[ing\n26\ntheir] ability to litigate [their] existing cases in the most\n27\neffective manner.”  Id at 9-10.\n28\n//\n10\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page11 of 22\n1\nPlaintiffs also claim to have suffered less quantifiable\n2\nharm since learning about the existence of the TSP.  Plaintiffs\n3\nbelieve that given their knowledge of the existence and nature of\n4\nthe TSP they are ethically required to avoid international\n5\nelectronic communications involving sensitive information.  See Doc\n6\n##333-7/16-7 at 2-5, 333-8/16-8 at 3-6, 333-9/16-9 at 2-3. \n7\nPlaintiffs submitted a declaration from Professor Stephen Gillers,\n8\na specialist in legal ethics, stating that “[i]n light of what is\n9\nnow known about the [TSP] and given the nature of CCR’s work as\n10\ndetailed in submissions to the Court, CCR attorneys and their\na\nni 11\nr support persons have substantial reason to fear that telephonic,\nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa fax, and e-mail communications * * * that they may have or have had\nCC\nrict ct of  13 with CCR clients, or with third persons or each other in the course\nstri 14\nDist of representing clients, have been or will be intercepted by the\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 United States.

Because international travel is not\n19\nan effective substitute for easy electronic communications,\n20\nplaintiffs have not been able to communicate with overseas clients\n21\nand contacts as much as desired and believe that the quality of\n22\ntheir litigation has been undermined.\n23\nPlaintiffs have also deemed it necessary to inform\n24\npersons communicating with them via electronic means that their\n25\nconversation may be subject to government surveillance.  See, for\n26\nexample, Doc ##333-7/16-7 at 3, 333-8/16-8 at 5.  William Goodman,\n27\nthe director of CCR, states that “it is difficult to imagine a\n28\nworse thing to have to say at the onset of a relationship with a\n11\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page12 of 22\n1\nclient, witness, or other person with whom one wishes to work\n2\nclosely” because it “inevitably [makes] the CCR staffer appear to\n3\nbe in some fashion an agent of the United States government, or\n4\n[makes] our organization appear suspect due to the fact that\n5\ncommunications with us are subject to government surveillance.” \n6\nDoc #333-7/16-7 at 3.  Plaintiffs imply that the lack of trust\n7\nthereby created has negatively impacted the quality of their\n8\nlitigation activities.\n9\n10\nIII\na\nni 11\nr Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings, discovery\nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa and affidavits show that there is “no genuine issue as to any\nCC\nrict ct of  13 material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\nstri 14\nDist matter of law.”  FRCP 56(c).  A court will grant summary judgment\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 “against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 establish the existence of an element essential to that party's\no\nteN\nUnihe  17 case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF trial * * * since a complete failure of proof concerning an\n19\nessential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders\n20\nall other facts immaterial.”  Celotex Corp v Catrett, 477 US 317,\n21\n322-23 (1986).  \n22\n“It goes without saying that those who seek to invoke the\n23\njurisdiction of the federal courts must satisfy the threshold\n24\nrequirement imposed by Article III of the Constitution by alleging\n25\nan actual case or controversy.”  City of Los Angeles v Lyons, 461\n26\nUS 95, 101 (1983).  Standing is a jurisdictional requirement\n27\ngrounded in Article III of the Constitution.  Lujan v Defenders of\n28\nWildlife, 504 US 555, 559 (1992).  To establish Article III\n12\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page13 of 22\n1\nstanding, a plaintiff must establish: (1) it suffered an “injury-\n2\nin-fact,” which is both “concrete and particularized” and “actual\n3\nor imminent;” (2) a causal connection between the injury and the\n4\nconduct complained of and (3) that it is likely that the injury\n5\nwill be “redressed by a favorable decision.”  Id at 560-61.  The\n6\nparty invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of\n7\nestablishing these elements, and each element must be supported\n8\nwith the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive\n9\nstages of the litigation.  Id at 561.  “At the pleading stage,\n10\ngeneral factual allegations of injury resulting from the\na\nni 11\nr defendant’s conduct may suffice * * *.  In response to a summary\nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa judgment motion, however, the plaintiff can no longer rest on such\nCC\nrict ct of  13 ‘mere allegations,’ but must ‘set forth’ by affidavit or other\nstri 14\nDist evidence ‘specific facts’[].”  Id.  An affidavit that contains\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 “only conclusory allegations, not backed up by statements of fact,\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 * * * cannot defeat a motion for summary judgment.”  Shane v\no\nteN\nUnihe  17 Greyhound Lines, Inc, 868 F2d 1057, 1061 (9th Cir 1989).\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF\n19\nIV\n20\nThe court first turns to whether plaintiffs have\n21\nintroduced sufficient evidence to establish standing for their\n22\nclaim under the First Amendment.  Defendants contend that\n23\n“[p]laintiffs’ allegations of a subjective chill coupled with an\n24\nunwillingness to communicate are insufficient to establish injury-\n25\nin-fact.”  Doc #731/39 at 16.  According to defendants, “where the\n26\nchallenged conduct has unquestionably ceased, as here, plaintiffs’\n27\nallegations of a subjective chill * * * are insufficient to confer\n28\nstanding for their First Amendment claim.”  Id at 21.  \n13\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page14 of 22\n1\nPlaintiffs maintain that they continue to suffer harm to\n2\ntheir “First Amendment interest in litigating against the\n3\ngovernment.”  Doc #743/47 at 12.  Plaintiffs argue that “any\n4\nresponsible attorney would have to conform their behavior to\n5\naccount for the possibility that potential clients and witnesses\n6\nmight be tainted by the possibility of past government\n7\ninterception,” meaning that “CCR will have to exercise caution\n8\ngoing forward in using such individuals in litigation.”  Id at 12-\n9\n13.  This “need for caution interferes with [CCR’s] ability to\n10\nconstruct a case under the ordinary assumptions of confidentiality\na\nni 11\nr that underpin our adversary system of justice.”  Id at 13.  \nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa Plaintiffs also argue that “third parties might sensibly\nCC\nrict ct of  13 be hesitant to communicate freely with CCR staffers even absent a\nstri 14\nDist risk of current unlawful interception,” creating “a current risk\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 that third parties who communicated with [CCR] previously will now\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 be less willing to do so, knowing that the government may have been\no\nteN\nUnihe  17 listening in on those earlier calls.”  Doc #743/47 at 11.\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF Other than references to “possibilities” and “risks,”\n19\nplaintiffs do not argue and have presented no evidence that they\n20\nwere unlawfully surveilled.  Instead, plaintiffs characterize the\n21\nuncertainty about whether they were surveilled, the possible\n22\nexistence of records of that surveillance and the purportedly\n23\nreasonable actions taken in response to it as the harm, alleging\n24\nthat it exerts a “chilling effect” on the exercise of their First\n25\nAmendment rights.  Doc #743/47 at 21-22. \n26\nThe question, then, is whether such chilling effects —\n27\nwhere there is no evidence that plaintiffs were actually surveilled\n28\nunder the TSP — are sufficient to establish the “concrete and\n14\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page15 of 22\n1\nparticularized” injury required for Article III standing.  Lujan,\n2\n504 US at 560.\n3\n4\nA\n5\nIn Laird v Tatum, 408 US 1 (1972), the Supreme Court\n6\nconsidered whether the chilling of First Amendment rights by the\n7\nexistence of an allegedly unlawful government surveillance program\n8\npresented a justiciable controversy.  The Court recognized that\n9\n“constitutional violations may arise from the deterrent, or\n10\n‘chilling,’ effect of governmental regulations that fall short of a\na\nni 11\nr direct prohibition against the exercise of First Amendment rights.” \nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa Id at 11.  The Court, however, found no case that involved a\nCC\nrict ct of  13 “chilling effect aris[ing] merely from the individual’s knowledge\nstri 14\nDist that a governmental agency was engaged in certain activities or\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 from the individual’s concomitant fear that, armed with the fruits\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 of those activities, the agency might in the future take some other\no\nteN\nUnihe  17 and additional action detrimental to that individual.”  Id at 11. \nt\n \nr\no 18\nF The Court emphasized that “[a]llegations of a subjective ‘chill’\n19\nare not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present\n20\nobjective harm or a threat of specific future harm.”  Id at 14-15.\n21\nPlaintiffs attempt to distinguish Laird by relying\n22\nheavily on Presbyterian Church (USA) v United States, 870 F2d 518\n23\n(9th Cir 1989).  In Presbyterian Church, the plaintiff churches\n24\nclaimed that their First and Fourth Amendment rights were violated\n25\nwhen “INS agents entered the churches wearing ‘body bugs’ and\n26\nsurreptitiously recorded church services.”  Id at 520.  The\n27\nplaintiffs alleged that their right to free exercise of religion\n28\nand association was abridged and that “as a result of the\n15\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page16 of 22\n1\nsurveillance of worship services, members have withdrawn from\n2\nactive participation in the churches.”  Id at 520-22.  The court\n3\nruled that the plaintiffs had established standing because “[w]hen\n4\ncongregants are chilled from participating in worship services * *\n5\n* because they fear the government is spying on them and taping\n6\ntheir every utterance, * * * a church suffers organizational injury\n7\nbecause its ability to carry out its ministries has been impaired.” \n8\nId at 522.  The court distinguished Laird as involving a chilling\n9\neffect “caused, not by any specific action of the Army directed\n10\nagainst the plaintiffs, but only by ‘the existence and operation’\na\nni 11\nr of the surveillance program in general.”  Id.  That is, the\nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa plaintiffs in Laird did not allege that they were actually\nCC\nrict ct of  13 surveilled, but “only that they could conceivably become subject to\nstri 14\nDist the Army’s domestic surveillance program.”  Id.\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 In this case, the fear that plaintiffs describe as\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 chilling the exercise of their First Amendment rights is far closer\no\nteN\nUnihe  17 to Laird than Presbyterian Church.  The alleged injury here is, in\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF fact, more speculative than in Laird given that (unlike Laird) the\n19\ngovernment has ceased the activities that gave rise to the lawsuit. \n20\nInstead, there is only a fear that plaintiffs may have been subject\n21\nto unlawful surveillance in the past combined with a fear that some\n22\n“agency might in the future take some other and additional action\n23\ndetrimental to [them].”  Laird, 408 US at 11.  Moreover, at least\n24\nsome of the ongoing burdens described by plaintiff cannot fairly be\n25\ntraced to the TSP itself.  Plaintiffs’ declarations describe at\n26\nlength the disruption to their operations resulting from their\n27\ninability to use quick and efficient electronic communications. \n28\nEven assuming (without deciding) that such fears and measures were\n16\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page17 of 22\n1\nreasonable and that such an injury is sufficiently concrete to\n2\nconfer standing, the TSP cannot provide a justification for\n3\ncontinuing to incur such costs.  The TSP ended in 2007.  Doc\n4\n#127/xxx.  With no reason to believe that they or their clients are\n5\nbeing illegally monitored, there is no imperative (ethical or\n6\notherwise) to avoid the use of electronic communications. \n7\nThe facts of this case are simply not analogous to\n8\nPresbyterian Church, in which the chilling effect was caused by\n9\nactual, substantiated unlawful surveillance of four churches\n10\nlasting almost a year.  870 F2d at 520.  That set of facts\na\nni 11\nr demonstrated “specific present objective harm or a threat of\nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa specific future harm” in a way that plaintiffs here cannot.  See\nCC\nrict ct of  13 Laird, 408 US at 15; Presbyterian Church, 870 F2d at 522.  In\nstri 14\nDist short, there is no “specific action * * * directed against the\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 plaintiffs,” only a fear that plaintiffs may have been unlawfully\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 surveilled, may conceivably suffer an unfair disadvantage in\no\nteN\nUnihe  17 litigation at some point in the future and that some third parties\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF may be unwilling to communicate or cooperate with plaintiffs based\n19\non their uncertainty about the details of the TSP.  That is\n20\ninsufficient to establish injury in fact for purposes of Article\n21\nIII standing. \n22\n23\nB\n24\nEven if the possibility of harm in this case were\n25\nsufficiently concrete to constitute injury in fact, the injury\n26\nclaimed by plaintiffs is not itself cognizable under the First\n27\nAmendment.  Although litigation is unquestionably protected by the\n28\nFirst Amendment when it is used as a means of political expression\n17\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page18 of 22\n1\nand advocacy, the First Amendment does not protect against every\n2\nconceivable burden or difficulty that may arise during litigation. \n3\nPlaintiffs rely upon NAACP v Button, 371 US 415 (1963), to support\n4\ntheir First Amendment claim, arguing that “[w]hat was true of the\n5\nNAACP in the 1960’s is certainly true of CCR today” and “the [TSP]\n6\nintrudes on plaintiffs’ right to ‘petition for redress of\n7\ngrievances,” * * * and on their ‘political expression.’”  Doc #333-\n8\n3/16-3 at 47.\n9\nIn NAACP, the NAACP and its Legal Defense and Education\n10\nFund frequently sought out aggrieved persons, informed them of\na\nni 11\nr their legal rights and offered to represent them without charge in\nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa school desegregation and other such cases.  NAACP, 371 US at 419-\nCC\nrict ct of  13 22.  Typically, the NAACP did so at meetings of parents and\nstri 14\nDist children at which its representatives would explain the steps\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 necessary to achieve school desegregation and offer legal\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 representation.  Id at 421.  Litigation was just one strategy used\no\nteN\nUnihe  17 to promote the ultimate goal of the NAACP, “to secure the\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF elimination of all racial barriers which deprive Negro citizens of\n19\nthe privileges and burdens of equal citizenship rights in the\n20\nUnited States.”  Id at 419.  In 1956, the state of Virginia enacted\n21\na statute making it a criminal violation to solicit legal business\n22\nthrough the use of “an agent for an individual or organization\n23\nwhich retains a lawyer in connection with an action to which it is\n24\nnot a party and in which it has no pecuniary right or liability.” \n25\nId at 424.  The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals held that the\n26\nNAACP, its members and its attorneys had practiced criminal\n27\nsolicitation as defined in the statute.  Id at 433-34.  On appeal,\n28\nthe United States Supreme Court read the Virginia statute as\n18\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page19 of 22\n1\n“proscribing any arrangement by which prospective litigants are\n2\nadvised to seek the assistance of particular attorneys.”  Id at\n3\n433.  The court held that the statute “unduly inhibit[s] protected\n4\nfreedoms of expression and association” and posed “the gravest\n5\ndanger of smothering all discussion looking to the eventual\n6\ninstitution of litigation on behalf of the rights of members of an\n7\nunpopular minority.”  Id at 434, 437. \n8\nUnlike the plaintiffs in NAACP, whose legal activities on\n9\nbehalf of minorities were criminalized by an exceedingly broad\n10\nstate law, plaintiffs in the present case claim to be harmed\na\nni 11\nr because there is a risk “that the government may have access to\nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa aspects of CCR’s litigation strategy” as well as a risk “that third\nCC\nrict ct of  13 parties who communicated with [CCR] previously will now be less\nstri 14\nDist willing to do so.”  Doc #743/47 at 11.  Plaintiffs also claim to be\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 harmed by the need to take steps to assess the scope of any past\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 surveillance and to ensure that no confidential communications are\no\nteN\nUnihe  17 disclosed in the future.  Id at 10, 13.  Although plaintiffs appear\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF to have established that their litigation activities have become\n19\nmore costly due to their concern about the TSP, plaintiffs remain\n20\nfree to pursue their political goals by litigating against the\n21\ngovernment, and continue to do so vigorously.  Plaintiffs have not\n22\nprovided any precedent for the notion that the First Amendment\n23\nprotects against a “risk * * * that the government may have access\n24\nto aspects of [a plaintiff’s] litigation strategy” where there is\n25\nno proof that any surveillance in fact occurred.  Id at 11.  Nor\n26\nhave plaintiffs provided precedent for a protected First Amendment\n27\nright “to litigate * * * cases in the most effective manner.”  Doc\n28\n#333-4/16-4 at 9-10.\n19\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page20 of 22\n1\nIn short, plaintiffs have not shown that they “personally\n2\nha[ve] suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the\n3\nputatively illegal conduct,”  Valley Forge Christian College v\n4\nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc, 454 US\n5\n464, 472 (1982), especially in light of the “clear precedent\n6\nrequiring that the allegations of future injury be particular and\n7\nconcrete.”  Steel Co v Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 US\n8\n83, 109 (1998).  Plaintiffs have therefore failed to establish\n9\nstanding for their First Amendment claim.\n10\na\nni 11\nr V\nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa In their renewed motion for summary judgment and\nCC\nrict ct of  13 opposition to defendants’ motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs\nstri 14\nDist make little attempt to establish standing for their remaining\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 claims under FISA, the Fourth Amendment and the separation of\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 powers doctrine.  Nevertheless, the court will briefly examine\no\nteN\nUnihe  17 whether plaintiffs have established standing for these other\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF claims.  \n19\nFISA establishes a cause of action for an “aggrieved\n20\nperson * * * who has been subjected to an electronic surveillance\n21\nor about whom information obtained by electronic surveillance of\n22\nsuch person has been disclosed or used in violation of section\n23\n1809.”  50 USC § 1810.  As discussed at length by this court in the\n24\nrelated case Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation v Obama, Case No C 07-\n25\n0109, only by presenting evidence of actual surveillance can a\n26\nplaintiff establish the “aggrieved person” status necessary to\n27\nproceed with a FISA claim.  See In re NSA Telecoms Records\n28\nLitigation, 564 F Supp 2d 1109, 1131-35 (ND Cal 2008).  Because\n20\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page21 of 22\n1\nplaintiffs have presented no evidence of such surveillance, they\n2\nhave failed to establish standing for their FISA claim.  \n3\nThe same is true of plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claim. \n4\n“[T]he rights assured by the Fourth Amendment are personal rights,\n5\n[which] * * * may be enforced * * * only at the instance of one\n6\nwhose own protection was infringed by the search and seizure.” \n7\nRakas v Illinois, 439 US 128, 133-38 (1978) (quotation omitted). \n8\nPlaintiffs therefore cannot establish Fourth Amendment standing\n9\nwithout showing that they were in fact subject to unreasonable\n10\nsearch or seizure.  Plaintiffs have not done so. \na\nni 11\nr Finally, plaintiffs’ claim based on the separation of\nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa powers doctrine also fails.  Plaintiffs have failed to establish\nCC\nrict ct of  13 that they were subjected to the unlawful program at issue: the TSP. \nstri 14\nDist Plaintiffs cannot establish, therefore, that the government’s\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 alleged violation of separation of powers principles by\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 implementing the TSP caused plaintiffs any “actual injury\no\nteN\nUnihe  17 redressable by the court.”  United States v Hoyt, 879 F2d 505, 514\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF (9th Cir 1989) (ruling that a defendant not subject to the statute\n19\nat issue did not have standing to challenge it); see also\n20\nImmigration and Naturalization Service v Chadha, 462 US 919, 935-36\n21\n(1983) (claims asserted under the separation of powers doctrine are\n22\nsubject to the traditional Article III standing requirements). \n23\nUnlike other cases in which standing to bring a separation of\n24\npowers claim was found, plaintiffs cannot establish that they were\n25\nactually subjected to the conduct alleged to have violated the\n26\nseparation of powers.  See, for example, Chadha, 462 US at 923,\n27\n935-36 (reviewing whether one house of Congress could order the\n28\nplaintiff deported); Buckley v Valeo, 424 US 1, 117 (1976)\n21\n\nCase3:07-cv-01115-VRW   Document51   Filed01/31/11   Page22 of 22\n1\n(reviewing whether the Federal Election Commission could make\n2\nrulings regarding the plaintiff); Glidden Co v Zdanok, 370 US 530,\n3\n532-33 (1962) (reviewing whether the plaintiffs’ cases could be\n4\nadjudicated by judges from non-Article III courts).\n5\nAccordingly, plaintiffs have failed to establish standing\n6\nfor any of their claims and summary judgment in favor of defendants\n7\nis appropriate.\n8\n9\nVI\n10\nFor the reasons stated above, defendants’ motion for\na\nni 11\nr summary judgment is GRANTED.  Doc #39.  Plaintiffs’ motion for\nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa summary judgment is DENIED.  Doc #47.
