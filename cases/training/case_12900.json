The named plaintiffs were the company and its shareholders and the defendants were the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Treasury, and the U.S. Department of Labor. Represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom and Americans United for Life, the plaintiff asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief in the form of an exception to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandate requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage of contraception. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that providing insurance coverage of contraception would violate the religious beliefs of the corporation's owners.</p><p>On August 14, 2013, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion for a preliminary injunction and stayed the case at the defendant's request. The court ordered the defendant not to enforce the ACA insurance mandate regarding contraception against the plaintiff until 30 days after the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12714&\">Gilardi v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services </a>, which involved similar legal issues and the same defendant as this case. Gilardi was held while the Supreme Court decided <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12661\">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a>. On June 30, 2014, the Court in Hobby Lobby held that the HHS regulations imposing the contraceptive mandate violated RFRA when applied to closely-held for-profit corporations. </p><p>Following this ruling, the district court reviewed recommendations for further proceedings that the parties submitted. On October 8, 2014, the court noted that while the parties agreed that the plaintiff was entitled to a permanent injunction following Hobby Lobby, they disagreed over the scope of that injunction. The court instructed the parties to file supplemental memorandum detailing the injunction language they supported or objected to. The parties filed the memoranda on October 29, 2014, but as of May 13, 2020 the court has not recorded an order, and no other substantive litigation has occurred. Nevertheless, attorney appearances continue to be entered on the docket, and the case is ongoing. </p>",

Trijicon and its shareholders have a deeply held religious belief that life begins at \nconception/fertilization. Therefore, for many years, they have instructed their insurance carrier \n2 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 3 of 29\nnot to include coverage for the voluntary termination of pregnancies in the company’s health \ninsurance plan for employees. The Plaintiffs understood this to prohibit coverage of abortion-\ninducing drugs that prevent implantation of an embryo.  The Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act (“ACA”), however, requires that in its health care plan for employees Trijicon include \ncoverage for items that induce early abortions by preventing the implantation of an embryo after \nits conception/fertilization.    \n2.  The ACA authorized Defendants the Department of HHS and its Secretary to \ndevelop a mandate that includes early abortion-inducing items under the category of preventive \nservices for women (“Mandate”)1. The mandate is enforced by Defendants the Departments of \nHHS, Labor and Treasury and their respective Secretaries.   \n3.  The Mandate illegally and unconstitutionally requires Trijicon to violate its and \nits owners’ religious beliefs by forcing the company to provide abortion-inducing items, such as \n“Plan B” (the so-called “morning after pill”), Ella (the so-called “week after pill”), and inta-\nuterine devices (“IUDs”).  The Mandate subjects the company to heavy fines and penalties if it \n                                                 \n1 The Mandate consists of a conglomerate of authorities, including: “Group Health Plans and \nHealth  Insurance  Issuers  Relating  to  Coverage  of  Preventive  Services  Under  the  Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act,” 77 Fed. Reg. 8725–30 (Feb. 15, 2012); the prior interim \nfinal rule found at 76 Fed. Reg. 46621–26 (Aug. 3, 2011) which the Feb. 15 rule adopted \n“without  change”;  the  guidelines  by D efendant  HHS’s  Health  Resources  and  Services \nAdministration (HRSA), http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/, mandating that health plans \ninclude no-cost-sharing coverage of “All Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive \nmethods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with \nreproductive capacity” as part of required women’s “preventive care”; regulations issued by \nDefendants in 2010 directing HRSA to develop those guidelines, 75 Fed. Reg. 41726 (July 19, \n2010);  the  statutory  authority  found  in  42  U.S.C.  §  300gg-13(a)(4)  requiring  unspecified \npreventive health services generally, to the extent Defendants have used it to mandate coverage \nto which Trijicon and other employers have religious objections; penalties existing throughout \nthe United States Code for noncompliance with these requirements; and other provisions of ACA \nor its implementing regulations that affect exemptions or other aspects of the Mandate. \n3 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 4 of 29\nchooses  not  to  violate  those  beliefs.  Defendants’  coercion  tramples  on  the  freedom  of \nconscience, freedom of religious exercise, and freedom of speech of Trijicon and its owners.   \n4.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief for the Defendants’ violations of \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq. (RFRA), the First and Fifth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 500, et seq., (“APA”) via 5 U.S.C. § 700, et seq., (allowing for judicial review of APA \nviolations), by Defendants’ actions in implementing the ACA, in ways that coerce the Plaintiffs \nto engage in acts that they consider sinful and immoral in violation of their most deeply held \nreligious beliefs. \n5.  Plaintiffs  urgently  need  relief  from  this  court.    Absent  an  injunction,  on \nSeptember 1, 2013, Plaintiffs will be forced to include abortion-inducing items in their health \ninsurance plan in violation of their religious beliefs.   \nIDENTIFICATION OF PARTIES \n6.

Trijicon is an industry-leading maker of aiming systems such as riflescopes and \nsights for tactical and sporting firearm applications.  \n24.  Founded in 1981, Trijicon quickly became world-renowned for its innovation of \ntritium and advanced fiber optics in its firearm aiming systems. \n6 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 7 of 29\n25.  Because of Trijicon’s history of innovation and excellence, it has become a major \nsupplier of the U.S. military, and especially the Special Forces, as well as state and local law \nenforcement.  \n26.  Trijicon also sells its products to U.S. allies, such as Britain and New Zealand, \nwhich consider Trijicon’s aiming systems to be the best in the world.  \n27.  Trijicon  also  manufacturers  sights  and  riflescopes  for  hunting  and  sporting \napplications for private citizens.  \nThe Bindons’ Religious Beliefs and Operation of Trijicon According to the Same \n28.  Trijicon was founded by Glyn Bindon, who led the company until his tragic death \nin a plane crash in 2003.  \n29.  Six of Glyn’s nine children are the sole shareholders of Trijicon.  \n30.  Glyn’s  son,  Stephen  Bindon,  owns  the  majority  of  the  voting  shares  in  the \ncompany.  \n31.  Glyn Bindon had a deep, Christian faith, which he imparted to his children, and \nwhich guided his founding and management of Trijicon.  \n32.  Glyn’s  children,  the  shareholders  of  Trijicon,  strive to  follow  their  Christian \nbeliefs in all aspects of their lives, including how they operate Trijicon. \n33.  The Bindons sincerely believe that their Christian faith does not allow them to \nviolate  Biblical  teachings  on  morality  or  ethics  when  they  make  decisions  as  owners  and \noperators of Trijicon. \n34.  The  Bindons  believe  that  operating  their  business  in  accordance  with  their \nreligious beliefs is a genuine calling from God, that Christian teaching prohibits them from \nsevering their religious beliefs from their daily business practice, and that Christian teaching \n7 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 8 of 29\nrequires them to integrate the virtues, morals, and ethical principles of the Bible into their life \nand work. \n35.  For example, one of Trijicon’s five “Values” is “Morality,” which is defined as \nfollows: “We believe that America is great when its people are good.  This goodness has been \nbased on biblical standards throughout our history and we will strive to follow these morals.”   \n36.  The Bindons provide a Chaplain Assistance Program as a voluntary benefit for all \nemployees.   \n37.   The Trijicon benefit guide describes the Chaplain Program as follows: “The \nChaplain offers confidential meetings and support in many areas including hospital visitation, \nstress  management,  divorce,  serious  illness,  drug  and  alcohol  dependency,  long  term  grief \nsupport and more.  The Chaplain will visit Trijicon at least weekly and strives to make contact \nwith each employee during the visit.  The Chaplain is also available 24 hours a day 7 days a \nweek.” \n38.  Under  the  Bindons’  direction,  Trijicon  donates  10%  of  its  annual  profits  to \nChristian charities, based on a vote of its shareholders.  Common recipients of these donations \ninclude evangelical ministries like Focus on the Family, and Christian adoption agencies that \nprovide  pregnant  mothers  a  life-affirming  alternative  to  abortion,  like  Bethany  Christian \nServices.  The shareholders also vote to donate funds to several other pro-life ministries and \nevents each year.       \n39.   Glyn Bindon began the practice of etching Bible references on the company’s \nproducts over 30 years ago, as a reflection of the Christian values of the company and its owner. \n40.  Trijicon continues to etch Biblical references on all consumer products to this \nday, except those products made specifically for use by the military.   \n8 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 9 of 29\n41.  Trijicon funds and participates in prayer breakfasts for Christian-run businesses at \ntrade shows they attend.  The purpose of these breakfasts is to gather like-minded representatives \nof other businesses so that they can pray together and discuss the importance of operating their \nbusinesses on the basis of Biblical values and in a manner that honors and glorifies God.   \nTrijicon’s Health Insurance Plan \n42.  Under the Bindons’ direction, and as part of fulfilling Trijicon’s organizational \nvalues, Trijicon provides generous health insurance for its employees. \n43.  Trijicon has 257 full-time employees, approximately 212 of whom have elected to \nbe covered under Trijicon’s health insurance plan.  \n44.  Trijicon contracted with Alliance Health and Life Insurance (AHL) to provide its \ncurrent insurance plan.   \n45.  The plan year for Trijicon’s current health insurance plan begins on September 1 \nof every year, with the next plan year starting on September 1, 2013. \n46.  Pursuant to their sincerely held religious beliefs, Trijicon and the Bindons believe \nthat life begins at conception/fertilization and that any method that functions to prevent or disrupt \nimplantation of a fertilized human embryo is morally wrong and results in the wrongful taking of \na human life.    \n47.  Pursuant  to  Trijicon’s  and  the  Bindons’  religious  beliefs,  Trijicon’s  current \ninsurance plan does not cover “voluntary termination of pregnancy.”  \n48.  Pursuant to Trijicon’s and the Bindons’ religious beliefs, Trijicon has consistently \ninstructed its insurance carrier not to include services related to the voluntary termination of a \npregnancy in the company’s health insurance plan.   \n9 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 10 of 29\n49.  In making this demand, Trijicon’s intent was to ensure that, among other things, \nabortifacient items, such as Plan B and ella, would not be covered. \n50.  Trijicon  learned  in  July  2013  that  the  “voluntary  termination  of  pregnancy” \nexclusion did not include certain abortifacient items because some insurance carriers include \nsuch items under the category of contraceptives, which Trijicon’s plan generally covered.   Until \nthat time, Trijicon was unaware that these abortifacient items were being covered by their plan \nand believed they were not.   \n51.  Upon  learning  this  information,  Trijicon  immediately  voiced  its  religious \nobjection to the inclusion of these abortion-inducing items in its plan and requested that they be \nremoved from the plan starting September 1, 2013.   \n52.  Trijicon’s insurance carrier responded by informing Trijicon that it, like all other \ninsurance  carriers,  was  required  to  comply  with  the  Mandate  and  that  Trijicon’s  plan \ncommencing on September 1, 2013 would therefore include the abortion-inducing items to \nwhich Plaintiffs religiously object.   \n53.  Plaintiffs  immediately  explored  its  options  to  seek  an  injunction  against \nenforcement of the Mandate, which other religious employers have successfully secured, before \nthe start of its next plan year.   \n54.  The need for injunctive relief to issue is immediate.   \n55.  Absent an injunction, on September 1, 2013, Plaintiffs will be forced to include \nabortion-inducing items in their health insurance plan in violation of their religious beliefs.  \n56.  If Trijicon receives an injunction, Plaintiffs would be able to obtain a plan that \nomits abortifacient items. \n10 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 11 of 29\n57.  Trijicon’s insurance plan is not subject to a Michigan state requirement to cover \ncontraception including abortifacients. \nThe ACA and Defendants’ Mandate Thereunder \n58.  Under the ACA, employers with over 50 full-time employees are required to \nprovide a certain minimum level of health insurance to their employees. \n59.  Many such plans must include “preventive services,” which must be offered with \nno cost-sharing by the employee. \n60.  On February 10, 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services finalized a \nrule (previously referred to in this Complaint as “the Mandate”) that imposes a definition of \npreventive services to include all FDA-approved “contraceptive” items, surgical sterilization, and \neducation and counseling for such services. \n61.  This final rule was adopted without giving due weight to the tens of thousands of \npublic comments submitted to HHS in opposition to the Mandate. \n62.  In the category of “FDA-approved contraceptives” included in the Mandate are \nseveral  drugs  or  devices  that  may  cause  the  demise  of  an  already-conceived  but  not-yet- \nimplanted human embryo, such as “emergency contraception” or “Plan B” drugs (the so-called \n“morning after” pill) as well as IUDs. \n63.  The FDA approved in this same “contraception” category a drug called “ella” (the \nso-called “week after” pill), which studies show can function to kill embryos even after they \nhave implanted in the uterus, by a mechanism similar to the abortion drug RU-486. \n64.  The manufacturers of some such drugs, methods, and devices in the category of \n“FDA-approved contraceptive methods” indicate that they can function to cause the demise of an \nearly human embryo.  \n11 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 12 of 29\n65.  The Defendants admit that Plan B, ella, and IUDs can function in part to cause the \ndemise of the embryo after its fertilization and before its implantation.  \n66.  The Mandate also requires applicable group health care plans to pay for the \nprovision of counseling, education, and other information for all women beneficiaries who are \ncapable of bearing children concerning and in support of covered devices and drugs, including \nPlan B, Ella, and IUDs that cause early abortions or harm to human embryos. \n67.  The  Mandate  applies  to  Trijicon’s  September  2012  –  August  2013  health \ninsurance plan year. \n68.  An entity cannot escape the Mandate by self-insuring. \n69.  Absent relief from this Court, Plaintiffs are subject to the Mandate’s requirement \nof coverage of the above-described items starting in their September 1, 2013 plan. \n70.  Plaintiffs have a sincere and deeply-held religious objection to providing coverage \nfor abortifacients and related education and counseling in Trijicon’s health insurance plan. \n71.  Plaintiffs cannot in good conscience violate their religious beliefs by providing \ncoverage for emergency contraception, IUDs, or counseling or education in furtherance of the \nsame, in Trijicon’s health insurance plan, including starting on September 1, 2013. \n72.  The Mandate therefore imminently threatens to impose its heavy penalties, fines, \nand lawsuits against Trijicon in violation of the beliefs and rights of Trijicon and its owners. \n73.  The Mandate makes little or no allowance for the religious freedom of entities and \nindividuals, including Trijicon and its owners, who object to paying for or providing insurance \ncoverage for such items. \n12 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 13 of 29\n74.  An entity cannot freely avoid the Mandate by simply refusing to provide health \ninsurance to its employees, because the ACA imposes monetary penalties on entities that would \nso refuse. \n75.  The exact magnitude of these penalties may vary according to the complicated \nprovisions  of  the  ACA,  but  the  fine  is  approximately  $2,000 pe r  employee  per  year  for \nemployers such as Trijicon.   \n76.  In addition, if Trijicon dropped insurance for its employees, such an action would \nnot only harm Trijicon’s employees, but it would harm Trijicon financially and it would harm \nTrijicon’s ability to retain and attract qualified employees. \n77.  The ACA also threatens monetary penalties against Trijicon for continuing to \noffer its insurance plan but continuing to omit abortifacients.   \n78.  The exact magnitude of these penalties may vary according to the complicated \nprovisions of the ACA, but the fine is approximately $100 per day per employee, with minimum \namounts applying in different circumstances. \n79.  If Plaintiffs do not submit to the Mandate then they also trigger a range of \nenforcement mechanisms, including but not limited to civil actions by the Secretary of Labor or \nby plan participants and beneficiaries under ERISA, which would include but not be limited to \nrelief in the form of judicial orders mandating that Trijicon violate its and its owners’ sincerely \nheld religious beliefs by providing coverage for items to which they religiously object. \n80.  The lawsuit penalties that the Mandate triggers under ERISA are in no way \nspeculative since Defendants Secretary Perez and the Department of Labor intend to fully and \nimminently enforce the Mandate against Trijicon. \n13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 14 of 29\n81.  The Mandate applies not only to employers, but also to issuers of insurance. \nAccordingly,  Trijicon  cannot  avoid  the  Mandate  by s hopping  for  an  insurance  plan  that \naccommodates their right of conscience, because Defendants have intentionally foreclosed that \npossibility. \n82.  The Mandate does not apply equally to all religious adherents or groups. \n83.  The Mandate offers the possibility of a narrow exemption to religious employers, \nbut only if it “is a church, an integrated auxiliary of a church, a convention or association of \nchurches, or is an exclusively religious activity of a religious order, under Internal Revenue Code \n6033(a)(1) and (a)(3)(A).” \n84.  Trijicon  does  not  qualify  under  this  definition  because  it  is  not  a  church, \nintegrated  auxiliary  of  a  particular  church,  convention  or  association  of  a  church,  or  the \nexclusively religious activities of a religious order.  \n85.  The ACA and the Mandate grant unbridled discretion to the government to create \nor modify this “religious employer” definition. \n86.  The ACA and the Mandate grant unbridled discretion to the government to give \nexemptions to some, all, or none of the organizations meeting the Mandate’s four-part definition \nof “religious employers” or any future definition.  \n87.  The Mandate picks and chooses among religions, religious believers and religious \ndoctrines, including on the issue of what constitutes religion and religious exercise. \n88.  The Mandate is not neutral towards religion because it allows exemptions based \non religious criteria, and it refuses those exemptions to Trijicon. \n14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 15 of 29\n89.  The Mandate fails to protect the statutory and constitutional conscience rights of \nreligious Americans like Trijicon and its owners, even though those rights were repeatedly raised \nin public comments against the Mandate’s regulations.   \n90.  The Mandate requires that Trijicon provide coverage for abortifacient methods, \nand education and counseling related to the same, in violation of the religious beliefs of Trijicon \nand its owners, in a manner that is contrary to law.   \n91.  The  Mandate  constitutes  government-imposed  coercion  on  Trijicon  and  its \nowners to change or violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n92.  The Mandate exposes Trijicon to draconian fines and other penalties for refusal to \nchange or violate its and its owners’ religious beliefs. \n93.  The  Mandate  will  impose  a  burden  on  Trijicon’s  employee  recruitment  and \nretention efforts by creating uncertainty as to whether or on what terms they will be able to \ncontinue offering health insurance due to the prospect of suffering penalties as a result of the \nMandate. \n94.  The Mandate will have a profound and adverse effect on Trijicon and how it \nnegotiates contracts and compensates its employees. \n95.  Trijicon has already expended considerable time and expense determining the \napplication of the Mandate against its religious beliefs and its options in relation thereto. \n96.  Unless relief issues from this Court, Trijicon is forced to take the Mandate into \naccount now as it plans expenditures, including employee contracts, compensation and benefits \npackages, as well as potential government fines and lawsuits, for the September 1, 2013 plan \nyear and into the future.  \n15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 16 of 29\n97.  The ACA and the Mandate are not generally applicable because they provide for \nnumerous exemptions from their rules.  \n98.  For instance, the Mandate does not apply to members of a “recognized religious \nsect or division” that conscientiously objects to acceptance of public or private insurance funds. \nSee 26 U.S.C. §§ 5000A(d)(2)(a)(i) and (ii).  Trijicon does not meet this exemption. \n99.  In  addition,  as  described  above,  the  Mandate  exempts  certain  churches  and \nreligious orders narrowly considered to be religious employers.  Trijicon does not meet this \nexemption. \n100.  The Mandate also offers an “accommodation” to certain non-profit entities, which \ncauses payments for the mandated items in ways that are different than the application of the \nMandate to Trijicon, and in ways that Defendants claim do not require the non-profit entities to \narrange, refer, contract or pay for the coverage.  This “accommodation” is not available to \nTrijicon because it is not a non-profit entity. \n101.  Furthermore, the ACA creates a system of individualized exemptions because \nunder the ACA’s authorization the federal government has granted discretionary compliance \nwaivers to a variety of businesses for purely secular reasons. \n102.  Also, the ACA and its Mandate do not force employers having fewer than 50 full-\ntime employees to provide a health insurance plan to its employees at all.     \n103.  Defendants have also unilaterally suspended or delayed portions of the ACA such \nas certain employer reporting requirements.  This demonstrates that Defendants have unfettered \ndiscretion to decide not to apply their rules in circumstances they consider appropriate, and that \nDefendants are content to allow some women to not receive the Mandated coverage from their \n16 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 17 of 29\nemployers.  This delay does not benefit Trijicon, however, since it already offers generous health \ninsurance and dropping that plan would be harmful both to Trijicon and to its employees. \n104.  Additionally, the Mandate does not apply to employers with preexisting plans that \nare “grandfathered.” \n105.  Trijicon’s plan is not grandfathered under ACA, nor will its plan year starting on \nSeptember 1, 2013 have grandfathered status. \n106.  Trijicon’s plan lacks grandfathered status because, inter alia, the facts described \nin the following five paragraphs deprive the plan of such status according to the Defendants’ \nregulations governing grandfathered status. \n107.  For financial reasons, Trijicon’s September 1, 2010 PPO health insurance plan \nincreased  the  Emergency  Room  Copay  from  $50 t o  $75,  which  exceeded  the  allowable \nmaximum increase.  This increase exceeded the grandfathering limit.  \n108.  For financial reasons, Trijicon’s September 1, 2010 PPO health insurance plan \nincreased the prescription copayment from $10/$20 to $20/$50, which exceeded the allowable \nmaximum increases.  These increases exceeded the grandfathering limit. \n109.  For financial reasons, Trijicon’s September 1, 2010 HMO health insurance plan \nincreased  the  Emergency  Room  Copay  from  $50 t o  $75,  which  exceeded  the  allowable \nmaximum increase.  This increase exceeded the grandfathering limit.  \n110.  Due to the September 1, 2010 c hanges stated above, both of Trijicon’s offered \nhealth insurance plans, its PPO and HMO plans, lack grandfathered status.  \n111.  Neither  Trijicon,  its  plan  administrator,  nor  its  September  2012–13  health \ninsurance plan provided a disclosure to plan participants that the plan possessed grandfathered \nstatus under ACA (because the plan did not possess such status).   \n17 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 18 of 29\n112.  According to the government’s statistics, tens of millions of American women in \n2013 will be covered under plans where, because they possess grandfathered status, the ACA and \nDefendants do not subject those plans to the requirements of the Mandate. \n113.  Despite Defendants’ and the ACA’s choice not to impose the Mandate and its \nrequired items to tens of millions of American women in grandfathered plans, Defendants refuse \nto allow Trijicon’s plan with fewer than 300 employees to be exempt from the Mandate. \n114.  On February 10, 2012, a document was issued from the Center for Consumer \nInformation  and  Insurance  Oversight  (CCIIO),  Centers  for  Medicare  &  Medicaid  Services \n(CMS), of HHS, entitled “Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain \nEmployers,  Group  Health  Plans  and  Group  Health  Insurance  Issuers  with  Respect  to  the \nRequirement to Cover Contraceptive Services Without Cost Sharing Under Section 2713 of the \nPublic Health Service Act, Section 715(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, \nand Section 9815(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code.” \n115.  Under this “Guidance,” an organization that truthfully declares “I certify that the \norganization  is  organized  and  operated  as  a  non-profit  entity;  and  that,  at  any  point  from  \nFebruary 10, 2012 onward, contraceptive coverage has not been provided by the plan, consistent \nwith any applicable State law, because of the religious beliefs of the organization,” and that \nprovides a specified notice to plan participants, will not “be subject to any enforcement action by \nthe Departments for failing to cover recommended contraceptive services without cost sharing in \nnon-exempted,  non-grandfathered  group  health  plans  established  or  maintained  by a n \norganization, including a group or association of employers within the meaning of section 3(5) of \nERISA, (and any group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans),” \nuntil “the first plan year that begins on or after August 1, 2013.” \n18 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 19 of 29\n116.  The  February  10, 2012 “ safe  harbor”  was  recently  extended  so  that  it \nencompasses plans beginning before January 1, 2014.   \n117.  The  February  10, 2012 “ Guidance”  and  its  recent  extension  categorically \ndisqualifies Trijicon from making use of this “extra year and a half” because, among other \nreasons, Trijicon is not a non-profit entity and further because it objects only to the provision of \nabortifacient contraceptives. \n118.  On August 15, 2012, in response to litigation against the Mandate that illustrated  \nthe February 10, 2012 press conference “Guidance” was sloppily drafted and omitted a variety of \norganizations, Defendants used their unfettered discretion over the Mandate to issue yet another \nversion of the “safe harbor” Guidance.   \n119.  Under the August 15, 2012 “Guidance,” employers who object to some but not all \ncontraception could be covered, but the “safe harbor” was still limited to non-profit entities. \n120.  Thus the August 15, 2012 “Guidance” also continues to categorically disqualify \nTrijicon from making use of this “extra year” because, among other reasons, Trijicon is not a \nnon-profit entity. \n121.  Through their “safe harbor” Guidances, Defendants have essentially granted what \nthey consider to be the equivalent of preliminary injunctions to potentially hundreds or thousands \nof non-profit corporate entities that possess exactly the same objection that Trijicon possesses. \n122.  If Trijicon qualified for the “safe harbor,” Defendants would not enforce the \nMandate against Trijicon until the beginning of its September 1, 2014, plan year. \n123.  The ACA and the Mandate confer unfettered discretion upon Defendants to create \nand modify rules such as the Guidances with respect to their categorization and treatment of \nreligious entities. \n19 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 20 of 29\n124.  The Mandate, Defendants’ “Guidances,” their multiple federal regulations on this \nMandate, and their four-part “religious employer” definition in its various changing forms, all \nomit Trijicon from any protection from the Mandate, despite Trijicon and its owners desire to \noperate Trijicon according to their sincerely held religious beliefs.   \n125.  Therefore,  while  President  Obama’s  and  Defendants’  ever-changing \n“compromises” purport to accommodate the religious beliefs of a variety of groups, none of \nthese measures will stop the Mandate from being imposed on Trijicon’s September 1, 2013 plan \nyear. \n126.  Any  alleged  interest  Defendants  have  in  providing  free  FDA-approved \nabortifacient contraception and related education and counseling without cost-sharing could be \nadvanced through other, more narrowly tailored mechanisms that do not burden the religious \nbeliefs of Trijicon and its owners and do not require them to provide or facilitate coverage of \nsuch items through Trijicon’s health plan. \n127.  The  federal  government  provides  massive  coverages  and  subsidies  of \ncontraception for women who cannot afford it, without forcing their employers to participate. \n128.  Unless  relief  issues  from  this  Court,  the  Mandate  directly  and  imminently \nthreatens Trijicon with its draconian penalties. \n129.  Without  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  as  requested  herein,  including \npreliminary injunctive relief, Trijicon and its owners are suffering and will continue to suffer \nirreparable harm. \n130.  Trijicon and its owners have no adequate remedy at law.   \n \n \n20 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 21 of 29\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb \n \n131.  Trijicon realleges all matters set forth in paragraphs 1–130 and incorporates them \nherein by reference.  \n132.  Trijicon’s and its owners’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them from \nproviding  coverage  for  abortifacients,  including  “emergency  contraception”  and  IUDs  and \nrelated education and counseling, in Trijicon’s employee health plan. \n133.  When Trijicon and its owners comply with their sincerely held biblical principles \nand Christian beliefs on abortifacients such as emergency contraception and IUDs, they exercise \nreligion within the meaning of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \n134.  The Mandate imposes a substantial burden on Trijicon’s and its owners’ religious \nexercise and coerces them to change or violate their sincerely held religious beliefs, or be subject \nto penalties and harm to their property and livelihood.  \n135.  The  Mandate  chills  Trijicon’s  and  its  owners’  religious  exercise  within  the \nmeaning of RFRA. \n136.  The  Mandate  exposes  Trijicon  to  lawsuits,  substantial  fines,  and  financial \nburdens, and pressures Trijicon and its owners by threatening their property and livelihood based \non their religious exercise. \n137.  The Mandate exposes Trijicon to substantial competitive disadvantages because \nof uncertainties about Trijicon’s health insurance benefits caused by the Mandate.  \n138.  The Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest and is not narrowly \ntailored to any compelling governmental interest. \n21 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 22 of 29\n139.  The Mandate is not the least restrictive means of furthering Defendants’ stated \ninterests. \n140.  The Mandate violates RFRA.   \nWHEREFORE, Trijicon prays for the relief set forth below. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment \nto the United States Constitution \n \n141.  Trijicon realleges all matters set forth in paragraphs 1–130 and incorporates them \nherein by reference.  \n142.  Trijicon’s and its owners’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them from \nproviding  coverage  for  abortifacients,  including  “emergency  contraception”  and  IUDs  and \nrelated education and counseling, in Trijicon’s employee health plan. \n143.  When Trijicon and its owners comply with their sincerely held biblical principles \nand Christian beliefs on abortifacients such as emergency contraception and IUDs, they exercise \nreligion pursuant to the Free Exercise Clause. \n144.  The Mandate is not neutral and is not generally applicable. \n145.  Defendants have created categorical exemptions and individualized exemptions to \nthe Mandate.  \n146.  The Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest.  \n147.  Defendants have conceded the lack of a compelling interest in the Mandate by \nvirtue of their and ACA’s voluntary exclusion and exemption of millions of Americans from the \nMandate’s coverage. \n148.  The Mandate is not the least restrictive means of furthering Defendants’ purported \ninterests.  \n22 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 23 of 29\n149.  The Mandate chills Trijicon’s and its owners’ religious exercise.  \n150.  The  Mandate  exposes  Trijicon  to  lawsuits,  substantial  fines,  and  financial \nburdens, and pressures Trijicon and its owners by threatening their property and livelihood based \non their religious exercise.  \n151.  The Mandate exposes Trijicon to substantial competitive disadvantages because \nof uncertainties about Trijicon’s health insurance benefits caused by the Mandate.   \n152.  The Mandate imposes a substantial burden on Trijicon’s and its owners’ religious \nexercise and coerces them to change or violate their sincerely held religious beliefs, or be subject \nto penalties and harm to their property and livelihood. \n153.  The Mandate is not narrowly tailored to any compelling governmental interest.  \n154.  By design, Defendants framed the Mandate to apply to some religious Americans \nbut not to others, resulting in discrimination among religions.  \n155.  Defendants have created exemptions to the Mandate for some religious believers \nbut not others based on characteristics of their beliefs and their religious exercise. \n156.  Defendants designed the Mandate, the religious employer exemption thereto, and \nthe “compromise” and guidance allowances thereto, in a way that makes it impossible for \nTrijicon and other similar religious Americans to comply with their sincerely held religious \nbeliefs.  \n157.  Defendants  promulgated  both  the  Mandate  and  the  religious \nexemption/allowances with the purpose and intent to suppress the religious exercise of Trijicon \nand its owners and other religious Americans.  \n158.  The Mandate violates Trijicon’s and its owners’ rights secured to them by the \nFree Exercise Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.   \n23 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 24 of 29\nWHEREFORE, Trijicon prays for the relief set forth below. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of the Establishment Clause of the \nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution \n \n159.  Trijicon realleges all matters set forth in paragraphs 1–130 and incorporates them \nherein by reference.  \n160.  The First Amendment’s Establishment Clause prohibits the establishment of any \nreligion and/or excessive government entanglement with religion. \n161.  The Mandate discriminates among religions and among denominations, favoring \nsome over others, and exhibits hostility to religious beliefs. \n162.  The  Mandate  discriminates  against  and  among  religions  in  refusing  to \naccommodate  or  exempt  a  company  that  follows  religious  beliefs,  while  exempting  or \naccommodating others.  \n163.  The Mandate violates Trijicon’s and its owners’ rights secured to them by the \nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.   \nWHEREFORE, Trijicon prays for the relief set forth below. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment \nto the United States Constitution \n \n164.  Trijicon realleges all matters set forth in paragraphs 1–130 and incorporates them \nherein by reference.  \n165.  Defendants’ requirement of provision of insurance coverage for education and \ncounseling regarding abortifacient drugs and devices such as “emergency contraception” and \nIUDs forces Trijicon and its owners to speak and fund speech in a manner contrary to their \nreligious beliefs. \n24 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 25 of 29\n166.  Defendants have no narrowly tailored compelling interest to justify this compelled \nspeech. \n167.  The Mandate violates Trijicon’s and its owners’ rights secured to them by the \nFree Speech Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. \nWHEREFORE, Trijicon prays for the relief set forth below. \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n \n168.  Trijicon realleges all matters set forth in paragraphs 1–130 and incorporates them \nherein by reference. \n169.  Because the Mandate sweepingly infringes upon religious exercise and speech \nrights that are constitutionally protected, it is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in violation \nof the due process rights of Trijicon and its owners and other parties not before the Court. \n170.  This Mandate lends itself to discriminatory enforcement by government officials \nin an arbitrary and capricious manner. \n171.  The ACA and the Mandate vest Defendants with unbridled discretion in deciding \nwhether to allow exemptions to some, all, or no organizations, in crafting “religious employer” \nexemptions and changing the same, in crafting and modifying further “accommodations” and \nadditional definitions of entities that qualify for the same, and in enforcing the Mandate and \ncrafting rules regarding the same such as through its repeatedly issued enforcement “Guidances.” \n172.  The Mandate is an unconstitutional violation of Trijicon’s and its owners’ due \nprocess rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \nWHEREFORE, Trijicon prays for the relief set forth below. \n \n25 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 26 of 29\nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n \n173.  Trijicon realleges all matters set forth in paragraphs 1–130 and incorporates them \nherein by reference. \n174.  As  set  forth  above,  the  Mandate  violates  RFRA  and  the  First  and  Fifth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution.  \n175.  The Mandate is also contrary to the provisions of the ACA which states that \n“nothing  in  this  title”—i.e.,  title  I  of  the  Act,  which  includes  the  provision  dealing  with \n“preventive services”—“shall be construed to require a qualified health plan to provide coverage \nof [abortion] services . . . as part of its essential health benefits for any plan year.” Section \n1303(b)(1)(A).  Some items included as “FDA-approved contraceptives” under the Mandate \ncause abortions by causing the demise of human embryos before and/or after implantation.  By \nExecutive Order, this provision prohibits Defendants from requiring abortion in Trijicon’s plan. \n176.  The Mandate is also contrary to the provisions of the Weldon Amendment of the \nConsolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act of 2009, Public \nLaw 110 329, Div. A, Sec. 101, 122 Stat. 3574, 3575 ( Sept. 30, 2008), which provides that \n“[n]one  of  the  funds  made  available  in  this  Act  [making  appropriations  for  Defendants \nDepartment of Labor and Health and Human Services] may be made available to a Federal \nagency or program . . . i f such agency, program, or government subjects any institutional or \nindividual health care entity to discrimination on the basis that the health care entity does not \nprovide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.”  \n177.  The Mandate also violates the provisions of the Church Amendment, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 300a-7(d), which provides that “No individual shall be required to perform or assist in the \nperformance of any part of a health service program or research activity funded in whole or in \n26 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 27 of 29\npart  under  a  program  administered  by t he  Secretary  of  Health  and  Human  Services  if  his \nperformance or assistance in the performance of such part of such program or activity would be \ncontrary to his religious beliefs or moral convictions.” \n178.  The Mandate is contrary to existing law and is in violation of the APA under 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A)f. \nWHEREFORE, Trijicon prays for the relief set forth below. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTrijicon respectfully requests the following relief:   \nA.  That this Court enter a judgment declaring the Mandate and its application to \nTrijicon  and  its  insurer,  and  others  similarly  situated  but  not  before  the  Court,  to  be  an \nunconstitutional and illegal violation of Trijicon’s, its owners’, and others’ rights protected by \nRFRA, the Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution, and the Administrative Procedure Act, and therefore invalid in any way \napplicable to them;  \nB.  That this Court enter a preliminary and a permanent injunction and declaratory \nrelief prohibiting the Mandate from being applied to or considered applicable to Trijicon and its \nplan and others similarly situated but not before the Court in a way that substantially burdens the \nreligious  beliefs  of  Trijicon  and  its  owners,  or  any  person,  in  violation  of  RFRA  and  the \nConstitution,  and  prohibiting  Defendants  from  continuing  to  illegally  discriminate  against \nTrijicon and others not before the Court by requiring them to provide or cause to be provided \nhealth insurance coverage for abortifacients, contraception, sterilization and related education \nand counseling to employees of entities they own or operate;   \n27 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01207-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/05/13   Page 28 of 29\nC.   That this Court award Trijicon court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, as \nprovided by the Equal Access to Justice Act and RFRA (as provided in 42 U.S.C. § 1988);  \nD.   That this Court grant such other and further relief as to which Trijicon may be \nentitled. \nTrijicon demands a jury on all issues so triable. \n \n \nRespectfully submitted this 5th day of August, 2013.  \n \nAttorneys for Plaintiffs: \n                 s/ Matthew S.
