The plaintiff, represented by private counsel and with permission from the EEOC, asked the court for declaratory judgment, compensatory and punitive damages and attorney's fees. </p><p>The complaint alleged that the defendant discriminated against plaintiff by requiring only the plaintiff, because of his cardiovascular disability, to undergo a vigorous physical as a condition of his employment in violation of state and federal employment law and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant had appointed plaintiff to the position of Assistant Harbormaster, but discriminated against him when it, with knowledge of his cardiovascular condition, required that the plaintiff undergo a rigorous physical examination as a precondition of employment, which no other employee had been subject to.</p><p>There was little activity in the case over the next two years.</p><p>On September 29, 2010, the parties settled for $15,000 in attorney's fees and $7,000 in damages. The defendant did not admit any fault or wrongdoing. The District Court (Judge William E. Smith) dismissed the case with prejudice on October 5, 2010.</p>",

Considerations ofjudicial economy, convenience and fairness to the litigants warrant\nexercise ofthis Court's supplementaljurisdiction over Plaintiffs state law claims. Plaintiffs state\nclaims are so related to Plaintiffs federal claims that they form part ofthe same case or\ncontroversy.\nPARTIES\n5. Plaintiff, Michael 1. Damiani (\"Plaintiff') is a citizen ofthe United States and a\nresident ofthe City ofEast Providence, State ofRhode Island.\n6.

Civil Rights ofPeople with Disabilities Act. Specificallythe Commission found that the\nPlaintiffhad proven that he was subjected to disparatetreatment on the basis ofdisability or\nperceived disability.\n9.

Moreover,\nPlaintiff's cardiovascular condition constituted a serious medical illness because it required the\ntype oftreatment contemplated by applicable law.\n15. Priorto April 17,2007 there was no requirementthat Assistant Harbormasters\nundergo \"rigorous\" physical examinations priorto appointment. Moreover, the position of\nHarbormaster/AssistantHarbormasterhas no physical requirements inthe City Charter.\n16.
