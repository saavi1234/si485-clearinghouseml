The Court will not require Plaintiffs to refile the exhibits already on file; however, these amended briefs must use the citation format detailed above to facilitate the Court's use of its new hyperlink program. Plaintiffs should not substantively amend their brief other than to add citations in accordance with this Order. Similarly, in the responsive briefing by Defendants they, too, should provide both proper labeling of exhibits and citations in the format detailed above. In order to cite in this manner, the exhibits will have to be filed in advance of the brief so that docket citation will be available.

The parties appeared by counsel for an Initial Pretrial Conference. The Court will approve the Case Management Plan, by separate order, with the changes to which the parties have agreed.Defendant contends this matter should be dismissed and discovery herein stayed pending a ruling on Defendant's motion to dismiss. However, the pendency of Plaintiff's Motion for Class Certification [Dkt. 3] will not allow the Court to accommodate that request. Accordingly, the Court orders as follows: 1.Defendant shall respond to Plaintiff's Complaint (the Court anticipates a motion to dismiss will be filed) on or before November 1, 2013. Plaintiff shall respond to such motion on or before November 8, 2013 and Defendant shall file any reply in support of the motion on or before November 14, 2013. 2. Any prior stays of this matter are lifted and discovery in this matter shall proceed forthwith. To facilitate the discovery process, any responses to interrogatories, requests for production and/or requests for admission under Rules 33, 34 and/or 36 shall be served within 25 days after the request is served (the Court anticipates that the 3 additional days provided by Rule 6(d) will still apply when appropriate). Any written discovery and any responses thereto shall be served by either hand delivery or electronic mail with telephonic confirmation of receipt. Any voluminous documents produced that are not susceptible to transmission by electronic mail shall be produced by hand delivery or via an overnight delivery service. In the event either party files a motion to stay discovery, discovery shall not be stayed and shall proceed pursuant to this order until an order on such motion is issued. Likewise, no discovery deadlines stall be extended unless an order to that effect has been sought and obtained prior to the expiration of the deadline. 3. Plaintiff shall file a supplemental brief in support of her Motion for Class Certification [Dkt. 3] on or before January 24, 2014. Defendant shall respond to that motion on or before February 11, 2014 and Plaintiff shall file any reply in support of the motion on or before February 18,2014. 4.The requirement in Dkt.

    "summary": "<p>On June 14, 2013, a disabled adult beneficiary of a state-run Medicaid waiver program who was also on a waitlist for another Medicaid waiver program filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The plaintiff sued the Secretary of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration and two heads of divisions of that agency in their official capacities under the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3), 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Americans with Disabilities Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq. and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. The plaintiff, represented by the ACLU of Indiana, asked the court for both declaratory and injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs, and class action certification. </p><p>The plaintiff alleged that the defendant violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the \"integration mandate\" of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by changing its eligibility requirements for Medicaid waiver programs and by not allowing an appeal from the policy change as required by the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant [1] removed the waitlist for the Indiana's Community Integration and Habilitation Medicaid Waiver Program and established new \"priority criteria\" that limited access to the program that many and [2] instituted a new policy for Indiana's Aged and Disabled Medicaid Waiver Program and its Traumatic Brain Injury Medicaid Waiver Program require recipients to require \"a nursing facility level of care.\" The plaintiff claimed both of these actions violated the \"integration mandate\" because they deprived disabled persons of the assistance they need to be integrated into the community. The plaintiff further claimed that the defendant failed to inform plaintiff that she could appeal her removal from the waitlist under the Medicaid Act and that the defendant provided no means for securing such an appeal.</p><p>On June 14, 2013, the plaintiff moved to have the case certified as a class action. That same day, the plaintiff also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction requesting that defendant be enjoined from removing plaintiff from the Aged and Disabled Medicaid Waiver Program pending further order of the court. The preliminary injunction was withdrawn without prejudice on September 23, 2013.</p><p>On March 24, 2014, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. 2014 WL 1213390 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 24, 2014). </p><p>On June 26, 2014, the court dismissed the original named plaintiff's individual claims because they had become moot--she received a waiver--but she still retained the right to appeal the denial of class certification. The individual claims of intervening plaintiffs still remained. </p><p>Later in 2014, the defendants and the plaintiffs both moved for summary judgment. On Mar 27, 2015, the US filed a statement of interest in opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment. In May 2015, the court heard oral argument on the motions for summary judgment. </p><p>On May 28, 2015, the court dismissed another one of the individual plaintiff's claims because they had become moot--he received a waiver. He also reserved the right to appeal the denial of class certification. </p><p>On June 9, 2015, the court granted summary judgment to the defendants. The court concluded that the plaintiffs’ integration mandate claims were not ripe for review. The integration mandate focuses on the setting in which services are administered, not the amount of services received. The plaintiffs did not contend that the setting in which they received services had changed as a result of Indiana's policy change.</p><p>Subsequently, the plaintiffs appealed the denial of class certification, the dismissal of the individual plaintiffs, and the grant of summary judgment to the Seventh Circuit. On May 10, 2016, the Seventh Circuit reversed the summary judgement and affirmed denial of class certification. The court found that the State's narrow reading of integration mandate was unwarranted and that there was no reason to interpret it as only applying to \"claims by people who literally have been institutionalized.\" The court held that \"setting\" does not necessarily refer merely to physical structures, finding that the text of the statute does not compel such a restrictive interpretation and that the integration mandate's protection would be undermined \"if plaintiffs were required to segregate themselves by entering an institution before they could challenge an allegedly discriminatory law or policy that threatens to force them into segregated isolation.\" Indeed, the court pointed out that Indiana's institutions do not have capacity for most people who could be institutionalized. The court also pointed to the purpose of the ADA, which was to prevent outright discrimination. Ultimately, the court held that \"the integration mandate is implicated where the state’s policies have either (1) segregated persons with disabilities within their homes, or (2) put them at serious risk of institutionalization.\" 823 F.3d 902.</p><p>The case then returned to the district court for further proceedings. On December 19, 2016, the parties filed a stipulation for dismissal after having reached a settlement, and the court ordered the case dismissed with prejudice the next day. The settlement agreement is not currently available. The case is now closed.</p>",

The court denied class certification and granted summary judgment to the defendants. The plaintiffs appealed, and the Seventh Circuit reversed the summary judgment.

[Filing No. 161.] Defendants contend that Mr. Keister's\nclaims are moot because he is now enrolled in a waiver program that provides him\nwith the services he seeks by way of this suit. [Filing No. 162 at 1−2.] Mr. Keister\nagrees that, in light of the Court's earlier denial of the Motion to Certify a Class, [see\nFiling No. 112], \"his individual claims are moot and that he may be dismissed as a\nplaintiff.\" [Filing No. 165 at 2.] In so conceding, however, \"Mr. Keister reserves his\nright to appeal the denial of his [Motion to Certify a Class] following final judgment in\nthis cause.\" [Filing No. 165 at 2 (citing U.S. Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S.\n388, 404 (1980)).] The Court agrees with the parties that Mr. Keister's claims are\nmoot, and therefore that this Court lacks subject−matter jurisdiction over his claims.\nSee Pakovich v. Verizon LTD Plan, 653 F.3d 488, 492 (7th Cir. 2011) (\"Federal courts\nlack subject matter jurisdiction when a case becomes moot.\"). Accordingly,\nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss Mr. Keister's claims is GRANTED. [Filing No. 161.]\nNo partial final judgment shall issue at this time. Signed by Judge Jane\nMagnus−Stinson on 5/28/2015.

In support of this Motion, the plaintiffs state as follows: \n1.  Karla Steimel brings this action on her own behalf and on behalf of three (3) classes of \npersons similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. \n2.  Class A is defined as follows: \nAny and all persons on the waiting list for Indiana’s Community Integration and \nHabilitation  Medicaid  Waiver  Program  (including  its  predecessor,  the \nDevelopmental Disabilities Medicaid Waiver Program) as of August 31, 2012, or \nwho will be or would otherwise be on the wait-list for that program but for the \nelimination of that wait-list, and who do not meet Indiana’s priority criteria for \nplacement  on  that  program  (described  in  paragraph  33  of  the  plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint). \n \n3.  Class B is defined as follows: \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 3   Filed 06/14/13   Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 77\nAny and all persons on the waiting list for Indiana’s Community Integration and \nHabilitation  Medicaid  Waiver  Program  (including  its  predecessor,  the \nDevelopmental Disabilities Medicaid Waiver Program) as of August 31, 2012. \n \n4.  Class C is defined as follows: \nAny and all persons enrolled in, or who will be enrolled in, Indiana’s Aged and \nDisabled Medicaid Waiver Program and/or its Traumatic Brain Injury Medicaid \nWaiver Program who (a) are developmentally disabled and/or under age eleven \n(11), (b) do not routinely require skilled nursing services for their conditions, (c) \nmeet nursing facility level of care as determined through the use of Indiana’s \nEligibility Screen (State Form 45528), and (d) are also determined to be eligible \nfor services through the Family Supports Medicaid Waiver Program. \n \n5.  As defined, each class is so numerous that the joinder of all members is impracticable.   \n6.  There are questions of law or fact common to the class, specifically: \n  -  as to Class A, whether the challenged elimination of the wait-list for the waiver \nand  corresponding  priority  criteria  for  obtaining  waiver  services  violate  the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and/or the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. \n   \n-  as to Class B, whether the failure to provide for an appeals process upon the \ntermination of the wait-list for the waiver violates 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). \n \n-  as  to  Class  C,  whether  the  elimination  of  persons’  eligibility  for  the  waiver \nprogram  violates  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  of  1990  and/or  the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.  \n \n5.  The claims of the representative party are typical of those of the each of the classes. \n6.  The representative party will fairly and adequately represent each of the classes. \n7.  The  further  requirements  of  Rule  23(b)(2)  are  met  in  that  the  parties  opposing  the \ncertification of each of the classes have, at all times, acted and refused to act on grounds \ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief and \ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \n8.  Undersigned counsel is skilled and experienced at this type of litigation, and should \ntherefore be appointed as class counsel for each of the classes pursuant to Rule 23(g) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 3   Filed 06/14/13   Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 78\n9.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA \nINDIANAPOLIS DIVISION \n \nKARLA STEIMEL, ON HER OWN BEHALF AND   )   \nON BEHALF OF A CLASS OF THOSE SIMILARLY   )   \nSITUATED,    )   \nPlaintiffs,   )  1:13-cv-957-JMS-MJD \n   ) \nvs.   ) \n   ) \nDEBRA MINOTT, IN HER OFFICIAL CAPACITY   ) \nAS SECRETARY OF THE INDIANA FAMILY AND   ) \nSOCIAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, ET AL.,    ) \n           Defendants.   ) \n \nORDER1 \nFor a number of years, the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (“FSSA”) \nhad a policy in place that allowed developmentally disabled individuals to receive Medicaid \nwaiver services through a waiver program for which they were ineligible.  To remedy this prob-\nlem, the FSSA changed its policy and began transitioning the inappropriately placed individuals \nto another waiver program designed to serve their needs.  This transition allegedly caused many \ndevelopmentally disabled individuals to face a reduction in services.  This suit challenges the \nFSSA’s policy change. \nPlaintiff Karla Steimel brings this action on behalf of herself and a class of those similar-\nly situated (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) against Defendants Debra Minott, Secretary of the Indiana \nFamily and Social Services Administration (“FSSA”); Nicole Norvell, Director of the Division \nof Disability and Rehabilitative Services of the FSSA; and Faith Laird, Director of the Division \nof Aging of the FSSA (collectively, “the State”), alleging violations of the Americans with Disa-\n                                                 \n1 As part of the Court’s pilot program regarding hyperlinking in Court filings, this Order contains \nhyperlinks to documents previously filed in this case, and to legal authority.  Instead of the cita-\ntion format “dkt. __ at __,” the Court now uses “Filing No. __, at ECF p. __” as its citation for-\nmat. \n- 1 - \n \n\nbilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  [Filing No. 1.]  Presently \npending before the Court are Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify Class, [Filing No. 3], and a Motion for \nPermissive Intervention and to Join in Pending Motion for Class Certification filed by Intervenor \nPlaintiffs Thomas Maertz, Colton Cole, Cody Cole, and Timothy Keister, [Filing No. 88].  The \nCourt held a hearing on these motions during which counsel for each side presented argument.  \n[See Filing No. 108.]  For the reasons that follow, the Court DENIES the Motion to Certify \nClass, [Filing No. 3], and GRANTS the Motion for Permissive Intervention and to Join in Pend-\ning Motion for Class Certification, [Filing No. 88]. \nI. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n \nIn deciding whether to certify a class, the Court may not blithely accept as true even the \nmost well-pleaded allegations of the complaint, but must instead “make whatever factual and le-\ngal inquiries are necessary under Rule 23” to resolve contested issues.  Szabo v. Bridgeport \nMachs., Inc., 249 F.3d 672, 676 (7th Cir. 2001); see Parko v. Shell Oil Co., 739 F.3d 1083, 1085 \n(7th Cir. 2014).  Specifically, the Court must find that the putative class satisfies the four prereq-\nuisites set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a).  If the putative class does satisfy these \nprerequisites, the Court must additionally find that it satisfies the requirements set forth in Feder-\nal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b), which vary depending upon which of three different types of \nclasses is proposed.  \nBefore addressing the Rule 23 factors, however, the Court must examine whether the \nproposed class members are sufficiently definite.  To do so, “[t]he plaintiff must . . . show . . . \nthat the class is indeed identifiable as a class.”  Oshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472 F.3d 506, 513 (7th \nCir. 2006).  When “there is no way to know or readily ascertain who is a member of the class,” \nthe class “lacks the definiteness required for class certification.”  Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Public \n- 2 - \n \n\nSchools, 668 F.3d 481, 495 (7th Cir. 2012).  If the class as defined is sufficiently definite, the \nCourt turns next the Rule 23(a) factors. \nIt is the plaintiff’s burden to prove that an identifiable class exists that qualifies for certi-\nfication under Rule 23(a).  Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513.  The four prerequisites under Rule 23(a) \nare: “(1) [that] the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) [that] \nthere are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) [that] the claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) [that] the repre-\nsentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a).  Class certification is not appropriate unless the named plaintiff establishes all four pre-\nrequisites.  Messner v. Northshore Univ. HealthSystem, 669 F.3d 802, 811 (7th Cir. 2012). \nIn addition to meeting the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), the proposed class must satisfy one \nof the conditions of Rule 23(b).  Messner, 669 F.3d at 811; Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513.  Under \nRule 23(b), a class action that satisfies Rule 23(a) may be sustained if one of the following is \ntrue: “(1) prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk \nof: (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; or (B) adjudications \nwith respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the \ninterests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudications or would substantially \nimpair or impede their ability to protect their interests; (2) the party opposing the class has acted \nor refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or cor-\nresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole; or (3) the court finds \nthat the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions af-\n- 3 - \n \n\nfecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for \nfairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1-3).   \nII. \nBACKGROUND \n \nThis case involves Medicaid waiver programs funded jointly by the federal government \nand the state of Indiana.  These programs allow states such as Indiana to waive certain federal \nMedicaid requirements.  See generally 42 U.S.C. § 1396n.  A subset of these programs—home-\nand-community-based waiver programs—“permit[] a State to furnish an array of home and \ncommunity-based services that assist Medicaid beneficiaries to live in the community and avoid \ninstitutionalization.”  [Filing No. 58-5, at ECF p. 8.]  The FSSA submits waivers for approval to \nthe United States Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”).  [Filing No. 58-2, at \nECF p. 4.]  Relevant to this litigation are three such waiver programs currently administered by \nthe FSSA: the Aged and Disabled Waiver (“A&D Waiver”), the Community Integration and Ha-\nbilitation Medicaid Waiver (“CIH Waiver”) and the Family Supports Medicaid Waiver (“FS \nWaiver”).  [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF p. 4; Filing No. 58-4, at ECF p. 4.]  The FSSA’s Division of \nAging administers the A&D Waiver, while the FSSA’s Bureau of Developmental Disabilities \nServices (“BDDS”) administers the CIH Waiver and the FS Waiver.  [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF p. \n4; Filing No. 58-4, at ECF p. 4.]  An individual may only be enrolled in (and thus receive ser-\nvices from) one waiver program at a time.  [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF p. 4.]   \nIndividuals enrolled in any of the waiver programs receive a case manager.  [Filing No. \n58-2, at ECF p. 6; Filing No. 58-4, at ECF p. 6.]  To determine both the type and amounts of ser-\nvices an enrollee will receive through the waiver program, the case manager, the enrollee, and \nthe enrollee’s guardian evaluate the enrollee’s particular circumstances to identify the enrollee’s \nspecific needs.  [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF p. 6; Filing No. 58-4, at ECF p. 6.]  The enrollee then \n- 4 - \n \n\nsubmits her plan to the appropriate administrating agency—either the Division of Aging or \nBDDS—which can either approve or deny the request for services.  [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF p. \n6; Filing No. 58-4, at ECF p. 6.]  An enrollee must have her requested services approved annual-\nly by the appropriate agency.  [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF p. 6; Filing No. 58-4, at ECF p. 6.]   \nA basic understanding of each waiver is necessary to understand the events underlying \nthis suit.  The A&D Waiver “provides an alternative to nursing facility admission for adults and \npersons of all ages with a disability,” specifically by providing services “for people who would \nrequire care in a nursing facility if waiver or other supports were not available.”  [Filing No. 58-\n5, at ECF p. 12.]   When an individual’s A&D Waiver plan is approved by the Division of Ag-\ning, she is provided a list of the A&D Waiver services approved and her waiver budget for that \nyear.   [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF p. 7.]  The approved services are reimbursed at rates set by the \nDivision of Aging.  [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF p. 6.]  Although A&D Waiver enrollees receive a \nspecific budget amount each year, they need not use services such that they spend the entire allo-\ncated budget.  [Filing No. 95-1, at ECF p. 2.]  The A&D Waiver has a limited number of indi-\nviduals that it can serve, but it is not currently at capacity.  [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF p. 5.] \nBoth the FS Waiver and CIH Waiver provide “waiver services to participants . . . in a \nrange of community settings as an alternative to care in an intermediate care facility” to persons \n“with a developmental disability, intellectual disability . . . or autism.”  [Filing No. 58-7, at ECF \np. 8; Filing No. 58-8, at ECF p. 8.]  While the A&D Waiver is limited to those who require nurs-\ning-facility level of care, the FS Waiver and the CIH Waiver serve individuals who require a dif-\nferent level of  care: “intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities” \n(“ICF/IID”).  [Filing No. 58-7, at ECF p. 7; Filing No. 58-8, at ECF p. 7.]  Like the A&D Waiv-\ner, the FS Waiver and the CIH Waiver are reimbursed at set rates, [Filing No. 58-9, at ECF p. 9-\n- 5 - \n \n\n10], albeit not the same rates as services under the A&D Waiver, [Filing No. 58-9, at ECF p. 2-\n4], and an enrollee has a services budget approved at least on an annual basis, [Filing No. 58-4, \nat ECF p. 6-7].  The FS Waiver currently caps enrollee’s budgets at $16,250 per year.  [Filing \nNo. 58-4, at ECF p. 18.]  The CIH Waiver, however, has a much higher budget cap, [Filing No. \n30-1, at ECF p. 2], given that it is a needs-based waiver and “individuals must meet emergency \nplacement criteria to access [it].”  [Filing No. 58-9, at ECF p. 77.]  The amount of services avail-\nable under each of the three waivers is impacted by the statutory requirements that each waiver \nbe cost-neutral compared to the cost of serving these enrollees through a traditional Medicaid \ninstitutional placement.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(D) (requiring that under each “waiver the \naverage per capita expenditure estimated by the State in any fiscal year for medical assistance \nprovided with respect to such individuals does not exceed 100 percent of the average per capita \nexpenditure that the State reasonably estimates would have been made in that fiscal year for ex-\npenditures under the State plan for such individuals if the waiver had not been granted”). \nFrom 2006 to 2011, FSSA policy permitted individuals with developmental disabilities to \nbe placed on the A&D Waiver even if they did not meet nursing-facility level of care.  [Filing \nNo. 58-9, at ECF p. 27-32 (2006 A&D Waiver Policy Statement).]  This decision contradicted \nthe express terms of the A&D Waiver approved by DHHS, which limited the A&D Waiver to \nindividuals requiring nursing-facility level of care.  [Filing No. 58-5, at ECF p. 11.]  In October \n2011, the Division of Aging instituted a new policy that is the subject of this litigation (“2011 \nPolicy Change”).  [Filing No. 58-9, at ECF p. 32.]  The 2011 Policy Change rescinded the \nFSSA’s prior policy of allowing individuals with a developmental disability to enroll in the A&D \nWaiver even if they did not require nursing-facility level of care.  [Filing No. 58-9, at ECF p. \n32.]  Because some individuals on the A&D Waiver did not meet that level of care, the Division \n- 6 - \n \n\nof Aging needed to transition enrollees to another waiver for which they were eligible.  [Filing \nNo. 58-2, at ECF p. 12.]  Specifically, the Division of Aging sought to transition those no longer \neligible for the A&D Waiver to either of the two waiver programs administered by BDDS: the \nFS Waiver or the CIH Waiver.  [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF p. 12.] \nIndividuals on the A&D Waiver that were no longer eligible were not instantly transi-\ntioned off the A&D Waiver.  Instead, they remained—and many still remain—on the A&D \nWaiver until they were “targeted”2 for transition to the FS Waiver.  [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF p. \n12-13.]  As stated by the FSSA, “[s]ome individuals currently served through the A&D Waiver \nno longer meet Nursing Facility level of care but do continue to require assistance with activities \nof daily living due to a reported developmental disability.  These individuals have been notified \nby their case manager that they no longer meet [Nursing Facility] level of care and may continue \nto receive services through the A&D Waiver as they wait to be targeted for the [FS Waiver].”  \n[Filing No. 58-9, at ECF p. 76.]  Although technically an individual could transition from the \nA&D Waiver to either the FS Waiver or the CIH Waiver, the FSSA required individuals who \nmust be transitioned off the A&D Waiver to go through an evaluation for placement on the FS \nWaiver.3  [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF p. 13.]  If the evaluation revealed that the individual’s level of \ncare rendered her eligible for the FS Waiver, she would be targeted for that waiver once a slot \nbecame available.  [Filing No. 58-4, at ECF p. 11.]  The FSSA acknowledges that it would be the \n“rare” occasion that an individual requiring nursing-facility level of care would not also meet the \nlevel of care required to be eligible for the FS Waiver and CIH Waiver.  [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF \n                                                 \n2 “Targeting” is a term of art employed by FSSA to connote FSSA’s act of informing an individ-\nual that they are eligible to be transitioned from the waiver waitlist onto the waiver. [ Filing No. \n58-4, at ECF pp. 9-10.] \n3 Individuals were “required” to undergo this FS Waiver evaluation in the sense that if they failed \nto do so, their A&D Waiver services would be terminated and they would not be placed in an \nalternative waiver program.  [Filing No. 58-2, at ECF p. 13.] \n- 7 - \n \n\np. 15.]  Unlike the FS Waiver, individuals transitioned off the A&D Waiver due to the 2011 Pol-\nicy Change are not targeted for placement on the CIH Waiver.  [Filing No. 58-4, at ECF p. 12.]  \nInstead, an individual seeking placement on the CIH Waiver must file a “request for review,” \nduring which BDDS determines whether the individual meets the needs-based criteria required \nfor enrollment on the CIH Waiver.  [Filing No. 58-4, at ECF p. 12.] \nIII. \nDISCUSSION \n \n  The Court begins briefly with the pending Motion for Permissive Intervention and to Join \nin Pending Motion for Class Certification.  [Filing No. 88.]  Thomas Maertz, Colton Cole, Cody \nCole, and Timothy Keister seek to intervene in this action as plaintiffs and seek to join in the \npending Motion to Certify.  [See Filing No. 88, at ECF p. 1-2.]  They seek to do so not only to \nvindicate their own rights, but also to serve as class representatives.  [Filing No. 88, at ECF p. 1.]  \nThe State criticizes but does not opposite the motion, and the Court therefore grants it as unop-\nposed.   \nThe Court turns next to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify.  Plaintiffs seek to certify the follow-\ning class: \nAny and all persons, current and future, terminated from the A&D Waiver as a re-\nsult of the 2011 Policy Change who require more services each year than are \navailable through the FS Waiver and who are not enrolled in the CIH Waiver. \n \n[See Filing No. 74, at ECF p. 24 (setting forth the proposed class definition); Filing No. 105, at \nECF p. 14 (suggesting a modification to the class definition set forth in the supplemental opening \nbrief).]  First, the Court addresses whether this putative class is sufficiently ascertainable.  Next, \nthe Court discusses the Rule 23(a) prerequisites to class certification.  Finally, the Court analyzes \nwhether the putative class meets Rule 23(b)(2).  In the end, the Court concludes that the class is \nnot sufficiently ascertainable, does not meet the four Rule 23(a) requirements, and is not certifia-\n- 8 - \n \n\nble under Rule 23(b)(2).  For each of these reasons, the Court declines to certify the putative \nclass. \nA.  Ascertainability and Indefiniteness \nThe ascertainability or definiteness (two terms used interchangeably) of a class is not a \nprerequisite for class certification enumerated in the Federal Rules, but the Seventh Circuit has \nmade clear that it is nonetheless a requirement for class certification.  See Jamie S., 668 F.3d at \n495 (declining to certify a putative class because, among other reasons, the class was “fatally in-\ndefinite”).  To meet this requirement, “[t]he plaintiff must . . . show . . . that the class is indeed \nidentifiable as a class.”  Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513.  When “there is no way to know or readily as-\ncertain who is a member of the class,” the class “lacks the definiteness required for class certifi-\ncation.”  Jamie S., 668 F.3d at 495; see Adashunas v. Negley, 626 F.2d 600, 604 (7th Cir. 1980) \n(holding that “the proposed class of plaintiffs is so highly diverse and so difficult to identify that \nit is not adequately defined or nearly ascertainable” to warrant certification). \nThe parties vigorously dispute whether the class is sufficiently definite.  The State points \nto several difficulties with the class definition that preclude its members’ identification.  [Filing \nNo. 97, at ECF p. 18-27.]  First, the State argues that the individuals who meet the class defini-\ntion must be identified by reviewing the file of each individual enrolled in the A&D Waiver—\napproximately 14,000 files.  [Filing No. 97, at ECF p. 20-21 (citing Filing No. 95-1, at ECF p. \n1).]  This file review is required, says the State, because those terminated from the A&D Waiver \ndue to the 2011 Policy Change are necessarily those individuals on the A&D Waiver that have a \ndevelopmental disability, thus each file must be examined to check for such a diagnosis.  [Filing \nNo. 97, at ECF p. 20-21.]  The State maintains that this process is more cumbersome than merely \nchecking an electronic database to see if a developmental disability is listed.  Each enrollee’s  \n- 9 - \n \n\nelectronic file contains a maximum of three diagnoses.  If a developmental disability is not of the \ndiagnoses maintained electronically an examination of each enrollee’s full file would have to be \nconducted to determine the first requirement of class membership.  [Filing No. 97, at ECF p. 20-\n21.]  Second, the State focuses specifically on the portion of the class definition that putative \nclass members are those “who require more services each year than are available through the FS \nWaiver.”  [See Filing No. 97, at ECF p. 21-25.]  According to the State, determining whether an \nindividual requires more services than offered through the FS Waiver—which is capped at \n$16,250 per year in services, [Filing No. 58-4, at ECF p. 18]—“is extremely complicated, indi-\nvidualized, fluctuating, and subjective,” for three reasons: (1) an individual’s last A&D Waiver \nbudget is an inadequate proxy for services that an individual will require on the FS Waiver; (2) \nservices available on the A&D Waiver and not the same as those available on the FS Waiver; \nand (3) budgeted dollars on the FS Waiver are not equivalent to budgeted dollars on the A&D \nWaiver because of differing approved rates, [Filing No. 97, at ECF p. 21-22]. \nPlaintiffs respond with several arguments.  First, Plaintiffs contend that the State over-\nlooks that Plaintiffs seek certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) rather than Rule 23(b)(3), and \nthat “ascertainability arguments are entitled to little weight where certification is sought under \nRule 23(b)(2).”  [Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 3.]  Second, Plaintiffs argue that any difficulty that \nexists in identifying class members stems from the State’s own failure to track those affected by \nthe 2011 Policy Change, and thus these difficulties should not preclude certification.  [Filing No. \n105, at ECF p. 7-8.]  Third, Plaintiffs maintain that “the key [inquiry] is simply whether a per-\nson’s membership in the class may be ascertained by reference to objective criteria,” and that all \nof the criteria in the proposed class definition are indeed objective.  [Filing No. 105, at ECF p. \n9.]  Finally, Plaintiffs argue that if determining what services an individual “requires” precludes \n- 10 - \n \n\nclass certification, “vindication of class-wide harms [would be] virtually impossible in a wide \nrange of cases,” and in any event, the class definition “simply accepts the determination of indi-\nviduals’ needs that have already been made by the State” when their A&D Waiver budgets were \npreviously approved by the State.  [Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 10-11.] \nThe Court must first briefly address Plaintiffs’ position that the ascertainability require-\nment is relaxed—if not unnecessary—when, as here, certification is sought pursuant to Rule \n23(b)(2).  Although Plaintiffs cite numerous out-of-circuit precedents and district court cases \nsupporting their position, [see Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 4-5], Seventh Circuit authority—which, \nof course, binds this Court—belies Plaintiffs’ argument.  Indeed, as Plaintiffs recognize, the Sev-\nenth Circuit in Jamie S. rejected class certification on ascertainability grounds even though certi-\nfication was sought pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2).  See 668 F.3d at 495-96, 498-99.  And nothing in \nJamie S. even implicitly suggests that a relaxed ascertainability standard applies to Rule 23(b)(2) \nclasses.  See also Adashunas, 626 F.2d at 604-05 (rejecting class certification in a Rule 23(b)(2) \ncase on ascertainability grounds without suggesting that a relaxed ascertainability standard ap-\nplies).  Had a relaxed standard applied, the Seventh Circuit would have explained why the puta-\ntive class did not even meet that standard, but it did not.  The Court therefore rejects Plaintiffs’ \nargument that a relaxed ascertainability standard should apply in this case and instead applies the \nascertainability requirements set forth by the Seventh Circuit. \nThe parties’ remaining arguments focus on whether the members of the putative class are \nindeed identifiable.  For several reasons, the Court concludes that they are not.  Specifically, the \nCourt concludes that identifying putative class members who require more services each year \nthan are available through the FS Waiver is a “complex, highly individualized task, and cannot \nbe reduced to the application of a set of simple, objective criteria.”  Jamie S., 668 F.3d at 496.  \n- 11 - \n \n\nPlaintiffs resist this conclusion by arguing that the services an individual “require[s]” is already \nknown in that “the State has already made this determination” when the individual’s A&D \nWaiver budget was approved by the State according to what services she “needs to remain safely \nand securely in the community.”  [Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 10-11.]  Notably, this is the only \nmethod by which Plaintiffs suggest this determination—necessary for class membership—can be \nmade.  But the Court agrees with the State that the previously approved A&D Waiver budget is \nan inappropriate proxy for determining whether an individual requires more services each year \nthan are available through the FS Waiver, rendering the identities of class members unascertain-\nable short of a complex, highly individualized review of each A&D Waiver enrollee’s particular \nneeds. \nThe evidence before the Court suggests that a single-year’s A&D Waiver budget approv-\nal is an inaccurate measure of what an individual will require when enrolled in the FS Waiver.  \nSeveral examples are illustrative of its inaccuracy as a proxy.  First, as the State contends, \n“[b]udgets—in other words, approved services—are not an accurate reflection of what services a \nwaiver enrollee actually uses.”  [Filing No. 97, at ECF p. 22.]  The State points to four illustra-\ntive examples of enrollees whose approved budget was significantly greater than the services he \nor she utilized: (1) A&D Waiver budget of $18,836.63, yet utilized $8,282.57 in waiver services, \n[Filing No. 96-1, at ECF p. 6]; (2) A&D Waiver budget of $18,478.70, yet utilized $8,845.99 in \nwaiver services, [Filing No. 96-1, at ECF p. 3]; (3) A&D Waiver budget of $30,228.48, yet uti-\nlized $16,674.98 in waiver services, [Filing No. 96-1, at ECF p. 2]; and (4) A&D Waiver budget \nof $19,526.40, yet utilized $15,494.76 in waiver services, [Filing No. 96-1, at ECF p. 7].   \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that utilization levels are often lower than the allotted A&D \nWaiver budget.  Instead, they argue that the undisputed evidence remains that the approved A&D \n- 12 - \n \n\nWaiver budget amount is “based on the State’s own determination of what an individual needs.” \n[Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 12.]  While this may be true, utilization more accurately reflects \nwhether an individual truly requires “more services each year than are available through the FS \nWaiver”—which is the operative question in identifying putative class members.   \nFS Waiver budgets are capped at $16,250.00.  [Filing No. 58-4, at ECF p. 18.]  Three of \nthe four individuals discussed above—the first, second, and fourth—despite having A&D Waiv-\ner budgets greater than $16,250.00, utilized less than this amount in services.  Even assuming the \npast year is an accurate reflection of an individual’s needs, these individuals could utilize the ex-\nact same amount of services on the FS Waiver as they did on the A&D Waiver.  This is the prop-\ner frame of reference because—despite the amount approved by the State—if an individual only \nuses services in an amount available under the FS Waiver it cannot be said that the 2011 Policy \nChange impacted them at all.  Such individuals would fall within Plaintiffs’ class definition but \nwould not be harmed by the State’s conduct.  Cf. Messner, 669 F.3d at 824-25 (cautioning \nagainst certifying an overly broad class that “would contain a vast number of people who could \nnot have been harmed”) (emphasis added).  Simply stated, it cannot be said that an individual \nrequires more services than available under the FS Waiver when they utilized an amount of ser-\nvices available on the FS Waiver. \nPlaintiffs further respond by attempting to explain why these individuals underutilized \ntheir budgets.  For example, Plaintiffs point to evidence that two of the individuals “underutilized \nservices because their provider was unable to staff the full level of services for which they were \n- 13 - \n \n\napproved.”4  [Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 12-13 (citing Filing No. 104-3, at ECF p. 2-3).]  Know-\ning the cause of the underutilization, however, does not undermine the fact that utilization more \naccurately captures the amount of services the individual requires, as she will still have access to \nthat amount of services on the FS Waiver.  If anything, Plaintiffs’ recognition that there are many \nreasons services might be underutilized in a given year, [see Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 13], rein-\nforces Defendants’ position that determining whether an individual requires more services than \navailable on the FS Waiver is a highly individualized inquiry that must be conducted on a case-\nby-case basis.   \nThe foregoing discussion is all merely to say that one’s A&D Waiver budget is not an ad-\nequate proxy for the services one requires.  It is true, however, that if utilization is the proper \nmeasure of requirement, one could simply look to an enrollee’s utilization level to determine \nwhether they fall within the class, rather than, as Plaintiffs’ suggest, looking at her approved \nbudget.  The Court could alter the class definition to remedy this problem, but the evidence sug-\ngests that utilization amounts would not serve as an adequate proxy either.  This is demonstrated \nby, among other things, the fact that an individual’s A&D Waiver budget for a single year could \ninclude one-time expenses such as home modifications that, if utilized, will not be required in \nsubsequent years.  [Filing No. 97, at ECF p. 23.]   \nFor  example,  one  representative  enrollee’s  A&D  Waiver  budget  for  one  year  was \n$21,015, but $13,695 of that was earmarked for a home modification.  [Filing No. 96-1, at ECF \np. 4.]  The home modification portion of the budget, however, was never spent, thus the individ-\n                                                 \n4 Plaintiffs make this argument, as well as many others, with respect to the Rule 23(a) require-\nments because, in their view, many of the State’s arguments regarding ascertainability are actual-\nly pertinent only to the Rule 23(a) requirements.  [See Filing No. 74, at ECF p. 11.]  The Court \ndisagrees, finding many of the State’s arguments relevant to ascertainability and thus considers \nPlaintiffs’ responsive arguments in this section. \n- 14 - \n \n\nual only utilized $6,125.56 in waiver services that year.  [Filing No. 96-1, at ECF p. 4.]  During \nthe next budget year, the individual’s A&D Waiver budget was $18,112.60, a substantial portion \nof which was earmarked for a home modification and, this time, was utilized in its entirety.  \n[Filing No. 96-1, at ECF p. 5.]  This example persuasively demonstrates why determining the \nservices an individual will require on the FS Waiver cannot be done by simply looking back to a \nparticular year’s approved A&D Waiver budget or a particular year’s utilized services.  Instead, \nit will require an individualized assessment of each class member’s specific and changing needs. \nEven if the above articulated concerns were not present, other difficulties prevent the \nA&D Waiver budget or utilization amount from functioning as an adequate proxy for the ser-\nvices an individual will require on the FS Waiver.  To conclude otherwise would be to ignore the \nmeaningful qualitative differences in the services offered under the two waiver programs.  The \nA&D Waiver “provides an alternative to nursing facility admission for adults and persons of all \nages with a disability,” specifically by providing services “for people who would require care in \na nursing facility if waiver or other supports were not available,” [Filing No. 58-5, at ECF p. 12], \nwhile the FS Waiver provides services to persons “with a developmental disability” “in a range \nof community settings as an alternative to care in an intermediate care facility,” [Filing No. 58-7, \nat ECF p. 8].  The differences in populations each waiver program is designed to serve make ser-\nvices approved and utilized on one waiver a misleading measure of what services one will re-\nquire on the other.  [Filing No. 95-1, at ECF p. 2 (“The services available on the A&D Waiver \nare best suited to serve individuals who require nursing-facility level of care.  The A&D Waiver \nis ill-equipped to address the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities who only meet \nICF/IID level of care.”).]  Indeed, “[d]ue to the nature of the services available on the A&D \nWaiver, for individuals enrolled on the A&D Waiver with specialized needs based on a devel-\n- 15 - \n \n\nopmental-disability diagnosis, care plans/budgets are more often focused on caregiver needs than \nthe needs of the waiver enrollee because those are needs A&D waiver services do not address.”  \n[Filing No. 95-1, at ECF p. 2.]   \nPlaintiffs contend that the qualitative differences between the two budgets are overstated.  \n[Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 22.]  For example, Plaintiffs reviewed a ten-enrollee sample of puta-\ntive class members, which revealed that eight of the ten “received services through the FS Waiv-\ner virtually identical in kind to services that could be received through the A&D Waiver.”  \n[Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 22 (citing Filing No. 59-39).]  This sample, however, proves the \nState’s point.  Even if there is a substantial overlap in the services, they certainly are not identi-\ncal.  Thus, whether one looks to an enrollee’s past A&D Waiver budget or utilization amounts \nwhile enrolled in the A&D Waiver, neither are an appropriate measure of the services one will \nrequire when on the FS Waiver, as both parties acknowledge that precisely the same services are \nnot offered.  And indeed, putative class members are already receiving different services on the \nFS Waiver than they were on the A&D Waiver.  [Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 22.]  These qualita-\ntive differences in the services offered under the FS Waiver and the A&D Waiver preclude use \nof a previous year’s A&D Waiver budget or utilization levels as an appropriate proxy for deter-\nmining whether an individual requires more services than offered under the FS Waiver. \nThe State also points to the fact that specific services that are provided under both waiv-\ners are not reimbursed at the same rates, such that $1 of A&D Waiver services is not equivalent \nto $1 of FS Waiver services.  [Compare Filing No. 58-9, at ECF p. 2-4 (A&D Waiver Reim-\nbursement Rates), with Filing No. 58-9, at ECF p. 9-10 (FS Waiver and CIH Waiver Reim-\nbursement Rates).]  Plaintiffs acknowledge this is true, and suggest that any difficulties this \nposed could simply be solved by replacing “who require more than $16,250.00 a year in waiver \n- 16 - \n \n\nservices” in their originally proposed class definition with “who requires more services each year \nthan are available through the [FS] Waiver.”  [Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 14.]  The Court has in-\ncorporated this change to Plaintiffs’ proposed class definition, but cannot conclude that this \nchange makes the putative class members any more ascertainable.  The fact remains that the only \nmethod by which Plaintiffs suggest the services an individual “requires” can be ascertained is by \nusing a previous year’s A&D Waiver budget as a proxy and simply looking to whether that \nbudget is greater than the $16,250.00 cap on services under FS Waiver (assumingly, after one \nadjusts for the difference in reimbursement rates).  But for all of the reasons set forth above, the \nA&D Waiver budget or utilization levels are inapt proxies for determining whether an individual \nrequires more services than he or she can access on the FS Waiver.  \nPlaintiffs resist this conclusion on yet another ground, contending that the difficulty in \nidentifying the services an enrollee will require on the FS Waiver budget goes not to ascertaina-\nbility but to “difference[s] in relief amongst class-members,” which concerns the Court’s analy-\nsis of “numerosity, commonality, and/or typicality.”  [Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 11.]  All that the \nCourt must decide regarding ascertainability, say Plaintiffs, “is simply whether the class is de-\nfined by reference to objective criteria,” and “[t]he level of an enrollee’s needs—what that per-\nson ‘requires’—is an objective criterion . . . that is made by the State at least once a year for eve-\nry individual enrolled in its waiver programs.”  [Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 11 (emphasis in origi-\nnal).]  But this is simply a restatement of Plaintiffs’ position that the State’s approval of an indi-\nvidual’s A&D Waiver budget can be used as a proxy for the services one will require under the \nFS Waiver—an argument the Court has already rejected.   \nThis would be a different case had the determination on which class membership depend-\ned—i.e., the services one requires under the FS Waiver—already been made by the State in some \n- 17 - \n \n\nfashion.  This was the case in N.B. v. Hamos, --- F.Supp.2d ----, 2014 WL 562637, at *4-5 (N.D. \nIll. 2014), where the court certified a class of Medicaid enrollees and rejected the defendant’s \nargument that the putative class was unascertainable.  There, the court recognized that “the diag-\nnosis of mental and behavioral disorders is plainly an individualized and child-specific undertak-\ning,” but reasoned that “the class definition proposed in this case presupposes such a diagnosis as \na condition of class membership.”  Id. at *5.  It did so, the court continued, because “[t]he statu-\ntory scheme at [issue] provides the mechanism for identifying children in need of mental health \nservices, [and] . . . [o]nce a child has been diagnosed as requiring such services . . . , he or she is \nentitled under the law to whatever services their doctors have recommended for maximum im-\nprovement.”  Id.  This distinguished Jamie S., the court reasoned, “where membership in the \nclass could not be determined without individualized, court-approved assessments;” unlike in \nJamie S., “once the class members have been identified—through the workable criteria set forth \nin the statute and adopted by Illinois regulation, not through a determination of the Court—the \nrequired treatment is not subject to further inquiry.”  Id.  Specifically, “[b]y accepting Medicaid \nfunds, the State already has agreed to the standard defining what mental health treatment is \n‘medically necessary,’” and thus “[t]here will be no need for the Court to monitor and review the \npropriety of those determinations.”  Id. at *7.  Other cases on which Plaintiffs rely have this same \nelement not present here: a statute, regulation, or other mechanism readily determines class \nmembership.  See, e.g., A.M.T. v. Gargano, 2010 WL 4860119, at *3 (S.D. Ind. 2010) (holding \nthat members of a putative class of children Medicaid recipients were ascertainable because “the \nkey inquiry will be whether the FSSA denied all or part of an enrollee’s therapy request pursuant \n- 18 - \n \n\nto § (b)(6) or § (b)(7)[, which] . . . can be determined by . . . [the] FSSA’s denial notices indicat-\ning its reasons for denying the requested treatments”).5 \nThis case is like Jamie S. and distinguishable from Hamos in that the State here has not \nalready made the determinations necessary to conclude whether an individual requires more ser-\nvices each year than are available through the FS Waiver.  In other words, contrary to Plaintiffs \nreliance on Hamos, the class definition does not “presuppose[]” that the necessary determina-\ntions have already been made.  Hamos, 2014 WL 562637, at *5.  Plaintiffs try to fit this class \ninto Hamos’s reasoning by pointing to the prior A&D Waiver budget allotment as an already de-\ntermined measure of the putative class members’ needs.  But for all the reasons discussed above, \nthe prior A&D Waiver budget is not an adequate proxy for the services one will require on the \nFS Waiver and thus in no sense does the class definition in this case merely utilize a determina-\ntion already made by the State. \nThis case is instead like Jamie S., as individuals who require more services than are \navailable under the FS Waiver are “not identified and remain unidentified.”  668 F.3d at 495 \n(emphasis in original); see Adashunas, 626 F.3d at 603 (“How does one identify class members \nconsisting of persons not identified?”).  Indeed, these individuals will only be identified by an \nindividualized case-by-case assessment of the needs of every enrollee terminated from the A&D \n                                                 \n5 At the hearing, Plaintiffs suggested that the law should not encourage governmental entities to \navoid class certification by obscuring the bases for their decisions.  But merely because the State \nprovided the individuals in A.M.T. with the basis for its decision, which permitted the putative \nclass to be identified with ease, does not mean the converse is true—that obscuring the basis for \na decision would lead to the denial of certification.  Furthermore, the Court’s ultimate conclusion \nin this case that the putative class is not sufficiently ascertainable is not reached due to the \nState’s intentional withholding of information or negligent recordkeeping.  While the Court is \nsomewhat surprised that the FSSA does not have more readily available information regarding \nthe complete diagnoses of the enrollees in its waiver programs than it does, there is no reason to \nthink that the State would have had reason to manage their databases in the manner desired by \nthe Plaintiffs.  \n- 19 - \n \n\nWaiver program.  A putative class is not sufficiently ascertainable if such a process is required.  \nSee Jamie S., 668 F.3d at 496 (“[I]dentifying disabled students who might be eligible for special-\neducation services is a complex, highly individualized task, and cannot be reduced to the applica-\ntion of a set of simple, objective criteria.  Every step of the child-find inquiry and IEP process \nunder the IDEA is child specific and requires the application of trained and particularized profes-\nsional educational judgment.”); Bowman v. IBM Corp., 1:11-cv-593-RLY-TAB, Dkt. 307 at 13 \n(S.D. Ind. 2013) (relying on Jamie S. in holding that the putative class was not ascertainable be-\ncause “[s]everal steps across multiple programs are necessary to determine which individuals had \ntheir benefits improperly interrupted.  Further, individuals with particularized knowledge of both \nMedicaid and the corresponding computer systems would be forced to make a subjective inter-\npretation of handwritten notes, among other items, in deciding who belonged in the class.  This is \nfar from a mere reference to objective criteria to determine the class.”). \nPlaintiffs are incorrect that concluding this class is not sufficiently ascertainable “would \nmake vindication of class-wide harms virtually impossible in a wide range of cases.”  [Filing No. \n105, at ECF p. 10.]  It is the particular factual peculiarities of this case that make the putative \nclass members unascertainable.  If, for example, the State eliminated certain services provided \nunder the FS Waiver and Plaintiffs challenged that elimination, crafting an ascertainable class \nwould in all likelihood be a relatively straightforward task.6  But this is not what occurred.  After \nfive years of allowing individuals with developmental disabilities who did not meet nursing-\nfacility level of care to receive services under the A&D Waiver—which, by the express terms \nagreed to by the State and federal government, the A&D Waiver did not permit, [Filing No. 58-5, \n                                                 \n6 The Court does not suggest or offer a view on whether such a class would otherwise be certifi-\nable, only that a stronger argument could be made that the putative class members are ascertain-\nable. \n- 20 - \n \n\nat ECF p. 11]—the State issued the 2011 Policy Change to comply with the terms of the agreed-\nupon waiver, [Filing No. 58-9, at ECF p. 32].  As a result of the 2011 Policy Change, individuals \nwho were improperly receiving waiver services under the A&D Waiver, were targeted for transi-\ntion to the more limited FS Waiver—that is, a waiver program designed to serve individuals re-\nquiring their level of care.  [Filing No. 58-8, at ECF p. 7]  The State’s initial error and subse-\nquent correction created the rather peculiar situation underlying this case: individuals may suffer \noverall service reductions, yet the Court is bereft of a classwide method by which to measure \nwhether an individual requires more services than those offered on the FS Waiver.   \nHaving concluded that Plaintiffs’ proposed method of determining the services an indi-\nvidual requires on the FS Waiver is inadequate, the only option left would be an arduous indi-\nvidual review of each case file.  But even this would not be sufficient, as no mere ministerial re-\nview of case files could resolve the difficulty created by the fact that the two waiver programs, \nand the services offered thereunder, are geared toward individuals with different levels of need.  \n[Filing No. 95-1, at ECF p. 2.]  Indeed, Plaintiffs acknowledge that the two waivers do not offer \nthe same services and that some putative class members are receiving services under the FS \nWaiver that are not the same as those under the A&D Waiver.  [Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 22.]  \nThese qualitative differences alone ultimately undermine any value an individual’s prior A&D \nWaiver budget has for determining the services individuals require when enrolled in the FS \nWaiver.  \nFor all of the foregoing reasons, “there is no way to know or readily ascertain who is a \nmember of the class.”  Jamie S., 668 F.3d at 495.  The only way to identify individuals who re-\nquire more services each year than are available through the FS Waiver is via a Court mandated \nindividualized inquiry into the specific needs of each enrollee.  And when this is the case, the \n- 21 - \n \n\nputative class is not sufficiently ascertainable to permit certification.  See id. at 495-96.  Accord-\ningly, Plaintiffs Motion to Certify must be denied. \nB.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) \nEven if the Court assumes that the putative class is sufficiently ascertainable, Plaintiffs \nhave also failed to establish that the four Rule 23(a) requirements are met.  Rule 23(a) sets out \nfour threshold requirements for class certification: “(1) numerosity (a class [so large] that joinder \nof all members is impracticable); (2) commonality (questions of law or fact common to the \nclass); (3) typicality (named parties’ claims or defenses are typical . . . of the class); and (4) ade-\nquacy of representation (representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass).”  Kress v. CCA of Tenn., LLC, 694 F.3d 890, 892-93 (7th Cir. 2012) (alteration in origi-\nnal) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that these four \nrequirements are met.  See Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513.  The parties dispute whether Plaintiffs have \nestablished any of the four Rule 23(a) requirements.  The Court will address the four require-\nments out of order, beginning with commonality as that element predominated the parties’ argu-\nments.  After concluding that commonality is not met, the Court briefly addresses the remaining \nthree requirements. \n  1.  Commonality \nCommonality requires there to be “questions of law or fact common to the class,” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a)(2), although “even a single common question will do,” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., v. \nDukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2556 (2011) (alterations, citations, and quotation marks omitted).  “But \nthe Supreme Court explained in Wal-Mart that superficial common questions—like . . .  whether \neach class member ‘suffered a violation of the same provision of law’—are not enough.”  Jamie \nS., 668 F.3d at 497 (quoting Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551).  Instead, Plaintiffs’ “claims must de-\n- 22 - \n \n\npend upon a common contention . . . [t]hat . . . must be of such a nature that it is capable of \nclasswide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue \nthat is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at \n2551.  In this sense, “the raising of common ‘questions’—even in droves,” is not enough; the key \nto commonality is whether a classwide proceeding can “generate common answers apt to drive \nthe resolution of the litigation.  Dissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the poten-\ntial to impede the generation of common answers.”  Id. (emphasis in original) (citation and quo-\ntation marks omitted). \nAn analysis of the Rule 23(a) prerequisites, including commonality, will “[f]requently . . . \nentail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim.”  Id.; see Jamie S., 668 \nF.3d at 498 (relying on Wal-Mart when analyzing the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims in deciding \nwhether commonality was met).  The Supreme Court’s consideration of the merits of the plain-\ntiffs’ claims in Wal-Mart provides this Court with guidance as to how the merits can impact the \ncommonality inquiry.  In that case, the Supreme Court found that commonality was not met in a \nnationwide class action on behalf of female Wal-Mart employees who alleged sex discrimination \nunder Title VII.  See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2547.  The Supreme Court reasoned: \nIn this case, proof of commonality necessarily overlaps with respondents’ merits \ncontention that Wal-Mart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination.  That \nis so because, in resolving an individual’s Title VII claim, the crux of the inquiry \nis the reason for a particular employment decision.  Here respondents wish to sue \nabout literally millions of employment decisions at once.  Without some glue \nholding the alleged reasons for all those decisions together, it will be impossible \nto say that examination of all the class members’ claims for relief will produce a \ncommon answer to the crucial question why was I disfavored. \n \nId. at 2552 (emphasis in original). \n \n      a.  The legal standard for an integration-mandate claim \n \n- 23 - \n \n\nTo assess whether commonality is met, the Court must begin with Plaintiffs’ legal claim.  \nPlaintiffs’ sole legal claim is that the 2011 Policy Change—by which they were transferred from \nthe A&D Waiver to the FS Waiver—violates the  integration mandate found in the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.  [Filing No. 1, at ECF p. 17-18 (“The elimination of persons with develop-\nmental disabilities who do not . . . routinely require skilled nursing services[] from the A&D \nWaiver violates the ‘integration mandate’ of the [ADA] and the Rehabilitation Act.”).]  The inte-\ngration mandate found in the ADA and Rehabilitation Act are substantively identical, and thus \nthe Court treats them as such.  See Amundson ex rel. Amundson v. Wis. Dep’t of Health Servs., \n721 F.3d 871, 872 (7th Cir. 2013) (treating them as identical); see also Radaszewski ex rel. \nRadaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599, 607 (7th Cir. 2004) (noting that the “ADA’s integration \nregulation is modeled after [the Rehabilitation Act’s] regulation” and thus “courts construe and \napply them in a consistent manner”). \n  The integration mandate has its statutory roots in the anti-discrimination provision of the \nADA.  See Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 587 (1999).  This provision states: \n“no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, \nor be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  In Olmstead, the Su-\npreme Court assessed whether this provision “may require placement of persons with mental dis-\nabilities in community settings rather than in institutions,” and answered with “a qualified yes.”  \n527 U.S. at 587.  It held that “[s]uch action is in order when the State’s treatment professionals \nhave determined that community placement is appropriate, the transfer from institutional care to \na less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual, and the placement can be rea-\n- 24 - \n \n\nsonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State7 and the needs of \nothers with mental disabilities.”  Id.; see Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 607 (stating that Olmstead \n“held that the ‘unjustified institutional isolation’ of a disabled individual receiving medical care \nfrom a State amounts to an actionable form of discrimination under Title II”) (quoting Olmstead, \n527 U.S. at 597-603).   \n  As Wal-Mart teaches, important to assessing commonality is defining the specific harm a \nplaintiff must suffer to have a cognizable integration-mandate claim; this is necessary to deter-\nmine whether a classwide proceeding can “generate common answers apt to drive the resolution \nof the litigation.”  Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551.  Plaintiffs argue as if a cognizable integration \nmandate claim lies any time a State reduces an individual’s services.  Specifically, Plaintiffs con-\ntend that the integration mandate extends not only to those who are subject to “unjustified insti-\ntutional isolation,” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 600, but also to “person[s] for whom participation in \ncommunity life is curtailed, even if they are able to remain living in their own homes.”  [Filing \nNo. 105, at ECF p. 17 n.8.]  As confirmed by the Court at the hearing, Plaintiffs’ only authority \nfor this proposition are two out-of-circuit district court cases, [see Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 17 \nn.8 (citing Lane v. Kitzhaber, 841 F.Supp.2d 1199, 1205 (D. Or. 2012); K.M. ex rel. D.G. v. \nHyde Park Cent. Sch. Dist., 381 F.Supp.2d 343, 360 (S.D.N.Y. 2005))].  Plaintiffs agreed that \nthe Seventh Circuit has never ascribed to this view of the integration mandate.  Indeed, in \nAmundson, the Seventh Circuit suggested that actual institutionalization is required. \nThe plaintiffs in Amundson alleged that Wisconsin’s cuts to services provided to the de-\nvelopmentally disabled violated the integration mandate.  721 F.3d at 872.  The Seventh Circuit \n                                                 \n7 The parties did not focus on the interplay between Olmstead’s availability of resources factor, \nthe waiver language requiring cost neutrality, and the joint federal/state pay structure of the Med-\nicaid plan, so the Court will not either.  While it may be an issue the parties reserve for the mer-\nits, it looms large on the horizon.  \n- 25 - \n \n\nheld that this claim was not ripe because “[n]one of the plaintiffs has been placed in an institu-\ntion,” id. at 873, and thus “there [was] no legal injury,” id. at 874.  Although other circuits have \nheld that the integration mandate covers those that are “at risk of institutionalization,” e.g., Pash-\nby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 322 (4th Cir. 2013), Amundson suggests that an individual asserting an \nintegration-mandate claim must face institutionalization before a claim can be brought, see 721 \nF.3d at 874 (stating that if Wisconsin cut services “without landing any developmentally disabled \nperson in an institution,” it “has fulfilled its obligation under federal law”).8  Therefore, in as-\nsessing whether commonality exists, the Court will apply the integration-mandate standard of \ninstitutionalization suggested in Amundson rather than Plaintiffs’ proposed standard of curtail-\nment of services. \n    b.  Plaintiffs’ proposed common questions are insufficient \nPlaintiffs contend that commonality is met because a common question of law exists.  \n[See Filing No. 74, at ECF p. 31-32.]  Specifically, Plaintiffs assert that all members of the puta-\ntive class “are subject to the 2011 Policy Change and their concomitant removal from the A&D \nWaiver.”  [Filing No. 74, at ECF p. 31.]  The common question of law, say Plaintiffs, is \n“[w]hether these policies result in the violation of class-members’ rights under the [ADA] and \n[Rehabilitation Act].”  [Filing No. 74, at ECF p. 32.]  But as Wal-Mart and Jamie S. made clear, \n“superficial common questions—like . . .  whether each class member ‘suffered a violation of the \nsame provision of law’—are not enough.”  Jamie S., 668 F.3d at 497 (quoting Wal-Mart, 131 S. \n                                                 \n8 The Seventh Circuit in Amundson held that the plaintiffs’ claims were not ripe because none \nhad yet “land[ed] . . . in an institution.”  721 F.3d at 874.  This too could present a problem for \nPlaintiffs’ integration-mandate claim.  Ripeness is usually an issue to be resolved ahead of oth-\ners.   But the State did not pursue a ripeness challenge, and it is possible that there may be an in-\ndividual in the putative class whose claim might be ripe under Amundsen.  Because there are \nnumerous other grounds on which to decide this motion, the Court will not pursue it at this time \neither. \n- 26 - \n \n\nCt. at 2551).  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ proposed common question of whether the 2011 Policy \nChange violated the integration mandate is stated at a level of generality too high to establish \ncommonality.  Were this all Plaintiffs offered, the Court would not need to proceed further.  On \nreply, however, Plaintiffs further explain their view of commonality. \n  Although Plaintiffs’ reply brief focuses primarily on assailing the State’s arguments ra-\nther than setting forth what common question exists, they do attempt to clarify their view of how \ncommonality is met.  Plaintiffs assert that the 2011 Policy Change is the “‘glue’ uniting the \nclass.”  [Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 16.]  It is so, say Plaintiffs, because the 2011 Policy Change \nreduced putative class members’ services such that “all class-members have either suffered un-\nnecessary institutionalization or segregation, or are ‘at serious risk [thereof].’”  [Filing No. 105, \nat ECF p. 17 (quoting Pashby, 709 F.3d at 322); see Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 17 (arguing that “a \nperson receiving fewer services designed to ensure community integration is, almost by defini-\ntion, less integrated into the community”).]   \nThe Court must first reject Plaintiffs’ attempt to present a common question that relates to \nputative  class  members’  segregation  or  diminution  in  services.    As  previously  made  clear, \nAmundson requires institutionalization to state a cognizable integration-mandate claim.  See 721 \nF.3d at 874.  This leaves Plaintiffs’ contention that the 2011 Policy Change is the “glue” that \nholds the class together because it led to the “unnecessary institutionalization” of putative class \nmembers.  [Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 17.]  However, once the Court drills down on this conten-\ntion, it is clear that this argument also lacks merit.   \nThe Supreme Court in Wal-Mart focused on whether there was “some glue holding the \nalleged reasons for [the challenged employment] decision together” because the reasons for a \ngiven employment decision are what determines liability under Title VII.  See Wal-Mart, 131 S. \n- 27 - \n \n\nCt. at 2552 (“[I]n resolving an individual’s Title VII claim, the crux of the inquiry is ‘the reason \nfor a particular employment decision.’”) (quoting Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, \n467 U.S. 867, 876 (1984)).  Such is not the case here.  Unlike Title VII, a successful integration-\nmandate claim, at least at the threshold, does not look to the reasons given for a decision, but \nwhether the challenged State action—here, the 2011 Policy Change—caused the plaintiff to face \ninstitutionalization.  See Amundson, 721 F.3d at 874.  If, as Plaintiffs suggest, the 2011 Policy \nChange is the glue holding the class together, it would have to be the policy that caused the class \nmembers to face institutionalization such that “examination of all the class members’ claims for \nrelief will produce a common answer to the crucial question [did the 2011 Policy cause them to \nbe institutionalized].”  Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552.  In other words, the “truth or falsity” of \nwhether the 2011 Policy Change caused the institutionalization of class members must be “capa-\nble of classwide resolution” such that the Court can resolve the issue for “each one of the claims \nin one stroke.”  Id. at 2551. \n  Such a one-stroke resolution is impossible.  First, there is no evidence that the 2011 Poli-\ncy Change itself directly caused any of the putative class members to be institutionalized.  This is \nunsurprising given that the 2011 Policy Change merely transitioned individuals who the State \nwrongly placed on the A&D Waiver to the FS Waiver, both of which are designed to allow en-\nrollees to receive services in the community.  [See Filing No. 58-5, at ECF p. 8; Filing No. 58-8, \nat ECF p. 2.]  Therefore, the most that can be said about the 2011 Policy Change is that it caused \nsome class members to receive fewer community-based services, which under Amundson is in-\nsufficient to establish an integration-mandate claim.  In other words, it cannot be said that the \n2011 Policy Change itself caused any class members to be institutionalized, and thus the 2011 \nPolicy Change could not violate the integration mandate.  This precludes the 2011 Policy Change \n- 28 - \n \n\nfrom being the “glue” holding the class claims together, as a policy that did not cause any legal \nharm cannot be “an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims.”  Wal-Mart, 131 \nS. Ct. at 2551; see also Johnson v. Meriter Health Servs. Employee Retirement Plan, 702 F.3d \n364, 369 (7th Cir. 2012) (recognizing that commonality was not met in Wal-Mart because “no \ncompany-wide policy was being challenged,” as one of the two company-wide policies to which \nthe plaintiffs pointed “could not violate Title VII”).  Accordingly, commonality is not met on this \nground. \nc.  The class definition cannot be altered such that certification is war-\nranted, as Plaintiffs’ challenge to the 2011 Policy Change is mis-\nguided \n \nAs a fallback, Plaintiffs suggest the Court can cure any problems by exercising its author-\nity to refine the proposed class definition.  See, e.g., Messner, 669 F.3d at 825 (citing cases).  But \nthe problems with Plaintiffs’ proposed class run deeper than the class definition; they are rooted \nin the misguided nature of Plaintiffs’ contention that the 2011 Policy Change is the “glue” that \nrenders the case certifiable.  From the beginning, Plaintiffs have focused on the legality of the \n2011 Policy Change, but this change is not the true reason for their alleged legal harm (the re-\nceipt of insufficient services such that institutionalization was required).9  Instead, the 2011 Poli-\ncy Change brought the FSSA’s waiver programs in compliance with the express terms of the \nwaivers.  An unfortunate possible consequence of that change is that some developmentally dis-\n                                                 \n9 Again, this is assuming that any of the putative class members actually face institutionalization.  \nThere is no evidence before the Court that this is the case.  According to Amundson, if all that \nresulted from the 2011 Policy Change is that putative class members’ services were reduced \n“without landing any developmentally disabled person in an institution,” the State “has fulfilled \nits obligation under federal law.”  721 F.3d at 874.  And if this is the case, Plaintiffs’ proposed \nclass is fatally overbroad.  See Messner, 669 F.3d at 825 (“[A] class should not be certified if it is \napparent that it contains a great many persons who have suffered no injury at the hands of the \ndefendant.”) (citation and quotation marks omitted); see also Oshana, 472 F.3d at 514.  The \nCourt need not rest its decision on this ground, however, because there are several other more \nthoroughly briefed bases to deny certification. \n- 29 - \n \n\nabled individuals may receive fewer services.  Any legal challenge to that fact—again, assuming \nthe receipt of fewer services caused at least some class members to face institutionalization—\nshould not be predicated on the State’s decision to comply with its waiver agreement with the \nfederal government.  Instead, the true cause of any potential harm is the confluence of policies \nthat apply to all FS Waiver enrollees that limit their services: (1) the FS Waiver’s budget cap10; \nand (2) the enrollee’s exclusion from the CIH Waiver (which, like the FS Waiver, is designed for \nindividuals with developmental disabilities and is not subject to the FS Waiver’s budget cap, [see \nFiling No. 58-7, at ECF p. 8; Filing No. 30-1, at ECF p. 2]).   \nAt least two problems prevent the Court from certifying a class to challenge the conflu-\nence of these policies.  First and foremost, Plaintiffs have not sought to challenge the policies, \nand it is of course not the Court’s role to assert claims on Plaintiffs’ behalf.  Second, even if the \nCourt endeavored to do so, the record is insufficient to establish that commonality would be met \nfor Plaintiffs’ proposed class to pursue a challenge to these policies.  \nCommonality would not be present for such a class because there are several distinct sce-\nnarios that could preclude putative class members from receiving services under the CIH Waiver.  \nThe record reflects at least three such scenarios: (1) their CIH Waiver applications were denied \nbecause they did not meet the eligibility criteria for placement on that waiver; (2) they failed to \n                                                 \n10 This budget cap is, at least in part, dictated by the requirement that each waiver be cost-neutral \ncompared to the cost of serving waiver enrollees through a traditional Medicaid institutional \nplacement.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(D).  The Court highlights this fact to note that any in-\njunction Plaintiffs seek could not countermand terms of the state-federal waivers that are dictated \nby federal law. \n- 30 - \n \n\napply for placement on the CIH Waiver11; or (3) as Plaintiffs contend, the BDDS failed to inform \nthem about, or affirmatively discouraged them from applying for, the CIH Waiver.12  [See Filing \nNo. 74, at ECF p. 9-13 (recognizing that putative class members “might receive services through \nthe CIH Waiver” but that the placement criteria are rather limited and that there is evidence that \nBDDS has discouraged individuals from applying for services under that waiver).]  Because the \nonly cognizable13 legal harm—institutionalization—could have been caused by the FS Waiver \nbudget cap in conjunction with any of these three alternative scenarios, there would be no com-\nmon question with a “single answer” for all the class members.  Jamie S., 668 F.3d at 497 (em-\nphasis in original).  In other words, no common question of law exists between two putative class \nmembers who face institutionalization, one because she does not meet the CIH Waiver’s eligibil-\n                                                 \n11 This category also includes individuals who did not appeal their termination from the A&D \nWaiver.  Plaintiffs acknowledge that some individuals who faced termination from the A&D \nWaiver due to the 2011 Policy Change were enrolled in the CIH Waiver.  [Filing No. 74, at ECF \np. 23.]  And this includes at least one individual who appealed her termination from the A&D \nWaiver and was subsequently “offered a slot on the CIH Waiver.”  [Filing No. 74, at ECF p. 23 \n(citing Filing No. 59-34, at ECF p. 39-40).] \n12 Plaintiffs do not dispute or otherwise suggest that putative class members only fall into one of \nthese categories.  Indeed, the Court questioned Plaintiffs at the hearing regarding why putative \nclass members should not be required to seek enrollment in the CIH Waiver before being able to \nargue that the State’s policies are unlawful.  Plaintiffs did not dispute that some putative class \nmembers did not pursue the CIH Waiver, but argued that whether they did or not is a matter of \nexhaustion and, further, that nothing in the law requires exhaustion before filing an integration-\nmandate suit.  Regardless of whether this is true, the fact that some putative class members face a \nreduction in services and perhaps institutionalization due to their own inaction or either of the \nother two above stated reasons also undermines commonality in that it prevents there from being \na common question of law that the Court could answer for the entire class “in one stroke.”  Wal-\nMart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. \n13 Again, the Court is mindful that Plaintiffs contend that any curtailment in participation in \ncommunity life is a legal wrong, even if they are able to remain living in their own homes.  As \nnoted, relevant Seventh Circuit precedent requires institutionalization to support a violation.  It is \nfor the Seventh Circuit, not this Court, to determine whether the teachings of Amundson should \nbe modified or expanded. \n- 31 - \n \n\nity criteria and one because, although eligible, has (allegedly) had the CIH Waiver’s existence \nhidden from her by the FSSA.  \n  This would distinguish such a claim (had Plaintiffs made it) from other cases where \ncourts have certified integration-mandate classes even after Wal-Mart and Jamie S.  In those cas-\nes, a single state policy was challenged that directly caused the unnecessary institutionalization \nof disabled individuals.  Cf. Bolden v. Walsh Const. Co., 688 F.3d 893, 898 (7th Cir. 2012) \n(“This single national policy was the missing ingredient in Wal-Mart.”).  For example, in Hamos \nthe court found that commonality was present because the plaintiffs challenged “whether the \nstate provides intensive mental health treatment to children only in hospitals and institutions and \nfails to provide any intensive, individualized care that is community-based or in the home.”  \n2014 WL 562637, at *11.  The court explained, “According to the plaintiffs, the State covers in-\ntensive treatment only in an institutional setting and does not cover any home and community-\nbased care other than weekly outpatient counseling and medication management.  If this is so, \nthen every plaintiff is suffering the same injury as a result of a general policy of the State—even \nif the services recommended for each patient vary among the class members.”  Id.  Here, howev-\ner, putative class member’s injuries could be caused by at least any of the three above stated sce-\nnarios. \n  The Court follows this rabbit trail only to demonstrate that problems would still exist \nwith class certification even if Plaintiffs had more appropriately focused their legal claim on the \nState’s policies that truly cause their alleged harm.  The fact remains, however, that this is not the \nlegal claim Plaintiffs’ chose to pursue.  Instead, as detailed above, they challenged the 2011 Poli-\ncy and presently maintain that it is the “‘glue’ uniting the class.”  [Filing No. 105, at ECF p. 16-\n19.]  But merely identifying the 2011 Policy Change does not explain what common question \n- 32 - \n \n\ncan be answered for the class “in one stroke,” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551, and is no different \nthan the superficial question Plaintiffs originally proposed.  Accordingly, with respect to the \nclaim Plaintiffs did pursue, they “have identified no common factual or legal question that satis-\nfies the Rule 23(a)(2) standard.”  Jamie S., 668 F.3d at 497-98.14 \n  2.  Numerosity, Typicality, and Adequacy of Representation \nBecause Plaintiffs failed to carry their burden to establish commonality, the Court only \nbriefly addresses the remaining three Rule 23(a) requirements: numerosity, typicality, and ade-\nquate of representation.  Beginning with numerosity, it requires the putative class to be “[so \nlarge] that joinder of all members is impracticable.”  Kress, 694 F.3d at 892 (alteration in origi-\nnal).  Plaintiffs go to great lengths to demonstrate that their proposed class is sufficiently numer-\nous to render joinder impracticable.  [See Filing No. 74, at ECF p. 27-31.]  The Court, however, \ncannot adequately assess, let alone ultimately decide, whether numerosity is met.  This is be-\ncause, for all the reasons discussed in Section III.A above, putative class members are not ascer-\ntainable.  If class membership is unascertainable, there is no basis for the Court to conclude that \nthe putative class is “[so large] that joinder of all members is impracticable.”  Kress, 694 F.3d at \n892 (alteration in original).  Therefore, the Court concludes that numerosity is not met. \nThe typicality requirement is met if the named Plaintiffs’ claim “arises from the same \nevent or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members.”  \nOshana, 472 F.3d at 514 (citation and quotation marks omitted).  As noted by the Supreme \nCourt, “[t]he commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.”  Wal-Mart, \n131 S. Ct. at 2551 n.5 (alteration in original) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  This is true \n                                                 \n14 Even though the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims significantly overlap with the commonality in-\nquiry, the Court expresses no view regarding the ultimate merits of any individual Plaintiffs’ \nclaim.  It only decides that the integration-mandate claim as framed does not present a common \nquestion of law, the answer of which could settle the matter for all members of the putative class. \n- 33 - \n \n\nhere, as the same difficulties with Plaintiffs’ attempt to establish commonality prevent them from \nestablishing typicality.  As discussed at length regarding commonality, the harm alleged by \nPlaintiffs could be caused by a number of FSSA policies and actions, or even caused by putative \nclass members’ own choices.  The Court is therefore unable to conclude that typicality is met, as \nPlaintiffs’ integration-mandate claim does not arise from the “same event or practice or course of \nconduct.”  Oshana, 472 F.3d at 514 (citation and quotation marks omitted). \nFinally, the Court addresses whether “the representative parties will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  This inquiry is composed of two \nparts: “the adequacy of the named plaintiff’s counsel, and the adequacy of representation provid-\ned in protecting the different, separate, and distinct interest[s] of the class members.”  Retired \nChicago Police Ass’n v. City of Chicago, 7 F.3d 584, 598 (7th Cir. 1993) (citation and quotation \nmarks omitted).  To adequately represent the class, the representative plaintiff “must be part of \nthe class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.”  Am-\nchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 625 (1997) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  \nThe Court has no reason to doubt the adequacy of Plaintiffs’ counsel.  However, “[t]he adequa-\ncy-of-representation requirement tend[s] to merge with the commonality and typicality criteria of \nRule 23(a), which serve as guideposts for determining whether . . . maintenance of a class action \nis economical and whether the named plaintiff’s claim and the class claims are so interrelated \nthat the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.”  \nId. at 626 n.20 (citation and quotation marks omitted).  For the same reasons the Court concluded \nthat commonality and typicality are not met, the Court cannot conclude that all Plaintiffs’ legal \ninjuries were caused by the same policy such that they would adequately represent the interests \n- 34 - \n \n\nof  absent  class  members.    Accordingly,  the  Court  cannot  conclude  that  the  adequacy-of-\nrepresentation requirement is met. \nC.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) \nThe Court turns finally to whether the putative class is certifiable under Rule 23(b)(2).  \nFor many of the reasons already articulated above, the Court concludes that it is not.  This pro-\nvides a third independent basis to deny Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify. \nA class may be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) if “the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corre-\nsponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(2).  “The key to the (b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory \nremedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlaw-\nful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.”  Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557 (ci-\ntation and quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, “[t]he injunctive or declaratory relief sought \nmust be final to the class as a whole.”  Jamie S., 668 F.3d at 499 (citation and quotation marks \nomitted).  “In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory \njudgment would provide relief to each member of the class.  It does not authorize class certifica-\ntion when each individual class member would be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory \njudgment against the defendant.”  Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557. \nThe difficulty with Plaintiffs’ proposed class is revealed by Plaintiffs’ lack of clarity re-\ngarding the relief sought and, correspondingly, an explanation of how that requested relief meets \nthe requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).  In their supplemental opening brief, Plaintiffs do not identify \nthe specific remedy they seek in arguing that Rule 23(b)(2) is met.  Instead, they merely assert \nthat “this action concerns the enforcement of generally applicable practices of the State to indi-\n- 35 - \n \n\nviduals enrolled in Medicaid waiver programs.  The state has acted or refused to act on grounds \napplicable to the class as a whole.”  [Filing No. 74, at ECF p. 35.]  Such a statement, even if oth-\nerwise sufficient, only addresses the first clause of Rule 23(b)(2).  It does not identify the relief \nsought or explain why that relief is “final” and “appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nThe State responds by identifying two instances earlier in the litigation where Plaintiffs \narticulated the injunctive relief sought.  [Filing No. 97, at ECF p. 33.]  Specifically, the State \nnotes that Plaintiffs’ Complaint requested an injunction requiring the FSSA to continue provid-\ning the putative class services through the A&D Waiver, [Filing No. 97, at ECF p. 33 (citing Fil-\ning No. 1, at ECF p. 18)], and the Intervenor Plaintiffs’ Complaint similarly requests an injunc-\ntion requiring the FSSA to provide “adequate services” to the putative class members, [Filing \nNo. 97, at ECF p. 33 (citing Filing No. 88-1, at ECF p. 15)].  The State argues that this type of \nrelief fails to meet Rule 23(b)(2) for the same reasons that rule was not met in Jamie S.—namely, \nthat the requested injunction would not be “final” because “the relief sought would merely initi-\nate a process through which highly individualized determinations” would have to be made re-\ngarding what services are “adequate” for each putative class member.  [Filing No. 97, at ECF p. \n33 (quoting Jamie S., 668 F.3d at 499).] \nWhen the Court pressed Plaintiffs at the hearing to articulate the precise injunctive relief \nsought, Plaintiffs were equivocal in that they offered two very different potential injunctions: (1) \nensure that those terminated from the A&D Waiver as a result of the 2011 Policy Change have \naccess to the services they need; or (2) require the State to inform all class members of the avail-\nability of the CIH Waiver and allow them to apply for it before they lose services.  Plaintiffs \nhave never articulated, however—in their briefing or at the hearing—how either of these injunc-\n- 36 - \n \n\ntions meets the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).  This failure alone precludes certification of the \nclass. \nBut even if the Court inferred the reasons Plaintiffs believe these injunction to be suffi-\ncient, both proposed injunctions fall short of the Rule 23(b)(2) requirements.  For the same rea-\nsons the putative class is not ascertainable—particularly the difficulty in determining whether \none “requires” more services than available on the FS Waiver—an injunction requiring the FSSA \nto ensure that those terminated from the A&D Waiver receive the services they require would \n“merely initiate a process through which highly individualized determinations of liability and \nremedy are made.”  Jamie S., 668 F.3d at 499.  Individuals are placed on a waiver program for \nwhich they qualify, after which they submit an individualized budget plan to the FSSA that it can \neither accept or reject.  [Filing No. 58-4, at ECF p. 6.]  Therefore, like the relief requested in Ja-\nmie S., this “kind of relief would be class-wide in name only, and it would certainly not be final.”  \n668 F.3d at 499.  Put differently, while such an injunction would affect the entire class, it would \n“require[] [at least hundreds if not thousands] of individual determinations of class membership, \nliability, and appropriate remedies.”15  Id. \nPlaintiffs’ other requested remedy fares no better.  Requiring the FSSA to inform all pu-\ntative class members of the availability of the CIH Waiver would only potentially remedy the \nalleged legal violation for a subset of class members.  As made clear in Section III.B above, the \nalleged violation of the integration mandate is caused by a variety of FSSA policies or class \n                                                 \n15 Plaintiffs’ reliance on B.N. ex rel A.N. v. Murphy, 2011 WL 4496510 (N.D. Ind. 2011), is mis-\nplaced.  In that case, the plaintiffs challenged the State’s cap on respite care services.  See id. at \n*2-3.  The court concluded that Rule 23(b)(2) was met and, in doing so, rejected the State’s ar-\ngument that “respite care services are highly personalized” and “based on the needs of each indi-\nvidual client” because the plaintiffs were challenging a generally applicable policy of capping \nrespite care services.  Id. at *5.  But as discussed at length above, and unlike in B.N., putative \nclass members in this case are not readily ascertainable; even if they were, the ultimate cause of \nany institutionalization they face is not uniform among putative class members. \n- 37 - \n \n\nmembers’ inaction—namely, the FS Waiver budget cap combined with an individual’s failure to \nreceive services via the CIH Waiver.  But there is no evidence of a single cause of the class \nmembers’ failure to be enrolled in the CIH Waiver.  Without such uniformity, different injunc-\ntions would be required to remedy the alleged legal violation depending on class members’ par-\nticular circumstances.  Rule 23(b)(2), therefore, could not be satisfied because no “single injunc-\ntion or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.”  Wal-Mart, 131 \nS. Ct. at 2557 (emphasis added). \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs have failed to show that the putative class is certifiable under \nRule 23(b)(2).  Accordingly, this provides a third independent basis for denying Plaintiffs’ Mo-\ntion to Certify. \n   \n- 38 - \n \n\nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe Court is not unsympathetic to the developmentally disabled individuals who are be-\ning transitioned off of the more generous but inappropriate A&D Waiver, to a less generous \nwaiver program that corresponds to their appropriate level of care following the 2011 Policy \nChange.  Based on the terms of the State’s Medicaid Waivers that are approved by the federal \ngovernment, the 2011 Policy Change was necessary to comply with the requirements of those \nwaivers.  This change affected the services provided to a number of developmentally disabled \nindividuals.  However, the proposed class definition makes class membership impossible to as-\ncertain without a painstaking and highly individualized review of approximately 14,000 case \nfiles.  Moreover, even if class membership could easily be ascertained, Plaintiffs have failed to \ncarry their burden of establishing the Rule 23(a) requirements, particularly due to their failure to \nidentify a common question that unites them.  Finally, Plaintiffs have also failed to identify a \nsingle injunction that would allow the Court to vindicate any found violations of the integration \nmandate for the class as a whole, or in such a manner that the injunction would be final.  Accord-\ningly, this case is not one where class treatment of the claims is warranted. \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Permissive Intervention and to Join in Pending \nMotion for Class Certification is GRANTED, [Filing No. 88], and Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify \nis DENIED, [Filing No. 3]. \n \n \n \n \n \n- 39 - \n \n\nDistribution via ECF only to all counsel of record   \n- 40 - \n ",

In support of this Motion, the plaintiff states as follows: \n1.  Karla Steimel is a Medicaid recipient who is currently enrolled in the Aged and Disabled \nWaiver Program (“A&D Waiver”), and has been for approximately eight (8) years.  In the recent \npast, she was informed by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration that, due to a \nchange in policies, she can no longer receive services through that program because she (a) is \ndevelopmentally disabled and (b) does not possess “skilled medical needs” or “skilled nursing \nneeds” (such as suctioning, ventilation, or medication administration).  While Ms. Steimel does \nnot know the precise date that she will be removed from the A&D Waiver, correspondence with \nher case manager has led her to believe that this may occur in two (2) weeks or less. \n2.  Instead, Ms. Steimel is being offered placement on the Family Supports Waiver Program \n(“FS Waiver”).  This is a smaller waiver program that provides services that are insufficient to \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 5   Filed 06/14/13   Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 92\nmeet Ms. Steimel’s needs: while she currently receives approximately forty (40) hours each week \nin  waiver  services—which  are  necessary  to  assist  Ms.  Steimel  with  transferring,  bathing, \ntoileting, preparing meals, and countless other activities of daily living—through the FS Waiver \nshe would only be able to receive approximately forty (40) hours each month in services.  This \nwould place her in grave risk of immediate and irreparable harm. \n3.  Ms. Steimel, on behalf of three (3) putative classes in this case, is raising multiple legal \nclaims.  However, at present she is only seeking a preliminary injunction on her claim that the \nelimination of persons with developmental disabilities who do not have skilled medical needs—\nthat is, do not routinely require skilled nursing services—from the A&D Waiver violates the \n“integration mandate” of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973 (paragraph 74 of her complaint).  This is the claim that is brought on behalf of Ms. \nSteimel and putative Class C.  Ms. Steimel does not waive her right to seek preliminary relief on \neither of her other claims as circumstances dictate. \n4.  The grounds for a preliminary injunction are as follows: \na.  Ms. Steimel is likely to prevail on the merits of her legal claim. \n \nb.  Absent preliminary relief, she will be caused irreparable harm for which there is no \nadequate remedy at law. \n \nc.  The balance of the harms favors the grant of a preliminary injunction in this matter. \n \nd.  The public interest favors the grant of a preliminary injunction. \n \n5.  The preliminary injunction should be issued without bond.  Additionally, if this Court \ncertifies Class C, the preliminary injunction should extend to the unnamed members of the class. \n6.  Ms. Steimel intends to support this Motion with affidavits and/or other evidence and a \nmemorandum of law which will be filed in the near future or pursuant to a schedule set by this \nCourt or agreed to by the parties.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 5   Filed 06/14/13   Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 93\n  WHEREFORE,  the  plaintiff  respectfully  requests  that  a  preliminary  injunction  be \ngranted in this cause, without bond, prohibiting the defendants from removing Ms. Steimel from \nthe A&D Waiver pending further order of the Court, and requests all other proper relief. \n \n \n \n \n_/s/ Gavin M.

Magnus-Stinson, Judge. \n  \nARGUED JANUARY 5,  2016  --  DECIDED MAy  10,  2016 \n  \nBefore  Woop,  Chief Judge,  and  KANNE  and  ROVNER,  Circuit \nJudges. \nWoop,  Chief  fudge.  No  one  would  accuse  the  Medicaid \nprogram  of  simplicity,  Our  task  in  this  appeal  is  to  consider \nwhether  Indiana  has  chosen  an  acceptable  way  to  deliver  cer- \ntain  home-  and  community-based  services.  It  does  so  through \nso-called  waiver  programs  that  are  operated  by  state  Medi- \ncaid  agencies.  The  word  “waiver”  is  used  because  the  default \nassumption under Medicaid  is  that these kinds  of services  will \nbe  delivered  in  institutions.  Congress  has  recognized,  how- \never,  that  many  people  are  better  served  by  and  prefer  com- \nmunity-based  care.  For  these  people,  it  uses  waiver  programs \nunder  which  the  state  (and  the  federal  government)  will  pick \nup  the  tab. \nThe  Indiana  Family  and  Social  Services  Administration \n(the Agency)  runs  three waiver programs  relevant  to  this  case: \nthe  Aged  and  Disabled  Medicaid  Waiver  Program  (A&D \nwaiver),  the  Community  Integration  and  Habilitation  Medi- \ncaid  Waiver  Program  (CLH  waiver),  and  the  Family  Supports \nMedicaid  Waiver  Program  (FS  waiver).  importantly  for  our \ncase,  the  programs  vary  in  how  much  money  each  client  can \nreceive,  what  must  be  dermonstrated  to  qualify  for  aid,  and \nwho  is  entitled  to  assistance.  Because  Indiana  has  closed  most \nof  its  institutional  facilities,  these  waiver  programs  serve  the \n \nNos.  15-2377  &  15-2389  3 \nvast  majority  of people  with  disabilities  in Indiana.  The  state’s \ntotal  institutional  capacity can  accommodate  only  one  quarter \nof  the  number  of  people  on  the  CHH  waiver  alone. \nUntil  2011,  the Agency  placed  many  people  with  develop- \nmental  disabilities  on  the  A&D  waiver,  which  has  no  cap  on \nservices.  That  changed  when  the  Agency  decided  that  it  had \nnot been  adhering  to  certain  A&D  rules.  In  order  to  fix  its  mis- \ntakes,  it  enacted  a  policy  change  that  rendered  many  develop- \nmentally  disabled  persons,  including  the  plaintiffs,  ineligible \nfor  care  uncer  the  A&é:D  waiver,  These  people  were  moved  to \nthe  FS  waiver,  under  which  they  may  receive  services  worth \nno  more  than  $16,545  annually.  Developmentally  disabled \npeople  who  were  switched  from  the  A&D  waiver  to  the  FS \nwaiver  may  apply  for  the  CEH waiver,  which  is  uncapped.  But \nnot  everyone  qualifies  tor  the  CTH  waiver,  and  so  this  possi- \nbility  is  an  empty  one  for  many. \nThe  plaintiffs  in  the  two  cases  we  have  consolidated  for \ndisposition  are  developmentally  disabled  persons  who  were \nmoved  from  the  A&D  waiver  to  the  Fs  waiver.  They  argue \nthat  their  new  assignment  violates  the  integration  mandate  of \nthe Americans  with Disabilities Act  (ADA),  42 U.S.C.  $8  12101 \net sey.,  because  it  deprives  therm  of community  interaction  and \nputs  them  at  risk  of  institutionalization.  They  also  seek  class \ncertification. \nfendants  on  the  integration-mandate  claims  and  denied  class \ncertification.  We  conclude  that  there  is  a  genuine  dispute  of \nmaterial  fact  with  respect  to  the  individual  claims  based  on \nthe  integration  mandate,  and  so  jyudement  for  the  defendants \nto  that  extent  was  premature.  The  district  court  did  not  abuse\n  \n4  Nos,  15-2377  &  15-2389 \nits  discretion,  however,  in  declining  to  certify  the  class,  be- \ncause  the  proposed  class  is  too  vague. \nI \nA \nIn  1981,  Congress  enacted  Section  1915(c)  of  the  Social  Se- \ncurity  Act  (SSA),  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n,  which  established  the \nHome  and  Community-Based  Care  Waiver  Program.  See  An- \ndrew  L  Batavia,  A  Right  to  Personal  Assistance  Services:  “Most \nIntegrated  Setting Appropriate”  Requirements  and  the Independent \nLiving  Model  of  Long-Term  Care,  27  AM,  J.L.  &  MED.  17,  24 \n(2001).  The  program  allowed  states  to  diverge  from  the  tradi- \ntional  Medicaid  structure  by  providing  community-based \nservices  to  people  who  would,  under  the  traditional  Medicaid \nstructure,  require  institutionalization.  Its  purpose  was  to \n“provid[e]  real  choices  and  opportunities  to  control  their  lives \nfor  individuais  who  wish  to  live  in  the  community”  and  allow \ndeviation  from  Medicaid's  traditional  “institutional  bias.”  Id. \nParticipating  states  have  significant  discretion in how  they \ncraft  their  waiver  programs.  Nonetheless,  the  programs  must \nconform  to  several  restrictions:  the  average  annual  cost  of  a \nstate’s  waiver  programs  cannot  exceed  that  of  institutional \nservices,  id.;  states  must  inform  eligible  persons  of  their  op- \ntions  and  allow  those  qualified  to  take  advantage  of  waiver \nslots  up  to  the  number  available,  id.;  and  states  must  comply \nwith  the  ADA's  integration  mandate,  which  dictates  that \nstates  “shall  administer  services,  programs,  and  activities  in \nthe  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  quali- \nfied  individuals with  disabilities,”  28  CER.  § 35.130(d)}  (1998).\n  \nNos.  15-2377  &  15-2389  5 \nB \nStates  submit  detailed  applications  tor  each  waiver  pro- \neram  to  the  Centers  for  Medicare  and  Medicaid  Services \n(CMS).  CMS  approves  waiver  programs  for  an  initial  term  of \nthree  years,  after  which  it  may  re-approve  them  for  five-year \nperiods.  The  A&D  waiver,  the  PS  waiver,  and  the  CTH  waiver \nall  fall  under  SSA  5  1915(c},  42  U.S.C.  §  1396n(c),  and  have \nbeen  approved  by  CMS.  (That  approval  is  not  at  issue  here.) \nThe  Agency  oversees  all  of  Indiana’s  waiver  programs, \nthrough  different  subdivisions  for  each  one. \nUnder  Indiana  law,  the  A&D  waiver  is  meant  “to  provide \nhome-  and  community-based  services  to  individuals wha,  but \nfor  the  provision  of  such  services,  would  require  nursing  fa- \ncility  level  of  care.”  The  Fs  waiver  provides  “waiver  services \nto  participants  of  any  age  residing  in  a  range  of  community \nsettings  as  an  alternative  to  care  in  an  intermediate  care  facil- \nity  for  individuals  with  intellectual  disabilities  ...  or  related \nconditions.”  The  CIF  waiver  provides  services  to  a  similar \npopulation  that  meets  additional  criteria.  While  the  PS  waiver \ncaps  services  at  $16,545  per  year,  there  is  no  cap  on  services \nunder  the  A&D  or  CIH  waivers.  Different  services  are  availa- \nble  under  each  waiver,  and  the  rules  for  reimbursement  vary \nby  program. \nWaiver  participants  may  also  use  services  provided \nthrough  the  state’s  traditional  Medicaid  plan.  These  include \n“prior-authorization  services,” 7  which  are  services  that  the \nstate  has  pre-approved  as  medically  necessary.  405  IND. \nADMIN,  CODE  §  5-3-13.  There  is  one  type  of  prior-authoriza- \ntion  service  relevant  to  this  case:  “home  health  services.”  [d. \n§  5-3-13(a}(9}.  Home-health  services  include  “[sfkilled  nurs- \n&\n  \n6  Nos,  15-2377  &  15-2389 \ning,”  “[hjome  health  aid  services,”  “[plhysical  and  occupa- \ntional  therapies,”  “[s}peech pathology  services,”  “[rjenal  dial- \nysis,”  and  “[tlelehealth  services.”  Id.  §  1-4.2-3(a).  Home- \nhealth  services,  as  the  name  suggests,  “must  be  performed  in \nthe  home.”  Id.  §  1-4.2-3.  If  a  service  is  available  under  both  the \nrelevant  waiver  and  the  state  Medicaid  programs,  partici- \npants  must  generally  use  prior-authorization  services  betore \ntapping  into  their  waiver  funds. \nThe  Agency  assigns  a  case  manager  to  each  waiver  partic- \nipant.  The  case  manager  works  with  the  participant  and  his  or \nher  guardian  to  determine  the  appropriate  services  for  that \nparticipant.  Certain services  are  available under some waivers \nbut  not under  others.  After  the  case  manager,  participant,  and \nguardian  create  an  individualized  plan,  the  case  manager \nsubmits  it  for  approval  to  the  appropriate  Agency  subdivi- \nsion. \nC \nIn  2006,  the  state  opened  the  A&D  waiver  to  persons  with \ndevelopmental  disabilities,  so  long  as  they  had  either  “skilled \nmedical  need”  or  substantial  functional  limitations.  In  2011,  it \nreversed  this  policy,  and  thereafter  alowed  only  people  who \ncould  demonstrate both a  skilled  medical need  and substantial \nfunctional  limitations  to  participate  in  the  A&D  waiver.  As \nspace  became  available  on  the  FS  waiver,  the  state  moved \nA&D  waiver  participants  to  the  FS  waiver. \nThe  plaintiffs  are  developmentally  disabled  people  who \nrely  on  Indiana’s  home-  and  community-based  Medicaid \nwaiver  programs.  Karla  Steimel  sutters  from  cerebral  palsy, \nwhile  Thomas  Maertz  has  been  diagnosed  with  both  cerebral \npaisy  and  mental  retardation.  Colton  and  Cody  Cole  are  twin\n  \nNos.  15-2377  &  15-2389  7 \nbrothers;  they  both  suffer  from  cerebral  palsy.  Timothy  Keis- \nter  has  been  diagnosed  with  mental  retardation.  Michael  and \nLois  Beckem  are  siblings;  Michael  has  been  diagnosed  with \nmild  mental  retardation,  and  Lois  has  Down’s  syndrome. \nBefore  2013,  the  plaintiffs  were  served  under  Indiana's \nA&D  waiver.  Under  the  A&D  waiver,  they  were  able  to  enjoy \ncommunity  activities  such  as  eating  in  restaurants,  visiting \nflea  markets,  and  window-shopping.  Michael  and  Lois \nBeckem  attended  day  services,  which  allowed  them  to  go  into \nthe  community  and  interact  with  people  without  disabilities. \nWhile  all  of  the  plaintiffs  suffer  from  severe  conditions,  none \nof  them  needs  the  skilled  medical  services  necessary  to  meet \nthe  prerequisites  of  the  A&D  waiver,  as  it  has  been  structured \nsince  2011.  All  were  shifted  to  the  FS  waiver  in  2015.  Later, \nKarla  Steimel  and  Timothy  Keister  were  moved  to  the  CIH \nwaiver;  they  concede  that  their  claims  are  moot.  While  Lois \nBeckem  has  since  been  moved  back  to  the  A&D  waiver,  she \nasserts  a  damages  claim.  The  Coles,  Maertz,  and  Michael \nBeckem  remain  on  the  FS  waiver. \nThe  plaintifts  stl  before  us  allege  that  their  forced  move \nto  the PS  waiver has  dramatically  curtailed  their  ability to  par- \nticipate  in  community  activities.  According  to  their  guardi- \nans  affidavits,  the  plaintiffs  were  able  to  enjoy  roughly  40 \nhours  in  the  community  each  week  under  the  A&D  waiver. \nSirice  their  transition  to  the  FS  waiver,  their  community  time \nhas  shrunk  to  10  to  12  hours  per  week.  This  roughly  30-hour- \nper-week  reduction  is  a  result  of  the  FS  waiver  cap,  under \nwhich  they  are  allowed  to  use  only  $16,545  in waiver  services. \n(That  amount  of  money  works  out,  plaintiffs  say,  to  roughly \n12  hours  per  week  in  services  that  can  be  used  outside  the \nhome.)  Although  the  plaintiffs  are  also  eligible  for  Medicaid\n  \n&  Nos,  15-2377  &  15-2389 \nprior-authorization  services,  those  services  may  not  be  used \noutside  the  home  and  so  are  not  relevant  to  these  claims. \nThe  plaintiffs’  guardians  also  aver  that  despite  the  availa- \nbility  of prior-authorization  services,  restrictions  on  those  ser- \nvices  have  led  to  lapses  in  supervision  that  have  cither  led  to \ninjury  or  serious  risk  of  injury  to  the  plaintiffs.  The  plaintiffs \ncontend  that,  given  the  limitations  on  prior-authorization  ser- \nvices  and  the  monetary  cap  on  the  FS  waiver,  these  gaps  in \nsupervision  are  unavoidable  and  have  put  them  at  serious \nrisk  of  institutionalization.  Tamara  Awald,  the  mother  of  Col- \nton  and  Cody  Cole,  also  indicates  that  she  has  had  to  pay  out- \nof-pocket  for  care  when  she  travels  for  work. \nKarla  Steimel  filed  her  initial  class-action  complaint  and \nmotion for  class  certification  on June  14,  2013.  Before  the  court \nruled  on  that  motion,  Maertz,  the  Coles,  and  Keister  moved \nfor  leave  to  intervene  as  named  plaintiffs.  The  district  court \ngranted  the  intervention  motion,  but  on  March  24,  2014  it  de- \nnied  class  certification.  The  Beckems  commenced  their  sepa- \nrate  case  on April  30,  2014. \nThe  parties  in  both  cases  filed  cross-motions  for  summary \njudgement.  The  state  argued  that  it  should  prevail  because  the \nplaintiffs’  claims  did  not  even  implicate  the  integration  man- \ndate,  while  the  plaintiffs  contended  that  they  were  entitled  to \njudgment  because  they  had  shown  beyond  dispute  that  the \nstate  was  violating  the  integration  mandate.  The  district  court \nboth  cases  on June  9,  2015.  This  appeal  followed.\n  \nNos.  15-2377  &  15-2389   \nO\nil \nCongress  intended  the  ADA  “to  provide  a  clear  and  com- \nprehensive  national  mandate  for  the  elimination  of  discrimi- \nnation  against  individuals  with  disabilities.”  Olmstead  v.  L.C. \nex  rel.  Zimring,  527  U.S.  581,  589  (1999)  (quoting  42 \nU.S.C.  §  12101(b)(1)).  Section  12132  decrees  that  “no  qualified \nindividual  with  a  disability  shall,  by  reason  of  such  disability, \nbe  excluded  from  participation  in  or  be  denied  the  benefits  of \nthe  services,  programs,  or  activities  of  a  public  entity,  or  be \nsubjected  to  discrimination  by  any  such  entity.”  A  “public  en- \ntity”  includes  “any State  or local  government”  or  “any  depart- \nment  for]  agency  ...  of  a  State  ...  or  local  government.”  Id. \n88  12131(C( A),  (B).  A  “qualified  individual  with  a  disability” \nis  someone  who,  “with  or  without  reasonable  modifications \nto  rules,  policies,  or  practices  ...  meets  the  essential  eligibility \nrequirements  for  the  receipt  of  services  or  the  participation  in \nprograms  or  activities  provided  by  a  public  entity.”  Id. \n§  12131(2). \nThe  ADA  directs  the  Attorney  General  to  “promulgate \nregulations  ...  that  implement”  the  provisions  of  Title  H,  in- \ncluding  §  12132.  Id.  §  12134(a).  In  response  to  this  command, \nthe  Attorney  Gerieral  implemented  the  regulation  known  as \nthe  “integration  mandate.”  The  integration  mandate  states \nthat  “[a]  public  entity  shall  administer  services,  programs, \nand  activities  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  the \nneeds  of  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities.”  28  CER. \n&  35.130(d)  (1998).  The  regulations’  preamble  defines  “the \nmost  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  qualified \nindividuals  with  disabilities”  as  “a  setting  that  enables  indi- \nviduals with  disabilities  to  interact with non-disabled  persons \nto  the  fullest  extent  possible.”  28  C.FLR.  pt.  35,  App.  B.  Public\n  \n10  Nos,  15-2377  &  15-2389 \nentities  are  required  to  “make  reasonable  modifications”  to \navoid  “discrimination  on  the  basis  of  disability”  except  if  do- \ning  so  would  “fundamentally  alter”  the  nature  of  the  pro- \ngrams.  28  CER.  §  35.130(b}(7). \nBecause  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act \nand  its  regulations  are  “materially  identical”  to  their  ADA \ncounterparts,  Bruggeman  ex  rel.  Bruggeman  v.  Blagojevich,  324 \nF.3d  906,  912  (7th  Cir.  2003),  courts  “construe  and  apply  them \nin  a  consistent  manner.”  Radaszewski  ex  rel.  Radaszewski  v. \nMaram,  383  F.3d  599,  607  (7th  Cir,  2004).  The  state  does  not \nchallenge  the  validity  of  any  of  the  regulatory  provisions  at \nissue, \nWe  address  the  parties’  arguments  in  two  stages:  first,  we \nconsider  whether  the  plaintiffs’  claims  fall  within  the  scope  of \nthe  integration  mandate;  and  second,  we  ask  whether  the \nstate’s  policy  violated  the  mandate.  The  plaintifis  offer  two \ntheories  for  our  consideration:  (1)  that  the  state’s  policies  have \nimpermissibly  rendered  the  plaintiffs  institutionalized  in \ntheir  own  homes,  and  (2)  that  the  state’s  policies  have  put \nthem  at  serious  risk  of  institutionalization. \nWe  review  de  novo  the  district  court’s  decision  to  grant \nsummary  judgment.  Advance  Cable  Co.,  LLC  v.  Cincinnati  Ins. \nCo.,  788  F.3d  743,  746  (7th  Cir,  2015).  When  reviewing  cross- \nmotions  for  summary  judgement,  we  “take  the  motions  one  at \na  time  and  then,  as  usual,  construe  all  facts  and  draw  all  rea- \nsonable  inferences  in favor of the  non-moving party.”  Id.  Sum- \nmary judgment  is  appropriate  only  “if the  movant  shows  that \nthere  is  no  genuine  dispute  as  to  any material  fact  and  the  mo- \nvant  is  entitled  to  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law.”  PED.  R.

The  Supreme  Court  held  that \n“discrimination”  under  §  12132  included  “not  only  disparate \ntreatment  of  comparably  situated  persons  but  also  undue  in- \nstitutionalization  of  disabled  persons,  no  matter  how  anyone \nelse  is  treated.”  Amundson  ex  rel.  Amundson  v.  Wisconsin  Dep't  of \nHealth  Servs.,  721  F.3d  871,  874  (7th  Cir,  2013)  (citing  Olmstead, \n527  U.S.  at  597-603). \nOlmstead  dealt  only  with  the  problem  of  unjustified  insti- \ntutional  segregation.  See  Olmstead,  527  U.S.  at  600.  Its  ra- \ntionale,  however,  reaches  more  broadly.  The  Court  saw  “two \nevident judgments”  in  the  integration  mandate.  Id.  The  first  is \nthat  “institutional  placement  of  persons  who  can  handle  and \nbenefit  from  community  settings  perpetuates  unwarranted \nassumptions  that  persons  so  isolated  are  incapable  or  unwor- \nthy  of  participating  in  community  life.”  Id.  The  second  is  that \n“confinement  in  an  institution  severely  diminishes  the  every- \nday  life  activities  of  individuals,  inchiding  family  relations, \nsocial  contacts,  work  options,  economic  independence,  edu- \ncational  advancement,  and  cultural  enrichment.”  Id.  at  601. \nThe  Court  had  no  occasion  to  consider  whether  the  same \nevils  it  had  identified  for  institutional  placements  might  exist \nin  some  settings  outside  of  an  institution,  This  case  presents \nthat  question:  whether  isolation  in  the  home  for  a  person \n“who  can  handle  and  benefit  from”  time  out  in  the  general \ncommunity  is  also  inconsistent  with  the  integration  mandate.\n  \n12  Nos,  15-2377  &  15-2389 \nWe  see  no  reason  why  the  same  analysis  should  not  apply. \nSee,  2.¢.,  Mark  C.

Isolation  in  a  home  can  just  as \n“severely  diminish{]  the  everyday  life  activities”  of  people \nwith  disabilities.  Olmstead,  527  U.S.  at  601.  In  fact,  although \nfamily  relations  might  be  enhanced  at  home  if  people  are \naround,  isolation  in  a  home  may  often  be  worse  than  confine- \nment  to  an  institution  on  every  other  measure  of  “life  activi- \nties”  that  Olmstead  recognized. \nIn  accordance  with  Olmstead,  the  Department  of  Justice \nhas  released  guidance  directing  that  the  integration  mandate \nbe  read  broadly.

The  degree  of \ndeference  is  another  matter:  Olmstead said  nothing  on  the  sub- \nject.  In  general,  we  defer  to  an  agency's  interpretation  of  its \nown  regulation  unless  the  agency's  interpretation  is  “plainly \nerroneous  or inconsistent with  the regulation”  or  “there is  rea- \nson  to  suspect that the  agency’s  interpretation  ‘does  not reflect \nthe  agency’s  fair  and  considered  judgment  on  the  matter  in \nquestion.”  Christopher  vo.

The \nmandate  “extend{s]  to  persons  at  serious  risk  of  institutional- \nization  or  segregation  and  fis}  not  limited  to  individuals  cur- \nrently in institutional  or  other segregated  settings.”  Id.  Pinally, \nso  long  as  any  additional  services  do  not  cause  a  furidamental \nalteration  in  the  state  program,  the  state  may  be  required  to \nprovide  them;  budget  cuts  can  violate  the  integration  man- \ndate.  Id.  Given  the  integration  mandate’s  maximalist  lan- \nguage—it  demands  “the  most  integrated  setting  appropri- \nate,”  28  CER,  §  35.100(d),  which  it  defines  as  allowing  inter- \naction  with  non-disabled  persons  “to  the  fullest  extent  possi- \nble,”  28  CER.  pt.  35,  App.  B— we  have  no  reason not to  follow\n  \n14  Nos,  15-2377  &  15-2389 \nthe  DOJ’s  interpretation  of  the  mandate.  And  the  mandate,  as \nwe  have  noted,  logically  applies  to  all  settings,  not  just  to  in- \nstitutional  settings.  It  bars  unjustified  segregation  of  persons \nwith  disabilities,  wherever  it  takes  place. \nThe  state  responds  with  a  narrow  reading  of  the  integra- \ntion  mandate  and  an  unwillingness  to  engage  with  the  DO}’s \ninterpretation.  It  argues  that  the  integration  mandate  covers \nonly  claims  by  people  who  literally  have  been  institutional- \nized,  and  that  a  person  with  a  disability  who  is  housed  in  the \ncommunity  is  therefore  outside  its  scope.  The  state  insists  that \n“setting”  refers  only  to  two  kinds  of  physical  structures:  an \ninstitution  or  a  location  in  the  community.  But  there  is  no  rea- \nson  to  think  that  the  mandate  presents  such  a  crabbed  binary. \nFirst,  “there  is nothing  in  the  plain language  of the  regulations \nthat limits  protection  to  persons  who  are  currently institution- \nalized.”  Pashby  v.  Delia,  709  F.3d  307,  322  (4th  Cir,  2013)  (quot- \ning  Fisher  v,  Oklahoma  Health  Care  Auth,,  335  F.3d  1175,  1181 \n(10th  Cir,  2003)).  The  mandate’s  text  uses  the  general  word \n“setting”  and  states  that  people  are  entitled  to  be  served  “in \nthe  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  quali- \nfied  individuals  with  disabilities.”  26  C.F.R.  §35.130(d).  The \n“most  integrated  setting  appropriate”  is  “a  setting  that  ena- \nbles  individuals with  disabilities  to  interact with non-disabled \npersons  to  the  fullest  extent possible.”  28  CER.  pt.  35,  App.  B. \nJust  as  importantly,  there  is  plentiful  evidence  that  the \nstate's  interpretation  is  incorrect.  When  interpreting  adminis- \ntrative  rules,  a  court  asks  first  “whether  the  language  at  issue \nhas  a  plain  and  unambiguous  meaning with regard  to  the  par- \nticular  dispute  in  the  case.”  Exelon  Generation  Co.,  LLC  v.  Local \n15,  Int’l  Bhd.  of Elec.  Workers,  AFL-CIO,  676  F.3d  566,  570  (7th \nCir.  2012).  In  doing  so,  the  court  “givies]  the  words  used  their\n  \nNos.  15-2377  &  15-2389  15 \nordinary  meaning.”  Lawson  v.  FMR  LLC,  1348.  Ct.  1158,  1165 \n(2014)  Ginternal  citation omitted).  Neither  the  ADA not  its  reg- \nulations  specifically  define  the  word  “setting.”  Ordinarily, \nthat  word  denotes  an  environment  or  situation  rather  than \nany  particular  physical  structure.  See  THE  AMERICAN \nHERITAGE  DICTIONARY  OF  THE  ENGLISH  LANGUAGE  1593  (4th \ned.  2000)  (The  context  and  environment  in  which  a  situation \nis  set;  the  background.”);  RANDOM HOUSE WEBSTER’S COLLEGE \nDICTIONARY  1200  (2d  ed.  1999)  (\"[T]he  surroundings  or  envi- \nronment  of  anything.”);  MERRIAM-WEBSTER’S  COLLEGIATE \nDICTIONARY  1072  (10th  ed.  1994)  (“[T]he  time,  place,  and  cir- \ncumstances  in  which  something  occurs  or  develops].}”).  The \nregulation’s  use  of  the  word  “most”  (integrated)  and  its  refer- \nence  to  “a”  setting  also  imply  more  than  two  possibilities. \nIf  these  facts  stick  a  knife  in  the  state’s  argument,  the  DOJ \nguidelines  twist it.  They specifically include  the  plaintiffs’ two \ntheories  within  the  integration  mandate’s  ambit.  Moreover, \nthe ADA and  the  integration  mandate’s  “protections  would  be \nmeaningless  if  plaintiffs  were  required  to  segregate  them- \nselves  by  entering  an  institution  before  they  could  challenge \nan  allegedly  discriminatory  law  or  policy  that  threatens  to \nforce  them  into  segregated  isolation.”  Fisher,  335  F.3d  at  1181. \nIn  this  case,  the  plaintiffs’  quandary  is  Kafkaesque:  Indiana’s \ninstitutions  can  serve  only  a  quarter  of  the  persons  with  disa- \nbilities  currently  on  the  CIH  waiver  alone.  Even  if  the  plain- \ntiffs  had  to  be  institutionalized,  if  is  quite  passible  that  they \ncould  not  be. \nAmundson  is  not  to  the  contrary.  Nowhere  did  Amundson \nindicate  that segregation within the  community beyond  an in- \nstitution’s  walls  could  not  implicate  the  integration  mandate. \nThe  Amundson  plaintiffs  did  not  present  such  a  claim,  and  so\n  \n16  Nos,  15-2377  &  15-2389 \nthe  opinion  does  not  address  it.  Amundson  decided  instead \nthat  the  plaintiffs’  claims  were  not  ripe  because  they  had  not \npleaded  sufficient  facts  to  allege  that  they  were  at  serious  risk \nof  institutionalization.  While  some  of  the Amundson  plaintifts \nhad  been  required  to  leave  group  homes,  they  did  “not  allege \ninability  to  find  another  group  home  willing  to  accept  the \nlevel  of  reimbursement”  Wisconsin  was  offering.  721  F.3d  at \n873-74.  Wisconsin  had  represented  that  it  had  “safeguards  in \nplace  that  [would]  prevent  any  plaintiff  from  being  trans- \nferred  to  an  institution”;  the  plaintiffs  had  not  given  “suffi- \ncient  reason  to  think  that  these  fwould]  fail.”  fd.  at  874. \nAmundson  did  not  mention  the  DO]  Guidance  one  way  or  the \nother;  the  state  thus  overreaches  when  it  contends  that \nAmundson  “presumably”  rejected  the  DOJ  Guidance. \nThe  plaintiffs  in our  case have  provided  evidence  that they \nneed  constant  supervision  and,  despite  their  best  efforts,  the \nservices  provided  under  the  FS  waiver  have  proved  inade- \nquate  to  prevent  life-threatening  gaps  in  care.  Again  turning \nto  Amundson,  the  state  argues  that  the  hypothetical  availabil- \nity  of  a  CLH  waiver  is  a  sufficient  safeguard.  But  the  state  did \nnot  present  this  argument  to  the  district  court,  and  it  is  there- \nfore  waived.  See  Donika  v.  Portage  Cnty,  Wis.,  523  F.3d  776,  783 \n(7th  Cir,  2008).  Even  if  if  were  not,  the  CTH  waiver  is  arnong \nthe  measures  the  plaintiffs  argue  they  need  to  prevent  their \ninstitutionalization.  The  plaintiffs  have  provided  evidence \nthat  they  are  at  serious  risk  of  being  institutionalized.  At  this \npoint,  the  state  has  provided  no  evidence  to  the  contrary  and \nhas  decided  that  the  plaintiffs  are  currently  ineligible  for  the \nCIH  waiver.  This  is  enough  fo  raise  a  genuine  question  of  fact \nabout  the  adequacy  of  the  CIH  waiver  as  a  safeguard  against \na  serious  risk  of  institutionalization.  The  plaintifts’  claims  are \ntherefore  ripe.\n  \nNos.  15-2377  &  15-2389  i/ \nAnother  argument  the  state  advances  to  avoid  the  integra- \ntion  mandate  rests  on  language  in  Amundson  and  a  footnote \nin  Olnistead,  both  of which  it  reads  to  support  the  idea  that  the \nintegration  mandate  imposes  neither  a  “standard  of care”  nor \n“a  certain  level  of  benefits  to  individuals  with  disabilities.” \nOlmstead,  527  U.S.  at  603  1.14:  Amundson,  721  F.3d  at  875 \n(holding  that  the  ADA  does  not  support  “a  claim  of  absolute \nentitlement”  to  Medicaid  benefits);  see  also  Cohon  ex  rel.  Bass \nv.  New Mexico Dep't of Health,  646  F.3d  717,729  (10th Cir,  2011) \n(holding  that  ADA  did  not  give  plaintiff  “legal  entitlement” \nto  specific  requested  services  and  that  she  did  not  state  an \nOlmstead  claim  because  she  failed  to  allege  that  the  program \nwould  lead  to  her  unjustified  isolation  or  premature  institu- \ntionalization);  Rodriguez  v.  City  of New  York,  197  F.3d  611,  619 \n(2d  Cir.  1999)  (noting  that  “Olmstead  reaffirms  that  the  ADA \ndoes  not  mandate  the  provision  of  new  benefits”  and  “ad- \ndressed  only  [}  where  Georgia  should  provide  treatment,  not \nwhether  it  must  provide  it”). \nThe problem  with  that argument is  that it misconstrues  the \nplaintiffs’  theory.  They  have  not  argued  that  they  have  an  ab- \nsolute  entitlement to  any  particular  services  or  program.  They \ninstead  seek  access  to  existing  benefits  available  under  either \nthe  uncapped  A&D  or  CTH  waivers— benefits  that  have  been \ngranted  to  some  persons  with  disabilities,  but  not  to  them. \nWhile  “a  State  is not obligated  to  create new services,”  it  “may \nviolate  Title  Tl  when  it  refuses  to  provide  an  existing  benefit \nto  a  disabled  person  that  would  enable  that  individual  to  live \nin  a  more  community-integrated  setting.”  Radaszewski,  383 \nF.3d  at  609  (citing  Olmstead,  327  U.S.  at  603  1.14  for  the  princi- \nple  “that  States  must  adhere  to  the  ADA’s  nondiscrimination \nrequirement with  regard  to  the  services  they in fact provide’). \nThe  plaintiffs  seek  services  that  exist  and  are  given  to  others.\n  \n18  Nos,  15-2377  &  15-2389 \nThe  state  may  already  be  providing  at  least  some  of  those  ser- \nvices  through  the  prior-authorization  program,  albeit  not  out \nin  the  community.  That,  in  fact,  is  the  key  difference  between \nwaiver  and  prior-authorization  services:  the  former  are  more \nflexible  with  regard  to  their  timing  and  may  be  used  outside \nthe  home  in  the  community;  the  latter  must  be  used  in  the \nhome. \nThe  state’s  final  plea  invokes  vagueness:  If  the  integration \nmandate  applies  to  a  multiplicity  of  “settings”  and  can  re- \nquire  the  shifting  of  resources  to  increase  community  partici- \npation,  where  will  it  end?  The  short  answer  may  be  that  it \nends  wherever  the  state  has  chosen—this  is  an  anti-discrimi- \nnation  mandate,  as  we  said,  not  a  floor  or  ceiling.  Here,  the \nstate  has  ways  to  allow  otherwise  qualified  persons  to  spend \nupwards  of  40  hours  per  week  outside  their  home  and  in  the \ncommunity.  Tt  thus  may  not,  by  invoking  the  rules  of  its \nwaiver  program,  limit  qualified  persons  to  only  12  hours  in \nthe  community  each  week.  That  fails  to  “administer  services, \nprograms,  and  activities  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appro- \npriate  to  the  needs  of  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities.” \n28  CLLR.  §  35.130(d)}.  Based  on  the  purpose  and  text  of  the \nADA,  the  text  of  the  integration  mandate,  the  Supreme \nCourt's  rationale  in  Olmstead,  and  the  DOT  Guidance,  we  hold \nthat  the  integration  mandate  is  implicated  where  the  state’s \npolicies  have  either  (1)  segregated  persons  with  disabilities \nwithin  their  homes,  or  (2)  put  them  at  serious  risk  of  institu- \ntionalization. \nB \nBecause  it  thought  that  the  integration  mandate  was  not \neven  implicated  here,  the  district court  did  not reach  the  ques- \ntion  whether  it  was  violated.  We,  however,  must  press  on,  in\n  \nNos.  15-2377  &  15-2389  19 \nlight  of  our  conclusion  that  the  mandate  is  in  play.  On  cross- \nmotions  for  summary  jpidgment,  plaintiffs  presented  evi- \ndence  that  they  were  segregated  from  the  community  and \nthat  the  state’s  2011  policy  was  to  blame.  Without  challenging \nthe  contentions  about  the  degree  of  community  interaction \nplaintiffs  are  receiving,  the  state  presented  evidence  that \nshowed,  in  its  view,  that  the  2011  policy  change  was  not  the \ncause  of whatever  segregation  is  occurring. \n1 \nWe  turn  once  again  to  Olnistead  for  the  proper  way  to  ana- \nlyze  these  arguments.  It set out  a  test for  determining  whether \nthe  ADA's  integration  mandate  is  violated: \n(Under  Title  Il  of  the  ADA,  States  are  required \nto  provide  community-based  treatment  for  per- \nsons  with mental  disabilities  when  [1]  the  State’s \ntreatment  professionals  determine  that  such \nsons  do  not  oppose  such  treatment,  and  [3]  the \nplacement  can  be  reasonably  accommodated, \ntaking  into  account  the  resources  available  to \nthe  State  and  the  needs  of  others  with  mental \ndisabilities. \nOlmstead,  527  U.S.  at  607.  We  have  understood  this  to  be  the \nCourt's  last  word  on  the  point.  See  Omega  Healthcare  [nv’rs, \nInc.  v.  Res-Care,  fic.,  475  F.3d  853,  864  (th  Cir.  2007)  (noting \nthat  “Olmstead  stands  for  the  proposition  that  in  order  to \navoid  violating  the  [ADA],  the  placement  of  individuals  in \ncommunity-based  settings  is  appropriate”  when  the  test  is\n  \n20  Nos,  15-2377  &  15-2389 \nmet);  Radaszewski,  383  F.3d  at  608  Moting,  without  clearly  ap- \nplying  the  test,  that  “the  [Olmstead]  Court  agreed”  with  the \nplaintiffs’  formulation  of  it). \nThe  first  two  elements  of  the  test  appear  in  Section  ULA  of \nthe  Olinstead  decision,  which  commanded  a  majority  of  the \nCourt  and  is  thus  binding  on  us.  The  Court  noted  there  that \n(1)  “the  State  may  generally  rely  on  the  reasonable  assess- \nments  of  ifs  own  professionals  in  determining  whether  an  in- \ndividual  ‘meets  the  essential  eligibility  requirements”  of  the \nprogram,  and  (2)  that  there  exists  no  “federal  requirement \nthat community-based  treatment be  imposed  on  patients  who \ndo  not  desire  it.”  Olmstead,  527  US.  at  602. \nOimstead’s  articulation  of  the  third  element  of  the  test, \nhowever,  represents  the  thinking  of  only  a  plurality  of  the \nCourt.  Those  Justices  addressed  the  question  of  the  level  at \nwhich  the  “reasonable  modifications”  provision  should  be \nevaluated —thatis,  which  matters  should  be  considered  in  de- \nciding  whether  a  requirement  to  provide  integrated  care \nwould  constitute  a  fundamental  alteration  of  the  state’s  pro- \ngram.  See  28  CPLR.  §  35.130(b)(7).  It  is  clear  that  some  version \nof the  “reasonable  modifications”  provision —and  its  flip  side, \nthe  fundamental-alteration  deferise—must  be  taken  into  ac- \ncount  before  deciding  that  the  integration  mandate  was  vio- \nlated.  Justice  Stevens,  concurring  in  the  judgment,  thought \nthat  the  fundamental-alteration  detense  rested  ultimately  on \nthe  facts;  he  thus  saw  no  need  to  delve  into  the  limitations  on \nthe  state’s  duty.  See  Olmstead,  527  U.S.  at  607-08  (Stevens,  J, \nconcurring  in  part  and  concurring  in  the  judgment).  Justice \nKennedy,  writing  for  himself  and  Justice  Breyer,  focused  on \nthe  need  for  courts  to  defer  to  the  treatment  decisions  of  the \ntreating  physicians,  lest  people  who  need  greater  care  are\n  \nNos.  15-2377  &  15-2389  Zi \nshoved  out into  the  community  inappropriately.  Id.  at 608-615 \n(Kennedy,  J.,  concurring  in  the  judgment). \nAs  long  as  we  bear  in  mind  the  cautionary  remarks  of  the \nconcurring  Justices,  we  see  nothing  to  prevent  our  use  of  Sec- \ntion  LLB  of  the  plurality’s  opinion  as  a  starting  point.  Its  artic- \nulation  of  the  “reasonable  modifications”  element  states  a \nsensible  level  at  which  to  analyze  the  question  whether  re- \nquiring  integrated  services  would  “fundamentally  alter”  the \nnature  of  the  programs.  28  C.P.R.  §  35.130(b)(7).  On  the  one \nhand,  a  “substantial[]  mcrease”  in  the  cost  of  a  few  of  plain- \ntiffs’  services  should  not  “defeat  fa]  Title  TD  claim.” \nRadaszewski,  383  F.3d  at  614,  Such  a  holding  would  eviscerate \nthe  integration  mandate.  See  id.  (“Tf  every  alteration  in  a  pro- \ngram  or  service  that  required  the  outlay  of  funds  were  tanta- \nmount  to  a  fundamental  alteration,  the  ADA’s  integration \nmandate  would  be  hollow  indeed.”  (quoting  Fisher,  335  F.3d \nat  1183)).  On  the  other hand,  looking  only  at the  cost of chang- \ning  the  plaintiffs’  care  would  be  unfair  to  the  state  and  fail  to \ngive  it  the  leeway  for  which  Justices  Kennedy  and  Breyer \ncalled,  “If  the  expense  entailed  in  placing  one  or  two  people \nin  a  community-based  treatment  program  is  properly  meas- \nured  for  reasonableness  against  the  State’s  entire  mental \nhealth  budget,  itis  unlikely  that  a  State,  relymg  on  the  funda- \nmental-alteration  defense,  could  ever  prevail.”  Olmstead,  527 \nUS.  at  603  (plurality  opinion). \nBy  specifying  that  both  the  “resources  available  to  the \nState”  and  “the  needs  of others  with  mental  disabilities”  must \nbe  taken  into  account,  the  plurality’s  test  allows  for  a  sensitive \nbalance  between  the  interests  of  the  state  and  the  interests  of \nthe  developmentally  disabied  persons.  The  test  also  prevents \na  state  from  describing  a  program  at  such  a  specific  level  of\n  \n22  Nos,  15-2377  &  15-2389 \ndetail  that  literally  any  change  would  result  in  a  “findamen- \ntal”  alteration.  In  the  end,  the  question  under  the  ADA  is  a \nsimple  one:  what effect will changing the state’s  practices have \non  the  provision  of  care  to  the  developmentally  disabled,  tak- \ning  into  account  the  resources  available  to  the  state  and  the \nneed  to  avoid  discrimination? \nThe  evaluation  of whether  a  change  would  fundamentally \nalter  the nature of a program should  be holistic.  Here,  the  state \nhas  produced  no  evidence  that  anything  approaching  a  fun- \ndamental  change  would  occur  if  the  programs  available  to \nthese  plaintiffs  were  handled  differently.  We  thus  do  not  re- \ngard  it  as  a  close  case, \n2 \nNeither  of the  first  two  elements  of  the  Olmstead  test  is  dis- \nputed  in  our  case.  By  previously  allowing  the  plaintiffs  signif- \nicantly  more  community  interaction,  the  state’s  medical  pro- \nfessionals  have  demonstrated  that  such  activity  is both  appro- \npriate  and  possible.  The  plaintiffs’  purpose  in  this  lawsuit  is \nto  have  this  level  of community-based  service  restored,  under \nwhatever  program  umbrella  will  accomplish  that  end.  The \nplaintiffs’ evidence  shows  that  at  present,  using  the  PS  waiver, \nthey  can  arrange  for  no  more  than  10  to  12  hours  of  such  ser- \nvices  per  week,  The  affidavits  maintain  that  this  amount  is  in- \nsufficient  either  (1)  to  allow  any  significant  community  inter- \naction  or  (2)  to  prevent  gaps  in  supervision  that  remained  un- \ncovered  by  their  caretakers  or  prior-authorization  services. \nThe  state  has  offered  nothing  to  support  its  assumption  that \nthe  plaintiffs  actually spend  more  time  in  the  community  than \ntheir  guardians  have  averred.  Plaintiffs  have  also  provided \nevidence  that  a  more  integrated  setting  is  possible:  their  affi- \ndavits  state  that  they  were  able  both  to  achieve  significantly\n  \nNos.  15-2377  &  15-2389  23 \nmore  community  interaction  and  prevent  gaps  in  supervision \nunder  the  A&D  waiver. \nIt  is  the  state’s  burden  to  prove  that  the  proposed  changes \nwould  fundamentally  alter  their  programs.  See  Radaszewski, \n383  F.3d  at  611  (citing  28  CER,  §  35,130(b)(7)).  It  has  failed  to \ncarry  that  burden  here.  In  fact,  it  did  not  even  argue  that  the \nplaintiffs  seek  fundamental  alteration  of  their  programs.  In- \nstead,  it  contended  that  “itis  not  ‘reasonable’  to  demand  that \nthe  State  alter  the  eligibility  requirements  tor  the  A&D  Waiver \nso  as  to  permanently  enshrine  its  error”  in  placing  the  plain- \ntiffs  on  the  waiver  in  the  first  place. \nThere  are  several  problems  with  this  argument.  The  first \nis  that  the  plaintiffs  are  not  asking  to  be  put  back  on  the  A&D \nwaiver.  While  that  may  be  one  of  the  outcomes  they  will  ac- \ncept,  it  is  rot  the  only  one.  The  second  is  that  the  state’s  logic \nis  circular.  After  all,  the  state  creates  the  waiver  programs,  and \ntherefore  those  programs’  eligibility  criteria.  If  the  state’s  own \ncriteria  could  prevent the  enforcement of the  integration  man- \ndate,  the  mandate  would  be  meaningless.  The  regulation  ad- \njacent  to  the  “reasonable  modifications”  provision  antici- \npates—and  directly  contronts—this  problem.  See  26  CER. \n§  35.130(b)(8)  (A  public  entity  shall  not  impose  or  apply  eli- \ngibility  criteria  that  screen  out  or  tend  to  screen  out  an  indi- \nvidual  with  a  disability  or  any  class  of  individuals  with  disa- \nbilities  from  fully  and  equally  enjoying  any  service,  program, \nor  activity,  unless  such  criteria  cari  be  shown  to  be  necessary \nfor  the  provision  of  the  service,  program,  or  activity  being  of- \nfered.”).  The  state  has  made  no  showing  that  its  criteria  are \n“necessary  for  the  provision”  of  the  relevant  services  in  this \ncase.  It  cannot  avoid  the  integration  mandate  by  binding  its \nhands  in  its  own  red  tape.\n  \n24  Nos,  15-2377  &  15-2389 \nThe  third  reason  the  state’s  argument  cannot  prevail  is  the \nmost  important:  the  evidence  presented  on  summary  judg- \nment  shows  that  the  plaintiffs’  demands  are  entirely  reasona- \nble;  the  state  has  provided  no  evidence  to  the  contrary.  The \nplaintiffs  do  not  demand  a  significant  increase  in  total  ser- \nvices,  but  rather  a  different  apportionment  of  the  two  kinds  of \nservices  they  already  receive.  Pricr-authorization  services  do \nnot  allow  the  plaintiffs  to  be  taken  into  the  community. \nWaiver  services  do.  Allowing  the  plaintiffs  to  change  their \n“mix”  of prior-authorization  and  waiver services  would  allow \nthem  to  participate  more  fully  in  the  community.  According \nto  their  affidavits,  a  relatively  slight  increase  in  total  services \nwould  prevent  them  from  being  unsupervised.  The  state  has \nprovided  no  evidence  that  the  plaintiffs’  desired  distribution \nof  services  would  significantly  increase  their  cost,  let  alone \nfundamentally  alter  any  programs. \nFinally,  the  state  argues  that  if  should  be  excused  from \nchanging  its  waiver  system  because  it  has  a  “comprehensive, \neffectively  working  plan  for  placing  qualified  persons  with \nmental  disabilities  in  less  restrictive  settings,”  and  therefore \nmeets  the  reasonable-modification  standard.  Olnistead,  527 \nU.S.  at  605,  The  state  is  referring  to  the  process  if  is  using  to \nmove  persons  with  disabilities  from  the A&D  waiver  to  the  Fs \nwaiver.  That  is  just  what  plaintiffs  are  attacking:  their  evi- \ndence  shows  that  this  “plan”  is  undermining,  not  furthering, \nthe  integration  mandate.  Instead  of moving  people  with  disa- \nbilities  to  more  integrated  settings,  the  state’s  plan  is  making \ntheir  living  arrangements  less  integrated. \n3 \nThe  plaintiffs  have  provided  evidence  that  before  the  pol- \nicy  change,  they  were  receiving  the  kind  of  services  they\n  \nNos.  15-2377  &  15-2389  25 \nneeded  to  prevent  isolation  or  institutionalization  and  partic- \nipate  in  the  community  around  them.  They  also  have  pro- \nvided  evidence  that  the  FS  waiver  services  that  they  currently \nreceive  are  insufficient  to  allow  more  than  limited  trips  into \nthe  community.  They  describe  current  or  future  gaps  in  ser- \nvices  that  plausibly  put  them  at  risk  of  institutionalization. \nIt  also  appears,  however,  that  recipients  of  FS  waiver  ser- \nvices  may  choose  how  to  spend  their  allowance.  The  state  ar- \ngues  that  the  PS  waiver  actually  provides  the  plaintiffs  suffi- \ncient waiver  services  to  participate  in  the  community,  but  that \nthese  plaintiffs  have  used  the  FS  resources  in  a  way  that  has \nled  to  their  current  isolation.  In  support  of this  contention,  the \nstate  has  offered  evidence  that  the  plaintiffs  could  make  dif- \nferent  choices  that  would  allow  them  more  services  in  the \ncommunity,  It  also  offered  evidence  that  the  Coles  are  using  a \nlower  dollar  amount  of  services  than  they  did  under  the A&D \nwaiver,  and  that Maertz’s  situation has  been  influenced  by  the \nfact  that  his  sister  is  the  paid  provider  of  his  waiver  services. \nThere  is  therefore  a  dispute  of  material  fact  as  to  whether  the \nstate’s  2011  policy  change  caused  the  plaintiffs’  isolation,  and \nsummary  judgement  is  inappropriate  on  that  question.  See \nPED.  R.  Civ.  P.  56(a). \nHi \nThe  party  seeking  class  certification  bears  the  burden  of \nshowing,  by  a preponderance  of  the  evidence,  that a  proposed \ndure  23.  Messner  v.  Northshore  Univ,  HealthSystem,  669  Fad \n802,  811  (7th  Cir.  2012).  The  district  court’s  decision  whether \nto  certify  a  class  is  reviewed  tor  abuse  of  discretion.  Mullins  v, \nDirect  Digital,  LLC,  795  F.3d  654,  659  (7th  Cir,  2015).  The  plain- \ntiffs  proposed  the  following  class:\n  \n26  Nos,  15-2377  &  15-2389 \nAny  and  all  persons,  current  and  future,  termi- \nnated  from  the  [A&D  waiver]  as  a  result  of  the \n2011  Policy  Change  who  require  more  services \neach  year  than  are  available  through  the  [FS \nwaiver]  and  who  are  not  enrolled  in  the  [CTH \nwaiver}. \nThe  district  court  found  that  the  plaintiffs  failed  all  of  Rule \n23's  criteria.  We  have  serious  reservations  about  this  decision, \nwhich  strikes  us  as  too  sweeping.  Nonetheless,  we  may  affirm \non  any  basis  that  fairly  appears  in  the  record.  Ellis  v.  CCA  of \nTennessee  LLC,  650  E.SGd  640,  647  (7th  Cir.  2011).  Because  the \nclass  definition  was  too  vague,  we  find  that  the  district  court \ndid  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  denying  class  certification. \nThe  vagueness  of  this  definition  arises  from  the  word  “re- \nquire.”  The  question  is  in  what  ways  do  the  potential  class \nmembers  “require”  more  services  than  available  under  the  FS \nwaiver?  Are  they  medically  required?  Required  for  regular \ncommunity  interaction?  Required  so  as  not  to  violate  the  in- \ntegration  mandate?  (The  last  of  these  definitions  would  risk \nmaking  this  class  an  impermissible  “fail-safe”  class.  See  Mul- \nlins,  795  P.3d  at  660.)  The  class  definition  does  not  say. \nAvoiding  vagueness  is  important  “because  a  court  needs \nto  be  able  to  identify  who  will  receive  notice,  who  will  share \nin  any  recovery,  and  who  will be  bound  by  a judgment.”  Mul- \nlins,  795  F.3d  at  660.  “To  avoid  vagueness,  class  definitions \ngenerally  need  to  identify  a  particular  group,  harmed  during \na  particular  time  frame,  ina  particular  location,  in  a  particular \nway.”  Id,  The  proposed  definition  here  sufficiently  identifies \nthe  time,  location,  and  manner  of harm,  but we  cannot  say  the \nsame  for  the  “particular  group.”  [d.  Without  knowing  how  to\n  \nNos.  15-2377  &  15-2389  2s \nsort  between  those  who  were  and  those  who  were  not  de- \nprived  of  services  to  which  they  were  entitled,  we  would  not \nbe  able  to  say  who  should  receive  notice,  be  bound  by  the \njudgement,  and,  if the  class  were  to  prevail  on  the  merits,  share \nin  any  recovery.  The  district  court  therefore  did  not  abuse  its \ndiscretion  in  denying  class  certification. \nIV \nOur  decision  today  does  not  require  the  state  of Indiana  to \nadopt  any  particular  solution  to  make  its  waiver  program \ncompliant  with  the  integration  mandate.  If  plaintiffs  prevail \non  the  merits,  the  district  court,  in  conjunction  with  the  par- \nties,  may  exercise  its  equitable  powers  to  craft  an  appropriate \ninjunction.  But  the  state  cannot  avoid  the  integration  mandate \nby  painting  itself  into  a  corner  and  then  lamenting  the  view. \nThe  state  designs,  applies  for,  develops  policies  regarding, \nand  executes  its  waiver  programs.  If  those  programs  in  prac- \ntice  allow  persons  with  disabilities  to  leave  their  homes  only \n12  hours  each  week,  cooping  them  up  the  rest  of  the  time,  or \nrender  them  at  serious  risk  of  institutionalization,  then  those \nprograms  violate  the  integration  mandate  unless  the  state  can \nshow  that  changing  them  would  require  a  fundamental  alter- \nation  of  its  programs  for  the  disabled. \nBecause  the  plaintiffs’  claims  both  fit  within  and,  if  caused \nby  the  state’s  policy,  represent  violations  of  the  integration \nREMAND  for  further  proceedings  consistent  with  this  opinion. \nWe  AFFIRM  the  district  court’s  decision  not  to  certify  the  pro- \nposed  class.  Costs  will  be  taxed  against  the  state.\n  \n\n############# Old Text on 20240821 ###############\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 183   Filed 06/01/16   Page 1 of 31 PageID #: 5617\nCase: 15-2377      Document: 00712769786            Filed: 06/01/2016      Pages: 2 (1 of 31)\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\nEverett McKinley Dirksen United States Courthouse Office of the Clerk\n Room 2722 - 219 S.

On the one \nhand, she has spent twelve (12) or fifteen (15) years on a wait-list to receive services through the \nState’s  Community  Integration  and  Habilitation  Waiver  Program  (“CIH  Waiver”)  (formerly \nknown as the Developmental Disabilities Waiver Program), only to be notified—along with \nthousands of other persons—that the wait-list for that program was being eliminated in late 2012 \nor early 2013 unless she could demonstrate that she met certain restrictive “priority” criteria.  \nThis elimination of the wait-list occurred without affording Ms. Steimel or other persons an \nopportunity to appeal the State’s decision.  On the other hand, while on the wait-list for the CIH \nWaiver (and since that time), Ms. Steimel has been receiving services through the State’s Aged \nand Disabled Waiver Program (“A&D Waiver”).  However, the State has recently imposed a \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 4   Filed 06/14/13   Page 2 of 11 PageID #: 81\nrequirement  on  developmentally  disabled  individuals  receiving  services  through  that  waiver \nwhereby they may only continue to receive those services if they required “skilled medical \nneeds”  or  skilled  nursing  services—such  as  suctioning,  ventilation,  or  medication \nadministration—that  many  such  persons  do  not  require.    In  other  words,  Ms.  Steimel  is \nchallenging  generally  applicable  State  policies  that  have  been  applied  to  hundreds,  if  not \nthousands, of similarly situated persons.  As such, this case is clearly suitable for class treatment, \nand three (3) classes should be certified pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \nCLASS DEFINITIONS \nPutative Class A, which challenges the elimination of the wait-list for the CIH Waiver \nand the implementation of the restrictive “priority criteria,” is defined as follows: \nAny and all persons on the waiting list for Indiana’s Community Integration and \nHabilitation  Medicaid  Waiver  Program  (including  its  predecessor,  the \nDevelopmental Disabilities Medicaid Waiver Program) as of August 31, 2012, or \nwho will be or would otherwise be on the wait-list for that program but for the \nelimination of that wait-list, and who do not meet Indiana’s priority criteria for \nplacement  on  that  program  (described  in  paragraph  33  of  the  plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint). \n \nPutative Class B, which challenges the State’s failure to afford persons an appeals process upon \nthe elimination of their positions on the wait-list for the CIH Waiver, is defined as follows: \nAny and all persons on the waiting list for Indiana’s Community Integration and \nHabilitation  Medicaid  Waiver  Program  (including  its  predecessor,  the \nDevelopmental Disabilities Medicaid Waiver Program) as of August 31, 2012. \n \nAnd putative Class C, which challenges the requirement that otherwise eligible persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities also demonstrate the need for “skilled medical services” or “skilled \nnursing services” in order to receive services through the A&D Waiver, is defined as follows: \nAny and all persons enrolled in, or who will be enrolled in, Indiana’s Aged and \nDisabled Medicaid Waiver Program and/or its Traumatic Brain Injury Medicaid \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 4   Filed 06/14/13   Page 3 of 11 PageID #: 82\nWaiver Program who (a) are developmentally disabled and/or under age eleven \n(11), (b) do not routinely require skilled nursing services for their conditions, (c) \nmeet nursing facility level of care as determined through the use of Indiana’s \nEligibility Screen (State Form 45528), and (d) are also determined to be eligible \nfor services through the Family Supports Medicaid Waiver Program. \n \nA copy of the notification concerning the elimination of the wait-list for the CIH Waiver, which \nwas received by the members of Class A and Class B (other than the future members of Class \nA), is attached to the plaintiffs’ complaint as Exhibit 1; the copy of this notification that was \nspecifically received by Ms. Steimel is attached to the plaintiffs’ complaint as Exhibit 6; and \nnotes from a “Webinar” prepared by the State explaining the changes in these policies is attached \nto the plaintiffs’ complaint as Exhibit 2.  Similar, copies of the policies addressing the change in \npolicies for eligibility for the A&D Waiver are attached to the plaintiffs’ complaint as Exhibits 3 \nand 4. \nARGUMENT \nThe requirements for certification of a class under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nare clear.  In order for an individual or individuals to sue on behalf of a class, four requirements \nmust be met:  \n(1) The class must be so numerous that the joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2) There must be questions of law or fact common to the class; \n(3) The claims or defenses of the representative parties must be typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class; and \n(4) The representative parties must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \n \nFED.  R.  CIV.  P.  23(a).    In  addition,  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  require  that  the \ndefendants, at all times, have acted or refused to act in a manner generally applicable to the class.  \nFED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2).  As indicated below, all of the requirements of Rule 23 are met in this \ncase and the class should be certified. \nI.  EACH OF THE CLASSES IS SO NUMEROUS THAT THE JOINDER OF ALL \nMEMBERS IS IMPRACTICABLE \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 4   Filed 06/14/13   Page 4 of 11 PageID #: 83\n  The first requirement for certification of a class is that the class must be so numerous that \njoinder of all members is impracticable.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(1).  This does not impose an \nabsolute numerical requirement for class certification.  Rather, courts must consider each case on \nits facts to determine the practicability of joining all class members.  See Swanson v. Am. \nConsumer Indus., Inc., 415 F.2d 1326 (7th Cir. 1969).  However, it has been held that “generally, \na class of at least forty members will satisfy the requirement.”  McGarry v. Betcher, No. 4:08-cv-\n0146, 2010 WL 1257446, at *3 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 24, 2010) (Young, J.) (citing cases); see also, \ne.g., EEOC v. Printing Indus. of Metro. D.C., Inc., 92 F.R.D. 51, 53 (D.D.C. 1981) (“[A]s few as \n25-30 class members should raise a presumption that joinder would be impracticable and that the \nclass should be certified.”) (citing Newburg, Class Actions § 1105(b), at 174 (1977)). \n  While the precise size of each class in this case is not presently known (but will be \nascertained through discovery), each class easily satisfies this threshold.  The fact that Ms. \nSteimel was on the waiting list for the CIH Waiver for twelve (12) or fifteen (15) years is strong \nevidence that Class A and Class B number in the thousands of persons.  Indeed, documentation \navailable through the State’s website indicates that “5,938 individuals on the DD waiver waiting \nlist  have  a  diagnosis  on  the  autism  spectrum,”  see  Indiana  Family  and  Social  Services \nAdministration, Indiana Medicaid Waiver: the Community Integration and Habilitation Waiver, \navailable  at  http://www.in.gov/fssa/files/CIH_WAIVER_PRESENTATION.pdf  (last  visited \nJune 14, 2013), which is likely only a small portion of each of these classes.1  Similarly, Class C \npertains to a waiver program (the A&D Waiver) that enrolls nearly fourteen thousand (14,000) \npersons.  On information and belief, a substantial number of these persons are developmentally \ndisabled and subject to the challenged policy (and therefore within the class definition). \n                                                 \n1   The cited document is undated.  However, it references the CIH Waiver, which did not \nbear that name until September 1, 2012.  It therefore appears likely that this document is recent. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 4   Filed 06/14/13   Page 5 of 11 PageID #: 84\n  Moreover, even were the classes not so sizeable, there are factors other than the number \nof class members to be considered on the issue of practicability of joinder:  “Among the factors \nto be considered along with the number of class members are geographic diversity, judicial \neconomy,  and  the  ability  of  the  individual  class  members  to  institute  individual  lawsuits.”  \nTenants Associated for a Better Spaulding v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. and Urban Dev., 97 F.R.D. \n726, 729 (N.D. Ill. 1983) (internal citations omitted); see also, e.g., Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d \n931, 936 (2d Cir.1993) (Other “[r]elevant considerations include judicial economy arising from \nthe avoidance of a multiplicity of actions, geographic dispersion of class members, financial \nresources of class members, the ability of claimants to institute individual suits, and requests for \nprospective injunctive relief which would involve future class members.”).  Thus, even “[a] \nrelatively small group may form a class if other considerations make joinder impracticable.”  \nGaspar v. Linvatec Corp., 167 F.R.D. 51, 56 (N.D. Ill. 1996) (quoting Patrykus v. Gomilla, 121 \nF.R.D. 357, 361 (N.D. Ill. 1988)).   \nOf course, not only is each class in this case state-wide, but it also consists exclusively of \nseriously disabled persons who (a) have limited means so as to qualify for Medicaid assistance \nand (b) require significant services to avoid being institutionalized.  Clearly these are precisely \nthe individuals for whom joinder is most impracticable.  In one case, for instance, the court \nfound that putative class-members “may have no other means to exercise their rights because of \ninadequate resources to prosecute their own claims” when the class was comprised of mentally \ndisabled individuals.  Cortigiano v. Oceanview Manor Home for Adults, 227 F.R.D. 194, 204–05 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2005).  In Matyasovszky v. Housing Authority, 226 F.R.D. 35 (D. Conn. 2005), the \ncourt similarly relied on the fact that the putative class consisted of “low income, disabled, and in \nsome cases homeless individuals” in order to conclude that joinder was altogether impracticable.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 4   Filed 06/14/13   Page 6 of 11 PageID #: 85\nId. at 40–41.  And in Fields v. Maram, No. 04-C-0174, 2004 WL 1879997 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 17, \n2004), the court usefully  surveyed  a sampling  of similar cases in which the disabilities of \nputative class members factored into the numerosity calculus.  Said the court: \nBecause the class members reside throughout the state, and because they are \ndisabled and therefore are often of limited financial resources, joinder would be \nparticularly difficult in this case.  See, e.g., Arenson [v. Whitehall Convalescent & \nNursing Home, Inc.], 164 F.R.D. [659,] 663 [(N.D. Ill. 1996)] (“Class members \nwho are residents of a nursing home may also lack the ability to pursue their \nclaims individually.”); Raymond v. Rowland, 220 F.R.D. 173, 179 (D. Conn. \n2004) (finding, as to class of disabled recipients of state aid, that “[t]hese factors \nall speak in favor of certification: the Plaintiffs are dispersed throughout the state; \nthey are by definition people of limited financial resources, they mostly lack the \nlegal sophistication and financial wherewithal to bring individual suits”). \n \nMaram, 2004 WL 1879997, at *4.  See also, e.g., A.M.T. v. Gargano, No. 1:10-cv-0358, 2010 \nWL 4860119, at *4 (S.D. Ind. Nov. 22, 2010) (Magnus-Stinson, J.) (“The medical and economic \nvulnerability of the putative class members makes joinder even more impracticable and further \nsupports the Court’s finding that numerosity exists.”) (citation omitted). \n  Additionally, the court may also consider the numbers in the future class and draw an \ninference that joinder is impracticable.  See Lewis v. Gross, 663 F.Supp. 1164, 1169 (E.D.N.Y. \n1986).  In this case, both Class A and Class C contain future class-members, and will continue to \ngrow in size.  Although the exact number of members of each class is currently unknown, it is \nlikely that each class consists of thousands, if not tens of thousands, of individuals, and the \nprecise number will be ascertained through the discovery process.  The defendants’ practices or \npolicies presently at issue affect, and will continue to adversely affect, all of these individuals.  \nAnd two (2) of the classes will continue to accumulate members.   Numerosity is present. \nII.  THERE ARE QUESTIONS OF LAW OR FACT COMMON TO EACH OF THE \nCLASSES \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 4   Filed 06/14/13   Page 7 of 11 PageID #: 86\n  Rule 23(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that there be questions of \nlaw or fact common to the class in order for a class action to be certified.  Several courts have \nheld that the existence of a common scheme applied to all members of a class fulfills the \nrequirement of this rule.  See, e.g., Fujishima v. Bd. of Educ., 460 F.2d 1355 (7th Cir. 1972); Like \nv. Carter, 448 F.2d 798 (8th Cir. 1971); Jones v. Blinzinger, 536 F.Supp. 1181, 1189 (N.D. Ind. \n1982).  In Like v. Carter, for instance, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a state \npolicy affecting all welfare recipients presented common questions of law, even though each \nmember of the class presented minor deviations in fact.  See Carter, 448 F.2d at 798.  The \nSeventh Circuit applied a similar rule in Fujishima. \n  In this case, all class members are subject to the defendants’ various practices presently at \nissue.  The same questions exist for all class members:  \n-  as to Class A, whether the challenged elimination of the wait-list for the waiver and \ncorresponding priority criteria for obtaining waiver services violate the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act of 1990 and/or the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. \n   \n-  as  to  Class  B,  whether  the  failure  to  provide  for  an  appeals  process  upon  the \ntermination of the wait-list for the waiver violates 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). \n \n-  as to Class C, whether the elimination of persons’ eligibility for the waiver program \nviolates the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and/or the Rehabilitation Act of \n1973.  \n \nThere are, therefore, questions of law or fact common to the class.  Commonality, after all, only \nrequires  that  defendants  “have  engaged  in  standardized  conduct  towards  members  of  the \nproposed class.”  Keele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir. 1998).  The State may not \nseriously contend that this requirement is not met. \nIII.  THE CLAIMS OF THE NAMED PLAINTIFF ARE TYPICAL OF THE CLAIMS \nOF EACH OF THE CLASSES \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 4   Filed 06/14/13   Page 8 of 11 PageID #: 87\n  Rule 23(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that the claims of the \nrepresentative parties be typical of those of the class.  As the U.S. Supreme Court has noted, this \nrequirement is intertwined with the commonality requirement:   \n[t]he commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.  Both \nserve as guideposts for determining whether under the particular circumstances \nmaintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named plaintiff’s \nclaim and the class claims are so inter-related that the interests of the class-\nmembers will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence. \n \nGen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n.13 (1982).  In order for this requirement to \nbe met, there need not be identity of interest between the named plaintiff and the classes that she \nseeks to represent; rather, there need only be “sufficient homogeneity of interests.”  Sosna v. \nIowa, 419 U.S. 393, 403 n.13 (1975).  Another view is that the typicality requirement is satisfied \nif the representative parties have no interests antagonistic to those of the class.  See Mersay v. \nFirst Republic Corp. of Am., 43 F.R.D. 465 (S.D.N.Y. 1965).  The fundamental inquiry is \nwhether all members of the class would benefit in some way from a judgment favorable to the \nplaintiff.  See Ellis v. Naval Air Rework Facility, 404 F.Supp. 391, 396 (N.D. Calif. 1975), rev’d \non other grounds, 608 F.2d 1308 (9th Cir. 1979). \n  Each of the putative classes meets these standards.  Ms. Steimel seeks to enjoin multiple \npolicies of the State that have been generally applied to all members of the classes and that are \nalleged to violate the federal rights of Ms. Steimel and the putative classes.  All members of the \nclass would benefit in some way from a judgment favorable to the plaintiffs in that all class \nmembers  would  be  receive  protection  from  these  policies,  and  will  be  permitted  access  to \nnecessary services in the least restrictive setting appropriate to their needs (or, in the case of \nClass B, access to an appeal mechanism to challenge the State’s actions).  The named plaintiff is, \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 4   Filed 06/14/13   Page 9 of 11 PageID #: 88\ntherefore, typical of the classes she seeks to represent.  See, e.g., Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d \n1013, 1018 (7th Cir. 1992); Koos v. First Nat’l Bank of Peoria, 496 F.2d 1162 (7th Cir. 1974). \nIV.  THE  NAMED  PLAINTIFF  AND  CLASS  COUNSEL  WILL  FAIRLY  AND \nADEQUATELY PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF EACH OF THE CLASSES  \n \n  Rule  23(a)(4)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  requires  that  the  class \nrepresentative’s interests be such that she can and will vigorously pursue the classes’ interests as \nwell as her own.  See, e.g., Hohman v. Packard Instrument Co., 399 F.2d 711 (7th Cir. 1968).  \nMs.  Steimel  is  represented  by  counsel  skilled  and  experienced  in  this  type  of  litigation.  \nMoreover, the relief that she seeks “is not inconsistent in any way with the interests of the \nmembers of the class.”  Jones, 536 F.Supp. at 1190.  Likewise, Ms. Steimel has a stake in these \nproceedings that will “insure diligent and thorough prosecution of the litigation.”  Rodriquez v. \nSwank, 318 F.Supp. 289, 294 (N.D. Ill. 1970), aff’d, 496 F.2d 1110 (7th Cir. 1974).  The plaintiff \nis an adequate class representative and her counsel is adequate class counsel.2 \nV.  THE FURTHER REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 23(b)(2) ARE MET IN THIS CASE \nWITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THE CLASSES \n \n  The final rule for class certification is stated in Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure.  In order to meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2), the party who opposes the \nclass must have “acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby \nmaking appropriate final injunctive or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class \nas a whole.”  This is not a difficult standard to meet in a case such as this one, where the \nplaintiffs challenge governmental policies of general applicability.  After all, “Rule 23(b)(2) was \ndrafted specifically to facilitate relief in civil rights suits.  Most class actions in the constitutional \nand civil rights areas seek primarily declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the class and \n                                                 \n2   Undersigned counsel should therefore be appointed class counsel pursuant to Rule 23(g) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 4   Filed 06/14/13   Page 10 of 11 PageID #: 89\ntherefore readily satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) class action criteria.”  Tyson v. Grant County Sheriff, No. \n1:07-cv-0010,  2007  WL  1395563,  *5  (N.D.  Ind.  May  9,  2007)  (quoting  A.  CONTE  &  H. \nNEWBERG, 8 NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS, § 25.20 (4th ed. 2002)).  Consequently, “[t]he \nrequirements of the rule are . . . given a liberal construction in civil rights suits.”  John Does 1-\n100 v. Boyd, 613 F.Supp. 1514, 1528 (D. Minn. 1985) (citing Coley v. Clinton, 635 F.2d 1364, \n1379 (8th Cir. 1980)).  In this case, the allegedly illegal actions of the State and its violations of \nfederal law have detrimentally affected and will continue to detrimentally affect the named \nplaintiff as well as the members of the putative classes.  The plaintiff seeks to enjoin these \nunlawful actions.  The State has therefore acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable \nto each class, and the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are therefore met. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, this case should be certified as a class action pursuant to Rule \n23(a) and (b)(2) with three (3) classes defined as indicated. \n \n \n \n_/s/ Gavin M.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA \nINDIANAPOLIS DIVISION \nTHOMAS MAERTZ, COLTON COLE, AND CODY  ) \nCOLE,   ) \nPlaintiffs-Intervenors,   ) \n )  No. 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD \nvs.   ) \n ) \nDEBRA MINOTT, IN HER OFFICIAL CAPACITY  ) \nAS SECRETARY OF THE INDIANA FAMILY AND  ) \nSOCIAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, ET AL.,   ) \nDefendants.   ) \nORDER \nFor a number of years, the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (“FSSA”) \nhad a policy in place that allowed developmentally disabled individuals to receive Medicaid waiver \nservices through a waiver program applicable to individuals who needed nursing-facility level of \ncare.  To remedy this problem for individuals who did not meet the nursing facility level of care \nrequirement, the FSSA changed its policy and began transitioning the inappropriately placed indi-\nviduals to another waiver program for which they were eligible (the “Policy Change”).  Plaintiffs \nare developmentally disabled individuals who, as a result of the Policy Change, were transitioned \nto a different waiver program.  According to Plaintiffs, this transition caused a reduction in the \nwaiver services they receive in their homes, which in turn reduced the number of hours per week \nthat they could leave their homes to engage in activities in the community.  \nThis suit challenges the Policy Change.  The parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment \nare currently pending before the Court, and the United States has filed a brief as an interested party \nthat supports Plaintiffs’ claim.  Plaintiffs contend that the Policy Change violated the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act’s (“ADA”) and Rehabilitation Act’s so-called integration mandates, which \nrequire “[a] public entity [to] administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated \n- 1 - \n\nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); \nsee 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d).   \nFor the reasons explained below, the Court cannot conclude that Plaintiffs’ integration-\nmandate claims are ripe for review.  The reason for this is simple: the integration mandate focuses \non the setting in which services are administered, not the amount of services received.  Plaintiffs \ndo not contend that the setting in which they receive services has changed as a result of the Policy \nChange, nor could they, as Plaintiffs, both before and after the Policy Change, received Medicaid \nwaiver services at their homes.  Instead, Plaintiffs argue that the Policy Change caused a decrease \nin their ability to engage in activities in the community, which they maintain violates the integra-\ntion mandate.   \nThe Seventh Circuit has made clear that, absent institutionalization (or perhaps some other \ninvoluntary change to a less integrated setting), an integration-mandate claim is not ripe for adju-\ndication.  This precedent, of course, binds this Court.  Because the Policy Change has not caused \nPlaintiffs to be either institutionalized or moved to a different setting in which they receive Medi-\ncaid waiver services, their integration-mandate claims are unripe and summary judgment in De-\nfendants’ favor is warranted. \nThe Court notes that Plaintiffs claim a significant hardship caused by the Policy Change1  \nin Plaintiffs’ lives and the lives of their family members who care for them.  Whenever government \nservices that were previously provided no longer are, the toll it takes on those who rely on such \nservices is often dramatic.  But the Court is bound by clear Seventh Circuit precedent in this case.  \nAlthough other circuits have applied standards to integration-mandate claims that are perhaps more \n                                                 \n1 While Plaintiffs attribute the Policy Change to their current changed conditions, the evidence \nalso shows the decisions by Plaintiffs and/or their caregivers have also contributed to their current \ncircumstances.  \n- 2 - \n \n\nfavorable to Plaintiffs, it is for the Seventh Circuit, not this Court, to revisit or clarify its position \non the issue should it choose to do so.  See Resier v. Residential Funding Corp., 380 F.3d 1027, \n1029 (7th Cir. 2004) (stating that in our “hierarchical system, decisions of a superior court are \nauthoritative on inferior courts”).  But the appellate court’s current position is clear.  Accordingly, \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED, [Filing No. 143], Plaintiffs’ Cross \nMotion for Summary Judgment is DENIED, [Filing No. 145], and Plaintiffs’ integration-mandate \nclaims are dismissed without prejudice because they are unripe.2 \nI. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n \nA motion for summary judgment asks the Court to find that a trial is unnecessary because \nthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and, instead, the movant is entitled to judgment \nas a matter of law.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  As the current version of Rule 56 makes clear, \nwhether a party asserts that a fact is undisputed or genuinely disputed, the party must support the \nasserted fact by citing to particular parts of the record, including depositions, documents, or affi-\ndavits.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A).  A party can also support a fact by showing that the materials \ncited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute or that the adverse party cannot \nproduce admissible evidence to support the fact.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B).  Affidavits or decla-\nrations must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, \nand show that the affiant is competent to testify on matters stated.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4).  Failure \n                                                 \n2 On this date the Court issues an order in a related case, Beckem v. Indiana Family and Social \nServs. Admin., Case No. 1:14-cv-668-JMS-MJD, that is substantially identical to this Order.  The \nCourt held a joint hearing on the pending cross-motions for summary judgment in these two cases \nduring which both parties, and the United States as an Interested Party, presented argument.  In \nboth cases, the plaintiffs raise essentially the same claims against the same defendants, and the \nparties stipulated that the discovery in Case No. 1:13-cv-957-JMS-MJD may be treated as if it \nwere produced in Case No. 1:14-cv-668-JMS-MJD. \n- 3 - \n \n\nto properly support a fact in opposition to a movant’s factual assertion can result in the movant’s \nfact being considered undisputed, and potentially in the grant of summary judgment.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 56(e).    \nIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court need only consider disputed facts \nthat are material to the decision.  A disputed fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the \nsuit under the governing law.  Hampton v. Ford Motor Co., 561 F.3d 709, 713 (7th Cir. 2009).  In \nother words, while there may be facts that are in dispute, summary judgment is appropriate if those \nfacts are not outcome determinative.  Harper v. Vigilant Ins. Co., 433 F.3d 521, 525 (7th Cir. \n2005).  Fact disputes that are irrelevant to the legal question will not be considered.  Anderson v. \nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed. 202 (1986). \nOn summary judgment, a party must show the Court what evidence it has that would con-\nvince a trier of fact to accept its version of the events.  Johnson v. Cambridge Indus., 325 F.3d \n892, 901 (7th Cir. 2003).  The moving party is entitled to summary judgment if no reasonable fact-\nfinder could return a verdict for the non-moving party.  Nelson v. Miller, 570 F.3d 868, 875 (7th \nCir. 2009).  The Court views the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and \ndraws all reasonable inferences in that party’s favor.  Darst v. Interstate Brands Corp., 512 F.3d \n903, 907 (7th Cir. 2008).  It cannot weigh evidence or make credibility determinations on summary \njudgment because those tasks are left to the fact-finder.  O’Leary v. Accretive Health, Inc., 657 \nF.3d 625, 630 (7th Cir. 2011).  The Court need only consider the cited materials, Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56(c)(3), and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has “repeatedly assured the district courts that \nthey are not required to scour every inch of the record for evidence that is potentially relevant to \n- 4 - \n \n\nthe summary judgment motion before them,” Johnson, 325 F.3d at 898.  Any doubt as to the ex-\nistence of a genuine issue for trial is resolved against the moving party.  Ponsetti v. GE Pension \nPlan, 614 F.3d 684, 691 (7th Cir. 2010). \n“The existence of cross-motions for summary judgment does not, however, imply that there \nare no genuine issues of material fact.”  R.J. Corman Derailment Servs., LLC v. Int’l Union of \nOperating Engineers, 335 F.3d 643, 647 (7th Cir. 2003).  Specifically, “[p]arties have different \nburdens of proof with respect to particular facts; different legal theories will have an effect on \nwhich facts are material; and the process of taking the facts in the light most favorable to the non-\nmovant, first for one side and then for the other, may highlight the point that neither side has \nenough to prevail without a trial.”  Id. at 648.  \nII. \nBACKGROUND \n \n  The Court draws the factual background from the undisputed evidence submitted by the \nparties.  The parties dispute several facts, and vigorously dispute what conclusions should be \ndrawn from those facts.  The Court sets forth the disputed facts in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs, since the Court ultimately grants summary judgment in Defendants’ favor.3   \nA.  The Medicaid Waiver Programs and the FSSA’s Policy Change \nThis case involves Medicaid waiver programs funded jointly by the federal government \nand the State of Indiana.  These programs allow states such as Indiana to waive certain federal \nMedicaid requirements.  See generally 42 U.S.C. § 1396n.  A subset of these programs—home-\n                                                 \n3 Portions of the Background section here are taken from the Background section of the Court’s \norder denying class certification in this case.  [See Filing No. 112.]  The parties rely on evidence \nsubmitted in support of class certification, and thus the Court will do so as well. \n- 5 - \n \n\nand-community-based waiver programs—“permit[] a State to furnish an array of home and com-\nmunity-based services that assist Medicaid beneficiaries to live in the community and avoid insti-\ntutionalization.”  [Filing No. 58-5 at 8.]  The FSSA submits waivers for approval to the United \nStates Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”).  [Filing No. 58-2 at 4.]  Relevant to \nthis litigation are three such waiver programs currently administered by the FSSA: the Aged and \nDisabled Waiver (“A&D Waiver”), the Community Integration and Habilitation Medicaid Waiver \n(“CIH Waiver”), and the Family Supports Medicaid Waiver (“FS Waiver”).  [Filing No. 58-2 at \n4; Filing No. 58-4 at 4.]  The FSSA’s Division of Aging administers the A&D Waiver, while the \nFSSA’s Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services (“BDDS”) administers the CIH Waiver \nand the FS Waiver.  [Filing No. 58-2 at 4; Filing No. 58-4 at 4.]  An individual may only be \nenrolled in (and thus receive services from) one waiver program at a time.  [Filing No. 58-2 at 4.] \nAlthough not the focus of this lawsuit, individuals with disabilities also receive—in addi-\ntion to waiver services—what the parties here refer to as prior authorization services.  [Filing No. \n58-1 at 4.]  These are health-related services that are provided wholly apart from the services pro-\nvided through the Medicaid waiver programs, and, unlike the waiver services, cannot be used to \nprovide services to disabled individuals that allow them to enter into the community.  [Filing No. \n58-1 at 4.]  Plaintiffs in this case each received, and continue to receive after the Policy Change, \nprior authorization services. \nIndividuals enrolled in any of the waiver programs receive a case manager.  [Filing No. \n58-2 at 6; Filing No. 58-4 at 6.]  To determine both the type and amounts of services an enrollee \nwill receive through the waiver program, the case manager, the enrollee, and the enrollee’s guard-\nian evaluate the enrollee’s particular circumstances to identify the enrollee’s specific needs.  [Fil-\ning No. 58-2 at 6; Filing No. 58-4 at 6.]  The enrollee then submits her plan to the appropriate \n- 6 - \n \n\nadministrating agency—either the Division of Aging or BDDS—which can either approve or deny \nthe request for services.  [Filing No. 58-2 at 6; Filing No. 58-4 at 6.]  An enrollee must have her \nrequested services approved annually by the appropriate agency.  [Filing No. 58-2 at 6; Filing No. \n58-4 at 6.]   \nA basic understanding of each waiver is necessary to understand the events underlying this \nsuit.  The A&D Waiver “provides an alternative to nursing facility admission for adults and per-\nsons of all ages with a disability,” specifically by providing services “for people who would require \ncare in a nursing facility if waiver or other supports were not available.”  [Filing No. 58-5 at 12.]  \nPlaintiffs do not contend that they are eligible for, or should be placed on, the A&D Waiver.  In-\nstead, the parties agree that the FS Waiver and CIH Waiver—operated by BDDS—are the waiver \nprograms pertaining to individuals with developmental disabilities, such as Plaintiffs. \nBoth the FS Waiver and CIH Waiver provide “waiver services to participants . . . in a range \nof community settings as an alternative to care in an intermediate care facility.”  [Filing No. 58-7 \nat 8; Filing No. 58-8 at 8.]  While the A&D Waiver is limited to those who require a nursing-\nfacility level of care, the FS Waiver and the CIH Waiver serve individuals who require a different \nlevel of care: “intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities” (“ICF/IID”).  \n[Filing No. 58-7 at 7; Filing No. 58-8 at 7.]  Like the A&D Waiver, the FS Waiver and the CIH \nWaiver are reimbursed at set rates, [Filing No. 58-9 at 9-10], albeit not the same rates as services \nunder the A&D Waiver, [Filing No. 58-9 at 2-4], and an enrollee has a services budget approved \nat least on an annual basis, [Filing No. 58-4 at 6-7].  The FS Waiver currently caps enrollee’s \nbudgets at $16,250 per year.  [Filing No. 58-4 at 18.]  The CIH Waiver, however, has a much \nhigher budget cap, [Filing No. 30-1 at 2], given that it is a needs-based waiver and “individuals \nmust meet emergency placement criteria to access [it].”  [Filing No. 58-9 at 77.]   \n- 7 - \n \n\nThe amount of services available under each of the three waivers is impacted by the statu-\ntory requirements that each waiver be cost-neutral compared to the cost of serving these enrollees \nthrough a traditional Medicaid institutional placement.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(D) (requiring \nthat under each “waiver the average per capita expenditure estimated by the State in any fiscal year \nfor medical assistance provided with respect to such individuals does not exceed 100 percent of \nthe average per capita expenditure that the State reasonably estimates would have been made in \nthat fiscal year for expenditures under the State plan for such individuals if the waiver had not been \ngranted”).  Furthermore, the FSSA can consider supports an individual receives from family mem-\nbers or otherwise in determining the amount of services an individual should receive.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396n(i)(1)(G)(ii)(I)(bb) (requiring states to ensure that their individualized care plans \nfor Medicaid recipients “tak[e] into account the extent of, and need for, any family or other sup-\nports for the individual”); see also Filing No. 143-1 at 31 (stating, in the FS Waiver, that “the State \ndetermines whether or not the waiver services, in combination with other sources of coverages \nincluding . . . natural supports and other available community supports and resources, can ade-\nquately meet the needs of the individual and ensure his or her health, safety and welfare”). \nFrom 2006 to 2011, FSSA policy permitted individuals with developmental disabilities to \nbe placed on the A&D Waiver even if they did not meet nursing-facility level of care.  [Filing No. \n58-9 at 27-32 (2006 A&D Waiver Policy Statement).]  This decision contravened the express terms \nof the A&D Waiver approved by DHHS, which limited the A&D Waiver to individuals requiring \nnursing-facility level of care.  [Filing No. 58-5 at 11.]  In October 2011, the Division of Aging \ninstituted the Policy Change that is the subject of this litigation.  [Filing No. 58-9 at 32.]  The \nPolicy Change rescinded the FSSA’s prior policy of allowing individuals with a developmental \ndisability to enroll in the A&D Waiver even if they did not require nursing-facility level of care.  \n- 8 - \n \n\n[Filing No. 58-9 at 32.]  Because some individuals on the A&D Waiver did not meet that level of \ncare, the Division of Aging decided to transition enrollees to another waiver for which they were \neligible.  [Filing No. 58-2 at 12.]  Specifically, the Division of Aging sought to transition those no \nlonger eligible for the A&D Waiver to either of the two waiver programs administered by BDDS: \nthe FS Waiver or the CIH Waiver.  [Filing No. 58-2 at 12.] \nPlaintiffs were each subject to the Policy Change and the requisite transition from the A&D \nWaiver to the FS Waiver or the CIH Waiver.  There are four emergency placement criteria for \nplacement on the CIH Waiver, and only the fourth is arguably applicable to Plaintiffs.  [Filing No. \n143-2 at 47.]  The fourth criteria allows placement on the CIH Waiver if “[t]here are other health \nand safety risks, as determined by the division director, and alternate placement in a supervised \ngroup living setting is not available . . . .”  [Filing No. 143-2 at 47.]  Plaintiffs each applied for the \nCIH Waiver, but the FSSA concluded that none of them was eligible for placement on that waiver.  \n[Filing No. 143-7 at 2-3; Filing No. 145-2 at 7.]  There is no evidence that any of Plaintiffs admin-\nistratively appealed that decision.   \nB.  The Plaintiffs and the Policy Change’s Impact \nThe Policy Change affected each Plaintiff in related but distinct ways.  Plaintiffs Cody and \nColton Cole are twin brothers who have cerebral palsy, which requires them to use power wheel-\nchairs.  [Filing No. 145-2 at 1.]  Colton lives with his mother, Tamara Awald, and Cole lives in a \nhouse next door.  [Filing No. 145-2 at 1.]  Although the record evidence is unclear as to how many \nhours of services the Coles received while on the A&D Waiver, the Coles received “sufficient \nhours both to allow them to remain safe and secure [at home] . . . and to allow their providers to \ntake them out into the community in order to help them become as independent as possible and to \nincrease their opportunities for socialization.”  [Filing No. 145-2 at 2.]  Specifically, the Coles \n- 9 - \n \n\nwould use their A&D Waiver services “for a significant portions of almost every day” to go to the \ngym, grocery store, out to eat, shopping, and medical appointments.  [Filing No. 145-2 at 2.]   \nFollowing the Policy Change, the Coles were transitioned to the FS Waiver and, under it, \nthey together receive approximately twenty-one hours of FS Waiver services per week.  [Filing \nNo. 145-2 at 2.]  However, in monetary terms they receive more waivers services now ($16,530) \nthan they did before the Policy Change ($10,871).  The Coles both continue to receive prior au-\nthorization services.  [Filing No. 145-2 at 4.]  They no longer go into the community during the \nweekdays, but on weekends are “sometimes” able to go into the community.  [Filing No. 145-2 at \n4.]  The Coles’ mother attests that, “[i]f it were not for [her] care, assistance, and supervision, there \nis absolutely no doubt that they both would require institutionalization.”  [Filing No. 145-2 at 7.]   \nPlaintiff Thomas Maertz is intellectually disabled and has cerebral palsy.  [Filing No. 145-\n3 at 1.]  He lives with his sister, Francesca Kemp, who is employed by companies enrolled as \nservice providers in the various waiver programs offered by the State of Indiana.  [Filing No. 145-\n3 at 1-2.]  She was and remains Mr. Maertz’s paid caretaker when he was enrolled in the A&D \nWaiver and, after the Policy Change, when he was transitioned to the FS Waiver.  [Filing No. 145-\n3 at 2.]  Even when not being reimbursed for services, Ms. Kemp assists Mr. Maertz “during vir-\ntually all waking hours.”  [Filing No. 145-3 at 3.]  When he was enrolled in the A&D Waiver, Ms. \nKemp provided Mr. Maertz approximately forty hours of waiver services per week and other cli-\nents twelve hours of services per week.  [Filing No. 143-8 at 6; Filing No. 145-3 at 2.]  During this \ntime, Mr. Maertz would enter the community on a daily basis to do activities such as going out to \neat, visiting the flea market, going to the barber, and going window shopping.  [Filing No. 145-3 \nat 2.]   \n- 10 - \n \n\nFollowing Mr. Maertz’s transition to the FS Waiver, Ms. Kemp now only provides ten to \ntwelve hours of reimbursed services per week to Mr. Maertz.  [Filing No. 143-8 at 6.]  Ms. Kemp’s \ncurrent employer does not allow her to take Mr. Maertz into the community during the time in \nwhich she is reimbursed for services, though there is no evidence that the FS Waiver itself pre-\nscribes such limitation.  [Filing No. 145-3 at 4.]  As a result of these changes, Mr. Maertz is only \nable to go out into the community a few days per week.  [Filing No. 145-3 at 4.] \nMs. Kemp attests that if it were not for her “care and assistance, there is absolutely no \ndoubt that [Mr. Maertz] would require institutionalization.”  [Filing No. 145-3 at 4.]  In Mr. \nMaertz’s view, he would receive adequate services if he was provided “services consistent with \nthe level, amount, and type of those provided through the A&D Waiver.”  [Filing No. 143-8 at 18.]  \nIII. \nDISCUSSION \n \n  The primary dispute between the parties is whether Plaintiffs have a cognizable integration-\nmandate claim, given that they have not been institutionalized nor involuntarily moved to a differ-\nent setting as a result of the FSSA’s Policy Change.  The Court will therefore begin with the general \nlegal standards for an integration-mandate claim, before setting out the parties’ arguments regard-\ning the integration-mandate claims Plaintiffs assert here. \nThe integration mandate, set forth in ADA and Rehabilitation Act regulations, provides:  \n“A public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); see 28 \n- 11 - \n \n\nC.F.R. § 41.51(d).4  This mandate has its statutory roots in the anti-discrimination provision of the \nADA, see Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 587 (1999), which states: “no qualified \nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or \nbe denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  In Olmstead, the Supreme Court assessed \nwhether 42 U.S.C. § 12132 “may require placement of persons with mental disabilities in commu-\nnity settings rather than in institutions,” and answered with “a qualified yes.”  527 U.S. at 587.  It \nheld that “[s]uch action is in order when [1] the State’s treatment professionals have determined \nthat community placement is appropriate, [2] the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive \nsetting is not opposed by the affected individual, [3] and the placement can be reasonably accom-\nmodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with \nmental disabilities.”  Id.; see Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 607 (stating that Olmstead “held that the \n‘unjustified institutional isolation’ of a disabled individual receiving medical care from a State \namounts to an actionable form of discrimination under Title II”) (quoting Olmstead, 527 U.S. at \n597-603).   \nDefendants’ position in its Motion for Summary Judgment is straightforward:  the Court \nneed not assess the Olmstead factors because the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Amundson dictates \nthat Plaintiffs must be subject to institutionalization before their integration-mandate claims are \nripe, and Plaintiffs have not been institutionalized as a result of the Policy Change.  [Filing No. \n                                                 \n4 These regulations found in the ADA and Rehabilitation Act are substantively identical, so the \nCourt will treat them as such.  See Amundson ex rel. Amundson v. Wis. Dep’t of Health Servs., 721 \nF.3d 871, 872 (7th Cir. 2013) (treating the regulations as identical); see also Radaszewski ex rel. \nRadaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599, 607 (7th Cir. 2004) (noting that the “ADA’s integration \nregulation is modeled after [the Rehabilitation Act’s] regulation” and thus “courts construe and \napply them in a consistent manner”). \n- 12 - \n \n\n144 at 9.]  Therefore, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ integration-mandate claims are unripe \nand summary judgment must be granted in their favor. \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that none of them has been institutionalized, “insofar as their fam-\nily-members have expended great efforts (at significant cost to their own physical, financial, and \nemotional well-being) to ensure that the necessary care and supervision formerly provided by the \nState is still provided.”  [Filing No. 146 at 18.]  However, Plaintiffs maintain that the integration \nmandate is not “only implicated upon a demonstration that a person will require actual institution-\nalization”; instead, Plaintiffs argue that it “is also implicated upon a showing that a person has \nbeen ‘institutionalized’ in his own home by the State’s failure to afford sufficient access to the \ncommunity.”  [Filing No. 146 at 19.]  Plaintiffs say further that, as “made abundantly clear by the \nSeventh Circuit’s earlier decision in Bruggeman ex rel. Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324 F.3d 906 \n(7th Cir. 2003), Amundson is not dispositive.”  [Filing No. 146 at 18-19.]  Plaintiffs point the Court \nto various authorities that purportedly support their position, including integration-mandate prec-\nedents from other circuits and the Department of Justice’s (“DOJ”) interpretive guidance on the \nintegration mandate.  [Filing No. 146 at 19.]  \nThe United States,5 as an Interested Party, argues that the decrease in services caused by \nthe Policy Change places Plaintiffs at risk of institutionalization and urges this Court to follow the \nseveral other circuits that have held that a plaintiff need only allege a risk of institutionalization to \nstate a ripe integration-mandate claim.  [Filing No. 155 at 12-17.]  Defendants respond that the \nstandards adopted by the other circuits are contrary to Amundson.  [Filing No. 159 at 5-7.] \n                                                 \n5 At the hearing, the Court asked the United States questions regarding its joint approval, with the \nState of Indiana, of the waiver programs implemented by Defendants and the requirement that they \nremain cost neutral.  The United States’ counsel, from the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights \nDivision, only replied that she was not appearing on behalf of the Center for Medicare and Medi-\ncaid Services, which approves the waiver programs on behalf of the federal government. \n- 13 - \n \n\nIn the end, the Court agrees with Defendants that Amundson is dispositive and that Plain-\ntiffs’ integration-mandate claims are unripe.  To explain this conclusion, the Court will first ad-\ndress Amundson and the other Seventh Circuit precedents on which the parties rely.  Second, the \nCourt will explain why Plaintiffs’ novel integration-mandate theory is contrary to Amundson and \nthe other authorities on which they rely.  Third, the Court will address why it is inappropriate to \napply the integration-mandate standards adopted by other circuit courts of appeals.  Finally, the \nCourt concludes with brief observations regarding Plaintiffs’ evidence of causation. \n  A.  Seventh Circuit Precedent Dictates that Plaintiffs’ Claim is Unripe \nThe Seventh Circuit recently addressed when an integration-mandate claim becomes ripe \nin Amundson.  The plaintiffs in Amundson alleged that Wisconsin reduced the subsidies to its \nprogram that funds disabled persons living in group homes such that group-home providers were \nreimbursed at lower rates than before.  721 F.3d at 872-74.  According to the plaintiffs, this violated \nthe integration mandate because the reduction in subsidies for the group-home providers “in-\ncrease[d] the risk that they will be moved from group homes to institutions.”  Id. at 874.  The \nSeventh Circuit pointed out that the plaintiffs “do not allege that any developmentally disabled \nperson in Wisconsin has been moved, involuntarily, from group to institutional care.  Plaintiffs do \nallege that some of their number have been required to leave group settings where they would have \npreferred to remain, but they do not allege inability to find another group home willing to accept \nthe level of reimbursement that the Wisconsin[’s] . . . Program now offers.”  Id. at 873-74.    \nConfronted with these allegations, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that if the reduction in \nsubsidies did not “land[] any developmentally disabled person in an institution,” then “Wisconsin \nha[d] fulfilled its obligations under federal law, no matter how much plaintiffs prefer the comfort \nand amenities of the more-expensive group homes.”  Id. at 874.  Because none of the plaintiffs \n- 14 - \n \n\nwere moved from their group homes to institutional care, the Seventh Circuit concluded “there \n[was] no legal injury” and the plaintiffs’ claims were unripe; if the plaintiffs later become invol-\nuntarily institutionalized, the Seventh Circuit noted, “they can return to court.”  Id.  In conclusion, \nthe Seventh Circuit stated that a reduction-in-subsidies claim is tenable if the reduction “lead[s] to \nundue institutionalization,” but absent this, such a claim “is not a theory of ‘discrimination’ at all[,] \n[but instead one] of absolute entitlement.”  Id. at 875. \nThe undisputed facts in this case demonstrate that Plaintiffs’ claim is analogous to the un-\nripe claim in Amundson in all material respects.  The Policy Change challenged in this case resulted \nin decreased or different waiver services to Plaintiffs, and consequently—at least according to \nPlaintiffs, as discussed further below—a reduction in their ability to leave their homes to partici-\npate in activities in the community.  But it is undisputed—and explicitly acknowledged by Plain-\ntiffs—that the reduction in waiver services caused by the Policy Change has not resulted in Plain-\ntiffs’ institutionalization.6  [Filing No. 146 at 18; see Filing No. 145-2 at 7; Filing No. 145-3 at 4.]  \nSimply put, the Policy Change did not alter the setting in which Plaintiffs receive their waiver \nservices, let alone lead to their institutionalization:  both before and after the Policy Change, Plain-\ntiffs received their waiver services at their homes. \n                                                 \n6 At the hearing, the Court asked the parties what in their view constitutes “institutionalization,” \nand both parties agreed that institutionalization requires a change in setting.  Thus, even by Plain-\ntiffs’ own definition of the term, they were not institutionalized as a result of the Policy Change. \n- 15 - \n \n\nGiven these facts, the similarity between this case and Amundson is striking.  In both cases \na state effectively reduced services to the developmentally disabled,7 but the reduction did not \nchange the setting in which those individuals received services, let alone cause any of them to be \ninstitutionalized.  Developmentally disabled individuals in Wisconsin could still receive services \nin group homes (even if only in less expensive ones), and Plaintiffs here still receive waiver ser-\nvices in their homes (even if fewer than before the Policy Change).  As the Seventh Circuit made \nclear, if the challenged policy fails to “land[] any developmentally disabled person in an institu-\ntion,” then the state entity “has fulfilled its obligations under federal law.”  Amundson, 721 F.3d \nat 874.  Such is the case here, and thus Amundson’s conclusion is equally applicable: Plaintiffs’ \nintegration-mandate claims are “unripe. . . .  If plaintiffs’ fears [regarding institutionalization] \ncome to pass, they can return to court.  If the fears do not come to pass, however, there is no legal \ninjury, and an opinion today would be advisory.”  Id. \nPlaintiffs rely on several authorities to resist this conclusion.  However, only two of the \nmany authorities they cite are from the Seventh Circuit.  First, Plaintiffs contend that “more appo-\nsite to the present case than Amundson is the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Bruggeman.”  [Filing \n                                                 \n7 As Plaintiffs rightly point out, in Amundson, unlike in this case, reimbursement rates to providers \nwere reduced, rather than the actual budget for services available to a developmentally disabled \nindividual, as has happened here.  But Plaintiffs draw too much from their suggestion that the \nplaintiffs in Amundson “alleged no reduction in their services whatsoever.”  [Filing No. 146 at 20.]  \nWhile this may be technically true, the Seventh Circuit explicitly noted that the practical result of \nWisconsin’s reduction in reimbursement rates caused the developmentally disabled the “largest \ncuts,” and more specifically, that some of the plaintiffs were “required to leave group settings \nwhere they would have preferred to remain,” even if they found another group home setting that \nwould accept a lower reimbursement rates.  Amundson, 721 F.3d at 872-74.  Thus in both cases, \nthe plaintiffs challenge a state policy that ultimately caused a reduction in services—whether in \nthe form of a decrease in the individual’s services budget (as here) or in the reimbursement rates \nto providers of services (as in Amundson), is a distinction without a difference.  At bottom, both \nsets of plaintiffs faced a reduction in services from the state, and this reduction did not lead to the \ninstitutionalization of either set of plaintiffs. \n- 16 - \n \n\nNo. 146 at 20.]  In Bruggeman, the Seventh Circuit noted that the integration mandate entitles \ndisabled persons “to care in the least restrictive possible environment,” and reasoned that it is not \nparadoxical that a residential institution, in certain circumstances, could be more integrated than \nliving at home.  324 F.3d at 911-12.  Given this, the Seventh Circuit acknowledged the plaintiff’s \nclaim—that “by failing to offer an alternative to the home the defendants [were] violating [the \nintegration mandate]”—may be viable, but because the district court did not address that claim on \nthe merits, remand was required.  Id. at 912.  According to Plaintiffs, Bruggeman stands for the \nproposition that the integration mandate “is triggered when a person is denied the ability to benefit \nfrom the most integrated setting possible, regardless of the physical structure of that setting.”  [Fil-\ning No. 146 at 21.]   \nAlthough Bruggeman arguably supports this proposition, it does not support Plaintiffs’ in-\ntegration-mandate claim in this case.  The Seventh Circuit in Bruggeman, as in Amundson, focused \non the setting in which services were provided.  The Bruggeman plaintiffs may have had a viable \nintegration-mandate claim because, for them, a residential institution may have been a more inte-\ngrated setting than their homes, and they alleged that the state was giving them only one option as \nto the setting of their services—their home.  See Bruggeman, 324 F.3d 911-12.  But here, the \nsetting in which Plaintiffs receive their waiver services (their homes) has not changed as a result \nof the Policy Change, nor do Plaintiffs seek to receive services in another setting.  It was this same \nlack of a change in setting that drove the result in Amundson:  the plaintiffs’ claim was unripe \nbecause the challenged policy allowed the plaintiffs to continue receiving their services in group \nhomes and did not force them into institutions.  See Amundson, 721 F.3d at 872-74.  But unlike in \nthis case and Amundson, the Bruggeman plaintiffs stated a potential integration-mandate claim \nbecause they explicitly alleged that the state was not providing services in an alternative setting.  \n- 17 - \n \n\nThus, Bruggeman fails to support Plaintiffs’ position in this case, and it is not more apposite than \nAmundson. \nThe only other integration-mandate case from the Seventh Circuit addressed by the par-\nties—Radaszewski—proceeds pursuant to the same framework as Bruggeman.  In Radaszewski, \nthe Seventh Circuit held that judgment on the pleadings was inappropriate because the plaintiff \ncould potentially show “that the services he seeks to receive at home are, in substance, already \nprovided in the institutional setting,” and his home was the most integrated setting appropriate for \nhim.    383  F.3d  at  600,  611.    In  other  words,  an  integration-mandate  claim  was  viable  in \nRadaszewski for almost the same reason it was in Bruggeman: the defendant was providing ser-\nvices in one setting (institutions), but not in the most integrated setting for the plaintiff (his home).   \nAs explained above, both this case and Amundson do not fit within the framework for a \nviable claim set out in Bruggeman and Radaszewski.  The policies challenged in this case and \nAmundson did not change the setting in which the plaintiffs receive services, nor did the plaintiffs \nseek services in a different setting, while in Bruggeman and Radaszewski there was a viable inte-\ngration-mandate claim because there were services offered in one setting that were not offered in \nthe most integrated setting for the plaintiffs.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ reliance on Bruggeman and \nRadaszewski does not support their position.  When read with Amundson, these cases establish that \nan integration-mandate claim is viable only when the challenged policy necessitates a change in \nsetting or provides services in one setting that are not offered in a more integrated one.  The Policy \nChange challenged here does neither, and thus Plaintiffs integration-mandate claim is unripe.  See \nAmundson, 721 F.3d at 874. \n \n \n \n- 18 - \n \n\nB.  Plaintiffs’ Novel Integration-Mandate Claim is Contrary to Seventh Circuit \nPrecedent and the Other Authorities on Which They Rely.  \n \nPlaintiffs maintain that integration-mandate claims are not limited to situations in which \nindividuals are institutionalized or at risk of institutionalization.  The protection offered by the \nintegration mandate, Plaintiffs argue, is much broader in that it “prohibits policies that isolate in-\ndividuals in their homes.”  [Filing No. 146 at 21-22.]  Therefore, although Amundson and most \nintegration-mandate cases generally focus on institutionalization, Plaintiffs argue that it does not \nfollow that these claims are so limited.  [Filing No. 146 at 22-23; Filing No. 152 at 13-17.]   \nPlaintiffs point to the language of the integration-mandate regulation itself and the DOJ’s \ninterpretation of their regulations to support their position.  Specifically, the integration mandate \nrequires services to be administered “in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs” of \ndisabled individuals.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); see 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d).  The “most integrated set-\nting” is “a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to \nthe fullest extent possible.”  28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. B.  The DOJ issued a “Statement on Enforce-\nment of the Integration Mandate and Olmstead” in 2011, in which it explained that integrated \nsettings “are located in mainstream society; offer access to community activities and opportunities \nat times, frequencies and with persons of an individual’s choosing; afford individuals choice in \ntheir daily life activities; and, provide individuals with disabilities the opportunity to interact with \nnon-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible.”  [Filing No. 145-7 at 2.] \nThese authorities, however, do not vindicate Plaintiffs’ broad reading of the integration \nmandate.  Like the Seventh Circuit authorities discussed above, the regulations and the DOJ’s \ninterpretation thereof focus on the setting in which services are provided.  Again, Plaintiffs do not \nchallenge the setting in which Defendants provide waivers services; prior to the Policy Change \nPlaintiffs received services in their homes and they continue to do so.  Plaintiffs instead seek more \n- 19 - \n \n\nwaiver services in the same setting.  Their Statement of Claims submitted to the Court before the \ninstant summary judgment motions were filed makes this clear:  Plaintiffs “intend to prove at trial” \nthat “[t]he level of services offered, provided, and/or available to the plaintiffs-intervenors as a \nresult of their termination from the [A&D Waiver] violates the integration mandate.”  [Filing No. \n141 at 1.]  The regulations and the DOJ’s interpretive guidance do not discuss the level of services \nprovided, and thus Plaintiffs’ reliance on them is misplaced.   \nWhen pressed on the issue at the hearing, Plaintiffs again recognized that the integration \nmandate is about the setting in which services are provided, not the amount of services provided; \nbut Plaintiffs argued that at some point the distinction between the two types of claims collapses \nwhen a person receives so few services at their home that they rarely if ever can leave their home \nfor activities in the community.  It may very well be true that services can be so dramatically cut \nthat what was once the most integrated setting for an individual no longer is, and the individual \nmay be entitled to services in another setting.  But this is not the case here.  Plaintiffs occasionally \nleave their homes for activities in the community, [Filing No. 145-2 at 4; Filing No. 145-3 at 4], \nand they seek more waiver services via this lawsuit so that they can do so more often.  Such a \nclaim, at its core, is simply a claim for more services and has nothing to do with the setting in \nwhich services are provided.  A “more services” claim has never been recognized by the Supreme \n- 20 - \n \n\nCourt or Seventh Circuit; indeed, both courts have disavowed such claims, reasoning that the in-\ntegration mandate is only implicated by a difference or change in setting, not in services.8  See \nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 603 n.14 (“We do not in this opinion hold that the ADA imposes on the \nStates a standard of care for whatever medical services they render, or that the ADA requires States \nto provide a certain level of benefits to individuals with disabilities.”); Amundson, 721 F.3d at 875 \n(“[Plaintiffs’] sole argument is that Wisconsin reduced their own subsidies.  Apart from the possi-\nbility (which is unripe) that the reduction may lead to undue institutionalization, this is not a theory \nof ‘discrimination’ at all.  It is a claim of absolute entitlement.”).   \nFurthermore, an examination of what level of services is appropriate is contrary to the Sev-\nenth Circuit’s caution in Bruggeman that “[t]he purpose of the [the integration mandate] is not to \nconstitute the federal courts the supervisors of the care and treatment of disabled persons.”  324 \nF.3d at 913.  Yet Plaintiffs’ “more services” claim essentially asks the Court to do precisely that; \nif the Court accepted Plaintiffs’ novel integration-mandate theory, it would have to assess the ser-\nvices provided to each Plaintiff under the FS Waiver and make a judgment as to whether the ser-\nvices available allow them to be sufficiently integrated into the community.  Yet Plaintiffs have \n                                                 \n8 For these same reasons, Plaintiffs’ reliance on Lane v. Kitzhaber, 841 F.Supp.2d 1199 (D. Or. \n2012), and, K.M. v. Hyde Park Cent. Sch. Dist., 381 F.Supp.2d 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), is unpersua-\nsive.  Plaintiffs maintain that these cases establish that the integration mandate “extends beyond \nactual institutionalization.”  [Filing No. 146 at 23.]  This is true, but only in the limited sense that, \nas recognized in Bruggeman, the most integrated setting for a particular person may be in a resi-\ndential institution rather than at home.  See Bruggeman, 324 F.3d at 911-12.  Critical to an inte-\ngration-mandate claim is that there are two possible settings, one of which is more integrated than \nthe other, and the challenged state policy or action has rendered the more integrated setting una-\nvailable to the plaintiff.  The district court cases on which Plaintiffs rely support this proposition, \nbut no more, at least as it relates to Plaintiffs’ claims here.  See, e.g., Lane, 841 F.Supp.2d at 1205-\n08 (holding that the plaintiffs stated a viable integration-mandate claim by alleging that the de-\nfendants provided employment services only in sheltered workshops instead of providing services \nto allow for supported, integrated employment programs, and dismissing other claims based on \n“inadequate services”). \n- 21 - \n \n\nnot proposed to the Court—let alone provided any authority on the point—a baseline against which \nthe Court would measure whether a certain level of community access is sufficient.  This is perhaps \nbecause, as explained above, integration-mandate cases consistently contrast two different settings \nin which disabled individuals seek services, not, as Plaintiffs urge here, an assessment of whether \nthe level of services in a single setting permits an individual to participate in the community enough \n(whatever enough may be).  \n  In sum, because Plaintiffs’ claim is about the amount of services they receive, rather than \nthe setting in which they receive them, the authorities on which they rely do not support their novel \nintegration-mandate claim.   \nC.  Other Circuits’ Integration-Mandate Standards Are Contrary to Amundson \nThe United States (as an Interested Party), and Plaintiffs to a lesser extent, argues that the \ndecrease in services caused by the Policy Change places Plaintiffs at risk of institutionalization \nand urges this Court to follow the several other circuits that have held that a plaintiff need only \nallege a risk of institutionalization to state a ripe integration-mandate claim.  [Filing No. 155 at 12-\n17.]  Defendants respond that the standards adopted by the other circuits are contrary to Amundson.  \n[Filing No. 159 at 5-7.] \nThree circuits have held that plaintiffs can proceed with an integration-mandate claim if \nthe state policy or conduct they challenge has made them “at risk of institutionalization.”  Pashby \nv. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 322 (4th Cir. 2013); see M.R. v. Dreyfus, 663 F.3d 1100, 1102 (9th Cir. \n2011); Fisher v. Okla. Health Care Authority, 335 F.3d 1175, 1181-82 (10th Cir. 2003).  The \nCourt, however, cannot adopt this standard because the Seventh Circuit was clear in Amundson \nthat actual institutionalization was necessary before an integration-mandate claim is ripe.  See \n- 22 - \n \n\nAmundson, 721 F.3d at 874 (holding that the plaintiff’s integration-mandate claim was unripe be-\ncause the challenged reduction in subsidies did not “land[] any developmentally disabled person \nin an institution”).  The Seventh Circuit explicitly noted that the plaintiffs in Amundson feared \ninstitutionalization, “but their fears may be unwarranted.”  Id.  “If the fears do not come to pass,” \nthe Seventh Circuit continued, “there is no legal injury.”  Id.  Thus, contrary to the United States’ \nposition otherwise, the Seventh Circuit focused on whether any of the plaintiffs were actually in-\nstitutionalized, not their risk of institutionalization.   \nFurther reinforcing this reading of Amundson is the fact that the plaintiffs in that case ex-\nplicitly argued to the Seventh Circuit that it should adopt the “risk of institutionalization” standard, \nand they cited the very circuit cases and DOJ interpretive guidance relied on by Plaintiffs and the \nUnited States here.  See Amundson v. Wis. Dept. of Health Servs., No. 13-1351, Dkt. 14-1 at 30-\n38; Dkt. 31 at 5-6.  The plaintiffs in Amundson set forth “several examples” to the Seventh Circuit \nof how the challenged Wisconsin policy caused them to be at risk of institutionalization.  Id.  Nev-\nertheless, the Seventh Circuit did not analyze any of the plaintiffs’ individual situations to deter-\nmine whether they were at risk of institutionalization.  See Amundson, 721 F.3d at 873-84.  This \nis because the Seventh Circuit’s analysis was categorical:  absent actual institutionalization, the \nplaintiffs’ integration-mandate claims were unripe.  See id.  The Seventh Circuit noted that if the \nperceived risk of institutionalization came to fruition, the plaintiffs could “return to court” at that \ntime.  Id.  Therefore, following Amundson, it would be improper for this Court to adopt a “risk of \ninstitutionalization” standard.   \n \n \n \n \n- 23 - \n \n\nD.  Even If Plaintiffs’ Novel Integration-Mandate Claim Was Viable (Which It Is \nNot), Plaintiffs Have Not Established that the Policy Change Caused Their \nDecreased Community Activities. \n \nThe foregoing analysis assumes that the Policy Change caused Plaintiffs to enter into the \ncommunity less frequently than they were able to before the Policy Change because Plaintiffs’ \nclaims are unripe even if this is true.  The Court wishes to briefly highlight, however, that the \nevidence does not necessarily bear this out.  Although there is evidence that Plaintiffs each enter \ninto the community less frequently than before the Policy Change, [Filing No. 145-2 at 4; Filing \nNo. 145-3 at 4], whether this decrease was caused by the Policy Change is less clear.  The lack of \nclarity is in large part because Plaintiffs failed to delve into the precise changes in services the \nPolicy Change caused them.  This left the Court to question counsel at the hearing regarding these \nchanges.  Even after the hearing, however, the Court is left only with a limited evidentiary picture \nof how each Plaintiff was affected by the Policy Change in terms of how it directly impacted their \nability to leave their homes for community activities.  The following examples explain why the \nCourt has reservations regarding whether the Policy Change caused Plaintiffs’ decrease in com-\nmunity activities.   \nPlaintiffs’ briefing discussed the effects of the Policy Change strictly in terms of hours of \nwaiver services received before and after the Policy Change.  But comparing only the hours of \nservices received obscures the details of why Plaintiffs received the services they did before the \nPolicy Change and why they choose to receive the services they do now.  For example, the parties \nat the hearing did not dispute that the Coles receive more waivers services now ($16,530) than \nthey did before the Policy Change ($10,871) in strictly monetary terms.  It is further undisputed \nthat individuals receiving waiver services may choose what services they wish to utilize, which \nare reimbursed at different rates depending on the service.  Given this, it is difficult for the Court \n- 24 - \n \n\nto conclude that the decrease in the Coles’ participation in activities outside the home is caused by \nthe Policy Change when the Coles chose not to use their increased waiver services budget to par-\nticipate in the community—e.g., for community habilitation services offered through the waivers \nthat are designed to permit interactions with others. \nUnlike the Coles, Mr. Maertz receives fewer waiver services now (~$16,000) than he did \nbefore the Policy Change (~$25,000).  However, the fact that he rarely is able to leave his home \nto go into the community is due, at least in part, to the fact that the employer through whom Ms. \nKemp provides waiver services to Mr. Maertz does not allow her to take Mr. Maertz into the com-\nmunity during the time in which she is reimbursed for services.  [Filing No. 145-3 at 4.]  Thus it \nappears—at least in part—that it is not the decrease in waiver services caused by the Policy Change \nthat prevents Mr. Maertz from entering into the community more frequently, but the fact that Ms. \nKemp is his sole provider of waiver services and her employer does not allow her to be reimbursed \nfor services outside of the home.  Simply put, if Mr. Maertz is choosing to utilize a provider for \nwaiver services that precludes those services from being used outside the home, the Court would \nbe hard pressed to conclude that Mr. Maertz’s decrease in community integration is caused by the \nPolicy Change. \nIn the end, the Court need not definitively decide whether sufficient causation is present \nbecause, as explained above, Plaintiffs’ integration-mandate claims are unripe under Amundson.  \nBut even were this not the case, the foregoing evidentiary difficulties would create a significant \nstumbling block for Plaintiffs’ claims. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n \nIntegration-mandate claims focus on the setting in which services to disabled persons are \nprovided.  Plaintiffs challenge Defendants’ Policy Change via the integration mandate, but the \n- 25 - \n \n\nPolicy Change has not altered the setting in which Plaintiffs receive Medicaid waiver services, let \nalone forced Plaintiffs into institutions.  The Seventh Circuit has made clear that the integration \nmandate is not implicated by a reduction in services to the disabled unless the individuals are \ninstitutionalized as a result of the reduction.  At the very least, the integration mandate requires the \nchallenged reduction to impact the setting in which services are provided.  Plaintiffs here have not \nbeen institutionalized or had the setting in which they receive Medicaid waiver services impacted \nas a result of the Policy Change.  Until that occurs, Plaintiffs’ integration-mandate claims are un-\nripe. \nThe Court recognizes that Plaintiffs offer a novel theory of why the integration mandate is \nimplicated:  the reduction in waiver services has decreased, although not foreclosed, Plaintiffs’ \nability to leave their homes to engage in activities in the community.  In this sense, Plaintiffs are \nless integrated into the community.  Such an argument, however, alters the focus of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims away from the setting in which they receive services to the amount of services they receive.  \nBut the Supreme Court has made clear that the integration mandate does not require states to “pro-\nvide a certain level of benefits to individuals with disabilities,” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603 n.14, \nand the Seventh Circuit has rejected such a claim, describing it as one for “absolute entitlement,” \nAmundson, 721 F.3d at 875. \nThe foregoing is not mean to minimize the hardship Defendants’ Policy Change has alleg-\nedly caused Plaintiffs and their family caregivers, who provide both compensated and uncompen-\nsated care for their disabled family members.  But relevant precedent is clear.  And it is for the \nSeventh Circuit, not this Court, to expand the reach of the integration mandate beyond the bound-\naries the Seventh Circuit has set. \n- 26 - \n \n\nFor these reasons, Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED, [Filing No. \n143], and Plaintiffs’ Cross Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED, [Filing No. 145].  Plain-\ntiffs’ integration-mandate claim is unripe and is therefore dismissed without prejudice.  Final Judg-\nment shall issue accordingly. \nDATE: June 9, 2015 _______________________________\nHon.

Karla Steimel is an adult Medicaid recipient with cerebral palsy who, as a result of this \ncondition, requires assistance in all aspects of daily living.  In order to receive this assistance in a \ncommunity setting, rather than in an institution, Ms. Steimel has sought placement on two (2) \ndifferent  Medicaid  waiver  programs  operated  by  the  Indiana  Family  and  Social  Services \nAdministration  (“the  agency”):  the  Community  Integration  and  Habilitation  Waiver  (“CIH \nWaiver”) and the Aged and Disabled Waiver (“A&D Waiver”).  After being deemed eligible for \nboth programs, Ms. Steimel was placed on a waiting list for the CIH Waiver for twelve (12) or \nfifteen (15) years, and in the interim was placed on the A&D Waiver.  However, two (2) changes \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 2 of 19 PageID #: 2\nin the agency’s policies occurring in late 2012 and early 2013 have resulted in her inability to \ncontinue receiving services through either waiver program.  First, the agency eliminated entirely \nthe wait-list for the CIH Waiver and instead determined that only persons who meet certain \n“priority criteria” may receive placement on that waiver.  And second, the agency determined \nthat persons with developmental disabilities who do not require skilled nursing services (such as \nassistance with a ventilator or with medication administration) may not receive services through \nthe A&D Waiver. \n2.  Rather, Ms. Steimel has been offered placement on a smaller waiver program, also \noperated by the agency, that does not provide sufficient services to ensure her health and safety \nin  the  community.    She  is  therefore  at  risk  for  the  first  time  in  her  life  of  requiring \ninstitutionalization.    The  agency’s  elimination  of  the  wait-list  for  the  CIH  Waiver  and  its \ndetermination that persons who do not meet its “priority criteria” may not receive placement on \nthat waiver, as well as its requirement that individuals with developmental disabilities require \nskilled nursing services for placement on the A&D Waiver, violates the “integration mandate” of \nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq., and of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.  Additionally, to the extent that Ms. Steimel was not \noffered a mechanism through which to appeal the elimination of her position on the wait-list for \nthe CIH Waiver, that failure violates federal Medicaid law, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). \n3.  The agency’s various policies each affect hundreds, if not thousands, of persons, and this \ncase is therefore suitable for class treatment pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure.  Appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief must be entered on \nbehalf of Ms. Steimel and the classes. \nJurisdiction, Venue, and Cause of Action \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 3 of 19 PageID #: 3\n4.  The Court has jurisdiction of this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n5.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \n6.

Introduction to the Agency’s Medicaid Waiver Programs \n25.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services may waive certain requirements of \nthe Medicaid program for states that include as “medical assistance” under their State plan home \nand community-based services that are provided to an individual who, but for such services, \nwould require the level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care \nfacility for the mentally retarded.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1). \n26.  The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (“the agency”) currently operates \nfour  (4)  such  home  and  community-based  Medicaid  waiver  programs,  which  are  programs \napproved by the  U.S. Department of  Health  and Human Services pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n1396n(c).  Of these programs, two (2) are operated through the agency’s Division of Disability \nand Rehabilitative Services (“DDRS”) (the Community  Integration and Habilitation Waiver \n[“CIH Waiver”] and the Family Supports Waiver [“FS Waiver”]) and two (2) are operated \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 7 of 19 PageID #: 7\nthrough the agency’s Division of Aging (the Aged and Disabled Waiver [“A&D Waiver”] and \nthe Traumatic Brain Injury Waiver [“TBI Waiver”]).  \n27.  Historically, the agency has operated five (5) home and community-based Medicaid \nwaiver programs, three (3) through DDRS.  The three (3) operated through DDRS were known \nas the Developmental Disabilities Waiver (“DD Waiver”), the Autism Waiver, and the Support \nServices Waiver (“SS Waiver”).  However, on or around September 1, 2012, the DD Waiver and \nthe Autism Waiver merged and became the CIH Waiver, and the SS Waiver became the FS \nWaiver.  Persons enrolled in the previous waiver programs were automatically transitioned to the \nnewly named programs.  Therefore, throughout this complaint and for the purposes of simplicity, \nthe  current  names  of  the  waiver  programs  are  utilized  to  refer  both  to  the  current  waiver \nprograms and their predecessors. \n28.  An individual enrolled in a Medicaid home and community-based waiver program in \nIndiana must demonstrate that, but for his or her enrollment in that program, he or she would \nrequire institutionalization, either through placement in an intermediate care facility for the \nmentally retarded (for the waiver programs operated by DDRS) or through placement in a \nnursing facility (for the waiver programs operated by the Division of Aging).  This individual \nmay receive, through that program, specified types of services in his or her home or other \ncommunity setting in lieu of institutionalization. \n29.  Each  Medicaid  home  and  community-based  waiver  program  in  Indiana  has  an \n“enrollment cap”—that is, a total number of individuals that may receive services through that \nprogram.  In 2013, the enrollment cap for the CIH Waiver is 7,370 persons; the enrollment cap \nfor the A&D Waiver is 13,951 persons; and the enrollment cap for the FS Waiver is 5,267 \npersons.  Historically, individuals who seek enrollment in a home and community-based waiver \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 8 of 19 PageID #: 8\nprogram that has reached its capacity have been placed on a wait-list to receive such services \n(assuming they were otherwise eligible). \nB.  The Elimination of the Wait-List for the CIH Waiver \n30.  Historically, the CIH Waiver has maintained a lengthy wait-list, such that persons often \ndo not receive services through that waiver program until ten (10) or fifteen (15) years after they \ninitially seek placement on the program.  On August 31, 2012, the wait-list for placement on the \nCIH Waiver contained many thousands, or perhaps even tens of thousands, of persons. \n31.  However, on or about September 1, 2012, the wait-list for enrollment in the CIH Waiver \nwas eliminated entirely.  Rather, persons who were previously on the wait-list for the CIH \nWaiver  were  sent  a  letter  titled  “Targeting  Letter  for  DDRS’  Family  Supports  Waiver” \n(“Targeting Letter”).  In pertinent part, this Targeting Letter informed persons on the wait-list for \nthe CIH Waiver that the only way to access the CIH Waiver “is if an individual meets specific \nemergency priority criteria.”  The Targeting Letter therefore required individuals to respond \nwithin thirty (30) days to accept a placement on the wait-list for the FS Waiver; if they did not so \nrespond, their named “w[ould] be removed from the Medicaid Waiver wait list and th[e] slot \nw[ould] be offered to another individual on the waiting list.”  A true and correct copy of the \nTargeting Letter is attached and incorporated herein as Exhibit 1.  A true and correct summary of \na “Webinar” provided by the agency explaining some of the changes in its policies is attached \nand incorporated herein as Exhibit 2. \n32.  The Targeting Letter did not inform persons that they could appeal the agency’s decisions \nor provide any details on the manner in which they might do so.  Rather, no such appeals process \nwas made available to persons, even if they believed that they met one or more of the “specific \nemergency priority criteria.” \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 9 of 19 PageID #: 9\n33.  The  “specific  emergency  priority  criteria”  referenced  in  the  letter  whereby  persons \nmeeting such criteria may be eligible for the CIH Waiver are as follows: \n•  Otherwise eligible individuals transitioning to the community from a nursing facility, \nESN, or SOF. \n•  Otherwise eligible individuals determined to no longer need/receive active treatment in \nan SGL. \n•  Otherwise eligible individuals transitioning from 100% state funded services. \n•  Otherwise eligible individuals aging out of certain services offered by the Department of \nEducation, the Department of Child Services, or SGL. \n•  Otherwise eligible individuals requesting to leave a large private ICF/ID. \n•  Otherwise eligible individuals meeting the following emergency criteria: \n \n(cid:1)  Death of a Primary Caregiver where there is no other caregiver available. \n(cid:1)  Caregiver over 80 years of age where there is no other caregiver available. \n(cid:1)  Evidence of abuse or neglect in the current institution or SGL placement. \n(cid:1)  Extraordinary health and safety risk as reviewed and approved by the Director of \nDDRS. \n \n34.  As used in these criteria, “ESN” refers to “extensive support needs,” which are group \nhomes designed and licensed to meet the needs of individuals with intensive behavioral and/or \nmedical needs; “SOF” refers to a “state-operated facility,” which is the same as a state institution \nor state hospital; and “SGL” refers to “supervised group living,” which is a group home licensed \nunder Indiana Code § 12-28-5-10, et seq.  Finally, “ICF/ID” refers to an “intermediate care \nfacility for the intellectually disabled,” which is or has in the past been also referenced as an \nintermediate care facility for the mentally retarded (ICF/MR) or an intermediate care facility for \nthe developmentally disabled (ICF/DD). \n35.  Many persons who were previously on or were previously eligible for placement on the \nCIH Waiver wait-list will never meet these “specific emergency priority criteria.”  For instance, \npersons institutionalized in an ICF/ID that does not qualify as a “large private ICF/ID” (or \npersons who may be placed in such a facility) are unlikely to ever be eligible for the CIH Waiver \nunder these criteria. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 10 of 19 PageID #: 10\n36.  Placement on the FS Waiver is not a complete or adequate substitute for placement on the \nCIH Waiver for many individuals who were previously on the wait-list for the CIH Waiver. \n37.    Many persons have applied for or otherwise sought services through the CIH Waiver \nbecause their disabling conditions cause them to require substantial care, supervision, and/or \nassistance in order for them to reside safely in the community, and in numerous instances these \nindividuals possess disabling conditions that cause them to require constant (24/7) care and \nsupervision.  Accordingly, depending on their  needs and other circumstances, persons may \nreceive through the CIH Waiver services up to twenty-one (21) hours each day. \n38.  On the other hand, persons enrolled in the FS Waiver may receive no more than $16,250 \nin services each year.  This is an amount that equates to approximately forty (40) hours each \nmonth in care, supervision, and habilitation.  This limit on services means that the FS Waiver is \ngrossly inadequate as an alternative to placement on the CIH Waiver. \nC.  Transitioning Persons Away from the A&D Waiver and the TBI Waiver \n39.  In or around September of 2011, the agency (and its Division of Aging) issued a “Policy \nChange”—effective October 1, 2011—entitled “Nursing Facility Medicaid Waivers: Level of \nCare Policy Statement” (“2011 Policy Change”).  A true and correct copy of this 2011 Policy \nChange is attached and incorporated herein as Exhibit 3. \n40.  This 2011 Policy Change rescinded an earlier Policy Statement, which had been in effect \nsince September 12, 2006 (“2006 Policy Statement”).  A true and correct copy of this 2006 \nPolicy Statement is attached and incorporated herein as Exhibit 4. \n41.  According to the 2011 Policy Change, the 2006 Policy Statement had, in pertinent part, \n“announced that children under age eleven (11) and/or individuals with a MR/DD [mentally \nretarded/developmentally disabled] diagnosis could be eligible for the Aged and Disabled and \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 11 of 19 PageID #: 11\nTraumatic Brain Injury waivers” provided that these individuals “meet nursing facility level of \ncare requirements as outlined through the Eligibility Screen assessment tool, section 1 and/or \nsection 2.” \n42.  As indicated, in order to receive services through the A&D Waiver or the TBI Waiver, an \nindividual must meet “nursing facility level of care.”  To determine whether an individual so \nqualifies, the agency completes a so-called “Eligibility Screen” (State Form 45528).  A true and \ncorrect copy of this Eligibility Screen is attached and incorporated herein as Exhibit 5. \n43.  As  is  pertinent  here,  the  Eligibility  Screen  contains  two  (2)  sections  relevant  to \ndetermining whether an individual meets nursing facility level of care.   \n44.  The  first  section  (Section  1)  of  the  Eligibility  Screen  is  entitled  “Severe  Medical \nConditions”: if one (1) or more of the conditions in this section exist, then that person is deemed \nto meet nursing facility level of care.  The conditions in this section generally refer to needs \nrequiring  skilled  assistance,  such  as  the  administration  of  medications  or  other  injections, \nassistance with operating a ventilator, or suctioning or tube feeding.     \n45.  The second section (Section 2A) is entitled “Substantial Medical Conditions Including \nActivities of Daily Living”: if three (3) or more of the conditions in this section exist, then that \nperson is likewise deemed to meet nursing facility level of care.  The conditions in this section \ngenerally refer to substantial needs that do not necessarily require assistance from a skilled \ncaregiver, such as assistance in eating, transferring, bathing, or ambulating. \n46.  Numerous persons with developmental disabilities have been or are enrolled in the A&D \nWaiver and/or the TBI Waiver insofar as they meet nursing facility level of care under the \nrequirements of Section 2A of the Eligibility Screen. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 12 of 19 PageID #: 12\n47.  Nonetheless, the agency has interpreted and applied its 2011 Policy Change to require \nthat children under age eleven (11) and developmentally disabled individuals require skilled \nnursing services—such as suctioning, ventilation, or tube feeding—in order to receive services \nthrough the A&D Waiver or the TBI Waiver.  This is so even if these individuals meet nursing \nfacility level of care requirements.   \n48.  However, individuals who were approved for the A&D Waiver and/or the TBI Waiver \nprior to the 2011 Policy Change may continue to receive services through that program until they \neither voluntarily withdraw or transfer to another waiver program.  Nonetheless, the agency has \nrequired and is requiring all persons enrolled in the A&D Waiver and/or the TBI Waiver to \ntransfer to the FS Waiver if (a) they are developmentally disabled and/or under age eleven (11) \nand do not routinely require skilled nursing services and (b) they are otherwise eligible for the FS \nWaiver. \n49.  For  the  reasons  described  above,  the  FS  Waiver  is  not  an  adequate  alternative  to \nplacement on the A&D Waiver and/or the TBI Waiver. \n50.  Eligibility for the FS Waiver is determined by application of the definition of “persons \nwith related conditions” contained within 42 C.F.R. § 435.1010.  Specifically, an individual must \nmeet the following requirements: \n•  He or she must have a severe, chronic disability that is attributable to cerebral palsy, \nepilepsy, or any other condition, other than mental illness, that is found to be closely \nrelated to Intellectual Disability because this condition results in impairment of general \nintellectual functioning or adaptive behavior similar to that of mentally retarded persons, \nand requires treatment or services similar to those required for these persons. \n•  His or her disability must have manifested before the person reached age 22. \n•  His or her disability must be likely to continue indefinitely. \n•  His or her disability must result in substantial functional limitations in three or more of \nthe following areas of major life activity: \n \n(cid:1)  Self-care. \n(cid:1)  Understanding and use of language. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 13 of 19 PageID #: 13\n(cid:1)  Learning. \n(cid:1)  Mobility \n(cid:1)  Self-direction. \n(cid:1)  Capacity for independent living. \n \n51.  Because  of  the  nature  of  these  requirements,  nearly  every  individual  with  a \ndevelopmental disability previously enrolled in or eligible for the A&D Waiver and/or the TBI \nWaiver to whom the 2011 Policy Change applies will also be eligible for services through the FS \nWaiver. \n  Facts Concerning Karla Steimel \n52.  Karla Steimel is an adult resident of Knox County, Indiana.  She is currently twenty-\nseven (27) years old and is a Medicaid recipient. \n53.  Ms. Steimel is developmentally disabled.  She has a primary diagnosis of cerebral palsy, \nand also has physical disabilities, including arthritis and incontinence. \n54.  As a result of her cerebral palsy, Ms. Steimel requires assistance in completing all aspects \nof her daily living.  She cannot ambulate by herself and therefore is confined to a wheelchair at \nall times when she is not in bed.  She requires complete assistance, for instance, in transferring, \nbathing, toileting, preparing meals, and running errands.  She also requires an assistant to be \npresent during all waking hours because she would be unable to ensure her safety in case of an \nemergency such as a fire or a fall. \n55.  Ms. Steimel resided with her parents until she was approximately twenty (20) years old.  \nSince that time, she has been living by herself in the community, and has been renting a house at \nher current address for the past three (3) years.  \n56.  Approximately twelve (12) or fifteen (15) years ago, Ms. Steimel applied for enrollment \nin the CIH Waiver (which was at the time known as the Developmental Disabilities Waiver).  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 14 of 19 PageID #: 14\nShe was accepted onto the wait-list for the CIH Waiver, and remained on that wait-list until \napproximately September 1, 2012. \n57.  While Ms. Steimel was on the wait-list to receive services through the CIH Waiver, she \napplied for and was offered a slot on the A&D Waiver.  Ms. Steimel has therefore been receiving \nservices through that waiver program for at least eight (8) years. \n58.  Through the A&D Waiver, Ms. Steimel currently receives approximately one hundred \nsixty (160) hours each month in so-called “attendant care” services.  Attendant care services are \nthose services provided through the waiver that primarily involve hands-on care and assistance \nfor persons with disabilities (such as assistance in transferring, toileting, bathing, preparing \nmeals, and running errands).  They are provided to allow such individuals to remain in their \nhomes while receiving assistance to carry out activities of daily living, self-care, and mobility.  \nThrough these services, Ms. Steimel also receives transportation to the Knox County ARC, \nwhere she is employed and receives employment-related services from approximately 8:30 a.m. \nto 2:00 p.m. five (5) days a week.  \n59.  In addition to the services that she receives through the A&D Waiver, Ms. Steimel \nreceives approximately thirty-eight (38) hours each week in services from a home health agency.  \nSee IND. ADMIN. CODE tit. 405, r. 5-16-1, et seq. (describing home health agency services).  \nThese  are  services  that  are  provided  through  the  traditional  Medicaid  program,  rather  than \nthrough a waiver program, and for which prior authorization has been sought and obtained \npursuant to Title 405, Rule 5-3-1, et seq., of the Indiana Administrative Code.  However, these \n“home health” services cannot be provided to Ms. Steimel outside of her home, and she may \ntherefore not utilize these services to run errands or engage in other community activities, or to \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 15 of 19 PageID #: 15\ntransport herself to work.  Regardless, Ms. Steimel is not eligible to receive additional “home \nhealth” services beyond those that she is currently receiving. \n60.  On or about January 10, 2013, the agency sent to Ms. Steimel a copy of the letter titled \n“Targeting Letter for DDRS’ Family Supports Waiver” (Exhibit 1).  As indicated, this letter \ninformed Ms. Steimel that, notwithstanding the fact that she had spent over a decade on a waiting \nlist to receive services through the CIH Waiver, there would no longer be a waiting list and she \ncould not access services through this waiver unless she met certain “specific emergency priority \ncriteria.”  This letter did not inform Ms. Steimel that she could appeal the agency’s decision or \nprovide any details on the manner in which she might do so.  Rather, no such appeals process \nwas made available to her, even though she believes the agency’s decision is erroneous and \nwishes to appeal it.  A true and correct copy of the letter received by Ms. Steimel is attached and \nincorporated herein as Exhibit 6.   \n61.  Further communications with representatives of the agency confirmed that Ms. Steimel \nwas and is not considered to meet any of the agency’s priority criteria.  Ms. Steimel agrees that \nshe  does  not  meet  any  of  these  criteria,  with the  possible  exception  that  she  believes  that \ntransitioning to the FS Waiver will present an “extraordinary health and safety risk.”  However, \nshe does not know the precise meaning of that term as employed by the agency, and she has not \nbeen reviewed and approved as having such a risk by the Director of DDRS. \n62.  Moreover, also in or around January of 2013, Ms. Steimel was informed that, as a result \nof the 2011 Policy Change described above, she could no longer receive services through the \nA&D Waiver insofar as she does not have any “skilled medical needs”—that is, that she does not \nroutinely require skilled nursing services.  However, she was informed that, if she did not meet \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 16 of 19 PageID #: 16\nICF/ID level of care, such that she would be eligible for placement on the FS Waiver, then she \ncould continue receiving services through the A&D Waiver. \n63.  Ms. Steimel meets both nursing facility level of care (required for eligibility on the A&D \nWaiver) and ICF/ID level of care (required for eligibility on the CIH Waiver and the FS Waiver).  \nA  true  and  correct  copy  of  the  Eligibility  Screen  (completed  in  September  of  2012) \ndemonstrating that she meets nursing facility level of care is attached and incorporated herein as \nExhibit 7.  A true and correct copy of the letter from DDRS (completed in April of 2013) \ndemonstrating that she meets ICF/ID level of care is attached and incorporated herein as Exhibit \n8. \n64.  Accordingly, Ms. Steimel has been removed from the wait-list for the CIH Waiver as \nwell as from placement on the A&D Waiver in favor of placement on the FS Waiver.   \n65.  However, the services offered through the FS Waiver are inadequate to provide for Ms. \nSteimel’s needs and will leave her without necessary care and supervision for much of every \nsingle day.  Specifically, even though Ms. Steimel receives approximately forty (40) hours each \nweek in attendant care services through the A&D Waiver presently, through the FS Waiver she \nwould only be able to receive approximately forty (40) hours each month in services.  Moreover, \nbecause of the limited amount of services available through the FS Waiver, Ms. Steimel would \nbe required to utilize these services in order to perform necessary tasks at home rather than to \ntransport her to her employment or other community activities. \n66.  If Ms. Steimel is transitioned to the FS Waiver, she will be at grave risk of immediate and \nirreparable harm in the community.  She will therefore be required to, for the first time, consider \nplacement in an institutional setting. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 17 of 19 PageID #: 17\n67.  Ms. Steimel’s needs, as well as the needs of the members of putative Class A and \nputative  Class  C,  may  be  reasonably  accommodated  in  the  community  without  causing  a \nfundamental alteration to the agency’s services. \n68.  Ms. Steimel is not positive as to when she will be transitioned off of the A&D Waiver \nand on to the FS Waiver.  However, as a result of her communications with her case manager, \nshe believes that this is likely within a week or two. \n  Concluding Factual Allegations \n69.  The agency, DDRS, and the Division of Aging all receive federal funds, and are therefore \nsubject to the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. \n70.  As a result of the actions or inactions of the defendants, the plaintiff and the members of \nthe putative classes are suffering irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law. \n71.  The defendants have, at all times, acted or refused to act under color of state law. \nLegal Claims \n72.  The elimination of the wait-list for the CIH Waiver and the requirement that only those \npersons who meet the agency’ “specific emergency priority criteria” may be considered for \nplacement on this waiver violates the “integration mandate” of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  This claim is brought on behalf of Ms. Steimel \nand Class A. \n73.  The failure to provide persons eliminated from the wait-list for the CIH Waiver with \nnotice and an opportunity to appeal that action violates 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3).  This claim is \nbrought on behalf of Ms. Steimel and Class B. \n74.  The  elimination  of  persons  with  developmental  disabilities  who  do  not  have  skilled \nmedical needs—that is, do not routinely require skilled nursing services—from the A&D Waiver \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 18 of 19 PageID #: 18\nviolates the “integration mandate” of the Americans with Disabilities  Act of 1990  and the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.  This claim is brought on behalf of Ms. Steimel and Class C. \nRequest for Relief \n  WHEREFORE, the plaintiff and the putative classes respectfully request that this Court \ndo the following: \n1.  Accept jurisdiction of this cause and set it for hearing. \n2.  Certify this case as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, with the classes as defined above. \n3.  Declare that the defendants have violated the rights of the plaintiff and the classes for the \nreasons described above. \n4.  Issue a preliminary injunction, later to be made permanent, requiring the defendants to: \na.  Re-instate the wait-list for placement on the CIH Waiver for the plaintiff and the \nmembers  of  Class  A,  eliminate  any  requirement  that  persons  meet  the  agency’s \n“specific  emergency  priority  criteria”  to  be  placed  on  this  wait-list,  and  provide \nsufficient slots through this waiver for the wait-list to move at a reasonable pace. \nb.  Provide notice and an opportunity to appeal the elimination of their place on the wait-\nlist for the CIH Waiver to the plaintiff and the members of Class B. \nc.  Continue providing services to the plaintiff and the members of Class C through the \nA&D Waiver. \n5.  Award the plaintiff and the classes their costs and attorneys’ fees pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § \n794a, 42 U.S.C. § 12133, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and any and all other applicable statutes. \n6.  Award all other proper relief. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00957-JMS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 06/14/13   Page 19 of 19 PageID #: 19\nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Gavin M. Rose \nGavin M.
