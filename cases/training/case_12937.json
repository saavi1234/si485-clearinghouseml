    "summary": "<p>In this class-action lawsuit filed in Suffolk County Superior Court, a Massachusetts state trial court, several African-American and Hispanic police officers employed throughout Massachusetts alleged that the Massachusetts Human Resources Division engaged in racial discrimination that violated state law in its administration of promotional exams for police sergeants. This case followed a separate (non-class-action) lawsuit, <em>Lopez v. Lawrence </em>(\"Lopez I\"), filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in 2007, where several African-American and Hispanic police officers employed by the Cities of Methuen and Lawrence, Massachusetts brought similar allegations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1994.</p>\r\n<h2>Lopez I:&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>In Lopez I, several African-American and Hispanic police officers sued the Massachusetts Human Resources Division (HRD), the HRD&rsquo;s chief executive in his official capacity and the officers&rsquo; employers (various municipalities and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Represented by private counsel, the officers brought a disparate impact claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, specifically alleging that the HRD-administered promotional exams had an impermissible disparate impact on the promotion of African-American and Hispanic officers by their employers and lacked a job-related purpose. They also brought claims under Massachusetts state law, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief to address the effects of the examinations on past discrimination, in addition to compensatory damages, including backpay, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The state defendants (HRD and its chief executive) moved to dismiss and for summary judgment in the alternative, arguing that Title VII abrogates a state&rsquo;s sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution only when the state functions as an employer. Since the officers were employed by the municipalities and MBTA, rather than the HRD, the state defendants contended that they remained immune from suit. The district court judge denied their motion. On interlocutory appeal, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, holding that the HRD was not the officers&rsquo; employer under Title VII. 588 F.3d 69. Accordingly, the state defendants were dismissed as defendants and, on remand, that case proceeded to go to trial against the municipalities and the MBTA. The District Court determined after a bench trial that the examinations were nevertheless job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity; and that the plaintiffs failed to prove that Boston had refused to adopt an alternative employment practice that would have equally or better served its business needs with less disparate impact. 2014 WL 12978866. The First Circuit affirmed this judgment. 823 F.3d 102. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><br />Lopez II:&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>In response, on February 11, 2009, the officers filed this class action lawsuit on behalf of all African-American and Hispanic police officers who are subject to a Massachusetts civil service law against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the HRD in Suffolk County Superior Court. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the HRD engaged in discrimination by administering an examination for promotion to the position of police sergeant that had an adverse and discriminatory impact on African-American and Hispanic candidates and were not valid predictors of job performance, in violation of several state laws. The officers alleged that their municipal employers relied on their ranking by exam results, causing them to be denied promotional opportunities. As a result, they contended, there is a substantial disparity between the number of African-American and Hispanic police sergeants and entry-level police officers. The case was assigned to Associate Justice Thomas E. Connolly. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In July 2010, the defendants moved to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction on the basis of the state&rsquo;s sovereign immunity and, in the alternative, for failure to state a claim. On January 10, 2011, Judge Connolly granted their motion to dismiss on both grounds, without issuing an opinion. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The officers filed an application for direct appellate review to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, which was granted on June 23, 2011. Writing for the court, Associate Justice Fernande R. V. Duffly reversed the trial court&rsquo;s decision on November 9, 2012. 463 Mass. 696. Justice Duffly found that the state and HRD did not have sovereign immunity from the police officers&rsquo; claims because the statute prohibiting racial discrimination expressly permitted suit against the state and its agencies. She further determined that the officers&rsquo; claim under the statute prohibiting discrimination in terms or conditions by an employer was properly dismissed because neither the state nor the HRD were the officers&rsquo; employers; since the officers&rsquo; employers, the municipalities and MBTA, were not obliged to rely on the examination when making promotional decisions, Judge Duffly held that they were also not liable. She also held that their claim for aiding and abetting a violation of the statute prohibiting unlawful discrimination was correctly dismissed because the officers did not allege that the municipalities who employed police officers committed distinct underlying acts of discrimination. By contrast, Judge Duffly found that the officers sufficiently alleged that the HRD interfered with their exercise of the right to be free from discrimination in employment because this claim could be established by evidence of disparate impact, and did not require a direct employment relationship. Pursuant to her order, the case was remanded to the Suffolk County Superior Court. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 18, 2013, the court denied the motion by defendants to stay the state court proceedings pending resolution of the parallel federal action, and granted plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification for liability purposes only, subject to further consideration if the action reached the stage of remedy. The parties proceeded to engage in discovery for two years, during which the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 7, 2014. The parties subsequently filed a joint motion to stay the state court proceedings pending resolution of the parallel federal action, however, on April 2, 2015. The court granted this motion on April 9, 2015, staying all proceedings until December 1, 2015. Subsequently, however, the court granted several joint motions by the parties to stay the proceedings. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 27, 2018, the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, contending that the plaintiffs&rsquo; discrimination claim was barred under the doctrine of issue preclusion because of the prior decision in the parallel federal action dismissing the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims under Massachusetts state law. Justice Robert N. Tochka of the Suffolk County Superior Court granted their motion on January 7, 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed to the Appeals Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. On July 22, 2020, the panel for the Appeals Court&mdash;composed of Associate Justice Mary T. Sullivan, Associate Justice C. Jeffrey Kinder and Associate Justice Sabita Singh&mdash;reversed, finding that the application of the issue preclusion doctrine was inappropriate with respect to the plaintiffs&rsquo; interference claim. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On remand, the case was reassigned to Associate Justice of the Superior Court Douglas H. Wilkins on August 3, 2021. Before Justice Wilkins, the parties continued to engage in discovery. The case went to a bench trial limited to liability, which was held in June, July and September of 2022. Justice Wilkins issued a lengthy opinion with respect to liability on October 27, 2022 in which he found that the &ldquo;[o]verwhelmingly persuasive evidence prove[d] that HRD interfered with the class members&rsquo; rights to consideration for promotion to police sergeant without regard to race or national origin,'' in violation of Massachusetts law. On November 3, 2022, Justice Wilkins ordered the parties to exchange proposals regarding injunctive relief and damages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 10, 2023, the parties had a final pre-trial conference, with a bench trial scheduled for March 30, 2023. This was subsequently canceled and the parties instead had a settlement conference on March 31, 2023. The parties proposed a settlement that awarded the plaintiffs $40,000,000 to resolve all claims brought in this case, with $50,000 to be allocated for incentive awards for named plaintiffs, $300,000 to pay for any disputes involving class members who were left off from the class list, and potential attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs to be determined at a final approval hearing. In addition, the settlement stated that defendants would create and administer a new exam for police sergeants that is &ldquo;developed consistent with generally accepted validation principles,&rdquo; with the court to determine the level of oversight the plaintiffs would have in the final approval hearing. Any settlement funds left over after distribution would become cy pres funds that the parties would give to selected charitable organizations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 1, 2023, the plaintiffs moved for final approval of the class settlement. In that motion, they also asked the court to let the plaintiffs&rsquo; experts oversee the defendants&rsquo; implementation of the new exam. The defendants filed a memorandum in opposition to the plaintiffs&rsquo; request for oversight on the same day. Later that month, on May 11, the court approved the class action settlement, finding that the agreement was &ldquo;fair, adequate and reasonable for the class.&rdquo; The court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; request for oversight over the exam, holding that it did not have the authority to specify how the defendants should meet their statutory or constitutional obligations. Instead, the court ordered the defendants to provide plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel the following documents: job analysis, proposed weights for components of the exam, instruction to question writers, and instructions to subject matter experts. The court also pointed approvingly to portions of the settlement agreement in which the defendants agreed to or proposed various changes to the exam and procedures for creating the new exam. The court also granted attorneys&rsquo; fees to plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel, resulting in a 20% fee of the fund ($8,000,000), plus $750,000 for litigation costs and fees, for a total award of $8,750,000. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, on July 18, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to enforce the settlement agreement and/or for a temporary injunction. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to provide the required documents and refused to allow class members to sit for the new 2023 exam unless they previously signed up for the canceled 2022 exam. The plaintiffs&rsquo; sought court enforcement of the May 11, 2023 settlement agreement and/or injunctive relief. Because Justice Wilkins had retired, the case was now heard by Justice Rosemary Connolly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 10, 2023, Justice Connolly denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; emergency motion. As to the required documents, the court concluded that the defendants did not have to provide them until they had finished creating them, which they had not yet done. As to the exam itself, the court found that neither the Settlement Agreement nor the subsequent order mentioned allowing class members to sit for the 2023 test as part of the remedy. Therefore, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had not shown that they were likely to succeed on their claim that the defendants had breached the settlement agreement or the order.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Four days later, on August 14, the plaintiffs appealed the denial of their motion to the Massachusetts Appeals Court. Later that month, on August 29, the Massachusetts Appeals Court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; petition because they did not meet their burden of showing that Justice Connolly &ldquo;committed an error of law or abused her discretion when she denied their motion.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As of November 1, 2023, the case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

Douglas H Wilkins, Presiding \nStaff: \n        Christine M Hayes, Assistant Clerk\n03/16/2022 Endorsement on motion to compel (#71.0): discovery responses DENIED  Image\nAfter hearing, the court denies the motion to the extent that it seeks post-2012 data or analysis.  The \ndocuments are not likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence where (1) the issue is not \nintentional discrimination, but actual knowledge of a discriminatory impact and (2) though likely relevant to \nremedy, the first phase trial does not address remedy and there will be a phase 2 only if plaintiffs prevail in \nphase 1.  Where the documents appear to be public documents and obtainable through a public records \nrequest, this ruling does not in any way suggest a ground for denying such a request.  The parties have \nresolved the other previously contested aspects of this motion.

R.  Civ.  P.  23  and \nMass.  General Laws  c.  151B,  challenging  certain  statewide  and Boston police promotional \nexaminations  for sergeant  administered by Defendants  as  having  an  unlawful  disparate  impact \nupon minority  (Black  and Hispanic)  candidates.  The  operative  Third Amended  Complaint \nconcerns  disparate  impact  challenges  to  exams  administered in  2005,  2006,  2007,  2008,  2010, \nand  2012.  This  action was  originally  dismissed,  then  appealed  to  the  Supreme  Judicial  Court, \nwhich  reversed the  dismissal  and  remanded  to  the  Superior Court.  See Lopez  v.  Com.,  463 \nMass.  696  (2012). \nThe  Superior  Court granted Plaintiffs’  motion  for  class  certification  on  Septemb er  16, \n2013,  certifying  a  class  action  on behalf of minority (Black  and Hispanic)  police officers  within \nthe  Commonwealth  of Massachusetts  who  had taken promotional  examinations  for the position \nof police  sergeant  administered  statewide  and in  Boston in 2005,  2006,  2007,  2008,  2010,  and \n2012.  The parties  estimate  that there  are  approximately  600  class  members. \n1\nThe  Superior  Court  conducted  a trial  as  to  liability  (“Phase  I”)  in June  and July  2022,  and \nentered a  ruling  on  liability  in  favor of Plaintiffs  on  October 27,  2022.  The  matter was  scheduled \nfor  a trial with  respect  to  remedy  (‘Phase  II”)  in March  2023. \nThe parties  now  wish to  resolve the  matter amicably without further litigation.  All \nparties  believe  that  a  settlement  of this  matter is  in the  interest  of the public,  the  Commonwealth, \nand  the  class  members. \nTherefore,  the  parties  agree  to  settle this  case  in  its  entirety,  subject to  the  Cour  s \napproval under Rule 23,  as  follows: \n1.  Monetary  Settlement Amount: \na.  Defendants  shall pay  a  gross  amount  of $40,000,000  to  resolve  all  claims  brought. \nin  this  case.  The  amounts  identified in this  paragraph shall be  allocated  as  follows: \ni.  $40,000,000  less  an  award  of attorneys’  fees  and  costs  set forth  in \nParagraph  1(a)(iv),  shall  be paid to  plaintiffs  and  class  members who  have \nnot been promoted to  sergeant  and  submit  claims  as  set  forth in Paragraph \n4(b)  below; \nii.  $50,000  shall be  allocated  for incentive  awards  to be paid  to  the named \nplaintiffs  Spencer Tatum,  Louis  Rosario,  Jr.,  Francisco  Baez,  Gwendolyn \nBrown  and  class  member Abel  Cano  ($10,000  each); \niii.  $300,000  shall be  allocated into  a  fund to  resolve  any disputés  filed by \nclass  members  who  have been  inadvertently  omitted from the  class  list  or \notherwise provide  class  counsel  with  good  cause  to  adjust their pro-rata \nshare  of the  settlement  fund;  and \n! \niv.  At the  final  approval hearing,  Plaintiffs  shall  submit  a motion  for \nattorneys’  fees  and  costs,  the  final  amount  of which  shall  be  determined by \nthe  Court.  : \n2.  Non-Monetary  Settlement Relief: \n| \na.  In  addition  to  the monetary  component of this  Settlement Agreement  set  forth  in \nParagraph  1,  the  parties  agree  that the  Commonwealth will  create  and  administer a new \nexamination  for  the position  of police  sergeant,  based  on  a new job  analysis  that the \nCommonwealth  is  currently performing.  The  terms  of such  relief are  set  forth  in Exhibit  A \nattached  hereto.  The  terms  set  forth in Exhibit A  include  an  agreement by the  Commonwealth  to \nuse  a police promotional  examination that is  developed  consistent with  generally accepted \nvalidation  principles.  The  parties  agree  that the  terms  set  forth  or described  ii n  Exhibit A are \nfully incorporated by reference  into  this  Settlement Agreement.\nb.  As  set forth  in  Exhibit A,  the  Commonwealth  agrees  that the  Court’s  final \napproval  order  shall  contain a provision  stating  that the  Commonwealth will  administer a \n  \npromotional  exam  for police  sergeant  that  is  developed  consistent with  generally  accepted \nvalidation principles. \nCc.  As  set  forth in Exhibit A,  the  parties  agree  that  the  Court shall determine  at the \nfinal  approval  hearing the  issue  of what  oversight,  if any,  Plaintiffs’  experts  will  have  with \nrespect to  the  revised police  sergeant’s  promotional  examination. \n3.  Non-Admission \nIt is  expressly agreed by  the Parties  that this  Settlement Agreement  shall  not  constitute \nany  admission  by  any party regarding  the  claims  and  defenses  asserted in  this  action  and  this \nAgreement may not be used  as  evidence in  any other case,  except with respect to  enforcing  the \nterms  of this  Settlement Agreement. \n' \n1 \n1 \n4.  Allocation  and  Distribution  of Settlement Funds \na.  Upon  the  Court’s  entry  of a final  approval  order  of this  Agreement  and subject to \nparagraph  5  below,  the  Commonwealth  shall pay the  gross  settlement payment  into  a qualified \nsettlement  fund,  which  shall be  administered by  a  Class  Action Administrator agreed  upon by the \nParties.  The Administrator shall  distribute  the  funds  to  class  members in  accordance  with this \nagreement and the  Court’s  final  approval  order,  will bear responsibility for the  tax treatment  of \nall  such payments  (including reporting  to  tax authorities),  and  will  distribute  attorneys’  fees  and \ncosts  as  approved by  the  Court,  as  well  as  undertake  all  other  conduct reasonably related to  the \ndistribution  of Settlement Funds  consistent with this  Agreement. \nb.  Subject to  the parties’  identification  of all  eligible  class  members, class  members \nshall  be paid  shares  from  the  settlement  fund  according to  the  following  formula:  | \n| \nEach  eligible Boston  police  officer  shall receive  a fixed amount that is  estimated to  be \nno  less  than  $60,000, \nEach  eligible police  officer  outside Boston  in  cities  or towns  in which there  were \nminority  shortfalls  during the relevant years  shall receive  a  fixed  amount that is \nestimated to be  no  less  than  $45,000.  Because  there was  less  opportunity  in those \nmunicipalities  compared to  Boston,  this  amount will be  less  than that received by \nBoston police  officers, \nEligible police  officers  in  cities  or towns  with no  minority  shortfalls  during the \nrelevant years  shall  receive  $5,000  only  (for alleged  emotional  distress).\nCc.  The  administrator will place  $300,000  of the  Settlement Fund into  a dispute  fund, \nwhich will be used to  resolve  any claims  that  a  settlement  share  was  improperly  calculated  or \nthat  an  individual  should have been  included  as  a  class  member.  In  the  event that  an individual \ncontacts  class  counsel claiming  that they  have  been  allocated  an improper  share,  or that they \nhave been  excluded  from receiving  a  share,  class  counsel will in good  faith  determine  the  merits \nof such  claim. \nd.  For class  members  in  the  final  category above  who  are receiving  only  the \nminimum  share  of $5,000,  the Administrator  shall  issue  an  IRS  1099  form,  as  this  payment for \nalleged  emotional  distress  damages.  For class  members  in  the  first two  categories,  the \nAdministrator shall  allocate  50%  of their  settlement share  as  back wages,  for which  an  IRS  W-2 \nform  shall  be  issued;  45%  of the  settlement  share  as  prejudgment  interest,  for which  an  IRS \n1099-INT  form shall be  issued;  and  5%  of the  settlement  share  as  alleged  emotional  distress \ndamages,,  for which  an  IRS  1099-MISC  form shall be  issued. \n5.  Appropriations  and  Receipt  of Funding \nThe parties  acknowledge  that the  timing  of the payment  of the  settlement payments \nreferred to  in  Paragraph  4  is  subject to  the  legislative  appropriations  process.  Upon  final \napproval by  the  Court,  the  Commonwealth will request that the  Legislature  make  the \nappropriations  necessary  to  comply with the terms  of this  Agreement. \n6.  Class  Notice  and  Court Approval: \na.  The parties  shall  file  a joint motion with  the  Superior Court Justice  assigned  to \nthis  case  seeking preliminary  approval  and the  issuance  of notice  to  class  members  summarizing \nthe terms  of this  settlement.  The proposed  form  of notice  is  attached hereto  as  Exhibit  B.  The \nnotice  describes the  settlement and provides the time  and place of the final  settlement approval \nhearing  and the  right  of any  class  member to  object to  the  settlement  and  to  attend the  final \nsettlement approval  hearing. \nb.  Class  counsel  shall mail  and  email  this  approved notice  to  all  known)mailing \naddresses  and  electronic  mail  addresses  of the  class  members.  Class  counsel  shall also  make this \nnotice  and  claims  form  available  on  a public website.  In  addition,  the parties further  agree  that \nclass  counsel  shall  be  afforded the  right to  publish the notice  in newspapers circulated within the \nCommonwealth  of Massachusetts, provided  class  counsel provides Defendants  with the names  of \nthese newspapers prior to  seeking to  publish the  notice  therein. \n \nd.  The  parties  shall  not oppose  any of the terms  set forth  in this  Settlement \nAgreement,  including  the  monetary terms  and  distribution  of the  Settlement Fund. \ne.  ~  The parties  will request that the  Court  schedule  a  Final Approval  hearing  in May . \n*  2023. \nf.  In  the  event  that the  Court does  not  approve  the  settlement with  or without \nmodifications,  this  agreement shall  be  void,  and nothing  contained herein may be used  in  any \nmanner for  any purpose. \n7.  Class  Member  Release,  Waiver  of Right  to  Appeal,  Dismissal: \na.  Upon  Court  approval  of this  Settlement Agreement and effectuation  of its  terms, \nin  consideration  of the provisions  of this  agreement and  the  promises  and undertakings  contained \nherein,  Plaintiffs,  thetr  counsel,  and  all  class  members  shall  forever discharge  and release  all \nclaims,  causes  of action,  and  demands  of any kind  against Defendants,  related in  any way to  the \nclaims  that were  asserted in this  action or that  could have been brought in this  action based  on \nthe  same underlying  factual  allegations.  The  class  member  release provided by  class  members \nwill  extend  from  the beginning  of time  to  the time  of final  approval  of this  settlement. \ndb.  Should  the  Court  approve  this  Settlement,  the  Commonwealth waives  any  and  all \nrights  to  appeal  any  orders  or  decisions  from the  Superior Court in  this  action. \nc.  Should  the  Court  approve  this  Settlement,  upon  compliance with the  terms  of the \nSettlement  as  described herein,  this  action  shall be jointly  dismissed with prejudice,  and the \nreleases  and waivers  described herein  shall  become  effective. \n8.  Non-Reversionary Nature  of Agreement  and  Cy Pres \nThis  Settlement is  non-reversionary,  meaning  that all  settlement funds  shall be  distributed \nto  Settlement Class  members,  to  Plaintiffs,  and to  class  counsel,  and no  part  of the  settlement \namount  shall  revert to  Defendants.  After  distribution  of all  settlement  funds  (including  follow-up \nby  class  counsel  to  find  all  class  members  and  encourage  them  to  submit claims),  any residual \nfunds  from uncashed  checks  shall be held  for  120  days  and  may be used to  resolve  any  disputes \nwhich  may  arise.  After the  120  days  have  elapsed,  all  remaining  unclaimed  funds  or  any portion \n’  of the  dispute  fund  that has  not been used  shall be paid  on  a cy-pres  basis  tos  tata \norganizations  to  be  selected by the parties. \n| \n| \n|\nIN  WITNESS WHEREOF,  the Parties  and their  counsel have  executed  this Agreement on the \ndate below their  signatures  or the  signature  of their representatives.

The  Parties  acknowledge  that HRD  is  in the  process  of developing a new police  sergeant \npromotional  examination  in response  to  the  Court’s  order on  liability in this  matter,  issued \nOctober 27,  2022. \n3.  HRD has  agreed to  develop  a new police  sergeant’s  promotional  examination  consistent \nwith Paragraphs  4  through  15  below. \n4,  HRD,  with  the  assistance  of its  testing  consultant,  Talogy,  has  started  a job analysis  of the  . \npolice  sergeant position  and plans  to  revise  the police  sergeant promotional  exam based  on the \nresults  of that job  analysis.\nand tasks \n5.  HRD  has  held  a subject matter  expert  (“SME”)  meeting  to  review the  duties \nperformed  in the position  of a sergeant. \n6.  HRD  has  also  sent an  online job  analysis  survey to  police  departments  across  the  state \nfrom which  it will  collect  duty  and task ratings.  HRD  will  examine the  survey resul  s by the size \n  \nof department. \n7.  HRD  is  also  plarining  to  conduct  a second  statewide  survey  or panel  session    ‘o  address \nabilities  and job  knowledges  critical  to  the  duties performed by  officers  in three  higher police \nranks,  including  sergeant.  The  second  survey  or panel  session will  require  SMEs  and \nincumbents  to  indicate  the  degree  of relevance that the  abilities  and job knowledges  have  for \nperforming the  duties  required  of the police  sergeant role.  The  information  about abilities  and \njob  knowledges  will be  collected using both  SME panel  sessions  and an online  survey. \n8.  HRD  is  reviewing  the job  knowledge  component  of the  exam and,  based  on the  results  of \nthe job  analysis,  is  considering the  following  changes: \na.  Reduce the reading  list:  The job  analysis  portion  that examines  the job knowledge \nareas/sources  will  drive the  inclusion  of the  most relevant  sources.  In addition, \ncandidates  will  be  informed that they  did not have  to  study those  sections within  a  source \nthat  are not relevant  or that  are  of low relevance to  the position.  Finally, HRD  will not \ninclude  sources  that duplicate  material  and  a  single  source will be  identified by  SMEs. \nb.  Organize  items  by  reading  list source  on the job  knowledge  test:  As  is  currently  the \ncase—but was  not the  case prior to  2012—items  will be  grouped  into  sections by reading \nlist source  to  avoid item language  that requires  the  source  to  be  identified  as the  item \nstem  (e.g.,  “According to  [source]  ...”). \nc.  Reduce  the  number  of items:  The  number of items  on the  test will be  reduced to  no  fewer \nthan  70,  with  a  duration  of no  more than 2  hours.  Further reductions in the number  of \nitems without  compromising  the  validity  of the  exam may be possible  when the job \nanalysis is  completed,  and the reading  list is  determined.  .  A  60-65  item test may be \nfeasible when  all  of the  information  is  collected. \n \nd.  Focus  items  on the most job  relevant content:  SMEs  will review test  items  and assist  in \nincluding the most job  relevant content.  Test  items  will  employ  a lower reading level \nthan  those used between 2005  and 2012  and be more  directed. \ne.  Provide  an  examination guide  to  candidates:  HRD will provide  an  examination  guide \nthat  includes  sample  questions  and answers  to  candidates. \n9.  Upon the  completion  and review  of the job  analysis  survey responses  and  SME  panel \nratings,  HRD  will  create  a test plan  to  target the job knowledges  and  abilities that  are  identified \nas  critical to  the position of sergeant. \n10.  The weight to be  accorded to the various  components  of the  examination  shall be based \n  \nupon the job  analysis  and not  a pre-determined  formula  or  allocation. \n11.  As  supported by the job  analysis,  HRD  plans to  include  a  Situational  Judgment Test \n(‘SJT”)  compenent  to  the  exam  and to  revise the  training,  education,  and experience  (“E&E”) \ncomponent  of the  exam,  both  of which will  be  closely  anchored  to  the  key abilities  and  technical . \n‘ \nknowledges  used  on the job. \n12.  HRD  plans  to  use the  SJT  component to  measure  essential  abilities  and application of \ntechnical  knowledges  identified by the job  analysis  by describing  situations  that  require  the \ncandidate  to  analyze  the  information  and make  decisions  by  applying  abilities  (e.g., \ninterpersonal,  accountability,  etc.)  and using judgment  in the  application  of technical  knowledges \ndeveloped through  experience  in similar situations. \n13.  HRD  plans  to redesign the E&E process  to  focus  on the  following score  categories: job \nexperience both internal  to  and  outside  the  employing  department (experience  in the current \nposition  and  temporarily performing  in other roles  such  as  at the next rank),  specialized  training \n(certifications),  and academic  degree  (college  degrees),  The  various  E&E  areas  will be  linked  to \njob  knowledges  and  abilities  that  are  determined  to  be relevant to  the position.  The  ratings \ncollected  from  SMEs  on these  linkages  will  be used to  establish the relevance  of the  E&E \ncomponent  and  the relative relevance  of the  score  categories  to  the position.\n| \n.  :  :  I \n14.  HRD  will not use  a cut  score for the job  knowledge  component of the  exam that would \nprevent the  assessment  of other components  and will use  standardized  scoring  to  ensure  that each \ncomponent receives  the  intended weight  (i.e., effective weights match  the  desired weights).  The \nlack ofa  cut score on any  one exam component will  also  allow  a candidate to  compensate for \n| \n:  aa:  :  |. \nlower performance  in  one  exam  component with higher performance  in  another  exam  component \nand  should  contribute  to  improving  adverse  impact on minority  candidates. \n15.  HRD  is  also  considering banding  options,  to  the  extent  that the  banding  options  are \nconsistent with  Chapter 31  and  any necessary changes  to  the  PAR Rules.  i \n16.  The parties  agree  that the  Court shall  determine  at the  final  approval  hearing the  issue  of \nwhat  oversight,  if any,  Plaintiffs’  experts  will have with respect to  the revised police  sergeant’s \npromotional  examination. \n| \n17.  HRD  reserves  its  right to  revise the  components  of future  statewide police  sergeant’s \npromotional  exams  beyond the  2023  exam,  including by  implementing additional oridifferent \n1 \ncomponents  as  informed by  future validation procedures. \nIN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the Parties  and  their  counsel  have  executed this  Agreement on  the \ndate  below their signatures  or the  signature  of their representatives.

If the  Court \napproves  the  settlement,  Defendants  will pay this  settlement  amount into  a  fund.  A portion  of the \ntotal  settlement  amount to  be  determined by the Court will be allocated to  Class  Counsel  for \nattorneys’  fees  and  costs,  which includes  reimbursement of expenses  of approximately \n$1,000,000  for bringing  and prosecuting  the  lawsuit  and administering the  settlement.  In \naddition,  five plaintiffs  and  class  members  who  assisted  class  counsel  in prosecuting this  action \nwill  receive  an  additional payment  in  the  amount  of $10,000  as  an  incentive payment,  which will \ncompensate them  for  their  efforts  in  supporting  the  case  on behalf of other  class  members  and \nworking  with  counsel  to pursue  it. \nBased upon our analysis  of the  potential  damages  that could  be  obtained in this  case  and \nour  firm’s  broad  experience  litigating  similar  cases,  we believe  that the  settlement is  fair, \nreasonable;  and  adequate.  The  settlement  accounts  for approximately the total  amount of lost \nbase pay  and  overtime  (but not interest)  that our experts  calculated that minority applicants  for \nsergeant across  Massachusetts  collectively  lost  as  a result  of not receiving  the promotion  to \nsergeant  during  the relevant years.  We  estimate  that  there  are  approximately  600  class  members \nin this  case.  Because  it is  not possible  to  determine which  officers  would  have  received \npromotions  had  there  been no  discrimination,  the  law permits  recovery  for the  lostiopportunity  to \nobtain  the position  (not  full  back pay for  each  class  member). \nThe  distribution  of the  funds  will  be  made pursuant to  a  formula to  the following  three \ncategories  of class  members: \nEach  eligible Boston police  officer shall  receive  a  fixed  amount that is  estimated  to  be \nno  less  than  $60,000, \nEach  eligible police  officer  outside  Boston in  cities  or towns  in which  there were \nminority  shortfalls  during the  relevant years  shall receive  a fixed amount that is \nestimated  to  be  no  less  than  $45,000.  Because  there was  less  opportunity  in those \n1\nLICHTEN  &  LISS-RIORDAN,  P.C. \n  \nmunicipalities  compared to  Boston,  this  amount will be  less  than that received  by \nBoston police  officers, \nEligible police  officers  in  cities  or towns  with  no  minority  shortfalls  during  the \nrelevant years  shall receive  $5,000  only  (for  alleged  emotional  distress). \nIn addition,  as  part of the  Settlement Agreement,  the  Commonwealth has  agreed to \ndevelop,  implement,  and  administer a new valid police  sergeant promotional  examination  for \nfuture  exams.  The  Commonwealth’s  proposed plans  for  development are  set forth  in Exhibit A \nto  the  Settlement Agreement.  The  full terms  of the  Settlement Agreement are  available  for your \nreview  at the  following  website:  http://www.PromoExamSettlement.com.  | \nThere will be  a court hearing  on May  10  at  11:00  AM  at the  Suffolk County, Courthouse  ' \nin  Courtroom  304.  The  courthouse is  located  at  3  Pemberton  Square,  Boston,  MA  02108  While’ \nthe  Court has  granted preliminary approval  of this  settlement  and has  authorized this  notice  to  be \nissued,  at this  hearing,  the  Court will  consider whether or  not to  grant final approval to  this \nsettlement.

City of Springfield, 561 F.3d 7, 9–13 (1st Cir.2009) (discussing, in a § 1983 suit against a city \n  defendant only, HRD’s role in the process of hiring of city police officers and the recruitment of minority police \nofficers); Crete v.

City of Boston, 304 F.3d 110, 112–115 (1st Cir.2002) (describing HRD’s role in \nthe appointment of city police officers in a § 1983 suit against a city defendant claiming that an affirmative action \nprogram for police hiring was unconstitutional). \n \n3  The litigants have consistently referred to the city defendants and the MBTA collectively as “municipalities” or \n  “municipal defendants.” We do not address the issue of whether MBTA should be categorized as a municipality or \ndifferently for purposes of describing HRD’s role in its promotions decisions. Whether this categorization is accurate, \nplaintiffs have waived any arguments to the contrary. We do note that the MBTA is the direct employer of the MBTA \npolice under state law. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 161A, § 2 defines the MBTA as “a political subdivision of the \ncommonwealth;” under § 3(d), its powers include the authority “to appoint and employ officers ... and to fix their \ncompensation and conditions of employment.” \n \n4  Section 51 exempts labor service positions in cities with populations of less than one hundred thousand residents \n  from the civil service law, unless the city chooses to make it applicable. However, that exception is not relevant \nhere, since the law also excludes police officers from the definition of a “labor service position.” Mass. Gen. Laws ch. \n31, § 51; see also § 47 (defining “labor service positions”). \n \n5  For the purposes of the promotions process, the state civil service law refers to “municipalities” and does not \n  significantly distinguish between cities and towns. Because plaintiffs have assumed that MBTA’s promotions process \nis identical to the process that municipal police departments follow for promotions, we do not address MBTA’s \npromotions process. Plaintiffs have conflated the two and any arguments to the contrary are waived. \n \n6  For instance, while state law requires municipalities to continue making police officer promotions based upon \n  competitive examinations, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, § 59, municipalities, and not HRD, choose what form the \nexamination will take, whether to make the HRD examination one part of the evaluation process, and whether to \ndevelop and administer an entirely different written examination. Municipalities must also presumably comply with \nstatutorily established hiring and promotion preferences for veterans and other specified groups. See id. § 26 \n(setting out preferences). \n \n7  Plaintiffs have confused the standard for interlocutory appeals of qualified immunity, which does distinguish \n  between appeals grounded in disputed questions of fact and law, with Eleventh Amendment immunity, which \nmakes no such distinction. Indeed, their brief relies upon qualified immunity cases. Compare Rivera–Torres v. Ortiz \nVelez, 341 F.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir.2003) (holding that denials of qualified immunity are immediately appealable only if \n13 \n \n\n \n \nLopez v. Massachusetts, 588 F.3d 69 (2009)   \n107 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 1589, 92 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 43,757 \n \nthey involve a disputed question of law) (citing Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 \n(1985)), with Rosie D. ex rel. John D. v. Swift, 310 F.3d 230, 233 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that “pretrial orders granting \nor denying Eleventh Amendment immunity are immediately appealable” without qualification). \nThe distinction between the standard for an interlocutory appeal of a denial of qualified versus Eleventh \nAmendment immunity exists for good reason. Qualified immunity, a judicially crafted common law doctrine, \nprotects  officials  against  litigation  when  they  have  acted  reasonably  under  the  law,  whereas  Eleventh \nAmendment immunity is a constitutional doctrine that safeguards states’ sovereign dignity and the state treasury. \nSee Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 352, 126 S.Ct. 952, 163 L.Ed.2d 836 (2006). \nA prior decision of this court stated that “[o]rders denying claims of Eleventh Amendment immunity and qualified \nimmunity, to the extent they turn on issues of law, fall within the ambit of this exception, and are thus \nimmediately appealable to this Court.” Asociación De Subscripción Conjunta Del Seguro De Responsabilidad \nObligatorio v. Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.2007). That statement is accurate, but that case neither raised \nnor discussed the issue addressed in P.R. Aqueduct and Sewer Auth., namely whether a fact-dependent issue of \nEleventh Amendment immunity could also be immediately appealed. The language of that previous opinion \ncannot be read to suggest that the standards for interlocutory appeals of Eleventh Amendment and qualified \nimmunity are identical. \n \n8  It is unclear whether P.R. Aqueduct and Sewer Auth. would deprive courts of interlocutory appellate jurisdiction of a \n  denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity where the case “implicates extraordinary factual difficulty.” 506 U.S. at \n147, 113 S.Ct. 684. That issue is not present in our case. \n \n9  It has not held that courts of appeals are prohibited from exercising pendent jurisdiction over related issues in an \n  interlocutory appeal. \n \n10  Unlike the question of whether a denial of immunity is appealable at all, when the distinction between qualified and \n  Eleventh Amendment immunity matters, the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction in interlocutory appeals does \nnot depend on the type of immunity involved. See Morris–Hayes v. Bd. of Educ., 423 F.3d 153, 163–64 (2d Cir.2005). \nOnce a court can hear the interlocutory appeal, pendent jurisdiction facilitates a full resolution of the issues at the \ncrux of the appeal. \n \n11  In Kilburn, the D.C. Circuit recognized that unlike all other circuits, it had previously entertained the possibility that \n  pendent appellate jurisdiction might also exist beyond the circumstances identified in Swint, “when substantial \nconsiderations of fairness or efficiency demand it.” 376 F.3d at 1133–34 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nHowever, the court also noted that in practice, its application of this standard was largely confined to cases where \nthe Swint conditions were present. Id. at 1334. \n \n12  Title VII also applies to employment agencies and labor unions. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e(c)-(d). HRD clearly is neither. \n \n \n14 \n \n\n \n \nLopez v. Massachusetts, 588 F.3d 69 (2009)   \n107 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 1589, 92 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 43,757 \n \n13  The  term  “master-servant,”  while  archaic  and  perhaps  even  offensive  in  modern  usage,  refers  to  the \n  employer-employee relationship. \n \n14  Those  factors  were  “the  hiring  party’s  right  to  control  the  manner  and  means  by  which  the  product  is \n  accomplished[;] ... the skill required; the source of the instrumentalities and tools; the location of the work; the \nduration of the relationship between the parties; whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects \nto the hired party; the extent of the hired party’s discretion over when and how long to work; the method of \npayment; the hired party’s role in hiring and paying assistants; whether the work is part of the regular business of \nthe hiring party; whether the hiring party is in business; the provision of employee benefits; and the tax treatment \nof the hired party.” Reid, 490 U.S. at 751–52, 109 S.Ct. 2166 (internal footnotes omitted). \n \n15  The events at issue in Clackamas occurred before 2000, and the opinion cited to an older, substantially similar \n  version of these guidelines. 538 U.S. at 448–49, 123 S.Ct. 1673 (citing to Section 605, the section replaced by the \nnew § 2–III.) We cite to the current version of these guidelines because the events at issue in this case occurred \nafter they went into effect and reflect the EEOC’s present guidance regarding statutory coverage. These guidelines, \nas the Supreme Court noted in Clackamas, echo the Court’s language in Darden. 538 U.S. at 449, 123 S.Ct. 1673. \n \n16  While Gulino did not expressly invoke the “de facto” employer test, it considered, and rejected, all alternate tests \n  for an “employer,” 460 F.3d at 373–79, and also rejected the notion that the state was an “employer” under the \ncommon law test, id. at 379. Again, we focus on the reasoning of the opinion, not upon the labels attached to the \nanalysis. \n \n17  See Spirt v. Teachers Ins. and Annuity Ass’n, 691 F.2d 1054, 1063 (2d Cir.1982), vacated on other grounds, 463 U.S. \n  1223, 103 S.Ct. 3566, 77 L.Ed.2d 1406 (1983) (adopting a variant on the interference theory on the express \nassumption that Congress intended to define the term “employer” well beyond its general common law definition); \nSibley Mem’l Hosp. v. Wilson, 488 F.2d 1338, 1340–41 (D.C.Cir.1973) (first articulating the interference theory on the \nground that Title VII’s terms should be interpreted very broadly to achieve its non-discriminatory ends). \n \n18  We do not think it helpful to reframe the applicable common law test in terms of whether HRD was acting in a \n  merely “regulatory” capacity and so was not an employer. Still, the reasoning of that line of cases, all rejecting \nemployer status for states, is helpful support. Those cases have held that when state agencies exercised a significant \nrole in the regulation of salaries, hiring, and promotions, yet refrained from vicariously making particular hiring or \nfiring decisions or setting individual salaries, the state was not functioning as an “employer.” See, e.g., Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Comm’n v. Illinois, 69 F.3d 167, 171–72 (7th Cir.1995) (holding that when the state fixed \npublic teachers’ minimum salaries, set the number of days teachers must work, the amount of sick leave and \nsabbatical leave, terms of tenure, and other general factors pertaining to hiring, promotions, and firing, but did not \n“tell[ ] the local school districts whom to hire and fire and how much to pay them,” it was not an “employer”); \nUnited States v. Bd. of Educ., 911 F.2d 882, 891–92 (3d Cir.1990) (holding that no employment relationship existed \nwhen the state regulated teachers, including the dress code, but did not exercise control over teachers’ terms of \nemployment in a non-regulatory capacity); Fields v.

The Eleventh Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution bars State law claims against State officials in Federal court. See Lopez v. State, 588 F.3d \n69, 73 n. 1 (1st Cir.2009) (Lopez ), quoting Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 121, 104 S.Ct. \n900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). \n \n4  For convenience, we refer to the plaintiffs’ second amended complaint as the complaint. \n \n \n5  See G.L. c. 31, § 3 (providing for development of rules to regulate “recruitment, selection, training and employment \n  of persons for civil service positions,” including rules providing for “development of examination procedures”). \n \n6  Although the plaintiffs also allege that, in the municipalities that employ them, “few, if any, minorities have been \n  promoted to the position of sergeant,” they do not specifically allege that there is a significant disparity within such \nmunicipalities between the percentage ratio of African–American and Hispanic police sergeants and their numbers \nin entry-level police officer ranks, on the one hand, and the corresponding percentage ratio of similarly situated \nnonminority police officers on the other. See Commonwealth v. Arriaga, 438 Mass. 556, 565–567 & n. 5, 781 N.E.2d \n1253 (2003) (“Consistent with the majority of jurisdictions, we apply the absolute disparity test to determine \nwhether underrepresentation of a group is substantial”). Cf. Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 1000, \n108 S.Ct. 2777, 101 L.Ed.2d 827 (1988) (prima facie case of discriminatory promotion practices may fail where \n“relevant data base is too small to permit any meaningful statistical analysis”). \n10 \n \n\n \n \nLopez v. Com., 463 Mass. 696 (2012)   \n978 N.E.2d 67, 116 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 850 \n \n \n7  The plaintiffs concede that they are not direct employees of the division under the traditional common-law test. See \n  Maniscalco v. Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., 327 Mass. 211, 212, 97 N.E.2d 639 (1951), quoting Griswold v. \nDirector of the Div. of Employment Sec., 315 Mass. 371, 372–373, 53 N.E.2d 108 (1944) (reiterating common-law \nemployer-employee relationship). \n \n8  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq. (Title VII), addressed in Sibley \n  Memorial Hosp. v. Wilson, 488 F.2d 1338 (D.C.Cir.1973) (Sibley ), is the Federal analogue to G.L. c. 151B. See \nCollege–Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. v. Massachusetts Comm’n Against Discrimination, 400 Mass. 156, 163, 508 N.E.2d \n587 (1987). \n \n9  The indirect employment theory developed in Sibley is commonly referred to as an “interference theory” and is \n  referred to as such by the plaintiffs. See, e.g., Lopez, supra at 89; Association of Mexican–Am. Educators v. State, 231 \nF.3d 572, 580 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) (AMAE ). \n \n10  In Sibley, supra, the matter came before the court on the defendant’s appeal from the sua sponte entry of summary \n  judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The court agreed that the plaintiff’s complaint alleged facts sufficient to support a \nclaim under Title VII, but concluded that “it was not the part of careful adjudication to enter summary judgment sua \nsponte,” and reversed. Id. at 1342–1344. \n \n11  In AMAE, supra, Latino, African–American, and Asian–American educators challenged a Statewide certification \n  regime for California public school teachers, alleging that minority candidates disproportionately received failing \nscores on a test that was a prerequisite for prospective public school teachers and other public school personnel. Id. \nat 578. The defendants appealed from the grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the issue of the \napplicability of Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Id. at 579. The court cited Sibley, supra, with approval \nin holding that California and its credentialing body interfered with the plaintiffs’ employment opportunities with \nlocal school districts. AMAE, supra at 581. The court concluded, in line with Sibley, that a “direct employment \nrelationship is not a prerequisite to Title VII liability.” Id. at 580. \n \n12  “Indeed, the [S]tate is so entangled with the operation of California’s local school districts that individual districts \n  are treated as ‘[S]tate agencies’ for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.” AMAE, supra at 582. \n \n13  See Lopez, supra at 77–78 (nothing in Massachusetts civil service law, G.L. c. 31, mandates that municipalities use \n  results of division’s promotional examination as sole criterion to evaluate merit-based promotions). See also \nBrackett v. Civil Serv. Comm’n, 447 Mass. 233, 255, 850 N.E.2d 533 (2006), quoting G.L. c. 31, § 3 (e ) (nothing in G.L. \nc. 31 “mandates that promotions be made in strict rank order based only on examination results. Rather, the statute \nallows consideration of ‘any combination of factors which fairly test the applicant’s ability to perform the duties of \nthe position as determined by the administrator [of the division]’ ”). \n \n11 \n \n\n \n \nLopez v. Com., 463 Mass. 696 (2012)   \n978 N.E.2d 67, 116 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 850 \n \n14  We noted in Sahli v. Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc., 437 Mass. 696, 700, 774 N.E.2d 1085 (2002), that retaliation claims \n  under G.L. c. 151B, § 4(4), provide a distinct cause of action from interference claims under G.L. c. 151B, § 4(4A), but \nwe did not specifically address the distinction. The § 4(4A) interference claim in that case was premised on alleged \nretaliation by the defendant that consisted of the filing of a lawsuit against the plaintiff. Balancing the constitutional \nright to petition government against the competing statutory right to be free from employment discrimination, we \nconcluded that a lawsuit filed by an employer against an employee that has a legitimate basis in law “does not \nviolate the provisions of either § 4(4) or § 4(4A), absent evidence that the employer’s purpose is other than to stop \nconduct it reasonably believes violates the terms of [its] contract” with the employee. Id. at 705, 774 N.E.2d 1085. \nOur reference to evidence of the employer’s purpose in the Sahli case was specific to the circumstances as alleged in \nthat case, namely the assertion of retaliation or interference based on the filing of a lawsuit. \n \n15  By contrast, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G.L. c. 12, § 11H, makes it unlawful for any person to “interfere by \n  threats, intimidation or coercion” with another’s exercise of his civil rights. So structured, the word “interfere” is \nspecifically defined by the words that follow it; its meaning, and thus the scope of recovery under the civil rights act, \nis significantly narrowed by the requirement that the interference must take the form of either threats, intimidation, \nor coercion. See Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. v. Blake, 417 Mass. 467, 473, 631 N.E.2d 985, cert. \ndenied, 513 U.S. 868, 115 S.Ct. 188, 130 L.Ed.2d 122 (1994). The word “interfere” in G.L. c. 151B, § 4(4A), however, \nis listed as a separate proscribed act, following threats, intimidation, and coercion. \n \n16  As the Appeals Court correctly observed, “When the Supreme Judicial Court first recognized that one could base a c. \n  151B claim on a disparate impact theory, the court did not tether that conclusion to any particular language in the \nstatute.” Porio v. Department of Revenue, 80 Mass.App.Ct. 57, 68, 951 N.E.2d 714 (2011), citing School Comm. of \nBraintree v. Massachusetts Comm’n Against Discrimination, 377 Mass. 424, 428–429, 386 N.E.2d 1251 (1979). It is \nnonetheless apparent from its context that the claim that was the focus of our decision was based on G.L. c. 151B, § \n4(1). \n \n17  Because there is relatively little case law on disparate impact claims in Massachusetts, we look to Title VII for \n  guidance, mindful that Federal interpretations are not binding on this court when construing a State statute. See \nBrown v. F.L. Roberts & Co., 452 Mass. 674, 680, 896 N.E.2d 1279 (2008). See also Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. \nv. Massachusetts Comm’n Against Discrimination, 450 Mass. 327, 337–338, 879 N.E.2d 36 (2008). \n \n18  Two decades after the United States Supreme Court recognized the availability of a disparate impact theory under \n  Title VII in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971) (Griggs ), Congress codified \nthe elements required to establish discrimination based on a claim of disparate impact. See Lewis v. Chicago, 560 \nU.S. 205, 130 S.Ct. 2191, 2197, 176 L.Ed.2d 967 (2010). Such a claim is established if the plaintiff “demonstrates that \na respondent uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, \nreligion, sex, or national origin and the respondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related \nfor the position in question and consistent with business necessity.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i) (2006). \n \n19  Title VII permits “an employer to give and to act upon the results of any professionally developed ability test \n  provided that such test, its administration or action upon the results is not designed, intended or used to \n12 \n \n\n \n \nLopez v. Com., 463 Mass. 696 (2012)   \n978 N.E.2d 67, 116 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 850 \n \ndiscriminate because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(h) (2006). The United States \nSupreme Court has interpreted this language to mean that ability tests must be demonstrated to be a reasonable \nmeasure of job performance. Griggs, supra at 433–436, 91 S.Ct. 849. “[D]iscriminatory tests are impermissible \nunless shown, by professionally acceptable methods, to be ‘predictive of or significantly correlated with important \nelements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being \nevaluated.’ ” Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 431, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975), quoting 29 \nC.F.R. § 1607.4(c). See Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations, 29 C.F.R. § 1607.5(B) (2012) \n(“Evidence of the validity of a test or other selection procedure by a criterion-related validity study should consist of \nempirical data demonstrating that the selection procedure is predictive of or significantly correlated with important \nelements of job performance”). \n \n20  Statistical data, which generally is the source of evidence of disparate impact, will be required at later stages of the \n  proceedings, see Commonwealth v. Arriaga, 438 Mass. 556, 565–567 & n. 5, 781 N.E.2d 1253 (2003), but is not \nrequired at the pleading stage. \n“Standard statistical analysis in discrimination cases generally takes the unprotected group and compares the \ntreatment of that group to the treatment of the protected group to determine whether there is a statistically \nsignificant difference.... Differences, if any, can be measured in terms of absolute numbers, standard deviations or \npercentages.” Tinkham, The Uses and Misuses of Statistical Proof in Age Discrimination Claims, 27 Hofstra Lab. & \nEmployment L.J. 357, 358 (2010). See, e.g., Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 651–653, 109 S.Ct. 2115, \n104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989) (“if the percentage of selected applicants who are nonwhite is not significantly less than the \npercentage of qualified applicants who are nonwhite,” selection mechanism “probably does not operate with a \ndisparate impact on minorities”); Griggs, supra at 430 n. 7, 91 S.Ct. 849 (use of standardized tests by defendant \ncompany “resulted in 58% of whites passing the tests, as compared with only 6% of the blacks”). \n \n21  The division does not suggest that generalized Statewide statistics may not be used to establish a prima facie case of \n  disparate impact. See, e.g., Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 330, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977) (noting \nthat “application process itself might not adequately reflect the actual potential applicant pool, since otherwise \nqualified people might be discouraged from applying because of a self-recognized inability to meet the very \nstandards challenged as being discriminatory”). \n \n22  We reject the division’s argument that under Russell v. Cooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc., 437 Mass. 443, 772 N.E.2d 1054 \n  (2002) (Russell ), and Abramian v. President & Fellows of Harvard College, 432 Mass. 107, 731 N.E.2d 1075 (2000) \n(Abramian ), the plaintiffs’ aiding and abetting claim under § 4(5) necessarily fails because the municipalities are not \nnamed as defendants. In Russell, supra at 458 n. 7, 772 N.E.2d 1054, we held that the conclusion that the principal \noffender did not engage in employment discrimination under § 4(16) necessarily resolved a corresponding aiding \nand abetting claim under § 4(5) against its director of human resources and employee health. Similarly, in Abramian, \nsupra at 122, 731 N.E.2d 1075, we concluded that, because an aiding and abetting claim is necessarily derivative of \nthe underlying discrimination claim, where a new trial was ordered for the discrimination claim, a new trial was also \nrequired for the aiding and abetting claim brought against separate defendants. Although in those cases both the \nalleged principal offender and the alleged aider and abettor were parties to the actions, the cases do not stand for \nthe proposition that a claim of aiding and abetting under § 4(5) necessarily fails where the principal offender is not \nnamed as a defendant. \n13 \n \n\n \n \nLopez v. Com., 463 Mass. 696 (2012)   \n978 N.E.2d 67, 116 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 850 \n \n \n23  An interference claim under § 4(4A) does not require such a specific allegation against a particular employer \n  because a defendant (who is not the plaintiff’s direct employer) may independently commit an act of discrimination \nby “interfering” with the plaintiff’s employment opportunities with that employer, based on statistical data \nsupporting the disparate impact of the defendant’s conduct on all employers within that category of employers. By \ncontrast, an aiding and abetting claim under § 4(5) requires the defendant to act in concert with one or more \nspecific employers to “aid” or “abet” a primary and independent act of discrimination by those employers. \n \n24  Allegations that the division “assisted with, and knowingly contributed to, the discriminatory conduct of the various \n  municipalities” and “knowingly allowed municipalities to administer the ... exam despite its discriminatory impact on \nhiring” are also insufficient to state an aiding and abetting claim under § 4(5). These conclusory assertions of \ndiscriminatory conduct by “various municipalities” fail to allege a particular practice or act by any identified \nmunicipality from which an aiding and abetting claim could derive. \n \n1  As the court correctly notes, ante at 701–702, 978 N.E.2d at 73–74, the Commonwealth is considered a “person” \n  under G.L. c. 151B, § 4(4A), and has thus waived sovereign immunity for purposes of claims under that subsection. \nSee G.L. c. 151B, §§ 1, 4(4A). \n \n2  The American Heritage Dictionary defines “interfere” as “[t]o be or create a hindrance or obstacle” and “[t]o \n  intervene or intrude in the affairs of others; meddle.” “Interfere” is listed as synonymous with “tamper,” which \nmeans “to tinker with rashly or foolishly” and “to engage in improper or secret dealings, as an effort to influence.” \nAmerican Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 913, 1766 (4th ed. 2006). Although on one hand, the words \n“tamper,” “meddle,” and “secret dealings” suggest an element of intent, on the other, the words “[t]o be or create a \nhindrance or obstacle” do not of necessity suggest the same. See id. \n \n3  Other statutes using this series of words have also been interpreted to carry an element of intent. For example, the \n  Fair Housing Act makes it “unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person in the exercise or \nenjoyment of ... any right granted or protected by [§] 3603, 3604, 3605, or 3606 of this title.” 42 U.S.C. § 3617 \n(2006). Consequently, to state a cause of action under this section, a plaintiff must allege (and show) that “the \ndefendants’ conduct was at least partially motivated by intentional discrimination.” South Middlesex Opportunity \nCouncil, Inc. v. Framingham, 752 F.Supp.2d 85, 95 (D.Mass.2010). \n \n4  In Woodason v. Norton Sch. Comm., 25 Mass. Discrimination L. Rep. 62 (2003), the complainant was a public school \n  cafeteria  assistant  who  had  been  terminated  from  her  position,  which  she  claimed  constituted  disability \ndiscrimination  under  G.L.  c.  151B,  §  4(16),  and  interference  under  §  4(4A).  After  a  hearing  officer  of  the \nMassachusetts Commission Against Discrimination found for the complainant on the disability claim and the \nemployer on the interference claim, both parties appealed to the full commission. \n \n14 \n \n\n \n \nLopez v.

In any event, the Eleventh Amendment clearly bars such a claim in federal court \nagainst  the  state  defendants.  “[A]  claim  that  state  officials  violated  state  law  in  carrying  out  their  official \nresponsibilities is a claim against the State that is protected by the Eleventh Amendment....

City of Springfield, 561 F.3d 7, 9–13 (1st Cir.2009) (discussing, in a § 1983 suit against a city \n  defendant only, HRD’s role in the process of hiring of city police officers and the recruitment of minority police \nofficers); Crete v. City of Lowell, 418 F.3d 54, 57–60 (1st Cir.2005) (providing background about HRD’s role in the \nhiring process for city police officers in a § 1983 and state law claim against a city defendant only); Cotter v. City of \nBoston, 323 F.3d 160, 164–66 (1st Cir.2003) (explaining HRD’s role in the promotions process in a § 1983 suit against \ncity and state defendants claiming violations of plaintiff white police officers’ civil rights when the city promoted \nminority police officers); Donahue v. City of Boston, 304 F.3d 110, 112–115 (1st Cir.2002) (describing HRD’s role in \nthe appointment of city police officers in a § 1983 suit against a city defendant claiming that an affirmative action \nprogram for police hiring was unconstitutional). \n \n3  The litigants have consistently referred to the city defendants and the MBTA collectively as “municipalities” or \n  “municipal defendants.” We do not address the issue of whether MBTA should be categorized as a municipality or \ndifferently for purposes of describing HRD’s role in its promotions decisions. Whether this categorization is accurate, \nplaintiffs have waived any arguments to the contrary. We do note that the MBTA is the direct employer of the MBTA \npolice under state law. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 161A, § 2 defines the MBTA as “a political subdivision of the \ncommonwealth;” under § 3(d), its powers include the authority “to appoint and employ officers ... and to fix their \ncompensation and conditions of employment.” \n \n4  Section 51 exempts labor service positions in cities with populations of less than one hundred thousand residents \n  from the civil service law, unless the city chooses to make it applicable. However, that exception is not relevant \nhere, since the law also excludes police officers from the definition of a “labor service position.” Mass. Gen. Laws ch. \n31, § 51; see also § 47 (defining “labor service positions”). \n \n5  For the purposes of the promotions process, the state civil service law refers to “municipalities” and does not \n  significantly distinguish between cities and towns. Because plaintiffs have assumed that MBTA’s promotions process \nis identical to the process that municipal police departments follow for promotions, we do not address MBTA’s \npromotions process. Plaintiffs have conflated the two and any arguments to the contrary are waived. \n \n6  For instance, while state law requires municipalities to continue making police officer promotions based upon \n  competitive examinations, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, § 59, municipalities, and not HRD, choose what form the \nexamination will take, whether to make the HRD examination one part of the evaluation process, and whether to \ndevelop and administer an entirely different written examination. Municipalities must also presumably comply with \nstatutorily established hiring and promotion preferences for veterans and other specified groups. See id. § 26 \n(setting out preferences). \n \n7  Plaintiffs have confused the standard for interlocutory appeals of qualified immunity, which does distinguish \n  between appeals grounded in disputed questions of fact and law, with Eleventh Amendment immunity, which \nmakes no such distinction. Indeed, their brief relies upon qualified immunity cases. Compare Rivera–Torres v. Ortiz \nVelez, 341 F.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir.2003) (holding that denials of qualified immunity are immediately appealable only if \n13 \n \n\n \n \nLopez v. Massachusetts, 588 F.3d 69 (2009)   \n107 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 1589, 92 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 43,757 \n \nthey involve a disputed question of law) (citing Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 \n(1985)), with Rosie D. ex rel. John D. v. Swift, 310 F.3d 230, 233 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that “pretrial orders granting \nor denying Eleventh Amendment immunity are immediately appealable” without qualification). \nThe distinction between the standard for an interlocutory appeal of a denial of qualified versus Eleventh \nAmendment immunity exists for good reason. Qualified immunity, a judicially crafted common law doctrine, \nprotects  officials  against  litigation  when  they  have  acted  reasonably  under  the  law,  whereas  Eleventh \nAmendment immunity is a constitutional doctrine that safeguards states’ sovereign dignity and the state treasury. \nSee Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 352, 126 S.Ct. 952, 163 L.Ed.2d 836 (2006). \nA prior decision of this court stated that “[o]rders denying claims of Eleventh Amendment immunity and qualified \nimmunity, to the extent they turn on issues of law, fall within the ambit of this exception, and are thus \nimmediately appealable to this Court.” Asociación De Subscripción Conjunta Del Seguro De Responsabilidad \nObligatorio v. Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.2007). That statement is accurate, but that case neither raised \nnor discussed the issue addressed in P.R. Aqueduct and Sewer Auth., namely whether a fact-dependent issue of \nEleventh Amendment immunity could also be immediately appealed. The language of that previous opinion \ncannot be read to suggest that the standards for interlocutory appeals of Eleventh Amendment and qualified \nimmunity are identical. \n \n8  It is unclear whether P.R. Aqueduct and Sewer Auth. would deprive courts of interlocutory appellate jurisdiction of a \n  denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity where the case “implicates extraordinary factual difficulty.” 506 U.S. at \n147, 113 S.Ct. 684. That issue is not present in our case. \n \n9  It has not held that courts of appeals are prohibited from exercising pendent jurisdiction over related issues in an \n  interlocutory appeal. \n \n10  Unlike the question of whether a denial of immunity is appealable at all, when the distinction between qualified and \n  Eleventh Amendment immunity matters, the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction in interlocutory appeals does \nnot depend on the type of immunity involved. See Morris–Hayes v. Bd. of Educ., 423 F.3d 153, 163–64 (2d Cir.2005). \nOnce a court can hear the interlocutory appeal, pendent jurisdiction facilitates a full resolution of the issues at the \ncrux of the appeal. \n \n11  In Kilburn, the D.C. Circuit recognized that unlike all other circuits, it had previously entertained the possibility that \n  pendent appellate jurisdiction might also exist beyond the circumstances identified in Swint, “when substantial \nconsiderations of fairness or efficiency demand it.” 376 F.3d at 1133–34 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nHowever, the court also noted that in practice, its application of this standard was largely confined to cases where \nthe Swint conditions were present. Id. at 1334. \n \n12  Title VII also applies to employment agencies and labor unions. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e(c)-(d). HRD clearly is neither. \n \n \n14 \n \n\n \n \nLopez v. Massachusetts, 588 F.3d 69 (2009)   \n107 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 1589, 92 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 43,757 \n \n13  The  term  “master-servant,”  while  archaic  and  perhaps  even  offensive  in  modern  usage,  refers  to  the \n  employer-employee relationship. \n \n14  Those  factors  were  “the  hiring  party’s  right  to  control  the  manner  and  means  by  which  the  product  is \n  accomplished[;] ... the skill required; the source of the instrumentalities and tools; the location of the work; the \nduration of the relationship between the parties; whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects \nto the hired party; the extent of the hired party’s discretion over when and how long to work; the method of \npayment; the hired party’s role in hiring and paying assistants; whether the work is part of the regular business of \nthe hiring party; whether the hiring party is in business; the provision of employee benefits; and the tax treatment \nof the hired party.” Reid, 490 U.S. at 751–52, 109 S.Ct. 2166 (internal footnotes omitted). \n \n15  The events at issue in Clackamas occurred before 2000, and the opinion cited to an older, substantially similar \n  version of these guidelines. 538 U.S. at 448–49, 123 S.Ct. 1673 (citing to Section 605, the section replaced by the \nnew § 2–III.) We cite to the current version of these guidelines because the events at issue in this case occurred \nafter they went into effect and reflect the EEOC’s present guidance regarding statutory coverage. These guidelines, \nas the Supreme Court noted in Clackamas, echo the Court’s language in Darden. 538 U.S. at 449, 123 S.Ct. 1673. \n \n16  While Gulino did not expressly invoke the “de facto” employer test, it considered, and rejected, all alternate tests \n  for an “employer,” 460 F.3d at 373–79, and also rejected the notion that the state was an “employer” under the \ncommon law test, id. at 379. Again, we focus on the reasoning of the opinion, not upon the labels attached to the \nanalysis. \n \n17  See Spirt v. Teachers Ins. and Annuity Ass’n, 691 F.2d 1054, 1063 (2d Cir.1982), vacated on other grounds, 463 U.S. \n  1223, 103 S.Ct. 3566, 77 L.Ed.2d 1406 (1983) (adopting a variant on the interference theory on the express \nassumption that Congress intended to define the term “employer” well beyond its general common law definition); \nSibley Mem’l Hosp. v. Wilson, 488 F.2d 1338, 1340–41 (D.C.Cir.1973) (first articulating the interference theory on the \nground that Title VII’s terms should be interpreted very broadly to achieve its non-discriminatory ends). \n \n18  We do not think it helpful to reframe the applicable common law test in terms of whether HRD was acting in a \n  merely “regulatory” capacity and so was not an employer. Still, the reasoning of that line of cases, all rejecting \nemployer status for states, is helpful support. Those cases have held that when state agencies exercised a significant \nrole in the regulation of salaries, hiring, and promotions, yet refrained from vicariously making particular hiring or \nfiring decisions or setting individual salaries, the state was not functioning as an “employer.” See, e.g., Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Comm’n v. Illinois, 69 F.3d 167, 171–72 (7th Cir.1995) (holding that when the state fixed \npublic teachers’ minimum salaries, set the number of days teachers must work, the amount of sick leave and \nsabbatical leave, terms of tenure, and other general factors pertaining to hiring, promotions, and firing, but did not \n“tell[ ] the local school districts whom to hire and fire and how much to pay them,” it was not an “employer”); \nUnited States v. Bd. of Educ., 911 F.2d 882, 891–92 (3d Cir.1990) (holding that no employment relationship existed \nwhen the state regulated teachers, including the dress code, but did not exercise control over teachers’ terms of \nemployment in a non-regulatory capacity); Fields v.

Rule \n23.0,  as  appearing  in 97  Mass.  App.  Ct.  1017  (2020)  (formerly  known  as rule 1:28, \nas amended by 73 Mass.  App.  Ct.  1001  [2009]),  are primarily directed to the parties \nand,  therefore,  may  not  fully  address  the  facts  of  the  case  or  the  panel's \ndecisional  rationale.  Moreover,  such  decisions  are  not  circulated to  the  entire \ncourt and,  therefore,  represent only the views of the panel that decided the case. \nA  summary  decision  pursuant  to  rule  23.0  or  rule  1:28  issued  after  February  25, \n2008,  may be  cited for  its persuasive value but,  because  of  the  limitations noted \nabove,  not  as binding precedent.  See  Chace  v.  Curran,  71  Mass.  App.  Ct.  258,  260 \nn.4  (2008). \nCOMMONWEALTH  OF  MASSACHUSETTS \nAPPEALS  COURT \n19-P-835 \nSPENCER  TATUM  &  others1 \nvs. \nCOMMONWEALTH  &  another. 2 \nMEMORANDUM  AND  ORDER  PURSUANT  TO  RULE  23.0 \nThis  is  a  disparate  impact  discrimination  case  challenging \ncertain  Statewide  promotional  examinations  created and \nadministered by  the  human  resources  division  (HRD)  of  the \nCommonwealth.  The  plaintiffs  appeal  from  a  judgment  on  the \npleadings  entered  in  the  Superior  Court  in  favor  of  the \ndefendants.  See  Mass .  R .  Ci v .  P .  12  ( c) ,  3 6 5  Mass .  7 5 4  ( 19 7 4 ) . \nWe  reverse  so  much  of  the  judgment  as  dismissed  the  plaintiffs' \ninterference  claims  arising under  G.  L.  c.  151B,  §  4  (4A). \nBackground.  We  recite  only  so  much  of  the  history of  the \ncase  that  is  relevant  to  the  issues  in this  appeal.  In  2007, \n1  Gwendolyn  Brown,  Louis  Rosario  Jr.~  and  Francisco  Baez, \nindividually  and  on  behalf  of  a  class  of  similarly  situated \nindividuals. \n2  Personnel  administrator  of  the  human  resources  division  of  the \nCommonwealth. \n\nthe  plaintiffs  sued  the  Commonwealth  and  HRD  (collectively, \nState  defendants),  as  well  as  their direct  employers  in  the \nUnited  States  District Court  for  the  District of Massachusetts \nunder  both  G.  L.  c.  151B  and  Title VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act. \nof  1964,  as  amended,  42  U.S.C.  §  2000e-2(k) (1) (A)  (i)  (2006) \n(Title  VII).  See  Lopez  vs.  Lawrence,  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.,  No.  07-\n11693  (D.  Mass.  September  5,  2014),  aff'd,  823  F.3d  102  (1st \nCir.  2016),  cert.  denied,  137  S.  Ct.  1088  (2017)  (Lopez  I).  In \nan  appeal  from  an  interlocutory  ruling  in  Lopez  I,  the  Court  of \nAppeals  for  the  First  Circuit  subsequently  ruled  that  the  State \ndefendants  were  not  \"employers\"  within  the  meaning  of  Title  VII, \nand  thus  they were  entitled to ,immunity  under  the  Eleventh \nAmendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  but  that  the \nplaintiffs'  claims  \"against  the  city defendants  and  the  MBTA\" \ncould  still proceed.  Lopez  v.  Massachusetts,  588  F.3d  69,  72 \n(1st  Cir.  2009). \nFollowing  the  assented-to  dismissal,  without  prejudice,  of \ntheir G.  L.  c.  151B  claims  against  the  State  defendants  in Lopez \n, ~,  the  plaintiffs  filed  this  action  in  the  Superior  Court.  The \nfour  named  plaintiffs,  and  all members  of  the  large  class  they \nrepresent,  are  African-American  and  Hispanic  police  officers \nemployed  by  cities  and  towns  that  are  subject  to  the  State  c_ivil \n2 \n\nservice  laws. 3  Each  took  at  least  one  promotional  examination \nfor  the  position of  sergeant  in 2005,  2006,  2007,  2008,  2010, \nand  2012,  for  which  eligibility lists were  established by  HRD. \nAll  either  failed  an  examination  or  were  not  promoted. \nRelying  in part  on  the  2009  First Circuit  decision,  a  judge \nof  the  Superior  Court  dismissed  the  entire  case.  Although  the \nSupreme  Judicial  Court  affirmed most  of  the  judgment,  it \nrejected  the  State  defendants'  sovereign  immunity  claims  and \nallowed  the  plaintiffs'  interference  claim  under  G.  L.  c.  151B, \n§  4  (4A),  to  proceed. 4  See  Lopez  v.  Commonwealth,  463  Mass.  696, \n701-702,  706  (2012)  (noting that  statutory provision  extends \nliability to  all persons,  not  just employers). \nThe  plaintiffs 1  Title VII  claims  against  their employers  in \nLopez  I  eventually proceeded  to  a  bench  trial.  In  a  lengthy, \n3  On  September  18,  2013,  a  judge  certified a  class  consisting  of \nall minority  police  officers  who  took  HRD1s  Statewide \nexamination between  2005  and  2012,  as  to  liability only.  On \nFebruary  3,  2014,  a  judge  allowed  the  motions  of  the  plaintiffs \nto  substitute  Francisco  Baez  for  Pedro  Lopez  as  one  of  the  named \nplaintiffs. \n4  The  court  decided  that  an  interference  claim  could  be \nestablished by  evidence  of  disparate  impact  and  concluded  that \nthe  plaintiffs'  complaint  stated a  plausible  claim  that  HRD1s \nStatewide  examination has  a  disparate  impact  on  African-American \nand  Hispanic  test  takers.  See  Lopez  v.  Commonwealth,  463  Mass. \n696,  710-712  (2012).  The  court  clarified that  in  order  to  state \nan  interference  claim,  the  plaintiffs  did  not  need  to  allege \nthat  the  use  of  HRD's  examination  11led  to  a  disparate  impact  on \npromotions  in  any  particular,  identified,  employing \nmunicipality.\"  Id.  at  712.  The  court  sanctioned  the  use  of \nsignificant  Statewide  statistics to  show  disparate  impact.  See \nid.  at  712-713  & n.21. \n3 \n\nunpublished  decision,  a  Federal  District  Court  judge  found  and \nruled  that  while  the  promotional  examinations  of  the  city of \nBoston  (Boston)  in  2005  and  2008  caused  a  disparate  impact  based \non  race,  a  point  conceded  by  Boston,  Boston  had  established  that \nthe  tests  were  nevertheless  job-related for  the  position  in \nquestion  and  consistent  with  business  necessity;  and  that  the \nplaintiffs  failed  to  prove  that  Boston  had  refused  to  adopt  an \nalternative  employment  practice  that  would  have  equally  or \nbetter  served  its business  needs  with  less  disparate  impact.5 \nSee  Lopez  I,  slip op.  at 37,  46-47.  The  First  Circuit  affirmed \nthe  judgment.  See  Lopez  I,  823  F.3d  at  121-122. \nDiscussion.  The  Superior  Court  judge  ruled  that  the \ndefendants  were  entitled to  judgment  on  the  pleadings  because \nthe  plaintiffs'  discrimination  claim  was  barred under  the \ndoctrine  of  issue  preclusion by  virtue  of  the  disposition  of \nLopez  I.  See  TLT  Constr.  Corp.  v.  A.  Anthony  Tappe  & Assocs., \n48  Mass.  App.  Ct.  1,  4-5  (1999)  (\"doctrine  of  issue  preclusion \nprevents  relitigation of  an  issue  determined  in an  earlier \naction  where  the  same  issue  arises  in a  later action,  based  on  a \n5  With  respect  to  all other  employers,  the  District  Court  judge \nfound  that due  to  the  small  sample  sizes,  the  plaintiffs' \nstatistical evidence  did  not  establish  that  the  use  of  the \nchallenged promotional  exams  had  any  adverse  impact  on  African \nAmerican  and  Hispanic  test  takers.  The  judge  rejected  the \nplaintiffs'  attempts  to  aggregate  the  test  data  across  the \nemploying  municipalities  and  across  exam  years  in particular \njurisdictions. \n4 \n\ndifferent  claim,  between  the  same  parties  or  their privies\" \n(quotation  omitted]). \nAn  issue  is  precluded  from  being  relitigated  in a \nsubsequent  action  if  (1)  there  was  a  final  judgment  on  the \nmerits  in  the  prior  adjudication;  (2)  the  party against  whom \n_preclusion  is  asserted was  a  party  (or  in privity with  a  party) \nto  the  prior adjudication;  and  (3)  the  issue  in  the  prior \nadjudication was  identical  to  the  issue  in  the  current \nadjudication  and  was  essential  to  the  earlier  judgment.  See \nKobrin  v.  Board  of Registration  in Med.,  444  Mass.  837,  843-844 \n(2005).  The  issue must  have  been  actually  litigated in  the \nprior  action.  Id.  at  844.  We  review  the  judge's  decision \nallowing  judgment  on  the  pleadings  de  novo.  See  UBS  Fin. \nServs.,  Inc.  v.  Aliberti,  483  Mass.  396,  405  (2019). \nAlthough  there  is  no  dispute  that  Lopez  I  concluded  with  a \nfinal  judgment  on  the  merits,  none  of  the  other elements  of \nissue  preclusion were  met.  The  defendants  failed  to  establish \nthat  the  parties  in  the  two  litigations  were  the  same.  While \nthree  of  the  named  plaintiffs  in  the  present  action were  also \nnamed  plaintiffs  in Lopez  I,  Francisco  Baez  was  not  a  party  in \nthe  prior  action.  Moreover,  Lopez  was  no  longer  a  named \nplaintiff  in this  action by  the  time  the  defendants  moved  for \njudgment  on  the  pleadings. \n5 \n\nAs  for  privity,  the  question  turns  on  \"the  nature  of  the \nnonparty's  interest,  whether  that  interest  was  adequately \nrepresented  by  a  party  to  the  prior  litigation,  and  whether \nbinding  the  nonparty  to  the  judgment  is  consistent  with  due \nprocess  and  common-law  principles  of  fairness.\"  DeGiacomo  v. \nQuincy,  476  Mass.  38,  43-44  (2016).  Because  the  District  Court \njudge  had  denied  the  plaintiffs'  request  for  class  certification \nin  Lopez  I,  Baez  and  the  class  of minority  officers  who  took  the \nStatewide  examination  between  2005  and  2012  were  not  officially \nrepresented by  anyone  in  that  case. 6  See  Smith  v.  Bayer  Corp., \n564  U.S.  299,  315  (2011)  (\"[nJeither  a  proposed  class  action  nor \na  rejected  class  action may  bind  nonparties\");  Massachusetts \nProp.  Ins.  Underwriting  Ass'n v.  Norrington,  395  Mass.  751,  754 \n(1985)  (\"[I]t  creates  no  privity between  two  parties  that,  as \nlitigants  in  two  different  suits,  they happen  to  be  interested \nin proving  or  disproving  the  same  facts\"  [quotation  omitted]). \nMoreover,  the  plaintiffs  in  the  present  action,  who  were \nemployed  in municipalities  other  than  Boston,  did  not  have  a \nfull  and  fair  opportunity  to  litigate  their  disparate  impact \nclaim against  the  State  defendants  in  Lopez  I. \n6  As  the  plaintiffs  concede,  the  claims  of  a  \"few\"  individuals \nwho  took  the  2005  and  2008  Boston  examinations  are  precluded by \nLopez  I. \n6 \n\nThe  defendants  also  failed  to  satisfy the  identicality \nelement  of  issue preclusion.  See  DeGiacomo,  476  Mass.  at  42 \n(issue  in prior  adjudication must  be  \"identical  to  the  issue  in \nthe  current  adjudication,  .  essential  to  the  earlier \njudgment,  and  ... actually litigated  in  the  prior  action\" \n[quotation  omitted}).  In  Lopez  I,  the  District  Court  judge  and \nthe  Federal  Circuit  upheld  the  validity of  only  two  tests  given \nin  Boston  in  2005  and  2008.  These  tests,  found  to be  \"minimally \nvalid,\"  differed,  in  fundamental  respects,  from  the  general \nStatewide  examination  at  issue  in  the  present  action. 7  Neither \nthe  validity  of  the  unmodified  Statewide  HRD  examinations  in \n2005  and  2008  nor  the  validity of  the  other  Statewide  HRD \nexaminations  taken  by  the  plaintiffs  in  the  present  action  was \nactually  litigated,  and  essential  to  the  judgment,  in  the  prior \nadjudication.  See  Smith  v.  Boston,  267  F.  Supp.  3d  325,  337  & \nn.3  (D.  Mass.  2017).  Contrast  TLT  Constr.  Corp.,  48  Mass.  App. \nCt.  at  7.  For  all  these  reasons,  the  application  of  issue \npreclusion  was  inappropriate. 8  Contrast Alba  v.  Raytheon  Co., \n441  Mass.  836,  841-842  (2004). \n7  Boston  supplemented  the  HRD's  2005  and  2008  tests  with  Boston \nspecific questions.  See  Lopez  I,  823  F.3~  at  109  n.4.  Boston \nalso  used  specific methods  and  approaches  to  improve  the \nvalidity of  the  tests.  In  contrast,  virtually all  the  employers \ninvolved  in  this  case  used  HRD's  unmodified  examination.  See \nLopez,  463  Mass.  at  699. \n8  In  a  joint motion  to  stay  the  Superior  Court  action  pending \nfinal  resolution  of  Lopez  I,  the  parties  stated  that  such  stay \n7 \n\nConclusion.  So  much  of  the  judgment  entered  January  14, \n2019,  as  dismissed  count  I  of  the  plaintiffs'  third amended \ncomplaint  stating  claims  for  interference  arising under  G.  L. \nc.  151B,  §  4  {4A),  is  reversed.  In  all  other  respects,  the \njudgment  is  affirmed.  The  case  is  remanded  to  the  Superior \nCourt  for  further  proceedings  consistent  with  this memorandum \nand  order. \nSo  ordered. \nBy  the  Court  (Sullivan, \nKinder  & Singh,  JJ.9), \nEntered:  July  22,  2020. \nwould  be  warranted because  \"the  sergeants  promotional  exam  at \nissue  in  the  state  action  is  the  same  test that  is  at  issue  in \nthe  federal  action,\"  and  because  the  ''plaintiffs  in  the  state \naction  are  the  plaintiffs  in  the  federal  action.\"  On  appeal, \nthe  defendants  argue  that  the  plaintiffs  should be  judicially \nestopped  from  disputing  identicality of parties  and  issues.  The \ndecision  to  apply  the  equitable  doctrine  of  judicial  estoppal  in \na  particular  case  rests  in  the  sound  discretion  of  a  motion \njudge.  See  Otis  v.  Arbella  Mut.  Ins.  Co.,  443  Mass.  634,  640 \n(2005).  Absent  a  discretionary  ruling  to  review,  we  decline  to \nreach  the  defendants'  judicial  estoppel  arguments,  which  are \nraised  for  the  first  time  on  appeal.  See  Cariglia  v.  Bar \nCounsel,  442  Mass.  372,  379  (2004). \n9  The  panelists  are  listed in  order  of  seniority. \n8 ",

Yet,  the \n,  I \n|  Commonwealth  of Massachusetts  through  the  Personnel  Administrator,  Human  Resources \n1  Ll  . \n|  Division  (“HARD”)  regularly  administered  written  exarns,  knowing that  its  testing format had  an \nunneces:ary,  plain  and  obvious  adverse  impact  upon  Blacks  and  Hispanics,  compared  to  White \n.  candidates.  To  challenge  HRD’s  format,  a  class  of Black and  Hispanic  police  officers  (some \nnow  reti-ed)  filed  this  case  in  2009,  alleging  racial  and  national  origin  discrimination  in \n‘  employrient  (G.L.  c.  151B,  §  4)  in  the  police  sergeant  promotional  examinations  administered \nby  HRD  for the  years  2005,  2006,  2007,  2008,  2010,  and  2012. \n““he  court  conducted  a  bench  trial  in  phase  I  of this  case,  limited  to  liability.  It heard \n| \n,  testimory  from  live  witnesses  and  received  over  300  exhibits  on  June  26,  27,  28  and  29  and  on \n|  1} \n|  July  25, 26,  27  and  28,  2022.  It  heard  arguments  on  July  29,  2022,  and  September 30,  2022.  It \nreceivec  written  post-trial  briefs  on  September  15,  2022.\nThe  evidence  is  very  clear.  It defeats  any justification  for HRD’s  heavy  reliance  upon \nbiased  exams  to  identify  the  best candidates  for promotiotno   sergeant.  Moreover,  HRD  knew  of \n\\clearly  sttperior assessment methods,  but continued  to  use  the  same,  unnecessarily  discriminatory \nformat  aiyway.  The  massive  amount  of evidence  proving  the  known  and  unjustified  disparate \n‘impact  oS HRD’s  format  leaves  no  doubt  in  thisc ourts  mind  that the  Commonwealth  has \n‘interfere  with  the  plaintiffs’  rights  to  consideration for  promotion  to  police  sergeant without \n‘bias  due  to  race  or  national  origin.  G.L.  c.  151B,  §  4(4A).  The  court will  therefore  conduct \nPhase  II  9f this  trial,  in which  it will  determine  a  remedy.  The  remedy  will  provide  relief to the \n‘plaintiff  slass,  which  must  be  commensurate  with  the  deep-seated  illegality  in  the  testing  format \n.that  HRI)  used,  at  least for the  2005,  2006,  2007,  2008,  2010,  and  2012  exams. \n:  Ii  fashioning  a  remedy,  the  court  realizes  that  candidates  and  appointing  authorities \n.telied  upon  and  participated  in  HRD’s process  in  good  faith,  although  some  agencies  did  seek  a \nbetter way.  The  court  in  no  way  faults  those  candidates  and  appointing  authorities.  Least  of all \n_  does  the  court  cast  doubt  on  the  qualifications  of the  successful  candidates.  HRD’s  violation \n_involvec  selection  among  qualified  candidates,  all  of whom  abided  by  HRD’s  rules.  No  party \n|  has  suggested  a  remedy  that  would  affect  any  existing  appointments. \nPRIOR PROCEEDINGS \nThis  case  travelled  a  long  road  to  get  to  trial.  tn  2007,  some  of the  plaintiffs  sued  the \nCommo  iwealth,  HRD  and  their  employing  municipalities  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for \n-  the  District  of Massachusetts.  Lopez  v.  City  of Lawrence,  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  No.  07-11693,  2014 \n:  WL  12978866  (D.  Mass.  September  5,  2014),  aff'd  823  F.3d  102  (1st  Cir.  2016),  cert.  denied, \n137  S.C.  1088  (2017)  (“Lopez”).  In  an  interlocutory  appeal,  the  First  Circuit held  that the  state \n1 \n'  defenda its  were  not  “employers”  within  the  meaning  of Title  VII  and  were  therefore  entitled  to\n| \n| \n'  :  |  re \nimmunit,  under the  Eleventh  Amendment to  the  United)  States  Constitution.”  Lopez v. \n.  ' \n-Massachusetts,  588 F.3d  69,  72  (Ist  Cir.  2009).  The  plaintiffs  dismissed  their  state  law  claims \niagainst tie  state  defendants  under  G.L.  c.  151B without prejudice  and  refiled  them  in  this  court. \nThis  court  dismissed  the  entire  case,  relying  in  part  on  the  2009  First  Circuit  decision. \n‘The  plaintiffs  appealed.  The  Supreme  Judicial  Court  affirmed  dismissal  of several  claims,  but \n‘rejected  -he  defendants’  sovereign  immunity  claims  and  held  that the  complaint  stated  a  claim \n‘upon  which  relief could  be  granted  on  a theory  of interference  with  protected  rights  under  G.L.  c. \n151B,  §  4(4A).  Lopez v.  Commonwealth,  463  Mass.  696,  701-702,  706-712  (2012)  (“Lopez \nIt”).  On  remand,  on  September  16,  2013,  this  court  (Fabricant,  J.)  certified  the  class,  finding  that \n‘the case  “presents  questions  of both  law  and  fact  that  are  indisputably  common  to  all  members  of \nthe  proposed  class,  including  the  legal  questions  of what  exactly  plaintiffs  must  prove  to  show \n;  discriminatory  impact  and  harm,  and  the  factual  questions  of whether the  test  had  a \n|  discriminatory  impact  in  each  of the  years  alleged.” \n|  Meanwhile,  the  federal  case  against the  employers  went to  trial. The  Federal  District \n‘Court ju  ige,  sitting  without a jury,  found  that,  while  the  Boston  promotional  examinations \n,  caused  a  disparate  impact based  on  race  in  2005  and  2008,  the tests  were  nevertheless job-related \n;  and  consistent  with  business  necessity,  and  the  plaintiffs  failed  to  prove  that  Boston  had  refused \nto  adopt an  alternative  with  less  disparate  impact.  The  First  Circuit  affirmed  in Lopez I. \nOn  June  27,  2018,  Defendants  filed  their  Motion  for  Judgment  on  the  Pleadings,  arguing \nissue preclusion  based  upon  the  First  Circuit’s  decision  in Lopez I.  On  January  7,  2019,  the \nSuperior  Court  (Tochka,  J.)  allowed  the  Motion  and  dismissed  the  Third  Amended  Complaint. \nThe  plai  itiffs  were  again  successful  on  appeal,  this  time  from  a judgment  entered  on  January  14, \n'2019.  In Tatum  v.  Commonwealth,  98  Mass.  App. Ct,  1105,  2020  WL  4200865  at  *2-*3  (2020) \n3\n(Rule  23  0  order),  the  Appeals  Court held  that the  plaintiffs  failed  to  establish  identity  of the \nparties,  privity  (because  the  federal  district  court  deniedjclass  certification)  and  adjudication  of \n‘ \n‘identical  issues.  Upon  remand,  the  case  was  specially ‘assigned  to  the  undersigned  for trial. \n  \n|  FINDINGS  OF  FACT \nThe  Plaintiffs  are  a  class  of current  or  former police  officers  who  took  a  police  sergeant \n‘promoticnal  exam  created  and  administered  by  the  Commonwealth  of Massachusetts  Human \n|  Resourets  Division  (“HRD”)  in  2005,  2006,  2007,  2008,  2010,  or 2012.  The  Plaintiffs  include \ncurrent  and  former  officers  for the  cities  of Brockton,  Lawrence,  Methuen,  Lowell,  Springfield, \n_Worcest:r,  Boston,  and  other cities  and  towns  throughout  the  Commonwealth  of Massachusetts, \n‘as  well  as  the  Massachusetts  Bay  Transportation  Authority  (“MBTA”).  Each  named  and  class \nPlaintiff is  either Black  or  Hispanic.  The  Plaintiffs  were  either not  promoted  to  sergeant  or \n!  I \n.  experienced  a  significant  delay  in  such  promotion  based  on  their scores  on  HRD’s  examinations. \n;  The  court  finds  the  following  facts  by  a preponderance  of the  evidence  it  finds  credible: \n‘I.  |  The  Tests  and  Promotional  Lists \n1.  HRD  developed  and  administered  all  of the  examinations  at  issue  in  this  action \n(the  2005,  2006,  2007,  2008,  2010,  and  2012  exams). The  exams  were  substantially  the  same  in \nformat  aad  approach,  though  the  specific  questions  were  different. \n2.  The  sergeant’s  promotional  examination  in  2005  through  2012  consisted  of 80 \nmultiple-choice  questions.  For  the  same  years,  HRD  simply  added  20  questions  for the \nlieutenant’s  exam,  and  20  more  questions  for  the  captains.  The  higher  rank  exams  thus  included \n1 \nall  of the  questions  on  the  sergeant’s  exam. \n11  \ni  2.  The  written  examination’s  multiple-choice  questions  were  all  taken  (sometimes \nverbatin.)  from  police-related  textbooks.  This  component has  been  in  effect  for at  least  50  years.\n|  |  ! \n| \n4  The  educational  and  experience  (“E&Ej’))component  nominally  accounts  for  20% \nof a  candidate's  overall  score.  It  is  essentially  the  same  today  as  it was  50  years  ago. \n|  .  !  I \nI  5  The  exams  generated  results  that were largely  reproducible  (“reliable”).  HRD’s \nf \nlexpert, Cr.  Silva,  calculated  the  reliability  of the  exams  using  “Cronbach’s  alpha”,  which  took \nthe  avera ge  of all  split halves  of each  respective  exam.  He  found  that  the  lowest  reliability  of \n  \nany  exani  was  .71  and  the  highest  was  .84.  The  court  concludes  that  all  of the  exams  had  good \nVo  ae \nifeliabilit.  \\ \n6  Based  on  the  exams,  HRD  created  lists  of candidates,  ranked  by  order  of their \nscores,  for use  by  appointing  authority.  Each  appointing  authority  used  the  list to  promote \n‘candidat:s  from  within  the  ranks  of that  municipality’s  police  force.  Police  officers  from  each \n\\  ‘participa ting  municipality  for  any  of the  exams  at  issue  competed  only  against the  other  officers \n1  |  | \n|from  the. r  department  for  spots  on  the  eligibility  list  for their  municipality.  For  instance,  under \n| \n‘no  circurastances  can a  police  officer from  Chelsea  be  promoted  to  sergeant  in  the  Quincy  police \ndepartment. \n7.  Each  of the  examinations  at  issue  in  this  case  contained  different  questions,  had \ndifferent  municipalities  participating,  and  with  the  exception  of repeat test takers,  had  different \ncandidat 3s  taking  the  examinations.  HRD  issued  different  eligibility  lists  for  each  participating \nmunicipality  for  each  of exams  at  issue  (i.e.,  the  2005,  2006,  2007,  2008,  2010,  and  2012 \nstatewid:;  exams,  and  the  2005  and  2008  Boston  exams). \n'\nTest Development \n8.  The  outlines  used  for the  2005,  2006,  2007,  and  2008  statewide  sergeant’s  exams \nwere  basud  on  the  knowledge,  skills  and  abilities  (“KSAs”)  and job  tasks  identified  as  important \nt \nto  the jot  of sergeant  in  the  Validation  Report  for  the  1991  Police  Promotional  Selections \nProcedur 2s  dated  October  1,  1991  (“1991  Validation  Report”)  and  the  2000  Morris  &  McDaniel \nJob  Anal ysis  Report.  There  were  some  major  shortcomings  in  HRD’s  use of these  Reports,  as \ndiscussec.  below. \n9  The  outlines  used  for the  2005,  2006,  2007,  and  2008  statewide  exams  included \nKSAs  in  the  following  categories  for  sergeant:  Law/MGL,  Supervision,  Community  Policing, \nand  Polit e  Functions. \n1).  Guy  Paris,  who  began  working  in  test  development  for  HRD  around  1990,  was \nprimarily  responsible  for writing  test  items,  or  multiple-choice  questions,  for  the  2005,  2006, \n12007,  an  1  2008  statewide  exams. \n11.  To  write  questions  for  those  statewide  exams,  Mr.  Paris  consulted  an  outline that \nidentified!  the  competency  areas  by  category  that were  important  for  the job  of sergeant.  The \noutline  I‘sted  the  number  of questions  to  be  written  for  each  competency,  and  incorporated  and \nlinked  these  questions  to  the  source  material  on  the  reading  list  for  each  respective  exam. \n'  12.  Mr.  Paris  made  sure  that the  reading  lists  for  the  2005,  2006,  2007,  and  2008 \nstatewid =  exams  listed  the  most  current  versions  of the  sources  as  of the  reading  list  publication \ndate. \n1 \nt.   13.  In  February,  2005,  prior to  administering  of the  2006  exam,  HRD  surveyed  170 \n|  commut ity  police  chiefs  about the  proposed  reading  list.  The  police  chiefs  rated  the  use  of \n|  particul: r  sources  and  recommended  other  sources. \ni \n6\n|  1 \n:  Lek.  There  were  80  multiple-choice  questions  on  the  2005,  2006,  2007,  and  2008 \n1 \nstatewide  exams,  but  Paris  wrote  many  more  than  80  questions  so  that  subject  matter  experts \n (  “SMEs”)  could  review the  potential  questions  and  select the  most  appropriate  questions.  The \niuse  of SMEs  is  a  best  practice  in  developing  the written  portion  of a  police  promotional  exam. \n!  13.  For those  statewide  exams,  HRD  retained  two  to  four  SMEs,  who  were typically \npolice  chiefs,  to  review  the  potential  questions.  For  instance,  Robert  Champagne,  the  former \nPolice  Cltief  for the  City  of Peabody,  served  as  one  of  the  SMEs  from  2005  to  2012.  HRD  rarely \nused  mote  than  three  SMEs  and,  in  most  cases, appears  to  have  used  only  two  SMEs,  both  of \nwhom  were  police  chiefs,  to  review  reading  lists  and  examination  questions.  With  so  few  SMEs \nand  give  the  deficiencies  identified  below,  the  court  gives  only  modest  weight to  the  SME \n\\process  i  1  assessing  the  validity  of  the  exams  for  statewide  application  or use  in  Boston. \n15.  After  Mr.  Paris  drafted  questions  for the  2005,  2006,  2007,  and  2008  statewide \nexams,  h:  conducted  meetings  in  which  the  SMEs  reviewed  the  potential  questions  and  rated \n‘them  for  suitability  to  each  rank,  difficulty,  readability,  and  recommended  use.  The  SMEs  also \nreviewed  them  for content,  consistency,  applicability,  and  practicality. \n]  7.  An  HRD  consultant,  E.B.  Jacobs  also  reviewed  the  potential  questions  for the \n2007  an¢  2008  statewide  exams  for  cultural  bias.  It  revised  some  questions  and  recommended \n‘replacing  some  questions. \n13.  In  the  summer  of 2009,  as  part  of a  mini job  analysis  for  the  police  promotional \nexam,  which  included  the  sergeant’s  exam,  HRD’s  manager  responsible  for the  2010  and  2012 \nlexams,  Lauren  Fitzgibbons,  met with  SMEs  to  review  the  reading  list  and  the  exam  outline. \n|  1).  | Those  SMEs  recommended  that the  criminal  law  and  constitutional  law  guides \nfrom  Attorney  Rogers  of Commonwealth  Police  Services,  Inc.  be  used  in  place of  the  criminal \n7\nlaw  and  constitutional  law  guides  that  had  been  listed  on  the  reading  lists  in  previous  years.  Ms. \nFitzgibbons  also  provided  the  SMEs’  comments  about.  the  reading  list  and  the  outline  to  E.B. \n| \n[Jacobs  fcr use  in  writing  the  questions  for  the  2009  statewide  exam. \n2).  In  2009,  Ms.  Fitzgibbons  also  held  meetings  with  the  SMEs  to  review  proposed  . \n| \n‘questions  for use  on  the  2009  statewide  exam. \n  \n21.  Based  on  SME  input,  Ms.  Fitzgibbons  revised  the  reading  lists  for the  2010  and \n[20.2  statewide  exams  to  include  Massachusetts  Criminal  Law  and  Massachusetts  Criminal \nProcedure  by  Attorney  Rogers. \n22,  E.B.  Jacobs,  created  the  outlines  for  the  2010  and  2012  statewide  exams,  which \n-included  KSAs  in  the  following  categories  for sergeant:  Law/MGL,  Police  Functions, \nConmariy  Policing,  and  Supervision. \n|  23.  Through  these  and  other  steps,  HRD kept  the  reading  lists  and  resulting  exams \nicurrent.  Within  the  constraints  of a written  multiple  choice  test  and  limited  E&E  component, \n‘HRD’s  exam  development process  was  comprehensive  and  conscientious. \n24.  The  court  rejects  the  inference  that these  test  development  processes,  by \nthemselves,  “ensured  that those  exams were  job  related”  (Def.  Prop.  Findings  VII).  Even  apart \nfrom  the  inability  of a  written  multiple-choice  exam  to  predict  good job  performance  as  a \nsergeant,  a  good  process  may  be  a  necessary  component  of job-related  testing,  but  it  is  not \nsufficien:,  as  even  a  brief summary  will  show.  For  instance,  . \na)  The  questions  on  the  exam  largely  test  for  rote.  memorization  of facts  and  passages  taken \n1  directly  from  textbooks  that  candidates  are  asked  to  study.  The  1991  Validation Report \naad  2000  study  did  not  identify  test-taking  skills  and  lack  of test-related  anxiety  as job- \nrelated.\nLi \nb)  HRD  also  had  candidates  complete  a  computerized form  E&E worksheet,  which  assigned \ncindidates  certain  points  based  on  certain  educational  criteria  (discussed  fully  below). \n   c)  HRD  gave  80%  weight to  a  candidate’s  scores  on  the  multiple-choice  exam  and  20% \n  \nweight to  the  E&E  component.  No  credible  study  validated  these  weights. \nd)  For  each  exam,  HRD  set  a  passing  score  for the  multiple-choice  test.  In  all  but one  of the \n4 \nchallenged  exams,  HRD  set  the  passing  score  at  70.  It  did  not  rely  on  any  accepted \nscientific  criteria  for  establishing the  passing  score  for  its  exams. \ne)  Once  HRD  tabulated  exam  scores,  it  created  a  promotional  eligibility  list  for  each \ndupartment  that participated  in  the  exam.  It  did  so  in  rank  order,  according  to  scores \nrcunded  to  the  nearest whole  number.  No  credible  study  showed  that  single-point  * \ndifferences  in  scores  reflected  any  significant  difference  in job  qualifications. \n25,  At  the time  it  administered  the  exams  in  question  — and  for  a  long  time  before  that \n  \n~ HRD  kniew  that police  departments throughout the  Commonwealth  generally  promote \ncandidates  on  the  eligibility  list  in  rank  order  fashion. \n20,  A  one-point  difference  in  exam  score can  make  the  difference  between  promotion \nand  being:  passed  over.  It  can  also  cause  denial  or delay  of promotion.  It  can  also  make the \nLifferenc  between  being  considered  for promotion  and  excluded  from  consideration.  HRD \nknew this  when  it  administered  the  tests  at  issue  in  this,case. \n27.  The  court now  turns  to  a  more  detailed  discussion  of HRD’s  testing  and  ranking \nformat,  roughly  following  the  same  order that  HRD  uséd  in  administering  that  format. \n1 \nJ 1 \n|\n| \nKnowledge,  Skills,  and Abilities  (“KSAs”) \n23,  A  valid  exam  targets  and  measures  the  important  KSAs  needed  effectively  to. \n‘perform  the  position  at  issue,  and  then  assesses  at  least  a  representative  sample  of the  most \n‘importan:  skills. \n2).  Police  sergeants  are  first-level  supervisors,  with  direct responsibility  for \nsupervisaig   patrol  officers  on  a  day-to-day  basis.  They  are  responsible  for  responding  as  needed \nto  routine  calls  and  must  respond  to  all  serious incidents  (e.g.,  aggravated  assaults,  homicides, \nShootings,  sexual  assaults,  community  disorders  involving  racially-motivated  incidents,  armed \nrobberies,  and  injured  officers). \n3.’  ‘Chief among the  essential  skills  and  abilities  for  this  position  are: \n.  Leadership  skills; \n'  :  Supervision  skills; \n.  Decision-making  and  problem-solving; \n°  Interpersonal  skills; \n.  Communication  skills;  and \n.  Integrity. \n‘  3.  | A  number  of studies  and  reports  confirm  the  primacy  of these  KSAs.  For  instance \nHRD’s  191  Validation  Report  determined  that critical  abilities  of a  police  sergeant  include, \namong  other things,  (a)  “ability  to  make  and  carry  out  decisions  quickly,”  (b)  “ability  to  give \nclear,  cor cise  verbal  orders,”  (c)  “ability  to  communicate  orally  and  in  writing,”  (d)  “ability  to \nbring  calin  to  control  surroundings  when  in  stress  producing  situations,”  and  (e) “ability  to \nestablish  ‘apport with  persons  from  different  ethnic,  cultural  and/or  economic  backgrounds.” \n3%.  The  court  also  accepts  and  adopts  as  fact the  statements  of a  subject  matter  expert, \nformer  Pe  abody  Police  Chief Robert  Champagne.  He  stated  accurately  that  good  sergeants \ncould  cemmunicate  well,  people  that  had  —  that  were  approachable,  people  that  had  a  nice \n| \nd‘  emeanor,  people  that  commanded  respect  from  the  peo¢ ple  that were  there  that were \n|  10 \n1 \n|\n— \n| \nknowledseable  that  the  1991  Validation  Report  knew  what  it  was  that  they  were  talking  about.” \nThe  cour  also  adopts  as  fact  Chief Champagne’s  testimony  that  knowledge  of the  profession  and \nLust  genvral  knowledge  of the —  of the city”  were desirable  traits  for  aspiring  sergeants. \n  \n!  3.  The  1991  Validation  report  generated  a  comprehens ive  list  of KSAs  required  to \nperform  the job  of police  sergeant.  It  included  a  job analysis  study  that  included  the  following \n:  ' \nmajor  stegs:  (1)  “[g]athering  of available job  information  from  Massachusetts  police \nLepartments,  as  well  as job  analysis  reports,  survey  instruments,  and  other  information  from \n| arisdioti ms  outside  the  Commonwealth”;  (2)  “[d]evelopment and  administration  of a  task \ninventory  questionnaire  designed to  identify  the  frequent and  critical  tasks  and  duties  of each  of \nthe  five  rinks,”  including sergeant; (3)  “[d]evelopment  and  administration  of a  knowledges, \nskills, abilities  and  personal  characteristics  (KSAPs)  inventory  questionnaire  designed  to  identify \nthe  impo tant KSAPs  required  at the  time  of appointment to  each  of the  five  ranks,”  including  , \n”  sergeant;  (4)  “[I]inkage  of the  important  KSAPs  to  the  frequent and  critical  tasks  of thesé jobs  by \nsubject  matter  experts  (SMEs)”;  (5)  “[d]esign  and  use  of critical  incident technique  (CIT) \nstructure!  group  discussions  to  gather  from  SMEs  descriptions  of actual  incidents  which  have \noccurred  on  the job”;  (6)  “[dJesign  and  use  of structured  group  discussions  to  gather  information \nfrom  SM 2s  about the  Education  and  Experience  (E&E)  component of DPA’s  selection \nprocedur  :s”;  and  (7)  “[dJesign  and  use  of structured  group  discussions  to  gather  information \nfrom  SM 3s  about  the  recommended  reading  list,  from  which  the  multiple-choice  written \nexaminat  on  questions  for the  police  promotional  exams  are  derived.” \n|  3¢,  From  the  inventory  of  187  total  KSAs,  the  SMEs  identified  159  KSAs  in  the  1991 \n| \nValidatioa  Report that  were  needed  to  perform  the job  of sergeant.  The  1991  Validation  Report \n| \n'  { \n| \nll\nwas  subs:antially  accurate  and  reliable  in  identifying the  necessary  KSAs  for the  police  sergeant \nposition. \n|  33.  The  1991  Validation  Report,  however, has  serious  flaws  in  identifying  (1)  which \nIKSAs  arc  testable  on  a  multiple-choice  exam  and  (2)  which  KSAs  are  measured  in  HRD’s \nscan  and  experience  component.  ! \n|  35,  A  2000  job  analysis  conducted  by  the  testing  firm  Morris  &  McDaniel  for the \nBoston  P lice  Department  determined  that  critical  KSAs  of a  police  sergeant  include,  among \n‘other thir gs,  (a)  “skill  in  supervision  and  leadership,”  (b)  “skill  in  implementing  community \npolicing  procedures  and  techniques,”  (c)  “interpersonal  skills,”  (d)  “presentation  skills,”  (e)  “oral \ncommunication  skills,”  (f)  “ability  to  remain  calm  in  stressful  situations,”  (g)  “ability  to  instill \n‘confidenc :e,”  and  (h)  “ability  to  think  under pressure.”  |  The  court  adopts  these  determinations  as \nto Bostor..  ' \n|  3,  The  2000 job  analysis  assessed  only  the  KSAs  required  of a  police  sergeant  in  the \nBoston  P slice  Department,  and  did  not  analyze  the  KSAs  of police  sergeants  in  other \nmunicipalities  or  departments. \n3h.  On  rating  sheets,  the  SMEs  ranked  the  importance  of various  KSAs  as  part  of that \njob  analysis.  Their  rankings  are  implausible.  The  11  SMEs  gave  identical  rankings  to  all  of the \napproximately  1,100  ratings,  which  is  all  but  impossible  in  the  absence  of coordination  between \nthe  SME:.  The  court  does  not  credit those  rankings,  which  almost  certainly  reflect  some \nunknown factor that  interfered  with  the  SMEs’  independence. \n|  30,  HRD  made  no  attempt to  defend  the  inexplicable  unanimity  of these  rankings, \naside  frora  speculation.  There  is  simply  no  evidence  démonstrating  that  any  complete  consensus \n|  12  1\noccurred  and  given  that  each  of the  questions  instructed]  the  rater to  answer  based  on  the  work \n1 \nthat they  do,  it  is  not possible  for everyone to  have  agreed  unanimously  on  every  ranking. \n'  4).  The  2000 job  analysis  also  claimed  that police  sergeants  perform  certain  tasks \nevery  dar’,  but that  could  not  possibly  be  true.’  Those  tasks  included: \n/  .  Qualifies  and/or  engages  in  required  practice  of operation  of firearms  and  other \nweapons; \n1  .  Investigates  and  resolves  citizen  complaints  against  police  officers; \n:  °  Set  up  command  post  at  scenes  of robberies,  homicides,  fires,  etc.; \nI  .  Directs  activities  at  the  scene  of major  incidents  (e.g.,  serious/fatal  accident, \n'  crime,  natural  disaster,  etc.) \n|  °  Conducts  internal  investigations; \n®  Investigates  and  prepares  reports  regarding  misconduct  by  subordinates; \ne  Investigates  use  of force  and  injury  to  prisoner  incidents  and  prepares  reports  for \nsuperiors  as  required; \n.  Recommends  subordinates  for commendations  and  disciplines  them  for \ndereliction  of duty; \n.  Inspects  licensed  premises  and  prepares  reports  on  violations,  if any  are  found; \n|  aiid \n'  .  Talks  with  leaders  of demonstrations.  , \n| \n4\\.  The  2000 job  analysis  did  reach  some  highly  significant  conclusions.  Most \nimportantly,  it  determined  that  at  least  half of the  skills  necessary  for  the job  of police  sergeant \nshould  be:  tested  by  assessment  mechanisms  other  than, a written  multiple-choice  examination. \n‘The  cour:  adopts  that  determination. \n42.  Finally,  HRD  never  performed  a  criterion  validity  study,  which  is  designed  to \nevaluate  ‘he  extent to  which  a  sergeant’s  actual job  performance  correlates  with  performance  on \nan  examination.  A  criterion  validity  study  would  have been  feasible  where  HRD  has  used  the \nisame  examination  format  for decades  and  there  is  thus:a  large  pool  of current  and  former \n'  Since  th: job  analysis  asked  11  sergeants  with  diverse job  assignments  to  state  what tasks  they \n[themselves  did  every  day,  these  claims would  not  be true  even  if,  for  instance,  some  sergeants  in  a \nspecializei  unit (e.g.  internal  affairs)  did  conduct  internal  investigations  daily. \n:  13\n|  | \n| \nsergeants  within  the  Commonwealth  whose job  performance  and  test  scores  could  have  been \nanalyzed  to  evaluate  the  validity  of HRD’s  promotional  exams. \nWritten  Exams \n|  4.  Most  of the  questions  on  the  exams  at  issue  in  this  case  tested  topics  that  were \nimporta:  to  the job  of sergeant.  That  does  not mean  that  HRD’s  format  was  reasonably job \nrelated.  ]t was  not. \n4d,  Because  HRD  failed  to  test many  important  KSAs,  measured  test-taking  skills  and \nimemoriz: ition,  enabled  test-related  anxiety  to  affect  results  and  failed  to  ask  questions  that \n|  . \n| focused  pon  measurinwgs  job-related  knowled. ge,  i. ts  format  di:d   not  rank  candid: ates  for \npromotio 1al  purposes  on  a  basis  that  was  substantially job  related. \na.  Testability  of KSAs \n45.  For  one  thing,  the  exams  did  not test  many  important job  qualifications.  More \nimportantly,  written  questions  on  a  particular topic  often  test  details,  rather than job-related \nknowledge  of information  and  principles  actually  used  on  the job.  Testing  for  knowledge  of \n\\ \nsoon-forgotten  details  does  not measure  ability  to  apply  knowledge  practically  and  to  exercise \njudgment  on  that topic  in  specific  situations,  as  a  sergeant  actually  does  on  the job.  Finally,  the \ntests  measure  a  candidate’s  test-taking  skills,  abstract  knowledge  and  ability  to  memorize  source \nmaterial.  A  sergeant  does  not  need  these  skills  in  practice.  Nor does  a  candidate  need  abstract \nknowledge  that  does  not  reflect the  ability  to  use judgment  in  a  practical  way  on  the job. \n| \n'  Ae.  As  part  of the  1991  Validation  Report,  the  SMEs  identified  58  KSAs  that,  in  their \nview,  were tested  by  the  multiple-choice  component.  HRD  did  not  develop  alternative  methods \n1 \nof evaluating  the  remaining  KSAs.  It  simply  opted-not  to  test them  at  all.  Yet,  many of  the \n;  , \ncritical  skills  and  abilities  could  not  possibly  be  tested  in  a written  multiple-choice  examination. \n14\n‘These  included  “[s]kills  in  identifying problems,  securing  relevant  information  from  both  oral \n‘  i \nand  writt2n  sources,  identifying  possible  causes  of problems,  and  analyzing  and  interpreting  data \nand  complex  situation  [sic]  involving  conflicting  demands,  needs,  or  priorities,”  “[a]bility  to \n‘confront  problems,  take  charge,  and  assume  responsibility,” 99  66, “ability  to  appropriately  delegate \nassignments,” 99  66, “ability  to  plan,”  and  “ability  to  develop  alternative  solutions  to  problems  and \nevaluate  :ourses  of action  and  to  reach  logical  decisions based  on  the  information  at  hand,” \namong  others.  Those  skills,  among  others  (such  as  ability  to  communicate  orally  with \nsubordinates  and  civilians),  call  for  situational judgment  and  interpersonal  skills,  rather than \ntheoreticiil  and  academic  knowledge  about  such judgment  and  skills. \n47,  Implausibly,  HRD  stated  the  KSAs just:  quoted  could  be  tested  adequately  and \nappropriz tely  on  the  written  examination,  with questions  in  the  format  HRD  actually  used.  That \n‘was  not tue. \nt  48,  Moreover,  as  written,  HRD’s  actual  examinations  did  not  in  fact test  even  for \nsome  ski. ls that could  have  been  tested,  because  some  questions  addressed  abstract  knowledge \nand  failec|  to  focus  on  matters  relevant to  performance  as  a  police  sergeant. \n4,  Where  HRD  did  address  questions  of empathy  or the  dangers  of authoritarian \nsupervision,  it  did  so  by  asking  an  informational  question,  rather than  testing  whether the \nindividual  candidate  had  empathy  or  authoritarian  traits.  Thus,  reaching  the  correct  answer \nturned  ur on  test-taking  skills,  temporary  memorization,  or  academic  understanding  of facts \nunrelated  to  actual job  performance.  For  instance,  question  35  on  the  2010  exam  asked: \nAccording  to  CP,  the  most  critical  determinant  of future  success  as  a  community \npolicing  Officer  is: \nA.  superior  communication  skills. \nB.  Empathy. \nc.  autonomy. \nD.  Analytical  ability. \n15\nfo \n1|   | \n.  | \nThere  is  :10  reason  to  think  that  a  candidate  who  knows  that the  correct  answer  is  “B”  will \n‘actually  lave  more  empathy  than  someone  who  thinks  that  a  plausible  alternative  answer  is  what \nt \n“Cp”  lists  as  the  “most  critical  determinant.” \n50.  Likewise,  question  37  on  the  same  exam  asked: \nBarker  and  Carter  found  that  authoritarianism  is  a  dominant trait  among  Officers. \nAccording  to  CP,  police  managers  should: \n\\  1  Recognize that  authoritarian  traits  are  most  prominent  in  young  Officers  and  that \n1  they  tend  to  subside  with  experience. \n2  Attempt to  reduce  authoritarianism  and  its  behavioral  consequences  because \nOfficers  tend  to  become  more  authoritarian  over time. \n3  Encourage  Officers  to  take  an  authoritarian  approach  because  it  often  helps  to \ncontrol  a  situation.  : \n4  Not  involve  an  Officer possessing this  trait  in  community policing efforts  because \nit will  likely  escalate  the  Officer’s  degree  of authoritarianism. \nWhen  asl:ed  about  this  question,  the  Commonwealth’s  SME  responded  that  authoritarianism  was \na  problem,  but  not  between  2006-2012  when,  in  his  opinion  it was  getting  better.  He  pointed  out \nthat,  mos;  important,  a  sergeant  should  identify  whether authoritarianism  was  a  problem  and,  if \nso,  to  traia  the  officer(s)  in  question.  The  question  did  not  address  that  most  important  skill  and, \naccording  to  the  subject  matter  expert,  may  be  addressing  a  largely  outdated  concern. \n51.  HRD  long  knew  that  many  important  KSAs  could  not  be  tested  in  either the \nwritten  or  E&E  component.  When  it  oversaw  the  Mortis  and  McDaniel’s  job  analysis  in  support \nof the  1987  Boston  Police  Department  promotional  examination  and  set the  allocation  of points \nacross  va: ious  components  of the  examination,  it  knew that the  experts  at  that  firm  believed  that \nthe  writte.  test  did  not  assess  many  of  the  attributes  needed  for  the job  and  should  account  for no \n|  . \nI \nmore  thar  40%  of the  overall  score. \n'  5z.  While  the  true  percentage  of KSAs  that  are  testable  through  a  written  multiple \nchoice  test  is  open  to  some  debate,  the  court  accepts  the  range  from  (a)  Morris  and  McDaniel’s \ni \n16\n1989  estimate  that 40%  of the  KSAs  could  be  tested  in  a  written  test  to  (b)  Dr.  Wiesen’s  estimate \nthat  HRD?  only  tested  22%  of KSAs  in  the  multiple  choice  test. \n| \n|  53.  -In  2000,  the  Boston  Police  Department  commissioned another job  analysis  by \nMorris  &  McDaniel,  which  led  to  the  2002  Boston  examination.  Morris  &  McDaniel  advised \nHRD  anc  the  Boston  Police  Department to  administer an 1  examination  that  included  non-written \ncomponents  (an  assessment center  and  performance  review  system)  that,  collectively,  received  as \n‘much  weight  as  the  written  multiple-choice  examination: \nThe  method  of evaluation  of a  candidate  for promotion  on  a  KSA  may  include, \nbut  is  not  limited  to,  a written  examination,  an  assessment  center,  a training \nprogram,  a  probationary  period,  and/or  a  medical/physical  examination.  The \nmethod  of evaluation  is  dependent  on  the  appropriateness  of measurement \nfor  the  particular KSA.  For  example,  knowledge  of search  and  seizure  laws  can \nbe  evaluated  most  effectively  in  a  written  examination,  whereas  ability  to \ncommunicate  orally  is  more  appropriately  evaluated  through  a  performance \nbased  assessment  technique  such  as  an  oral  board  or  an  assessment  center. \n‘  [Emphasis  supplied]. \nEx.  42  at  p.  1  (Bates  number  1550).  This  advice  is  sound. \n3+}.  That  advice  is  also  consistent with  the  testimony,  in  Lopez J,  of Ed  Davis,  the \nformer  C »mmissioner of the  Boston  Police  Department.  He  testified  that  a  written  exam  should \nbe  a com onent  of every  sergeant’s  exam  because  “the  basic  fundamental  knowledge  that’s \n\\ \nneeded  tc  be  in  a  supervisory  rank  in  a  police  department.  .  .  is  so  important to  the  day-in-day- \nout work  of [a  sergeant].”  .  ‘ \n5.  Many  of the  KSAs  identified  in  the  1991  job  analysis  and  2000  Morris  & \nMcDaniel  study  call  for  evaluation  through  “a  performance  based  assessment technique.” \nFailure  tc  do  so  injects  extraneous  influences  (such  as  test-taking  ability  and  temporary \nmemorizition  skills)  into  the  selection  process,  while  diminishing  the  exam’s  ability  to  measure \n1 \nimportan:  KSAs  accurately  or  appropriately. \n| \n|  17 \n| \n|\nvl  . \n5.  HRD’s  knowledge  of the  Morris  &  McDaniel  2000  study  also  confirms  its \nknowledjse  that  a  written  multiple-choice  test  alone  does  not  sufficiently  test  for the  skills  and \nabilities  1ecessary  for the job. \n5‘,  The  limitations  of HRD’s  format  in  testing  KSAs  are  also  apparent  when \ncompared!  to  alternatives.  In  2002,  HRD  approved  the  City  of Boston’s  plan  to  introduce  a \nperforma  ice  review  system  to  the  examination  process.  Under  that  system,  candidates’ prior job \nperforma 1ce  would  be  reviewed  and  assessed  as  part  of the  promotion  process. \n‘  56.  As  Dr.  Silva  acknowledged  at trial,  performance  review  systems  “can  be  useful \nand  they  Jo  tend  to  reduce  adverse  impact.”  His  own  company,  E.B.  Jacobs  has  recommended \nuse  of such  systems.  However,  Boston’s  plan  to  implement  a  performance  review  system  was \nultimatel:’  abandoned  following  opposition  from  the  police  unions.  In  scrapping  the  plan,  then- \nPolice  Cc mmissioner  Paul  Evans:stated: \n| \n| \nJust  as  we  have  changed  the  way  we  do  police  work,  we  must  change  the  way  we  , \npromote.  We  need  to  understand  that  our  promotional  system  remains  mired  in  a \n! \n|  tradition  that has  become  obsolete  and  disconnected  from  the  way  we  do  business \n! \ntoday.  We  must  be  willing  to  reward  police  work,  not  memorization  skills. \nb.  Formulating  Questions  for Testable  KSAs \n5%,  The  exams  at  issue  also  included  questions  that  lack  “fidelity,”  i.e.  a  relationship \nto  a  serge ant’s job,  even  though  the  questions  nominally  relate  to,  for  instance  criminal \nprocedure  and  criminal  law.  A  patrol  supervisor sergeant  would  use  the  criminal  procedure  and \nthe  criminal  law  portion  of what  HRD assigned  candidates  to  read  and  study.  The  other  assigned \nreading  rz  aterials  may  cover  important  topics,  but  knowing  those  sources  has  considerably  less \ntelationsh  ip  to  the  sergeant  position.  Apart  from  the  criminal  procedure  and  criminal  law,  the \ni \ntechnical  knowledge  part  of HRD*s  exams  had  only  an  attenuated  connection,  if any,  to  the \nactual job.  , \n| \n18\n||  \n60.  For  instance,  sergeants  must apply  theit  knowledge  by exercising judgment  in \nspecific  situations.  It  is  possible to  write  situational judgment  questions,  and  some  examinations \n‘do  so,  but very  few  of HRD’s  questions  do  so. \n6l.  | HRD’s  multiple  choice  questions  regarding  topics  covered  in  assigned  source \n‘materials follow a  common  format:  They  start with  “according  to”  the  source,  followed  by \napproxiniately  4  sentences,  followed  by  four  choices,  based upon  the  sentence.  These  questions \ntest  knowledge  of the  source  material.  Such  an  emphasis  on  memorization  of source  material \nlacks  sugport  in  any  analysis  of KSAs  needed  to  perform  well  as  a police  sergeant. \n62.  Similarly,  many  questions  are  definitional  in  that the  answers  turn  upon  the \nmeaning  of a particular  word.  Those  questions  have  low  fidelity,  because  a  sérgeant’s job  does \nnot  genetally  involve  using  academic  jargon  or  other definitions  of concepts  in  the  assigned \nreading.  Dr.  Wiesen’s  estimate  that  20%  of the  questions  are  primarily  definitional  is \nreasonab‘e. \n63.  Some  examples  discussed  during  trial?  illustrate  and  prove  that  testing  for \nknowledge  of material  assigned  and  memorized  during  test  preparation  is  not the  same  as  testing \nfor practi :al  knowledge  used  on  the job. \n6.  On  cross-examination  of plaintiffs’  expert,  the  Commonwealth  asked  about \nquestions  4,  5,  10  and  15  on  the  2005  exam,  which  ostensibly  measure  knowledge  of a  relevant \ntopic  of c:iminal  procedure.  They  do  measure  that  knowledge,  but  not  in  a  way  adapted  to \n? The  court recognizes,  of  course,  that  taking  isolated  examples  from  the voluminous  record  does  not \nprove  a trend  or  overall  conclusion.  The  court therefore  concentrates  on  examples  chosen  by  the \nCommonveealth to justify  its  position  during the trial,  because those  examples  illustrate  problems  in the \nCommonv-ealth’s  justifications  for the  exams. \n,  :  19 \no  '\ndistinguishing  between  candidates  who  will  have  the substantive  knowledge  they  need  to  be \ngood  sereants  from  those  who  will  not.  Illustrative  was  question  15,  which  reads: \n15.  According  to  PA,  the  aim of the  decision  made  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  the \ncase  of Mapp  y.  Ohio  was  to: \nA.  ban  the  use of illegally-seized  evidence  in  criminal  cases. \nB.  affirm  equal  protection,  including  legal  counsel,  for  all  requiring  it. \nC.  handcuff police  in  their  struggle  with  lawlessness. \nD.  require  police  officers  to  inform  suspects  of their  constitutional  rights  during \nthe  course  of questioning. \nLopez  E>..  48,  p.  8.  Since  answers  A,  B  and  D are  arguably  correct  in  many  circumstances,° \nselecting  the  right  answer  requires  knowing  that  the  case  announcing  the  exclusionary  rule  was \ncalled  Mipp.  v.  Ohio.  A  sergeant  does  not  need  to  know  case  names.  Asking  the  question  in  the \nmatter  se!  forth  in  2005  Exam  question  15  may  produce  a  “spread”  among  candidates,  which  is \ndesirable  from  a  question-writer’s  perspective,  but that  spread  distinguishes  between  candidates \non  the  basis  of knowledge  of names  of decided  cases,  not  on  the  basis  of knowing  that  illegally- \nseized  ev dence  is  generally  inadmissible.’ \n3  One  car  argue  that  options  B  and  D  are  worded  too  broadly to  be  correct,  but  then,  some  illegally \nseized  evillence may  be  admissible  in  criminal  cases  in certain  circumstances  too.  See,  e.g.  Grasso  and \nMcEvoy,  ‘suppression Matters  under Massachusetts  Law,  §§  20-3[a],  [b],  [c],  [d]  (LexisNexis  2020) \n(discussin;; exceptions to  the  fruit  of the  poisonous  tree  doctrine:  independent  source,  attenuation, \ninevitable  discovery).  While  articulation  of those  doctrinal  exceptions  post-dated  Mapp,  it  is  certainly  not \nimportant  for a police  sergeant to  know the  historical  development  of exceptions  to  the exclusionary  rule; \nthe  sergeant needs  to  know  only  what  rules  apply to  the time  when  the  events  are  occurring. \n4  Other crc ss-examination  about  questions  on  the 2005  exam  (#4,  5,  26,  27,  28)  failed  to  establish that  the \nquestions «listinguished between candidates  based upon predicted  job  performance.  Those questions were \nmost  likely:  to  separate  candidates  based  upon the  degree  to  which they  were  “test-wise”  and  upon  their \nability  to  Cecipher  convoluted  questions.  While  question  4  does  set  forth a  fact  situation  and  asks  for \noptions,  th:  court  agrees  with  Dr.  Wiesen that the  question  is  not  an  effective  situational  question  because \nit requires  the  candidate to  state  (rather  academically  and  “according to  MGL  and  MVL”)  what the \n“STRONC EST  legal  action that  [the  officer]  can take”  (however,  unwise)  as  opposed to what  the  police \n“should”  do.  It is  important to  know what  actions  are  unlawful,  but not  what  excessive  actions  the  officer \ncould take without  breaking the  law.  The question  does  not  test judgment  about  the  most  appropriate \nresponse. \n20\n; \n65.  HRD  conducts  a  post-exam  review  of questions  that appeared  to  be  problematic \nfor  applicants.  This  can  result  in  disregarding  a  question  altogether  in  the  scoring  or  in  deeming \nmore  thaa  one  answer  correct.  On  the  2007  statewide  examination,  HRD  determined  that  18  of \n‘the  80  questions  (or  approximately  22%)  were  flawed  and  either  eliminated  or double-keyed \nthem.  This  high  proportion  of flawed  questions  reflects  deficiencies  in  exam  design  and \nquestion- writing. \n66.  The  Commonwealth’s  subject  matter  expert’s  testimony  was  also  revealing \nregarding  question  19  on  the  2008  exam,  which  reads: \nAcco‘ding  to  PDRCIP,  regarding the  requirements  for a  search  to  be  legally  valid,  it  would \nbe  co-rect to  state  that: \nA.  Neither  the  search  warrant  nor the  accompanying  affidavit  are  required  to  be  brought \nto  the  scene. \nB_  The  affidavit  must  be  brought to  the  scene  and  presented  on  demand,  to  the  owner or \noccupant  of the  premises,  but  it  is  not required  to  bring  a  copy  of the  search  warrant. \nC  The  search  warrant  must  be  brought to  the  scene  and  presented  on  demand,  to  the \nowner or  occupant  of the  premises,  but  it  is  not  required  to  bring  a  copy  of the \naffidavit. \nD.  Both  the  search  warrant  and  the  affidavit  must  be  brough  to  the  scene  but  the  police \nare  not  required  to  present  either  document  to  the  owner  or  occupant  of the  premises, \neven  upon  demand. \nChief Chmpagne  explained  why  he  found  this  question job-related,  but  cited  practical,  not  legal \nreasons: \nQ  Can  you  explain  why  you  believe  that's  a  really  good  question? \nA  So,  oftentimes,  if you  show  up  at  somebody's  house  to  serve  a  search  warrant, \nthzy're  going  to  say,  I  want to  see  the  search  warrant  --  to  make  sure  that,  by  the  way,  that \nwe're  not  bluffing  as  the  cops;  that we  actually  have  one,  right? No.  2,  to  make  sure  we \nheve  the  right  house,  because  from  time  to  time  we  make  mistakes.  We're  supposed  to  be \nat  22;  we're  at  24,  right,  and  so  somebody  says,  that's  not me.  I'm  not  Mr.  Johnson;  I'm \nMr.  Jones.  Johnson  lives  next  door.  So  I  think there's  practical  things  that  are  right  there \nfo:  both  the  police  and  for  the  --  for  it to  be  there,  but  I  also  think  [9-168]  that --  I  think \nthit the  intent  --  and,  again,  it's  my  opinion  --  but  |  think the  intent  of the  law was  to  do  it \nth:  right  way,  right?  Somebody  wants  to  see  that  the  Court  has  seen  fit to  give  us  a \nwiurrant  to  search  their property,  show  it  to  them,  why  not?  Q.  Is  that  information  that  a \nse‘geant would  need  to  know?  A.  Abs  --  I  think  it's  --  I  think that's  -- yes,  my  opinion  is \n21\na solutely  he'd  need  to  know that  for the  sake  of why  escalate  something?  Why  --  put \nsomething  to  rest.  ' \niTr.  9-168.  Chief Champagne  agreed  that  it  would  “make  more  sense  to  ask  the  sergeant \n‘candidate  what's  good  practice  to  bring  to  [the  warrant,to  the  scene]  as  opposed  to  what's  legal, \nbecause  it  might  be  that  good  practice  is  more  than  what's  required  by  the  law.”  Tr.  9-168-169.5 \n67.  Another  example  of information  that  fell  within  the  general  topic  of criminal  law, \nbut  was  unrelated  to  the  sergeant’s  job,  was  inquiry  into  the  maximum  length  of prison  sentences \nallowed  ly  law  for  certain  offenses  (2008  Military  Make-up  Examination,  questions  6,  7,  and  8). \nJudges  aiid  criminal  trial  lawyers  need  to  know  this,  but  sergeants  could  look  up  this  information \nin  the  un‘ikely  event they  needed  to  know. \n6.  These  examples  demonstrate  the  difference  between  the  practical  information  that \nsergeants  need  to  know  and  use  in  practice  and  the  more  academic  information  sought  in  the \nquestions,  such  as  case  names,  legal  doctrine,  or  legal  source  for mandatory  police  practices.  A \nsingle  po  nt  difference  in  exam  score  may  make  the  difference  between  being  considered  at  all \nand  being  promoted  -  -  and  in  being  delayed  in  promotion.  It therefore  does  not take  many  ill- \nconceivec!  questions  to  make  a  difference. \n6\".  Because  the  above-cited  questions  (and  others)  received  SME  approval  despite \nthe  presence  of significant  demands  upon  applicants  to  apply  non-job-related  skills,  the  court \ninfers  tha: HRD  did  not  adequately  instruct  its  subject  matter expert,  or question  writers  to  avoid \nfocus  upcn  memorization  of abstract  or  academic  information,  or to  determine  and  test the \n*  Indeed,  question  19  may  even  be  counterproductive,  because there  clearly  are  situations  where  having \nthe  warrant affidavit,  though  not required,  has  the  practical  benefit  of clarifying the  location  to  be \nsearched  iit some  unanticipated  situations,  See  Commonwealth  v,  Hamilton,  83  Mass.  App.  Ct.  406,  414- \n415  (2013?  (warrant  affidavit  clarified which  apartment was  to  be  searched);  Commonwealth  v.  Toledo, \n66  Mass.  A.pp.  Ct.  688,  692-700  (2006)  (warrant  affidavit made  clear that  the  warrant  used  the wrong, \nstreet name). \n\\  22 \n \ninformat.on  that  a  sergeant  actually  needs.  HRD  failed  to  instruct them that, if the  subject matter \nexpert relies  upon  practicalities  rather than  legal precedent,  the  question  should  do  the  same, \n‘because  ihat  is  what real  sergeants  do. \n7).  It  follows  that,  even  for testable  KSAs,  HRD’s  actual  questions  test  for extraneous \nskills,  insluding  academic-level  understanding,  attribution  to  specific  source  material,  and  test- \ntaking  skills.  A  candidate  with  equal  knowledge  of relevant,  testable  content  may  fare worse \nthan  an  equally-qualified  (or  even  less-qualified)  candidate  versed  in  test-taking,  academics  or \ntemporary  memorialization. \nC  Precision \n7.  Even  where  HRD’s  questions  actually  tested  for KSAs  in  the  manner  required  to \nperform  \\vell  as  a  police  sergeant,  the  questions  remain:  to  what  extent,  if any,  does  the  final \nscoring  warrant the  conclusion  that  a  candidate  with  a  higher  score  is  likely  to  perform  better  as  a \npolice  seigeant  than  one  who  scores  lower?  Does a  single  point  difference  in  scores \nmeaningfully  predict  who  is  the  better candidate?  If not,  does  some  larger  point  difference  do \nso? \n72.  HRD’s  Eligibility  Lists  distinguish  between  candidates  based  upon  scores, \ndiffering  »y  one  point  or  more,  on  a  process  almost  entirely  driven  by  scores  on  a  rote-memory \nmultiple  «  hoice  test. \nTe.  Given  the  deficiencies  in  the  test,  the  point  score  differences  are not job  related, \nexcept  pe haps  where  the  differences  are  very  large.  There  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  a \ncandidate  who  scores  one  point  higher than  another  candidate  (or even  3  or  more  points  higher) \nis  likely  to  be  a  better police  sergeant  than  the  lower-scoring  applicant. \n23\n| \n74.  HRD  itself recognized  that  single-point  differences  in  scores  did  not  predict \ncandidat >  qualifications  and,  in  fact,  proposed  “banding.”  Banding  entails  grouping  candidates \nfalling  within  a  range  of scores  and  treating  them  as  though  they  all  received  the  same  score.  It \nreflects  the  reality  (as  the  court finds)  that  a  one-point  difference  in  scores  is  not job-related. \n]  75.  As  stated  earlier,  in  a  number  of years  (1992,  1996),  it  was  in  fact HRD  and  local \ndepart  ints,  including  the  City  of Boston  and  the  MBTA,  who  took  the  position  formally  and  in \n“'court that the  promotional  examination  was  not sufficiently  valid  to justify  strict  rank  order \nselection,  and  that  it was  thus  appropriate  to  hire  out-of-order  by  selecting  lower scoring \nminorities.  In  essence,  HRD  has  already  conceded  that  its  multiple-choice  examinations  were \nnot  sufficiently  valid  as  rank  order  devices,  even  though  they  now  claim just  the  opposite. \nd.  Development  of New Tests \n73.  For  each  test,  HRD  wrote  new test questions every  year and  submitted  those \n|  question:  to  SMEs  for  review and  revision.  The  consistent  references  to  written  source  materials \n|  did  not  change  materially. \nTI  For the  tests  at  issue,  HRD  did  not vary  the  basic  format  of a  rote-memory \nmultiple  choice  exam  and  E&E with  defined  components.  Nor  did  HRD  change  the  underlying \nKSAs  it  identified.  It  therefore  failed  to  test  meaningfully  the  KSAs  required  for  good \nperforma ice  as  a police  sergeant. \n7%.  | HRD  assessed  the  knowledge,  skills,  and  abilities  (“KSAs”)  of police  sergeants \non  a  statewide  basis,  without differentiating  between  departments  or  municipality  size  or \n|  '  demographics,  as  part  of its  1991  Validation  Report. \n7°,  The  changes  from  exam  to  exam  did  not  address  the  shortcomings  in job \n\\ \nrelatedness  identified  above. \n24\ne.  Police  Sergeant Performance  onfLater  Written  Exams \ni  8).  | Because  Police  sergeants  do  not use  many  of the  KSAs  tested  by  HRD’s  rote- \n nemory  multiple  choice  tests,  incumbent sergeants  who  take  HRD  promotional  exams  for \nlieutenan! often  do  not  perform  well  on  the  sergeants’  portion.  Incumbent  sergeants  forget the \nabstract  knowledge  they  acquired  to  pass  the  sergeant  promotional  test.  The  information  that \nsuccessfvl  candidates  memorized  for  the  HRD  promotional  exam  was  not  something  they  used \nregularly  on  duty  as  sergeants  and  therefore  they  did  not  commit  it to  memory. \n8.  This  also  confirms  that  memorization  of the  assigned  reading  material  is  not \nnecessariiy  important  to  good  performance  as a  police  sergeant.  Police  sergeants  can  consult \n  \nsource  in Jormation  (or  other  individuals)  to  avoid  mistakes,  which  may  be  advisable  except  in  an - \nemergency.  While  they  may  need  to  memorize  some  information,  memory  is  unreliable.  There \n| \nis  a  substantial  risk  of mistakes  on  the  job  due  to  failure  of memory  if sergeants  rely  heavily  on \nmemorizition.  HRD  knew  all  this  at the  relevant time.  There  is  no  credible  evidence  that  it \nevaluatec  which  information  police  sergeants  must  memorize  in  order to  perform  their job. \n| \n|  f.  Influence  of Extraneous  Factors \ni \n8!  Rote  memory  multiple  choice  tests,  with  questions  drawn  from a  reading  list, \n' \nfavor tho  se  whose  educational  experiences  included  such  examinations.  Familiarity  with  such \ntests  likely  reduce  the  anxiety  of test-takers.  Experience  helps  develop  strategies  for  answering \nquestions,  including  ways  to  identify  “distractors”  (false  options)  and  identifying  the  methods \n'  . \nused  by  cuestion  writers.  HRD  has  not accounted  for the  existence  of disparate  educational \n{  i \npeer  ties  and  differing  exposure  to  high-stakes  rote  memory  tests  as  between  racial  and \nethnic  groups.  The  court  credits  the testimony  of the  witnesses  in  this  case  who  pointed  to\neducatio:1al  disparities  as  an  explanation  for  the differing  performance  of such  groups  on  HRD’s \nL \nt \ntests. \n83.  Test taking  skills  are  built  through practice.  Expert witnesses  in  this  case \nobserved  that  minorities,  in  general,  have  had  fewer  opportunities  to  participate  in  our \neducational  system.  This  results  in  fewer  opportunities  for  minorities  to  take  tests  and  to  become \ngood  test  takers,  which  translates  into  the  adverse  impact  seen  on  tests  in  general,  especially  tests \nof cognitive  ability.  Dr.  Silva testified  that  he  believes  the  difference  in  average  performances  is \ndue  to  so :ioeconomic  differences,  lack  of access  to  opportunity,  and  structural  racism  that  exists \nwithin  th:  system,  all  of which  makes  everything  more  difficult  for  minorities  and  impacts  all  . \ntests.  Th2  court  accepts  and  adopts  this  testimony. \n8!.  |  HRD’s  format  distinguishes  in  significant part  between  candidates  based  upon  the \neducatior al  and  testing  opportunities  that the  candidates  had  in  the  past,  regardless  of the \ncandidate’s  personal  strengths  on  the  most  important  qualifications  for  performance  as  a \nsergeant,  including  the  five  most  important  skills  and  abilities  identified  above. \n8.  Given  these  potential  explanations,  scores  on  tests  that  differ  by  as  little  as  one \npoint  lack,  a  connection  to  potential  ability  as  a  police  sergeant and  may  reflect fewer \nopportunities  to  acquire  test-taking  skills  and  to  practice  rote,  temporary  memorization  for  test- \ntaking  pu ‘poses. \nEducation  and  Training \n8¢€.  As  part  of the  1991  Validation  Report,  SMEs  reviewed  the  E&E  component  under \nwhich  “incumbents  receive  points  that  in  combination  with  their  raw  score  on  the  written  civil \n1 \nservice  exam  become the  score  by  which they  are  ranked  and  placed  on  civil  service eligible  lists \nof candidites  for  appointment.” \n26\n87.  The 1991  Validation  Report  did  list  sonic  skills  as  being  tested  on  the  EXE \n‘component.  Those  skills  included  “perceiving  and  reacting  to  the  needs  of others”,22   66, “ability  to \ntt \nnl \n  write,  prepare  reports”,29   66 “ability  to  be  confidential”,  “ability  to  follow policies  and  procedures”, \nand  “ability  to  interpret  policy.”  Given  the  limited  scopé  of the  E&E  component  and  the  failure \ni \nto  considzr  or give  credit  for many  elements  of education  and  experience, HRD  did  not  in  fact \ncapture  these  skills  in  the  E&E  component.  ry \n‘| \n|  83.  HRD  considered a  list  of experience  and  education,  limited  to  the  matters  and \nparamete  ts  set  forth  on  an  E&E  Rating  Sheet.  Section ‘iH  of the  E&E Rating  Sheet  requested \ninformation  on  their candidate’s  work  experience.  Section  IV  asked  candidates  to  report  certain \neducational  degrees.  Section  V  of the  E&E  Rating  Sheet  asked  candidates  to  list  any  courses \nabove  the  high  schoo!  level  that they  took  in  the  same  Subject  areas  for which  credit was  given  if \n‘an  educa’ ional  degree  was  earned  in  that  area. \n|  8).  Sections  III,  IV  and  V  did  not  assess  how the  candidate  performed  during  earlier \n‘study  anc  training  in  prior jobs  what  they  learned  or  what  skills  they  exhibited. \n!  91).  Neither  Sections  III,  IV  nor V  nor  any  other  aspect  of HRD’s  format  considered \nsupervisc ry  experience  outside  of law  enforcement (such  as  private  industry  or the  military). \nHRD  did  not  grant  credit  forc ertain  kinds  of law  enforcement  training  (e.g.  in  the  military  police \nor  other  tailitary  position).  It  gave  no  credit  for  matters  such  as  community  policing  or \ninvolverrent  in  the  communities  served  by.the  candidate’s  department.  It  did  not  assess  other \nexperience  that  would  provide  useful  background  for  a  police  sergeant.® \n\\ \n1 \nPo \n.  Similar  limits  are  in place  for certain  points  awarded  because  of statutory  preferences,  see  Ralph v. \nCivil  Service  Commission,  100  Mass.  App.  Ct.  199,  199  (2021)  (no  points  for  experience  as  an  auxiliary \n‘police  off:cer and  as  a special  police  officer). \n27\n  \n1 \nol.  HRD  did  not  validate  its  treatment  of education.  For  instance,  there  is  no  credible \n! \nsupport for  the  notion  that  a  bachelor’s  degree  was  the.  equivalent  of six  years job  experience. \n.  ‘|  : \nGranting  an  incentive  for  officers  to  receive  education  (as  in  the  Quinn  bill)  is  not the  same  as \nvalidatin;   qualifications  for  rank-ordering  of candidates  on  a  promotional  exam. \n92.  As  part  of the  1991  Validation  Report,  SMEs  identified  23  KSAs  that,  in  their \nview,  we.e  tested  by  the  E&E  component.  Given  the  limited  scope  of information  considered  on \nthe  E&E  weighting,  however,  HRD’s  format  did  not  actually  assess  many  of those  KSAs. \n91.  “Based  upon  an  analysis  of past standard  practices  and  the  most recent  [E&E] \nweightini;  schemes  used  in  [pre-1991]  Boston  Police  Department promotional  examinations \nwhich  were  developed  by  [SMEs],  the  decision  was  made  to  rate  the  [E&E]  component  at  20% \nof the  final  mark  with  the  balance  of the  mark  attributed  to  the  written  examination.”  1991 \nValidatioa  Report  at  15.  No  empirical  support or  credible  professional  study justified  the  20% \nweighting: \n%.,  In  practice,  the  effective  weight  of E&E  component  is  substantially  lower  than \n20%  beczuse  of the  way  HRD  scores  E&E. \n9!.  | A  candidate  receives  14 of the  20  points just  for  being  eligible  to  sit  for the  exam \nby  virtue  of having  been  an  officer for three  years.  HRD  has  not  cited  any  study  linking  the \nallotment  of  14  parts  to  the  relative  importance  of three years  of seniority.  A  candidate  receives \nthe  same  14  points  whether  he  or  she  has  three  years  or eighteen  years  of experience  as  a  police \nofficer. \n9€.  The  effective  weight  of the  E&E  component,  therefore,  is  6  to  8  points,  not  20 \npoints  oul  of  100.  In  practice,  a  candidate’s  score  is  based  nearly  entirely  on  the  written \nLo  :  .  .  «oss  .  wo \nmultiple-choice  component,  with the  “education  and  experience”  component  having  a  minimal \n|  28 \n| \n|\nimpact  01a candidate’s  score.  HRD  has  long  been  aware  that  it  has  never  validated  its  EXE \nating  muthodology  in  accordance  with  any  principles  under the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity \n‘Commis:ion’s  Uniform  Guidelines  on  Employee  Selection  Procedures  (1978)  (the  “Uniform \niGuidelin 2s”).  . \n97.  In  fact,  the  final  scores  on  HRD’s  exams  correlated  in  a  perfect  linear  relationship \nwith  the  score  on  the  multiple  choice  tests,  with  statistically  significant  certainty. \n93.  _Insum,  by  2005  HRD  knew  that  its  written  80  question  multiple-choice  rote \nmemory  :xam,  when  used  as  a  rank  order  device,  and  without  any  other  type  of assessment \ncenter,  even  when  coupled  with  the  E&E  rating,  was  not  valid  either  under the  Uniform \nGuidelinus  or M.G.L.  c.  31  §  16. \nII.  Exam  Scoring  and  Adverse  Impact  1 \nStatistical  Methods  and  Measures. \nA.  Statistical  Significance  and  Adverse  Jmpact Ratio \n90,  Statistical  significance  is  a  term  of art.  In  this  case,  the  experts  assessed  statistical \nsignificar ce  by  calculating  a  probability  (a  “p-value”)  for comparisons  between  candidates’ \nperforma ice  and  promotions.  A  “p-value”  is  a  distribution  of probabilities  that  an  observed \nresult  is  |  kely  to  occur  by  chance,  assuming  that  there  is  no  difference  between  data  subsets. \n100.  In  their  field,  statisticians  accept  a  p-value  below  .05  as  determining  statistical \nsignificar ce.  In  other words,  they  accept  a  5%  error  rate.  They  do  not  accept  a  p-value  above \n.05  as  sta istically  significant.  This  reflects  a  consensus  professional judgment that  an  error  rate \nabove  5%  is  too  great  for  statisticians  to  accept  an  observation  as  significant  proof of an \nhypothesis. \n29\n1)1.  P-values  greater than  .05  but well  below  1.0  may  still  indicate  that  an  observed \ndifference  did  not  occur  by  chance.  A  p-value  of,  for  instance,  .20,  means  that  the  error  rate  is \n20%.  It  iloes  not  mean  that the  data  lack  all  meaning,  or that  a  court  should  exclude  the  data \n‘from  consideration  as  part  of a  larger body  of evidence. \n1)2.  The  adverse  impact  ratio  (“AIR”)  is  a  calculated  observed  statistic,  such  as  a \ndifferences  between  average  performance  rates  or the  difference  between  promotion  rates.  Unlike \nthe  p-val  1e,  it  is  not a  statistical  test  but  is  computed  from  observed  samples. \n1)3.  The  Fisher’s  Exact  Test  (“FET”)  compares  the  difference  between  two  promotion \nrates  to  cbtain  an  observed  outcome,  then  computes a  distribution  of probabilities  that the \nobserved  outcome  would  occur. \n1)4.  Both  Dr.  Silva  and  Dr.  Wiesen  analyzed  the  average  performance  differences \n‘between  White  and  minority  police  officers  at  the  department  level.  They  agree  that  excluding \nBoston,  taat  in  2005  there  were  statistically  significant  average  performance  differences  between \nminorities  and  White  candidates.  Dr.  Silva  and  Dr.  Wiesen  differed  in  their  results  for 2007.  Dr. \nSilva  did  not  find  a  statistically  significant  pattern  of performance  differences  at  the  department \nlevel,  bu)  Dr.  Wiesen  did.  The  principal  difference  is  that  Dr.  Wiesen  included  departments  that \ndid  not  n.ake  promotions.  The  court  accepts  Joint Exhibits  133-144  and  153-156  as  accurate \ncalculaticins  of  the  relevant results,  using  Dr.  Wiesen’s  methodology  which  the  court  finds \npersuasi\\ e,  with  the  caveats  stated  above.  The  meta-analysis  that  Dr.  Silva  and  Dr.  Wiesen  did \nmeasurec  whether the  performance  differences  favored  minorities  or  White  candidates.  It  did \nnot  consider  promotion  rate  data.  When  the  candidate  pool  is  small  and  the  selection  ratio  is \nismall,  then  it  may  not  be  possible  to  calculate,  with  statistical  certainty,  whether  average \n|  to \nperformance  differences  no  longer relate  to  or  impact  the  AIR  for  promotions. \n~  30\n| \n| \n/  B.  Methods  of Addressing  Small  Sample Size \n1)5.  Small  sample  sizes  can  make  it  hard  to  draw  conclusions  from  the  data.  When \nilooking  ét  small  populations,  adverse  impact  ratios,  standing  alone,  can  be  unstable  and \n‘misleadi ig.  For  example,  if a  department  has  only  one  minority  candidate  and  that minority  is \n\\promotec  the  adverse  impact  ratio  could  be  0.0,  whereas  if that  minority  was  not  promoted,  the \ni \n‘adverse  inpact  ratio  could  be  1.0.  Researchers  have  found  that  adverse  impact  ratios  can  be  an \nunstable  ‘est with  samples  as  large  as  200-400.  Other  factors  can  influence  the  appearance  of \nadverse  i  npact,  as  measured  by  adverse  impact  ratios.  Those  factors  include  low  selection  rates \n(the  perc:nt  of applicants  who  are  promoted)  and  a  low  percentage  of minority  representation \nwithin  a_urisdiction.  In  Massachusetts,  selection  rates  for  police  sergeant  promotions  are \ntypically  low. \n1  \"  106.  There  are  accepted  statistical  approaches  to  analyzing  small  sample  sizes.  One  of \nthose  apy roaches,  employed  by  Dr.  Silva,  is  to  disregard  the  small  samples  altogether  in  the \nabsence  f statistical  significance.  That  approach  has  the  virtue  of considering  only  results  that \nmeet  the  professional  definition  of statistical  significance.  It has  the  vice  of disregarding  large \namounts  >f data  that  have  probative  value,  particularly  when  viewed  in  the  context  of other \ncorrobors.tive  data. \n107.  Dr.  Wiesen  employed  other  methods,  including  aggregation  among  departments \nand  across  years.  He  also  considered  not  only statistical  significance,  but  also  whether  . \ncalculatic ns,  though  not statistically  significant  by  themselves,  comprised  a  body  of evidence \npointing  ‘o  aconclusion  that  could  warrant  a fact-finder  in  finding  that  a  conclusion  is  more \n‘likely  tru:  than  not true.  These  methods  generate  higher  confidence  levels,  although  they  can \nintroduce  bias  and  measure  the  relevant effect  less  directly  than  analysis  of unaggregated  data. \ni \n31\n.  | \n108.  Aggregation  of departmental  promotional  data  can  introduce  bias.  For  instance, \nfa \n \nn\na\nan Departm nts  with  no  minorities  cannot  have  any  adveise  impact  in  promotions.  Aggregation  of \nn\n  \ncandidati:s  from  nondiverse  departments  with  diverse  departments  will  impact the  White \n,  lt \npromotic nal  rate  from  the  diverse  departments  only.’  Where  the  aggregated  White  promotional \n:  | \nrate  is  in ‘lated  due  to  higher  White  promotion  rates  from  nondiverse  departments,  that  causes  the \niadverse  impact ratio  to  be  inflated.  This  concern  does  not  affect  calculations  about  the  impact of \n'the  test  itself such  as  difference  in  scores  and  passing  rates. \n| \n1)9.  Combining  candidate  level  data  across  departments  and  across  years  to  find  a \npattern  cin  create  bias.  A  failure  to  account  for  repeat  test takers  may  violate  the  assumption  of \n| \nindependence  of observations,  can  also  create  bias.  So  can  failure  to  control  for the  variable \nI \n‘selection  ratios  within  each  year.  \\ \nI \n|  L0.  The  court  rejects  Dr.  Silva’s  position  that  it  should  disregard  entirely  any  results \n| \nthat are  not  based  upon a  single  test  in  a  single  department,  after  excluding  all  departments  that \n| \nhad  no  diversity  or  made  no  promotions.  Dr.  Silva’s  approach  is  biased  in  favor  of finding  no \nidifferenc>  in  treatment  of White,  Black  and  Hispanic  candidates.  The  court  agrees  that  it  should \nt \n1 \n‘give  lowcr weight to  calculations  that  do  not  meet  the  criteria  Dr.  Silva  has  set  forth.  However, \ntit  does  not  disregard  such  results  entirely.  For  one  thing,  the  court  must  consider  the  evidence  as \ni \n'a  whole,  ziving  each  part  of the  evidence  the  weight  it  deserves.  For  another,  a strict \nrequirem :nt  of statistical  significance  discards  evidence  entirely  based  upon  an  item-by-item_ \nerror rate  exceeding  5%.  But  such  evidence  may  have  value  when  combined  with  other \n7  Agiregating departments  that made  no  promotions  with  departments  that  made  promotions  alters \nthe  promotion ratio  because  it  adds  candidates  who  had  no  chance to  be  promoted to  the  denominator \nof all  candidates  not  promoted.  This  introduces  Statisti¢al  Bias  in  both  the  white  promotional  rate and \nthe  minority  promotional  rate,  which  are  compared  to  calculate  an  adverse  impact ratio. \n32\n| \n|e  vi.d  ence  Under the  preponderance  of evi. dence  test,  thiel   plai.n tif. fs  need  to  prove  their.   case,  more \n:  | \nlikely  then  not,  upon  the  evidence  as  whole.  Moreover, Pr  Silva’s  restrictive  approach  does  not \n:  | \n1 \nfollow  the  Uniform  Guidelines,  to  which  the  court  now turns  for  guidance  in  evaluating  the \n.  sigs  :  |  .  . \nprobative  value  of the  statistical  evidence.  The  court, of  course,  recognizes  that  the  Uniform \nGuidelin:s  are  not  binding. \n.  id \nCc.  Guidelines  for Assessing  Statistics  on  Adverse  Impact \nIo \n111.  The  Uniform  Guidelines  do  not call  foria  statistically  significant  showing  when \n‘ \n‘investigating  the  existence  of adverse  impact.  Instead,'they  establish  a  rule  of thumb  known  as \nthe  “four-fifths  rule.”  Under  this  rule,  “[a]  selection  rate  for  any  race...which  is  less  than  four- \nfifths  (4/'1)  (or  eighty  percent)  of the  rate  for the  group with  the  highest  rate  will  generally  be \n‘regarded  ..as  evidence  of disparate  impact.”  29  C.F.R:  §  1607.4(D).  Thus,  an  AIR of 0.80  or \n‘less  is  reysarded  as  evidence  of adverse  impact. \n|  112.  Under the  Guidelines  (Section  4.D),  an  adverse  impact ratio  that  is  above  0.80  but \nbelow  1.1)  may  still  indicate  adverse  impact  if the  data  are  statistically  significant: \nA  selection  rate  for  any  race,  sex,  or  ethnic  group  which  is  less  than  four-fifths  (4/5)  (or \neighty  percent)  of the  rate  for  the  group  with  the  highest  rate  will  generally  be  regarded \nby  the  Federal  enforcement  agencies  as  evidence  of adverse  impact,  while  a  greater  than \nfcur-fifths  rate  will  generally  not  be  regarded  by  Federal  enforcement  agencies  as \neridence  of adverse  impact.  Smaller differences  in  selection  rate  may  nevertheless \nconstitute  adverse  impact,  where  they  are  significant  in  both  statistical  and  practical  terms \no; where  a  user's  actions  have  discouraged  applicants  disproportionately  on  grounds  of \nréce,  sex,  or  ethnic  group. \nWhile  the  Uniform  Guidelines  are  not  binding,  the  court  accepts them  as a  true  statement of what \nconstituts  “evidence  of adverse  impact  for purposes  of requiring  proof that  an  exam  is  a  valid \nmeasure  >f job  performance.” \n  \n113.  AIR  may  trigger the  four-fifths  rule  for  p-values  greater than  .05  when  samples \nare  small,  Small  sample  sizes  may  result  in  unstable  results.  In  such  cases,  a  Shift  of One \n33\n  \nanalysis  is  an  accepted  stability  analysis  to  determine  whether the  observed  AJR  of a  small \nsample  size  should  trigger validity  analysis. \n| \n3.  é,dverse  Impacts \na.  Total  Score  and  Other  Impacts \n114.  The  2005  statewide  examination  shows a statistically  significant  adverse  impact \non  minority  test  takers  with  respect to  the  multiple-choice  test  score,  the  Civil  Service  grade,  and \nthe  delay  to  promotion.  The  mean  score  difference  on  the  multiple-choice  examination  was  5.08. \nThe  mea 1 score  difference  on  the  overall  Civil  Service  grade  was  2.01.  The  mean  difference  in \ndelay  to  sxromotion  for  minority  test takers  was  -0.89,  indicating  that  it  took  minority  test  takers \nlonger  to  be  promoted  on  average. \n115.  The Boston  2005  examination  shows a statistically  significant  adverse  impact  on \nminority  test takers  with  respect  to  the  multiple-choice  test  score  and  the  Civil  Service  grade. \nThe  mean  score  difference  on  the  multiple-choice  examination  was  6.76,  a  difference  which  is \n“highly  practically  significant.”  Meanwhile,  the  mean  score  difference was 2.75  on  the  overall \nCivil  Service  grade.  Both  of these  measures  had  a  probability  value  of well  below  .001, \nindicatin;;  that the  differences  are  highly  statistically significant. \n1.6.  The  adverse  impact ratio  for the  passing  point  was  0.60,  with  71.7%  of White \napplicants  having  passed  the  exam  compared  to  43.3%  of minority  applicants,  and  the  adverse \nimpact  ratio  for  promotions  was  0.27,  with  15.0%  of White  applicants  having  been  promoted \ncomparec,  to  4.0%  of minority  applicants.  The  adverse  impact  ratios  for  the  passing  point  and  for \npromotio  1s  both  fail  the  federal  80%  rule  of thumb,  and  both  of these  measures  were  highly \nstatistically  significant,  with  probability  values  well  below  .001. \n34\n|  :  . \n|  ' \nly  + \n|  i  , \n‘  \\ \n117.  The  2006  statewide  sergeant examination  showed a  statistically  significant \nadverse  impact  on  minority  test takers  on  the  multiplechoice  portion  of the  Civil  Service \niexaminarion.  The  mean  score  difference  on  the  multiple-choice  examination  was  3.98,  a \ndifference  causing  a  lower  passing  grade  and  promotion  rate  among  minority  candidates.  The \nmultiple: choice  mean  score  difference  had  a probability  value  of well  below  .001,  indicating  that \nthe  difference  is  highly  statistically  significant.  On  the  2006  statewide  exam,  the  mean  score \n‘differences  on  the  overall  Civil  Service  grade  also  evidence  disparate  impact  on minority  test \n‘takers,  but the  differences  were  not  statistically significant. \n118.  As  with  the  2006  examination,  the  2007  statewide  sergeant  examination  showed  a \n‘statistica  ly  significant  adverse  impact  on  minority  test takers  with  respect  to  the  multiple-choice \n‘portion  af the  Civil  Service  examination.  The  minority-White  mean  score  difference  on  the \nmultiple  choice  test was  4.46,  a  difference  which  is  practically  significant.  The  multiple-choice \nmean  sccre  difference  had  a  probability  value  of well  below  .001,  indicating that the  difference  is \n‘highly  stutistically  significant.  The  mean  score  difference  on  the  overall  Civil  Service  grade  was \n275,  showing  adverse  impact on  minorities,  and  was  also  statistically  significant. \n119,  The  adverse  impact  ratio  for the  passing  point was  0.82,  with  68.2%  of White \napplicants  having  passed  the  exam  compared  to,56.2%  of minority  applicants,  and  the  adverse \nimpact ratio  for  promotions  was  0.36,  with  11.5%  of White  applicants  having  been  promoted \ncompare:|  to  4.1%  of minority  applicants.  The  adverse  impact  ratios  for the  passing  point  and  for \npromotioas  were  both  less  than  parity,  and  the  promotion  adverse  impact  ratio  fails  the  80%  rule \nof thumb.  Both  of these  measures  were  statistically  significant. \ni \n120.  The  2008  statewide  examination  also  evidenced  a statistically  significant  adverse \nimpact  gn  minority  test takers  with  respect to  the  multiple-choice  portion  of the  Civil  Service \n35\nexamina ion.  The  mean  score  difference  on  the  multiple-choice  examination  was  3.32.  The \nmean  score  difference  on  the  overall  Civil  Service grade  was  0.35.  Notably,  there  was  no  mean \nscore dif ference  for time  to  promotion  because  HRD  did  not report  any  promotions  of minorities \nfrom  the  2008  statewide  exam. \ni \n121.  On  the  2008  Boston  exam,  there  was  statistically  significant  adverse  impact  on \nithe  multiple-choice  examination  score  and  the  overall  Civil  Service  grade.  The  mean  score \n‘differenc es  were  6.90  for the  multiple-choice test  and  4.24  for  the  overall  Civil  Service  grade. \nEach  of these  measures  had  a probability  value  well  below  .001,  indicating  that the  differences \nare  highly  statistically  significant.  There  was  no  adverse  impact  data  available  with  respect to  the \ntime  to  promotion  variable  because  HRD  did  not provide  complete  data  for promotions  from \n2008  exe mination. \n;  122.  The  adverse  impact  ratio  for the  passing  point  on  the  2008  Boston  exam  was  0.81, \n‘with  93.°%  of White  applicants  having  passed  the  exam  compared  to  75.6%  of minority \napplicants,  and  the  adverse  impact  ratio  for promotions  was  0.05,  with  9.1%  of White  applicants \nhaving  b  :en  promoted  compared  to  0.5%  of minority applicants.  The  adverse  impact  ratios  for \nthe  passi  1g  point  and  for  promotions  were  both  highly  statistically  significant,  with  probability \nvalues  wll  below  .001. \n123.  On  the  2010 statewide  exam,  there  was statistically  significant  adverse  impact \nwith  respect to  the  multiple-choice  test  score,  which  had  a  mean  score  difference  of 2.63  points. \n124,  On  the  2012  statewide  exam,  there  was  statistically  significant  adverse  impact  on \n‘minority  test  takers  with  respect to  the  multiple-choice examination  component.  The  multiple- \n4 \nichoice  test had  a  mean  score  difference  of 3.96  points. \n36\nb.  Fassing  Rate  Impacts \n125.  On  the  2005  statewide  examination,  the  adverse  impact  ratio  for the  passing  point \n‘was  0.63,  with  50.6%  of White  applicants  having  passed  the  exam  compared  to  31.8%  of \n‘minority  applicants.  These  figures  fail  the  80%  rule  of thumb  in  the  Uniform  Guidelines  and  are \nstatistically  significant. \n126.  On  the  2006  statewide  exam,  the  adverse  impact  ratio  for the  passing  point was \n0.79,  with  73.7%  of White  applicants  having  passed  the  exam  compared  to  58.4%  of minority \napplicants.  The  adverse  impact  ratios  for the  passing  point  fails  the  federal  80%  rule  of thumb, \nand  was  3tatistically  significant. \n127.  For  the  2008  statewide  exam,  the  adverse  impact  ratio  for  the  passing  point  was \n0.84,  wit 1  81.5%  of White  applicants  having  passed  the  exam  compared  to  68.9%  of minority \n‘applicant s,  and  was  statistically  significant.  While the  2008  statewide  passing  point  adverse \n‘impact  re tio  passes  the  federal  80%  rule  of thumb,  it  still  indicates  adverse  impact  because  the \ndata  are  : tatistically  significant. \n128.  On  the  2010  statewide  exam,  the  adverse  impact ratio  for  the  passing  point  was \n0.51,  wit  117.6%  of White  test  takers  having  passed  and  8.9%  of minority  test  takers  having \npassed.  ““hat  adverse  impact  ratio  of 0.51,  indicated  that minorities  failed  the  exam  at  twice  the \nrate  of ncn-minorities.  That was  less  than  the  federal  80%  rule  of thumb.  Significantly,  only \nhalf the  ¢roportion  of minority  test  takers  were  potentially  eligible  for promotion  compared  to \nWhite  test takers. \n129.  On  the  2012  statewide  exam,  the  adverse  impact ratio  for  the  passing  point  was \n0.64,  with  36.7%  of White  test  takers  having  passed  and  23.5%  of minority  test  takers  having \npassed.  J'hat  ratio  is  less  than  the  federal  80%  rule  of thumb,  and  was  statistically  significant. \n37\nAgain,  this  adverse  impact  ratio  is  important  because  only  half the  proportion  of minority  test \n‘takers  were  potentially  eligible  for promotion  compared  to  White  test takers. \n|  c  Effects  on  Promotion:  Rate  of Promotion  and  Delay  in  Promotion \n! \n|  130.  On  the  2005  statewide  exam,  the  adverse  impact  ratio  for  promotions  was  0.22, \n‘with  14.0%  of White  applicants  having  been  promoted  compared  to  3.0%  of minority  applicants. \nThe  adverse  impact  ratios  for the  passing  point and  for promotions  both  fail  the  federal  80%  rule \nof thumt.  Both  of these  measures  were  statistically  significant. \n131.)  In  2005,  there  were  statistically  significant  average  performance  differences  in \npromoticns  between  minority  officers  compared  with  White  officers  using  a two-tailed  p-value. \nBoth  Dr.  Silva  and  Dr.  Wiesen  agreed  on  that point. \n132.  On  the  2006  statewide  exam,  the  adverse  impact  ratio  for  promotions  was  0.18, \nwith  14.2  %  of White  applicants  having  been  promoted  compared  to  2.6%  of minority  applicants. \n‘The  adverse  impact  ratio  for promotions  fails  the  federal  80%  rule  of thumb,  and  was  statistically \nsignificant. \n133.  On  the  2006  statewide  exam,  the  delay  to  promotion  evidenced  disparate  impact \non  minotity  test takers,  but the  differences  were  not  statistically  significant. \n134.  In  2007,  including  departments  that made  no  promotions,  there  were  statistically \nsignificait  average  performance  differences  between  minority  officers  compared  with  White \nofficers  cn  the  statewide  sergeant promotional-exam. \n135.  From  the  2008  statewide  exam,  the  adverse  impact  ratio  for promotions  for the \n2008  stat wide  examination  was  0.0,  with  2.9%  of White  applicants  having  been  promoted  and \nI \n0.0% of minority  applicants  having  been  promoted. \n38\ni \n136.  In  2009,  HRD  delegated  promotions  to municipalities  and  as  a  result,  HRD  did \n‘not  have  promotional  data  for the  2010  and  2012  statewide  promotional  exams. \nd,  Impacts  in  Municipalities  Outside  Boston \n|  137.  Impacts  in  individual  municipalities  also  occurred  outside  Boston.  For  instance, \nI \n,consider  ng  p-values  greater than  .05  proves,  more  likely  than  not,  that  an  adverse  impact  also \n1 \n;occurred in  Springfield.  The  (two-tailed)  p-value  for the  rate  of promotion  of minority \nleandidat  38  relative  to  White  candidates  within  the  Springfield  Police  Department  for the  2005 \n‘examination  was  .07.  There  is  “a  93  percent  chance  that  [the  difference  in  promotion  rates \n‘between  minority  and  White  candidates]  is  due  to  a  lack  of equality  in  ...  promotion[.]” \nSimilarly  the  p-value  for  the  promotion  rate  for the 2007  examination  in  Springfield  was  0.26, \nindicatin 3  that there  was  a  74%chance  that the  differerice  in  promotion  rates  was  due  to  lack  of \nlequality  n promotion.  Notably,  however,  aggregating  the  2005  and  2007  Springfield \nlexaminations,  neither  of which  individually  resulted  in  enough  promotions  to  yield a statistically \n‘significa  it  result,  results  in  a  statistically  significant p-value  of .04,  suggesting  that there  was  a \n96%chance  that the  difference  in  minority  and  White  promotion  rates  was  due  to  something \nother than  chance. \n138.  The  same  analysis  for  the  MBTA  Transit  Police  showed  a  pattern  that was  very \nconsistent  with  the  overall  lower  promotion  rate  for  minorities  than  for  nonminorities.” \n139.  —  Statistically  significant  mean  score  differences  individually  within  several \nmunicipalities  existed  between  2005  and  2012.  Specifically,  Dr.  Wiesen  found  statistically \nsignifica  it mean  score  differences  favoring  Whites  over  minorities  in  New  Bedford,  Randolph, \nand  Sprir gfield  in  2005,  in Brockton,  Lawrence,  and  Lowell  in  2006,  in  Brockton  and  Holbrook \nin  2008,  in  Cambridge  in  2010,  and  in  Lawrence  and  Newton  in  2012. \n\\  39\n140.  This  pattern,  extending  at  least  forty  years  into  the  past,  of low  minority  passing \nand  prorotion  rates,  is  sufficient evidence  of adverse  impact  to  require  HRD  to  produce \nAdverse  Impact Across  Years \n141,  The  statewide  and  Boston  sergeant  examinations  also  demonstrate  adverse  impact \nagainst riinority  test takers  when  results  are  aggregated  across  the  years  between  2005  and  2012. \n142.  Aggregation  of data  over time  has  the  advantage  of showing  “the  big  picture” \nregardin;  the disparate  impact  of HRD’s format. \n143.  Combining  candidate  level  data  across  departments  and  across  years  to  find  a \npattern  also  has  a  disadvantage,  because  repeat test takers  can  violate  the  assumption  of \nrindepenc ence  of observations,  and  because  selection  ratios  vary  within  each  year.  Moreover, \nania  2s  do  not  compete  with  every  other  candidate  across  the  state  for  promotions.  They  do \n‘not  need  to  be  in  the  top  15%to  be  promoted,  in  fact, promotions  were  made  at the  30\",  36\"  and \n‘54th  percentiles  of candidates,  ranked  by  score  percentile. \n144.  HRD  did  not  provide  the  information  required  to  identify  repeat test  takers.  It \nwas  ther:fore  impossible  to  remove  repeat  test takers  from  the  data.  However,  repeat  test takers \nmay  wel  generate  sufficiently  independent  observations  if they  changed  their preparation \nstrategy,  or prepared  more,  or  if the  passage  of time  gave  them  significantly  more  experience \n/upon  which  to  draw. \n145.  Rather than  ignore  aggregation  of data  over  time,  the  court  considers  this \nevidence,  albeit with  caution  and  with  the  knowledge that there  may  be  some  statistical  bias  in \njthe  resul's.\n146.  To  aggregate  data  over time,  Dr.  Wiesen'evaluated  the  rank  order placement  of \nWhite  ard  minority  candidates  statewide  between  2005  and  2012,  and  in  Boston  for  2005  and \n2008,  Hz  calculated  a  percentile  score  for each  applicant within  each  exam,  ranging  from  0  to \n100  for  cach  exam.  He  then  grouped  those  percentile  scores  for  all  examinations  and  evaluated \ntheir  distributions  by  ethnic  group.  The  percentile  scores  were  grouped  in  increments  of 5%  (i.e., \nithe  highust  scoring  5%  of test  takers,  the  next  highest  5%  scoring  test  takers,  etc.). \n;  147.  Police  departments  make  selections  for  promotions  from  the  top  candidates  in \nirank  ordur  based  on  what  is  known  as  the  2N+1  rule.’  Thus,  if relatively  few  minority  test takers \nappear  ir,  the  top  5%  or  10%  of test  takers,  it  is  far  less  likely  that a  minority  candidate will  be \npromoted  off of the  eligibility  list,  and  far  more  likely  that  minority  candidates  will  experience  a \ndelay  in  sxromotion  compared  to  White  candidates. \n148.  Both  statewide  and  for  Boston,  ranking  the  scores  by  percentiles  over  time \n' demonst ates  a  statistically  significant  adverse  impact  on  minority  test takers.  That  is,  a  clear \npattern of relatively  fewer  minorities  falling  in  the  top  5%  or  10%  of all  test  takers  compared  to \nWhite  te  it takers. \n149.  The  scores  between  2005  and  2012  show  a  pattern:  fewer  minority  test  takers \nscored  ir  the  top  5%  of scores  or  in  the  next  highest  5%  of scores.  Fewer  than  1%  of minority \ntest takes  (or  3  individuals)  scored  in  the  top  5%  of all  test takers  compared  to  5.2%  ofW hite \ntest takeis  (or  194  individuals),  and  only  2.8%  of minority  test takers  (or  11  individuals)  scored \nin  the  next  highest  5%  of scores  compared  to  5.6%  of White  test takers  (or 209  individuals). \n| \n\\°  For exe mple,  if there  are three vacancies  in  a given  municipality,  the three  candidates  selected  for \npromotion  are  chosen  from  among the top  seven  candidates  on that  municipality’s  eligibility  list.  See \n\"G.L.c.31   §  27.  . \n41\n150.  If scores  were  equally  distributed,  there would  have  been  approximately  19 \nminority  test takers  (compared  to  3)  in  the top  5%  of scores  and  22  minority  test  takers \n(compared  to  11  in  the  next  5%  of scores. \n151.  This  disparity  between  minority  and  White  applicants  is  reversed  for the  lowest \n| scori4 ng  ££ %  of test  takers.  Approximately  11.0%  ofm inority  test takers  fell  into  the  lowest \n[scoring  £%  of test takers,  but  only  4.3%  of White  test takers  fell  into  this  grouping. \n:  152.  The  Boston  results  display  a  similar pattern  of statistically  significant  adverse \nimpact when  test takers  are  aggregated  across  years.  Fewer  minority  test  takers  scored  in  the  top \n5%  of sc res  or  in  the  next  highest  5%  of scores  for the  two  Boston  examinations  combined. \nFewer  than  1%  of minority  test takers  (or 4  individuals)  scored  in  the  top  5%  of all test takers \n‘compare 1  to  7.6%  of White  test  takers  (or  50  individuals),  and  only  1.8%  of minority  test takers \n‘(or  8  ind viduals)  scored  in  the  next  highest  5%  of scores  compared  to  7.0%  of White  test takers \nc 46  in Jividuals). \n153.  An  equal  distribution  in  the  top  two  groupings  for  Boston  would  have \napproxiniately  22  minority  test takers  (compared  to  4)  in  the  top  5%  of scores  and  22  minority \ntest takeis  (compared  to  8)  in  the  next  5%  of scores. \n154,  This  disparity  between  minority  and  white  applicants  in  Boston  is  reversed  for  the \nlowest  scoring  5%  of test  takers.  Approximately  8.7%  of minority  test takers  fell  into  the  lowest \nscoring  £%  of test takers,  but only  2.4%  of White  test takers  fell  into  this  grouping.  In  general, \n‘the  lowe it  eight percentile  groupings  had  relatively  more minority  test  takers  and  fewer White \ntest  takeis,  while  the  eight  highest  percentile  groupings  had  relatively  more  White  test takers  and \n| \n1 \n|  oo  i \n|fewer  minority  test takers.  ' \n42  ‘  ‘\nha \nHistorical  Pattern  of Disparate  Impact \n155.  The  Uniform  Guidelines  (Section  4.D)  also  contemplate  establishing  adverse \nimpact  by  looking  at  historical  patterns: \nWhere  the  user's  evidence  concerning  the  impact  of a  selection  procedure \nindicates  adverse  impact  but  is  based  upon  numbers  which  are  too  small  to  be \nreliable,  evidence  concerning  the  impact  of the  procedure  over  a  longer period  of \ntime  and/or  evidence  concerning the  impact  which  the  selection  procedure  had \n\\  when  used  in  the  same  manner  in  similar  circumstances  elsewhere  may  be \n‘  considered  in  determining  adverse  impact. \n156.  Even  for  a jurisdiction  where  numbers  are  too  small  to  obtain  a  statistically \n‘significa at measure  of adverse  impact,  an  historical  pattern,  over three  or  more  years,  reflecting \nlow  rate:  of minority  promotions,  would  suffice  to  require  evidence  of test  validity. \n157,  Joint  Exhibit 266  documents  a  long  pattern  of HRD  administering  examinations \nthat  have  had  a  disparate  impact  on  minority  candidates  within  Boston  and  the  Commonwealth. \n158.  In  1970,  the  City  of Boston’s  written  police  officer  examination  resulted  in \npassing  1 ates  of 25%  for  Black candidates  and  10%  for  Spanish-surnamed  candidates,  compared \nto  65%  cf  White  candidates.  See  Castro  v.  Beecher,  334  F,  Supp.  930,  942  (D.  Mass,  1971). \nThis  resulted  in  passing  rate  adverse  impact  ratios  of 0.38  for  black  candidates  and  0.15  for \nSpanish- surnamed  candidates. \n159.  In  1974,  HRD  administered  an  examination  for the  Boston  Police  Department  in \nwhich  only  8% of Black  police  officers  who  took  the  exam  (comprising  only  2  individuals)  were \npromotej  to  sergeant,  while  17%  of White  officers  who  took  the  examination  (comprising  104 \nindividu  ils)  were  promoted  to  sergeant.  That  examination  had a  passing  point adverse  impact \n! \nOo  ratio  of  0.62. \n160.  In  1977,  HRD  administered  another  police  sergeant  examination  for the  Boston \nPolice  Department.  That examination  had  high  adverse  impact  at  the  passing  rate,  with  only \n1  43 \n| \n| \n1\n  \n| \n4.5%  of  3lack  test takers  passing  compared  to  16%  of White  test takers,  resulting  in  a  passing \n' \n' \n1 \npoint  adverse  impact  ratio  of 0.28. \n151.  In  1985,  Boston  and  HRD  developed  and  administered  a  validated  examination \nconsisting  of multiple  components  with  a  low  passing  point  adverse  impact  ratio  of 0.85,  which \n: passed  tte  80%  rule  of thumb.  However,  two  years  later,  Boston  reverted  to  its  old  format, \n‘resulting  a  passing  point  adverse  impact  ratio  of  0.5  on  the  1987  examination. \n152.  According to  HRD’s  1991  Validation  Report,  Boston’s  1991  examination  had \n‘adverse  inpact'on  minority  test takers  at  two  contemplated  passing  points:  0.16  at  70  points; \n0.34  at  6!)  points. \n153.  The  1991 Validation  Report also  analyzed  mean  scores  by  racial/ethnic  group. \nThe  mean  score  of minority  candidates  who  took the  1991  examination  was  considerably  lower \nthan  that  of White  candidates:  the  mean  score  difference  between  White  and  Black  candidates \nwas  11.8  points,  and  the  mean  score  difference  between  White  and  Hispanic  candidates  was  9.1 \npoints. \n104,  The  1996  sergeant  examination  had  adverse  impact  on  Black  and  Hispanic \ncandidates.  Specifically,  passing  rates  for  Black and  Hispanic  candidates  were,  respectively, \n22.73% and  26.67%,  compared  to  53.71%  for  White  candidates.  These  corresponded  to  passing \npoint  adverse  impact  ratios  of 0.42  for  Black  candidates  and  0.5  for  White  candidates. \n165.  This  pattern  of historical  adverse  impact  is  clear  at the  named  plaintiffs’ \nindividual  municipality-level  as  well.  There  were  no  minority  police  sergeant promotions  in \nWorceste:  for  14  years.  There  were  no  minority  police  sergeants  in  Brockton  from \napproximately  2000  to  2012. \n44\nIll.  Alternatives  with  less  adverse  impact  ! \n:  166.  Many  alternatives  would  have  less  impact than  a  rank-order  list  based  upon  a \n|  tote-meraory  multiple  choice  test with  80  questions. \n'  :  4 \n167.  Because  unnecessarily  large  cognitive  loads  tend  to  create  the  most  adverse \nimpact,  one  class  of alternatives  involves  reducing  the  cognitive  load. \n|  168.  Even  without  changing  the  current test format  of a  multiple-choice  examination \nplus  an  H&E  component,  HRD  could  reduce  adverse  impact  by  having  skilled  test  developers \ndesign  q sestions  that  avoid  rote  memory  answers  and  instead  test  situational judgment and  other \ntypes  of skills.  Writing  questions  in  plain  language,  instead  of using  convoluted  phrases,  likely \nwould  hi wve  a  similar  beneficial  effect. \n169.  A  simple  way  to  reduce  the  cognitive  load  is  to  use  fewer  questions.  Using  an \n| \nj  exam  with  35  questions,  rather than  80  questions,  reduces  that  cognitive  load  and  has  been \n1|  \n|  shown  to  have  less  adverse  impact. \n11  \n170.  Shortening  the  reading  list would  also  reduce  the  cognitive  load.  It  was  not \n! \n‘necessary,  for  instance,  to  include  a  600-page  Police  Administration  textbook  on  the  2008 \nreading  ‘ist,  when  the  exam  included  only  2  questions  from  that  book  on  the  statewide  exam  and \n1  question  on  the  Boston  exam. \n171.  While  knowing  certain  information  is  necessary  to  be  a  good  sergeant,  HRD \n1 \n|  could  ensure  an  adequate  base  of knowledge  by  scoring  the  written  exam  on a  pass-fail  basis. \n| \n|  HRD  or  appointing  authorities  could  then  assess  the  untested  KSAs  through  interviews, \n:  comprehensive  review  of past accomplishments  or  other  methods  to  test  and  score  a  candidate’s \n1  .  . \n|  key  lead 2rship  abilities.  If doing  so  were  deemed  too expensive  at the  statewide  level,  it  could \ni  , \nI \n|  provide  1  rank  list  to  appointing  authorities,  leaving  it'to  local  chiefs  to  assess  those  qualities. \n1  45\n172.  All  of the  above  alternatives  are  inexpensive.  Using  fewer  multiple  choice \n‘question;  may  even  save  some  test  development  costs! \n|  173.  Another  alternative  is  banding,  which  “recognizes  error  in  measurement  and \n!'   \\ \n‘creates  a  range  of observed  scores  that  are functionally  the  same.”  Letter  of March  30,  2009, \n1  1 \nfrom  Dr.  Rick Jacobs,  CEO  of E.B.  Jacobs,  to  Personnel  Administrator Diet]  (“March  2009 \n‘Letter”)  ‘regarding  “promotion  test  scoring  and  the  use  of score  banding  to  determine  candidate \nqualifications.”). \n174.  It  is  not  necessary  for HRD  to  rank  candidates  based  upon a single  point \ndifference  between  candidates.  Banding  scores  within  a  range  would  make  more  candidates \neligible  for promotion.  The  “tie-breaker”  could  be  interviews,  comprehensive  review  of past \njaccompl  shments  or  other  methods  to  test  the  key  leadership  abilities. \n175.  In  late  2008  and  2009,  HRD  decided  to  create  11-point  bands  both  statewide  and \njin  Boston  based  on a  report  from  E.B.  Jacobs,  for whom  Dr.  Silva  was  working  at the  time. \n176.  Dr.  Jacobs’  March  2009  letter pointed  out that  score  banding  systems  are  common \nand  that  ‘[i]n  schools  we  have  bands  but  call  them  grades”  such that,  for  instance,  a  score  of 93, \n95  or  97  would  all  receive  an  “A.”  He  stated: \nI  recommend  the  use  of banding,  because  by  banding  promotional  test  scores  we  are  (1) \nrecognizing  that  there  is  measurement  error,  (2)  using  the  level  of error to  determine  the \nastual  width  of the  band  and  determining  candidates  equivalent  within  that  level  of error, \naid  (3)  creating  a  poo!  of candidates,  those  with  a  band,  who  will  be  seen  as  equally \nqualified  based  on  their  test  scores  so  that  the  use  of another variable  or variables  will  be \nnzcessary  to  make  the  final  decision  among those  individuals.  In  the  context of police \naid  fire  promotional  testing  candidates  have  long  and  important job  performance  records \nugon  which  they  can  be judged.  By  relying  on  only  a  test  score  much of the  contributions \na  candidate  has  made  to  a  department  and  many  of the  abilities/competencies  they  have \ndeveloped  relating  to  the  next  level job  may  not  be  considered  in  the  promotional \nprocess.  With  banding  candidates  who  are equally  qualified  based  on  exam  performance \ncan  then  be  further  considered  based  on  other  important job  relevant characteristics. \n46\n1 \n| \nI  |  ! \n177.  HRD  received  a  banding  proposal  fromE.B.  Jacobs  on  January  21,  2009.  At  least \n‘internally ',  HRD’s  Director  of its  Organizational  Development  Group  reported  that  “According  to \nour  expe;ts,  banding  is  considered  a  best  practice.  The  scheme  that they  have  developed  for us  is \n  \nbased  on scientific  testing  standards  and  is  valid  and  defensible.” \n178.  Dr.  Jacobs’  March  2009  Letter  and  HRD’s  own  proposals  and  internal  writings \nla \n|demonstrate  that  it  knew  by  late  2008  or by  2009  that  its  police  promotional  examinations  lacked \n.sufficien : validity  to  be  used  in  rank  order  fashion,  without  banding,  despite  using  them  in  such \nfashion  for all  in-basket  exercises  and  incident  command  exercises  of the  years  at  issue  in  this \n‘case. \n179.  |  The  addition  of components  designed  to  test  skills  other than  technical  knowledge \nresults  in  much  greater validity  in  an  examination  process.  Methods  that  increase  validity  and \n[fserssse  adverse  impact  include  assessment  centers,  structured  oral  interviews,  written  exercises, \ncareer beards,  in-basket  exercises  and  incident  command  exercises,  and  tactical  exercises. \n| \n130.  Subordinate  role-play  or  a  citizen  meeting  or  group  meeting  may  improve  adverse \njimpact,  cepending  upon  the  weight  of the  components;  the  other  components,  and  the  different \n‘knowled, 3es  and  areas  that the  overall  exam  covers. \n;  131.  Other  components  of a  police  promotional  exam,  such  as  oral  assessment  centers \niexercises  that  focus  on  how  a  candidate  might  orally  respond  to  a  situation,  can  have \nsignificantly  less  adverse  impact. \n132.  The  assessment  of certain  nonwritten  skills,  such  as  leadership,  conscientiousness, \njcalmness  under  pressure,  decision-making,  interpersonal  skills,  and  oral  communication  tend  to \n! \nhave  low  or  no  adverse  impact.  As  Ms.  Fitzgibbons  testified,  these  skills  cannot  be  tested  on  a\n| \n:  multiple-choice  rote  memory  examination,  but  can  be  tested  through  additional  assessment \ncompon:nts. \n183.  There  is  ample  scholarly  literature  in  the  field  of industrial  psychology  stating that \n_adverse  mpact  can  be  sig nificantly  lowered  by  utilizing  additional  assessment exercises  that \n_more  clcsely  mirror the  actual  duties  of the job.  The  literature  also  shows  that  assessment \ncenters  i icrease  validity  because  they  increase  the  representativeness and  the  fidelity  of the \nexamina ‘ion  processes. \n184.  These  techniques  are  in  use  including  by  experts  in  this  case  including  Dr. \nRalfilsor , Dr.  Silva  and  his  firm  E.B.  Jacobs,  and  Dr.  Outtz. \n185.  Prior  to  the  exams  in  this  case,  HRD  and  municipalities  under  its jurisdiction \nproposec  alternatives  to  reduce  adverse  impact. \n136.  The  1985  Boston  exam  included  an  assessment  center component  in  addition  to \nmultiple-choice  and  E&E  components.  The  passing  point  adverse  impact  ratio  for  minority \nicandidatus  on  the  1985  Boston  exam  was  .85, \n137.  The  2002  Boston  sergeant’s  exam,  which  included a  structured  interview \ncomponent  in  addition  to  multiple-choice  and  E&E  components,  had  a  promotion  rate  adverse \nimpact ratio  for Black  candidates  of .327  with  the  structured  interview  component,  and  an \nadverse  impact  ratio  of .322  without  the  structured  interview  component.  The  2002  Boston  exam \n! \nhad  a  promotion  rate  adverse  impact  ratio  for  Hispanic  candidates  of .270  with  the  structured \ninterview  component,  and  an  adverse.impact ratio  of .133  without the  structured  interview \ncomponeiit. \n| \nt \nt \n| \n48\n,  188.,  The  2002  Boston  exam  with  the  structurI  ed  interview  component  resulted  in  one . \naddition  11  promotion  of a  Hispanic  candidate,  and  no  additional  promotions  of Black  candidates, \ncompared  to  the  exam  without  structured  interview  component. \n189.  HRD  has  argued  that  development  of small,  medium,  and  large  department job \nanalyses  would  require  HRD  to  administer  four different job  analyses  could  take  6  months  to  a \nyear.  It  contends  that  a  statewide  assessment  center would  be  a  massive  logistical  effort  in  a very \nshort period  of time  that  would  require  multiple  consulting  firms  to  accomplish.  These  cost \n:  consider ations  apply  to  some,  but  not  all,  of the  alternatives  discussed  above.  Whatever the  law \nion  consideration  of cost,  and  whatever  HRD’s  budgetary  constraints,  there  are  alternatives, \n‘discussed  above,  that  have  no  or  minimal  cost  impact, \n190.  Moreover,  HRD  has  overstated  the  costs  involved.  One  study,  discussed  in  Lopez \nh  found  ‘hat the  utility  of an  assessment  center ranged  ‘from  about  $500  to  $3,000  per  candidate. \n‘More  significantly,  HRD’s  cost  concerns  fail  to  account for  cost-saving  strategies.  For  instance, \n‘it  is  com  non  to  implement  work  simulations,  roleplaying  exercises,  and  subordinate  exercises \n;via  videc  presentation  rather  than  live  in-person. \n‘  1)1.  Even  if some  multi-component processes  might  impose some  additional  cost,  they \n‘also  result  in  benefits,  including  the  appointment  of more  qualified  and  diverse  police  sergeants. \n‘Having  riore  qualified  supervisors  can  avoid  other  financial  costs,  such  as  lawsuits  alleging  civil \nrights  viclations.  Intrinsic  benefits  also  resulting  from  greater  minority  representation  in  the \nranks  of  police  sergeants  by,  for  instance,  generating  a  corps  of sergeants  that  reflects  the \ncommun  ties  they  are  policing  and  creating  a  greater  pool  of minorities  for  higher  level  positions. \n'\nIV.  HRD’s  Knowledge \n192.  The  above  also  establishes  HRD’s  knowledge,  for  years  before  and  during \nadministcation  of the  challenged  tests,  of its  format’s  adverse  impacts,  the  tests’  substantial  lack \nof job-relatedness,  and  the  availability  of alternative  methods  with  less  adverse  impact.  The \ncourt  suj:plements  that  discussion  with  some  additional findings. \n;  193.  Historical  materials  in  evidence,  including  case  law,  verified  complaints,  and \n‘expert reports  relating to  prior  to  the  exams  at  issue,  as  well  as  an  HRD  2006  report pertaining to \nthe  2005  Boston  exam  results  prove  HRD’s  awareness  of the  disparate  impact  of its  practice  of \n‘creating  cank-order  lists  generated  by  rote-memory  multiple  choice  exams.  Indeed,  HRD \nacknowl  :dged  and  tried  to  remedy  these  disparities  prior  to  the  exams  in  this  case.  It  has  known \nfor  over  50  years  that the  format  for the  written  portion  of its  police  sergeant  promotional \n‘examina’  ions  was  not  based  upon  any  valid  scientific  analysis  or assessment  of the  skills  and \nabilities  1ecessary  to  perform  well  as  a  police  sergeant. \n134,  Beginning  in  the  1970s,  a  series  of lawsuits,  court  decisions,  and  expert  and  self- \n‘analysis  »y  HRD  proves  that  HRD  knew  that  its  written  multiple-choice  police  sergeant \npromotic nal  examinations  had  an  adverse  impact  on  minority  candidates  and  were  not \nsufficien ‘ly job-related  as  to  be  valid  measures of job  qualifications.  Indeed,  HRD’s  own \ninternal  1eports  and  records  dating  back  to  at  least  1991  demonstrate  that  HRD  has  long \n,possesse.i  such  knowledge. \n195.  The  data  established  that  minority  police  officers  who  took  the  1974  and  1977 \nBoston  Folice  Department  sergeant’s  examinations  suffered  statistically  significant  adverse \n‘impact.  or  example,  8%  of Black  police  officers  who  took the  1974  Boston  Police  Department \n/Sergeant’s  examination  (comprising  only  2  individuals)  were  promoted  to  sergeant,  while  17%  of \n'  50\n|  :|   | \n|  White  officers  who  took the  examination  (comprising}l 04  individuals)  were  promoted  to \n‘sergeant,  The  1977  Boston  Police  Department  sergait examination  had  similar adverse  impact \nat  the  passing  rate,  with  only  4.5%  of Black  test takers  passing  compared  to  16%  of White  test \ntakers, \n;  196.  In  1985,  in  connection  with  a  1980  consent  decree,  HRD  and  the  City  of Boston \nutilized  en  outside expert  consulting  firm  to  develop  a  valid  multi-component  exam  for  Boston. \n‘Plaintiff  ’  expert,  Dr.  Wiesen,  who  was  then  working  for  the  Commonwealth  as  an  industrial \npsycholc gist,  oversaw this  process  in  part.  According  to a  letter by  the  then-personnel \nadminist-ator,  David  Haley,  the  process  was  successful,  as  the  examination  had  a passing  point \nadverse  impact  of only  .85,  which  resulted  in  many  Black  candidates  becoming  eligible  for \npromoticn.  ' \n;  197.  In  1988,  the  Civil  Service  Commission ruled  that the  written  multiple-choijcoeb  \n'knowled  ze  test,  even  when  combined  with  the  E&E  component,  was  not a  fair  or  reliable  test  of \n‘the  skills  and  abilities  necessary  for the job  of police  lieutenant  because  it  could  not  assess  one  of \n‘the  most  important  aspects  of the job:  supervisory  ability. \n198.  As  reported  in  HRD’s  1991  Validation  report,  the  adverse  impact  ratio  for the \n1991  Bo:iton  Police  examination  for the  passing  score  of 70  was  0.16.  The  1991  Validation \nReport  a.so  analyzed  mean  score  differences  between  minorities  and  Whites.  The  mean  score \n[difference  between  White  and  Black  candidates  was  1  1.8  points,  and  the  mean  score difference \nibetween  White  and  Hispanic  candidates  was  9.1  points.  These  results  were  statistically \n4 \nsignificant.  ' \n| \n|  199.  In  1992,  HRD  administered  another sergeant’s  promotional  examination  both  for \ni \n'Boston  aad  statewide  which  had  significant  adverse  impact.  As  a result  of the  1992  examination, \n.  : \n! \nI  51 \n|\n| \nthe  City  of Boston,  with  HRD’s  approval,  sought to  promote  a  number  of minority  candidates  to \nthe positi on  of sergeant  out  of order,  contending  that they  were  equally  qualified  and  that  the \nfailure  to promote  candidates  out  of order  would  result  in  significant  adverse  impact.  The  Civil \nService  Commission,  however,  held  that  departure  from  strict  rank  order was  unauthorized. \n200.  A  number  of experts  have  warned  HRD  that  its  police  sergeant  promotional \nexaminat.ons  were  not  valid,  particularly  when  used  to  make  selections  in  rank  order  fashion. \nHRD  agr ed  that without  banding,  the test results  would  continue  to  have  a  disparate  impact on \nminority  2andidates. \n201.  In  1996,  HRD  administered  another multiple-choice  sergeant’s  examination \nstatewide  and  within  Boston.  Both  the  examinations  produced  statistically  significant  adverse \nimpact.  Cotter v.  City  of Boston,  193  F,  Supp.  2d  323  (D.  Mass.  2002),  aff'd  in  part  and  rev’d  in \npart Cotter  v.  City  of Boston,  323  F.3d  160  (1st  Cir.  2003) \n202.  Accordingly,  the  MBTA,  with  HRD’s  approval,  used  a  separate  minority \npromotio;:  list  in  order to  promote  several  minority  candidates.  As  of  1996,  minorities \nrepresenti:d  27.6% of patrol  officers  in  the  MBTA  police  (fifty  officers  out  of  181),  but  only  one \n_  Sergeant  cut  of fourteen  was  a  minority.  If the  1996  promotions  had  been  made  in  strict  rank \norder,  no  Black  candidates  would  have  been  promoted  and  the  proportion  of minority  sergeants \nwould  ha‘re  dropped  to  only  4%  (i.e.,  one  minority  sergeant). \n2(3.  In  2006,  HRD  issued  a  report  discussing  and  analyzing  results of the  2005  police \nsergeant  promotional  examination  for the  Boston  Police  Department.  According  to  the  report, \nthe  mean  score  difference  for White  and  Black  candidates  was  7.09,  which  was  statistically \nsignificant.  The  passing  point adverse  impact  ratio  between  Black  and  Hispanic  candidates  on \nthe  one  hind,  and  White  candidates  on  the  other,  was  0.59,  which  fails  the  federal  80%  rule  of \n52\n;  thumb.  ‘The  report  concluded  that,  “Overall  race  appears  to  be  a  factor  in  performance  results \n‘with  White  applicants  outperforming  Black,  Hispanic,.and  Native  American  applicants.” \n204.  In  2006,  HRD’s  statewide  police  sergeant promotional  examination  had  a passing \npoint  adverse  impact ratio  of 0.75,  again  failing the  federal  80%  rule  of thumb.  HRD  reported \nthe  pass: fail  results  of that  examination,  indicating  its  awareness  of adverse  impact. \n205.  In  2008,  HRD  summarized  promotional  data  from  the  2006  statewide \nexamina ion.  All  of the  individuals  promoted  from  that  examination  were  White,  resulting  ina \npromotion  adverse  impact  ratio  of 0.0, \n206.  Cities  throughout the  Commonwealth  submit  so-called  “Form  67s”,  which  list  the \nnumber of minorities  in  various  public  safety  positions,  to  HRD  every  year.  The  Form  67  for the \n‘city  of Brockton  demonstrated  that  despite  its  large  minority  population  there  were  no  minority \npolice  sergeants  in  Brockton  in  2006. \n207.  Between  approximately  1987  and  2001—a  period  of  14  years—there were  no \nminority  police  sergeant  promotions  in  Worcester.  In  the  Brockton  Police  Department  from \n1996  to  :!019  there  were  no  minority  police  sergeants  from  approximately  2000  to  2012. \n208.  Thus,  when  it administered  and  scored  the  exams  at  issue,  HRD  unequivocally \nknew  thet  rote-memory  multiple  choice  exams  that  generate a  list,  ranked  in  order  of scores, \nsystematically  affects  Black  and  Hispanic  candidates  adversely  compared  to  White  candidates. \nIt  knew that  its  rank  order  lists  and  that  administration:and  scoring  had a  significant  disparate \nlimpact  oa  Black  and  Hispanic  police  officers  seeking  promotion  to  sergeant.  It  knew  that this \nimpact  reduced  the  number  of promotions  to  sergeant  in  large  departments  and  was  likely  to  do \nso  in  smaller  departments even  though  it  is  very  difficult  to  realize  in  which  small  department(s) \n‘the  impa:t  would  occur  in  any  given  year. \n53\nDISCUSSION \nSection  4(4A)  (“Section  4A”)  of G.L.  c.  151B  prohibits  “interfere[nce]  with  .  .  .  the \nexercise  or  enjoyment  of any  right  granted  or  protected  by  this  chapter,”  including  the  right  to  be \nfree  fron:  discrimination  in  the terms,  conditions,  and  privileges  of employment.  At  issue,  in  this \n_case,  are  claims  of interference  with  the  right  to  equal  opportunities  for  promotion  without \n‘discrimination  on  the  basis  of race,  color,  or  national  origin. \nThe  word  “interfere” 99  66 “implies  some  form  of intentional  conduct,”  but  does  not  require  “a \nspecific  ntent  to  discriminate.”  Lopez  I],  463  Mass.  at  708-709. \n[.:A]n  interference  claim  under  [G.L.  c.  151B,]  §  4  (4A)  may  be  established  by  evidence  of \ndisparate  impact.  Because  discrimination  based  on  proof of disparate  impact  does  not \nr:quire  proof of discriminatory  intent,  the  element  of intentionality  is  satisfied  where  it  is \nsiown  that  a  defendant knowingly  interfered  with  the  plaintiffs'  right to  be  free  from \ndiscrimination  in  the  terms,  conditions,  and  privileges  of employment  on  the  basis  of a \nprotected  category  such  as  race,  color,  or  national  origin.  Thus,  to  make  out  a  prima  facie \nclaim  under  §  4  (4A)  based  on  a  disparate  impact  theory of liability,  a  plaintiff must \nallege  facts  that,  if proved,  would  establish  that  (1)  a  defendant  utilized  specific \nemployment  practices  or  selection  criteria  knowing  that the  practices  or  criteria were  not \nreasonably  related  to job  performance;  and  (2)  a  defendant knew  that the  practices  or \nc;iteria  had  a  significant  disparate  impact  on  a  protected  class  or  group. \nId.  463  Mass.  at  711.  Based  upon  the  court’s  findings  set  forth  above,  the  plaintiffs  have  proven \nthat,  more  likely  than  not,  HRD  has  interfered  with  their  rights  to  an  equal  opportunity  for \npromotic  n  to  police  sergeant  without racial  or  national  origin  discrimination. \nL  Knowing  Use  of Practices  Not  Reasonably  Related  to  Job  Performance \na.  Disparate  Impact \nFirst,  the  plaintiffs  must  show that  the  challenged  employment practice  had  a  significant \n‘disparate  impact  “on  promotional  opportunities  for employees  of a  particular  race,  color,  or \ninational  origin.”  Lopez  IT,  463  Mass.  at  709.  Disparate  impact  “involve[s]  employment \n54\n‘practices  that  are  facially  neutral  in  their treatment of different  groups,  but  that  in  fact fall  more \n-harshly  cn  one  group  than  another.”  Id.  (citation  and  internal  quotations  omitted). \nE!RD’s  format  had  a  significant  disparate  impact  on  Black  and  Hispanic  police  sergeant \npromotion  candidates  on  three  separate  grounds: \n(.)  There  is  statistically  significant proof of disparate  racial  and  national  origin  impact  on \npromotions  in  a  number  of municipalities  where  promotions  were  made  and  there  were \nE  lack  or  Hispanic  candidates  or  both.  1 \n(:)  The  court  infers  impact  on  promotions  from  the  statewide  disparity  in  scores  and \n'  passing  rates,  coupled  with  the  lack  of job-relatedness. \n(})  There  are  data  sets  that  lack  statistical  significance  considered  separately,  but  point \nc nsistently  to  adverse  impact  on  promotions  of Black  and  Hispanic  candidates \nWhile  each  of these  grounds  independently  supports  this  court’s  inference  of adverse  impact, \nthey  powerfully  reinforce  each  other when  considered  together.  See  Smith  v.  City  of Bos.,  144. \nF.Supp.id  177,  194  (D.  Mass.  2015)  (‘The  Court  will  therefore  consider  all  of  the  factors  that \n‘Dr.  Wiesen  statistically  analyzed:  promotion  rates,  pass-fail  rates,  average  scores,  and  delays  in \n' promotic n.”);  Bradley  v.  City  of Lynn,  443  F.Supp.2d  145,  158  (D.  Mass.  2006)  (considering \n‘multiple  data  points  beyond  mere  hiring  rates). \nThe  court  now  turns  to  each  of these  grounds  in  more  depth. \nFirst,  some  results  are  statistically  significant,  standing  alone.  In  2005  and  2008,  the  City \n-of Bosto 1  had  statistically  significant  adverse  impact  in  promotions  of Black  and  Hispanic \nofficers.  On  the  2005  statewide test,  there  were  statistically  significant  average  performance \ndifferences  between  minority  officers  compared  with  White  officers  using  a  two-tailed  p-value. \n‘Both  Dr.  Wiesen  and  Dr.  Silva  found  statistically  significant  disparate  impact  in  minority-White \n_performé nce  on  several  of the  examinations  at  issue  in this  case  at the  municipal  level  including \nBoston,  andolph,  Springfield,  and  Brockton.  It  is  likely  no  accident that these  statistically \n‘significa 1t results  occur  in  large  sample  sizes.  Where  large  data  sets  permit  high  confidence \n55\ni \ncalculations,  the  inherent tendency  of HRD’s  exams  to  cause  adverse  impact  becomes \nstatistically  certain.  The  absence  of statistical  significance  in  other  data  sets  most  likely  reflects \nthe  samr le  size,  rather  than  the  absence  of embedded  racial  and  national  origin  discrimination. \nThe  other  evidence  in  this  case  persuades  the  court  that HRD’s  format  interfered  with  the \nplaintiff’  rights  in  contexts  that  did  not  meet  strict  criteria  for  statistical  significance. \nSecond,  disparate  impacts  at  certain  stages  of the  selection  process  support  an  inference \nof adver.ie  impact  on  promotions  of Black  and  Hispanic  candidates. \n‘The  Supreme  Judicial  Court  has  recognized  the  inference  that  may  flow  from  disparities \nin  examination  results,  coupled  with  proof that the  exam  does  not predict job  performance: \nI:  was  not  necessary  that  the  plaintiffs  allege  that use  of the  division's  examination  led  to \na  disparate  impact  on  promotions  in  any  particular,  identified,  employing  municipality  in \ncrder to  state  an  interference  claim  under  §  4  (4A).  An  allegation  that  a  Statewide \nexamination  has  been  shown  to  disproportionately  disadvantage  African-American  and \nFlispanic  candidates,  and  is  not  a  predictor  of job  performance,  implies  that  use  of the \nexamination  will  have  a  disparate  impact  on  the  employment  opportunities  of at.  least \nsome  African-American  and  Hispanic  police  officers  within  the  Commonwealth,  by \n|  miting  the  number  of qualified  African-American  and  Hispanic  candidates  among \nvehom  individual  municipalities  using  the  examination  might  seek  to  make  promotions. \nLopez  I], 463  Mass.  at  712.  As  a  matter  of law,  then,  the  inference  of “disparate  impact  on  the \nemployr.ient  opportunities  of at  least  some  African-American  and  Hispanic  police  officers  within \nthe  Commonwealth”  follows  from  logic  and  common  sense. \nThe  Commonwealth  reads  this  passage  as  applying  only  to  the  pleadings  stage,  and \n_  addressi  1g  only  the  sufficiency  of allegations  in  the  complaint.  It  maintains  that,  when  it  comes \nto  trial,  the  plaintiffs’  burden  includes  proving  a  disparate  impact  on  promotions  in  specific \n|  municip ilities,  To  be  sure,  in  Lopez  II,  the  Supreme  Judicial  Court only  considered  the \n,  adequac:/  of the  complaint.  But,  to  withstand  dismissal  for  failure  to  state  a  claim,  the  complaint \nmust  set  forth  “factual  ‘allegations  plausibly  suggesting  (not merely  consistent with)’  an \n36\nientitleme  nt to  relief,  in  order to  ‘reflect[]  the  threshold  requirement  of [Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.]  8(a)(2) \nthat the  ‘slain  statement’  possess  enough  heft to  ‘sho[w]  that  the  pleader  is  entitled  to  relief.’” \nlannacch  no  v.  Ford  Motor  Co.,  451  Mass.  623,  636  (2008),  quoting  Bell Atl.  Corp.  v.  Twombly, \n550  U.S.  544,  127  S.  Ct.  1955,  1966  (2007).  It would  be  odd  to  hold  the  complaint  sufficient, \nwithout  an  alleged  disparate  impact  on  promotions  in  any  particular municipality,  and  then  to \nrequire  pi  oof of that  unalleged  fact.  That  reading  also  seems  inconsistent  with  the  Supreme \nJudicial  Court’s  statement  about  inferences  that  may  be  drawn  from  statewide  analysis,  coupled \nwith  proc f that the  exam  fails  to predict job  performance.  In  any  event,  the  plaintiffs  have  met \ntheir  burc en  of persuasion  on  either reading  of Lopez. \nThe  court  draws  an  inference  of discrimination  here.  The  chain  of logic  is  simple: \nHRD’s  fe rmat  produces  a  rank-order  list with  an  adverse  impact  in  scoring  and  passing  rate.  It \ncirculates  that  list  for  use  by  appointing  authorities  in  promoting  police  officers  to  sergeant.  The \nemployer  uses  the  biased  list  of test  scores,  in  rank  order,  to  decide  who  gets  promoted.  There  is \nno  process  to  purge  the  list  of bias  when  promotions  occur.  With  an  adverse  impact  in  the \nscoring,  f assing  rate  and  rank  order,  an  adverse  impact  upon  promotions  based  upon  HRD’s  list \nis  highly  ikely.  To  be  sure,  it  is  not  always  easy  or  even  possible  to  identify  which  promotions \nin  which  : nunicipalities  reflect this  bias,  but the  plaintiffs  do  not  have  to  prove  their  case  with \nsuch  specificity. \nThird,  there  are  additional  facts  and  calculations  that,  while  not  statistically  significant  in \nthemselves,  collectively  demonstrate  in  convincing  fashion  the  adverse  impact  of  HRD’s  format \nupon  the  plaintiff class.  This  additional  evidence  largely  falls  into  two,  sometimes  overlapping, \n|  . \ncategories  :  (1)  data  sets  that  fail  the  Uniform  Guidelines’  four-fifths  rule  and  therefore  call  for \ni \n57\ndemonst:ation  of test validity and  (2)  small  data  sets that,  when  considered  with  other  such  sets, \n|  show  a  consistent trend  of adverse  impact.  |  | \n;  E,ased  upon  adverse  impact ratios,  there  is  a  long  pattern  of disparate  impact  on  minority \ncandidat 2s  from  HRD’s  examinations.  See  Brackett v.  Civil  Service  Commission,  447  Mass. \n233,  246  (2006)  (regarding  the  discriminatory  effects  of HRD’s  examination  in  the  1990s,  “If the \nMBTA  tad  based  its  promotion  decisions  on  strict  rank  order...[n]o  black  officers  would  have \nbeen  promoted  to  fill  any  of the  seven  sergeant positions.”),  Exhibit 266  details  adverse  impact \n‘ratios  be,ow  0.80  for  15  exams  from  1970  to  2009  for the  passing  point  and  an  adverse  impact \n‘ratio  of (.0  for promotions  from  the  statewide  police  sergeant  exam  in  2006.  Additional  pass-fail \nadverse  impact ratios  below  0.80  also  occurred  in: \ne  2010  statewide,  accompanied  by  as tatistically  significant  difference  in  scores \naccording  to  one-sided  p-value  and  a  two-sided p-value just  outside  statistical \nsignificance  (0.066). \ne  2012  statewide,  accompanied  by a  statistically  significant  difference  in  scores \nand  in  pass-fail  rates. \nBy  2008  HRD  provided  promotional!  data  on  a  spotty  basis  and  by  2010,  no  longer  made \npromotic nal  data  available,  making  assessments  of adverse  impact  ratios  for  promotions \nimpossit le.  The  Court  nevertheless  finds  persuasive  evidence  under the  Uniform  Guidelines  of \nboth'the  2xams’  tendency  and  the  reality  of adverse  impact.  Because  HRD  knew these  results,  it \n‘also  tends  to  show  HRD’s  knowledge  of adverse  impact. \n|  Moreover, for the  vast majority  of scoring,  passing  and  promotion  rates  that  are  not \nstatistically  significant,  there  is  a  consistent  pattern:  they  tend  strongly  to  point  in  the  direction  of \nadverse  impact  upon  Black  and  Hispanic  candidates.  For  instance,  on  the  2005  statewide  exam, \n58\nout  of  I¢  police  departments,  14  had  scoring  differences  between  groups  that  favored  White \ncandidat s  over  minority  candidates.  The  overall pattern  was  highly  statistically  significant  (p  = \n0.002).  Similar  statistically-significant  differences  occurred  on  the  2006,  2007,  2008,  and  2012 \nstatewidi:  exam,  with  the  2010  statewide  exam  falling just  outside  of statistical  significance  (p = \n0.072).  ‘Ither  aggregations  within  departments  and  over multiple  exam-years  tell  the  same  story. \nFor  instance,  over the  years,  a disproportionate  number  of White  test-takers fell  within  the  top \npercentil2  groupings  (measured  in  approximate  5%  increments)  compared  to  minority  test takers. \nThe  numbers  are  reversed  for the  bottom  percentiles.  This  trend  holds  both  for Boston  exams \nand  statewide  testing.  The  trend  is  important,  because  police  departments  promote  from  the  top \nof the  lis:.  Disparate  impact  in  promotions  is  therefore  highly  likely,  even  where  it  is  not \npossible  to  prove  to  a  statistical  certainty  that  a  particular promotion  resulted  from  the  unequal \ndistribution. \nThe  Supreme  Judicial  Court  cited  aggregate  data  in  Lopez  IJ.  See  463  Mass,  at  712  n.20, \n714n.23  In  Tatum,  the  Appeals  Court  stated  that the  SJC  “sanctioned  the  use  of significant \nStatewid>   statistics  to  show  disparate  impact.”  2020  WL  4200865  at  *1  n.5.  See  Bradley,  443 \nF.Supp.2d  at  149  (statistical  evidence  showed  adverse  and  disparate  impact).?  Whether  or not \nthe  SJC  : tatements  are  “dicta,”  this  court  is  bound  to  follow what  the  SJC  and  Appeals  Court \nsay,  not just  what  may  narrowly  qualify  as  a  holding. \nThe  non-binding  Uniform  Guidelines  also  provide  assistance  in  evaluating  the  statistical \nevidence  They  specifically  approve  of the  practice  of aggregation: \nbp  The  Corimonwealth cites  LopezI  for the  proposition that “a municipality’s  promotions  should  be \nlassessed  \\vith  respect to  the  pool  of candidates  actually  available  for appointment to  rank  of sergeant.  \n[What  advrse  impact,  if any  the test might  have  with respect to  another  municipality’s  candidate  pool i is \njsimply  not relevant.”  2014  WL  12978866  at *10.  When  HRD is the  defendant, this court disagrees, \n‘because  a 3gregate  data have  probative  value in  showing  adverse  impact  resulting from  a testing bias  that \nloperates  i 1  all  municipalities  and  likely  produces  biased  promotions  in at  least some  municipalities. \n599,\n  \nWhere  the  user’s  evidence  concerning  the  impact  of a  selection  procedure  indicates \nadverse  impact but  is  based  upon  numbers  which  are  too  small  to  be  reliable,  evidence \nconcerning  the  impact  of the  procedure  over  a  longer  period  of time  and/or  evidence \nconcerning  the  impact which  the  selection  procedure  had  when  used  in  the  same  manner \ni.  similar  circumstances  elsewhere  may  be  considered  in  determining  adverse  impact. \n29  C.F.F..  §  1607.4(D);  see  also  Uniform  Guidelines  Q&A,  44  Fed.  Reg.  11999-12000  (1979) \n(Q27:  “I; the  test  is  administered  and  used  in  the  same  fashion  for  a  variety  of jobs,  the  impact of \nthat test  :an  be  assessed  in  the  aggregate.”).  For  smal!  data  sets,  the  Uniform  Guidelines  also \n‘supports waluating  adverse  impact by  analyzing  patterns  of adverse  impact over time.  See \n‘Uniform  Guidelines  Q&A,  44  Fed,  Reg.  11999-12000  (1979)  (Q21:  “if'a  lower  selection  rate \ncontinued  over  a  period  of time,  so  as  to  constitute  a  pattern,  then  the  lower  selection  rate  would \n‘constitut2  adverse  impact...”). \nTo  be  sure,  the  relationship  between  test scores and  any  given  promotion  is  not  a  direct \none.  It  depends  on  many  things,  including  individual  candidate  performance.  It  also  turns  on  the \ndepartment’s  selection  rate,  which  is  the  number of vacancies  it  is  seeking  to  fill  through  a \npromotic n.  Fully  aware  of these  complexities,  the  SJC  held  that “employment procedures  or \ntesting  m echanisms  that  operate  as  ‘built-in  headwinds’  for  minority  groups”  can  establish \nadverse  impact  even  absent discriminatory  intent.  Lopez  IJ,  463  Mass.  at  709-710,  (quoting \nGriggs  v  Duke  Power  Co.,  401  U.S.  424,  432  (1971));  see  also  Connecticut  v.  Teal,  457  U.S. \n440,  451  (1982)  (‘The  suggestion  that  disparate  impact should  be  measured  only  at the  bottom \nline  ignoces  the  fact that Title  VII  guarantees  these  individual  respondents  the  opportunity to \n‘compete  equally  with  white  workers  on  the  basis  of job-related  criteria.”)  (emphasis  in  original). \n‘even  ifthe  disparate  impact  of HRD’s  format  is  one  factor  among  others,  it  generated  precisely \n{that  kind  of “headwinds”  and is  an  important  cause 2 of  disparate  promotions. \n| \n| \ni \n60\n  \n' \n' \n' \nt \nFinally,  these  three  types  of statistical  evidence have  much  greater  persuasive  power \nwhen  corisidered  together,  rather  than  separately.  If there  were  no  statistically  significant \ndemonstrations  of adverse  impact  on  promotions,  there  would  be  greater  reason  to  question  an \ninfluence  of adverse  impact  from  disparate  test  scores  or  passing  rates.  The  same  Is  true  if there \nwere  no  idverse  impact  ratios  below  0.80,  or  if there  were  no  clear trend  in  the  small  data  sets \nfor  individual  appointing  authorities.  But  all  these  types  of data  point  to  the  same  conclusion: \nHRD’s  format  had  a  disparate  impact  upon  promotions  (and  delay  in  promotions)  of Black  and \n‘Hispanic  candidates  for the  years  in  questions.  The  court  adopts  that  conclusion  by  a \npreponderance  of the  credible  evidence. \n0  Lack  of Job  Relatedness \nS::cond,  the  plaintiff must  demonstrate  that the  challenged  practice  is  “not  reasonably \nrelated  to job  performance.”  Lopez  IJ,  463  Mass.  at  711.  This  is  a  matter  of degree,  as  the  word, \n“reasonably”  suggests.  The  parties  agree  that  at  least  some  aspects  of the  police  sergeant’s job \nlend  then:selves to  a multiple-choice test.  For  instance,  written  tests  are  useful  to  assess  practical \nknowledge  used  in  performing  tasks  equivalent to  those  used  in  a  desk job.  The  plaintiffs  have \nproven,  however,  that  HRD  goes  well  beyond  that  scope  and  measures  matters  that are  not \nreasonably  related  to job  performance. \nFollowing  Lopez  II,  463  Mass.  at  703-704  and  703  n.8,  the  court  looks  to  federal \nauthority  in  construing  the job-relatedness  component  of plaintiffs’  §  4(4A)  claim.  Anti- \ndiscrimin ition  law  “has  forbidden  giving  [selection]  devices  and  mechanisms  controlling  force \nLnless  they  are  demonstrably  a  reasonable  measure  of job  performance.  ...  What  Congress  has \ncommanded  is  that  any  tests  used  must  measure  the  person  for  the job  and  not  the  person  in  the \nabstract.”  Albemarle  Paper  Co.  v.  Moody,  422  U.S.  405,  426  (1975)  (citation  and  internal \n61\n‘quotation  marks  omitted);  see  also  Smith  v.  Boston,  267  F.Supp.3d  325,  333  (D.  Mass.  2017)  (“a \ncourt  ensures  that  a  selection  device  evaluates  characteristics  important  to job  performance”); \nVanguari  Justice  Soc’y,  Inc.  v.  Hughes,  592  F.Supp.  245,  258  (D.  Md.  1984)  (accord)  (“In  short, \nan  exam.nation  is  content valid  if it  tests  knowledges,  skills  and  abilities  critical  to  a job  and \nthereby  1ates  applicants  on  the  basis  of their  ability  to  perform  that job.”). \n“Evidence  of the  validity  of a test  or  other  selection  procedure  by  a  content validity  study \nshould  c  onsist  of data  showing  that the  content  of the  selection  procedure  is  representative  of \nimportart  aspects  of performance  on  the job  for which  the  candidates  are  to  be  evaluated.”  29 \nC.F.R.  §  1607.5(B);  Accord Smith,  144  F.Supp.3d  at 206-207  (accord);  Vanguard  Justice  Soc’y, \nInc.,  592  F.  Supp.  at  266.  The  Court’s  findings  of fact  demonstrate  the  lack  of content  validity  in \nHRD’s  format. \nvere,  the  issue  is  not just the  validity  of the  exam  itself,  but  also  of ranking  candidates \n_  by  their  1umerical  scores.  Therefore,  “evidence  which  may  be  sufficient  to  support  the  use  of a \nselectior  procedure  on  a  pass/fail  (screening)  basis  may  be  insufficient to  support  the  use  of the \nsame  procedure  on  a  ranking  basis  under these  guidelines  ...  the  user  should  have  sufficient \nevidence:  of  validity  and  utility  to  support  the  use  on  a  ranking  basis.”  29  C.F.R.  §  1607.5(G). \nSee  29  C.F.R.  §  1607.14(B)(6)  (“users  should  evaluate  each  selection  procedure  to  assure  that  it \nis  appro ,riate  for operational  use,  including  establishment  of cutoff scores  or  rank  ordering”). \nThere  must be a  relationship  between  higher  scores  and  better job  performance.  See  29  C.F.R.  § \n1607.14 °C)(9).  Similarly,  where  a  rank  order selection  procedure  includes  consideration  of prior \ntraining  or  experience  as  a  selection  criterion,  there  must  be  a  correlation  between  that training \nand  expurience  and  the  content of the job.  See  29  C.F.R.  §  1607.14(C)(6). \n62\nMoreover,  using  a  score  to  rank  and  then  select  candidates  requires  a  strong  correlation \nbetween  test  scores  and job  performance.  See  Brunet v.  City  of Columbus,  |  F.3d  390,  410  (6th \nCir.  199°:)  (using  exam  score  to  rank candidates  requires  strong  correlation  between  test  score \nand job  jerformance);  Ensley  Branch  of NAACP  v,  Seibels,  616  F.2d  812,  822  (sth Cir.  1980) \n(use of  a  test for ranking  “is justified  only  if there  is  evidence  showing  that  those  with  a  higher \ntest scor:  do  better  on  the job  than  those  with  a  lower  test  score”);  see  also  Bradley,  443 \nF.Supp.7 d  at  159  (“[W]hen  an  examination  is  a  ranking  mechanism  that  dictates  whether  and \nwhen  passing  candidates  are  reached  for  consideration,  the  Court  must  determine  whether  it  is  a \ngateway  that  has  a  disparate  impact  on  minority  hiring.”);  29  C.F.R.  §  1607.14(C)(9)  (a \nheightened  burden  of proof is  required  when a  selection  device  is  used  to  make  employment \ndecision:  in  strict  rank  order,  requiring  a  defendant  to  demonstrate  a  relationship  between  higher \nscores  aiid  better job  performance). \nThe  Commonwealth  claims  that  the  2005,  2006,  2007,  2008,  2010,  and  2012  statewide \nexams,  2s  well  as  the  2005  and  2008  Boston  exams,  were job  related  because  they  tested  a \nsufficier t number  of KSAs  “which  [could]  be practically  and  reliably  measured  and  which \n[were]  a:tually  required  to  perform  the  primary  or  dominant  duties  of the  position”  of sergeant. \nG.L.  c.  21,  §  16.  The  court  disagrees.  The  tests  were  not  sufficiently  job  related  to justify  their \nadverse  impact  on  Blacks  and  Hispanics. \nIIRD’s  examination  largely  tested  candidates’  ability  to  memorize  technical  knowledge \nthrough  the  use  of questions  that  were  often  “definitional”  or  otherwise  asked  candidates  to \nidentify  various  theoretical  concepts  with  little  practical  utility.  The  exams  were  not \nrepreser tative  of the job  of a  police  sergeant,  because  there  was  no  attempt  to  test  for  many \n‘  critical  kills  and  abilities  of police  sergeants  identified  either  by  HRD  in  its  1991  Validation \n63\n}  . \nReport,  the  2000  Morris  &  McDaniel  Report  or numerous  reports  of experts  and  segments  by \nHIRD  managers.  The  1991  Validation  Report—  implausibly  and  without  explanation— states \nthat  HRI  ’s  examinations  could  measure  skills  and  abilities  that,  upon  closer  review  (or even \nmodest  s:rutiny)  could  not  logically  or possibly  be  tested  by  a  multiple-choice  examination  or \nE&E  coniponent.  HRD  failed  to  meet  professional  standards  in  creating  its  examinations,  with \nthe  result  that,  to  a  significant  extent,  it  assessed  test-taking  skills,  rote  memory  or  theoretical \nknowled,se  and  absence  of test-related  anxiety,  rather than  practical  knowledge  and  critical \nKSAs.  This  explains  why  a  large  portion  of incumbent  sergeants  failed  HRD’s  examinations \nwhen  they  took  a  subsequent statewide  promotional  examination that overlapped  with  questions \non  the  sergeants’  examination.  The  E&E  component  does  not  materially  contribute  to  the \nvalidity  of HRD’s  format,  because  the  E&E  criteria  credit  only  a  limited  number  of attributes, \nomit  many  significant types  of prior  experience  and  received  nominal  weight  in  a  candidates’ \ntotal  sco‘e.  There  is  no  credibie  evidence  to justify  the  use  of strict  rank  order  as  a  selection \n:  device.  Vfany  experts,  including  HRD’s  own  experts  and  test  plans,  indicated  that  wide  score \nbands  were  appropriate  because  HRD’s  exams  were  unreliable  when  used  for  selection  based \nupon  differences  in  test  scores  as  small  as  a  single  point. \nI: follows  that  HRD’s  exams  were  not  reasonably  representative  of police  supervisory \nduties  aid  were  not  valid  as  a  device  for  selecting  sergeants. \nIII.  HRD’s  Knowledge  of Disparate  Impact and  Lack  of Job  Relatedness \nThird,  the  plaintiff must  establish  that  the  defendant  knew  that  the  challenged \nemployinent practice  (1)  had  a  disparate  impact  on  a  protected  class  or  group  and  (2)  was  not \nreasonably  related  to job  performance.  Lopez  II,  463  Mass.  at  711. \n64\n| \ni.  Knowledge  of Disparate  Impact  | \nHRD  knew  its  2005,  2006,  2006,  2008,  2012  statewide  exams,  and  the 2005  and 2008 \nBoston  exams  “had  a  significant disparate  impact  on”  Black  or  Hispanic  candidates  seeking  to  be \npromote  to  sergeant  in  their  respective  police  departments.  See  Lopez  II,  463  Mass.  at  711. \ni  For  instence,  HRD’s  own  experts  (including  Dr.  Landy  in  depositions  in  1996  and  2001)  have \ntestified  that  its  promotional  examinations  have  an  adverse  impact  on  minority  candidates. \nThroughout  the  1990s  and  early  2000s,  testimony  and  reports  by  other  experts,  including  Dr. \nDaum  and  Dr.  Lundquist,  demonstrated  the  adverse  impact  of HRD’s  examinations  on  minority \ncandidat2s.  HRD  received  these  reports  and  testimony  in  the  litigation  regarding  the  disputed \nexaminations. \nHRD  also  created  or  commissioned  analyses  showing  adverse  impact  of its  examinations. \nThose  re ports  include  the  1991  Validation  Report,  which  found  adverse  impact  on  the  1991 \nstatewide  examinations  at various  passing  scores.  Likewise,  a  2006  internal  report  found  severe \nand  statistically  significant  adverse  impact  on the 2005  Boston  examination.  Indeed,  rather than \npresent i:xpert  testimony  to  disprove  the  exams’  likely  adverse  impact,  HRD  presented  Dr.  Silva, \nwho  chzllenged  Dr.  Wiesen’s  broad  conclusions,  but  found  statistically  significant  adverse \nimpact within  numerous  multiple  departments  even  without  aggregating  statewide  data  for a \n'  statewice  exam. \nb.  Knowledge  of Lack  of Job  Relatedness \nJARD  used  the  2005,  2006,  2007,  2008,  2010,  and  2012  statewide  exams,  and  the  2005 \nand  2008  Boston  exams,  “knowing  that  [they]  were  not  reasonably  related  to  [the] job \n,  performance”  ofa  sergeant.  See  Lopez  II,  463  Mass.  at  711.  HRD  knew of the  Civil  Service \nCommission’s  holding  in  Carr and  the Massachusetts  Appeals  Court’s  subsequent endorsement \n65\nI \n| \n| \nthereof.  See  Joint Ex.  38  at  18-19  (“When  all  the  voluminous  evidence  is  brought  to  bear  upon \nthe  issue  of examination  validity,  the  Commission  concludes  that the  final  configuration of  the \nlieutenant’s  examination  — containing  only  the  multiple  choice  and  training and  experience \ncomponents — failed  to  test  for  supervisory ability  and  therefore  was  not a  fair test  of the \napplicanis’  ability  to  perform  the  primary  or dominant  skills  of  the  position  [as  required  under \nM.G.L.  v.31  §  16]”);  Boston  Police  Superior  Officers  Fed’n  v.  Civil  Service  Comm’n,  35  Mass. \nApp.  Ct.  688,  695  (1993)  (“[t]he  commission  properly  found  that the  multiple  choice  and \ntraining  and  experience  components  alone  failed  to  constitute  a  fair  test  of supervisory  skills  and \nability.” \nMoreover,  HRD’s  1991  Validation  Report  identifies  a  significant  number  of KSAs  that \nare  critic  al  to  do  the job  of police  sergeant  but  could  not  be  tested  on  a  multiple-choice \nexamination.  Indeed,  the  1991  Validation  Report  noted  that  “[t]he  assessment  of the \nperform  ince  of these  skills  and  abilities  would  require  the  use  of selection  devices  outside  the \nscope  of  the  written,  multiple-choice  format.”  HRD  was  aware  of the  similar  statements  in  the \nCivil  Se:vice  Commission  and  Appeals  Court  cases  where  HRD  was  a  party: \n“there  was  substantial  evidence  before  the  commission  to  support  its  finding  that  the \nidministrator  committed  error  in  deciding that the  examination  was  fair without  the \nperformance  component.  Obviously,  supervisory  skills  and  abilities  represent  a \nsignificant  element  of fitness  to  perform  the  primary  duties  ofa  Boston  police  lieutenant. \n“the  commission  heard  expert  testimony  on  the  matter...  .  The  commission  properly \n{ound  that the  multiple  choice  and  training  and  experience  components  alone  failed  to \nconstitute  a  fair test  of supervisory  skills  and  ability. \nBoston  ?olice  Superior  Officers  Fed'n,  35  Mass.  App.  Ct.  at  694-695  (affirming  the  finding  that \nmultiple  choice  and  E&E  exam  alone  was  not  a  valid  test  for  a  supervisory  role  “[i}n  view  of the \nLegislature’s  goa]  that  the  promotional  examinations  fairly  test the  applicants’  fitness  to  perform \n!  the  prim ary  or  dominant  duties  of the  position  sought.”).  Nearly  20  years  later,  this  court reaches \n66\n1 \nthe  same  conclusion  independently,  and  on the  basis  of bn  entirely  new  record.  At the  risk  of \nunderstaiement,  it  is  frustrating  that  HRD  has  to  learn  this  lesson  yet  again. \nIn  2000,  Morris  &  McDaniel  also  stated  that  a  number of important  KSAs  could  not  be \ntested  appropriately  in  a  written  exam  and  recommended  that  HRD  adopt  non-written \n;  examina‘ion  components,  such  as  an  assessment  center or performance  review  system,  and \nweigh them  as  heavily  as  the  multiple-choice examination.  While  HRD  claimed  that  a  number \n:  of other  skills  could  be  tested  on  either the  multiple-choice  examination  or  EXE  component,  the \nassertior  was  implausible  on  its  face.  Other  experts,  including  Drs.  Daum  and  Lundquist  in  the \n1990s  ard  Dr.  Jacobs  in  the  2000s,  recommended  that HRD  band  candidates’  scores  because  the \nmultiple choice  examination  is  not  a  reliable  measure  of job  performance.  HRD  personnel \nreferred  to  banding  as  a  best  practice.  Numerous  local  police  departments,  including  the  City  of \nBoston  end  the  MBTA,  have  taken  the  position  formally  and  in  court  that  HRD’s  promotional \nexamination  was  not  sufficiently  valid  to justify  rank  order  selection,  and  that  it was  thus \nappropriate  to  hire  out-of-order  by  selecting  minorities  who  had  nominally  lower  scores. \nIV.  Knowledge  of Less  Discriminatory  Alternatives \nl'inally,  as  in  the  Title  VII  disparate  impact  framework,  even  if a  defendant  meets  its \nburden  of demonstrating  validity,  the  plaintiff can  still  prevail  if they  show  that  HRD  knew  there \nwas  “an  sther  selection  device  without  a  similar  discriminatory  effect  that would  also  serve  the \nemployer’s  legitimate  interest.”  See Bradley,  443  F.  Supp.2d  at  156,  174  (“Even  if the HRD  had \nproperly  validated  the  written  cognitive  examination  for  use  as  the  sole  basis  for  rank  ordering, \nthe  plaintiffs  have  demonstrated  the  availability  of alternative  selection  devices  with  less \ndiscriminatory  effects  that would  validly  serve  the  HRD's  legitimate  interests.”  ).  “The  proper \ninquiries  in  the  disparate  impact  analysis  are  whether  the  challenged  actions  were job-related  and \n67\nconsisteiit with  business  necessity,  and,  if so,  whether the  employer  has  refused  to  adopt  an \nalternati''e  employment practice that  has  less  disparate  impact  and  serves  the  employer's \nlegitimate  needs.”  Abril-Rivera  v.  Johnson,  806  F.3d  599,  608  n.9  (1st  Cir.  2015). \nHIRD  “refuse[d]  to  adopt ana vailable  alternative  [sergeant’s  exam]  that  has  less disparate \nimpact  and  serve[d]  [HRD’s]  legitimate  needs.”  See  Ricci  v.  DeStefano,  557  U.S.  557,  578 \n(2009)  (citing  42  U.S.C.  §§  2000e—2(k)(1)(A)(ii)  and  (C));  Compare Lopez I,  823  F.3d  at  120 \n‘  (holding  that  plaintiffs  failed  to  offer  any  evidence  that  the  use  of assessment  center  components \nwould  h..ve  led  to  a  smaller  disparity  in  outcomes,  especially  given  the  selection  ratios  for \nsergeant  promotions  in  Boston). \nMany  less  discriminatory  alternatives  were  available  to  HRD,  both  within  and  outside  the \nformat cf a  written  exam  and  E&E  component.  HRD  could  have  reduced  the  cognitive  load  by \nusing  fe ver written questions,  assigning  a  shorter  and  more  relevant  reading  list  and  writing  the \nquestions  and  distractors  plainly  in  a  manner that  addressed  practical,  rather  than  abstract, \nknowlec ge  and  rote  memorization.  It could  have  avoided  questions  drawn  largely  verbatim  from \ntextbool:s,  because  such  questions  have an  unnecessary  cognitive  load  and  result  in  known \nadverse  impact.  HRD  could  have  graded  the  written  exam  on a  pass-fail  basis  or  at  least  reduced \nthe  weig ht given  to  the  written  exam.  It  could  have  banded  scores  within  a  similar  range  and \ngraded  <  Il  candidates  within  that band  as  equals,  particularly  where  all  experts  agreed  with  the \nconcept  of score  banding.  The  banding  of scores,  as  Dr.  Jacobs’  recommended  long  ago,  would \nallow  HRD  to  consider  “long  and  important job  performance  records  upon  which  they  can  be \njudged.”  HRD’s  present  80-20  examination  fails  to  do  that. \n.At the  time  at  issue,  HRD  was  also  aware  of the  use  of assessment  center  techniques,  and \nin  fact  kad  approved  their  use  in  other municipalities.  Dr.  Wiesen,  Dr.  Rafilson,  and  Dr.  Silva  all \n68\ntestified  regarding  the  availability  of assessment  center alternatives,  including  in jurisdictions  as \nlarge  as  ‘he  City  of Chicago,  where  applicants  recorded  their  responses  to  situational  prompts \n_and  subraitted  those  responses  to  be  graded.  Those  alternatives  were  available  and  in  use  in  the \n2000s.  IIRD  also  could  have  adopted  a  career  board  and  amended  the  E&E  component to \nconsider job-relevant  characteristics  that  its  format  ignored.  It  could  have  implemented \nSituational judgment  exercises  in  written  and  non-written  forms. \nA\\ll  of these  alternatives  would  have had  less  impact  and  would  actually  have  improved \nthe  abili:y  to  identify  the  best  candidates  for  promotion  to  sergeant. \nV,  Public  Interest \nhe  Commonwealth  suggests  that there  is  an  additional  step:  assessment  of the  “public \n‘  interest.’  The  above  analysis  under  §  4(4A),  however,  already  incorporates  the  public  interest, \nas  defini:d  by  the  Legislature. \nG.L.  c. 31,  §  16  provides  that  HRD’s  “[e]xaminations  shall  fairly  test the  knowledge, \nskills  and  abilities  which  can  be  practically  and  reliably  measured  and  which  are  actually \nrequired  to  perform  the  primary  or dominant  duties  of the  position  for  which  the  examination  is \nheld.”  ““hat  overlaps  the  court’s  analysis  under  G.L.  c.  151B,  §  4(4A)  and  is  fully  consistent with \nc.151B  One  cannot “fairly  test”  KSAs  through  a  biased  test that  is  not  validated  to  ensure \nsubstantial job-relatedness.  HRD  has  not  explained  how  it  could  violate  §  4(4A)  and  still  meet \nthe  “fairly  test”  requirement.  Even  if that  were  possible,  HRD  did  not even  comply  with  §  16, \nconside: ed  by  itself,  because  it  failed  to  test  many  KSAs  that  “can  be  practically  and  reliably \n1 \n5i  \n|  measure d”  and  tested  for  many  skills  and  abilities  (such  as  test-taking  and  memorization  skills) \n| \nI \nthat  are  not  ‘actually  required  to  perform  the  primary  or dominant  duties  of the  position”  of \n.  police  s  srgeant. \n69\nTh  any  event,  the  Commonwealth’s  civil  service  law  and  anti-discrimination  statute  act \ntogether  to  prohibit  discrimination  in  public  employment.  G.L.  c.  151B,  §  4(4A)  unequivocally  - \nsets  fortl  the  public  interest  against  interference  with  the  plaintiffs’  right  to  be  free  from  racial \nand  national  origin  discrimination  in  promotion  to  police  sergeant.  The  Civil  Service  law \nexplicitl  incorporates  the  same  fundamental  public  policy.  The  civil  service  law  expressly \nmandates  that  decisions  be  consistent with  \"basic  merit  principles.\"  Massachusetts  Ass'n  of \nMinorit)  Law  Enforcement  Officers  v.  Abban,  434  Mass.  256,  264  (2001)  (fundamental  purpose \nof civil  service  law  is  \"to  ensure  decision-making  in  accordance  with  basic  merit  principles\").  In \ndefining  “basic  merit principles,  G.L.  c.  31,  §  1  provides:  “‘Basic  merit  principles’  [include] \n“assurin3   fair treatment  of all  applicants  and  employees  in  all aspects  of personnel  administration \nwithout  regard  to  political  affiliation,  race,  color,  age,  national  origin,  sex,  marital  status, \nhandica»,  or  religion  and  with  proper regard  for  privacy,  basic  rights  outlined  in  [G.  L.  c.  31]  and \nconstitu.ional  rights  as  citizens.”  See  also  Brookline  v.  Alston,  487  Mass.  278,  294-297  (2021) \n(harmor izing  c.  31  civil  service  laws  with  anti-discrimination  laws  under  G.L.  c.  151B  and  c.  31 \nin  the cc text  of a  racially  tainted  motivation  for termination  of employment);  Boston  Police \nSuperio:  Officers  Fed’n,  35  Mass.  App.  Ct.  at  695. \nlIRD  apparently  argues  that  the  civil  service  law  ties  its  hands.  But  nothing  in  this \ndecisior  undermines  the  requirements  of G.L.  c.  31,  §  25,  which  provides  that:  “[t]he  names  of \nsuch  persons  [candidates]  shall  be  arranged  on  each  such  list  .  .  .  in  the  order of their  marks  on \nthe  exar1ination  based  upon  which  the  list  is  established.”  For  one  thing,  an  “examination”  may \nbe  oral,  written  or  a  combination of  the  two.  It  may  occur  in  a  multiple  choice  test  or  in  other \n_  Standar«|  assessment  methodologies  recognized  by  E.B.  Jacobs  and  others  in  the  facts  found \nabove.  Moreover  “marks”  need  not  be  specific  numbers  scored  on  a  multiple  choice  exam. \n70\n[They  could  be the  equivalent  of an  academic  letter grade,  which  bands  groups  of numerical \nscores  irto  a  single  grade.  Finally,  if one  takes  a  very  literal  approach,  as  HRD  urges,  even  the \neducatioaal  and  experience  component might  stretch  the  concept  of “marks  on  the  examination,” \nbecause  the  award  of points  for  specific  aspects  of experience  or  education  is  entirely \njudgmer tal,  without  scientific  or empirical  basis.  That  narrow  reading  of HRD’s  authority  is  not \n|  consistent  with  statutory  language  on  purpose.!°  . \n'  It follows  that  nothing  in  §  25  conflicts  with  developing  a promotional  system  that avoids \ninterference  with  plaintiffs’  rights  to  be  free  of interference  from  racial  or  national  origin \ndiscrimiaation  in  promotion  te  sergeant.  Nor  does  it  conflict  with  the  notion  that  “competitive \nexams  [ire]  a  tool  to  accomplish  an  important  public  policy  of moving  away  from  nepotism, \npatronag'e,  and  racism  in  the  hiring  and  promoting of police.”  LopezI , 823  F.3d  at  108.  On  the \ncontrary:  a  competitive  exam  (written,  oral  or  both)  that  avoids  disparate  impact  and  reasonably \nreflects  ictual job  qualifications  will  do  a  far  better job  of moving  away  from  racism  in \npromoti >ns. \nVi.  MCAD  FILINGS \n‘fhe  court  ruled  before  trial  that the  plaintiffs  had  exhausted  their  remedies  by  filing  a \ntimely  complaint with  the  Massachusetts  Commission  against Discrimination.  See  Everett  v. \n.  357 Coip.,  453  Mass.  585,  600  (2009)  (“Without the predicate  filing  in  MCAD,  the  Superior \nCourt  has  no jurisdiction  to  entertain  the  claim of discrimination.”).  See  also  Lewis  v.  City  of \n  \n.  1° HRD has  legal  authority  to  implement  banding,  because,  as  noted  above,  a band  still  establishes  a rank \norder based  upon  scoring,  much  as  a letter grade  system  does  (e.g.  by treating  scores  from  93  to  97  as  an \n_  “A”,  without differentiation).  Indeed,  HRD’s  actual  practice  of rounding to  the  nearest  whole  number \nconstitui es  banding  of all  scores  within  0.50  points  of that  whole  number.  To  the  extent that  HRD relies \nupon  the  preliminary  injunction  in  Pratt v.  Diet],  Suffolk  Superior Court  No.  09-1254  (April  16,  2009), \nthat  decision  was  not  only  preliminary,  but  also  turned  upon  (at  p.  10)  the  failure  to  follow  “the requisite \nreview  frocess  called  for by  the  statute.”  To  remedy the  violation  in this  case,  therefore,  HRD  only  had \nto  follow: the statutory  process to  implement  banding. \n71 \n \n'  1 \nt \nChicago  Ill.,  560  U.S.  205, 212  (2010)  (in  a Title VII  disparate  impact claim  against  an \nemployer,  the  time  to  file  an  EEOC  charge  begins  to  run  each  time  the  employer  makes  a \nselectior  from  an  eligible  list).  In  denying  the  “Defendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss  Plaintiffs’ \nClaims  I<elated  to  the  2005,  2010  and  2012  Exams  for Lack  of Subject  Matter Jurisdiction,”  the \n_  court  mz de  the  following  filings  and  rulings,  which  it  readopts  and  reiterates: \nThe  Commonwealth  seeks  dismissal  of all  claims  related  to  the  2005  Exam,  2010 \nExam  and  2012  Exam  on  the  ground  that  no  named  plaintiff or  class  member  filed  an \nMCAD  charge  related  to  these  exams  within  the  300-day  statute  of limitations.  See  G.L. \nc.  151B,  §  5.  The  named  plaintiffs’  MCAD  charges,  filed  in  December,  2007  through \nSeptember,  2008,  alleged  that the  earliest  date  on  which  discrimination  occurred  was  in \n2007  or 2008.  The  2005  exam  was  more  than  300  days  [before]  those  dates. \nIt  is  true  that,  “[w]ithout  the  predicate  filing  in  MCAD,  the  Superior  Court  has  no \njarisdiction  to  entertain  the  claim  of  discrimination.”  Everett  v,  357  Corp.,  453  Mass. \n£85,  [600]  (2009).  However, for jurisdictional  purposes  in  this  class  action,  there  is  a \npredicate  filing. \nThe  300-day  period  begins  to  run  when  the  plaintiff knew  or  should  have  known \nof  the  alleged  discriminatory  act.  Flint v.  City  of Boston,  94  Mass.  App.  Ct.  298,  303[] \n(2018).  The  Commonwealth  claims  that  the  period  starts  running  “when  the  eligibility \nlists  were  issued  for each  exam  ....”  Comm.  Mem.  at  5.  This  is  incorrect.  Lewis  v. \nCity  of Chicago,  Ill.,  560  U.S.  205,  130  S.Ct.  [2191,]  2199  (2010)  (Rejecting  a  statute  of \nlimitations  argument  based  upon  promulgation  of a  promotional  list  based  upon  an \ninvalid  test,  because  “[i]f petitioners  could  prove  that  the  City  “use[d]”  the  “practice”  that \n“causes  a  disparate  impact,”  they  could  prevail.”).  Here,  the  plaintiffs  offer to  prove  that \npromotions  were  being  made  from  the  2005  exam  list  in  late  2007  and  throughout  2008. \n*Where,  as  here,  there  is  no  requirement  to  show  intent,  the  continuing  impact  is  enough. \nid,  The  court  recognizes,  as  the  Commonwealth’s  Reply  points  out,  that  the  defendant  in \n|.ewis  was  the  appointing  authority,  not the  entity  that  provided  tests,  scored  them  and \nr ank ed  candidates  based  upon  test result.  Where  the  HRD’s  list  was  in  effect  over a \nperiod  of time,  HRD  had  the  authority  to  take  necessary  action  to  avoid  disparate  impact \n‘luring  that time,  failed  to  do  so,  and  thereby  permitted  the  alleged  disparate  impacts  to \ncontinue  and  recur,  that  distinction  does  not  make  a  difference  in  a  disparate  impact  case. \n‘t  follows  that  the  court  has jurisdiction to  adjudicate  those  claims. \nMoreover,  where  the  MCAD  complaints  included  broad  language  about  disparate \nmpacts  on  minority  test  takers  and  lack  of job  relatedness,  the  “scope  of the  complaint” \nrule  applies  to  the  2010  and  2012  exams,  as  well  as  statewide,  to  all  municipalities \naffected  by  the  HRD  practices  in  question.  Id.  See  Pelletier v.  Town  of Somerset,  458 \n  \nMass.  504,  514  (2010)  (“the  MCAD  [charge]  and  potential  investigation  establish  the \nicope  of any  subsequent  filing  in  the  Superior  Court.”),  Where  the  plaintiffs  challenged  a \n72\n| \nset  of consistent  practices  that applied  to  all  exams,  lists  and  scoring  at  issue,  the  scope  of \ntae  MCAD’s  investigation  reasonably  would  include  the  subsequent,  substantially  , \nidentical  practices,  challenged  in  this  case.  See  Everett,  453  Mass.  at  603.  All  that  is \nrequired for jurisdictional  purposes,  is  that  the conduct  in  the  underlying  MCAD \ncomplaint  is  “reasonably  related”  to  the  claims  in  this  case.  Id. \nFinally,  the  “single  filer”  or  “piggybacking”  rule  likely  applies  to  this  disparate \nimpact  class  action  discrimination  case.  See,  e.g.  Perez-Abreu_v.  Metropol  Hato  Rey \nLLC,  5  F.4th  89,  92  (1st  Cir.  2021).

Here, there  are 73 \nzdministrative  charges,  of which  at  least 45  are  not  precluded  by  prior  litigation.  While \nMassachusetts  has  not  explicitly  adopted  the  single  filer  rule,  the  court  believes  that the \nSupreme  Judicial  Court  is  likely  to  adopt  it,  because of  the  solid  federal  precedent on  that \nrule  and  because  the  alternative  would  be  the  very  proliferation  of claims  and  complexity \ntaat  the  class  action  device  is  designed  to  avoid. \nThe  cou-t makes  the  following  additional  findings: \n709.  53  individuals  filed  MCAD  charges  related  to  the  exams  at  issue  in  this  case. \nThe  eviclence  includes  MCAD  charges  filed  by  44  individuals.

HRD  failed  to  implement  some  very  simple  ways  to  reduce  adverse  impact upon \nBlack  ard  Hispanic  candidates.  Artificial  reduction of the  eligible  pool  resulted  in  consideration \nof fewer  candidates  overall,  including  minority  candidates.  That,  in  turn,  precluded  considering \nmany  candidates  on  their  full  merits,  as  opposed  to  their test  scores. \nInstead  of improving  its  assessment format,  HRD  promulgated  lists  to  provide  a thin \nveneer  ¢ f apparent justification  for  a  discriminatory  process.  The  false  appearance  of a  fair \nprocess  created  inaccurate  beliefs  and  created  unwarranted  expectations  among  candidates  and \nappointing  authorities.  Those  beliefs  and  expectations  have  had  a  life  of their  own  in \nperpetuating  a  discriminatory  system  that  has  injured  qualified  candidates  and  deprived  the \npublic  cf the  benefits  of having  the  best-qualified  police  sergeants.  In  all  these  actions,  HRD \nknew  what  it was  doing. \nn  these  facts,  HRD  most  certainly  violated  §  4(4A)  with  respect to  the  plaintiff class  for \nall  the  «exams  at  issue. \n/s/Douglas  H.

The Eleventh Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution bars State law claims against State officials in Federal court. See Lopez v. State, 588 F.3d \n69, 73 n. 1 (1st Cir.2009) (Lopez ), quoting Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 121, 104 S.Ct. \n900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). \n \n4  For convenience, we refer to the plaintiffs’ second amended complaint as the complaint. \n \n \n5  See G.L. c. 31, § 3 (providing for development of rules to regulate “recruitment, selection, training and employment \n  of persons for civil service positions,” including rules providing for “development of examination procedures”). \n \n6  Although the plaintiffs also allege that, in the municipalities that employ them, “few, if any, minorities have been \n  promoted to the position of sergeant,” they do not specifically allege that there is a significant disparity within such \nmunicipalities between the percentage ratio of African–American and Hispanic police sergeants and their numbers \nin entry-level police officer ranks, on the one hand, and the corresponding percentage ratio of similarly situated \nnonminority police officers on the other. See Commonwealth v.

Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., 327 Mass. 211, 212, 97 N.E.2d 639 (1951), quoting Griswold v. \nDirector of the Div. of Employment Sec., 315 Mass. 371, 372–373, 53 N.E.2d 108 (1944) (reiterating common-law \nemployer-employee relationship). \n \n8  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq. (Title VII), addressed in Sibley \n  Memorial Hosp. v. Wilson, 488 F.2d 1338 (D.C.Cir.1973) (Sibley ), is the Federal analogue to G.L. c. 151B. See \nCollege–Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. v. Massachusetts Comm’n Against Discrimination, 400 Mass. 156, 163, 508 N.E.2d \n587 (1987). \n \n9  The indirect employment theory developed in Sibley is commonly referred to as an “interference theory” and is \n  referred to as such by the plaintiffs. See, e.g., Lopez, supra at 89; Association of Mexican–Am. Educators v. State, 231 \nF.3d 572, 580 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) (AMAE ). \n \n10  In Sibley, supra, the matter came before the court on the defendant’s appeal from the sua sponte entry of summary \n  judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The court agreed that the plaintiff’s complaint alleged facts sufficient to support a \nclaim under Title VII, but concluded that “it was not the part of careful adjudication to enter summary judgment sua \nsponte,” and reversed. Id. at 1342–1344. \n \n11  In AMAE, supra, Latino, African–American, and Asian–American educators challenged a Statewide certification \n  regime for California public school teachers, alleging that minority candidates disproportionately received failing \nscores on a test that was a prerequisite for prospective public school teachers and other public school personnel. Id. \nat 578. The defendants appealed from the grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the issue of the \napplicability of Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Id. at 579. The court cited Sibley, supra, with approval \nin holding that California and its credentialing body interfered with the plaintiffs’ employment opportunities with \nlocal school districts. AMAE, supra at 581. The court concluded, in line with Sibley, that a “direct employment \nrelationship is not a prerequisite to Title VII liability.” Id. at 580. \n \n12  “Indeed, the [S]tate is so entangled with the operation of California’s local school districts that individual districts \n  are treated as ‘[S]tate agencies’ for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.” AMAE, supra at 582. \n \n13  See Lopez, supra at 77–78 (nothing in Massachusetts civil service law, G.L. c. 31, mandates that municipalities use \n  results of division’s promotional examination as sole criterion to evaluate merit-based promotions). See also \nBrackett v. Civil Serv. Comm’n, 447 Mass. 233, 255, 850 N.E.2d 533 (2006), quoting G.L. c. 31, § 3 (e ) (nothing in G.L. \nc. 31 “mandates that promotions be made in strict rank order based only on examination results. Rather, the statute \nallows consideration of ‘any combination of factors which fairly test the applicant’s ability to perform the duties of \nthe position as determined by the administrator [of the division]’ ”). \n \n11 \n \n\n \n \nLopez v. Com., 463 Mass. 696 (2012)   \n978 N.E.2d 67, 116 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 850 \n \n14  We noted in Sahli v. Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc., 437 Mass. 696, 700, 774 N.E.2d 1085 (2002), that retaliation claims \n  under G.L. c. 151B, § 4(4), provide a distinct cause of action from interference claims under G.L. c. 151B, § 4(4A), but \nwe did not specifically address the distinction. The § 4(4A) interference claim in that case was premised on alleged \nretaliation by the defendant that consisted of the filing of a lawsuit against the plaintiff. Balancing the constitutional \nright to petition government against the competing statutory right to be free from employment discrimination, we \nconcluded that a lawsuit filed by an employer against an employee that has a legitimate basis in law “does not \nviolate the provisions of either § 4(4) or § 4(4A), absent evidence that the employer’s purpose is other than to stop \nconduct it reasonably believes violates the terms of [its] contract” with the employee. Id. at 705, 774 N.E.2d 1085. \nOur reference to evidence of the employer’s purpose in the Sahli case was specific to the circumstances as alleged in \nthat case, namely the assertion of retaliation or interference based on the filing of a lawsuit. \n \n15  By contrast, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G.L. c. 12, § 11H, makes it unlawful for any person to “interfere by \n  threats, intimidation or coercion” with another’s exercise of his civil rights. So structured, the word “interfere” is \nspecifically defined by the words that follow it; its meaning, and thus the scope of recovery under the civil rights act, \nis significantly narrowed by the requirement that the interference must take the form of either threats, intimidation, \nor coercion. See Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. v. Blake, 417 Mass. 467, 473, 631 N.E.2d 985, cert. \ndenied, 513 U.S. 868, 115 S.Ct. 188, 130 L.Ed.2d 122 (1994). The word “interfere” in G.L. c. 151B, § 4(4A), however, \nis listed as a separate proscribed act, following threats, intimidation, and coercion. \n \n16  As the Appeals Court correctly observed, “When the Supreme Judicial Court first recognized that one could base a c. \n  151B claim on a disparate impact theory, the court did not tether that conclusion to any particular language in the \nstatute.” Porio v. Department of Revenue, 80 Mass.App.Ct. 57, 68, 951 N.E.2d 714 (2011), citing School Comm. of \nBraintree v. Massachusetts Comm’n Against Discrimination, 377 Mass. 424, 428–429, 386 N.E.2d 1251 (1979). It is \nnonetheless apparent from its context that the claim that was the focus of our decision was based on G.L. c. 151B, § \n4(1). \n \n17  Because there is relatively little case law on disparate impact claims in Massachusetts, we look to Title VII for \n  guidance, mindful that Federal interpretations are not binding on this court when construing a State statute. See \nBrown v. F.L. Roberts & Co., 452 Mass. 674, 680, 896 N.E.2d 1279 (2008). See also Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. \nv. Massachusetts Comm’n Against Discrimination, 450 Mass. 327, 337–338, 879 N.E.2d 36 (2008). \n \n18  Two decades after the United States Supreme Court recognized the availability of a disparate impact theory under \n  Title VII in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971) (Griggs ), Congress codified \nthe elements required to establish discrimination based on a claim of disparate impact. See Lewis v. Chicago, 560 \nU.S. 205, 130 S.Ct. 2191, 2197, 176 L.Ed.2d 967 (2010). Such a claim is established if the plaintiff “demonstrates that \na respondent uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, \nreligion, sex, or national origin and the respondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related \nfor the position in question and consistent with business necessity.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i) (2006). \n \n19  Title VII permits “an employer to give and to act upon the results of any professionally developed ability test \n  provided that such test, its administration or action upon the results is not designed, intended or used to \n12 \n \n\n \n \nLopez v. Com., 463 Mass. 696 (2012)   \n978 N.E.2d 67, 116 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 850 \n \ndiscriminate because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(h) (2006). The United States \nSupreme Court has interpreted this language to mean that ability tests must be demonstrated to be a reasonable \nmeasure of job performance. Griggs, supra at 433–436, 91 S.Ct. 849. “[D]iscriminatory tests are impermissible \nunless shown, by professionally acceptable methods, to be ‘predictive of or significantly correlated with important \nelements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being \nevaluated.’ ” Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 431, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975), quoting 29 \nC.F.R. § 1607.4(c). See Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations, 29 C.F.R. § 1607.5(B) (2012) \n(“Evidence of the validity of a test or other selection procedure by a criterion-related validity study should consist of \nempirical data demonstrating that the selection procedure is predictive of or significantly correlated with important \nelements of job performance”). \n \n20  Statistical data, which generally is the source of evidence of disparate impact, will be required at later stages of the \n  proceedings, see Commonwealth v. Arriaga, 438 Mass. 556, 565–567 & n. 5, 781 N.E.2d 1253 (2003), but is not \nrequired at the pleading stage. \n“Standard statistical analysis in discrimination cases generally takes the unprotected group and compares the \ntreatment of that group to the treatment of the protected group to determine whether there is a statistically \nsignificant difference.... Differences, if any, can be measured in terms of absolute numbers, standard deviations or \npercentages.” Tinkham, The Uses and Misuses of Statistical Proof in Age Discrimination Claims, 27 Hofstra Lab. & \nEmployment L.J. 357, 358 (2010). See, e.g., Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 651–653, 109 S.Ct. 2115, \n104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989) (“if the percentage of selected applicants who are nonwhite is not significantly less than the \npercentage of qualified applicants who are nonwhite,” selection mechanism “probably does not operate with a \ndisparate impact on minorities”); Griggs, supra at 430 n. 7, 91 S.Ct. 849 (use of standardized tests by defendant \ncompany “resulted in 58% of whites passing the tests, as compared with only 6% of the blacks”). \n \n21  The division does not suggest that generalized Statewide statistics may not be used to establish a prima facie case of \n  disparate impact. See, e.g., Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 330, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977) (noting \nthat “application process itself might not adequately reflect the actual potential applicant pool, since otherwise \nqualified people might be discouraged from applying because of a self-recognized inability to meet the very \nstandards challenged as being discriminatory”). \n \n22  We reject the division’s argument that under Russell v. Cooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc., 437 Mass. 443, 772 N.E.2d 1054 \n  (2002) (Russell ), and Abramian v. President & Fellows of Harvard College, 432 Mass. 107, 731 N.E.2d 1075 (2000) \n(Abramian ), the plaintiffs’ aiding and abetting claim under § 4(5) necessarily fails because the municipalities are not \nnamed as defendants. In Russell, supra at 458 n. 7, 772 N.E.2d 1054, we held that the conclusion that the principal \noffender did not engage in employment discrimination under § 4(16) necessarily resolved a corresponding aiding \nand abetting claim under § 4(5) against its director of human resources and employee health. Similarly, in Abramian, \nsupra at 122, 731 N.E.2d 1075, we concluded that, because an aiding and abetting claim is necessarily derivative of \nthe underlying discrimination claim, where a new trial was ordered for the discrimination claim, a new trial was also \nrequired for the aiding and abetting claim brought against separate defendants. Although in those cases both the \nalleged principal offender and the alleged aider and abettor were parties to the actions, the cases do not stand for \nthe proposition that a claim of aiding and abetting under § 4(5) necessarily fails where the principal offender is not \nnamed as a defendant. \n13 \n \n\n \n \nLopez v. Com., 463 Mass. 696 (2012)   \n978 N.E.2d 67, 116 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 850 \n \n \n23  An interference claim under § 4(4A) does not require such a specific allegation against a particular employer \n  because a defendant (who is not the plaintiff’s direct employer) may independently commit an act of discrimination \nby “interfering” with the plaintiff’s employment opportunities with that employer, based on statistical data \nsupporting the disparate impact of the defendant’s conduct on all employers within that category of employers. By \ncontrast, an aiding and abetting claim under § 4(5) requires the defendant to act in concert with one or more \nspecific employers to “aid” or “abet” a primary and independent act of discrimination by those employers. \n \n24  Allegations that the division “assisted with, and knowingly contributed to, the discriminatory conduct of the various \n  municipalities” and “knowingly allowed municipalities to administer the ... exam despite its discriminatory impact on \nhiring” are also insufficient to state an aiding and abetting claim under § 4(5). These conclusory assertions of \ndiscriminatory conduct by “various municipalities” fail to allege a particular practice or act by any identified \nmunicipality from which an aiding and abetting claim could derive. \n \n1  As the court correctly notes, ante at 701–702, 978 N.E.2d at 73–74, the Commonwealth is considered a “person” \n  under G.L. c. 151B, § 4(4A), and has thus waived sovereign immunity for purposes of claims under that subsection. \nSee G.L. c. 151B, §§ 1, 4(4A). \n \n2  The American Heritage Dictionary defines “interfere” as “[t]o be or create a hindrance or obstacle” and “[t]o \n  intervene or intrude in the affairs of others; meddle.” “Interfere” is listed as synonymous with “tamper,” which \nmeans “to tinker with rashly or foolishly” and “to engage in improper or secret dealings, as an effort to influence.” \nAmerican Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 913, 1766 (4th ed. 2006). Although on one hand, the words \n“tamper,” “meddle,” and “secret dealings” suggest an element of intent, on the other, the words “[t]o be or create a \nhindrance or obstacle” do not of necessity suggest the same. See id. \n \n3  Other statutes using this series of words have also been interpreted to carry an element of intent. For example, the \n  Fair Housing Act makes it “unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person in the exercise or \nenjoyment of ... any right granted or protected by [§] 3603, 3604, 3605, or 3606 of this title.” 42 U.S.C. § 3617 \n(2006). Consequently, to state a cause of action under this section, a plaintiff must allege (and show) that “the \ndefendants’ conduct was at least partially motivated by intentional discrimination.” South Middlesex Opportunity \nCouncil, Inc. v. Framingham, 752 F.Supp.2d 85, 95 (D.Mass.2010). \n \n4  In Woodason v. Norton Sch. Comm., 25 Mass. Discrimination L.

Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  &  another? \nSuffolk  Superior  Court  Civil  Action  No.  2009-00576-A \nEndorsement  regarding  “Defendants’  Motion  for  Judgment  on  the  Pleadings” \n(Docket  No.  51): \nThe  Plaintiffs  are  Hispanic  and  African-American  police  officers  in  the  Commonwealth  of \nMassachusetts  who  have  taken  the  Commonwealth's  promotional  examinations  for the  | \nposition  of  police  sergeant  (hereinafter,  “sergeant’s  promotional  examinations”)  in  2005, \n2006,  2007,  2008,  2010  and  2012.  They  allege  that  although  they  were  qualified  for  the \npromotion,  they  have  not  received  such  a  promotion.  The  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action \nagainst  the  Commonwealth  and  Paul  Dietl  as  Personnel  Administrator  for  the \nCommonwealth’s  Human  Resources  Division  (“HRD”),  alleging  that  the  sergeant’s \npromotional  examinations  had  a  disparate  impact  on  minority  test  takers  and  cannot  be \nshown  to be  job-related  under  G.  L.  c.  151B,  §  4. \nThis  matter  is  before  the  Court  on  the  Defendants’  motion for judgment  on  the \npleadings.  As  grounds  for  their  argument,  they  contend  that  the  Plaintiffs’  discrimination \nclaim  is  barred  under  the  doctrine  of  issue  preclusion  by  virtue  of a  prior  decision  in  the \nUnited  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Massachusetts,  Lopez  v.  Lawrence,  No. \n07-11693-GAO,  2014  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  124139  (D.  Mass.  Sept.  2014)  (hereinafter, \n“Lopez”),  affd,  823  F.3d  102  (ist  Cir.  2016),  that  involved  the  same  parties  and  issues. \nIn  that  case,  the  plaintiffs  included  Hispanic  and  African-American  police  officers  in  the \nCommonwealth,  some  of whom  are  named  in  the  instant  action,  who  had  taken  the \nsergeant's  promotional  examinations  between  2005  and  2008.  The  Lopez  plaintiffs  filed \nsuit  against  the  Commonwealth’s  municipalities,  arguing  that  the  sergeant’s  promotional \nexaminations  were  discriminatory  because  they  had  a  disparate  impact  on  Hispanic  and \nAfrican-American  police  officers.  Id.  at*  1.  After  a  lengthy  bench  trial,  the  District  Court \nin  Lopez  ultimately  determined  that  the  only  municipality  with  a  statistically  significant \nadverse  impact  was  Boston,  and  even  there,  the  plaintiffs  were  unable  to  succeed  on \ntheir  claim  where  they  could  not  offer  an  equally  valid,  less  discriminatory  alternative  to  , \nBoston’s  2005  or  2008  sergeant’s  promotional  examinations  under  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  . \nRights  Act  of  1964  or  G.  L.  c.  151B,  §  4.  Id.  at  *47. \nThe  doctrine  of  issue  preclusion  provides  that  “[a]  party  is  precluded  from  relitigating  an \nissue  where  (1)  there  was a final  judgment  on  the  merits  in  the  prior  adjudication;  (2)  the: \nparty  against  whom  preclusion  is  asserted  was  a  party  (or  in  privity  with  a  party)  to  the \nprior  adjudication;  and  (3)  the  issue  in  the  prior  adjudication  was  identical  to  the issue  in  1 \nthe  current  adjudication,  was  essential  to  the  earlier judgment,  and  was  actually  litigated! \nin  the  prior  action.”  Degiacomo  v.  Quincy,  476  Mass.  38,  42  (2016)  (internal  quotations  | \nand  citations  omitted). \nco \n1  Gwendolyn  Brown,  Louis  Rosario  Jr.  and  Francisco  Baez,  individually  and  on  behalf of  a  class  of  tt  \nindividuals similarly  situated. \n?  Paul  Dietl,  in  his  capacity  as  Personnel  Administrator for the  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts,  Human.  | \nResources  Division.\nThe  parties  do  not  dispute  that  the  first  prong  is  met where  Lopez  included  a  final \njudgment  on  the  merits.  With  respect  to  the  second  prong,  this  Court  is  satisfied  that \nthe  plaintiffs  are  either  identical  or  in  privity  with  each  other.  Tatum,  Brown,  Rosario  Jr. \nand  Lopez  are  named  plaintiffs  in  both  actions.  Although  the  instant  action  includes \nBaez  and a  certified  class  of similarly  situated  individuals  who  are  not  named  in  Lopez, \nthe  parties  were  in  privity  with  each  other where  the  Lopez  plaintiffs  sufficiently \nrepresented  the  instant  Plaintiffs’  interests,  and  binding  the  instant  Plaintiffs  to  the  / \nLopez  decision  does  not  violate  due  process  or  common-law  principles  of fairness.  See \nDegiacomo,  476  Mass.  at  43-44. \nTurning  next  to  the  third  prong,  both  actions  challenge  the  sergeant’s  promotion \nexaminations  that  were  administered  by  HRD  on  the  basis  that  they  had  a  disparate \nimpact  on  African-American  and  Hispanic  applicants.  The  Plaintiffs  represented  to this, \nCourt  in  a  joint  motion  to  stay  proceedings  in  this  case  pending  resolution  of  Lopez  that \n“[t]he  sergeants  promotional  test  at  issue  in  the  state  action  is  the  same  test  that  is  at \nissue  in  [Lopez]”  and  that  “[w]hether  the  test  had  a  disparate  impact  on  black  and \nHispanic  test  takers  is  an  operative  issue  in  both  the  state  and  federal  actions.”  Indeed, \nthat  motion  described  the  actions  as  having  “identical  issues  of fact  and  law.”  Upon \nreview  of the  instant  pleadings  and  the  Lopez  decision,  this  Court  agrees  that  the  issues \nin  this  case  are  the  same  as  those  in  Lopez,  and  further,  the  issues  in  Lopez  were  | \nessential  to  the  court’s  decision  and  were  actually  litigated.  See  Degiacomo,  476  Mass. \nat  42.  Accordingly,  the  doctrine  of  issue  preclusion  prevents  the  Plaintiffs  from  raising  , \ntheir  disparate  impact  claim  in  the  instant  case  against  the  Defendants. \nIt  is  therefore  ORDERED  that the  Defendants’  motion  be  ALLOWED,  and  that judgment \nshall  enter  in  favor  of the  Defendants  on  both  counts  of the  Plaintiffs’  Third  Amended \nComplaint. \nRobert  N.

City of Lawrence, No. 07–11693–GAO, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124139, at *7 n. 1 (D.Mass. Sept. 5, 2014). \n \n2  The district court offered a detailed summary of this litigious history. See Lopez, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124139, at \n  *24–27. \n \n3  The Officers argue that Boston misrepresented its reliance on the 1991 report and that the City, in fact, used only a \n  less-thorough report conducted in 2000. The Officers’ evidence for this consists of a comparison, in a footnote in \ntheir appellate brief, between three tested skill areas out of fifteen total areas on the 2008 outline of exam \nquestions and similar language from the 2000 job analysis. We decline to find that this perfunctory, post-judgment \nsampling demonstrates that the district court committed clear error. \n \n4  Boston supplemented the HRD-produced examination with additional jurisdiction-specific questions that sought to \n  probe a candidate’s knowledge of Boston-specific rules, orders, and regulations. \n \n5  The  Officers  point  out  that  the  same  E  &  E  sheet  was  used  to  identify  candidates  for  promotion  among \n  Massachusetts firefighters in 2010. \n \n6  State law permitted a certain amount of flexibility for municipalities to  “bypass” a candidate who had the \n  next-highest score on the ranked list. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, § 27. The municipality could be held accountable to \nthe bypassed employee and, if challenged, would have to articulate a defensible reason for skipping him or her over. \nSee City of Cambridge v. Civil Serv. Comm’n, 43 Mass.App.Ct. 300, 682 N.E.2d 923, 925 (1997). No justification \n“inconsistent with basic merit principles, can[ ] be used to justify a bypass,” including a candidate’s race. Mass. Ass’n \n14 \n \n\nLopez v. City of Lawrence, Mass., 823 F.3d 102 (2016)   \n \nof Minority Law Enf’t Officers v. Abban, 434 Mass. 256, 748 N.E.2d 455, 462 (2001). The Massachusetts Bay Transit \nAuthority (“MBTA”), a state agency and a defendant, behaved slightly differently during the relevant years by \ntreating all the candidates on HRD’s list as having scored equally and narrowing down their pool of candidates by \nusing oral interviews. \n \n7  The other defendants did not concede that the statistical analyses applied to the outcomes among their smaller \n  groups of applicants established a disparate impact, and the district court agreed with the defendants. Our \ndisposition of this appeal does not require us to assess the correctness of that ruling. \n \n8  The  district  court  was  entitled  to  rely  on  this  conclusion,  despite  the  Officers’  various  quibbles  with  the \n  methodologies used to compile the 1991 and 2000 reports. \n \n9  The Officers place this variation slightly lower, at 1% to 4%, relying on testimony suggesting that no candidate could \n  reach the ceiling of the potential boost offered by the E & E. Unguided by fact-finding on this narrow question, we \nnote only the absence of any evidence that Outtz’s opinion turned on a plainly erroneous calculation of the precise \npercentage. \n \n10  Joined by the United States as amicus curiae, the Officers further dispute the “linkage” between these validation \n  reports—both the 1991 and 2000 reports—and the examinations themselves. Their chief challenge on this front \nrevolves around a “testability analysis” document prepared in connection with the 1991 report that evaluates which \nkey skills could, in theory, be tested on a future examination but does not directly link the skills identified to actual \nexamination or E & E content. The defect with the Officers’ reliance on this document is that it asks us to pretend \nthat it was the only relevant evidence the district court could rely on in drawing a connection between the validation \nreports and the examinations as administered. This was hardly the case. The district court weighed the testimony of \nDr. Wiesen and Dr. Outtz, both of whom had analyzed the examinations as well as the reports, reviewed the \ntestability analysis, applied their scientific expertise, and formed their own (differing) judgments as to whether the \nexaminations tested the skills identified by the reports. In crediting Outtz’s testimony, the district court did not \nclearly err. \n \n11  In the district court’s observation that “more than half of the KSAs identified as pertinent to the job were tested,” \n  Lopez, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124139, at *54, the Officers see clear error, pointing out that the 1991 testability \nanalysis only identified 70 out of a total 156 critical KSAs (i.e., not quite half) that could be tested on the exam. We \ndecline the Officers’ invitation to find this difference to be so material as to constitute clear error. \n \n12  The Officers did not move to strike any portion of Outtz’s testimony under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, \n  Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). Hence, even if we had thought that any part of Outtz’s \nopinion was unreliable or unsupported, we would have had to employ plain error review. See United States v. Diaz, \n300 F.3d 66, 74 (1st Cir.2002). \n \n13  Given the absence of any showing that an equally or more valid alternative to rank-order selection would have \n15 \n \n\nLopez v. City of Lawrence, Mass., 823 F.3d 102 (2016)   \n \n  reduced disparate impact, we need not address the Officers’ arguments that any state law favoring rank order \nselection is unlawful or preempted. \n \n14  The adverse promotional impact ratio in 2002 was calculated to be .32. In 2005, it was .28. \n \n \n15  Boston had previously tried other tactics to reduce adverse impact. In 1992 and 2002 Boston experimented by \n  integrating an assessment center component into the exam. After the 1992 exam, the City used its bypass authority \nto promote several Black candidates over Caucasian candidates in order to achieve compliance with a consent \ndecree and the Guidelines. They were sued and the bypasses were reversed. See Abban, 748 N.E.2d 455. \n \n16  The Officers’ failure to explain how a particular alternative would have reduced disparate impact in 2005 and \n  2008—and by how much—is particularly odd given the obvious mootness of their claim for injunctive relief. \nConsequently, had the remedy phase of trial proceeded as the Officers would have hoped, each officer would have \nneeded to show that, more likely than not, he or she would have been promoted had Boston used an equally or \nmore valid selection tool with less impact. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–5(g)(1) (authorizing “back pay” remedy for Title VII \nviolation); Azimi v. Jordan’s Meats, Inc., 456 F.3d 228, 235 (1st Cir.2006) ( “Injuries allegedly caused by the violation \nof Title VII ... must be proven to the factfinder ... which may reasonably find, within the law, that while there has \nbeen [injury], the plaintiff has not been injured in any compensable way by it.”). How any officer could have made \nsuch a showing without first securing a liability finding predicated on a specific alternative selection tool that would \nhave been equally or more valid and produced less adverse impact is entirely unclear. \n \n17  I would also have found the Officers established a prima facie case as to all defendants, but, as the majority does not \n  address this question, supra at 107, I will focus on test validity. \n \n18  Like the majority, supra at 107, I will refer primarily to Boston for the sake of simplicity. \n \n \n19  As I would find neither sufficed to support the exams’ validity, it does not matter which Boston relied upon for each \n  test, the 2000 job analysis or 1991 Validation Report. See supra at 109 n. 3. \n \n20  Job  relatedness  could  be  answered  “[y]es”  or  “[n]o”;  time  for  learning,  “[b]efore  assignment”  or  “[a]fter \n  assignment”; length of learning, “[l]onger than brief orientation” or “[b]rief orientation”; differential value to \nperformance, “[h]igh,” “[m]oderate,” or “[l]ow”; and necessity, “[r]equired,” “[d]esirable,” or “[n]ot required.” \n \n21  Frequency  could  be  rated  “[r]egular[  ],”  “[p]eriodic[  ],”  or  “[o]ccasional[  ]”;  importance,  “[v]ery  important,” \n  “[i]mportant,” or “[n]ot important”; necessity, “[n]ecessary upon entry” or “[n]ot necessary”; and relationship to \nperformance, “this task clearly separates the best workers,” “better workers seem to perform this better than poor \nor marginal workers,” or “[m]ost perform this task equally well.” Dimensions could be answered using any \ncombination of “[o]ral [c]ommunication,” “[i]nterpersonal [s]kills,” “[p]roblem ID & [a]nalysis,” “[j]udgment,” and \n16 \n \n\nLopez v. City of Lawrence, Mass., 823 F.3d 102 (2016)   \n \n“[p]lanning and [o]rganizing” or “all.” \n \n22  A second suspect aspect of this analysis, one that further clarifies how troubling the purported across-the-board \n  agreement is, is in how the SMEs rated certain KSAs and tasks. For example, all eleven SMEs—including two \nassigned  to  administrative  roles,—responded  that  “[s]et  [ting]  up  command  posts  at  scenes  of[  ]robberies, \nhomicides, fires, etc.,” was a “daily” task. \n \n \n \n \nEnd of Document   \n \n \n \n \n17 \n ",

The \ndocuments are not likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence where (1) the issue is not intentional  Image\ndiscrimination, but actual knowledge of a discriminatory impact and (2) though likely relevant to remedy, the \nfirst phase trial does not address remedy and there will be a phase 2 only if plaintiffs prevail in phase 1.  \nWhere the documents appear to be public documents and obtainable through a public records request, this \nruling does not in any way suggest a ground for denying such a request.

L. c. 231, s. 118, first par., \nseeking review of the 8/10/23 order of the Suffolk Superior Court denying their emergency motion to enforce \nthe settlement agreement and/or for a temporary injunction requesting that the Human Resource Division be \nenjoined from excluding class members from taking its new examination in September 2023. After careful \nreview of the petition, memorandum, supporting documents and the Commonwealth's response, the petition \nis denied.\n To obtain relief under G. L. c. 231, s. 118, first par., the petitioner faces a substantial burden and must \ndemonstrate that the challenged order is the product of a clear error of law or an abuse of discretion. See \nJet-Line Services, Inc. v. Board of Selectmen of Stoughton, 25 Mass App. Ct. 645, 646 (1988). In particular, \nwhen reviewing a trial court order denying a preliminary injunction, the single justice must exercise care not \nto substitute his or her judgment for that of the trial court judge when the record discloses reasoned support \nfor the judge's action. See Edwin R. Sage Co. v. Foley, 12 Mass App. Ct. 20, 26 (1981). In civil cases where \nthe moving party seeks to enjoin a government agency, the moving party must demonstrate a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits, whether it will suffer irreparable harm without the requested injunctive relief, and \nwhether such harm outweighs any harm to the opposing party that would follow from the entry of the \ninjunction. See Tri-Nel Mgt., Inc. v. Board of Health of Barnstable, 433 Mass 219, 219 (2001).\n The plaintiffs have not met their heavy burden. Based on the record before me, it does not appear that the \nSuperior Court judge committed an error of law or abused her discretion when she denied their motion. \nTherefore, the petition is denied.

Administrator for  the  Commonwealth \nof Massachusetts, Human  Resources Division, \nDefendants. \n- ORDER APPROVING  CLASS  ACTION  SETTLEMENT  |  ne  we \nThe parties  have  submitted  to the  Court a jo intnt   Motion for  Final Approval  of  |  | \nPartial  Settlement  Agreement  (the  “Motion”). The Motion  seeks final.  approval. pursuant \nto  Mass.  R.  Civ.-P. 23(c)  of the parties  Class s  Action  Settlement  Agreement  (the  . \n“Settlement Agreement, ”),  The Plaintiffs  are  a class  of current  or former police officers \n-who  took a police sergeant promotional exam created  and  administered by the  :  :  |  .  J \nCommonwealth  of Massachusetts  Human  Resources Division (“HRD”) in  2005, 2006,  |  . | \n2007,  2008, 2010,  or 2012.  The Plaintiffs  include  current  and former officers for the  : \ncities  of Brockton,  Lawrence, Methuen,  Lowell,  Springfield  Worcester, Boston,  and \nother cities and towns  throughout the  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts;  as well  as the \nMassachusetts’ Bay Transportation Authority  (“MBTA”).  Each named and class Plaintiff. \ni is  either Black or r  Hispanic.  The Plaintiffs  were © either not promoted to  sergeant  or  | \nexperienced  a significant  delayii  n  such promotion  based on their  scores  on HRD’s  | \nu  .  OT  on  ,  an  _  i  de  ~ \nexaminations.\n  \n|  After  a Phase I trial  on liability, the  court  found that HRD’s  examinations  had  an \n|  unlawful disparate  impact  upon. Black and Latinx  candidates i  in the police  sergeant \npromotional  cxaminations  administered by HRD  for the years  2005,  2006,  2007,  2008, \n2010, and 2012.  See Findings  of Fact  and Conclusions  of Law onL iability  (Phase Y, \ndated November’ 27,  2023  (“Phase  I  Order”)  The  court concluded that  “HRD interfered  . \nwith the class members’ rights  to consideration for promotion  too   police  sergeant without \n.  regard to race or national origin” ii n violation  of G.L  c.  151B,  § 4(4A).  Phase  I  Order at \n_  is.  The Settlement Agreement  resolves most of the remedial issues resulting from this  . \ncourt's  ruling,  but leaves open questions  of injunctive relief and attorneys fees. \nOn February 3, 2023, this  Court prelintinarily approved the  Settlement Agreement \n_as fair and reasonable, approved the issuance  of notice  of the Settlement to Class \nMembers, and  scheduled  a hearing  onn  final  approval  for May  10,  2023 (the  “Preliminary  — \nApproval Order’ ’). Notice  was  sent pursuant  to  the terms  of the Preliminary  Approval. \nOrder.  |  | \n‘AS reported  1 in Plaintiffs’  Supplemental Report  Prior to Final Approval  Hearing, \nd4a ted  May  9,  2023, the parties received  no written  obj ections  were received in response \nto the Notice.  Plaintiffs’  counsel have received claims  forms  from 414  class members, \ncomprising  about 75%  of the  entire  class. Those 414 members  account for approximately \n79%  of settlemient  proceeds,  which reflects  a greater claims rate by Boston  class  members \nthan those from  other municipalities! \nOn May  10  at  11:00  A.M.,  the  Court held a hearing  (“Fairness Hearing”)  in- \n“person  and by zoom to  consider the  fairness,  reasonableness  and adequacy  of the \n? \n \n1  Class members seeking  promotion in Boston had a greater lost opportinity  due to higher salaries  and \ngreater promotional opportunities in Boston. \nproposed settlement.  ‘The parties  appeared anda rgued  through  counsel. One class \nmember,  Boston Police  Sergeant  Sara D.  Dorsey,  appeared in opposition and presented: \nher argument orally  and in writing. The  court has  reviewed her detailed written \nsubmission,  which it received as  Exhibit  A to  the fairness hearing.  No other class \nmembers  or other interested person appeared in  opposition. \nAfter  considering  all the  oral  and written  submissions, the  Motion i is  ALLOWED,  - \n‘because the  Settlement Agreement i is  fair,  adequate and reasonable  for the  class,  and \nbecause  Settlement Agreement’s dispute resolution provisions  appear ss ufficient to \naddress  Sergeant Dorsey’s  concerns,  asd iscussed i in Part IV below. \nDISCUSSION \n|  I. \nThe  Court has  reviewed the  Motion  and the  exhibits thereto, including the \nSettlement  Agreement,  as  well as  the  written  and oral  arguments  of the parties. \nThe Agreement results  from  arm’s-length negotiations, in good faith, between class \ncounsel  and HRD’s counsel.  Based on the papers filed  with  the Court,  and the \n.  presentations made to the Court,  the  Court finds that the  Settlement Agreement  is  fair, \nadequate,  and reasonable.  ©  |  | \n“[T]he  essence  of a  settlement is  compromise  .  .  .B  ecause  settlement of ac lass \naction,  like  settlement of any litigation,  is basically  a bargained exchange between \nthe litigants,  the judiciary's  role  is properly limited to  the minimumi necessary to \n.  protect the  interests  of the  class  and the public.  Judges  should not  substitute their \nown Judgment  as  to  optimal  settlement terms  for the judgment of the litigants  and \ntheir  counsel. \n: Sniffin  v.  The Prudential Insurance  Company  of America,  395  Mass: 415,  421  (1985) \n(citations  omitted).\nThe court has  considered the parties’ likely  prospects  if it denied approval  of the \nsettlement and the plaintiffs had to  litigate this  case.. This class  action is  complex with \nmany intricate  factual and legal  issues.  The results  of litigation, including  this  case, \ncannot be predicted  with  certainty,  because  the damages  issues  are  complex and  difficult \nto  resolve.  There  is  every reason to believe that the plaintiffs are  receiving  at least as \n*  much in the  Settlement Agreement as they could  achieve  in a litigated resolution.  _ \n| Class  counsel have  concluded that the  proposed settlement  is  fair, reasonable  and \nadequate.  The  court agrees.  In approving the  Agreement, the  Court has  considered:  (1) \nwhether the proposed settlement was  fairly negotiated;  (2) whether serious questions  of \nlaw and  fact exist,  placing the ultimate  outcome  of the  litigation in doubt;  (3) whether the \nvalue  of the proposed  settlement  outweighs  the mere possibility of future relief after \nprotracted  and expensive litigation;  (4)  the judgment of the parties that  the proposed  | \nsettlement is  fair and reasonable  and (5)  the  comments  of the  class  members  submitted \norally and  in writing  at and after the fairness hearing.  On balance, these  considerations \nweigh  strongly  in favor  of approval.  In this  challenging  litigation,  the  Settlement \nAgreement cannot accomplish everything, but it will accomplish a lot.  It is  certainly \nsuperior to  continuing this  litigation.and,  very possibly,  losing the substantial  benefits \nthat the parties have negotiated, :  7 \n|  i. \nThe parties have left it to  the  court to  address  the scope  of equitable relief.  The \nPlaintiffs’  papers  ask for an  order that their expert be  empowered to  “oversee”  the \nupcoming development of a new exam and assessment process.  The court  agrees with \nthe defendants  that  “oversight”  of an  executive  function is-not appropriate where there\nare multiple ways to bring HRD’ s practices into  compliance with  G.L. c.  151B,  §  4(4A). \nThe  court lacks  power to  tell the  executive branch  how to fulfill  statutory  or \nconstitutional  obligations, particularly where the  decision involves  expenditure  of funds \nand provisions  of services  outside the  court  system proper.  See  Bradley v.  Commissioner .  . \nof Mental Health,  386 Mass. 363, 365-366 (1992)  (court lacks  authority  to  direct DMH to \n|  fulfill its  statutory  obligations in  any particular way); In the Matter of McKnight,t , 406° \nMass. 787,  791-792  (1990).  } \nOn the  other hand,  because the  court has  found a violation of statutory  law,  it has \nthe  power and duty to  order an effective remedy.  See Attomey  General  Vv.  Sheriff of.  \nSuffolk  County,  394 Mass.  624,  629- 31  (1984)  (Iti is  “a purely judicial: function”  to \n“order the fulfilment of the statutory obligation  of the  city of Boston to provide  a  suitable \n’  jail under the  mandate  of G.  L.  c.  34,  Section  3.  It falls to the judicial branch to  insure \n,  compliance  with this  statute. The court  must have power  to  carry  out its  obligation.”)  and \ncases  cited.  |  |  | \nHRD’s  substantive response to  the  court’s  Phase  I Order has been positive and \nfully consistent with the goal of remedying the  violations  that the  court found.  The  court  | \nnotes and  approves of EE:x hibit A to  the Class Action.  Settlement, which sets  forth \nnumerous  agreed actions  or considerations for development of the next  sergeants \npromotional  exam.  Moreover,  to  fulfill their  own  statutory obligations,  the  defendants \nare motivated  to develop anew test and protocol to  address the.court’s findings \nexpeditiously.  They are not likely to  delay unnecessarily.  Moreover,  continuing the  - \nexisting promotional list in effect may (as plaintiffs  suggested  earlier in the case)  reduce \nadverse  impact by  affording promotional  opportunities to  qualified candidates who\n-  passed the.test but did not obtain the  highest  scores.  The  court therefore sees  no need  for \norders dictating  the timing  or substance  of remedial measures at this time.  Indeed, \n| \n\"  restricting the HRD’s  exploration of improvements  in the next promotional  examination \n~  might interfere with developing the  fairest,  most statistically  valid way to  identify and \nmON \nselect the best police  sergeants. \nConsistent with  the judicial  function,  however,  the court has an interest in timely  | \n.  and  effective judicial  action if there is  tigation  over the  legality of the  defendants’  - \nchosen remedy.  ‘Failure to  identify  and resolve  such disputes  expeditiously and \neffectively  can reduce the  court’s  options, may force unnecessarily rushed  or truncated \nproceedings,  and may result in postponing the next  round  of sergeant promotional  exams \nwhile the  court assesses  compliance with legal principles that the Phase  I  Order has \narticulated.  No  one favors that  sort  of delay.  | \nThe court has  an interest in preserving its  options  to order the  most effective  and \ntimely remedy possible. It therefore  does take  action to  ensure  that the patties identify, \nraise  and, if necessary,  litigate disputes before  it is too  late to  address them in  an  optimal \n7  way.  Based upon the  oral arguments,  the  court’s  familiarity with the  legal issues  and  | \npractical process  of developing  a valid promotional  exam, and  the need to  enable the \ndefendants to  explore and incorporate the most effective remedy into the next exam, the \ncourt believes that the  following provisions will best ensure compliance with GL.  c. \n151B,  §  4(4A): \nIn developing the next Police  Sergeant’s Promotional Exam, the defendants  shall \n'  . forthwith provide to the plaintiff's  attorneys  and  experts  (subject toa  __ \nconfidentiality  agreement,  if requested)  the  following  documents,  when \ncompleted,  for review and  comment: \n>  Job analysis\n>  Proposed weights  for components  of the Exam \n>  Instructions to  Question Writers \n>  Instructions to  Subject. Matter Experts. \nThe  defendants need not wait for comments  from the plaintiffs  or their experts  or \ndelay any-action pending receipt of such comments.  If they choose,  the \n'  defendants  may provide the  same  information simultaneously  to  other parties  o« r \ngroups,  but are not.required to  do'so.  The  defendants  shall not,  however,  give any \nothér outside party or group  (i.e. a person  or group  not employed  by or under.  . \ncontract with the  Commonwealth for development  of the  Sergeant’s promotional \nexam)  more favorable  access  to  such  materials. \nThis  order avoids premature disclosure and  interference. with deliberative \nprocesses  by waiting until  certain milestones  are  complete before requiring disclosure. \nThe defendants  have  argued that the  court  should not place plaintiffs  in  a favored position \nthough  early  access to  information, but the  defendants have  the power to  avoid that \n‘problem, because  they may,  at their option,  provide the  same information simultaneously \nto  other groups  or parties. \nm1 \nThe parties  also  dispute the amount of attorneys fees  to  be  awarded.  Pursuant to: \nparagraph  1(a)(iv),.the  fee  award  is to be paid out of the total  $40,000,000 monetary \naward  and, therefore, would reduce the  total amount available  for payment to  class  \" \nmembers. Accordingly, the  parties  agree that the  appropriate  method to determine \nattorneys  is the  “percent  of fund” method.  So  Oo  oy \nThe  Supreme Judicial  Court t  has  “allowed attomeys'  fees  as part. of a damage \naward where the party...  - has,  -at his  or her'‘own  expense, been  successful in creating, \npreserving  ore nlarging  a  fund i in which other parties have  a rightful share.”  Pearson v. \nBoard  of  Health of Chicopee,  402 Mass. ‘797, 800- 801  (1988)  at n.3, ‘citing  Commissioner \nof Ins.  v. Massachusetts Accident Co.,  318 Mass.  238,  242  (1945).,  See  Crowley v.  _\nL \n‘Communications  for Hospitals,  Inc.;  30 Mass.  App!  Ct.  751,  767 (1991)  (“[B]ecause we \nnow provide  relief in the fashion  of a derivative action  —a fund of money created for the  | \nbenefit  of all the  stockholders in the  company — an  award. of attorneys’  fees to the \nplaintiff out of that fund is  appropriate.”).  oe \nDespite the parties’  agreement,  a cautious  approach is  appropriate, because  . \nawarding  attorneys  fees from the settlement proceeds  is  a zero-sum game, in which  - \n‘compensation to the  attorneys reduces  class  members”  recoveiy  ona dollar-for-dollar \nbasis.  For  one thing,  as  the  Commonwealth  observes,  the POF approach does not  | \neliminate the need to  consider reasonable hours  expended  and reasonable hourly rates. \n“See!  In Re Thirteen Appeals, 56  F.3d 295, 307  (it Cir.  1995).  For another thing,  the  | \n-  Supreme  Jadicial Court has  given guidance  on thisi  issue in.a casee  where  it declared  a \nregulation unconstitutional, tuled that the plaintiffs  could recover attorneys fees under  42 \nU.S.C.  §  1988,  and remanded for further action, including resolution  of whether  a class \nshould be certified:  |  | \nIf  on remand, the asserted  classes  are  certified,  we  agree that  any recovery. \nteceived by the plaintiff classes  should be-placed in a commion fund (or funds) in  -  ~ \nthe  court and that payment  of attorney's  fees  should be made from this  common \n‘fund.  We reject, however,  the  suggestion ‘that the plaintiffs' attorneys in this  case \nshould be  compensated based on a percentage  of the total  amount recovered by \nthe plaintiffs.  In this  case,  we believe that the  lodestar method is  the  appropriate \none to  determine reasonable  attorney's  fees under  Section  1988,  and is to be used - \nto  determine the  amount of fees ultimately paid to  the plaintiffs'  attorneys  from \n. the  common fund. See  Skelton v.  General Motors  Corp.,  860  F.2d 250,  253  (7th.  | \nCir.  1988), cert.  denied,  493  U. S.  810  (1989). \n|  American  Trucking Associations;  Inc.  v.

Originally  outlined in  Cummings \nv. National  Shawmut Bank of Boston,  284 Mass.  563  (1934).”). \nIn this  case,  there  are no  contemporaneous  time records.  The case presehted.very  — \nchallenging factual and legal  issues  before,  during  and after  trial,  as  evidenced by the \n-  length  of trial,  the two pretriala ppeals  on which the plaintiffs  were  successful, and the \n;  length  of trial  and post-trial  filings themselves.  The results  obtained were  excellent, \nreflecting  over  » decade  of effort.  The  fee request  is  for 22.5%  of the fund, well below \nthe  33.3%  contingency  often achieved by contract.  These facts weight  strongly in favor \nof a very substantial  award. \n'  At the  same time,  some  factors  suggest that not:all time  expended was  necessary, . \nincluding the high level  of staffing  by multiple  attorneys at trial,  depositions and  other | \nportions  of the proceedings. Moreover, the  plaintiffs previously litigated  some  of the  _ \nfactual  issues  in the  Federal  court,  giving the plaintiffs in this  case the benefit  of a “head \n|  start” in trial preparation.  The  court also  considers  the  absence  of detailed,  | \ncontémporaneous  time records.  Such records  often reveal  duplication or unnecessary \nwork,  as  the  court’s  experience strongly, suggests, \n|  For all  oft hese reasons,  the  court  agrees. with  the  Commonwealth’s  suggestion of \n.  areduction in the  attorneys fees  award.  Toa large  extent,  that reduction has already  - \noccurred,  as the plaintiffs  seek only 22.5%  of the  fund. The  comparable  cases cited by \nthe plaintiffs  suggest a range  for fees between  20%  to  30%  oft he  fund.  It  is  not clear \nwhat the ultimate  fees  and class  awards were in this  case, but a high percentage  ofa very \nlarge amount tends  to produce  an unreasonably large  fee.  Because  of the very large \namounts  involved here,  the  lack of contemporaneous time records  and the observed\nduplication, of effort in  a number of instances,  the  court selects  the low  end-of the bound, \nnamely 20%  -  or$ 8,000,000. \n|  In many  cases,  the percentage  of fund covers both attorneys fees and costs. \nHowever,  this  case involved  extensive  costs  for  expert testimony,  which was central  to \nresolving the  merits.  The plaintiffs  had no  real  choice but to  spend those  funds,  which in \nno  way reduced the  degree  of effort required by attorneys.  There is  no  dispute that the \n$750,000 in litigation  costs  are reasonable  and appropriate.  It would be unfair to reduce  © \n-  the attorneys  fees by  that  amount in calculating the  20%  payable  for attorneys  costs  and \nfees.  Therefore,  the  court awards  attorneys fees  in  the  amount of 20%  of the fund,  plus \n_  litigation  costs  and fees.  | \nThe  final  award.is  $8,000,000  in attorneys  fees  and  $750,000 for  a total  award  of : \n$8,750,000.  7 \n|  IV. \nSergeant Dorsey was the  only class  member to  object to  the  Settlement \nAgreement.  Her  situation  appears unique,  or relatively unique.  She took the  2008  exam, \nsought promotion in 2014  (when the  2008  exam list was  still  in  effect) and was \nunsuccessful  even though her raw  score  was higher than  certain white  candidates  and \neven though  adding 4 points to her  score (the  degree  of disparity  as  calculated by  | \nplaintifts’  expert) would have  placed her in  a group  ofc andidates  that,  without exception, \nreceived  promotions.  She pursued her claim  in  appeals, including an  appeal to  the  Civil \nService  Commission,  but was  not  successful in obtaining promotion  until  2018, based \nupon  the  results  of a subsequent test cycle.  To be  sure,  her claim for failure to promote  is \n10\nagainst  her employer,  the  City of Boston,  not against HRD  or the state.2  But she  did not \nhave the benefit in 2018  of the  court’s  ruling that HRD interfered with her right to  a fair: \n|  promotional process.  We now know that,  on average,  Black candidates  should have \nreceived an additional 4 points, to  adjust for the disparity in the 2008  exam.  Had  she \nreceived  those points,  she had a very high likelihood  of obtaining her promotion  3 years \nand  8  months earlier  than  she ultimately  did.  She  calculates her lost back pay as  being \n$146,664. No other class member  has  presented  and documented a similar claim to this \ncourt.3 \nSergeant Dorsey proposed  breaking the  class relief into  four tiers, largely \n\"according to  test  score  on the  challenged  exams  in relation tot he  scores  obtained by \nsuccessful candidates. While that approach has  some appeal,  it is likely  to  lead to \ndisputes  about who would and would not have  been promoted and would require \n-  litigation  over hypothetical promotion scenarios, including  possible hypothetical  actions  | \nby the  Civil  Service  Commission.  The parties  have  sensibly and reasonably decided to \n_  avoid expensive  and drawn-out  disputes  over matters that cannot be  determined with any \nconfidence  at this point. \n  \n2 See Exhibit A to the May  10, 2023 hearing (Sgt. Dorsey Statement) at 2:  “[E]ven when we-do overcome \nthat bias and are up for consideration, there are gatekeepers who keep as many of us out of the promotions \nas possible.  Despite that being a most damning evidence of discrimination, as allowed by the Civil Service \nCommission,  even after my appeal to them,  it was not mentioned during this case.”  The court understands \nthe word “gatekeepers” to refer to decision-makers within the Boston Police Department.  This case does \nnot involve discrimination by the City or other employers, or by the Civil Service Commission in its \nappeals process.  For that reason,  discrimination by those actors is not the basis for a remedy here.  The \nonly defendant is HRD, based upon the disparate impact in the examination scoring which had an impact \non promotions, not upon how individual employers made their decisions. \n3 Sergeant Dorsey also expressed a concern that the Settlement Agreement would grant as much as $60,000 \nto “individual candidates who did not study for the promotion exam, walked in unprepared for the exam \nand failed it, or barely passed the test.”  These are legitimate opinions, but the court expresses no view on \n’  them.  Legally, no class member in this case (or, indeed, any person in any case) has a right to object to \nmoney that another person receives under a settlement agreement.  The one exception might be if an award \nto a group of people reduced the objector’s own recovery, but the dispute resolution fund appears  large \nenough so that Sergeant Dorsey is not likely to suffer that consequence. \n“i\nMoreover,  the 4-point average  disparity applies  class-wide,  but not necessarily to \nany individual Black or Latinx candidate.  Sergeant Dorsey may well have received araw \nscore 4 points higher than she  got, but it is important to remeniber  that this is  an \n|  assumption  based upon group performance.  The  assumption may not hold true  for any \nparticular individual  or for groups  of individuals,  such as candidates who  obtained  .  .  ‘ \nrelatively high test  scores. Proving  the effect of bias upon  an-individual  candidate  is very \n.  complicated.  Some  candidates  may  have  suffered more than  a 4-point disadvantage from \nthe racially disparate impact.  Some  less.  What  we know  is  that the class  as  a whole \n|  suffered that disadvantage.  Trying  to  be more specific  would likely lead to significant  | \nunfairness  for individuals because  it  is  difficult or impossible to quantify  disadvantage  so  | \nprecisely  that each candidate  could prove entitlement  to  specific  test  score  point  increases  | \non an individualized basis.‘ ‘That is,  it would  \"drag the  court into  ‘a quagmire  of \n-  hypothetical judgments™  and  result i in \"mere  guesswork  \"  Segar v.  Smith,  738 F. 2d  1249,  . \n1289-90  . C. Cir: 1984), quoting  Thompson  v.  Boyle,  499 F. Supp.  1147,  1170 \n(D.D.C.1980),  quoting Pettway v. American  Cast Iron  Pipe CCoo ., 494 F.2d 211,  260 (50 \nCir, 1974))),  cert. denied,  471 U. 8.  1115  (1985). \n  \n‘ Every member of the class is an individual with particular training, skills,  abilities, educational \nbackground, prior test-taking experiences, academic inclinations (or not) and life experiences.  Therefore, \nmembership in the class does not necessarily prove that any particular candidate suffered a disadvantage \nthat equates to 4 points.  Moreover, even as a matter of statistics, it is not clear that the same differential \napplies independently of a candidate’s total score. For instance, minority candidates who received high \nscores may not have suffered a full 4 percent differential, in part because they had less room to improve \n_  their scores than lower-scoring candidates.  It is also important to know the specific candidate’s pattern of  , \nincorrect answers.  The effect of the exam’s overall disparate impact upon Sergeant Dorsey probably \n.  depends upon whether, in general,  she received an “incorrect” on the same questions that resulted in the \n_  greatest racial or ethnic disparity or whether her “incorrect” answers tended to occur on the same questions \nthat caused difficulty for white candidates.  In the latter case, the pattern may. suggest that her score \n_  primarily reflects the difficulty of the exam for all candidates.  It is also possible that overcoming  / \ndisadvantage to achieve a higher score reflects positively on promotional qualifications, but the test does  - \nnot even measure that phenomenon.  Even if these factors still support an inference in Sergeant Dorsey’s \nfavor, they do not so clearly individualize the average  discrepancy that she can definitively  claim \nentitlement to an additional 4 points.  ; \n12\n  \nThe parties have wisely avoided spending  resources  in such an effort, which  | \nwould likely  be no fairer and could be  significantly  less  fair. By addressing thed isparity \nprimarily  through ¢ a “shortfall  analysis” — ‘essentially  a “lost opportunity”  theory? - -ona \nolass-wide basis,  rather. than through  individual  determination, the Settlement Agreement \n.  respects  the limitations  of the  statistical  analysis in this  c¢ ase, ,  which did not,  and perhaps \ncannot, provide  individualized  estimates  for particular candidates. See,  e.g.,   Cailett v. \nMissouri Highway and Transportation Comm’n.,  828  F.2d 1260,  1267  (  Cir.  1987) \n. (deciding  to  “award relief  on a classwide, rather  than individ, basis. by  calculating the. \nnumber of positions  for. which class  members  should have been hired and distributing pro \nrata  among all qualified  class  members the total  amount of  back. pay  for which the \n;  defendant may be held responsible. ”), \nFortunately,  the  Settlement Agreement alsop rovides  a fund for dispute resolution. \nParagraph  1(a)(iii) allocates, $300,  000  into  a  “fund to  resolve any disputes filed: by class \n- members  who have been inadvertently  omitted from the class  list or otherwise  Provide | \nclass  counsel with good cause to adjust their pro-rata share  of the  settlement fund.”  This \n.  wording  is well-suited to  address  a claim  such  as  Sergeant  Dorsey’s.  To  date,  she  is the  . \nonly class member to provide documentation that class  counsel could consider “good  — \ncause”  for an adjustment.  Since  she will likely  receive  a base award of $65,000  to \n$67 000  from the  settlement,  her full  lost wages  claim against the  dispute resolution fund \n  \n5 Analogies supporting  an award monetary compensation for loss of opportunity exist i in other contexts \nunder Massachusetts law, such as loss of.chance of recovery in medical malpractice cases and lost earning \ncapacity in personal injury damages.  See Matsuyama v. Bimbaum,  452 Mass.  1, 2 (2008) (“Where a \nphysician's negligence reduces or eliminates the patient's prospects for achieving a more favorable medical \noutcome, the physician has harmed the patient and is liable for damages.”); Model Superior Court  Jury” \nInstructions, Personal  Injury Damages, part (5)  (“Lost Earning Capacity”). \n13\nwould  be  roughly  $80,000  (with possible  additional  amounts for emotional  distress  and \ninterest).  |  |  |  | \nA settlement rarely provides  full value,  because litigation  is never certain, and \nsettlements  involve  compromise.  Sergeant Dorsey makes a strong  case,  but there  is  no \ncertainty  that  she  could actually  prove  that  she would  have been promoted  at the time  she \nClaims — as  exemplified, perhaps,  by  her  lack ofs uccess in  convincing the  Civil  Service  | \nCommission that  she was entitled to a promotion.  Perhaps her claim  against thed ispute \n‘resolution fund will be  discounted for  that reason,  as  commonly  happens  in litigation  ; \nsettlements.  Perhaps  her claim will be granted  in full.  Even at  fullv alue,  however,  the — \nfand  appears  capable  of supporting  a  claim in that amount,  if class  counsel  finds  good \ncause.  |  | \nParticularly where  Sergeant Dorsey’s  claim would.not  exhaust the dispute. \n.  resolution fund, the  court  in no way  casts doubt on  claims  that other class  members might \nassert.  It does note,  however,  that  she  is  the only ‘class  member who has  made  at imely \n'  objection,  with exterisive  documentation,  which  puts  her in a  sub-class  of her  own.  Even \nif others  make similar claim,  given the discounted  payments that typically  occur in \nsettlement,  the  dispute resolution  fund is  a reasonable  way to provide  supplemental relief  | \nto  these claimants.  It is  also not  clear to the  court whether the other  individuals  Sergeant \nDorsey names  were plaintiff  in the  federal  court litigation, in which case,  they have no \n- Jegal right to  any payment  and depend  entirely upon  the Commonwealth’s willingness  to \ninclude them  in  the base payment provided in the Settlement Agreement.  | \n|  ORDER \nAccordingly,  THE  COURT HEREBY  ORDERS,  ADJUDGES,  AND DECREES: \n14\n.  The Court has jurisdiction  over the  subject matter of  this  action,  the named \n_  Plaintiffs,  the  Defendant,  and all  Class  Members. \n.

In developing the next Police  Sergeant’s  Promotional Exam,  the  defendants \nshall  forthwith provide  to  the plaintiffs attorneys  and experts  (subject toa \nconfidentiality agreement,  if requested) the following  documents,  when \ncompleted,  for review  and comment: \n>  Job  analysis \n>  Proposed weights  for components  of the Exam \n>  Instructions  to Question Writers  (excluding  any  questions themselves) \n>  Instructions  to  Subject Matter Experts.. \nThe  defendants  need not wait for comments  from the plaintiffs  or their experts  or \ndelay any action pending  receipt of such comments. if they  choose,  the \ndefendants may provide the same  information  simultaneously to  other parties  or \ngroups  ata stakeholders  meeting  (or otherwise), but are not required to  do  so. . \nThe  defendants  shall not, however, give any other  outside  party or group  (i.e.  a \nperson or group not  employed by oru nder  contract with the  Commonwealth for \ndevelopment of the  Sergeant’s promotional  exam)  more  favorable  access  to  such \nmaterials than  to plaintiffs’  counsel or  experts,  without written  consent of the \nplaintiffs  or further order of court. \n9.

In  October,  2022,  the  court  (Wilkins, \n  \nJ.)  issued  an  order  finding  that  Plaintiffs  prevailed  on  their  claims  that  several  years  of HRD’s \n   \npromotional  exams  had  a  discriminatory  impact  on  minority  police  officers.  More  specifically, \nafter  a jury-waived  trial  on  the  issue  of liability,  Judge  Wilkins  found  that  the  Commonwealth \nhad  discriminated,  in  violation  of G.L.  151B,  §4(4A),  against minority  candidates  for the \nposition  of police  sergeant  in  HRD’s  administration  of promotional  exams.  Subsequently,  in \nMarch,  2023,  on  the  eve  of the  second  phase  of the  trial  concerning  the  remedy,  the  parties  came \nto  an  agreement  on  aremedy.  On  March  31,  2023,  the  parties  memorialized  their  agreement \nabout  the  terms  of the  remedy  in their  Class  Action  Settlement  Agreement  (“Agreement”).  On \nMay  11,  2023,  Judge  Wilkins  entered  an  order  approving  the  Class  Settlement Agreement \n(“Order”).  Pursuant  to  the  Agreement,  the  Commonwealth,  inter alia,  agreed to  (1)  pay  forty \nmillion  dollars  to  resolve  Plaintiffs’  claims  that the  2005,  2006,  2007,  2008,  2010,  and  2012 \n  \nsergeant  promotional  exams  had  an  unlawful  disparate  impact  on  the promotion  of Black  and \nHispanic  police  officers;  and  (2)  create  and  administer  a  new  exam  in  2023  that was  | \nnondiscriminatory. \nIt  is  that  Agreement  and  Order  that  are  at  issue  now  in the  Plaintiffs’  Emergency  Motion \nto  Enforce  the  Settlement  Agreement  and/or  for  a  Temporary  Injunction.  Plaintiffs  claim  that  the \nCommonwealth’s  HRD  has  violated  the  Agreement  in two  ways:  failing  to  provide the job \nanalysis  used  in  drafting  the  new test  that  HRD plans  to  offer  on  September  23,  2023,  and  failing \nto  open  the  September  23,  2023  exam  to  all  class  members  who  wish  to  take  that  sergeant’s \nexam.  First,  Plaintiffs  argue  that the  Commonwealth  has  not provided  it with  the job  analysis \n \neven  though  Judge  Wilkins  ordered  it to  “forthwith  ...  when  completed.”  Next,  Plaintiffs \ncontend that  the  court,  specifically  Judge Wilkins,  who  had been  specially  assigned  to  this  case \nbefore  his  retirement,  and  who  invested  countless  hours  hearing  the  evidence  and  drafting  the \nt \ndecision  and  order  on  the  liability  phase  of the case  and  then,  as  almost his  last judicial  act  before \nretirement,  heard  and  approved  the  Agreement  and  entered the  Order,'  presumed  that  all  class \nmembers  would  be  eligible  for the  next  nondiscriminatory  examination.  However,  as  the \nCommonwealth  points  out,  and  Plaintiffs’  counsel  acknowledged  at  the  hearing,  neither the \nAgreement  nor the  Order  mention  a  remedy  of‘allowing  class  members  to  sit  for the  September \n2023  test. \n\\ \n'  Order Approving  Class  Action  Settlement,  docket  no.  137,  May  11,  2023. \n2 \nBecause  time  is  of the  essence,  with  the|September  examination  date  only  weeks  away, \nand  HRD’s  contention  that  any  change  in  the  composition  of the  enrolled  test  takers  would  derail \nthat  date,  the  court  has  expeditiously  undertaken  to  hear  and  decide  Plaintiffs’  emergency \nmotion.  For the  reasons  explained below,  the  court  finds  that Plaintiffs have  not  met their burden \nto  show a  likelihood  of a  success  on the  merits  that  Defendants  violated  the  Agreement nor the \nOrder.  Therefore,  Plaintiffs’  Motion  is  DENIED.    \nI.  Job  Analysis  | \nIn  the  Agreement,  the  parties  stated  that  they  could  not  agree  about  the  degree  of \noversight  that  Plaintiffs  should  have related  to  the  development  of the  new exam,  and  they  asked \nJudge  Wilkins  to  decide  the  issue.  The  court  acknowledged  that  it “lack[s]  power to  tell  the \nexecutive  branch  how to  fulfill  statutory  or constitutional  obligations,  particularly  where  the \ndecision  involves  the  expenditure  of funds  and  rovisions  of services  outside  of the  court  system \nproper.”  (Order pg.  5).  The  narrow  exception  is  where,  as  here,  the  court has  found a  statutory \nand  constitutional  violation  and  it  is  left to  the  court to  fashion  a remedy.  The  court  has  both  the \npower  and  authority  to  create  a remedy  for thev iolations  it  found. \n  \nThe  court  attempted  to  thread  that needle  by  denying  Plaintiffs’  request  for  oversight  over \nthe  future  HRD  promotional  exams,  but  instead  sought to  have  the  parties  share  information \nabout the  formation  of the  future  exam.  Thus,  the  Order required  that  Defendants  “[i]n \ndeveloping  the  next  Police  Sergeant’s Promotional  Exam,  ...  forthwith  provide  to  the  plaintiffs’    \nattorneys  and  experts  ....  the  following  documents,  when  completed,  for  review  and  comment:” \n(1) job  analysis;  (2)  proposed  weights  for  components  of the  exam;  (3)  instructions  to  questions   \nwriters;  and  (4)  instructions  to  subject  matter  experts.  (emphasis  added).?  Plaintiffs  focus on  the \n? The court wrote  about this  phrasing  in  its Order:  “[t]his  order avoids  premature disclosure  and  interference with \ndeliberative processes by  waiting until  certain milestones are  complete before  requiring disclosure.”  Order pg.  7. \n3 \n“forthwith”  language  in  the  Order  while  the  Commonwealth  focuses  on  the  “when  completed” \npart  of the  Order. \nPlaintiffs  claim  that the  Commonwealth  has  not provided  it  with  the job  analysis.? \nPlaintiffs  request  the  court  order the  Commonwealth  to  comply  with  the  Order  by  producing  all \ndocuments  related  to  the  completed job  analysis.  The  Commonwealth  claims  that  the job \nanalysis  has  not been  completed  and  may  not  be  available  until  after the  September  exam.’ \nPutting  aside  the  Commonwealth’s  specious  claim  that the  September  exam  requires  a  completed \njob  analysis  and  HRD  will  have  it  for that purpose  but  not  for the  purpose  of “forthwith” \nproviding  it  to  Plaintiffs,  the  court acknowledges  that  “forthwith”  is  couched  in  a proviso,  that  is, \n  \n“when  completed”  the job  analysis  must  be  turned  over  “forthwith.”  Because  HRD  claims  as  of \nthe  date  of the hearing  that the job  analysis was  not  complete,  it  has  not  yet  violated  the  Order. \nThe  court would  expect,  however,  that  the job  analysis  be  completed  and  provided  in  advance  of \n \nthe  September  exam. This then  is  perhaps  ac laim  for an  anticipatory  violation,  but  there  is  still \ntime  for  the  Commonwealth to  comply.  | \nIf.  2023  Exam \nOn  September  17,  2022,  before  Judge  Wilkins  issued his  order  on  liability,  eligible \nindividuals  sat  for the  2022  police  promotional  exam.  Due  to  Judge  Wilkins  decision  on  October \n27,  2022,  however,  the  Commonwealth did not  score  the  September  17,  2022  exam. \nOn  June  8,  2023,  the  Commonwealth  ahnounced  that it would  be readministering  the \n2002  exam  on  September  23,  2023.  The  Commonwealth  is  allowing  only  those  individuals  who \n>  The  Commonwealth  has  either produced  the  other, three  categories  of documents  or will  soon. \n4  An  affidavit from  Regina  Caggiano,  director of the  Civil  Service  Unit for the  Human  Resources \nDivision,  states:  “The  substantive  work  of the job  analysis  has  concluded,  from  which,  for example,  the \nproposed  weights  for the  components  of the  examination  were  established,  and  questions  are  being \nwritten.  The  drafting  of the job  analysis,  which  is alwritten  capstone  document,  has  begun  but  has  not \nbeen  finalized.  The  job  analysis  report will  not be  final  until  after the  post  exam  analysis takes  place.” \n4 \nhad  sat  for the  2022  exam  on  September  17,  2022  to  take  this  “readministered”  exam.  On the \nsame  date,  the  Commonwealth  also  announced|that  it  would  administer the  2023  police \npromotional  exam  on  September 23,  2023.5  The  2022  “readministered”  exam  and  the  2023 \n  \npolice  promotional  exam  are  the  same  exam. \nPlaintiffs  object to  HRD’s  limitation  on the  eligible  test takers,  and  more  particularly  for \ndenying  all  class  members  the  opportunity,  if they  wish,  to  take  the  September  exam.  Plaintiffs \nclaim  that  “[t]he  whole  purpose  of the  settlement  agreement  is  to  give  minority  candidates  an \nopportunity  to  take  a nondiscriminatory  exam  in  2023  after being  deprived  of that  opportunity \nfor years.”  Plaintiffs’  Motion,  pg.  3.  Plaintiffs  submitted  the  affidavit  of one  class  member, \nOfficer  Cano  of Lawrence,  who  averred  that  he  did  not  sign  up  for the  2022  exam  because  he \n  \nbelieved  it to  be  discriminatory  only  to  learn  that  he  is  now  ineligible  to  sit for  the  September    \n2023  exam.  Plaintiffs  thus  seek to  enjoin  the  Commonwealth  from  excluding  class  members \n \nfrom  taking  the  exam  on  September 23,  2023. \nA  party  seeking  a preliminary  injunction  must  show:  (1)  a  likelihood  of success  on  the \nmerits;  (2)  that  irreparable  harm will  result froin  the  denial  of the  injunction;  and  (3)  that,  in  light \nof the  plaintiffs  likelihood  of success  on the terits,  the  risk  of irreparable  harm  to  the  plaintiff \noutweighs  the  potential  harm  to  the  defendant  in  granting  the  injunction.”  Tri-Nel Mgmt.  v. \nBoard of Health,  433  Mass.  217,  219  (2001),  citing  Packaging Indus.

In  addition,  “[w]hen  alparty  seeks  to  enjoin  governmental  action,  a judge \nis  also  required  to  determine  that  the  requested order promotes  the public  interest,  or, \nalternatively,  that  the  equitable  relief will  not  fdversely  affect the  public.”  Boston Police \n3  To  be  eligible  for this  exam,  a  candidate’s  police  department must be participating.

Police  Department  of Boston,  446  Mass.  46,  49-50  (2006) \n(citations  and  quotations  omitted). \nAs  stated  above,  there  is  nothing  in  the  Agreement  nor  Order  about the  ability  of class \nmembers  to  take  the  next  exam  (whenever  it might  have  been  scheduled).  The  Agreement \nfocused  on  a monetary  remedy  for past violations  and  the  creation  of a  fair  exam  in  the  future. \nThe  Agreement  and  Order  are  comprehensive  documents  that  contain  considerable detail  about \nthe  proceedings,  the  remedy,  and  how the  monetary  proceeds  are  to  be  allocated.  No  mention  is \nmade  in  either  document  of creating  an  additional  remedy  to  declare  all  class  members eligible \nfor the  September test.  Aside  from the  affidavit  of Officer  Cano,  there  are  no  other  class \nmembers  identified  as  seeking  to  take  the  September test.  The  court  therefore  does  not  know  if \n    \nthe  number  of potential  additional  test takers  is  1  —  or  in the  hundreds.  More  importantly,  none \nof the  class  action  settlement  documents  sent to  the  class  members  refer to  this  potential  remedy \n \nor  put  them  on  notice  of the  possibility.  It  is  hard  to  square  Plaintiffs’  position  that  this  remedy \nwas  always  contemplated  by  the  parties,  and  the  fact that  it was  never  mentioned  or  referenced  in \nthe  Agreement  or  Order  is  somehow further proof of how integral  it was  to  the  parties’ \nsettlement.  The  court  understands  Plaintiffs  to)argue  that  it was  Judge  Wilkins’  intent  that this \nremedy  would  naturally  have  been  offered  andjextended  to  all  class  members.  However,  the \ncurrent judge  does  not have  the  same  history  with this  case  and  cannot  presume  to  assume  she \nhas  insight  into  what  another judge  may  have  intended.  What  is  now  before  the  court  are  the \nAgreement  and  the  Order  and  it  is  those  documents  that control  the  court’s  decision  here.  Based \non  those  documents,  the  court  concludes  that Plaintiffs  have  not  shown  that they  are  likely  to \nsucceed  on  their  claim  that  Defendants  breached  the Agreement  or  the  Order. \nThat  Plaintiffs  have  not  made  this  wt  is  sufficient to  deny  injunctive  relief.  See  Tri- \nNel Mgmt.,  Inc.,  433 Mass.  at  227. \n  \nORDER \nFor the  foregoing  reasons,  Plaintiffs’  Emergency  Motion to  Enforce  the  Settlement \nAgreement  and/or  for  a Temporary  Injunction  is  DENIED. \nDATE:  AUGUST  10,  2023 \n \n  \n\n############# Old Text on 20240903 ###############\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
