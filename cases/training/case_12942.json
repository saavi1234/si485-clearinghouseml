Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) directs the clerk to serve notice of the court's orders entries on parties as provided in Rule 5(b); Rule 5(b)(1), in turn, provides that \"[i]f a party is represented by attorney, service under this rule must be made on the attorney unless the court orders service on the party.\" The Court sees no reason to deviate from the general rule in this case, and therefore declines to order that Mr. Snider be served directly, with the exception of this Order . After this Order is served, the consent form filed by Mr. Snider shall have no effect in this case as long as Mr. Snider is represented by counsel.

    "summary": "<p>On May 31, 2011, prisoners incarcerated in the Special Confinement Unit at the Wabash Valley Correctional Facility filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, against the Indiana Department of Corrections (\"DOC\"). The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Indiana, claimed that they were not being provided with the minimally adequate diet required by the Eighth Amendment. They asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief. </p><p>Plaintiffs complained that they were routinely served meals that failed to meet minimum caloric requirements. While the contract between the DOC and its food services provider stated that meals must be prepared according to menus approved by dietitians, food was frequently missing from the plaintiffs' meals. As a result, the plaintiffs received insufficient amounts of food and calories and experienced significant weight loss and various other health problems. </p><p>On November 4, 2013, Magistrate Judge Mark Dinsmore issued an order approving the parties' private settlement agreement. The agreement specified certain monitoring measures requiring the DOC to ensure adequate diets, including the requirement that one or more correctional officers randomly check a number of the food trays before meal delivery. The agreement also mandated that prison officials correct and record any food deficiencies or shortages. The parties agreed that absent an order from the Court, the agreement would remain in effect for six months after its effective date, at which point the case would be automatically dismissed without prejudice.  The docket as of January 17, 2020 shows no further filings, so presumably the case is closed. </p>",

Introduction \n1.   This is an action for declaratory and in junctive relief brought  by Bill Snider, c laiming \nthat he and other prisoners confined to the Special Confinement Unit (“SCU”) at Wabash Valley \nCorrectional Facility are receiving an inadequate diet in violation of the Eighth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution. \n2.   This action has been certified as a class act ion pursuant to Rule 23( a) and (b)(2) of the  \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The class is defined as: \nAll prisoners now, and in the future, conf ined to the Special Confinement Unit at \nWabash Valley Correctional Facility. \n \n(ECF No. 34). \n3.  The defendants do not concede the m erits of  any of the alleg ations of the plain tiffs’ \ncomplaint.  However, the parties are des irous of reachin g a settlement of this m atter and \nPage | 1  \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-00731-MJD-WTL   Document 88   Filed 08/26/13   Page 2 of 6 PageID #: 199\n \ntherefore they enter into this S tipulation. Plaintiffs agree that de fendants’ entry into this P rivate \nSettlement Agreement (“Agreement”) is not an admission of any kind a nd imposes no liability \non the defendants for any violation of law, constitutional or otherwise. \n4.  Although plaintiffs’ counsel ha s signed this Stipulation, th e parties agree that this \nStipulation will not be deemed to be approv ed by the class until notice is given to the c lass as \nprovided in paragraph 15 and until plaintiffs’ counsel notifies the Court and the parties following \nthe class notice and the Court finds that this Agreement is a fair and just resolution of this matter.  \nFor purposes of this Stipulation this latter date will be referred to as “the effective date.” \n5.  Insofar as the plaintiffs have sought relief  under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of   the \nUnited States Constitution, this li tigation is subject to  the Prison Litigation Reform  Act, 18 \nU.S.C. § 3626, et seq.  This Act imposes certain requirem ents on agreements made in litigation \nsuch as this, but provides that the parties m ay enter into private agreements which are exempted \nfrom the requirem ents of the Act.  18 U.S.C.  § 3626(c).  However, such agreements are not \nsubject to enforcement under federal law other th an reinstatement of the proceedin gs, although \nthey are enforceable under state law regarding breaches of contract.  Id. \n6.  Accordingly, to the extent that the p arties agree to the terms and conditions as set forth \nbelow, this is deem ed to be a private settle ment agreement under the Prison Litigation Refor m \nAct. \nII.   Private Settlement Agreement – Substantive Terms \n7.  In order to assure that th e food served to prisoners with in the SCU is served in the \nquantity provided on th e daily m enus at e ach meal, the def endants will hav e one or m ore \ncorrectional officers randomly check a num ber of the food trays before th ey are served to the \nprisoners.  If any problems are noted concerning the quantities all necessary steps will be taken \nPage | 2  \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-00731-MJD-WTL   Document 88   Filed 08/26/13   Page 3 of 6 PageID #: 200\n \nto correct the shortage before the food is served to the prisoners. \n8.   If any shortages are noted on any of the tray s, the deficien cies will be  recorded a nd a \npermanent written record will be made by the defendants of the deficiencies. \n9.   Once food is delivered, the prisoners m ust imm ediately inform  t he custody staff \ndelivering the meals if they have any issues with the quantities on their trays.   \n10.   In the even t of a complain t by a pris oner, custody staff delivering  the m eal will \nimmediately inspect the tray and if there is a co nfirmed shortage of any item(s) as compared to \nthe menu or if there is som e other problem  with the food that renders  it inedible, the staff \nmembers shall provide the item that was om itted or a com plete replacement tray as quickly as \npossible.  A copy of the daily m enu shall be lo cated in each control p od of the SCU for this \npurpose. \n11.   If a replacement item or tray is issued, custody staff must document this in writing on the \nWabash Valley Correctional Facility Special Confinement Unit Meal Flow Sheet. \n12.   During the pendency of this Agreem ent c ounsel for plaintiffs has the right, with \nreasonable prior notice, to inspect the activ ity sheets, logbooks, and permanent written records \nmentioned above. \nIII.  Costs and attorneys’ fees \n13.   The parties agrees th at each side sh all be responsible for their costs and attorneys’ fees \nand plaintiffs waive any and all claims to costs and attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 \nor any other statute or rule. \nIV.   Notice to the Class \n14.   The parties acknowledge that Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires \nthat before a class action can be dismissed or compromised that notice must be given to the class \nPage | 3  \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-00731-MJD-WTL   Document 88   Filed 08/26/13   Page 4 of 6 PageID #: 201\n \nmembers and the Court must determine that this Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. \n15.   Attached to this Agreement is a proposed notice that plain tiffs’ counsel has prepared for \nthe class.  The parties agree th at this notice, if approved by  the Court, should be given by \ndelivering the notice to each prisoner in the SCU on a date to be selected by the defendants and \nby posting the notice in a prominent area within each pod in the SCU for 14 days. \n16.   No earlier than 30 days following the date th e notice is distributed  to the class, counsel \nfor plaintiffs will report to the Court and to the def endants as to the comments received f rom \nclass members and will m ake further recommendations as to whether, in counsel’s estim ation, \nthe Agreement is a fair, reasonable, and adequate resolution of this matter pursuant to Rule 23(e) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Plaintiffs’ counsel believes that this Agreement is a just \nand equitable resolution of the current contested matters in this cause but wishes to hear from the \nclass before rendering a final opinion. \nIV.   Further proceedings \n17.  As specified, the parties intend this to be a  private settlement agreement resolving all of \nthe contested issues in this cause. After the effective date of this Agreement either party reserves \nthe right to seek a furth er hearing before the Court if deemed appropriate.  However, absent an \nemergency, prior to seeking any enforcem ent of this Agreement or prior to seeking to have this \ncase placed back before the Court, plain tiffs will communicate with the defendants’ counsel at \nleast 10 days prior to the filing.  Likewise, absent an emergency, prior to seeking any changes in \nthis Agreement in Court the defendants will communicate with the plaintiffs’ counsel at least 10 \ndays prior to the filing. \n18.   The parties agree that absent an order from  the Court or a subsequent w ritten agreement \nby the parties, this Agreem ent, if a pproved, should rem ain in effect for six m onths after the \nPage | 4  \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-00731-MJD-WTL   Document 88   Filed 08/26/13   Page 5 of 6 PageID #: 202\n \neffective date at which time the case will be automatically dismissed without prejudice. \n  \nV.  Parties’ Further Requests of the Court \nThe parties request that this Court: \na.  Approve the proposed class notice and orde r that the notice be given to the class \nas provided in paragraph 15 of this Agreement and that  plaintiffs’ counsel be required to \nreport back to the Court as provided in paragraph 16 of this Agreement. \n \nb.  Find, after the required notice, that this proposed private settlement agreement is a  \nfair, reasonable, and adequate pursuant to  Rule 23(e) of  the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. \n \nc..

On November 4, 2013, this \nCourt held a fairness hearing pursuant to Rule 23(e)  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to \ndetermine whether the proposed settlem ent is a fair, reasonable, and adequate resolution of this \nmatter.  The parties appeared by counsel at the hearing. \nHaving considered the Private Settlement Agreement (ECF No. 88), the Report of  Class \nCounsel Following Notice to the Class (ECF No. 98), the Supplemental Report of Class Counsel \n(ECF No. 99), as well as the argum ents of counsel at the fairness hearing, and the record in this \nmatter, \nIT IS HEREBY FOUND that: \n1.   This action was filed on May 31, 2011 and a lleged that prisoners within the Special \nConfinement Unit at Wabash Valley Correctional Facility were not being provided with the \nminimally adequate diet required by the Eighth Am endment to the United States \n\nCase 1:11-cv-00731-MJD-WTL   Document 101   Filed 11/04/13   Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 273\nConstitution. \n2.  On January 23, 2012, this Court certified this casea s a class action witht he class defined as: \nAAll prisoners now, and in the future, confined to the Special Confinement Unit at Wabash \nValley Correctional Facility.”  (ECF No. 34). \n3.  The Private Settlement Agreement is designed to settle all pending matters in this litigation. \n4.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject m atter of this cause and over all the parties, \nincluding the members of the certified class. \n5.  The parties have consented to the referral of this case to Magistrate Judge Dinsmore and this \nreferral has been so ordered. (ECF No. 90). \n6.  The class has been given proper and adequaten otice of the proposed resolution of this case \nthrough the Private Settlem ent Agreement.   This notice was given as required by the \nSeptember 9, 2013 Order of the Magistrate Judge in this cause. (ECF No. 94).  The notice \ninvited class members to notify class counsel as to any objections to, or comments on, the \nproposed dism issal.  The notice provided  valid, due, and sufficient notice of these \nproceedings and the m atters set forth ther ein and included inform ation regarding the \nprocedures for making any objections to the Private Settlement Agreement. \n7.  The notice given to the class fully satisfied the requirements of Rule 23, Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, and the requirements of due process. \n8.  The Court has reviewed the comments of the class members as reported by class counsel. \n9.  Following the standards established by Synfuel Technologies, Inc. v. DHL Express, Inc.,4 63 \nF.3d 646, 653 (7th Cir. 2006), the Court finds that the Private Settlement Agreement and the \nplanned dismissal of this action six months from this date is fair, reasonable, and adequate \nfor the following reasons. \n  2\n\nCase 1:11-cv-00731-MJD-WTL   Document 101   Filed 11/04/13   Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 274\nA.  The purpose of this litigation was to remedy the allegedly inadequate food \nportions in the Special Confinement Unit at the Wabash Valley Correctional \nFacility. Because of steps that have  been introduced subsequent to the \nlitigation being filed in this case, the problem s that gave rise to this case \nappear to have been ameliorated to a great extent. The Private Settlem ent \nAgreement provides for m onitoring m easures by the Departm ent of \nCorrection to continue and also allows for monitoring by class counsel.This \nshould help ensure that there will not be future problems. Given the current \nstatus of the case the Court finds that the comparison of the strength of this \ncase with the settlement presented favors dismissal in this case.   \nB.  The complexity, length, and expense of continued litigation weigh in favor of \nfinding the proposed dism issal to be  fair, reasonable, and adequate.   \nContinued litigation would require a lengthy trial and extensive trial \npreparation including extensive further discovery.  Further delay and costs \nwould not be in the best interests of the parties.  Paragraph 17 of the Private \nSettlement Agreement allows either party to revive this litigation and seek \nfurther hearings in this Court.  This will allow plaintiffs to seek further and \nimmediate legal redress if the Private Settlement Agreement is not, in the \nclass counsel’s estimation, successful in remedying the alleged problems that \ngave rise to this litigation.  \nC.  As indicated, the Court has reviewed the reports filed by plaintiffs’ counsel \nconcerning comments received by the class.  In response to the cnocerns that \ncounsel had expressed defendants’ counsel has stated that steps are in place \n  3\n\nCase 1:11-cv-00731-MJD-WTL   Document 101   Filed 11/04/13   Page 4 of 5 PageID #: 275\nto ensure that any problems with food portions are immediately rectified. The \nCourt has no opinion concerning the factual or legal merit of the comments \nof the class members or defendants’ response.  However, the Court does not \nfind that the level of opposition is suffi cient for the Court to question the \nPrivate Settlement Agreement. \nD.  There is no evidence of any collusion between the parties in entering into the \nPrivate Settlement Agreement.  The C ourt is satisf ied that the Private \nSettlement Agreement is the result of an arms-length negotiation. \nE.  Class counsel is experienced in cla ss action litigation generally and class \naction litigation concerning prisons in particular. \nF.  The stage of the proceedings and am ount of discovery weigh in favor of \nfinding that the Private Settlem ent Agreement is f air, reasonable, and \nadequate.  Discovery was conducted pr ior to entering into the Private \nSettlement Agreement. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Private Settlement Agreement is a fair, \nreasonable, and adequate resolution of this matter. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that, pursuant to the Private Settlement Agreement, this case \nis now listed as inactive on this Court’s docket and, asbent an order from this Court or a subsequent \nwritten agreement by the parties, this case will be dismissed on May 5, 2014, without further notice. \nThe dismissal will be without prejudice. \nIT IS SO FOUND AND ORDERED on this 4th day of November, 2013 \n   \n. \n \n \n \n                   \n4\nMMaarrkk  JJ..

After this Order is\nserved, the consent form filed by Mr. Snider shall have no effect in this case as\nlong as Mr. Snider is represented by counsel.

Bill Snider is confined in the Special Confinement Unit (SCU) an Indiana Department of \nCorrection (DOC) facility that is  located  within the Wabash Valley Correctional  Facility in \nCarlisle,  Indiana.  Prisoners  within  the  SCU  are  regularly  served  meals  that  fail  to  meet \nminimum caloric requirements.  Prisoners complain of the deficient diet and are told that the \nmatter will be rectified, but the deficiencies continue. The lack of an adequate diet has lead to \nserious health problems for Bill Snider and the putative class and violates the Eighth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution.  Appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief should issue. \nJurisdiction, venue and cause of action \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n3.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.c. § 1391. \n4.  Declaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n\nCase 1:11-cv-00731-MJD-WTL   Document 1   Filed 05/31/11   Page 2 of 6 PageID #: 2\n5.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  § 1983 to redress the deprivation, under \ncolor of state law, of rights secured by the Constitution of the United States. \nParties \n6.  Bill Snider is an adult prisoner currently confined to the Seu. \n7.  The Unit Manager of the SCU is the DOC employee who is in charge of the day-to-day \noperations of the unit and is sued pursuant to Rule 17(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n8.  The  Superintendent  of the  Wabash  Valley  Correctional  Facility  is  in  charge  of the \noperations of the facility, including the seu and is sued pursuant to Rule 17(d) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure. \nClass action allegations \n9.  This action is brought by Bill Snider on his own behalf and on behalf of a class of those \nsimilarly situated pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n10.  The class is defined as: \nAll prisoner now, and in the future, confined to the Special Confinement Unit at \nWabash Valley Correctional Facility \n11.  As defined, the class meets all the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nSpecifically: \na.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  The SCU \nhouses more than 200 prisoners. \nb.  There are questions of law or fact common to the class:  whether the persistent \nserving of food  portions significantly less than the prepared diets violates the Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \nc.  The claims of the representative party are typical of those of the class. \nd.  The representative party will  fairly  and  adequately protect the  interests of the \nclass. \n2 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-00731-MJD-WTL   Document 1   Filed 05/31/11   Page 3 of 6 PageID #: 3\n12.  The further requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are met \n~~, .. , \nin this cause in that defendants have, at all times, acted or refused to act in a manner generally \napplicable to the class, thereby making final injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate with \nrespect to the class as a whole. \n13.  Plaintiffs counsel should be appointed to represent the class pursuant to Rule 23(g) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nFactual allegations \n14.  The SCU is a long-term segregation unit where prisoners are confined for long periods of \ntime either in administrative segregation or disciplinary segregation. \n15.  The Unit is lead by its Unit Manager who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of \nthe unit. \n16.  The head of Wabash Valley Correctional Facility is its Superintendent. \n17.  Prisoners in the SCU receive meals three times a day in their cells. \n, \n18.  Prisoners are generally confined to their small solitary cells except for an opportunity for \nrecreation seven days a week for an hour and a brief opportunity for a shower. \n19.  The recreation takes places in small cages. \n20.  The rest ofthe time the prisoners are generally confined to their cells. \n21.  The  DOC  has  contracted  its  food  services  responsibility  to  Aramark  Correctional \nServices  (\"Aramark\")  and,  with  the assistance of prison employees,  and  under the ultimate \nsupervision  of DOC  employees,  Aramark  employees  prepare meals  in  the  DOC  institution, \nincluding the meals for prisoners in the SCU. \n22.  Pursuant  to  the  contract  between  the  DOC  and  Aramark,  prisoner meals  are  to  be \nprepared according to menus that provide the prisoners between 2500 and 2800 calories per day. \n3 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-00731-MJD-WTL   Document 1   Filed 05/31/11   Page 4 of 6 PageID #: 4\n,y \n23 .  Aramark has constructed published menus, approved by dieticians, which provide this \n• < \ndiet. \n24.  Despite the menus that are designed to provide the minimum adequate calories and diets \n'\",', \nfor the prisoners in the seu, food is frequently missing from  Mr.  Snider's and other seu's \nprisoners trays. \n25.  As  a  result,  Mr.  Snider  and  the  prisoners  are  recelvmg  significantly less  food,  and \ncalories, as is required by the contract between Doe and Aramark and as is required to assure \nthe health and well-being ofthe prisoners. \n26.  Mr.  Snider and  many other prisoners  have  frequently  complained  about  the  dietary \ndeficiencies. \n27.  At  times,  DOe  personnel  have  acknowledged  the  deficiencies.  For  example,  in  a \ngrievance response entered in October of 2010, a Doe employee noted that \"food supply to \nprovide the required meals is not always present in the seu.\" \n28.  This echoes an October 2009 finding by the Indiana State Department of Health that \nverified that proper portions were not being served to prisoners. \n29.  Both defendant Superintendent and defendant Unit Manager are aware of the problems \nwith seu prisoners not receiving the proper amounts of food. \n30.  Nevertheless, despite these substantiated complaints and subsequent promises to rectify \nthe matter, food portions continue to be frequently short. \n31.  This has led to many prisoners losing significant amounts of weight because of caloric \nand portion deficiencies. \n32.  Bill Snider had been confined in the seu since March of 2008. \n4 \n\nj', \nCase 1:11-cv-00731-MJD-WTL   Document 1   Filed 05/31/11   Page 5 of 6 PageID #: 5\nseu \n33.  Upon entering the  and being served inadequate amounts of food, Mr.  Snider lost \nweight. \n34.  However, since May of2008 he has been able to purchase food from commissary. \n35.  He was forced to purchase food items from commissary to attempt to supplement the lack \nof healthy calories from the regular diet that was consistently inadequate .. \n36.  However, the foods on commissary are high in salt, fat, and cholesterol. \n37.  Because he is locked up in a small cell for almost all of his days, Mr. Snider has limited \nopportunities for exercise. \n38.  Because of the inadequacy of the diet being served and his need to supplement it with \nfood from commissary, Mr. Snider has actually gained weight.  He has been diagnosed as having \nbenign  essential  hypertension  and  has  been  prescribed  lopressor  to  control  his  high  blood \npressure. \nseu \n39.  Many of the other  prisoners do not have money to buy foods on commissary and, as \na result, are suffering continuing weight loss. \n40.  Mr. Snider has exhausted all grievances concerning the diet issue. (Attached). \n41.  Prisoners  have  frequently  complained  to  the  defendants,  other  than  through  fonnal \ngrievances, concerning the dietary problems. \n42.  The defendants are aware of the deficient diets, but have done nothing to remedy the \nproblem. \n43.  Mr. Snider and the putative class are being caused irreparable hann for which there is no \nadequate remedy at law. \n44.  At all times defendants have acted under color of state law. \n5 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-00731-MJD-WTL   Document 1   Filed 05/31/11   Page 6 of 6 PageID #: 6\nClaim for relief \n45.  The failure of defendants to supply to Mr. Snider and the putative class with a minimally \nadequate diet represents deliberate indifference to the serious risk of physical hann, and the \nactual  hann,  caused to  Mr.  Snider and  the putative  class  and  therefore  violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \nRequest for relief \nWHEREFORE, plaintiff requests that this Court: \na.  Accept jurisdiction ofthis case and set it for hearing at the earliest opportunity. \nb.  Certify this case as a class action with the class as defined above. \nc.  Enter  a  declaratory  injunction  that  defendants  have  violated  the  Eighth \nAmendment for the reasons noted above. \nd.  Enter a pennanent injunction enjoining defendants to take all steps to assure that \npnsoners  in  the  SCU  receive  the  diets  and  portions  specified  in  dietician-approved \nmenus. \ne.  Award plaintiff his costs and attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nf.  Award all other proper relief. \nKenn  alk, Ind. Bar No. 6777-49 \nJan P.
