Meanwhile, the district court took judicial notice of a New York Times article by Charlie Savage, U.S. Admits for First Time Drones Killed 4 Americans, N.Y. Times, May 22, 2013, and requested briefing on how the statements of the Attorney General of the United States affected the legal issues in the case.</p><p>On April 4, 2014, the Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss, due heavily to special factors that precluded a cause of action under Bivens. The Court found no Fourth Amendment claim because there was no actual seizure of the decedents. The Court found no Fifth Amendment claim for two of the Plaintiffs because their deaths were unanticipated, which amounted only to negligence and not a violation of Fifth Amendment substantive due process rights. The Court stated the claim against the third decedent appeared plausible as the death was not unintended. The Court then found that applying Bivens in this case would be inappropriate, as it would be an unprecedented application of Bivens which would \"draw the Court into 'the heart of executive and military planning and deliberation'\" because the Court would have to examine national security policy, military chain of command, and operational combat decisions.

The missile also killed Samir Khan, who was riding in the same vehicle.  \nBoth men were U.S. citizens.  Two weeks later, on October 14, 2014, the United States killed \nadditional individuals in Yemen with a missile from another drone.  While this second drone \ntargeted someone else, among those it killed was Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi, Anwar Al-Aulaqi’s \nteenage son.  Nasser Al-Aulaqi, father of Anwar and grandfather of Abdulrahman, and Sarah \nKhan, mother of Samir, sue various U.S. officials in their personal capacities.  Plaintiffs claim, \ninter alia, that these officials violated the Fifth Amendment rights of the decedents by \nauthorizing the drone strikes.  The question presented is whether federal officials can be held \npersonally liable for their roles in drone strikes abroad that target and kill U.S. citizens.  The \nquestion raises fundamental issues regarding constitutional principles, and it is not easy to \n1 \n \n\nanswer.  However, on these facts and under this Circuit’s precedent, the Court will grant \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss. \nI.  FACTS \n  A.  The Drone Strikes and Prior Suit \n    President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, Jr., have admitted \nthat the United States targeted and killed Anwar Al-Aulaqi, a terrorist who was a key leader of \nal-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).  See Def. Resp. to May 22, 2013 Order [Dkt. 26], \nEx. 1 [Dkt. 26-1], Letter from AG Holder (May 22, 2013) (AG Letter) at 1-2; see also id., Ex. 2 \n[Dkt. 26-2], Remarks by President Obama at the National Defense University (May 23, 2013) \n(President Obama Speech) at 9-10.  They also have acknowledged that Mr. Khan and \nAbdulrahman Al-Aulaqi were killed as “bystanders” by U.S. drones that targeted someone else.  \nAG Letter at 2. \n    More than a year before Anwar Al-Aulaqi was killed, the U.S. Joint Special \nOperations Command (JSOC)1 had placed him on a military “kill list” and tried unsuccessfully \nto kill him.  Compl. [Dkt. 3] ¶¶ 2, 23 (citing Dana Priest, U.S. Military Teams, Intelligence \nDeeply Involved in Aiding Yemen on Strikes, Wash. Post, Jan. 27, 2010).  The Office of Legal \nCounsel within the U.S. Department of Justice allegedly completed a memorandum that provided \nlegal justification for killing Anwar Al-Aulaqi overseas.  See id. ¶ 25 (citing Charlie Savage, \nSecret U.S. Memo Made Legal Case to Kill a Citizen, N.Y. Times, Oct. 8, 2011).2  Government \nofficials told reporters that Anwar Al-Aulaqi had “cast his lot” with terrorist groups, encouraged \n                                                 \n1 JSOC is a component of the Department of Defense. \n2 See Dep’t of Justice White Paper, Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. \nCitizen Who Is a Senior Operational Leader of Al-Qa’ida or An Associated Force, (Nov. 8, 2011 \ndraft), http://bit.ly/Wv7Cdh (last visited Apr. 4, 2014). \n2 \n \n\nothers to engage in terrorist activity, and “played a key role in setting the strategic direction” for \nAQAP.  See id. ¶ 26.  Leon Panetta, former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),3 \nand Admiral William H. McRaven, former Commander of JSOC,4 allegedly participated in the \ndecision to add Anwar Al-Aulaqi to the list.  Id. ¶ 24.  The U.S. Government never publicly \nindicted or prosecuted Anwar Al-Aulaqi for any crime.  Id. ¶ 26. \n    Upon hearing rumors that the United States had placed Anwar Al-Aulaqi on a kill \nlist, Nasser Al-Aulaqi filed suit on behalf of his son against the President, CIA Director, and \nSecretary of Defense in their official capacities.  See Al-Aulaqi v. Obama, Civ. No. 10-1469 \n(D.D.C.), Compl. filed Aug. 30, 2010.  That suit, captioned Al-Aulaqi v. Obama, sought to enjoin \nthe Government from carrying out the planned killing of Anwar Al-Aulaqi unless “he presented \na concrete, specific, and imminent threat to life, and that there were no reasonably available \nmeasures short of lethal force that could be expected to address that threat.”  Compl. [Dkt. 3] \n¶ 27 (describing prior suit).  The United States moved to dismiss the complaint and invoked the \n“military and state secrets” privilege.5  See Al-Aulaqi v. Obama, Civ. No. 10-1469, Mot. to \nDismiss (filed Sept. 25, 2010).  In support of the privilege, the Government submitted both \nunclassified and classified declarations from James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence; \n                                                 \n3 Mr. Panetta served as Director of the CIA from February 13, 2009 to June 30, 2011, and as \nSecretary of Defense from July 1, 2011 to February 27, 2013. \n4 Admiral McRaven was JSOC Commander from June 2008 to June 2011.  See U.S. Navy \nBiography of Admiral McRaven, http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=401 \n(last visited Apr. 4, 2014). \n5 The state secrets privilege encompasses two applications:  one completely bars adjudication of \nclaims based on state secrets, which requires dismissal, and the other excludes privileged \nevidence from the case, which may result in dismissal.  Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc., \n614 F.3d 1070, 1077 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc).  “The state secrets privilege is premised on the \nrecognition that ‘in exceptional circumstances courts must act in the interest of the country’s \nnational security to prevent disclosure of state secrets, even to the point of dismissing a case \nentirely.’”  Id. (citing Totten v. United States, 92 U.S. 105, 107 (1876)). \n3 \n \n\nRobert Gates, then-Secretary of Defense; and Leon Panetta, then-Director of the CIA.  See id., \nMot. to Dismiss, Ex. 1 (Clapper Decl.), Ex. 4 (Gates Decl.), & Ex. 5 (Panetta Decl.).  While \ninvoking the state secrets privilege, the Government advised the district court that it need not and \nshould not reach the privilege issue because the case could be resolved on other grounds.  \nAgreeing with the Government, Judge John Bates did not address the issue of state secrets and \ninstead resolved the case on different legal principles.  Al-Aulaqi v. Obama, 727 F. Supp. 2d 1, \n52-54 (D.D.C. 2010).  Judge Bates dismissed the suit, finding that Nasser Al-Aulaqi did not have \nstanding to assert his son’s constitutional rights, see id. at 14-35, and that at least some of the \nissues raised were non-justiciable political questions, see id. at 44-52.  Nasser Al-Aulaqi did not \nappeal. \n    On the morning of September 30, 2011, the plan to kill Anwar Al-Aulaqi came to \nfruition.  On that day, Anwar Al-Aulaqi and Samir Khan were in a vehicle in the Yemeni \nprovince of al-Jawf, approximately ninety miles northeast of Sana’a.  Compl. ¶ 31.  Missiles \nfrom one or more unmanned U.S. drones hit the vehicle and destroyed it, killing them and at \nleast two others.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants had been surveilling Anwar Al-Aulaqi for \nweeks.  Id. ¶ 31 (citing media reports).  According to the Complaint, the surveillance and the \nstrike were carried out by CIA and JSOC, after Defendants personally authorized and directed \nthe strike.  Id. ¶¶ 12-15, 32. \n    Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi was killed by a separate U.S. drone strike two weeks \nlater.  He was in an open-air café near the town of Azzan, in the southern Yemeni province of \nShabwa, on October 14, 2011, when a U.S. drone fired a missile at a person at or near the \nrestaurant.  Id. ¶ 37.  The drone allegedly targeted Ibraham Al-Banna, an Egyptian national.  Id.  \n4 \n \n\nWhile it was reported that Mr. Al-Banna was not killed, the strike did kill at least seven people, \nincluding Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi.  Id. \n  B.  Designation of Anwar Al-Aulaqi as a Terrorist \n    More than a year before the September 30, 2011 drone strike against Anwar Al-\nAulaqi, the U.S. Department of the Treasury had designated him as a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist, expressly finding him to be a key leader of AQAP.  See Designation of Anwar \nAl-Aulaqi Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations, 75 \nFed. Reg. 43,233-01 (July 23, 2010) (publically announced July 12, 2010).  Executive Order \n13224,6 issued by President George W. Bush on September 23, 2001, declared a national \nemergency for the purpose of addressing grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism.  The \nExecutive Order authorized the imposition of economic sanctions on named persons and entities \nwho have committed, pose a significant risk of committing, or support acts of terrorism.  To \nimplement the Order, the Secretary of the Treasury promulgated Global Terrorism Sanctions \nRegulations, see 31 C.F.R. Part 594, and delegated his authority over the Sanctions Regulations \nto the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), see 31 C.F.R. § 594.802. \n    Pursuant to the Executive Order and the Sanctions Regulations, on July 12, 2010, \nthe Director of OFAC named Anwar Al-Aulaqi as a key leader of AQAP and added his name to \nthe list of those subject to economic sanctions.  In consultation with the Departments of State, \nHomeland Security, Justice, and other relevant agencies, OFAC designated Anwar Al-Aulaqi “as \nan individual whose property and interests in property are blocked” because he was “acting for \nor on behalf of [AQAP]” and he was “providing financial, material or technological support for, \n                                                 \n6 Executive Order 13224 was issued pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers \nAct, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1701-1706, and the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, 22 U.S.C. \n§ 287c. \n5 \n \n\nor other services to or in support of, acts of terrorism . . . .”  75 Fed. Reg. at 43,233-34; cf. 31 \nC.F.R. § 594.201 (providing that Treasury, in consultation with other agencies, can block access \nto property of persons determined to assist in terrorism or provide support to terrorists). \n    Specifically, OFAC determined that Anwar Al-Aulaqi was a key leader in AQAP \nwho had been, and continued to be, involved in recruiting, training, and preparing terrorists for \nattacks on U.S. targets as follows: \nANWAR AL-AULAQI, a dual U.S.-Yemeni citizen, is a leader of \nal-Qa’ida in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP), a Yemen-based terrorist \ngroup7 that has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist acts8 \nagainst Saudi, Korean, Yemeni, and U.S. targets since its inception \nin January 2009. ANWAR AL-AULAQI has pledged an oath of \nloyalty to AQAP emir, Nasir al-Wahishi, and is playing a key role \nin  setting  the  strategic  direction  for  AQAP.  ANWAR  AL-\nAULAQI has also recruited individuals to join AQAP, facilitated \ntraining at camps in Yemen in support of acts of terrorism, and \nhelped  focus  AQAP’s  attention  on  planning  attacks  on  U.S. \ninterests. \n \nSince  late  2009,  ANWAR  AL-AULAQI  has  taken  on  an \nincreasingly  operational  role  in  the  group,  including  preparing \nUmar  Farouk  Abdulmutallab,  who  attempted  to  detonate  an \nexplosive  device  aboard  a  Northwest  Airlines  flight  from \nAmsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, for his operation.  \n                                                 \n7 It is the Executive Branch’s position that AQAP is a Yemen-based terrorist group that is either \npart of, or associated with, al-Qa’ida.  See Statement of Michael Leiter, Director of the National \nCounterterrorism Center, Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, “Nine \nYears After 9/11: Confronting the Terrorist Threat to the Homeland,” Sept. 22, 2010 (Director \nLeiter Statement) at 2, 4-5 (found in record of related case, Al-Aulaqi v. Obama, Civ. No. 10-cv-\n1469, Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. 3).  Director Leiter indicated that “[w]e witnessed the reemergence of \nAQAP in early 2009 and continue to view Yemen as a key battleground and potential regional \nbase of operations from which AQAP can plan attacks, train recruits, and facilitate the movement \nof operatives.”  Id. at 4.  As explained below, the Court takes judicial notice of certain positions \nof the Executive Branch identified in this Opinion. \n \n8 These include: the March 2009 suicide bombing against South Korean tourists in Yemen; the \nAugust 2009 attempt to assassinate Saudi Prince Muhammad bin Nayif; the December 25, 2009 \nfailed mid-air bombing of Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit, Michigan; and the \nApril 26, 2010 attempted assassination of the United Kingdom’s Ambassador to Yemen in \nSana’a.  U.S. Statement of Interest [Dkt. 19], Ex. 1 [Dkt. 19-1] (Clapper Decl.) ¶ 13. \n6 \n \n\nIn  November  2009,  while  in  Yemen,  Abdulmutallab  swore \nallegiance to the emir of AQAP and shortly thereafter received \ninstructions from ANWAR AL-AULAQI to detonate an explosive \ndevice aboard a U.S. airplane over U.S. airspace.  After receiving \nthis  direction  from  ANWAR  AL-AULAQI,  Abdulmutallab \nobtained the explosive device he used in the attempted Christmas \nDay attack.   \n \nANWAR  AL-AULAQI  was  imprisoned  in  Yemen  in  2006  on \ncharges of kidnapping for ransom and being involved in an al-\nQa’ida plot to kidnap a U.S. official, but was released from jail in \nDecember 2007 and subsequently went into hiding in Yemen.   \n75 Fed. Reg. 43,233-01; see also id. at 43,234 (Anwar Al-Aulaqi was also known as Anwar \nNasser Abdulla Al-Awlaki or Al-Awlaqi).  Thus, the determination that Anwar Al-Aulaqi was an \nAQAP leader was based, at least in part, on the training and instruction he provided to Umar \nFarouk Abdulmutallab, the “Christmas Day bomber.” \n    In lieu of trial, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab voluntarily pled guilty to Conspiracy \nto Commit an Act of Terrorism Transcending National Boundaries in violation of 18 U.S.C. \n§ 2332b(a)(1) & (2) as well as other offenses.  See United States v. Abdulmutallab, Crim. No. 10-\nCR-20005-1 (E.D. Mich.), Tr. of Plea Hr’g (Oct. 12, 2011).  He was sentenced to life in prison.  \nSee id., Judgment (Feb. 16, 2012).  On appeal, the Sixth Circuit upheld his plea and sentence.  \nUnited States v. Abdulmutallab, 739 F.3d 891 (6th Cir. 2014). \n    When pleading guilty, Mr. Abdulmutallab stated that he conspired with Anwar \nAl-Aulaqi to carry an explosive device onto the aircraft, thereby attempting to kill those onboard \nand wreck the plane, as an act of jihad against the United States.  Tr. of Plea Hr’g (Oct. 12, 2011) \nat 26.  Mr. Abdulmutallab was debriefed by FBI agents at various times between January and \nApril 2010; he specifically named Anwar Al-Aulaqi as the AQAP leader who approved the \nChristmas Day attack, and he described in detail the nature of Anwar Al-Aulaqi’s participation in \nthe attack.  See United States v. Abdulmutallab, Crim. No. 10-CR-20005-1 (E.D. Mich.), Gov’t \n7 \n \n\nSentencing Mem., Supp. Factual Appx. (Sentencing Mem.) at 12-14.  Mr. Abdulmutallab had \nbeen a follower of the online teachings of Anwar Al-Aulaqi, and he travelled from his home in \nDubai to Yemen to meet with Anwar Al-Aulaqi.  Id. at 12; see Abdulmutallab, 739 F.3d at 902 \n(“Abdulmutallab studied the teachings of the radical Imam Anwar Awlaki, which prompted his \ndecision to travel to Yemen for the purpose of meeting Awlaki.”).  During a three-day stay at \nAnwar Al-Aulaqi’s house, Mr. Abdulmutallab discussed martyrdom and jihad with Anwar Al-\nAulaqi.  Sentencing Mem. at 13.  At the end of the meeting, Anwar Al-Aulaqi “accepted” Mr. \nAbdulmutallab for a “martyrdom mission.”  Id.  Subsequently, AQAP bomb maker Ibrahim Al \nAsiri discussed a plan for Mr. Abdulmutallab’s martyrdom mission with Anwar Al-Aulaqi, and \nAnwar Al-Aulaqi gave his final approval.  Id.  Over the next few weeks, Mr. Al Asiri \nconstructed a bomb for the suicide mission and trained Mr. Abdulmutallab in its use.  Id. at 13-\n14.  Anwar Al-Aulaqi also assisted Mr. Abdulmutallab in writing a martyrdom statement and \nmaking a martyrdom video.  Id. at 14.  Anwar Al-Aulaqi’s final instructions to Mr. \nAbdulmutallab were to attack a U.S. airliner over U.S. soil.  Id.  The bomb constructed by Mr. Al \nAsiri was the bomb that Mr. Abdulmutallab carried in his underwear on board a Northwest \nAirlines flight on December 25, 2009, and was the bomb that he unsuccessfully attempted to \ndetonate when the plane, carrying 289 passengers, was close to landing in Detroit, Michigan.9  \nId. at 14; see Abdulmutallab, 739 F.3d at 895. \n    Media sources reported ties between Anwar Al-Aulaqi and Nidal Malik Hasan, \nthe U.S. Army Major recently convicted of murdering thirteen people in November 2009 at Fort \n                                                 \n9 Mr. Abdulmutallab is known nationally as the “underwear bomber.”  Abdulmutallab, 739 F.3d \nat 895. \n \n8 \n \n\nHood, Texas.10  See Al-Aulaqi v. Obama, 727 F. Supp. 2d at 10.  Anwar Al-Aulaqi and Major \nHasan exchanged eighteen emails prior to the Fort Hood shootings.  Id.  In a May 2010 video \ninterview of Anwar Al-Aulaqi,11 he called for “jihad against America,” praised the actions of his \n“students” (naming Mr. Abdulmutallab and Major Hasan), and asked others to follow.  Id.; see \nalso Clapper Decl. ¶ 16.12  In the same May 2010 interview, Anwar Al-Aulaqi declared that he \n“will never surrender” to the United States.  Al-Aulaqi v. Obama, 727 F. Supp. 2d at 11; Clapper \nDecl. ¶ 16.  In July 2010, Anwar Al-Aulaqi wrote an article for the AQAP publication Inspire in \nwhich he asserted that because Western “government, political parties, the police, [and] the \nintelligence services . . . are part of a system within which the defamation of Islam is . . . \npromoted . . . [,] the attacking of any Western target [is] legal from an Islamic viewpoint.”  Al-\nAulaqi v. Obama, 727 F. Supp. 2d at 21.  He elaborated on his theme and urged that a U.S. \ncivilian who drew a cartoon depiction of Mohammed should be “a prime target of assassination” \n                                                 \n10 On August 13, 2013, in a court martial proceeding, a jury convicted Major Hasan and \nsentenced him to death.  Billy Kenber, Nidal Hasan Sentenced to Death for Fort Hood Shooting \nRampage, Wash. Post, Aug. 28, 2013. \n11 Al-Malahem Media Production, the official media arm of AQAP, posted the video interview \nonline.  Clapper Decl. ¶ 16; see Partial English Transcript of Interview of Anwar al-Awlaki (May \n26, 2010), http://publicintelligence.net/anwar-al-awlaki-may-2010-interview-video/ (last visited \nApr. 4, 2014); May 2010 Video Interview of Anwar Al-Awlaki With English Subtitles, \nhttp://www.muslimvideo.com/tv/watch/2fdd60665099993430d6/(May-2010)-Interview-With-\nAnwar-Al-Awlaki(Arabic/Eng.Subs) (last visited Apr. 4, 2014). \n12 While the United States is not a party to this case, it filed a Statement of Interest, explaining \nthat the allegations set forth in the Complaint include allegations regarding information covered \nby the state secrets privilege, and reserving the right to raise the privilege if the Court denies \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss.  See U.S. Statement of Interest ¶¶ 9-10.  The Statement of \nInterest was filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 517, which provides that “[t]he Solicitor General, or \nany officer of the Department of Justice, may be sent by the Attorney General to any State or \ndistrict in the United States to attend to the interests of the United States in a suit pending in a \ncourt of the United States, or in a court of a State, or to attend to any other interest of the United \nStates.”  The United States filed an unclassified version of the Clapper Declaration, but did not \nsubmit the classified version to this Court. \n9 \n \n\nand that “[a]ssassinations, bombings, and acts of arson” are “legitimate forms of revenge against \na system that relishes the sacrilege of Islam in the name of freedom.”  Id. \n    After Anwar Al-Aulaqi was killed, Attorney General Holder wrote to Senator \nPatrick Leahy that “[i]t was al-Aulaqi’s actions––and, in particular, his direct personal \ninvolvement in the continued planning and execution of terrorist attacks against the U.S. \nhomeland––that . . . led the United States to take action.”  AG Letter at 3.  The Attorney General \ndescribed Anwar Al-Aulaqi’s involvement in the Christmas Day attack, and asserted the position \nof the Executive Branch that Anwar Al-Aulaqi was a continuing and imminent threat to the \nUnited States when he was killed and that it had not been feasible to capture him:   \nMoreover, information that remains classified to protect sensitive \nsources  and  methods  evidences  al-Aulaqi’s  involvement  in  the \nplanning  of  numerous  other  plots  against  U.S.  and  Western \ninterests and makes clear he was continuing to plot attacks when \nhe was killed.   \n \nBased  on  this  information,  high  level  officials  appropriately \nconcluded that al-Aulaqi posed a continuing and imminent threat \nof violent attack against the United States.  Before carrying out the \noperation that killed al-Aulaqi, senior officials also determined, \nbased on a careful evaluation of the circumstances at the time, that \nit was not feasible to capture him. \nId. (emphasis in original);13 see also President Obama Speech at 10 (stating that Anwar Al-\nAulaqi “was continuously trying to kill people” and that he “helped oversee the 2010 plot to \n                                                 \n13 Attorney General Holder further explained the Executive Branch’s position regarding the \ncircumstances under which lethal force may be used: \n \nBased  on  generations-old  legal  principles  and  Supreme  Court \ndecisions handed down during World War II, as well as during the \ncurrent conflict, it is clear and logical that United States citizenship \nalone does not make such individuals immune from being targeted.  \nRather, it means that the government must take special care and \ntake  into  account  all  relevant  constitutional  considerations,  the \nlaws of war, and other law with respect to U.S. citizens––even \nthose  who  are  leading  efforts  to  kill  their  fellow,  innocent \n10 \n \n\ndetonate explosive devices on two U.S.-bound cargo planes.”).14  Attorney General Holder \nassured Senator Leahy that the decision to target Anwar Al-Aulaqi with lethal force was \n“subjected to an exceptionally rigorous interagency legal review” and an “extensive policy \nreview.”  AG Letter at 3-4.  Attorney General Holder also stated that the Executive Branch \ninformed Congress of the planned drone assault in advance:  “Indeed, the Administration \ninformed the relevant congressional oversight committees that it had approved the use of lethal \nforce against al-Aulaqi in February 2010––well over a year before the operation in question––\nand the legal justification was subsequently explained in detail to those committees, well before \naction was taken against [al]-Aulaqi.”  Id. at 4.15 \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nAmericans.  Such considerations allow for the use of lethal force in \na foreign country against a U.S. citizen who is a senior operational \nleader of al-Qa’ida or its associated forces, and who is actively \nengaged  in  planning  to  kill  Americans,  in  the  following \ncircumstances: (1) the U.S. government has determined, after a \nthorough and careful review, that the individual poses an imminent \nthreat of violent attack against the United States; (2) capture is not \nfeasible; and (3) the operation would be conducted in a manner \nconsistent with applicable law of war principles. \nAG Letter at 3 (emphasis in original). \n14 The President did not elaborate further regarding the 2010 plot to attack two U.S.-bound cargo \nplanes. \n15 See also Diane Feinstein, Feinstein Statement on Intelligence Committee Oversight of \nTargeted Killings, Feb. 13, 2013, http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-\nreleases?ID=5b8dbe0c-07b6-4714-b663-b01c7c9b99b8 (last visited Apr. 4, 2014) (Senate \nIntelligence Committee has held thirty-five oversight meetings for the purpose of reviewing \nstrike records and questioning “every aspect of the [drone] program”; the Committee receives \n“notifications with key details of each strike shortly after it occurs . . . .”). \n11 \n \n\n  C.  The Immediate Lawsuit \n    In this suit, Nasser Al-Aulaqi sues as the personal representative of his son and \ngrandson’s estates, and Sarah Khan sues as the personal representative of her son’s estate.16  \nNasser Al-Aulaqi is a Yemeni citizen who moved to the United States in 1966 to study as a \nFulbright scholar at New Mexico State University.  Compl. ¶ 21.  He and his wife, who is an \nAmerican citizen, remained in the United States until their return to Yemen in 1978.  While \nliving in Yemen, Nasser Al-Aulaqi has served as Yemen’s Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, \npresident of Sana’a University, and president of Ibb University. \n    Nasser Al-Aulaqi’s son, Anwar Al-Aulaqi, was born in 1971 in New Mexico.  Id. \n¶ 22.  He moved to Yemen with his parents in 1978, but later returned to the United States to \nattend college at Colorado State University.  He obtained a Master’s Degree from San Diego \nState University and enrolled in a Ph.D. program at George Washington University, which he \nattended through December 2001.  Anwar Al-Aulaqi married in the United States and had three \nchildren while he was living here, including Abdulrahman, who was born in Denver, Colorado, \non August 26, 1995.  Anwar Al-Aulaqi and his family left the United States in 2002 or 2003 and \neventually moved to Yemen.17 \n    At the time of his death, Anwar Al-Aulaqi was a dual U.S.–Yemeni citizen, living \nin Yemen.  Clapper Decl. ¶ 13; see Al-Aulaqi v. Obama, 727 F. Supp. 2d at 10.  When he died, \n                                                 \n16 On March 21, 2012, Nasser Al-Aulaqi filed in the Probate Division of D.C. Superior Court a \nnotice of appointment as personal representative of the Estates of Anwar and Abdulrahman Al-\nAulaqi.  On May 17, 2012, Sarah Khan filed in the same court notice of appointment as personal \nrepresentative of the Estate of Samir Khan.  See Notice of Probate Appointments [Dkt. 30].  \n  \n17 Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi “moved with his family to Yemen” in 2002, see Compl. ¶ 36, while \nAnwar Al-Aulaqi “left the United States in 2003,” see id. ¶ 22. \n12 \n \n\nAbdulrahman Al-Aulaqi was a 16-year-old high school student residing with his family in \nSana’a, Yemen.  Compl. ¶ 36. \n    Samir Khan also was a U.S. citizen at the time of his death.  Id. ¶ 28.  His mother, \nSarah Khan, has lived in the United States since 1992 with her husband and children; she is an \nAmerican citizen.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 28.  Samir Khan was born in 1985 in an unidentified country and \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1998.  Id. ¶ 28.  In 2003, he graduated from high school in Long Island, \nNew York, after which he moved to North Carolina, where he attended a community college and \nworked.  Samir Khan left the United States for Yemen in 2009.  Id. \n    Defendants are former Secretary of Defense Panetta; former JSOC Commander \nAdmiral McRaven; JSOC Commander Lieutenant General Joseph Votel;18 and former CIA \nDirector General David H. Petraeus.19  Defendants allegedly personally authorized and directed \nthe strikes that killed Anwar Al-Aulaqi, Samir Khan, and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi.  Id. ¶¶ 12-15, \n35.  Plaintiffs allege that the targeted killings took place in Yemen, which was “outside the \ncontext of armed conflict” and that “[t]hese killings rel[ied] on vague legal standards, a closed \nexecutive process, and evidence never presented to the courts.”  Id. ¶ 1. \n    Plaintiffs seek to hold Defendants individually liable for monetary damages for \nviolating the rights of the deceased under the U.S. Constitution.  Id., Prayer for Relief.  They \nallege that Defendants violated (1) the Fifth Amendments right of the deceased to substantive \nand procedural due process; (2) the Fourth Amendment right of the deceased to be free from \nunreasonable seizures; and (3) the right of Anwar Al-Aulaqi under the Constitution’s Bill of \nAttainder Clause.  Id. ¶¶ 41-43.  Defendants have moved to dismiss, arguing that (1) the Court \n                                                 \n18 Lt. Gen. Votel succeeded Adm. McRaven as JSOC Commander. \n19 Gen. Petraeus served as CIA Director from September 6, 2011 until November 9, 2012. \n13 \n \n\nlacks jurisdiction because the Complaint raises a non-justiciable political question; (2) “special \nfactors” preclude implying a cause of action under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of \nFederal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 389 (1971); and (3) Defendants are entitled to \nqualified immunity.  See Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. 18]; Reply [Dkt. 23].  Plaintiffs oppose.  See \nOpp’n [Dkt. 21].  As explained below, the motion to dismiss will be granted because special \nfactors counsel hesitation in implying a Bivens remedy in these circumstances. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nA.  Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(1) \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), a defendant may move to \ndismiss a complaint, or any portion thereof, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 12(b)(1).  No action of the parties can confer subject matter jurisdiction on a federal court \nbecause subject matter jurisdiction is both a statutory requirement and an Article III requirement.  \nAkinseye v. District of Columbia, 339 F.3d 970, 971 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  The party claiming \nsubject matter jurisdiction bears the burden of demonstrating that such jurisdiction exists.  Khadr \nv. United States, 529 F.3d 1112, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 2008); see Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. \nof Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (noting that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and \n“[i]t is to be presumed that a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction, and the burden of \nestablishing the contrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction”) (internal citations omitted). \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), \na court must review the complaint liberally, granting the plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that \ncan be derived from the facts alleged.  Barr v. Clinton, 370 F.3d 1196, 1199 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  \nNevertheless, “the court need not accept factual inferences drawn by plaintiffs if those inferences \nare not supported by facts alleged in the complaint, nor must the Court accept plaintiff=s legal \n14 \n \n\nconclusions.”  Speelman v. United States, 461 F. Supp. 2d 71, 73 (D.D.C. 2006).  A court may \nconsider materials outside the pleadings to determine its jurisdiction.  Settles v. U.S. Parole \nComm’n, 429 F.3d 1098, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2005); Coal. for Underground Expansion v. Mineta, \n333 F.3d 193, 198 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  A court has “broad discretion to consider relevant and \ncompetent evidence” to resolve factual issues raised by a Rule 12(b)(1) motion.  Finca Santa \nElena, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 873 F. Supp. 2d 363, 368 (D.D.C. 2012) (citing 5B \nCharles Wright & Arthur Miller, Fed. Prac. & Pro., Civil § 1350 (3d ed. 2004)); see also \nMacharia v. United States, 238 F. Supp. 2d 13, 20 (D.D.C. 2002), aff’d, 334 F.3d 61 (2003) (in \nreviewing a factual challenge to the truthfulness of the allegations in a complaint, a court may \nexamine testimony and affidavits).  In these circumstances, consideration of documents outside \nthe pleadings does not convert the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.  Al-Owhali \nv. Ashcroft, 279 F. Supp. 2d 13, 21 (D.D.C. 2003). \nB.  Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6) \n  A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6) challenges the adequacy of a complaint on its face.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  \nA complaint must be sufficient “to give a defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the \ngrounds upon which it rests.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (internal \ncitations omitted).  Although a complaint does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff’s \nobligation to provide the grounds for his entitlement to relief  “requires more than labels and \nconclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Id.  To \nsurvive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, \nto state a claim for relief that is “plausible on its face.”  Id. at 570.  A court must treat the \ncomplaint’s factual allegations as true, “even if doubtful in fact.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  \n15 \n \n\nBut a court need not accept as true legal conclusions set forth in a complaint.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009). \n“Unlike motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule \n12(b)(1), factual challenges are not permitted under 12(b)(6) and the Court may only consider \nthe facts alleged in the complaint, any documents attached as exhibits thereto, and matters \nsubject to judicial notice in weighing the merits of the motion.”  Kursar v. Transp. Sec. Admin., \n581 F. Supp. 2d 7, 14 (D.D.C. 2008), aff’d, 442 F. App’x 565 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  When a \ndocument is referred to in a complaint and is central to a plaintiff’s claim, the court may consider \nthe document without converting the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.  \nVanover v. Hantman, 77 F. Supp. 2d 91, 98 (D.D.C. 1999). \nC.  Judicial Notice \nFederal Rule of Evidence 201 provides that a court may judicially notice a fact \nthat is not subject to “reasonable dispute because it (1) is generally known within the trial court’s \nterritorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose \naccuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Fed. R. Evid. 201(b).  A court may take judicial \nnotice of facts contained in public records of other proceedings, see Covad Communications Co. \nv. Bell Atlantic Co., 407 F.3d 1220, 1222 (D.C. Cir. 2005), and of historical, political, or \nstatistical facts, and any other facts that are verifiable with certainty, see Mintz v. FDIC, 729 F. \nSupp. 2d 276, 278 n.5 (D.D.C. 2010).  Also, a court generally may take judicial notice of \nmaterials published in the Federal Register.  Banner Health v. Sebelius, 797 F. Supp. 2d 97, 112 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011); 44 U.S.C. § 1507 (“The contents of the Federal Register shall be judicially \nnoticed . . . .”).  Further, judicial notice may be taken of public records and government \ndocuments available from reliable sources.  Hamilton v. Paulson, 542 F. Supp. 2d 37, 52 n.15 \n16 \n \n\n(D.D.C. 2008), rev’d on other grounds, 666 F.3d 1344 (D.C. Cir. 2012); see D.C. Fed’n of Civic \nAss’ns v. Volpe, 459 F.2d 1231, 1257-58 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (noting that congressional documents \nand speeches made on the floor of the House of Representatives are part of the public record); \nWash. Legal Found. v. U.S. Sentencing Comm’n, 89 F.3d 897, 905 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (common \nlaw right of access to “public records” includes access to government documents “created and \nkept for the purpose of memorializing or recording an official action, decision, statement, or \nother matter of legal significance, broadly conceived”).  In addition, a court may take judicial \nnotice of a formal position of the U.S. Government.  See Simpson v. Socialist People’s Libyan \nArab Jamahiriya, 362 F. Supp. 2d 168, 178 n.5 (D.D.C. 2005) (taking judicial notice of State \nDepartment’s annual publication, Patterns of Global Terrorism, as a reflection of the formal and \nofficial position of U.S. Government), aff’d, 470 F.3d 356, 362 (D.C. Cir. 2006). \nBecause the Court may take judicial notice of facts contained in the public records \nof other proceedings, see Covad, 407 F.3d at 1222, the Court takes judicial notice of the facts \nregarding Anwar Al-Aulaqi’s involvement in the Christmas Day attack.  See Sentencing Mem. at \n12-14; Tr. of Plea Hr’g (Oct. 12, 2011) at 26.  The Court also takes judicial notice of the fact that \nin a May 2010 video interview, Anwar Al-Aulaqi called for “jihad against America” and \ndeclared that he would “never surrender.”  Al-Aulaqi v. Obama, 727 F. Supp. 2d at 10-11; \nClapper Decl. ¶ 16.  Judicial notice is taken, too, of the Treasury publication in the Federal \nRegister, i.e., the designation of Anwar Al-Aulaqi as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist due \nto the fact that he was a key leader of AQAP.  See 75 Fed. Reg. 43,233-01. \nPlaintiffs urge the Court to refrain from taking judicial notice of “Executive \nBranch assertions that are subject to reasonable dispute.”  See Opp’n at 6-7; Pl. Reply to Court’s \nOrder [Dkt. 28] at 2-4.  These assertions include: (1) that the United States is engaged in armed \n17 \n \n\nconflict with AQAP and that AQAP is part of or associated with al-Qa’ida, see Opp’n at 6 n.5; \n(2) that Anwar Al-Aulaqi posed a continuing, imminent threat to the United States; (3) that it \nwas not feasible to capture him; and (4) that the decision to target him with lethal force \nunderwent rigorous interagency legal and policy review and had the prior approval of \ncongressional oversight committees.  See AG Letter at 3-4.  Defendants concede the point by \nstating that “[a]ny additional specific facts included in the AG Letter . . . that either are not \nalleged in the complaint or might be contrary to Plaintiffs’ well-pled allegations would not \ntechnically be before the Court . . . .”  Def. Resp. to Court Order [Dkt. 26] at 2 n.3.  For the \npurpose of considering Defendants’ motion, the Court will take judicial notice of the Treasury \ndesignation, AG Holder’s letter, President Obama’s speech, and Director Leiter’s statement only \nas representations of the Government’s position that Anwar Al-Aulaqi was a terrorist leader of \nAQAP, that AQAP is associated with al-Qa’ida, and that Anwar Al-Aulaqi posed a continuing \nthreat to the United States.  See Simpson, 362 F. Supp. 2d at 178 n.5. \nIII.  ANALYSIS \n    This case presents fundamental questions regarding the nature of a citizen’s right \nto due process under the Fifth Amendment: it is poised at the intersection of the federal \nGovernment’s separation of powers into three co-equal Branches.   \n  A.  Political Question Doctrine \nDefendants move to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to the political \nquestion doctrine, urging the Court to find that there is no judicial role here.  “The political \nquestion doctrine excludes from judicial review those controversies which revolve around policy \nchoices and value determinations constitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of \nCongress or the confines of the Executive Branch.”  Japan Whaling Ass’n v. Am. Cetacean \n18 \n \n\nSoc’y, 478 U.S. 221, 230 (1986).  The doctrine is “primarily a function of the separation of \npowers.”  Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 210 (1962). \nHowever, “[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to \nsay what the law is,” Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803), and the political \nquestion doctrine’s “shifting contours and uncertain underpinnings” make it “susceptible to \nindiscriminate and overbroad application to claims properly before the federal courts,” Ramirez \nde Arellano v. Weinberger, 745 F.2d 1500, 1514 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (en banc), vacated on other \ngrounds, 471 U.S. 1113 (1985).  “The political question doctrine has occupied a more limited \nplace in the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence than is sometimes assumed.  The Court has relied on \nthe doctrine only twice in the last 50 years.”  El-Shifa Pharm. Indus. Co. v. United States, 607 \nF.3d 836, 856 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (en banc) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in judgment). \n“[T]he Supreme Court has repeatedly found that claims based on [due process] \nrights are justiciable, even if they implicate foreign policy decisions.”  Comm. of U.S. Citizens \nLiving in Nicaragua v. Reagan, 859 F.2d 929, 935 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (citing Regan v. Wald, 468 \nU.S. 222 (1984); Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654 (1981)).  In U.S. Citizens v. Reagan, a \ngroup of U.S. citizens living in Nicaragua advanced Fifth Amendment claims challenging U.S. \nsupport of military actions by the so-called “Contras.”  They argued that funding the Contras \ndeprived them of liberty and property without due process of law because they were threatened \nby the war in Nicaragua and they were intended targets of the Contras.  859 F.2d at 935.  The \nD.C. Circuit determined that these due process claims were “serious allegations and not ones to \nbe dismissed as nonjusticiable” because “[t]he Executive’s power to conduct foreign relations \nfree from the unwarranted supervision of the Judiciary cannot give the Executive carte blanche \n19 \n \n\nto trample the most fundamental liberty and property rights of this country’s citizenry.”  Id. \n(quoting Ramirez de Arellano, 745 F.2d at 1515).20 \nThe same reasoning applies here.  The powers granted to the Executive and \nCongress to wage war and provide for national security does not give them carte blanche to \ndeprive a U.S. citizen of his life without due process and without any judicial review.  See U.S. \nCitizens v. Reagan, 859 F.2d at 935.  The interest in avoiding the erroneous deprivation of one’s \nlife is uniquely compelling.  See Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 78 (1985) (“The private interest \nin the accuracy of a criminal proceedings that places an individual’s life or liberty at risk is \nalmost uniquely compelling.”); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604 (1978) (“[T]his qualitative \ndifference between death and other penalties calls for a greater degree of reliability when the \ndeath sentence is imposed.”).  The Bill of Rights was passed to protect individuals from an over-\nreaching government, and this Court cannot refuse to provide an independent legal analysis. \nThis conclusion is not changed because Defendants argue that El-Shifa \nPharmaceutical Industries v. United States makes this case non-justiciable.  The El-Shifa \nplaintiffs were owners of a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant who sued the United States for \ndestroying their plant with a missile strike.  U.S. officials asserted that the plant was producing \nchemical weapons for Osama bin Laden.  607 F.3d at 838-39.  The plaintiffs sought \ncompensation for the plant’s destruction and the retraction of allegedly defamatory statements.  \nId. at 839.  The Circuit dismissed the case based on the political question doctrine.  Id. at 840-44.  \nEl-Shifa is distinguishable from this case in key respects––the El-Shifa plaintiffs were not U.S. \ncitizens and there was no allegation that they had a substantial connection to the United States \n                                                 \n20  U.S. Citizens v. Reagan found the plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claims justiciable, but \nultimately declined to hear their claims because they did not allege that the United States \nparticipated in or encouraged injuries to Americans in Nicaragua.  859 F.2d at 934-35. \n20 \n \n\nthat might have given rise to cognizable Fifth Amendment rights.  See United States v. Verdugo-\nUrquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 265-66 (1990) (a non-U.S. resident foreign national is entitled to certain \nconstitutional protections if the foreign national had a “substantial connection” to the United \nStates); 32 Cnty. Sovereignty Comm. v. Dep’t of State, 292 F.3d 797, 799 (D.C. Cir. 2002) \n(foreign plaintiff was not entitled to due process regarding State Department’s designation of it \nas a foreign terrorist organization because plaintiff did not have a controlling interest in property \nin the United States and did not show any other substantial connection).  Foreign aliens suing for \ndeprivation of a foreign property interest are not comparable to U.S. citizens suing for \ndeprivation of their lives.  Because Plaintiffs here pointedly allege that Defendants, U.S. \nofficials, intentionally targeted and killed U.S. citizens abroad without due process, the Court \nfinds that this case is justiciable and that it has subject matter jurisdiction.21 \nB.  Constitutional Claims Pursuant to Bivens \n    In analyzing a Bivens claim, a Court must first “identify the exact contours of the \nunderlying right said to have been violated” and determine “whether the plaintiff has alleged a \ndeprivation of a constitutional right at all.”  Cnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 841 n.5 \n(1998).  Plaintiffs contend that Defendants violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.  The \nFourth Amendment reads: \n                                                 \n21 The Court recognizes that its holding regarding the political question doctrine is inconsistent \nwith Judge Bates’s decision in Al-Aulaqi v. Obama.  That earlier case alleged that the United \nStates’ intention to kill Anwar Al-Aulaqi violated the Fifth Amendment.  In contrast, the instant \nComplaint raises the issue more directly and acutely, asserting a claim for damages for the actual \ntaking of Anwar Al-Aulaqi’s life without regard to Fifth Amendment protections.  Al-Aulaqi v. \nObama considered the issues of separation of powers, competence of the Judicial Branch to \nreview military decisions, whether there were judicially discoverable and manageable standards \nfor reviewing the nature of the security threat, and whether the use of lethal force was justified.  \nSee Al-Aulaqi v. Obama, 727 F. Supp. 2d 1, 44-53.  The question here is whether one or more of \nthe same issues prevents Plaintiffs from seeking a Bivens remedy against individual U.S. \nofficials. \n21 \n \n\nThe  right  of  the  people  to  be  secure  in  their  persons,  houses, \npapers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, \nshall  not  be  violated,  and  no  Warrants  shall  issue,  but  upon \nprobable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly \ndescribing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be \nseized. \nU.S. Const. amend. IV.  The Fifth Amendment provides: \nNo  person  shall  be  held  to  answer  for  a  capital,  or  otherwise \ninfamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand \nJury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the \nMilitia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; . . . \nnor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of \nlaw . . . . \nU.S. Const. amend. V.  United States citizens are entitled to constitutional protections even when \nabroad.  Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 5-9 (1957) (plurality opinion).  The fact that Anwar Al-\nAulaqi, Samir Khan and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi were in Yemen at the time they were killed did \nnot alter these basic legal rights under the U.S. Constituion. \n    1.  Fourth Amendment \n    Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the decedents’ Fourth Amendment right \nto be free from unreasonable seizure “by authorizing and directing their subordinates to use \nlethal force” against them.  Compl. ¶ 42.  In Fourth Amendment parlance, Plaintiffs assert a \nclaim of excessive force.  In addressing an excessive force claim, “analysis begins by identifying \nthe specific constitutional right allegedly infringed by the challenged application of force.”  \nGraham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394 (1989).  “The validity of the claim must then be judged by \nreference to the specific constitutional standard which governs that right, rather than to some \ngeneralized ‘excessive force’ standard.”  Id.  For example, the plaintiff in Graham claimed that \nan officer used excessive force during an investigatory stop in violation of his right to \nsubstantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Because the case related to a \n“seizure,” which is specifically addressed by the Fourth Amendment, the Supreme Court \n22 \n \n\nanalyzed his claim under the Fourth Amendment and not under the Fourteenth Amendment as \nalleged.22  Id. at 395.  Thus, “Graham . . . requires that if a constitutional claim is covered by a \nspecific constitutional provision . . . the claim must be analyzed under the standard appropriate to \nthat specific provision, not under the rubric of substantive due process.”  United States v. Lanier, \n520 U.S. 259, 272 n.7 (1997). \nIn this case, the opposite is true––the Court must analyze Plaintiffs’ claims under \nthe rubric of the Fifth Amendment and not the Fourth Amendment.  While Plaintiffs assert that \nDefendants violated the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure, in fact \nthere was no “seizure” of Anwar Al-Aulaqi, Samir Khan or Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi as that term \nis defined in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  “Only when [an] officer, by means of physical \nforce or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude \nthat a ‘seizure’ has occurred.”  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19 n.16 (1968).  The Supreme Court \nhas further clarified that a “seizure” occurs when an officer brings a person “within the officer’s \ncontrol,” either by application of force, even if slight, or by the person’s submission to a law \nenforcement officer’s show of authority.  California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 624-626 (1991); \naccord United States v. Jordan, 951 F.2d 1278, 1281 (D.C. Cir. 1991). \n    Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants “seized” the decedents.  They do not \nallege that Defendants restrained decedents’ liberty or that Defendants took the decedents into \ntheir control through an application of force or show of authority.  Plaintiffs impliedly concede \nthis point when they complain that Defendants should have captured (i.e., seized) Anwar Al-\n                                                 \n22 The Graham plaintiff asserted his constitutional rights by asserting a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, which applies to State, not Federal, actors.  Courts interpret § 1983 and Bivens claims in \na parallel manner.  Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 82 (2001).  The application of \ndifferent standards for claims against State and Federal actors would be “incongruous and \nconfusing.”  Id. (quoting Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 468, 499 (1978)). \n23 \n \n\nAulaqi instead of killing him.  In fact, Plaintiffs do not even allege that Defendants intended to \nseize Mr. Khan and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi, since Mr. Khan and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi were \nkilled by unmanned U.S. drones that targeted another person.  Plaintiffs further admit the \ninapplicability of Fourth Amendment principles by asserting that the United States killed the \nthree men with missiles from unmanned drones.  Unmanned drones are functionally incapable of \n“seizing” a person; they are designed to kill, not capture.  As the decedents were not “seized,” \nPlaintiffs have not stated a Fourth Amendment claim. \n2.  Procedural and Substantive Due Process    \nThe due process clause of the Fifth Amendment was intended to secure the \nindividual from arbitrary exercises of governmental power.  Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, \n330 (1986).  It encompasses both substantive and procedural components.  Zinermon v. Burch, \n494 U.S. 113, 125 (1990).  To state a procedural due process claim, a plaintiff must establish that \nhe had a protected interest in life, liberty or property, see Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 \nU.S. 748, 756 (2005), and that government officials knowingly, and not merely negligently, \ndeprived him of that interest, see Daniels, 474 U.S. at 335-36, without notice and an opportunity \nto be heard “at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner,” see Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 \nU.S. 319, 333 (1976).23 \n                                                 \n23 “[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation \ndemands.”  Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972).  To determine what procedural \nprocess is due, courts balance the following factors: (1) the private interest that will be affected \nby the restraint; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures \nused; (3) the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (4) the \nGovernment’s interest, including the burden of a hearing.  Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335.  “[T]he \nnecessity of quick action by the State or the impracticality of providing any predeprivation \nprocess may mean that a postdeprivation remedy is constitutionally adequate.”  Zinermon, 494 \nU.S. at 128 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n24 \n \n\nTo state a substantive due process claim, a plaintiff must assert that a government \nofficial was so “deliberately indifferent” to his constitutional rights that the official’s conduct \n“shocks the conscience.”  Estate of Phillips v. Dist. of Columbia, 455 F.3d 397, 403 (D.C. Cir. \n2006); see also Cnty. of Sacramento, 523 U.S. at 847 n.8 (government conduct must have been \n“so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience”).  \nConduct “shocks the conscience” when it was “intended to injure in some way.”  Cnty. of \nSacramento, 523 U.S. at 849; see also Silverman v. Barry, 845 F.2d 1072, 1080 (D.C. Cir. 1988) \n(government conduct that was “gravely unfair,” such as “a deliberate flouting of the law that \ntrammels significant personal or property rights,” gives rise to a substantive due process claim).  \nConduct that “shocks in one environment may not be so patently egregious in another,” and the \n“concern with preserving the constitutional proportions of substantive due process demands an \nexact analysis of circumstances before any abuse of power is condemned as conscience \nshocking.” 24  Cnty. of Sacramento, 523 U.S. at 850–51.  No court has ever examined the precise \nnature of the substantive due process rights of an enemy, who also is a U.S. citizen, killed by a \ndrone.  Cf. O.K. v. Bush, 377 F. Supp. 2d 102, 112 n.10 (D.D.C. 2005) (“No federal court has \never examined the nature of the substantive due process rights of a prisoner in a military \ninterrogation or prisoner of war context.”). \n                                                 \n24 Context is important.  If a soldier in foreign uniform is killed by the U.S. military on a \nbattlefield, his death does not raise substantive due process concerns, even if the soldier was a \nU.S. citizen, since such a killing would not constitute government conduct that was so egregious \nor outrageous that it may be said to “shock the conscience.”  See Cnty. of Sacramento, 523 U.S. \nat 847 n.8.  Use of military force against those individuals––even U.S. citizens––who fight \nagainst U.S. troops is permissible under the Constitution.  See Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, \n518 (2004) (plurality) (detention of U.S. citizen who was classified as “enemy combatant” did \nnot violate due process); id. at 587, 597 (Thomas, J., dissenting); Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1, \n37-38 (1942) (“Citizens who associate themselves with the military arm of the enemy \ngovernment, and with its aid, guidance and direction enter this country bent on hostile acts, are \nenemy belligerents within the meaning of the Hague Convention and the law of war.”). \n25 \n \n\n    Plaintiffs have not stated a Fifth Amendment due process claim on behalf of Mr. \nKhan or Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi.  Mr. Khan and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi were not targeted and \ntheir deaths were unanticipated.  In fact, Plaintiffs’ due process claim on behalf of Mr. Khan and \nAbdulrahman Al-Aulaqi asserts only negligence, i.e., that the Government should have taken \nbetter care to avoid harming them as bystanders.  See Compl. ¶ 5 (“If the Defendants were \ntargeting others, they had an obligation under the Constitution and international human rights \nlaw to take measures to prevent harm to Samir Khan, Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi, and other \nbystanders.”).  Mere negligence does not give rise to a constitutional deprivation.  Daniels, 474 \nU.S.  at 331-32; accord Davidson v. Cannon, 474 U.S. 344, 347-48 (1986) (the due process \nclause, whether procedural or substantive, is not triggered by the lack of due care of an official \ncausing unintended injury to life, liberty, or property).  “[T]he Constitution does not guarantee \ndue care on the part of state officials; liability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically \nbeneath the threshold of constitutional due process.”  Cnty. of Sacramento, 523 U.S. at 849.  \nAccordingly, the Fifth Amendment claims asserted on behalf of Mr. Khan and Abdulrahman Al-\nAulaqi will be dismissed for failure to state a claim. \n    In contrast, with regard to Anwar Al-Aulaqi, Plaintiffs allege both procedural and \nsubstantive due process claims.  They allege a procedural claim by asserting that Anwar Al-\nAulaqi was executed without charge, indictment, or prosecution. 25  See Compl. ¶ 26.  They also \n                                                 \n25 Had he been captured alive, Anwar Al-Aulaqi might have been charged with treason.  The \nU.S. Constitution defines treason as follows: \nTreason against the United States, shall consist only in levying \nWar against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them \nAid and Comfort.  No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless \non the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on \nConfession in Open Court. \nU.S. Const. art. III, § 3. \n26 \n \n\nallege a substantive due process claim by asserting that Defendants killed Anwar Al-Aulaqi with \ndeliberate indifference to his constitutional right to life, both outside of armed conflict and at a \ntime when he did not present a concrete, specific, and imminent threat to the United States.  See \nid. ¶¶ 4, 24, 33-34.  The Court does not opine that Anwar Al-Aulaqi was entitled to notice and a \npredeprivation hearing, or that his Estate was entitled to a postdeprivation hearing, or that the \ndrone killing of Anwar Al-Aulaqi “shocks the conscience.”  The Court merely holds that the \nComplaint states a “plausible” procedural and substantive due process claim on behalf of Anwar \nAl-Aulaqi.  See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. \n    3.  Special Factors Preclude a Bivens Claim \n    The Court concludes that the political question doctrine does not bar its review of \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint and that Plaintiffs have stated a claim that Defendants violated Anwar Al-\nAulaqi’s due process rights.  Nonetheless, the Court finds no available remedy under U.S. law \nfor this claim. \n    Plaintiffs rely on Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 389 (1971), to support their claims against individual federal officials.  \nIndeed, Bivens permits a damages action against a federal officer for a violation of a plaintiff’s \nclearly-established constitutional rights.26  See Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 71 \n(2001) (Bivens “is concerned solely with deterring individual officers’ unconstitutional acts.”)  \nHowever, in the more than forty years since Bivens was decided, the Supreme Court has \nextended its analysis in only two contexts.  See Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980) (permitting \nfederal prisoner to seek Bivens remedy for violation of Eighth Amendment); Davis v. Passman, \n                                                 \n26 A Bivens suit is the federal counterpart of a claim brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against a \nstate or local official for violation of constitutional rights.  Ali v. Rumsfeld, 649 F.3d 762, 768 n.3 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011). \n27 \n \n\n442 U.S. 228 (1979) (permitting former Congressional staffer to seek Bivens remedy for gender \ndiscrimination in violation of Fifth Amendment).  Neither of these contexts applies here.  Since \n1980, the Supreme Court has “consistently refused to extend Bivens liability to any new context \nor new category of defendants.”  Malesko, 534 U.S. at 68. \n    Courts refuse to imply a remedy under Bivens when Congress has provided an \n“alternative remedy” to protect the interest in question, Wilke v. Robbins, 551 U.S. 537, 550 \n(2007), or when “special factors counsel[ ] hesitation” in extending Bivens to a new fact pattern, \nWilson v. Libby, 535 F.3d 697, 704 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quoting Bivens, 403 U.S. at 396).  The \nparties here agree that Plaintiffs have no alternative remedy for their allegations of constitutional \nviolations.  Instead, both sides focus on whether “special factors counsel hesitation” in allowing \na Bivens remedy on these facts.  Id. \n    No case has discussed precisely whether a plaintiff can proceed on a Bivens action \nthat claims deprivation of life without due process based on the overseas killing by United States \nofficials of a U.S. citizen deemed to be an active enemy.  There are, however, analogous cases in \nwhich circuit courts have barred Bivens actions to remedy deprivations of liberty without due \nprocess arising from military detention and alleged abuse of U.S. citizens.  Specifically, the D.C. \nCircuit, as well as the Fourth and Seventh Circuits, have decided that special factors––including \nseparation of powers, national security, and the risk of interfering with military decisions––\npreclude the extension of a Bivens remedy to such cases.  See Doe v. Rumsfeld, 683 F.3d 390 \n(D.C. Cir. 2012); Lebron v. Rumsfeld, 670 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 2751 \n(2012); Vance v. Rumsfeld, 701 F.3d 193 (7th Cir. 2012) (en banc).27 \n                                                 \n27 Similarly, courts have held that special factors preclude the use of Bivens to remedy \ndeprivations of liberty without due process arising from military detention and alleged abuse of \nnon-U.S. citizens.  See Ali v. Rumsfeld, 649 F.3d 762 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (Afghani and Iraqi \n28 \n \n\n    The D.C. Circuit held in Doe v. Rumsfeld that special factors counseled hesitation \nand forestalled a Bivens lawsuit brought by a civilian government contractor who was subjected \nto military detention in Iraq.  Doe, 683 F.3d at 394.  The Doe plaintiff was a U.S. citizen and \nemployee of an American-owned defense contracting firm.  Id. at 392.  He worked as a civilian \nArabic translator in Iraq to develop intelligence through contact with local Iraqis.  When Mr. \nDoe had been in Iraq for almost one year, he was detained and interrogated by agents of the \nNavy Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and then turned over to the custody of the U.S. \nmilitary.  He was detained at a U.S. military facility near Baghdad, where he was harshly \nquestioned for over six months but never formally charged.  Id.  When finally released in the \nUnited States, Mr. Doe was placed on watch lists that interfered with his employment and travel.  \nId.  Mr. Doe claimed that his constitutional rights under the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments were violated and sought a Bivens remedy. \n    The D.C. Circuit concluded that Mr. Doe’s claims could not be remedied under \nBivens because the Supreme Court “has never implied a Bivens remedy in a case involving the \nmilitary, national security, or intelligence.”  Id. at 394.  “[T]he insistence (evident from the \nnumber of Clauses devoted to the subject) with which the Constitution confers authority over the \nArmy, Navy, and militia upon political branches . . . counsels hesitation in our creation of \ndamages remedies in this field.”  Id. (citing United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 668, 682 (1987) \n(finding no Bivens remedy for damages arising out of military service)). \n                                                                                                                                                             \ndetainees captured and held by the U.S. military in their home countries were precluded from \nbringing Bivens claim, as special factors applied); Mirmehdi v. United States, 689 F.3d 975 (9th \nCir. 2011) (Iranians could not proceed under Bivens on claims of illegal detention during \ndeportation proceedings due to special factors such as implications for diplomacy and foreign \npolicy); Arar v. Ashcroft, 585 F.3d 559 (2d Cir. 2009) (en banc) (due to special factors, dual \ncitizen of Canada and Syria was not permitted to proceed on a Bivens claim alleging improper \nand abusive custody in the context of extraordinary rendition). \n29 \n \n\n    The Doe court referenced the numerous clauses of the Constitution that squarely \nplace warmaking and national defense powers in the hands of the Executive and Legislative \nBranches and not in the Judicial Branch.  Article I of the Constitution gives to Congress the \nauthority to “provide for the Common Defense,” “declare War,” “raise and support Armies,” \n“provide and maintain a Navy,” “make Rules for the Government and Regulation for the land \nand naval Forces,” and “provide for calling forth the Militia to . . . repel Invasions.”  U.S. Const. \nart. I, § 8.  Thus, the “Constitution contemplated that the Legislative Branch has plenary control \nover rights, duties, and responsibilities in the framework of the military establishment, including \nregulations, procedures, and remedies.”  Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.S. 296, 301 (1983).  \nAuthority over national defense and the military is shared with the Executive; Article II appoints \nthe President Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.  Id. art. II, § 2.  As a result, the Seventh \nCircuit has held that “civilian courts should not interfere with the military chain of command.”  \nVance, 701 F.3d at 199.  Courts regularly accord great deference to Congress with respect to its \nauthority over national defense and military affairs, see Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 64-65 \n(1981), and to military authorities with respect to decisions concerning the relative importance of  \na particular military interest, see Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  \nAlso, courts “traditionally have been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in \nmilitary and national security affairs.”  Dep’t of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 530 (1988). \n    Doe held that special factors counseled hesitation in implying a Bivens remedy for \nMr. Doe’s claims.  The Circuit found that the Doe complaint would “require a court to delve into \nthe military’s policies regarding the designation of detainees as ‘security internees’ or ‘enemy \ncombatants,’ as well as policies governing interrogation techniques.”  Doe, 683 F.3d at 396.  In \naddition, Mr. Doe’s allegations against Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld implicated the \n30 \n \n\nmilitary chain of command and the discretion given to NCIS agents to detain and question \npotential enemy combatants.  Id.  These issues raised concerns relating to separation of powers; \neven more, the Circuit found that “[l]itigation of Doe’s case would require testimony from top \nmilitary officials as well as forces on the ground, which would detract focus, resources, and \npersonnel from the mission in Iraq.”  Id.  Extending Bivens to allow a remedy against military \nofficials in Iraq would “disrupt and hinder the ability of our armed forces to act decisively and \nwithout hesitation in defense of our liberty and national interests.”  Id. at 395 (quoting Ali, 649 \nF.3d at 773); see Vance, 701 F.3d at 200 (recognizing a Bivens remedy would “come at an \nuncertain cost in national security”). \n    The D.C. Circuit’s Doe opinion relied on the Fourth Circuit’s decision in Lebron, \nwhich had extensively reviewed the factors counseling hesitation in analogous circumstances.  \nDoe, 683 F.3d at 395 (citing Lebron, 670 F.3d at 548-556).  Lebron addressed the constitutional \nclaims of Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen who was subjected to military detention in the United \nStates.  Mr. Padilla had joined al-Qa’ida and traveled to an al-Qa’ida camp in Afghanistan for \ncombat training.  Lebron, 670 F.3d at 544.  He then returned to the United States and was \narrested, declared an enemy combatant, and transferred to the Naval Consolidated Brig at \nCharleston, South Carolina.  Id. at 545.  Mr. Padilla alleged that he was questioned at length, \nrepeatedly abused, threatened with torture, and deprived of basic necessities while in military \ncustody.28  Id.  Mr. Padilla sued various federal officials in their personal capacities, seeking a \nBivens damages remedy for the violation of his Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights.  The Fourth \n                                                 \n28 Eventually, Mr. Padilla was indicted on criminal terrorism charges in the Southern District of \nFlorida.  He was transferred to civilian custody, tried, and convicted.  See United States v. \nJayyousi, 657 F.3d 1085 (11th Cir. 2011) (affirming Padilla’s conviction on terrorism charges \nand reversing his sentence of 208 months incarceration because it was too low). \n31 \n \n\nCircuit refused to imply a Bivens remedy, emphasizing the wisdom behind the Constitution’s \ndelegation of authority and power over the military to the political Branches: \nThe  reasons  for  this  constitutional  structure  are  apparent.  \nQuestions of national security, particularly in times of conflict, do \nnot  admit  of  easy  answers,  especially  not  as  products  of  the \nnecessarily  limited  analysis  undertaken  in  a  single  case.    It  is \ntherefore unsurprising that “our Constitution recognizes that core \nstrategic matters of warmaking belong in the hands of those who \nare best positioned and most politically accountable for making \nthem.” \nId. at 549 (quoting Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 531 (2004) (plurality opinion)); see \nMarbury, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 165-66 (under the U.S. Constitution, “the President is invested \nwith certain important political powers, in the exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, \nand is accountable only to his country in his political character, and to his own conscience.”). \nLebron further noted that whenever the Supreme Court has considered a Bivens \nremedy in a case involving the military, it has concluded that constitutional separation of powers \ncounsels hesitation in creation of a new civil remedy.  Id. at 550 (citing Stanley, 483 U.S. at \n682).  “Padilla’s enemy combatant classification and military detention raise fundamental \nquestions incident to the conduct of armed conflict.”  Id. at 550.  “Padilla’s complaint seeks quite \ncandidly to have the judiciary review and disapprove sensitive military decisions made after \nextensive deliberations within the executive branch as to what the law permitted, what national \nsecurity required, and how best to reconcile competing values.”  Id. at 551.  In refusing to imply \na Bivens claim, Lebron described the broad practical impact any Bivens action by Mr. Padilla \ncould have on military intelligence operations: \nAny defense to Padilla’s claims––which effectively challenge the \nwhole of the government’s detainee policy––could require current \nand former officials, both military and civilian, to testify as to the \nrationale for that policy, the global nature of the terrorist threat it \nwas designed to combat, the specific intelligence that led to the \napplication of that policy to Padilla, where and from whom that \n32 \n \n\nintelligence was obtained, what specific military orders were given \nin the chain of command, and how those orders were carried out.  \n670 F.3d at 553.  The Fourth Circuit concluded that permitting Mr. Padilla’s suit to proceed \nwould impermissibly draw the court into “the heart of executive and military planning and \ndeliberation.”  Id.  at 550.  Lebron reasoned that while it could be debated whether a particular \nnational security policy or military decision was the most effective counterterrorism strategy, the \nproper forum for such debate is not a civil cause of action.  Id. at 552; see also Vance, 701 F.3d \nat 200 (judges lack the knowledge and expertise necessary to make decisions regarding national \nsecurity; Congress and the Commander in Chief ought to make the “essential tradeoffs” \nrequired). \n    The Fourth Circuit stressed that “the need to hesitate before using Bivens” is \nparticularly clear when Congress and the President have exercised their military responsibilities \n“in concert.”  Lebron, 670 F.3d at 549.  The political branches acted in concert in Lebron.  \nCongress enacted the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), Pub. L. No. 107-40, 115 \nStat. 224 (reprinted at 50 U.S.C. § 1541 note), authorizing the Executive to use necessary and \nappropriate military force against al-Qa’ida, the Taliban in Afghanistan, and affiliated forces.  \nThe President detained Mr. Padilla pursuant to the AUMF.  Courts “accord the President the \ndeference that is his when he acts pursuant to a broad delegation of authority from Congress.”  \nLebron, 670 F.3d at 549 (citation omitted). \n     Courts also have barred Bivens remedies due to the potential for interference with \nU.S. foreign policy.  See, e.g., Arar, 585 F.3d at 574.  Like war and national defense, foreign \naffairs are constitutionally committed to the Executive and Congress.  The President “shall have \nthe Power, with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties . . . [and] appoint \nAmbassadors” and to “receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers.”  U.S. Const. art. II. \n33 \n \n\n§§ 2-3.  Congress has the power to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations” and to “define \nand punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of \nNations.”  Id. art. I, § 8.  The Arar plaintiff was a dual citizen of Canada and Syria who \nattempted to obtain a Bivens remedy from federal officials who were allegedly responsible for \ntorture he suffered while held in custody in the United States.  The Second Circuit refused to \nimply a Bivens remedy, in part because the suit would affect diplomacy and foreign policy.  \nArar, 585 F.3d at 574; see also Ali, 649 F.3d at 774 (danger that Bivens suit by foreign citizens \nwould obstruct Government foreign policy is “sufficiently acute” that courts must “leave to \nCongress the judgment whether a damage remedy should exist.”); cf. Arar, 585 F.3d at 576 (the \nprobing of intelligence and classified materials “entails the risk that other countries will become \nless willing to cooperate with the United States in sharing intelligence resources to counter \nterrorism.”). \n    In this delicate area of warmaking, national security, and foreign relations, the \njudiciary has an exceedingly limited role.  This Court is not equipped to question, and does not \nmake a finding concerning, Defendants’ actions in dealing with AQAP generally or Anwar Al-\nAulaqi in particular.  Its role is much more modest:  only to ensure that the circumstances of the \nexercise of war powers against a specifically-targeted U.S. citizen overseas do not call for the \nrecognition of a new area of Bivens relief. \n    Here, Congress and the Executive acted in concert, pursuant to their \nConstitutional authorities to provide for national defense and to regulate the military.  U.S. \nConst. art. I, § 8; id. art. II, § 2.  The need to hesitate before implying a Bivens claim is \nparticularly clear.  See Lebron, 670 F.3d at 549.  Congress enacted the AUMF, authorizing the \nExecutive to use necessary and appropriate military force against al-Qa’ida and affiliated forces.  \n34 \n \n\nIt is the Executive’s position that AQAP is affiliated with al-Qa’ida.29  Further, the AUMF does \nnot contain geographical limits.  See Bensayah v. Obama, 610 F.3d 718, 720-21 (D.C. Cir. 2010) \n(AUMF authorized detention of individual arrested in Bosnia and turned over to U.S. custody so \nlong as individual was part of al-Qa’ida); Al-Adahi v. Obama, 613 F.3d 1102, 1103, 1111 (D.C. \nCir. 2010) (AUMF authorized detention of person arrested in Pakistan and transferred to U.S. \ncustody).30  Thus, the fact that Anwar Al-Aulaqi was targeted in Yemen does not undermine the \nAUMF as the source of authority for the use of force against him. \n    Further, the record is replete with evidence that Anwar Al-Aulaqi was an AQAP \nleader.  He was intimately involved in planning the Christmas Day bombing.  See United States \nv. Abdulmutallab, Crim. No. 10-CR-20005-1 (E.D. Mich.), Sentencing Mem. at 12-14; id., Tr. of \nPlea Hr’g (Oct. 12, 2011); see also 75 Fed. Reg. 43,233-01.  In a May 2010 interview posted \nonline, he called for “jihad against America,” praised the actions of his “students” Christmas Day \nbomber Mr. Abdulmutallab and Fort Hood shooter Maj. Hasan, and asked others to follow.  See \nAl-Aulaqi v. Obama, 727 F. Supp. 2d at 10; Clapper Decl. ¶ 16.  In July 2010, he wrote an article \nfor the AQAP publication Inspire, advocating assassinations, bombings, and other attacks against \nWestern targets.  Al-Aulaqi v. Obama, 727 F. Supp. 2d at 21. \n                                                 \n29 See Director Leiter Statement at 2, 4-5. \n30 The Executive Branch takes the position that AUMF provides legal authority for targeted \nstrikes against enemy forces beyond the battlefields of Afghanistan.  See Robert Chesney, Text of \nDeputy National Security Advisor John Brennan’s Speech at the Wilson Center on Drone Strikes, \nLawfare (Apr. 30, 2012) (found at http://www.lawfareblog.com/2012/04/brennanspeech/ (last \nvisited Apr. 4, 2014).  The Complaint quotes Mr. Brennan’s speech, without citing to it.  See \nCompl. ¶ 18 (“In April 2012, Deputy . . . Brennan acknowledged publically that the United \nStates carries out targeted killings of suspected terrorists ‘beyond hot battlefields like \nAfghanistan,’ often using ‘remotely piloted aircraft’ known as ‘drones.’”).  At the time the \nAUMF was enacted, the Executive Branch commonly asserted that the United States was \ninvolved in a “global war on terror.” \n35 \n \n\nThe fact is that Anwar Al-Aulaqi was an active and exceedingly dangerous enemy \nof the United States, irrespective of his distance, location, and citizenship.  As evidenced by his \nparticipation in the Christmas Day attack, Anwar Al-Aulaqi was able to persuade, direct, and \nwage war against the United States from his location in Yemen, i.e., without being present on an \nofficial battlefield or in a “hot” war zone.  Defendants, top military and intelligence officials, \nacted against Anwar Al-Aulaqi, a notorious AQAP leader, as authorized by the AUMF. \n    Permitting Plaintiffs to pursue a Bivens remedy under the circumstances of this \ncase would impermissibly draw the Court into “the heart of executive and military planning and \ndeliberation,” Lebron, 670 F.3d at 550, as the suit would require the Court to examine national \nsecurity policy and the military chain of command as well as operational combat decisions \nregarding the designation of targets and how best to counter threats to the United States, see Doe, \n683 F.3d at 396.  Anwar Al-Aulaqi’s classification as a key AQAP leader to target by a drone \nstrike raises fundamental questions regarding the conduct of armed conflict.  The Constitution \ncommits decision-making in this area to the President, as Commander in Chief, and to Congress.  \nSee Hamdi, 542 U.S. at 531 (plurality opinion) (“Without doubt, our Constitution recognizes that \ncore strategic matters of warmaking belong in the hands of those who are best positioned and \nmost politically accountable for making them.”).  Further, allowing Plaintiffs to bring a Bivens \naction against Defendants would hinder their ability in the future to act decisively and without \nhesitation in defense of U.S. interests.  See id. at 395; see also Vance, 701 F.3d at 200 (Congress \nand the President, not judges, should make the “essential tradeoffs” required to manage national \nsecurity). \n    Plaintiffs’ Complaint also raises questions regarding foreign policy because \nAnwar Al-Aulaqi was a dual U.S.-Yemeni citizen who was killed in Yemen.  Plaintiffs’ suit \n36 \n \n\nagainst top U.S. officials for their role in ordering a missile strike against a dual citizen in a \nforeign country necessarily implicates foreign policy.  See Arar, 585 F.3d at 574 (Bivens remedy \nshould not be permitted where suit would affect diplomacy and foreign policy).  These special \nfactors counsel hesitation in extending a Bivens remedy here. \n    Although it gave this Court pause, a plaintiff’s U.S. citizenship has not affected \nthe analysis of Bivens special factors by the circuit courts.  See Doe, 683 F.3d at 396 (a plaintiff’s \nU.S. citizenship “does not alleviate” applicable special factors).  The Seventh Circuit expounded: \nThe Supreme Court has never suggested that citizenship matters to \na claim under Bivens.  It would be offensive to our allies, and it \nshould be offensive to our own principles of equal treatment, to \ndeclare that this nation systematically favors U.S. citizens over \nCanadians, British, Iraqis, and our other allies when redressing \ninjuries  caused  by  our  military  and  intelligence  operations.  \nTreaties may pose a further obstacle to favoring U.S. citizens in the \ndesign of common-law remedies, but we need not decide, because \nthe  choice  of  remedies  for  military  misconduct31  belongs  to \nCongress and the President rather than the judicial branch. \nVance, 701 F.3d at 203. \n    Indeed, the danger posed by an individual who is aligned with an enemy of the \nUnited States is very real, whether he is a citizen of this or another country.  The United States is \nin a congressionally-declared military conflict.  Anwar Al-Aulaqi was an AQAP leader who \nlevied war against his birth country, as unambiguously revealed by his role in the Christmas Day \nbombing, as well as his video and writings.  He also was a U.S. citizen.  Whether Plaintiffs can \nclaim damages against the United States is a decision for Congress and the Executive and not \nsomething to be granted by judicial implication.  The persons holding the jobs of the named \n                                                 \n31 Congress has provided various remedies to persons harmed by the military, but no statute \nprovides for damages against military personnel or their civilian superiors.  See, e.g., Vance, 701 \nF.3d at 201 (discussing application of, inter alia, the Military Claims Act, 10 U.S.C. § 2733 and \nthe Foreign Claims Act, 10 U.S.C. § 2734). \n37 \n \n\nDefendants must be trusted and expected to act in accordance with the U.S. Constitution when \nthey intentionally target a U.S. citizen abroad at the direction of the President and with the \nconcurrence of Congress.  They cannot be held personally responsible in monetary damages for \nconducting war. \n    Under binding D.C. Circuit precedent, this Court finds that special factors \npreclude the implication of a Bivens remedy here.  Because it reaches this conclusion, the Court \ndoes not address additional claims or defenses.  See, e.g., Doe v. Rumsfeld, 683 F.3d at 397 \n(having determined that a Bivens claim was not viable, court did not reach qualified immunity \ndefense).  Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendants’ motion to dismiss. \nC.  Order for Ex Parte Submission of Classified Information \n \n    As exhibits to its Statement of Interest, the United States refiled the same \nunclassified declarations that it had filed in support of its invocation of the state secrets privilege \nin Al-Aulaqi v. Obama, namely the unclassified declarations of Messrs. Clapper, Gates, and \nPanetta.  See Clapper Decl.; U.S. Statement of Interest, Ex. 2 [Dkt. 19-2] (Gates Decl.); id., Ex. 3 \n[Dkt. 19-3] (Panetta Decl.).  The unclassified declarations refer to more detailed classified \ndeclarations that were provided to the district court in Al-Aulaqi v. Obama.  This Court ordered \nthe United States to provide the classified declarations to the Court, see Minute Order (Dec. 26, \n2013),32 but the United States refused, seeking a ruling on the threshold legal defenses raised in \n                                                 \n32 The Minute Order required the United States to lodge classified declarations, in camera and ex \nparte: \nin order to provide to the Court information implicated by the \nallegations in this case and why its disclosure reasonably could be \nexpected  to  harm  national  security  [  ],  including  information \nneeded to address whether or not, or under what circumstances, the \nUnited States may target a particular foreign terrorist organization \nand its senior leadership, the specific threat posed by [ ] Anwar Al-\n38 \n \n\nDefendants’ motion to dismiss “before any court-ordered development of the factual record.”  \nSee Mot. for Recons. & to Stay Order [Dkt. 34] at ECF 6.33  The United States asserted that the \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss accepts the well-pled facts as true, without reference to classified \ninformation, see id. at 9, and that the motion “can and should be resolved without reference to \nthe classified information,” see id. at ECF 13.  Plaintiffs agreed.  Pls. Resp. to Mot. for Recons. \n[Dkt. 35].  The United States argued that the factual information that the Court requested was not \nrelevant to the Defendants’ special factors argument because special factors precluded Plaintiffs’ \ncause of action, given the context in which the claims, “as pled,” arose––that is, “the alleged \nfiring of missiles by military and intelligence officers at enemies in a foreign country in the \ncourse of an armed conflict.”  Mot. for Recons. & to Stay Order at ECF 10. \nThe United States, however, mischaracterizes the Complaint.  Nowhere does the \nComplaint allege that Anwar Al-Aulaqi was an “enemy” of the United States or that he was part \nof AQAP.  The Complaint states only that “government officials told reporters that Al-Aulaqi \nhad “cast his lot” with terrorist groups and encouraged others to engage in terrorist activity.  \nLater, they claimed he had played “a key role in setting the strategic direction” for [AQAP].”  \nCompl. ¶ 26.  Further, far from alleging that Anwar Al-Aulaqi was killed “in the course of an \narmed conflict,” the Complaint asserts that he was killed outside of armed conflict, in Yemen.  \nSee Compl. ¶ 4 (“At the time of the killing, the United States was not engaged in armed conflict \nwith or within Yemen.”).  In fact, Plaintiffs allege that “at the time the strike was carried out, \n                                                                                                                                                             \nAulaqi,  and  other  matters  that  Plaintiff[s  have]  put  at  issue, \nincluding any criteria governing the use of lethal force, updated to \naddress the facts of this record. \nMinute Order (Dec. 26, 2013). \n33 The Court cites the page number assigned by the Electronic Case Filing system. \n39 \n \n\nAnwar Al-Aulaqi was not engaged in activities that presented a concrete, specific, and imminent \nthreat of death or serious physical injury.”  Id. ¶ 34. \n    The United States’ truculent opposition to the December 26, 2013 Minute Order \nmade this case unnecessarily difficult.  Were the Court not able to cobble together enough \njudicially-noticeable facts from various records, it would have denied the motion to dismiss for \nthe sheer fact that the Defendants failed to support the assertion that Bivens special factors apply.  \nSince the Court was able to take notice of facts sufficient to determine the special factors issue, \nthe December 26, 2013 Minute Order will be vacated and the United States’ motion for \nreconsideration will be denied as moot. \n  D.  Bill of Attainder \n    Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants violated the Constitution’s Bill of Attainder \nClause by placing Anwar Al-Aulaqi on the JSOC “kill list.”34  The Constitution provides: “No \nBill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 9; see also id., § 10 \n(“No State shall . . . pass any Bill of Attainder [or] ex post facto Law . . . .”).  That is, the \nConstitution forbids legislative acts that inflict punishment without a judicial trial.  BellSouth \nCorp. v. FCC, 144 F.3d 58, 62  (D.C. Cir. 1998).  A Bill of Attainder requires legislative action \nintended to punish an individual.  Id.; Paradissiotis v. Rubin, 171 F.3d 983, 988 (5th Cir. 1999).  \nNo formal action of either the House or Senate was taken to approve the strike against Anwar \nAl-Aulaqi.  Because Plaintiffs can point to no legislative action, the Bill of Attainder Clause does \nnot apply. \n \n \n                                                 \n34 The Bill of Attainder claim is made only on behalf of Anwar Al-Aulaqi. \n40 \n \n\nIV.  CONCLUSION \n    For the reasons set forth above, Defendants’ motion to dismiss [Dkt. 18] will be \ngranted, and the Complaint will be dismissed.  The December 26, 2013 Minute Order will be \nvacated, and the United States’ motion for reconsideration [Dkt. 34] will be denied as moot.  A \nmemorializing Order accompanies this Opinion. \n \nDate:  April 4, 2014                                 /s/                             \n              ROSEMARY M.

Panetta, et al., No. 1:12-cv-01192 (RMC) \n\n<.@ffict llf fqt 1\\ttorntl! \n~tntrnl \nllttas ~ingtnn. E. Qt. 20,530 \nMay  22,  2013 \nThe Honorable Patrick J. Leahy \nChairman \nCommittee on the Judiciary \nUnited States Senate \nWashington, DC 20530 \nDear Mr. Chairman: \nSince entering office, the President has made clear his commitment to providing \nCongress and the American people with as much information as possible about our \nsensitive counterterrorism operations, consistent with our national security and the proper \nfunctioning of the Executive Branch.  Doing so is necessary, the President stated in his \nMay 21, 2009 National Archives speech, because it enables the citizens of our democracy \nto \"make informed judgments and hold [their Government] accountable.\" \nIn furtherance of this commitment, the Administration has provided an \nunprecedented level of transparency into how sensitive counterterrorism operations are \nconducted.  Several senior Administration officials, including myself, have taken \nnumerous steps to explain publicly the legal basis for the United States' actions to the \nAmerican people and the Congress.  For example, in March 2012, I delivered an address \nat Northwestern University Law School discussing certain aspects of the \nAdministration's counterterrorism legal framework.  And the Department of Justice and \nother departments and agencies have continually worked with the appropriate oversight \ncommittees in the Congress to ensure that those committees are fully informed of the \nlegal basis for our actions. \nThe Administration is determined to continue these extensive outreach efforts to \ncommunicate with the American people.  Indeed, the President reiterated in his State of \nthe Union address earlier this year that he would continue to engage with the Congress \nabout our counterterrorism efforts to ensure that they remain consistent with our laws and \nvalues, and become more transparent to the American people and to the world. \nTo this end, the President has direcied me to disclose certain information that until \nnow has been properly classified.  You and other Members of your Committee have on \nnumerous occasions expressed a particular interest in the Administration's use of lethal \nforce against U.S. citizens.  In light of this fact, I am writing to disclose to you certain \ninformation about the number of U.S. citizens who have been killed by U.S. \ncounterterrorism operations outside of areas of active hostilities.  Since 2009, the United \nStates, in the conduct of U.S. counterterrorism operations against al-Qa'ida and its \nEx. 1 - 1\n\nassociated forces outside of areas of active hostilities, has specifically targeted and killed \none U.S. citizen, Anwar al-Aulaqi.  The United States is further aware of three other U.S. \ncitizens who have been killed in such U.S. counterterrorism operations over that same \ntime period:  Samir Khan, 'Abd al-Rahman Anwar al-Aulaqi, and Jude Kenan \nMohammed.  These individuals were not specifically targeted by the United States. \nAs I noted in my speech at Northwestern, \"it is an unfortunate but undeniable \nfact\" that a \"small number\" of U.S. citizens \"have decided to commit violent attacks \nagainst their own country from abroad.\"  Based on generations-old legal principles and \nSupreme Court decisions handed down during World War II, as well as during the \ncurrent conflict, it is clear and logical that United States citizenship alone does not make \nsuch individuals immune from being targeted.  Rather, it means that the government must \ntake special care and take into account all relevant constitutional considerations, the laws \nof war, and other law with respect to U.S. citizens-even those who are leading efforts to \nkill their fellow, innocent Americans.  Such considerations allow for the use of lethal \nforce in a foreign country against a U.S. citizen who is a senior operational leader of al \nQa'ida or its associated forces, and who is actively engaged in planning to kill \nAmericans, in the following circumstances: (1) the U.S. government has determined, \nafter a thorough and careful review, that the individual poses an imminent threat of \nviolent attack against the United States; (2) capture is not feasible; and (3) the operation \nwould be conducted in a manner consistent with applicable law of war principles. \nThese conditions should not come as a surprise: the Administration's legal views \non this weighty issue have been clear and consistent over time.  The analysis in my \nspeech at Northwestern University Law School is entirely consistent with not only the \nanalysis found in the unclassified white paper the Department of Justice provided to your \nCommittee soon after my speech, but also with the classified analysis the Department \nshared with other congressional committees in May 2011 - months before the operation \nthat resulted in the death of Anwar al-Aulaqi.  The analysis in my speech is also entirely \nconsistent with the classified legal advice on this issue the Department of Justice has \nshared with your Committee more recently.  In short, the Administration has \ndemonstrated its commitment to discussing with the Congress and the American people \nthe circumstances in which it could lawfully use lethal force in a foreign country against \na U.S. citizen who is a senior operational leader of al-Qa'ida or its associated forces, and \nwho is actively engaged in planning to kill Americans. \nAnwar al-Aulaqi plainly satisfied all of the conditions I outlined in my speech at \nNorthwestern.  Let me be more specific.  Al-Aulaqi was a senior operational leader of al \nQa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the most dangerous regional affiliate of al \nQa'ida and a group that has committed numerous terrorist attacks overseas and attempted \nmultiple times to conduct terrorist attacks against the U.S. homeland.  And al-Aulaqi was \nnot just a senior leader of AQAP-he was the group's chief of external operations, \nintimately involved in detailed planning and putting in place plots against U.S. persons. \nIn this role, al-Aulaqi repeatedly made clear his intent to attack U.S. persons and \nhis hope that these attacks would take American lives.  For example, in a message to \nEx. 1 - 2\n\nMuslims living in the United States, he noted that he had come \"to the conclusion that \njihad against America is binding upon myself just as it is binding upon every other able \nMuslim.\"  But it was not al-Aulaqi's words that led the United States to act against him: \nthey only served to demonstrate his intentions and state of mind, that he \"pray[e d] that \nAllah [would] destro[y] America and all its allies.\"  Rather, it was al-Aulaqi's actions \nand, in particular, his direct personal involvement in the continued planning and \nexecution of terrorist attacks against the U.S. homeland- that made him a lawful target \nand led the United States to take action. \nFor example, when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab-the individual who attempted \nto blow up an airplane bound for Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 - went to Yemen in \n2009, al-Aulaqi arranged an introduction via text message.  Abdulmutallab told U.S. \nofficials that he stayed at al-Aulaqi's house for three days, and then spent two weeks at \nan AQAP training camp.  Al-Aulaqi planned a suicide operation for Abdulmutallab, \nhelped Abdulmutallab draft a statement for a martyrdom video to be shown after the \nattack, and directed him to take down a U.S. airliner.  Al-Aulaqi's last instructions were \nto blow up the airplane when it was over American soil.  Al-Aulaqi also played a key role \nin the October 2010 plot to detonate explosive devices on two U.S.-bound cargo planes: \nhe not only helped plan and oversee the plot, but was also directly involved in the details \nof its execution - to the point that he took part in the development and testing of the \nexplosive devices that were placed on the planes.  Moreover, information that remains \nclassified to protect sensitive sources and methods evidences al-Aulaqi's involvement in \nthe planning of numerous other plots against U.S. and Western interests and makes clear \nhe was continuing to plot attacks when he was killed. \nBased on this information, high-level U.S. government officials appropriately \nconcluded that al-Aulaqi posed a continuing and imminent threat of violent attack against \nthe United States.  Before carrying out the operation that killed al-Aulaqi, senior officials \nalso determined, based on a careful evaluation of the circumstances at the time, that it \nwas not feasible to capture al-Aulaqi.  In addition, senior officials determined that the \noperation would be conducted consistent with applicable law of war principles, including \nthe cardinal principles of (1) necessity - the requirement that the target have definite \nmilitary value; (2) distinction-the idea that only military objectives may be intentionally \ntargeted and that civilians are protected from being intentionally targeted; (3) \nproportionality-the notion that the anticipated collateral damage of an action cannot be \nexcessive in relation to the anticipated concrete and direct military advantage; and (4) \nhumanity - a principle that requires us to use weapons that will not inflict unnecessary \nsuffering.  The operation was also undertaken consistent with Yemeni sovereignty. \nWhile a substantial amount of information indicated that Anwar al-Aulaqi was a \nsenior AQAP leader actively plotting to kill Americans, the decision that he was a lawful \ntarget was not taken lightly.  The decision to use lethal force is one of the gravest that our \ngovernment, at every level, can face.  The operation to target Anwar al-Aulaqi was thus \nsubjected to an exceptionally rigorous interagency legal review:  not only did I and other \nDepartment of Justice lawyers conclude after a thorough and searching review that the \nEx. 1 - 3\n\noperation was lawful, but so too did other departments and agencies within the U.S. \ngovernment. \nThe decision to target Anwar al-Aulaqi was additionally subjected to extensive \npolicy review at the highest levels of the U.S. Government, and senior U.S. officials also \nbriefed the appropriate committees of Congress on the possibility of using lethal force \nagainst al-Aulaqi.  Indeed, the Administration informed the relevant congressional \noversight committees that it had approved the use oflethal force against al-Aulaqi in \nFebruary 2010-well over a year before the operation in question-and the legal \njustification was subsequently explained in detail to those committees, well before action \nwas taken against Aulaqi.  This extensive outreach is consistent with the Administration's \nstrong and continuing commitment to congressional oversight of our counterterrorism \noperations - oversight which ensures, as the President stated during his State of the \nUnion address, that our actions are \"consistent with our laws and system of checks and \nbalances.\" \nThe Supreme Court has long \"made clear that a state of war is not a blank check \nfor the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.\"  Hamdi v. \nRumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. \n578, 587 (1952).  But the Court's case law and longstanding practice and principle also \nmake clear that the Constitution does not prohibit the Government it establishes from \ntaking action to protect the American people from the threats posed by terrorists who hide \nin faraway countries and continually plan and launch plots against the U.S. homeland. \nThe decision to target Anwar al-Aulaqi was lawful, it was considered, and it was just. \n* * * * * \nThis letter is only one of a number of steps the Administration will be taking to \nfulfill the President's State of the Union commitment to engage with Congress and the \nAmerican people on our counterterrorism efforts.  This week the President approved and \nrelevant congressional committees will be notified and briefed on a document that \ninstitutionalizes the Administration's exacting standards and processes for reviewing and \napproving operations to capture or use lethal force against terrorist targets outside the \nUnited States and areas of active hostilities; these standards and processes are either \nalready in place or are to be transitioned into place.  While that document remains \nclassified, it makes clear that a cornerstone of the Administration's policy is one ofthe \nprinciples I noted in my speech at Northwestern: that lethal force should not be used \nwhen it is feasible to capture a terrorist suspect.  For circumstances in which capture is \nfeasible, the policy outlines standards and procedures to ensure that operations to take \ninto custody a terrorist suspect are conducted in accordance with all applicable law, \nincluding the laws of war.  When capture is not feasible, the policy provides that lethal \nforce may be used only when a terrorist target poses a continuing, imminent threat to \nAmericans, and when certain other preconditions, including a requirement that no other \nreasonable alternatives exist to effectively address the threat, are satisfied.  And in all \ncircumstances there must be a legal basis for using force against the target.  Significantly, \nEx. 1 - 4\n\nthe President will soon be speaking publicly in greater detail about our counterterrorism \noperations and the legal and policy framework that governs those actions. \nI recognize that even after the Administration makes unprecedented disclosures \nlike those contained in this letter, some unanswered questions will remain.  I assure you \nthat the President and his national security team are mindful of this Administration's \npledge to public accountability for our counterterrorism efforts, and we will continue to \ngive careful consideration to whether and how additional information may be declassified \nand disclosed to the American people without harming our national security. \nSincerely, \nEric H.

      "text": "U.S. Acknowledges Killing 4 Americans in Drone Strikes -NYTimes.com Page 1of 4\nMay 22, 2013\nObama, in a Shift, to Limit Targets of \nDrone Strikes\nBy CHARLIE SAVAGEand PETER BAKER\nWASHINGTON —President Obama plans to open a new phase in the nation’s long struggle \nwith terrorism on Thursday by restricting the use of unmanned drone strikes that have been \nat the heart of his national security strategy and shifting control of them away from the \nC.I.A. to the military. \nIn his first major speech on counterterrorism of his second term, Mr. Obama hopes to \nrefocus the epic conflict that has defined American priorities since the attacks of Sept. 11, \n2001, and even foresees an unspecified day when the so-called war on terror might all but \nend, according to people briefed on White House plans. \nAs part of the shift in approach, the administration on Wednesday formally acknowledged \nfor the first time that it had killed four American citizens in drone strikes outside the \nbattlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq, arguing that its actions were justified by the danger to \nthe United States. Mr. Obama approved providing new information to Congress and the \npublic about the rules governing his attacks on Al Qaeda and its allies. \nA new classified policy guidance signed by Mr. Obama will sharply curtail the instances \nwhen unmanned aircraft can be used to attack in places that are not overt war zones, \ncountries like Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. The rules will impose the same standard for \nstrikes on foreign enemies now used only for American citizens deemed to be terrorists. \nLethal force will be used only against targets who pose “a continuing, imminent threat to \nAmericans” and cannot feasibly be captured, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a \nletter to Congress, suggesting that threats to a partner like Afghanistan or Yemen alone \nwould not be enough to justify being targeted. \nThe standard could signal an end to “signature strikes,” or attacks on groups of unknown \nmen based only on their presumed status as members of Al Qaeda or some other enemy \ngroup —an approach that administration critics say has resulted in many civilian casualties. \nIn effect, this appears to be a step away from the less restricted use of force allowed in war \nzones and toward the more limited use of force for self-defense allowed outside of armed \nconflict. \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/us/us-acknowledges-killing-4-americans-in-drone-str... 11/1/2013\n\nU.S. Acknowledges Killing 4 Americans in Drone Strikes -NYTimes.com Page 2of 4\nIn the speech he will give on Thursday at the National Defense University, Mr. Obama will \nalso renew his long-stalled effort to close the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Officials said \nthey would make a fresh push to transfer detainees to home countries and lift the ban on \nsending some back to Yemen. The president plans to reappoint a high-level State \nDepartment official to oversee the effort to reduce the prison population. \nThe combined actions constitute a pivot point for a president who came to office highly \ncritical of his predecessor, George W. Bush, yet who preserved and in some cases expanded \non some of the counterterrorism policies he inherited. Much as Mr. Bush did in 2006 when \nhe acknowledged and emptied secret overseas C.I.A. prisons, Mr. Obama appears intent on \ncountering criticism of his most controversial policies by reorienting them to meet changing \nconditions. \nIn his speech, Mr. Obama is expected to reject the notion of a perpetual war with terrorists, \nenvisioning a day when Al Qaeda has been so incapacitated that wartime authority will end. \nHowever, because he is also institutionalizing procedures for drone strikes, it does not \nappear that he thinks that day has come. A Pentagon official suggested last week that the \ncurrent conflict could continue for 10 to 20 years. \nYet even as he moves the counterterrorism effort to a next stage, Mr. Obama plans to offer a \nrobust defense of a continued role for targeted killings, a policy he has generally addressed \nonly in passing or in interviews rather than in a comprehensive speech. A White House \nofficial said he “will discuss why the use of drone strikes is necessary, legal and just, while \naddressing the various issues raised by our use of targeted action.” \nWhile Mr. Obama may not explicitly announce the shift in drones from the Central \nIntelligence Agency in his speech, since the agency’s operations remain formally classified, \nthe change underscores a desire by the president and his advisers to balance them with other \nlegal and diplomatic tools. The C.I.A., which has overseen the drone war in the tribal areas of \nPakistan and elsewhere, will generally cede its role to the military after a six-month \ntransition period as forces draw down in Afghanistan, officials said. \nDrone strikes have already been decreasing in the past few years as targets have been killed \nand opposition has grown. John O. Brennan, the new C.I.A. director, has been eager to shift \nthe agency more toward espionage, intelligence gathering and analysis and away from the \nparamilitary mission it has adopted since Sept. 11. \nSenator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said \nthat after more than a decade of war it was time to “rebalance” the missions of the Pentagon \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/us/us-acknowledges-killing-4-americans-in-drone-str... 11/1/2013\n\nU.S. Acknowledges Killing 4 Americans in Drone Strikes -NYTimes.com Page 3of 4\nand C.I.A. “The policy is intended to refocus the activities of the intelligence community to \ncollection, which is crucial,” he said. \nBut Mr. Obama’s moves may provoke criticism from some Republicans who say a law \nenforcement approach underestimates the continuing threat from terrorism. An aide to \nRepresentative Howard P. McKeon of California, chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, said his boss would insist on “concrete answers” about what Mr. Obama planned \nto do with “terrorists who are too dangerous to be released” from Guantánamo. \nIn his letter to Congressional leaders, Mr. Holder confirmed that the administration had \ndeliberately killed Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical Muslim cleric who died in a drone strike in \nSeptember 2011 in Yemen. Mr. Holder also wrote that United States forces had killed three \nother Americans who “were not specifically targeted.” \nThe American involvement in Mr. Awlaki’s death has been widely reported, but the \nadministration until now had refused to confirm it. Likewise, Mr. Holder confirmed the \ngovernment’s role in the deaths of Samir Khan, who was killed in the same strike, and Mr. \nAwlaki’s son, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, who died in another strike. The letter disclosed the \ndeath of a fourth American named Jude Kenan Mohammad but gave no further details. \nMr. Holder defended the actions, saying they were consistent with American law and taken \nonly after careful consideration. “Based on generations-old legal principles and Supreme \nCourt decisions handed down during World War II, as well as during the current conflict, it \nis clear and logical that United States citizenship alone does not make such individuals \nimmune from being targeted,” he wrote. \nCritics were not assuaged. “The Obama administration continues to claim authority to kill \nvirtually anyone anywhere in the world under the ‘global battlefield’ legal theory and a \nradical redefinition of the concept of imminence,” said Zeke Johnson of Amnesty \nInternational. “President Obama should reject these concepts in his speech tomorrow and \ncommit to upholding human rights, not just in word but in deed.” \nThe lifting of the veil of official secrecy over the Awlaki killing could have broad legal \nramifications. The Justice Department on Wednesday afternoon dropped an effort to throw \nout a California lawsuit seeking documents related to the killing, while a judge here ordered \nthe government to address the disclosure in a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by Mr. \nAwlaki’s family. \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/us/us-acknowledges-killing-4-americans-in-drone-str... 11/1/2013\n\nU.S. Acknowledges Killing 4 Americans in Drone Strikes -NYTimes.com Page 4of 4\nMr. Holder, in a speech at Northwestern law schoollast year, laid out the administration’s \nbasic legal thinking that it could target American citizens deemed to be operational terrorists \nwho pose an “imminent threat of violent attack” and where capture is not feasible. \nMr. Holder’s letter expanded the rationale for the killing of Mr. Awlaki. Mr. Holder said Mr. \nAwlaki not only had “planned” the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner on Dec. \n25, 2009, a claim that has been widely discussed in court documents and elsewhere, but had \nalso “played a key role” in an October 2010 plot to blow up cargo planes bound for the \nUnited States, including taking “part in the development and testing” of the bombs. He \nadded that Mr. Awlaki had also been involved in “the planning of numerous other plots.” \n“The decision to target Anwar al-Awlaki was lawful, it was considered, and it was just,” Mr. \nHolder said. \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/us/us-acknowledges-killing-4-americans-in-drone-str... 11/1/2013",

Panetta, et al., No. 1:12-cv-01192 (RMC) \n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE \nOffice of the Press Secretary \n________________________________________________________________\n_ \nFor Immediate Release                            May 23, 2013 \n \n \nREMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT \nON THE FUTURE OF OUR FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM \n \nNational Defense University  \nFort McNair \nWashington, D.C.   \n \n \n \n2:01 P.M. EDT \n \n \n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Please be \nseated.   \n \nIt is a great honor to return to the National Defense \nUniversity.  Here, at Fort McNair, Americans have served in \nuniform since 1791 -- standing guard in the earliest days of the \nRepublic, and contemplating the future of warfare here in the \n21st century. \n \nFor over two centuries, the United States has been bound \ntogether by founding documents that defined who we are as \nAmericans, and served as our compass through every type of \nchange.  Matters of war and peace are no different.  Americans \nare deeply ambivalent about war, but having fought for our \nindependence, we know a price must be paid for freedom.  From \nthe Civil War to our struggle against fascism, on through the \nlong twilight struggle of the Cold War, battlefields have \nchanged and technology has evolved.  But our commitment to \nconstitutional principles has weathered every war, and every war \nhas come to an end.  \nWith the collapse of the Berlin Wall, a new dawn of \ndemocracy took hold abroad, and a decade of peace and prosperity \narrived here at home.  And for a moment, it seemed the 21st \ncentury would be a tranquil time.  And then, on September 11, \n2001, we were shaken out of complacency.  Thousands were taken \nfrom us, as clouds of fire and metal and ash descended upon a \nsun-filled morning.  This was a different kind of war.  No \nEx. 2 - 1\n\narmies came to our shores, and our military was not the \nprincipal target.  Instead, a group of terrorists came to kill \nas many civilians as they could.  \nAnd so our nation went to war.  We have now been at war for \nwell over a decade.  I won’t review the full history.  What is \nclear is that we quickly drove al Qaeda out of Afghanistan, but \nthen shifted our focus and began a new war in Iraq.  And this \ncarried significant consequences for our fight against al Qaeda, \nour standing in the world, and -- to this day -- our interests \nin a vital region. \nMeanwhile, we strengthened our defenses -- hardening \ntargets, tightening transportation security, giving law \nenforcement new tools to prevent terror.  Most of these changes \nwere sound.  Some caused inconvenience.  But some, like expanded \nsurveillance, raised difficult questions about the balance that \nwe strike between our interests in security and our values of \nprivacy.  And in some cases, I believe we compromised our basic \nvalues -- by using torture to interrogate our enemies, and \ndetaining individuals in a way that ran counter to the rule of \nlaw.  \nSo after I took office, we stepped up the war against al \nQaeda but we also sought to change its course.  We relentlessly \ntargeted al Qaeda’s leadership.  We ended the war in Iraq, and \nbrought nearly 150,000 troops home.  We pursued a new strategy \nin Afghanistan, and increased our training of Afghan forces.  We \nunequivocally banned torture, affirmed our commitment to \ncivilian courts, worked to align our policies with the rule of \nlaw, and expanded our consultations with Congress. \nToday, Osama bin Laden is dead, and so are most of his top \nlieutenants.  There have been no large-scale attacks on the \nUnited States, and our homeland is more secure.  Fewer of our \ntroops are in harm’s way, and over the next 19 months they will \ncontinue to come home.  Our alliances are strong, and so is our \nstanding in the world.  In sum, we are safer because of our \nefforts. \nNow, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by \nterrorists.  From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically \nreminded of that truth.  But we have to recognize that the \nthreat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our \nshores on 9/11.  With a decade of experience now to draw from, \nthis is the moment to ask ourselves hard questions -- about the \nnature of today’s threats and how we should confront them.  \nAnd these questions matter to every American.   \nEx. 2 - 2\n\nFor over the last decade, our nation has spent well over a \ntrillion dollars on war, helping to explode our deficits and \nconstraining our ability to nation-build here at home.  Our \nservicemembers and their families have sacrificed far more on \nour behalf.  Nearly 7,000 Americans have made the ultimate \nsacrifice. Many more have left a part of themselves on the \nbattlefield, or brought the shadows of battle back home.  From \nour use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the \ndecisions that we are making now will define the type of nation \n-- and world -- that we leave to our children.   \nSo America is at a crossroads.  We must define the nature \nand scope of this struggle, or else it will define us.  We have \nto be mindful of James Madison’s warning that “No nation could \npreserve its freedom in the midst of continual \nwarfare.”  Neither I, nor any President, can promise the total \ndefeat of terror.  We will never erase the evil that lies in the \nhearts of some human beings, nor stamp out every danger to our \nopen society.  But what we can do -- what we must do -- is \ndismantle networks that pose a direct danger to us, and make it \nless likely for new groups to gain a foothold, all the while \nmaintaining the freedoms and ideals that we defend.  And to \ndefine that strategy, we have to make decisions based not on \nfear, but on hard-earned wisdom.  That begins with understanding \nthe current threat that we face.  \nToday, the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is \non the path to defeat.  Their remaining operatives spend more \ntime thinking about their own safety than plotting against \nus.  They did not direct the attacks in Benghazi or \nBoston.  They’ve not carried out a successful attack on our \nhomeland since 9/11.  \nInstead, what we’ve seen is the emergence of various al \nQaeda affiliates.  From Yemen to Iraq, from Somalia to North \nAfrica, the threat today is more diffuse, with Al Qaeda’s \naffiliates in the Arabian Peninsula -- AQAP -- the most active \nin plotting against our homeland.  And while none of AQAP’s \nefforts approach the scale of 9/11, they have continued to plot \nacts of terror, like the attempt to blow up an airplane on \nChristmas Day in 2009.  \nUnrest in the Arab world has also allowed extremists to \ngain a foothold in countries like Libya and Syria.  But here, \ntoo, there are differences from 9/11.  In some cases, we \ncontinue to confront state-sponsored networks like Hezbollah \nthat engage in acts of terror to achieve political goals.  Other \nof these groups are simply collections of local militias or \nEx. 2 - 3\n\nextremists interested in seizing territory.  And while we are \nvigilant for signs that these groups may pose a transnational \nthreat, most are focused on operating in the countries and \nregions where they are based.  And that means we'll face more \nlocalized threats like what we saw in Benghazi, or the BP oil \nfacility in Algeria, in which local operatives -- perhaps in \nloose affiliation with regional networks -- launch periodic \nattacks against Western diplomats, companies, and other soft \ntargets, or resort to kidnapping and other criminal enterprises \nto fund their operations.  \nAnd finally, we face a real threat from radicalized \nindividuals here in the United States.  Whether it’s a shooter \nat a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin, a plane flying into a building in \nTexas, or the extremists who killed 168 people at the Federal \nBuilding in Oklahoma City, America has confronted many forms of \nviolent extremism in our history.  Deranged or alienated \nindividuals -- often U.S. citizens or legal residents -- can do \nenormous damage, particularly when inspired by larger notions of \nviolent jihad.  And that pull towards extremism appears to have \nled to the shooting at Fort Hood and the bombing of the Boston \nMarathon.   \nSo that’s the current threat -- lethal yet less capable al \nQaeda affiliates; threats to diplomatic facilities and \nbusinesses abroad; homegrown extremists.  This is the future of \nterrorism. We have to take these threats seriously, and do all \nthat we can to confront them.  But as we shape our response, we \nhave to recognize that the scale of this threat closely \nresembles the types of attacks we faced before 9/11.   \nIn the 1980s, we lost Americans to terrorism at our Embassy \nin Beirut; at our Marine Barracks in Lebanon; on a cruise ship \nat sea; at a disco in Berlin; and on a Pan Am flight -- Flight \n103  -- over Lockerbie.  In the 1990s, we lost Americans to \nterrorism at the World Trade Center; at our military facilities \nin Saudi Arabia; and at our Embassy in Kenya.  These attacks \nwere all brutal; they were all deadly; and we learned that left \nunchecked, these threats can grow.  But if dealt with smartly \nand proportionally, these threats need not rise to the level \nthat we saw on the eve of 9/11.  \nMoreover, we have to recognize that these threats don’t \narise in a vacuum.  Most, though not all, of the terrorism we \nfaced is fueled by a common ideology -- a belief by some \nextremists that Islam is in conflict with the United States and \nthe West, and that violence against Western targets, including \ncivilians, is justified in pursuit of a larger cause.  Of \nEx. 2 - 4\n\ncourse, this ideology is based on a lie, for the United States \nis not at war with Islam.  And this ideology is rejected by the \nvast majority of Muslims, who are the most frequent victims of \nterrorist attacks.  \nNevertheless, this ideology persists, and in an age when \nideas and images can travel the globe in an instant, our \nresponse to terrorism can’t depend on military or law \nenforcement alone. We need all elements of national power to win \na battle of wills, a battle of ideas.  So what I want to discuss \nhere today is the components of such a comprehensive \ncounterterrorism strategy.   \nFirst, we must finish the work of defeating al Qaeda and \nits associated forces. \nIn Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan \nresponsibility for that country’s security.  Our troops will \ncome home.  Our combat mission will come to an end.  And we will \nwork with the Afghan government to train security forces, and \nsustain a counterterrorism force, which ensures that al Qaeda \ncan never again establish a safe haven to launch attacks against \nus or our allies. \nBeyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a \nboundless “global war on terror,” but rather as a series of \npersistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of \nviolent extremists that threaten America.  In many cases, this \nwill involve partnerships with other countries.  Already, \nthousands of Pakistani soldiers have lost their lives fighting \nextremists.  In Yemen, we are supporting security forces that \nhave reclaimed territory from AQAP.  In Somalia, we helped a \ncoalition of African nations push al-Shabaab out of its \nstrongholds.  In Mali, we’re providing military aid to French-\nled intervention to push back al Qaeda in the Maghreb, and help \nthe people of Mali reclaim their future. \nMuch of our best counterterrorism cooperation results in \nthe gathering and sharing of intelligence, the arrest and \nprosecution of terrorists.  And that’s how a Somali terrorist \napprehended off the coast of Yemen is now in a prison in New \nYork.  That’s how we worked with European allies to disrupt \nplots from Denmark to Germany to the United Kingdom.  That’s how \nintelligence collected with Saudi Arabia helped us stop a cargo \nplane from being blown up over the Atlantic.  These partnerships \nwork. \nBut despite our strong preference for the detention and \nprosecution of terrorists, sometimes this approach is \nEx. 2 - 5\n\nforeclosed. Al Qaeda and its affiliates try to gain foothold in \nsome of the most distant and unforgiving places on Earth.  They \ntake refuge in remote tribal regions.  They hide in caves and \nwalled compounds.  They train in empty deserts and rugged \nmountains.  \nIn some of these places -- such as parts of Somalia and \nYemen -- the state only has the most tenuous reach into the \nterritory.  In other cases, the state lacks the capacity or will \nto take action.  And it’s also not possible for America to \nsimply deploy a team of Special Forces to capture every \nterrorist.  Even when such an approach may be possible, there \nare places where it would pose profound risks to our troops and \nlocal civilians -- where a terrorist compound cannot be breached \nwithout triggering a firefight with surrounding tribal \ncommunities, for example, that pose no threat to us; times when \nputting U.S. boots on the ground may trigger a major \ninternational crisis. \nTo put it another way, our operation in Pakistan against \nOsama bin Laden cannot be the norm.  The risks in that case were \nimmense.  The likelihood of capture, although that was our \npreference, was remote given the certainty that our folks would \nconfront resistance.  The fact that we did not find ourselves \nconfronted with civilian casualties, or embroiled in an extended \nfirefight, was a testament to the meticulous planning and \nprofessionalism of our Special Forces, but it also depended on \nsome luck.  And it was supported by massive infrastructure in \nAfghanistan.   \nAnd even then, the cost to our relationship with Pakistan -\n- and the backlash among the Pakistani public over encroachment \non their territory -- was so severe that we are just now \nbeginning to rebuild this important partnership. \nSo it is in this context that the United States has taken \nlethal, targeted action against al Qaeda and its associated \nforces, including with remotely piloted aircraft commonly \nreferred to as drones.   \nAs was true in previous armed conflicts, this new \ntechnology raises profound questions -- about who is targeted, \nand why; about civilian casualties, and the risk of creating new \nenemies; about the legality of such strikes under U.S. and \ninternational law; about accountability and morality.  So let me \naddress these questions.   \nTo begin with, our actions are effective.  Don’t take my \nword for it.  In the intelligence gathered at bin Laden’s \nEx. 2 - 6\n\ncompound, we found that he wrote, “We could lose the reserves to \nenemy’s air strikes.  We cannot fight air strikes with \nexplosives.”  Other communications from al Qaeda operatives \nconfirm this as well.  Dozens of highly skilled al Qaeda \ncommanders, trainers, bomb makers and operatives have been taken \noff the battlefield.  Plots have been disrupted that would have \ntargeted international aviation, U.S. transit systems, European \ncities and our troops in Afghanistan.  Simply put, these strikes \nhave saved lives. \nMoreover, America’s actions are legal.  We were attacked on \n9/11.  Within a week, Congress overwhelmingly authorized the use \nof force.  Under domestic law, and international law, the United \nStates is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their \nassociated forces.  We are at war with an organization that \nright now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did \nnot stop them first.  So this is a just war -- a war waged \nproportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense. \nAnd yet, as our fight enters a new phase, America’s \nlegitimate claim of self-defense cannot be the end of the \ndiscussion.  To say a military tactic is legal, or even \neffective, is not to say it is wise or moral in every \ninstance.  For the same human progress that gives us the \ntechnology to strike half a world away also demands the \ndiscipline to constrain that power -- or risk abusing it.  And \nthat’s why, over the last four years, my administration has \nworked vigorously to establish a framework that governs our use \nof force against terrorists –- insisting upon clear guidelines, \noversight and accountability that is now codified in \nPresidential Policy Guidance that I signed yesterday. \nIn the Afghan war theater, we must -- and will -- continue \nto support our troops until the transition is complete at the \nend of 2014.  And that means we will continue to take strikes \nagainst high value al Qaeda targets, but also against forces \nthat are massing to support attacks on coalition forces.  But by \nthe end of 2014, we will no longer have the same need for force \nprotection, and the progress we’ve made against core al Qaeda \nwill reduce the need for unmanned strikes. \nBeyond the Afghan theater, we only target al Qaeda and its \nassociated forces.  And even then, the use of drones is heavily \nconstrained.  America does not take strikes when we have the \nability to capture individual terrorists; our preference is \nalways to detain, interrogate, and prosecute.  America cannot \ntake strikes wherever we choose; our actions are bound by \nconsultations with partners, and respect for state sovereignty.   \nEx. 2 - 7\n\nAmerica does not take strikes to punish individuals; we act \nagainst terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to \nthe American people, and when there are no other governments \ncapable of effectively addressing the threat.  And before any \nstrike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians \nwill be killed or injured -- the highest standard we can set. \nNow, this last point is critical, because much of the \ncriticism about drone strikes -- both here at home and abroad -- \nunderstandably centers on reports of civilian \ncasualties.  There’s a wide gap between U.S. assessments of such \ncasualties and nongovernmental reports.  Nevertheless, it is a \nhard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian \ncasualties, a risk that exists in every war.  And for the \nfamilies of those civilians, no words or legal construct can \njustify their loss.  For me, and those in my chain of command, \nthose deaths will haunt us as long as we live, just as we are \nhaunted by the civilian casualties that have occurred throughout \nconventional fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.  \nBut as Commander-in-Chief, I must weigh these heartbreaking \ntragedies against the alternatives.  To do nothing in the face \n-\nof terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties \n- \nnot just in our cities at home and our facilities abroad, but \nalso in the very places like Sana’a and Kabul and Mogadishu \nwhere terrorists seek a foothold.  Remember that the terrorists \nwe are after target civilians, and the death toll from their \nacts of terrorism against Muslims dwarfs any estimate of \ncivilian casualties from drone strikes.  So doing nothing is not \n \nan option. \nWhere foreign governments cannot or will not effectively \nstop terrorism in their territory, the primary alternative to \ntargeted lethal action would be the use of conventional military \noptions.  As I’ve already said, even small special operations \ncarry enormous risks.  Conventional airpower or missiles are far \nless precise than drones, and are likely to cause more civilian \ncasualties and more local outrage.  And invasions of these \nterritories lead us to be viewed as occupying armies, unleash a \ntorrent of unintended consequences, are difficult to contain, \nresult in large numbers of civilian casualties and ultimately \nempower those who thrive on violent conflict.   \nSo it is false to assert that putting boots on the ground \nis less likely to result in civilian deaths or less likely to \ncreate enemies in the Muslim world.  The results would be more \nU.S. deaths, more Black Hawks down, more confrontations with \nEx. 2 - 8\n\nlocal populations, and an inevitable mission creep in support of \nsuch raids that could easily escalate into new wars.  \nYes, the conflict with al Qaeda, like all armed conflict, \ninvites tragedy.  But by narrowly targeting our action against \nthose who want to kill us and not the people they hide among, we \nare choosing the course of action least likely to result in the \nloss of innocent life.  \nOur efforts must be measured against the history of putting \nAmerican troops in distant lands among hostile populations.  In \nVietnam, hundreds of thousands of civilians died in a war where \nthe boundaries of battle were blurred.  In Iraq and Afghanistan, \ndespite the extraordinary courage and discipline of our troops, \nthousands of civilians have been killed.  So neither \nconventional military action nor waiting for attacks to occur \noffers moral safe harbor, and neither does a sole reliance on \nlaw enforcement in territories that have no functioning police \nor security services -- and indeed, have no functioning law.   \nNow, this is not to say that the risks are not real.  Any \nU.S. military action in foreign lands risks creating more \nenemies and impacts public opinion overseas.  Moreover, our laws \nconstrain the power of the President even during wartime, and I \nhave taken an oath to defend the Constitution of the United \nStates.  The very precision of drone strikes and the necessary \nsecrecy often involved in such actions can end up shielding our \ngovernment from the public scrutiny that a troop deployment \ninvites.  It can also lead a President and his team to view \ndrone strikes as a cure-all for terrorism.  \nAnd for this reason, I’ve insisted on strong oversight of \nall lethal action.  After I took office, my administration began \nbriefing all strikes outside of Iraq and Afghanistan to the \nappropriate committees of Congress.  Let me repeat that:  Not \nonly did Congress authorize the use of force, it is briefed on \nevery strike that America takes.  Every strike.  That includes \nthe one instance when we targeted an American citizen -- Anwar \nAwlaki, the chief of external operations for AQAP.  \nThis week, I authorized the declassification of this \naction, and the deaths of three other Americans in drone \nstrikes, to facilitate transparency and debate on this issue and \nto dismiss some of the more outlandish claims that have been \nmade.  For the record, I do not believe it would be \nconstitutional for the government to target and kill any U.S. \ncitizen -- with a drone, or with a shotgun -- without due \nEx. 2 - 9\n\nprocess, nor should any President deploy armed drones over U.S. \nsoil.  \nBut when a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against \nAmerica and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens, and when \nneither the United States, nor our partners are in a position to \ncapture him before he carries out a plot, his citizenship should \nno more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an \ninnocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team. \nThat’s who Anwar Awlaki was -- he was continuously trying \nto kill people.  He helped oversee the 2010 plot to detonate \nexplosive devices on two U.S.-bound cargo planes.  He was \ninvolved in planning to blow up an airliner in 2009.  When \nFarouk Abdulmutallab -- the Christmas Day bomber -- went to \nYemen in 2009, Awlaki hosted him, approved his suicide \noperation, helped him tape a martyrdom video to be shown after \nthe attack, and his last instructions were to blow up the \nairplane when it was over American soil.  I would have detained \nand prosecuted Awlaki if we captured him before he carried out a \nplot, but we couldn’t.  And as President, I would have been \nderelict in my duty had I not authorized the strike that took \nhim out.  \nOf course, the targeting of any American raises \nconstitutional issues that are not present in other strikes -- \nwhich is why my administration submitted information about \nAwlaki to the Department of Justice months before Awlaki was \nkilled, and briefed the Congress before this strike as \nwell.  But the high threshold that we’ve set for taking lethal \naction applies to all potential terrorist targets, regardless of \nwhether or not they are American citizens.  This threshold \nrespects the inherent dignity of every human life.  Alongside \nthe decision to put our men and women in uniform in harm’s way, \nthe decision to use force against individuals or groups -- even \nagainst a sworn enemy of the United States -- is the hardest \nthing I do as President.  But these decisions must be made, \n \ngiven my responsibility to protect the American people. \nGoing forward, I’ve asked my administration to review \nproposals to extend oversight of lethal actions outside of \nwarzones that go beyond our reporting to Congress.  Each option \nhas virtues in theory, but poses difficulties in practice.  For \nexample, the establishment of a special court to evaluate and \nauthorize lethal action has the benefit of bringing a third \nbranch of government into the process, but raises serious \nconstitutional issues about presidential and judicial authority. \nAnother idea that’s been suggested -- the establishment of an \nEx. 2 - 10\n\nindependent oversight board in the executive branch -- avoids \nthose problems, but may introduce a layer of bureaucracy into \nnational security decision-making, without inspiring additional \npublic confidence in the process.  But despite these challenges, \nI look forward to actively engaging Congress to explore these \nand other options for increased oversight.  \nI believe, however, that the use of force must be seen as \npart of a larger discussion we need to have about a \ncomprehensive counterterrorism strategy -- because for all the \nfocus on the use of force, force alone cannot make us safe.  We \ncannot use force everywhere that a radical ideology takes root; \nand in the absence of a strategy that reduces the wellspring of \nextremism, a perpetual war -- through drones or Special Forces \nor troop deployments -- will prove self-defeating, and alter our \ncountry in troubling ways.  \nSo the next element of our strategy involves addressing the \nunderlying grievances and conflicts that feed extremism -- from \nNorth Africa to South Asia.  As we’ve learned this past decade, \nthis is a vast and complex undertaking.  We must be humble in \nour expectation that we can quickly resolve deep-rooted problems \nlike poverty and sectarian hatred.  Moreover, no two countries \nare alike, and some will undergo chaotic change before things \nget better.  But our security and our values demand that we make \nthe effort.  \nThis means patiently supporting transitions to democracy in \nplaces like Egypt and Tunisia and Libya -- because the peaceful \nrealization of individual aspirations will serve as a rebuke to \nviolent extremists.  We must strengthen the opposition in Syria, \nwhile isolating extremist elements -- because the end of a \ntyrant must not give way to the tyranny of terrorism.  We are \nactively working to promote peace between Israelis and \nPalestinians -- because it is right and because such a peace \ncould help reshape attitudes in the region.  And we must help \ncountries modernize economies, upgrade education, and encourage \nentrepreneurship -- because American leadership has always been \nelevated by our ability to connect with people’s hopes, and not \nsimply their fears.  \n \nAnd success on all these fronts requires sustained \nengagement, but it will also require resources.  I know that \nforeign aid is one of the least popular expenditures that there \nis.  That’s true for Democrats and Republicans -- I’ve seen the \npolling -- even though it amounts to less than one percent of \nthe federal budget.  In fact, a lot of folks think it’s 25 \npercent, if you ask people on the streets.  Less than one \nEx. 2 - 11\n\npercent -- still wildly unpopular.  But foreign assistance \ncannot be viewed as charity.  It is fundamental to our national \nsecurity.  And it’s fundamental to any sensible long-term \nstrategy to battle extremism.   \nMoreover, foreign assistance is a tiny fraction of what we \nspend fighting wars that our assistance might ultimately \nprevent. For what we spent in a month in Iraq at the height of \nthe war, we could be training security forces in Libya, \nmaintaining peace agreements between Israel and its neighbors, \nfeeding the hungry in Yemen, building schools in Pakistan, and \ncreating reservoirs of goodwill that marginalize \nextremists.  That has to be part of our strategy. \nMoreover, America cannot carry out this work if we don’t \nhave diplomats serving in some very dangerous places.  Over the \npast decade, we have strengthened security at our embassies, and \nI am implementing every recommendation of the Accountability \nReview Board, which found unacceptable failures in \nBenghazi.  I’ve called on Congress to fully fund these efforts \nto bolster security and harden facilities, improve intelligence, \nand facilitate a quicker response time from our military if a \ncrisis emerges.  \nBut even after we take these steps, some irreducible risks \nto our diplomats will remain.  This is the price of being the \nworld’s most powerful nation, particularly as a wave of change \nwashes over the Arab World.  And in balancing the trade4offs \nbetween security and active diplomacy, I firmly believe that any \nretreat from challenging regions will only increase the dangers \nthat we face in the long run.  And that's why we should be \n \ngrateful to those diplomats who are willing to serve.  \nTargeted action against terrorists, effective partnerships, \ndiplomatic engagement and assistance -- through such a \ncomprehensive strategy we can significantly reduce the chances \nof large-scale attacks on the homeland and mitigate threats to \nAmericans overseas.  But as we guard against dangers from \nabroad, we cannot neglect the daunting challenge of terrorism \nfrom within our borders.  \nAs I said earlier, this threat is not new.  But technology \nand the Internet increase its frequency and in some cases its \nlethality.  Today, a person can consume hateful propaganda, \ncommit themselves to a violent agenda, and learn how to kill \nwithout leaving their home.  To address this threat, two years \nago my administration did a comprehensive review and engaged \nwith law enforcement.   \nEx. 2 - 12\n\nAnd the best way to prevent violent extremism inspired by \nviolent jihadists is to work with the Muslim American \ncommunity  -- which has consistently rejected terrorism -- to \nidentify signs of radicalization and partner with law \nenforcement when an individual is drifting towards \nviolence.  And these partnerships can only work when we \nrecognize that Muslims are a fundamental part of the American \nfamily.  In fact, the success of American Muslims and our \ndetermination to guard against any encroachments on their civil \nliberties is the ultimate rebuke to those who say that we’re at \nwar with Islam.  \nThwarting homegrown plots presents particular challenges in \npart because of our proud commitment to civil liberties for all \nwho call America home.  That’s why, in the years to come, we \nwill have to keep working hard to strike the appropriate balance \nbetween our need for security and preserving those freedoms that \nmake us who we are.  That means reviewing the authorities of law \nenforcement, so we can intercept new types of communication, but \nalso build in privacy protections to prevent abuse. \n \nThat means that -- even after Boston -- we do not deport \nsomeone or throw somebody in prison in the absence of \nevidence.  That means putting careful constraints on the tools \nthe government uses to protect sensitive information, such as \nthe state secrets doctrine.  And that means finally having a \nstrong Privacy and Civil Liberties Board to review those issues \nwhere our counterterrorism efforts and our values may come into \ntension. \n \nThe Justice Department’s investigation of national security \nleaks offers a recent example of the challenges involved in \nstriking the right balance between our security and our open \nsociety.  As Commander-in-Chief, I believe we must keep \ninformation secret that protects our operations and our people \nin the field.  To do so, we must enforce consequences for those \nwho break the law and breach their commitment to protect \nclassified information.  But a free press is also essential for \nour democracy.  That’s who we are.  And I’m troubled by the \npossibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative \njournalism that holds government accountable. \n \nJournalists should not be at legal risk for doing their \njobs.  Our focus must be on those who break the law.  And that’s \nwhy I’ve called on Congress to pass a media shield law to guard \nagainst government overreach.  And I’ve raised these issues with \nthe Attorney General, who shares my concerns.  So he has agreed \nEx. 2 - 13\n\nto review existing Department of Justice guidelines governing \ninvestigations that involve reporters, and he’ll convene a group \nof media organizations to hear their concerns as part of that \nreview.  And I’ve directed the Attorney General to report back \nto me by July 12th.  \nNow, all these issues remind us that the choices we make \nabout war can impact -- in sometimes unintended ways -- the \nopenness and freedom on which our way of life depends.  And that \nis why I intend to engage Congress about the existing \nAuthorization to Use Military Force, or AUMF, to determine how \nwe can continue to fight terrorism without keeping America on a \nperpetual wartime footing.  \nThe AUMF is now nearly 12 years old.  The Afghan war is \ncoming to an end.  Core al Qaeda is a shell of its former \nself.  Groups like AQAP must be dealt with, but in the years to \ncome, not every collection of thugs that labels themselves al \nQaeda will pose a credible threat to the United States.  Unless \nwe discipline our thinking, our definitions, our actions, we may \nbe drawn into more wars we don’t need to fight, or continue to \ngrant Presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional \narmed conflicts between nation states.   \nSo I look forward to engaging Congress and the American \npeople in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s \nmandate.  And I will not sign laws designed to expand this \nmandate further.  Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist \norganizations must continue.  But this war, like all wars, must \nend.  That’s what history advises.  That’s what our democracy \ndemands.  \nAnd that brings me to my final topic:  the detention of \nterrorist suspects.  I’m going to repeat one more time:  As a \nmatter of policy, the preference of the United States is to \ncapture terrorist suspects.  When we do detain a suspect, we \ninterrogate them.  And if the suspect can be prosecuted, we \ndecide whether to try him in a civilian court or a military \ncommission.   \nDuring the past decade, the vast majority of those detained \nby our military were captured on the battlefield.  In Iraq, we \nturned over thousands of prisoners as we ended the war.  In \nAfghanistan, we have transitioned detention facilities to the \nAfghans, as part of the process of restoring Afghan sovereignty. \nSo we bring law of war detention to an end, and we are committed \nto prosecuting terrorists wherever we can.  \nEx. 2 - 14\n\nThe glaring exception to this time-tested approach is the \ndetention center at Guantanamo Bay.  The original premise for \nopening GTMO -- that detainees would not be able to challenge \ntheir detention -- was found unconstitutional five years \nago.  In the meantime, GTMO has become a symbol around the world \nfor an America that flouts the rule of law.  Our allies won’t \ncooperate with us if they think a terrorist will end up at \nGTMO.   \nDuring a time of budget cuts, we spend $150 million each \nyear to imprison 166 people -- almost $1 million per \nprisoner.  And the Department of Defense estimates that we must \nspend another $200 million to keep GTMO open at a time when \nwe’re cutting investments in education and research here at \nhome, and when the Pentagon is struggling with sequester and \nbudget cuts.  \nAs President, I have tried to close GTMO.  I transferred 67 \ndetainees to other countries before Congress imposed \nrestrictions to effectively prevent us from either transferring \ndetainees to other countries or imprisoning them here in the \nUnited States.   \n \nThese restrictions make no sense.  After all, under \nPresident Bush, some 530 detainees were transferred from GTMO \nwith Congress’s support.  When I ran for President the first \ntime, John McCain supported closing GTMO -- this was a \nbipartisan issue.  No person has ever escaped one of our super-\nmax or military prisons here in the United States -- ever.  Our \ncourts have convicted hundreds of people for terrorism or \nterrorism-related offenses, including some folks who are more \ndangerous than most GTMO detainees.  They're in our prisons.   \n \nAnd given my administration’s relentless pursuit of al \nQaeda’s leadership, there is no justification beyond politics \nfor Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should \nhave never have been opened.  (Applause.)  \n \n     AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Excuse me, President Obama --   \nTHE PRESIDENT:  So -- let me finish, ma'am.  So today, once \nagain -- \nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  There are 102 people on a hunger \nstrike.  These are desperate people.   \nTHE PRESIDENT:  I'm about to address it, ma'am, but you've \ngot to let me speak.  I'm about to address it. \nEx. 2 - 15\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  You're our Commander-In-Chief --  \nTHE PRESIDENT:  Let me address it. \nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  -- you an close Guantanamo Bay.   \nTHE PRESIDENT:  Why don’t you let me address it, ma'am. \nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  There’s still prisoners -- \nTHE PRESIDENT:  Why don’t you sit down and I will tell you \nexactly what I'm going to do. \nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  That includes 57 Yemenis.  \nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, ma'am.  Thank \nyou.  (Applause.)  Ma'am, thank you.  You should let me finish \nmy sentence.   \nToday, I once again call on Congress to lift the \nrestrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO.  (Applause.)   \nI have asked the Department of Defense to designate a site \nin the United States where we can hold military \ncommissions.  I’m appointing a new senior envoy at the State \nDepartment and Defense Department whose sole responsibility will \nbe to achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries.   \nI am lifting the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen \nso we can review them on a case-by-case basis.  To the greatest \nextent possible, we will transfer detainees who have been \ncleared to go to other countries.   \nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  -- prisoners already.  Release them \ntoday. \nTHE PRESIDENT:  Where appropriate, we will bring terrorists \nto justice in our courts and our military justice system.  And \nwe will insist that judicial review be available for every \ndetainee. \nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  It needs to be -- \nTHE PRESIDENT:  Now, ma'am, let me finish.  Let me finish, \nma'am.  Part of free speech is you being able to speak, but \n  \nalso, you listening and me being able to speak.  (Applause.)\nNow, even after we take these steps one issue will remain -\n- just how to deal with those GTMO detainees who we know have \nparticipated in dangerous plots or attacks but who cannot be \nprosecuted, for example, because the evidence against them has \nEx. 2 - 16\n\nbeen compromised or is inadmissible in a court of law.  But once \nwe commit to a process of closing GTMO, I am confident that this \nlegacy problem can be resolved, consistent with our commitment \n \nto the rule of law.  \n     I know the politics are hard.  But history will cast a \nharsh judgment on this aspect of our fight against terrorism and \nthose of us who fail to end it.  Imagine a future -- 10 years \nfrom now or 20 years from now -- when the United States of \nAmerica is still holding people who have been charged with no \ncrime on a piece of land that is not part of our country.  Look \nat the current situation, where we are force-feeding detainees \nwho are being held on a hunger strike.  I'm willing to cut the \nyoung lady who interrupted me some slack because it's worth \nbeing passionate about.  Is this who we are?  Is that something \nour Founders foresaw?  Is that the America we want to leave our \nchildren?  Our sense of justice is stronger than that.   \n \nWe have prosecuted scores of terrorists in our \ncourts.  That includes Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to \nblow up an airplane over Detroit; and Faisal Shahzad, who put a \ncar bomb in Times Square. It's in a court of law that we will \ntry Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of bombing the Boston \nMarathon.  Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, is, as we speak, \nserving a life sentence in a maximum security prison here in the \nUnited States.  In sentencing Reid, Judge William Young told \nhim, “The way we treat you…is the measure of our own liberties.” \n   \nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  How about Abdulmutallab -- locking up a \n16-year-old -- is that the way we treat a 16-year \nold?  (Inaudible) -- can you take the drones out of the hands of \nthe CIA?  Can you stop the signature strikes killing people on \nthe basis of suspicious activities? \n     THE PRESIDENT:  We’re addressing that, ma’am.   \n \n     AUDIENCE MEMBER:  -- thousands of Muslims that got killed -\n- will you compensate the innocent families -- that will make us \nsafer here at home.  I love my country.  I love (inaudible) --  \n \n     THE PRESIDENT:  I think that -- and I’m going off script, \nas you might expect here.  (Laughter and applause.)  The voice \nof that woman is worth paying attention \nto.  (Applause.)  Obviously, I do not agree with much of what \nshe said, and obviously she wasn’t listening to me in much of \nwhat I said.  But these are tough issues, and the suggestion \nthat we can gloss over them is wrong.  \n \nEx. 2 - 17\n\n     When that judge sentenced Mr. Reid, the shoe bomber, he \nwent on to point to the American flag that flew in the \ncourtroom.  “That flag,” he said, “will fly there long after \nthis is all forgotten.  That flag still stands for freedom.”  \n \nSo, America, we’ve faced down dangers far greater than al \nQaeda.  By staying true to the values of our founding, and by \nusing our constitutional compass, we have overcome slavery and \nCivil War and fascism and communism.  In just these last few \nyears as President, I’ve watched the American people bounce back \nfrom painful recession, mass shootings, natural disasters like \nthe recent tornados that devastated Oklahoma.  These events were \nheartbreaking; they shook our communities to the core.  But \nbecause of the resilience of the American people, these events \ncould not come close to breaking us. \n \nI think of Lauren Manning, the 9/11 survivor who had severe \nburns over 80 percent of her body, who said, “That’s my reality. \nI put a Band-Aid on it, literally, and I move on.”  \nI think of the New Yorkers who filled Times Square the day \nafter an attempted car bomb as if nothing had happened. \nI think of the proud Pakistani parents who, after their \ndaughter was invited to the White House, wrote to us, “We have \nraised an American Muslim daughter to dream big and never give \nup because it does pay off.” \n \nI think of all the wounded warriors rebuilding their lives, \nand helping other vets to find jobs. \n \nI think of the runner planning to do the 2014 Boston \nMarathon, who said, “Next year, you’re going to have more people \nthan ever.  Determination is not something to be messed with.” \nThat’s who the American people are -- determined, and not \nto be messed with.  And now we need a strategy and a politics \nthat reflects this resilient spirit.   \nOur victory against terrorism won’t be measured in a \nsurrender ceremony at a battleship, or a statue being pulled to \nthe ground.  Victory will be measured in parents taking their \nkids to school; immigrants coming to our shores; fans taking in \na ballgame; a veteran starting a business; a bustling city \nstreet; a citizen shouting her concerns at a President.     \nThe quiet determination; that strength of character and \nbond of fellowship; that refutation of fear -- that is both our \nEx. 2 - 18\n\nsword and our shield.  And long after the current messengers of \nhate have faded from the world’s memory, alongside the brutal \ndespots, and deranged madmen, and ruthless demagogues who litter \nhistory  -- the flag of the United States will still wave from \nsmall-town cemeteries to national monuments, to distant outposts \nabroad.  And that flag will still stand for freedom. \nThank you very, everybody.  God bless you.  May God bless \nthe United States of America.  (Applause.)  \n \n \n                   END                3:00 P.M. EDT \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n----- \n \nEx. 2 - 19",

Since 2001, and routinely since 2009, the United States has carried out \ndeliberate and premeditated killings of suspected terrorists overseas.  The U.S. practice of \n“targeted killing” has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, including many \nhundreds of civilian bystanders.  While some targeted killings have been carried out in \nthe context of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, many have taken place outside the \ncontext of armed conflict, in countries including Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan, Sudan, and \nthe Philippines.  These killings rely on vague legal standards, a closed executive process, \nand evidence never presented to the courts.  This case concerns the role of Defendants \nLeon C. Panetta, William H. McRaven, Joseph Votel, and David H. Petraeus \n(collectively, “Defendants”) in authorizing and directing the killing of three American \ncitizens in Yemen last year.  The killings violated fundamental rights afforded to all U.S. \ncitizens, including the right not to be deprived of life without due process of law. \n2.  In late 2009 or early 2010, Anwar Al-Aulaqi, an American citizen, was added \nto “kill lists” maintained by the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) and the Joint \nSpecial Operations Command (“JSOC”), a component of the Department of Defense \n(“DOD”).  On September 30, 2011, unmanned CIA and JSOC drones fired missiles at \nAnwar Al-Aulaqi and his vehicle, killing him and at least three other people, including \nSamir Khan, another American citizen.  Defendants authorized and directed their \nsubordinates to carry out the strike.   \n  2 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-01192-RMC   Document 3   Filed 07/18/12   Page 3 of 17\n3.  On October 14, 2011, Defendants authorized and directed another drone strike \nin Yemen, this one approximately 200 miles away from the strike that had killed Anwar \nAl-Aulaqi and Samir Khan two weeks earlier.  The October 14 strike killed at least seven \npeople at an open-air restaurant, including two children.  One of the children was 16-\nyear-old Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi, who was Anwar Al-Aulaqi’s son and also an American \ncitizen.     \n4.  Defendants’ killing of Anwar Al-Aulaqi was unlawful.  At the time of the \nkilling, the United States was not engaged in an armed conflict with or within Yemen.  \nOutside the context of armed conflict, both the United States Constitution and \ninternational human rights law prohibit the use of lethal force unless, at the time it is \napplied, lethal force is a last resort to protect against a concrete, specific, and imminent \nthreat of death or serious physical injury.  Upon information and belief, Anwar Al-Aulaqi \nwas not engaged in activities that presented such a threat, and the use of lethal force \nagainst him was not a last resort.  Even in the context of an armed conflict, the law of war \ncabins the government’s authority to use lethal force and prohibits killing civilians who \nare not directly participating in hostilities.  The concept of “direct participation” requires \nboth a causal and temporal nexus to hostilities.  Upon information and belief, Defendants \ndirected and authorized the killing of Anwar Al-Aulaqi even though he was not then \ndirectly participating in hostilities within the meaning of the law of war.   \n5.  Defendants’ killing of Samir Khan and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi was also \nunlawful.  Upon information and belief, neither Samir Khan nor Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi \nwas engaged in any activity that presented a concrete, specific, and imminent threat to \nlife; nor was either of them directly participating in hostilities.  The news media have \n  3 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-01192-RMC   Document 3   Filed 07/18/12   Page 4 of 17\nreported, based on statements attributed to anonymous U.S. government officials, that \nSamir Khan was not the target of the September 30 strike and that Abdulrahman Al-\nAulaqi was not the target of the October 14 strike.  If the Defendants were targeting \nothers, they had an obligation under the Constitution and international human rights law \nto take measures to prevent harm to Samir Khan, Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi, and other \nbystanders.  Even in the context of an armed conflict, government officials must comply \nwith the requirements of distinction and proportionality and take all feasible measures to \nprotect bystanders.  Upon information and belief, Samir Khan and Abdulrahman Al-\nAulaqi were killed because Defendants failed to take such measures.   \n6.  Plaintiffs are the personal representatives of the estates of Anwar Al-Aulaqi, \nSamir Khan, and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi.  They seek damages from Defendants for their \nrole in authorizing and directing the killings of Plaintiffs’ sons and grandson in violation \nof the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and the Bill of Attainder Clause. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This complaint is for compensatory damages resulting from the conduct of \nDefendants, all of them U.S. government officials, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth \nAmendments and the Bill of Attainder Clause. \n8.  This Court has jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n(federal question) and the U.S. Constitution. \n9.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). \nPARTIES \n10.  Plaintiff Nasser Al-Aulaqi is the father of Anwar Al-Aulaqi and the \ngrandfather of Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi.  He is a citizen and resident of Yemen.  He \n  4 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-01192-RMC   Document 3   Filed 07/18/12   Page 5 of 17\nbrings this suit as the personal representative of the estates of his son and grandson, \nAmerican citizens who were killed by missile strikes authorized and directed by \nDefendants.    \n11.  Plaintiff Sarah Khan, an American citizen, is the mother of Samir Khan.  She \nbrings this suit as the personal representative of the estate of her son, an American citizen \nwho was killed by missile strikes authorized and directed by Defendants.   \n12.  Defendant Leon C. Panetta is the Secretary of Defense, a post he has held \nsince July 2011.  As Defense Secretary, he has ultimate authority over U.S. armed forces \nworldwide, including over JSOC.  He authorized Anwar Al-Aulaqi’s continued \nplacement on JSOC’s kill list after July 2011 and authorized and directed the missile \nstrikes that killed Anwar Al-Aulaqi, Samir Khan, and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi.  Between \nFebruary 2009 and June 2011, Defendant Panetta was the Director of the CIA.  As CIA \nDirector, he authorized the addition of Anwar Al-Aulaqi to the CIA’s kill list.  He is sued \nin his individual capacity. \n13.  Defendant William H. McRaven is Commander of the U.S. Special \nOperations Command (“USSOCOM”), a post he has held since August 2011.  As \nCommander of USSOCOM, Defendant McRaven has authority over JSOC, a subordinate \nunified command within USSOCOM.  He authorized and directed the missile strikes that \nkilled Anwar Al-Aulaqi, Samir Khan, and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi.  Between June 2008 \nand June 2011, he was the Commander of JSOC.  In that capacity, he authorized the \naddition of Anwar Al-Aulaqi to JSOC’s kill list.  He is sued in his individual capacity. \n14.  Defendant Joseph Votel is the Commander of JSOC, a post he has held since \nJune 2011.  As Commander of JSOC, he has authority over JSOC operations.  He \n  5 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-01192-RMC   Document 3   Filed 07/18/12   Page 6 of 17\nauthorized and directed the missile strikes that killed Anwar Al-Aulaqi, Samir Khan, and \nAbdulrahman Al-Aulaqi.  He is sued in his individual capacity. \n15.  Defendant David H. Petraeus is the Director of the CIA, a post he has held \nsince September 2011.  As CIA Director, he has ultimate authority over the CIA’s \noperations worldwide.  He authorized and directed the missile strikes that killed Anwar \nAl-Aulaqi, Samir Khan, and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi.  He is sued in his individual \ncapacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n“Targeted Killings” by the United States \n16.  The first reported post-2001 targeted killing by the U.S. government outside \nAfghanistan occurred in Yemen in November 2002, when a CIA-operated Predator drone \nfired a missile at a terrorism suspect traveling in a car with other passengers.  The strike \nkilled all passengers in the vehicle, including an American citizen.  The United Nations \nSpecial Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions later stated that \nthe strike constituted “a clear case of extrajudicial killing” and set an “alarming \nprecedent.”   \n17.  Since 2002, the United States has continued to carry out targeted killings \noutside the context of armed conflict.  The pace of these killings has increased \ndramatically since 2009.  In the course of carrying out these killings, the government has \nkilled many hundreds of civilian bystanders.  In December 2009, a U.S. missile strike in \nthe village of al-Majalah, Yemen, killed 41 people, including 21 children.     \n18.  In April 2012, Deputy National Security Advisor John Brennan acknowledged \npublicly that the United States carries out targeted killings of suspected terrorists “beyond \n  6 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-01192-RMC   Document 3   Filed 07/18/12   Page 7 of 17\nhot battlefields like Afghanistan,” often using “remotely piloted aircraft” known as \n“drones.”  Both the CIA and JSOC are involved in authorizing, planning, and carrying \nout these killings; both the CIA and JSOC have carried out such killings in Yemen; and, \naccording to a December 2011 report in the Washington Post and other news sources, the \nCIA and JSOC “share intelligence and coordinate attacks.”  Greg Miller, Under Obama, \nan Emerging Global Apparatus for Drone Killing, Wash. Post, Dec. 27, 2011. \n19.  Both the CIA and JSOC maintain “kill lists” setting out the names of the \nindividuals they intend to kill.  See Jo Becker & Scott Shane, Secret ‘Kill List’ Proves a \nTest of Obama’s Principles and Will, N.Y. Times, May 29, 2012.  Upon information and \nbelief, the inclusion of an individual on one or both of the lists represents a standing order \nauthorizing and directing certain government personnel to kill that individual.  In a \nFebruary 2011 interview with Newsweek, the CIA’s former acting general counsel John \nRizzo described the CIA’s list as “basically a hit list.”  He stated that there are \napproximately 30 individuals on the list “at any given time,” and that “[t]he Predator \n[drone] is the weapon of choice, but it could also be someone putting a bullet in your \nhead.”  Tara McKelvey, Inside the Killing Machine, Newsweek, Feb. 13, 2011. \n20.  Senior government officials, including then-Director of National Intelligence \nDennis Blair and Deputy National Security Advisor John Brennan, have made clear that \nthe government’s claimed authority to carry out the targeted killing of suspected \nterrorists, including killings executed outside the context of armed conflict, extends to \nAmerican citizens.  However, government officials have offered incomplete and \ninconsistent explanations of the legal standards that govern the placement of U.S. citizens \non the kill lists.  Some officials have suggested that the U.S. government targets its \n  7 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-01192-RMC   Document 3   Filed 07/18/12   Page 8 of 17\ncitizens only if they present “imminent” threats, but they have defined the term \n“imminent” so broadly as to negate its meaning.    \nDefendants’ Decision to Authorize the Killing of Anwar Al-Aulaqi \n21.  Plaintiff Nasser Al-Aulaqi is a Yemeni citizen who moved to the United \nStates in 1966 to study as a Fulbright scholar at New Mexico State University.  He and \nhis wife lived in the United States until 1978, when they moved back to Yemen.  In \nYemen, he served as Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and president of Sana’a \nUniversity, and founded and served as president of Ibb University.  He currently resides \nin Yemen with his wife, who is an American citizen, and their family. \n22.  Plaintiff Nasser Al-Aulaqi’s son, Anwar, was born in 1971 in New Mexico.  \nHe moved to Yemen with his parents in 1978.  In 1991, he returned to the United States \nto attend college at Colorado State University.  He obtained his master’s degree from San \nDiego State University and then enrolled in a Ph.D. program at George Washington \nUniversity, which he attended through December 2001.  While living in the United \nStates, he married and had children, including Abdulrahman.  He left the United States in \n2003, first for the United Kingdom and then for Yemen. \n23.  In January 2010, the Washington Post reported that JSOC had added Anwar \nAl-Aulaqi to its kill list and had tried unsuccessfully to kill him in December 2009.  Dana \nPriest, U.S. Military Teams, Intelligence Deeply Involved in Aiding Yemen on Strikes, \nWash. Post, Jan. 27, 2010.  Other media organizations reported the same information.  In \nMarch 2010, the Wall Street Journal reported that then-CIA Director Defendant Panetta \nstated that Anwar Al-Aulaqi was “someone that we’re looking for” and that “there isn’t \nany question that he’s one of the individuals that we’re focusing on.”  Keith Johnson, \n  8 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-01192-RMC   Document 3   Filed 07/18/12   Page 9 of 17\nU.S. Seeks Cleric Backing Jihad, Wall St. J., Mar. 26, 2010.  In April 2010, multiple \nmedia organizations, including the Washington Post, reported that Anwar Al-Aulaqi had \nbeen added to the CIA’s kill list.  See Greg Miller, Muslim Cleric Aulaqi Is 1st U.S. \nCitizen on List of Those CIA Is Allowed To Kill, Wash. Post, Apr. 7, 2010. \n24.  The decision to add Anwar Al-Aulaqi to government kill lists was made after \na closed executive process.  Defendant Panetta participated in this process, and upon \ninformation and belief Defendant McRaven participated in this process as well.  Upon \ninformation and belief, Defendants authorized and directed Anwar Al-Aulaqi’s killing \neven though, at the time lethal force was used, Anwar Al-Aulaqi was not engaged in \nactivities that presented a concrete, specific, and imminent threat to life, and even though \nthere were means short of lethal force that could reasonably have been used to address \nany such threat.  Upon information and belief, Defendants authorized and directed Anwar \nAl-Aulaqi’s killing even though he was not then directly participating in hostilities within \nthe meaning of the law of war. \n25.  In or around June 2010, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel \ncompleted a memorandum providing legal justifications for the killing of Anwar Al-\nAulaqi.  Substantial portions of the memorandum were summarized in October 2011 by \nthe New York Times, which reported, based on conversations with individuals who had \nread the document, that the memorandum “provided the justification for acting [against \nAnwar Al-Aulaqi] despite an executive order banning assassinations, a federal law \nagainst murder, protections in the Bill of Rights and various strictures of the international \nlaws of war.”  Charlie Savage, Secret U.S. Memo Made Legal Case to Kill a Citizen, \nN.Y. Times, Oct. 8, 2011. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-01192-RMC   Document 3   Filed 07/18/12   Page 10 of 17\n26.  Between the time Anwar Al-Aulaqi was added to the JSOC and CIA kill lists \nand the time he was killed, government officials told reporters that Al-Aulaqi had “cast \nhis lot” with terrorist groups and encouraged others to engage in terrorist activity.  Later, \nthey claimed he had played “a key role in setting the strategic direction” for “Al Qaeda in \nthe Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).”  The government never publicly indicted Anwar Al-\nAulaqi for any crime.  \nNasser Al-Aulaqi’s Lawuit to Enjoin the Government from Killing His Son \n27.  On August 30, 2010, Nasser Al-Aulaqi filed suit in this Court as next friend of \nhis son, Anwar, asking that the Court enter an injunction barring the President, the CIA, \nand DOD (including JSOC) from carrying out the targeted killing of his son unless the \nexecutive concluded that he presented a concrete, specific, and imminent threat to life, \nand that there were no reasonably available measures short of lethal force that could be \nexpected to address that threat.  After hearing argument on November 8, 2010, the Court \ndismissed the Complaint on December 7, 2010, holding that Nasser Al-Aulaqi lacked \nstanding to assert his son’s constitutional rights and that at least some of the issues raised \nby the Complaint were non-justiciable political questions.  No appeal was taken. \nSamir Khan \n28.  Plaintiff Sarah Khan is a U.S. citizen who has lived in the United States since \n1992 with her husband and children.  Her son, Samir, was born in 1985 and became a \nU.S. citizen in 1998.   \n29.  Samir Khan attended elementary school in Queens, New York, and high \nschool on Long Island, New York.  After graduating from high school in 2003, he moved \n  10 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-01192-RMC   Document 3   Filed 07/18/12   Page 11 of 17\nto North Carolina, where he attended a community college and worked part-time.  He left \nfor Yemen in October 2009.   \n30.  Anonymous government officials have told reporters that Samir Khan was a \n“propagandist” for AQAP.  The government never publicly indicted him for any crime.  \nThe September 30, 2011 Killing of Anwar Al-Aulaqi and Samir Khan \n31.  On the morning of September 30, 2011, Anwar Al-Aulaqi and Samir Khan \nwere in the Yemeni province of al-Jawf, some 90 miles northeast of Sana’a.  Upon \ninformation and belief, Defendants Panetta, McRaven, Votel, and Petraeus authorized \nand directed personnel under their command to fire missiles at Anwar Al-Aulaqi and his \nvehicle from unmanned U.S. drones.  The missiles destroyed the vehicle and killed \nAnwar Al-Aulaqi, Samir Khan, and at least two others.  Witnesses reported that the \nmissile strike left the vehicle a “charred husk” and “tore the [victims’] bodies to pieces.”  \nDominic Rushe, et al., Anwar al-Awlaki Death: US Keeps Role Under Wraps to Manage \nYemen Fallout, Guardian, Sept. 30, 2011; Sudarsan Raghavan, Awlaqi Hit Misses al-\nQaeda Bombmaker, Yemen Says, Wash. Post, Sept 30, 2011.  According to a September \n30, 2011 article in the Washington Post and a June 2012 book by journalist Daniel \nKlaidman, personnel under Defendants’ command had been surveilling Anwar Al-Aulaqi \nfor a period as long as three weeks leading up to the strike.  Greg Miller, Strike on Aulaqi \nDemonstrates Collaboration Between CIA and Military, Wash. Post, Sept. 30, 2011; \nDaniel Klaidman, Kill or Capture (2012).  Defendants’ lengthy surveillance suggests that \nthe use of lethal force was not a last resort and that additional measures could have been \ntaken to protect bystanders from harm.     \n  11 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-01192-RMC   Document 3   Filed 07/18/12   Page 12 of 17\n32.  The surveillance and the strike were carried out by the CIA and JSOC.  Upon \ninformation and belief, Defendant Petraeus was personally responsible for authorizing \nand directing the CIA’s involvement in the September 30 strike, and Defendants Panetta, \nMcRaven, and Votel were personally responsible for authorizing and directing JSOC’s \ninvolvement in it.  Defendants coordinated with each other in planning the attack and \ncarrying it out.  \n33.  Senior government officials, including Defendant Panetta and President \nBarack Obama, have acknowledged the responsibility of the United States for killing \nAnwar Al-Aulaqi.  On the same day the strike was carried out, DOD published a news \narticle stating that “[a] U.S. airstrike . . . killed . . . Anwar [Al-Aulaqi] early this \nmorning” and that he had been “high on the military-intelligence list of terrorist targets.”  \nLisa Daniel, Panetta: Awlaki Airstrike Shows U.S.-Yemeni Cooperation, Am. Forces \nPress Service, Sept. 30, 2011.  The following day, Defendant Panetta stated in a public \nspeech that “it is because of th[e] teamwork between our intelligence and our military \ncommunities that we were successful in . . . taking down al-Awlaki.”  Three weeks later, \nPresident Obama stated on national television that “working with the Yemenis, we were \nable to remove [Anwar Al-Aulaqi] from the field.”  Tonight Show with Jay Leno (NBC \ntelevision broadcast Oct. 25, 2011). \n34.  Defendants’ killing of Anwar Al-Aulaqi was unlawful.  Upon information and \nbelief, Defendants authorized and directed the strike even though, at the time the strike \nwas carried out, Anwar Al-Aulaqi was not engaged in activities that presented a concrete, \nspecific, and imminent threat of death or serious physical injury.  Upon information and \nbelief, Defendants authorized and directed the strike even though there were means short \n  12 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-01192-RMC   Document 3   Filed 07/18/12   Page 13 of 17\nof lethal force that could reasonably have been used to neutralize any threat that Anwar \nAl-Aulaqi’s activities may have presented.  The killing of Anwar Al-Aulaqi was unlawful \neven if analyzed under the law of war because, upon information and belief, Defendants \nauthorized and directed the strike even though Anwar Al-Aulaqi was not then directly \nparticipating in hostilities within the meaning of the law of war.       \n35.  Defendants’ killing of Samir Khan was also unlawful.  Samir Khan was not \nengaged in any activity that presented a concrete, specific, and imminent threat of death \nor serious physical injury; nor was he directly participating in hostilities.  If he was killed \nbecause of the government’s targeting of Anwar al-Aulaqi, his killing was unlawful \nbecause Al-Aulaqi’s killing was unlawful and because, upon information and belief, \nDefendants authorized and directed the strike without taking legally required measures to \navoid harm to bystanders.  Even in the context of an armed conflict, government officials \nmust comply with the requirements of distinction and proportionality and take all feasible \nmeasures to protect bystanders.  Upon information and belief, Samir Khan was killed \nbecause Defendants failed to take such measures. \nThe October 14, 2011 Killing of Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi \n36.  Plaintiff Nasser Al-Aulaqi’s grandson, Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi, was born in \nDenver, Colorado, on August 26, 1995.  He was raised in the United States until 2002, \nwhen he moved with his family to Yemen.  At the time of his death, he was a student in \nhis first year of high school and resided in Sana’a, Yemen, with his mother, siblings, \ngrandmother, and grandfather. \n37.  On October 14, 2011, Abdulrahman was at an open-air restaurant near the \ntown of Azzan, in the southern Yemeni province of Shabwa.  Upon information and \n  13 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-01192-RMC   Document 3   Filed 07/18/12   Page 14 of 17\nbelief, Defendants Panetta, McRaven, Votel, and Petraeus authorized and directed \npersonnel under their command to fire missiles from unmanned U.S. drones at a person at \nor near the restaurant.  According to media sources, the intended target was Ibraham Al-\nBanna, an Egyptian national, but it was later reported that he was not among those killed \nby the strike.  See Gregory Johnsen, Signature Strikes in Yemen, Waq al-Waq, Apr. 19, \n2012.  The strike killed at least seven people, including Abdulrahman and one of his \ncousins, another minor.  Abdulrahman himself was 16 years old. \n38.  After the strike, a senior Obama administration official described \nAbdulrahman to the Los Angeles Times as a “military-aged male.”  Ken Dilanian, \nGrieving Awlaki Family Protests Yemen Drone Strikes, L.A. Times, Oct. 19, 2011.  Other \nnews sources described Abdulrahman as a militant in his twenties.  To correct these \nerroneous descriptions, Abdulrahman’s family provided his birth certificate to the \nWashington Post.  After the Washington Post published the birth certificate, U.S. officials \nacknowledged in anonymous statements to the press that Abdulrahman had been a minor. \n39.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Panetta was personally responsible \nfor authorizing and directing the CIA’s involvement in the October 14 strike, and \nDefendants Petraeus, McRaven, and Votel were personally responsible for authorizing \nand directing JSOC’s involvement in the October 14 strike.  Defendants coordinated with \neach other in planning the attack and carrying it out.   \n40.  The killing of Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi was unlawful.  Abdulrahman was not \nengaged in any activity that presented a concrete, specific, and imminent threat of death \nor serious physical injury; nor was he directly participating in hostilities.  If he was killed \nbecause the government was targeting another individual, his killing was unlawful \n  14 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-01192-RMC   Document 3   Filed 07/18/12   Page 15 of 17\nbecause, upon information and belief, Defendants authorized and directed the strike \nwithout taking legally required measures to avoid harm to him.  Even in the context of an \narmed conflict, the government must comply with the requirements of distinction and \nproportionality and take all feasible measures to protect bystanders.  Upon information \nand belief, Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi was killed because Defendants failed to take such \nmeasures. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nFirst Claim for Relief \nFifth Amendment: Due Process \n \n41.  Defendants’ actions described herein violated the substantive and procedural \ndue process rights of Anwar Al-Aulaqi, Samir Khan, and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi under \nthe Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.  Defendants Panetta, McRaven, Votel, and \nPetraeus violated the Fifth Amendment due process rights of Anwar al-Aulaqi, Samir \nKhan, and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi by authorizing and directing their subordinates to use \nlethal force against them in the circumstances described above.  The deaths of Anwar al-\nAulaqi, Samir Khan, and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi were a foreseeable result of \nDefendants’ actions and omissions. \nSecond Claim for Relief \nFourth Amendment: Unreasonable Seizure \n \n42.

The deaths of Anwar al-Aulaqi, \nSamir Khan, and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi were a foreseeable result of Defendants’ \nactions and omissions. \nThird Claim for Relief \nBill of Attainder  \n \n43.
