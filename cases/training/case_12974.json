    "summary": "<p>On 02/10/2010, a 22-year-old college student majoring in Middle Eastern studies filed this lawsuit in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), FBI officials with the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), and the Philadelphia Police Department (PDP) based on civil rights intrusions at the Philadelphia International Airport. Upon discovering English-Arabic flashcards (including several listing words like \"kidnap\" and \"bomb\") and materials critical of U.S. foreign policy during routine airport security screening, TSA briefly detained and searched the plaintiff; he was then taken into custody by Philadelphia police officers and held for several hours. Eventually, two FBI agents came and interrogated him for a half hour; he was then released without charges.</p><p>Represented by private attorneys, the national American Civil Liberties Union, and the Pennsylvania ACLU chapter, the plaintiff alleged violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments under Bivens, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 2671-2680. The federal government defendants moved to dismiss the complaint because of their qualified immunity from suit. The district court denied the motion and proceeded to discovery. </p><p>The federal defendants appealed the denial of their 12(b)(6) motion to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit [11-04292].  On December 24, 2013, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded back to the District Court with instructions to grant the defendants' motion to dismiss as to the Fourth and First Amendment claims. In an opinion by Judge McKee [738 F.3d 562], TSA personnel's brief detention of the plaintiff was held lawful.  The FBI's brief interrogation was likewise not unconstitutional.  The local police's actions taking the plaintiff into custody and holding him for several hours may have been unlawful, but was not before the court; the court rejected the plaintiff's argument that the local law enforcement had served as mere agents for federal agencies.</p><p>On May 8, 2014, the District Court ordered a settlement conference before Magistrate Judge Caracappa. A pre-trial hearing was then conducted on October 30, 2014. Finally, on January 22, 2015 the court approved a settlement agreement and dismissed the case. The plaintiff received $25,000 in compensatory damages and attorney's fees up to $6,250. The defendants also agreed to, on a quarterly basis, instruct all police officers assigned to the airport that \"investigative detentions may be made only on reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct and any arrest must be based on probable cause\" and that a referral from a TSA agent does not, in itself, constitute probable cause. The court retained jurisdiction to supervise the injunction for eighteen months (until July 2016). </p><p>As of December 2018, no further docket activity occurred, and so the case is now closed. </p>",

On April9, 2010 Administrative Tort Claims were submitted by Plaintiffs \nto the Transpmiation Security Administration and the U.S. Depatiment of Justice Federal \nBureau of Investigation.  The claims were both denied on June 11,2010. \n15.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b) and \n1391(e). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n16.  On Saturday, August 29, 2009, PlaintiffNicholas George was scheduled \nto fly on Southwest Airlines from Philadelphia International Airport to Ontario \nInternational Airpmi in California, via Phoenix.  He was traveling to California in order \nto begin his senior year at Pomona College. \nArrival at Airpmi and Check-in \n17.  After Mr. George arrived at the airport, he waited in the line for check-in \nand, upon reaching the counter, he presented his identification and received a boarding \npass for his flight without incident.  He then proceeded to the security screening area. \n18.  Mr. George carried a single piece of carry-on luggage, a black athletic \nbag.  Inside the athletic bag were two small speakers (approximately 10 \" x 6\" x 6\") that \nhe intended to use with his stereo system in California. \n19.  As Mr. George approached the x-ray screening device, a TSA official-\nnot a defendant in this action-asked Mr. George to present his identification and \nboarding pass.  Mr. George complied.  The TSA official asked Mr. George what was \ninside his carry-on bag.  Mr. George responded that the bag contained his speakers.  The \nTSA official then asked Mr. George to step aside.  Mr. George complied.  The TSA \n5 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 6 of 22\nofficial asked Mr. George to remove the speakers, so that they could be passed through \nthe x-ray screening device separately.  Mr. George complied. \n20.  Mr. George placed his carry-on bag and his speakers on the belt.  He \nemptied his pockets of all items containing metal, including his wallet and cell phone, \nand took off his shoes.  These items were also placed on the belt to pass through the \nscreening device. \n21.  Mr. George stepped up to the metal detector.  He walked through the \nmetal detector without incident.  The detector made no sound. \n22.  The TSA official who was operating the metal detector-not a defendant \nin this action-nevertheless asked Mr. George to step aside and to wait.  This TSA \nofficial asked to see Mr. George's boarding pass.  Mr. George showed his boarding pass \nto the official.  There was a glass enclosure located next to the metal detector that was \nused for additional screening.  After this glass-enclosed screening area had been vacated \nby a previous passenger, the TSA official directed Mr. George to enter.  Mr. George \nstepped into the glass enclosure as directed. \n23.  Inside the glass enclosure another TSA official (Defendant John Doe 1) \nasked Mr. George to empty his pockets.  Mr. George had already emptied his pockets of \nany items containing metal, so among the only items remaining was a set of flashcards. \nMr. George handed the flashcards to the TSA official, as instructed. \nEnglish-Arabic Flashcards \n24.  Each flashcard had Arabic words on one side and English translations on \nthe other.  The flashcards were of the kind that would commonly be used by a person \n6 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 7 of 22\nstudying a foreign language.  Indeed, Mr. George used the flashcards as a tool for \nlearning Arabic vocabulary. \n25.  ·  Mr. George had been studying Arabic for three years, begilming in his first \nyear of college, in connection with his Middle-Eastern Studies major.  Mr. George had \nspent a semester in Jordan studying Arabic as part of a study abroad program organized \nby the Council on International Educational Exchange, a U.S. non-profit organization \nfounded in 1947.  He received credit at Pomona College for the courses he took in \nJordan.  Upon completing the program, he spent approximately five weeks traveling in \nEthiopia, Egypt, and Sudan-the latter two of which are Arabic-speaking countries-as a \ntourist and in order to practice his Arabic language skills. \n26.  Mr. George has a strong interest in the contemporary politics of the \nMiddle East, especially as they involve and affect the United States.  Mr. George sought \nto learn Arabic in order to be able to read and understand what was being repmied and \ndebated in contemporary Middle Eastern newspapers, television programs, and other \npublications or media. \nDetention by TSA Screeners \n27.  The TSA official to whom Mr. George handed the flashcards (Defendant \nJohn Doe 1) proceeded to inspect them.  The official did not make any cmmnent and did \nnot indicate that there was any kind of problem.  He nevertheless took Mr. George to a \ndifferent screening area.  Mr. George waited there while that TSA official and another \nTSA official (Defendant John Doe 2) further inspected his bag and the flashcards.  One of \nthese two TSA officials swabbed Mr. George's cell phone in order to run a test for \nexplosives.  The test returned a negative result.  The TSA officials found nothing among \n7 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 8 of 22\nMr. George's personal effects that posed a safety risk or was otherwise prohibited in the \n\"sterile\" area of the airport and aboard an airplane.  Indeed, Mr. George was not carrying \nany prohibited items or items that could pose a safety risk.  Nor was Mr. George carrying \nanything suggestive of criminal or otherwise prohibited activity. \n28.  It soon became apparent to Mr. George that the two TSA officials were \nstalling.  The TSA officials completed their search of Mr. George's carry-on items within \nten minutes.  One of the officials flipped through the pages of books that Mr. George had \namong his carry-on items.  He swabbed Mr. George's cell phone for a second time and \nhalf-heatiedly re-examined Mr. George's other cany-on items.  The official also \nattempted to make small talk, asking Mr. George if he had seen the recent Philadelphia \nPhillies baseball game.  After Mr. George responded in the affirmative and offered his \nopinion of the game, the TSA official admitted that he had not seen the game and did not \ngenerally watch the Phillies. \n29.  The other official stepped away and placed a phone call.  He was speaking \non the phone for some time.  Mr. George could not hear the call but believed that he \nmight have been speaking with a TSA supervisor.  On information and belief, the TSA \nofficial was speaking on the phone with a TSA supervisor or other official about Mr. \nGeorge's screening, including the English-Arabic flashcards. \n30.  The two TSA officials kept Mr. George in the side screening area for 30 \nminutes.  The TSA officials maintained Mr. George's prope1iy-including his wallet, \nidentification, passpmi, and boarding pass-in their custody.  At no point did the TSA \nofficials return, or offer to return, Mr. George's property to him.  During this period of \n8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 9 of 22\ntime Mr. George was detained by the TSA officials.  Mr. George was not free to leave \nand believed that he was not free to leave. \n31.  During this time, Mr. George became increasingly concerned that he \nwould miss his flight.  He asked the TSA officials how much longer he would have to \nwait and mentioned to the officials that his flight was leaving shmily. \n32.  The TSA officials did not explain to Mr. George why he could not proceed \nto the gate, nor did they explain to him the reason that he was being delayed and \ndetained. \nDetention and intenogation by TSA Supervisor \n33.  After 30 minutes, a TSA Supervisor arrived (Jane Doe 3).  The Supervisor \nimmediately began questioning Mr. George in a hostile and aggressive mmmer.  Mr. \nGeorge responded to all questions truthfully and to the best of his ability, in a polite and \ncalm manner. \n34.  The TSA Supervisor's questioning proceeded, in pmi, as follows (as best \nrecalled by Plaintiff): \nJane Doe 3:  How do you feel about 9/11? \n35.  Mr. George responded that he thought 9/11 was a terrible event. \n36.  At this point, the Supervisor noted that Mr. George had with him a book \nentitled \"Rogue Nation: American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions,\" by \nClyde Prestowitz, published by Basic Books in 2004.  The book has been described by \nGeneral Wesley Clark as \"a fascinating big picture look at America and its place in the \nworld [that] should help provoke the kind of discussion that we have long needed.\" \nJoseph Nye, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, has \n9 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 10 of 22\ndescribed the book as \"[a] conservative's sober warning of the dangers ofunilateralism \nand the temptations of empire.\" \n3 7.  After noticing the book, the TSA Supervisor continued her hostile and \naggressive questioning as follows: \nJane Doe 3:  You obviously read.  You know who did 9/11? \n3 8.  Mr. George, surprised by the question, did not immediately answer.  The \nTSA Supervisor repeated the question: \nJane Doe 3:  You know who did 9/11? \nPlaintiff:  Osama bin Laden. \nJane Doe 3:  Do you know what language he spoke? \nPlaintiff:  Arabic. \n39.  At this point the TSA Supervisor held up Mr. George's flashcards and \nstated: \nJane Doe 3:  Do you see why these cards are suspicious? \n40.  Mr. George was surprised and intimidated by these questions.  Mr. George \ntold the TSA Supervisor that he was carrying the flashcards because he was studying \nArabic in college.  Nevertheless, the TSA Supervisor's interrogation lasted approximately \n15 minutes. \n41.  Mr. George was detained by the three TSA officials-]o lm Does 1 and 2 \nand Jane Doe 3-during this interrogation.  He was not free to leave and believed that he \nwas not free to leave.  He reasonably believed that he was obligated to answer the TSA \nSupervisor's questions.  The three TSA officials maintained custody of his propeliy \n10 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 11 of 22\nthroughout the interrogation.  None of the TSA officials, including the TSA supervisor, \never suggested that Mr. George could leave the screening area if he wished. \nHandcuffing by Philadelphia Police Officer Rehiel \n42.  The TSA Supervisor (Jane Doe 3) was in mid-sentence when a police \nofficer atTived.  On information and belief, this was Defendant Rehiel, an officer of the \nPhiladelphia Police Department. \n43.  The first and only thing that the officer said was: \"Place your hands \nbehind your back.\"  Mr. George complied and the officer handcuffed Mr. George. \n44.  Mr. George was shocked by the arrival of the police officer and by the fact \nthat he had been handcuffed. \n45.  The officer took hold of Mr. George's anns and led him, handcuffed and \nin plain view of other passengers, through the terminal and down a set of stairs to the \nairport police station. \n46.  While he was being led away, Mr. George asked, \"Can you tell me what is \ngoing on?\" The officer replied, \"We are taking you for extra screening.\"  No further \nexplanation was given.  Mr. George was not informed of the reasons why he had been \ndetained, handcuffed, and atTested, or why \"extra screening\" was necessary. \n4 7.  During this time Mr. George remained shocked and bewildered as to what \nwas transpiring.  Mr. George had never been arrested before.  He did not know why he \nwas being arrested, where he was being taken, how long he would be detained, how he \nmight have avoided being detained, arrested, and handcuffed, or whether he had any right \nto make a phone call or to speak with an attorney. \n11 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 12 of 22\n48.  At no time did the officer inform Mr. George of any rights he retained, \nincluding the right to speak with an attorney, the right to remain silent, or the right to \nleave the airport rather than get on the flight.  Neither did the officer inform Mr. George \non what grounds he was being detained or arrested, how long he would be detained, or \nhow he might have avoided being detained, arrested, and handcuffed. \n49.  Mr. George was handcuffed and arrested by Officer Rehiel at \napproximately 2:20 in the afternoon. \nIncarceration for several hours \n50.  Defendant Rehielled Mr. George to a jail cell in the airport police station. \nThe officer walked into the cell with Mr. George. \n51.  The officer asked Mr. George whether he had \"ever been atTested before.\" \nMr. George replied, \"No.  Am I being arrested now?\"  The officer responded, \"No. You \nare just being detained.\" \n52.  The officer then exited the cell and locked the door behind him.  He did \nnot remove Mr. George's handcuffs.  No one ever provided Mr. George with any reason \nor explanation for why he was put into and kept in handcuffs. \n53.  Mr. George remained handcuffed in the cell for approximately two hours. \nHe was able to determine the passage of time by looking at a clock visible through a \nwindow in the door of his cell. \n54.  The cell contained a tile bench and had several windows, including the \none in the door of the cell.  Mr. George was able to move around the cell.  He could \nobserve what was occurring in the police station by looking out the door's window. \n12 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 13 of 22\n55.  Mr. George observed the activities in the police station while he was \ndetained in the cell.  He saw that his carry-on items, including the bag containing his \nspeakers, his wallet, and his flashcards had been brought to the station.  These items had \nbeen placed on a table. \n56.  At no point from the moment he was handcuffed until his release from the \npolice station did anybody tell Mr. George that he had the right to make a phone call or to \ncontact an attorney. \n57.  Mr. George observed several police officers, including Defendants Rehiel \nand Richards, search through his bag and wallet. \n58.  Approximately 15 minutes after Mr. George was incarcerated in the jail \ncell, Defendant Rehiel took the $30 of cash that was inside Mr. George's wallet, opened \nMr. George's jail cell, placed the cash inside Mr. George's pocket, and then exited the \njail cell, locking the door behind him.  He did not remove Mr. George's handcuffs. \n59.  The officers searching Mr. George's bag appeared to be particularly \ninterested in the flashcards, and also in a student ID card that had been issued to Mr. \nGeorge in connection with his study abroad program in Jordan. \n60.  Approximately two hours after he was first incarcerated, Mr. George saw \nat the police station an officer who appeared to be a duty sergeant, Defendant Richards. \nSome time later, Defendant Richards came to Mr. George's cell and asked whether Mr. \nGeorge had diabetes or a heart condition.  Mr. George responded that he did not, but \nasked whether he could use the restroom.  Defendant Richards made no comment about \nthe fact that Mr. George was handcuffed, but directed Defendant Rehiel to uncuffMr. \nGeorge and permitted Mr. George to use the restroom. \n13 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 14 of 22\n61.  Defendant Richards escorted Mr. George to the restroom, which was \nlocated approximately four feet from the cell.  The restroom's door was kept open while \nMr. George used the restroom.  Mr. George was then escmied back into to the cell by \nDefendant Richards, who exited the cell and locked it, leaving Mr. George alone once \nagam.  Mr. George was not put back into handcuffs. \n62.  Before Defendant Richards left, Mr. George asked why he was being held. \nDefendant Richards responded: \"I don't know. What did you do?\"  Mr. George \nresponded: \"I don't know.  Learn Arabic?\" \nInterrogation \n63.  Some time after Mr. George was returned to his cell without handcuffs, \ntwo detectives-John Does 4 and 5-arrived at the police station wearing plainclothes. \nUpon information and belief, John Does 4 and 5 were both employees of the Philadelphia \nPolice Depmiment, one of whom was affiliated with the Philadelphia Police \nDepmiment's Homeland Security Unit and the other with the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task \nForce.  Mr. George observed that the Philadelphia police officers appeared to treat the \ndetectives with deference and respect.  It appeared that the police officers had been \nexpecting and waiting for the detectives to anive.  During Mr. George's incarceration, the \nPhiladelphia police officers had called various federal and state agencies including the \nJTTF and the PPD-HS in order to arrange for Mr. George to be interrogated while in \ncustody. \n64.  John Does 4 and 5 searched Mr. George's carry-on items, including \nopening Mr. George's stereo speakers to inspect their insides. \n14 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 15 of 22\n65.  Mr. George was subsequently escorted out of his cell by John Does 4 and \n5 and led to a room inside the police station containing a large table and several chairs. \nMr. George was seated near one end of the table.  One detective was seated at the head of \nthe table next to Mr. George and the other was directly across from Mr. George. \n66.  The detectives never informed Mr. George of any rights that he retained. \nThey did not inform Mr. George that he had the right to contact an attorney or that he had \nthe right not to answer questions or to remain silent.  Mr. George was detained during this \ninterrogation, he was not free to leave, and the property that had been seized from him \nwas at this time still in the possession of John Does 4 and 5, and Philadelphia police \ndefendants.  Mr. George reasonably believed that he was obligated to answer all of the \ndetectives' questions.  The detectives did not inform Mr. George that he was free to leave \nuntil the end of the interrogation. \n67.  John Does 4 and 5 interrogated Mr. George for approximately 30 minutes. \nMr. George responded truthfully to all questions and maintained a calm and respectful \ndemeanor throughout. \n68.  The detectives asked Mr. George to identify himself, and proceeded to ask \na large number of questions about his personal and educational background, his religious \nand political beliefs, his prior ttavels, and other personal matters. \n69.  At one point during the interrogation, the agents asked Mr. George if he \nknew why he was being held.  Mr. George replied that he did not.  One of the detectives \nresponded, in part, by calling Mr. George a \"f---ing idiot.\" \n70.  John Does 4 and 5 had obtained Mr. George's passpmi.  Upon reviewing \nits pages, they asked a series of questions about his time in Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, and \n15 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 16 of 22\nMalaysia.  The detectives asked Mr. George how he had traveled from one place to \nanother, whom he had met while traveling, and whether he had met anybody who was \n\"overtly against the U.S. government.\"  Mr. George answered all of these questions \ntruthfully and accurately. \n71.  The detectives asked Mr. George whether he had ever joined a terrorist \ngroup.  Mr. George responded that he had not.  One detective asked Mr. George: \"Are \nyou Islamic?\"  Mr. George responded that he was not.  The detective followed up, asking \nwhether Mr. George was a member of any \"pro-Islamic groups\" on campus.  Again, Mr. \nGeorge responded that he was not.  The detective asked whether Mr. George was part of \nany \"communist groups\" on campus.  Yet again, Mr. George responded that he was not. \nThese answers, like all of Mr. George's responses, were truthful and accurate. \n72.  The detectives' questioning was wide-ranging and strayed far from any \nconceivable criminal activity.  During their questioning, for example, the John Does 4 \nand 5 repeatedly asked Mr. George why he had chosen to study physics at a liberal arts \ncollege such as Pomona. \n73.  After approximately 3 0 minutes of questioning, one of the detectives \nconcluded as follows: \"Our job is more an art than a science.  The police call us to \nevaluate whether there is a real threat.  You are not a real threat.\"  At this point, the \ndetectives indicated that Mr. George was free to leave. \n74.  Mr. George was released from custody at approximately 7:00 in the \nevening, nearly five hours after being handcuffed and arrested and well over five hours \nafter he was first detained by the TSA defendants. \n16 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 17 of 22\n75.  Mr. George never received an apology from anyone involved in his \ndetention, arrest, incarceration, or interrogations. \nPost-release \n76.  Mr. George returned to the airport Terminal.  His belongings had been \nreturned to him after John Does 4 and 5 indicated to him that he was free to leave.  He \nhad long since missed the flight on which he was originally scheduled to travel.  He \napproached the Southwest Airlines ticket counter.  Airline staff were on the phone.  Mr. \nGeorge observed that they appeared to be having a telephone conversation with the two \ndetectives who had just released him.  Eventually, a Southwest Airlines staff member \nemerged from a back room and informed Mr. George that he would have to wait until the \nnext day to get a flight. \n77.  Mr. George then called his father to pick him up from the airport.  Mr. \nGeorge explained to his father over the telephone what had transpired.  Mr. George's \nfather called the local FBI office while en route to the airport.  The person with whom he \nspoke at the FBI office would neither confirm nor deny anything about Mr. George's \ndetention and interrogation, and refused to give his name. \n78.  Mr. George's father arrived at the airport with Mr. George's mother and \nbrother.  Mr. George's father attempted to speak with somebody from the TSA to discuss \nwhat had happened.  He was able to speak only with a low-level TSA employee who had \nnot been involved in the prior events.  The conversation was not productive. \n79.  Mr. George and his father then went to the airport police station.  Mr. \nGeorge's father spoke with Sergeant Richards at the station.  They spoke for some time. \nMr. George's father thanked the sergeant for having removed the handcuffs from his son. \n17 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 18 of 22\nThe sergeant acknowledged that he had removed the handcuffs but was otherwise \nextremely defensive.  He would neither admit not confirm anything else.  The sergeant \noffered no apology. \n80.  The next day, Mr. George returned to the Philadelphia International \nAirport.  He boarded a Southwest Airlines flight destined for Phoenix without incident. \nHe also boarded the cmmecting flight from Phoenix to Ontario, California without \nincident. \n18 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 22   Filed 08/13/10   Page 19 of 22\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF: \nUnconstitutional Search and Seizure-Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, \n§1983, and Bivens \n81.

April 10, 2012\nThis is an action for money damages for an alleged unlawful search and seizure at the\nPhiladelphia Airport by federal and state personnel employed by the Transportation Security\nAdministration (TSA), Philadelphia Police Department (PPD), and the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation’s Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF).  Jurisdiction is federal question, 28\nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), 1346(b).  \nOn September 30, 2011, the motion to dismiss of the individual federal defendants\nbecause of qualified immunity (doc. no. 26) was denied, see order-memorandum opinion\nOctober 28, 2011 (doc. no. 43); and they appealed.1  On November 30, 2011, this action was\nplaced in civil suspense pending the appeal’s resolution.  \nPlaintiff Nicholas George now moves to reactivate this case and proceed with\ndiscovery (doc. no. 56).  Federal appellant defendants object.2  \n1  The United States’ motion to dismiss because of sovereign immunity was also denied, Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (Orders, doc. nos. 40, 43).  The complaint appeared to state claims for relief that\nwere “plausible on [their] face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (U.S. 2009) (quoting Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556, 570 (2007)).  The United States did not appeal.  \n2  State defendants PPD officers William Rehiel and William Edwards, Jr. do not object.\n1\n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 64   Filed 04/09/12   Page 2 of 4\nOn February 10, 2010, as amended on August 17, 2010, plaintiff filed suit against the\nindividual federal defendants under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal\nBureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971) and the state defendants  under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nThe complaint also pleads liability of defendant the United States under the Federal Tort\nClaims  Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 2671-2680, for the state common law torts of its\nemployees and agents – false arrest and imprisonment, assault and battery, and false light\ninvasion of privacy. \nThe tipping point of plaintiff’s motion to proceed with discovery despite the qualified\nimmunity appeal is that regardless of the outcome of that issue the case will remain litigable\nat least on the § 1983 and FTCA claims.  The same evidence and witnesses will be\ndiscoverable.  \nPlaintiff on qualified immunity:  it is “‘a right to immunity from certain claims, not\nfrom litigation in general.’”  Pl. br. at 5, doc. no. 56, quoting Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S.\n299, 312 (1996) (emphasis in original).  And delay may cause substantial prejudice because\nof loss of evidence and witnesses’ recollection.   \nIndividual  federal  defendants’  position:    To  uphold  the  interests  of  qualified\nimmunity, the stay of discovery in this case should include all issues inasmuch as the\nevidence is inseparable.  These defendants quote Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1953,\n1954 (U.S. 2009) for the all-inclusive need to protect government officials – regardless of\nthe presence of non-immune defendants. \n2\n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 64   Filed 04/09/12   Page 3 of 4\nIqbal dismissed the complaint because it was insufficient under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 to\nstate a claim, which disentitled plaintiff to the right of any discovery.  129 S. Ct. at 1954.  It\nis not authority for broadening the defense of qualified immunity to include the other claims\nin this case.  Galarza v. Szalczyk, Nos. 10-6815, 11-4988, 2012 WL 627917 (E.D. Pa. Feb.\n28, 2012) (Perkins, M.J.).  Here, the stay on appeal does not cover the § 1983 claims against\ndefendants Rehiel and Edwards or the FTCA claims against the United States.  \nTo ask the Court of Appeals to resolve this conflict on what amounts to interlocutory\nreview, when as a virtual certainty the same discovery matters cannot now be finally decided,\nis hardly a logical or desirable result.  \nTwo Pennsylvania District Courts have authorized discovery proceedings during the\npendency of similar appeals.  Galarza, supra; Seeds of Peace Collective v. City of Pittsburgh,\nNo. 09-1275, 2010 WL 2990734 (W.D. Pa. July 28, 2010) (Lancaster, C.J.).  Plaintiff also\ncites numerous cases from other jurisdictions, four of which were decided after Iqbal.3  \n3  Plaintiff also cites:  In re Scott ex. rel. Simmons v.

A proposed order is attached.  As support for this motion, the United States \nsubmits the following: \nOn February-10, 2010, PlaintiffNicholas George filed a Complaint for Damages against \nfive federal agents or employees in their individual capacities.  The defendants are two \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 10   Filed 05/21/10   Page 2 of 4\n\"unknown named agents\" of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") and three \"unknown \nnamed officers or agents of the Transportation Security Administration (\"TSA\").  All of the \ndefendants are sued in their individual capacities.  In addition, three named Philadelphia police \nofficers are sued.  On May 14, 2010, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to Conduct Limited \nExpedited Doe Discovery.  Plaintiff moved, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 and 45, for an order \nallowing Plaintiff to serve a Rule 45 subpoena on the FBI and the TSA, both non-parties, for the \nproduction of documents identifying the true names and identities of the Doe defendants. \nPlaintiff would require that the FBI and TSA respond to the subpoena within fifteen (15) \nbusiness days of the date of service. \n28 U.S.C. § 517 expressly authorizes the Attorney General to send any officer ofthe \nDepartment of Justice \"to attend to the interests of the United States\" in any action pending in a \nstate or federal court.  Plaintiffs motion seeks permission to conduct discovery against the \nUnited States.  However, the United States is not a party to this matter.  For this reason, pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 517, the United States submits this motion to intervene in order to respond to \nPlaintiffs motion for expedited discovery.  The United States intends to file a response to \nplaintiff's motion within 14 days, as permitted by local rule 7.1(c).  This motion is submitted \nsolely on behalf of the United States, not on behalf of any individual capacity defendant, and \ndoes not waive their right to separately object to any discovery sought by Plaintiff, now or in the \nfuture.  Nor does this motion and response waive the United States' right to seek to quash or \notherwise oppose a subpoena or other discovery request that might eventually be served on the \nUnited States by Plaintiff in this action. \n2 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 10   Filed 05/21/10   Page 3 of 4\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant the United States' motion to intervene \nin this matter. \nDated: May 21.2010  Respectfully submitted, \nZANE DAVID MEMEGER  ANNM.RAVEL \nUnited States Attorney  Deputy Assistant Attorney General \nTHOMAS JOHNSON  TIMOTHY P.

No. 10-586 \nDECLARATION OF SARAH TAUBER \nI, Sarah Tauber, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, declare as follows: \n1.  I am an employee of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), \nwhich is a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  I have \ns~rved with TSA and DHS in varying capacities since October 17, 2002, including a term \n3:S Branch Manager for TSA's Behavior Detection and Analysis (BDA) Program within \nTSA's Office of Security Operations (OSO), beginning on June 12, 2012 and ending on \nOctober 14, 2014.  As of October 14, 2014~ I serve as the Deputy Director for Threat \nAssessment Division of OSO, and the BDA Program remains part of my portfolio.  This \nDeclaration is based on my personal knowledge or knowledge gained in those official \ncapacities. \n2.  As the head of the BDA Program, I oversaw all aspects ofTSA's behavior \ndetection program and procedures.  TSA employees trained specifically as Behavior \nDetection Officers (BDOs) observe passengers prior to and during the screening process \nin order to determine whether any are exhibiting acts or behaviors indicative of a high \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-MAK   Document 105   Filed 01/22/15   Page 18 of 18\nrisk passenger who may attempt to cause harm to an aircraft or the passengers on an \naircraft.  Where a BDO observes sufficient high risk indicators, an individual. is simply \nsubject to some additional screening similar to that employed when carry-on baggage X-\nRay displays an anomaly.  This type of additional screening usually takes five minutes or \nless. \n3.  When appropriate, BDOs may refer the passenger to a Law Enforcement \nOfficer (LEO} for resolution of any potential security concerns that the BDO may have \nidentified.  Under current procedures, this is known as a LEO Referral. \n4.  TSA does not have direct authority over law enforcement officers. \nTherefore, if a LEO responds to a BDO referral, that officer will use his or her training \nand judgment to decide what actions to take. \n5.  I am aware of no TSA document or policy that requires a police officer \nresponding to a LEO Referral under TSA behavior detection procedures to arrest the \npassenger in question.  The BDA program anticipates that responding poHce officers will \nexercise their independent judgment on how to proceed after the referral is made. \nIll \nIll \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nExecuted November IO, 2014. \nArlington, Virginia \nDeputy Director, Threat Assessment Division \nOffice of Security Operations \nTransportation Security Administration \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security  · ",

Mr. George was released \nonly after having been subjected to an additional 30 minutes of custodial interrogation at \nthe hands of two FBI agents. \n3.  The conduct of the TSA officials, the Philadelphia police, and the FBI \nviolated Mr. George's Fomih Amendment right to be free from umeasonable seizure and \nhis First Amendment right to freedom of speech.  He brings this lawsuit in order to \nvindicate those rights. \nPARTIES \n4.  PlaintiffNicholas George is a 22-year-old citizen of the United States and \nresident of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

This Court \n4 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 5 of 19\nhas authority to award costs and attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and 28 \nU.S.C. § 2412. \n12.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b) and \n1391(e). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n13.  On Saturday, August 29, 2009, PlaintiffNicholas George was scheduled \nto fly on Southwest Airlines from Philadelphia International Airport to Ontario \nInternational Airpmi in California, via Phoenix.  He was traveling to California in order \nto begin his senior year at Pomona College. \nArrival at Airport and Check-in \n14.  After Mr. George arrived at the airport, he waited in the line for check-in \nand, upon reaching the counter, he presented his identification and received a boarding \npass for his flight without incident.  He then proceeded to the security screening area. \n15.  Mr. George canied a single piece of cany-on luggage, a black athletic \nbag.  Inside the athletic bag were two small speakers (approximately 10 \" x 6\" x 6\") that \nhe intended to use with his stereo system in California. \n16.  As Mr. George approached the x-ray screening device, a TSA official-\nnot a defendant in this action-asked Mr. George to present his identification and \nboarding pass.  Mr. George complied.  The TSA official asked Mr. George what was \ninside his carry-on bag.  Mr. George responded that the bag contained his speakers.  The \nTSA official then asked Mr. George to step aside.  Mr. George complied.  The TSA \nofficial asked Mr. George to remove the speakers, so that they could be passed through \nthe x-ray screening device separately.  Mr. George complied. \n5 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 6 of 19\n17.  Mr. George placed his carry-on bag and his speakers on the belt.  He \nemptied his pockets of all items containing metal, including his wallet and cell phone, \nand took off his shoes.  These items were also placed on the belt to pass tluough the \nscreening device. \n18.  Mr. George stepped up to the metal detector.  He walked through the \nmetal detector without incident.  The detector made no sound. \n19.  The TSA official who was operating the metal detector-not a defendant \nin this action-nevertheless asked Mr. George to step aside and to wait.  This TSA \nofficial asked to see Mr. George's boarding pass.  Mr. George showed his boarding pass \nto the official.  There was a glass enclosure located next to the metal detector that was \nused for additional screening.  After this glass-enclosed screening area had been vacated \nby a previous passenger, the TSA official directed Mr. George to enter.  Mr. George \nstepped into the glass enclosure as directed. \n20.  Inside the glass enclosure another TSA official (Defendant John Doe 1) \nasked Mr. George to empty his pockets.  Mr. George had already emptied his pockets of \nany items containing metal, so among the only items remaining was a set of flashcards. \nMr. George handed the flashcards to the TSA official, as instructed. \nEnglish-Arabic Flashcards \n21.  Each flashcard had Arabic words on one side and English translations on \nthe other.  The flashcards were of the kind that would commonly be used by a person \nstudying a foreign language.  Indeed, Mr. George used the flashcards as a tool for \nlearning Arabic vocabulary. \n6 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 7 of 19\n22.  Mr. George had been studying Arabic for three years, beginning in his first \nyear of college, in connection with his Middle-Eastern Studies major.  Mr. George had \nspent a semester in Jordan studying Arabic as part of a study abroad program organized \nby the Council on International Educational Exchange, a U.S. non-profit organization \nfounded in 1947.  He received credit at Pomona College for the courses he took in \nJordan.  Upon completing the program, he spent approximately five weeks traveling in \nEthiopia, Egypt, and Sudan-the latter two of which are Arabic-speaking countries-as a \ntourist and in order to practice his Arabic language skills. \n23.  Mr. George has a strong interest in the contemporary politics of the \nMiddle East, especially as they involve and affect the United States.  Mr. George sought \nto learn Arabic in order to be able to read and understand what was being repmied and \ndebated in contemporary Middle Eastern newspapers, television programs, and other \npublications or media. \nDetention by TSA Screeners \n24.  The TSA official to whom Mr. George handed the flashcards (Defendant \nJohn Doe 1) proceeded to inspect them.  The official did not make any comment and did \nnot indicate that there was any kind of problem.  He neve1iheless took Mr. George to a \ndifferent screening area.  Mr. George waited there while that TSA official and another \nTSA official (Defendant John Doe 2) further inspected his bag and the flashcards.  One of \nthese two TSA officials swabbed Mr. George's cell phone in order to run a test for \nexplosives.  The test returned a negative result.  The TSA officials found nothing among \nMr. George's personal effects that posed a safety risk or was otherwise prohibited in the \n\"sterile\" area of the airpmi and aboard an airplane.  Indeed, Mr. George was not carrying \n7 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 8 of 19\nany prohibited items or items that could pose a safety risk.  Nor was Mr. George canying \nanything suggestive of criminal or otherwise prohibited activity. \n25.  It soon became apparent to Mr. George that the two TSA officials were \nstalling.  The TSA officials completed their search of Mr. George's carry-on items within \nten minutes.  One of the officials flipped through the pages of books that Mr. George had \namong his carry-on items.  He swabbed Mr. George's cell phone for a second time and \nhalf-hemiedly re-examined Mr. George's other carry-on items.  The official also \nattempted to make small talk, asking Mr. George if he had seen the recent Philadelphia \nPhillies baseball game.  After Mr. George responded in the affirmative and offered his \nopinion of the game, the TSA official admitted that he had not seen the game and did not \ngenerally watch the Phillies. \n26.  The other official stepped away and placed a phone call.  He was speaking \non the phone for some time.  Mr. George could not hear the call but believed that he \nmight have been speaking with a TSA supervisor.  On information and belief, the TSA \nofficial was speaking on the phone with a TSA supervisor or other official about Mr. \nGeorge's screening, including the English-Arabic flashcards. \n27.  The two TSA officials kept Mr. George in the side screening area for 30 \nminutes.  The TSA officials maintained Mr. George's property-including his wallet, \nidentification, passport, and boarding pass-in their custody.  At no point did the TSA \nofficials retum, or offer to retum, Mr. George's propetiy to him.  During this period of \ntime Mr. George was detained by the TSA officials.  Mr. George was not free to leave \nand believed that he was not free to leave. \n8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 9 of 19\n28.  During this time, Mr. George became increasingly concerned that he \nwould miss his flight.  He asked the TSA officials how much longer he would have to \nwait and mentioned to the officials that his flight was leaving shortly. \n29.  The TSA officials did not explain to Mr. George why he could not proceed \nto the gate, nor did they explain to him the reason that he was being delayed and \ndetained.  The TSA officials at no point suggested that Mr. George could leave the \nscreening area if he wished. \nDetention and interrogation by TSA Supervisor \n30.  After 30 minutes, a TSA Supervisor anived (Jane Doe 3).  The Supervisor \nimmediately began questioning Mr. George in a hostile and aggressive manner.  Mr. \nGeorge responded to all questions truthfully and to the best of his ability, in a polite and \ncalm manner. \n31.  The TSA Supervisor's questioning proceeded, in pmi, as follows: \nJane Doe 3:  How do you feel about 9/11? \n32.  Mr. George responded that he thought 9/11 was a tenible event. \n33.  At this point, the Supervisor noted that Mr. George had with him a book \nentitled \"Rogue Nation: American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions,\" by \nClyde Prestowitz, published by Basic Books in 2004.  The book has been described by \nGeneral Wesley Clark as \"a fascinating big picture look at America and its place in the \nworld [that] should help provoke the kind of discussion that we have long needed.\" \nJoseph Nye, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, has \ndescribed the book as \"[a] conservative's sober warning of the dangers ofunilateralism \nand the temptations of empire.\" \n9 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 10 of 19\n34.  After noticing the book, the TSA Supervisor continued her hostile and \naggressive questioning as follows: \nJane Doe 3:  You obviously read.  You know who did 9/11? \n35.  Mr. George, surprised by the question, did not immediately answer.  The \nTSA Supervisor repeated the question: \nJane Doe 3:  You know who did 9/11? \nPlaintiff:  Osama bin Laden. \nJane Doe 3:  Do you know what language he spoke? \nPlaintiff:  Arabic. \n36.  At this point the TSA Supervisor held up Mr. George's flashcards and \nstated: \nJane Doe 3:  Do you see why these cards are suspicious? \n3 7.  Mr. George was surprised and intimidated by these questions.  Mr. George \ntold the TSA Supervisor that he was carrying the flashcards because he was studying \nArabic in college.  Nevertheless, the TSA Supervisor's intenogation lasted approximately \n15 minutes, during which time Mr. George became increasingly worried that he would \nmiss his flight. \n38.  Mr. George was detained by the three TSA officials-John Does 1 and 2 \nand Jane Doe 3-during this interrogation.  He was not free to leave and believed that he \nwas not free to leave.  He reasonably believed that he was obligated to answer the TSA \nSupervisor's questions.  The three TSA officials maintained custody of his property \nthroughout the interrogation.  None of the TSA officials, including the TSA supervisor, \never suggested that Mr. George could leave the screening area if he wished. \n10 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 11 of 19\nHandcuffing by Philadelphia Police Officer Reihl \n39.  The TSA Supervisor (Jane Doe 3) was in mid-sentence when a police \nofficer arrived.  On information and belief, this was Defendant Reihl, an officer of the \nPhiladelphia Police Depmiment. \n40.  The first and only thing that the officer said was: \"Place your hands \nbehind your back.\"  Mr. George complied and the officer handcuffed Mr. George. \n41.  Mr. George was shocked by the arrival of the police officer and by the fact \nthat he had been handcuffed. \n42.  The officer took hold of Mr. George's arms and led him, handcuffed and \nin plain view of other passengers, through the terminal and down a set of stairs to the \nairport police station. \n43.  While he was being led away, Mr. George asked, \"Can you tell me what is \ngoing on?\"  The officer replied, \"We are taking you for extra screening.\" No further \nexplanation was given.  Mr. George was not informed of the reasons why he had been \ndetained, handcuffed, and arrested, or why \"extra screening\" was necessary. \n44.  During this time Mr. George remained shocked and bewildered as to what \nwas transpiring.  Mr. George had never been arrested before.  He did not lmow why he \nwas being arrested, where he was being taken, how long he would be detained, how he \nmight have avoided being detained, arrested, and handcuffed, or whether he had any right \nto make a phone call or to speak with an attorney. \n45.  At no time did the officer inform Mr. George of any rights he retained, \nincluding the right to speak with an attorney, the right to remain silent, or the right to \nleave the airpmi rather than get on the flight.  Neither did the officer inform Mr. George \n11 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 12 of 19\non what grounds he was being detained or arrested, how long he would be detained, or \nhow he might have avoided being detained, arrested, and handcuffed. \nIncarceration for several hours \n46.  The officer led Mr. George to a jail cell in the airport police station.  The \nofficer walked into the cell with Mr. George. \n47.  The officer asked Mr. George whether he had \"ever been arrested before.\" \nMr. George replied, \"No.  Am I being arrested now?\"  The officer responded, \"No. You \nare just being detained.\" \n48.  The officer then exited the cell and locked the door behind him.  He did \nnot remove Mr. George's handcuffs.  No one ever provided Mr. George with any reason \nor explanation for why he was put into and kept in handcuffs. \n49.  Mr. George remained handcuffed in the cell for approximately two hours. \nHe was able to determine the passage of time by looking at a clock visible through a \n' \nwindow in the door of his cell. \n50.  The cell contained a tile bench and had several windows, including the \none in the door of the cell.  Mr. George was able to move around the cell.  He could \nobserve what was occurring in the police station by looking out the door's window. \n51.  Mr. George observed the activities in the police station while he was \ndetained in the cell.  He saw that his carry-on items, including the bag containing his \nspeakers, his wallet, and his flashcards had been brought to the station.  These items had \nbeen placed on a table. \n12 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 13 of 19\n52.  At no point from the moment he was handcuffed until his release from the \npolice station did anybody tell Mr. George that he had the right to make a phone call or to \ncontact an attorney. \n53.  Mr. George observed several police officers, including Defendants Reihl \nand Richards, search through his bag and wallet. \n54.  Approximately 15 minutes after Mr. George was incarcerated in the jail \ncell, Defendant Reihl took the $30 of cash that was contained in Mr. George's wallet, \nopened Mr. George's jail cell, placed the cash inside Mr. George's pocket, and then \nexited the jail cell, locking the door behind him.  He did not remove Mr. George's \nhandcuffs. \n55.  The officers searching Mr. George's bag appeared to be patiicularly \ninterested in the flashcards, and also in a student ID card that had been issued to Mr. \nGeorge in connection with his study abroad program in Jordan. \n56.  Approximately two hours after he was first incarcerated, Mr. George saw \nat the police station an officer who appeared to be a duty sergeant, Defendant Richards. \nSome time later, Defendant Richards came to Mr. George's cell and asked whether Mr. \nGeorge had diabetes or a heart condition.  Mr. George responded that he did not, but \nasked whether he could use the restroom.  Defendant Richards made no comment about \nthe fact that Mr. George was handcuffed, but directed Defendant Reihl to uncuffMr. \nGeorge and permitted Mr. George to use the restroom. \n57.  Defendant Richards escmied Mr. George to the restroom, which was \nlocated approximately four feet from the cell.  The restroom's door was kept open while \nMr. George used the restroom.  Mr. George was then escorted back into to the cell by \n13 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 14 of 19\nDefendant Richards, who exited the cell and locked it, leaving Mr. George alone once \nagam.  Mr. George was not put back into handcuffs. \n58.  Before Defendant Richards left, Mr. George asked why he was being held. \nDefendant Richards responded: \"I don't know. What did you do?\"  Mr. George \nresponded: \"I don't know.  Leam Arabic?\" \nFBI Interrogation \n59.  Some time after Mr. George was retumed to his cell without handcuffs, \ntwo FBI officers-John Does 4 and 5-arrived at the police station wearing plainclothes. \nMr. George observed that the Philadelphia police officers appeared to treat the FBI agents \nwith deference and respect.  It appeared that the police officers had been expecting and \nwaiting for the FBI agents to arrive.  On information and belief, the Philadelphia police \nofficers called the FBI and requested that they intenogate Mr. George. \n60.  The FBI officers searched Mr. George's cany-on items, including opening \nMr. George's stereo speakers to inspect their insides. \n61.  Mr. George was subsequently esc01ied out of his cell by the two FBI \nofficers and led to a room inside the police station containing a large table and several \nchairs.  Mr. George was seated near one end of the table.  One FBI officer was seated at \nthe head of the table next to Mr. George and the other FBI officer was directly across \nfrom Mr. George. \n62.  The FBI agents never informed Mr. George of any rights that he retained. \nThey did not inform Mr. George that he had the right to contact an attorney or that he had \nthe right not to answer questions or to remain silent.  Mr. George was detained during this \ninterrogation, he was not free to leave, and the propeliy that had been seized from him \n14 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 15 of 19\nwas at this time still in the possession of the FBI and Philadelphia police defendants.  Mr. \nGeorge reasonably believed that he was obligated to answer all of the FBI agents' \nquestions.  The FBI agents did not inform Mr. George that he was free to leave until the \nend of the interrogation. \n63.  The FBI agents interrogated Mr. George for approximately 30 minutes. \nMr. George responded truthfully to all questions and maintained a calm and respectful \ndemeanor throughout. \n64.  The agents asked Mr. George to identify himself, and proceeded to ask a \nlarge number of questions about his personal and educational background, his religious \nand political beliefs, his prior travels, and other personal matters. \n65.  At one point during the interrogation, the agents asked Mr. George if he \nknew why he was being held.  Mr. George replied that he did not.  One of the agents \nresponded, in pmi, by calling Mr. George a \"f---ing idiot.\" \n66.  The FBI agents had obtained Mr. George's passport.  Upon reviewing its \npages, the agents asked a series of questions about his time in Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, \nand Malaysia.  The agents asked Mr. George how he had traveled from one place to \nanother, whom he had met while traveling, and whether he had met anybody who was \n\"ove1ily against the U.S. government.\"  Mr. George answered all of these questions \ntruthfully and accurately. \n67.  The agents asked Mr. George whether he had ever joined a tenorist group. \nMr. George responded that he had not One FBI agent asked Mr. George: \"Are you \nIslamic?\"  Mr. George responded that he was not.  The agent followed up, asking whether \nMr. George was a member of any \"pro-Islamic groups\" on campus.  Again, Mr. George \n15 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 16 of 19\nresponded that he was not.  The agent asked whether Mr. George was part of any \n\"communist groups\" on campus.  Yet again, Mr. George responded that he was not. \nThese answers, like all of Mr. George's responses, were truthful and accurate. \n68.  The FBI agents' questioning was wide-ranging and strayed far from any \nconceivable criminal activity.  During their questioning, for example, the FBI agents \nrepeatedly asked Mr. George why he had chosen to study physics at a liberal mis college \nsuch as Pomona. \n69.  After approximately 30 minutes of questioning, one of the FBI agents \nconcluded as follows: \"Our job is more an ali than a science.  The police call us to \nevaluate whether there is a real threat.  You are not a real threat.\"  At this point, the FBI \nagents indicated that Mr. George was free to leave. \n70.  Mr. George never received an apology from anyone involved in his \ndetention, arrest, incarceration, or intenogations. \nPost-release \n71.  Mr. George returned to the airpoti Terminal.  His belongings had been \nreturned to him after the FBI officers indicated to him that he was free to leave.  He had \nlong since missed the flight on which he was originally scheduled to travel.  He \napproached the Southwest Airlines ticket counter.  Airline staff were on the phone.  Mr. \nGeorge observed that they appeared to be having a telephone conversation with the FBI \nagents who had just released him.  Eventually, a Southwest Airlines staff member \nemerged from a back room and informed Mr. George that he would have to wait until the \nnext day to get a flight. \n16 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 17 of 19\n72.  Mr. George then called his father to pick him up from the airport.  Mr. \nGeorge explained to his father over the telephone what had transpired.  Mr. George's \nfather called the local FBI office while en route to the airport.  The person with whom he \nspoke at the FBI office would neither confirm nor deny anything about Mr. George's \ndetention and intell'ogation, and refused to give his name. \n73.  Mr. George's father all'ived at the airport with Mr. George's mother and \nbrother.  Mr. George's father attempted to speak with somebody from the TSA to discuss \nwhat had happened.  He was able to speak only with a low-level TSA employee who had \nnot been involved in the prior events.  The conversation was not productive. \n74.  Mr. George and his father then went to the airpmi police station.  Mr. \nGeorge's father spoke with Sergeant Richards at the station.  They spoke for some time. \nMr. George's father thanked the sergeant for having removed the handcuffs from his son. \nThe sergeant acknowledged that he had removed the handcuffs but was otherwise \nextremely defensive.  He would neither admit not confirm anything else.  The sergeant \noffered no apology. \n75.  The next day, Mr. George returned to the Philadelphia International \nAirpoti.  He boarded a Southwest Airlines flight destined for Phoenix without incident. \nHe also boarded the connecting flight :fi:om Phoenix to Ontario, California without \nincident. \n17 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-00586-EL   Document 1   Filed 02/10/10   Page 18 of 19\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF: \nUnconstitutional Search and Seizure-Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, \n§1983, and Bivens \n76.
