      "text": " \n \n955 F.Supp. 582 (1997) \nUNITED STATES of America \nv. \nHarold J. NICHOLSON, Defendant. \nCriminal No. 96-448-A. \nUnited States District Court, E.D. Virginia, Alexandria Division. \nFebruary 3, 1997. \nHelen F. Fahey, United States Attorney, for Plaintiff. \nJonathan Shapiro, Liam O'Grady, Washington, D.C., for Defendant. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nCACHERIS, District Judge. \nThis matter comes before the Court on Defendant Harold J. Nicholson's (\"the Defendant\") Motion \nrequesting this Judge to recuse himself.[1] The Defendant is charged with Espionage, Attempted \nEspionage, and Conspiracy to Commit Espionage, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 794. Motions have \nbeen set for February 14, 1997, and Classified Information Procedures Act (\"CIPA\") hearings and \ntrial have been set for March 3, 1997 and April 14, 1997, respectively.[2] \n583*583 The basis for the Motion is Defendant's assertion that this Court's impartiality might \nreasonably be questioned because of this Judge's participation as a member of the United States \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISA Court\"), established under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act of 1978, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1811 (\"FISA\"). Specifically, the Defendant asserts that \nthis Judge should disqualify himself because: (1) this Judge authorized two FISA orders in this case, \nand should not be permitted to adjudicate the validity of those orders; (2) this Judge received ex \npartecommunications during FISA proceedings, which will cause his impartiality during the trial and \nsentencing to be reasonably questioned; and (3) \"this case will present the first constitutional \nchallenge of the FISA Court's authority to order physical searches without conventional warrants\" \n\nand thus should not be heard by this Judge, a sitting member of that Court. For the reasons set forth \nin this Opinion, this Motion is hereby DENIED. \nI. \nA litigant has two statutory bases to remove a judge from a case: 28 U.S.C. § 144 and 28 U.S.C. § \n455. The Defendant brought this Motion pursuant to a provision within the latter, which provides that \na judge \"shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be \nquestioned.\" 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) (West 1996). The issue of recusal is assessed from the perspective \nof a reasonable man; disqualification is proper if a \"reasonable factual basis [exists] for doubting the \njudge's impartiality.\" Rice v. McKenzie, 581 F.2d 1114, 1116 (4th Cir.1978). The Court properly \nhears this Motion; the statute provides that \"a judge shall disqualify himself.\" 28 U.S.C. § 455 \n(emphasis added). The Court will now examine each of the Defendant's arguments in turn. \nII. \nThe Defendant argues that, even if FISA is constitutional, the participation of this Judge in issuing \ntwo search authorizations should prevent him from hearing this case. The relevant case law \nindicates otherwise. \nThe Court does not know of any precedent directly assessing the effect of a trial judge having \npreviously issued a FISA surveillance order. The Court's analysis will thus be guided by the most \nrecent Supreme Court precedent concerning judicial recusal, as well as analogous instances in \nwhich the trial judge participated in preliminary proceedings. \nLiteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994),stands as the \nSupreme Court's latest word on judicial recusal under section 455. In that case, a criminal defendant \nargued that the trial judge should have recused himself because his statements and rulings \nmanifested \"impatience, disregard for the defense, and animosity\" towards the defendant. 510 U.S. \nat 542, 114 S.Ct. at 1151. In ruling against the defendant, the Supreme Court held: \n[f]irst, judicial rulings alone almost never constitute valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.... \nSecond, opinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the \ncourse of the current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or \npartiality motion unless they display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair \njudgment impossible. \n510 U.S. at 555, 114 S.Ct. at 1157 (emphasis added). \nAs the First Circuit recently reiterated, \"mere exposure to prejudicial information does not, in itself, \nestablish the requisite factual basis\" for recusal. United States v. Voccola, 99 F.3d 37, 42 (1st \n\nCir.1996) (quoting United States v. Giorgi, 840 F.2d 1022, 1035 (1st Cir.1988)). Accordingly, \"facts \nlearned by a judge while acting in his judicial capacity cannot be the basis for disqualification.\" Union \nIndependiente de Empleados de Servicios Legales v. Puerto Rico Legal Servs., Inc., 550 F.Supp. \n1109, 1111 (D.P.R. 1982) (citing United States v. Patrick, 542 F.2d 381, 390 (7th Cir.1976),cert. \ndenied, 430 U.S. 931, 97 S.Ct. 1551, 51 L.Ed.2d 775 (1977), and United States v. Bernstein, 533 \nF.2d 775, 785 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 998, 97 S.Ct. 523, 50 L.Ed.2d 608 \n(1976)); see 584*584 also United States v. Gordon, 61 F.3d 263, 268 (4th Cir.1995). When sitting on \nthe FISA Court, this Judge is properly \"acting in his judicial capacity.\" See United States v. \nJohnson, 1990 WL 78522, at *7 (D.Mass. Apr. 13, 1990), aff'd, 952 F.2d 565 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. \ndenied, 506 U.S. 816, 113 S.Ct. 58, 121 L.Ed.2d 27 (1992); United States v. Hovsepian, 1985 WL \n5970, *3 (C.D.Cal. Jan. 28, 1985); United States v. Megahey, 553 F.Supp. 1180, 1196-98 \n(E.D.N.Y.1982), aff'd, sub nom United States v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59 (2d Cir.1984). This Judge \nholds no opinions regarding this case based on his involvement in FISA proceedings, and certainly \nharbors none of the \"deep-seated favoritism or antagonism\" which would require \nrecusal. See Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555, 114 S.Ct. at 1157. \nThe Court believes that the circumstances of the case at bar most closely resemble previous cases \nin which the trial judge had issued wiretap orders. Under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. § 2510, et seq., a judge decides whether to grant authority to \nwiretap the subject of an investigation in a manner similar to a FISA judge's review of search \nrequests. Besides United States v. Zarowitz, 326 F.Supp. 90, 93-94 (C.D.Cal. 1971), which will be \nfurther analyzed below, this Court knows of no case in which a judge recused himself because of \npreviously authorizing the wiretap which led to the defendant's arrest. \nIn one Title III case, the First Circuit held that the \"mere fact\" that the trial judge had authorized \n\"some (or all) of the underlying intercepts\" did not require recusal.Camacho v. Autoridad de \nTelefonos de Puerto Rico, 868 F.2d 482, 490 (1st Cir.1989). The court emphasized that \"[n]othing \nabout the fact that the judge signed the orders sought by federal officials would lead a reasonable \nperson to question the jurist's impartiality.\" Id. at 491.[3] \nOn similar facts, the trial judge in United States v. Garramone had issued the order authorizing \nelectronic surveillance of the eventual defendant. 374 F.Supp. 256, 259 (E.D.Pa.1974). The judge \nrefused to recuse himself, ruling that \"prior judicial exposure to the parties or questions [is] not \nsufficient to establish personal bias or prejudice.\" Id. at 258. That holding mirrors the Supreme \nCourt's view as expressed inLiteky. \nIn other instances, courts have ruled that a judge need not recuse himself based on participation in \npretrial proceedings related to wire tapping. The Second Circuit ruled proper a trial judge's refusal to \nrecuse himself in a case in which he had \"conducted an eleven-day hearing on the wire \ntapping.\" United States v. Foddrell, 523 F.2d 86, 87 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 950, 96 S.Ct. \n370, 46 L.Ed.2d 286 (1975). The Fifth Circuit similarly held that a trial judge need not recuse himself \n\nbased on his presiding at a pretrial suppression hearing regarding wiretap evidence. United States v. \nde la Fuente, 548 F.2d 528, 541 (5th Cir.) (\"Merely presiding at a pretrial suppression hearing does \nnot disqualify a judge from conducting the trial on the merits\"), cert. denied sub nom. Stewart v. \nUnited States, 431 U.S. 932, 97 S.Ct. 2640, 53 L.Ed.2d 249, and sub nom. Sierra v. United \nStates, 434 U.S. 954, 98 S.Ct. 479, 54 L.Ed.2d 312 (1977). \nThe Fourth Circuit has ruled that a trial judge need not testify as to when he gave an oral order to \nseal tapes of telephonic and oral conversations obtained via electronic surveillance. United States v. \nDiana, 605 F.2d 1307, 1316 (4th Cir.1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1102, 100 S.Ct. 1067, 62 L.Ed.2d \n787 (1980). Accordingly, the court held that the judge properly refused to recuse himself pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 455. Id. In doing so, the Fourth Circuit implicitly ruled that a trial judge need not recuse \nhimself in a case in which he granted an order to seal tapes. \nThe Fourth Circuit has also ruled recusal is not warranted in an instance in which a judge entered \nrulings on pretrial motions or presided over other parallel proceedings.See United States v. \nParker, 742 F.2d 127, 128-29 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1076, 105 S.Ct. 575, 83 L.Ed.2d 514 \n(1984). Though not expressly considering a motion to recuse, other courts have allowed the \nsame 585*585 judge to preside over the trial after having ruled on a pretrial motion to suppress \nmaterials obtained pursuant to FISA. See, e.g., United States v. Miller, 984 F.2d 1028, 1032 (9th \nCir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 894, 114 S.Ct. 258, 126 L.Ed.2d 210 (1993). \nThe Defendant's reliance on Rice v. McKenzie, 581 F.2d 1114 (4th Cir.1978) is \nmisplaced.[4] In Rice, the Fourth Circuit held that a recently appointed federal district judge should \nnot conduct Habeas Corpus review of a conviction over which he presided while still a state court \njudge. Id. at 1117. Certainly, the review of an entire case, as in Rice, is significantly different than \nany review this Court might be called on to conduct here. On a routine basis, district judges are \ncalled on to review their own decisions in numerous situations. These instances include a motion for \na new trial after the rendering of a verdict in a bench trial and all cases which have been reversed by \nan appellate court and remanded for the district court's further consideration. See Liteky, 510 U.S. at \n551, 114 S.Ct. at 1155. The Court is unaware of any successful challenge to a court's ability to \nreview its own decision in these instances. \nThe Court notes that one case does exist in which a judge recused himself after having issued \nwiretap authorization. Zarowitz, 326 F.Supp. at 93-94. In Zarowitz, the judge disqualified himself \nbased on an \"appearance of possible personal bias or prejudice\" created by the combination of his \nauthorizing wiretaps and issuing court orders compelling testimony of recalcitrant but immunized \nwitnesses. Id. at 91-92. The court in that case, however, specifically held that its pretrial participation \ndid notprovide a basis for recusal under either section 144 or section 455. Id. at 92. Even \nifZarowitz stands for the proposition that a trial judge must recuse himself after authorizing a wiretap, \nthis Court aligns itself with the First Circuit's rejection of such a per se rule. See Camacho, 868 F.2d \nat 491 n. 8. \n\nDefendant further asserts that a reasonable question as to the Court's impartiality will be raised by a \n\"lack of independent review,\" since \"any decision reached by [this Judge] regarding a FISA warrant \nis reviewed by the Fourth Circuit only under an abuse of discretion standard, as opposed to the de \nnovo review available in non-FISA search and seizure cases.\" Def.Mot. at 6 n. 2 (citation omitted). \nFirst, Defendant fails to cite any support for his assertion that FISA cases are reviewed under a more \ndeferential standard. Moreover, when addressing the denial of a motion to suppress, the Fourth \nCircuit \"reviews pure questions of law de novo and pure questions of fact for clear error. Mixed \nquestions of law and fact are evaluated under a hybrid standard.\" United States v. Han, 74 F.3d 537, \n540 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 1890, 135 L.Ed.2d 184 (1996); see also United \nStates v. Rusher, 966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 926, 113 S.Ct. 351, 121 \nL.Ed.2d 266 (1992). If the Defendant were to attack the constitutionality of the physical search \nportion of FISA, this Court's legal conclusions would be reviewed de novo on appeal.[5] \nIII. \nAs a related grounds for recusal, the Defendant emphasizes that this Judge receivedex \nparte information during the FISA proceedings. The case law, though, does not require a recusal in \nsuch circumstances. \nIn addition to the aforementioned cases, this Court has examined decisions in which a district judge \nreviewed FISA surveillance material ex parte and in camera. With the exception of one case cited by \nthe Defendant, United States v. McKinley, 995 F.2d 1020 586*586 (11th Cir.1993), no other judge \nrecused himself after conducting an in camera ex parte review.[6] Furthermore, the Eleventh Circuit \ndid not comment on the propriety of the trial judge's recusal in McKinley, and that court had \npreviously condoned ex parte review in Isa, 923 F.2d at 1306. \nThe Defendant claims that the courts which have upheld pre-arrest surveillance warrants permitted \n\"full and unfettered access to the warrant and its underlying application.\" Def.Mot. at 7. This Court \nknows of no instance in which a court has required disclosure or an adversary hearing in \ndetermining the legality of a FISA surveillance. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings, Grand Jury No. \n87-4, 856 F.2d 685, 686 n. 3 (4th Cir.1988) (\"So far, every FISA wiretap review has been in \ncamera andex parte\"). \nIV. \nOn February 9, 1995, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12949, which expanded FISA to \ninclude physical searches. The Defendant has informed the Court that he intends to challenge the \nconstitutionality of this expansion of FISA. The Defendant argues: \nThis case will present the first constitutional challenge of the FISA Court's authority to order physical \nsearches without conventional warrants.... Mr. Nicholson and the public are entitled to, in the first \n\nmajor attack on the search aspects of FISA, a judge without past involvement in FISA activities.... In \nshort, Mr. Nicholson's constitutional challenge — the first of its kind since enactment of the search \nwarrant provisions of FISA — should be resolved by a jurist having no prior involvement with FISA \ncourt proceedings. \nDef.Mot. at 3, 5. \nThis Court expresses no opinion as to whether the constitutional protections differ for physical \nsearches versus electronic surveillance searches. The Court will note, however, that this case would \nbe far from the first to examine the constitutionality of FISA.[7] \nThis Court holds, and will maintain, an open mind concerning any novel challenges this Defendant \nraises concerning FISA. The Court emphasizes, however, the scope of United States v. Pelton, 835 \nF.2d 1067 (4th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1010, 108 S.Ct. 1741, 100 L.Ed.2d 204 (1988). In \nthat case, the Fourth Circuit considered the defendant's argument that \nanything less than the traditional probable cause standard for the issuance of a search warrant \nviolates the Fourth Amendment. He [the defendant] contends that the need for foreign intelligence \ndoes not justify any exception to the warrant requirement. We [the Fourth Circuit] disagree. \n587*587 Pelton, 835 F.2d at 1075.[8] \nThe Fourth Circuit further held that \n[w]e find the provisions of FISA to be `reasonable both in relation to the legitimate need of the \nGovernment for intelligence information and the protected rights of our citizens,' ... and therefore \ncompatible with the Fourth Amendment. \nId. (quotation omitted). In short, in Pelton, the Fourth Circuit ruled that FISA, as it existed prior to \n1995, was wholly constitutional. \nIn support of his contention that a sitting member of the FISA Court should recuse himself from \nruling on the constitutionality of FISA, the Defendant relies on the opinion of Justice Breyer, then \nChief Judge of the First Circuit, concerning recusal.United States v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437, 445-447 \n(1st Cir.1989) (Breyer, J., writing separately); see also United States v. Glick, 946 F.2d 335, 336 (4th \nCir.1991)(expressing agreement with Justice Breyer's analysis in Wright). As a member of the \nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Justice Breyer had been \"extensively involved in the drafting \nand promulgation of the [Sentencing] guidelines.\" Glick, 946 F.2d at 336. As the Defendant \naccurately notes, Def.Mot. at 4, Justice Breyer received recommendations from the Justice \nDepartment and wrote that he would recuse himself in instances in which \"there is a substantial \nchallenge, whether constitutional or not, mounted against the existence of the Guidelines system \nand hence of the Sentencing Commission itself.\" Wright, 873 F.2d at 447. Justice Breyer, though, \n\ncontinued his analysis by stating that this category of cases requiring recusal \"does not include those \ncases in which a challenge to the Guidelines, if successful, may require a substantial revision of the \nGuidelines, but will not jeopardize the continued existence of the Guidelines system.\" Id. \nThe Fourth Circuit, whose precedents govern this Court, has ruled that the FISA Court is \nconstitutional, and held that FISA as enacted prior to the 1995 expansion \"meets constitutional \nrequirements.\" Pelton, 835 F.2d at 1075. In the case at bar, the Defendant's challenge to the \nphysical search element of FISA, \"if successful, may require a substantial revision of\" FISA, but such \na challenge would not \"jeopardize the continued existence of\" FISA or the FISA Court. Accordingly, \neven if it were appropriate to adopt Justice Breyer's standard, application of that position would \ncutagainst recusal in the case at bar. \nIn other instances, the fact that a judge created a given procedure did not require recusal from \nsubsequent challenges to those rules.[9] Importantly, this Judge did not create FISA or the FISA \nCourt, nor did he have any role in their creation. His presence on the FISA Court is most properly \nanalogized to his role as an Article III judge.[10] \n588*588 Furthermore, this Court knows of at least two instances in which a sitting member of the \nFISA Court examined the legality of materials obtained pursuant to FISA. In re Grand Jury \nProceedings, Grand Jury No. 87-4, 856 F.2d 685, 687 (4th Cir.1988); United States v. \nHawamda, 1989 WL 235836 (E.D.Va. April 17, 1989); see also In the Matter of Kevork, 634 F.Supp. \n1002 (U.S. District Judge Lacey sat as a member of a special Commission which interviewed \nindividuals about materials obtained via FISA, and then, in his judicial capacity during subsequent \ncriminal proceedings, conducted an in camera ex parte review of FISA materials and ruled FISA to \nbe constitutional). In one of those cases, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court's in \ncamera review of FISA materials after a District Judge in this Court, then a sitting member of the \nFISA Court, had ruled twice on the legality of wiretaps authorized pursuant to FISA. In re Grand Jury \nProceedings, 856 F.2d at 687. \nV. \nApplying the law as set forth in Liteky and elsewhere, the Court finds that adequate grounds to \nrequire recusal of this Judge do not exist. A reasonable person who examines this case and the \napplicable legal precedents would not find a reasonable factual basis to question the Court's \nimpartiality. The case law overwhelmingly speaks against recusal in this case. Any additional \ninformation concerning this case would have been obtained by this Judge solely through prior \njudicial proceedings in this case, \"an indisputedly legitimate source of supplemental facts.\" United \nStates v. Gordon, 61 F.3d 263, 268 (4th Cir.1995) (citation omitted).[11] \nAccordingly, the Defendant's Motion is hereby DENIED. \n\nAn appropriate Order shall issue. \nORDER \nFor the reasons stated in the attached Memorandum Opinion, it is hereby ORDERED that: \n(1) the Defendant's Motion which requests that this Judge recuse himself is DENIED; \n(2) the scheduling order remains the same; and \n(3) the Clerk of the Court shall forthwith provide a copy of this Order and Memorandum Opinion to all \nCounsel of Record. \n[1] The Defendant has also asked this Court to order discovery on four issues, including the \"procedures and principles\" \ngoverning FISA applications, without seeking the Government's prior approval. See Local Rule 37. The Court will not grant \nsuch discovery at this time, but notes that the FISA procedures have been public for some time. See In the Matter of \nKevork, 634 F.Supp. 1002 (C.D.Cal.1985), aff'd, 788 F.2d 566 (9th Cir.1986). \n[2] The Court will not alter this scheduling order. \n[3] That decision was consistent with an earlier case within that Circuit, Union Independiente de Empleados de Servicios \nLegales, 550 F.Supp. 1109. \n[4] The Defendant also relies on inapposite cases in which the judge received information via extrajudicial means. See, \ne.g., United States v. Looney, 501 F.2d 1039, 1040 (4th Cir.1974) (judge confronted witness in a \"room near the courtroom,\" \noutside of the judicial proceedings). \n[5] The Court is aware of one case, albeit from another circuit, in which the denial of a suppression motion was reviewed \nunder an abuse of discretion standard in a FISA case. See Miller, 984 F.2d at 1032. However, the trial court in Miller had \ndenied the motion as untimely, in violation of Rule 12(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, rather than on legal \nor factual grounds. Accordingly, Miller is of little help to the Defendant on this issue. \n[6] See, e.g., United States v. Isa, 923 F.2d 1300, 1306 (8th Cir.1991); United States v. Hamide, 914 F.2d 1147, 1152-53 \n(9th Cir.1990); United States v. Posey, 864 F.2d 1487, 1490-91 (9th Cir.1989); United States v. Sarkissian, 841 F.2d 959, \n964 (9th Cir.1988); United States v.

Pelton, 835 F.2d 1067 (4th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1010, 108 S.Ct. 1741, 100 L.Ed.2d 204 \n(1988), and n. 5, below; see also United States v. Cavanagh, 807 F.2d 787, 790-92 (9th Cir.1987);Belfield, 692 F.2d at \n148 (D.C. Circuit rejected argument that FISA violates Fifth and Sixth Amendments);Spanjol, 720 F.Supp. at 58; United \nStates v. Ott, 637 F.Supp. 62 (E.D.Cal.1986), aff'd, 827 F.2d 473 (9th Cir. 1987); In the Matter of Kevork, 634 F.Supp. at \n1010; Hovsepian, 1985 WL 5970 at *2; Falvey, 540 F.Supp. at 1312-13; see also Ellsberg v. Mitchell, 709 F.2d 51, 66 n. 66 \n(D.C.Cir.1983), cert. denied, sub nom Russo v. Mitchell, 465 U.S. 1038, 104 S.Ct. 1316, 79 L.Ed.2d 712 (1984) (noting that \nFISA had theretofore survived all constitutional challenges). \n[8] The Second Circuit expressed the same opinion in United States v. Duggan: \nA fortiori we reject defendants' argument that a FISA order may not be issued consistent with the requirements of the Fourth \nAmendment unless there is a showing of probable cause to believe the target has committed a crime. \n\n743 F.2d at 73 n. 5. The First Circuit has also dismissed as \"without merit\" the argument that \"the FISA provisions governing \nthe surveillance of United States citizens contravene the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of warrantless searches.\" United \nStates v. Johnson, 952 F.2d 565, 573 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 816, 113 S.Ct. 58, 121 L.Ed.2d 27 (1992). Thus, \nall the Circuits to assess the issue have ruled that FISA is constitutional. \n[9] Though the Supreme Court promulgated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\"Rules\"), its members did not recuse \nthemselves from considering the \"validity, meaning or consistency\" of those Rules. Mississippi Publishing Corp. v. \nMurphree, 326 U.S. 438, 444, 66 S.Ct. 242, 245, 90 L.Ed. 185 (1946). Similarly, the Circuit Courts of Appeals have \nadjudicated the legality of their own local rules. See, e.g., Home Life Ins. Co. N.Y. v. Equitable Equip. Co., Inc., 694 F.2d \n402, 403 (5th Cir.1982). \n[10] The [FISA] Act merely directs judges to make findings regarding the time, persons, and places at which the surveillance \nis directed and regarding governmental compliance with the procedures of the Act, in accordance with objective definitions \nprovided within the Act itself. The determinations to be made are not unlike the determinations of fact and law made \nthroughout the judicial process in a wide variety of other contexts. \nJohnson, 1990 WL 78522 at *7 (quoting Megahey, 553 F.Supp. at 1198); accord Hovsepian, 1985 WL 5970 at *3. \n[11] As a final point, the Court notes the timing of this Motion. At the arraignment on December 20, 1996, the Court advised \nall of the parties of his participation in prior FISA proceedings. During the subsequent five weeks, this Court has been very \nactively involved in this case. Specifically, the Court arraigned the Defendant on the superseding indictment; imposed the \nprotective order; set a trial date; granted the Defendant's motion for a continuance of the trial date; corresponded with \ndefense counsel regarding additional compensation and expedited payment of counsel fees for defense counsel; assisted in \nensuring that all defense attorneys received the requisite security clearances as expeditiously as possible; coordinated a \nsecure room within the courthouse which the Defendant and his counsel could use to examine documents; heard argument \nand ruled on a potential detention site for the Defendant; denied the Defendant's motion to revoke the detention order; \npermitted the Defendant to file an ex parte motion under seal; granted the Defendant's motion to file an ex partestatement of \nmateriality; set hearing dates pursuant to CIPA; and granted requests from the Defendant for visitors. At no time during the \nfive weeks has the Defendant or counsel for the Defendant in any way mentioned this Court's FISA involvement as a \ngrounds for recusal. ",

      "text": " \n \n955 F.Supp. 588 (1997) \nUNITED STATES of America \nv. \nHarold NICHOLSON, Defendant. \nCriminal No. 96-448-A. \nUnited States District Court, E.D. Virginia, Alexandria Division. \nFebruary 14, 1997. \n589*589 Helen F. Fahey, United States Attorney, Alexandria, VA, for Plaintiff. \nJonathan Shapiro, Alexandria, VA, Liam O'Grady, Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner \nP.C., Washington, DC, for Defendant. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nCACHERIS, Chief Judge. \nThis matter comes before the Court on Defendant Harold J. Nicholson's (\"Defendant's\") Motion to \nSuppress All Evidence Derived from Searches or Seizures Conducted Pursuant to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act (\"Motion\"). In this Motion, Defendant attacks the constitutionality of \nFISA in general and as applied in this case.[1] 590*590 For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's \nMotion is DENIED. \nI. \nThe Defendant is charged with Espionage, Attempted Espionage, and Conspiracy to Commit \nEspionage, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 794. In the course of the investigation that led to \nDefendant's arrest and indictment, Defendant's home, office, car, safe deposit box, and personal \neffects were subject to electronic surveillance and physical searches conducted under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801 et seq. (\"FISA\"). Defendant now asks this \nCourt to suppress evidence derived from these searches. Additionally, although the schedule for \n\nargument of this issue and related discovery issues was set by unanimous agreement of the parties \nand the Court, Defendant now argues that this schedule \"is an arbitrary and disabling restraint on the \nability of Mr. Nicholson to present a full and fair defense.\" Def.Mot. at 28.[2] \nII. \nIn the twenty years since it was enacted, FISA has been upheld as constitutional by every court to \naddress the issue.[3] Against this backdrop, Defendant asserts numerous grounds for suppression in \nthis case, claiming that (1) electronic surveillance under FISA violates the Fourth Amendment's \nwarrant requirement; (2) physical searches under FISA likewise violate the Fourth Amendment; and \nthat FISA procedures violate (3) the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fifth \nAmendment; (4) the Right to Counsel provided by the Sixth Amendment; (5) Article III of the United \nStates Constitution; (6) the Political Question Doctrine; and (7) the doctrine of the Separation of \nPowers. \nA. FISA Satisfies the Requirements of the Fourth \nAmendment. \nNumerous challenges to FISA have arisen under the Fourth Amendment, which protects the \"right of \nthe people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable \nsearches and seizures. ...\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. Most notable among these cases is United States \nv. Pelton, 835 F.2d 1067, 1075 (4th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1010, 108 S.Ct. 1741, 100 \nL.Ed.2d 204 (1988),which constitutes binding precedent for this Court. In that case, the Fourth \nCircuit held that \nthe provisions of FISA [are] \"reasonable both in relation to the legitimate need of the Government for \nintelligence information and the protected rights of our citizens,\" ... and therefore compatible with the \nFourth Amendment. \nId. (quoting United States v. United States District Court, 407 U.S. 297, 327, 92 S.Ct. 2125, 2141-42, \n32 L.Ed.2d 752 (1972) (\"Keith\")).[4] In short, the Fourth Circuit 591*591ruled in Pelton that FISA, as it \nexisted at that time, was wholly constitutional.[5] \nOn February 9, 1995, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12949, which expanded FISA to \ninclude physical searches. Since this change, no court has addressed the constitutionality of any \nFISA provision. Accordingly, although bound byPelton and other precedent regarding electronic \nsurveillance and the general procedural framework of FISA, this Court addresses the narrow issue of \nphysical searches under FISA as a matter of first impression.[6] \nDefendant relies heavily on Judge Leventhal's concurrence in United States v. Ehrlichman, 546 F.2d \n910 (D.C.Cir.1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1120, 97 S.Ct. 1155, 51 L.Ed.2d 570 (1977), for the \n\nproposition that physical searches are more invasive than electronic surveillance.[7] A similar \nargument was addressed thirty years ago by the Supreme Court in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. \n347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). In Katz, the Supreme Court held that \"the reach of the \n[Fourth] Amendment can not turn upon the presence or absence of physical intrusion into any given \nenclosure,\" since the Amendment protects the privacy of persons, not places. 389 U.S. at 353, 88 \nS.Ct. at 512.[8] More recently, the Supreme Court has recognized explicitly that \"[t]he Fourth \nAmendment does not prohibit per se a covert entry performed for the purpose of installing otherwise \nlegal electronic bugging equipment.\" Dalia v. United States, 441 U.S. 238, 248, 99 S.Ct. 1682, 1689, \n60 L.Ed.2d 177 (1979).[9] It is thus apparent that Fourth Amendment jurisprudence regards physical \nentry and electronic surveillance on an even plane, with each subject to the reasonableness \nrequirement of the Fourth Amendment. See Keith, 407 U.S. at 321-24, 92 S.Ct. at 2138-40. \nDefendant's argument that physical searches are per se more intrusive that electronic surveillance is \nunavailing in light of Katz. While physical search of a residence will expose one's personal effects to \nthe government, it will seldom allow the government to invade the bodily privacy of the subject, and \nthat of innocent visitors, in the way that extended video and aural surveillance can and often \ndoes.[10]Accordingly, the physical searches in question here are constitutionally indistinguishable \nfrom the FISA-authorized electronic surveillance unanimously upheld by federal courts. \n592*592 B. FISA Violates neither the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment nor the Right to \nCounsel Provided by the Sixth Amendment. \nDefendant argues that the ex parte in camera review authorized by FISA violates rights protected by \nthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Notably, Defendant has offered no case law to support this \nassertion, and this Court knows of no instance in which a court has required an adversary hearing or \ndisclosure in determining the legality of a FISA surveillance. To the contrary, every court examining \nFISA-obtained evidence has conducted its review in camera and ex parte. See In re Grand Jury \nProceedings, Grand Jury No. 87-4, 856 F.2d 685, 686 n. 3 (4th Cir.1988) (\"So far, every FISA \nwiretap review has been in camera and ex parte\").[11] Based on the unanimous holdings of prior case \nlaw, this Court holds that FISA does not violate the Fifth or Sixth Amendments by authorizing ex \nparte in camera review. See United States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141 (D.C.Cir.1982) (FISA \nprocedures do not violate the Sixth Amendment). \nDefendant also asserts that the terms \"agent of a foreign power\" and \"foreign intelligence \ninformation,\" as used in FISA, are impermissibly vague in violation of the Due Process Clause of \nFifth Amendment. However, Defendant cites no case law that supports this conclusion. In United \nStates v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59, 71 (2d Cir.1984),the Second Circuit dismissed a similar challenge \nbecause \"the government plainly had a basis under [FISA] for describing the information sought by \nsurveillance of [the defendant] as foreign intelligence information.\" This Court makes a similar finding \n\nregarding the Defendant. Moreover, Defendant fails to aver, as required, that Defendant himself was \nsomehow harmed in this case by such alleged vagueness.See Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. \n453, 467, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 1928-29, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1951). \nC. Surveillance in this Case did not Violate the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \nDefendant next argues that FISA is based on invidious distinctions between agents of foreign, as \nopposed to domestic, powers. As an initial matter, and as set forth above, this Court holds that FISA \ndoes not violate any fundamental constitutionally-protected rights of surveillance subjects. \nAccordingly, this Court subjects FISA to rationality review and again adopts the reasoning of the \nSecond Circuit in Duggan, holding that disparate treatment of foreign and domestic groups \nis rationally related to the \"Act's purposes of attempting to protect the United States against various \ntypes of acts of foreign powers and to acquire information necessary to the national defense or the \nconduct of foreign affairs.\" \n743 F.2d at 75-76 (citation omitted). Accordingly, FISA does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. \nD. Surveillance in this Case did not Violate Article III \nor the Doctrine of the Separation of Powers. \nNext, Defendant submits that by asking Article III judges to adjudicate search requests, FISA \nviolates Article III and the Separation of Powers doctrine. Every court that has addressed the issue \nhas held that an Article III judge is properly \"acting in his judicial capacity\" when sitting on the FISA \nCourt. United States v. Johnson, 1990 WL 78522, at *7 (D.Mass. Apr. 13, 1990), aff'd, 593*593 952 \nF.2d 565 (2d Cir.1991),cert. denied, 506 U.S. 816, 113 S.Ct. 58, 121 L.Ed.2d 27 (1992).[12] In United \nStates v. Cavanagh, 807 F.2d 787, 791-92 (9th Cir.1987), then-Judge Kennedy upheld FISA against \na similar challenge. This Court follows this unbroken line of established case law and holds that \nDefendant's challenge to FISA under Article III and the Separation of Powers doctrine is without \nmerit. \nE. Surveillance in this Case did not Violate the \nPolitical Question Doctrine. \nFinally, Defendant claims that FISA procedures violate the Political Question Doctrine. Again, this \nCourt follows the unanimous holdings of other federal courts and rules that this claim is without \nmerit. See Duggan, 743 F.2d at 74; Johnson, 1990 WL 78522, at *6; Hovsepian, 1985 WL 5970, at \n*2.[13] \n\nAccordingly, Defendant's Motion to Suppress is DENIED. An appropriate Order shall issue. \n[1] Defendant has acknowledged that other courts have previously addressed all but one of Defendant's present claims and \nunanimously upheld FISA as constitutional. Defendant indicates that he has raised these points here to insure that they are \npreserved for appeal. See, e.g., Def.Mot. at 9 n. 7. \n[2] Because the Government and defense counsel mutually agreed to the present schedule, the Court will not disturb the \nchosen dates now. \n[3] See United States v. Cavanagh, 807 F.2d 787, 790-92 (9th Cir.1987) (per then-Circuit Judge Kennedy) (rejecting \nargument that FISA violates the Fourth Amendment and Article III); United States v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59 (2d \nCir.1984) (rejecting challenges to FISA under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and under the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment); United States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141, 148 (D.C.Cir.1982)(rejecting argument that FISA \nviolates Fifth and Sixth Amendments); United States v. Spanjol, 720 F.Supp. 55, 58 (E.D.Pa. 1989) (rejecting challenge to \nFISA under the Fourth Amendment); United States v. Ott, 637 F.Supp. 62 (E.D.Cal.1986), aff'd, 827 F.2d 473 (9th \nCir.1987) (rejecting challenge to FISA under the Due Process Clause); In the Matter of Kevork, 634 F.Supp. 1002 \n(C.D.Cal.1985) (rejecting challenges to FISA under the Fourth Amendment and Article III); United States v. Falvey, 540 \nF.Supp. 1306 (E.D.N.Y.1982) (rejecting challenges to FISA under the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments); see \nalso Ellsberg v. Mitchell, 709 F.2d 51, 66 n. 66 (D.C.Cir.1983) (noting that FISA had theretofore survived all constitutional \nchallenges), cert. denied, sub nom. Russo v. Mitchell, 465 U.S. 1038, 104 S.Ct. 1316, 79 L.Ed.2d 712 (1984). \n[4] The Second Circuit similarly applied this reasonableness analysis in United States v. Duggan: \nA fortiori we reject defendants' argument that a FISA order may not be issued consistent with the requirements of the Fourth \nAmendment unless there is a showing of probable cause to believe the target has committed a crime. 743 F.2d at 73 n. 5. \nThe First Circuit has also dismissed as \"without merit\" the argument that \"the FISA provisions governing the surveillance of \nUnited States citizens contravene the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of warrantless searches.\" United States v. \nJohnson, 952 F.2d 565, 573 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 816, 113 S.Ct. 58, 121 L.Ed.2d 27 (1992). \n[5] In United States v. Truong Dinh Hung, 629 F.2d 908, 916-17 (4th Cir.1980), the Fourth Circuit ratified the existence of a \n\"foreign intelligence exception\" to the warrant requirement. While Truong was decided based on pre-FISA events, this Court \nholds in the alternative that Defendant's Fourth Amendment claims fail under Truongas well. \n[6] Defendant's argument on this point seems to conflate two issues: the higher Fourth Amendment standard generally \napplied to searches of a person's home and the allegedly more intrusive nature of physical as opposed to electronic \nsearches. Since courts reviewing FISA-authorized electronic surveillance of a suspect's home unanimously have found such \nsurveillance constitutional, this Court focuses on Defendant's claim that physical searches must be reviewed under a more \nstringent constitutional standard than that applied to electronic surveillance. \n[7] Aside from this dictum, Defendant cites no jurisprudential authority supporting the proposition that physical searches \nrequire a heightened standard of review. The Court is aware of no case that so holds. \n[8] Katz explicitly overruled Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 48 S.Ct. 564, 72 L.Ed. 944 (1928), which had \nestablished the same talismanic formalism that Defendant now seeks to revive by crafting a per se rule regarding physical \nsearch. See Katz, 389 U.S. at 353, 88 S.Ct. at 512. \n[9] This type of entry clearly is contemplated by the procedures upheld in Pelton. See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1804(a)(8) and \n1805(b)(1)(D); see, e.g., Kevork, 634 F.Supp. at 1005 (bugs placed within home of non-defendant);Duggan 743 F.2d at \n66 (bug placed within home). \n[10] See United States v. Koyomejian, 946 F.2d 1450, 1459 (9th Cir.1992) (FISA-permissible video monitoring deemed \"the \nmost intrusive form of surveillance\"); United States v. Mesa-Rincon, 911 F.2d 1433, 1437 (10th Cir.1990) (noting an \nexample of the \"vastly ... intrusive\" nature of video surveillance). \n[11] See, e.g., United States v. Isa, 923 F.2d 1300, 1306 (8th Cir.1991); United States v. Hamide, 914 F.2d 1147, 1152-53 \n(9th Cir.1990); United States v. Posey, 864 F.2d 1487, 1490-91 (9th Cir.1989); United States v. Sarkissian, 841 F.2d 959, \n964 (9th Cir.1988); United States v. Badia, 827 F.2d 1458, 1463-64 (11th Cir.1987),cert. denied, 485 U.S. 937, 108 S.Ct. \n1115, 99 L.Ed.2d 275 (1988); Ott, 827 F.2d 473 (9th Cir.1987); Belfield,692 F.2d 141, 146-47 (D.C.Cir.1982); United States \nv. Rahman, 861 F.Supp. 247, 250-51 (S.D.N.Y.1994);United States v. Thomson, 752 F.Supp. 75, 79 \n(W.D.N.Y.1990); United States v. Johnson, 1990 WL 78522, at *1 (D.Mass. Apr. 13, 1990); United States v. Spanjol, 720 \n\nF.Supp. 55, 58-59 (E.D.Pa.1989); United States v. Hawamda, 1989 WL 235836, at *1 (E.D.Va. April 17, 1989); Kevork, 634 \nF.Supp. 1002; United States v. Hovsepian, 1985 WL 5970, at *2 (C.D.Cal. Jan. 28, 1985); Falvey, 540 F.Supp. 1306; In re \nFlanagan, 533 F.Supp. 957, 961 (E.D.N.Y.), rev'd on other grounds, 691 F.2d 116 (2d Cir.1982). \n[12] See, e.g., United States v. Hovsepian, 1985 WL 5970, *3 (C.D.Cal. Jan. 28, 1985); United States v. Megahey, 553 \nF.Supp. 1180, 1196-98 (E.D.N.Y.1982), aff'd, sub nom. United States v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59 (2d Cir.1984). \n[13] In a footnote to his Motion, Defendant argues that FISA has an impermissible chilling effect on speech protected by the \nFirst Amendment. Def. Mot. at 24 n. 21. However, FISA explicitly provides that \"no United States person may be considered \na foreign power or agent of a foreign power solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States....\" 50 U.S.C. § 1805; seeACLU v. Barr, 952 F.2d 457, 464 n. 5 (9th Cir. 1991); Falvey, 540 \nF.Supp at 1314. For the reasons set forth inBarr and Falvey, FISA does not violate the First Amendment. ",
