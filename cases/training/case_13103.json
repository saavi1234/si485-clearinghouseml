    "summary": "<p>For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA matters, see our <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">special collection</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 17, 2014, following the disclosure of various dragnet National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance programs by Edward Snowden, the Director of National Intelligence authorized the declassification and public release of numerous orders approving the NSA's so-called \"Bulk Telephony Metadata Program\" under Section 501 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (\"FISA\"), commonly referred to as Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. A press release is available <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2014/item/1002-statement-from-dni-james-r-clapper-on-intelligence-reforms-announced-today-by-president-obama\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Under the program, the NSA collected records from large telecommunication companies; virtually all domestic telephone calls. These records, termed \"telephone metadata,\" include the phone numbers placed and received; the date, time and duration of calls; some location identifiers; and calling card numbers. The records did not, however, include the parties' names, addresses, or financial information or the call's content.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The program began under executive authority alone following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Subsequently, in 2006, the federal government first sought approval of the program from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. This Section 215 order was reviewed and reapproved by the FISC essentially every 90 days. It was approved dozens of times by many different federal judges, on the FISC, following its initial approval on May 24, 2006 by the FISC. (See <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13069\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BR 06-05</a>.)</p>\r\n<p>(The government encountered substantial backlash as a result of the disclosure of the Bulk Telephony Metadata Program. While this case was ongoing, on May 27, 2015, a federal circuit court in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12867\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ACLU v. Clapper</a>&nbsp;held that Section 215 did not authorize this program. Then, on June 2, 2015, Congress passed the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015, which prohibited the bulk collection of telephony metadata under Section 215. Instead, the telephone companies now retain this telephony metadata, and to obtain any such metadata the government is required to submit applications for a specific target based on a \"specific selection term.\" This application must be approved by the FISC.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 7, 2013, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Media Freedom and Information Access of Yale Law School (collectively, &ldquo;movants&rdquo;) filed a motion in the FISC for release of court records, including opinions that addressed the legal basis for the bulk collection of data under FISA. The movants argued that the First Amendment compelled release of these judicial decisions and that FISC Rule 62 gave the FISC discretion to publish its own orders, opinions, and decisions. The ACLU had previously moved for the FISC to release opinions that interpreted Section 215 of FISA, under docket Misc. 13-02. (See <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13091\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Misc. 13-02</a>.) The litigation under Misc. 13-02 was still ongoing at the time the ACLU filed this case, but Misc. 13-02 was limited to the disclosure of opinions that addressed only Section 215 of FISA, not all bulk collection programs.</p>\r\n<p>The government opposed the motion, arguing that all the relevant opinions had already been released and that the FISC should not order the government to conduct a separate classification. The government also argued that the movants lacked standing and that the FISC did not typically involve itself in the declassification process. On December 5, 2013, FISC Judge Reggie Walton permitted the motion of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and a group of 25 media organizations to file a brief as amici curiae in support of the movants.</p>\r\n<p>The case remained pending until 2017. Before then, the movants filed several notices of supplemental authority, informing the FISC regarding relevant new court decisions and statutes. Specifically, on October 30, 2014, the movants filed a notice based on<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14676\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Dhiab v. Obama</a>, where a federal district court ordered that video evidence from a Guantanamo Bay habeas corpus proceeding be released. On December 4, 2015, the movants filed a second notice citing Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act, 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1872, which requires the Director of National Intelligence to conduct declassification reviews of &ldquo;each decision, order, or opinion issued by&rdquo; the FISC or FISCR. The movants claimed that this statute reflected Congress&rsquo;s support for the publication of FISC opinions.</p>\r\n<p>On January 25, 2017, however, FISC Judge Rosemary M. Collyer issued an opinion and order dismissing this case. Judge Collyer noted that the opinions that the movants sought were already released, so what the movants actually sought was access to the redacted material in those opinions that remain classified. She concluded, however, that the First Amendment did not provide a qualified right of access to FISC opinions. Without such a right, the movants could not have standing. 2017 WL 427591.</p>\r\n<p>On February 21, 2017, the movants filed a new motion to alter or amend the court's January 25, 2017 opinion. The movants claimed that the court's opinion contradicted previous FISC rulings and that the grounds for the court's decision was not briefed by any party. On March 22, 2017, pursuant to FISC Rule 49, the court issued an order for en banc&mdash;that is, with all the judges of the FISC&mdash;reconsideration of whether the movants had standing.</p>\r\n<p>Because Judge Collyer's analysis of the standing issue conflicted with the analysis of another FISC judge in a similar case, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13091\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re Orders of This Court Interpreting Section 215 of the Patriot Act, No. Misc. 13&ndash;02</a>, 2013 WL 5460064 (FISC Sept. 13, 2013) (directing the government to publish a FISC opinion),&nbsp;the FISC judges without a motion decided to granted en banc reconsideration of Judge Collyer's order &ldquo;on the ground that it is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of the court's decisions.&rdquo; In re Bulk Collection, 2017 WL 1500037, at *1 (FISC Mar. 22, 2017) (citing FISC Rule of Procedure 49). Subsequently, in an opinion issued on November 9, 2017, the en banc court held, by a six-to-five vote, that the movants had established the requisite injury in fact to raise their First Amendment claim. In re Bulk Collection, 2017 WL 5983865 (FISC Nov. 9, 2017) (en banc).</p>\r\n<p>Judge Boasberg, writing for the majority, reasoned that Judge Collyer's initial opinion required too specific of a showing to establish standing. All that was required to show standing was a colorable claim that such a right might exist, even if the claim ultimately failed on the merits. There was no reasonable basis, Judge Boasberg explained, for holding otherwise in the FISA context.</p>\r\n<p>On January 5, 2018, the FISC judges certified the following question for review: &ldquo;Whether Movants have adequately established Article III standing to assert their claim of a qualified First Amendment right of public access to FISC judicial opinions.&rdquo; In re Bulk Collection, 2018 WL 396244, at *2 (FISC Jan. 5, 2018). On January 9, 2018, the FISCR accepted the certification. It appointed an amicus curiae, Prof. Laura Donohue.</p>\r\n<p>On March 16, 2018, the FISC affirmed, agreeing with the majority of the FISC judges that the movants had standing to seek disclosure of the classified portions of the opinions at issue. As the FISC en banc majority explained, standing is a prerequisite to a party's filing suit. It entails a threshold inquiry, one that is separate from the merits of the underlying claim&mdash;and one that requires far less substantiation. Movants need not show that they are ultimately entitled to access the materials in question. Instead, they need only show that their claim is not immaterial nor wholly insubstantial and frivolous. Regardless of whether the movants are entitled to relief on their claim, they have standing to present that question to the court. In re Certification of Questions of Law to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, No. FISCR 18-01, 2018 WL 2709456, at *1 (Foreign Intel. Surv. Ct. Mar. 16, 2018).</p>\r\n<p>On May 1, 2018, Judge Collyer ordered that parties file briefs setting forth the basis for the assertion of FISC subject matter jurisdiction over their claim. Briefs were exchanged on August 1, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>On February 11, 2020, the FISC released their opinion. The court clarified that the movants were seeking a large amount of redacted, nonpublic material in the opinions released addressing the bulk collection of data. The court found that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the Motion for the Release of Court Records but the First Amendment did not confer a qualified right of public access to the material sought nor was there any reason for the court to exercise any discretion it might have had in granting the relief requested. Thus, the Motion for the Release of Court Records was denied and the motion dismissed. 2020 WL 897659.</p>\r\n<p>The movants filed a petition for review or in the alternative a writ of mandamus, functionally an appeal, for the February 11 decision on March 11, 2020. Once the case moved to the FISCR, the case received a new docket number, 20-01.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after the petition for review was filed, the FISCR entered a show cause order on March 13 asking the movants to discuss if the FISCR had jurisdiction to rule on this petition. The movants were given a deadline of March 26 to file a brief and the government was given a deadline of April 6 if it wanted to respond to the brief. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the movants filed an unopposed motion on March 16 to extend the deadlines to file their initial brief to April 27. The FICSR granted this motion in part, setting the new deadline for the movant's show cause brief to April 9 in a March 17 order, but moved the deadline back to April 17 in an April 10 order.</p>\r\n<p>In keeping with the revised schedule, the movants submitted their show cause order on April 17. They urged the FISCR to take the case, highlighting that the FISCR has \"jurisdiction to review the denial of any application made under this chapter.\" They argued that the access petition initially filed was an \"application\" to the FISC because it sought relief from the FISC using 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1803(b) of the FISA statute. The movants added that the FISCR has ancillary jurisdiction over the matter because as an Article III court, it can rule on motions to access its own records, which should include petitions for records access that arrive from the FISC on appellate review. Finally, the movants argued that they had jurisdiction for a writ of mandamus under the All Writs Act, since the FISA statute does not preclude mandamus review and invites the FISCR to \"take such actions . . . as are reasonably necessary to administer [its] responsibilities under the charter.\"</p>\r\n<p>The government filed its response brief arguing against granting jurisdiction on schedule on April 22. It argued that the initial petition was not an \"application\" under FISA because the claim is based in the First Amendment, not the FISA statute itself. It added that, because the court lacked jurisdiction from the FISA statute, it was unable to exercise ancillary or All Writs jurisdiction, because these arguments all depend on the court having jurisdiction from another source.</p>\r\n<p>The FISCR issued an opinion on April 24, 2020, denying jurisdiction to the petition. The panel, composed of Jose Cabranes, Richard C. Tallman, and David B. Sentelle, focused on the definition of \"application\" in other parts of the FISA statute, which include FISA production or nondisclosure orders, directives to an electronic communications provider, and orders approving targeting. Since the petition didn't fall in any of these categories, they held it was not an application for the purposes of the statute. They added that the movants were not the target of a FISA order, so they lacked standing to pursue the claim. They declined to exercise ancillary jurisdiction, noting that the Supreme Court warned that such jurisdiction should be cautiously invoked, and highlighting that the lack of an explicit grant of jurisdiction in this area gave them pause. Finally, they agreed with the government's interpretation of the All Writs Act, stating that it required a grant of jurisdiction elsewhere in the FISA statute to be exercised. 957 F.3d 1344.</p>\r\n<p>This decision dismissed the petition for review or writ of mandamus, and effectively terminated the case in the FISC and FISCR. The case was not appealed to the Supreme Court, and the case is closed.</p>",

After various motions surrounding the specific data the movants were seeking and if the movants had standing to bring the case, Judge Rosemary Collyer denied the motion in 2020, saying that while the movants had standing, the First Amendment does not confer an unqualified right to access the material at issue and that this information should remain classified.

While the \nnews media have a long tradition of fighting for public access to court proceedings and records, \nit is important for this Court to recognize that the public at large possesses this right, and that the \ninterests at stake can be vindicated by anyone.  As the Supreme Court has found, potential harm \nto the public debate and erosion in confidence to the judicial system is an injury that everyone \nshares when access rights are denied. \nAmici are further concerned that the standard that this Court applied in denying standing \nto MFIAC undermines the right of the news media to seek access to court records and \nproceedings.  While it seems that a news organization that intends to report on a public \n2 \n\ncontroversy would be able to satisfy the rule, a court could use it to deny standing to a media \nparty that could not show a prior track record of covering a particular issue. \nAmici additionally emphasize that the documents sought are critically important to \nimproving public understanding of this Court and the federal government's national security \noperations.  The public has a formidable First Amendment interest in hearing directly from this \nCourt about its core judicial activities in interpreting the statutes that give rise to its jurisdiction. \nDisclosures in recent months about the scope, legality and administration ofNSA surveillance \nprograms amplify the need for access and merits attention here. \nCounsel for all parties have consented to the filing of the accompanying brief. \n*** \nPursuant to this Court's order, dated July 18, 2013, and United States Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court R.P. 7(h)(l) and 63, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the \nPress respectfully submits the following information: Bruce D.

The Movants ask the \nCoUrt to \"unseal its opinions addressing the legal basis for the 'bulk collection' of data,, on the \nasserted ground that \"these opinions are subject to the public's First Amendment right of access, \nand no proper basis exists to keep the legal discussion in these opinions secret.\" Mot. for \nRelease of Ct. Records 1.  As will be explained, however, the four opinions the Movants seek \nwere never under seal and were declassified by the Executive Branch and made public with \nredactions in 2014.  Consequently, although characterized as a request for the release of certain \nHereinafter, this motion will be referred to as the \"Motion for the Release of Court \nRecords\" and cited as \"Mot for Release of Ct. Records.,, Documents submitted by the parties \nare available on the Court's public website at http://www.tisc.uscourts.gov/public-filings. \n\nof this Court's judicial opinions, what the Movants actually seek is access to the redacted \nmaterial that remains classified pursuant to the Executive Branch's independent classification \nauthority. \nAs explained in Parts I and Il of the following Discussion, this Court has jurisdiction over \nthe Motion for Release of Court Records only if it presents a case or controversy under Article \nm \nof the Constitution, which in tum requires among other things that the Movants assert an \ninjury to a legally protected interest.  The Movants claim that withholding the opinions in \nquestion contravenes a qualified right of access to those opinions under the First Amendment.  If, \ncontrary to the Movants' interpretation of the law, the First Amendment does not afford a \nqualified right of access to those opinions, they have failed to claim an injury to a legally \nm \nprotected interest.  For reasons explained in Part  of the Discussion, the First Amendment does \nnot apply pursuant to controlling Supreme Court precedent so there is no qualified right of access \nto those opinions. Accordingly, the Court holds that the Movants lack standing under Article m \nand the Court therefore must dismiss the Motion for Release of Court Records for lack of \njurisdiction. \nBy no means does this result mean that the opinions at issue, or others like them, will \nnever see the light of day.  First, the opinions at issue have already been publicly released, \nsubject to Executive Branch declassification review and redactions that withhold portions of \nthose opinions found to contain infonnation that remains classified.  Members of the public \nseeking release of other opinions (or further release of redacted text in the opinions at issue in \nthis matter) may submit requests under the Freedom of lnfonnation Act (\"FOIA\"), 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552, and seek review of the Executive Branch's responses to those requests in a federal district \ncourt.  Finally, as noted infra Part V, Congress has charged Executive Branch officials-not this \n-2-\n\nCourt-with releasing certain significant Court opinions to the public, subject to declassification \nreview.  Those statutory mechanisms for public release are unaffected by the determination that \nthe Court lacks jurisdiction over the instant motion. \nBACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE \nThe Movants filed the pending motion in the wake of unauthorized but widely-publicized \ndisclosures about National Security Agency (\"NSA\") programs involving the bulk collection of \ndata under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, codified as amended at SO U.S.C. \n§§ 1801-188Sc (West201S) (\"PISA\").  The motion urges the Court to unseal its judicial opinions \naddressing the legality of bulk data collection on the ground that the First Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution guarantees that the public shall have a qualified right of access to \njudicial opinions.  Mot for Release of Ct Records I, 2, 12-21. The Movants contend that this \nright of access applies even when national security interests are at stake. Id. at 17.  According to \nthe Movants, the right of access can be overcome only if the United States of America (the \n\"Government\") satisfies a \"strict\" test requiring evidence of a substantial probability of harm to a \ncompelling interest and no alternative means to protect that interest Id. at 3, 21-24, 25, 28. \nEven if the Government demonstrates a substantial probability ofharm to a compelling interest, \nthe Movants maintain that \"(a]ny limits on the public's right of access must ... be narrowly \ntailored and demonstrably effective in avoiding that harm.\" Id. at 3.  The Movants therefore \ninsist that the First Amendment obligates the Court to review independently any portions of the \nCourt's judicial opinions that are being withheld from public disclosure via redaction and assess \nwhether the redaction is sufficiently narrowly tailored to protect only a compelling interest and \nnothing more. Id. at 23. \n-3-\n\nTo conduct this independent review, the Movants suggest that the Court should first \ninvoke Rule 62 of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") Rules of \nProcedure and order the Government to perform a classification review of all judicial opinions \naddressing the legality of bulk data collection. 2 Id. at 24.  If the ordered classification review \nresults in the Government withholding any contents of the Court's opinions by redaction, the \nMovants assert that the Court should schedule the filing of legal briefs to allow the Government \nto set forth the rationale for \"its sealing request\" and to accommodate the Movants' presentation \nof countervailing arguments regarding \"any sealing they believe to be unjustified,\" id, after \nwhich the Court should ''test any sealing proposed by the government against the standard \nrequired by the First Amendment,\" id. at 27.  See also Movants' Reply in Supp. of Their Mot. for \nRelease of Ct. Records 2, 4. The Movants further request that the Court exercise its discretion to \norder a classification review pursuant to FISC Rule 62 even if the Court ultimately concludes \nthat a First Amendment right of access does not apply in this matter.  Id. at 27. \nThe Government opposes the Movants' motion principally because the four opinions that \naddress the legal bases for bulk collection were made public in 2014 after classification reviews \nconducted by the Executive Branch.  Gov't's Opp'n Br. 1-2. Two opinions were published by \nthe Court: \n•  Memorandum, Jn re Application oft he Federal Bureau ofI nvestigation for an \nOrder Requiring the Production of Tangible Things From [Redacted], Docket \nNo.  BR  13-158  (Oct.  11,  2013)  (McLaughlin,  J.),  available  at \nhttp://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/BR%2013-\n158%20Memorandum-1.pdf; and \n2  Rule 62 provides in relevant part that, after consultation with other judges of the court, \nthe Presiding Judge of the FISC may direct that an opinion be published and may order the \nExecutive Branch to review such opinion and \"redact it as necessary to ensure that properly \nclassified information is appropriately protected pursuant to Executive Order 13526 (or its \nsuccessor).\" FISC Rule 62(a). \n-4-\n-\n\n•  Amended Memorandum Opinion, In re Application of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation for an Order Requiring the Production ofT angible Things From \n[Redacted], Docket No. BR 13-109 (Aug. 29, 2013) (Eagan, J.), available at \nhttp://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/BR%  2013-109%200rder \nl.pdf. \nGov't's Opp'n Br. 2.  The other two opinions were released by the Executive Branch: \n•  Opinion and Order, [Redacted], Docket No. PRITT [Redacted] (K.ollar \nKotelly, J.), available at https://www.dni.gov/files/doctiments/1118/ \nCLEANEDPR1'T°/020 l.pdf; and \n•  Memorandum Opinion, [Redacted], Docket No. PR/IT [Redacted] (Bates, J.), \navailable at https://www .dni.gov/files/documents/1118/ \nCLEANEDPRTI'°/0202.pdf. \nId.  The Government submits that, because the Executive Branch already conducted thorough \nclassification reviews of all four opinions before their publication and release, there is no reason \nfor the Court to order the Government to repeat that process. 3 Id.  The Government further \nargues that the motion should be dismissed for lack of the Movants' standing to advance FISC \nRule 62 as a vehicle for publication because that rule permits only a ''party\" to move for \npublication of the Court's opinions. Id. at 3. In support, the Government cites the Court's \ndecision in In re Orders ofT his Court Interpreting Section 215 oft he PATRIOT Act, No. Misc. \n13-02, 2013 WL 5460064 (PISA Ct. Sept. 13, 2013), for the proposition that the term ''party\" in \nRule 62 refers to a \"party\" to the proceeding that resulted in the opinion. Gov't's Opp'n Br. 3. \nThe Government points out that the Movants were not such \"parties\" to any of the proceedings \nthat begot the four opinions discussing the legality of bulk collection. Id.  Finally, the \nGovernment contends that the Court should decline to exercise its own discretion to require the \nExecutive Branch to conduct another classification review of the relevant opinions under Rule \n62--<>r to permit the Movants to challenge the redaction of classified material-because FOIA \n3  The Movants argue that the Executive Branch's classification reviews were insufficient \nand resulted in the four declassified opinions being \"redacted to shreds.\" Movants' Reply In \nSupp. of Their Mot. for Release of Ct. Records 8. \n-5-\n\nsupplies the proper legal mechanism to seek access to classified material withheld by the \nExecutive Branch. Id. at 3-4.  According to the Government, the FISC is not empowered to \nreview independently and/or override Executive Branch classification decisions, id. at 4-6, nor \nshould the FISC serve as an alternate forum to duplicate the judicial review afforded by FOIA, \nid. at 3-4. \nDISCUSSION \nBefore proceeding to consider the merits of the pending motion the Court must first \nm \nestablish with certainty that it has jurisdiction. Because the FISC is an Article  court,4 it \ncannot exercise the judicial power to resolve the Movants' motion unless there is an actual \"case \nor controversy\" in which the Movants have standing. See Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. \n1540, 1547 (May 16, 2016) (discussing the constitutional limits on the exercise ofj udicial \npower).  ''No principle is more fundamental to the judiciary's proper role in our system of \ngovernment than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or \ncontroversies\" as set forth in Article m of the Constitution. Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., \n426 U.S. 26, 37 (1976).  By framing the exercise ofj udicial power in terms of\"cases or \ncontroversies,\" Article III recognizes: \n[T]wo complementary but somewhat different limitations.  In part those words \nlimit the business of federal courts to questions presented in an adversary context \nand in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial \nprocess.  And in part those words define the role assigned to the judiciary in a \ntripartite allocation of power to assure that the federal courts will not intrude into \nareas committed to the other branches of government \n4  See In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 731 (PISA Ct. Rev. 2002) (percuriam) (indicating \nm \nthat \"the constitutional bounds that restrict an Article  court\" apply to the FISC); In re Kevork, \n634 F. Supp. 1002, 1014 (C.D. Cal. 1985) (rejecting the assertion that the FISC \"is not a proper \nArticle III court\"), affd, 788 F.2d 566 (9th Cir. 1986). \n-6-\n\nFlast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 95 (1968). As will be discussed, the separation-of-powers concern \nposes particular unease in this case. \n\"From Article ill's limitation of the judicial power to resolving 'Cases' and \n'Controversies,' and the separation-of-powers principles underlying that limitation, [the Supreme \nCourt bas] deduced a set of requirements that together make up the 'irreducible constitutional \nminimum of standing.\"' Lexmark Int 'I, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 134 S. Ct 1377, \n1386 (2014) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. SSS, 560 (1992)). This doctrine \nof standing is an \"essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of \nArticle III ....\"  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. \"In fact, standing is perhaps the most important \njurisdictional doctrine, and, as with any jurisdictional requisite, we are powerless to bear a case \nwhen it is lacking.\" Bochese v. Town ofP once Inlet, 405 F.3d 964, 974 (I Ith Cir. 2005) \n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  As the Supreme Court has observed: \nIn essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the \ncourt decide  the  merits  of the dispute  or of particular issues.  This  inquiry \ninvolves  both  constitutional  limitations  on  federal-court  jurisdiction  and \nprudential limitations on its exercise.  In both dimensions it is founded in concern \nabout the proper-and properly  limited-role of the  courts  in  a democratic \nsociety. \nIn  its  constitutional  dimension,  standing  imports  justiciability:  whether  the \nplaintiff has made out a \"case or controversy\" between himself and the defendant \nwithin the meaning of Art. III.  This is the threshold question in every federal \ncase, determining the power of the court to entertain the suit. \nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n-7-\n\nI. \nAccordingly, at the outset, the Court is obligated to ensure that it can properly entertain \nthe Movants' motion because they have met their burden of establishing standing sufficient to \nsatisfy the Article m requirement of a case or controversy. DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 541 \nU.S. 332, 342 (2006).  To do so, the Movants \"must clearly and specifically set forth facts \nm \nsufficient to satisfy ... Art.  standing requirements. A federal court is powerless to create its \nown jurisdiction by embellishing otherwise deficient allegations of standing.\"  Whitmore v. \nArkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155-56 (1990).  Moreover, because \"standing is not dispensed in gross,\" \nLewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 358 n.6 (1996), the Movants ''must demonstrate standing for each \nclaim [they] seek[] to press\" as well as \"'for each fonn of relief sought,\"' DaimlerChrysler, 54 7 \nU.S. at 352 (quoting Friends oft he Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. \n167, 185 (2000)).  Ultimately, \"(i]f a dispute is not a proper case or controversy, the courts have \nno business deciding it, or expounding the law in the course of doing so.\" DaimlerChrysler, 541 \nU.S. at 341.  Absent standing, the Court's exercise ofj udicial power\"would be gratuitous and \nthus inconsistent with the Art. ill limitation.\" Simon, 426 U.S. at 38. \nAnticipating that standing might be an issue, the Movants commenced their legal \narguments by first claiming that they established standing b.y  virtue of the fact that they were \ndenied access to judicial opinions.  Mot. for Release of Ct Records 10. The Movants assert that \n\"[d ]enial of access to court opinions alone constitutes an injury sufficient to satisfy Article III.,, \nId.  By footnote, the Movants also question in part the decision in In re Orders ofT his Court \nInterpreting Section 215 oft he PATRIOT Act, 2013 WL 5460064, to the extent that it held that a \nparty claiming the denial of public access to judicial opinions must further show either (I) that \nthe lack of public access impeded the party's own activities in a concrete and particular way or \n-8-\n\n(2) that access would afford concrete aµd particular assistance to the party in the conduct of its \nown activities, although the Movants alternatively argue that \"even if those showings are \nnecessary to establish standing, [they] satisfy the additional requirements.\" Id. at 11 n.27. \nIt appears that In re Orders ofT his Court Interpreting Section 215 oft he PATRIOT Act \nwas the flJ'St and only occasion on which a FISC Judge expressly addressed the question of a \nthird party's standing for the purpose of asserting a First Amendment right to access this Court's \njudicial opinions. s That was a case championed by these same Movants on the same ground that \nthe First Amendment guarantees a qualified right of public access to judicial opinions, although \nin that case the Movants sought access to opinions analyzing Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT \nAct (as codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1861). In re Orders o/This Court Interpreting Section 215 oft he \nPATRIOT Act, 2013 WL 5460064, at *1. There, the parties neglected to address standing so the \nCourt was obliged to consider it sua sponte based on the existing record, id., after impliedly \ntaking judicial notice of public matters, id. at *4 (stating that \"[t]he Court ordinarily would not \nlook beyond information presented by the parties to find that a claimant has Article Ill standing\" \nbut \"[i]n this case ... the ACLU's active participation in the legislative and public debates about \nthe proper scope of Section 21 S and the advisability of amending that provision is obvious from \nthe public record and not reasonably in dispute\").  The Court found that the ACLU and the \nACLU-NC had standing but MFIAC did not, id. at *4, albeit the Court later reinstated MFIAC as \na party upon granting MFIAC's motion seeking reconsideration of its standing on the strength of \ns \nIn re Motion for Release ofC  ourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484 (FISA Ct. 2007), also \ninvolved a motion filed by the ACLU seeking the release of court documents.  In that case, part \nof which is discussed at length infra Part IV, the ACLU's standing was not addressed and the \ncited basis for the exercise ofj urisdiction was the Court's inherent supervisory power over its \nown records and files.  Id. at 486-87 (citing Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 \n(1978)). \n-9-\n\nadditional infonnation regarding MFIAC's activities, Opinion & Order Granting Mot. for \nRecons., In re Orders o/This Court Interpreting Section 215 oft he PATRIOT Act, No. Misc. 13-\n02 (Aug. 7, 2014), available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Misc%2013-\n02%200rder-6_0.pdf.  The Court never reached the question of whether the First Amendment \napplied, however, and, instead, dismissed for comity the Movants' motion to the extent it sought \nopinions that were the subject of ongoing FOIA litigation in another federal jurisdiction. In re \nOrders o/This Court Interpreting Section 215 oft he PATRIOT Act, 2013 WL 5460064, at *6-7. \nThe Court then exercised its own discretion to initiate declassification review proceedings for a \nsingle opinion pursuant to Rule 62.  Id. at *8. \nRecognizing that the decision in In re Orders ofT his Court Interpreting Section 215 of \nthe PATRIOT Act involved the same Movants asserting, in essence, the same type of legal claim, \nthe question of standing nevertheless must be independently examined in this case because \n\"[t]his court, as a matter of constitutional duty, must assure itself of its jurisdiction to act in every \ncase.\" CTS Corp. v. EPA, 159 F.3d 52, 57 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  Significantly, the decision in In re \nOrders ofT his Court Interpreting Section 215 oft he PATRIOT Act is distinguishable because it \ndid not reach the question of whether the First Amendment applied and, if not, whether the \nMovants could establish standing in the absence of an interest protected by the First Amendment. \nThis case also is in a unique posture because the Movants seek access to judicial documents that \nalready have been made public and declassified by the Executive Branch, unlike the documents \nsought in /n re Orders ofT his Court Interpreting Section 215 oft he PATRIOT Act.  An \nindependent assessment of standing also is warranted in light of Article ill's  necessary function \nto circumscribe the Federal Judiciary's exercise ofpower, Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547, and given \n- 10-\n\nthe \"highly case-specific\" nature ofj urisdictional standing inquiries, Baur v. Veneman, 352 F .3d \n625, 637 (2d Cir. 2003). \nEmbarking on an analysis of standing in this matter, the Court is mindful that, because \n\"[s]tanding is an aspect of justiciability,\" \"the problem of standing is surrounded by the same \ncomplexities and vagaries that inhere injusticiability.,, Flast, 392 U.S. at 98.  Indeed, \n\"[s]tanding has been called one of 'the most amorphous (concepts) in the entire domain of public \nlaw.  Id. at 99 (quoting Hearings on S. 2097 Before the Subcomm. on Constitutional Rights of \nm \nthe S. Judiciary Comm., 89th Cong. 498 (2d Sess. 1966) (statement of Prof. Paul A. Freund)). \nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has referred to standing as a \n\"labyrinthine doctrine,\" Fin. lnsts. Ret. Fund v. Office o/Thrift Supervision, 964 F.2d 142, 146 \n(2d Cir. 1992), and even the Supreme Court bas admitted that \"'the concept of Art. Ill standing' \nhas not been defined with complete consistency in all of the various cases decided by this Court \nwhich have discussed it,\" Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 155 (quoting Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. \nAms. United/or Separation ofC  hurch & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 475 (1982)). \nDespite its nebulousness, there are several fundamental guideposts that offer direction \nand a general framework to evaluate standing in any given case. To begin with, while it bas long \nbeen the rule that standing \"in no way depends on the merits of the plaintitr s contention that \nparticular conduct is illegal,\" it nonetheless \"often turns on the nature and source of the claim \nasserted.\"  Warth, 422 U.S. at 500.  Supreme Court precedent \"makes clear that Art. m standing \nrequires an injury with a nexus to the substantive character of the statute or regulation at issue[.]\" \nDiamondv. Charles, 416 U.S. 54, 70 (1986) (citing Valley Forge Christian Coll., 454 U.S. at \n472).  Thus, \"standing is gauged by the specific common-law, statutory or constitutional claims \nthat a party presents.\" Int 'I Primate Prot. League v. Adm 'rs o/Tulane Educ. Fund, 500 U.S. 72, \n-11 -\n\n77 (1991 ).  \"In essence, the standing question is determined by 'whether the constitutional or \nstatutory provision on which the claim rests properly can be understood as granting persons in \nthe plaintiffs position a right to judicial relief.'\" E.M. v. New York City Dep 't ofE duc., 158 \nF.3d 442, 450 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Warth, 422 U.S. at 500). \"(A]lthough standing is an \nanterior question ofj urisdiction, the grist and elements of [the Court's] jurisdictional analysis \nrequire a peek at the substance of [the Movants'] arguments.\"  Transp. Workers Union ofA m., \nAFL-CIO v. Transp. Sec. Admin., 492 F.3d 471, 474-75 (D.C. Cir. 2007). \nIt also is well established that the doctrine of standing consists of three elements, the first \nof which requires the Movants to show that they suffered an \"injury in fact.\"  Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n560. The second element requires that the injury in fact be ''fairly traceable'' to the defending \nparty's challenged conduct and the third element requires that there be a likelihood (versus mere \nspeculation) that the injury will be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.  Id. \nII. \nRecently, the Supreme Court emphasized that \"injury in fact\" is the \"'(f]irst and \nforemost' of standing's three elements.\" Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547 (quoting Steel Co. v. \nCitizens for Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 103 (1998)). Importantly for the purpose of resolving the \npending' motion, the Supreme Court has \"stressed that the alleged injury must be legally and \njudicially cognizable.\" Raines v. Byrd, 521U.S.811, 819 (1997).  ''This requires, among other \nthings, that the plaintiff have suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest which is ... \nconcrete and particularized, and that the dispute is traditionally thought to be capable of \nresolution through the judicial process[.]\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted, \nemphasis added).  \"[A]n injwy refers to the invasion of some 'legally protected interest' arising \n- 12-\n\nfrom constitutional, statutory, or common law.,, Pender v. Bank ofA m. Corp., 788 F.3d 354, 366 \n(4th Cir. 2015) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 578). \nThe meaning of the phrase \"legally protected interest'' has been a source of perplexity in \nthe case law as a result, at least in part, of the Supreme Court's pronouncement that a party can \nhave standing even if he loses on the merits.  See Warth, 422 U.S. at 500 (stating that \"standing \nin no way depends on the merits of the plaintiff's contention that particular conduct is illegal\"); \nJn re Special Grand Jury 89-2, 450F.3d1159, 1172 (10th Cir. 2006) (''The term legally \nprotected interest has generated some confusion because the Court has made clear that a plaintiff \ncan have standing despite losing on the merits ...., , (emphasis in original)); Judicial Watch, Inc. \nv.

Bonneville Power Admin., 733 F.3d 939, 951 n.23 \n(9th Cir. 2013) (\"The exact requirements for a 'legally protected interest' are far from clear.\"). \nThe confusion is compounded by the fact that the Supreme Court has occasionally resorted to \nusing the phrase '~udicially cognizable interest'' rather than, or interchangeably with, the phrase \n\"legally protected interest.\" Judicial Watch, 432 F.3d at 364 (Williams, J., concurring) (\"[T]he \n[Supreme] Court appears to use the 'legally protected' and 'judicially cognizable' language \n- 13 -\n\ninterchangeably.\"); ABF Freight Sys., Inc. v.

Adding to the uncertainty, in some cases the Supreme Court makes no \nmention whatsoever of the requirement that an injury entail the invasion of either a \"legally \nprotected\" or '~udicially cognizable\" interest.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int 'l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, \n1147 (2013) (\"To establish Article m standing, an injury must be 'concrete, particularized, and \nactual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable \nruling.\"' (quoting Monsanto Co. v.

EPA, 549 U.S. 497, S 11 (2007) (\"To ensure the proper adversarial presentation, \nLujan holds that a litigant must demonstrate that it has suffered a concrete and particularized \ninjury that is either actual or imminent, that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant, and \nthat it is likely that a favorable decision will redress that injury. j. \nDeciphering the meaning of the phrase \"legally protected interest'' also is muddled by the \nvarying approaches courts use to identify the relevant \"interest\" at stake. In at least one case the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit suggested that the interest at issue could be \n-14-\n\nconsidered subjectively from the perspective of the party asserting standing.  Doe v. Pub. Citizen, \n749 F.3d 246, 262 {4th Cir. 2014) {intimating that litigants need only assert an interest that \"in \ntheir view,, was protected by the common law or the Constitution).  Other courts focus \nobjectively on whether the Constitution, a statute or the common law actually recognizes the \nasserted interest.  See, e.g., Sargeant v. Dixon, 130 F.3d 1067, 1069 (D.C. Cir. 1997) {stating that \n\"[a] legally cognizable interest means an interest recognized at common law or specifically \nrecognized as such by the Congress\"). \nStill other courts have examined whether the type or fonn of the injury is traditionally \ndeemed to be a legal hann, such as an economic injury or an invasion of property rights, \nalthough such an inquiry can blend into the question of whether the injury is concrete and \nparticularized.  See, e.g., Danvers Motor Co., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 432 F.3d 286, 293 (3d Cir. \n2005) (stating that \"[m]onetary hann is a classic form of injury-in-fact\" that \"is often assumed \nwithout discussion\" and an invasion of property rights, ''whether it sounds in tort ... or contract \n... undoubtedly 'affect[s] the plaintiff in a personal and individual way'\" (quoting Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 560 n. l )). At least one court bas found standing by analogizing to interests that were \nnever advanced by the party asserting standing.6 See In re Special Grand Jury 89-2, 450 F.3d at \n6  It is unclear how this approach can be reconciled with the Supreme Court's admonitions \nthat standing \"is gauged by the specific common-law, statutory or constitutional claims that a \nparty presents,,, Int 'I Primate Prot. League, 500 U.S. at 77 (emphasis added), and a \"federal \ncourt is powerless to create its own jurisdiction by embellishing otherwise deficient allegations \nof standing,\" Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 155-56. The Tenth Circuit opined that the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Bennett, 520 U.S. at 167, presented a \"new locution\" according to which the \nsubstitution of the phrase \"judicially cognizable interest\" for \"legally protected interest'' signaled \nthat the Supreme Court had abandoned Lujan 's requirement of a \"legally protected interest'' in \nfavor of a formulation that provides that \"an interest can support standing even if it is not \nprotected by law (at least, not protected in the particular case at issue) so long as it is the sort of \ninterest that courts think to be of sufficient moment to justify judicial intervention.\" Jn re \nSpecial Grand Jury 89-2, 450 F.3d at 1172.  The question of whether the Supreme Court \nintended to abandon the requirement for a \"legally protected interest\" seems to have been \n- 15 -\n\n1172-1173 (characterizing former grand jurors' requests to lift the secrecy obligation imposed by \nRule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as an interest in \"stating what they lmow\" \nthat mirrors the First Amendment claims of litigants challenging speech resb'ictions and \ncommenting that \"there is no requirement that the legal basis for the interest of a plaintiff that is \n'injured in fact' be the same as, or even related to, the legal basi~ for the plaintiff's claim, at least \noutside the taxpayer-standing context\"). \nAlthough no universal definition of the phrase \"legally protected interest\" has been \ndeveloped by the case law, 7 the Supreme Court and a majority of federal jurisdictions have \nconcluded that an interest is not \"legally protected\" or cognizable for the pwpose of establishing \nstanding when its asserted legal source-whether constitutional, statutory, common law or \nresolved in the negative by the Supreme Court's decision in Raines, which was decided shortly \nafter Bennett and was joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, the author of the Court's unanimous \ndecision in Bennett.  In Raines, as stated supra, the Supreme Court \"stressed that the alleged \ninjury must be legally and judicially cognizable\" and went on to state that \"[t]his requires, among \nother things, that the plaintiff have suffered 'an invasion of a legally protected interest which is \n... concrete and particularized.\"' 521 U.S. at 819 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  The \nSupreme Court's recent decision in Spokeo also employs the locution requiring that, \"[t]o \nestablish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered 'an invasion ofa  legally \nprotected interest' that is 'concrete and particularized' and 'actual or imminent, not conjectural \nor hypothetical.\"'  136 S. Ct. at 1548 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560) (emphasis added). \n7  The bewildering state of the law might explain in part why one commentator has referred \nto the \"injury in fact\" requirement as \"a singularly unhelpful, even incoherent, addition to the \nlaw of standing,\" William A. Fletcher, The Structure a/Standing, 98 Yale L.J. 221, 231 (1988), \nand another has taken what the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit described as \nthe \"somewhat cynical view\" that \"'[t]he only conclusion [regarding what injuries are sufficient \nfor standing] is that in addition to injuries to common law, constitutiona~ and statutory rights, a \nplaintiff has standing if he or she asserts an injury that the Court deems sufficient for standing \npurposes.\"' In re Special Grand Jury 89-2, 450 F .3d at 1172 (second alteration in original) \n(quoting Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction§ 2.3.2 at 74 (4th ed.2003)). \n- 16-\n\notherwise-does not apply or does not exist. The United States Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia Circuit (the \"D.C. Circuit'')8 has offered the following explanation: \nWhether a plaintiff has a legally protected interest (and thus standing) does not \ndepend  on whether he  can  demonstrate that he will succeed on the merits. \nOtherwise,  every unsuccessful plaintiff will have lacked standing in the first \nplace. Thus, for example, one can have a legal interest in receiving government \nbenefits and consequently standing to sue because of a refusal to grant them even \nthough the court eventually rejects the claim. See generally Public Citizen v. \nUnited States Dep 't ofJ ustice, 491 U.S. 440, 109 S. Ct. 2558, 105 L.Ed.2d 377 \n(1989) (plaintiffs had standing to bring suit under [Federal Advisory Committee \nAct (\"FACA\"), 5 U.S.C. App. §§ 1-15] although claim failed). Indeed, in Lujan \nthe Court characterized the \"legally protected interest\" element of an injury in fact \nsimply as a \"cognizable interest'' and, without addressing whether the claimants \nhad a statutory right to use or observe an animal species, concluded that the desire \nto do so ''undeniably\" was a cognizable interest. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562-63, 112 \nS. Ct. at 2137-38. \nOn the other hand, if the plaintifrs claim has no foundation in law, he has no \nlegally protected interest and thus no standing to sue. See, e.g., Arjay Assocs. v. \nBush, 891 F.2d 894, 898 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (\"We hold that appellants lack standing \nbecause the injury they assert is to a nonexistent right ... .\" );ACLU v. FCC, 523 \nF.2d  1344,  1348 (9th Cir.  1975) (''If ACLU's claim is meritorious, standing \nexists; if not, standing not only fails but also ceases to be relevant.\"); United \nJewish  Org.  of Williamsburgh  v.  Wilson,  510  F.2d 512,  521  (2d Cir.  1975) \n(''Whether our decision on this point is cast on the merits or as  a matter of \nstanding is probably immaterial.\"), ajf'd, 430 U.S. 144, 97 S. Ct. 996, 51 L.Ed.2d \n229 (1977). \nClaybrook v. Slater, 111F.3d904, 907 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Furthermore, although the question of \nwhether a litigant's interest is \"legally protected\" does not depend on the merits of the claim, it \nnevertheless is the case that \"there are instances in which courts have examined the merits of the \nunderlying claim and concluded that the plaintiffs lacked a legally protected interest and \ntherefore lacked standing.\" Skull Valley Band ofG  oshute Indians v. Nielson, 316 F.3d 1223, \n1236 (10th Cir. 2004) (citing Skull Valley Band o/Goshute Indians v. Leavitt, 215 F. Supp. 2d \n1232, 1240-41 (D. Utah 2002)(discussing cases), Claybrook, 111 F.3d at 907, andAljayAssocs. \n8  For brevity and convenience, this opinion hereinafter will omit the phrase ''United States \nCourt of Appeals for the\" from the identification of federal circuit courts of appeal. \n- 17-\n\nInc. v. Bush, 891 F. 2d 894, 898 (Fed. Cir. 1989)). Accord Martin v. S.E. C., 734 F. 3d 169, 173 \n(2d Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (declining to reach the merits of a litigant's claims when standing \nwas lacking \"except to the extent that the merits overlap with the jurisdictional question''). \nIn McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93 (2003), overruled in part on other grounds, Citizens \nUnitedv. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), the Supreme Court concluded that a group of litigants \nlacked Article Ill standing because their claims could not be deemed \"legally cognizable\" when \nthe Court had never previously recognized the broadly-asserted: interest and that interest was \npremised on a mistaken interpretation of inapplicable legal precedent.  The litigants in \nMcConnell consisted in part of a group of voters, organizations representing voters, and \ncandidates who collectively challenged, among other things, the constitutionality of a particular \nsection of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (''BCRA\") that amended the Federal \nElection Campaign Act of 1971 (\"FECA\") by \"increas[ing] and index[ing] for inflation certain \nFECA contribution limits.\" 540 U.S. at 226.  As relevant here, the litigant group argued that, as \na result of the amendments, they suffered an injury they identified as the deprivation of an \"equal \nability to participate in the election ·process based on their economic status.\" Id. at 227.  The \ngroup asserted that this injury was legally cognizable according to voting-rights case law that \nthey viewed as prohibiting \"electoral discrimination based on economic status ... and upholding \nthe right to an equally meaningful vote.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme \nCourt, however, disclaimed the notion that it had ever \"recognized a legal right comparable to \nthe broad and diffuse injury asserted by the ... plaintiffs.\" Id.  In addition, the group's \"reliance \non this Court's voting rights cases [was] misplaced\" because those cases required only \n\"nondiscriminatory access to the ballot and a single, equal vote for each voter\" whereas the \ngroup had not claimed that they were denied such equal access or the right to vote.  Id.  The \n- 18-\n\nCourt further stated that it had previously \"noted that '[p]olitical 'free trade' does not necessarily \nrequire that all who participate in the political marketplace do so with exactly equal resources,'\" \nso the group's \"claim of injury ... is, therefore, not to a legally cognizable right.\" Id. (quoting \nFECv. Massachusetts Citizens/or Life, Inc., 419 U.S. 238, 257 (1986)). \nIn Bond v. Utreras, 585 F.3d 1061, 1065-66 (7th Cir. 2009), the Seventh Circuit reviewed \na district court order lifting a protective order and permitting a journalist to intervene in a civil \nrights case involving allegations that Chicago police officers mentally and physically abused a \nplaintiff while performing their official duties. The journalist sought to \"unseal\" police \ndepartment records relating to citizen complaints against Chicago police officers that the city had \nproduced during pretrial discovery but never filed with the court.  Id. at 1066.  The journalist \nclaimed that no good cause existed to continue the protective order under Rule 26(c ) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Id. at 1065.  Several months after dismissing the underlyin~ \nlawsuit, which had settled, id., the district court \"reevaluated whether 'good cause' existed to \nkeep the documents confidential, and in so doing applied a 'presumption' of public access to \ndiscovery materials,\" id. at 1067.  On balance, the district court concluded that the city's interest \nin keeping the records confidential was outweighed by the public's interest in information about \npolice misconduct; as a result, the court granted the journalist's request to intervene and lifted the \nprotective order.  Id.  On appeal by the city, the Seventh Circuit characterized as a \"mistake\" the \ndistrict court's failure to consider whether the journalist had standing in view of the fact that the \nunderlying lawsuit had been dismissed.  Id. at 1068. The Seventh Circuit held that a third party \nseeking permissive intervention to challenge a protective order after a case has been dismissed \n\"must meet the standing requirements ofA  rticle min addition to Rule 24(b)'s requirements for \npermissive intervention.\" Id. at 1072.  Discussing Article Ill's standing requirements, id. at \n-19-\n\n1072-73, the Seventh Circuit noted that, \"while a litigant need not definitely 'establish that a \nright of his has been infringed,' he 'must have a colorable claim to such a right' to satisfy Article \nm,\" id. at I 073 (emphasis in original) (quoting Aurora Loan Servs., Inc. v. Craddieth, 442 F .3d \n1O18, 1024 (7th Cir. 2006)).  Because the district court's decision to lift the protective order was \npremised on a presumptive right of access to discovery materials, id. at 1067, the Seyenth Circuit \nanalyzed the legal basis of such a presumptive right and concluded that, while \"most documents \nfiled in court are presumptively open to the public,\" id. at I 073, it nevertheless is the case that \n\"[g]enerally speaking, the public bas no constitutional, statutory (rule-based), or common-law \nright of access to unfiled discovery,\" id at 1073 (emphasis in original). The Seventh Circuit also \nfound no support for the notion that Rule 26(c ) \"creates a freestanding public right of access to \nunfiled discovery.'' Id. at 1076. It then proceeded to consider and reject whether, alternatively, \nthe First Amendment supplied such a right Id. at 1077-78.  Lacking any legal basis to assert a \nright to untiled discovery, the Seventh Circuit held that the journalist \"has no injury to a legally \nprotected interest and therefore no standing to support intervention.\" Id. at 1078. \nGriswold v. Driscoll, 616 F.3d 53 (1st Cir. 2010), is another instructive case.  The First \nCircuit held that litigants lacked a legally protected interest because the source of the interest, the \nFirst Amendment, did not apply.  In Griswold, students, parents, teachers, and the Assembly of \nTurkish American Associations (\"ATA  A\") collectively challenged a decision by the \nCommissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education of Massachusetts to revise a statutorily \nmandated advisory curriculum guide.  616 F.3d at 54-56. The Commissioner's initial revisions \nwere motivated by political pressure to assuage a Turkish cultural organization that objected to \nthe curriculum guide's references to the Annenian genocide as biased for failing to acknowledge \nan opposing contra-genocide perspective. Id. at 54-SS.  After the revised curriculum guide was \n-20-\n\nsubmitted to legislative officials, the Commissioner again modifi~d it - at the request of \nArmenian descendants - by removing references to all pro-Turkish websites (including websites \nthat presented the contra-genocide perspective) except the Turkish Embassy's website.  Id. at SS. \nThe plaintiffs sued claiming that the revisions to the curriculum guide were made in violation of \ntheir rights ·under the First Amendment to \"inquire, teach and learn free from viewpoint \ndiscrimination ... and to speak.\" Id. at 56.  In an opinion notable for its authorship by U.S. \nSupreme Court Associate Justice David Souter (Ret) , sitting by designation, the First Circuit \naffirmed the dismissal of the AT AA 's First Amendment claim as time barred and then \nconsidered whether the remaining plaintiffs had standing to assert a First Amendment right. Id. \nRemarking that \"we see this as a case in which the dispositiv~ questions of standing and \nstatement of cognizable claim are difficult to disentangle,\" the First Circuit found it \"prudent to \ndispose of both standing and merits issues together.\" Id.  The First Circuit then evaluated \nwhether the challenged advisory curriculum guide was analogous to a virtual school library-in \nwhich case the revisions to the guide would be subject to First Amendment review pursuant to \nthe plurality decision in Board ofE ducation, Island Trees Union Free School District No. 26 v. \nPico, 451 U.S. 853 (1982)-or whether the guide was more properly characterized as an element \nof curriculum over which the State Board of Education may exercise discretion.  Id. at 56-60. \nThe First Circuit ultimately regarded the complaint as pleading \"a curriculum guide claim that \nshould be treated like one about a library, in which case pleading cognizable injury and stating a \ncognizable claim resist distinction.\" Id. at 56.  Declining to extend ''the Pico plurality's notion \nof non-interference with school libraries as a constitutional basis for limiting the discretion of \nstate authorities to set curriculum,\" the First Circuit found that the guide was an element of \ncurriculum, id. at 59, so that ''revisions to the Guide after its submission to legislative officials, \n- 21 -\n\neven ifm  ade in response to political pressure, did not implicate the First Amendment,\" id. at 60. \nThe First Circuit therefore affirmed the lower court's judgment that the First Amendment did not \napply to the challenged curriculum guide and, as a result, the plaintiffs had failed to establish \neither a cognizable injwy or a cognizable claim. Id. at 56, 60. \nThe D.C. Circuit's decision in Claybrook, cited supra, also lends authority to the \nproposition that a party lacks standing when the statutory, constitutional, common law or other \nsource of the asserted legal interest does not apply or does not exist.  Claybrook involved a \nlawsuit filed by Joan Claybrook, a coooehair of Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways \n(\"CRASH\"), who sued the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration (\"FHWA  \") for \nfailing to prevent an agency advisory committee from passing a resolution that criticized \nCRASH's fund-raising literature.  111 F.3d at 905, 906.  Claybrook claimed that the \nAdministrator violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (\"FACA\"), 5 U.S.C. App.§§ 1-15, \nby permitting the advisory committee to vote on and pass the challenged resolution, which \nClaybrook claimed was not on the committee's agenda and not within the committee's authority. \nId. at 906.  The Administrator countered by arguing that Claybrook lacked standing \"because the \nlegal duty she claims he violated does not exist.\" Id at 907.  Upon analysis of the relevant \nprovisions ofFACA, S U.S.C. App.§§ 9(c)(B), lO(a)(l), 10(a)(2), lO(e), lO(f), the D.C. Circuit \nagreed that the Act did not impose the asserted legal duty that served as a basis for Claybrook's \nclaimed injury, the agency otherwise complied with the Act, and the decision to adjourn the \nadvisory committee meeting was committed to the agency's discretion pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 70l(a)(2). Id. at907-909. Because FACA offered no recourse to Claybrook, the D.C. Circuit \nheld that \"[i]n sum, we are left with no law to apply to Claybrook's claim and consequently \nClaybrook lacks standing.\" Id. at 909. \n-22-\n\nThe Ninth Circuit reached a similar result in Fleck & Assocs., Inc. v. Phoenix, an Arizona \nMun. Corp., 471 F.3d 1100 (9th Cir. 2006).  The appellant in Fleck & Assocs. was a \"for-profit \ncorporation that operate[d] ... a gay men's social club in Phoenix, Arizona,, where \"[s]exual \nactivities [took] place in the dressing rooms and in other areas of the club.\" 471 F.3d at 1102. \nPursuant to a Phoenix ordinance banning the operation of live sex act businesses, a social club \noperated by the appellant was subjected to a police search during which two employees were \nquestioned and detained.  Id. at 1102-1103.  The appellant was also \"threatened with similar \nactions.\" Id. at 1103.  The appellant sued the city seeking both injunctive and declaratory relief \non the ground that the ordinance violated its constitutional privacy rights.  Id. at 1102. The \ndistrict court interpreted the appellant's complaint to raise one claim based on the invasion of its \ncustomers' privacy rights and a second claim based on the invasion of the appellant's rights as a \ncorporation.  Id. at 1103.  With respect to the claim based on the customers' privacy rights, the \ndistrict court found that the appellant lacked standing to pursue that claim and, alternatively, the \nappellants' customers had no privacy rights in the social club so dismissal was further warranted \nfor failure to state a claim for relief.  Id.  The district court held, however, that the appellant had \nstanding to assert its own privacy rights as a corporation, albeit \"[t]he court did not ... identify \nwhat those corporate rights might have been\" and \"immediately proceeded to hold that [the \nappellant] lacked any cognizable privacy rights and dismissed for failure to state a claim.\" Id. \nOn appeal, the Ninth Circuit agreed with the district court that the appellant lacked associational \nstanding9 to assert its customers' rights but held that the district court erred by addressing the \nmerits of the customers' privacy rights in the social club when the court lacked subject matter \n9  \"Under the doctrine of 'associational' or 'representational' standing an organization may \nbring suit on behalf of its members whether or not the organization itself has suffered an injury \nfrom the challenged action.\" Id. at 1105. \n-23-\n\njurisdiction. Id. at 1103, 1105, 1106.  Discussing the appellant's claim of\"traditionar• Article Ill \nstanding based on its asserted privacy rights as a corporation, the Ninth Circuit noted that the \nappellant \"squarely identifie[ d] the source of its supposed right as the liberty guarantee described \nin.Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2003).\" Id. at 1104. \nThe Ninth Circuit detennined, however, that no corporate right to privacy emanated from that \ncase, id. at 1105, 1106, and, as a result, \"[b] ecause the right to privacy described in Lawrence is \npurely personal and unavailable to a corporation, [the appellant corporation] failed to allege an \ninjwy in fact sufficient to make out a case or controversy under Article ill,\" id. at 1105. \nIn Muntaqim v. Coombe, 449 F.3d 371 (2d Cir. 2006) (en bane) (per curiam), the Second \nCircuit considered a prisoner's complaint challenging New York Election Law section 5-106 on \nthe ground that it denied felons the right to vote in violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \n\"because it 'result[e d] in a denial or abridgement of the right ... to vote on account of race.,,, \n449 F.3d at 374 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a), transferred to 52 U.S.C. § 10301).  Because the \nprisoner was a resident of California before he was incarcerated, id. at 374, and the Second \nCircuit concluded that \"under New York law, [his] involuntary presence in a New York prison \n[did] not confer residency for purposes of registration and voting,\" id. at 376, the court found \nthat \"his inability to vote in New York arises from the fact that he was a resident of California, \nnot because he was a convicted felon subject to the application of New York Election Law \nsection 5-106,\" id.  As a result, the Second Circuit held that that the prisoner \"suffered no \n&invasion of a legally protected interest.,,. Id. {quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560). \nOther federal circuits similarly have concluded that, when the source of the legal interest \nasserted by a litigant does not apply or does not exist, the litigant has not established a colorable \nclaim to a right that is \"legally protected\" or \"cognizable\" for the purpose of establishing an \n-24-\n\ninjury in fact that satisfies Article Ill's standing requirement.  See, e.g., 24th Senatorial Dist. \nRepublican Comm. v. Alcorn, 820 F.3d 624, 633 (4th Cir. 2016) (finding that \"[b]ecause neither \nVirginia law nor the Plan [of Organization that governs the Republican Party of Virginia] gives \n[the litigant] 'a legally protected interest' in determining the nomination method in the first \nplace, he fails to make out 'an invasion of a legally protected interest,' i.e. actual injury, in this \ncase\" (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560) (emphasis in original)); Spirit Lake Tribe ofI ndians ex \nrel. Comm. ofU  nderstanding and Respect v. Nat 'I Collegiate Athletic Ass 'n, 715 F.3d 1089, \n1092 (8th Cir. 2013) (noting that injury resulting from a college ceasing to use a Native \nAmerican name, \"even if ... sufficiently concrete and particularized ... does not result from the \ninvasion ofa legally protected interest\"); White v. United States, 601 F.3d S4S, SSS (6th Cir. \n2010) (stating that the plaintiffs \"must demonstrate an injury-in-fact to a legally protected \ninterest\" but failed to do so because \"none of the purported 'c<?nstitutional' injuries actually \nimplicates the Constitution''); Pichler v. UNITE, 542 F.3d 380, 390-92 (3d Cir. 2008) (affirming \ndismissal on the ground that litigants failed to establish an injury to a \"legally protected interest\" \nbecause the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2721-2725, was interpreted \nto apply only to an individual whose personal information was contained in a motor vehicle \nrecord and not to spouses who might share that same personal information but were not the \nsubject of the motor vehicle record); Bochese, 405 F.3d at 984 {litigant was not an intended \nbeneficiary of a contract amendment so he \"had no 'legally cognizable interest' in that agreement \nand therefore lack[ed] standing to challenge its rescission\"); Alken v. Hackett, 281 F.3d 516, 519-\n20 (6th Cir. 2002) (appellants who claimed they were denied a benefit in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause but did not allege that they would have received the benefit under a race \nneutral policy lacked standing because they \"failed to allege the invasion of a right that the law \n-25-\n\nprotects\"); Arjay Assocs., 891 F.2d at 898 (stating that \"[b]ecause appellants have no right to \nconduct foreign commerce in products excluded by Congress, they have in this case no right \ncapable ofj udicial enforcement and have thus suffered no injury capable ofj udicial redress\"). \nm. \nSeveral considerations favor the above-descnoed understanding of the injury in fact \nrequirement, the first of whi.ch  is its inherent logic.  For an interest to be deemed \"legally\" \nprotected or cognizable it must have some foundation in the law.  Claybrook, 111 F.3d at 907 \n(stating, as quoted above, that \"if the plaintiff's claim has no foundation in the law, he has no \nlegally protected interest\").  Thus, if the interest underlying a litigant's claimed injury is \npremised on a law that does not apply or does not exist, it directly follows that the litigant does \nnot possess an interest that is \"legally protected.\" Cf. Pender, 188 F.3d at 366 (indicating that a \nlegally protected interest \"aris[es] from constitutional, statutory, or common law\" (citing Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 578)). \nAnother consideration is the degree to which the approach taken by the majority of \njurisdictions remains faithful to the proper role of standing as an element of Article lli's \nconstitutional limit on the exercise ofj udicial power.  As the Supreme Court bas said, \"the \nConstitution extends the 'judicial Power' of the United States only to 'Cases' and \n'Controversies\"' and the Court \"ha[s] always taken this to mean cases and controversies of the \nsort traditionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.,, Steel Co., S23 U.S. at 102. \n\"Such a meaning is fairly implied by the text, since otherwise the purported restriction upon the \njudicial power would scarcely be a restriction at all.\" Id.  Declining to exercise jurisdiction to \nentertain a litigant's claim for which no law can be properly invoked and, as a result, no legally \nprotected interest can be said to have been wrongfully invaded, comports with standing's role as \na limitation on judicial power.  A contrary approach to standing would effect an expansion of \n-26-\n\njudicial power without due regard for the autonomy of co-equal branches of government or the \nway in which the exercise ofj udicial power \"can so profoundly affect the lives, liberty, and \nproperty of those to whom it extends,\" Valley Forge Christian Coll., 454 U.S at 473. 10 \nMost importantly, this matter poses separation-of-powers concerns. The Supreme Court \nhas observed that the \"standing inquiry bas been especially rigorous when reaching the merits of \nthe dispute would force us to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of \nthe Federal Government was unconstitutional.\" Raines, 521 U.S. at 819-20.  The Movants bring \na constitutional claim that implicates the authorities of co-equal branches of the government. \nFirst, the decisions the Movants seek have been classified by the Executive Branch in accordance \nwith its constitutional authorities and the portions of the opinions that the Executive Branch has \ndeclassified have already been released.  The Supreme Court has stressed that \"[t]he President, \nafter all, is the 'Commander in ~ief of the Army and Navy of the United States\"' and \"[b]is \nauthority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security ... flows \nprimarily from this constitutional investment of power in the President and exists quite apart \nfrom any explicit congressional grant.\" Dep 't oft he Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. S 18, 527 (1988). \nAccordingly, \"[f]or 'reasons ... too obvious to call for enlarged discussion,' CIA v. Sims, 471 \nU.S.159, 170, 105 S.Ct. 1881, 1888, 85L.Ed.2d173 (1985), the protection of classified \ninfonnation must be committed to the broad discretion of the agency responsible, and this must \ninclude broad discretion to determine who may have access to it.\" Egan, 484 U.S. at 529. \n10  Some might object that litigants should have an opportunity to develop the facts before a \ncourt assesses the scope or applicability of an asserted right E.g., Judicial Watch, 432 F.Jd at \n363 (Williams, J., concurring) (stating that ''the use of the phrase 'legally protected' to require \nshowing of a substantive right would thwart a major function of standing doctrine-to avoid \npremature judicial involvement in resolution of issues on the merits\").  This case does not \nimplicate those concerns. No amount of factual development would alter the outcome of the \nquestion of whether the First Amendment applies and affords a qualified right of access to \nclassified, ex parte FISA proceedings. \n-27-\n\n\"[U]nless Congress specifically has provided otherwise, courts traditionally have been reluctant \nto intrude upon the authority of the Executive in military and national security affairs.\" Id.  In \nthis case, the Movants seek access to information contained in this Court's opinions that the \nExecutive Branch has detennined is classified national security information. \nSecond, in the exercise of its constitutional authorities to make laws, see United States v. \nKebodeaux, 133 S. Ct. 2496, 2502 (2013) (discussing Congress's broad authority to make laws \npursuant to the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause), Congress bas directed by statute \nthat \"[t]he record of proceedings under [FISA], including applications made and orders granted, \nshall be maintained under security measures established by the Chief Justice in consultation with \nthe Attorney General and the Director ofNational Intelligence,\" SO U.S.C. \n§ 1803(c ) .  While Congress has also established means by which certain opinions of this Court \nare to be subject to a declassification review and made public, it has made Executive Branch \nofficials acting independently of the Court responsible for these actions. See infra Part V. \nTo be clear, the classified material the Movants' seek is not subject to sealing orders \nentered by this Court.  See M;ovants' Reply In Supp. of Their Mot. for Release of Ct. Records 16 \n(requesting that the Court ''unseal\" the judicial opinions and release them \"with only those \nredactions essential to protect information that the Court detennines, after independent review, to \nwarrant continued sealing''). No such orders were imposed in the cases in which the sought-after \njudicial opinions were issued; consequently, no question about the propriety of a sealing order is \nat play in this matter.  The entirety of the information sought by the Movants is classified \ninformation redacted from public FISC opinions that is being withheld by the Executive Branch \npursuant to its independent classification authorities and remains subject to the statutory mandate \nthat the FISC maintain its records under the aforementioned security procedures.  Adjudication \n-28-\n\nof the Movants' motion could therefore require the Court to delve into questions about the \nconstitutionality, pursuant to the First Amendment, of the Executive Branch's national security \nclassification decisions or the scope and constitutional validity of the statute's mandate that this \nCourt maintain material under the required security procedures. \nTogether, these considerations commend the path paved by the majority of jurisdictions, \nwhich have held that an interest is not \"legally protected\" for the purpose of establishing \nstanding when the constitutional, statutory or common-law source of the interest does not apply \nor does not exist It bears emphasizing that the only interest the Movants identify to establish \nstanding in this case is a qualified right to access judicial opinions.  Mot for Release of Ct. \nRecords 1, 2, 10.  The Movants claim that this interest is legally protected ~y the First \nAmendment. Id. at 10.  The Movants further assert that this legally protected interest-that is, \nthe qualified right to access judicial documents as protected by the First Amendment-was \ninvaded when they were denied access to this Court's judicial opinions addressing the legality of \nbulk data collection, thereby causing injury.  Id.  Accordingly, the question for the Court is \nwhether the First Amendment applies. \n-29-\n\nIV. \nAccess to judicial records is not expressly contemplated by the First Amendment, which \nstates that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting \nthe free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the \npeople peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\" U.S. \nCONST. amend. I.  The Supreme Court, however, has inferred that, in conjunction with the \nFourteenth Amendment, \"[t]hese expressly guaranteed freedoms share a common core purpose \nof assuring freedom of communication on matters relating to the functioning of government'' \nRichmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. SSS, 575 (1980) (plurality opinion). The \nSupreme Court has further explained that \"[i]n guaranteeing freedoms such as those of speech \nand press, the First Amendment can be read as protecting the right of everyone to attend trials so \nas to give meaning to these explicit guarantees\" and \"[w   ]hat this means in the context of trials is \nthat the First Amendment guarantees of speech and press, standing alone, prohibit government \nfrom summarily closing courtroom doors which had long been open to the public at the time that \nAmendment was adopted.\" Id. \nIn Richmond Newspapers, the Supreme Court \"firmly established for the first time that \nthe press and general public have a constitutional right of access to criminal trials.\"  Globe \nNewspaper Co v. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596, 603 (1982).  The Supreme Court bas advised, \nhowever, that, \"[a]lthough the right of access to criminal trials is of constitutional stature, it is \nnot absolute,\" id. at 607, but \"may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings \nthat closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest,\" \nPress-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court, 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984) (\"Press-Enterprise F'). The \nSupreme Court bas extended this qualified First Amendment right of public access only to \n-30-\n\ncriminal trials, Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. at 580, the voir dire examination ofj urors in a \ncriminal trial, Press-Enterprise/, 464 U.S. at 508-13, and criminal preliminary hearings \"as they \nare conducted in California,\" Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1, 13 (1986) (\"Press-\nEnterprise If'). Most circuit courts, though, \"have recognized that the First Amendment right of \naccess extends to civil trials and some civil filings.\" ACLUv. Holder, 673 F.3d 245, 252 (4th \nCir. 2011 ).  To date, however, the Supreme Court has never \"applied the Richmond Newspapers \ntest outside the context of criminal judicial proceedings or the transcripts of such proceedings.\" \nCtr.for Nat'/ Sec. Studies v. U.S. Dep't ofJ ustice, 331F.3d918, 935 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Nor has \n''the Supreme Court ... ever indicated that it would apply the Richmond Newspapers test to \nanything other than criminal judicial proceedings.\" Id. (emphasis in original). \n\"In Press-Enterprise JI, the Supreme Court first articulated what has come to be known \nas the Richmond Newspapers 'experience and logic' test, by which the Court determines whether \nthe public has a right of access to 'criminal proceedings. \"'11  Id. at 934. The \"experience\". test \nquestions \"whether the place and process have histori~lly been open to the press and general \npublic.\" Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 8.  The \"logic\" test asks \"whether public access plays a \nsignificant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.\" Id. \nThis is not the first occasion on which the Court has confronted the question of whether a \nqualified First Amendment right of access applies to this Court's judicial records.  Nearly a \ndecade ago, the ACLU sought by motion the release of this Court's \"orders and government \n11  In addition to the Richmond Newspapers \"experience and logic\" tests, the Second Circuit \nhas also \"endorsed\" a \"second approach\" that holds that \"the First Amendment protects access to \njudicial records that are 'derived from or a necessary corollary of the capacity to attend the \nrelevant proceedings.\"' In re N. Y. Times Co. to Unseal Wiretap & Search Warrant Materials, \n577 F.3d 401, 409 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino, 380 F.3d 83, 93 \n(2d Cir. 2004)). \n- 31 -\n\npleadings regarding a program of surveillance of suspected international terrorists by the \nNational Security Agency (NSA) that had previously been conducted without court \nauthorization.\" In re Motion for Release ofC  ourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 485.  Assuming, \nfor the sake of argument, that a quaHfied First Amendment right of access might extend to \njudicial proceedings other than criminal proceedings, the Court applied the requisite \n\"experience\" and \"logic\" tests acknowledged by the Supreme Court in Press-Enterprise II to \ndetermine whether such a right attached to the PISA electronic surveillance proceedings in which \nthe sought-after orders and pleadings were filed.  Id. at 491-97. \nConsidering the \"experience\" test first, the Court in In re Motion for Release ofC  ourt \nRecords noted that \"[t]he FISC ha[ d] no ... tradition of openness\"; it ''ha[d ] never held a public \nhearing in its history\"; a \"total of two opinions ha[ d] been released to the public in nearly three \ndecades of operation\"; the Court \"ha[d ) issued literally thousands of classified orders to which \nthe public has had no access\"; there was \"no tradition of public access to government briefing \nmaterials filed with the FISC\" or FISC orders; and the publication of two opinions of broad legal \nsignificance failed to establish a tradition of public access given the fact that ''the FISC ha[ d] ... \nissued other legally significant decisions that remain classified and ha[ d] not been released to the \npublic ....\"   526 F. Supp. 2d at 492-93. Accordingly, the Court determined that ''the FISC is \nnot a court whose place or process has historically been open to the public\" and the \"experience\" \ntest was not satisfied. Id. at 493. \nAs far as the \"logic\" test was concerned, although the Court in In re Motion for Release \nofC ourt Records agreed that public access might result in a more informed understanding of the \nCourt's decision-making process, provide a check against \"mistakes, overreaching or abuse,\" and \nbenefit public debate, id. at 494, it found that ''the detrimental consequences of broad public \n-32-\n\naccess to FISC proceedings or records would greatly outweigh any such benefits\" and would \nactually imperil the functioning of the proceedings: \nThe identification of targets and methods of swveillance would permit adversaries \nto evade surveillance, conceal their activities, and possibly mislead investigators \nthrough  false  information.  Public  identification  of targets,  and  those  in \ncommunication with them, would also likely result in harassment of, or more \ngrievous  injury to,  persons who might be exonerated after full  investigation. \nDisclosures about confidential sources of information would chill current and \npotential sources from providing information, and might put some in personal \njeopardy. Disclosure of some forms of intelligence gathering could harm national \nsecurity in other ways, such as damaging relations with foreign governments. \nId.  The Court cautioned that \"(a]ll these possible harms are real and significant, and, quite \nfrankly, beyond debate,\" id., and \"the national security context applicable here makes these \ndetrimental consequences even more weighty,\" id. at 495.  In addition, after rejecting the \nACLU's argument that the Court should conduct an independent review of the Executive \nBranch's classification decisions under a non-deferential standard, the Court identified numerous \nways that \"the proper functioning of the FISA process would be adversely affected if submitting \nsensitive infonnation to the FISC could subject the Executive Branch's classification [decisions] \nto a heightened form ofj udicial review\": \nThe  greater  risk  of declassification  and  disclosure  over  Executive  Branch \nobjections would chill the government's interactions with the Court. That chilling \neffect could damage national security interests, if, for example, the government \nopted to forgo surveillance or search of legitimate targets in order to retain control \nof sensitive  information  that  a PISA  application  would  contain.  Moreover, \ngovernment officials might choose to conduct a search or surveillance without \nFISC approval where the need for such approval is unclear; creating such an \nincentive for government officials to avoid judicial review is not preferable. See \nOrnelas v.  United States, 511 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 \n(1996)  (noting  strong  Fourth  Amendment preference for  searches  conducted \npursuant to a warrant and adopting a standard of review that would provide an \nincentive  for  law  enforcement to  seek  warrants).  Finally,  in  cases  that  are \nsubmitted, the free flow of information to the FISC that is needed for an ex parte \nproceeding to result in sound decision[· ]making and effective oversight could also \nbe threatened. \n-33-\n\nId. at 496.  Finding that the weight of all these harms counseled against public access, the Court \nadopted the reasoning of other courts that \"have found that there is no First Amendment right of \naccess where disclosure would result in a diminished flow of information, to the detriment of the \nprocess in question,\" id., and remarked that this reasoning \"compels the conclusion that the \n'logic test' ... is not satisfied here,\" id. at 497. \nBecause both the \"experience\" and \"logic\" tests were ''unsatisfied,\" the Court concluded \nthat \"there (was] no First Amendment right of access to the requested materials.\" Id.  The Court \nalso declined to exercise its own discretion to \"undertake the searching review of the Executive \nBranch's classification decisions requested by the ACLU, because of the serious negative \nconsequences that might ensue ...., ,  Id.  The Court noted, however, that \"( o] f course, nothing \nin this decision forecloses the ACLU :from pursuing whatever remedies may be available to it in \na district court through a FOIA request addressed to the Executive Branch.\" Id. \nIn the motion that is now pending, the Movants acknowledge the decision in In re Motion \nfor Release ofC  ourt Records but argue that the decision erred by ( 1) \"limiting ~ts analysis to \nwhether two previously published opinions of this Court 'establish a tradition of public access\"' \nand (2) \"concluding that public access would 'result in a diminished flow of information, to the \ndetriment of the process in question.,,, Mot. for Release of Ct. Records 21 (quoting In re Motion \nfor Release ofC  ourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 493, 496).  Taldng these two arguments in \norder, the first argument is premised on a misreading of the Court's analysis and an overly broad \nframing of the legal question.  While examining the experience prong of Richmond Newspapers, \nthe Court did not \"limit'' its analysis to two previously-published opinions; to the contrary, the \nCourt made clear that its rationale for holding that there was no tradition of public access to \nFISC electronic surveillance proceedings was demonstrated by, as stated above, the lack of any \n-34-\n\npublic hearing in the (at that point) approximately 30 years in which the FISC had been operating \nand the fact that, with the exception o/only two published opinions, the entirety of the court's \nproceedings, which consisted of the issuance of thousands of judicial orders, was classified and \nthe \nunavailable to  public.  In re Motion/or Release ofC  ourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 492.  In \nother words, at that time, a minimum of99.98% of FISC proceedings was classified and \nnonpublic.  It would be an understatement to say that such a percentage reflected a tradition of no \npublic access.  Indeed, the Court found that \"the ACLU's First Amendment claim runs counter to \na long-established and virtually unbroken practice of excluding the public from FISA \napplications and orders ....\"  Id. at 493. \nThe Movants gain no traction challenging In re Motion for Release ofC  ourt Records by \nsuggesting that the framing of the \"experience\" test should be enlarged to posit whether public \naccess historically has been available to any \"judicial opinions interpreting the meaning and \nconstitutionality of public statutes,\" Mot. for Release of Ct. Records 14, rather than focusing on \nwhether FISC proceedings historically have been accessible to the public. Such an expansive \nframing of the type or kind of document or proceeding at issue plainly would sweep too broadly \nbecause it would encompass grand jury opinions, which often interpret the meaning and \nconstitutionality of public statutes but arise from grand jury proceedings, which are a \n\"paradigmatic example\" of proceedings to which no right of public access applies, In re Boston \nHerald, Inc., 321 F.3d 174, 183 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 9), and \na \"classic example\" of a judicial process that depends on secrecy to function properly, Press \nEnter. II, 478 U.S. at 9.  As demonstrated by the decision in Press-Enterprise II, the Supreme \nCourt certainly contemplated the consideration of narrower subsets of legal documents and \nproceedings in light of the fact that it entertained the question of whether the First Amendment \n- 35 -\n\nright of access applied to a subset ofj udicial hearing transcripts-i.e., \"the transcript of a \npreliminary hearing growing out of a criminal prosecution,\" 478 U.S. at 3-and never intimated \nthat its analysis should (or could) extend to transcripts of all judicial hearings growing out of a \ncriminal prosecutiqn.  Furthennore, to the extent the Movants take issue with the Court's \nfonnulation of the \"experience\" test on the ground that it focused too narrowly on FISC \npractices, Mot. for Release of Ct. Records 21 (arguing that the experience test \"does not look to \nthe particular practice of any one jurisdiction\"), the fact of the matter is that FISA mandates that \nthe FISC \"shall have jurisdiction to hear applications for and ~t orders approving electronic \nsurveillance anywhere within the United States,\" SO U.S.C. § 1803(a)(l), so the FISC's virtually-\nexclusive12 jurisdiction over such proceedings is a construct of Congress and, thereby, the· \nAmerican people.13  The Movants offer no authority to support a suggestion that the \nconcentration of FISC proceedings in one judicial forum detracts from the legitimacy or \ncorrectness of applying the \"experience\" test to FISC proceedings rather than a broader range of \nproceedings.  Accordingly, In re Motion for Release ofC  ourt Records properly framed the \n\"experience\" test to examine whether FISC proceedings-proceedings that relate to applications \nmade by the Executive Branch for the issuance of court orders approving authorities covered \nexclusively by FISA-have historically been open to the press and general public. \n12  See SO U.S.C. §§ 1803(a), 1.823(a), 1842(b)(l), 1861(b)(l)(A), 188lb(a), 1881c(a)(l). \nAlthough applications seeking pen registers, trap-and-trace devices, or certain business records \nfor foreign intelligence purposes may be submitted by f:he government to a United States \nMagistrate Judge who has been publicly designated by the Chief Justice of the United States to \nhave the power to hear such applications, FISA makes clear that the United States Magistrate \nJudge will be acting \"on behalf of' a judge of the FISC.  SO U.S.C. §§ 1842(b)(2), \n186l(b)(l)(B). In practice, no United States Magistrate Judge has been designated to entertain \nsuch applications. \n13  Although FISC proceedings occm in a single judicial forum, the district court judges \ndesignated to comprise the FISC are from at least seven of the United States judicial circuits \nacross the country.  50 U.S.C. § 1803(a){l). \n-36-\n\nAttending to the \"logic\" prong of the constitutional analysis, the Movants argue that the \nCourt \"erred in concluding that public access would 'result in a diminished flow of information, \nto the detriment of the process in question.,,, Mot for Release of Ct. Records 21 (quoting In re \nMotion for Release ofC  ourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 496). The Movants neglect, however, \nto explain why they believe this conclusion was flawed; nor do they otherwise refute the Court's \nidentification of the detrimental effects that could cause a diminished flow of infonnation as a \nresult of public access, see In re Motion for Release ofC  ourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 494-\n96.  Instead, the Movants offer the conclusory statement that \"disclosure of the requested \nopinions would serve weighty democratic interests by infonning the governed about the meaning \nof public laws enacted on their behalf.\" Mot. for Release of Ct. Records 21.  While it \nundoubtedly is the case that access to judicial proceedings and opinions plays an important, if not \nimperative, role in furthering the public's understanding about the meaning of public laws, the \nMovants cannot ignore the Supreme Court's instruction that, \"[a]lthough many governmental \nprocesses operate best under public scrutiny, it takes little imagination to recognize that there are \nsome kinds of government operations that would be totally frustrated if conducted openly.\" \nPress-Enter. JI, 418 U.S. at 8-9.  In re Motion for Release ofC  ourt Records identified \ndetrimental consequences that could be anticipated if the public had access to open FISC \nproceedings, some of which the Court noted were \"comparable to those relied on by courts in \nfinding that the 'logic' requirement for a First Amendment right of access was not satisfied \nregarding various types of proceedings and records\" and the others were described as \"distinctive \nto FISA's national security context.\"  526 F. Supp. 2d at 494.  These detrimental consequences, \nwhich are quoted above, were deemed to outweigh any benefits public access would add to the \nfunctioning of such proceedings, id., and the Court emphasized that \"the national security \n-37-\n\ncontext applicable here makes these detrimental consequences even more weighty,\" id. at 495. \nBecause the Movants made no attempt to dispute or discredit these detrimental effects, the \nresulting diminished flow of information that public access would have on the functioning of \nFISC proceedings, or the weight the Court gave to the detrimental effects, this Court is left to \nview their argument as simply a generalized assertion that they disagree with In re Motion for \nRelease ofC  ourt Records.14  That disagreement being duly noted, the Movants have not made a \npersuasive case that .the result was wrong.  Consequently, this Court has no basis to disclaim the· \nconclusion in Jn re Motion for Release ofC  ourt Records that the 'logic' test was \"not \nsatisfied[,]\" id. at 497, and, indeed, agrees with it. \nAlthough the records to which the ACLU sought access in In re Motion for Release of \nCourt Records implicated only electronic surveillance proceedings pursuant to SO U.S.C. \n§§  1804-1805, id. at 486, the analysis applying Richmond Newspapers' \"experience\" and ''logic\" \ntests involved reasoning that more broadly concerned all classified, ex parte FISC proceedings \nregardless of statutory section.  Id. 491-97.  Notwithstanding the passage of time, that analysis \nretains its force and relevance.15  The Court also sees no meaningful difference between the \n14  The Movants specify four ways public access to FISC judicial opinions is \"important to \nthe functioning of the PISA system,\" Mot. for Release of Ct. Records 17-20; however, the \nMovants never discuss these benefits vis-a-vis the detrimental effects identified by In re Motion \nfor Release ofC  ourt Records. \n15  Although there have been several public proceedings since In re Motion for Release of \nCourt Records was decided, see, e.g., Misc. Nos. 13-01through13-09, available at \nhttp://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/public-filings, the statistical significance of those public \nproceedings makes no material difference to the question of whether PISA proceedings \nhistorically have been open to the public, especially when considered in light of the many \nthousands more classified and ex parte proceedings that have occurred since that case was \nconcluded.  Furthennore, by and large, those public proceedings have been in the nature of this \none whereby, in the wake of the unauthorized disclosures about NSA programs, private parties \nmoved the Court for access to judicial records or for greater transparency about the number of \norders issued by the FISC to providers.  They are therefore distinguishable from the type of \n-38-\n\napplication of the \"experience,, and \"logic\" tests to FISC proceedings versus the application of \nthese tests to sealed wiretap applications pursuant to Title m of the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe·Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-20.  Like FISC proceedings, Title ill wiretap \napplications are \"subject to a statutory presumption against disclosure,\"16 \"have not historically \nbeen open to the press and general public,\" and are not subject to a qualified First Amendment \nright of access, Jn re N. Y. Times Co. to Unseal Wiretap & Search Wa\"ant Materials, 511 F.3d \n401, 409 (2d Cir. 2009) (emphasis in original).  Accordingly, persuaded by In re Motion for \nRelease ofC  ourt Records, this Court adopts its analysis and, for the reasons stated therein, as \nwell as those discussed above, holds that a First Amendment qualified right of access does not \napply to the FISC proceedings that resulted in the issuance of the judicial opinions the Movants \nnow seek, which consist of proceedings pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1842 (pen registers and trap and \ntrace devices for foreign intelligence and international terrorism investigations) and 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1861 (access to certain business records for foreign intelligence and international terrorism \ninvestigations). \nproceedings relevant to the instant motion and to In re Motion for Release ofC  ourt Records, \nnamely ex parte proceedings involving classified government requests for authority to conduct \nelectronic surveillance or other forms of intelligence collection. \n16  Title m mandates that wiretap \"[a]pplications made and orders granted under this chapter \nshall be sealed by the judge.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2518(8)(b).  As discussed supra, FISA mandates that \n\"[t]he record of proceedings under this chapter, including applications made and orders granted, \nshall be maintained under security measures established by the Chief Justice in consultation with \nthe Attorney General and the Director ofNational Intelligence.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1803(c). \n-39-\n\nv. \nAs already noted, the only law the Movants cite as· the source for their claimed right of \npublic access to FISC judicial opinions is the First Amendment.  If any other legal bases existed \nto secure constitutional standing for these Movants, they were obligated to present them. \nBecause the First Amendment qualified right of access does not apply to the FISC proceedings at \nissue in this matter, the Movants have no legally protected interest and cannot show that they \nsuffered an injury in fact for the purpose of meeting their burden to establish standing under \nArticle III. 17 \nTo be sure, the Court does not reach this result lightly.  However, application of the \nSupreme Court's test to detennine whether a First Amendment qualified right of access attaches \nto the FISC proceedings at issue in this matter leads to the conclusion that it does not.  Absent \nsome other legal basis to establish standing, this means the Court has no jurisdiction to consider \ncauses of action such as this one whereby individuals and organizations who are not parties to \nFISC proceedings seek access to classified judicial records that relate to electronic surveillance, \nbusiness records or pen register and trap-and-trace device proceedings. Notably, the D.C. Circuit \nhas advised that \"(e]ven if holding that [the litigant] lacks standing meant that no one could \ninitiate\" the cause of action at issue \"it would not follow that [the litigant] (or anyone else) must \nhave standing after all.  Rather, in such circumstance we would infer that 'the subject matter is \ncommitted to the surveillance of Congress, and ultimately to the political process.'\" Sargeant, \n17  The Court's decision involves scrutiny of whether the First Amendment qualified right of \naccess applies, but only as part of the assessment of whether the Movants have standing under \nm. \nArticle  Because they do not, the Court dismisses their Motion for lack ofj urisdiction \nwithout, strictly speaking, ruling on the merits of their asserted cause of action.  Moreover, in the \nabsence ofj urisdiction, the Court may not consider any other legal arguments or requests for \nrelief that were advanced in the motion. \n-40-\n\n130 F.3d at 1070 (quoting Richardson, 418 U.S. at 179).  Indeed, \"[t]he assumption that if[the \nlitigants] have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to find standing.\" \nSchlesingerv. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208 (1974). \nEvidence that public access to opinions arising from classified, ex parte FISC \nproceedings is best committed to the political process is demonstrated by Congress's enactment \nof the Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective Discipline \nOver Monitoring Act of 2015 (\"USA FREEDOM Act of2015\"), Pub. L. 114-23, 129 Stat 268 \n(2015), which, after considerable public debate, made substantial amendments to FISA. One \nsuch amendment, which is found in§ 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act and codified at SO U.S.C. \n§ 1872(a), added an entirely new provision for the public disclosure of certain FISC judicial \nopinions.  Consequently, FISA now states that \"the Director of National Intelligence, in \nconsultation with the Attorney General, shall conduct a declassification review of each decision, \norder, or opinion issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ... that includes a \nsignificant construction or interpretation of any provision of law, including any novel or \nsignificant construction or interpretation of the term 'specific selection term', and, consistent \nwith that review, make publicly available to the greatest extent practicable each such decision, \norder, or opinion.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1872(a). Although the Movants characterize the enactment of \nthis provision of the USA FREEDOM Act as evidence that \"favors disclosure of FISC opinions\" \nand bolsters their argument that ''public access would improve the functioning of the process in \nquestion,\" Notice of Supplemental Authority 2 (Dec. 4, 2015), the Court does not believe that \nthis provision alters the First Amendment analysis.  FISC proceedings of the type at issue \nhistorically have not been, nor presently will be, open to the press and general public given that \nno amendment to FISA altered the statutory mandate for such proceedings to occur ex parte and \n-41 -\n\npursuant to the aforementioned security measures established by the Chief Justice in consultation \nwith the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence.  Furthermore, although \nCongress had the opportunity to do so, it made no amendment to FISA that established a \nprocedure by which the public could seek or obtain access to FISC records directly from the \nCourt.  Rather, after informed debate, Congress deemed public access as contemplated by 50 \nU.S.C. § 1872(a) to be the means that, all things considered, best served the totality of the \nAmerican people's interests. Accordingly, the USA FREEDOM Act enhances public access to \nsignificant FISC decisions, as provided by§ 1872(a), and ensures that the public will have a \nmore informed understanding about how FISA is being construed and implemented, which \nappears to be at the heart of the Movants' interest.  Mot. for Release of Ct. Records 2 (stating \nthat \"Movants' current request for access to opinions of this Court evaluating the legality of bulk \ncollection seeks to vindicate the public's overriding interest in understanding how a far-reaching \nfederal statute is being construed and implemented, and how constitutional privacy protections \nare being enforced''). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will dismiss for lack ofj urisdiction the pending \nMOTION OF THE .AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION, THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \nTHE NATION'S CAPITAL, AND THE MEDIA FREEDOM AND INFORMATION ACCESS CLINIC FOR THE \nRELEASE OF COURT RECORDS.

On January 9, 2018, \nconsistent with  50  U.S.C.  § 1803(i)(2)(A),  the Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance \nCourt of Review (FISCR) appointed her as amicus curiae in this case to address the \nquestion of standing. Order of Jan. 9, 2018, FIS CR 18-01. FISCR held that Movants \nhad met the standing requirements and returned the case to address subject matter \njurisdiction and to address the motion on the merits. In re: Certification ofQ  uestions \nof Law to  the FISCR, FISCR No.  18-01  (FISA Ct.  Rev.  Mar.  16,  2018), at 7-8 \n[hereinafter FISCR Op.]. On May 1, 2018, the FISC appointed her as amicus curiae \nto address the remaining matters before the Court. [hereinafter Br. Order] \nXlV \n\nINTRODUCTION \nNeither Congress nor the executive can preclude Article III courts from fulfilling \ntheir constitutional role.  The national  legislature has  broad power to  determine \nwhether to establish lower courts and to define, within the categories of the cases \ndefined  in  Article  III,  the  kinds  of cases  those  courts  can  entertain.  But once \nCongress has called an Article III court into existence and defined its subject matter \njurisdiction, Congress cannot prevent it from exercising its core judicial function. \nThe judicial power is  the power to decide cases.  Young v.  United States  ex rel. \nVuitton,  481  U.S.  787,  816,  821  (1987)  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring).  The  final \ndetermination and the reasoning leading to it are beyond the reach of the other \nbranches.  If it  were  otherwise,  then  the  careful  protections  built  into  the  U.S. \nConstitution to create three, co-equal branches would be for naught. \nThis distinction, between an appropriate statutory assignment of subject matter \njurisdiction and the constitutional requirements at the heart of separation of powers, \nilluminates  the  questions  set  by the  court.  The  first  query,  whether there  is  a \n\"statutory grant of subject matter jurisdiction over ... access to judicial opinions\" \nassumes  that Congress can preclude public  access  to  the output of the judicial \nprocess. Br. Order at 1. It cannot. It is undisputed that FISC is an Article III court. \nAs soon as Congress brought it into being and granted it jurisdiction over domestic \nelectronic surveillance conducted for foreign intelligence purposes, it divested itself \n1 \n\nof interference in the court's core powers-including, most particularly, the court's \ndecisions, reasoning, and issuance of opinions on matters properly before it. \nThe second question requests \"any case law addressing the inherent authority of \na court of limited or specialized jurisdiction to adjudicate claims falling outside the \ncourt's subject matter jurisdiction, as explicitly granted by statute.\" Br. Order at 2. \nAll Article III courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. Bender v.  Williamsport Area \nSch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986). There are three Article III courts, aside from \nFISC and FISCR, with specialized subject matter. See App. A  10-17, 32-36. But \nspecialization says nothing about the inherent powers of lower federal courts qua \nArticle III bodies. Congress cannot control matters central to the administration of \njustice. \"Certain implied powers ... necessarily result to our Courts of justice from \nthe nature of their institution,\" powers \"which cannot be dispensed with in a Court, \nbecause they are necessary to the exercise of all others.\" United States v.  Hudson, \n11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32, 34 (1812). It would be hard to imagine a more fundamental \nviolation of that constitutional principle than efforts by the executive, or Congress, \nto claim that the Court has no jurisdiction over questions concerning public access \nto its own opinions, and that the other branches have the right to regulate the court's \ndecisions and to prevent citizens from seeing the results of the judicial process. \nThe  final  matter  on  which  the  Court  invites  discussion  goes  to  the  merits. \nMovants seek access to judicial opinions that carry the force of law. They involve \n2 \n\ncomplex constitutional and statutory interpretations which daily impact millions of \ncitizens' lives. The cases reveal illegal government behavior. The opinions, of which \nthere are now more than 60  in the public domain, serve as  precedent. Movants \ntherefore have a common law and a First Amendment right of access to them. Brief \nof Amicus Curiae, In re:  Certification of Questions of Law to the FISCR, FISCR \nDocket No. 18-01 (Feb. 23, 2018), at 3-24. This brief advances the conversation by \nurging the court to adopt the test followed by other Article III courts which routinely \nsubject classification claims to scrutiny. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nUnder separation of powers doctrine, Congress lacks the authority to pass statutes to \ngrant, or deny, the FISC jurisdiction over its opinions. All three branches agree that \nFISC  is  an  Article  III  court.  Constitutional  courts  are  vested with \"the judicial \npower\" of the United States, which is  insulated from the other two branches. It \nincludes the power to issue opinions disposing of cases. If the other branches could \nstrip the courts of authority over their judgments, they would be able to manipulate \nthe law, undermining the protections for judicial independence. The \"least dangerous \nbranch\" would lose all power. All it has is its judgments on matters of law. \nIn  2007  this  Court correctly held that it has  inherent authority  over its  own \nrecords. In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 486-87 \n(FISA Ct.  2007).  Congress has broad authority to  set the court's subject matter \n3 \n\njurisdiction. While specialized, FISC is an Article III court. Article III courts have \nessential inherent powers that stem from their responsibility to administer justice. \nHundreds of cases recognize such authorities. See App. B 52-70. To the extent that \ninherent powers may be merely useful or beneficial, courts can take the initiative but \nthen must give way to legislative direction. Insofar as inherent powers are essential \nor necessary to the execution of core judicial power, then Congress cannot interfere. \nACLU v. Holder, 673 F.3d 245, 255-56 (4th Cir. 2011); In re Stone, 986 F.2d 898, \n901-902 (5th Cir. 1993); Eash v. Riggins Trucking Inc., 757 F.2d 557, 562-63 (3d \nCir.  1985) (en bane). Issuance of opinions is a core judicial power. Control over \nthem is an essential inherent authority. Article III courts thus have authority over \ntheir own records.  Nixon  v.  Warner  Commc 'ns  Inc.,  435  U.S.  589,  598  (1978). \nCourts routinely exercise jurisdiction over third party requests. They continue to \nexercise this authority, without any statutory authorization, even decades after the \nunderlying action ends. See, e.g., United States v. Bus. a/Custer Battlefield Museum \n&  Stores,  658  F.3d  1188,  1192-96  (9th  Cir.  2011);  Chicago  Tribune  Co.  v. \nBridgestone/Firestone,  Inc.,  263  F .3d  1304,  1310-1313  (11th  Cir.  2001 );  In  re \nPetition of American Historical Association, 49 F.Supp.2d 274, 295 (1999).  The \ncourt in which the matter first occurred exercises jurisdiction. \nThe FISC has a critical role to play in determining which parts of its opinions \nshould be withheld from the public. The court is not unique in dealing with classified \n4 \n\n~ \n\\ \ni \nmatters. Article III courts confront, scrutinize and reject Executive Branch claims. \ni \n! \nSee App. C 76-96. To the extent that the executive attempts to masque matters of \nlaw, it grossly overreaches. For matters of fact, the FISC should apply the test used \nby  other  Article  III  courts,  taking  into  account  reasonableness,  good  faith, \nspecificity, and plausibility. \nARGUMENT \nI.  CONGRESS  CAN  NEITHER  GRANT  NOR  DENY  THE  FISC \nJURISDICTION OVER ITS OWN OPINIONS. \nA. The FISC is an Article III court. \nCongress created the FISC as an Article III constitutional court. 1 Congress continues \nto regard it as an Article III court. 2 Every court, including this one, to confront the \nquestion of whether the FISC is an Article III court has answered in the affirmative. 3 \nB.

Cal. 1985), aff'd, 788 F.2d \n566 (9th Cir. 1986). \n5 \n\nThe Constitution provides for \"the judicial power of the United States\" to \"be vested \nin one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to \ntime ordain and establish.\" Art. III, § 1. Congress, in turn, may \"constitute Tribunals \ninferior to the supreme Court.\" Art. I, §8. According to the Supreme Court, courts \nestablished under the specific power given in section 2 of Article III are  called \nconstitutional courts. They share in the exercise of the judicial power defined in that \nsection, can be invested with no other jurisdiction, and have judges who hold office \nduring good behavior, with no power in Congress to provide otherwise. \nEx parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U.S. 438, 449 (1929). Whether a court is Article III \nturns, first, on whether it satisfies the structural requirements of unity, supremacy, \nand inferiority within the judicial branch. James E.  Pfander, Article I  Tribunals, \nArticle Ill Courts, and the Judicial Power of the United States, 118 Harv. L. Rev. \n643, 649 (2004). See App. A 2-4. Second, the statute creating it must comply with \nthe requirements of good behavior, compensation, and case-or-controversy. Glidden \nCo. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 552 (1962) (Harlan, J., plurality opinion); App. A 4-6. \nCertain courts that do not meet these requirements are considered alternately \n\"non-constitutional,\" \"legislative,\" or \"Article I\" courts. App. A 6-7. They are \ncreated by Congress in the exertion of other powers .... Their functions always are \ndirected to the execution of one or more of such powers, and are prescribed by \nCongress independently of section 2 of Article III; and their judges hold for such \nterm as Congress prescribes, whether it be a fixed period of years or during good \nbehavior. \nEx parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U.S. at 449. Such courts \n6 \n\nare  not  constitutional  courts,  in  which  the  judicial  power  conferred  by  the \nConstitution on  the  general government can be  deposited ... They are  legislative \ncourts .... The jurisdiction with which they are invested is not a part of that judicial \npower which is defined in the 3d Article of the Constitution, but is conferred by \nCongress, in the execution of those general powers which that body possesses. \nAm. Ins. Co. v. 365 Bales a/Cotton (Canter), 26 U.S. (1Pet.)511, 546 (1828).4 This \ndistinction matters: non-constitutional courts do not exercise the judicial power of \nthe United States. Article III constitutional courts do. Stern v.  Marshall, 564 U.S. \n462, 494-95 (2011 ). \nC. The judicial power cannot be exercised by the political branches. \nThe U.S. Constitution, which does not elaborate on \"the judicial power,\" reflects \nEnglish  history  and  common  law  and  augments  it  in  important  ways.

Rev.  1010, 1017 (1924). In England, the judicial power was subservient to the \nCrown, but distinct.5 The Courts of the Exchequer, Common Pleas, King's Bench, \nand Chancery were imbued with the powers of the sovereign. 6 Despite being rooted \n4 See also The City ofP  anama, 101U.S.453, 460 (1879); Goodv.

[Judicial power] is only an emanation of the royal prerogative.\") \n7 \n\nin the Crown's prerogative, judicial power became increasingly independent. The \nAct of Settlement guaranteed tenure during good behavior and fixed salaries for \njudges, who exercised their power through a judicial function: applying law to fact \nand issuing judgments. Act of Settlement, 12 &  13 Will. III, c. 2, §3 (1701 ); 1 W.S. \nHoldsworth, A History of English Law 195 (A.L. Goodhart &  H.G. Hanbury eds., \n7th ed.  1956);  1 Blackstone, supra, at  *267-70. The courts had the authority to \nregulate proceedings, decide cases, provide for business, punish misconduct, and \nsupervise inferior tribunals. Robert J. Pushaw, Jr., The Inherent Powers ofF  ederal \nCourts and the Structural Constitution, 86 Iowa L.  Rev.  735, 809-16 (2001). No \nstatute was required for judges to undertake these tasks, or to adjudicate cases and \nissue opinions detailing their reasoning. It was part and parcel of the judicial power. \nThe United States adopted some aspects of the judicial power and introduced new \nauthorities and protections. Colonists saw access to common law as a right. See U.S. \nDeclaration of Rights, §5 (1774) (\"That the respective colonies are entitled to the \ncommon law of England.\") The inclusion of the terms \"law\" and \"equity\" into the \nConstitution became \"links in a chain binding out American courts to the institutions \nof Blackstone, Mansfield, Hale, Roll, Ellsmere, Coke, Bracton, Glanvil, and the \nbarons at Runnymead.\" Tyrrell Williams, The Source ofA uthority for Rules ofC  ourt \nAffecting Procedure, 22 Wash. U. L.Q. 459, 490 (1937). The Founders transferred \ncommon law to  the nascent institutions.  John  Jay,  as  Chief Justice,  announced, \n8 \n\n\"[T]his court consider[s] the practice of the courts of king's bench, and of chancery, \nin England, as affording outlines for the practice of this court; and that they will, \nfrom  time  to  time,  make  such  alterations  therein  as  circumstances  may  render \nnecessary.\" 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) xvi, 2 L. ed. 11 (1791). \nAmericans  also  departed  from  their  English  heritage  by  instituting  a  fully \nindependent, co-equal judicial branch. Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, \n219-23 (1995). The grant of power flowed directly from the people, strengthening \nthe courts' core powers. 7 \"This separation is not merely a matter of convenience or \nof governmental mechanism.  Its object is  basic and vital; namely, to preclude a \ncommingling of. .. essentially different powers of government in the same hands.\" \nO'Donoghue v.  United States, 289 U.S.  516,  530 (1933)  (citation omitted). The \nFramers  specifically directed that the  courts  \"should be  free  from  the  remotest \n7 Alexander Hamilton looked to separation of powers as a ''wholly new discover[y ]\" \nin the \"science of politics\" that enabled self-government. The Federalist No. 9, at 72 \n(Clinton Rossiter ed.  1961).  See also  id.,  No.  51  (James Madison);  id.,  No.  78 \n(Alexander Hamilton). Madison ruminated: \"No political truth is certainly of greater \nintrinsic value, or is  stamped with the  authority of more enlightened patrons of \nliberty.\" Id. No. 47, at 301. \"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, \nand judiciary, in the same hands ... may justly be pronounced the very definition of \ntyranny.\" Id.  Accordingly,  \"The functions  of government under our system are \napportioned. To the legislative department has been committed the duty of making \nlaws; to the executive the duty of executing them; and to the judiciary the duty of \ninterpreting  and  applying  them  in  cases  properly  brought  before  the \ncourts ... [N]either department may invade the province of the other, and neither may \ncontrol, direct or restrain the action of the other.\" Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. \n447, 488 (1923). See also Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327, 341 (2000). \n9 \n\ninfluence, direct or indirect, of either of the other two powers.\" 1 James De Witt \nAndrews,  The  Works of James  Wilson 299 (Robert Green McCloskey ed.,  1967) \n( 1804 ). They rejected the idea that the legislature could control the judicial power in \nany way. Delegates at the convention voted down the proposal to add a clause: \"In \nall the other cases before mentioned the judicial power shall be exercised in such \nmanner as the Legislature shall direct.\" 2 The Records oft he Federal Convention of \n1787 425, 431 (Max Farrand ed., rev. ed. 1966). \"A clearer rejection of congressional \nauthority over judicial powers is hard to imagine.\" Robert N. Clinton, A Mandatory \nView ofF  ederal Court Jurisdiction: A Guided Quest/or the Original Understanding \nofA  rticle III, 132 Pa. L. Rev. 741, 791 (1984). The founders further ensured judicial \nindependence with the good behavior and compensation clauses. There would have \nbeen no reason to do this if there were no powers reserved for the courts, conveyed \nthrough the grant of the judicial power. \"[W]here Art.  III does apply, all of the \nlegislative powers specified in Art. I and elsewhere are subject to it.\" N. Pipeline v. \nMarathon Pipe Line, 458 U.S. 50, 73 (1982) (Brennan, J.). \nD. The judicial power includes the power to dispose of cases. \nAs recognized from the earliest days of the Republic, it is within the purview of the \njudiciary to dispose of cases. \"It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial \ndepartment to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must \nof necessity,  expound and  interpret that  rule.\"  Marbury  v.  Madison,  5  U.S.  (1 \n10 \n\nCranch) 137, 177 (1803). Adjudication entails applying law to the facts of the case, \nbefore rendering a final, binding judgment. Once this process is put into motion, \nCongress and the executive cannot interfere. See United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 \nWall.)  128 (1871). Nor can they insert themselves into the process after the fact. \nHayburn 's Case, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 409 (1892). See also Plaut, 514 U.S. at 217-18. If \nthe  political  branches  could interfere,  not just by  overturning  the  court's  final \njudgment but by stripping the court of authority over its own opinions, it would \nrender the independence of the judiciary of no consequence. It would not matter \nwhat the Court said or did. All the courts have is their judgment as to matters of law. \nIft heir determinations could be seized and buried, they would cease to have the force \nof law, undermining the courts' basic adjudicatory function. The legislature cannot, \nas a constitutional matter, use a statutory provision to interfere with an Article III \ncourt's  control  over  its  own  opinions.  The  source  of the  court's  power  is \nconstitutional. See Marbury, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 176-77, 180. \"[I]f a case involved \nan executive effort to extend a law beyond its meaning, judges would have a duty to \nadhere to the law that had been properly promulgated under the Constitution.\" Perez \nv. Mortg. Bankers Ass 'n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1220 (2015). \nII. THE FISC HAS ESSENTIAL INHERENT AUTHORITY OVER ITS OWN \nRECORDS. \nThe FISC has asked us to provide \"any case law addressing the inherent authority of \na court of limited or specialized jurisdiction to adjudicate claims falling outside the \n11 \n\ncourt's subject matter jurisdiction.\" Br. Order at 2. All federal courts are courts of \nlimited jurisdiction. 8  \"[T]he  power which  congress  possess  to  create  Courts  of \ninferior jurisdiction, necessarily implies the power to limit the jurisdiction of those \nCourts to particular objects.\" Hudson, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) at 33. Specialization does \nnothing to alter the FISC 's status as an Article III court. As such, upon its creation, \nCongress vested the FISC with certain inherent powers. Jn re Motion/or Release of \nCourt Records, 526 F.  Supp. 2d at 486-87. In reviewing applications, \"The FISA \ncourt retains  all  of the  inherent powers that any court has  when  considering a \nwarrant. There is no delegation of judicial power to the Executive Branch.\" In re \nKevork,  634  F.  Supp.  at  1014.  In  drafting  opinions,  an  action  contemplated by \nCongress, the FISC has the inherent power of any Article III court. See 50 U.S.C. \n§§1803(a)(l),  1803(b) (2012).  \"Every court has  supervisory power over its  own \nrecords and files.\" Nixon, 435 U.S. at 598. Accord Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, \n377 F.3d 133, 140 (2d Cir. 2004); Brown &  Williamson Tobacco Corp .. v. Federal \nTrade Comm'n, 710 F.2d 1165, 1177 (6th Cir. 1983). \"[FISC's] inherent power over \nits records  [therefore] supplies the authority to consider a claim of legal right to \nrelease of those records.\" In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F.Supp.2d \n8 See Patchak v.  Zinke,  138 S.  Ct. 897, 906-07 (2018); Gunn v.  Minton, 568 U.S. \n251, 256-58 (2013); Bender, 475 U.S. at 541; Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, \n374 (1978); Owen Equip. & Kline v.

Am., 4 U.S. (4 Dall.) 8, \n10 (1799). \n12 \n\nat 487. \"Courts invested with the judicial power of the United States have certain \ninherent  authority  to  protect their proceedings  and judgments  in  the  course  of \ndischarging their traditional responsibilities.\" Degen v.  United States, 517 U.S. 820, \n823 (1996). The FISC had subject matter jurisdiction over the four cases in which \nthe opinions were issued. See 50 U.S.C. §§1841-46, 1861-64. It therefore has the \nauthority to hear motions seeking their disclosure. \nA. Article III courts have essential inherent powers. \nAll three branches have what are variously called \"inherent,\" \"implied,\" \"essential,\" \nor  \"incidental\"  powers,  which  are  authorities  necessary  to  the  performance  of \nexpress constitutional powers. See, e.g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.  v.  Sairyer, \n343  U.S.  579, 647 (1952) (Jackson, J.,  concurring). They adhere to an office by \nnature of its function. The Founders universally agreed on their existence. Hamilton \nruminated  on  the  \"striking  absurdity\"  of a  government  unable  to  exercise  its \nnecessary implied authority.  The Federalist No.  21, at  139 (Clinton Rossiter ed. \n1961). See also id., No.  44 (James Madison); McCulloch v.  Maryland,  17 U.S. (4 \nWheat.) 316, 409 (1819). \n1. Inherent judicial powers stem from the courts' role of administering justice. \nEarly on, the Supreme Court recognized the existence of inherent judicial powers \nthat lie beyond the reach of Congress. See Ex parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 75, \n93-94 (1807); Chisholm v.  Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419, 433 (1793) (Iredell, J., \ndissenting). In 1812, the Court held that \"[c  ]ertain implied powers must necessarily \n13 \n\nresult to our Courts of justice from the nature of their institution.\" Hudson, 11 U.S. \n(7 Cranch) at 34. \"[N]ot immediately derived from statute,\" such powers also could \nnot \"be dispensed with in a Court, because they are necessary to the exercise of all \nothers.\" Id. Jurisdiction stemmed from \"[the] creation\" of a court. Id. at 33. \n[U]pon the formation of any political body, an implied power to preserve its own \nexistence and promote the  end and object of its  creation, necessarily results  to \nit .... [T]hat is  a principle by no means peculiar to the common law. It is  coeval, \nprobably, with the first formation of a limited Government, belongs to a system of \nuniversal law. \nId.  at 33-34. The Court has since repeatedly recognized its inherent powers. 9 As a \nmatter of longstanding common law, they stem from the administration ofj ustice. 10 \nThe Supreme Court has not articulated a test for what constitutes an inherent power. \nNevertheless,  hundreds  of cases  illuminate  the  range  of inherent  authorities \nacknowledged by the courts. App. B 52-70. They divide into three categories: the \npower to (a) ensure fairness,  (b) facilitate efficient processes, and ( c) protect the \nintegrity, independence, and reputation of the judiciary. Id. On their own authority, \ncourts, for instance, can appoint auditors, special masters, and commissioners; order \ndiscovery procedures; require production of witness statements; and issue in limine \n9 See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43 (1991); Roadway Express, Inc. v. \nPiper, 447 U.S. 752, 764 (1980); Link v.  Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 633 \n(1962). See also App. B. \n10 See Michaelson v.

See United States ex rel. Consol. Elec. Distribs., \nInc.  v.  A/tech,  Inc.,  929  F.2d  1089,  1091-92  (5th  Cir.  1991).  Similarly,  \"[A]  I \n; \nprotective order, like any ongoing injunction, is always subject to the inherent power  ~ \nof the district court to relax or terminate the order, even after judgment.\" Poliquin v. \nI \nGarden  Way,  Inc.  989 F.2d 527,  535  (1st Cir.  1993).15  A  court \"can modify a \nprotective order when a third-party requests judicial documents after the parties have  I \nfiled a stipulation of dismissal.\" Gambale, 3 77 F .3d at 141. A \"court may order that \na filing be made under seal. .. [and]  may later unseal the filing.\" Fed. R.  Civ. P. \n11 See, e.g., Luce v.  United States, 469 U.S. 38, 41 n.4 (1984); Harris v.

Young, 481 U.S. at 798. \"There can \nbe no question that courts have inherent power to enforce compliance\" after the \nconclusion of a case. Shillitani v.  United States, 384 U.S. 364, 370 (1966). Courts \nalso  have  inherent powers  over matters  that have  never been before them.  For \ninstance, they can answer letters rogatory. Jn re Letter Rogatory, 523 F.2d 562, 564 \n(6th Cir. 1975); United States v. Reagan, 453 F.2d 165, 173 (6th Cir. 1971); United \nStates v. Staples, 256 F.2d 290, 292 (9th Cir. 1958). They can bind and be bound by \ndecisions of other courts, ensuring stare decisis as a matter of vertical and horizontal \nparity. Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 235 (1997). Courts have inherent power to \nregulate bar admission and the practice of law. Ex parte Burr, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) \n529, 531 (1824). Cf Chambers, 501 U.S. at 42-43; Roadway Express, 447 U.S. at \n764. And the judiciary can sanction individuals for unauthorized legal practice. See \nUnited States v. Johnson, 327 F.3d 554, 560 (7th Cir. 2003). \n2.  Essential inherent powers are distinguishable from those that are merely \nbeneficial. \nThe Supreme Court, which recognizes the judiciary's inherent powers, treats each \ncase individually. Lower courts, looking to the Court's holdings in each context and \nto decisions of other courts, divide inherent powers into three categories: irreducible \ninherent authority, \"essential\" inherent powers, and authorities merely ''useful\" or \n16 \n\n\"beneficial\" to the administration of justice. See Holder, 673 F.3d at 255-56; In re \nStone, 986 F.2d at 901-02; Eash, 757 F.2d at 562-63; United States v. Brainer, 691 \nF.2d 691, 695-96 (4th Cir. 1982). Powers in the first two categories are beyond the \nreach of Congress. \nThe first category delineates powers that are \"so fundamental to the essence of a \ncourt as a constitutional tribunal that to divest the court of absolute command within \nthis sphere is really to render practically meaningless the terms 'court' and 'judicial \npower.\"' Eash, 757 F.2d at 562. Once a court has been brought into being, Article \nIII vests it with certain authorities. \"Within the scope of these powers, the other \nbranches of government may not interfere; any legislation purporting to regulate \nthese  inherent powers  would  be  invalid  as  an  unconstitutional  violation  of the \ndoctrine of separation of powers.\" In re Stone, 986 F.2d at 901.16 \nFor the second category, essential inherent powers, the standard set by Hudson is \none of indispensable necessity-i.e., those powers \"necessary to the exercise of all \nothers.\" 11  U.S. (7 Cranch) at 34.17 Contempt provides a good example. Since the \nfounding, there has been extensive legislation governing it. See Judiciary Act of \n1789,  ch.  20,  §17,  1  Stat.  73,  83.  Nevertheless,  there  are  early  and  repeated \n16 See United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. at 146-47. \n17 See also Roadway Express, 447 U.S. at 764; In re Terry, 128 U.S. 289, 303 \n(1888). \n17 \n\ndiscussion of the court's contempt powers.18 Whatever the legislature may try to do, \nit cannot divest the judiciary of this power. Because essential inherent powers flow \nfrom necessity, they can \"neither be abrogated nor rendered practically inoperative\" \nby Congress. Michaelson, 266 U.S. at 66.19 \nThe third category \"implicates powers necessary only in the practical sense of \nbeing useful.\" Eash, 757 F.2d at 562. It derives from the fact that Congress cannot \nenvision every tool that the courts might need to undertake their tasks; therefore, the \njudiciary can act until the legislature decides to invalidate such actions. 20 \"This third \ncategory of inherent power has sometimes been said to be 'rooted in the notion that \na federal court, sitting in equity, possesses all of the common law equity tools of a \nChancery Court (subject, of course, to congressional limitation) to process litigation \nto a just and equitable conclusion.' Eash, 757 F.2d at 562 (quoting ITT Cmty. Dev. \nCorp. v. Barton, 569 F.2d 1351, 1359 (5th Cir. 1978).\" \nB. Authority over judicial records is an essential inherent power. \nThe  Constitution  does  not  expressly assign the power to  issue  opinions to  any \ndepartment. In the absence of an express grant of authority, control must be exercised \n18 See,  e.g.,  Ex parte Robinson, 86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 505, 510 (1873); Anderson v. \nDunn, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 204, 227 (1821); Hudson, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) at 34. See \nalso United States v. Duane, 25 F. Cas. 920, 922 (C.C.D. Pa. 1801) (No. 14,997). \n19 See also Eash, 757 F.2d at 562; Levine v. United States, 362 U.S. 610, 615 (1959); \nCooke v. United States, 267 U.S. 517, 539 (1925); Michaelson, 266 U.S. at 65; Myers \nv.  United States, 264 U.S. 95 (1924); Anderson, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) at 226. \n20 See,  e.g.,  United States v.  Hasting, 461  U.S. 499, 505 (1983); Alyeska Pipeline \nService v.  Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 259 (1975) \n18 \n\nby the department to which it naturally belongs. \"The judicial department is invested \nwith jurisdiction in certain specified cases, in all of which it has the power to render \njudgment.\" Wayman v.  Southard, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 1, 11  (1825). \"Courts have \nrecognized that a judicial opinion deciding a case lies at the heart of the exercise of \nArticle  III  powers.\"  Doe  v.  Apfel,  No.  98-CV-182,  1999  WL  182669,  at  *3 \n(E.D.N.Y. Mar.  22,  1999). \"The whole work done by the judges constitutes the \nauthentic exposition and interpretation of the law.\" Banks v.  Manchester, 128 U.S. \n244, 253 (1888). Congress cannot dictate to the Courts how to decide cases, and it \ncan neither require a court to issue, nor forbid the court from issuing, a decision. \nPerhaps the most famous case comes from Justice Stephen Field, with whom \nChief Justice  Terry  (on this  occasion)  agreed.  California had  adopted a  statute \nsaying, \"that all opinions given upon an appeal in any Appellate Court of this State, \nshall be in writing, with the reason therefor, and filed with the Clerk of the Court.\" \n1854 Cal. Stats. 72. The state Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional: \nThe Legislature can no more require this Court to state the reasons of its decisions, \nthan this Court can require, for the validity of the statutes, that the Legislature shall \naccompany them with the reasons for their enactment. The principles of law settled \nare to be extracted from the records of the cases in which the decisions are rendered. \nHouston v.  Williams, 13 Cal. 24, 25 (1859) (Field, J.). The legislature was trying to \nusurp judicial power: \"To accede to it any obligatory force would be to sanction a \nmost palpable encroachment upon the independence of this department.\" Id. \n19 \n\nIf the power of the Legislature to prescribe the mode and manner in which the \nJudiciary shall discharge their official duties be once recognized, there will be no \nlimit to the dependence of the latter. If the Legislature can require the reasons of our \ndecisions to be stated in writing, it can forbid their statement in writing, and enforce \ntheir oral announcement, or prescribe the paper upon which they shall be written, \nand the ink which shall be used. And yet no sane man will justify any such absurd \npretension, but where is the limit to this power if its exercise in any particular be \nadmitted? The truth is, no such power can exist in the Legislative Department, \nor be sanctioned by any Court which has the least respect for its own dignity \nand independence. \nId.  (emphasis added). The constitutional duty of the Court was \"discharged by the \nrendition of decisions.\" Id.  While the legislature might have the right to regulate \njurisdiction, \"it cannot destroy\" the court's authority to \"exercise the jurisdiction \nconferred.\" Carter v.  Commonwealth, 32 S.E. 780, 785 (Va. 1899). \nIf the issuance of judicial opinions is a core judicial power, then control over \nthose opinions must be an essential inherent power. Should it be otherwise, it would \nundermine the role of the courts in adjudicating cases. \"Courts of record can speak \nonly by or through their records, and what does not so appear does not exist in law.\" \n20 Am. Jur.  2d Courts §22 (2018). \"The court record is the permanent account of \nthat  court's  proceedings  in  particular  cases,  as  well  as  the  court's  opinion  or \ndecision.\" Id. If the other branches could divest the courts of ownership over their \nrecords,  they could alter the principles  of law according to  their own interests. \nAccordingly, courts recognize their inherent authority \"to protect their proceedings \nand judgments in the course of discharging their traditional responsibilities.\" Degen \nv.  United States, 517 U.S. at 823. They have the power \"to protect the efficient and \n20 \n\norderly administration of justice and those necessary to command respect for the \ncourt's orders, judgments, procedures, and authorities.\" In re Stone, 986 F.2d at 902. \n1.  Courts routinely exercise jurisdiction over third party requests for \nrecords. \nCourts control their own records. Nixon, 435 U.S. at 597-98; Gambale, 377 F.3d at \n140; Brown, 710 F.2d at 1177. They routinely exercise jurisdiction over third party \nmotions for common law or First Amendment right of access to court documents-\nranging from applications for warrants to judicial opinions. 21  The tipping point is \nwhether the records are ''judicial documents,\" understood as materials that go to \"the \nexercise of Article III judicial power.\" United States v. Amodeo (Amodeo II), 71 F .3d \n1044, 104 7-48 (2d Cir. 1995). The moment at which they become so, the public has \na presumptive right of access through the court in which they were filed. See, e.g., \nLugosch, 435  F.3d at  119; Amodeo 11,  71  F.3d at 1048-52; Stern v.  Cosby,  529 \nF.Supp.2d 417  (S.D.N.Y.  2007). In none of the cases in which the Courts have \nentertained requests for their records has Congress made a statutory grant of power \nto the courts over the records in question. Nevertheless, the Courts consider such \n21  See, e.g., Doe v. Pub.  Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 265-68 (4th Cir. 2014); Nixon, 435 \nU.S. 589; United States v. Kravetz, 706 F.3d 47, 56-59 (1st Cir. 2013); Lugosch v. \nPyramid Co.  of Onondaga,  435  F.3d  110,  119-124,  126  (2d  Cir.  2006);  Jn  re \nProvidence Journal Co., 293 F.3d I, 9-13 (1st Cir. 2002); United States v.  Corbitt, \n879 F.2d 224, 228 (7th Cir. 1989); In re Wash. Post Co., 807 F.2d 383, 390 (4th Cir. \n1986); United States v. Smith, 77 6 F .2d 1104, 1107-1113 (3d Cir. 1985); Belo Broad. \nCorp. v.  Clark, 654 F.2d 423, 429-30 (5th Cir. 1981); United States v. Myers (In re \nNat'! Broad. Co.), 635 F.2d 945, 947-48 (2d Cir. 1980). \n21 \n\nrequests well within their power. These cases include materials deep in litigation22\n-\nto say nothing of the final judgment of the court. \n2.  Courts continue to exercise jurisdiction after the conclusion of the matter \nbefore the court. \nCourts continue to exercise jurisdiction over their records and opinions after the \nconclusion oft he matter before the court. 23 They have \"the inherent power to correct \nerrors, remedy omissions, and correct clerical errors in its records.\" 20 Am. Jur. 2d \nCourts §25 (2018). They have the \"power to modify or lift protective orders that \n[have been] entered.\" In re Agent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., 821 F.2d 139, 145 (2d \nCir.  1987). They can unseal records after the fact.  See Doe, 749 F.3d at 252-53; \nOregonian Pub.  Co.  v.  US. District Court, 920 F.2d 1462, 1468 (9th Cir.  1990). \nThey can re-open a case. See United States v. Alcantara, 396 F.3d 189, 201 (2d Cir. \n2005). \"The jurisdiction of a Court is not exhausted by the rendition of its judgment, \nbut continues.\" Wayman, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) at 23-24. Courts can punish those who \nmight \"disregard ... the product of their functioning, their judgments.\" Young, 481 \n22 See,  e.g., United States v.  Sealed Search Warrants, 868 F.3d 385, 390 (5th Cir. \n2017)  (holding  that  the  district  court  had jurisdiction  to  determine  whether  a \ncommon law qualified right of access extended to pre-indictment search materials). \n23 See,  e.g., Doe v.  United States, 853 F.3d 792 (5th Cir. 2017) (A court \"has the \npower to  manage  its  records,  even though the  proceeding that  generated those \nrecords has concluded.\"); Qureshi v.  United States, 600 F.3d 523,  525 (5th Cir. \n2010)  (\"That the  court  loses jurisdiction over the  litigation  does  not,  however, \ndeprive the district court of its inherent supervisory powers.\" (citing Cooter & Gell \nv. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 395 (1990)). \n22 \n\nU.S. at 787, 821  (Scalia, J., concurring) (emphasis in original). Third parties seek \nand are granted access to judicial documents after the underlying matter concludes. 24 \nNone oft hese cases rely on statutory authorities. They rely on Article III inherent \npowers. Some go so far as to recognize it even when it conflicts with the statutorily-\nderived rules. See, e.g., Jn re Petition of Craig, 131F.3d99, 103 (2d Cir. 1997). In \none  case,  historians  filed  a  motion  requesting  that  a  court  unseal  grand  jury \ntranscripts from an Espionage Act case seventy years prior. Carlson v. United States, \n837 F.3d 753, 757-61 (7th Cir. 2016). The district court regarded the request as well \nwithin its power. Id. On appeal, the court noted that \"Every federal court to consider \nthe issue\" has determined that \"a district court's limited inherent power to supervise \na grand jury includes the power to unseal grand-jury materials when appropriate.\" \nId. at 755-56. The plaintiff chose the Northern District of Illinois, \nbecause it was the court that originally had supervisory jurisdiction over the grand \njury  in  question.  He  argued  that  this  same  court  has  continuing  common-law \nauthority over matters pertaining to that grand jury. \nId. at 757 (emphasis added). It did not matter that Carlson had no connection to the \nunderlying action. Id. at 759. \"Representatives of the press and general public must \nbe given an opportunity to be heard on the question of. .. access to documents. Id. \n24 See, e.g., Douglas Oil v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 441U.S.211 (1979); Custer, 658 \nF.3d at 1192-96; Chicago, 263 F.3d at 1310-13; Jn re Nat'! Sec. Archive, No. 08 Civ. \n* \n6599, 2008 WL 8985358, at  1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2008); Jn  re Petition of Am. \nHistorical Ass 'n, 49 F. Supp. at 295. See also App. B. \n23 \n\n(quoting Jessup v.  Luther, 227 F.3d 993, 997 (7th Cir. 2000). \"To hold otherwise \nwould raise First Amendment concerns.\" Id. Cf United States v. Edwards, 672 F.2d \n1289, 1294 (7th Cir.  1982). The line is the point at which the documents become \npart of the judicial record. \nIII. THE FI_SC  HAS A  CRITICAL ROLE  TO  PLAY IN DETERMINING \nWHAT  INFORMATION  CONTAINED  IN  ITS  OPINIONS  SHOULD  BE \nMADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. \nIn 1971, the executive tried to assert absolute power over classified material essential \nto the administration of justice. The court rejected the government's argument: \nThe government's position .. .is that this determination by the executive official is \nconclusive upon the court, and the court has no judicial authority to require the \nproduction of the documents in the possession of an executive department, once the \nhead of that department has filed this formal claim of privilege. Government counsel \nfurther  asserts  that this  executive  determination  is  conclusive ... even  where the \ndocument is such that the court may readily separate factual material to be disclosed \nto the other party from the kind of recommendations and discussion that would be \nan integral part of the decision-making process. \nCommittee for Nuclear Responsibility, Inc. v. Seaborg, 463 F. 2d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. \n1971 ).  The D.C. Circuit stated, \"In our view,  this claim of absolute immunity for \ndocuments  in possession  of an  executive department  or agency,  upon  the  bald \nassertion ofi ts head, is not sound law.\" Seaborg, 463 F. 2d at 792 (emphasis added). \nOnce again, the executive is attempting to convince the court that it has no role \nto play in scrutinizing executive assertions of power over materials central to the \njudicial function. To support its claim, the government misconstrues Department of \nthe Navy v.  Egan, 484 U.S.  518 (1988), as  standing for the proposition that the \n24 \n\n.executive has complete control of classified information, and that the judiciary is ill-\nsuited to make national security judgments. 25 See App. C 72-76 . That is not what the \ncourt held.  \"The narrow question presented\" was whether a statute gave a non-\nArticle III tribunal control over security clearance decisions within the executive \nbranch. Egan, 484 U.S. at 520. The holding did not reach the power of Article III \ncourts.  The executive  further states that the \"claim of unilateral FISC power to \noverride the Executive's classification decisions is completely devoid of merit.\" U.S. \nReply Br. at 6. CfU.S. Opening Br. at 20-22. This statement ignores the actual role \nthat the judiciary regularly plays in scrutinizing classification determinations. \nA. The FISC is not unique in dealing with classified matters. \nArticle III courts routinely confront classified material in the context of litigation. \nHundreds of cases give rise to state secrets assertions, Exemption 1 claims under the \nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA), use of the Classified Information Procedures \nAct, and other efforts to keep the material from reaching the public domain. App. C \n25 See United States' Reply Brief at 6-7, In re: Certification of Questions ofL  aw to \nthe FISCR, No. 18-01  (FISA Ct. Rev. Mar. 5, 2018) (hereinafter U.S. Reply Br.); \nOpening Brief for the United States at 20-22, In re:  Certification of Questions of \nLaw to  the FISCR, No.  18-01  (FISA Ct.  Rev.  Feb.  23,  2018)  (hereinafter U.S. \nOpening Br.); United States' Opposition to the Motion of the ACLU for the Release \nof Court Records at 11-12, In re Opinions and Orders oft his Court Containing Novel \nor Significant Interpretations of Law, No. Misc.  16-01  (FISA Ct.

No. Apr. 17, 2017). \n25 \n\n76-80. Between 2001  and 2009 alone, more than 100 cases involved state secrets \nprivilege. App. C 77-78. They addressed a wide range of matters: breach of contract; \npatent disputes; trade secrets; fraud; employment termination; wrongful death and \npersonal  injury;  negligence;  allegations  of torture;  environmental  degradation; \nbreach of espionage  contracts;  defamation;  criminal  conduct;  and  constitutional \nviolations. Id.  Since 2009, courts have disposed of another 74 cases, dealing with \neverything from defamation, discrimination, personal injury, and wrongful death, to \nconstitutional claims related to the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments. Id. \nThe government also makes broad use of Exemption 1. Id at 79. Since 1977, it has \nasserted it in at least 377 FOIA cases in the Courts of Appeals and the D.C. District \nCourt. Id.  This number is just a fraction of the total. Id.  at n.27. In more than 50 \ncriminal cases, the courts have noted the discovery of classified information by \ndefendants and in 89 cases procedures involving classified information. Id. at 79-80. \nB. Article III courts routinely scrutinize and at times reject Executive Branch \nclassification determinations. \nArticle III courts routinely scrutinize classified material to determine whether it \nshould be made publicly available. 26 In Al-Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v. Bush, \nthe court conducted a thorough \"independent determination whether the information \nis privileged,\" explaining, \"We take very seriously our obligation to review the \n26 See, e.g., Mohamedv. Jeppensen DataPlan, 614 F.3d 1070 (9th Cir. 2010); United \nStates v. Moussaoui, 65 Fed. App'x. 881, 888 (4th Cir. 2003); App. C. \n26 \n\ndocuments with a very careful, indeed a skeptical, eye, and not to accept at face value \nthe government's claim or justification of privilege.\" 507 F. 3d 1190, 1202-03 (9th \nCir. 2007). In Hepting v.  AT&T Corp., the executive had publicly discussed the \nprogram-similar to the current matter, where the government has acknowledged \n§215  metadata  collection.  \"Because  the  government  contends  that  the  primary \nreasons  for  rejecting Plaintiffs'  arguments  are  set  forth  in  the  Government's in \ncamera, ex parte materials,\" the Hepting court noted, \"the court would be remiss not \nto consider those classified documents in determining whether this action is barred \nby the privilege.\" Hepting v. AT&T Corp., No. C-06-672 VRW, 2006 WL 1581965, \n* \nat  1 (N.D. Cal. June 6, 2006) (internal quotation and citation omitted). \nExamination of the Government's claim must be done on an item by item basis, \nas \"a court must not merely unthinkingly ratify the executive's assertion of absolute \nprivilege, lest it inappropriately abandon its important judicial role.\" In re US., 872 \nF.  2d  472,  475  (D.C.  Cir.  1989).  \"In  addressing  challenges  under  the  First \nAmendment . . . courts must keep in mind that 'debate on public issues should be \nuninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, \nand sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks  on government and public officials.\"' \nWright v. FBI, 613 F. Supp. 2d 13, 22 (D.D.C. 2009) (quoting New York Times v. \nSullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964)). Thus, while courts \"must take seriously the \ngovernment's  predictions  about  the  security  implications  of releasing particular \n27 \n\ninformation to the public,\" ultimately a court \"make[ s] its own decision\" about what \nmaterial should, and should not, remain classified. ACLU v. FBI, 429 F. Supp. 2d \n179,  188  (D.D.C.  2006).  Sometimes  that  means  releasing  information  that  the \ngovernment would rather not see light of day. 27 In New York Times v. United States, \nfor instance, the Court refused to allow national security claims to override First \nAmendment rights. 403 U.S. 713, 718-19 (1971). In Horn v. Huddle, Judge Royce \nLamberth denied the government's assertion of the state secrets privilege. 636 F. \nSupp. 2d 10, 14-15 (D.D.C. 2009) vacated on other grounds, Horn v.  Huddle, 699 \nF. Supp. 2d 236 (D.D.C. 2010). The court weighed whether the government had met \nthe procedural requirements, the litigants' need for the information in question, and \nthe plausibility and substantiality of \"the government's allegations of danger to the \nnational security.\" Horn v. Huddle, 647 F.Supp. 2d 55, 56-57 (D.D.C. 2009) vacated \non  other grounds,  699  F.  Supp.  2d  236.  Lamberth  concluded,  \"The  deference \ngenerally granted the Executive Branch in  matters of classification and national \nsecurity  must  yield  when  the  Executive  attempts  to  exert  control  over  the \ncourtroom.\" Huddle, 647 F.Supp. 2d at 65-66. These cases are not isolated. In 102 \nof the 264 Exemption 1 FOIA cases that arose between 1977 and 2012 in the Courts \nof Appeals and the D.C. District Court, the court conducted in camera review. Forty-\n27  See,  e.g.,  United States  v.  Smith,  780  F.2d  1102  (4th  Cir.  1985);  Rahman  v. \nChertojf, No.  05  C 3761, 2008  WL 4534407,  at  *11  (N.D.  Ill.  Apr.  16, 2008); \nHepting, 2006 WL 1581965 at *1; Jabra v. Kelly, 62 F.R.D. 424 (E.D. Mich. 1974). \n28 \n\nnine of these cases resulted in partial disclosure. App. C 89. A thirty-nine percent \npartial denial rate for in camera cases suggests that the judiciary does scrutinize \nExecutive Branch claims. The burden is on the government to demonstrate that the \nmaterial must be withheld. See Halpern v. FBI, 181F.3d279, 295 (2d Cir. 1999); \nDOJv. Landano, 508 U.S. 165, 171 (1993); App. C 89-90. \nC. The FISC should apply a test based on reasonableness, good faith, specificity, \nand plausibility. \nInsofar as the government claims that matters of law must remain hidden, the court \nshould regard such claims as highly suspect. Rule of law requires that the law itself \nbe known. As far as matters of fact are concerned, while the court may want to give \nthe assertion from the government weight, the court is entirely within its rights as an \nArticle III body to scrutinize such claims. See FISC Rule 62(a). A helpful standard \nto apply going forward comes from the D.C. Circuit: \nThe test  is  not whether the  court personally agrees  in  full  with  the  [Executive \nBranch's] evaluation of the danger-rather, the issue is whether on the whole record \nthe Agency's judgment objectively survives the test of reasonableness, good faith, \nspecificity, and plausibility in this field of foreign intelligence in which the [agency] \nis expert and given by Congress a special role. \nGardels v.  CIA, 689 F.2d 1100, 1105 (D.C. Cir. 1982). This test is similar to that \nadopted in state secrets, prepublication, and CIPA   cases, where the court considers \nwhether the government has demonstrated a reasonable danger that disclosure would \njeopardize national security and holds in camera, ex parte hearings to satisfy itself \non the matter. See United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102, 140-41 (2d Cir. 2010). \n29 \n\nCONCLUSION \nJudicial opinions belong to the People. Banks, 128 U.S. at 253; Wheaton v. Peers, \n33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 591, 668 (1834). They are publicly available because they must be \nfor our system of government to work. \"The existence of the common law right to \ninspect and copy judicial records is beyond dispute.\"28 635 F.2d at 947-48. It pre-\ndates the Constitution. Leucadia, Inc.  v. Applied Extrusion Technologies, Inc., 998 \nF.2d 157, 161 (3d Cir. 1993). Such documents \"must be relevant to the performance \nof the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,\" and bear \"on the exercise \nof Article III judicial power.\" United States v. Anwdeo (Amodeo I), 44 F.3d 141, 145 \n(2d Cir. 1995); Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1048. No document is more central to judicial \npower than an opinion issued by an Article III court. There are now more than 60 \nFISC opinions in the public domain. They apply the law. They constitute the law, \nand they define the common law. Public access to them lies at the heart of rule of \nlaw. Movants therefore have a common law and a First Amendment right of access \nto them. Where certain information cannot be made public within opinions, the FISC \ncan withhold it based on reasonableness, good fait  specificity, and plausibility. \nProfi  r Laura K.

That distinction has no \nsupport in precedent-indeed, this Court has explicitly rejected it. It is also irreconcilable with \nthe government's concession that the FISC has jurisdiction to address other motions for \npublication: namely, those filed by recipients of FISC orders under FISC Rule 62. Ultimately, \nthe government's position would drive a wedge between the inherent power of this Court to \ncontrol its judicial opinions and those of its coordinate Article III courts. Indeed, it would leave \nthis Court with less inherent authority over its own opinions and records than even executive-\nbranch courts created under Article I. The government has not explained how or why that could \nbe so, nor has it explained why that distinction would (if accepted) stop at court records and not \nextend to the other types of inherent powers that all courts enjoy. \nSecond, even if courts' inherent powers do not confer subject matter jurisdiction over \nmotions seeking access to judicial opinions, the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction plainly does. \nThe government argues that ancillary jurisdiction cannot be a basis for subject matter jurisdiction \nhere because the centuries-old judicial power over records and opinions is not as \"essential\" to \nthis Court as to others, but that is incorrect. The FISC's ability to control access to its opinions is \nnecessary to vindicate its authority as a tribunal-in fact, it exercises that power every time it \ndeclines to publish an opinion. Moreover, the FISC' s resolution of motions for access to its \n\nopinions is intertwined with its underlying proceedings, which give it familiarity with the \ngovernment's national-security claims. Consequently, the FISC may exercise ancillary \njurisdiction for either of the purposes recognized by the Supreme Court. \nThird, the government argues that the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") effectively \ndisplaces the public's First Amendment right of access to FISC opinions, and that any claims for \nthose opinions must be filed in ordinary federal courts. But FOIA does not apply to judicial \nrecords at all, and the standard for withholding executive-branch records under that law cannot \nadequately substitute for the more demanding First Amendment standard that applies to the \nsealing of court opinions. And, in any event, Congress has no power to strip an Article III court's \nauthority over its records. \nFor these reasons and those that follow, the Court should find that it has subject matter \njurisdiction over Movants' motion and proceed to decide the merits. \nArgument \nI.  The FISC's inherent power over its records includes the power to resolve motions \nfor access to those records. \nThis Court has jurisdiction over motions seeking access to its opinions for the \nstraightforward reason that it has inherent power over its opinions. See Movants' Br. 4-8. The \ngovernment acknowledges that the FISC possesses the inherent power to supervise and control \naccess to its own opinions, just as other Article III courts do. See Gov't Br. 1; Nixon v.  Warner \nCommc 'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978). It proposes a wholly novel distinction, however, \nbetween a court's inherent power to control its opinions and its power to address motions for \naccess to those opinions. Gov't Br. 1. Movants are not aware of any precedent supporting the \ngovernment's theory, and the government cites none. To the contrary, this Court has repeatedly \nheld that there is no distinction between its inherent power over its records and its jurisdiction to \n2 \n\naddress motions concerning those records. See In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. \nSupp. 2d 484, 486-87 (FISC 2007); In re Section 215 Orders, No. Misc. 13-02, 2013 WL \n5460064, at *5 (FISC Sept. 13, 2013); In re Motion for Consent to Disclosure ofC  ourt Records, \nNo. Misc. 13-0 I (FISC June 12, 2013), https://perma.cc/F27S-J7KN. Other courts have likewise \ndescribed their jurisdiction over access-related motions as flowing from their inherent power. See \nPub. Citizen v. Liggett Grp., Inc., 858 F.2d 775, 782 (I st Cir. 1988) (\"[C]ourts and commentators \nseem unanimous in finding such an inherent power to modify discovery-related protective \norders, even after judgment, when circumstances justify.\"); Hagestad v. Tragesser, 49 F .3d \n1430, 1434 (9th Cir. I 995) (citing Nixon, 435 U.S. at 598); Macias v. Aaron Rents, Inc., 288 F. \nApp'x 913, 915 (5th Cir. 2008). See generally Grant v.  United States, 282 F.2d 165, 168-69 (2d \nCir. 1960) (Friendly, J.) (finding jurisdiction over petitions for restitution based \"upon the \ninherent disciplinary power\" of the court) (quoting United States v. Maresca, 266 F. 713, 717 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1920)); United States v. Breit, 754 F.2d 526, 530 (4th Cir. 1985) (\"[A] district court \nhas the inherent power, and thus jurisdiction, to reconsider interlocutory orders prior to entry of \njudgment on such orders.\"). \nAs these cases show, the government's distinction between power and jurisdiction is a \nfalse one. Whether courts exercise their inherent powers sua sponte or in response to a party's \nmotion for access, they are exercising jurisdiction to decide the question of whether their records \nand proceedings should be open to the public or not-including the applicability of any First \nAmendment or common law right of access. See Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F .3d 133, \n140-41 (2d Cir. 2004) (upholding district court's decision, sua sponte, to unseal judicial records \nafter finding that they were subject to a presumption of public access). Indeed, the Supreme \nCourt has been clear that courts' exercise of their supervisory powers must comport with these \n3 \n\npublic access rights. See Nixon, 435 U.S. at 598-99; Stern v. Trs. of Columbia Univ., 131 F.3d \n305, 307 (2d Cir. 1997) (ordering district court, sua sponte, to review records filed wholesale \nunder seal in order to determine whether their confidential treatment was warranted, without \nconsidering whether there was a person that had a specific interest in gaining access to them or \nmaintaining them in the public files of the court); Citizens First Nat'/ Bank v. Cincinnati Ins. \nCo., 178 F.3d 943, 945 (7th Cir. 1999) (\"The judge is the primary representative of the public \ninterest in the judicial process and is duty-bound therefore to review any request to seal the \nrecord (or part of it).\"). In other words, the courts' inherent power to control their records carries \nwith it the jurisdiction-and the obligation-to determine questions of public access. No further \ngrant of jurisdiction is necessary. \nIndeed, the government does not dispute that the FISC has subject matter jurisdiction to \naddress motions for publication by parties who receive surveillance orders. Gov't Br. 13-14 \n(citing FISC Rule 62). This concession is fatal to the government's argument. Nothing in FISA \ngrants recipients of FISC orders the right to seek publication of the Court's opinions while \nwithholding that right from third parties. Motions for publication under FISC Rule 62 do not fall \nwithin either of the \"two categories of cases\" the government says are expressly authorized by \nFISA, because they do not ask the Court to approve a government surveillance application or to \n' \nf \nadjudicate a recipient's challenge to FISA process it has received. Gov't Br. 1, 7 (citing 50  I \nU.S.C. §§ 1861(f), 188la). Instead, a recipient's motion under Rule 62 seeks the same relief that \nl \nMovants seek here: it asks the Court to make its opinions available to the public. Through Rule  ! \nf \nI \n62 itself and in the Court's decisions, the FISC has recognized its subject matter jurisdiction to \nI \naddress these motions for public access. See, e.g., Order, Jn re Directives Pursuant to Section \nI \n105B of FISA, No. 105B(g) 07-01 (FISC July 15, 2013), https://perma.cc/5MXQ-SHDS (Yahoo!  I \n! \nI \n4 \nI \nI \n• \n\nmotion for publication of FISC opinion and records five years after proceedings had concluded). \nWhether filed by a telecommunications provider or another party, a motion for publication asks \nthe FISC to exercise its inherent powers to provide public access to its judicial opinions. In terms \nof subject matter jurisdiction, there is no basis for distinguishing between these motions. As the \nCourt has recognized, Article III standing remains a limitation on which parties may petition the \nFISC for access to its opinions, but that is a threshold Movants have already satisfied. See In re \nCertification of Questions ofL aw, No. 18-01, 2018 WL 2709456 (FISCR Mar. 16, 2018). \nAccepting the government's argument would render this Court's inherent powers \ninconsistent with those of other Article J1I courts. The inherent power of courts to control access \nto their opinions falls squarely within their power to issue judicial opinions and, more broadly, to \nmanage the judicial proceedings they oversee. See Br. of Amicus Curiae Laura Donohue I 8-24. \nExercising the power to control access to their records, courts routinely entertain third-party \naccess motions without requiring a further basis for their jurisdiction. See, e.g., Nixon, 435 U.S. \n589; Doe v. Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 264 (4th Cir. 2014); In re Search Warrant for \nSecretarial Area Outside Office ofG  unn, 855 F.2d 569, 572-73 (8th Cir. 1988); Lugosch v. \nPyramid Co. ofO  nondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 2006); In re NY. Times Co., 577 F.3d 401 \n(2d Cir. 2009). \nThe government's attempt to brush aside Movants' authorities by reference to section \n1331 federal-questionjurisdiction is meritless. 28 U.S.C. § 1331. First, federal-question \njurisdiction is not how most courts have explained their authority to address access to judicial \nrecords-rather, to the extent they question their jurisdiction at all, they invoke their inherent \npower. See, e.g., E.E.O.C. v. Nat'l Children's Ctr., Inc., 146 F.3d 1042, 1047 (D.C. Cir. 1998) \n(explaining that \"when the third party seeks to intervene for the limited purpose of obtaining \n5 \n\naccess to documents,\" it \"do[e s] not ask the district court to exercise jurisdiction over an \nadditional claim on the merits, but rather to exercise a power that it already has, namely the \npower to modify a previously entered confidentiality order\"); Pub. Citizen, 858 F.2d at 782 \n(describing the \"inherent power to modify discovery-related protective orders, even after \njudgment, when circumstances justify.\"); Pansy v. Stroudsburg, 23 F.3d 772, 778 n.3 (3d Cir. \n1994); Beckman Indus., Inc. v. Int'/ Ins. Co., 966 F .2d 470, 473 (9th Cir. 1992). Thus, the courts \nthat have most closely examined their jurisdiction over motions to unseal court records or to \nmodify protective orders have not relied on the federal-question statute, instead concluding that \nno additional basis for jurisdiction is required beyond their inherent power. 1 Second, even if \nsection 1331 could have provided an alternative (although silent) basis for jurisdiction in some of \nthe cases Movants rely on, that is no response to the numerous authorities-including the \npronouncement of the Supreme Court in Nixon-recognizing that courts have inherent authority \nto grant or restrict access to their own records. Movants' Br. 4-6. \nSignificantly, the government is unable to coherently explain how, under its narrow \ntheory, even specialized Article I courts like the bankruptcy courts regularly exercise jurisdiction \nover right of access motions. See, e.g., In re Alterra Healthcare Corp., 353 B.R. 66, 73-74 \n(Bankr. D. Del. 2006); In re Bennett Funding Grp., Inc., 226 B.R. 331 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y. 1998); \nIn re Symington, 209 B.R. 678 (Bankr. D. Md. 1997). The government points to the bankruptcy \ncourts' rules of procedure, see Gov't Br. 10, but if the government were correct that an express \ngrant of jurisdiction from Congress were required to confer subject matter jurisdiction, those \n1 Similarly, courts in criminal cases routinely address third-party motions for access to their \nrecords or proceedings without pointing to section 1331, even though such motions fall outside \nof the statute that confers criminal jurisdiction. See 18 U.S.C. § 3231; In re N.Y. Times Co., 577 \nF.3d 401 (2d Cir. 2009); United States v. King, 140 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 1998); In re Search Warrant \nfor Secretarial Area Outside Office of Gunn, 855 F.2d at 572-73. \n6 \n\nprocedural rules would not be enough. In truth, the bankruptcy courts have subject matter \njurisdiction over right-of-access motions for the same reason this Court does: because they have \nthe inherent power to control access to their opinions and records. \nThe government also ignores entirely Movants' citation to cases in which Article I \nmilitary courts have applied the First Amendment right-of-access test. See, e.g., United States v. \nHershey, 20 M.J. 433, 436-38 (C.M.A. 1985); United States v. Scott, 48 M.J. 663, 665 (Army \nCt. Crim. App. 1998). That omission is telling. The fact that military courts with specialized \njurisdiction-which, like other Article I courts (and this Article III one), do not enjoy federal-\nquestion jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331-regularly decide questions involving the public's \nright of access makes crystal clear that courts do not require an additional jurisdictional grant to \nconsider such motions. Though military courts were established under Article I, they \"have long \nbeen understood to exercise judicial power, of the same kind wielded by civilian courts.\" Ortiz v. \nUnited States, 138 S. Ct. 2165, 217 5 (2018) (cleaned up); see id. at 2180 (explaining that \nmilitary courts are \"constitutionally rooted\" and \"render[] inherently judicial decisions\"). Of \ncourse, this Court's judicial power comes from Article III, just like the regular federal courts \nwhose powers the Supreme Court looked to in Ortiz. It would make little sense if Article I courts \nI \nenjoyed jurisdiction rooted in their inherent judicial power while this Court did not. \nThe government's attempt to distinguish cases involving protective orders and sealing  I \norders from this case fails. Gov't Br. 11. As the government points out, the FISC's records are \n) \nmaintained in secret pursuant to \"judicial branch\" requirements set out in the FISC Security \nProcedures and FISC Rule 3. Id. at 13. The fact that FISC has adopted a default rule that keeps  t \nI \nall of its opinions secret unless ordered published, as opposed to publishing opinions unless they \nI \nare individually ordered sealed, does not affect the jurisdictional question. In either case, the \n7 \n\ncourts are exercising their inherent powers to control access to their opinions and records. See id. \n(acknowledging that the FISC's rules \"represent a decision to exercise the Court's powers over \nits records\"). \nThe government is also wrong to suggest that jurisdiction over third-party motions for \naccess disappears once a proceeding has concluded. Gov't Br. 11. Courts routinely entertain \nthird-party motions to intervene and unseal records long after matters have been resolved-i.e., \nafter the court has lost jurisdiction, federal question or otherwise, over the merits of the original \ndispute. See, e.g., Doe, 749 F.3d at 252-53; Oregonian Pub. Co. v.  U.S. District Court, 920 F.2d \n1462, 1467-68 (9th Cir. 1990). In the same way, courts retain jurisdiction to lift protective \norders. See Pansy, 23 F .3d at 779 (citing \"the growing consensus among the courts of appeals \nthat intervention to challenge confidentiality orders may take place long after a case has been \nterminated\" and collecting cases); In re Agent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., 821 F.2d 139, 145 (2d \nCir. 1987) (\"It is undisputed that a district court retains the power to modify or lift protective \norders that it has entered.\"); United Nuclear Corp. v. Cranford Ins. Co., 905 F.2d 1424, 1427 \n(10th Cir. 1990). \nUltimately, the government cites no case law in support of its novel claim that the FISC \nhas the inherent power to control access to its records, but lacks jurisdiction to consider motions \nfor access to those records. Indeed, the government's argument would leave the FISC in a unique \nposition among courts: it would strip the FISC of the power to efficiently resolve motions for \naccess to its own opinions-a power that all other Article III courts regularly exercise over their \nopinions. See Movants' Br. 7-8; Br. of Amicus Curiae Laura Donohue 18-24. In particular, the \ngovernment would curtail the FISC's power over its opinions, and its proceedings more broadly, \nthereby channeling motions for access to those opinions to the district courts. See Movants' Br. \n8 \n\n12-14. The government's argument, if accepted, would produce a bizarre result: one where \nparties must file suit asking a different federal court to compel the FISC to release its judicial \nopinions under the First Amendment. See id. That would defy well-recognized principles of \ncomity among coordinate courts, it would defy Congress's intent to give this Court control over \nits own opinions, and it would invite potentially conflicting rulings from dozens of courts on the \npublic's right of access to this Court's opinions. See id. at 13-15. That is surely not the result \nCongress envisioned in enacting FISA or that the Constitution permits in its conception of the \njudicial power. See also Nixon, 435 U.S. at 599 (\"[T]he decision as to access is one best left to \nthe sound discretion of the trial court, a discretion to be exercised in light of the relevant facts \nand circumstances of the particular case.\"). Within the limits of Article Ill's requirement of \nstanding, it is this Court that may and must adjudicate the public's access to its opinions. \nII.  The FISC has ancillary jurisdiction over Movants' right-of-access motion. \nIf the Court believes that some further jurisdictional basis is required, ancillary \njurisdiction plainly provides it. Ancillary jurisdiction, as the government acknowledges, permits \ncourts-including this one-to exercise jurisdiction over a range of collateral proceedings that \nare technically distinct from the initial case. See Gov't Br. 8-9; Movants' Br. 8-9; 13 Charles \nAlan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 3523 (3d ed. 2018) (\"Wright & Miller\"). For \nexample, courts have ancillary jurisdiction over contempt proceedings, see, e.g., Kokkonen v. \nGuardian Life Ins. Co. ofA  m., 511  U.S. 375, 380 (1994) (citing United States v. Hudson, 11  U.S. \n(7 Cranch) 32, 34 (1812)); and proceedings related to the award of attorneys' fees, see Chambers \nv. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991). As Movants have explained, courts, including the FISC, \nalso have ancillary jurisdiction over proceedings regarding access to their records. See Movants' \n9 \n\ni \nI \nBr. 9-11; United States v. Hubbard, 650 F.2d 293, 307 (D.C. Cir. 1980); In re Sealed Case, 237 \nF.3d 657, 664 (D.C. Cir. 2001). \nKokkonen recognizes that courts may exercise ancillary jurisdiction for \"two separate, \nthough sometimes related, purposes\": (1) to enable a court to function successfully, that is, to \nmanage its proceedings, vindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees; or (2) to permit \ndisposition by a single court of claims that are, in varying respects and degrees, factually \ninterdependent. 511 U.S. at 379-80. Both of these purposes are satisfied here. \nAs to the first of these purposes, exercising ancillary jurisdiction over Movants' motion \nvindicates the FlSC's authority over its own records. lndeed, D.C. Circuit precedent is \nillustrative of this principle. In Hubbard and Jn re Sealed Case, the D.C. Circuit recognized that, \nwhere a third party has a \"legally cognizable interest in maintaining the confidentiality of ... \ndocuments\" under a court's control, courts have ancillary jurisdiction over a motion \"initiating a \ndistinct ancillary proceeding without intervening\" which seeks to protect that interest. Jn re \nSealed Case, 237 F.3d at 663--64; see Hubbard, 650 F.2d at 307-14. The government protests \nthat Hubbard and In re Sealed Case have no application here because \"[b ]oth involve parties that \nalleged that their legal rights were about to be violated by unlawful disclosures of information in \nongoing government enforcement actions.\" Gov't Br. 10. But Movants, like the intervenors in \nHubbard and In re Sealed Case, allege a legally cognizable right to records in the FISC's control \nand assert that those rights are being violated by the manner in which the records are maintained. \nThere is no reason why a court would have ancillary jurisdiction over proceedings where the \nalleged harm is a court's publication ofrecords, but not over proceedings where the alleged harm \n10 \n\nis a court's non-publication of records. The question is the same: should the records be public or \n2 \nnot?\nThe government also contends that this Court Jacks ancillary jurisdiction because \nadjudication of Movants' motion is not \"essential to the proper functioning of the FISC or the \neffectuation of its orders.\" Gov't Br. 9. But that claim is at odds with the basic functions of an \nArticle III court, and with the FISC's duty to exercise its powers in keeping with the \nConstitution. As the Amicus Curiae explained at length, a court's \"[i]ssuance of opinions is a \ncore judicial power.\" Br. of Amicus Curiae Laura Donohue 4. And, \"[i]f the issuance ofj udicial \nopinions is a core judicial power, then control over those opinions must be an essential inherent \npower.\" Id. at 20. It is axiomatic that courts cannot exercise their inherent powers in ways that \nviolate the Constitution. See, e.g., Chambers, 50 l U.S. at 50 (\"A court must, of course, exercise \ncaution in invoking its inherent power, and it must comply with the mandates of due process, \nboth in determining that the requisite bad faith exists and in assessing fees.\"). That holds true for \na court's exercise of its supervisory power over its records. Cf Citizens First Nat 'l Bank, 178 \nF.3d at 945. It is therefore \"essential to the proper functioning of FISC\" that it have jurisdiction \nto confront a claim that it has exercised its inherent power over its records in a manner that \nviolates the Constitution. \nThis conclusion is buttressed by the government's concession that the FISC does have \nancillary jurisdiction to entertain declaratory judgment motions by communications providers \n2 To the extent the government pegs its distinction on the ongoing nature of the proceedings in \nHubbard and In re Sealed Case, that distinction is irrelevant. \"It is well established that a federal \ncourt may consider collateral issues after an action is no longer pending.\" Cooter & Gell v. \nHartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 396 (1990); see also KC. ex rel. Erica C. v. Torlakson, 762 F.3d \n963, 969 (9th Cir. 2014) (\"[T]he district court has broad, inherent authority over collateral \nmatters such as attorney's fees, and such ancillary jurisdiction extends beyond dismissal of the \nunderlying lawsuit.\"); In re Austrian & German Bank Holocaust Litig., 317 F.3d 91, 98 (2d Cir. \n2003) (similar). \n11 \n\nasserting a First Amendment right to publish aggregate statistics concerning surveillance \ndemands. Gov't Br. 9 n.8 (discussing providers' efforts to publish transparency reports); see, \ne.g., Amended Mot., In re Amended Mot.for Deel. J  of Google Inc. 's First Amendment Right to \nPublish, No. Misc. 13-03 (FISC Sept. 9, 2013), https://perma.cc/W6Z5-UVGQ. Those motions, \nlike Movants' own, do not challenge any surveillance order on the merits, nor do they even \nestablish that the providers had received any FISC orders at all. See id. at 1 n. l. Instead, the \nmotions seek a declaratory judgment on a collateral issue: whether certain non-disclosure \nrequirements imposed by PISA violate providers' First Amendment rights. See id. If these \nmotions, which seek the right to publish aggregate statistics concerning surveillance demands, \nsatisfy the requirements of ancillary jurisdiction, so too does a motion like Movants', which \nseeks public access to FISC opinions issued in the course of similar proceedings. A motion for \naccess to the FIS C's judicial opinions-its core work product-relates at least as closely to the \nCourt's ability to \"manage its proceedings\" as does a motion challenging a blanket non \ndisclosure rule imposed by FISA itself. Cf Twitterv. Holder, 183 F. Supp. 3d 1007, 1013 (N.D. \nCal. 2016) (\"Nothing in the Amended Complaint would require the [district court] to interpret, \nreview, or grant relief from any particular FISC order or directive.\"). Accordingly, ancillary \njurisdiction is available here. \nWith respect to the other \"purpose\" recognized in Kokkonen, Movants' right-of-access \nmotion is sufficiently \"interdependent\" with the underlying proceedings to support ancillary \njurisdiction. 511 U.S. at 379-80. In deciding not to publish its opinions, this Court has \npresumptively concluded that the government's national-security interests justify non-\n12 \n\n3 \ndisclosure.  Movants' right-of-access motion is interdependent with that determination because it \nasks the Court to examine whether the government has a compelling interest that overcomes the \nright of public access to these opinions. Cf. Nixon, 435 U.S. at 599 (recognizing trial court's \nfamiliarity with facts bearing on public access); Globe Newspaper Co. v. Super. Ct.for Norfolk \nCty., 457 U.S. 596, 609 n.25 (1982) (same). The federal courts have often considered a similar \nquestion of interdependence when parties move to intervene seeking access to judicial records-\nand those courts have overwhelmingly found that sufficient \"commonality'' exists. See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 24(b) (parties permitted to intervene when they have \"a claim or defense that shares with \nthe main action a common question of law or fact.\"). These courts have taken a broad view of \ncommonality when a party challenges a sealing or non-disclosure order, finding that such a \nmotion is intertwined with the underlying proceeding. See, e.g., Pansy, 23 F.3d at 778 (collecting \ncases); E.E.O.C., 146 F.3d at 1047 (\"[Courts have held that] the issue of the scope or need for the \nconfidentiality order itself presents a common question that links the movant's challenge with \nthe main action.\"); Beckman, 966 F.2d at 474; Meyer Goldberg, Inc. v. Fisher Foods, Inc., 823 \nF.2d 159, 164 (6th Cir. 1987). The same interrelationship exists here, and supports the Court's \njurisdiction. \nFinally, under either path laid out in Kokkonen, this Court has ancillary jurisdiction over \nMovants' First Amendment right-of-access motion notwithstanding the fact that it does not have \ngeneral federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. A federal court's ancillary \njurisdiction flows from its jurisdiction over the original proceeding. \"[I]f a federal court ha[ s] \n3 Again, the government does not dispute that this Court has already exercised its inherent \npower over the opinions at issue. See Gov't Br. 13 (\"The [FISC's security] requirements, \nimposed by the judicial branch (the Chief Justice and this Court), represent a decision to exercise \nthe Court's powers over its records in an appropriate manner consistent with the national security \nconcerns that led Congress to create this specialized Court.\"); id. at 14. \n13 \n\njurisdiction of the principal action, it may hear an ancillary proceeding, regardless of the \ncitizenship of the parties, the amount in controversy, or any other factor that normally would \ndetermine subject matter jurisdiction.\" Wright & Miller§ 3523. Thus, even courts that would not \nhave federal-question jurisdiction to consider right-of-access motions-such as the bankruptcy \ncourts and the Court of International Trade-may exercise ancillary jurisdiction over motions for \naccess to their underlying proceedings. See In re Valdez Fisheries Dev. Ass 'n, Inc., 439 F.3d 545, \n549 (9th Cir. 2006) (acknowledging that bankruptcy courts have ancillary jurisdiction); In re \nChateaugay Corp., 201B.R.48, 62 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1996), aff'd in part, 213 B.R. 633 \n(S.D.N. Y. 1997) (\"Bankruptcy courts have inherent or ancillary jurisdiction to interpret and \nenforce their own orders wholly independent of the statutory grant of jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1334.\"); Cormorant Shipholding Corp. v.  United States, 33 C.l.T. 440, 446 (2009) \n(acknowledging that the Court of International Trade has ancillary jurisdiction). Here, the FISC \nhas ancillary jurisdiction over Movants' motion for access to its opinions because it has \njurisdiction to grant or deny surveillance applications under 50 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq. \nFor these reasons and those in Movants' opening brief, the FISC has ancillary jurisdiction \nto entertain Movants' motion. \n*  *  * \nAs Movants have explained in the preceding two sections, this Court's inherent power \nand ancillary jurisdiction supply two independent bases for the consideration of this motion for \naccess. Some courts have suggested, however, that ancillary jurisdiction is the vehicle through \nwhich Article III courts exercise their inherent powers. In United States v.  Wahi, 850 F.3d 296 \n(7th Cir. 2017), for example, the Seventh Circuit suggested that ancillary jurisdiction is the \n\"formal name\" for a court's inherent power. Id. at 298; see also United States v. Meyer, 439 F.3d \n14 \n\n855, 860 (8th Cir. 2006) (explaining that in Kokkonen, \"[t]he Supreme Court viewed the inherent \npower of the federal courts as a subset of the second category of ancillary jurisdiction\"); Jn re \nAustrian & German Bank Holocaust Litig., 317 F.3d at 99 (noting availability of ancillary \njurisdiction \"to consider exercising 'inherent power' of federal courts\"). Whatever the answer to \nthis doctrinal question, the result here is the same. The Court has jurisdiction to consider \nMovants' motion either on the basis of its inherent power, on the basis of ancillary jurisdiction, \nor because it has ancillary jurisdiction to exercise its inherent power over its judicial opinions. \nIII.  FOIA does not displace this Court's authority to address motions for public access \nto its judicial opinions. \nIn asserting that Movants' access motion should be pursued in a federal district court \nunder the Freedom of Information Act, it is clear that the government fundamentally \nmisunderstands FOIA and the nature of the FISC's power over its records. \nFirst, FOIA is no substitute for the public's First Amendment right of access to this \nCourt's opinions. FOIA did nothing to constrain the public's ability to seek access to judicial \nopinions, including FISC opinions, from the courts themselves. In fact, Congress carefully \nlimited FOIA's disclosure mandates to \"agency\" records, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(l}-{3), and made \nclear that an \"agency\" subject to FOIA \"does not include ... the courts of the United States,\" id \n§ 551(1) (emphasis added). FOIA \"was not intended to restrict the federal courts-either by \nmandating disclosure or by requiring non-disclosure\" of judicial records. Brown & Williamson \nTobacco Corp. v. FT.C., 710 F.2d 1165, 1177 (6th Cir. 1983); Metlife, Inc. v. Fin. Stability \nOversight Council, 865 F.3d 661, 672 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Moreover, if Congress had intended \nFOIA to serve as the sole vehicle for access to this Court's opinions, it would have required the \ngovernment to, at a minimum, maintain copies of this Court's orders. But it is black-letter law \nthat FOIA imposes no obligation on agencies to create or maintain specific records. See, e.g., \n15  I \n\nKissinger v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom oft he Press, 445 U.S. 136, 152 (1980). Nor does \nFISA itself impose such an obligation; it only requires the government to maintain copies of \ncertain orders and certifications it makes to the FISC. See 50 U.S.C. § 188la(h)(5), (/)(3). \nSecond, and relatedly, FOIA's standard for disclosure does not displace the First \nAmendment standard that applies when a party seeks access to judicial opinions. See, e.g., In re \nNY. Times Co., 828 F.2d 110, 115-16 (2d Cir. 1987) (\"Obviously, a statute cannot override a \nconstitutional right.\"). The government argues that \"the standard ofreview for judicial \nconsideration of Executive Branch classification decisions results not from the text of FOIA, but \nfrom the Executive Branch's responsibility and competence for safeguarding national security \ninformation.\" Gov't Br. 15-16. That is incorrect; while the executive branch's general \nresponsibility over classified information may have motivated various exemptions in FOIA that \nallow for the withholding of classified information, the text itself controls. Moreover, the \nConstitution demands more rigorous scrutiny of classification decisions than FOIA. Cf NY. \nTimes v.  United States (Pentagon Papers), 403 U.S. 713 (1971). For example, FOIA's \nrequirement that the executive branch produce all \"reasonably segregable\" non-exempt material \nis less demanding than the First Amendment's requirement that closure be \"narrowly tailored\" to \nserve an \"overriding\" government interest. Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court (Press-Enterprise \nI), 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984). More fundamentally, when FOIA requesters seek access to FISC \norders and opinions as \"agency records\" under FOIA, this Court lacks any opportunity to itself \nconsider whether the opinions should be published or to direct the executive branch to undertake \na declassification review. \nThird, Congress has no power to eliminate this Court's authority to control access to its \nopinions. To hold that FOIA displaced the FISC's Article III authority over its own opinions \n16 \n\nwould raise serious separation-of-powers concerns: it would prevent the FISC from exercising \nauthority over access to its own precedential opinions-the quintessential judicial documents-\nand reassign that authority to the executive branch. That result would run afoul of the \nfoundational principle that the '\"judicial Power of the United States' must be reposed in an \nindependent Judiciary.\" N. Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 59-60 \n(1982) (quoting U.S. Const. art. III,§ 1). One would not expect Congress to test the boundaries \nof the Constitution's division of power \"without saying so.\" Metlife, Inc., 865 F.3d at 675. It did \nnot do so, in FISA or in FOIA. \nFinally, neither decision of this Court cited by the government supports its argument that \nthis Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain Movants' right-of-access motion because of FOIA. In In \nre Motion for Release of Court Records, this Court specifically held that it does have jurisdiction \nover right-of-access motions. 526 F. Supp. 2d at 486-87. And in In re Section 215 Orders, this \nCourt did not dismiss a right-of-access claim for lack of jurisdiction; instead, it simply dismissed \nthe claim as a matter of comity where there was ongoing FOIA litigation for the same opinions at \nissue in a district court, and it did so \"without prejudice to reinstatement of a motion for \npublication with the FISC after resolution of the FOIA litigation.\" No. Misc. 13-02, 2013 WL \n5460064, at *7 (FISC Sept. 13, 2013). \nIV.  Whether the FISC's publication of its opinions would conflict with Congress's and \nthe executive branch's interests in secrecy goes to the merits, not to jurisdiction. \nThe government argues that the Court's \"inherent supervisory power over its records\" is \nlimited by executive-branch and congressional interests in regulating \"access to national security \ninformation.\" Gov't Br. 12; see id. at 14 & n.12. But as this Court has explained, \"[h]ow the \nFISC exercises its supervisory power over its records, and the extent to which release of its \nrecords is either prohibited by statute (or by statutorily required security procedures) or \n17 \n\ncompelled by the Constitution or the common law, go directly to the merits of the ACLU's \nclaims, and not to the Court's jurisdiction over the ACLU's motion.\" In re Motion for Release of \nCourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 486--87. If anything, the executive branch's and Congress's \ninterests in secrecy might be relevant to the \"experience\" or \"logic\" prongs of the First \nAmendment right-of-access test, or to whether the government has demonstrated a substantial \nprobability of harm to a compelling interest sufficient to justify the continued sealing of court \nrecords sought by Movants. See Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court (Press-Enterprise II), 478 \nU.S. I, 9-1 I (1986). In other words, that analysis does not bear on the Court's jurisdiction. It \nbears on the merits--and Movants have already explained why executive and congressional \nregulation of national-security information does not shield this Court's records from the First \nAmendment right of access. See Motion for the Release of Court Records I 2-21 (Nov. 7, 2013); \nMovants' Reply Br. 8-IO (Dec. 20, 2013) (citing cases applying First Amendment right of \naccess to judicial records involving classified information). \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Movants respectfully request that the Court release the judicial \nopinions at issue with only those limited redactions that meet the strict test for overcoming the \nconstitutional right of public access. \nDated: August l, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \nIsl Patrick Toomey \nDavid A.

Rep. No. 95-701 (1978), as reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3973 ......................................... 15 \nvi \n\nIntroduction \nThis Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Movants' motion for access to the FISC's \njudicial opinions on two independent grounds. \nFirst, as the FISC previously held, the Court has inherent authority and jurisdiction to \nadjudicate such a motion pursuant to its inherent, supervisory power over its own records. See In \nre Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 486-87 (FISC 2007). The FISC, \nlike other Article III (and even most Article I) courts, possesses inherent powers essential to its \nfunctions as a court, including the power to regulate public access to the judicial opinions it \nissues. In FISA, Congress recognized the FISC's inherent powers, and the Court's own rules \nspecifically reflect its authority to decide when the FISC' s opinions should be released to the \npublic. \nSecond, even if this Court accepts the proposition that it lacks the fundamental, inherent \npowers of other courts, the FISC may exercise ancillary jurisdiction over Movants' motion. \nMovants' motion for access to the Court's opinions is ancillary to the Court's proceedings ruling \non government surveillance applications-proceedings over which the Court has undisputed \njurisdiction. Thus, just as courts have recognized the existence of ancillary jurisdiction over \nmotions seeking to bar public access to judicial records, so too may Article III courts exercise \nancillary jurisdiction over claims seeking to vindicate a public right of access. \nMoreover, for the Court to decide that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Movants' \nmotion would be contrary to existing FISC precedent and would have the perverse effect of \nforcing other courts to decide whether and when the public has a right of access to this Court's \njudicial opinions. Even if the FISC lacked jurisdiction to resolve Movants' motion, the federal \ndistrict courts would have jurisdiction to hear such First Amendment claims. But such a result \n\nwould be at clear odds with FISA's purpose of developing and relying on this Court's expertise \nin the consideration of matters relating to foreign intelligence surveillance. As a specialized \nArticle III court created to oversee foreign intelligence surveillance, the FISC has both the power \nand the expertise to resolve motions for public access to its foundational opinions. \nProcedural and Factual Background \nOn November 6, 2013, Movants filed the motion at issue here, seeking the release-\npursuant to the First Amendment right of access and FISC Rule 62--of any FISC opinions \naddressing \"the bulk collection of Americans' information.\" Mot. for Release of Court Records \nat 2. Movants filed the motion to inform the public about how the FISC construes the scope of \ngovernment surveillance authority when intelligence agencies seek to collect Americans' \ninformation in bulk. \nIn response, the government identified four opinions of this Court. Two of the opinions \nhad previously been released in redacted form by the FISC.1 The two others were released by the \ngovernment, also with redactions, while Movants' motion was pending.2 The redactions in the \nopinions are substantial, making it difficult for a reader and the public to understand the FISC's \nlegal analysis. In two of the opinions, dozens of pages are almost entirely redacted. See Kollar-\nKotelly Opinion at 8-9, 31-38, 73-79; Bates Opinion at 36-52, 57-70. In addition, certain key \nfacts, definitions, and concepts have been redacted, such as the types of \"metadata\" that the FISC \n1 Amended Memorandum Opinion, In re Application of the FBI/or an Order Requiring the \nProduction of Tangible Things.from [Redacted], No. BR 13-109 (FISC Aug. 29, 2013), \nhttps://perma.cc/LF5Z-VCFR (\"Eagan Opinion\") (released Sept. 17, 2013); Memorandum, In re \nApplication oft he FBIf or an Order Requiring the Production of Tangible Things.from \n[Redacted], No. BR 13-158 (FISC Oct. 11, 2013), https://perma.cc/NWZ2-MXZU (\"McLaughlin \nOpinion\") (released Oct. 18, 2013). \n2 Opinion and Order, [Redacted], No. PRITT [Redacted] (FISC released Nov. 18, 2013), \nhttp://1.usa.gov/19Ct5rl (\"Kollar-Kotelly Opinion\"); Memorandum Opinion, [Redacted], No. \nPRITT [Redacted] (FISC released Nov. 18, 2013), http://l.usa.gov/19Ct7Q5 (\"Bates Opinion\"). \n2 \n\nreasoned were not protected by the Fourth Amendment and could therefore be collected in bulk \nby the government. 3 \nThere is no indication in the public record that the FISC had any role in determining \nwhich portions of its own opinions should be made public. The government appears to have \ndetermined unilaterally which parts of the FISC's orders should be redacted and kept secret. By \ncontrast, in response to a separate access motion brought by the ACLU, the FISC required the \ngovernment to explain and justify its proposed withholdings in another FISC opinion. 4 That \nreview proved essential to securing public access to the court's opinion. 5 Once required to \ndefend its withholdings, the government abandoned many of them. Nothing similar occurred \nhere. \nOn March 16, 2018, following proceedings in this Court, the FIS CR determined that \nMovants have standing to seek public release of the FISC's opinions. Jn re Certification of \nQuestions ofL aw, No. 18-01, 2018 WL 2709456 (FISCR Mar. 16, 2018). The Court has now \ndirected the parties to address a separate issue: whether the FISC has subject matter jurisdiction \nover Movants' motion for access. May 1, 2018 Briefing Order. The Court also invited Movants \nto address the merits of their claim \"to the extent additional briefing relates to legal authority that \nhas not been addressed in their prior submissions to the Court.\" Id. \n3 See Kollar-Kotelly Opinion at 7-11, 19 (\"[Redacted] like other forms ofmetadata, is not \nprotected by the Fourth Amendment ....\" );Bates Opinion at 2, 35, 71 (\"The government \nrequests authority to [redacted] categories of [sixteen pages of redacted material].\"). \n4 See Order, In re Orders oft his Court Interpreting Section 215 oft he PATRIOT Act (\"In re \nSection 215 Orders\"), No. Misc. 13-02 (FISC Nov. 20, 2013), https://perma.cc/29WY-TUGV. \n5 Opinion and Order, In re Section 215 Orders, No. Misc. 13-02 (FISC Aug. 7, 2014), \nhttps://perma.cc/KE97-PZWC. \n3 \n\nArgument \nI.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this motion for access because the \nFISC, like all Article Ill courts, has inherent authority over its records. \nAll Article III courts enjoy \"certain implied powers [that] necessarily result to our Courts \nof justice from the nature of their institution.\" Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43 (1991) \n(alteration removed) (quoting United States v. Hudson, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32, 34 (1812)). These \ninherent powers are \"governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in \ncourts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of \ncases.\" Linkv. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-31 (1962). Inherentjudicial authority \nincludes the powers to punish contempt, to regulate admission to the bar, to discipline attorney \nmisconduct, to dismiss lawsuits for failure to prosecute, and to enforce decorum in the \ncourtroom. See Chambers, 501 U.S. at 43-44. It also encompasses the \"supervisory power over \n[a court's] own records and files\"-a power that includes jurisdiction to entertain claims for \naccess to court records. Nixon v.  Warner Commc 'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978); see \nGambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 140 (2d Cir. 2004) (a court's supervisory power \nover its own records is \"fundamental\"). As the FISC has previously held, \"it would be quite odd \nif the FISC did not have jurisdiction in the first instance to adjudicate a claim of right to the \ncourt's very own records and files.\" In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d \nat 486-87, 497. \nAs a specialized Article III court, the FISC \"retains all the inherent powers that any court \nhas.\" Matter ofK  evork, 634 F. Supp. 1002, 1014 (C.D. Cal. 1985), aff'd, 788 F.2d 566 (9th Cir. \n1986). That is unsurprising, as other specialized Article III courts (and even most Article I \ncourts) possess these inherent powers, too. See, e.g., Retamal v.  US. Customs & Border Prot., \n439 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (discussing inherent powers of the Court oflnternational \n4 \n\nTrade, a specialized Article III court); Precision Specialty Metals, Inc. v.  United States, 315 F .3d \n1346, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (same); Estee Candy Co. v.  United States, 343 F. Supp. 1362, 1363 \n(Cust. Ct. 1972) (U.S. Customs Court, the former incarnation of the Court of International Trade, \ndiscussing its inherent power to \"regulate and protect\" officers of the court); United States v. \nHershey, 20 M.J. 433, 436-38 (C.M.A. 1985) (applying First Amendment right-of-access test to \nmilitary court-martial); United States v. Scott, 48 M.J. 663, 665 (Army Ct. Crim. App. 1998) \n(same); In re Alterra Healthcare Corp., 353 B.R. 66, 73-74 (Bankr. D. Del. 2006) (same as to \nbankruptcy proceeding); Stam v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 317, 319-20 (Vet. App. 1991) (same as \nto appeal in Court of Veterans Appeals). Indeed, Congress acknowledged the Court's inherent \npowers in FISA, and provided that the FISC \"may establish such rules and procedures, and take \nsuch actions, as are reasonably necessary to administer [its] responsibilities under this chapter,\" \n50 U.S.C. §§ 1803(g)(l), (h). See also Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. § 207l(a) (\"The Supreme \nCourt and all courts established by Act of Congress may from time to time prescribe rules for the \nconduct of their business.\"). FISC Rule 62 preserves the Court's power to exercise control over \nits records, and the FISC has on multiple occasions recognized its inherent power and \njurisdiction to entertain a motion for access to those records. See In re Motion for Release of \nCourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 486-87, 497; In re Section 215 Orders, No. Misc. 13-02, 2013 \nWL 5460064, at *5 (FISC Sept. 13, 2013). \nIn its recent briefing to the FISCR in this case, the government did not seriously dispute \neither the FISC' s inherent power to control its records or its jurisdiction to adjudicate third-party \nclaims of access. Instead, it contended that the FISC' s inherent power extends only to cases \n\"before it,\" not to \"new cases.\" Gov't Opening Br. at 23-24, In re Certification of Questions of \nLaw, No. 18-01 (FISCR Feb. 23, 2018), https://perma.cc/5DRU-63K7. But the power to \n5 \n\nadjudicate motions for access to court records derives from a court's authority and control over \nthose records and thus persists even after the underlying dispute has ended. Whether a case is \npending or terminated, \"(s  ]o long as [court files] remain under the aegis of the court, they are \nsuperintended by the judges who have dominion over the court.\" Gambale, 3 77 F .3d at 141; see, \ne.g., Carlson v.  United States, 837 F.3d 753, 756-57 (7th Cir. 2016) (adjudicating request to \nunseal 70-year-old grand jury records). Indeed, the ongoing nature of a court's \"retained power\" \nover its records \"provides a safety valve for public interest concerns, changed circumstances[,] or \nany other basis that may reasonably be offered for later adjustment,\" Poliquin v. Garden Way, \nInc., 989 F.2d 527, 535 (1st Cir. 1993)--concerns pointedly raised by Movants' motion. \nMoreover, if this Court lacks the inherent powers enjoyed by other Article III (and \nArticle I) courts, this Court could not properly have published its rulings on earlier occasions, \nincluding as far back as 1981. See In the Matter of the Application oft he United States for an \nOrder Authorizing the Physical Search ofN  onresidential Premises and Personal Property, No. \n[Redacted] (FISC 1981), https://perma.ccN3XT-SY5V; see also In re All Matters Submitted to \nthe FISC, 218 F. Supp. 2d 611 (FISC 2002), abrogated by In re Sealed Case, 310 F .3d 717 \n(FISCR 2002); In re Directives Pursuant to Section 105B ofF  ISA (\"In re Directives\"), 551 F .3d \n1004, 1016 (FISCR 2008) (\"It would serve the public interest and the orderly administration of \njustice to publish this opinion.\"). And it is not clear on what basis this Court would be able to \nenforce its rulings with contempt, though both this Court and the FISCR have unmistakably \nrelied upon their power to do so. See, e.g., In re Production of Tangible Things.from [Redacted], \nNo. BR 08-13, 2009 WL 9157881, at *1 (FISC Jan. 28, 2009) (in response to government \nmisrepresentations as part of FISC proceeding, ordering briefing on \"whether the Court should \ntake action regarding persons responsible for any misrepresentations to the Court or violation of \n6 \n\nits Orders ... through its contempt powers\"); In re Directives, 551 F .3d at 1017 (\"Any violation \nof this Order shall immediately be brought to the Court's attention. The unauthorized use or \ndisclosure of classified information pertaining to this case may violate federal criminal law and \ncould result in civil or criminal penalties for contempt of court.\"); see also Gov't Opp. 3, In re \nMotion/or Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484 (FISC Aug. 31, 2007), \nhttps://perma.cc/2984-LKRQ (conceding that the FISC has the inherent power of contempt). \nAlthough courts' inherent powers are limited to those \"necessary to permit the courts to \nfunction,\" Young v.  United States ex rel.  Vuitton et Fils S.A., 481 U.S. 787, 819-820 (1987) \n(Scalia, J ., concurring in judgment), the publication of opinions-at times in response to claims \nof public access-is a necessary and essential power. As the Third Circuit has explained: \nAs ours is a common-law system based on the \"directive force\" of precedents, its \neffective and efficient functioning demands wide dissemination of judicial \ndecisions .... Even that part of the law which consists of codified statutes is \nincomplete without the accompanying body of judicial decisions construing the \nstatutes. Accordingly, under our system of jurisprudence the judiciary has the \nduty of publishing and disseminating its decisions. \nLowenschuss v.  W. Publ'g Co., 542 F.2d 180, 185 (3d Cir. 1976) (quoting Benjamin N. Cardozo, \nThe Nature oft he Judicial Process 20, 21-22 (1963)); see Scheiner v.  Wallace, No. 93-cv-0062, \n* \n1996 WL 633226, at  1 (S.D.N. Y. Oct. 31, 1996) (\"The public interest in an accountable \njudiciary generally demands that the reasons for a judgment be exposed to public scrutiny.\" \n(citing United States v. Amodeo, 71F.3d1044, 1048-49 (2d Cir. 1995))). Dissemination of \njudicial opinions is necessary both for the public to understand what the law is and to preserve \nthe legitimacy of the judicial process. See US. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner Mall P 'ship, 513 \nU.S. 18, 26 (1994) (\"[J]udicial precedents are ... valuable to the legal community as a whole. \nThey are not merely the property of private litigants.\"); accord Lowenschuss, 542 F.2d at 185; \nsee also Union Oil Co. v. Leavell, 220 F.3d 562, 568 (7th Cir. 2000) (Easterbrook, J.) (\"What \n7 \n\nhappens in the halls of government is presumptively public business. Judges deliberate in private \nbut issue public decisions after public arguments based on public records. The political branches \nof government claim legitimacy by election, judges by reason. Any step that withdraws an \nelement of the judicial process from public view makes the ensuing decision look more like fiat, \nwhich requires compelling justification.\"). Because publication of judicial opinions is a \nfundamental-and therefore necessary and inherent-power of all Article III courts, this Court \nhas jurisdiction to consider motions seeking just that. \nII.  The FISC, like all Article III courts, has ancillary jurisdiction over motions for \naccess to its records. \nIn addition to its inherent judicial power, this Court has an independent basis for \nexercising power over Movants' motion: ancillary jurisdiction. As Wright and Miller explain, \ncourts may exercise ancillary jurisdiction over \"a claim or an incidental proceeding (not a case \nI \nI \nitself) that does not satisfy requirements of an independent basis of subject matter jurisdiction.\"  l \nI \nI \n13 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 3523 (3d ed. 2018) (\"Wright and \ni \nl \nMiller\") (emphasis in original). In proceedings like these, in which claims are both \"ancillary and \ni \n! \ndependent, the jurisdiction of the court follows that of the original cause.\" Local Loan Co. v. \nI \nHunt, 292 U.S. 234, 239 (1934). Here, the Court may exercise ancillary jurisdiction because this  I \nI \nmotion concerns access to the Court's own opinions, which it issued in ruling on the surveillance \n~ \nI \napplications brought before it. See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1803-1805.  i \nI \nThe Supreme Court has recognized that federal courts retain ancillary jurisdiction to \ni \nentertain motions or incidental proceedings when necessary to \"protect [their] proceedings and  I \n' \nl \n! \nvindicate [their] authority.\" Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. ofA  m., 511 U.S. 375, 379, 380 \nI \n! \n(1994). \"Under this concept, a district court acquires jurisdiction of a case or controversy in its  I \nI \nr \n{' \nI \n8  ' \n\nentirety, and, as an incident to the full disposition of the matter, may hear collateral proceedings \nwhen necessary to allow it to vindicate its role as a tribunal.\" Wright and Miller§ 3523.2.6 \nCourts routinely exercise ancillary jurisdiction over a broad range of proceedings related to \nfunctions that lie at the core of the judicial power. See, e.g., Jenkins v.  Weinshienk, 670 F.2d 915, \n918 (10th Cir. 1982) (\"Ancillary jurisdiction rests on the premise that a federal court acquires \njurisdiction of a case or controversy in its entirety. Incident to the disposition of the principal \nissues before it, a court may decide collateral matters necessary to render complete justice.\"); \nGarcia v. Teitler, 443 F .3d 202, 208 (2d Cir. 2006) (same). 7 In Kokkonen itself, for example, the \nSupreme Court recognized that a court may exercise ancillary jurisdiction to exercise its \ncontempt power. 511 U.S. at 379-80 (citing Hudson, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) at 34 (\"To fine for \ncontempt-imprison for contumacy-inforce the observance of order, &c. are powers which \ncannot be dispensed with in a Court, because they are necessary to the exercise of all others.\")). \nSignificantly, courts have also exercised ancillary jurisdiction over motions to maintain \njudicial records under seal. In United States v. Hubbard, for example, the D.C. Circuit held that a \ncourt may exercise ancillary jurisdiction over the motion of a third-party intervenor in a criminal \ncase that the district court should maintain certain documents under seal. 650 F.2d 293, 307 \n6 Congress codified a subset of the courts' authority to exercise ancillary jurisdiction in 28 \nU.S.C. § 1367. However, Congress \"did not codify all of common law ancillary jurisdiction.\" \nRobb Evans & Assocs., LLC v. Holibaugh, 609 F.3d 359, 363 (4th Cir. 2010). Section 1367 \n\"does not affect common law ancillary jurisdiction 'over related proceedings that are technically \nseparate from the initial case that invoked federal subject matter jurisdiction,' which remains \ngoverned by case law.\" Id. (citing Wright & Miller,§ 3523.2); see also Nat'/ City Mortg. Co. v. \nStephen, 64 7 F .3d 78, 85 (3d Cir. 2011) (\"In other words, a court may exercise jurisdiction over \nrelated matters arising out of the case in which it has initial jurisdiction.\"). \n7 See Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 395 (1990) (proceedings related to \ncosts, attorneys' fees, and sanctions); Sprague v. Ticonic Nat'/ Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 170 (1939) \n(same); K.C. ex rel. Erica C. v. Torlakson, 762 F.3d 963, 968 (9th Cir. 2014) (same); In re \nAustrian & German Bank Holocaust Litig., 317 F.3d 91, 99 (2d Cir. 2003) (same); Laker \nAirways Ltd. v. Sabena, Belgian World Airlines, 731 F.2d 909, 938 (D.C. Cir. 1984) \n(proceedings related to \"defensive\" anti-suit injunctions). \n9 \n\n(D.C. Cir. 1980). Furthermore, as a procedural matter, the appeals court found it appropriate for \nthe intervenor to invoke the trial court's jurisdiction by \"proceed[ing] by simple motion.\" Id. at \n310. Rejecting the intervenor's petition for a writ of mandamus, the D.C. Circuit emphasized that \nthe trial court should itself consider the claim, \"especially where, as here, the matter is urgent and \nlargely dependent on an extensive record with which the trial judge is intimately familiar.\" Id. at \n309; see also In re Sealed Case, 237 F.3d 657, 664 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (concluding that appellants \n\"properly initiated\" a separate \"ancillary proceeding\" seeking to maintain documents under seal). \nJust as courts have recognized the existence of ancillary jurisdiction over a motion \nseeking to prevent public access to judicial records, so too may Article III courts exercise \njurisdiction over claims seeking to vindicate a public right of access. Access to a court's records, \nor a court's proceedings, is so intimately connected with a court's ability to conduct its day-to-\nday affairs and to control the cases that come before it, that courts plainly have ancillary \njurisdiction to consider motions for access collateral to those underlying proceedings. No other \ncourt is positioned to rule quickly, or with the same knowledge of the underlying facts. See \ngenerally Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v.  Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1980) (describing trial \ncourt's order to clear the courtroom and subsequent hearing to address the parties' interests in \nclosure); Globe Newspaper Co. v. Super. Ct.for Norfolk Cty., 457 U.S. 596, 609 n.25 (1982) \n(recognizing trial court's ability to ascertain the various parties' interests in public access versus \nclosure). It would be incongruous-not to mention inefficient-to require such motions to be \nbrought before a different court, in a different proceeding. Unsurprisingly, neither the Supreme \nCourt nor the lower courts have suggested such a rule. Flynt v. Lombardi, 782 F .3d 963, 966-67 \n(8th Cir. 2015) (collecting cases holding that intervention, not filing a separate action, is the \nappropriate procedural vehicle for access claims seeking judicial records); cf Beckman Indus., \n10 \n\nInc. v. lnt'l Ins. Co., 966 F.2d 470, 473 (9th Cir. 1992) (no independent jurisdictional basis \nrequired for access claims). Instead, the Supreme Court has explained that when representatives \nof the press and general public assert a First Amendment right of access to judicial proceedings, \nthey \"must be given an opportunity to be heard on the question of their exclusion.\" Globe \nNewspaper Co., 457 U.S. at 609 n.25 (1982) (emphasis added). \nWhere a court's records are at issue, ancillary jurisdiction remains even after the \nunderlying proceeding has concluded. For example, courts have exercised ancillary jurisdiction \nto \"order the expungement ofrecords, including arrest records,\" when the maintenance of those \npublic records compounds an infringement of constitutional rights. Sullivan v. Murphy, 4 78 F .2d \n938, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1973); see United States v. Field, 756 F.3d 911, 916 (6th Cir. 2014) \n(\"[F]ederal courts ... retain ancillary jurisdiction over motions [for expungement] challenging \nan unconstitutional conviction.\"); United States v. Meyer, 439 F.3d 855, 861 (8th Cir. 2006) \n(recognizing federal courts' ancillary jurisdiction to expunge court records of an unlawful arrest \nor conviction). Similarly, courts have entertained claims of a First Amendment right of access to \ntheir records even long after the original litigation has concluded. See, e.g., Carlson, 837 F.3d at \n756-57 (adjudicating request to unseal 70-year-old grand jury records); Doe v. Pub. Citizen, 749 \nF.3d 246, 253 (4th Cir. 2014) (directing district court to unseal records requested in post-\njudgment motion); Oregonian Pub. Co. v.  US. District Court, 920 F.2d 1462, 1468 (9th Cir. \n1990) (directing district court to unseal plea agreement after defendant pleaded guilty and was \nsentenced). District courts have also adjudicated petitions seeking to unseal search warrants and \nrecords of electronic surveillance and to publicly docket those records. See, e.g., Petition to \nUnseal, In re Petition ofJ ennifer Granick & Riana Pfefferkorn, No. 16-mc-80206-KA W (N .D. \nCal. Sep. 28, 2016) (ECF No. 1) ; Matter ofL eopold to Unseal Certain Elec. Surveillance \n11 \n\nApplications & Orders, No. 13-mc-00712, 2018 WL 1129660, at *1 (D.D.C. Feb. 26, 2018) \n(entertaining claim to \"unseal almost twenty years of sealed government applications, and related \norders, to obtain information about, and the contents of, electronic communications in criminal \ninvestigations now closed\"). Courts have exercised jurisdiction over these petitions even where \npetitioners have been unable-because of widespread sealing-to identify the specific cases or \ndocket numbers to which they are seeking public access. \nIn short, this Court's jurisdiction over individual surveillance applications and \nproceedings provides ancillary jurisdiction over motions for public access concerning those same \napplications and proceedings-access that goes to the heart of the Court's role as an adjudicative \ntribunal. \nIII.  Holding that the FISC lacks power to hear right-of-access motions would \nimpermissibly strip the FISC of authority over its records and would contravene \nCongress's intent in enacting FISA. \nEither as a matter of inherent power or ancillary jurisdiction or both, the Court has power \nto adjudicate movant's request for access. Holding otherwise would create anomalous results that \nwould deprive the FISC of its inherent authority over its records and clash with the purpose of \nFISA. \nA.  Holding that the FISC does not have jurisdiction to entertain a motion for \naccess to its records would effectively deprive it of control of its own records. \nIf this Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain First Amendment right-of-access \nmotions, Movants would be forced to bring their motion in a federal district court, which plainly \nwould have jurisdiction to entertain the constitutional claims presented. See 28 U .S.C. § 1331. \nDoing so, however, would create a range of thorny problems. \nAs demonstrated above, this Court's subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate motions for \naccess to its own opinions is entwined with its inherent authority as a tribunal. A determination \n12 \n\nthat the FISC lacks jurisdiction to consider Movants' application would suggest that it is, despite \nits Article III status, a lesser \"court.\" While the rule in other Article III courts is that court files \nl \nthat \"remain under the aegis of the court ... are superintended by the judges who have dominion \n! \nover the court,\" Gambale, 377 F.3d at 141, a ruling against the FISC'sjurisdiction here would \nl \nmean that this Court lacks the same \"aegis\" and \"dominion\" over the matters that come before it. \nI \nIndeed, it would also imply that this Court lacks authority to supervise litigants, enforce orders, \nI \nand even to publish its own opinions-in direct conflict with the \"inherent authority\" explicitly \nI \nI \ncontemplated by the statute, 50 U.S.C. § 1803(h), and the Court's (and the FISCR's) past \nI \npractice, as described above. \nI \nThe exercise ofj urisdiction by a federal district court would also disturb ordinary \ni \nI \nprinciples of comity and deference among courts of coordinate jurisdiction. Indeed, it would not \n! \nI \nonly invite, but practically ensure, duplicative litigation in multiple other courts over materials \nI \n! \nauthored, stored, distributed, and managed by this one. See, e.g., Colo. River Water Conservation  I!  \n' \nI \nDist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976) (\"As between federal district courts, ... the \ni \ngeneral principle is to avoid duplicative litigation.\"); see also Pacesetter Sys., Inc. v. Medtronic, \ni \nI \nInc., 678 F .2d 93, 94-95 (9th Cir. 1982); Great N  Ry. Co. v. Nat 'l R.R. Adjustment Bd., First \nf \n~ \nDiv., 422 F .2d 1187, 1193 (7th Cir. 1970); W. Gulf Mar. Ass 'n v. ILA Deep Sea Local 24, et al.,  ~ \nI \n751 F.2d 721, 728 (5th Cir. 1985). A district court's exercise of jurisdiction over disputes \nt \nconcerning FISC opinions may also require the district court to adjudicate issues concerning \n•~  \n! \nFISC rules and procedures, over which this Court has statutory authority. 50 U.S.C. § 1803(g)(l).  $: \nt \nSuch a tortured result strongly suggests that a holding against jurisdiction here would be  I \nI \nerroneous. In fact, outside of this Court, the government has agreed that the prospect of other \nt \nI \ndistrict courts entertaining claims to this Court's records would interfere with the basic and \nf \nI \n, \n~ \n13 \n\ninherent relationship this Court has with its own cases and files. In ongoing litigation in the \nNorthern District of California, the government recognized that this Court was best positioned to \ndetermine whether its own orders need remain secret. It urged the district court, in the interests of \n\"comity and orderly judicial administration,\" not to exercise its jurisdiction over First \nAmendment claims related to FISA orders received by the plaintiff. Defs.' Notice of Mot. & \nPartial Mot. to Dismiss at 13, Twitter, Inc. v. Holder, No. 14-cv-4480 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 9, 2015) \n(ECF No. 28). These concerns about intruding upon the authority of other courts to control their \nown records are common: in considering a petition to unseal surveillance documents, one \nmagistrate judge concluded that she lacked authority to \"reverse the sealing orders of other \njudges in this district.\" Order at 3, In re Petition ofJ ennifer Granick & Riana Pfefferkorn, No. \n16-mc-80206-KA W (N.D. Cal. June 23, 2017) (ECF No. 36). While there may be cases in which \na court could properly exercise jurisdiction over claims related to matters originating in a sister \ncourt (including this one), such a proceeding would clearly not be undertaken lightly. \nRequiring Movants to pursue the relief sought here in one of the federal district courts \nwould require those courts to engage in an unusual form of collateral review and would impinge \non this Court's authority over its proceedings, rules, and procedures. Moreover, for the reasons \nexplained below, this Court is the Article III court best equipped to assess--on the merits-\nwhether its own opinions must be withheld in whole or in part from the public. \nB.  Holding that the FISC does not have jurisdiction to entertain right-of-access \nmotions would contravene Congress's intent to vest expertise on FISA \nmatters in the FISC. \nIn enacting FISA, Congress sought to ensure that a specialized tribunal would develop \nexpertise in foreign intelligence surveillance matters-an expertise that extends to motions \nseeking public access to the Court's records. As the House Report observed, a specialized court \n14 \n\nwould \"likely ... be able to put claims of national security in a better perspective and to have \ngreater confidence in interpreting this bill than judges who do not have occasion to deal with the \nsurveillances under this bill.\" H.R. Rep. No. 95-1283, at 91 (1978). Similarly, the Senate \nexplained that \"[t]he need to preserve secrecy for sensitive counterintelligence sources and \ni \nmethods justifies ... consolidation of judicial authority in a special court.\" S. Rep. No. 95-701,  i \nI \n' \nat 12 (1978), as reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3973. At the same time, as noted above,  j \nCongress explicitly recognized the FISC's inherent authority to \"establish such rules and \nI \nprocedures, and take such actions, as are reasonably necessary to administer [its] responsibilities \nI \nunder this chapter.\" 50 U.S.C. §§ 1803(g)(I), (h). Congress's intent to vest this Court with \nspecialized expertise, while preserving its inherent authority as an Article III court, leaves \nI \njurisdiction over this motion where it logically belongs: with the FISC itself, which of course has \nI \nclose familiarity with its own opinions and proceedings.  I \nI \nThe fact that a specialized tribunal has subject matter jurisdiction over a limited set of  I \nI \nclaims does not strip it of the authority inherent to the exercise of judicial power. Other courts of \nI \nspecialized jurisdiction have adjudicated motions seeking access to their records on authority  I \nI \nsimilar to FISC's own. For instance, bankruptcy courts, which are established under Article I and  ' \nI \nI \nwhose power is limited to cases arising under Title 11 of the U.S. Code, see 28 U.S.C. § 157,  ! \nhave exercised jurisdiction over right-of-access motions brought by non-parties. See, e.g., In re  I \nI \nAlterra Healthcare Corp., 353 B.R. 66 (holding that the court had jurisdiction over newspaper's \nI \nchallenge to sealing orders because the motion was \"a core proceeding over which the Court has \nI \nsubject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1334(b) &  157(b)(2)(A)\"); In re Bennett  I \nI \nFunding Grp., Inc., 226 B.R. 331 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y. 1998); In re Symington, 209 B.R. 678 \nI \n(Bankr. D. Md. 1997).  ~ \n£ \ni \nI \nj \n15  ! \n\nThe analogy to bankruptcy proceedings is instructive: bankruptcy courts have repeatedly \nexercised jurisdiction over right-of-access motions, despite their limited subject matter \njurisdiction, and have thus been able to effectuate their own inherent authority over their judicial \nrecords. Likewise, Congress intended for this Court to develop institutional competence in FISA-\nrelated proceedings, and the Court is well-equipped to adjudicate Movants' access motion. \nWhile Congress may \"limit the exercise of the inherent power of courts by statute and \nrule,\" the Supreme Court has made clear that courts \"do not lightly assume that Congress has \nintended to depart from established principles such as the scope of a court's inherent power.\" \nChambers, 501 U.S. at 47; see Lin v. DOJ, 473 F.3d 48, 53 (2d Cir. 2007) (\"[B]efore we will \nconclude that Congress intended to deprive us of our inherent powers, we require something akin \nto a clear indication of legislative intent.\"). 8 Far from stripping this Court of its inherent powers, \nhowever, Congress explicitly preserved that authority. 50 U.S.C. § l 803(g), (h). Holding that this \nCourt lacks jurisdiction to decide a motion seeking publication of its own opinions would divest \nthe FISC of the inherent judicial authority recognized in FISA. And it would undermine the \nspecialized expertise that Congress sought to create in this Court. \nIV.  Public disclosures of FISC opinions over the past four years support Movants' \nmotion on the merits. \nIn the time since this motion was originally briefed in 2013, developments across all \nthree branches of government confirm the logic of affording public access to the FISC's \nopinions. This movement toward disclosure more closely aligns the FISC with the well-\n8 \nIndeed, \"[s]ome elements of [courts'] inherent authority are so essential to '[t]he judicial \nPower,' U.S. Const., Art. III,§ 1, that they are indefeasible,\" and Congress may only \"specify \nthe manner in which [those] ... powers ... will be exercised, so long as the effectiveness of \nthose powers is not impaired.\" Chambers, 501 U.S. at 59-60 (Scalia, J., concurring). That is the \ncase here, where the Court's power over its own opinions and records is at stake. \n16 \n\nestablished history of public access to judicial opinions, see Mot. for Release of Court Records \n16-21, and supports Movants' claim on the merits.9 \nWhen Movants filed their motion in November 2013, only a handful of the FISC's \nopinions had been released in the Court's 35-year history. In the past four years, however, \ndozens of opinions and more than one hundred orders have been released, as the FISC, the \nExecutive Branch, and Congress acknowledged the benefits of making the Court's legal \nreasoning available to the public. See Appendix, Br. of Amicus Curiae Laura Donohue, In re \nCertification of Questions ofL aw, No. 18-01 (FISCR Feb. 23, 2018), https://perma.ccN6W6-\nX47V; Letter from Hon. John D. Bates, Dir. of the Admin. Off. of U.S. Courts, to Hon. Patrick J. \nLeahy at 6 (Aug. 5, 2014), https://perma.cc/Y5QS-BHP6 (\"[R]ecent experience shows that the \npreparation and release of redacted opinions can, in some cases, contribute to public \nunderstanding of the FISA courts' work.\" (emphasis in original)). A number of these releases-\nincluding two of the opinions at issue in this motion-were initiated by the FISC itself and were \nposted to the Court's public electronic docket, which did not exist prior to 2013. See Eagan \nOpinion; McLaughlin Opinion. Similarly, the Court has rightly treated its judicial opinions \naddressing Movants' access motions as presumptively public, even before passage of the USA \nFREEDOM Act. See, e.g., In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *7; Opinion and \nOrder Directing Declassification of Redacted Opinion, In re Section 215 Orders, No. Misc. 13-\n02 (FISC Aug. 7, 2014), http://l.usa.gov/lyekctM. In this way, the FISC already routinely \npublishes certain subsets of its opinions just as other Article III courts publish their opinions. \nOver the past four years, both the Executive Branch and Congress have also recognized \nthe logic of releasing significant opinions of this Court to the public. The Privacy and Civil \n9 \nSee also Br. of Amicus Curiae Laura Donohue at 2-27, In re Certification ofQ  uestions of \nLaw, No. 18-01 (FISCR Feb. 23, 2018), https://perma.cc/2WUJ-R7SA. \n17 \n\nLiberties Oversight Board, in preparing its report on the bulk telephony program, reviewed a \nnumber of the FISC's opinions and on that basis called for greater public disclosure: \"[T]hese \nopinions describe (often in very accessible language) the scope of the government's authority \nand the ways in which that authority is implemented in contexts affecting the rights of \nAmericans. There is thus public interest in the disclosure of these opinions.\" Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board, Report on the Telephone Records Program Conducted Under Section \n215 199-200 (Jan. 23, 2014), https://perma.cc/W4HA-S5QV. The President's Review Group \nissued a similar recommendation. \"[l]n order to further the rule oflaw, FISC opinions or, when \nappropriate, redacted versions of FISC opinions, should be made public in a timely manner, \nunless secrecy of the opinion is essential to the effectiveness of a properly classified program.\" \nPresident's Review Group on Intelligence & Communications Technologies, Liberty & \nTechnology in a Changing World 206-07 (Dec. 12, 2013), https://perma.cc/2LLX-H2ZN. In \nJune 2015, as part of the USA FREEDOM Act, Congress responded to these calls for greater \ntransparency by directing the government to publicly release significant opinions of this Court to \nthe greatest extent practicable. 10 See 50 U.S.C. § 1872. \nThese developments reinforce Movants' arguments on the merits. They evince the same \nlogic that has motivated the long history of public access to judicial opinions in this country: a \nrecognition that, in a democracy committed to the rule of law, publication of judicial decisions is \nan essential corollary to judicial decisionmaking. See, e.g., Nash v. Lathrop, 142 Mass. 29, 35-\n36 (1886) (cited by Banks v. Manchester, 128 U.S. 244, 253-54 (1888) (Blatchford, J.)); \nLowenschuss, 542 F.2d at 185. As Movants have argued previously, the fact that certain FISC \nopinions contain classified information may affect the Court's ultimate determination of what \n10 Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective Discipline \nOver Monitoring Act (\"USA FREEDOM Act\"), Pub. L. No. 114-23, 129 Stat. 268 (2015). \n18 \n\nmay be withheld from the public, but it does not place these opinions altogether beyond the reach \nof the First Amendment. Movants' Reply Br. 8-10 (citing cases where courts applied First \nAmendment right of access to opinions containing classified information). \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Movants respectfully request that the Court release the judicial \nopinions at issue with only those limited redactions that meet the strict test for overcoming the \nconstitutional right of public access. \nDated: June 13, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \nIsl Patrick Toomey \nDavid A.

Scripps Company, \nFirst Amendment Coalition, Gannett Co., Inc., Hearst Corporation, Investigative Reporters and \nEditors, Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University, The McClatchy Company, \nMedia Consortium, The National Press Club, National Press Photographers Association, \nNational Public Radio, Inc., The New York Times Company, The New Yorker, North Jersey \nMedia Group Inc., Online News Association, POLITICO LLC, Radio Television Digital News \nAssociation, The Seattle Times Company, and The Washington Post. \n1 \n\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nPublic access to court proceedings is the linchpin of public acceptance of the legitimacy \nand credibility ofj udicial institutions.  This right has long been understood as one held by the \npublic at large under the First Amendment and at common law, with the news media often acting \nas a proxy - but never a substitute - for the general public.  This Court's decision on September \n13, 2013 to exclude the Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic at Yale Law School \n(MFIAC) from that right by concluding that the group lacked standing, and to adopt a narrow \ntest under which it found that the ACLU had standing, interferes with the most basic \nconstitutional commandments and common-law traditions underlying the laws of access to \ncourts, and is particularly problematic in a court already so closed off from public view. \nAmici, as news media organizations, often represent the public interest before courts in \npressing for access and also by educating the public about how the judicial system operates.  The \nMFIAC performs the same service.  The public and the press have always been understood to \nhave equal access to court records and court proceedings, much as both the public and the media \nare understood to have co-extensive First Amendment rights generally.  The fact that, in practice, \nit is often traditional news media outlets litigating for access or records does not mean that public \ninterest organizations lack standing to vindicate the public's access rights as well.  That MFIAC \nsought access to court records and was denied them constitutes an injury-in-fact under the \nRichmond Newspapers line of cases.  There is no question of the cause of the injury, nor is there \nany doubt that this Court has the power to redress that injury. \nFurthermore, the public has an important interest in learning the justification behind the \ndecision to allow the NSA to conduct its surveillance programs.  The recently declassified \ndisclosures about how some of those decisions have been made support the idea that the public \nneeds to know more about how the FISA Court has set this important precedent. \n2 \n\nARGUMENT \nI.  The right of access to court proceedings and documents belongs to the general \npublic and can be vindicated by any member of the public. \nThe effort to have this Court release the precedential opinions that underlie the National \nSecurity Agency's surveillance programs is still active, as this Court has ordered the government \nto conduct a declassification review after finding that the ACLU had standing to pursue a claim \nfor public access to the decisions.  Misc. 13-02 (Opinion and Order of Sept. 13,2013.  However, \nsome of the focus has now turned to the issue of what parties must show to have standing to \nprosecute that right of access.  The ACLU and its Nation's Capital chapter were only allowed to \nproceed because they could demonstrate that lack of access \"impedes their own activities in a \nconcrete, particular way,\" id. at 5, while the MFIAC was denied standing in the same order, id. at \n9.  In addition, ProPublica has joined this cause and stressed that it has standing as a member of \nthe media.  Misc. 13-09 (Motion of Nov. 12,2013). \nWhile the news media have a long tradition of fighting for public access to court \nproceedings and records, it is important for this Court to recognize that this right is possessed by \nthe public at large, and the interests at stake can be vindicated by anyone.  In fact, the key \nSupreme Court access cases - Nixon v.  Warner Communications, Inc., 435 U.S. 589 (1978), \nGannett Co., Inc. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368 (1979), Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v.  Virginia, \n448 U.S. 555 (1980), Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court o/California, Riverside (\"Press-\nEnterprise 1'),464 U.S. 501 (1984), and Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court o/California, \nRiverside (\"Press-Enterprise 11'),478 U.S. 1 (1986) - do not examine the question of standing to \nbring an action for access.  These cases establish a presumption of a right of access based on the \n3 \n\nimportant public interests at stake and do not even pause to consider whether the parties have \ndemonstrated any particular harm.  Instead, the public interest in access, by itself, is enough. \nA.  All members of the public share an equal right of access to the courts. \nAlthough it is news organizations that have traditionally brought suit to obtain access to \nrecords and proceedings, courts have firmly based this right of access in a right of the general \npublic to know how its courts operate.  Moreover, courts have found that all members of the \npublic equally share the right to enforce these long-established understandings. \nNixon v.  Warner Communications, the seminal Supreme Court case recognizing the \ncommon-law right of access to judicial documents, noted a presumptive right of access based on \nnothing more than a citizen's desire to hold the government accountable: \nIt is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general right to inspect and copy \npublic records and documents, including judicial records and documents.  In contrast to \nthe English practice, American decisions generally do not condition enforcement of this \nright on a proprietary interest in the document or upon a need for it as evidence in a \nlawsuit.  The interest necessary to support the issuance of a writ compelling access has \nbeen found, for example, in the citizen's desire to keep a watchful eye on the workings of \npublic agencies, and in a newspaper publisher's intention to publish information \nconcerning the operation of government. \nNixon, 435 U.S. at 598 (citations and footnotes omitted).  At issue in Nixon was access to \npresidential tapes during a trial of Watergate conspirators.  The Court did not presume that \nWamer Communications had standing only because it had thrust itself into coverage of the \nWatergate investigation; the Court clearly would have entertained an action for access by any \ncitizen with a \"watchful eye.\" !d. \nIn Richmond Newspapers v.  Virginia, 448 U.S. at 564-75, applying the First Amendment, \nthe Court examined at great length the history of openness in trials and its importance to the \npublic.  As the Court concluded, \n4 \n\nPeople in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is \ndifficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.  When a criminal \ntrial is conducted in the open, there is at least an opportunity both for understanding the \nsystem in general and its workings in a particular case. \nId. at 572.  These substantial public interests were not based on anything other than the \ngeneralized interest in having an open justice system, and standing to intervene was not \naddressed.  Id.  See also In re Access to Jury Questionnaires, 37 A.3d 879, 885 (D.C. 2012) \n(\"The right of public access is 'a right that any member of the public can assert[.],\") (citation \nomitted).  When media organizations have sued for access, the Supreme Court has repeatedly \nframed the right of access as a right of the public generally, not a right unique to the press.  See \nGannett, 443 U.S. at 370 (framing issue as whether ''members of the public\" can attend pre-trial \nproceedings); Press-Enterprise L 464 U.S. at 508 (finding that \"everyone in the community\"  can \nattend voir dire).  As access is a public right, any member of the public who has been excluded \nfrom a courtroom can intervene. \nAlthough the Supreme Court has not demanded a showing of standing before allowing an \naccess action, it is nonetheless clear that denial of information at the heart of democratic process \nwould suffice as a harm that establishes standing.  See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, \n611-12 (1973) (explaining that because the First Amendment requires \"breathing space,\" \nstanding rules are relaxed in constitutional challenges of state action and litigants can sue for \nviolations of others' rights).  See also Nicolas Cornell, Note, Overbreadth and Listeners' Rights, \n123 Harv. L. Rev. 1749 (2010) (\"Insofar as the First Amendment protects a general right of the \ncitizenry to open and undistorted discourse, such a right is an appropriate basis for standing.\"). \nTo contextualize this presumption of openness, the Supreme Court has explained that a \npublic right of access dates back to England and colonial America.  See Richmond Newspapers, \n448 U.S. at 564 {\"[T]hroughout its evolution, the trial has been open to all who care to \n5 \n\nobserve.\").  New Jersey's colonial charter, for instance, allowed \"any person or persons\" to \n\"freely come\" to civil or criminal trials.  !d. at 567 (citation omitted).  Consequently, the \nholdings of Richmond Newspapers and other access cases are not about \"media-specific rights.\" \nRonNell Andersen Jones, Litigation, Legislation and Democracy in a Post-Newspaper America, \n68 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 557,627 (2011).  Instead, the cases are a \"bold statement on the needs \nof 'people in an open society' and the value of public observation in government proceedings.\" \nId.  Indeed, in oral argument in Richmond Newspapers, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger asked the \nnews outlet's attorney whether there is a difference between \"a person who wants to attend [a \ntrial] to write something or just make a speech about it.\"  Lucas A. Powe, Jr., The Fourth Estate \nand the Constitution 244 (1992).  The lawyer, Lawrence Tribe, replied \"None, nor if he just \nwanted to inform himselfa s a citizen.\" Id. (emphasis added). \nCases outside of the court-access area also show that the press and public's rights of \naccess are generally co-extensive in other ways.  When news outlets have challenged statutes \nthat prohibit the general public from interviewing prison inmates, courts have declined to find \nthat journalists have special access rights under the Constitution.  Instead, they have said that \nreporters have no First Amendment newsgathering rights \"not available to the public generally.\" \nPel! v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 834 (1974).  Such a determination reiterates that members of the \npublic and reporters share the same rights to watch a trial or read judicial opinions; neither's \ninterest is greater than the other, but both are sufficient to advance an action for public access. \nB.  The standard applied by this Court undermines the right of even the news \nmedia to seek access to court records and proceedings. \nThis Court ignored Supreme Court precedent when it denied MFIAC standing because it \nfound that the clinic had not \"participated in public debate about Section 215.\"  Misc. 13-02 \n(Opinion and Order of Sept. 13,2013) at 9 n.13.  The Richmond Newspapers line of cases and \n6 \n\nBroadrick show that because access to court information is a public right, anyone who wants \naccess has standing to pursue it.  Requiring groups to show that access would be of \"concrete, \nparticular assistance to them in their own activities,\" as this Court held, would be akin to \nrequiring an individual who is barred from the courtroom to prove that his past actions show that \nhe has a specific stake in attending a hearing.  Id. at 5.  But, as Richmond Newspapers explains, \n\"what transpires in the courtroom is public property.\" 448 U.S. at 593 (citation omitted). \nPotential harm to the public debate and erosion in confidence to the judicial system is an injury \nthat everyone shares when access rights are denied. \nMoreover, this Court's standard would directly threaten the traditional ability of the news \nmedia to fight for access.  While it seems that a news organization that intends to report on a \npublic controversy would be able to satisfy this standard, a court could use it to deny standing to \na media party that could not show a prior track record of covering a particular issue.  Such a rule, \nhowever, ignores the constitutionally compelled mandate of Richmond Newspapers: that access \nis a right that everyone has and that an abridgement of that right harms the public's right to hold \nits government accountable. \nc. \nThe changing dynamics of the news industry have increased the importance \nof a broad public right to challenge court closure. \nAlthough the access right to court records and proceedings is one that all people hold, \ncourts have recognized that reporters serve as \"surrogates\" for members of the public who are \nunable to attend hearings or obtain documents themselves.  Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. at \n573; see also Nixon, 435 U.S. at 609 (\"[T]he press serves as the information-gathering agent of \nthe public.\").  As such, although it is not constitutionally required, journalists sometimes receive \nspecial seating and priority of entry to courtrooms so that they can fulfill their role of informing \nthe public.  Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. at 573; see also Pell, 417 U.S. at 830-31 \n7 \n\n(acknowledging that reporters, by virtue of their profession, receive permission to observe prison \nprograms and interview participants). \nGiven that journalists help ensure public access by serving as the \"information-gathering \nagent\" of people who cannot go to courtrooms themselves, it is especially important that this \nCourt recognize the interests of new groups, like MFIAC, that are forming to take on these same \nresponsibilities for the benefit of the public.  MFIAC's mission is \"to support a robust \ninvestigative role for news organizations and to preserve the public's right of access to \ninformation, thereby ensuring a well-informed public sphere.\"  Media, Freedom and Information \nAccess Clinic, http://www.law.yale.eduiacademics/MFIA.htm (last visited Nov. 22, 2013). \nAlthough the media and the public generally have co-extensive First Amendment rights \nand equal rights of access to court records, the news media have often played a special role in the \njudicial system.  Traditional news media have historically led the effort to increase public access \nto the courts.  See Jones, supra, at 559.  These companies have spent the past century advocating \non behalf of the public in all areas of First Amendment law, thereby reducing the need for \nmembers of the public to take up the fight themselves.  Among the major constitutional victories \nthe media have won for the public are the right to publish without prior restraint (New York \nTimes v.  United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971), protection from defamation lawsuits for good-faith \nmistakes (New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), access to the voir dire portion ofa \ntrial (Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside, 464 U.S. 501 (1984), and the right \nof access to criminal trials (Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v.  Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980».  See \nJones, supra, at 573-575.  As Jones explains, \"In this role, these entities claim credit for the \nestablishment and implementation of some of the nation's most important statutory and \nconstitutional mandates.  Their death threatens the preservation, enforcement, and further \n8 \n\n'-\ndevelopment of these mandates.\" [d. at 559.  While amici feel that news of their \"death\" has \nbeen greatly exaggerated, shrinking budgets at large media companies have inevitably meant a \ndrop-off in First Amendment litigation from those outlets.  When the news organizations that \nhave historically had the financial resources to vindicate the right of access are less able to \npursue every access case, it becomes critical that lower courts follow the concept so clearly \nestablished in Nixon and Richmond Newspapers - that court access is truly a public right that \nmay be defended by anyone to whom it is denied. \nMore and more often now, those defenders are organizations like MFIAC.  Private \nfoundations are increasingly funding the pursuit of access litigation.  See Growth in Foundation \nSupport/or Media in the United States, Knight Foundation, 4 (Nov. 2013), available at \nhttp://bit.ly/laOzL22.  Between 2009 and 2011, media access and access policy efforts received \n$134.7 million from private foundations.  [d. at 12-13.  This figure demonstrates that outside \ngroups that traditionally have not been involved in access debates are becoming participants in \nthis crucial area of First Amendment jurisprudence.  New entrants should not be excluded, as \nMFIAC was, for attempting to join this critical field.  Additionally, the primacy foundations have \nput recently on open government and access efforts highlights the vital role MFIAC and other \nclinical and public interest programs play in public discourse and in vindicating and protecting \nthe public's constitutional rights.  As these types of organizations assume a greater role in \nhelping represent the public's interests, it is essential that this Court and others recognize the \nimportance of these actors in the constitutional debate. \nWhile the litigation leadership from the traditional news media that this country has seen \nover the past century will surely continue, university programs like MFIAC are particularly well \npositioned to represent the public interest in access cases they choose to pursue.  A need for a \n9 \n\nproxy representative of the general public in First Amendment cases undoubtedly remains. \n\"Given the complexity, expense, and time involved in making even simple requests, [newsroom \nlawyers] are skeptical that members of the public will be able or willing to take up the effort \nalone.\" Jones, supra, at 597.  Just as an individual member of the public who is turned away \nfrom the courthouse can seek redress for that harm, an individual public interest group that is \nlitigating to increase public knowledge and understanding of the court system has standing to \nprotest its own exclusion.  Law school clinics, like MFIAC, are serving the public interest in new \nand creative ways for the benefit of all of our legal and judicial institutions.  Id. at 628.  This \nCourt must recognize the role such groups are playing in representing the public, much in the \nway the judiciary has always trusted the traditional media to do. \nII.  The documents sought in these cases are critically important to improving public \nunderstanding of this Court and the federal government's national security \noperations. \nThe scope, legality, and administration ofNSA surveillance programs - including bulk \ncall tracking and collection of internet metadata and cell-site location information - have \ngenerated great public controversy in recent months.  While many of the amici here have already \nweighed in on the issue of the important public interest at stake in access to the precedential \nopinions of this Court, see Brief of Amicus Curiae of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of \nthe Press et aI., filed July 15, 20l3, further disclosures in recent months about these decisions \namplify the need for access and merits attention here. \nA.  These opinions are needed to promote robust debate about important public \nissues and to instill faith in the judicial system. \nChief among the justifications for the presumption of court openness is that ''uninhibited, \nrobust, and wide-open debate\" about public issues strengthens democracy by giving voters better \nunderstanding about government programs put in place by their elected officials.  Richmond \n10 \n\nNewspapers, 448 U.S. at 587 (Brennan, J., concurring) (citation omitted).  For amici, opinions on \nthe legal basis ofNSA programs are especially important because uncertainty about the scope of \nsurveillance efforts has deterred confidential sources from speaking with reporters.  Discussing \nthe NSA surveillance programs, New York Times investigative reporter and three-time Pulitzer \nPrize winner David Barstow said, \"I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that stories have not \ngotten done because of this.\" Jamie Schuman, The Shadows oft he Spooks, The News Media and \nthe Law, Fall 2013, at 9; see also Leonard Downie Jr., The Obama Administration and the Press: \nLeak Investigations and Surveillance in Post-9I}} America, Comm. to Protect Journalists, Oct. \n10,2013, available at http://bit.ly/lc3Cnfg.  Major works ofj ournalism, from stories about the \nWatergate break-in to pieces on harsh CIA investigation tactics, have relied on confidential \ninterviews.  When potential sources refuse to speak to reporters out of fear of surveillance, \nquality reporting is diminished and the public is less informed. \nAnother benefit of court openness is that secrecy weakens the credibility of the justice \nsystem and government affairs in general.  Press-Enterprise 1,464 U.S. at 508.  In Gannett Co .• \nInc. v. DePasquale, the Supreme Court explained, \"Public confidence cannot long be maintained \nwhere important judicial decisions are made behind closed doors and then announced in \nconclusive terms to the public, with the record supporting the court's decision sealed from public \nview.\"  443 U.S. at 429 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (quoting United \nStates v. Cianfrani, 573 F .2d 835, 851 (3rd Cir. 1978». \nIn addition to closing its proceedings and sealing its records, the FISA Court has only one \nside - the government - arguing before it.  Disclosing precedential opinions would be a major \nstep towards fostering trust in the Court and public understanding of surveillance programs. \n11 \n\nThese changes would especially benefit journalists, whose work requires the willingness of \nsources to speak with them. \nB.  Recent revelations about programs that this Court has sanctioned \nunderscore the need for information about its decision-making process. \nThe need for openness is especially important in light of the recent revelations about the \nprograms this Court has sanctioned and the government's expansion of surveillance beyond what \nthis Court has indicated it intended.  In the past six months, Americans have learned that this \nCourt approved the collection of the ''to'' and \"from\" fields in e-mail messages, as well as the \ndate and time the messages were sent.  Joseph Menn, Secret U.S. Court Approved Wider NSA \nSpying Even After Finding Excesses, Reuters, Nov. 19,2013, available at http://reut.rs/IlAmGn. \nIt has also become public that this Court criticized the government for exceeding the surveillance \nauthority this Court had granted it in earlier cases.  In an opinion released just this month, Judge \nJohn Bates referred to systematic overcollection and concluded that: \ngiven the duration of this problem, the oversight measures ostensibly taken since \n[redacted] to detect overcollection, and the extraordinary fact that NSA's end-to \nend review overlooked unauthorized acquisitions that were documented in \nvirtually every record of what was acquired, it must be added that those \nresponsible for conducting oversight at NSA failed to do so effectively. \nMemorandum Opinion by Judge John Bates, pp. 21-22, available at http://l.usa.gov/lgZwy7b; \nsee also Menn, supra; Kimberly Dozier & Stephen Braun, NSA Reveals More Secrets After \nCourt Order, Associated Press, Aug. 22, 2013, available at http://bit.ly/141Iee7; Charlie Savage \n& Scott Shane, Secret Court Rebuked N.S.A. on Surveillance, N.Y. Times, Aug. 21,2013, \navailable at http://nyti.ms/15aSPlr.  Judge Bates' concerns over NSA's overreaching emphasizes \nwhy it is so important that Americans, through organizations like MFIAC, have access to this \nCourt's decisions. \n12 \n\nBy way of further example of the impact this Court has on everyday citizens~ the recently \ndeclassified opinion from this Court requiring Verizon to turn over phone records of every call \nplaced on its network involving a U.S. phone was styled as a warrant request but actually served \nas precedent allowing for the massive and indiscriminate collection of Americans' \ncommunications data.  See In Re Application oft he FBlfor an Order Requiring the Production \nof Tangible Things from Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc., on Behalfo  fM  el Commc 'n Servs., \nInc. d/b/a! Verizon Bus. Servs., No. BR 13-80 (FISC Apr. 25, 2013), available at \nhttp://bit.ly/llFY393.  Unlike a traditional warrant application and grant, which is typically \nwithheld from public view until after the warrant is executed because it names the targeted \nindividual and the information sought, the Verizon decision did not name a particular suspect nor \ndid it point to any particular investigation.  Weighing the serious constitutional concerns at issue \nagainst the government's desire for secrecy, the balance should have favored earlier disclosure of \nthis Court's ruling.  The history of the Verizon order demonstrates the need to continually release \nthe types of decisions MFIAC, the ACLU, and ProPublica seek here. \n13 \n\n•. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, this Court should grant the ACLU and MFIAC's November \n6,2013 motion for the release of court records; the MFIAC's October 11,2013 motion for \nreconsideration; and ProPublica's November 12, 2013 motion for release of court records. \n*** \nPursuant to this Court's order, dated July 18, 2013, and United States Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court R.P. 7(h)(1) and 63, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the \nPress respectfully submits the following information: \nBruce D.

The government has declassified portions of the four opinions that it represents are \nresponsive to this motion for public access, but it wrongly contends that its unilateral \ndeclassification review resolves this motion-that the Court, in other words, has no role to play \nin determining which portions of its opinions are released and whether.the government's \nextensive redactions satisfy the strict First Amendment standard that governs the sealing of \njudicial opinions. That is emphatically not the case. \nWhile much of this Court's work may not be subject to a constitutional right of access, \nthis motion concerns opinions containing significant legal interpretation of the Constitution and \nstatutory law. For those sorts of opinions, at least, the First Amendment has always required \ncourts to operate openly to allow the public to assure itself that judicial proceedings are fair and \njust, to improve the quality of proceedings and the perfonnance of participants, and to educate \nthe public. It obligates the courts to detennine-independently, even in cases concerning national \nsecurity-whether any proposed sealing of their opinions is narrowly tailored to serve \ncompelling interests. Adherence to the Constitution's command is especially vital in this case, \ngiven the importance of the opinions sought to the ongoing public, judicial, and legislative \ndebates about the legality and wisdom ofpennitting the government to acquire Americans' \nsensitive data in bulk. \nAn independent judicial determination is also important here because many of the \nredactions proposed by the government are inexplicable. As but one particularly egregious \nexample, the government has redacted the dates of dozens of seemingly innocuous events, \n1 \n\nincluding the dates that it notified this Court of instances in which it \"exceeded the scope of \nauthorized collection\" under the Court's bulk-collection orders. The availability of statutory \nreview under the Freedom of Information Act to challenge these redactions is no substitute for \nthe constitutional review required by the First Amendment. \nTo give effect to the constitutional right of access, this Court should require the \ngovernment to justify its proposed redactions, permit Movants an opportunity to respond, and \nthen make findings on the record about whether the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to \navert a substantial risk of harm to a compelling governmental interest. \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE FIRST AMENDMENT REQUIRES TillS COURT TO DETERMINE \nINDEPENDENTLY WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED \nA COMPELLING REASON TO REDACT ITS OPINIONS. \nMovants' initial papers demonstrated that the opinions of this Court addressing the \nstatutory and constitutional authority for the government's bulk collection of data are subject to \nthe public's First Amendment right of access. See Mot. of ACLU and MFIA for Release of Ct. \nRecords (\"Mot.\") at 12-21. The government's opposition does not dispute or deny this \ncontrolling fact. Instead, it argues that no relief is required because declassified versions of the \nrequested opinions have been released by the executive branch, and because this Court should \ndefer to the executive's decision to redact classified information from its opinions. This is wrong. \nWhere the constitutional right of access applies, a court must determine whether the party \nseeking to deny public access has established a substantial probability of harm to a compelling \ninterest before the constitutional right may be abridged. See Mot. at 22-23; Press-Enterprise Co. \nv. Superior Court (Press-Enterprise II), 478 U.S. 1,9-11 (1986). The government does not even \nattempt to carry this burden. \n2 \n\nA.  Rule 62Ca) does not relieve this Court of its obligation under the First Amendment \nto evaluate the government's justification for the proposed redactions. \nRather than address its constitutional burden, the government simply \"[p] ut[s ] aside\" the \nFirst Amendment and argues for dismissal on the basis of FISC Rule 62(a). See Gov't Opp'n to \nMot. for Release of Court Records (\"Opp'n\") at 5-7. The government asserts that ''the Court is \nempowered only to 'direct the Executive Branch to review the [opinion] and redact it as \nnecessary to ensure that properly classified information is appropriately protected. '\" Opp'n at 5. \nBut a court rule cannot displace a constitutional right. See Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, \n733 (2008) (statutory procedures cannot displace constitutional privileges where those \nprocedures do not represent an \"adequate and effective substitute\"); In re New York Times Co., \n828 F.2d 110, 115 (2d Cir. 1987) (\"Obviously, a statute cannot override a constitutional right.\"). \nWhile Rule 62(a) permits the Court to publish opinions sua sponte or on motion by a party, it \ncannot limit the scope of the First Amendment right of access. \nNeither the discretion of this Court under Rule 62(a) to request that the executive \nundertake a declassification review, nor the potential for the public to request copies of the \nopinions directly from the executive under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"), are \nadequate substitutes for the constitutional inquiry required under Press-Enterprise II. Before \naccess may be denied to a judicial opinion of an Article III court construing the Constitution and \nthe law, that court must determine whether a denial of access is permitted under the strict \nstandards required by the First Amendment. See Mot. at 21-24; Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at \n13-15. \nB.  To satisfy the First Amendment right of access, the government should be \nrequired to justify its proposed redactions in light of the publicly known facts. \nBecause the public has a First Amendment right to inspect the opinions at issue, the \ngovernment must demonstrate to this Court that the Press-Enterprise II standards have been \n3 \n\nsatisfied with respect to each item of information it asks this Court to withhold from the public. 1 \nAs Judge Saylor did in addressing an earlier request for access, the Court should require the \ngovernment to explain the need for each of its proposed redactions. See In re Orders oft his \nCourt Interpreting Section 215 o/the PATRIOT Act (In re Section 215 Orders), No. Misc. 13-02, \n2013 WL 5460064, at *8 (FISA Ct. Sept. 13,2013); In re Section 215 Orders, No. Misc. 13-02 \n(FISA Ct. Nov. 20, 2013). As discussed below, see infra Part II, the government must do more \nthan simply assert that the information is classified. Rather, it must provide an explanation of the \ncompelling interest that requires continued secrecy of the fact at issue, and a showing.that each \nredaction is both necessary and narrowly tailored to protect that interest. The government's \nexplanation should not be conclusory and should support each of its proposed redactions. Cf In \nre Section 215 Orders, No. Misc. 13-02 (FISA Ct. Nov. 20, 2013) (\"[T]he government shall \nsubmit a detailed explanation of its conclusion that the Opinion is classified in full and cannot be \nmade public, even in redacted form.\"). \nThe Court should allow Movants an opportunity to respond to the government's \nexplanation and should then independently assess whether the First Amendment access right may \nbe overcome. The First Amendment mandates such a process. See Globe Newspaper Co. v. \nSuperior Court/or Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596,609 n.25 (1982) (\"[R]epresentatives of the press \nand general public 'must be given an opportunity to be heard on the question of their \n1 Movants have already fully addressed the government's meritless argument that they lack \nstanding to assert this constitutional right of access. See Opp'n at 2-4; Mot. at 10-12; see also \nMem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. by MFIAC for Recons. of this Court's Sep. 13,2013 Op. on the \nIssue of Article III Standing, In re Section 215 Orders, No. Misc. 13-02 (FISA Ct. Oct. 11, \n2013), http://l.usa.govllaTGGa4 (arguing that MFIAC satisfies the requirements for \nconstitutional standing to seek access to this Court's opinions interpreting Section 215 of the \nPATRIOT Act). \n4 \n\nexclusion.'\" (quoting Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368,401 (1979) (powell, J., \nconcurring)). \nC.  Strict application of the First Amendment standard is particularly important here \ngiven the extraordinary public interest in disclosure of these opinions. \nThe overwhelming public interest in understanding this Court's analysis of the legality of \nbulk collection demands a rigorous application of the First Amendment. Courts have long \nrecognized that \"access is particularly appropriate when the subject matter of the litigation is of \nespecial public interest.\" In re Agent Orange Prod Liab. Litig., 821 F.2d 139, 146 (2d Cir. \n1987). This Court's opinions regarding bulk collection involve some of the most contested and \nimportant issues in the public arena today. Apublic debate regarding the legality of bulk \ncollection by the NSA-often marked by confusion and outrage-has continued unabated since \nJune, when Edward Snowden first revealed the practice of bulk collection. \nThe President, congressional leaders, and the heads of the intelligence agencies have \nacknowledged that the Snowden leaks triggered an important public debate about national \nsecurity and surveillance. President Obama welcomed the debate as \"healthy for our democracy\" \nand as a sign of the \"maturity\" of our nation. See Transcript: What Obama Said on NSA \nControversy, Wall St. J., June 7, 2013, http://on.wsj.comlI9CrJgl.

And in recent months, current and former members of the \nCourt have taken the unorthodox step of defending their institution to the public. See Letter from \nHon. Reggie B. Walton, Presiding Judge, FISC, to Sen. Patrick 1. Leahy, Chairman, Senate \nComm. on the Judiciary (Oct. 11,2013), http://l.usa.gov/19CsvdO (detailing FISC procedures \n6 \n\nand practices); Frederic Frommer, Federal Judge: FISA Court Not a Rubber Stamp, Huffington \nPost, July 11, 20 13, http://bigstory.ap.orglarticle/federal-judge-fisa-court-not-rubber-stamp. 2 \nFinally, the District Court for the District of Columbia's December 16 ruling that the \nNSA's bulk collection and querying of phone record metadata is most likely unconstitutional \nhighlights the significant and positive role that judicial transparency can play in enhancing this \npublic debate. See Klayman v. Obama, No. 13-cv-0851, 2013 WL 6571596 (D.D.C. Dec. 16, \n2013). The overwhelming public response to the opinion,3 both positive4 and negative,S \nillustrates the productive dialogue that judicial decisions can and should generate-precisely the \ndialogue hindered by the government's redaction of the opinions requested here. Indeed, even a \nleading academic defender of the NSA's surveillance activities argued that Judge Leon's \nopinion, though \"unpersuasive in its reasoning,\" nevertheless \"starts a conversation that might \nlead to some very interesting places.,,6 Just days ago, the President's own review group joined \n2 Other former members of the FISC, meanwhile, have publicly criticized elements of the \nCourt's procedures. See, e.g., Hon. James G. Carr, Op-Ed., A Better Secret Court, N.Y. Times, \nJuly 22, 2013, http://nyti.ms/19CsG81; Stephen Braun, Former Judge Admits Flaws with Secret \nFISA Court, Associated Press, July 9,2013, http://bigstory.ap.orglarticle/oversight-board-hears \ntestimony-nsa-spying (quoting Hon.

AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH DECLASSIFICATION REVIEW DOES NOT \nSATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT \nFOR KEEPING JUDICIAL OPINIONS SECRET. \nThe government urges the Court to accept its declassification review and respectfully step \naside. This declassification review, however, fails to satisfy the government's constitutional \nburden to justify censoring portions of a judicial opinion. Moreover, the fruits of its \ndeclassification review in this case--four opinions redacted to shreds-amply illustrate the need \nfor independent judicial review of the proposed redactions in light of the overwhelming public \ninterest in understanding the Court's analysis and application of the nation's surveillance laws. \nA.  The government ignores the essential role of the judiciary in independently \nassessing the public's right of access to judicial opinions. \nThe government's misguided approach focuses on the wrong issue. It stresses that \"the \nFirst Amendment does not justify judicial ... involvement in Executive Branch classification \ndecisions.\" Opp'n at 4. But the issue is not what the executive branch can classify, but whether \nthe executive branch can unilaterally restrict public access to a judicial decision. \"While it is \ntrue, as an abstract proposition, that the government's interest in protecting classified information \ncan be a qualifying compelling and overriding interest,\" the First Amendment \"require[s] a \n7 President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, Liberty and \nSecurity in a Changing World 200-07 (Dec. 12,2013), http://l.usa.govI19Cu8aL. \n8 \n\njudicial inquiry into the legitimacy of the asserted national security interest, and specific \nfindings, sealed if necessary, about the harm to national security that would ensue if the request\" \nis not granted. United States v. Rosen, 487 F. Supp. 2d 703, 717 (E.D. Va. 2007) (emphasis \nadded). Indeed, \"[a] blind acceptance by the courts of the government's insistence on the need \nfor secrecy, without notice to others, without argument, and without a statement of reasons, \nwould impermissibly compromise the independence of the judiciary and open the door to \npossible abuse.\" In re Washington Post Co., 807 F.2d 383,391-92 (4th Cir. 1986). \n. \nAccordingly, where First Amendment rights apply, courts routinely subject claims that \ninformation must remain secret to the heightened level of scrutiny the Constitution demands. See \nMot. at 25-27; see also, e.g., McGehee v. Casey, 718 F.2d 1137, 1148-49 (D.C. Cir. 1983) \n(explaining, in the context of First Amendment challenge to censorship of article written by \nformer government employee, that since \"the judiciary's tasks include the protection of \nindividual rights[,] ... courts must assure themselves that the reasons for classification\" are \nacceptable); Doe v. Gonzales, 386 F. Supp. 2d 66, 76 (D. Conn. 2005) (\"While the court \nrecognizes the [government's] expertise in the area of counter-terrorism and is inclined to afford \ntheir judgments in that area deference, those judgments remain subject to judicial review.\"); \nUnited States v. Grunden, 2 M.l 116, 122 (C.M.A. 1977) (explaining that the trial judge \"must \nbe satisfied from all the evidence and circumstances\" that classification warrants the closure of \nproceedings). \nCourts must independently evaluate whether the executive's proposed sealing overcomes \nthe public's right of access because the First Amendment requires it, but also because the \nstandard for classification differs significantly from the First Amendment standard for sealing \njudicial opinions. Under Executive Order 13,526, information may be classified if an executive \n9 \n\nofficial determines that ''unauthorized disclosure ... reasonably could be expected to result in \ndamage to the national security.\" Exec. Order. 13,526 at § 1.1(4). But the First Amendment \npermits sealing only after a judicial determination that the sealing is narrowly tailored to avoid a \n\"substantial probability\" of harm. Press-Enterprise 11,478 U.S. at 14. Thus, in evaluating the \nwithholding of records under these two different standards, courts might uphold classification \neven while finding the justifications for secrecy wanting under the First Amendment. Compare, \ne.g., ACLU v. Dep't ofS tate, 878 F. Supp. 2d 215,223-24 (D.D.C. 2012) (concluding that \ndocuments publicly disclosed by Wikileaks but not \"officially acknowledged\" remain properly \nclassified), with Bank Julius Baer & Co. v. Wikileaks, 535 F. Supp. 2d 980, 985 (N.D. Cal. 2008) \n(The First Amendment bars preliminary injunction against Wikileaks to prevent further \ndissemination of confidential bank records once \"the cat is out of the bag. \"). \nB.  Many of the government's proposed redactions are facially suspect and warrant \ncareful judicial review. \nHere, the heavy redactions to the Court's opinions proposed by the government only \nunderscore the need for independent judicial assessment of the sealing. While \"release of \nredacted material is clearly a less restrictive means\" of protecting a party's interest than blanket \nsealing, Globe Newspaper Co. v. Pokaski, 684 F. Supp. 1132, 1136 n.4 (D. Mass. 1988), aff'd in \npart, rev'd in part, 868 F.2d 497 (1st Cir. 1989), the judiciary must \"independently examine the \nGovernment's redactions ... to ensure that the redactions ... are no greater than necessary,\" \nUnited States v. Moussaoui, 65 F. App'x 881, 888 (4th Cir. 2003). \nDespite the obligation to minimize redactions to those essential to protect a compelling \ninterest, the government proposes extensive, and often questionable, redactions that seriously \nimpair the public's ability to understand and evaluate the Court's reasoning and holdings. By \nway of example, the government seeks to shield from public view such items as: \n10 \n\n•  The definition of the \"metadata\" for which bulk collection is authorized;8 \n•  The duration of the bulk collection authorized; 9 \n•  The manner in which internet metadata was used, beyond contact chaining; 10 \n•  The nature and duration of the government's non-compliance with past orders; 11 and \n•  Dozens of seemingly innocuous dates, such as the dates of FISC opinions and \napplications to the Court, and even the dates the government notified this Court of its \nviolations of court-imposed limitations on its bulk collection programs. 12 \nThese redactions appear unjustified on their face and warrant the Court's attention. \nOf these, perhaps the most troubling is the government's attempt to keep secret the \ncategories of metadata it was authorized to collect-the very subject, in other words, of its \napplications. See, e.g., Kollar-Kotelly Opinion at 7-11; Bates Opinion at 2. Without this \ninformation, the opinions merely recite the Fourth Amendment's third-party doctrine, but they \nomit the information necessary to make sense of the Court's application of this doctrine to the \n8 See Opinion and Order Authorizing Collection of Bulk Electronic Communications \nMetadata at 7-11, 19 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (released Nov. 18,2013), http://1.usa.govI19Ct5r1 \n(\"Kollar-Kotelly Opinion\") (\"[Redacted] like other forms of metad ata, is not protected by the \nFourth Amendment ....\" ); Opinion and Order Authorizing Reinstatement of Bulk Collection of \nInternet Metadata at 2, 35, 71 (Bates, J.) (released Nov. 18, 2013), http://1.usa.gov/19Ct7Q5 \n(\"Bates Opinion\") (\"The government requests authority to [redacted] categories of [sixteen pages \nof redacted material]. \"). \n9 See, e.g., Bates Opinion at 4. \n10 See, e.g., Kollar-Kotelly Opinion at 42-43 (''NSA proposes to employ two analytic methods \non the body of archived meta data it seeks to collect. ... The two methods are: (1) Contact \nchaining ... [(2)] [Redacted].\"). \n11 See, e.g., Bates Opinion at 2-3 (\"[T]he government acknowledges that NSA exceeded the \nscope of authorized acquisition continuously during the more than [redacted] years of acquisition \nunder these orders.\"); id. at 105 (\"[T]he unauthorized collection included: [redacted].\"). \n12 See, e.g., Kollar-Kotelly Opinion at 2,3, 70; Bates Opinion at 4, 10,13, 14; Amended \nMemorandum Opinion Reauthorizing Bulk Collection of Telephony Metadata at 20 (Eagan, J.) \n(published Sept. 17,2013), http://1.usa.govI19CteLk (\"Eagan Opinion\"). As but one of many \nexamples, Judge Bates's discussion of the government's violations reads as follows: \"On \n[redacted] the government provided written notice to the FISC that it had exceeded the scope of \nauthorized collection [redacted].\" Bates Opinion at 10. \n11 \n\ngovernment's requests. See Ellen Nakashima & Greg Miller, Official Releasing What Appears \nTo Be Original Court File Authorizing NSA To Conduct Sweeps, Wash. Post, Nov. 18,2013, \nhttp://www.wapo.stlIGqxNK. (because \"[t]hree pages [of the Kollar-Kotelly Opinion] describing \nthe 'metadata' ... were redacted,\" its \"true scope\" remains ''unclear''). Judge Bates describes this \napplication of doctrine to categories of meta data as \"difficult line-drawing,\" Bates Opinion at \n71-precisely the type of \"line-drawing\" that the public must see to understand how the law is \nbeing construed and how the Constitution is being applied in this contested area. See Mosaid \nTechnologies Inc. v. LSI Corp., 878 F. Supp. 2d 503,513 (D. Del. 2012) (rejecting proposal to \nredact discussion of how precedent \"should (or should not) apply to the present facts\"). \nBeyond the nature of the material the government seeks to redact, the sheer volume of its \nredactions in some cases \"would have the practical effect of sealing the entire case\" and leave an \ninterested citizen with \"no idea what to make\" of the redacted opinions. In re Platinum & \nPalladium Commodities Litig., 828 F. Supp. 2d 602,604 (S.D.N.Y. 2011); see CRAssociates, \nInc. v. United States, 102 Fed. Cl. 698 (Fed. Cl. 2011), aff'd, 475 F. App'x 341 (Fed. Cir. 2012) \n(rejecting proposed redactions since ''the public version ofth[e] document would scarcely be \ncomprehensible\"). For example, with approximately twenty-five pages redacted, Judge Kollar \nKotelly's opinion is full of impenetrable-but likely critical-passages that are void of the \nmeaning they ought to have. Likewise, in redacting Judge Bates's opinion, the government seeks \nto shield dozens of consecutive pages wholesale, see Bates Opinion at 35-52,57-70, while also \nexcising the individual words or phrases that give meaning to his discussion, see Bates Opinion \nat 3,5. Such extensive redactions \"obscure any discussion of the actual nature\" of the opinions \nand defeat the core oversight purpose of the access right. In re Mosaid Technologies Inc., 878 F. \n12 \n\nSupp. 2d at 507-08 (rejecting the parties' proposal to redact 40 percent of one transcript and 60 \npercent of another). \nWhether these redactions could be justified-and it is difficult to see how all of them \ncould be-their nature and scope call for independent evaluation. Contrary to the government's \nposition, a court cannot \"delegate its authority\" to edit and redact a judicial document and must \ninstead \"make its own redactions, supported by specific findings, after a careful review of all \nclaims for and against access.\" United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 147 (2d Cir. 1995); see \nalso United States v. Moussaoui, 65 F. App'x 881, 888 (4th Cir. 2003) (\"The interest of the \npublic in the flow of information is protected by our exercising independent judgment \nconcerning redactions.\" (emphasis added)). \nGiven the extent of the government's proposed redactions and the tremendous public \ninterest in the contents of these opinions, this Court's \"independent judgment\" is essential. \nID.  FOIA IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF ACCESS. \nIn light of the judiciary's constitutional mandate to independently police access to its own \nproceedings and records, the government's reliance on FOIA-a statute governing access to \nexecutive materials-is wholly misplaced. The government's error not only demonstrates a \ndisturbing insensitivity to core separation-of-powers principles, but it would also have the \npractical effect of narrowing or eliminating the public's First Amendment right of access. \nA.  FOIA's statutory standards for withholding differ significantly from the First \nAmendment's standard for sealing judicial opinions. \nFOIA's statutory standards for determining when information may be withheld from the \npublic cannot satisfy the constitutional right of access that applies to the opinions of this Court. \nThe government is thus wrong in asserting that \"'there would be no point in this Court's merely \nduplicating the judicial review that the ACLU, and anyone else, can obtain by submitting a FOIA \n13 \n\nrequest to the Department of Justice for these same records. '\" Opp'n at 3-4 (quoting In re \nRelease, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 496 n.32). The review this Court undertakes in applying First \nAmendment standards are not \"the saine standards as a district court would [apply] in the FOIA \nlitigation,\" id at 4, particularly where classified information is involved. Whereas Press-\nEnterprise II requires courts to exercise their independent judgment as to whether a compelling \nneed requires some secrecy for information in a court opinion, FOIA directs courts to determine \nonly whether the executive has shown that it \"appears 'logical' or 'plausible'\" that the records \nsought are properly classified. Wolfv. CIA, 473 F.3d 370,374-75 (D.C. Cir. 2007). In both cases \nappropriate deference is given to the \"expertise of agencies engaged in national security and \nforeign policy,\" id at 374, but the ultimate issue for the court to decide is very different where \nthe constitutional righfof access attaches. 13 \nThis difference may well be dispositive here: the government's proposed redactions to \nthe four opinions at issue might satisfy FOIA's inquiry into whether the information is properly \nclassified, but still fail to pass Press-Enterprise Irs exacting standard requiring a \"substantial \nprobability\" of harm and \"narrow[] tailoring.\" Compare ACLUv. Dep't o/State, 878 F. Supp. 2d \nat 223-24, with Bank Julius Baer, 535 F. Supp. 2d at 985. The government thus fails to \nappreciate that these distinct standards of review-and the necessary possibility of divergent \noutcomes-prevent a court from supplanting the First Amendment right of access with FOIA. \n13 Cf Wright v. FBI, 613 F. Supp. 2d. 13,24-25 (D.D.C. 2009) (\"Plaintiffs have relied upon \nthe First Amendment, not FOIA, ~d the Government has cited to no case holding that FOIA is \ncoterminous with the First Amendment. ... Consequently, censorship is prohibited, even if the \nmaterial falls within a FOIA Exemption, where the Government fails to show with reasonable \nspecificity that its interest in censorship ... outweighs the interest of prospective speakers in free \ndissemination of those speakers' views.\"). \n14 \n\nB.  The government's proposal to substitute FOIA review for First Amendment \nanalysis would eviscerate the constitutional right of access. \nThe government's demand that Movants \"respect, and not through [their] motion attempt \nto circumvent, the FOIA process enacted by Congress,\" Opp'n at 4, if accepted by this Court, \nwould upend the public's qualified constitutional right to inspect court records and attend court \nproceedings. Under this theory, the government could defeat public access by \"classifying\" court \nrecords or evidence to be submitted in court--even the Supreme Court-and demanding that \nmembers of the public rely solely on FOIA to seek access. 14 Access as a constitutional right \nprotected by the judicial branch would become, by this sleight of hand, a solely statutory matter. \nAlternatively, the government could entirely defeat the public's right of access to this \nCourt's opinions-Wholly insulating them from public review-by refusing to take the opinions \ninto its possession or to maintain copies over time. Since there is no affirmative requirement that \nthe government do so, and since FOIA does not pennit a requester to seek records directly from a \ncourt, Mayo v. U.S. Gov't Printing Office, 9 F.3d 1450, 1451 (9th Cir. 1993), public access to \nthis Court's opinions would rise or fall on the vagaries of the Justice Department's document-\nretention policy. FOIA is thus no substitute for review required under the First Amendment and \nprovides no proper basis to dismiss this motion. \n14 In enacting the Classified Information Procedures Act, 18 U.S.C. app. 3 §§ 1-16 (\"CIPA\") \nCongress recognized that the need to use \"classified\" information in a criminal prosecution does \nnot automatically justify an abridgment of the public's right of access. Where classified \ninformation is deemed by a judge to be relevant and admissible in a criminal prosecution, CIP A \nrequires the government either to declassify it, find an acceptable non-classified alternative, or \nface consequences up to and including dismissal of the indictment; it does not authorize the \nprosecution to proceed in a closed courtroom or on a sealed record. See generally Edward C. Liu \n& Todd Garvey, Congo Research Serv., R4l742, Protecting Classified Information and the \nRights of Criminal Defendants: The Classified Infonnation Procedures Act 6-11 (2012). \n15 \n\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Movants respectfully request that this Court deny the \ngovernment's request to dismiss their motion and instead unseal its opinions addressing the \nconstitutional and statutory bases for the \"bulk collection\" of records under various authorities \nwithin FISA, including but not limited to 50 U.S.C. § 1842. Movants request that these materials \nbe released as quickly as possible and with only those redactions essential to protect information \nthat the Court determines, after independent review, to warrant continued sealing. Given the \nrelevance of the opinions to an ongoing debate of immense public interest, Movants also request \nexpedited consideration of this motion, as well as oral argument before the Court. \nRespectfully submitted, \nDated: December 20, 2013 \n/s/ David A.

The opinions were publicly released in \nredacted form in 2014.  Op. 1 (Jan. 25, 2017).  No sealing or other discretionary orders were \nissued by the FISC to impede public access to the judicial opinions.  Op. 28 (Jan. 25, 2017). \nOn January 25, 2017, Presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer dismissed Movants' motion \nafter holding that they failed to establish constitutional standing sufficient to confer FISC \njurisdiction.  Order 1 (Jan. 25, 2017), available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/ \nfiles/Misc%2013-08%200pinion%20and%200rder_O.pdf.  A majority of FISC judges thereafter \nvoted in favor of en bane reconsideration and, after entertaining additional legal briefing from \nthe parties, the en bane court issued closely-divided majority and dissenting opinions on \nNovember 9, 2017. Ops. (Nov. 9, 2017), available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/ \nfiles/Misc%20l3-08%200pinion%20November%209%202017 .pdf (copies attached).  The \nmajority opinion, which was joined by six of the eleven FISC judges, held that Movants asserted \na sufficient injury-in-fact, vacated the January 25, 2017 decision, and remanded for further \nproceedings.  Majority Op. 18 (Nov. 9, 2017).  Ten of eleven FISC judges subsequently agreed \nthat the question of law should be certified to the FISCR pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § l 803(j) because \nreview by the FISCR would serve the interests of justice, a dispositive issue about standing was \ninvolved, and the split among the FISC Judges was very close and involved a difference of \nopinion about the law to apply, among other considerations. \n-2 -\n\nAccordingly, it hereby is ORDERED that the following question of law be certified to the \nFISCR:  Whether Movants have adequately established Article III standing to assert their claim \nof a qualified First Amendment right of public access to FISC judicial opinions. \n5~ \nSO ORDERED this  day of January, 2018. \nPresiding Judge, United States Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court \n- 3 -\n\nFiled \nUnJted StatH Foreign \nlntelllgonce Survem:mce Court \nNOV  0 9 2017 \nUNITED STATES \nFOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE C0tflfTFlynn Hall, Clerk of c urt \nWASHINGTON, D.C. \nIN RE OPINIONS & ORDERS OF THIS COURT \nADDRESSING BULK COLLECTION OF DATA  Docket No. Misc. 13-08 \nUNDER THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE \nSURVEILLANCE ACT. \nBOASBERG, J., writing for the Court and joined by JJ. SAYLOR, DEARIE, RUSSELL, JONES, and \nCONTRERAS: \nFiguring out whether a plaintiff has standing to bring a novel legal claim can feel a bit like \ntrying to distinguish a black cat in a coal cellar.  \"Although the two concepts unfortunately are \nblurred at times, standing and entitlement to relief are not the same thing. Standing is a prerequisite \nto filing suit, while the underlying merits of a claim ... determine whether the plaintiff is entitled \nto relief.\"  Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 794-95 (7th Cir. 2008).  The Initial Opinion in this \naction decided that Movants - the American Civil Liberties Union and Yale Law School's Media \nFreedom and Information Access Clinic - had suffered no injury-in-fact and thus lacked st~nding \nto bring their First Amendment claim for access to redacted portions of certain of this Court's \nopinions.  Sitting en bane for the first time in our history, we now vacate that decision.  Whatever \nthe merits ofMovants' suit, we conclude that they have asserted a sufficient injury-in-fact to pursue \nit. \n\nI.  Background \nBy necessity, this Court conducts much of its work in secrecy.  But it does so within a \njudicial system wedded to transparency and deeply rooted in the ideal that \"justice must satisfy the \nappearance of justice.\"  Levine v. United States, 362 U.S. 610, 616 (1960). \nIt comes as no surprise, then, that members of the public may at times seek to challenge \nwhether certain controversies merit our continued secrecy or, instead, require some degree of \ntransparency.  The matter before us was born from two such challenges.  On June 6, 2013, two \nnewspapers  released  certain classified information about  a surveillance  program run  by the \nGovernment since 2006.  Within a day, the Director of National Intelligence declassified further \ndetails about this bulk-data-collection program, acknowledging for the first time that this Court \nhad approved much of it under Section 215 -the \"business records\" provision-ofthe Patriot Act, \nu.s.c. \n50  § 1861. \nVery shortly thereafter, Movants filed a motion in this Court asking that we unseal our \n\"opinions evaluating the meaning, scope, and constitutionality of Section 215.\"  FISC No. Misc. \n13-02, Motion of June 2, 2013. They argued that, because officials had now \"revealed the essential \ndetails of the program,\" there was no  legitimate interest in continuing to  withhold its  legal \njustification.  Id. at 18.  Movants thus contended that their First Amendment right of access to \ncourt proceedings and documents, as recognized by the Supreme Court in Richmond Newspapers. \nInc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980), now compelled the release of these rulings.  Id. at 6-15. \nThey alternatively  asked  that we  invoke  FISC  Rule  of Procedure  62(a)  to  request that the \nGovernment review the opinions' classification and publish any declassified portions.  Id. at 15-\n18. \n-2-\n\nJudge Saylor opted for the latter discretionary route in this first action.  In re Orders of this \nCourt Interpreting Sec. 215 of the Patriot Act, No. Misc. 13-02, 2013 WL 5460064 (Foreign Intel. \nSurv. Ct.  Sept.  13, 2013).  Before doing so, however, he concluded that Movant ACLU had \nestablished Article III standing to pursue its First Amendment challenge, as its asserted injury \nsatisfied the familiar tripartite standing requirement - i.e., it was \"concrete, particularized, and \nactual or imminent;  fairly traceable to  the challenged action;  and redressable by a favorable \nruling.\"  Id. at *2 (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013)).  More \nspecifically, he reasoned that, because the ACLU had alleged that the continued withholding of \nour opinions violated its First Amendment right of access to them, its claimed injury was  I) \n\"actual,\" as the opinions were not available, 2) \"traceable\" to the Government's decision not to \nmake them public, and 3) redressable by \"this Court's directing that those opinions be published.\" \nId.  Judge Saylor also determined that the injury was sufficiently particularized because Movants \nwere \"active particip[ ants] in the legislativ,e and public debates about the proper scope of Section \n215,\" and the withheld information would assist them in these conversations. Id. at *4. Ultimately, \nhowever, he did not reach the merits of their First Amendment claim, choosing instead to order \nthe Executive Branch under Rule 62( a) to conduct a declassification review of certain of our prior \nopinions.  Id. at *8. \nAround  the  same  time,  the  Government  released  more  details  about  the  bulk-data \ncollection program, including a white paper that explained how FISC Judges had periodically \napproved the directives to telecommunications providers to produce bulk telephonic metadata for \nuse  in  the  Government's  counterterrorism  efforts.  See  Administration  White  Paper:  Bulk \nCollection of Telephony Metadata Under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act (Aug. 9, 2013). \nThis Court, too, took steps to make more information available to the public.  In particular, we \n- 3 -\n\nasked the Executive Branch to review several of our opinions, and we released redacted versions \nof two about the collection of bulk telephony metadata under Section 215. In re Opinions & Orders \nof this Court Addressing Bulk Collection of Data under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nNo. Misc. 13-08, 2017 WL 427591, at *2-3 (FISC Jan. 25, 2017). \nWhile these revelations may have slaked some ofMovants' thirst for information, they also \nopened up new lines of inquiry.  Movants thus filed another motion - which kicked off the current \naction - on November 7, 2013, asking us to unseal classified sections of our opinions laying out \nthe legal basis for the data collection.  See Movants'  Motion of Nov. 7, 2013, available at \nhttp://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Misc%2013-08%20Motion-2. pdf.  Here,  again, \nthey claimed that these passages were \"subject to the public's First Amendment right of access\" \nand should be released because \"no proper basis exists to keep the legal discussions in [them] \nsecret.\"  Id. at 1.  They further contended that we should once more exercise our discretion under \nRule 62(a) to ask for a second classification review by the Government and then verify ~hat its \nresponse complied with the dictates of the First Amendment.  Id. at 24-27. \nOn  November  18,  2013,  however,  while  briefing  was  ongoing  on  this  issue,  the \nGovernment published two more redacted opinions by this Court.  In re Opinions & Orders of this \nCourt Addressing Bulk Collection of Data under FISA, 2017 WL 427591, at *3.  Including the \nprevious pair we had already released, these four opinions constituted all of our rulings that were \nresponsive to Movants' second Motion.  In other words, before the Government had even filed an \nOpposition, the relevant opinions had been \"subjected to classification review and the unclassified \nportions released\" with - according to the Government - \"as much information ... as possible \nconsistent with national security.\"  Opp. of Dec. 6, 2013, at 2. \n-4-\n\nGiven such release, the Government's subsequent Opposition argued that the Court should \nnow dismiss Movants' second action.  Any further review, it maintained, would merely \"duplicate \nthe[se] result[s],\" and there was \"no basis for th[is] Court to order [it].\" Id.  The Government also \ncontended that Movants lacked standing to seek such relief because Rule 62(a) allowed only a \nparty to the proceeding that generated the opinion to move for publication, and Movants had not \nbeen involved in the underlying actions.  Id. at 2-3.  Finally, the Government urged this Court not \nto order yet another review since Movants could challenge the classification decisions through a \nFreedom of Information Act case in federal district court.  Id. at 3-4. \nOn January 25, 2017,  in a  lengthy and thoughtful  Opinion,  Presiding Judge  Collyer \ndetermined that Movants had no standing to press their case, and she thus dismissed it.  See In re \nOpinions & Orders of this Court Addressing Bulk Collection of Data under FISA, 2017 WL \n* \n427 591, at  1.  Her Opinion focused in particular on a potential standing problem that the parties \nhad not previously identified - namely, whether Movants had alleged the invasion of a \"legally \nand judicially cognizable\" interest sufficient to establish the injury-in-fact prong of the standing \nanalysis.  Id. at *7.  The Court first took the position that an interest was not legally protected \n\"when its asserted legal source - whether constitutional, statutory, common law or otherwise -\ndoes not apply or does not exist.\"  Id. at *8. \nOn this basis, the Court then engaged in a lengthy merits analysis ofMovants' claim under \nthe  Richmond  Newspapers  \"experience  and  logic\"  test  to  determine  whether  such  a  First \n* \nAmendment right existed in the unique context of FISC judicial proceedings.  Id.  at  16-21. \nAlthough the Constitution does not expressly provide for access to judicial records, in Richmond \nNewspapers, the Supreme Court \"firmly established for the first time that the press and general \npublic have a constitutional right of access to criminal trials.\"  Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior \n- 5 -\n\nCourt, 457 U.S. 596, 603 (1982).  Since then, it has extended this right to other judicial processes, \nbut has also recognized that such a First Amendment right of access is not absolute.  Id. at 607. \nRather, to determine whether the public has a right of access to particular judicial proceedings, \ncourts must ask two questions: \"whether the place and process have historically been open to the \npress and general public\" (the experience inquiry) and \"whether public access plays a significant \npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question\" (the logic inquiry).  Press \nEnterprise Co. v. Superior Court (Press Enterprise II), 478 U.S. 1, 8 (1986).  Applying this test, \nJudge Collyer in this case ultimately answered both prongs in the negative, and she therefore \nconcluded that the right of access did not extend to FISC judicial proceedings.  In re Opinions & \nOrders of this Court Addressing Bulk Collection of Data under FISA, 2017 WL 427591, at *16-\n21.  For this reason alone, the Court then held that Movants had not alleged a sufficient injury-in \nfact and thus lacked standing to bring their claim.  Id. at *21. \nMovants quickly moved for reconsideration.  As the resolution of the first and second \nactions had created an intra-court split on the standing issue, we sua sponte granted en bane review \nto reconsider the narrow question of whether Movants have asserted a sufficient injury-in-fact for \nstanding purposes.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1803(a)(2)(A); FISC R. P. 45 (allowing the Court to order a \nhearing or rehearing en  bane if \"necessary to secure and maintain uniformity of the Court's \ndecisions\").  After substantial and reasoned debate and discussion among all eleven judges of this \nCourt, we now answer that inquiry in the affirmative. \nII.  Analysis \nArticle III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to actual \"Cases\" and \n\"Controversies.\" U.S. Const., art. III,§ 2.  But not just any dispute will do.  See Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559-61 (1992). The Constitution instead confines the judiciary to deciding \n-6-\n\ncontests that are \"appropriately resolved through the judicial process,\" as distinguished from those \nbetter left to the legislative or executive branches in a democratic government.  Id. at 560 (quoting \nWhitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990)).  Standing doctrine helps police this boundary \nby requiring, as an \"irreducible constitutional minimum,\" that a plaintiff establish three elements \nto proceed with a claim: 1) an injury-in-fact that is 2) caused by the conduct complained of and 3) \n\"likely\" to be \"redressed by a favorable decision.\"  Id. at 560-61 (quotations omitted). \nThe focus here is on the first prong.  A term of art, an injury-in-fact is the \"invasion of a \nlegally protected interest which is both (a) concrete and particularized; and (b) actual or imminent, \nnot conjectural, or hypothetical.\"  Id. at 560 (footnote, internal citations, and quotation omitted). \nFor the purposes of evaluating whether a plaintiff has made this showing, though, \"we must assume \n[Movants'] claim has legal validity.\"  Cooksey v.  Futrell, 721  F.3d 226, 239 (4th Cir. 2013) \n(quotation omitted).  Put another way, in deciding whether Movants have alleged a sufficient \ninjury-in-fact for standing purposes, we \"must be careful not to decide the question on the merits \nfor or against [Movants], and must therefore assume that on the merits the [Movants] would be \nsuccessful in their claims.\"  City of Waukesha v. EPA, 320 F.3d 228, 235 (D.C. Cir. 2003); see \nalso Citizen Ctr. v.  Gessler, 770 F.3d 900, 910 (10th Cir. 2014) (same); Parker v.  District of \nColumbia, 478 F.3d 370, 377 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\"The Supreme Court has made clear that when \nconsidering whether a plaintiff has Article III standing, a federal court must assume arguendo the \nmerits of his or her legal claim.\"), affd sub nom. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 \n(2008); see also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501-02 (1975) (assuming validity of legal theory \nfor purposes of standing analysis). \nStarting from the premise that Movants' claim is meritorious means that we must assume \nthat withholding our classified opinions violates their First Amendment right of access to judicial \n-7-\n\nproceedings under the Richmond Newspapers test.  From this base, we can readily conclude that \nthis injury is \"concrete,\" as well as \"actual,\" because the opinions are currently not available to \nthem.  For  at  least  the  reasons  articulated  by  Judge  Saylor,  moreover,  it  is  sufficiently \n\"particularized\" from  that of the public because of Movants' active participation in ongoing \ndebates about the legal validity of the bulk-data-collection program. \nThe Initial Opinion, of course, did not quibble with these conclusions, but instead homed \nin on the prefatory language of the definition of what constitutes an injury-in-fact. While not every \nSupreme Court decision even specifies that an alleged injury-in-fact must be to a \"legally protected \ninterest,\" see. e.g., Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409, the Opinion correctly pointed out that some cases \nhave treated this as an independent requirement to establish standing in appropriate circumstances. \nBut from this starting point, the Initial Opinion faltered in concluding that Movants had alleged no \nlegally protected interest because the First Amendment's right of access to court proceedings \"did \nnot apply\" to FISC Opinions.  In re Opinions & Orders of this Court Addressing Bulk Collection \nof Data under FISA, 2017 WL 427591, at *21. \nAs courts have repeatedly affirmed, \"For purposes of standing, the question [simply] \ncannot be whether the Constitution, properly interpreted, extends protection to the plaintiffs \nasserted right or interest.\"  Initiative & Referendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 F.3d 1082, 1092 (10th \nCir.  2006) (en  bane) (emphasis added).  \"If that were the test, every losing claim would be \ndismissed for want of standing.\" Id.; see also Ass'n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs .. Inc. v. Camp, \n397 U.S. 150, 153 & n.1 (2003) (admonishing against use of\"legal interest\" test as part of standing \nanalysis when it goes to merits of claim).  We must instead assume that Movants are correct that \nthey have a constitutional right of access, Waukesha, 320 F.3d at 235 - so long as that right is \ncognizable.  That is, we ask only whether courts are capable of knowing or recognizing such an \n- 8 -\n\ninterest. See Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"cognizable\" as \"[c  ]apable of being \nknown or recognized\"); see also Judicial Watch. Inc. v. U.S. Senate, 432 F.3d 359, 364 (D.C. Cir. \n2005) (Williams, J ., concurring) (explaining Supreme Court uses terms \"legally protected\" and \n\"judicially  cognizable\"  interchangeably  \"( 1)  to  encompass  the  other  conventionally  stated \nrequirements (that the injury be concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent) and (2) \npossibly to serve as a screen (perhaps open-ended) against interests that it would make little sense \nto treat as adequate\"). \nA plaintiff, for instance, might lack standing \"to complain about his inability to commit \ncrimes because no one has a right to a commit a crime,\" and no Court could recognize such an \ninterest.  Citizen Ctr. v. Gessler, 770 F.3d 900, 910 (10th Cir. 2014).  On the other hand, he would \nhave standing to bring colorable First Amendment claims, even if he would ultimately lose on the \nmerits.  Take the seminal example of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976).  There, the Supreme \nCourt allowed plaintiffs to attack campaign-finance laws as unconstitutional, even though, as it \nturned  out,  there  is  no  specific  \"First  Amendment  right  to  make  unlimited  campaign \ncontributions.\"  Initiative & Referendum Inst., 450 F.3d at 1092-93 (citing Buckley, 424 U.S. at \n96).  As the Tenth Circuit noted, \"We could use any unsuccessful constitutional claim to illustrate \nthe point.\"  Id. at 1092.  Indeed, were we to define rights with any greater level of specificity, no \nplaintiff would have standing to challenge established First Amendment precedent.  This  is \ncertainly not the case.  See. e.g., Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310,. 365-66 (2010) (overturning \nprecedent that upheld restrictions on corporate independent expenditures). \nAt bottom, the legally-protected-interest test is not concerned with determining the proper \nscope of the First Amendment right or whether a plaintiff is correct that such right has in fact been \ninvaded; that is a merits inquiry. Waukesha, 320 F.3d at 235. The test instead seeks only to assess \n-9-\n\nwhether the interest asserted by the plaintiff is of the type that \"deserve[s] protection against \ninjury.\"  13  Charles  Alan  Wright,  Arthur R.  Miller,  et  al.,  Federal  Practice  &  Procedure \n§ 3531.4 (3d ed. 2008). \nAgainst this backdrop, the sufficiency of Movants' allegation of such a legally protected \ninterest appears clear.  They identify the invasion of an interest - the First Amendment right to \naccess judicial proceedings - that courts have repeatedly held is capable of \"being known or \nrecognized.\"  The Supreme Court first acknowledged that this interest is one the Constitution \nprotects against wrongful invasion in Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. 555, when a plurality held \nthat  the  public's  \"right  to  attend  criminal  trials  is  implicit  in  the  guarantees  of the  First \nAmendment.\"  Id. at 580 (footnote omitted).  Since then, that Court has also held that this right \nsafeguards  the  public's  qualified  access  to  other  criminal  proceedings,  including  witness \ntestimony, Globe Newspaper, 457 U.S. at 603-11, voir dire, Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court \n(Press Enterprise I), 464 U.S. 501, 505-10 (1984), and preliminary hearings.  Press Enterprise II, \n478 U.S. at 10-15. \nMany federal Courts of Appeals have likewise held this legally protected interest invaded \nwhen the public is walled off from other aspects of criminal trials, such as bail, plea, or sentencing \nhearings.  See. e.g., N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 297-98 (2d \nCir. 2012) (collecting cases); In re Wash. Post Co., 807 F.2d 383, 388-89 (4th Cir. 1986) (plea and \nsentencing hearings);  In re  Hearst Newspapers.  LLC,  641  F.3d  168,  175-86 (5th Cir.  2011) \n(sentencing). Finally, at least six Circuits have concluded that the First Amendment qualified right \nof access also extends to \"civil trials and to their related proceedings and records.\"  N.Y. Civil \nLiberties Union, 684 F.3d at 298 (emphasis added) (so holding and collecting cases from the Third, \nFourth, Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits). \n- 10 -\n\nThese cases all demonstrate that Movants, in asserting a First Amendment right of access \nto judicial processes, are seeking to vindicate \"the sort of interest that the law protects when it is \nwrongfully invaded.\" Aurora Loan Servs .. Inc. v. Craddieth, 442 F.3d 1018, 1024 (7th Cir. 2006) \n(emphases modified).  No more than this is necessary for standing purposes, even if Movants \nultimately fail to prove that the precise scope of the First Amendment right extends to redacted \nportions of our judicial opinions under the Richmond Newspapers test.  The dissent, by contrast, \nwould require Plaintiffs to make that more specific showing at the standing stage - an inquiry that \nwould swallow any merits determination on the First Amendment's contours.  It is erroneous to \nunderstand the cognizable-interest requirement as \"beg[ging] the question of the legal validity of \nthe[ir] claim.\"  Initiative & Referendum Inst., 450 F.3d at 1093 n.3.  Rather, as the Tenth Circuit \nsitting en bane has instructed, courts must avoid any such \"mischief' inherent in \"us[ing] standing \nconcepts to address the question whether the plaintiff has stated a claim.\" Id. (quoting 13 Wright \n& Miller, § 3531.4 (2d ed. Supp. 2005)). \nOur  conclusion  that  Movants  have  met  this  cognizable-interest  requirement  is  also \nconsistent with the approach adopted by every Circuit to consider a similar claim.  As far as we \ncan tell, courts have uniformly found standing to bring a First Amendment right-of-access suit so \nlong as plaintiffs allege an invasion related to judicial proceedings. That is so no matter how novel \nor meritless the claim may be.  Some courts have stretched the right-of-access even farther for \nstanding purposes.  In Flynt v. Rumsfeld, 355 F.3d 697 (D.C. Cir. 2004), for example, journalists \ncreatively contended that they had a First Amendment right of access to travel with military \ncombat units to cover the war in Afghanistan.  Id. at 698.  Although the D.C. Circuit ultimately \nheld that \"no such constitutional right exists\" - in fact, having deemed Richmond Newspapers \nentirely inapplicable - it nevertheless easily concluded that plaintiffs had standing to bring their \n- 11 -\n\nsuit. Id. at 698, 702-04. This was the case even though the journalists' desire to embed with troops \nwas much farther afield from the core Richmond Newspapers right than the one Movants hope to \nestablish today.  Here, they ask only to extend the public's right of access to another Article III \ncontext - i.e., FISC judicial proceedings. \nThe dissent criticizes the Court of Appeals' analysis in flym, see post at 20, but its dislike \nof the decision does not diminish its import.  In any event, the D.C. Circuit does not stand alone \nin its approach.  The Seventh Circuit, for example, has considered a historian's standing to bring \na common-law right-of-access claim to sealed grand-jury materials.  See Carlson v. United States, \n837 F.3d 753, 757-61 (7th Cir. 2016). The plaintiff, it reasoned, \"need[ed] only a 'colorable claim' \nto a right to access these documents, because '[w]ere we to require more than a colorable claim, \nwe would decide the merits of the case before satisfying ourselves of standing.\"'  Id.  at 758 \n(internal citation omitted); see also Okla. Observer v. Patton, 73 F. Supp. 3d 1318, 1321-22, 1325 \n(W.D. Okla. 2014) (holding plaintiffs had standing to bring First Amendment right-of-access claim \nto view executions, but dismissing suit as right did \"not extend to the circumstances existing \nhere\"); United States v. Ring, 47 F. Supp. 3d 38, 41-42 (D.D.C. 2014) (holding criminal defendant \nhad standing to  sue for public access to PowerPoint presentation used during proffer session \ndespite holding on merits that \"neither a common law nor First Amendment right of access\" \nattached to the record). \nMany courts - including the Supreme Court - have not even felt it necessary to address \nstanding in dealing with tenuous right-of-access claims, despite judges' obligation to raise sua \nsponte any jurisdictional defects.  Indeed, courts have routinely ignored what the dissent would \nbelieve is a serious question, even while expressly addressing their jurisdiction in other respects. \nFor example, the Fourth and Sixth Circuits rejected mootness challenges to suits asserting a First \n- 12 -\n\nAmendment right of access to search-warrant proceedings, despite ultimately deciding that the \nplaintiffs had no such right to these sealed records under the Richmond Newspapers test.  See In \nre Search of Fair Finance, 692 F.3d 424, 428-29, 433 (6th Cir. 2012) (finding claim not moot); \nBait. Sun Co. v. Goetz, 886 F.2d 60, 63-65 (4th Cir. 1989) (same).  Mootness, of course, shares a \ncommon undergirding with standing: \"[T]he requisite personal interest that must exist at the \ncommencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness).\" \nFriends of the Earth. Inc. v.  Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC). Inc., 528 U.S.  167,  189 \n(2000) (quoting Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 68 n.22 (1997)).  To \nsurvive a mootness challenge, then, the plaintiffs must have necessarily demonstrated that the \nrequisite personal injury existed at least in the first instance.  Even more recently, in Phillips v. \nDeWine, 841F.3d405 (6th Cir. 2016), the Sixth Circuit rejected a much more farfetched challenge \nby inmates to the constitutionality of Ohio's \"statutory scheme concerning the confidentiality of \ninformation related to lethal injection.\" Id. at 410, 419-20.  At the outset, the court concluded that \nthe plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their free-speech and prior-restraint causes of action, as their \nasserted injuries were too hypothetical.  But it apparently had no similar concern as to their First \nAmendment right-of-access claim, holding instead on the merits that no such right existed.  Id. at \n417-20. \nA long list of courts have acted in this fashion.  See. e.g., Houchins v. KQED, Inc., 438 \nU.S. 1, 7-15 (1978) (holding First Amendment provides the media no right of access to county jail, \nbut never questioning standing); Dhiab v. Trump, 852 F.3d 1087, 1096 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (holding \nplaintiffs have no \"right under the First Amendment to receive properly classified national security \ninformation filed\" in habeas action, but not questioning standing); Wood v. Ryan, 759 F.3d 1076, \n1088 (9th Cir. 2014) (Bybee, J. , dissenting) (criticizing \"majority's newfound right of access\" for \n- 13 -\n\ndeath row inmate seeking information on method of his execution as \"dramatic extension of \nanything\" previously recognized, but never questioning standing), vacated, 135 S. Ct. 21 (mem.) \n(summarily vacated on merits, not standing); In re U.S. for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section \n2703(0),  707  F.3d 283,  291-92  (4th  Cir.  2013)  (holding no  First Amendment right under \nRichmond Newspapers to court orders and proceedings pursuant to Stored Communications Act, \nbut never questioning standing); In re N. Y. Times Co. to Unseal Wiretap, 577 F .3d 40 I, 409-11 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (rejecting, under Richmond Newspapers, newspaper's request to unseal wiretap \napplications and related materials, but not questioning standing to bring novel claim); Calder v. \nIRS, 890 F.2d 781, 783-84 (5th Cir. 1989) (applying Richmond Newspapers and holding plaintiff \nhad no  First Amendment or statutory right of access to  IRS  records, but never questioning \nstanding).  Although we do not directly rely on any of these cases, we find the uniformity is telling. \nSimilarly, two former judges of this Court also found it unnecessary to call standing into \ndoubt when rejecting claims premised on the public's right of access to FISC records, see In re \nProceedings Required by §  702(i) of PISA Amendments Act of 2008, No.  08-01, 2008 WL \n9487946 (FISC Aug. 27, 2008) (McLaughlin, J.); In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 \nF. Supp. 2d 484 (FISC 2007) (Bates, J.), and, as explained above, Judge Saylor expressly held that \nplaintiffs did have standing to bring such claims under the First Amendment in Movants' first \naction.  See In re Orders of this Court Intemreting Section 215 of the Patriot Act, No. 13-02, 2013 \nWL 5460064, at *2-4 (FISC Sept. 13, 2013). \nThe Initial Opinion, by contrast, relies on no case that concludes that a plaintiff lacks a \nlegally cognizable interest, and thus standing, simply because that party cannot show a First \nAmendment right of access applies or exists in the context of the judicial proceeding at issue.  The \nbest it could muster is a single case where the plaintiff sought a common-law right of access to \n- 14 -\n\ndiscovery materials.  Bond v. Utreras, 585 F.3d 1061, 1074 (7th Cir. 2009).  The Seventh Circuit \nheld that these discovery files - exchanged between parties - \"had never been filed with the court \nand [had] never influenced the outcome of a judicial proceeding.\" Id.  Whatever the merits of that \ndecision, it provides no guidance here, where Plaintiffs seek material far more rooted in judicial \nproceedings: our opinions.  Perhaps recognizing Bond as thin support, the dissent relegates that \ncase to a footnote.  Otherwise, no case appears throughout its 25 pages in which any court declined \nto find standing in like circumstances.  This lack of precedential support speaks volumes. \nAt times, the dissent suggests a variant justification for dismissing the suit: it sees \"no legal \nbasis to find that Movants present a colorable claim.\"  Post at 13 (emphasis added); see also id. at \n17 n.16 (\"In the instant matter, the question is whether Movants have a colorable right under the \nFirst Amendment to access information in FISC opinions that the Executive Branch determined \nwas classified.\"). This alternative argument seems decidedly weaker to us. Courts have repeatedly \nset an exceedingly low bar to establish colorability.  See Kennedy v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 924 \nF .2d 698, 700 (7th Cir. 1991) (holding only if claim is \"frivolous is jurisdiction lacking\"); Panaras \nv. Liguid Carbonic Indus. Cor_p., 74 F.3d 786, 790 (7th Cir. 1996) (describing the requirement as \n\"not ... stringent\").  Under this colorability standard, only \"a plaintiff whose claimed legal right \nis so preposterous as to be legally frivolous may lack standing on the ground that the right is not \n'legally protected.\"'  Initiative & Referendum Inst., 450 F.3d at 1093.  Whatever the merits of \nMovants' First Amendment right-of-access claim, it finds its basis in well-established law.  The \nright to access, even in its more narrow formulation, at least covers \"a right of access to certain \ncriminal [and civil] proceedings and the documents filed in those proceedings.\" Phillips, 841 F.3d \nat 418.  Movants merely allege that those \"certain\" documents include our FISC opinions - i.e., \nopinions filed in an Article III judicial proceeding.  This asserted right is certainly more analogous \n- 15 -\n\nto the historical right than - for example - a claim that the First Amendment also grants access to \ntravel with troop battalions on a foreign battlefield.  Yet, in flmt, 355 F.3d 697, the D.C. Circuit \nnever mentioned that it might be frivolous to consider such an extension. In fact, the dissent points \nto no federal court that has ever dismissed as frivolous a novel claim seeking to extend the First \nAmendment right of access to a new judicial process.  We decline to be the first. \nThe dissent also suggests our analysis should differ because Plaintiffs seek \"classified \ninformation.\"  Post at 24 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It is true that courts rarely presume \nto review the Executive Branch's decisionmaking, at least without a statutory hook.  See Dep't of \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 538 (1988).  Yet the classified information here is not housed in the \nExecutive Branch; instead, it arises within an Article III proceeding, and Plaintiffs seek access to \nportions of judicial opinions.  As explained above, the right to access judicial proceedings is well \nestablished.  Courts have thus not hesitated to review claims involving secret court proceedings, \neven when they ultimately find good reason to deny them.  See In re Search of Fair Finance, 692 \nF.3d at 428-29, 433 (sealed search warrants); Goetz, 886 F.2d at 63-65 (same); In re N.Y. Times \nCo. to Unseal Wiretap, 577 F.3d at 409-11 (sealed wiretap applications). \nNor do we agree with the dissent that we should change our conclusion simply because we \nconsider a constitutional challenge involving the Executive Branch.  See post at 23-25.  Even if \nthe Supreme Court applies an \"especially rigorous\" standing analysis in this context, Raines v. \nByrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819-20 ( 1997), it has never suggested such an analysis would involve jumping \nto the merits of the dispute.  More to the point, the dissent cites Clapper v. Amnesty International, \n568 U.S. 398 (2013), which noted that courts have declined to find standing when reviewing \n\"actions of the political branches in the fields of intelligence gathering and foreign affairs.\"  Post \n- 16 -\n\nat 23-24 (quoting Clapper, 568 U.S. at 469).  Although that decision admittedly contains some \nbroad language, none offers much insight into the standing question posed here. \nIn Clapper, the Supreme Court considered a separate facet of the injury-in-fact test -\nnamely,  whether the  plaintiffs'  theory of future  injury was  too  speculative  to  be \"certainly \nimpending.\"  Id. at 409.  In fact, Clapper's definition of what constitutes an injury-in-fact did not \neven include the requirement of a \"legally protected\" interest upon which the Initial Opinion relies \nhere.  Id. at 409 (\"To establish Article III standing, an injury must be 'concrete, particularized, and \nactual or imminent;  fairly traceable to the challenged action;  and redressable by a favorable \nruling.\"') (citation omitted).  Clapper, then, does not impose any special standing requirement on \nthis score; in fact, it might be better read to impose no such showing at all.  Schuchardt v. President \nof the United States, 839 F.3d 336, 348 n.8 (3d Cir. 2016) (\"Despite Clapper's observation that \nthe standing inquiry is especially rigorous in matters touching on intelligence gathering and foreign \naffairs,\" no court has held that \"'Article III imposes [a] heightened standing requirement for the \noften  difficult  cases  that  involve  constitutional  claims  against  the  executive  involving \nsurveillance.\"') (quoting Jewel v. NSA, 673 F.3d 902, 913 (9th Cir. 2011)) (internal quotations \nfrom Clapper omitted)).  In any event, the claim presented here survives because the injury is a \nlack of access to the proceedings of a court, rather than one directly traceable to the activities of \nthe political branches in intelligence gathering or foreign affairs. \n* * * \nAt the end of the day, the question that the Initial Opinion asked and answered is not one \nof standing.  It instead goes to the merits of Movants' legal claim - i.e., whether they have a \nqualified right of access under the First Amendment to portions of our opinions redacted by the \nExecutive Branch under its classification authority.  See Arreola, 546 F.3d at 794-95 (\"Although \n- 17 -\n\nthe two concepts unfortunately are blurred at times, standing and entitlement to relief are not the \nsame thing.\").  As that is not what concerns us today, we hold that Movants have sufficiently \nalleged the invasion of a legally cognizable interest as necessary to establish an injury-in-fact. \nWhether or not they will ultimately succeed in establishing that the  Richmond Newspapers \nexperience-and-logic test entitles them to relief, we believe that they should not be barred at this \nthreshold  procedural  stage.  We  further  offer  no  opinion  on  whether  other jurisdictional \nimpediments exist to this challenge, but hold only that Movants have established a sufficient \ninjury-in-fact. \nIII.  Conclusion \nBecause we hold that Movants have the requisite cognizable interest to  pursue their \nconstitutional claim, we vacate the Initial Opinion in this action and remand the matter to Judge \nCollyer for further consideration of Movants' Motion. \n- 18 -\n\nCOLLYER, Presiding Judge, joined by EAGAN, MOSMAN, CONWAY and KUGLER, Judges, \ndissenting: \nIn law as in life, the answer depends upon the question.  Only by framing the question \nbefore us in its most general terms can the Majority answer with the unremarkable proposition \nthat some courts - but not the Supreme Court - have found a First Amendment right of access to \nsome federal court proceedings in civil cases when the place and process historically have been \npublic.  But the question the Majority poses is not the one presented by the motion in this case.  I \nrespectfully dissent and would affirm the decision in In re Opinions & Orders of this Court \nAddressing Bulk Collection of Data Under the FISA [hereinafter In re Opinions of This Court], \nNo. Misc. 13-08, 2017 WL 427591 (FISA Ct. 2017). \nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") is a special court with a special and \ndiscreet mission: to protect the rights of U.S. persons while reviewing surveillance measures to \nprotect national security.  FISC proceedings are classified and the Court operates under specific \ncongressional direction that everything it does must respect and protect the secrecy of those \nclassifications.  No member of the public would have any \"right\" under the First Amendment to \nask to observe a hearing in the FISC courtroom.  Still less should we be inventing such a \"right\" \nin the present circumstances. \nTo be precise, what Movants seek is not \"access to judicial proceedings,\" as the Majority \nwould have it.  Rather, their current request is more limited and specific: having already received \nthis Court's opinions and orders addressing bulk collection of data with classified material \nredacted, Movants want us to rule that they have a \"right\" of access to the information classified \nby the Executive Branch and that Executive Branch agencies must defend each redaction in the \nface of Movants' challenges. \n- 1 -\n\nThe effect of the Court's decision today is to displace Congress's judgment that access to \nclassified and ex parte FISC judicial opinions shall be resolved through the procedures set forth \nin Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act, which, as relevantly titled, governs the \n\"[d ]eclassification of significant decisions, orders, and opinions\" of the FISC.  Just as in the days \nof John Marshall, it is imperative that the Judiciary avoid the appearance of eroding the very \nprinciples intended to maintain the careful balance of powers set forth in the Constitution. 1 The \nCourt's decision today unfortunately fails in that effort. \nOne last introductory comment is due.  FISC judges come from district courts around the \ncountry.  Few of us knew each other before our appointments to the FISC.  In our work on the \nFISC, as with our work in our home courts, we decide alone.  The occasion of this en bane \nreview of the In re Opinions of This Court decision has given us a rare and wonderful \nopportunity to wrestle together over some weighty legal principles and issues. This dissent is \nwritten in the same spirit. \nI. \nThe question pending before the en bane Court is whether Movants have shown an injury \nin fact sufficient to establish constitutional standing and this Court's jurisdiction.  There is no \ndispute between the parties or the members of the Court that Article III of the Constitution limits \nthe judicial power to the adjudication of cases or controversies in which a party seeking relief \ndemonstrates standing for each asserted claim.  There likewise is no dispute that the prevailing \n\"Much more than legal niceties are at stake here. The statutory and (especially) \nconstitutional elements of jurisdiction are an essential ingredient of separation and equilibration \nof powers, restraining the courts from acting at certain times, and even restraining them from \nacting permanently regarding certain subjects.\"  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. \n83, 101 (1998). \n-2-\n\nlegal standard is set forth in Lui an v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992), and requires \nthat Movants \"must have suffered an injury in fact-an invasion of a legally protected interest \nwhich is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or \nhypothetical.\"  Id. at 560 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nThe Supreme Court has never abandoned the requirement of a \"legally protected interest\" \nfor the purpose of establishing Article III standing.2  See Spokeo. Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, \n1548 (2016) (confirming that \"a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered an 'invasion of a \nlegally protected interest\"' (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560)); Ariz. State Legislature v. Ariz. \nlndep. Redistricting Comm'n, 135 S. Ct. 2652, 2663 (2015) (same); United States v. Windsor. \n133 S. Ct. 2675, 2685 (2013) (same).  Furthermore, the Supreme Court has signaled that the \nphrase \"legally protected interest\" has meaning independent of the requirement that the alleged \ninvasion be concrete and particularized as well as actual or imminent.  Adarand Constructors. \nInc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 211 (1995) (stating \"Adarand's claim that the Government's use of \nsubcontractor compensation clauses denies it equal protection of the laws of course alleges an \ninvasion of a legally protected interest, and it does so in a manner that is 'particularized' as to \nAdarand\" (emphasis added)). \nTo determine whether Movants asserted a legally protected interest, \"we do not consider \nthe merits in connection with standing, [but] we do consider whether the plaintiffs have a legal \nright to do what is allegedly being impeded.\" Citizen Ctr. v. Gessler, 770 F.3d 900, 910 (10th \n2  Even when the Supreme Court used the phrase \"cognizable interests\" for the purpose of \nevaluating standing it \"stressed\" that the injury must be both \"legally and judicially cognizable.\" \nRaines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819 (1997) (emphasis added).  Movants agree that \"[t]he injury \nalleged must also be one that is 'legally and judicially cognizable.\"' Movants' En Banc Opening \nBr. 6, available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Misc%2013-\n08%20Movants%27%20En%20 Banc%200pening%20Brief.pdf. \n- 3 -\n\nCir. 2014).  In other words, we consider whether there is some law that at least arguably could be \ndeemed to protect Movants' legal interest such that they can be said to have advanced a colorable \nclaim to the asserted right.  Aurora Loan Servs .. Inc. v. Craddieth, 442 F.3d 1018, 1024 (7th Cir. \n2006).  As the Seventh Circuit has explained: \nThe point is not that to establish standing a plaintiff must establish that a right of \nhis has been infringed; that would conflate the issue of standing with the merits of \nthe suit. It is that he must have a colorable claim to such a right. It is not enough \nthat he claims to have been injured by the defendant's conduct. \"The alleged injury \nmust be legally and judicially cognizable. This requires, among other things, that \nthe plaintiff have suffered 'an invasion of a legally protected interest.\"' \nId. (quoting Raines, supra note 2, at 819 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560)).  To be clear, \"[w]hile \nstanding does not depend on the merits of the party's contention that certain conduct is illegal, \nstanding does require an injury to the party arising out of a violation of a constitutional or \n· statutory provision or other legal right.\"  Fed. Deposit Ins. Cor.p. v. Grella, 553 F.2d 258, 261 (2d \nCir. 1977).  Accord Cox Cable Commc'ns. Inc. v. United States, 992 F.2d 1178, 1182 (11th Cir. \n1993) (\"No legally cognizable injury arises unless an interest is protected by statute or \notherwise.\").  \"The interest must consist of obtaining compensation for, or preventing, the \nviolation of a legally protected right.\"  Vermont Agency of Natural Res. v. U.S. ex rel. Stevens, \n529 U.S. 765, 772 (2000). \nII. \nA. \nApplying these legal standards, the Supreme Court has directed that \"[a]lthough standing \nin no way depends on the merits of the plaintiffs contention that particular conduct is illegal, it \noften turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted.\"  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500 \n(1975).  Indeed, the Supreme Court has agreed unanimously that \"standing is gauged by the \nspecific common-law, statutory or constitutional claims that a party presents.\"  Int'l Primate Prot. \n-4-\n\nLeague v. Adm'rs of Tulane Educ. Fund, 500 U.S. 72, 77 (1991).  \"Typically ... the standing \ninquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint's allegations to ascertain whether the \nparticular plaintiff is entitled to adjudication oft he particular claims asserted.\"'  Id. (internal \nquotation marks omitted, emphasis in original). \nAccordingly, to determine whether Movants have a legally protected interest the first step \nis to examine the specific constitutional claims Movants present.  Id.  Movants assert a First \nAmendment-protected interest to access information in certain FISC judicial opinions that the \nExecutive Branch determined is classified national security information.  Movants further assert \na First Amendment-protected interest to require the Executive Branch to explain its rationale for \nclassification and respond to Movants' challenges to their constitutionality, and for the FISC to \ndecide between them.3  Movants' Mot. 1, 24.  They invoke no other source of right for their \nclaims. \nThe Majority Opinion strays from Movants' \"particular claims\" and recasts their legal \ninterest as broadly as possible into \"access to judicial proceedings,\" Majority Op. 10.  By doing \nso, the Majority scrambles the scope of an interest recognized under the qualified First \nAmendment right of public access and the scope of an interest recognized under the common law \n3  Specifically, Movants seek access to classified information that was redacted from four \nFISC judicial opinions that were declassified, in part, and made public in 2013.  Now that the \nopinions are public, Movants ask the Court to compel the Executive Branch to conduct a second \ndeclassification review and \"require the government to justify its proposed redactions, permit \nMovants an opportunity to respond, and then make findings on the record about whether the \nproposed redactions are narrowly tailored to avert a substantial risk of harm to a compelling \ngovernmental interest.\"  Movants' Reply Br. 2, available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/ \ndefault/files/ Misc%2013-08%20Reply-1.pdf.  Movants claim the qualified First Amendment \nright of public access mandates these procedures as a matter of right, although they concede that \n\"much of this Court's work may not be subject to a constitutional right of access ....\"   Movants' \nReply Br. 1. \n- 5 -\n\nright of access.  The result is a legal analysis that ignores the Supreme Court's direction to \nexamine the nature and source of Movants' claims and gauge their standing by the specific \nconstitutional claims they present.  This confusion has consequences because the First \nAmendment and the common law are analyzed differently. \nThe First Amendment provides no general right of access to government proceedings. \nHouchins v. KOED. Inc., 438 U.S. 1, 15 (1978) (plurality) (\"The Constitution itself is neither a \nFreedom of Information Act nor an Official Secrets Act\" and \"[n]either the First Amendment nor \nthe Fourteenth Amendment mandates a right of access to government information or sources of \ninformation within the government's control.\").  Accord Phillips v. DeWine, 841F.3d405, 419 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (rejecting a broad assertion of a First Amendment right to government \ninformation that pertains to a government proceeding and noting that \"[n ]either this court nor the \nSupreme Court has ever recognized a right so broad\").  Nor does the First Amendment provide a \npresumptive4 or general right of access to \"judicial proceedings\" as a subset of government \nproceedings.  See. e.g., id. (noting that Houchins \"sets the baseline principle for First \nAmendment claims seeking access to information held by the government\").  Richmond \nNewspapers and its progeny offer an \"exception\" to the Houchins rule that there is no First \nAmendment right to access government proceedings, id. at 418, but that exception is limited to \njudicial proceedings that satisfy what has come to be known as the \"experience\" and \"logic\" tests \n4  When courts refer to a \"presumptive First Amendment right of access,\" see. e.g., N.Y. \nCivil Liberties Union v. New York City Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 296 (2d Cir. 2012), that \n\"presumption\" only comes into play after the First Amendment actually applies or attaches. \nThere is, however, no \"presumption\" that the First Amendment applies or attaches to any \nparticular judicial proceeding or document; instead, the Supreme Court established the non \npresumptive test set forth in Richmond Newspapers. Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980) \n(plurality opinion), and its progeny. \n-6-\n\nset forth by the Supreme Court to determine when the First Amendment applies to a particular \njudicial proceeding to which access is sought, see Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. l, \n9 ( 1986) (\"Press-Entemrise II\") (\"If the particular proceeding in question passes these tests of \nexperience and logic, a qualified First Amendment right of public access attaches.\"). \nThe D.C. Circuit observed in Flynt v. Rumsfeld, 355 F.3d 697 (D.C. Cir. 2004), that the \nSupreme Court has found that a qualified First Amendment right of public access applies to \ncriminal judicial proceedings only when the place and process historically have been open to the \npublic and public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular \nprocess in question.  355 F.3d at 704.  Lower courts have extended the Richmond Newspapers \nexception to certain trial-like civil proceedings found to satisfy the same experience and logic \ntests, but the Supreme Court has never ratified that approach.  Id. \nAgain, standing must be \"gauged by the specific ... constitutional claims that a party \npresents.\" lnt'l Primate Prot. League, 500 U.S. at 77.  The \"specific\" constitutional claims \nMovants present are claims under the First Amendment to access information in FISC judicial \nopinions that the Executive Branch has determined is classified national security information. \nThe FISC issued those opinions in ex parte proceedings that are unique to its jurisdiction under \n50 U.S.C. §§ 1842(b) and 1861(b)(l).  Movants also assert a concomitant right to challenge the \nconstitutionality of each of those classification decisions, to require the Executive Branch to \ndefend them, and to obtain FISC rulings on it all.  Because the unclassified portions of the FISC \nopinions at issue have already been made public, Movants' alleged interest can only be described \nas accessing \"classified information in FISC judicial opinions\"5 and not the broader universe of \n5  This framing of the interest is consistent with the Court's prior precedent addressing \nwhether the qualified First Amendment right of public access applies to classified FISC judicial \nproceedings.  See In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 491-97 (FISA \n- 7 -\n\n\"access to judicial proceedings\" generally, as perceived by the Majority Opinion.6  See,~' \nDoe, 749 at 266 (limiting the First Amendment to \"secur[ing] a right of access only to particular \njudicial records and documents\" and not to \"all judicial documents and records\"). \nTo be sure, one can find broad statements about a right of the public to access judicial \nproceedings more generally.  But those statements concern the common law right of access, \nwhich is a right that was not invoked by Movants and is analytically distinct from the First \nAmendment right they claimed.  As the Fourth Circuit cogently explained, \"[t]he common-law \npresumptive right of access extends to all judicial documents and records\" whereas \"[b] y \ncontrast, the First Amendment secures a right of access only to particular judicial records and \ndocuments\" when it applies.  See Doe v. Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 265-66 (4th Cir. 2014) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted, emphases added). 7  The Sixth Circuit echoed this \nCt. 2007) (concluding that the First Amendment provides no public right of access to FISC \njudicial records). \n6  Movants contend their interest is in \"opinions containing significant legal interpretation \nof the Constitution and statutory law\" and they argue that \"[f]or those sorts of opinions, at least, \nthe First Amendment has always required courts to operate openly ....\"   Movants' Reply Br. I. \nThis argument is clearly erroneous.  For example, the Supreme Court has implied, and federal \ncircuit courts of appeal have expressly held, that the qualified First Amendment right of public \naccess does not apply to grand jury proceedings where significant opinions are frequently made. \nSee, e.g., Douglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211, 218-21 (1979) (making \nclear that grand jury proceedings historically have been closed to the public and public access \nwould hinder the efficient functioning of those proceedings so such proceedings impliedly would \nnot satisfy the test of experience and logic set forth in Richmond Newspapers); In re Motions of \nDow Jones & Co., 142 F.3d 496, 499 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (\"A settled proposition, one the press does \nnot contest, is this: there is no First Amendment right of access to grand jury proceedings.\"); \nUnited States v. Smith, 123 F.3d 140, 148 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"Not only are grand jury proceedings \nnot subject to any First Amendment right of access, but third parties can gain access to grand \njury matters only under limited circumstances.\"). \n7  Accord In re U.S. for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(D), 707 F.3d 283, 291 n.8 \n(4th Cir. 2013) (rejecting plaintiffs' contention that the First Amendment protects a general right \nto access judicial orders and proceedings because \"[t]his interpretation of the First Amendment \n- 8 -\n\nsentiment when it stated that the First Amendment covers only \"certain proceedings and \ndocuments filed therein and nothing more.\"  Phillips, 841 F.3d at 419 (internal quotation marks \nomitted, emphasis added). \nIn describing the right of access to judicial records under the common law, the Supreme \nCourt has stated that \"[i]t is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general right to \ninspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents.\" \nNixon v. Warner Commc'ns. Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978).  That right, however, is not \nsacrosanct and yields when, for example, \"Congress has created an administrative procedure for \nprocessing and releasing to the public\" the material sought by a litigant, id. at 603, which \narguably is the case here.  Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act of20158-fittingly titled \n\"Declassification of significant decisions, orders, and opinions\"-now provides procedures for \nmaking FISC judicial opinions publicly available.  In addition, the Freedom of Information Act \n(\"FOIA\") dictates what \"[e]ach agency shall make available to the public ....\"   5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a).  Moreover, this Court previously held that, with respect to FISC proceedings, the \ncommon law right of access is preempted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, \ncodified as amended at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1885c (West 2015) (\"FISA\").  In re Motion for \nRelease of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 490-91 (rejecting the ACLU's claim of a common \nlaw right of access because, among other reasons, \"[t]he requested records are being maintained \nunder a comprehensive statutory scheme designed to protect FISC records from routine public \nright of access is too broad, and directly contrary to our holding that this right extends only to \nparticular judicial records and documents\"). \n8  Pub. L. No. 114-23, 129 Stat. 268 (2015), as codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1872. \n-9-\n\ndisclosure\").  The essential point, however, is that Movants have not claimed a violation of the \ncommon law right of access. \nB. \nAfter properly framing Movants' interest as an interest in accessing classified \ninformation in FISC judicial opinions rather than the expansion adopted by the Majority, it is \nnecessary to decide whether that interest is protected by law.  Movants cite the qualified First \nAmendment right of public access as their only legally protected interest. 9  The only interest \nprotected by the qualified First Amendment right of public access, however, is an interest in \naccess to trial-like judicial proceedings to and related documents when the place and process \nhistorically have been open to the public and public access plays a significant positive role in the \nfunctioning of the particular process in question.  See. e.g., Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 9 \n(stating that the \"particular proceeding\" in question must pass the tests of experience and logic \nfor the qualified First Amendment right of access to attach); Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. v. \n9  In re Opinions of This Court, No. Misc. 13-08, 2017 WL 427591, at *21. \n10  As discussed supra page 7, the Supreme Court has never extended the qualified First \nAmendment right of public access to non-criminal proceedings and the D.C. Circuit continues to \nadhere to the Supreme Court's application.  See. e.g., Elm!, 355 F.3d 697 at 704 {\"To \nsummarize, neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has ever applied Richmond Newspapers \noutside the context of criminal proceedings, and we will not do so today.\").  Other courts, \nthough, have extended the right to certain trial-like civil and administrative proceedings.  See. \n~' N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2012). \nWhile we all recognize this contrary authority, it remains true that, \"[b] olstered by the Sixth \nAmendment's express right for a 'public trial' in 'all criminal prosecutions,' public access to \ncriminal trials forms the core of this First Amendment constitutional right.\"  In re Application of \nWP Co. LLC, 201 F. Supp. 3d 109, 117 (D.D.C. 2016) (internal citations omitted).  See also \nUnited States v. Doe, 63 F.3d 121, 127 (2d Cir. 1995) (reciting history of open criminal trials and \nnoting \"[i]n Gannett [Co .. Inc. v. DePasguale], 443 U.S. 368] 379-81, the Supreme Court, \nstriking the balance in favor of the criminal defendant, determined that the Sixth Amendment \nguarantee of a public trial was personal to the accused and did not grant the press and general \npublic an independent right of access, at least to pretrial suppression hearings\"). \n- 10 -\n\nGen. Electric Co., 854 F.2d 900, 903 (6th Cir. 1988) (applying the same tests to a civil \nproceeding).  To distill this point to its essence for our purposes, it is fair to say that the qualified \nFirst Amendment right of public access protects only an interest in judicial proceedings and \nrelated documents involving places and processes that have been historically public. 11  That \nrubric patently does not apply to the FISC, FISC proceedings or FISC judicial opinions, or to \ninformation classified by the Executive Branch and redacted in declassified versions of FISC \njudicial opinions. \nWorking in secrecy at the FISC is not simply a matter of \"necessity.\" Majority Op. 2.  It \nis a legislative imperative under FISA.  See. e.g., 50 U.S.C. §§ 1803(c) (stating that \"[t]he record \nof proceedings under this chapter, including applications made and orders granted, shall be \nmaintained under security procedures established by the Chief Justice in consultation with the \nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence\"), 1805(a) (mandating that, \"[u]pon \nan application made pursuant to section 1804 of this title, the judge shall enter an ex parte order \nas requested or as modified\" if certain specified findings are made), 1842(d  )( 1) (same), \n1861(c)(l) (same).  The FISC has twice emphasized this congressional mandate.  See In re \nOpinions & Orders of This Court, No. Misc. 13-08, 2017 WL427591, at *15; In re Motion for \nRelease of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 488-90.  And at least twice the FISC has \nemphasized that its proceedings have never been public, it has never held a public hearing, and \nthe number of opinions released to the public is statistically minor relative to the thousands of \nclassified decisions it has issued.  See In re Opinions & Orders of This Court, 2017 WL 427591, \n11  The Majority agrees.  Majority Op. 6 (admitting that \"to determine whether the public has \na right of access to particular judicial proceedings, courts must ask ... whether the place and \nprocess historically have been open to the press and general public\" (internal quotation marks \nomitted)). \n- 11 -\n\nat *17-20; In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 487-88, 492-93. \nNotably, too, in this matter no sealing order or other discretionary action has been taken by the \nCourt to impede public access to its classified opinions or the classified information redacted \nfrom its declassified and public opinions.12  The point is not just that FISC proceedings and \njudicial documents have never been historically public, but, importantly, the FISC does not \nexercise discretionary decision making about whether to conduct its proceedings in a non-public \nfashion-it is required to do so by statute. \nThis history of non-public proceedings weighs heavily against Movant's asserted First \nAmendment right of access to information classified by the Executive Branch.  Even \"[m]ore \nsignificant is that from the beginning of the republic to the present day, there is no tradition of \npublicizing secret national security information ....\"   Dhiab v. Trump, 852 F.3d 1087, 1094 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017).  \"The tradition is exactly the opposite.\" Id. \nMovants argue that this Court should not defer to the Executive Branch's classification \ndecisions but should review and potentially reject those decisions.  Movants' Reply Br. 2.  This \nargument is considered only to determine whether Movants have identified a right that the First \nAmendment protects, not to rule on its merits.  They have not identified such a First Amendment \nright to FISC review of Executive Branch classification decisions.  Furthermore, this Court has \n12  In Bond v. Utreras, 585 F.3d 1061, 1073 (7th Cir. 2009), the Seventh Circuit noted that \nthe common law offers a presumptive right of access to most documents filed in court based on \nthe principle that courts \"are public institutions that operate openly\" and \"judicially imposed \nlimitations on this right are subject to the First Amendment.\"  Because the FISC issued no \nsealing order or protective order preventing Movants' access to the classified information they \nseek, there has been no \"judicially imposed limitation\" that would be subject to the First \nAmendment.  Furthermore, contrary to the Majority Opinion's assertion that Bond is \"thin \nsupport,\" Majority Op. 15, it stands for the very proposition asserted in the January 25, 2017 \nOpinion, 2017 WL 427591, at *10, which is that when there is no law that applies to protect a \nplaintiffs asserted interest, there is no legally protected interest sufficient to establish Article III \nstanding. \n- 12 -\n\npreviously said that \"[u  ]nder FISA and the applicable Security Procedures, there is no role for \nthis Court independently to review, and potentially override, Executive Branch classification \ndecisions\" and, even \"if the FISC were to assume the role of independently making \ndeclassification and release decisions in the probing manner requested by the ACLU, there \nwould be a real risk of harm to national security interests and ultimately to the FISA process \nitself.\"  In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 491. \nThe Majority Opinion fails to accord these principles the governing weight to which they \nare entitled.  Richmond Newspapers specifically established a two-part test for determining when \nthe qualified First Amendment right of access applies - and that standard requires both the place \nand the process to have been historically public. 13  The Majority Opinion appears to accept this \nprinciple, 14 even as it fails to apply it.  There is no legal basis to find that Movants present a \ncolorable claim the First Amendment protects their asserted interest in accessing a place and \nprocess that is distinctly not public and required by law to not be public. \nIII. \nThe Majority Opinion most strenuously decries the January 25, 2017 decision in In re \nOpinions of This Court because the Majority believes that deciding Movants have no legally \nprotected interest necessarily, and improperly, involved deciding the merits of Movants' cause of \naction.  The Majority Opinion chastises the decision for having \"engaged in a lengthy merits \nanalysis of Movants' claim under the Richmond Newspapers 'experience and logic' test,\" \n13  \"The First Amendment guarantees the press and the public access to aspects of court \nproceedings, including documents, 'if such access has historically been available, and serves an \nimportant function of monitoring prosecutorial or judicial misconduct.\"'  United States v. El \nSayegh, 131 F.3d 158, 161 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  Accord Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 9. \n14  See note 11, supra. \n- 13 -\n\nMajority Op. 5.  But the Majority fails to explain why it believes that addressing Richmond \nNewspapers constituted deciding the merits of the motion.  Plainly an examination of the law \ninvoked by Movants may be part of-even essential to-a proper analysis of standing.  See \nWarth, 422 U.S. at 500 (\"[S]tanding ... often turns on the nature and source of the claim \nasserted.\"); lnt'l Primate Prot. League, 500 U.S. at 77 (\"[S]tanding is gauged by the specific \ncommon-law, statutory or constitutional claims that a party presents.\").  Because application of \nthe experience and logic tests revealed that Movants have no right of public access to classified \nFISC judicial documents or proceedings, they failed to identify an interest that is legally \nprotected and, thus, have no standing. \nThe Majority takes the mistaken and circular view that, because the Court must assume \nthat on the merits Movants would be successful in their claims when it evaluates standing, it \ntherefore follows that, \"[t]rom this base,\" the Court can conclude that Movants satisfy the \nrequirements of Article III standing.  Majority Op. 8.  The Majority misinterprets the Supreme \nCourt's edict that consideration of Article III standing does not involve consideration of the \nmerits.  \"Because a review of standing does not review the merits of a claim, but the parties and \nforum involved, our assumption during the standing inquiry that the plaintiff will eventually win \nthe relief he seeks does not, on its own, assure that the litigant has satisfied any element of \nstanding.\"  Fla. Audubon Soc'y v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 664 n.l (D.C. Cir. 1996) (internal \ncitations omitted, emphasis added).  \"Any assumption as to the outcome of the litigation simply \ndoes not resolve the issues critical to a standing inquiry.\"  Id.  That is because, as the Second \nCircuit has noted, \"[t]he standing question is distinct from whether [a litigant] has a cause of \naction!''  Carver v. New York, 621 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Whitmore v. Arkansas, \n495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990)) (emphasis added).  Cf. Libertad v. Welch, 53 F.3d 428, 439 (1st Cir. \n- 14 -\n\n1995) (\"Appellants need not establish the elements of their cause of action in order to sue, only \nto succeed on the merits.\"). \n\"[W]hat has been traditionally referred to as the question of standing ... involves \nanalysis of 'whether a party has a sufficient stake in an otherwise justiciable controversy to \nobtain judicial resolution of that controversy .... \"'15  DaCosta v. Laird, 471 F.2d 1146, 1152 \n(2d Cir. 1973) (quoting Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 731-732 (1972)) (emphasis \nomitted).  The \"merits analysis ... determines whether a claim is one for which relief can be \ngranted if factually true.\"  Catholic League for Religious & Civil Rights v. Citv and Cnty. of San \nFrancisco, 624 F.3d 1043, 1049 (9th Cir. 2010) (en bane).  \"A party's injury in fact is distinct \nfrom its potential causes of action.\"  Am. Farm Bureau Fed'n v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 836 \nF.3d 963,..968 (8th Cir. 2016).  As demonstrated below, whether Movants can establish the \nelements of their cause of action alleging that the Court improperly withheld information that the \nExecutive Branch improperly determined was classified national security information requires \nconsideration of factual and legal issues separate from the question of whether the First \nAmendment applies at all to certain FISC judicial opinions and proceedings.  The Majority \noverlooks this important nuance in the Supreme Court's legal standard that otherwise prohibits \nconsideration of standing from reaching the merits of the cause of action. \nThe Majority's error also represents a misreading of Richmond Newspapers and its \nprogeny, as well as cases that find no standing when a plaintiff fails to identify a legally \nprotected interest.  The Majority Opinion notes the Tenth Circuit's statement in Initiative & \n15  \"Although the standing question is often dressed in the dazzling robe of legal jargon, its \nessence is simple-what kind of injuries are courts empowered to remedy and what kind are they \npowerless to address?\"  Schaffer v. Clinton, 240 F.3d 878, 883 (10th Cir. 2001). \n- 15 -\n\nReferendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 F.3d 1082, 1092 (10th Cir. 2006) that, '\"[f]or purposes of \nstanding, the question cannot be whether the Constitution, properly interpreted, extends \nprotection to the plaintiffs asserted right or interest.\"'  Majority Op. 8 (quoting Walker, 450 \nF .3d at 1092).  But the Majority misunderstands the import of the statement:  its principle applies \nwhen, unlike this matter, there is an applicable constitutional provision and both standing and the \nmerits involve the same question about the scope of that applicable constitutional provision.  See \nDay v. Bond, 500 F.3d 1127, 1136-1138 (10th Cir. 2007) (\"Critically, however, in Walker, the \nplaintiffs' asserted injury and their claimed constitutional violation were one and the same.\"). \nWhen standing and the merits require different legal analyses, standing can be, and must be, \ndecided first and independently.  Id.  The Tenth Circuit explained: \n[W]e did note [in Walker] that \"the term 'legally protected interest' must \ndo some work in the standing analysis ... [and] has independent force and \nmeaning without any need to open the door to merits considerations at the \njurisdictional stage.\"  Id. at 1093 .... \nPractically  speaking,  Walker  mandates  that  we  assume,  during  the \nevaluation of the plaintiffs standing, that the plaintiff will prevail on his \nmerits argument-that is, that the defendant has violated the law.  See id. \n(\"For purposes of standing, we must assume the [p]laintiffs' claim has \nlegal  validity.\").  But there  is  still work to  be done by the  standing \nrequirement,  and  Supreme  Court  precedent  bars  us  from  assuming \njurisdiction based upon a hypothetical legal injury.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 560, 112 S. Ct. 2130.  While Walker addressed an instance in which the \nmerits of the plaintiffs' claims mirrored the alleged standing injury, that is \nnot always the case.  There are cases,  such as the one before us here, \nwhere  the  alleged injury  upon  which  the  plaintiffs  rely  to  establish \nstanding is distinct from the merits ofc laims they assert. E.g., In re Special \nGrand Jurv 89-2, 450 F.3d 1159, 1172-73 (10th Cir.2006) (\"[A] plaintiff \ncan have standing despite losing on the merits-that is, even though the \n[asserted legally protected] interest would not be protected by the law in \nthat case.\"); see also Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envt'l Study Grp., Inc., \n438 U.S. 59, 78-79, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978). \nHere, the issue of standing is not necessarily determined by the merits \ndetermination. The merits issue is whether K.S.A. § 76-731 a is preempted \nby 8 U.S.C. § 1623.  The standing question is whether§ 1623 creates a \nprivate cause of action.  Each of these issues is separate and independent, \n- 16 -\n\nand we may determine whether the Plaintiffs here have standing to assert \na private cause of action under § 1623 without reaching the merits of \nwhether §  1623  preempts § 76-73la.  See DH2. Inc.  v.  U.S.  Sec.  & \nExchange Comm'n, 422 F.3d 591, 592 (7th Cir. 2005) (determining that \nthe plaintiff lacked standing because its injury was speculative, without \naddressing the merits of the underlying claim). \nUnder these conditions, Walker simply does not apply.  Accordingly, we \nnow tum to the pure standing question whether § 1623 confers a private \ncause of action upon the Plaintiffs. \nId. (emphases added).16  Day makes a useful distinction that is helpful to the immediate \ndiscussion. \nAccording to the Tenth Circuit, decisions on standing and the merits remain independent \nlegal inquiries whenever a decision on the merits would not necessarily decide standing.  Only \nwhen both merits and standing require a decision on the same legal question does that Circuit \nfind them conjoined so that standing cannot be separately decided first.17  That is not the case \nhere. \nIn Press-Entemrise II the Supreme Court made clear that, when the qualified First \nAmendment right of public access applies (which is an antecedent inquiry Movants failed to \n16  To be clear, Walker itself involved a recognized First Amendment right because plaintiffs \nwere asserting a free-speech interest expressly protected by the First Amendment.  450 F.3d at \nI 088.  In the instant matter, the immediate question is whether Movants have a colorable right \nunder the First Amendment to access information in FISC opinions that the Executive Branch \ndetermined was classified. \n17  The Tenth Circuit has also recounted \"instances in which courts have examined the \nmerits of the underlying claim and concluded that the plaintiffs lacked a legally protected interest \nand therefore lacked standing.\"  Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. Nielson, 376 F.3d \n1223, 1236 (10th Cir. 2004).  The D.C. Circuit has clearly held that when \"plaintiff's claim has \nno foundation in law, he has no legally protected interest and thus no standing to sue.\" \nClaybrook v. Slater, 111 F.3d 904, 907 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (citations omitted).  Deciding standing \ncan often come close to the merits without violating legal principles.  See Arjay Assocs., Inc. v. \nBush, 891 F.2d 894, 898 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (stating that \"[b]ecause appellants have no right to \nconduct foreign commerce in products excluded by Congress, they have in this case no right \ncapable of judicial enforcement and have thus suffered no injury capable of judicial redress\"). \n- 17 -\n\nsurmount in this case), a cause of action arises if ( 1) access was denied (2) without specific, on \nthe-record findings (3) demonstrating that '\"closure [was] essential to preserve higher values\"' \nand (4) closure was \"narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\"' 478 U.S. at 13-14 (quoting Press \nEnter. Co. v. Superior Ct., 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984) (\"Press-Entemrise I\")).  Movants contend \nthat their cause of action also includes as an element a right to challenge the government's \nclassification decisions.  Movants' Reply In Support of Their Mot. for the Release of Court \nRecords 4, available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Misc%2013-\n08%20Reply-l.pdf.  These elements form Movants' cause of action, the merits of which were \nnever discussed in In re Opinions of This Court. \nAs to standing, however, the question focuses on whether classified FISC judicial \nopinions and proceedings have been historically open to the public and arise from a trial-like \nsetting, see Richmond Newspapers, so that Movants have a colorable legally protected interest. \nThis latter question does not run to the merits of their cause of action but, instead, to \"whether \nthe plaintiffs have a legal right to do what is allegedly being impeded.\"  Citizen Ctr., 770 F.3d at \n91 O; see also Grella, 553 F.2d at 261 (\"standing does require an injury to the party arising out of \na legal right\"); Cox Cable Commc'ns, Inc., 992 F.2d at 1182 (there is no injury \"unless an \ninterest is protected\"). \nThe Majority ignores this directly-applicable precedent in opining that the January 25, \n2017 decision ruled improperly on the merits in deciding that Movants had not asserted a legally \n- 18 -\n\nprotected interest under the First Amendment.18  The Majority confuses proper application of the \nArticle III requirement that a litigant present a cognizable legal interest with a merits decision on \nwhether that legal interest was unlawfully impaired. \nIV. \nThe Majority Opinion raises other considerations that, in my estimation, are not \npersuasive and do not detract from the foregoing analysis.  From the outset, the Majority Opinion \nnot only confuses the scope of the qualified First Amendment right of public access with the \ncommon law presumptive right of access, but the Majority also characterizes as \"novel\" \nMovants' theory that a qualified First Amendment right of public access applies to classified and \nex parte FISC judicial proceedings that historically never have been public.  However, it is not \nnovel.  Movants initially presented their First Amendment theory to the FISC more than a decade \nago, at which time it was considered and decisively rejected.  See In re Motion for Release of \nCourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484.  This same theory has been re-litigated without success \nmultiple times since. 19 \n18  See In re Opinions of This Court, 2017 WL 427591, at *9-13 (listing cases).  The \nMajority Opinion fails to distinguish these cases and cites no applicable precedent to the \ncontrary.  Each of the cases cited in In re Opinions of This Court involved dismissal for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction, which is not a decision on the merits.  See. e.g., Havens v. Mabus, \n759 F.3d 91, 98 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (stating that \"[w]e have previously held that dismissals for lack \nof jurisdiction are not decisions on the merits\"). \n19  See In re Orders of This Court Interpreting S. 215 of the Patriot Act, No. Misc. 13-02, \n2013 WL 5460064, at *1 (FISA Ct. 2013) (stating that the ACLU \"assert[ed] a qualified First \nAmendment right of access to the opinions in question\"); In re Proceedings Required by 702(i) \nofFISA Amendments Act of 2008, Misc. No. 08-01, 2008 WL 9487946, at *3 (FISA Ct. 2008) \n(observing that the ACLU's request for release under the First Amendment \"is similar to a \nrequest it made on August 9, 2007\"); In re Motion for Release of Court Records, Misc. No. 07-\n01 (FISA Ct. Feb. 8, 2008) (rejecting on reconsideration the ACLU's First Amendment theory). \n- 19 -\n\nMore importantly, the Majority suggests that novelty might have legal significance to the \nreal issue, i.e., whether Movants' claims involve injury to a legally protected interest.  For \nexample, the Majority Opinion states, \"[a]s far as we can tell, courts have uniformly found \nstanding to bring a First Amendment right-of-access suit so long as plaintiffs allege an invasion \nrelated to judicial proceedings\" and \"[t]hat is so no matter how novel or meritless the claims may \nbe.\" Majority Op. 11.  The Majority Opinion cites no case to support this claim of \"uniform\" \njudicial \"findings.\" At best, the Majority Opinion goes on to assert that \"[s]ome courts have \nstretched the right-of-access even farther for standing purposes,\" Majority Op. 11, then cites a \nsingle D.C. Circuit decision, namely Flynt v. Rumsfeld, 355 F.3d 697 (D.C. Cir. 2004). \nThe Flynt decision does not do the work the Majority asks of it.  Contrary to the \nMajority's characterization, the .ElYill court found that appellants \"asserted no cognizable First \nAmendment claim.\"  355 F .3d at 703 (emphasis added).  Nonetheless, the .ElYill court found that \nthey had standing to bring (at best some of) their claims alleging a press right to embed with \ncombat troops, which was advanced based on the First Amendment's express guarantees of free \npress and speech, not the qualified First Amendment right of public access.  Id.  The .ElYill court \ndiscussed standing in a single paragraph that omits without explanation Lujan 's definition of \n\"injury in fact\" as \"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and \nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"20  504 U.S. at 560 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted, emphasis added).  Since .ElYill, the Supreme \nCourt has repeatedly reiterated that required element of an injury-in-fact, see supra page 3, \ncalling into question the perfunctory discussion of standing in .ElYill.  Finally, the .ElYill court's \n20  .ElYill also makes no mention of the alternative formulation that an \"injury in fact\" must \nbe legally and judicially cognizable.  See Raines, 521 U.S. at 819. \n- 20 -\n\nstanding analysis did not give any consideration to the novelty of the appellants' claim of a right \nto embed with troops and did not involve a request for access to judicial proceedings. \nThe Majority Opinion adds that \"many courts-including the Supreme Court-have not \neven felt it necessary to address standing in dealing with tenuous right-of-access claims,\" \nMajority Op. 12, and \"[a] long list of courts have acted in this fashion,\" Majority Op. 13.  The \nMajority Opinion then cites eight decisions from six courts:  (1) Houchins v. KQED. Inc., 438 \nU.S. 1 (1978); (2) Dhiab, 852 F.3d 1087; (3) Phillips, 841 F.3d 405; (4) In re United States for an \nOrder Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(0), 707 F.3d 283; (5) In re Search of Fair Finance, \n692 F.3d 424 (6th Cir. 2012); (6) In re New York Times Company to Unseal Wiretap and Search \nWarrant Materials, 577 F.3d 401 (2d Cir. 2009); (7) Baltimore Sun Company v. Goetz, 886 F.2d \n60 (4th Cir. 1989); (8) Calder v. Internal Revenue Service, 890 F.2d 781, 783-84 (5th Cir. \n1989)).  All of these cases collapse upon examination. \nThree of the cases cited by the Majority-Dhiab, In re New York Times Company and \nBaltimore Sun-did not address standing because they involved permissive intervenors.21  The \nfederal circuits are split about whether third-parties moving to intervene permissively under Rule \n24(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in ongoing litigation in which a case or controversy \nalready exists must themselves demonstrate Article III standing.  See Mangual v. Rotger-Sabat, \n317 F.3d 45, 61 (1st Cir. 2003) (stating that \"the circuits are split on the question of whether \nstanding is required to intervene if the original parties are still pursuing the case and thus \nmaintaining a case or controversy\").  Cf. In re Endangered Species Act§ 4 Deadline Litig., 704 \n21  See Dhiab, 852 F.3d at 1090 (stating that the district court \"granted the [press] \norganizations' motion to intervene\"); In re N.Y. Times Co. to Unseal Wiretap & Search Warrant \nMaterials, 577 F.3d at 401 (stating in background section that newspaper moved to intervene and \nciting the district court case confirming that fact); Baltimore Sun, 886 F.2d at 62 (stating that the \nBaltimore Sun had petitioned the district court to intervene). \n- 21 -\n\nF.3d 972, 980 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\"It remains, however, an open question in this circuit whether \nArticle III standing is required for permissive intervention.\"). \nHouchins involved news media organizations that sought to expand the scope of the First \nAmendment's express protections for a free press into an \"implied special right of access to \ngovernment-controlled sources of information.\"  438 U.S. at 7-8.  It is not surprising that the \nSupreme Court did not discuss standing given that the question was not whether the First \nAmendment's right of a free press applied but, rather, whether, properly interpreted, the scope of \nthat right mandated the access sought by the news media organizations.  Id. \nBecause the remaining cases, Phillips, In re United States for an Order Pursuant to 18 \nU.S.C. Section 2703(0), In re Search of Fair Finance and Calder were silent about the question \nof standing22 it is inappropriate to draw any conclusion about what they \"felt\" about standing. \nAriz. Christian Sch. Tuition Org. v. Winn, 563 U.S. 125, 144 (2011) (\"The Court would risk \nerror if it relied on assumptions that have gone unstated and unexamined.\").  At best, it might be \nargued that the absence of any relevant discussion of standing by these courts implies that they \nthought there was standing, except that \"[w   ]hen a potential jurisdictional defect is neither noted \nnor discussed in a federal decision, the decision does not stand for the proposition that no defect \nexisted.\" Id. 23  \"There is no such thing as a precedential sub silentio jurisdictional holding[.]\" \nCuba v. Pylant, 814 F.3d 701, 709 (5th Cir. 2016). \n22  Although the Sixth Circuit in Phillips addressed standing with respect to other \nconstitutional claims asserted by the plaintiffs, it failed to do so for the so-called \"right-of \naccess-to-govemment-proceedings\" claim.  841 F.3d at 414-20. \n23  See also United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U.S. 33, 38 (1952) (\"Even \nas to our own judicial power or jurisdiction, this Court has followed the lead of Chief Justice \nMarshall who held that this Court is not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where \nit was not questioned and it was passed sub silentio.\"). \n- 22-\n\nv. \nThe Majority Opinion fails to persuade.  It confuses the scope of a legally protected \ninterest under the qualified First Amendment right of public access with the scope of such an \ninterest under the common law.  It further confuses the standing requirement under Article III \nthat a litigant present an injury to a protected legal interest with the merits decision on whether \nthe litigant can actually prove that the asserted legal interest was impaired.  Under Richmond \nNewspapers, the qualified First Amendment right of public access patently does not apply to \nnon-trial-like judicial proceedings that are not public and never have been. The errors in the \nMajority Opinion effectively relax the requirements for Article III standing when members of the \npublic ask to review and comment on redacted classified information in FISC judicial opinions. \nAs a result, anyone in the United States apparently has a legally protected First Amendment \ninterest in accessing information in FISC judicial opinions that the Executive Branch determined \nis classified and may invoke this Court's statutorily-limited and specialized jurisdiction to \nchallenge those classification decisions as unconstitutional.  I cannot agree.  For these reasons I \nwould conclude that Movants lack standing to assert their claims as Article III standing \nrequirements are understood and applied in any case.  But the Court should apply those \nrequirements with particular rigor in this case. \nThe Supreme Court has instructed the lower courts to apply a more rigorous analysis of \nstanding when a party seeks to challenge actions by the Executive or Legislative Branches on \nconstitutional grounds.  See, e.g., Raines, 521 U.S. at 819-20.  To be precise, the Supreme Court \nhas stated that \"our standing inquiry has been especially rigorous when reaching the merits of \nthe dispute would force us to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of \nthe Federal Government was unconstitutional.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  Accord Crawford v. \nUnited States Dep't of the Treasury, 868 F.3d 438, 457 (6th Cir. 2017).  Layered onto this \n- 23 -\n\n\"especially rigorous\" analysis is the Supreme Court's observation that \"we have often found a \nlack of standing in cases in which the Judiciary has been requested to review actions of the \npolitical branches in the fields of intelligence gathering and foreign affairs,\" as also is the case \nhere.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013).24 \nIntelligence gathering is one of the \"vital aspects of national security.\"  Gen. Dynamics \nCorp. v. United States, 563 U.S. 478, 486 (2011).  \"Matters intimately related to ... national \nsecurity are rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention.\"  Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 292 \n( 1981 ).  Accordingly, \"unless Congress specifically has provided otherwise, courts traditionally \n24  The Majority disagrees that \"we should change our conclusion simply because we \nconsider a constitutional challenge involving the Executive Branch.\"  Majority Op. 16.  The \nMajority's position is difficult to follow; one cannot avoid a Raines analysis here.  An especially \nrigorous standing analysis is required-without reference to the merits-whenever the merits of \nthe disp.ute would force a court to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two \nbranches of the Federal Government was unconstitutional.  Raines, 521 U.S. at 819-20.  Movants \nare asking the FISC to do exactly that.  Critically, there has been no sealing, closure, or \nprotective order issued by the FISC to impede Movants' access to the classified information they \nseek, so there is no discretionary judicial action being challenged by Movants, unlike cases in \nwhich the qualified First Amendment right of access was found to apply.  See. e.g., Press-Enter. \nII, 478 U.S. at 4 (judicial closure order); Press-Enter. I, 464 U.S. at 503-504 (same); Globe \nNewspaper Co. v. Superior Court for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596, 598 (1982) (same); \nRichmond Newspapers, 448 US. at 559-60 (same). \nThe Majority Opinion also seizes on the dissent's quotation from Clapper to insist that there is no \n\"special standing requirement\" for plaintiffs seeking review of acts by the political branches in \nthe fields of intelligence gathering and foreign affairs.  Majority Op. 17 (claiming that the dissent \nis reading Clapper to impose such a requirement and citing Schuchardt v. President of the United \nStates, 839 F.3d 336 (3d Cir. 2016)).  But Schuchardt addressed a heightened standing \nrequirement in line with the analysis in Jewel v. Nat'l Sec. Agency, 673 F.3d 902, 913 (9th Cir. \n2011), in which the Ninth Circuit rejected a district court's requirement that plaintiffs \ndemonstrate a \"strong\" and \"persuasive\" claim to Article III standing when suing NSA.  This \ndissent quotes Clapper to caution against relaxing standing requirements and expanding judicial \npower, 568 U.S. at 408-409, not to advocate for special standing requirements.  Like this dissent, \nClapper made no mention of a \"special\" or \"heightened\" requirement to establish standing in the \nnational security realm or otherwise.  Rather, in combination, Raines and Clapper require courts \nto ensure the vigor of the principles of separation of powers by giving close attention and \nexacting consideration to the elements of standing when asked to review actions of the political \nbranches involving intelligence gathering. \n- 24-\n\nhave been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in ... national security \naffairs,\" Dep't of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 530 (1988), including \"the protection of classified \ninformation,\" which the Supreme Court has directed \"must be committed to the broad discretion \nof the agency responsible, and this must include broad discretion to determine who may have \naccess to it,\" id. at 529. \n\"'Relaxation of standing requirements is directly related to the expansion of judicial \npower[.]\"' Clapper, 568 U.S. at 408-409 (quoting United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166 \n(1974) (Powell, J., concurring)).  \"The law of Article III standing, which is built on separation \nof-powers principles, serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers \nof the political branches.\"  Id.  Importantly, \"decision-making in the field[] of ... national \nsecurity is textually committed to the political branches of government.\"  Schneider v. Kissinger, \n412 F.3d 190, 194 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  In the exercise of that textually-committed decision \nmaking, Congress has already provided two avenues for any member of the public to obtain \naccess to FISC judicial opinions (Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act and FOIA), subject to \nExecutive Branch classification decisions which, under FOIA, are subject to examination in \nfederal district courts insofar as specifically provided by statute. \nThe Majority Opinion provides no basis in law for the FISC to expand its jurisdiction \ncontrary to Supreme Court guidance, statutory provisions that limit its jurisdiction to a \nspecialized area of national concern, and the evident congressional mandate that the Court \nconduct its proceedings ex parte and in accord with prescribed security procedures.  Applying \n- 25 -\n\nwell-established principles of Article III standing with the rigor appropriate to a constitutional \nchallenge to Executive Branch determinations in the national security sphere, I continue to \nconclude that Movants lack standing to assert the constitutional claim in question. \nFor all these reasons, I respectfully dissent. \n- 26 -",

These opinions are subject to the public's First Amendment \nright of access, and no proper basis exists to keep the legal discussion in these opinions secret. I \nIn June 2013, government officials acknowledged the existence of an ongoing, seven-\nyear program of bulk collection of the call-detail records of nearly every telephonic \ncommunication in the country. The program was approved by this Court pursuant to a provision \nofFISA amended by Section 215 of the Patriot Act, 50 U.S.c. § 186l.2 Days after this call-\ntracking program was first revealed, Movants asked this Court to disclose its opinions addressing \nthe meaning, scope, and constitutionality of Section 215 and the legality of the call-tracking \nI Movants use the term \"bulk collection\" in this motion in the same way this Court used it in \nIn re Application oft he FBIf or an Order Requiring the Production of Tangible Things from \n[Redacted}, No. BR 13-109, 2013 WL 5741573 (FISA Ct. Aug. 29,2013). \n2 \"The Patriot Act\" is the common name for the Uniting and Strengthening America by \nProviding Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 200 1, Pub. L. \nNo. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272 (Oct. 26, 2001). Section 215 amended FISA in part and empowers the \nDirector of the FBI to obtain secret orders from this Court compelling third parties to produce \n\"any tangible things\" upon a showing that there are \"reasonable grounds to believe that the \ntangible things sought are relevant\" to an authorized foreign-intelligence or terrorism \ninvestigation.Id. § 1861(a)(I), (b)(2)(A). The orders are accompanied by a gag order forbidding \nrecipients from disclosing having received the order. See id. § 1861 (c)-(d ). \n\nprogram. 3 This Com1 granted that motion in part, and the government is now undertaking a \ndeclassification review of one of the Court's opinions in response.4 \nSince Movants filed that motion, however, it has become clear that other critical opinions \nof this Court approving the bulk collection of Americans' information remain secret. Movants \nseek access to those opinions for two reasons. First, some of those opinions pertain to other \nforms of bulk collection that the government has now acknowledged, such as the bulk collection \nof internet metadata and cell-site location information. The public is entitled to know the legal \nbases for those programs, but those bases have not yet been disclosed. Second, some of those \nopinions predate the call-tracking program and apparently supply the original legal analysis \nnecessary to understand this Court's later authorization of the call-tracking program. For \nexample, it appears that one of the earlier bulk-collection opinions provides the Court's most \ncomprehensive discussion both of the constitutionality of bulk collection under the Fourth \nAmendment and of the meaning of the term \"relevant\" as it appears in various FISA provisions. \nMovants' current request for access to opinions of this Court evaluating the legality of \nbulk collection seeks to vindicate the public's overriding interest in understanding how a far-\nreaching federal statute is being construed and implemented, and how constitutional privacy \nprotections are being enforced. The First Amendment guarantees the public a qualified right of \naccess to those opinions because judicial opinions interpreting constitutional and statutory limits \non governmental authorities-including those relevant to foreign-intelligence surveillance-have \n3 See Motion of ACLU & MFIAC for the Release of Court Records, In re Orders ojt his \nCourt Interpreting Section 215 oj the Patriot Act, No. Misc. 13-02 (FISA Ct. June 12, 2013), \nhttp://l.usa.gov/15dJTjx. \n4 See In re Orders oj this Court Interpreting Section 215 ojt he PATRIOT Act (In re Section \n215 Orders), No. Misc. 13-02,2013 WL 5460064, at *7 (FISA Ct. Sept. 13,2013); see also \nOrder, In re Section 215 Orders, No. Misc. 13-02 (FISA Ct.

Public disclosure serves to improve \nthe functioning of the Court itself, to enhance its perceived fairness and independence, and to \neducate citizens about the Court's role in ensuring the integrity ofthe FISA system. This First \nAmendment guarantee of public access may be overcome only if the government is able to \ndemonstrate a substantial probability of hann to a compelling interest and the absence of any \nalternative means to protect that interest. Any limits on the public's right of access must then be \nnarrowly tailored and demonstrably effective in avoiding that hann. \nThe Court should acknowledge the public's First Amendment right of access to these \nopinions and order their prompt publication. Because the opinions are of critical importance to \nthe ongoing public debate about the legitimacy of the government's surveillance activities, \nMovants respectfully request that the Court publish the opinions as quickly as possible, with only \nthose redactions justified under the stringent First Amendment standard. Alternatively, the Court \nshould exercise its discretion to publish the opinions expeditiously in the public interest. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nIn June 2013, The Guardian disclosed a previously secret order issued by this Court \ncompelling Verizon Business Network Services, a major U.S. telecommunications provider, to \nproduce to the National Security Agency (\"NSA\") \"all call detail records or 'telephony \nmetadata'\" of its customers over a ninety-day period. 5 Soon thereafter, the government disclosed \nthat the Secondary Order belongs to a broader NSA program that has been in place for seven \n5 Secondary Order at 2, In Re Application of the FBI for an Order Requiring the Production \nof Tangible Things from Verizon Bus.

In late June 2013, an administration official acknowledged a now-discontinued \ngovernment surveillance program that involved the collection of Americans' internet metadata in \nbulk. 7 The Director of National Intelligence (\"DNI\"), James R. Clapper, later reiterated that \nacknowledgment. 8 Additional releases of documents by the government have provided more \ndetails, specifying the apparent legal basis for the internet-metadata program. 9 \nIndeed, several recent disclosures suggest that the government's bulk-collection activities \ngo beyond even telephony and internet metadata. During a hearing before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in early October, DNI Clapper disclosed that the NSA \"conducted a secret pilot \nproject in 2010 and 2011 to test the collection of bulk data about the location of Americans' \n6 See Administration White Paper: Bulk Collection of Telephony Metadata Under Section 215 \nof the USA PATRIOT Act at 1 (Aug. 9,2013), \nhttp://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/Section2l5.pdf; Dep't of Justice, Report on the National \nSecurity Agency's Bulk Collection Programs for USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization at 3 (Feb. \n2,2011), http://l.usa.gov/1cdFJ1G. \n7 See Glenn Greenwald & Spencer Ackerman, How the NSA Is Still Harvesting Your Online \nData, Guardian, June 27,2013, http://gu.com/p/3gqrnz. \n8 See James R.

Potenza, General Counsel, NSA, to Staff Director, \nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (Feb. 25,2009), http://1.usa.govllcpIAa9 \n(stating that bulk collection of internet metadata was based on FISA's pen-register provision, 50 \nU.S.c. § 1841); see also, e.g., Letter from Ronald Weich, Assistant Attorney General, to Rep. \nBobby Scott, House Committee on the Judiciary, at 1 (Dec. 17.2009), http://1.usa.govlldk3hQO \n(referring to \"bulk collection of telephony metadata\" under Section 215 and a \"similar collection \nprogram conducted under the pen register/trap and trace authority ofFISA\"). \n4 \n\ncellphones.\"10 Though DNI Clapper told Congress that the government is no longer engaged in \nthe bulk collection of location information under Section 215, officials have elsewhere stated that \nthe government is authorized to obtain location information in bulk under the Secondary Order. II \nOn April 1, 2011, the NSA's Office of General Counsel informed the Senate Select Committee \non Intelligence that the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") had advised the NSA in February 2010 \nthat obtaining cell-site location information for \"testing purposes was permissible based upon the \ncurrent language of the [FISC's] BR FISA order requiring the production of 'all call detail \nrecords, \", and that the DOJ had \"orally advised the FISC\" only after the acquisition of this \ninformation. 12 Under questioning from lawmakers, various government officials have declined to \ndeny that the government is currently collecting Americans' location information in bulk, stating \nonly that such information is not being collected \"under this program\"-i.e., the call-tracking \nprogram already acknowledged under Section 215.13 \nThere are reasons to believe that the government is engaged in the bulk collection of \nother records as well. In a statement issued this summer, Senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall-\nboth members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence-warned that: \n[T]he Patriot Act's surveillance authorities are not limited to phone records. In \nfact, section 215 of the Patriot Act can be used to collect any type of records \nwhatsoever. The fact that Patriot Act authorities were used for the bulk collection \nof email records as well as phone records underscores our concern that this \n10 Charlie Savage, In Test Project, NS.A.

Inglis, Deputy Director, NSA). \n5 \n\nauthority could be used to collect other types of records in bulk as well, including \ninfonnation on credit card purchases, medical records, library records, firearm \nsales records, financial infonnation and a range of other sensitive subjects. These \nother types of collection could clearly have a significant impact on Americans' \nconstitutional rights. \n14 \nSenator Wyden expanded on this warning in a speech given later in July 2013, suggesting \nthat the government's view of its bulk-collection authority is \"essentially limitless\": \nEspecially troubling is the fact that there is nothing in the Patriot Act that limits \nthis sweeping bulk collection to phone records. The government can use the \nPatriot Act's business records authority to collect, collate and retain all sorts of \nsensitive infonnation, including medical records, financial records, or credit card \npurchases. They could use this authority to develop a database of gun owners or \nreaders of books and magazines deemed subversive. This means that the \ngovernment's authority to collect information on law-abiding American citizens is \nessentially limitless. If it is a record held by a business, membership organization, \ndoctor, or school, or any other third party, it could be subject to bulk collection \nunder the Patriot Act. \n15 \nAdditionally, this Court has confinned that it has addressed the legality of bulk collection \nof Americans' data outside the context of the call-tracking program. On September 17, 2013, the \nCourt published a partially redacted opinion issued on August 29,2013 (\"August 2013 FISC \nOpinion\") explaining its renewal of the NSA's call-tracking program.  In its opinion, the Court \n16 \nrelied upon earlier unpublished FISC opinions that apparently addressed the \"issue of relevance \nfor bulk collections\" under another provision of FISA and, presumably, the constitutionality of \n14 Sen.

While those matters involved different collections from the one at issue here, the \nrelevance standard was similar.\" (citing 50 U.S.c. § 1842(c)(2))); see id. at *2 (\"This Court had \nreason to analyze this distinction [between individual and bulk collection] in a similar context in \n[Redacted].\"). \n18 In addressing the Fourth Amendment implications of the call-tracking program, the August \n2013 FISC Opinion concludes that \"[t]he production of telephone service provider metadata is \nsquarely controlled by the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 \n(1979).\" 2013 WL 5741573, at *2. A more recent FISC opinion renewing the call-tracking \nprogram concurs and also considers the program's constitutionality in light of the Supreme \nCourt's decision in United States v. Jones, 132 S. Ct. 945 (2012). See Memorandum at 4-6, In re \nApplication oft he FBI for an Order Requiring the Production of Tangible Things from \n[Redacted), No. BR 13-158 (FISA Ct. Oct. 11,2013), http://l.usa.govI19QvFam.However,no \npublished FISC opinion to date has addressed the compatibility of the Fourth Amendment with \nthe bulk collection of other kinds of meta data, and the Court's original discussion of Smith and \nrelated authorities with respect to bulk collection remains secret. \n19 Ellen Nakashima & Carol D.

As one fonner administration \nofficial put it: \nIf the question is, \"How was this program authorized and what type oflegal \nanalysis first took place?\" the [August 2013 FISC Opinion] is just not \nresponsive .. .. It's hard for me to imagine, with all that's already out there, that \nhighly classified intelligence material would be so deeply entwined in the le~al \nanalysis in that original interpretation that they couldn't somehow release it. 0 \nAnd Senators Patrick Leahy and Ron Wyden both issued statements to the Post expressing their \nfinn support for the release of the FISC's original legal analysis of the call-tracking program. \n21 \nThe sum of the disclosures and releases of information over the past several months have \ngenerated a sustained and profound debate about the use of the government's surveillance \nauthorities and, in particular, the NSA's collection of Americans' data in bulk. Since early June \n2013, Congress has held more than ten hearings to question government officials about NSA \nsurveillance. Lawmakers have introduced legislation to end such bulk collection.22 And the \ngovernment itself has initiated various reviews of its collection activities and authorities. \n23 \nThis Court, too, has recognized the immense public interest in the ongoing debate. In In \nre Section 215 Orders, the Court acknowledged the important values served by the disclosure of \nthese opinions. It noted that previous public disclosures had \"engendered considerable public \ninterest and debate\" and that further \"[p ]ublication of FISC opinions ... would contribute to that \ndebate. ,,24 The Court also underscored the assertions by legislators of the \"value of public \n201d. \nSee id. \n21 \nSee, e.g., Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending \n22 \nEavesdropping, Dragnet-collection, and On-line Monitoring Act (\"USA FREEDOM Act\"), H.R. \n3361, 113th Congo (2013), http://1.usa.govlldnrXb3. \n23 See Paul Lewis, NSA Review Panel to Present Obama with Dossier on Surveillance \nReforms, Guardian, Oct. 28, 2013, http://gu.com/p/3kv3p. \nIn re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *7. \n24 \n8 \n\ninfonnation and debate in representing their constituents and discharging their legislative \nresponsibilities,\" and affinned that \"[p ]ublication would also assure citizens of the integrity of \nthis Court's proceedings.,,25 Likely for the same reason, the Court's Presiding Judge published \nhis conespondence with Congress explaining the FISC's operating procedures and detailing \ncertain statistics concerning the Court's approval of government applications, including under \n26 \nSection 215.\nDespite the extraordinary public interest in the surveillance programs authorized by the \nCourt, an unknown number of legal opinions evaluating the constitutionality of and statutory \nbasis for the bulk collection of Americans' data remain secret. \nJURISDICTION \nAs an inferior federal court established by Congress under Article III, this Court \npossesses inherent powers, including \"supervisory power over its own records and files ....\"  \nNixon v.  Warner Commc '11S, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978); accord Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., \n501 U.S. 32,43 (1991) (\"It has long been understood that [c ]ertain implied powers must \nnecessarily result to our Courts of justice from the nature of their institution.\" (quotation marks \nomitted)). As this Court has previously detennined, the FISC therefore has \"jurisdiction in the \nfirst instance to adjudicate a claim of right to the court's very own records and files.\" In re \nMotion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484,487 (FISA Ct. 2007). \n25 Id.; see Memorandum, In re Application of the FBIfor an Order Requiring the Production \nof Tangible Thingsfrom [Redacted}, No. BR 13-158 (FISA Ct. Oct. 11,2013), \nhttp://1.usa.gov/19QvFam; In re Application of the FBIfor an Order Requiring the Production \nof Tangible Thingsfrom [Redacted}, 2013 WL 5741573. \n26 See Letter from Hon. Reggie B. Walton, Presiding Judge, FISC, to Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, \nChainnan, Comm. on the Judiciary (Oct. 11,2013), http://1.usa.gov/19FoYrJ; Letter from Hon. \nReggie B. Walton, Presiding Judge, FISC, to Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Chainnan, Comm. on the \nJudiciary (July 29,2013), http://l.usa.gov/laloM6n. \n9 \n\nARGUMENT \nI.  MOVA  NTS HAVE STANDING TO BRING THIS PUBLIC-ACCESS MOTION. \nTo demonstrate Article III standing, a party seeking judicial action must show \"(1) that it \nhas suffered an 'injury in fact'; (2) that the injury is caused by or fairly traceable to the \nchallenged actions of the defendant; and (3) that it is likely that the injury will be redressed by a \nfavorable decision.\" Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 306 F.3d 1144, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citing Lujan v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,560-61 (1992)). Each element is met here. \nDenial of access to court opinions alone constitutes an injury sufficient to satisfy Article \nIII. As the Supreme Court recognized in Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Courtfor County of \nNo/folk, 457 U.S. 596 (1982), the First Amendment right of access \"serves to ensure that the \nindividual citizen can effectively participate in and contribute to our republican system of self \ngovernment.\" Id. at 604; see Richmond Newspapers Inc. v.  Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 576 (1980) \n(The First Amendment prohibits \"the government from limiting the stock of information from \nwhich members of the public may draw.\" (quotation marks omitted)). The right extends to \norganizations, and not just individuals. See N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.c. Transit Auth., \n684 F.3d 286,294-95 (2d Cir. 2011). \nAccordingly, when a court closes its proceedings or seals records that are subject to the \nFirst Amendment right, any person denied access to the proceeding or record suffers a concrete \nand particularized injury. The injury is concrete because the party seeking access is in fact being \ndeprived of information, and it is particular because the party specifically sought and was denied \nthe material. Thus, in a case challenging a district court's exclusion of the press and public from \nplea and sentencing hearings and from access to court documents, the Fourth Circuit had no \ntrouble summarily holding that a newspaper whose reporter was denied access \"meets the \nstanding requirement because it has suffered 'an injury that is likely to be redressed by a \n10 \n\nfavorable decision.'\" 111 re Wash. Post, 807 F.2d 383,388 n.4 (4th Cir. 1986) (alteration omitted) \ns.c. \n(quoting Cent.  Chapter, Soc'y ofP  rofI  Journalists v. Martin, 556 F.2d 706, 707-08 (4th \nCir. 1977)); see also, e.g., NYC. Transit Auth., 684 F.3d at 295 (concluding that \"exclusion \nfrom at least some ... hearings\" sufficed to \"establish[] ... an actual injury\"); Ruminski v. \nCorsones, 396 F.3d 53, 83-84 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that the right of access can be \"asserted by \nan identified excluded individual\" and that \"any member of the public-not only members ofthe \npublic selected by the courts themselves-may come and bear witness to what happens beyond \nthe courtroom door\"). 27 \nMovants also satisfy the second and third prongs of the standing analysis: causation and \nredressability. There can be no doubt that Movants' inability to inspect this Court's opinions \n\"fairly can be traced to\" this Court's denial of public access to them. See Valley Forge Christian \nColi. v. Ams. Unitedfor Separation of Church & State, 454 U.S. 464,472 (1982). It is likewise \nclear that there is a '''substantial probability' that a favorable outcome would redress [Movants'] \ninjuries.\" Town ofB  arnstable v. FAA, 659 F.3d 28, 31  (D.C. Cir. 2011). By releasing the \nIn the recent request by Movants for access to the opinions of this Court interpreting \n27 \nSection 215, Judge Saylor imposed a heightened burden upon parties seeking to assert a right of \naccess, requiring a showing that the denial of access to this Court's opinions \"impedes [access \nseekers'] own activities in a concrete, particular way\" or that gaining access \"would be of \nconcrete, particular assistance to them in their own activities.\" In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 \nWL 5460064, at *2. MFIAC has moved for reconsideration of the Court's holding in that \nproceeding that it did not have standing to assert the right of access, see id. at *4, and contends \nthat these additional showings are not properly part of the standing analysis. See Mem. of Law in \nSupp. of Mot. by MFIAC for Recons. of this Court's Sep. 13,2013 Op. on the Issue of Article III \nStanding, In Re Section 215 Orders, No. Misc. 13-02 (FISA Ct. Oct. 11,2013), \nhttp://l.usa.govllaTGGa4 (\"MFIAC Recons. Br. \"). But even if those showings are necessary to \nestablish standing, both the ACLU and MFIAC satisfy the additional requirements. See In re \nSection 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *4 (holding that the ACLU has standing to assert a \nright of access to FISC records); MFIAC Recons. Br. at 15-16; Decl. of Maxwell S. Mishkin in \nSupp. ofMFIAC Recons. Br., Ex. to MFIAC Recons. Br. (describing the litigation, advocacy, \nand educational activities of MFIAC). \n11 \n\nrequested portions of its opinions on bulk data collection, this Court would enforce the right of \naccess that Movants assert. \nII.  THE FIRST AMENDMENT REQUIRES THE RELEASE OF THIS COURT'S \nOPINIONS CONCERNING THE LEGALITY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BULK \nCOLLECTION OF AMERICANS' DATA. \nA.  The First Amendment right of access attaches to judicial opinions, \nincluding the opinions of this COUli concerning the bulk collection of \nAmericans' data. \nThat the judicial process should be as open to the public as possible is a principle \nenshrined in both the Constitution and the common law. See Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. at \n564-73; Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. o/Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 2006) (\"The common \nlaw right of public access to judicial documents is firmly rooted in our nation's history. \"); cf \nLetter from James Madison to W. T. Barry (Aug. 4, 1822), in 9 Writings 0/ James Madison at 103 \n(G. Hunt ed. 1910) (\"A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of \nacquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both.\"). Under the Supreme \nCourt's \"experience and logic\" test, the First Amendment right of public access attaches to \njudicial proceedings and records where (a) the type of judicial process or record sought has \nhistorically been available to the public, and (b) public access plays a \"significant positive role\" \nin the functioning of the process itself. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court (Press-Enterprise \nII), 478 U.S. 1,9, 11 (1986); see Globe Newspaper, 457 U.S. at 605-07; Wash. Post v. Robinson, \n935 F.2d 282, 287-92 (D.C. Cir. 1991). Proceedings and records to which the right of access \nattaches are presumptively open to the public and may be closed only where there is a substantial \nprobability of harm to a compelling government interest, and where no alternative to a narrow \nlimitation of access can effectively protect against that harm. NY. C. Transit Auth., 684 F.3d at \n296. In other words, the right of access is qualified but may not be denied \"without sufficient \njustification.\" Id. \n12 \n\nHere, there is a nearly unbroken tradition of public access to judicial rulings and opinions \ninterpreting the Constitution and the laws governing the American people. Moreover, public \naccess to such rulings and opinions allows the public to function as an essential check on its \ngovernment and improves judicial decisionmaking. Those interests are particularly acute in the \ncontext of this Court's opinions interpreting the reach and constitutionality of the government's \nsurveillance authorities. Access would enhance the functioning of this Court and the FISA \nsystem by: facilitating effective public oversight, increasing the legitimacy and independence of \nthis Court, subjecting this Court's legal opinions to scrutiny within our common-law system, and \npermitting Congress, subject-matter experts, and the broader public to evaluate this Court's legal \ninterpretations as they consider changes to the law. For these reasons, and as explained more \nfully below, the constitutional right of access extends to the opinions ofthis Court concerning the \nlegality of the bulk collection of Americans' data. \n1.  \"Experience\" \nThe Supreme Court has instructed that the experience prong of its two-part test \"does not \nlook to the particular practice of anyone jurisdiction, but instead 'to the experience in that type \nor kind of hearing throughout the United States .... '\"  EI Vocero de PR. v. Puerto Rico, 508 \nU.S. 147, 150 (1993) (per curiam) (quoting Rivera-Puig v. Garcia-Rosario, 983 F.2d 311,323 \n(1st Cir. 1992)). In other words, the proper focus of the \"experience\" analysis is the type of \ngovernmental process or record to which a petitioner seeks access, not the past practice of the \nspecific forum. See, e.g., NYC. Transit Auth., 684 F.3d at 301 (rejecting view that \"Richmond \nNewspapers test looks ... to the formal description of the forum\"); Hartford Courant Co. v. \nPellegrino, 380 F.3d 83, 94 (2d Cir. 2004) (examining First Amendment right of access to court \n\"docket sheets and their historical counterparts,\" beginning with early English courts); In re Bas. \n13 \n\nHerald, Inc., 321 F.3d 174, 184 (1 st Cir. 2003) (experience test includes examination of \n\"analogous proceedings and documents\"). \nUnder this approach, in assessing the past experience of access to a new forum whose \nsecrecy is being challenged, it is inappropriate to analyze only the history of that forum itself. \nBecause there will never be a tradition of public access in new forums, this approach would \npermit Congress to circumvent the constitutional right of access altogether-even as to, say, \ncriminal trials-simply by providing that such trials hencef0l1h be heard in a newly created \nforum. See, e.g., N.YC Transit Auth., 684 F.3d at 296 (\"Immunizing government proceedings \nfrom public scrutiny by placing them in institutions the Framers could not have imagined ... \nwould make avoidance of constitutional protections all too easy.\"); In re Copley Press, Inc., 518 \nF.3d 1022, 1027 (9th Cir. 2008). The proper approach, therefore, is to examine whether the type \nof proceeding or record at issue-here judicial opinions interpreting the meaning and \nconstitutionality of public statutes-has historically been available to the public. See, e.g., N. Y. C \nTransit Auth., 684 F.3d at 299. \nNo type ofj udicial record enjoys a more uninterrupted history of openness than judicial \nopinions. As explained by the Third Circuit: \nAs ours is a common-law system based on the \"directive force\" of precedents, its \neffective and efficient functioning demands wide dissemination of judicial \ndecisions .... Even that part of the law which consists of codified statutes is \nincomplete without the accompanying body of judicial decisions construing the \nstatutes. Accordingly, under our system of jurisprudence the judiciary has the \nduty of publishing and disseminating its decisions. \nLowenschuss v.  W Pub. Co., 542 F.2d 180, 185 (3d Cir. 1976) (quoting Benjamin N. Cardozo, \nThe Nature of the Judicial Process 20, 21-22 (1963)); see Scheiner v.  Wallace, No. 93 Civ. \n0062,1996 WL 633226, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 31,1996) (\"The public interest in an accountable \n14 \n\njudiciary generally demands that the reasons for a judgment be exposed to public scrutiny.\" \n(citing United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1048-49 (2d Cir. 1995))). \nGiven this history, courts have customarily disclosed opinions dealing with the \ngovernment's authority to conduct investigations and gather information about U.S. citizens. For \nexample, the First Amendment right of access has been held to apply to judicial opinions \nconstruing the government's search and seizure powers. See In re Application ofN  Y Times Co. \nfor Access to Certain Sealed Court Records, 585 F. Supp. 2d 83, 88 (D.D.C. 2008). And federal \ncourts have routinely published their opinions interpreting the scope and constitutionality of \nintelligence collection permitted under FISA and related authorities-the very type of opinions \nu.s. \nMovants seek here. See, e.g., United States v.  Dist. Court for the E. Dist. ofM  ich., 407 U.S. \n297 (1972) (considering constitutionality of warrantless-wiretapping program conducted by the \ngovernment to \"protect the national security\"); United States v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59, 72-74, 77 \n(2d Cir. 1984) (analyzing FISA's original \"purpose\" requirement, and holding that \"FISA does \nnot violate the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment\"); Jewel v. Nat 'I Sec. \nAgency, 673 F.3d 902,905 (9th Cir. 2011) (reversing dismissal oflawsuit challenging \n\"widespread warrantless eavesdropping in the United States\"); In re Application for Pen Register \n& Trap/Trace Device with Cell Site Location Auth. (1n re PRITT with CSLI), 396 F. Supp. 2d \n747, 748-49 (S.D. Tex. 2005) (refusing government request to seal opinion \"because it concerns \na matter of statutory interpretation\" and the issue explored \"has serious implications for the \nbalance between privacy and law enforcement, and is a matter of first impression\"); see also, \ne.g., Defs.' Mem. in Opp. at 32-59, Amnesty 1nt'[ USA v. McConnell, 646 F. Supp. 2d 633 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2009) (ECF No. 10) (public, unredacted arguments of the government defending the \nconstitutionality of the FISA Amendments Act). \n15 \n\n2.  \"Logic\" \nJust as fundamentally, the \"significant positive role\" of public judicial decisionrnaking in \na democracy is so essential that it is hardly ever questioned. Courts have repeatedly recognized \nthat public access to judicial opinions serves a vital function: \nThe decisions and opinions of the justices are the authorized expositions and \ninterpretations of the laws, which are binding upon all the citizens. They declare \nthe unwritten law, and construe and declare the meaning of the statutes. Every \ncitizen is presumed to know the law thus declared, and it needs no argument to \nshow that justice requires that all should have free access to the opinions, and that \nit is against sound public policy to prevent this, or to suppress and keep from the \nearliest knowledge of the public the statutes, or the decisions and opinions of the \njustices. Such opinions stand, upon principle, on substantially the same footing as \nthe statutes enacted by the legislature. It can hardly be contended that it would be \nwithin the constitutional power of the legislature to enact that the statutes and \nopinions should not be made known to the pUblic .... The policy of the state \nalways has been that the opinions of the justices, after they are delivered, belong \nto the pUblic. \nNash v. Lathrop, 142 Mass. 29, 35- 36 (1886) (emphasis added) (cited by Banks v. Manchester, \n128 U.S. 244, 253-54 (1888) (Blatchford, J.)); see also Lowenschuss, 542 F.2d at 185. The \nimportance of public access to judicial opinions flows from two bedrock principles: (1) the \npublic's right to know what the law is, as a condition of democratic governance; and (2) the \nfounding recognition that, in our political system, it is \"emphatically the province and duty of the \njudicial department to say what the law is.\" Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 \n(1803). Because courts determine what the law means-and therefore what the law is-the \nsocietal need for access to judicial opinions is paramount. \nThe value in making judicial opinions available to the public only increases where, as \nhere, the opinions concern both the power of the executive branch and the constitutional rights of \ncitizens. See FTC v. Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d 404, 410 (1st Cir. 1987) (access to \ncourt files \"ac.centuated\" where \"the public's right to know what the executive branch is about \ncoalesces with the concomitant right of the citizenry to appraise the judicial branch\"); In re \n16 \n\nPRITT with CSLI, 396 F. Supp. 2d at 748-49 (refusing government request to seal order that \"has \nserious implications for the balance between privacy and law enforcement\"). \nThis principle applies with equal force in the context of national security, where the \ncourts routinely recognize and give effect to the public's right of access to judicial orders and \nopinions. See, e.g., United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 82-83 (2d Cir. 2008); In re Wash. Post, \n807 F.2d at 393; United States v. Rosen, 487 F. Supp. 2d 703, 710, 716-17 (E.D. Va. 2007). In \nfact, where matters of national security are at stake, the role of public evaluation of judicial \ndecisions takes on an even weightier role. See, e.g., In re Wash. Post, 807 F.2d at 393; United \nStates v. Ressam, 221 F. Supp. 2d 1252, 1262 (W.D. Wash. 2002). Moreover, public access to \nthe opinions of this Court is important to the functioning of the FISA system in several respects. \nFirst, public access to the opinions of this Court will promote public confidence in the \nintegrity, reliability, and independence of the FISC and the FISA system. Access to the reasoning \nand actions of this Court will allow the public to evaluate for itself the operation of the FISA \nsystem and the legal bases for the government's actions. As the Supreme Court has explained, \n\"[p] eople in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult \nfor them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.\" Press-Enterprise 11,478 U.S. at 13 \n(quotation marks omitted). See, e.g., Globe Newspaper, 457 U.S. at 606 (public access to court \ndocuments and proceedings \"fosters an appearance of fairness, thereby heightening public \nrespect for the judicial process\"); Arej, 533 F.3d at 83 (\"Transparency is pivotal to public \nperception of the judiciary's legitimacy and independence.\"); In re Orion Pictures Corp., 21 \nF.3d 24, 26 (2d Cir. 1994) (public access \"helps safeguard the integrity, quality, and respect in \nour judicial system, and permits the public to keep a watchful eye on the workings of public \nagencies\" (quotation marks and citations omitted); Ressam, 221 F. Supp. 2d at 1263 (explaining \n17 \n\nthat \"the general practice of disclosing court orders to the public not only plays a significant role \nin the judicial process, but is also a fundamental aspect of our country's open administration of \njustice\"). \nSecond, allowing the public to review and assess the reasoning of the opinions of this \nCourt will support more refined decisionmaking in future cases. For example, since the recent \nrelease of some of the Court's orders construing Section 215, there has already been a \nproliferation of highly sophisticated legal debate over the foundations of the program. See, e.g., \nDavid S. Kris, On the Bulk Collection of Tangible Things, Lawfare Res. Paper Series (Sep. 29, \n2013), http://www.lawfareblog.comlwp-contentiuploads/20 13/09/Lawfare-Research-Paper \nSeries-No.-4-2.pdf; Marty Lederman, The Kris Paper, and the Problematic FISC Opinion on the \nSection 215 \"Metadata\" Collection Program, Just Security (Oct. 1, 2013 5 :25 PM), \nhttp://justsecurity.org/2013/1 010 lIkris-paper-Iegality-section-215-metadata-collection; Laura K. \nDonohue, Bulk Metadata Collection: Statutory and Constitutional Considerations, 37 Harv. J. L. \n& Pub. Pol 'y (forthcoming 2014), http://justsecurity.orglwp-contentiuploads/20 13/1O  /Just \nSecurity-Donohue-PDF.pdf. This kind of detailed public discussion, which can only benefit the \nFISA system, was impossible prior to the release of this Court's opinions. \nThird, publishing this Court's opinions of broad legal significance will contribute to the \nbody of decisional law essential to the functioning of our common-law system. Article III courts \nhave always built upon the work of their predecessors by refining, reworking, or even, at times, \nabandoning decisions issued in the past. See, e.g., Penny v. Little, 4 Ill. (3 Scam.) 301, 304 \n(1841) (Douglass, J.) (\"The common law is a beautiful system; containing the wisdom and \nexperience of ages.\"). This iterative process lies at the foundation of our legal system but has \nbeen stunted by the continued secrecy of this Court's significant legal opinions. Other courts \n18 \n\nshould have access to this Court's determinations relating to bulk collection so that they may rely \non, respond to, or distinguish this Court's reasoning.28 \nFourth, access to this Court's opinions will educate citizens about the functioning of the \nFISA system and improve democratic oversight. Because the information released to date does \nnot adequately explain the constitutional and statutory bases for bulk collection, the release of \nthe requested opinions would permit the public-and Congress itself-to more fully understand \nthese programs and to contribute to the ongoing debate. See generally Br.  of Amici Curiae U.S. \nRepresentatives Amash et al. in Support of the Motion of the ACLU and MFIAC for the Release \nof Court Records, In re Section 215 Orders (June 28,2013), http://1.usa.gov/13mIlHL. \nMembers of Congress have acknowledged the importance of proper oversight, but that oversight \nhas been impeded by the secrecy surrounding the authority this Court has construed the \ngovernment to possess. See, e.g., Letter from Sens. Dianne Feinstein, Jeff Merkley, Ron Wyden, \n& Mark Udall to Hon. John Bates, Presiding Judge, FISC (Feb. 13,2013), \nhttp://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/fisc-021313.pdf; Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, HolV Obama \nHas Abused the Patriot Act, L.A. Times, Aug. 19,2013, http://lat.msIl7AIdiU. Indeed, members \nof this Court have recognized the value of public disclosure of its opinions construing the \ngovernment's surveillance authority. See, e.g., In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at \n*7; cf Nakashima & Leonnig, supra (Judge \"Kollar-Kotelly told associates this summer that she \n28 See also, e.g., California v. Carney, 471 U.S. 386,400-01 (1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) \n(\"The only true rules governing search and seizure have been formulated and refined in the \npainstaking scrutiny of case-by-case adjudication. Consideration of this matter by the lower \ncourts in a series of litigated cases would surely have facilitated a reasoned accommodation of \nthe conflicting interests. To identify rules that will endure, we must rely on the state and lower \nfederal courts to debate and evaluate the different approaches to difficult and unresolved \nquestions of constitutional law . Deliberation on the question over time winnows out the \nunnecessary and discordant elements of doctrine and preserves 'whatever is pure and sound and \nfine.

Several \nmembers of the intelligence court want more transparency about the court's role to dispel what \nthey consider a misperception that the court acted as a rubber stamp for the administration's top-\nsecret spying programs.\"). As the Supreme Court noted in Richmond Newspapers, \"'[w]ithout \npublicity, all other checks are insufficient: in comparison of publicity, all other checks are of \nsmall account.'\"  448 U.S. at 569 (quoting Jeremy Bentham, Rationale ofl udicial Evidence 524 \n(1827)). \nFor these reasons, public disclosure of this Court's opinions addressing the \nconstitutionality of the government's bulk collection of data and construing the meaning of \n\"relevance\" in FISA would contribute to the functioning of the FISA system and benefit the \npublic interest. Cj In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *7 (\"[M]ovants \nand amici have presented several substantial reasons why the public interest might be served by \nthe[] publication\" of FISC opinions interpreting Section 215.). In particular, release of the \nopinions requested in this proceeding would shed further light on the Court's interpretation of the \nstatutory term \"relevant,\" and it would provide the public with the Court's original Fourth \nAmendment analysis of whether and under what conditions the bulk collection of Americans' \ndata complies with the Constitution. As Senator Wyden has urged, \nThe original legal interpretation that said that the Patriot Act could be used to \ncollect Americans' records in bulk should never have been kept secret and should \nbe declassified and released .... This collection has been ongoing for years and \nthe public should be able to compare the legal interpretation under which it was \noriginally authorized with more recent documents. \nNakashima & Leonnig, supra; see also id. (Sen. Leahy: The release of \"'any additional legal \nanalysis' related to the phone records program .. . 'is exactly the sort of transparency we need in \norder to have a full and open debate about whether this program is legal and appropriate or \nneeded. \"'). \n20 \n\n*  *  * \nIn sum, because there is a longstanding American tradition of public access to judicial \nopinions; because such access positively contributes to the integrity of the judicial process, the \ndemocratic legitimacy of this Court, and the public understanding of laws passed in its name; and \nbecause the release of opinions addressing bulk collection would illuminate crucial gaps in the \npublic knowledge about the breadth of its government's surveillance activities under the statute, \nthe public's First Amendment right of access attaches to the Court's legal opinions relating to the \nbulk collection of Americans' data. \nThis Court erred in concluding otherwise in denying a 2007 public-access motion brought \nby the ACLU. First, by limiting its analysis to whether two previously published opinions of this \nCourt \"establish a tradition of public access,\" the Court took too narrow a view of the \n\"experience\" prong of the Supreme Court's test. See In re Motion/or Release a/Court Records, \n526 F. Supp. 2d at 493 (emphasis omitted). Again, \"the 'experience' test of Globe Newspaper \ndoes not look to the particular practice of anyone jurisdiction, but instead to the experience in \nthat type or kind of hearing throughout the United States.\" El Vocero, 508 U.S. at 150 (quotation \nmarks omitted). Second, the Court erred in concluding that public access would \"result in a \ndiminished flow of information, to the detriment of the process in question.\" See In re Motion/or \nRelease a/Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 496. Instead, disclosure of the requested opinions \nwould serve weighty democratic interests by informing the governed about the meaning of \npublic laws enacted on their behalf. \nB.  The First Amendment requires disclosure of the Court's opinions relating \nto bulk collection. \nAlthough the First Amendment right of access is a qualified one, judicial records that are \nsubject to the right may be kept from the public only upon a rigorous showing. Different \n21 \n\nformulations have been used by various courts to define the showing that must be made, but the \ngoverning standard applied by the Supreme Court encompasses four distinct factors: \n1.  There must be a \"substantial probability\" of prejudice to a compelling \ninterest. Anyone seeking to restrict the right of access must demonstrate a \nsubstantial probability that openness will cause harm to a compelling \ngovernmental interest. See, e.g., Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 13- 14; Press \nEnterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1983); Richmond \nNewspapers, 448 U.S. at 580-81. In Press-Enterprise II, the Court specifically \nheld that a \"reasonable likelihood\" standard is not sufficiently protective of the \nright and that a \"substantial probability\" standard must be applied. 478 U.S. at \n14-15. This standard applies equally in the context of national security. See In re \nWash. Post, 807 F.2d at 392. \n2.  There must be no alternative to adequately protect the threatened interest. \nAnyone seeking to defeat access must further demonstrate that nothing short of a \nlimitation on the constitutional right of access can adequately protect the \nthreatened interest. See Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 13-14; see also Presley v. \nGeorgia, 558 U.S. 209, 214-15  (2010) (per curiam) (,,[T]ria1 courts are required \nto consider alternatives to closure even when they are not offered by the parties\" \nand \"are obligated to take every reasonable measure to accommodate public \nattendance at criminal trials.\"); In re Herald Co., 734 F.2d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 1984) \n(A \"trial judge must consider alternatives and reach a reasoned conclusion that \nclosure is a preferable course to follow to safeguard the interests at issue. \"); \nRobinson, 935 F.2d at 290. \n3.  Any restriction on access must be narrowly tailored. Even \"legitimate and \nsubstantial\" governmental interests \"cannot be pursued by means that broadly \nstifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly \nachieved.\" Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 488 (1960). Any limitation imposed \non public access thus must be no broader than necessary to protect the threatened \ninterest. See, e.g., Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 13-14; Lugosch, 435 F.3d at \n124; Robinson, 935 F.2d at 287. \n4.  Any restriction on access must be effective. Any order limiting access must be \neffective in protecting the threatened interest for which the limitation is imposed. \nAs articulated in Press-Enterprise II, the party seeking secrecy must demonstrate \n\"that closure would prevent\" the harm sought to be avoided. 478 U.S. at 14; see \nRobinson, 935 F.2d at 291-92 (disclosure could not pose any additional threat in \nlight of already publicized information); In re Herald Co., 734 F.2d at 101 \n(closure order cannot stand if \"the information sought to be kept confidential has \nalready been given sufficient public exposure\"); United States v. Hubbard, 650 \nF.2d 293,322 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (\"One possible reason for unsealing is that the \ndocuments were already made public through other means.\"). \n22 \n\nThe party seeking to restrict access bears the burden of presenting specific facts that satisfy this \nfour-part test. See Press-Enterprise 11, 478 U.S. at 15 (\"The First Amendment right of access \ncannot be overcome by [a] conclusory assertion.\"). \nThe government cannot satisfy these strict standards in this case. The proposition that the \ngovernment has an interest-let alone a \"compelling\" one-in preventing disclosure of this \nCourt's opinions on the legality of bulk collection is insupportable. In fact, a public accounting \nof the legal review by this Court of bulk collections would serve governmental interests by \nclarifying the government's actions and the legal rationale supporting them. See Nakashima & \nLeonnig, supra (quoting current and former government officials advocating for release of \noriginal FISC bulk-collection opinion). Even the Director of National Intelligence has \ncomplained of the absence from the public debate of \"key information regarding how a classified \nintelligence collection program is used to prevent terrorist attacks and the numerous safeguards \nthat protect privacy and civil liberties,\" and underscored the importance of the public \n\"understand[ing] the limits of this targeted counterterrorism program and the principles that \ngovern its use.\" Press Release, DNI Statement on Recent Unauthorized Disclosures of Classified \nInformation, Office of the Director of National Intelligence (June 6, 2013), \nhttp://1.usa.govI13jwuFc. \nOf course, portions of the Court's opinions may be sealed to serve compelling \ngovernmental interests-for example, to protect intelligence sources and methods that have not \nbeen previously disclosed-but the First Amendment requires the Court itself to ensure that any \nredactions are narrowly tailored to serve that interest. Cf Pepsico, inc. v. Redmond, 46 F.3d 29, \n31 (7th Cir. 1995) (Easterbrook, J.) (\"The judge must make his own decision about what should \nbe confidential ... and what may be spoken of openly. I regret that this means extra work for the \n23 \n\njudge, but preserving the principle that judicial opinions are available to the public is worth at \nleast that much sacrifice.\"); Nakashima & Leonnig, supra (quoting former senior DO] attorney \nKenneth Wainstein as arguing that \"[ e ]specially when it comes to legal decisions about big \nprograms, ... we can talk about them in a sanitized way without disclosing sources and \nmethods\"). Critical to that analysis will be the numerous disclosures made to date regarding the \ngovernn1ent's bulk-collection surveillance activities. See, e.g., Doe v. Gonzales, 386 F. Supp. 2d \n66, 78 (D. Conn. 2005) (in First Amendment challenge to gag of recipient of national-security \nletter, relying in part on \"the nature and extent of information about the [national-security letter] \nthat has already been disclosed by the defendants\" in determining that \"the government has not \ndemonstrated a compelling interest in preventing disclosure of the recipient's identity\"). \nIII.  THE COURT SHOULD ORDER DECLASSIFICATION REVIEW UNDER RULE \n62 AND THEN APPLY THE FIRST AMENDMENT STANDARD TO ANY \nPROPOSED SEALING BY THE GOVERNMENT. \nIn implementing the constitutional right of access to opinions concerning the bulk \ncollection of Americans' information, the Court should first order the government to conduct a \ndeclassification review of the opinions pursuant to FISC Rule 62(a). See, e.g., In re Section 215 \nOrders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *7; Order, In re Application of the FBIfor an Order Requiring the \nProduction of Tangible Thingsfrom [Redacted}, No. BR 13-109 (Aug. 23, 2013), \nhttp://1.usa.govIl6miTkR (discussing sua sponte request by FISC judge to publish memorandum \nopinion under FISC R.P. 62(a)); In re Directives [Redacted} Pursuant to Section 105B of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 551 F.3d 1004, 1016 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2008). \nIf, after the completion of that review, the government proposes to redact any information \nin the Court's opinions, the Court should set a briefing schedule, requiring the government to \njustify how its sealing request meets the constitutional standard set out above, and allowing \nMovants to contest any sealing they believe to be unjustified. Although the Court should give \n24 \n\ndue consideration to the government's predictive judgments of harm to national security, it \nshould not simply defer to those judgments or to the results of the government's declassification \nreview. See, e.g., In re Wash. Post, 807 F.2d at 392. The First Amendment right of access is a \nconstitutional right that belongs to the public, and that right can be overcome only upon specific \nfindings by a court, including a finding that disclosure would risk a substantial probability of \nharm to a compelling interest. See supra Part I1.B. 29 \nIndependent judicial review of any proposed redactions from this Court's opinions is \nnecessary because the standards that justify classification do not always satisfy the strict \nconstitutional standard and because executive-branch decisions cannot substitute for the judicial \ndetermination required by the First Amendment. Specifically, information may be classified on a \nsimple determination by the executive branch that \"the unauthorized disclosure of [the \ninformation] reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security.\" Exec. \nOrder No. 13,526,75 Fed. Reg. 707, § 1.2(a) (Dec. 29, 2009) (emphasis added). The First \nAmendment, however, can be overcome only upon a showing of a \"substantial probability\" of \nharm, a standard that the Supreme Court has specifically held to be more stringent than a \n\"reasonable likelihood\" test. Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 14. Moreover, under the \nclassification regime, the executive branch alone decides whether to consider the public's \ninterest in disclosure, and it does so only in \"exceptional cases.\" Exec. Order No. 13,526 § \n3.I(d). Applying that standard to judicial records would flatly contradict the First Amendment \nright of access, which presumes that the public's interest is in disclosure, and permits sealing \n29  Cf Doe, 386 F. Supp. 2d at 78 (\"However, the plaintiffs' desire here is to exercise their \nFirst Amendment rights, which distinguishes this case from those in which an individual seeks \ndisclosure of information in the course of discovery or pursuant to FO IA. Here, plaintiffs seek to \nvindicate a constitutionally guaranteed right; they do not seek to vindicate a right created, and \nlimited, by statute.\"). \n25 \n\nonly if there are no less-restrictive alternatives and if the limitation on access is narrowly \ntailored. \nFurthermore, whether the public's constitutional right of access has been overcome is a \nquestion for the courts, not one that rests with the executive. See Press-Enterprise 11,478 U.S. \n13-14. As the Fourth Circuit has forcefully explained, \n[T]roubled as we are by the risk that disclosure of classified infonnation could \nendanger the lives of both Americans and their foreign informants, we are equally \ntroubled by the notion that the judiciary should abdicate its decisiomnaking \nresponsibility to the executive branch whenever national security concerns are \npresent. History teaches us how easily the spectre of a threat to \"national security\" \nmay be used to justify a wide variety of repressive government actions. A blind \nacceptance by the courts of the government's insistence on the need for secrecy, \nwithout notice to others, without argument, and without a statement of reasons, \nwould impermissibly compromise the independence of the judiciary and open the \ndoor to possible abuse. \nIn re Wash. Post, 807 F.2d at 391-92; see United States v. Hershey, 20 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A. \n1985) (\"[E]ven when the interest sought to be protected is national security, the Government \nmust demonstrate a compelling need to exclude the public ....\"  (emphasis omitted»; United \nStates v. Grunden, 2 M.J. 116, 122 (C.M.A. 1977) (although classification and the policy \ndeterminations it involves \"are not normal judicial functions, immunization from judicial review \ncannot be countenanced in situations where strong countervailing constitutional interests exist\"). \nCase law under the Classified Information Procedures Act, 18 U.S.c., App. 3 (2000) \n(\"CIP A\"), confirms that the fact of classification does not automatically trump the constitutional \nright of access. To seal classified information where CIP A is involved, the government must \nmake \"a sufficient showing that disclosure of the information sought would impair identified \nnational interests in substantial ways,\" and the court must conduct an \"independent review\" to \ndetermine that closure is \"narrowly tailored to protect national security.\" Aref, 533 F.3d at 82-\n83; see In re Wash. Post, 807 F.2d at 393 (district court not excused under CIP A \"from making \n26 \n\nthe appropriate constitutional inquiry\"); Rosen, 487 F. Supp. 2d at 710, 716-17 (a statute cannot \ndefeat a constitutional right and \"government's ipse dixit that infonnation is damaging to \nnational security is not sufficient to close the courtroom doors\"); see also United States v. \nMoussaoui, 65 F. App'x 881, 887 (4th Cir. 2003) (under CIPA procedures, courts \"must \nindependently detennine whether, and to what extent, the proceedings and documents must be \nkept under seal\"); United States v. Poindexter, 732 F. Supp. 165, 167 n.9 (D.D.C. 1990) (\"CIPA \nobviously cannot override a constitutional right of access\"); United States v. Pelton, 696 F. Supp. \n156,159 (D. Md. 1986) (same). \nIn other contexts, too, courts routinely scmtinize executive-branch classifications. See, \nus.  us. \ne.g., Campbell v.  Dep't ofJ ustice, 164 F.3d 20, 30 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Goldberg v.  Dep't \nofS tate, 818 F.2d 71, 76 (D.C. Cir. 1987). This principle is not controversial, and in other \nforums, the government has expressly accepted it. See, e.g., Final Reply Br. for Appellants at 8 \nUs. \nn.1, Ctr.for Int'l Envtl. Law v. Office of the  Trade Rep., No. 12-5136 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 27, \n2012),2012 WL 5940305 (clarifying that the government has not \"suggested that the \nExecutive's detennination that a document is classified should be conclusive or unreviewable\"). \nFor these reasons, merely ordering discretionary release under Rule 62(a) after executive \ndeclassification review would not satisfy the constitutional right of access. The Court should thus \norder declassification review as a first step and then test any sealing proposed by the government \nagainst the standard required by the First Amendment. Of course, even if the Court holds that the \nFirst Amendment right of access does not attach to the legal opinions requested by Movants, it \nshould nonetheless exercise its discretion-as it has in the past and in the public interest-to \norder the government to conduct a declassification review of its opinions pursuant to Rule 62. \nSee, e.g., In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *7. \n27 \n\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the movants respectfully request that this Court unseal its \nopinions addressing the constitutional and statutory bases for the \"bulk collection\" of records \nunder various authorities within FISA, including but not limited to 50 U.S.C. § 1842, with only \nthose limited redactions that satisfy the strict test to overcome the constitutional right of access. \nGiven the relevance of the opinions to an ongoing debate of immense public interest, Movants \nrequest expedited consideration of this motion, as well as oral argument. \nDated: November 6, 2013 \n/s/ Alex Abdo \nDavid A.

While two prior \nopinions of this Court have found jurisdiction over similar actions, neither of those opinions \nanalyzed the question addressed here.  The Presiding Judge's opinion is the first from this Court \nto address this issue, and it does so thoroughly and correctly.  The en bane Court should similarly \nfind that there is no Article III jurisdiction here. \nBACKGROUND \nIt is well-settled that there is no First Amendment public right of access to the \nproceedings, records, and rulings of this Court.  See In re Opinions & Orders of this Court \nAddressing Bulk Collection ofD  ata under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 2017 WL \n427591, at* 19-21 (FISA Ct. Jan. 25, 2017); In re Orders oft his Court Interpreting Section 215 \noft he Patriot Act, 2014 WL 5442058, at *4 n.10 (FISA Ct. Aug. 7, 2014); In re Proceedings \nRequired by§ 702(i) oft he FISA Amendments Act of 2008, 2008 WL 9487946, at *3 (FISA Ct. \nAug. 27, 2008); In re Motion for Release ofC  ourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 492-97 (FISA \nCt. 2007).  Indeed, the en bane Court in this case recognized this principle in the course of \n\nordering briefing.  See Order I, Mar. 22, 20 I 7 (ordering briefing on \"the question of whether \nMovants established Article III standing notwithstanding that a First Amendment qualified right \nof access does not apply to the judicial opinions they seek\").  This conclusion stems from a \nstraightforward application of the Supreme Court's decision in Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior \nCourt, 478 U.S. I (1986).  See also Dhiab v. Trump,_ F.3d _, 2017WLI19291 I, at *5 (D.C. \nCir. Mar. 3 I, 2017) (Op. of Randolph, J.) (observing that \"from the beginning of the republic to \nthe present day, there is no tradition of publicizing secret national security information involved \nin civil cases, or for that matter, in criminal cases,\" as the \"tradition is exactly the opposite\"). \nThis case, however, is the first in which the Court has considered the related but distinct \nquestion of whether, given that it is plain under this Court's precedent that they lack any First \nAmendment right of access or other legal right to the material they seek, movants may \nnonetheless claim an injury to a \"legally protected right'' as is necessary for Article III standing \nand thus subject-matter jurisdiction. \nI.  Prior Decisions of the Court \nThe first time this Court addressed an argument that the First Amendment provided a \nright of access to its proceedings and records, the Court rejected the movant' s argument on the \nmerits without addressing the question of Article III standing.  See In re Motion for Release of \nCourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484 (FISA Ct. 2007).  Applying the standards set forth in Press \nEnterprise, the Court found both that the movant's claim ran \"counter to a long-established and \nvirtually unbroken practice of excluding the public from FISA applications and orders,\" 526 F. \nSupp. 2d at 493, and that access would not be logical because the \"detrimental consequences\" \nfrom public access \"would greatly outweigh any\" benefits, id. at 494.  The Court's opinion in \nthat case includes a jurisdictional analysis, but that analysis addresses only whether the FISC's \n2 \n\nspecialized jurisdiction, as delineated by Congress in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \npermitted it to adjudicate the case.  Id. at 486-87.  The opinion in that case did not address \nArticle III standing. \nIn a subsequent case, in which three movants claimed a First Amendment right to certain \nopinions of this Court, the Court addressed a different aspect of Article III standing than the one \nbeing considered here, namely whether the movants' claimed injuries were sufficiently concrete \nand particularized.  See In re Orders oft his Court Interpreting Section 215 oft he Patriot Act, \n2013 WL 5460064, at *2-4 (FISA Ct. Sept. 13, 2013).  The Court found that two of the movants \nhad sufficiently particularized injuries because \"access to the [opinions] would assist\" them in \npublic debates.  Id. at *4.  The Court dismissed the third movant because the record contained \n\"no information as to how the release of the opinions would aid [that entity's] activities, or how \nthe failure to release them would be detrimental.\" Id. at *4 n.13.1  The Court did not address \nwhether any injury that may have existed was an injury to a legally protected interest. \nII.  Procedural Background \nIn the instant case, three movants sought access to \"opinions addressing the legal basis \nfor the 'bulk collection' of data.\"  Mot. for the Release of Court Records 1, Nov. 6, 2013. \nMovants argued that they had Article III standing because they had \"a concrete and \nparticularized injury.\"  Id. at l 0.  They asserted a First Amendment right of access to the \nopinions, notwithstanding earlier decisions from this Court holding that there is no First \nAmendment right of access to FISC proceedings and rulings.  See id. at 12-24.  Finally, they \n1 Subsequently, the third movant provided a declaration that explained how the \ndocuments sought would advance its mission, and the Court reinstated it as a party.  See Opinion \nand Order at 10, In re Orders oft his Court Interpreting Section 215 oft he Patriot Act, Misc. 13-\n02 (FISA Ct. Aug. 7, 2014), available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/ \nMisc%2013-02 %200rder-6_  0. pdf. \n3 \n\nargued that, in implementing the purported constitutional right of access, the Court should first \ninvoke FISC Rule 62(a), order a declassification review, and then set up another round of \nbriefing to adjudicate the government's classification decisions.  Id. at 24-25. \nIn its responsive brief, the government noted that the opinions sought by movants had all \nbeen identified (there were four) and publicly released, with only classified material redacted. \nUnited States' Opp'n to Mot. 1-2, Dec. 6, 2013.  The government argued that the movants lacked \nstanding to seek an additional classification review or FISC publication because Rule 62(a) \nprovided the movants with no rights.  Id. at 2-4.  The government further observed that both \nFISC Rule 3 and the FISC's own holdings preclude the Court from ordering the release of \ninformation that the executive branch has deemed classified.  Id. at 4-7.  The government noted \nthat Congress has provided a mechanism for judicial review of classification decisions in the \nFreedom oflnformation Act (\"FOIA\"), pursuant to which appropriate review occurs in a district \ncourt.  Id. at 4. \nIn reply, movants once again asserted their First Amendment arguments, characterizing \nboth Rule 62(a) and FOIA as not \"adequate.\"  Reply 3, Dec. 20, 2013. \nIn an extensive opinion written by the Presiding Judge, the Court addressed for the first \ntime the question of whether, in the absence of any First Amendment or other right of access to \nFISC opinions, movants can establish an injury to a legally protected interest as is required for \nArticle III standing.  Surveying numerous cases from the Supreme Court and circuit courts, this \nCourt observed that \"the Supreme Court and a majority of federal jurisdictions have concluded \nthat an interest is not 'legally protected' or cognizable for the purpose of establishing standing \nwhen its asserted legal source-whether constitutional, statutory, common law or otherwise \ndoes not apply or does not exist.\"  2017 WL 427591, at *8.  As this Court has previously held \n4 \n\nthat there is no First Amendment right of access to this Court's proceedings, records, and rulings, \nand movants had identified no other legal right to the classified material sought, movants could \nidentify no injury to a legally protected interest and thus lacked Article III standing.  Id. at *9-15. \nMovants filed a motion to alter or amend the Court's judgment.  Movants' Mot. to Alter \nor Amend the J: & for Joint Briefing with Case No. Misc. 16-0 I, Feb. 17, 2017 (\"Mot. to Alter or \nAmend\").  They argued that the Presiding Judge's opinion \"runs contrary to previous decisions \nof this Court,\" id. at 4, although the two previous decisions movants cited had not considered the \nlegal question at issue here.  See supra Part I.  Movants further appeared to argue that, even if \ntheir First Amendment claim is meritless, they should be able to use their assertion of such a \nclaim as a basis for Article Ill standing, and then use the resultant jurisdiction to ask the court to \nrelease the material sought as a matter of \"discretion[].\" Id. at 5-6. \nWhile the Court has not ruled on the Motion to Alter or Amend, it issued an order calling \nfor en bane review \"on the ground that it is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of the \ncourt's decisions.\"  Order I, Mar. 22, 2017.  The Court's en bane order states that it will only be \nreconsidering the standing question and will not be revisiting the line of cases that have \nconsistently held that there is no First Amendment right of access to FISC proceedings, records, \nand rulings.  Id. at 1 n.1. \nARGUMENT \nIt has long been recognized that \"[n]o principle is more fundamental to the judiciary's \nproper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court \njurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.''  Simon v. E. Ky.  Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, \n37 (1976).  The doctrine of standing is \"an essential and unchanging part of the case-or \ncontroversy requirement of Article III.\"  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 \n5 \n\n(1992).  To establish standing, movants must establish three elements, one of which is injury in \nfact.  \"To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show [inter alia] that he or she suffered 'an \ninvasion of a legally protected interest.\"' Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, l 36 S. Ct. 1540, 1548 (2016) \n(quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560). \nI.  Movants Lack Standing to Assert a First Amendment Claim \nAs the Presiding Judge's opinion correctly holds, \"when the source of the legal \ninterest ... does not apply or does not exist, the litigant has not established a colorable claim to a \nright that is 'legally protected' or 'cognizable' for the purpose of establishing an injury in fact \nthat satisfies Article Ill's standing requirement.\"  2017 WL 427591, at* 13 (citing cases).  Thus, \nbecause this Court has previously held that there is no First Amendment right of access to the \nproceedings, records, or rulings of this Court, movants have no \"legally protected interest\" that \nhas been injured.  Without an injury to a legally protected interest, they lack Article III standing. \nWhile the fact that a litigant may ultimately lose on the merits does not preclude a finding \nof standing, a litigant must do more than cite a rule of law and identify some relief it would like \nin order to establish jurisdiction.  Rather, there must be an actual legal right that could plausibly \napply under the circumstances alleged or presented. As the Seventh Circuit has explained, \"the \nSupreme Court's standing doctrine requires litigants to establish an injury to an interest that the \nlaw protects when it is wrongfully invaded, and this is quite different from requiring them to \nestablish a meritorious legal claim.\"  Bondv. Utreras, 585 F.3d 1061, 1073 (7th Cir. 2009) \n(internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original).  In other words, to establish standing, a \nplaintiff need not establish wrongfulness - i.e., that its legal right was unlawfully invaded - but it \nmust establish that there exists an applicable legal right that might plausibly have been invaded. \n6 \n\nThus, a plaintiff invoking the Freedom of Information Act to obtain government agency \nrecords will generally have standing even if it ultimately turns out that the documents are \nproperly exempt from disclosure; by contrast, a plaintiff who invokes FOIA to demand original \nartwork from the National Gallery of Art would lack standing, as the rights conveyed by FOIA \nplainly do not apply to such artwork.  Similarly, a plaintiff asserting a First Amendment right to \nprotest on a public sidewalk near a government building would likely have standing, while a \nplaintiff asserting a First Amendment right to sit inside the Oval Office or to attend a Supreme \nCourt deliberative conference would not. \nThe application of this principle here is straightforward.  The movants lack an injury to a \nlegally protected interest because they base their claim on a First Amendment right of access that \nsimply does not exist in this context.  To be sure, the First Amendment provides rights to \nmovants.  And those rights include a right of access to certain places.  But, as this Court has \nrepeatedly held, the First Amendment right of access does not extend to proceedings or rulings of \nthe FISC.  See Order 1, Mar. 22, 2017 (\"[A] First Amendment qualified right of access does not \napply to the judicial opinions [the Movants] seek.\").  Where, as here, a movant's claim \"has no \nfoundation in law, he has no legally protected interest and thus no standing to sue.\"  Claybrook v. \nSlater, 111 F.3d 90{ 907 (D.C. Cir. 1997). \nMovants are similarly situated to the plaintiffs in the cases described in the Presiding \nJudge's opinion in this case, in which courts found a lack of any legally protected interest, and \ntherefore a lack of Article III standing.  See 2017 WL 427591, at *9-13.  For example, in \nMcConnell v. FEC, certain plaintiffs sought to advance an equal protection right that applied in \nsome circumstances, but not in the circumstances at issue in that case.  540 U.S. 93, 227 (2003), \noverruled in part on other grounds, Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).  The Supreme \n7 \n\nCourt examined \"'the nature and source of the claim asserted,\"' and found that because the \nasserted right did not apply, the claim of injury was \"not to a legally cognizable right.\"  Id. \n(quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500 (1975)).  Thus, those plaintiffs lacked standing.  Id. \nln Bond v.  Utreras, an intervenor asserted an interest similar to the one asserted by \nmovants here, namely a right of access to documents related to a judicial proceeding.  See 585 \nF .3d 1061 (7th Cir. 2009).  The Seventh Circuit acknowledged the existence of a \"general right \nof public access to judicial records,\" but found that, because that right did not extend to the \nrecords sought by the intervenor (unfiled discovery documents), the intervenor had \"no injury to \na legally protected interest and therefore no standing.\"  Id. at 1074, 1078.  Similarly, in \nGriswold v. Driscoll, plaintiffs, like movants here, alleged a violation of their First Amendment \nrights.  616 F.3d 53 (1st Cir. 2010).  ln an opinion by Retired Justice Souter, the court held that \nbecause the First Amendment did not apply to the material at issue, the plaintiffs established \nneither standing nor a claim.  Id. at 56, 60. \nMcConnell v. FEC, Bond v.  Utreras, and Griswold v. Driscoll are just three of the many \ncases that, as this Court correctly found, support the holding in the Presiding Judge's opinion.  In \ntheir motion to alter or amend the judgment, movants cited two cases that they contend are \ncontrary.  See Mot. to Alter or Amend 5.2  But these cases are consistent with the Presiding \nJudge's opinion.  ln each of the cases relied on by movants, the court found that the asserted \nright did exist and did apply.  See Carlson v.  United States, 837 F.3d 753, 759 (7th Cir. 2016); \nDoe v. Public Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 264 (4th Cir. 2014).  lt was on this basis that the court in \nCarlson distinguished Bond v.  Utreras.  See 83 7 F .3d at 760.  Carlson and Doe are likewise \n2 Movants also argued that their injury \"is concrete and particularized.\"  Mot. To Alter or \nAmend 4 (citing cases).  This argument is a non sequitur.  Movants injury is insufficient, not \nbecause it is generalized or abstract, but because it is not an injury to a legally protected interest. \n8 \n\ndistinguishable from this case because here, movants have not asserted a right that exists and \napplies in these circumstances. \nII.  To the Extent They Assert Any Other Claims, Movants Lack Both Standing and a \nCause of Action \nIn its order inviting en bane briefing, the Court observed that \"the First Amendment \nqualified right of access was the only ground on which Movants asserted standing.\"  Order 1 n.1, \nMar.22, 2017.  The government agrees with this observation, but it appears that movants may \nnot.  In their motion to alter or amend, movants referred to \"all of Movants' claims,\" and \nchallenged what they described as the Court's conclusion that \"in the absence of a viable First \nAmendment claim, Movants also lack standing to seek relief under Rule 62 [of this Court's \nrules] and the Court's inherent supervisory powers over its own records.\"  Mot. to Alter or \nAmend 1, 5.  The arguments that movants put forward in this regard are wrong. \nBecause \"standing is not dispensed in gross,\" Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 358 n.6 \n(1996), movants \"must demonstrate standing for each claim [they] seek[] to press\" and \"for each \nform ofrelief' they seek.  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006) (quotation \nmarks omitted).  Thus, whether or not movants have standing to assert their First Amendment \nclaim (and they do not), they have to separately establish standing for each additional claim they \nmight assert in this or any case.  Because neither this Court's inherent supervisory powers nor \nRule 62 provide any cause of action or legal rights to movants, neither provides a legally \nprotected interest as would be necessary for Article III standing. \nThe Court's inherent supervisory powers obviously provide no rights to movants (or \nanyone else) and cannot support a suit or motion by movants.  An opposite conclusion would \nmean that anyone could file an action in any court to ask the court to take nearly any action with \nregard to its employees or cases.  Movants rely on In re Motion for Release of Court Records, \n9 \n\n526 F. Supp. 2d 484 (FISA Ct. 2007), but that case provides no support to their position.  There, \nthe Court held that it had inherent \"jurisdiction in the first instance to adjudicate a claim of right \nto the court's\" records even though no statute provided such jurisdiction.  Id. at 487.  The \ninherent jurisdiction was thus jurisdiction to adjudicate a claim of right, but this inherent \njurisdiction did not supply either the claim or the right.3 \nRule 62 similarly grants movants no rights and no cause of action.  That rule provides: \nThe Judge who authored an order, opinion, or other decision may sua sponte or on \nmotion by a party request that it be published.  Upon such request, the Presiding \nJudge, after consulting with other Judges of the Court, may direct that an order, \nopinion or other decision be published.  Before publication, the Court may, as \nappropriate; direct the Executive Branch to review the order, opinion, or other \ndecision and redact it as necessary to ensure that properly classified information is \nappropriately protected pursuant to Executive Order 13526 (or its successor). \nFISC Rule 62(a). \nMovants, of course, are neither the authoring judge of any opinion nor parties to any of \nthe underlying cases at issue.  See In re Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *5 (holding that \"the term \n'party' in Rule 62(a) refers to a party to the proceeding that resulted in the 'opinion, order, or \nother decision' being considered for publication\").  Thus, movants can claim no \"legally \nprotected interest\" stemming from Rule 62.  Without such an interest, they can have no standing \nto invoke the rule.  Additionally, the rule does not provide them with any cause of action. \nMovants' argument that this Court's holding in this case \"render[s] the relief afforded by \nRule 62 all but illusory,\" Mot. to Alter or Amend 6, misunderstands the nature of Rule 62.  It is a \nrule of procedure for litigation pending before the Court, not a substantive right for the general \n3 Notably, the Court in that case specifically declined to rule on whether it possessed \n\"residual discretion\" to release any records.  The Court held that even if it had such discretion, it \nwould decline to exercise it \"because of the serious negative consequences that might ensue.\" \n526 F. Supp. 2d at 497.  The Court ruled against the movants as to all claims.  See id. \n10 \n\npublic.  Like most rules of procedure, it governs the parties in cases and does not provide rights \nor a cause of action to other individuals or entities. \nMovants also argue that this Court's holding is \"in tension with the canon of \nconstitutional avoidance, because it would require the FISC to resolve constitutional questions \n(as it did here) before considering the non-constitutional ground for relief presented by \nMovants.\" Id.  But there is no \"non-constitutional ground for relief' here, because Rule 62 does \nnot provide any rights or cause of action to movants.  Moreover, the canon of constitutional \navoidance does not allow a court to assert jurisdiction in instances where Article III of the \nConstitution does not permit it.4 \n4 There is an additional basis for rejecting any \"claim\" for discretionary dissemination. \nAll of the unclassified material sought in this case has been released.  The only remaining \nresponsive material is classified.  This Court does not release classified material to the public. \nFISC Rule 3; cf Dhiab, 2017 WL 1192911, at *5 (\"One may be confident that over many years \nnone of the members of our court, past or present, ever supposed that in complying with [rules \ngoverning handling of classified material], we were somehow violating the Constitution.\"). \nOf course, \"there is no role for this Court independently to review, and potentially \noverride, Executive Branch classification decisions.''  Motion/or Release, 526 F. Supp. 2d at \n491; accord Dep 't oft he Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 529 (1988) (\"For reasons too obvious to \ncall for enlarged discussion, the protection of classified information must be committed to the \nbroad discretion of the agency responsible.'') (citation, quotation marks, and alteration omitted); \nBismullah v. Gates, 501 F.3d 178, 187-88 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\"[I]t is within the role of the \nexecutive to acquire and exercise the expertise of protecting national security [and] [i]t is not \nwithin the role of the courts to second-guess executive judgments made in furtherance of that \nbranch's proper role.''). \n11 \n\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, and the reasons stated in the Presiding Judge's opinion in this \ncase, movants lack Article III standing, and this action should be dismissed for want of \njurisdiction. \nApril 17, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \nMARY B.

SAYLOR, DEARIE, RUSSELL, JONES, and \nCONTRERAS: \nFiguring out whether a plaintiff has standing to bring a novel legal claim can feel a bit like \ntrying to distinguish a black cat in a coal cellar.  \"Although the two concepts unfortunately are \nblurred at times, standing and entitlement to relief are not the same thing. Standing is a prerequisite \nto filing suit, while the underlying merits of a claim ... determine whether the plaintiff is entitled \nto relief.\"  Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 794-95 (7th Cir. 2008).  The Initial Opinion in this \naction decided that Movants - the American Civil Liberties Union and Yale Law School's Media \nFreedom and Information Access Clinic - had suffered no injury-in-fact and thus lacked st~nding \nto bring their First Amendment claim for access to redacted portions of certain of this Court's \nopinions.  Sitting en bane for the first time in our history, we now vacate that decision.  Whatever \nthe merits ofMovants' suit, we conclude that they have asserted a sufficient injury-in-fact to pursue \nit. \n\nI.  Background \nBy necessity, this Court conducts much of its work in secrecy.  But it does so within a \njudicial system wedded to transparency and deeply rooted in the ideal that \"justice must satisfy the \nappearance of justice.\"  Levine v. United States, 362 U.S. 610, 616 (1960). \nIt comes as no surprise, then, that members of the public may at times seek to challenge \nwhether certain controversies merit our continued secrecy or, instead, require some degree of \ntransparency.  The matter before us was born from two such challenges.  On June 6, 2013, two \nnewspapers  released  certain classified information about  a surveillance  program run  by the \nGovernment since 2006.  Within a day, the Director of National Intelligence declassified further \ndetails about this bulk-data-collection program, acknowledging for the first time that this Court \nhad approved much of it under Section 215 -the \"business records\" provision-ofthe Patriot Act, \nu.s.c. \n50  § 1861. \nVery shortly thereafter, Movants filed a motion in this Court asking that we unseal our \n\"opinions evaluating the meaning, scope, and constitutionality of Section 215.\"  FISC No. Misc. \n13-02, Motion of June 2, 2013. They argued that, because officials had now \"revealed the essential \ndetails of the program,\" there was no  legitimate interest in continuing to  withhold its  legal \njustification.  Id. at 18.  Movants thus contended that their First Amendment right of access to \ncourt proceedings and documents, as recognized by the Supreme Court in Richmond Newspapers. \nInc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980), now compelled the release of these rulings.  Id. at 6-15. \nThey alternatively  asked  that we  invoke  FISC  Rule  of Procedure  62(a)  to  request that the \nGovernment review the opinions' classification and publish any declassified portions.  Id. at 15-\n18. \n-2-\n\nJudge Saylor opted for the latter discretionary route in this first action.  In re Orders of this \nCourt Interpreting Sec. 215 of the Patriot Act, No. Misc. 13-02, 2013 WL 5460064 (Foreign Intel. \nSurv. Ct.  Sept.  13, 2013).  Before doing so, however, he concluded that Movant ACLU had \nestablished Article III standing to pursue its First Amendment challenge, as its asserted injury \nsatisfied the familiar tripartite standing requirement - i.e., it was \"concrete, particularized, and \nactual or imminent;  fairly traceable to  the challenged action;  and redressable by a favorable \nruling.\"  Id. at *2 (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013)).  More \nspecifically, he reasoned that, because the ACLU had alleged that the continued withholding of \nour opinions violated its First Amendment right of access to them, its claimed injury was  I) \n\"actual,\" as the opinions were not available, 2) \"traceable\" to the Government's decision not to \nmake them public, and 3) redressable by \"this Court's directing that those opinions be published.\" \nId.  Judge Saylor also determined that the injury was sufficiently particularized because Movants \nwere \"active particip[ ants] in the legislativ,e and public debates about the proper scope of Section \n215,\" and the withheld information would assist them in these conversations. Id. at *4. Ultimately, \nhowever, he did not reach the merits of their First Amendment claim, choosing instead to order \nthe Executive Branch under Rule 62( a) to conduct a declassification review of certain of our prior \nopinions.  Id. at *8. \nAround  the  same  time,  the  Government  released  more  details  about  the  bulk-data \ncollection program, including a white paper that explained how FISC Judges had periodically \napproved the directives to telecommunications providers to produce bulk telephonic metadata for \nuse  in  the  Government's  counterterrorism  efforts.  See  Administration  White  Paper:  Bulk \nCollection of Telephony Metadata Under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act (Aug. 9, 2013). \nThis Court, too, took steps to make more information available to the public.  In particular, we \n- 3 -\n\nasked the Executive Branch to review several of our opinions, and we released redacted versions \nof two about the collection of bulk telephony metadata under Section 215. In re Opinions & Orders \nof this Court Addressing Bulk Collection of Data under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nNo. Misc. 13-08, 2017 WL 427591, at *2-3 (FISC Jan. 25, 2017). \nWhile these revelations may have slaked some ofMovants' thirst for information, they also \nopened up new lines of inquiry.  Movants thus filed another motion - which kicked off the current \naction - on November 7, 2013, asking us to unseal classified sections of our opinions laying out \nthe legal basis for the data collection.  See Movants'  Motion of Nov. 7, 2013, available at \nhttp://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Misc%2013-08%20Motion-2. pdf.  Here,  again, \nthey claimed that these passages were \"subject to the public's First Amendment right of access\" \nand should be released because \"no proper basis exists to keep the legal discussions in [them] \nsecret.\"  Id. at 1.  They further contended that we should once more exercise our discretion under \nRule 62(a) to ask for a second classification review by the Government and then verify ~hat its \nresponse complied with the dictates of the First Amendment.  Id. at 24-27. \nOn  November  18,  2013,  however,  while  briefing  was  ongoing  on  this  issue,  the \nGovernment published two more redacted opinions by this Court.  In re Opinions & Orders of this \nCourt Addressing Bulk Collection of Data under FISA, 2017 WL 427591, at *3.  Including the \nprevious pair we had already released, these four opinions constituted all of our rulings that were \nresponsive to Movants' second Motion.  In other words, before the Government had even filed an \nOpposition, the relevant opinions had been \"subjected to classification review and the unclassified \nportions released\" with - according to the Government - \"as much information ... as possible \nconsistent with national security.\"  Opp. of Dec. 6, 2013, at 2. \n-4-\n\nGiven such release, the Government's subsequent Opposition argued that the Court should \nnow dismiss Movants' second action.  Any further review, it maintained, would merely \"duplicate \nthe[se] result[s],\" and there was \"no basis for th[is] Court to order [it].\" Id.  The Government also \ncontended that Movants lacked standing to seek such relief because Rule 62(a) allowed only a \nparty to the proceeding that generated the opinion to move for publication, and Movants had not \nbeen involved in the underlying actions.  Id. at 2-3.  Finally, the Government urged this Court not \nto order yet another review since Movants could challenge the classification decisions through a \nFreedom of Information Act case in federal district court.  Id. at 3-4. \nOn January 25, 2017,  in a  lengthy and thoughtful  Opinion,  Presiding Judge  Collyer \ndetermined that Movants had no standing to press their case, and she thus dismissed it.  See In re \nOpinions & Orders of this Court Addressing Bulk Collection of Data under FISA, 2017 WL \n* \n427 591, at  1.  Her Opinion focused in particular on a potential standing problem that the parties \nhad not previously identified - namely, whether Movants had alleged the invasion of a \"legally \nand judicially cognizable\" interest sufficient to establish the injury-in-fact prong of the standing \nanalysis.  Id. at *7.  The Court first took the position that an interest was not legally protected \n\"when its asserted legal source - whether constitutional, statutory, common law or otherwise -\ndoes not apply or does not exist.\"  Id. at *8. \nOn this basis, the Court then engaged in a lengthy merits analysis ofMovants' claim under \nthe  Richmond  Newspapers  \"experience  and  logic\"  test  to  determine  whether  such  a  First \n* \nAmendment right existed in the unique context of FISC judicial proceedings.  Id.  at  16-21. \nAlthough the Constitution does not expressly provide for access to judicial records, in Richmond \nNewspapers, the Supreme Court \"firmly established for the first time that the press and general \npublic have a constitutional right of access to criminal trials.\"  Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior \n- 5 -\n\nCourt, 457 U.S. 596, 603 (1982).  Since then, it has extended this right to other judicial processes, \nbut has also recognized that such a First Amendment right of access is not absolute.  Id. at 607. \nRather, to determine whether the public has a right of access to particular judicial proceedings, \ncourts must ask two questions: \"whether the place and process have historically been open to the \npress and general public\" (the experience inquiry) and \"whether public access plays a significant \npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question\" (the logic inquiry).  Press \nEnterprise Co. v. Superior Court (Press Enterprise II), 478 U.S. 1, 8 (1986).  Applying this test, \nJudge Collyer in this case ultimately answered both prongs in the negative, and she therefore \nconcluded that the right of access did not extend to FISC judicial proceedings.  In re Opinions & \nOrders of this Court Addressing Bulk Collection of Data under FISA, 2017 WL 427591, at *16-\n21.  For this reason alone, the Court then held that Movants had not alleged a sufficient injury-in \nfact and thus lacked standing to bring their claim.  Id. at *21. \nMovants quickly moved for reconsideration.  As the resolution of the first and second \nactions had created an intra-court split on the standing issue, we sua sponte granted en bane review \nto reconsider the narrow question of whether Movants have asserted a sufficient injury-in-fact for \nstanding purposes.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1803(a)(2)(A); FISC R. P. 45 (allowing the Court to order a \nhearing or rehearing en  bane if \"necessary to secure and maintain uniformity of the Court's \ndecisions\").  After substantial and reasoned debate and discussion among all eleven judges of this \nCourt, we now answer that inquiry in the affirmative. \nII.  Analysis \nArticle III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to actual \"Cases\" and \n\"Controversies.\" U.S. Const., art. III,§ 2.  But not just any dispute will do.  See Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559-61 (1992). The Constitution instead confines the judiciary to deciding \n-6-\n\ncontests that are \"appropriately resolved through the judicial process,\" as distinguished from those \nbetter left to the legislative or executive branches in a democratic government.  Id. at 560 (quoting \nWhitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990)).  Standing doctrine helps police this boundary \nby requiring, as an \"irreducible constitutional minimum,\" that a plaintiff establish three elements \nto proceed with a claim: 1) an injury-in-fact that is 2) caused by the conduct complained of and 3) \n\"likely\" to be \"redressed by a favorable decision.\"  Id. at 560-61 (quotations omitted). \nThe focus here is on the first prong.  A term of art, an injury-in-fact is the \"invasion of a \nlegally protected interest which is both (a) concrete and particularized; and (b) actual or imminent, \nnot conjectural, or hypothetical.\"  Id. at 560 (footnote, internal citations, and quotation omitted). \nFor the purposes of evaluating whether a plaintiff has made this showing, though, \"we must assume \n[Movants'] claim has legal validity.\"  Cooksey v.  Futrell, 721  F.3d 226, 239 (4th Cir. 2013) \n(quotation omitted).  Put another way, in deciding whether Movants have alleged a sufficient \ninjury-in-fact for standing purposes, we \"must be careful not to decide the question on the merits \nfor or against [Movants], and must therefore assume that on the merits the [Movants] would be \nsuccessful in their claims.\"  City of Waukesha v. EPA, 320 F.3d 228, 235 (D.C. Cir. 2003); see \nalso Citizen Ctr. v.  Gessler, 770 F.3d 900, 910 (10th Cir. 2014) (same); Parker v.  District of \nColumbia, 478 F.3d 370, 377 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\"The Supreme Court has made clear that when \nconsidering whether a plaintiff has Article III standing, a federal court must assume arguendo the \nmerits of his or her legal claim.\"), affd sub nom. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 \n(2008); see also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501-02 (1975) (assuming validity of legal theory \nfor purposes of standing analysis). \nStarting from the premise that Movants' claim is meritorious means that we must assume \nthat withholding our classified opinions violates their First Amendment right of access to judicial \n-7-\n\nproceedings under the Richmond Newspapers test.  From this base, we can readily conclude that \nthis injury is \"concrete,\" as well as \"actual,\" because the opinions are currently not available to \nthem.  For  at  least  the  reasons  articulated  by  Judge  Saylor,  moreover,  it  is  sufficiently \n\"particularized\" from  that of the public because of Movants' active participation in ongoing \ndebates about the legal validity of the bulk-data-collection program. \nThe Initial Opinion, of course, did not quibble with these conclusions, but instead homed \nin on the prefatory language of the definition of what constitutes an injury-in-fact. While not every \nSupreme Court decision even specifies that an alleged injury-in-fact must be to a \"legally protected \ninterest,\" see. e.g., Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409, the Opinion correctly pointed out that some cases \nhave treated this as an independent requirement to establish standing in appropriate circumstances. \nBut from this starting point, the Initial Opinion faltered in concluding that Movants had alleged no \nlegally protected interest because the First Amendment's right of access to court proceedings \"did \nnot apply\" to FISC Opinions.  In re Opinions & Orders of this Court Addressing Bulk Collection \nof Data under FISA, 2017 WL 427591, at *21. \nAs courts have repeatedly affirmed, \"For purposes of standing, the question [simply] \ncannot be whether the Constitution, properly interpreted, extends protection to the plaintiffs \nasserted right or interest.\"  Initiative & Referendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 F.3d 1082, 1092 (10th \nCir.  2006) (en  bane) (emphasis added).  \"If that were the test, every losing claim would be \ndismissed for want of standing.\" Id.; see also Ass'n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs .. Inc. v. Camp, \n397 U.S. 150, 153 & n.1 (2003) (admonishing against use of\"legal interest\" test as part of standing \nanalysis when it goes to merits of claim).  We must instead assume that Movants are correct that \nthey have a constitutional right of access, Waukesha, 320 F.3d at 235 - so long as that right is \ncognizable.  That is, we ask only whether courts are capable of knowing or recognizing such an \n- 8 -\n\ninterest. See Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"cognizable\" as \"[c  ]apable of being \nknown or recognized\"); see also Judicial Watch. Inc. v. U.S. Senate, 432 F.3d 359, 364 (D.C. Cir. \n2005) (Williams, J ., concurring) (explaining Supreme Court uses terms \"legally protected\" and \n\"judicially  cognizable\"  interchangeably  \"( 1)  to  encompass  the  other  conventionally  stated \nrequirements (that the injury be concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent) and (2) \npossibly to serve as a screen (perhaps open-ended) against interests that it would make little sense \nto treat as adequate\"). \nA plaintiff, for instance, might lack standing \"to complain about his inability to commit \ncrimes because no one has a right to a commit a crime,\" and no Court could recognize such an \ninterest.  Citizen Ctr. v. Gessler, 770 F.3d 900, 910 (10th Cir. 2014).  On the other hand, he would \nhave standing to bring colorable First Amendment claims, even if he would ultimately lose on the \nmerits.  Take the seminal example of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976).  There, the Supreme \nCourt allowed plaintiffs to attack campaign-finance laws as unconstitutional, even though, as it \nturned  out,  there  is  no  specific  \"First  Amendment  right  to  make  unlimited  campaign \ncontributions.\"  Initiative & Referendum Inst., 450 F.3d at 1092-93 (citing Buckley, 424 U.S. at \n96).  As the Tenth Circuit noted, \"We could use any unsuccessful constitutional claim to illustrate \nthe point.\"  Id. at 1092.  Indeed, were we to define rights with any greater level of specificity, no \nplaintiff would have standing to challenge established First Amendment precedent.  This  is \ncertainly not the case.  See. e.g., Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310,. 365-66 (2010) (overturning \nprecedent that upheld restrictions on corporate independent expenditures). \nAt bottom, the legally-protected-interest test is not concerned with determining the proper \nscope of the First Amendment right or whether a plaintiff is correct that such right has in fact been \ninvaded; that is a merits inquiry. Waukesha, 320 F.3d at 235. The test instead seeks only to assess \n-9-\n\nwhether the interest asserted by the plaintiff is of the type that \"deserve[s] protection against \ninjury.\"  13  Charles  Alan  Wright,  Arthur R.  Miller,  et  al.,  Federal  Practice  &  Procedure \n§ 3531.4 (3d ed. 2008). \nAgainst this backdrop, the sufficiency of Movants' allegation of such a legally protected \ninterest appears clear.  They identify the invasion of an interest - the First Amendment right to \naccess judicial proceedings - that courts have repeatedly held is capable of \"being known or \nrecognized.\"  The Supreme Court first acknowledged that this interest is one the Constitution \nprotects against wrongful invasion in Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. 555, when a plurality held \nthat  the  public's  \"right  to  attend  criminal  trials  is  implicit  in  the  guarantees  of the  First \nAmendment.\"  Id. at 580 (footnote omitted).  Since then, that Court has also held that this right \nsafeguards  the  public's  qualified  access  to  other  criminal  proceedings,  including  witness \ntestimony, Globe Newspaper, 457 U.S. at 603-11, voir dire, Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court \n(Press Enterprise I), 464 U.S. 501, 505-10 (1984), and preliminary hearings.  Press Enterprise II, \n478 U.S. at 10-15. \nMany federal Courts of Appeals have likewise held this legally protected interest invaded \nwhen the public is walled off from other aspects of criminal trials, such as bail, plea, or sentencing \nhearings.  See. e.g., N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 297-98 (2d \nCir. 2012) (collecting cases); In re Wash. Post Co., 807 F.2d 383, 388-89 (4th Cir. 1986) (plea and \nsentencing hearings);  In re  Hearst Newspapers.  LLC,  641  F.3d  168,  175-86 (5th Cir.  2011) \n(sentencing). Finally, at least six Circuits have concluded that the First Amendment qualified right \nof access also extends to \"civil trials and to their related proceedings and records.\"  N.Y. Civil \nLiberties Union, 684 F.3d at 298 (emphasis added) (so holding and collecting cases from the Third, \nFourth, Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits). \n- 10 -\n\nThese cases all demonstrate that Movants, in asserting a First Amendment right of access \nto judicial processes, are seeking to vindicate \"the sort of interest that the law protects when it is \nwrongfully invaded.\" Aurora Loan Servs .. Inc. v. Craddieth, 442 F.3d 1018, 1024 (7th Cir. 2006) \n(emphases modified).  No more than this is necessary for standing purposes, even if Movants \nultimately fail to prove that the precise scope of the First Amendment right extends to redacted \nportions of our judicial opinions under the Richmond Newspapers test.  The dissent, by contrast, \nwould require Plaintiffs to make that more specific showing at the standing stage - an inquiry that \nwould swallow any merits determination on the First Amendment's contours.  It is erroneous to \nunderstand the cognizable-interest requirement as \"beg[ging] the question of the legal validity of \nthe[ir] claim.\"  Initiative & Referendum Inst., 450 F.3d at 1093 n.3.  Rather, as the Tenth Circuit \nsitting en bane has instructed, courts must avoid any such \"mischief' inherent in \"us[ing] standing \nconcepts to address the question whether the plaintiff has stated a claim.\" Id. (quoting 13 Wright \n& Miller, § 3531.4 (2d ed. Supp. 2005)). \nOur  conclusion  that  Movants  have  met  this  cognizable-interest  requirement  is  also \nconsistent with the approach adopted by every Circuit to consider a similar claim.  As far as we \ncan tell, courts have uniformly found standing to bring a First Amendment right-of-access suit so \nlong as plaintiffs allege an invasion related to judicial proceedings. That is so no matter how novel \nor meritless the claim may be.  Some courts have stretched the right-of-access even farther for \nstanding purposes.  In Flynt v. Rumsfeld, 355 F.3d 697 (D.C. Cir. 2004), for example, journalists \ncreatively contended that they had a First Amendment right of access to travel with military \ncombat units to cover the war in Afghanistan.  Id. at 698.  Although the D.C. Circuit ultimately \nheld that \"no such constitutional right exists\" - in fact, having deemed Richmond Newspapers \nentirely inapplicable - it nevertheless easily concluded that plaintiffs had standing to bring their \n- 11 -\n\nsuit. Id. at 698, 702-04. This was the case even though the journalists' desire to embed with troops \nwas much farther afield from the core Richmond Newspapers right than the one Movants hope to \nestablish today.  Here, they ask only to extend the public's right of access to another Article III \ncontext - i.e., FISC judicial proceedings. \nThe dissent criticizes the Court of Appeals' analysis in flym, see post at 20, but its dislike \nof the decision does not diminish its import.  In any event, the D.C. Circuit does not stand alone \nin its approach.  The Seventh Circuit, for example, has considered a historian's standing to bring \na common-law right-of-access claim to sealed grand-jury materials.  See Carlson v. United States, \n837 F.3d 753, 757-61 (7th Cir. 2016). The plaintiff, it reasoned, \"need[ed] only a 'colorable claim' \nto a right to access these documents, because '[w]ere we to require more than a colorable claim, \nwe would decide the merits of the case before satisfying ourselves of standing.\"'  Id.  at 758 \n(internal citation omitted); see also Okla. Observer v. Patton, 73 F. Supp. 3d 1318, 1321-22, 1325 \n(W.D. Okla. 2014) (holding plaintiffs had standing to bring First Amendment right-of-access claim \nto view executions, but dismissing suit as right did \"not extend to the circumstances existing \nhere\"); United States v. Ring, 47 F. Supp. 3d 38, 41-42 (D.D.C. 2014) (holding criminal defendant \nhad standing to  sue for public access to PowerPoint presentation used during proffer session \ndespite holding on merits that \"neither a common law nor First Amendment right of access\" \nattached to the record). \nMany courts - including the Supreme Court - have not even felt it necessary to address \nstanding in dealing with tenuous right-of-access claims, despite judges' obligation to raise sua \nsponte any jurisdictional defects.  Indeed, courts have routinely ignored what the dissent would \nbelieve is a serious question, even while expressly addressing their jurisdiction in other respects. \nFor example, the Fourth and Sixth Circuits rejected mootness challenges to suits asserting a First \n- 12 -\n\nAmendment right of access to search-warrant proceedings, despite ultimately deciding that the \nplaintiffs had no such right to these sealed records under the Richmond Newspapers test.  See In \nre Search of Fair Finance, 692 F.3d 424, 428-29, 433 (6th Cir. 2012) (finding claim not moot); \nBait. Sun Co. v. Goetz, 886 F.2d 60, 63-65 (4th Cir. 1989) (same).  Mootness, of course, shares a \ncommon undergirding with standing: \"[T]he requisite personal interest that must exist at the \ncommencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness).\" \nFriends of the Earth. Inc. v.  Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC). Inc., 528 U.S.  167,  189 \n(2000) (quoting Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 68 n.22 (1997)).  To \nsurvive a mootness challenge, then, the plaintiffs must have necessarily demonstrated that the \nrequisite personal injury existed at least in the first instance.  Even more recently, in Phillips v. \nDeWine, 841F.3d405 (6th Cir. 2016), the Sixth Circuit rejected a much more farfetched challenge \nby inmates to the constitutionality of Ohio's \"statutory scheme concerning the confidentiality of \ninformation related to lethal injection.\" Id. at 410, 419-20.  At the outset, the court concluded that \nthe plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their free-speech and prior-restraint causes of action, as their \nasserted injuries were too hypothetical.  But it apparently had no similar concern as to their First \nAmendment right-of-access claim, holding instead on the merits that no such right existed.  Id. at \n417-20. \nA long list of courts have acted in this fashion.  See. e.g., Houchins v. KQED, Inc., 438 \nU.S. 1, 7-15 (1978) (holding First Amendment provides the media no right of access to county jail, \nbut never questioning standing); Dhiab v. Trump, 852 F.3d 1087, 1096 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (holding \nplaintiffs have no \"right under the First Amendment to receive properly classified national security \ninformation filed\" in habeas action, but not questioning standing); Wood v. Ryan, 759 F.3d 1076, \n1088 (9th Cir. 2014) (Bybee, J. , dissenting) (criticizing \"majority's newfound right of access\" for \n- 13 -\n\ndeath row inmate seeking information on method of his execution as \"dramatic extension of \nanything\" previously recognized, but never questioning standing), vacated, 135 S. Ct. 21 (mem.) \n(summarily vacated on merits, not standing); In re U.S. for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section \n2703(0),  707  F.3d 283,  291-92  (4th  Cir.  2013)  (holding no  First Amendment right under \nRichmond Newspapers to court orders and proceedings pursuant to Stored Communications Act, \nbut never questioning standing); In re N. Y. Times Co. to Unseal Wiretap, 577 F .3d 40 I, 409-11 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (rejecting, under Richmond Newspapers, newspaper's request to unseal wiretap \napplications and related materials, but not questioning standing to bring novel claim); Calder v. \nIRS, 890 F.2d 781, 783-84 (5th Cir. 1989) (applying Richmond Newspapers and holding plaintiff \nhad no  First Amendment or statutory right of access to  IRS  records, but never questioning \nstanding).  Although we do not directly rely on any of these cases, we find the uniformity is telling. \nSimilarly, two former judges of this Court also found it unnecessary to call standing into \ndoubt when rejecting claims premised on the public's right of access to FISC records, see In re \nProceedings Required by §  702(i) of PISA Amendments Act of 2008, No.  08-01, 2008 WL \n9487946 (FISC Aug. 27, 2008) (McLaughlin, J.); In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 \nF. Supp. 2d 484 (FISC 2007) (Bates, J.), and, as explained above, Judge Saylor expressly held that \nplaintiffs did have standing to bring such claims under the First Amendment in Movants' first \naction.  See In re Orders of this Court Intemreting Section 215 of the Patriot Act, No. 13-02, 2013 \nWL 5460064, at *2-4 (FISC Sept. 13, 2013). \nThe Initial Opinion, by contrast, relies on no case that concludes that a plaintiff lacks a \nlegally cognizable interest, and thus standing, simply because that party cannot show a First \nAmendment right of access applies or exists in the context of the judicial proceeding at issue.  The \nbest it could muster is a single case where the plaintiff sought a common-law right of access to \n- 14 -\n\ndiscovery materials.  Bond v. Utreras, 585 F.3d 1061, 1074 (7th Cir. 2009).  The Seventh Circuit \nheld that these discovery files - exchanged between parties - \"had never been filed with the court \nand [had] never influenced the outcome of a judicial proceeding.\" Id.  Whatever the merits of that \ndecision, it provides no guidance here, where Plaintiffs seek material far more rooted in judicial \nproceedings: our opinions.  Perhaps recognizing Bond as thin support, the dissent relegates that \ncase to a footnote.  Otherwise, no case appears throughout its 25 pages in which any court declined \nto find standing in like circumstances.  This lack of precedential support speaks volumes. \nAt times, the dissent suggests a variant justification for dismissing the suit: it sees \"no legal \nbasis to find that Movants present a colorable claim.\"  Post at 13 (emphasis added); see also id. at \n17 n.16 (\"In the instant matter, the question is whether Movants have a colorable right under the \nFirst Amendment to access information in FISC opinions that the Executive Branch determined \nwas classified.\"). This alternative argument seems decidedly weaker to us. Courts have repeatedly \nset an exceedingly low bar to establish colorability.  See Kennedy v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 924 \nF .2d 698, 700 (7th Cir. 1991) (holding only if claim is \"frivolous is jurisdiction lacking\"); Panaras \nv. Liguid Carbonic Indus. Cor_p., 74 F.3d 786, 790 (7th Cir. 1996) (describing the requirement as \n\"not ... stringent\").  Under this colorability standard, only \"a plaintiff whose claimed legal right \nis so preposterous as to be legally frivolous may lack standing on the ground that the right is not \n'legally protected.\"'  Initiative & Referendum Inst., 450 F.3d at 1093.  Whatever the merits of \nMovants' First Amendment right-of-access claim, it finds its basis in well-established law.  The \nright to access, even in its more narrow formulation, at least covers \"a right of access to certain \ncriminal [and civil] proceedings and the documents filed in those proceedings.\" Phillips, 841 F.3d \nat 418.  Movants merely allege that those \"certain\" documents include our FISC opinions - i.e., \nopinions filed in an Article III judicial proceeding.  This asserted right is certainly more analogous \n- 15 -\n\nto the historical right than - for example - a claim that the First Amendment also grants access to \ntravel with troop battalions on a foreign battlefield.  Yet, in flmt, 355 F.3d 697, the D.C. Circuit \nnever mentioned that it might be frivolous to consider such an extension. In fact, the dissent points \nto no federal court that has ever dismissed as frivolous a novel claim seeking to extend the First \nAmendment right of access to a new judicial process.  We decline to be the first. \nThe dissent also suggests our analysis should differ because Plaintiffs seek \"classified \ninformation.\"  Post at 24 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It is true that courts rarely presume \nto review the Executive Branch's decisionmaking, at least without a statutory hook.  See Dep't of \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 538 (1988).  Yet the classified information here is not housed in the \nExecutive Branch; instead, it arises within an Article III proceeding, and Plaintiffs seek access to \nportions of judicial opinions.  As explained above, the right to access judicial proceedings is well \nestablished.  Courts have thus not hesitated to review claims involving secret court proceedings, \neven when they ultimately find good reason to deny them.  See In re Search of Fair Finance, 692 \nF.3d at 428-29, 433 (sealed search warrants); Goetz, 886 F.2d at 63-65 (same); In re N.Y. Times \nCo. to Unseal Wiretap, 577 F.3d at 409-11 (sealed wiretap applications). \nNor do we agree with the dissent that we should change our conclusion simply because we \nconsider a constitutional challenge involving the Executive Branch.  See post at 23-25.  Even if \nthe Supreme Court applies an \"especially rigorous\" standing analysis in this context, Raines v. \nByrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819-20 ( 1997), it has never suggested such an analysis would involve jumping \nto the merits of the dispute.  More to the point, the dissent cites Clapper v. Amnesty International, \n568 U.S. 398 (2013), which noted that courts have declined to find standing when reviewing \n\"actions of the political branches in the fields of intelligence gathering and foreign affairs.\"  Post \n- 16 -\n\nat 23-24 (quoting Clapper, 568 U.S. at 469).  Although that decision admittedly contains some \nbroad language, none offers much insight into the standing question posed here. \nIn Clapper, the Supreme Court considered a separate facet of the injury-in-fact test -\nnamely,  whether the  plaintiffs'  theory of future  injury was  too  speculative  to  be \"certainly \nimpending.\"  Id. at 409.  In fact, Clapper's definition of what constitutes an injury-in-fact did not \neven include the requirement of a \"legally protected\" interest upon which the Initial Opinion relies \nhere.  Id. at 409 (\"To establish Article III standing, an injury must be 'concrete, particularized, and \nactual or imminent;  fairly traceable to the challenged action;  and redressable by a favorable \nruling.\"') (citation omitted).  Clapper, then, does not impose any special standing requirement on \nthis score; in fact, it might be better read to impose no such showing at all.  Schuchardt v. President \nof the United States, 839 F.3d 336, 348 n.8 (3d Cir. 2016) (\"Despite Clapper's observation that \nthe standing inquiry is especially rigorous in matters touching on intelligence gathering and foreign \naffairs,\" no court has held that \"'Article III imposes [a] heightened standing requirement for the \noften  difficult  cases  that  involve  constitutional  claims  against  the  executive  involving \nsurveillance.\"') (quoting Jewel v. NSA, 673 F.3d 902, 913 (9th Cir. 2011)) (internal quotations \nfrom Clapper omitted)).  In any event, the claim presented here survives because the injury is a \nlack of access to the proceedings of a court, rather than one directly traceable to the activities of \nthe political branches in intelligence gathering or foreign affairs. \n* * * \nAt the end of the day, the question that the Initial Opinion asked and answered is not one \nof standing.  It instead goes to the merits of Movants' legal claim - i.e., whether they have a \nqualified right of access under the First Amendment to portions of our opinions redacted by the \nExecutive Branch under its classification authority.  See Arreola, 546 F.3d at 794-95 (\"Although \n- 17 -\n\nthe two concepts unfortunately are blurred at times, standing and entitlement to relief are not the \nsame thing.\").  As that is not what concerns us today, we hold that Movants have sufficiently \nalleged the invasion of a legally cognizable interest as necessary to establish an injury-in-fact. \nWhether or not they will ultimately succeed in establishing that the  Richmond Newspapers \nexperience-and-logic test entitles them to relief, we believe that they should not be barred at this \nthreshold  procedural  stage.  We  further  offer  no  opinion  on  whether  other jurisdictional \nimpediments exist to this challenge, but hold only that Movants have established a sufficient \ninjury-in-fact. \nIII.  Conclusion \nBecause we hold that Movants have the requisite cognizable interest to  pursue their \nconstitutional claim, we vacate the Initial Opinion in this action and remand the matter to Judge \nCollyer for further consideration of Movants' Motion. \n- 18 -\n\nCOLLYER, Presiding Judge, joined by EAGAN, MOSMAN, CONWAY and KUGLER, Judges, \ndissenting: \nIn law as in life, the answer depends upon the question.  Only by framing the question \nbefore us in its most general terms can the Majority answer with the unremarkable proposition \nthat some courts - but not the Supreme Court - have found a First Amendment right of access to \nsome federal court proceedings in civil cases when the place and process historically have been \npublic.  But the question the Majority poses is not the one presented by the motion in this case.  I \nrespectfully dissent and would affirm the decision in In re Opinions & Orders of this Court \nAddressing Bulk Collection of Data Under the FISA [hereinafter In re Opinions of This Court], \nNo. Misc. 13-08, 2017 WL 427591 (FISA Ct. 2017). \nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") is a special court with a special and \ndiscreet mission: to protect the rights of U.S. persons while reviewing surveillance measures to \nprotect national security.  FISC proceedings are classified and the Court operates under specific \ncongressional direction that everything it does must respect and protect the secrecy of those \nclassifications.  No member of the public would have any \"right\" under the First Amendment to \nask to observe a hearing in the FISC courtroom.  Still less should we be inventing such a \"right\" \nin the present circumstances. \nTo be precise, what Movants seek is not \"access to judicial proceedings,\" as the Majority \nwould have it.  Rather, their current request is more limited and specific: having already received \nthis Court's opinions and orders addressing bulk collection of data with classified material \nredacted, Movants want us to rule that they have a \"right\" of access to the information classified \nby the Executive Branch and that Executive Branch agencies must defend each redaction in the \nface of Movants' challenges. \n- 1 -\n\nThe effect of the Court's decision today is to displace Congress's judgment that access to \nclassified and ex parte FISC judicial opinions shall be resolved through the procedures set forth \nin Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act, which, as relevantly titled, governs the \n\"[d ]eclassification of significant decisions, orders, and opinions\" of the FISC.  Just as in the days \nof John Marshall, it is imperative that the Judiciary avoid the appearance of eroding the very \nprinciples intended to maintain the careful balance of powers set forth in the Constitution. 1 The \nCourt's decision today unfortunately fails in that effort. \nOne last introductory comment is due.  FISC judges come from district courts around the \ncountry.  Few of us knew each other before our appointments to the FISC.  In our work on the \nFISC, as with our work in our home courts, we decide alone.  The occasion of this en bane \nreview of the In re Opinions of This Court decision has given us a rare and wonderful \nopportunity to wrestle together over some weighty legal principles and issues. This dissent is \nwritten in the same spirit. \nI. \nThe question pending before the en bane Court is whether Movants have shown an injury \nin fact sufficient to establish constitutional standing and this Court's jurisdiction.  There is no \ndispute between the parties or the members of the Court that Article III of the Constitution limits \nthe judicial power to the adjudication of cases or controversies in which a party seeking relief \ndemonstrates standing for each asserted claim.  There likewise is no dispute that the prevailing \n\"Much more than legal niceties are at stake here. The statutory and (especially) \nconstitutional elements of jurisdiction are an essential ingredient of separation and equilibration \nof powers, restraining the courts from acting at certain times, and even restraining them from \nacting permanently regarding certain subjects.\"  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. \n83, 101 (1998). \n-2-\n\nlegal standard is set forth in Lui an v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992), and requires \nthat Movants \"must have suffered an injury in fact-an invasion of a legally protected interest \nwhich is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or \nhypothetical.\"  Id. at 560 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nThe Supreme Court has never abandoned the requirement of a \"legally protected interest\" \nfor the purpose of establishing Article III standing.2  See Spokeo. Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, \n1548 (2016) (confirming that \"a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered an 'invasion of a \nlegally protected interest\"' (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560)); Ariz. State Legislature v. Ariz. \nlndep. Redistricting Comm'n, 135 S. Ct. 2652, 2663 (2015) (same); United States v. Windsor. \n133 S. Ct. 2675, 2685 (2013) (same).  Furthermore, the Supreme Court has signaled that the \nphrase \"legally protected interest\" has meaning independent of the requirement that the alleged \ninvasion be concrete and particularized as well as actual or imminent.  Adarand Constructors. \nInc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 211 (1995) (stating \"Adarand's claim that the Government's use of \nsubcontractor compensation clauses denies it equal protection of the laws of course alleges an \ninvasion of a legally protected interest, and it does so in a manner that is 'particularized' as to \nAdarand\" (emphasis added)). \nTo determine whether Movants asserted a legally protected interest, \"we do not consider \nthe merits in connection with standing, [but] we do consider whether the plaintiffs have a legal \nright to do what is allegedly being impeded.\" Citizen Ctr. v. Gessler, 770 F.3d 900, 910 (10th \n2  Even when the Supreme Court used the phrase \"cognizable interests\" for the purpose of \nevaluating standing it \"stressed\" that the injury must be both \"legally and judicially cognizable.\" \nRaines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819 (1997) (emphasis added).  Movants agree that \"[t]he injury \nalleged must also be one that is 'legally and judicially cognizable.\"' Movants' En Banc Opening \nBr. 6, available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Misc%2013-\n08%20Movants%27%20En%20 Banc%200pening%20Brief.pdf. \n- 3 -\n\nCir. 2014).  In other words, we consider whether there is some law that at least arguably could be \ndeemed to protect Movants' legal interest such that they can be said to have advanced a colorable \nclaim to the asserted right.  Aurora Loan Servs .. Inc. v. Craddieth, 442 F.3d 1018, 1024 (7th Cir. \n2006).  As the Seventh Circuit has explained: \nThe point is not that to establish standing a plaintiff must establish that a right of \nhis has been infringed; that would conflate the issue of standing with the merits of \nthe suit. It is that he must have a colorable claim to such a right. It is not enough \nthat he claims to have been injured by the defendant's conduct. \"The alleged injury \nmust be legally and judicially cognizable. This requires, among other things, that \nthe plaintiff have suffered 'an invasion of a legally protected interest.\"' \nId. (quoting Raines, supra note 2, at 819 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560)).  To be clear, \"[w]hile \nstanding does not depend on the merits of the party's contention that certain conduct is illegal, \nstanding does require an injury to the party arising out of a violation of a constitutional or \n· statutory provision or other legal right.\"  Fed. Deposit Ins. Cor.p. v. Grella, 553 F.2d 258, 261 (2d \nCir. 1977).  Accord Cox Cable Commc'ns. Inc. v. United States, 992 F.2d 1178, 1182 (11th Cir. \n1993) (\"No legally cognizable injury arises unless an interest is protected by statute or \notherwise.\").  \"The interest must consist of obtaining compensation for, or preventing, the \nviolation of a legally protected right.\"  Vermont Agency of Natural Res. v. U.S. ex rel. Stevens, \n529 U.S. 765, 772 (2000). \nII. \nA. \nApplying these legal standards, the Supreme Court has directed that \"[a]lthough standing \nin no way depends on the merits of the plaintiffs contention that particular conduct is illegal, it \noften turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted.\"  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500 \n(1975).  Indeed, the Supreme Court has agreed unanimously that \"standing is gauged by the \nspecific common-law, statutory or constitutional claims that a party presents.\"  Int'l Primate Prot. \n-4-\n\nLeague v. Adm'rs of Tulane Educ. Fund, 500 U.S. 72, 77 (1991).  \"Typically ... the standing \ninquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint's allegations to ascertain whether the \nparticular plaintiff is entitled to adjudication oft he particular claims asserted.\"'  Id. (internal \nquotation marks omitted, emphasis in original). \nAccordingly, to determine whether Movants have a legally protected interest the first step \nis to examine the specific constitutional claims Movants present.  Id.  Movants assert a First \nAmendment-protected interest to access information in certain FISC judicial opinions that the \nExecutive Branch determined is classified national security information.  Movants further assert \na First Amendment-protected interest to require the Executive Branch to explain its rationale for \nclassification and respond to Movants' challenges to their constitutionality, and for the FISC to \ndecide between them.3  Movants' Mot. 1, 24.  They invoke no other source of right for their \nclaims. \nThe Majority Opinion strays from Movants' \"particular claims\" and recasts their legal \ninterest as broadly as possible into \"access to judicial proceedings,\" Majority Op. 10.  By doing \nso, the Majority scrambles the scope of an interest recognized under the qualified First \nAmendment right of public access and the scope of an interest recognized under the common law \n3  Specifically, Movants seek access to classified information that was redacted from four \nFISC judicial opinions that were declassified, in part, and made public in 2013.  Now that the \nopinions are public, Movants ask the Court to compel the Executive Branch to conduct a second \ndeclassification review and \"require the government to justify its proposed redactions, permit \nMovants an opportunity to respond, and then make findings on the record about whether the \nproposed redactions are narrowly tailored to avert a substantial risk of harm to a compelling \ngovernmental interest.\"  Movants' Reply Br. 2, available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/ \ndefault/files/ Misc%2013-08%20Reply-1.pdf.  Movants claim the qualified First Amendment \nright of public access mandates these procedures as a matter of right, although they concede that \n\"much of this Court's work may not be subject to a constitutional right of access ....\"   Movants' \nReply Br. 1. \n- 5 -\n\nright of access.  The result is a legal analysis that ignores the Supreme Court's direction to \nexamine the nature and source of Movants' claims and gauge their standing by the specific \nconstitutional claims they present.  This confusion has consequences because the First \nAmendment and the common law are analyzed differently. \nThe First Amendment provides no general right of access to government proceedings. \nHouchins v. KOED. Inc., 438 U.S. 1, 15 (1978) (plurality) (\"The Constitution itself is neither a \nFreedom of Information Act nor an Official Secrets Act\" and \"[n]either the First Amendment nor \nthe Fourteenth Amendment mandates a right of access to government information or sources of \ninformation within the government's control.\").  Accord Phillips v. DeWine, 841F.3d405, 419 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (rejecting a broad assertion of a First Amendment right to government \ninformation that pertains to a government proceeding and noting that \"[n ]either this court nor the \nSupreme Court has ever recognized a right so broad\").  Nor does the First Amendment provide a \npresumptive4 or general right of access to \"judicial proceedings\" as a subset of government \nproceedings.  See. e.g., id. (noting that Houchins \"sets the baseline principle for First \nAmendment claims seeking access to information held by the government\").  Richmond \nNewspapers and its progeny offer an \"exception\" to the Houchins rule that there is no First \nAmendment right to access government proceedings, id. at 418, but that exception is limited to \njudicial proceedings that satisfy what has come to be known as the \"experience\" and \"logic\" tests \n4  When courts refer to a \"presumptive First Amendment right of access,\" see. e.g., N.Y. \nCivil Liberties Union v. New York City Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 296 (2d Cir. 2012), that \n\"presumption\" only comes into play after the First Amendment actually applies or attaches. \nThere is, however, no \"presumption\" that the First Amendment applies or attaches to any \nparticular judicial proceeding or document; instead, the Supreme Court established the non \npresumptive test set forth in Richmond Newspapers. Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980) \n(plurality opinion), and its progeny. \n-6-\n\nset forth by the Supreme Court to determine when the First Amendment applies to a particular \njudicial proceeding to which access is sought, see Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. l, \n9 ( 1986) (\"Press-Entemrise II\") (\"If the particular proceeding in question passes these tests of \nexperience and logic, a qualified First Amendment right of public access attaches.\"). \nThe D.C. Circuit observed in Flynt v. Rumsfeld, 355 F.3d 697 (D.C. Cir. 2004), that the \nSupreme Court has found that a qualified First Amendment right of public access applies to \ncriminal judicial proceedings only when the place and process historically have been open to the \npublic and public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular \nprocess in question.  355 F.3d at 704.  Lower courts have extended the Richmond Newspapers \nexception to certain trial-like civil proceedings found to satisfy the same experience and logic \ntests, but the Supreme Court has never ratified that approach.  Id. \nAgain, standing must be \"gauged by the specific ... constitutional claims that a party \npresents.\" lnt'l Primate Prot. League, 500 U.S. at 77.  The \"specific\" constitutional claims \nMovants present are claims under the First Amendment to access information in FISC judicial \nopinions that the Executive Branch has determined is classified national security information. \nThe FISC issued those opinions in ex parte proceedings that are unique to its jurisdiction under \n50 U.S.C. §§ 1842(b) and 1861(b)(l).  Movants also assert a concomitant right to challenge the \nconstitutionality of each of those classification decisions, to require the Executive Branch to \ndefend them, and to obtain FISC rulings on it all.  Because the unclassified portions of the FISC \nopinions at issue have already been made public, Movants' alleged interest can only be described \nas accessing \"classified information in FISC judicial opinions\"5 and not the broader universe of \n5  This framing of the interest is consistent with the Court's prior precedent addressing \nwhether the qualified First Amendment right of public access applies to classified FISC judicial \nproceedings.  See In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 491-97 (FISA \n- 7 -\n\n\"access to judicial proceedings\" generally, as perceived by the Majority Opinion.6  See,~' \nDoe, 749 at 266 (limiting the First Amendment to \"secur[ing] a right of access only to particular \njudicial records and documents\" and not to \"all judicial documents and records\"). \nTo be sure, one can find broad statements about a right of the public to access judicial \nproceedings more generally.  But those statements concern the common law right of access, \nwhich is a right that was not invoked by Movants and is analytically distinct from the First \nAmendment right they claimed.  As the Fourth Circuit cogently explained, \"[t]he common-law \npresumptive right of access extends to all judicial documents and records\" whereas \"[b] y \ncontrast, the First Amendment secures a right of access only to particular judicial records and \ndocuments\" when it applies.  See Doe v. Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 265-66 (4th Cir. 2014) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted, emphases added). 7  The Sixth Circuit echoed this \nCt. 2007) (concluding that the First Amendment provides no public right of access to FISC \njudicial records). \n6  Movants contend their interest is in \"opinions containing significant legal interpretation \nof the Constitution and statutory law\" and they argue that \"[f]or those sorts of opinions, at least, \nthe First Amendment has always required courts to operate openly ....\"   Movants' Reply Br. I. \nThis argument is clearly erroneous.  For example, the Supreme Court has implied, and federal \ncircuit courts of appeal have expressly held, that the qualified First Amendment right of public \naccess does not apply to grand jury proceedings where significant opinions are frequently made. \nSee, e.g., Douglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211, 218-21 (1979) (making \nclear that grand jury proceedings historically have been closed to the public and public access \nwould hinder the efficient functioning of those proceedings so such proceedings impliedly would \nnot satisfy the test of experience and logic set forth in Richmond Newspapers); In re Motions of \nDow Jones & Co., 142 F.3d 496, 499 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (\"A settled proposition, one the press does \nnot contest, is this: there is no First Amendment right of access to grand jury proceedings.\"); \nUnited States v. Smith, 123 F.3d 140, 148 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"Not only are grand jury proceedings \nnot subject to any First Amendment right of access, but third parties can gain access to grand \njury matters only under limited circumstances.\"). \n7  Accord In re U.S. for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(D), 707 F.3d 283, 291 n.8 \n(4th Cir. 2013) (rejecting plaintiffs' contention that the First Amendment protects a general right \nto access judicial orders and proceedings because \"[t]his interpretation of the First Amendment \n- 8 -\n\nsentiment when it stated that the First Amendment covers only \"certain proceedings and \ndocuments filed therein and nothing more.\"  Phillips, 841 F.3d at 419 (internal quotation marks \nomitted, emphasis added). \nIn describing the right of access to judicial records under the common law, the Supreme \nCourt has stated that \"[i]t is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general right to \ninspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents.\" \nNixon v. Warner Commc'ns. Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978).  That right, however, is not \nsacrosanct and yields when, for example, \"Congress has created an administrative procedure for \nprocessing and releasing to the public\" the material sought by a litigant, id. at 603, which \narguably is the case here.  Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act of20158-fittingly titled \n\"Declassification of significant decisions, orders, and opinions\"-now provides procedures for \nmaking FISC judicial opinions publicly available.  In addition, the Freedom of Information Act \n(\"FOIA\") dictates what \"[e]ach agency shall make available to the public ....\"   5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a).  Moreover, this Court previously held that, with respect to FISC proceedings, the \ncommon law right of access is preempted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, \ncodified as amended at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1885c (West 2015) (\"FISA\").  In re Motion for \nRelease of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 490-91 (rejecting the ACLU's claim of a common \nlaw right of access because, among other reasons, \"[t]he requested records are being maintained \nunder a comprehensive statutory scheme designed to protect FISC records from routine public \nright of access is too broad, and directly contrary to our holding that this right extends only to \nparticular judicial records and documents\"). \n8  Pub. L. No. 114-23, 129 Stat. 268 (2015), as codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1872. \n-9-\n\ndisclosure\").  The essential point, however, is that Movants have not claimed a violation of the \ncommon law right of access. \nB. \nAfter properly framing Movants' interest as an interest in accessing classified \ninformation in FISC judicial opinions rather than the expansion adopted by the Majority, it is \nnecessary to decide whether that interest is protected by law.  Movants cite the qualified First \nAmendment right of public access as their only legally protected interest. 9  The only interest \nprotected by the qualified First Amendment right of public access, however, is an interest in \naccess to trial-like judicial proceedings to and related documents when the place and process \nhistorically have been open to the public and public access plays a significant positive role in the \nfunctioning of the particular process in question.  See. e.g., Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 9 \n(stating that the \"particular proceeding\" in question must pass the tests of experience and logic \nfor the qualified First Amendment right of access to attach); Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. v. \n9  In re Opinions of This Court, No. Misc. 13-08, 2017 WL 427591, at *21. \n10  As discussed supra page 7, the Supreme Court has never extended the qualified First \nAmendment right of public access to non-criminal proceedings and the D.C. Circuit continues to \nadhere to the Supreme Court's application.  See. e.g., Elm!, 355 F.3d 697 at 704 {\"To \nsummarize, neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has ever applied Richmond Newspapers \noutside the context of criminal proceedings, and we will not do so today.\").  Other courts, \nthough, have extended the right to certain trial-like civil and administrative proceedings.  See. \n~' N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2012). \nWhile we all recognize this contrary authority, it remains true that, \"[b] olstered by the Sixth \nAmendment's express right for a 'public trial' in 'all criminal prosecutions,' public access to \ncriminal trials forms the core of this First Amendment constitutional right.\"  In re Application of \nWP Co. LLC, 201 F. Supp. 3d 109, 117 (D.D.C. 2016) (internal citations omitted).  See also \nUnited States v. Doe, 63 F.3d 121, 127 (2d Cir. 1995) (reciting history of open criminal trials and \nnoting \"[i]n Gannett [Co .. Inc. v. DePasguale], 443 U.S. 368] 379-81, the Supreme Court, \nstriking the balance in favor of the criminal defendant, determined that the Sixth Amendment \nguarantee of a public trial was personal to the accused and did not grant the press and general \npublic an independent right of access, at least to pretrial suppression hearings\"). \n- 10 -\n\nGen. Electric Co., 854 F.2d 900, 903 (6th Cir. 1988) (applying the same tests to a civil \nproceeding).  To distill this point to its essence for our purposes, it is fair to say that the qualified \nFirst Amendment right of public access protects only an interest in judicial proceedings and \nrelated documents involving places and processes that have been historically public. 11  That \nrubric patently does not apply to the FISC, FISC proceedings or FISC judicial opinions, or to \ninformation classified by the Executive Branch and redacted in declassified versions of FISC \njudicial opinions. \nWorking in secrecy at the FISC is not simply a matter of \"necessity.\" Majority Op. 2.  It \nis a legislative imperative under FISA.  See. e.g., 50 U.S.C. §§ 1803(c) (stating that \"[t]he record \nof proceedings under this chapter, including applications made and orders granted, shall be \nmaintained under security procedures established by the Chief Justice in consultation with the \nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence\"), 1805(a) (mandating that, \"[u]pon \nan application made pursuant to section 1804 of this title, the judge shall enter an ex parte order \nas requested or as modified\" if certain specified findings are made), 1842(d  )( 1) (same), \n1861(c)(l) (same).  The FISC has twice emphasized this congressional mandate.  See In re \nOpinions & Orders of This Court, No. Misc. 13-08, 2017 WL427591, at *15; In re Motion for \nRelease of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 488-90.  And at least twice the FISC has \nemphasized that its proceedings have never been public, it has never held a public hearing, and \nthe number of opinions released to the public is statistically minor relative to the thousands of \nclassified decisions it has issued.  See In re Opinions & Orders of This Court, 2017 WL 427591, \n11  The Majority agrees.  Majority Op. 6 (admitting that \"to determine whether the public has \na right of access to particular judicial proceedings, courts must ask ... whether the place and \nprocess historically have been open to the press and general public\" (internal quotation marks \nomitted)). \n- 11 -\n\nat *17-20; In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 487-88, 492-93. \nNotably, too, in this matter no sealing order or other discretionary action has been taken by the \nCourt to impede public access to its classified opinions or the classified information redacted \nfrom its declassified and public opinions.12  The point is not just that FISC proceedings and \njudicial documents have never been historically public, but, importantly, the FISC does not \nexercise discretionary decision making about whether to conduct its proceedings in a non-public \nfashion-it is required to do so by statute. \nThis history of non-public proceedings weighs heavily against Movant's asserted First \nAmendment right of access to information classified by the Executive Branch.  Even \"[m]ore \nsignificant is that from the beginning of the republic to the present day, there is no tradition of \npublicizing secret national security information ....\"   Dhiab v. Trump, 852 F.3d 1087, 1094 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017).  \"The tradition is exactly the opposite.\" Id. \nMovants argue that this Court should not defer to the Executive Branch's classification \ndecisions but should review and potentially reject those decisions.  Movants' Reply Br. 2.  This \nargument is considered only to determine whether Movants have identified a right that the First \nAmendment protects, not to rule on its merits.  They have not identified such a First Amendment \nright to FISC review of Executive Branch classification decisions.  Furthermore, this Court has \n12  In Bond v. Utreras, 585 F.3d 1061, 1073 (7th Cir. 2009), the Seventh Circuit noted that \nthe common law offers a presumptive right of access to most documents filed in court based on \nthe principle that courts \"are public institutions that operate openly\" and \"judicially imposed \nlimitations on this right are subject to the First Amendment.\"  Because the FISC issued no \nsealing order or protective order preventing Movants' access to the classified information they \nseek, there has been no \"judicially imposed limitation\" that would be subject to the First \nAmendment.  Furthermore, contrary to the Majority Opinion's assertion that Bond is \"thin \nsupport,\" Majority Op. 15, it stands for the very proposition asserted in the January 25, 2017 \nOpinion, 2017 WL 427591, at *10, which is that when there is no law that applies to protect a \nplaintiffs asserted interest, there is no legally protected interest sufficient to establish Article III \nstanding. \n- 12 -\n\npreviously said that \"[u  ]nder FISA and the applicable Security Procedures, there is no role for \nthis Court independently to review, and potentially override, Executive Branch classification \ndecisions\" and, even \"if the FISC were to assume the role of independently making \ndeclassification and release decisions in the probing manner requested by the ACLU, there \nwould be a real risk of harm to national security interests and ultimately to the FISA process \nitself.\"  In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 491. \nThe Majority Opinion fails to accord these principles the governing weight to which they \nare entitled.  Richmond Newspapers specifically established a two-part test for determining when \nthe qualified First Amendment right of access applies - and that standard requires both the place \nand the process to have been historically public. 13  The Majority Opinion appears to accept this \nprinciple, 14 even as it fails to apply it.  There is no legal basis to find that Movants present a \ncolorable claim the First Amendment protects their asserted interest in accessing a place and \nprocess that is distinctly not public and required by law to not be public. \nIII. \nThe Majority Opinion most strenuously decries the January 25, 2017 decision in In re \nOpinions of This Court because the Majority believes that deciding Movants have no legally \nprotected interest necessarily, and improperly, involved deciding the merits of Movants' cause of \naction.  The Majority Opinion chastises the decision for having \"engaged in a lengthy merits \nanalysis of Movants' claim under the Richmond Newspapers 'experience and logic' test,\" \n13  \"The First Amendment guarantees the press and the public access to aspects of court \nproceedings, including documents, 'if such access has historically been available, and serves an \nimportant function of monitoring prosecutorial or judicial misconduct.\"'  United States v. El \nSayegh, 131 F.3d 158, 161 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  Accord Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 9. \n14  See note 11, supra. \n- 13 -\n\nMajority Op. 5.  But the Majority fails to explain why it believes that addressing Richmond \nNewspapers constituted deciding the merits of the motion.  Plainly an examination of the law \ninvoked by Movants may be part of-even essential to-a proper analysis of standing.  See \nWarth, 422 U.S. at 500 (\"[S]tanding ... often turns on the nature and source of the claim \nasserted.\"); lnt'l Primate Prot. League, 500 U.S. at 77 (\"[S]tanding is gauged by the specific \ncommon-law, statutory or constitutional claims that a party presents.\").  Because application of \nthe experience and logic tests revealed that Movants have no right of public access to classified \nFISC judicial documents or proceedings, they failed to identify an interest that is legally \nprotected and, thus, have no standing. \nThe Majority takes the mistaken and circular view that, because the Court must assume \nthat on the merits Movants would be successful in their claims when it evaluates standing, it \ntherefore follows that, \"[t]rom this base,\" the Court can conclude that Movants satisfy the \nrequirements of Article III standing.  Majority Op. 8.  The Majority misinterprets the Supreme \nCourt's edict that consideration of Article III standing does not involve consideration of the \nmerits.  \"Because a review of standing does not review the merits of a claim, but the parties and \nforum involved, our assumption during the standing inquiry that the plaintiff will eventually win \nthe relief he seeks does not, on its own, assure that the litigant has satisfied any element of \nstanding.\"  Fla. Audubon Soc'y v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 664 n.l (D.C. Cir. 1996) (internal \ncitations omitted, emphasis added).  \"Any assumption as to the outcome of the litigation simply \ndoes not resolve the issues critical to a standing inquiry.\"  Id.  That is because, as the Second \nCircuit has noted, \"[t]he standing question is distinct from whether [a litigant] has a cause of \naction!''  Carver v. New York, 621 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Whitmore v. Arkansas, \n495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990)) (emphasis added).  Cf. Libertad v. Welch, 53 F.3d 428, 439 (1st Cir. \n- 14 -\n\n1995) (\"Appellants need not establish the elements of their cause of action in order to sue, only \nto succeed on the merits.\"). \n\"[W]hat has been traditionally referred to as the question of standing ... involves \nanalysis of 'whether a party has a sufficient stake in an otherwise justiciable controversy to \nobtain judicial resolution of that controversy .... \"'15  DaCosta v. Laird, 471 F.2d 1146, 1152 \n(2d Cir. 1973) (quoting Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 731-732 (1972)) (emphasis \nomitted).  The \"merits analysis ... determines whether a claim is one for which relief can be \ngranted if factually true.\"  Catholic League for Religious & Civil Rights v. Citv and Cnty. of San \nFrancisco, 624 F.3d 1043, 1049 (9th Cir. 2010) (en bane).  \"A party's injury in fact is distinct \nfrom its potential causes of action.\"  Am. Farm Bureau Fed'n v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 836 \nF.3d 963,..968 (8th Cir. 2016).  As demonstrated below, whether Movants can establish the \nelements of their cause of action alleging that the Court improperly withheld information that the \nExecutive Branch improperly determined was classified national security information requires \nconsideration of factual and legal issues separate from the question of whether the First \nAmendment applies at all to certain FISC judicial opinions and proceedings.  The Majority \noverlooks this important nuance in the Supreme Court's legal standard that otherwise prohibits \nconsideration of standing from reaching the merits of the cause of action. \nThe Majority's error also represents a misreading of Richmond Newspapers and its \nprogeny, as well as cases that find no standing when a plaintiff fails to identify a legally \nprotected interest.  The Majority Opinion notes the Tenth Circuit's statement in Initiative & \n15  \"Although the standing question is often dressed in the dazzling robe of legal jargon, its \nessence is simple-what kind of injuries are courts empowered to remedy and what kind are they \npowerless to address?\"  Schaffer v. Clinton, 240 F.3d 878, 883 (10th Cir. 2001). \n- 15 -\n\nReferendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 F.3d 1082, 1092 (10th Cir. 2006) that, '\"[f]or purposes of \nstanding, the question cannot be whether the Constitution, properly interpreted, extends \nprotection to the plaintiffs asserted right or interest.\"'  Majority Op. 8 (quoting Walker, 450 \nF .3d at 1092).  But the Majority misunderstands the import of the statement:  its principle applies \nwhen, unlike this matter, there is an applicable constitutional provision and both standing and the \nmerits involve the same question about the scope of that applicable constitutional provision.  See \nDay v. Bond, 500 F.3d 1127, 1136-1138 (10th Cir. 2007) (\"Critically, however, in Walker, the \nplaintiffs' asserted injury and their claimed constitutional violation were one and the same.\"). \nWhen standing and the merits require different legal analyses, standing can be, and must be, \ndecided first and independently.  Id.  The Tenth Circuit explained: \n[W]e did note [in Walker] that \"the term 'legally protected interest' must \ndo some work in the standing analysis ... [and] has independent force and \nmeaning without any need to open the door to merits considerations at the \njurisdictional stage.\"  Id. at 1093 .... \nPractically  speaking,  Walker  mandates  that  we  assume,  during  the \nevaluation of the plaintiffs standing, that the plaintiff will prevail on his \nmerits argument-that is, that the defendant has violated the law.  See id. \n(\"For purposes of standing, we must assume the [p]laintiffs' claim has \nlegal  validity.\").  But there  is  still work to  be done by the  standing \nrequirement,  and  Supreme  Court  precedent  bars  us  from  assuming \njurisdiction based upon a hypothetical legal injury.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 560, 112 S. Ct. 2130.  While Walker addressed an instance in which the \nmerits of the plaintiffs' claims mirrored the alleged standing injury, that is \nnot always the case.  There are cases,  such as the one before us here, \nwhere  the  alleged injury  upon  which  the  plaintiffs  rely  to  establish \nstanding is distinct from the merits ofc laims they assert. E.g., In re Special \nGrand Jurv 89-2, 450 F.3d 1159, 1172-73 (10th Cir.2006) (\"[A] plaintiff \ncan have standing despite losing on the merits-that is, even though the \n[asserted legally protected] interest would not be protected by the law in \nthat case.\"); see also Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envt'l Study Grp., Inc., \n438 U.S. 59, 78-79, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978). \nHere, the issue of standing is not necessarily determined by the merits \ndetermination. The merits issue is whether K.S.A. § 76-731 a is preempted \nby 8 U.S.C. § 1623.  The standing question is whether§ 1623 creates a \nprivate cause of action.  Each of these issues is separate and independent, \n- 16 -\n\nand we may determine whether the Plaintiffs here have standing to assert \na private cause of action under § 1623 without reaching the merits of \nwhether §  1623  preempts § 76-73la.  See DH2. Inc.  v.  U.S.  Sec.  & \nExchange Comm'n, 422 F.3d 591, 592 (7th Cir. 2005) (determining that \nthe plaintiff lacked standing because its injury was speculative, without \naddressing the merits of the underlying claim). \nUnder these conditions, Walker simply does not apply.  Accordingly, we \nnow tum to the pure standing question whether § 1623 confers a private \ncause of action upon the Plaintiffs. \nId. (emphases added).16  Day makes a useful distinction that is helpful to the immediate \ndiscussion. \nAccording to the Tenth Circuit, decisions on standing and the merits remain independent \nlegal inquiries whenever a decision on the merits would not necessarily decide standing.  Only \nwhen both merits and standing require a decision on the same legal question does that Circuit \nfind them conjoined so that standing cannot be separately decided first.17  That is not the case \nhere. \nIn Press-Entemrise II the Supreme Court made clear that, when the qualified First \nAmendment right of public access applies (which is an antecedent inquiry Movants failed to \n16  To be clear, Walker itself involved a recognized First Amendment right because plaintiffs \nwere asserting a free-speech interest expressly protected by the First Amendment.  450 F.3d at \nI 088.  In the instant matter, the immediate question is whether Movants have a colorable right \nunder the First Amendment to access information in FISC opinions that the Executive Branch \ndetermined was classified. \n17  The Tenth Circuit has also recounted \"instances in which courts have examined the \nmerits of the underlying claim and concluded that the plaintiffs lacked a legally protected interest \nand therefore lacked standing.\"  Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. Nielson, 376 F.3d \n1223, 1236 (10th Cir. 2004).  The D.C. Circuit has clearly held that when \"plaintiff's claim has \nno foundation in law, he has no legally protected interest and thus no standing to sue.\" \nClaybrook v. Slater, 111 F.3d 904, 907 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (citations omitted).  Deciding standing \ncan often come close to the merits without violating legal principles.  See Arjay Assocs., Inc. v. \nBush, 891 F.2d 894, 898 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (stating that \"[b]ecause appellants have no right to \nconduct foreign commerce in products excluded by Congress, they have in this case no right \ncapable of judicial enforcement and have thus suffered no injury capable of judicial redress\"). \n- 17 -\n\nsurmount in this case), a cause of action arises if ( 1) access was denied (2) without specific, on \nthe-record findings (3) demonstrating that '\"closure [was] essential to preserve higher values\"' \nand (4) closure was \"narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\"' 478 U.S. at 13-14 (quoting Press \nEnter. Co. v. Superior Ct., 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984) (\"Press-Entemrise I\")).  Movants contend \nthat their cause of action also includes as an element a right to challenge the government's \nclassification decisions.  Movants' Reply In Support of Their Mot. for the Release of Court \nRecords 4, available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Misc%2013-\n08%20Reply-l.pdf.  These elements form Movants' cause of action, the merits of which were \nnever discussed in In re Opinions of This Court. \nAs to standing, however, the question focuses on whether classified FISC judicial \nopinions and proceedings have been historically open to the public and arise from a trial-like \nsetting, see Richmond Newspapers, so that Movants have a colorable legally protected interest. \nThis latter question does not run to the merits of their cause of action but, instead, to \"whether \nthe plaintiffs have a legal right to do what is allegedly being impeded.\"  Citizen Ctr., 770 F.3d at \n91 O; see also Grella, 553 F.2d at 261 (\"standing does require an injury to the party arising out of \na legal right\"); Cox Cable Commc'ns, Inc., 992 F.2d at 1182 (there is no injury \"unless an \ninterest is protected\"). \nThe Majority ignores this directly-applicable precedent in opining that the January 25, \n2017 decision ruled improperly on the merits in deciding that Movants had not asserted a legally \n- 18 -\n\nprotected interest under the First Amendment.18  The Majority confuses proper application of the \nArticle III requirement that a litigant present a cognizable legal interest with a merits decision on \nwhether that legal interest was unlawfully impaired. \nIV. \nThe Majority Opinion raises other considerations that, in my estimation, are not \npersuasive and do not detract from the foregoing analysis.  From the outset, the Majority Opinion \nnot only confuses the scope of the qualified First Amendment right of public access with the \ncommon law presumptive right of access, but the Majority also characterizes as \"novel\" \nMovants' theory that a qualified First Amendment right of public access applies to classified and \nex parte FISC judicial proceedings that historically never have been public.  However, it is not \nnovel.  Movants initially presented their First Amendment theory to the FISC more than a decade \nago, at which time it was considered and decisively rejected.  See In re Motion for Release of \nCourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484.  This same theory has been re-litigated without success \nmultiple times since. 19 \n18  See In re Opinions of This Court, 2017 WL 427591, at *9-13 (listing cases).  The \nMajority Opinion fails to distinguish these cases and cites no applicable precedent to the \ncontrary.  Each of the cases cited in In re Opinions of This Court involved dismissal for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction, which is not a decision on the merits.  See. e.g., Havens v. Mabus, \n759 F.3d 91, 98 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (stating that \"[w]e have previously held that dismissals for lack \nof jurisdiction are not decisions on the merits\"). \n19  See In re Orders of This Court Interpreting S. 215 of the Patriot Act, No. Misc. 13-02, \n2013 WL 5460064, at *1 (FISA Ct. 2013) (stating that the ACLU \"assert[ed] a qualified First \nAmendment right of access to the opinions in question\"); In re Proceedings Required by 702(i) \nofFISA Amendments Act of 2008, Misc. No. 08-01, 2008 WL 9487946, at *3 (FISA Ct. 2008) \n(observing that the ACLU's request for release under the First Amendment \"is similar to a \nrequest it made on August 9, 2007\"); In re Motion for Release of Court Records, Misc. No. 07-\n01 (FISA Ct. Feb. 8, 2008) (rejecting on reconsideration the ACLU's First Amendment theory). \n- 19 -\n\nMore importantly, the Majority suggests that novelty might have legal significance to the \nreal issue, i.e., whether Movants' claims involve injury to a legally protected interest.  For \nexample, the Majority Opinion states, \"[a]s far as we can tell, courts have uniformly found \nstanding to bring a First Amendment right-of-access suit so long as plaintiffs allege an invasion \nrelated to judicial proceedings\" and \"[t]hat is so no matter how novel or meritless the claims may \nbe.\" Majority Op. 11.  The Majority Opinion cites no case to support this claim of \"uniform\" \njudicial \"findings.\" At best, the Majority Opinion goes on to assert that \"[s]ome courts have \nstretched the right-of-access even farther for standing purposes,\" Majority Op. 11, then cites a \nsingle D.C. Circuit decision, namely Flynt v. Rumsfeld, 355 F.3d 697 (D.C. Cir. 2004). \nThe Flynt decision does not do the work the Majority asks of it.  Contrary to the \nMajority's characterization, the .ElYill court found that appellants \"asserted no cognizable First \nAmendment claim.\"  355 F .3d at 703 (emphasis added).  Nonetheless, the .ElYill court found that \nthey had standing to bring (at best some of) their claims alleging a press right to embed with \ncombat troops, which was advanced based on the First Amendment's express guarantees of free \npress and speech, not the qualified First Amendment right of public access.  Id.  The .ElYill court \ndiscussed standing in a single paragraph that omits without explanation Lujan 's definition of \n\"injury in fact\" as \"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and \nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"20  504 U.S. at 560 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted, emphasis added).  Since .ElYill, the Supreme \nCourt has repeatedly reiterated that required element of an injury-in-fact, see supra page 3, \ncalling into question the perfunctory discussion of standing in .ElYill.  Finally, the .ElYill court's \n20  .ElYill also makes no mention of the alternative formulation that an \"injury in fact\" must \nbe legally and judicially cognizable.  See Raines, 521 U.S. at 819. \n- 20 -\n\nstanding analysis did not give any consideration to the novelty of the appellants' claim of a right \nto embed with troops and did not involve a request for access to judicial proceedings. \nThe Majority Opinion adds that \"many courts-including the Supreme Court-have not \neven felt it necessary to address standing in dealing with tenuous right-of-access claims,\" \nMajority Op. 12, and \"[a] long list of courts have acted in this fashion,\" Majority Op. 13.  The \nMajority Opinion then cites eight decisions from six courts:  (1) Houchins v. KQED. Inc., 438 \nU.S. 1 (1978); (2) Dhiab, 852 F.3d 1087; (3) Phillips, 841 F.3d 405; (4) In re United States for an \nOrder Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(0), 707 F.3d 283; (5) In re Search of Fair Finance, \n692 F.3d 424 (6th Cir. 2012); (6) In re New York Times Company to Unseal Wiretap and Search \nWarrant Materials, 577 F.3d 401 (2d Cir. 2009); (7) Baltimore Sun Company v. Goetz, 886 F.2d \n60 (4th Cir. 1989); (8) Calder v. Internal Revenue Service, 890 F.2d 781, 783-84 (5th Cir. \n1989)).  All of these cases collapse upon examination. \nThree of the cases cited by the Majority-Dhiab, In re New York Times Company and \nBaltimore Sun-did not address standing because they involved permissive intervenors.21  The \nfederal circuits are split about whether third-parties moving to intervene permissively under Rule \n24(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in ongoing litigation in which a case or controversy \nalready exists must themselves demonstrate Article III standing.  See Mangual v. Rotger-Sabat, \n317 F.3d 45, 61 (1st Cir. 2003) (stating that \"the circuits are split on the question of whether \nstanding is required to intervene if the original parties are still pursuing the case and thus \nmaintaining a case or controversy\").  Cf. In re Endangered Species Act§ 4 Deadline Litig., 704 \n21  See Dhiab, 852 F.3d at 1090 (stating that the district court \"granted the [press] \norganizations' motion to intervene\"); In re N.Y. Times Co. to Unseal Wiretap & Search Warrant \nMaterials, 577 F.3d at 401 (stating in background section that newspaper moved to intervene and \nciting the district court case confirming that fact); Baltimore Sun, 886 F.2d at 62 (stating that the \nBaltimore Sun had petitioned the district court to intervene). \n- 21 -\n\nF.3d 972, 980 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\"It remains, however, an open question in this circuit whether \nArticle III standing is required for permissive intervention.\"). \nHouchins involved news media organizations that sought to expand the scope of the First \nAmendment's express protections for a free press into an \"implied special right of access to \ngovernment-controlled sources of information.\"  438 U.S. at 7-8.  It is not surprising that the \nSupreme Court did not discuss standing given that the question was not whether the First \nAmendment's right of a free press applied but, rather, whether, properly interpreted, the scope of \nthat right mandated the access sought by the news media organizations.  Id. \nBecause the remaining cases, Phillips, In re United States for an Order Pursuant to 18 \nU.S.C. Section 2703(0), In re Search of Fair Finance and Calder were silent about the question \nof standing22 it is inappropriate to draw any conclusion about what they \"felt\" about standing. \nAriz. Christian Sch. Tuition Org. v. Winn, 563 U.S. 125, 144 (2011) (\"The Court would risk \nerror if it relied on assumptions that have gone unstated and unexamined.\").  At best, it might be \nargued that the absence of any relevant discussion of standing by these courts implies that they \nthought there was standing, except that \"[w   ]hen a potential jurisdictional defect is neither noted \nnor discussed in a federal decision, the decision does not stand for the proposition that no defect \nexisted.\" Id. 23  \"There is no such thing as a precedential sub silentio jurisdictional holding[.]\" \nCuba v. Pylant, 814 F.3d 701, 709 (5th Cir. 2016). \n22  Although the Sixth Circuit in Phillips addressed standing with respect to other \nconstitutional claims asserted by the plaintiffs, it failed to do so for the so-called \"right-of \naccess-to-govemment-proceedings\" claim.  841 F.3d at 414-20. \n23  See also United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U.S. 33, 38 (1952) (\"Even \nas to our own judicial power or jurisdiction, this Court has followed the lead of Chief Justice \nMarshall who held that this Court is not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where \nit was not questioned and it was passed sub silentio.\"). \n- 22-\n\nv. \nThe Majority Opinion fails to persuade.  It confuses the scope of a legally protected \ninterest under the qualified First Amendment right of public access with the scope of such an \ninterest under the common law.  It further confuses the standing requirement under Article III \nthat a litigant present an injury to a protected legal interest with the merits decision on whether \nthe litigant can actually prove that the asserted legal interest was impaired.  Under Richmond \nNewspapers, the qualified First Amendment right of public access patently does not apply to \nnon-trial-like judicial proceedings that are not public and never have been. The errors in the \nMajority Opinion effectively relax the requirements for Article III standing when members of the \npublic ask to review and comment on redacted classified information in FISC judicial opinions. \nAs a result, anyone in the United States apparently has a legally protected First Amendment \ninterest in accessing information in FISC judicial opinions that the Executive Branch determined \nis classified and may invoke this Court's statutorily-limited and specialized jurisdiction to \nchallenge those classification decisions as unconstitutional.  I cannot agree.  For these reasons I \nwould conclude that Movants lack standing to assert their claims as Article III standing \nrequirements are understood and applied in any case.  But the Court should apply those \nrequirements with particular rigor in this case. \nThe Supreme Court has instructed the lower courts to apply a more rigorous analysis of \nstanding when a party seeks to challenge actions by the Executive or Legislative Branches on \nconstitutional grounds.  See, e.g., Raines, 521 U.S. at 819-20.  To be precise, the Supreme Court \nhas stated that \"our standing inquiry has been especially rigorous when reaching the merits of \nthe dispute would force us to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of \nthe Federal Government was unconstitutional.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  Accord Crawford v. \nUnited States Dep't of the Treasury, 868 F.3d 438, 457 (6th Cir. 2017).  Layered onto this \n- 23 -\n\n\"especially rigorous\" analysis is the Supreme Court's observation that \"we have often found a \nlack of standing in cases in which the Judiciary has been requested to review actions of the \npolitical branches in the fields of intelligence gathering and foreign affairs,\" as also is the case \nhere.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013).24 \nIntelligence gathering is one of the \"vital aspects of national security.\"  Gen. Dynamics \nCorp. v. United States, 563 U.S. 478, 486 (2011).  \"Matters intimately related to ... national \nsecurity are rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention.\"  Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 292 \n( 1981 ).  Accordingly, \"unless Congress specifically has provided otherwise, courts traditionally \n24  The Majority disagrees that \"we should change our conclusion simply because we \nconsider a constitutional challenge involving the Executive Branch.\"  Majority Op. 16.  The \nMajority's position is difficult to follow; one cannot avoid a Raines analysis here.  An especially \nrigorous standing analysis is required-without reference to the merits-whenever the merits of \nthe disp.ute would force a court to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two \nbranches of the Federal Government was unconstitutional.  Raines, 521 U.S. at 819-20.  Movants \nare asking the FISC to do exactly that.  Critically, there has been no sealing, closure, or \nprotective order issued by the FISC to impede Movants' access to the classified information they \nseek, so there is no discretionary judicial action being challenged by Movants, unlike cases in \nwhich the qualified First Amendment right of access was found to apply.  See. e.g., Press-Enter. \nII, 478 U.S. at 4 (judicial closure order); Press-Enter. I, 464 U.S. at 503-504 (same); Globe \nNewspaper Co. v. Superior Court for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596, 598 (1982) (same); \nRichmond Newspapers, 448 US. at 559-60 (same). \nThe Majority Opinion also seizes on the dissent's quotation from Clapper to insist that there is no \n\"special standing requirement\" for plaintiffs seeking review of acts by the political branches in \nthe fields of intelligence gathering and foreign affairs.  Majority Op. 17 (claiming that the dissent \nis reading Clapper to impose such a requirement and citing Schuchardt v. President of the United \nStates, 839 F.3d 336 (3d Cir. 2016)).  But Schuchardt addressed a heightened standing \nrequirement in line with the analysis in Jewel v. Nat'l Sec. Agency, 673 F.3d 902, 913 (9th Cir. \n2011), in which the Ninth Circuit rejected a district court's requirement that plaintiffs \ndemonstrate a \"strong\" and \"persuasive\" claim to Article III standing when suing NSA.  This \ndissent quotes Clapper to caution against relaxing standing requirements and expanding judicial \npower, 568 U.S. at 408-409, not to advocate for special standing requirements.  Like this dissent, \nClapper made no mention of a \"special\" or \"heightened\" requirement to establish standing in the \nnational security realm or otherwise.  Rather, in combination, Raines and Clapper require courts \nto ensure the vigor of the principles of separation of powers by giving close attention and \nexacting consideration to the elements of standing when asked to review actions of the political \nbranches involving intelligence gathering. \n- 24-\n\nhave been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in ... national security \naffairs,\" Dep't of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 530 (1988), including \"the protection of classified \ninformation,\" which the Supreme Court has directed \"must be committed to the broad discretion \nof the agency responsible, and this must include broad discretion to determine who may have \naccess to it,\" id. at 529. \n\"'Relaxation of standing requirements is directly related to the expansion of judicial \npower[.]\"' Clapper, 568 U.S. at 408-409 (quoting United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166 \n(1974) (Powell, J., concurring)).  \"The law of Article III standing, which is built on separation \nof-powers principles, serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers \nof the political branches.\"  Id.  Importantly, \"decision-making in the field[] of ... national \nsecurity is textually committed to the political branches of government.\"  Schneider v. Kissinger, \n412 F.3d 190, 194 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  In the exercise of that textually-committed decision \nmaking, Congress has already provided two avenues for any member of the public to obtain \naccess to FISC judicial opinions (Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act and FOIA), subject to \nExecutive Branch classification decisions which, under FOIA, are subject to examination in \nfederal district courts insofar as specifically provided by statute. \nThe Majority Opinion provides no basis in law for the FISC to expand its jurisdiction \ncontrary to Supreme Court guidance, statutory provisions that limit its jurisdiction to a \nspecialized area of national concern, and the evident congressional mandate that the Court \nconduct its proceedings ex parte and in accord with prescribed security procedures.  Applying \n- 25 -\n\nwell-established principles of Article III standing with the rigor appropriate to a constitutional \nchallenge to Executive Branch determinations in the national security sphere, I continue to \nconclude that Movants lack standing to assert the constitutional claim in question. \nFor all these reasons, I respectfully dissent. \n- 26 -",

THE FOUR JURISDICTIONAL ARGUMENTS MADE BY THE \nGOVERNMENT FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COURTS' OWN \nTREATMENT OF INHERENT SUPERVISORY POWERS AS ESTABLISHING \nNON-STATUTORY JURISDICTION OVER PUBLIC RIGHTS OF ACCESS.  6 \nA.  Inherent powers doctrine establishes Article III courts' non-statutory \njurisdiction over third party common law and First Amendment right of access \nmotions.  8 \nI.  Like the Supreme Court, every circuit recognizes the inherent power of \nArticle III courts to entertain third party common law and First Amendment \npublic rights of access for judicial records.  I 0 \n2.  The original court that heard the matter retains jurisdiction, including \nwhen the underlying proceedings or records in question are hidden from public \nview.  13 \n3.  All of these cases proceeded without a separate, statutory cause of action, \nand with jurisdiction derived directly from the courts' inherent supervisory \npowers over common law and First Amendment rights of access.  16 \n4.  The FISC itself has repeatedly recognized that it has jurisdiction over \ncommon law and First Amendment right of access claims, based on its \ninherent powers.  18 \nB.  None of the third party common law or First Amendment right of access \ncasesrelyon28 U.S.C. § 1331.  21 \n11 \n\nC.  FOIA does not (because it cannot) assign a cause of action to records held \nby the judiciary.  22 \n1.  FOIA deals exclusively with executive branch records.  23 \n2.  The Supreme Court has held that regardless of whether the government \nhas judicial documents, or copies of documents, in its files, the courts retain \njurisdiction over their own records.  24 \n3.  As the Government has argued in multiple courts, under FOIA, FISC \nopinions are still subject to the court's supervision.  25 \n4.  The FOIA argument in the response brief is in tension with arguments that \nthe Government has made in district court that because the FISC is a \nspecialized court, the district court should not exercise jurisdiction over FISC \nrecords.  27 \nD.  In none of the third party common law and First Amendment right of access \ncases is the movant a party to the underlying action.  29 \nII. CONGRESS CANNOT REACH INTO THE CORE JUDICIAL POWER TO \nGRANT, DENY, OR IN ANYWAY INFLUENCE THE FISC'S SUPERVISORY \nPOWER OVER ITS OWN OPINIONS.  30 \nIII. MOVANTS HA VE A COMMON LAW AND FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT \nOF ACCESS TO THIS COURT'S OPINIONS.  33 \nA.  Movants have a common law right of access to the four opinions that can \nonly be overcome based on articulable facts, known to the court, and not on the \nbasis of hypothesis or conjecture.  34 \n1.  The four opinions being sought are judicial documents to which the \ncommon law right of access attaches.  36 \n2.  The four opinions being sought are entitled to a strong presumption of \naccess.  37 \n3.  Under the common law balancing test, the FISC is required to ensure that \nthe withholding of any material is supported by articulable facts known to the \ncourt, and not on the basis of mere supposition.  40 \nB. Movants have a First Amendment right of access to the opinions, subject to \nredactions justified by the government to the court's satisfaction.  45 \n111 \n\n1.  The four opinions meet the three possible ways in which \"experience\" can \nbe analyzed: by common law, by the history of that particular court, and by the \nhistory of other, similarly-situated courts.  47 \n2.  Public access to the four opinions also meets the logic prong, playing \"a \nsignificant positive role\" in the functioning of the judicial process.  52 \na.  FISC opinions address weighty matters of law.  52 \nb.  FISC opinions demonstrate how the executive branch implements the \nlaw and the extent to which the government fails to comply with the law.  54 \nc.  FISC opinions address novel and significant interpretations of statutory \nprov1s1ons.  60 \nC.  Under the First Amendment, the FISC must ensure that the withholding of \nany opinion or portion thereof is narrowly tailored to meet the demands of \nnational security.  63 \nIV.

Parts I and II also highlight arguments \nthat the government has not addressed, which establish the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court's (FISC's) jurisdiction over this matter. \nFrom the response brief, it is clear that the absence of a sustained treatment of the \ncommon law right of public access has left a critical gap in information provided to \nthe court-both because common law establishes an independent right of access to \nFISC opinions, and because appellate courts frequently use the common law right in \nevaluating the historical prong of Press-Enterprise II. 1 See Press-Enterprise Co.  v. \nSuperior Court (Press-Enterprise II), 478 U.S. 1, 8 (1986). The response brief also \nfails  adequately to address  the  appellate  courts' jurisprudence in  its  analysis  of \nwhether and how the First Amendment right of access applies to the FISC. \nAccordingly, Part III of this brief raises a number of new arguments, on the \nmerits, to underscore why there so  clearly exists  both a common law and First \nAmendment right of access to FISC opinions. In doing so, it elucidates where the \ncircuits  are  split,  particularly  in  regard  to  the  balancing  test  applied  once  the \n1 The amicus opening brief to the FISCR discussed the history of the common law \nand First Amendment public rights of access only insofar as  they established a \ncognizable claim for purposes of standing. See FISCR Am. Br. at 13-19, 22-24. \n1 \n\npresumption  of access  attaches.  It proposes  a  balancing  test  based  on  factors \nconsidered by other federal courts that also address cases involving sealed records, \nclassification, and national security. It notes, for the first time, that the FISC has \nalready effectively applied the First Amendment right of access test, demonstrating \nthat it is entirely feasible. It concludes with a brief discussion of why this question \nis so important not just as a matter of rule of law and separation of powers, but also \nin regard to the legitimacy of the FISC as a court of law. \nSUMMARYOFARGUMENT \nThe FISC has jurisdiction over the motion before the court. Further, the common \nlaw and First Amendment rights of access apply. Under the former, for material to \nbe withheld, the court must consider articulable facts, not general statements about \nnational security implications. For the latter, the court is required to ensure that any \nredactions in its opinions are narrowly tailored to meet the demands of national \nsecurity. In the end, the result may be the same as the current redactions; however, \nthe First Amendment standard must be met and the final decision made by the FISC. \nPart I recognizes that the FISC has inherent supervisory authority over its own \nrecords and therefore exercises non-statutory jurisdiction over all common law and \nFirst Amendment public rights of access. Each of the four arguments offered by the \nresponse  brief to  the  contrary fails.  First,  the jurisprudence  establishes  that no \nstatutory cause of action is required for the court to exercise its inherent powers. The \n2 \n\ncourt with original jurisdiction over the case oversees all  contemporaneous and \nfuture motions for access to records. None of the myriad inherent powers cases at \nissue rely on a separate, statutory cause of action. The FISC would have to rule \nagainst the Supreme Court, every circuit, and four prior decisions of the FISC, to \nfind for the government. Second, contrary to the government's contention, none of \nthe third party common law or First Amendment right of access cases specifically \nrely on 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Third, FOIA cannot serve as a substitute for judicial action \nas it does not (because it cannot) create a cause of action for records held by the \njudiciary. That statute focuses exclusively on agency records. Regardless of whether \nthe executive branch happens to have judicial records in its files, as the Supreme \nCourt has held, courts retain jurisdiction over their own documents. The government \nresponse brief is further in tension with two arguments that the government has \nelsewhere raised. In both district court and at the FISC, it has argued that even under \nFOIA, FISC opinions are still subject to the FISC's control, suggesting that the court \ndoes, in fact still retain jurisdiction. Perhaps more concerning, the government has \ngone into district court and argued that because the FISC is a specialized court, the \ndistrict court should not exercise jurisdiction over FISC records-an argument at \nodds with the argument it advances in its representations to this  court, where it \nsuggests  that  (non-specialized)  district  courts  have  jurisdiction  over  FISC \ndocuments.  Fourth, while the  government argues that the  court cannot exercise \n3 \n\njurisdiction over this matter because Movants are not parties under FISC Rule of \nProcedure 62, it is of no consequence whether they are or are not parties to the \nunderlying dispute. All of the inherent powers cases involve efforts by third parties \nto obtain access to matters that are (or were) properly before the court. There is no \nquestion in this case that the four opinions being sought were well within the court's \ndomain; therefore, the FISC properly exercises jurisdiction over them. \nPart II underscores the constitutional limitations on Congress and the Executive \nBranch. Even if the legislature wanted to create a statutory cause of action, or to \ndeny a cause of action, to a common law or First Amendment public right of access, \nit could not do so without violating separation of powers. The FISC is an Article III \ncourt and thus carries all the inherent powers of the federal judiciary. \nPart III goes to the merits of the argument. First, it carefully applies the common \nlaw right of access to matters before the FISC to establish that the motion before the \ncourt can only be overcome on the grounds of known, articulable facts-not on the \nbasis of hypothesis or conjecture. It is beyond dispute that opinions are judicial \ndocuments to which the right of access attaches. The common law does not enquire \ninto the type of proceeding or whether or not it is closed. It looks solely at the type \nof document. As the four opinions being sought are final dispositions, moreover, \nthey are entitled to a strong presumption of access. The common law balancing test \nrequires the FISC to ensure that the withholding of any part of the opinions to be \n4 \n\nsupported by articulable facts known to the court. A hypothetical or vague ''threat to \nnational security\" is insufficient. Second, Part III applies the First Amendment right \nof public access specifically to the records in question. It notes, in contrast to the \ngovernment's assertion, that the FISC opinions meet the experience prong of Press \nEnterprise II under the three possible approaches that the court may adopt: by virtue \nof common law, based on the history of the FISC, and in light of the experience of \nother, specialized and non-specialized Article III courts in the United States. The \nopinions  also  meet  the  \"logic\" prong,  as  they  play  an  enormously  significant, \npositive role in the adjudicatory process. FISC opinions generally, and the four being \nsought  in  particular,  address  weighty  matters  of law.  They  illuminate how the \nexecutive  branch  wields  its  power-including  when  it  does  so  outside  the \nrestrictions  of law.  And  they  address  novel  and  significant  interpretations  of \nstatutory provisions. Under the First Amendment, it is the solemn duty of the FISC \nto ensure that any withholding of any opinion, or any portion thereof, is narrowly \ntailored to meet the requirements of national security. Indeed, the FISC has already \napplied the First Amendment standard to a motion for access to its records with great \nsuccess. \nPart IV  addresses  the  floodgates  argument lurking  in  the background of the \nGovernment response brief, noting that the types of matters with which the FISC \ndeals  are  precisely  the  matters  of law  with  which  citizens  are  and  should  be \n5 \n\nconcerned; that by releasing as much of its opinions as it can, the FISC fulfills a \nnumber of important interests, amongst which is ensuring its own legitimacy-a \nposition frequently challenged because of the subject matter with which the court \ndeals; and that well establishes processes and practicalities will prevent the court \nfrom becoming overwhelmed. \nThe brief concludes by noting that the end result for the four opinions may be the \nsame as the current redactions; however, in reaching this conclusion, the FISC is \nconstitutionally required to  apply the First Amendment test and to make its own \ndetermination. \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE  FOUR  JURISDICTIONAL  ARGUMENTS  MADE  BY  THE \nGOVERNMENT  FAIL  TO  ACCOUNT  FOR  THE  COURTS'  OWN \nTREATMENT  OF  INHERENT  SUPERVISORY  POWERS  AS \nESTABLISHING  NON-STATUTORY  JURISDICTION  OVER  PUBLIC \nRIGHTS OF ACCESS. \nThe Government's response brief lays out four arguments to support its assertion \nthat this court lacks jurisdiction over its own opinions: first, that there is no statutory \ncause of action for the FISC to hear motions from third parties for access to its \nrecords; second, that 28 U.S.C. § 1331  applies only to district courts and not to the \nFISC; third, that the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) assigns the cause of action \nto district courts; and fourth, that movants are not party to the underlying actions and \n6 \n\ntherefore have no legally-protected interest derived from Rule 62.2 Gov't Resp. Br. \nat 1, 2, 10, 13, 15, 17. None of these arguments survives scrutiny. \n2  The  response  brief  also  replies  to  Movants'  argument  regarding  ancillary \njurisdiction. See Movants' Opening Br. at 8-12; Gov't Resp. Br. at 9-11. The only \npoint  I  will  add  is  that  in  its  response,  the  Government  miscites  Kokkonen  v. \nGuardian Life Insurance Co.  Gov't Resp. Br. at 1, 8-9, 11. \nIn that case, an action for breach of agency agreement was brought between an \ninsurance agent and insurer and removed, based on diversity jurisdiction, to federal \ncourt. Kokkonen  v.  Guardian Life Ins.  Co.,  511  U.S.  375, 377 (1994).  The case \nsettled; however, the order dismissing the case did not retain the jurisdiction of the \ndistrict court to oversee the settlement. Id. at 380-381. When the settlement fell apart \nand one party returned to federal court to obtain files to which it felt entitled under \nthe agreement, the court lacked ancillary jurisdiction, as the facts to be determined \nregarding the alleged breach of contract were distinct from those in the principal suit. \nId. at 381. Justice Scalia, on behalf of the Court, wrote: \nThe situation would be quite different if the parties' obligation to comply with \nthe terms of the settlement agreement had been made part of the order of \ndismissal-either  by  separate  provision  (such  as  a  provision  \"retaining \njurisdiction\" over the settlement agreement) or by incorporating the terms of \nthe settlement agreement in the order. In that event, a breach of the agreement \nwould be a violation of the order, and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the \nagreement would therefore exist. That, however, was not the case here. \nId.  Dismissal pursuant to  Rule  41(a)(l)(ii)  empowered  district courts,  with  the \nconsent of the parties, to incorporate the settlement agreement or to explicitly retain \njurisdiction over the contract. The court had not done so, leaving enforcement of the \nsettlement  agreement  to  state  courts  (absent  some  other,  independent  basis  for \nfederal jurisdiction). Id. at 381-82. \nThat case is completely different from the motion before this Court, which is \nmerely seeking access to the FISC's previous opinions on matters that were properly \nbefore it. It is not a separate breach of contract claim based on a settlement agreement \nthat should be litigated before a state court. All Kokkonen says is that, while ancillary \njurisdiction  is  available  in  some  circumstances,  the  failure  of the  lawyers  to \nincorporate the settlement agreement in the order dismissing the case meant that \njurisdiction fell to the state court. \n7 \n\nA.  Inherent powers doctrine establishes Article III courts' non-statutory \njurisdiction over third party common law and First Amendment right of \naccess motions. \nThe response brief sidesteps the inherent powers doctrine, which establishes that \nArticle III courts have non-statutory jurisdiction over third party common law and \nFirst Amendment right  of access  motions  that  stems  from  the  courts'  inherent \npowers. Instead, the brief draws a distinction between doing something {invoking a \npower) and asking a court to do something. Gov't Resp. Br. at 1.3 For the latter, the \nbrief argues,  subject matter jurisdiction is  required.  Id.  The argument proceeds: \nCongress  has  control  over  subject  matter jurisdiction,  which  it  establishes  via \nstatute.4 But the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act {FISA) does not explicitly \nprovide an independent cause of action, as it does not grant the FISC jurisdiction \nover its own decisions. Instead, Congress has assigned just two categories of cases \nto the FISC {applications and the adjudication of certain types of challenges). Ergo, \n3 A good illustration may be found in contempt powers: i.e., just because Article III \ncourts have the ability to sanction contumacious behavior does not mean that third \nparties can make a motion requesting that the court hold an individual in contempt. \n4 The government cites Ankenbrandt v. Richards in support of the proposition that \nCongress has sole control over subject matter jurisdiction and that the latter \"is \ndetermined based on a review of 'the relevant jurisdictional statutes.\"' Gov't Resp. \nBr. at 7. However, cases like Ankenbrandt, which simply held that federal courts \ndon't handle domestic relations matters under the diversity of citizenship provision \nof 28 U.S.C. § 1332, do not say that strict limits on subject matter jurisdiction divest \na court of the fundamental attributes that come with the creation of an Article III \ncourt. See Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 698-99 {1992). \n8 \n\nabsent an independent cause of action or legal right, Movants lack subject matter \njurisdiction. Gov't Resp. Br. at 1. \nThe problem with applying that distinction in this context is that the FISC has \ninherent supervisory power over its own records. Nixon v.  Warner Commc 'ns Inc., \n435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978). In Nixon, television networks sought 22 hours of tape \nrecordings  subpoenaed during the  criminal trial  of several of President Nixon's \nformer advisors. Id.  at 594. There was no question that the court had jurisdiction \nover the tapes. The trial had been held before Judge John Sirica in the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia. The networks applied to the same court to gain \naccess to the records. United States v.  Mitchell, 386 F. Supp. 639 (D.D.C.  1974). \nThere was no statutory basis for jurisdiction asserted by movants or held by the \nCourt. It was entirely based on the court's inherent power over its records, to which \nthere was a well-established common law right of public access. Nixon, 435 U.S. at \n607. Writing for the Court, Justice Powell explained: \nIt is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general right to inspect \nand copy public  records  and documents,  including judicial records  and \ndocuments. In contrast to the English practice, American decisions generally \ndo not condition enforcement of this right on a proprietary interest in the \ndocument or upon a need for it as evidence in a lawsuit. The interest necessary \nto  support the  issuance  of a  writ  compelling  access  has  been  found,  for \nexample, in the citizen's desire to keep a watchful eye on the workings of \npublic  agencies,  and  in  a  newspaper  publisher's  intention  to  publish \ninformation concerning the operation of government. \n9 \n\n435 U.S. at 597-98 (internal citations omitted, emphasis added). In Nixon, there was \nno question that the court had jurisdiction over the right of access claim. It did not \nstem  from  a  statutory  cause  of action.  It  was  rooted  in  the  court's  inherent \nsupervision of judicial records. \n1.  Like the Supreme Court, every circuit recognizes the inherent power of \nArticle  III  courts  to  entertain  third  party  common  law  and  First \nAmendment public rights of access for judicial records. \nLike  the  Supreme  Court,  circuit  courts  routinely  exercise jurisdiction  over \ncommon law and First Amendment right of access motions for pretrial documents. \nSee e.g., Assoc. Press v. U.S. Dist. Court/or the Cent. Dist. ofC  ali., 705 F.2d 1143, \n1145 (9th Cir. 1983 ); United States v. Smith, 77 6 F .2d 1104, 1111-12 (3d Cir. 1985). \nSo, too, do they exercise jurisdiction over judicial records while proceedings are \nunderway. This includes material admitted into evidence in criminal proceedings.5 \nJurisdiction is vested in the court by nature of their status as Article III entities. As \nthe Fifth Circuit observed, \"the media shares the common law ... right of access to \nexhibits. Control of that access is vested in the court.\" United States v.  Branch, \n5 See, e.g., In re Application ofN  at 'l Broad. Co., 635 F.2d 945 (2d Cir. 1980); United \nStates v. Criden, 648 F.2d 814, 819 (3d Cir. 1981); United States v. Martin, 746 F.2d \n964 (3d Cir.  1984); United States v.  Wehbe, 791  F.2d 103 (8th Cir. 1986); United \nStates v. Graham, 257 F.3d 143, 145 (2d Cir. 2001); Valley Broad. Co. v.  US. Dist. \nCourt for Dist. ofN  ev., 798 F .2d 1289 (9th Cir. 1986); In re Providence Journal Co., \n293 F.3d 1, 9-13 (1st Cir. 2002). \n10 \n\n26 F.3d 1118, 1994 WL 286169, at *1  (5th Cir.  1994) (unpublished, per curiam) \n(emphasis added). \nCourts  similarly  exercise jurisdiction  over  requests  for  records  involved  in \nongoing civil cases. See, e.g., Stone v.  Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., 855 F.2d 178 \n(4th Cir.  1988); Publicker Indus.  v.  Cohen, 733 F.2d 1059, 1071  (3d Cir.  1984); \nNewman v. Graddick, 696 F.2d 796 (I Ith Cir. 1983). In Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of \nOnondaga, media organizations sought to  inspect documents filed under seal in \nsupport of a motion for summary judgment. Exercising jurisdiction over its records, \nthe court concluded \"a presumption of immediate public access attach[ ed]  under \nboth  the  common  law  and  the  First Amendment.\"  Lugosch  v.  Pyramid Co.  of \nOnondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). \nOnce a court has issued a decision, the original court retains jurisdiction to hear \nthird party motions for common law and First Amendment right of access to it. In ex \nparte warrant applications, for instance, after an investigation has concluded, the \ncourt that issued the warrant retains jurisdiction over requests for unsealing. See, \ne.g., United States v.  Bus. of Custer Battlefield Museum & Stores, 658 F.3d 1188, \n1192-96  (9th  Cir.  2011)  (application  to  district  court  that  sealed the  affidavits \nsupporting the warrant application granted under a common law right of access); Jn \nre Application ofN  ewsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74 (2d Cir. 1990) (common law right of \naccess to wiretap application granted after guilty plea entered); Baltimore Sun Co. \n11 \n\nv.  Goetz, 886 F .2d 60 (4th Cir. 1989) (affidavits supporting a warrant subject to the \nright of public access). \nGrand jury proceedings, like matters before the FISC, are cloaked in secrecy. \nNevertheless, once concluded, courts exercise jurisdiction over common law and \nFirst Amendment requests for grand jury records. See,  e.g., In re Petition of Am. \nHistorical Ass'n, 49 F. Supp. 2d 274, 295 (S.D.N.Y. 1999); In re Petition of Craig, \n942 F. Supp. 881, 882 (S.D.N.Y. 1996), ajf'd, 131F.3d99 (2d Cir. 1997); Carlson \nv.  United States, 837 F.3d 753, 760 (7th Cir. 2016); In re Petition of May, 651  F. \nSupp. 457 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (unpublished memorandum and order). In Carlson, the \ncourt wrote, \"Even when grand-jury materials are in the custody of government \nattorneys,  they  'remain  the  records  of the  courts  and  courts  must decide \nwhether they should be made public.\"' 837 F.3d at 760 (quoting In re Grand Jury \nInvestigation of Cuisinarts, Inc., 665 F.2d 24, 31 (2d Cir. 1981)) (emphasis added). \nPari passu, courts routinely exercise jurisdiction over third party efforts to obtain \ntranscripts, exhibits, and evidence after the close of a criminal trial. 6 In In re Knight \nPublishing Co., the court exercised jurisdiction over its records from the underlying \n6 See, e.g., United States v. Beckham, 789 F .2d 401 (6th Cir. 1986); In re Application \nofN  at'! Broad. Co., 653 F.2d 609, 613 (D.C. Cir. 1981); United States v.  Mitchell, \n551  F.2d 1252,  1257-58 (D.C. Cir.  1976);  Webster Groves Sch.  Dist.  v.  Pulitzer \nPub! 'g Co., 898 F .2d 13 71 (8th Cir. 1990). Common law and First Amendment right \nof access claims also have been brought in regard to product liability suits. See, e.g., \nLittlejohn v. Bic Corp., 851 F.2d 673, 678 (3d Cir. 1988); Chicago Tribune Co. v. \nBridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 263 F.3d 1304, 1310-1313 (11th Cir.  2001). \n12 \n\ncase, acknowledging both the common law and the First Amendment right of access. \nIn re Knight Publ'g Co., 743 F.2d 231 (4th Cir. 1984). In United States v. Edwards, \nthe trial had \"long since ended.\" United States v. Edwards, 672 F.2d 1289, 1290 (7th \nCir.  1982). Nevertheless, the initial court exercised jurisdiction, releasing an audio \nrecording that had been admitted into evidence and played during the trial. Id.  at \n1291. The Seventh Circuit upheld the lower court's decision, acknowledging that it \nis \"clear that there is a strong presumption in favor oft he common law right of access \nto judicial records.\" Id. at 1290. \n2.  The original court that heard the matter retains jurisdiction, including \nwhen the underlying proceedings or records in question are hidden from \npublic view. \nThe general rule, followed by every circuit, is that once an item becomes \"a \njudicial record,\" the court that originally had the matter before it retains jurisdiction. \nThis rule does not change just because the underlying proceeding or records  in \nquestion are hidden from public view. Grand jury transcripts, for instance, \nare produced under ''the supervision of' the district court, Branzburg, 408 \nU.S. at 688, 92 S.Ct. 2646, and as a result they represent an exercise of the \ncourt's power; they are \"filed with the court,\" Bond, 585 F .3d at 1073. They \nconstitute a form ofj udicial papers. Because grand-jury transcripts are, in their \nvery nature, judicial documents Gust as a transcript of a trial would be), there \nis  no  need  for  them  to  become  part  of the judicial  proceeding  through \nadmission into evidence ... Thus, the presumptive right of access attaches and \nis sufficient to \"give members oft he public standing.\" Bond, 585 F .3d at 1073-\n74. \n13 \n\nCarlson, 837 F.3d at 760 (citation omitted). See also In re Petition of Craig,  131 \nF .3d 99, 103 (2d Cir. 1997); In re Petition to Inspect & Copy Grand Jury Materials, \n735 F.2d 1261, 1268 (1 lth Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 884 (1984); Haldeman \nv. Sirica, 501 F.2d 714, 715 (D.C. Cir. 1974). \nEven  where  there  is  a  statutory basis  for  denying  access  to the  underlying \ndocuments, the courts' inherent power trumps the statutory reading. The Federal \nRules of Criminal Procedure, for instance, lay out exceptions for grand jury secrecy. \nFed. R. Crim. P. 6(e). Nevertheless, courts may act outside their constraints, subject \nto  their  own  authority.7  As  the  Supreme  Court  has  noted,  \"Rule  6(e)  is  but \ndeclaratory\" of the principle that disclosure is committed to the discretion of the trial \njudge. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v.  United States, 360 U.S. 395, 399 (1959). \nWhere the underlying proceedings are closed for national security purposes, the \noriginal court continues to exercise jurisdiction over third party motions. 8 In a 1986 \n7 See, e.g., In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 492-93 (2d Cir. 1973); In re Petition to Inspect \n&  Copy  Grand  Jury  Materials,  735  F.2d  at  1267-68;  In  re  Application  of \nJohnson, 484 F.2d 791, 796-97 (7th Cir. 1973). \n8  In the national security context, even Article I courts exercise jurisdiction over \ncommon law and First Amendment right of access claims. See,  e.g., Detroit Free \nPress  v.  Ashcroft,  303  F.3d  681,  683  (6th  Cir.  2002)  (\"The  First \nAmendment. .. protects the people's right to know that their government acts fairly, \nlawfully, and accurately .... When government begins closing doors, it selectively \ncontrols information rightfully belonging to the people.  Selective information is \nmisinformation. The Framers of the First Amendment. .. protected the people against \nsecret government.\") \n14 \n\nespionage case, for example, the Fourth Circuit entertained a First Amendment right \nof access motion to retroactively vacate an order sealing transcripts. In re Wash. Post \nCo. v. Soussoudis, 807 F .2d 383, 389 (4th Cir. 1986). The court emphasized that it, \nand it alone, held dominion over the records and the decision of whether or not they \nshould be made available to the public: \nWe note ... that, troubled as  we are by the risk that disclosure of classified \ninformation could endanger the  lives of both Americans and their foreign \ninformants,  we  are equally  troubled  by  the  notion  that the judiciary \nshould abdicate its decisionmaking responsibility to the executive branch \nwhenever national security concerns are present. History teaches us how \neasily the spectre of a threat to \"national security\" may be used to justify a \nwide variety of repressive government actions. A blind acceptance by the \ncourts of the government's insistence on the need for secrecy ...w  ithout \nargument,  and without  a  statement of reasons,  would  impermissibly \ncompromise  the independence of the judiciary and open the  door to \npossible abuse. \nId. at 391-92 (emphasis added). \nCourts exercise jurisdiction over not just records material to adjudication, but \nover their final judgments as well. In Doe v.  Pub.  Citizen, for instance, consumer \ngroups  moved  for  a First  Amendment  right  of access  to  the  partially-redacted \nopinion.  Doe v.  Pub.  Citizen,  749  F.3d 246, 265-68  (4th  Cir.  2014).  The court \nexercised jurisdiction over \"the public's constitutional and common-law rights of \naccess to judicial records and documents,\" granting access on First Amendment \ngrounds.  Id.  at  252.  In  matters  involving  sentencing,  courts  similarly  exercise \njurisdiction over common law and First Amendment right of access motions. See, \n15 \n\ne.g., United States v.  Corbitt, 879 F.2d 224, 228 (7th Cir.  1989); United States v. \nKravetz, 706 F.3d 47, 56-59 (1st Cir. 2013). \n3.  All of these cases proceeded without a separate, statutory cause of action, \nand  with  jurisdiction  derived  directly  from  the  courts'  inherent \nsupervisory powers over common law and First Amendment rights of \naccess. \nThe  Government's  response  brief  states,  \"[a]part  from  explicit  statutory \nauthorization, the only basis on which an Article III court (other than the Supreme \nCourt) may exercise subject matter jurisdiction is the narrow doctrine of ancillary \njurisdiction.\" Gov't Resp. Br. at 8-9. That statement is simply not true. In none of \nthe aforementioned cases did jurisdiction derive from statutory authority. In every \ncase, the court's jurisdiction over common law and First Amendment rights of action \nmotions is anchored in the court's inherent supervisory powers. \nThe court that heard the original matter is the one that holds jurisdiction. Indeed, \nit would be bizarre if it were otherwise. It would make no sense to file a motion in \nthe Eastern District of Kentucky, for instance, to gain access to records held by a \ndistrict court in Washington, D.C. The motion is made to the court that oversees the \ncase-not on the grounds that there is an independent statutory cause of action, but \nbecause the  court controls  its  own  records  and  thus  exercises jurisdiction over \ncommon law and First Amendment right of access claims. \n16 \n\nThe notion of the same court that first heard the matter retaining control is so \ningrained that common law doctrine requires that deference be given to the decision \nof the original court overseeing the case. As the Supreme Court explained in Nixon, \n[C  ]ases  that  have  recognized  [a  common  law right  of access  to  judicial \nrecords]  agree that the decision as to  access  is  one best left to the sound \ndiscretion of the trial court, a discretion to be exercised in light of the relevant \nfacts and circumstances of the particular case. \nNixon, 435 U.S. at 599. See also In re Wash.  Post, 807 F.2d at 390; Baltimore Sun \nCo., 886 F.2d at 64. \nThe legal right in question resides in common law and the U.S. Constitution. The \nD.C. Circuit explained, \nAs all parties agree, the existence oft he common law right to inspect and copy \njudicial records is indisputable. This right serves the important function of \nensuring the integrity of judicial proceedings in particular and of the  law \nenforcement process more generally. \nIn re Application ofN  at'! Broad. Co., 653 F.2d 609, 613 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (emphasis \nadded).  In  United States  v.  Mitchell,  three commercial television  networks,  the \nPublic Broadcasting System, the Radio Television News Directors Association, and \na large manufacturer of phonograph records all sought access to audio recordings \nthat had been used during the Watergate trial. United States v.  Mitchell Appeal of \nNat'! Broad.  Co., Inc., 551F.2d1252 (D.C. Cir. 1976). The District of Columbia \nCircuit observed, \n17 \n\nThe common law has  long recognized a right to  inspect and copy public \nrecords. In England, the right was narrowly circumscribed, and only a limited \nnumber of persons enjoyed it. But the American courts tended to view any \nlimitation  as  repugnant  to  the  spirit  of our  democratic  institutions,  and \ntherefore granted all taxpayers and citizens access to public records ... That the \ncommon law right to  inspect public records extends to judicial records is \nclear.  As  Judge  Gesell  observed,  the  right  to  inspect  and  copy judicial \nrecords ... has been settled at least since 1894. \n551 F.2d at 1257-58 (footnotes omitted). \n4.  The FISC itself has repeatedly recognized that it has jurisdiction over \ncommon law and First Amendment right of access claims, based on its \ninherent powers.9 \nOver  the  past  decade,  on  four  separate  occasions,  the  FISC  has  exercised \njurisdiction over third party right of access motions to its records. 10 \n9  Like all Article III courts, the FISC exercises myriad inherent powers, such as \nissuing  supplemental  opinions,  managing  its  docket,  contemplating  contempt \nproceedings, requiring briefings on novel issues of law, extending comity to district \ncourts, ordering the suspension of collection programs pending further submissions, \nand directing the destruction of noncompliant communications-none of which are \nexplicitly mentioned in statutes. \n10 The Government's response brief only lists three instances; however, as reflected \nin the following text, in one docket the FISC has twice acknowledged its jurisdiction \nover third party right of access requests for its records. See Gov't Resp. Br. 5. The \nGovernment also noted five pending motions.  Id.  There is now a sixth motion, \nsubmitted after the Government filed its response brief, seeking public access to the \ncourt's transcripts.  See  Judicial  Watch,  Inc. 's  Motion  for  Publication  of Court \nTranscripts, In re Transcripts of this Court Related to  the Surveillance of Carter \nPage,  Misc.  No.  18-03  (FISA  Ct.  July  25,  2018), \nhttp://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/FISC%20Misc%2018-\n03%20Judicialo/o20Watch%20Inc%27s%20Motion%20For%20Publication%20of \n%20Transcripts%20180725  2.pdf. \n18 \n\nIn 2007, the FISC observed, \"Notwithstanding the esoteric nature of its caseload, \nthe FISC is an inferior federal court established by Congress under Article III, and \nlike all such courts was vested with certain inherent powers upon its creation.\" In re \nMotion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484 (FISA Ct. 2007) (Misc. \nNo.  07-01)  (Bates).  In  that  case,  the  ACLU  asserted a  common  law  and  First \nAmendment right of access to certain judicial records. The court concluded that it \nhad jurisdiction over the motion. 526 F. Supp. 2d at 486. Judge John Bates looked \nto Nixon to recognize that the FISC, like every Article III court, \"has supervisory \npower over its own records and files.\"' Id.  (quoting and citing Nixon, 435 U.S. at \n598. He wrote, \nHow the FISC exercises its supervisory power over its records, and the extent \nto which release of its records is either prohibited by statute (or by statutorily \nrequired security procedures) or compelled by the Constitution or the common \nlaw, go directly to the merits of the ACLU's claims, and not to the Court's \njurisdiction over the ACLU's motion. \n526 F. Supp. 2d at 486-87. Judge Bates added, \"Indeed, it would be quite odd if the \nFISC did not have jurisdiction in the first instance to adjudicate a claim of right to \nthe court's very own records and files.\" 526 F. Supp. 2d at 487. \nIn 2008, the FISC again considered a motion, this time requesting \"any legal \nopinions issued by the Court\" regarding \"the scope, meaning and constitutionality \nof the FAA.\" In re Proceedings Required by § 702(i) of the FISA Amendments Act \nof2 008, Misc. No. 08-01, 2008 WL 9487946, at *2 (FISA Ct. Aug. 27, 2008). The \n19 \n\ncourt exercised jurisdiction over the motion. Judge Mary A. McLaughlin applied \nJudge Bates's reasoning, finding '\"no reason to reach a different conclusion.\" Id.  at \n*3. \nIn 2013, the FISC once more encountered a First Amendment right of access \nmotion, this time to§ 215-related opinions. Jn re Orders of This Court Interpreting \nSection 215 oft he Patriot Act, Misc. No. 13-02, 2013 WL 5460064 (FISA Ct. Sept. \n13, 2013). Judge Saylor exercised jurisdiction over the motion, with a citation to \nJudge  Bates's  2007  opinion.  He  held that  principles  of comity required  that  a \nseparate suit first filed in the Southern District of New York be allowed to proceed. \nHe ordered that, in the interim, the government conduct declassification review of \nany opinions responsive to the motion and not subject to the FOIA litigation, and to \n* \nreport to the Court. Id. at  1. \nIn 2014, the FISC addressed yet another First Amendment right of access motion, \nthis time in relation to its opinions interpreting 50 U.S.C. § 1861. In re Orders of \nthis Court Interpreting Section 215 of the Patriot Act, Misc. No. 13-02, 2014 WL \n5442058 (FISA Ct. Aug. 7, 2014). Yet again, the court exercised jurisdiction over \nthe motion. \nIn exercising jurisdiction over these motions, the court recognizes a long history \nof\"'[ c ]ertain implied powers\" that \"necessarily result to our Courts of justice from \nthe nature oft heir institution.\" Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501U.S.32, 43-44 (1991). \n20 \n\nSee also Eash v.  Riggins Trucking Inc., 757 F.2d 557, 561-64 (3d Cir.  1985) (en \nbane) (discussing scope of Article III inherent powers); Am. App. B (detailing cases \naddressing the inherent powers of the courts). Foremost among these is the power of \nthe judiciary to issue and control its own opinions. \nIn short, to agree with the government, the FISC would have to rule against the \nSupreme Court, every federal circuit, and four prior opinions of this court to find \nthat it lacks jurisdiction over Movants' right of access claim. \nB.  None of the third party common law or First Amendment right of access \ncases rely on 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \nThe Government's response brief argues that, to the extent there is a cause of \naction for constitutional questions, it is given to district courts under 28 USC§ 1331. \nGov't Resp. Br. at 2,  10, 15. That provision states, \"The district courts shall have \noriginal jurisdiction of all  civil  actions  arising  under the  Constitution,  laws,  or \ntreaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1331. The problem with this argument is \nthat none of the common law or First Amendment right of action cases discussed \nabove rely on 28 U.S.C. § 1331  in any way. Every one of them is grounded in the \ncourts' inherent powers. \nEven  Carlson  v.  United States, which the government miscites, relied on the \ninherent power of the courts to supervise grand juries, not, as the response brief \nsuggests, federal question jurisdiction under 28 USC § 1331. Gov 't Resp. Br. at 10. \nCarlson was filed as a '\"miscellaneous action,\" meaning that it was a petition to the \n21 \n\nCourt that oversaw the grand jury, to permit access to grand jury records.  In re \nPetition ofA  m. Historical Ass 'n, 49 F. Supp. 2d 274 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 9, 1998) (filing \na miscellaneous action M-11-189). To the extent that there was jurisdiction, it was \nunder the court's supervisory powers. Carlson, 837 F.3d at 761. \nThe grand jury ... falls under the supervisory authority of the district court. [] \nIt thus follows, as the Supreme Court confirmed both before and after the \nCriminal  Rules  were  adopted,  that  the  disclosure  of sealed  grand  jury \nmaterials  is  committed to the discretion of the trial judge ....T  he  inherent \nsupervisory power of the court over the grand jury is well established. The \nConstitution itself makes the grand jury a part of the judicial process. \nCarlson, 837 F.3d at 761 (internal citations and quotations omitted). \nCommon law and First Amendment right of access motions do not go to federal \ndistrict  or appellate  courts  because  of federal  question jurisdiction.  They  go  to \nparticular courts (the ones who heard the underlying action) because of Article III \ncourts' inherent supervisory powers over their own records. \nC.  FOIA does not (because it cannot) assign a cause of action to records \nheld by the judiciary. \nThe response brief argues that,  in the alternative, FOIA assigns the cause of \naction to a district court and not to the FISC. Gov't Resp. Br. at 15. This argument \ndoes not withstand scrutiny. First, it fundamentally misconstrues FOIA, which deals \nwith executive, not judicial records. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A). See also FISCR Am. \nReply Br. at 8-11. Second, it fails to recognize that just because the government has \n22 \n\na document, or a copy of a document, does not mean that courts are divested of \njurisdiction.  Third,  it ignores  the  continued control that FISC exercises over its \nrecords  even  under  FOIA.  Fourth,  it  is  in  tension  with  arguments  that  the \nGovernment has made in district court arguing that FISC, not the district courts, have \ncontrol  over FISC opinions.  Fifth,  it selectively ignores  the Government's own \nargument, made in district court, that because the FISC is a specialized entity, the \ndistrict court should not exercise jurisdiction over FISC's records. \n1.  FOIA deals exclusively with executive branch records. \nThe rationale behind FOIA was to rein in the administrative state, within which \n\"the weed of improper secrecy had been permitted to blossom and was choking out \nthe basic right to know.\" H.R. Rep. No. 89-1497, at 2 (1966). See also FISCR Am. \nBr. at 10. FOIA therefore created a presumption of transparency for agency records. \nFOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Pub. L. No. 114-185, 130 Stat. 538.11  At no time, \ndespite repeated amendments to FOIA and FISA, has Congress ever indicated that \nit intended either judicial records generally, or FISC records in particular, to be \naccessible under FOIA. See also FISCR Am. Reply Br. at 10-11. Nor could Congress \ntake such action, even if it wanted to. To do so would be to reach into the core of the \njudicial power and violate separation of powers. See Am.  Br. at 7-11. FOIA merely \n11  FOIA  provides  district  courts  with  jurisdiction  \"to  enJom  [agencies]  from \nwithholding agency records\" and may \"order the production of any agency records \nimproperly withheld from the complainant.\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). \n23 \n\ngives the public access to documents held by the executive branch. Judicial records, \nincluding records of research data and design, are exempt. \n2.  The  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  regardless  of whether  the \ngovernment has judicial documents, or copies of documents, in its \nfiles, the courts retain jurisdiction over their own records. \nJust because government files contain documents, or copies of documents, does \nnot divest the courts ofj urisdiction over their records. This is precisely the issue the \nSupreme Court confronted in regard to grand jury materials. \nThe Court considers grand juries to be \"an arm of the court,\" whose \"in camera \nproceedings constitute 'a judicial inquiry.\"' Levine v.  United States, 362 U.S. 610, \n617 (1960) (quoting Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43 (1906)). The similarities to matters \nbefore the FISC are striking: \"Unlike ordinary judicial inquiry, where publicity is \nthe rule, grand jury proceedings are secret.\" Levine, 362 U.S. at 617. \"Since grand \njury materials are traditionally the records of the Judicial Branch, it would be curious \nlogic indeed to deduce from this premise that such materials are included within the \nDepartment of Justice's files or materials.\" Cuisinarts, 665 F.2d at 31. The court \nconcluded that the \"disclosure of grand jury materials is solely within the discretion \nof the court.\" Id. (referencing Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v.  United States, 360 U.S. \n395 (1959). \nLike grand jury records, FISC opinions derive from closed proceedings. Like \ngrand jury records, FISC opinions are also held by the Executive Branch. And like \n24 \n\ngrand jury records, the fact that FISC opinions are held by the DOJ in their files does \nnothing to divest them of their status as judicial records. \n3.  As the Government has argued in multiple courts, under FOIA, \nFISC opinions are still subject to the court's supervision. \nThe  government  has  repeatedly  argued  that  the  FISC  retains  control  of its \nopinions even after the conclusion of the matter before it. In 2012, the Electronic \nFrontier  Foundation  sought  access  to  FISC  opinions  and  orders  regarding  the \nimplementation of section 702. Complaint at 1-2, Elec. Frontier Found. v. DOJ, 57 \nF. Supp. 3d 54 (D.D.C. Aug. 30, 2012) (No. 12-1441-ABJ), ECF No. 1 [hereinafter \nEFF  Complaint].12  The  DOJ  objected,  arguing  that  the  FISC  controls  its  own \nopinions and orders after they have issued.  Since the court had not ordered the \npublication, the EFF could not obtain it through FOIA. See Declaration of Mark A. \nBradley ,-r 7, Elec. Frontier Found. v. DOJ, 57 F. Supp. 3d 54 (D.D.C.

The Government moved for summary judgment on grounds that the DOJ \nhas \"no discretion in regard to\" the opinions and that publication is entirely in the \nFISC's hands.13 The EFF moved to stay the proceedings while it pursued the matter \nat the FISC.14 \nThe DOJ then  came to  the  FISC  and,  even as  it argued against this court's \njurisdiction  over  the  EFF's  motion,  acknowledged  \"the  inherent  jurisdiction \npreviously recognized by this Court with respect to its supervisory power over its \nown records and files.\" Gov't Opposition Brief at 2, In re Motion for Consent to \nDisclosure of Court Records, Misc. No. 13-01 (FISA Ct. June 7, 2013). The FISC, \nrejecting the Government's argument, determined that it had jurisdiction. It noted \n13 The Government argued, \"As the Supreme Court concluded long ago, '[t]here is \nnothing  in  the  legislative  history  to  suggest  that  in  adopting  the  Freedom  of \nInformation Act to curb agency discretion to conceal information, Congress intended \nto require an agency to commit contempt of court in order to release documents.\"' \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of the Department of Justice's \nMotion for Summary Judgment at 2, Elec.

Supp. 2d at 486, which quoted Nixon, 435 U.S. \nat 598. The FISC pointed out a certain tension in the government's position: \nThe  very reason  the  parties  are  now before this  Court is  the  Government's \ncontention ... that this Court ... continues to exert authority and control over copies \nof the Opinion in the Government's possession in a manner that prohibits the \ndisclosure  sought  by  EFF  pursuant to  FOIA.  The  Court has  little  difficulty \nconcluding that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate this dispute between the parties \nover whether the Court has in fact prohibited such disclosure and, if so, whether \nthe prohibition should be modified or lifted. \nOp. and Order at 3, In re Motion for Consent to Disclosure of Court, Misc. No. 13-\n01  (FISA Ct. June 12, 2013). The fact that the matter had already been settled was \nof no jurisdictional consequence. Because of the nature of the Court's docket, such \nrequests  \"are  seldom,  if ever,  filed  contemporaneously  with  the  issuance  or \npublication of an order or opinion.\" Id. at 6. \n4.  The  FOIA  argument  in  the  response  brief is  in  tension  with \narguments that the Government has made in district court that \nbecause the FISC is a specialized court, the district court should not \nexercise jurisdiction over FISC records. \nThe response brief fails to acknowledge that the government has argued in the \nNorthern District of California that because of its specialized subject matter, the \nFISC, and not the district court, should exercise jurisdiction over its records. \nIn that case, Twitter sought a declaratory judgment that the government's refusal \nto allow the company to publish data about PISA-related orders violated the First \n27 \n\nAmendment.  Defendants' Notice of Motion and Partial Motion to Dismiss at  1, \nTwitter,  Inc.  v.  Holder, Case No.  14-cv-4480 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 9, 2015). The DOJ \nargued in response that the district court should \"decline jurisdiction over plaintiffs \nFISA based claims.\" Id.  at 15. The government emphasized that \"[p ]roceeding in \nthis manner. . . would provide the litigants the benefit of the FISC 's expertise as a \ncourt of specialized jurisdiction.\" Id. \nThe  government  addressed,  at  length,  the  unique  nature  of FISC's  docket, \nsuggesting that any \nchallenge to orders issued by the FISC or directives issued under a FISC \napproved program should be brought before the FISC. This approach would \nbe consistent with the framework established by Congress, which created the \nFISC as  a court of specialized jurisdiction to administer the provisions of \nFISA. \nId.  at 19. This is precisely the argument that I raised in FISCR in response to the \nGovernment's earlier FOIA claim, and which Movants raised in their opening brief \nin  this  case.15  But  the  response  brief ignores  it,  instead  arguing-contrary to \nsupporting arguments they have made in federal  court-that any effort by third \nparties to obtain FISC opinions should be heard in a (non-specialized) district court. \n15 See FISCR Am. Reply Br. 10-11 (\"[The entire purpose ofFISA is to concentrate \nnational security cases before a specialized court with a particular expertise and \nprocedures designed to handle national security matters. It would be contrary to this \ndesign to read into a prior statute a requirement that only district courts could be \nused to obtain FISC opinions.\"). See also Movants' Opening Br. at 14-15. \n28 \n\nIf the specialization of this court matters for denying district courts jurisdiction \nover questions regarding FISC records, then surely it matters for granting FISC \njurisdiction  over the  same.  Specialization  cannot  only  matter  for jurisdictional \npurposes when it is convenient to the government. \nD.  In none of the third party common law and First Amendment right of \naccess cases is the movant a party to the underlying action. \nFinally, the Government's response brief argues that movants are third parties; \ntherefore, they have no legally-protected interest derived from Rule 62 and no cause \nof action. Gov't Resp. Br. at 13, 17. See also FISC R. of P. 62; In re Orders oft his \nCourt Interpreting§ 215 oft he Patriot Act, Misc. No. 13-02, 2013 WL 5460064, at \n*5  (FISA Ct.  Sept.  13,  2013).  Movants, the  government writes, \"are neither an \nauthoring judge of this Court nor a party to any\" of the underlying proceedings. \nGov't Resp. Br. at 17. This argument, too, falls short. \nIt is entirely true that Movants were not party to the underlying actions that led \nto the opinions being sought. But the government, in making this argument, misses \na critical point: common law and First Amendment right of access claims do not \nrequire petitioners to be party to the underlying action. Members of the public and \nthe media need not establish standing or bring a new case forward.  Instead, any \nmember of the public can bring a motion-as petitioners, not as plaintiffs-to courts, \nbased on their common law and First Amendment rights and the court's inherent \nsupervisory powers. In this case, Movants have similarly petitioned the court for \n29 \n\naccess to the court's records. This is not a new case or controversy. It is a motion for \naccess to records over which the court has supervisory control. \nThe whole point of the common law and First Amendment right is that the right \nof public access does not belong to the parties in a suit; it belongs to the public at \nlarge. Parties cannot be relied on to protect those rights. Nor can the parties negotiate \naway the public's right of access. It is the court's duty to protect those rights. \nII. CONGRESS CANNOT REACH INTO THE CORE JUDICIAL POWER TO \nGRANT,  DENY,  OR  IN  ANY  WAY  INFLUENCE  THE  FISC'S \nSUPERVISORY POWER OVER ITS OWN OPINIONS. \nThe Government's response brief treats Congress's failure to provide a statutory \ncause of action for public access to the FISC's records as dispositive of the question \nof jurisdiction. In so doing, it ignores the fact that Congress cannot reach into the \ncore judicial power to grant, deny, or in any way influence a court's supervisory \npower over  its  own opinions.  To  do  so would be to run roughshod over basic \nseparation  of powers-an  argument  that  I  raised  in  the  opening  brief but  the \ngovernment never addressed in its response. \nThe fact that FISC is an Article III court, and not an Article I tribunal, matters \ntremendously. Am. Br. at 5-11; Am. App. 1-51. The Constitution vests \"the judicial \npower of the United States\" in Article III. U.S. Const. art. III,§ 1. Unlike its English \npredecessors, the grant of power derives  directly  from  the  People.  U.S.  Const. \n30 \n\nPreamble. Article III serves as a fully independent, co-equal branch of government. \nPlaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 219-23 (1995). \nThe  purpose  behind  separating  the judicial  power  from  the  legislative  and \nexecutive  powers  was  to  prevent  the  concentration  of power  in  one  entity. \nO'Donoghue v.  United States,  289  U.S.  516, 530 (1933). As Madison famously \npenned, \"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the \nsame hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self appointed, \nor elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\" The Federalist \nNo.  47,  at  301  (James  Madison)  (Clinton  Rossiter ed.  1961).  Accordingly, the \nbranches may \"neither. . .invade the province of the other[ s] [nor] control, direct or \nrestrain the action[s] of the other[s].\" Massachusetts v.  Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488 \n(1923). See also Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327, 341 (2000). \nThe judicial power of the United States includes, at its core, the power to dispose \nof matters properly before the courts. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1  Cranch) 137, \n177 (1803). Once the judicial process begins, Congress cannot, as a constitutional \nmatter, interfere. See United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128 (1871). Even \nafter a decision is rendered, the legislature and the executive cannot invade the \njudicial realm. See Hayburn 's Case, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 409 (1792); Plaut, 514 U.S. at \n217-18. \n31 \n\nArticle III courts have inherent powers that stem from their role in administering \njustice. Among these powers is inherent supervisory power over judicial records. \nNixon,  435  U.S.  at 598.  The paradigmatic case of a judicial record is  a court's \ndecision in any matter properly before it. At some level, all the courts have is their \ndecisions. \nThe  government's  argument  relies  on  the  assumption  that  Congress  could \ninterfere-namely, that it could strip an Article III court of its inherent supervisory \npower over its own decisions. It cannot. \nIf Congress tried to strip the FISC of this power, then one of two statements \nwould have to be true. Either the action would be an unconstitutional violation of \nseparation of powers, or the court would not be an Article III court.  It is well-\nrecognized, however, that the FISC is an Article III court.16 Congress intended FISC \nto be an Article III court. See Foreign Intelligence Electronic Surveillance: Hearings \nBefore the Subcomm. on Legis. of the H. Permanent Select Comm. on Intelligence, \n95th  Cong.  26-31,  116  (1978).  FISC  meets  the  structural  constitutional \nrequirements:  Article III courts are defined by the constitutional requirements of \n16 FISCR Am. Br. at 8; In  re Sealed Case, 310 F .3d 717, 731-32 (FISA Ct. Rev. \n2002) (per curiam); United States v.

Appeal is from the FISC to FISCR to the Supreme Court.  50 U.S.C.  § \n1803(b) , (k). The Constitution insulates Article III judges, who \"shall hold their \noffices during good behavior and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a \ncompensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\" \nU.S. Const. art. III, § 1. FISC judges are Article III judges. 50 U.S.C. § 1803(a)(l ). \nTherefore, such action must be understood as unconstitutional. \nThe  response  brief never  answers  this  argument,  sidestepping  the  inherent \nauthorities of the FISC that go to its core function as an Article III court. It is mere \nsophistry to say that a court has no subject matter jurisdiction over its own records. \nCongress did not interfere because it cannot interfere in a core Article III power. \nIII.  MOVA  NTS  HAV  E  A  COMMON  LAW  AND  FIRST  AMENDMENT \nRIGHT OF ACCESS TO Tms COURT'S OPINIONS. \nThe law recognizes two separate rights of access to judicial proceedings and records: \n\"a common law right to inspect and copy public records and documents, including \njudicial records and documents,\" and \"a First Amendment right of access to criminal \nproceedings\" and documents therein.  United States  v.  Bus.  of Custer Battlefield \nMuseum & Stores, 658 F .3d 1188, 1192-96 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal quotations and \ncitations omitted). Movants have a qualified right of access, under both rights, to the \n33 \n\nfour opinions being sought. As the common law right of access is relevant to the \nFirst Amendment analysis, as well as an independent basis on which Movants have \na right of access, this part begins with that right, before addressing the application \nof the First Amendment right specifically to FISC opinions. \nA. Movants have a common law right of access to the four opinions that can \nonly be overcome based on articulable facts, known to the court, and not \non the basis of hypothesis or conjecture. \nFrom the earliest days of the Republic, courts have recognized that the public has \na common law right of access to judicial records. 17 This right is foundational to our \nsystem of government. See Ex parte Drawbaugh, 2 App. D.C. 404, 406-07, 1894 \nWL 11944 (D.C. Ct. App. 1894) (\"any limitation of the right to a copy of a judicial \n17 See Wheaton v. Peters, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 591, 668 (1834); Banks v. Manchester, 128 \nU.S. 244, 253 (1888); In re McLean, 16 F. Cas. 237, 239 (C.C.S.D. Ohio 1879) (No. \n8877); In re Chambers, 44 F. 786 (C.C.D. Neb. 1891); Nash v. Lathrop, 6 N.E. 559, \n560-61,  563  (Mass.  1886).  Federal  courts  have  repeatedly  recognized  the  long \nhistory of the  common  law public right of access to judicial records.  See,  e.g., \nLugosch, 435  F .3d at  119  (\"The common  law right of public access to judicial \ndocuments  is  firmly  rooted  in  our nation's  history.\");  United States  v.  Amodeo \n(Amodeo I), 44 F.3d 141,  145 (2d Cir.  1995) (\"The common law right of public \naccess to judicial documents is said to predate the Constitution.\"); Leucadia, Inc. v. \nApplied Extrusion Techs., Inc., 998 F.2d 157, 161 (3d Cir. 1993) (\"The existence of \n[the common law] right, which antedates the Constitution and which is applicable in \nboth criminal and civil cases, is now beyond dispute.\") (internal quotations and \ncitations omitted); United States v.  Mitchell, 386 F. Supp. 639, 641  (D.D.C. 1975) \n(\"[The]  privilege  of  the  public  to  inspect  and  obtain  copies  of  all  court \nrecords ... reaches  far  back into  our common  law and traditions.  Absent  special \ncircumstances, any member of the public has a right to inspect and obtain copies of \nsuch judicial records.\"). See also FISCR Am. Br. at 14-16 (discussing the history of \nthe English  common  law public  right  of access to judicial records prior to  the \nFounding). \n34 \n\nrecord or paper, when applied for by any person having an interest in it, would \nprobably be deemed repugnant to the genius of American institutions.\"). See also \nMitchell, 551F.2d1252, 1258 (D.C. Cir. 1976). The right serves numerous salutary \nfunctions. \n[It]  promotes  public  confidence  in  the  judicial  system ....A  s  with  other \nbranches of government, the bright light cast upon the judicial process by \npublic observation diminishes the possibilities for injustice, incompetence, \nperjury, and fraud.  Furthermore, the very openness of the process should \nprovide the public with a more complete understanding of the judicial system \nand a better perception of its fairness. \nPhilippines v.  Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 949 F.2d 653, 660 (3d Cir. 1991) (quoting \nLittlejohn v.  Bic Corp., 851  F.2d at 678). It also \"promotes 'public respect for the \njudicial process' and helps to assure that judges perform their duties in an honest and \ninformed manner.\" Id.  (quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v.  Superior Court, 457 U.S. \n596, 606 (1982)). \"This common law right is not some arcane relic of ancient English \nlaw. To the contrary, the right is fundamental to a democratic state.\" Mitchell, 551 \nF.2d at 1258. \nAccordingly, the Supreme Court has recognized the federal common law right \n\"to inspect and copy public records and documents.\" Nixon, 435 U.S. at 597.

Such determination is \"best left to the \nsound discretion of the trial court, a discretion to be exercised in light of the relevant \nfacts and circumstances of the particular case.\" Id. at 599.

The four  opinions  being  sought are judicial documents  to  which  the \ncommon law right of access attaches. \nBefore the common law right of access attaches, a court must ascertain whether \nthe documents are ')udicial documents\" or ')udicial records.\" Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at \n145. \"[T]he mere filing of a paper or document with the court is insufficient to render \nthat  paper  a judicial  document  subject  to  the  right  of public  access.\"  Id.  The \ndocument must be \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful \nin the judicial process.\" Id.  at 145-46. See also FTC v. Standard Fin. Mgmt.  Corp., \n830 F .2d 404, 412-413 (1st Cir. 198 7) (extending the common law right of access to \n\"materials on which a court relies in determining the litigants' substantive rights.\"); \n36 \n\nId.  at 409 (applying the presumption to documents relied upon for  an  informed \njudgment and material to the court's deliberations); San Jose Mercury News, Inc. v. \nU.S.  Dist.  Court,  187 F.3d 1096,  1102 (9th Cir.  1999) (recognizing centrality of \ndocuments to which the common law right applies in reaching a final determination). \nIn Joy v. North, the Second Circuit observed, \nAt  the  adjudication  stage ... very  different  considerations  apply.  An \nadjudication is a formal act of government, the basis of which should, absent \nexceptional circumstances, be subject to public scrutiny. We simply do not \nunderstand the argument that derivative actions may be routinely dismissed \non the basis of secret documents. \nJoy v.  North, 692 F.2d 880 (2d Cir.  1982). In determining whether documents are \nmaterial to the adjudication, the inquiry does not rest, in any form, on the nature of \nthe court or the subject matter under consideration. The emphasis is on the type of \ndocument. \nJudicial opinions lay at the heart of the judicial function. They are not just useful \nto the court in making a final determination, but they are the adjudication of the \nmatter itself. They are absolutely necessary to the judicial process. What is being \nsought in this case are four judicial opinions. There can be no question that they are \nthus judicial records to which the common law right of access attaches. \n2.  The four opinions being sought are entitled to a strong presumption of \naccess. \n\"Once the court has determined that the documents are judicial documents and \nthat therefore a common law presumption of access attaches, it must determine the \n37 \n\nweight of that presumption.\" Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 119. As explained by the Second \nCircuit, \n[T]he weight to be given the presumption of access must be governed by the \nrole of the material at issue in the exercise of Article III judicial power and \nthe resultant value of such information to those monitoring the federal courts. \nGenerally, the information will fall somewhere on a continuum from matters \nthat directly  affect  an  adjudication to  matters  that  come  within  a  court's \npurview solely to insure their irrelevance. \nUnited States v. Amodeo (Amodeo II), 71  F.3d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir. 1995). See also \nLugosch, 435 F.3d at 119. As the matter moves towards final resolution, the burden \nincreases  to  demonstrate  why  the judicial  records  related  to  that  point  in  the \nadjudication should not be made public. An important tipping point towards the \npresumption occurs when judicial records attach to a dispositive motion, even where \nsuch motions have been filed under seal or protective order. See, e.g., Foltz v. State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins., 331 F.3d 1122, 1136 (9th Cir. 2003). \nJudicial opinions are not just matters affecting adjudication, but the disposition \nof the matter itself. As the court observed in Joy v. North, the final decision of the \ncourt, absent exceptional circumstances, should be in the public domain. Joy, 692 \nF.2d at 880. For centuries, U.S. courts have recognized that a strong presumption of \ncommon law right of access attaches to opinions. \nThe decisions and opinions of the justices are the authorized expositions and \ninterpretations of the laws,  which are  binding upon all  the citizens.  They \ndeclare  the  unwritten  law,  and  construe  and  declare  the  meaning  of the \nstatutes. Every citizen is presumed to know the law thus declared, and it needs \nno argument to show that justice requires that all should have free access to \n38 \n\nthe opinions, and that it is against sound public policy to prevent this, or to \nsuppress and keep from the earliest knowledge of the public the statutes, or \nthe decisions and opinions of the justices. Such opinions stand, upon principle, \non substantially the same footing as the statutes enacted by the legislature. It \ncan hardly be contended that it would be within the constitutional power of \nthe legislature to enact that the statutes and opinions should not be made \nknown to  the public  ....  The policy of the state always has been that the \nopinions of the justices, after they are delivered, belong to the public. \nNash v.  Lathrop, 142 Mass. 29, 35-36 (1886) (cited by Banks v.  Manchester, 128 \nU.S. 244, 253-54 (1888)). \nThe judiciary bears the responsibility of making its opinions publicly available. \nWithout public access to judicial decisions, the law itself is incomplete: \nAs ours is a common-law system based on the \"directive force\" of precedents, \nits effective and efficient functioning demands wide dissemination of judicial \ndecisions .... Even that part of the law which consists of codified statutes is \nincomplete without the accompanying body of judicial decisions construing \nthe statutes. Accordingly, under our system ofj urisprudence the judiciary has \nthe duty of publishing and disseminating its decisions. \ng \nLowenschuss v.  W. Puhl  Co., 542 F.2d 180, 185 (3d Cir. 1976) (quoting Benjamin \nN. Cardozo, The Nature oft he Judicial Process 20, 21-22 ( 1963) ). \nThe FISC generally operates  in  secrecy; nevertheless,  it  is  a court of public \nrecord. Its opinions create, interpret and apply the law, and they act as precedent. \nSee FISCR Am. Br. at 6-7. Under the common law test, which is based purely on the \ntype of document being sought, the four opinions being sought are entitled to a strong \npresumption of access. \n39 \n\n3.  Under the common law balancing test, the FISC is required to ensure that \nthe withholding of any material is supported by articulable facts known \nto the court, and not on the basis of mere supposition. \nOnce  establishing the  weight  of the  presumption  of access,  the  FISC  must \n\"balance competing considerations against  it,\" Amodeo II,  71F.  3d at  1050; for \n\"although the common law right creates a strong presumption in favor of access, the \npresumption can be overcome by sufficiently important countervailing interests.\" \nSan Jose Mercury News,  187 F.3d at  1102. The circuits apply different tests, but \neven under the most lenient applicable test, at a minimum, the decision must be \nsupported by articulable facts known to the court, and not on the basis of mere \nsupposition. \nAt  the  most  public  access-committed  end  of the  balancing  spectrum  is  the \n\"compelling  circumstances\"  test,  which  is  followed  by  the  Second  and  Ninth \nCircuits.  Under this approach,  \"only the  most  compelling circumstances  should \nprevent contemporaneous public access to\" judicial records. In  re Application of \nNat'/ Broad.  Co., 635 F.2d at 952. See also  Valley Broad.  Co., 798 F.2d at 1293; \nSan Jose Mercury News., 187 F.3d at 1102-03 (party seeking to block public access \nmust articulate compelling reasons backed by specific factual findings).  In In re \nApplication of Nat 'I Broad. Co., the court relied upon Richmond Newspapers, Inc. \nv.  Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980) and Nebraska Press Ass 'n. v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 \n(1976). 635 F.2d at 951-952. The court reasoned that because the common law right \n40 \n\nof access advances the same matters protected by the First Amendment, the two \nrights of access have comparable bounds. Id.  at 951-53. Elaborating on the factors \nthat would be relevant to the balancing test, the Ninth Circuit emphasized, \ncourts should consider all relevant factors, including: \"the public interest in \nunderstanding the judicial process  and whether disclosure  of the  material \ncould result in improper use of the material for scandalous or libelous purpose \nor infringement upon  trade  secrets ... After taking  all  relevant  factors  into \nconsideration, the district court must base its decision on a compelling reason \nand articulate the factual basis for its ruling, without relying on hypothesis or \nconjecture.\" \nFoltz, 331  F.3d at 1135 (quoting and citing Hagestad v.  Tragesser, 49 F.3d 1430, \n1434 (9th Cir. 1995)).18 Part of the reason for the necessity of articulating facts on \nwhich the decision is based is that it allows \"for meaningful 'appellate review of \nwhether relevant factors were considered and given appropriate weight.\"' Id. (citing \nHagestad, 49 F.3d at 1434). \nAt  the  other  end  of the  spectrum  is  a  general  balancing  test  that  gives  a \ndefendant's competing fair trial rights precedence. Belo Broad. Corp v.  Clark, 654 \nF.2d 423, 431  (5th Cir.  1981). This approach is loosely consistent with Nixon, in \nwhich the court implied that a balancing approach to access is required. Nixon, 435 \n18 The Ninth Circuit does not extend the right of access to search warrant materials \nduring pre-indictment investigations. See Times  Mirror Co.  v.  United States, 873 \nF.2d 1210, 1219 (9th Cir. 1989) (note that the case held the same thing in regard to \n; \nII   the Ninth Amendment public right of access). It also does not apply the right to \n.I \n1  materials filed under seal in nondipositive motions. Phillips ex rel. Estates of byrd \n1  v. Gen. Motors Corp., 307 F.3d 1206, 1213 (9th Cir. 2002). \n~ \n;!  41 \n\nU.S. at 602-603. But the Belo court went further, being willing \"to err, if err we must, \non the side of generosity in the protection of a defendant's right to a fair trial before \nan impartial jury.\" Belo Broad. Corp., 654 F.2d at 431. The Fifth Circuit's primary \nconcern in constructing this test was to protect defendants' Sixth Amendment rights. \nThree circuits (the Third, Seventh, and D.C. Circuits) adopt the middle ground: \nthat the trial court start with \"a strong presumption\" in favor of access, which can be \novercome only \"on the basis of articulable facts known to the court, not on the basis \nof unsupported hypothesis or conjecture.\" Edwards, 672 F.2d at 1294. See also In re \nApplication of Nat 'I Broad. Co., 653 F.2d at 613 (only if \"justice so requires\" can \nthe presumption be overcome); United States v.  Criden, 648 F.2d 814, 823 (3d Cir. \n1981) (recognizing a strong presumption of public access to evidentiary material); \nUnited States v.  Hubbard, 650 F.2d 293, 317-22 (D.C. Cir.  1981) (laying out six \nfactors for a court to consider in determining whether to make documents public). \nIn Edwards,  the  court tried to follow Nixon,  balancing the presumption against \nappropriate limitations: \nWhile we are unwilling to go so far as the Second Circuit's statement that only \nexceptional circumstances will justify non-access, we hold that there  is  a \nstrong presumption in support of the common law right to inspect and copy \njudicial records.  Where there is  a clash between the common law right of \naccess and a defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial, a court may deny \naccess, but only on the basis of articulated facts known to the court, not on the \nbasis of unsupported hypothesis or conjecture ... We stress that it is vital for a \ncourt to clearly state the basis of its ruling, so as to permit appellate review of \nwhether the relevant factors were considered and given appropriate weight. \n42 \n\nEdwards, 672 F.2d at 1294 (footnote and citations omitted). In Criden, Judge Joseph \nWeis in his concurrence noted that some considerations that might swing the balance \nagainst access would be improper use of the documents, \"including publication of \nscandalous, libelous, pornographic, or trade secret materials; infringement of fair \ntrial rights of the defendants or third persons; and residual privacy rights.\" Criden, \n648 F.2d at 830 (Weis, J., concurring). \nIn the context of the FISC, the balancing test applied by the Third, Seventh, and \nD.C. Circuits is the most applicable. At some level, a convincing argument could be \nmade that the \"compelling circumstances\" test followed by the FISC is already met \nby the statutory requirements and the foreign intelligence specialization of the court. \nOn the other hand, the approach followed by the Fifth Circuit, which grants the \ndefendant extra weight, stems from the court's commitment ensuring that justice \nresults from the progress of a trial. The types of matters that come before the FISC \nare  generally  different  in  kind.  To  the  extent  that  Sixth  Amendment  concerns \npresent, moreover, they can be addressed by the factors considered by the court in \ntailoring the test to each context. \nWe  are  thus  left  with  the  third  approach,  which  states  that  where  a  strong \npresumption of public access exists, it can only be overcome based on articulable \nfacts and not on general national security assertions. This approach is consistent with \nthe  district  courts  which  also,  with  some regularity,  confront matters  involving \n43 \n\nnational security and classification. See Am. App. at 71-98. Further, it would ensure \nthat the record is robust enough for the appellate court, should any re-examination \nbe necessary. \nThe FISC will want to construct relevant areas to consider in determining whether \nto make all or portions of its opinions public. In United States v. Hubbard, the D.C. \nCircuit laid out several factors. 650 F.2d at 317-22. These elements are adaptable to \nthe national security context.  First, the FISC could consider the need for  public \naccess to the documents at issue. Application of this will differ from context to \ncontext, depending upon the subject matter of the issues being adjudicated and the \nbroader context. To the extent that matters oflaw are involved, for instance, the court \nmay shift the balance in favor of disclosure. On the other hand, to the extent that \nmatters of sources and specific methods may be revealed, the balance may shift away \nfrom public access. Second, the FISC could look at the public use of the documents. \nTo  the  extent that  certain  authorities  are  subject  to  renewal,  for  instance,  then \ninformation about the statutory interpretation and the application of the law may be \nparticularly important for the public discourse. Third, the FISC may look to whether \nand to what extent the government objects to the release of certain  information. \nInstead of simply assuming that the full opinion should be withheld, the government \nwould have to provide articulable facts  about why certain information should be \nredacted. Fourth, the FISC should look at the extent to which the opinion impacts \n44 \n\nconstitutional rights, such as citizens' Fourth Amendment interests. Where there is \na significant impact, the fulcrum would shift, creating a stronger presumption of \ndisclosure.  On  the  other hand,  where  matters  may relate  primarily to  particular \ntargets or selectors, for instance, there may be less of a necessity, and greater risk, \nin disclosure. Fifth, to the extent that release of all or portions of the opinions may \nprejudice  ongoing  investigations  or  trials,  the  Court  would  want  to  be  more \ncircumspect about making the information public. \nThe FISC, of course, could develop its own approach, such as that used in the \nD.C. Circuit to scrutinize classification assertions in the FOIA context. For instance, \nit could apply a test based on reasonableness, good faith, specificity, and plausibility. \nAm. Br. at 29. See also Gardels v. CIA, 689 F.2d 1100 (D.D.C. 1982). But whichever \nbalancing test the court decides to adopt, it is clear that a strong presumption applies \nto release of the opinions. At a minimum, this means, under the common law right \nof access,  that  articulable  facts  and  not  conjecture  must  undergird  the  court's \ndecision to withhold material. \nB. Movants have a First Amendment right of access to the opinions, subject to \nredactions justified by the government to the court's satisfaction. \nThe public and press also have a \"qualified First Amendment right to attend \njudicial proceedings and to access certain judicial documents.\" Hartford Courant \n45 \n\nCo.  v. Pellegrino, 380 F.3d 83, 91  (2d Cir. 2004).19  In determining which records \nare entitled to a First Amendment right of access, the court must ascertain whether \nthe judicial records \"have historically been open to the press and general public\" as \nwell as whether \"public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of \nthe particular process in question.\"20 Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 1, 8. Under the \n19 The First Amendment right of access attaches to numerous judicial records. See, \ne.g.,ln re Providence Journal Co., 293 F.3d at 10-13 (applied to memoranda oflaw); \nPhoenix Newspapers, Inc.  v.  U.S.  Dist. Court for Dist. of Ariz., 156 F.3d 940, 948 \n(9th Cir.  1998) (transcripts of closed criminal proceedings); Grove Fresh Distrib., \nInc. v. Everfresh Juice Co., 24 F.3d 893, 897 (7th Cir. 1994) (noting that \"[t]he First \nAmendment  presumes  that  there  is  a  right  of  access  to  proceedings  and \ndocuments.\"); Globe Newspaper Co. v. Pokaski, 868 F.2d 497, 505 (1st Cir.  1989) \n(\"after Richmond Newspapers, a blanket prohibition on the disclosure of records of \nclosed criminal cases .. .implicates the First Amendment\"); In re Search  Warrant, \n855 F.2d 569, 573 (8th Cir. 1988) (although \"[t]he Supreme Court has not addressed \nthe  question  whether  the  First  Amendment  right  of public  access  extend  to \ndocuments,\" \"[w]e are persuaded that\" it \"does extend to the documents filed in \nsupport of search warrant applications.\"); Rushford v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., \n846 F.2d 249, 253 (4th Cir.  1988) (documents filed in connection with summary \njudgment  motion).  This  includes,  most  particularly,  the  final  determination  of \nmatters before the court. \"[l]t would be anomalous\" for the First Amendment to \napply to some judicial records but not to \"the court's opinion itself. Doe, 749 F.3d at \n267-68. See also United States v.  Mentzos, 462 F .3d 830, 843 n.4 (8th Cir. 2006) \n(denying motion to file opinion under seal \"because the decisions of the court are a \nmatter of public record.\"). In light of the increasing emphasis on the public right of \naccess  as  the  proceedings  and  documents  approach  final  adjudication,  there  is \nsomething  distinctly  odd  about  the  government's  argument  that  the  First \nAmendment right of access does not attach to a final adjudication itself. The only \narguments offered in support go to the classified nature of the FISC's proceedings, \nbypassing the doctrine's structural emphasis on approaching the final determination. \nI therefore here focus on the application of the test specifically to the context of the \nFISC. \n20 It is worth noting here that two different approaches have been adopted to ascertain \nwhether \"the public and the press should receive First Amendment protection in their \n46 \n\nexperience and logic tests, Movants are entitled to a First Amendment right of access \nto the four opinions. \n1.  The four opinions meet the three possible ways in which \"experience\" can \nbe analyzed: by common law, by the history of that particular court, and \nby the history of other, similarly-situated courts. \nIn determining experience, there are three possible questions that could be posed: \nhow the documents in question are treated based on the common law right of access, \nhow this particular court treats such documents, and how similarly-situated courts \nhave treated such documents. The Government ignores the first and last questions, \ninstead focusing on the second, and arguing that based on statute and practice, FISC \nproceedings  and  documents  are  not  available  to  the  public  and,  therefore,  the \nopinions in question fail the experience prong of Press-Enterprise II. That argument \nis based on an antiquated understanding of FISC opinions and their availability in \nthe public domain. It also bypasses the other two questions, which are certainly \nattempts to access certain judicial documents.\" Hartford Courant Co., 380 F.3d at \n92. The first is the experience and logic test from Press-Enterprise II, addressed \nabove.  The second, which also derives from  Press-Enterprise II,  examines \"the \nextent to  which the judicial documents  are  4 derived  from  or  [are]  a  necessary \ncorollary of the capacity to attend the relevant proceedings.\"' Lugosch, 435 F .3d at \n120 (quoting Press-Enterprise JI, 478 U.S. at 93). In light of the closed nature of \nmost FISC proceedings, as established by Congress, this brief focuses on the first \napproach. It is here that the distinction I drew in my opening brief to the FISCR \nbetween \"proceedings\" and judicial opinions comes directly into play. See FISCR \nAm. Br. at 8-9. Judicial opinions are not a transcript of what occurred during a \nparticular proceeding. They are a final judgment issued by the court on the \nmatter before it. \n47 \n\nprobative, if not dispositive of whether the experience prong is met by the opinions \nin question. \nIn regard to the first question, courts \"have generally invoked the common law \nright of access to judicial documents in support of finding a history of openness.\" \nPress-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 8. See also In re Application ofN  .Y.  Times Co.for \nAccess to  Certain Sealed Court Records, 585 F.  Supp.  2d 83, 92  (D.D.C. 2008) \n(relying on the existence of a common law right of access in establishing historical \nevidence for finding a First Amendment right of access). As established above, the \ncommon law right of public access clearly applies to judicial opinions. \nIn relation to the second question, although the government has argued that FISC \nproceedings  are  secret and that orders  submitted to  the  FISC  are  sealed,  it has \noverlooked a critical point: FISC opinions typically are not, as a class, hidden from \npublic view. In advancing its argument, the government relies in part on the court's \n2007 decision. On that occasion, Judge Bates relied on \"an unquestioned tradition \nof secrecy, based on the vitally important need to protect national security\" to deny \nMovants, on the merits, a First Amendment right of access. In re Motion for Release \nof Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 490-91. \nThis case can be distinguished in two critical ways. First, Movants in the 2007 \nmotion were seeking access to \"court orders and government pleadings\" related to \nsection 702. Id.  at 485. Judge Bates noted that \"The requested records are being \n48 \n\nmaintained  under  a  comprehensive  statutory  scheme  designed  to  protect  FISC \nrecords from routine public disclosure.\" Id.  at 491. Movants in this case, however, \nare not seeking access to court orders and government pleadings. They are seeking \naccess  to  four  FISC  opinions,  which  are  different  in  kind  than  underlying \napplications, pleadings, and orders. \nSecond, at the time Judge Bates issued his opinion,  there were only 3 FISC \nopinions in the public domain. 21  Over the past decade, it has become increasingly \ncommon for  FISC opinions to be released.  There are now more than 60  FISC \nopinions and 115 orders publicly available in full or partially-redacted form.22 The \nnature of the court's work, moreover, has shifted. From issuing only one opinion \nprior to 2001, over the past seventeen years, the court increasingly has had to address \n21 See In re Sealed Case, 310 F .3d 717 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2002); In re All Matters \nSubmitted to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, 218 F.

The experience of the court is shifting: not only is it writing more opinions, \nbut these opinions, albeit in redacted form, are publicly available. This suggests that \neven when the question focuses exclusively on the FISC, the experience prong is \nsatisfied. \nCourts, however, do not look simply to the experience of the particular court. \nInstead, they ask the third question, which applies the experience test \"to that type \nor kind of hearing throughout the U.S.\" El Vocero de Puerto Rico (Caribbean 1nt'l \nNews Corp.) v. Puerto Rico, 508 U.S. 147, 150 (1993) (per curiam) (quoting Rivera \nPuig v.  Garcia Rosario, 983 F .2d 311, 323 (1st Cir. 1992)). Even Press-Enterprise \nII,  in  evaluating  California  pre-trial  hearings,  for  instance,  looked  both  to  the \npractices in other states as well as to other types of hearings-including the probable \ncause hearing in Aaron Burr's 1807 trial for treason. Press-Enterprise 11, 478 U.S. \nat I 0-11. Courts even look to the experience of similarly-situated courts prior to the \nfounding and in different countries. In Hartford Courant Co., the Second Circuit, \nfor example, looked to \"Early English usage,\" Tomlins 's Law Dictionary of 1809, \nand \"the first years of the Republic\" to ascertain whether clerks generally maintained \ndocket sheets for purposes of the historical prong. Hartford Courant, 380 F.3d at 94. \nThe  First  Circuit  suggested  that  \"[t]radition  is  not  meant ... to  be  construed  [] \nnarrowly.\" In re Boston Herald, Inc., 321 F.3d 174, 184 (1st Cir. 2003). The court \n50 \n\nthus  looked \"also to  analogous proceedings and documents of the same type or \nkind.\" Id. (internal quotations omitted). \nIn the immediate case, there are two possible points of comparison within the \nUnited States and within the past decade, both of which unquestionably place the \nfour opinions being sought within the reach of the First Amendment. First, the other \nthree specialized Article III courts (the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, \nthe  U.S.  Court  of International  Trade,  and  the  Judicial  Panel  on  Multidistrict \nLitigation), which  are all courts of record, routinely make their opinions readily \navailable. See Am. App. A. As an historical matter, moreover, every single one of \nthe  now-defunct  Article  Ill specialized courts  (the  four  Customs  Courts,  two \nEmergency Courts of Appeals, Commerce Court, Special Railroad Court, and Court \nof Claims) likewise published their opinions. See Am. App. A. \nSecond,  without  question,  all  other  Article  III  courts  routinely  make  their \nopinions  publicly  available.  The  common  law  system,  and  our  democratic \ninstitutions of government, depend upon it. See FISCR Am. Br. at 24-27.

Public access to the four opinions also meets the logic prong, playing \"a \nsignificant positive role\" in the functioning of the judicial process. \nThe logic prong of Press-Enterprise II requires that public access to the judicial \nrecords play \"a significant positive role\" in the functioning of the judicial process. \nPress-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 1, 9, 11.

Access  to  this  court's \nopinions,  in particular, is particularly vital.  FISC opinions address weighty and \nimportant matters of constitutional and statutory law, which daily impact citizens' \nrights. They also demonstrate the extent to which the executive complies with legal \nconstraints and how efficiently or well agencies operate. FISC opinions address \nnovel and significant applications  of the  law.  These are  matters  of vital public \nimportance. \na.

FISC opinions demonstrate how the executive branch implements \nthe law and the extent to which the government fails to comply \nwith the law. \nIn addition to approving targeting and minimization procedures, \"the Court must \nexamine the manner in which the government has implemented thern.\"25 To fulfill \nits  responsibility,  the  Court  enquires  into  government  practice,  requires  the \ngovernment to correct any material facts, and demands that the government disclose \nany instances of non-compliance to the court. See FISC R. of P.  13(a), (b). These \nmechanisms reveal government actions that fall outside statutory and constitutional \nbounds. In this capacity, FISC opinions reveal numerous instances where the \ngovernment has acted outside statutory and constitutional constraints. \nFrom 2011 to 2016, for instance, NSA minimization procedures prohibited the \nuse of U.S. person identifiers to query upstream collection.

Because of the Fourth Amendment issues at stake, the court \ncould  not  confirm that the  2016  certifications  complied with  the  statutory  and \nconstitutional  requirements,  requiring  an  extension  for  the  NSA  to  obtain \ninformation necessary to make this determination.

Because it would result in NSA obtaining the records of \nU.S.  persons  inside  the  United  States,  not  themselves  the  subject  of  any \ninvestigation, the Court ordered that access to the archived data would only occur: \n\"when NSA has identified a known telephone identifier for which, based on the \nfactual  and  practical  considerations  of everyday  life  on  which  reasonable  and \nprudent persons act, there are facts giving rise to a reasonable, articulable suspicion \nthat the telephone identifier is associated with [REDACTED].\" Id. at 3. \nIn January 2009, the government informed the court that for more than two years \n(May 2006 to January 2009) the NSA had not been complying with the court order. \nTo  contrary,  \"only  1,935  of the  17,835  identifiers  on the  alert  list were  RAS-\napproved.\"  Id.  at  4  n.2.  \"Thus,  since  the  earliest  days  of the  FISC-authorized \ncollection  of call-detail  records  by the  NSA,  the  NSA  [had]  on  a  daily  basis\" \naccessed the metadata in violation of the minimization procedures. Id. at 4-5. For the \n56 \n\nFISC, the government's explanation for its actions was \"illogical\" and \"strain[ ed] \ncredulity.\" Id. at 5. \nIn a section of his opinion labeled, \"Misrepresentations to the  Court,\" Judge \nReggie Walton spelled out the inaccurate descriptions of the alert process submitted \nby the NSA to the Court. The agency had stated that it was only after \"concluding \nthat each of the telephone numbers satisfied the [RAS standard] was a number added \nto the list. Id. at 7. This turned out to be untrue, despite repeated representations to \nthe court. Id. at 8. The court recognized that the ''vast collection program\" had been \n\"premised on a flawed depiction of how the NSA uses BR metadata.\" Id. at 10-11. \n\"This  misperception  by  the  FISC  existed  from  the  inception  of its  authorized \ncollection in May 2006, buttressed by repeated inaccurate statements made in the \ngovernment's submissions, and despite a government-devised and Court-mandated \noversight regime.\" The court concluded, \"The minimization procedures ... approved \nand adopted as binding by the orders of the FISC have been so frequently and \nsystematically violated that it can fairly be said that this critical element of the \noverall BR regime has never functioned effectively.\" Id. at 11. The court stated, \nin light of the scale of this  bulk collection program, the Court must rely \nheavily on the government ... To approve such a program, the Court must have \nevery confidence that the government is doing its utmost to ensure that those \nresponsible for implementation fully comply with  the Court's orders.

In  2007,  for  instance,  DOJ  applied  for \npermission to implement an early warning system to alert the government to the \npresence of foreign powers and agents of foreign powers in the United States, noting \nthat  the  new  procedures  \"would  enable  the  Government  to  direct  electronic \nsurveillance with a much higher degree of speed and agility than would be possible \nthrough the filing ofindividual FISA applications.\" Memorandum of Law in Support \nof Application for Authority to Conduct Electronic Surveillance of [REDACTED] \nat  12,  In  re  [REDACTED],  No.  [REDACTED]  (FISA  Ct.

For instance, the \ngovernment  crafted  a  new  definition  of \"facility\"  that  significantly  altered  the \nvolume of communications that could be collected. See Order and Memorandum \nOpinion,  In  re  [REDACTED],  No.  [REDACTED]  (FISA  Ct.

It convinced the \ncourt to allow it to collect information not just to or from selectors, but also \"about\" \nthem. See Order at *12, In re [REDACTED}, No. [REDACTED] (FISA Ct. May 31, \n2007) (Vinson, J.), (FISCR Am. App. G 525). And it argued that the NSA, not the \ncourt, makes probable cause findings for selectors. See Order and Mem. Op., In re \n[REDACTED}, No. [REDACTED] (FISA Ct. Apr. 3, 2007), (FISCR Am. App. G \n554). \nAt times, the FISC has been forced to push back against government requests and \nstatutory interpretations. It has raised concern about the government's \"expansive \ninterpretation  of the  relevant  statutory  provisions.\"  Suppl.  Op.  and  Amend.  to \nPrimary Order at *3-4, [REDACTED] (FISA Ct.) (Bates, J.), (FISCR Am. App. G \n614). In EFFv.

On \n62 \n\nanother occasion Judge John  Bates reflected  on the  implications of government \ninterpretations, stating, \nThe current application relies on this prior framework, but also seeks to expand \nauthorization in ways that test the limits of what the applicable FISA provisions will \nbear. It also raises issues that are closely related to serious compliance problems that \nhave characterized the government's implementation of prior FISC orders. \nMemorandum  Opinion,  [REDACTED],  No.  PRITT  [REDACTED]  (FISA  Ct.) \n(Bates, J.), https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/l l 18/CLEANEDPRTT 2.pdf). \nThe logic test requires that the court consider whether the release of the judicial \ndocuments will have a significant positive role.  Because of their overwhelming \nimportance for constitutional doctrine, their direct impact on citizens' rights, their \nrevelation of government failure to comply with the law, and their efforts to apply \nthe law to new and significant areas, FISC opinions meet the logic test of Press-\nEnterprise II. \nC. Under the First Amendment, the FISC must ensure that the withholding \nof any  opinion  or portion  thereof is  narrowly  tailored  to  meet  the \ndemands of national security. \nOnce the First Amendment right of access attaches, there is a strong presumption \nof access; however, it  is  not absolute.  \"Broad and general findings  by the trial \ncourt ... are not sufficient to justify closure.\" In re N. Y.  Times Co., 828 F .2d 110, 116 \n(2d Cir. 1987). A First Amendment right of access can be denied only by proof of a \n\"compelling governmental interest\" and proof that the denial is \"narrowly tailored \n63 \n\nto  serve  that  interest.\"  Globe Newspaper,  457  U.S.  at  606-07.

Just  because  FISC  opinions  deal  with  classification,  national  security \nmatters, or interpretations of FISA, however, is not enough to put them beyond \npublic reach. \nIn 2008, newspapers  sought access  to  search warrants,  warrant  applications, \nsupporting affidavits, court orders, and returns for all warrants that the government \nrequested in relation to its anthrax investigation. Jn re Application ofN. Y.  Times Co. \nfor Access to Certain Sealed Court Records, 585 F. Supp. 2d at 88. Judge Royce C. \nLamberth, also (former) presiding judge of the FISC, held that there was a First \nAmendment qualified right of access to the material. While the government had a \ncompelling interest in not disclosing the identity of informants, that interest could \nbe protected simply by redacting the names. 585 F. Supp. 2d at 91. \n64 \n\nThe response brief fails to address the myriad cases in which the courts push back \nagainst  executive  branch  classification  decisions.  Numerous  opinions  detail the \nscope and legality of intelligence collection under FISA. See, e.g., United States v. \nU.S.  Dist.  Court for  the  E.  Dist.  of Mich.,  407  U.S.  297  (1972)  (considering \nconstitutionality of warrantless wiretapping program conducted by the government \nto \"protect the national security\"); United States v. Duggan, 74 3 F .2d 59, 72-74 , 77 \n(2d Cir. 1984) (analyzing FISA's original \"purpose\" requirement, and holding that \n\"FISA does not violate the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment\"); \nJewel v.  NSA,  673  F.3d 902, 905 (9th Cir. 2011) (reversing dismissal of lawsuit \nchallenging \"widespread warrantless eavesdropping in the United States\"); In  re \nApplication for Pen Register & Trap/Trace Device with Cell Site Location Auth. (In \nre PR/IT with  CSL!},  396 F.  Supp.  2d 747,  748-49  (S.D.  Tex.  2005)  (refusing \ngovernment  request  to  seal  opinion  \"because  it  concerns  a  matter  of statutory \ninterpretation\"  and the  issue  explored \"has  serious  implications  for  the balance \nbetween privacy and law enforcement, and is a matter of first impression\"). \nIt is entirely feasible for this court to determine what materials should be withheld \nand which matters  of law  should be published.  FISC's own rules  of procedure \nsupport this fact. See FISC R. of P. 62. But in making its decisions, the FISC must \nmeet the demands of the First Amendment public right of access, which requires \nspecificity and has a strong presumption in favor of public access. The FISC is not \n65 \n\nalone: although the response brief does not directly respond, as noted at length in the \namicus opening brief, Courts regularly subject executive branch national security \nand classification assertions to scrutiny. \nThe court itself has already successfully applied the First Amendment right of \npublic access test. In 2013, after a third party motion for FISC records and under \ndirection from the court, the government identified a single opinions as being neither \nsubject to FOIA nor to FISC's 62(a) process. Submission of the United States, filed \non Oct. 4, 2013, at 2, Jn re Orders of This Court Interpreting§ 215 of the Patriot \nAct, Misc. No. 13-02, 2013 WL 5460064 (FISA Ct. Sept. 13, 2013), *8 (Saylor, J.). \nInitially, the DOJ determined that the opinion should be withheld in full.  Second \nSubmission of the United States, filed on Nov. 18, 2013, at 2. The court disagreed. \nJudge  Saylor  wrote  \"the  government  has  provided  no  explanation  of  this \nconclusion,\" and ordered the DOJ to submit \"a detailed explanation of its conclusion \nthat the Opinion is classified in full and cannot be made public, even in a redacted \nform.\" Order issued on Nov. 20, 2013, at 2. The court directed DOJ to provide an \nunclassified or redacted version which, \"at a minimum, must clearly articulate the \ngovernment's legal arguments.\" Id. \nThe  government responded  to  the  court's  order,  saying  that  the  reason  the \nmaterial could not be made publicly available was because it was pertinent to an \nongoing criminal case. Submission of the United States, filed on Dec. 20, 2013, at \n66 \n\n2-3. Nevertheless, the government offered to publish a redacted version. Id.  The \ncourt  was  not  satisfied.  It  questioned  the  breadth  of suggested  redactions  and \n\"'members of the Court's legal staff met with attorneys\" from NSD in January 2014 \nto convey the concerns. In re Orders oft his Court Interpreting Section 215 ofP  atriot \nAct, Aug. 7, 2014, *3. \nThe government then filed  a second submission Feb.  6,  2014,  stating, \"'[i]n \nresponse to questions from the Court's staff, and upon further review of the [Feb. \n19,  2013]  Opinion,  the  government  has  determined  that  certain  additional \ninformation  in  the  Opinion  is  not  classified  and  the  release  of that  additional \ninformation would not jeopardize the ongoing investigation.'\" In re Orders of this \nCourt Interpreting Section 215 ofP  atriot Act, Aug. 7, 2014, *3. The court accepted \nthe Second Redaction Proposal. Id. \nThat process met the individualized test required by the First Amendment and \nlaid  out  by  Movants-namely,  that  the  material  withheld:  (a)  identifie[d]  an \nindividual who was  the subject of an  ongoing counterterrorism  investigation or \ndiscussed in detail certain activities of the subject; (b) describe[ d]  the records or \nother tangible things that the government sought to have produced in the related \nSection 215 application, including the identity of the producing party and how those \nrecords relate to the subject; and (c ) identifie[ d] certain associates of the subject and \ndescribe[ d] certain relevant activities of those associates; and describe[ d] specific \n67 \n\nintelligence sources and methods, as well as particular information obtained through \nthose sources and methods.\" *4. The court was further satisfied that \"compelling \ngovernment interests-specifically, the strong government interest in  effectively \npursuing  an  ongoing  counterterrorism  investigation  and  protecting  undisclosed \nintelligence sources and methods-support[e d] the withholding of information in \nthe February 19, 2013 Opinion.\" *4. In addition, ''each proposed redaction within \nthe  text  of that  opinion  [was]  narrowly  tailored  to  protect  those  compelling \ngovernment interests.\" *4. The court ensured that the legal reasoning was reasonably \n\"segregated from properly classified facts.\" *5. And the end result, according to the \ncourt, did not confuse or obscure the decision. To the contrary, it enhanced \"public \nunderstanding of the court's reasoning as to the legal issues presented.\" *5. The case \ndemonstrated, in vivid relief, that it is not only plausible for the FISC to apply the \nFirst Amendment public right of access to FISC opinions, but that it is beneficial for \nthe court to do so. \nIV.  THE  FLOODGATES  ARGUMENT  FLOATING  IN  THE \nBACKGROUND IS A RED HERRING. \nIn  the  background  section  of the  Government's  response  brief,  hints  of the \n\"floodgates of litigation\" argument infuse the discussion of efforts underway to \nobtain FISC opinions. Gov't Resp. Br. at 4-5 (\"this Court's docket has swollen to \ninclude a new category of cases in which it is being asked by parties to adjudicate \n68 \n\nrequests for the release of records.\") (internal quotations and citations omitted). If \nthe FISC were to find that a First Amendment right of public access applies to their \nopinions, such an argument might run, then anyone could ask to see them. The FISC \nis a court oflimited resources, and the result could be overwhelming. This argument \nit a red herring. It, and three critical rebuttals, should be brought to the surface. \nFirst,  of course the  public  wants  to  know  what these  opinions  say.  This  is \nprecisely the kind of information that the public ought to know. They should know \nwhat the law is, how it is being interpreted, and how the government implements its \nmeasures when individual rights are on the line. It is distinctly the province of the \nCourts to  say  what the  law  is.  Marbury,  5  U.S.  at  177.  And it  is  the  solemn \nresponsibility of the judiciary to provide this information to the People. Without that, \nthere is no rule of law. \nSecond, by making its opinions publicly available, the FISC fulfills a number of \nimportant interests, foremost amongst which is ensuring its own legitimacy. \"People \nin an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult \nfor them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.\" Press-Enterprise II, \n478 U.S. at 13 (quotations omitted). The administration of justice must not just be \nfair but be perceived to be fair. Globe Newspaper, 457 U.S. at 606. \"For a civilization \nfounded upon principles of ordered liberty to survive and flourish, its members must \nshare the conviction that they are governed equitably. That necessity ... mandates a \n69 \n\nsystem ofj ustice that demonstrates the fairness of the law to our citizens.\" Richmond \nNewspaper, 448 U.S. at 594. \nCourts are traditionally completely open. 27 The fact that the FISC operates in so \nmuch secrecy thus places it in a precarious position. See United States v. Are/, 533 \nF.3d 72, 83  (2d Cir. 2008) (\"Transparency is pivotal to public perception of the \njudiciary's legitimacy and independence.\"). One hardly need elaborate in the current \nenvironment how important this is in staving off the politicization of the judiciary \nand allowing the court to focus on the administration of justice. The FISC further \nprotects its independence by pushing back on efforts by the executive to control \njudicial records. The judiciary has staved off such efforts in the past. In the  19th \ncentury case of Drawbaugh, for  instance, the Patent Office moved the court to \npreserve the files in secrecy. The court responded, \n[I]t  must be  recollected that the  Patent  Office  is  a branch  of one  of the \nexecutive departments of the government, and that this is a public court of \nrecord, governed by very different principles and considerations, in respect to \nits records and proceedings, from those that apply to an executive department. \nThe rules of the Patent Office have no application to the proceedings of this \ncourt ... They may be very necessary and proper for conducting the affairs of \nthat office ... but it does not follow that similar rules should be adopted and \nenforced as applicable in an appellate court of record.\" \n27 See, e.g., Ex parte Drawbaugh, 2 App. D.C. at 407-408 (\"any attempt to maintain \nsecrecy, as to the records  of the  court, would seem to  be inconsistent with the \ncommon understanding of what belongs to a public court of record, to which all \npersons have the right of access, and to its records, according to long established \nusage and practice.\") \n70 \n\nEx parte Drawbaugh, 2 App. D.C. 404, 405, 1894 WL 11944 (D.C. Ct. App. 1894). \nAs  was  noted  in  the  amicus  opening  brief,  the  courts  regularly  push  back on \nclassification decisions and subject government claims to scrutiny. Am. Br. at 24-\n29; Am. App. at 71-98. Doing so matters not just for the rights in question, but for \nthe court's legitimacy as an independent body committed to the administration of \njustice. \nPublishing opinions also provides the FISC with valuable opportunities for public \ninspection-scrutiny with which the FISA judges are otherwise familiar. There is a \nsignificant amount of case law that supports this public feedback purpose behind the \nFirst Amendment public right of access to judicial records.  See,  e.g., Richmond \nNewspapers, 448 U.S. at 582 (Stevens, J. (concurring)). As the Second Circuit has \nexplained, \nThe presumption of access is based on the need for federal courts, although \nindependent-indeed, particularly because they are independent-to have a \nmeasure  of accountability  and  for  the  public  to  have  confidence  in  the \nadministration ofj ustice. Federal courts exercise powers under Article III that \nimpact upon virtually all citizens, but judges, once nominated and confirmed, \nserve for  life  unless  impeached through  a  process that is  politically and \npractically inconvenient to invoke. Although courts have a number of internal \nchecks, such as appellate review by multi-judge tribunals, professional and \npublic monitoring is an essential feature of democratic control. Monitoring \nboth provides judges with critical views of their work and deters arbitrary \njudicial behavior. Without monitoring, moreover, the public could have no \nconfidence in the conscientiousness, reasonableness, or honesty of judicial \nproceedings. Such monitoring is not possible without access to testimony and \ndocuments that are used in the performance of Article III functions. \n71 \n\nAmodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1048. See also Scheiner v.  Wallace, No. 93-cv-0062, 1996 \nWL  633226,  at  *1  (S.D.N.Y.  Oct.  31,  1996)  (\"The  public  interest  in  an \naccountable judiciary generally demands that the  reasons for a judgment be \nexposed to public scrutiny.\"  (citing Amodeo II,  71  F.3d at  1048-49);  United \nStates v. Burka, 289 A.2d 376, 379 (D.C. Ct. App.  1972) (\"we deem it highly \ninappropriate and unwise for trial judges ever to 'go off the record' ... Not just \nthe need for public scrutiny, but also the possibility of appellate review, demands \nthat everything said in court while in litigation be recorded and reported except \nin the most unusual circumstances.\"). \nThird, to the extent that the floodgates argument persists, it is overblown. In \na world in which the FISC strives to make its legal interpretations as public as \npossible, there will be no need for this type of litigation. The court will simply \nsubmit  its  opinions  to  the  appropriate  First  Amendment  analysis.  Once \nconsidering any challenge that may arise, the decision will apply to other efforts \nto get the same information. This is the system regularly followed by other courts \nin requests for the unsealing of records. Once addressed, the court's opinion \ncontrols other such inquiries.  Resources play a further role in  limiting such \nmotions: organizations and individuals are not going to waste time re-litigating \nmatters that are already settled by the court. \n72 \n\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the FISC properly has jurisdiction over the motion. \nMovants also have a common law and a First Amendment right of access to this \ncourt's  opinions.  In  applying  the  common  law,  the  court  must  consider \narticulable facts, not broad assertions of national security implications. A more \nstringent standard accompanies the First Amendment right of access: the FISC \nmust ensure that any withholding of any opinion or portion thereof is narrowly \ntailored to ensure that the demands of national security are met. \nIt may be that the court's final determination leaves the redactions in the four \nopinions exactly as they now stand. But that determination can only come after \nthe FISC applies the correct standard and makes the determination for itself. \nProfessor Laura K. Donohue \nAgnes N.

Selden, \n422 U.S. 490 (1975) .................................................................................................................. 1 \nlV \n\nArgument \nI.  The government improperly conflates standing and the merits. \nThe government commits the same error as the Opinion under review by analyzing \nMovants' standing based on the merits of their underlying claims. As Mov an ts explained in their \nopening brief, that approach contradicts settled law. See Movants' Br. 11-14. The Supreme \nCourt has repeatedly cautioned lower courts not to conflate standing and the merits, see, e.g., \nSteel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env 't, 523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998), and it has clearly instructed that \n\"standing in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiffs contention that particular conduct is \nillegal,\" Warth v. Selden, 422 U.S. 490, 500 (1975). \nTo establish standing, Movants need demonstrate only that the injury they complain of is \nto a \"judicially cognizable interest.\" Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167 ( 1997). The type of \ninjury alleged must be one that courts have recognized as an injury at common law, pursuant to \nan act of Congress, or under the Constitution. See, e.g., Sargeant v. Dixon, 130 F.3d 1067, 1069 \n(D.C. Cir. 1997); see also Joint Anti-Fascist Refagee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 152-53 \n(1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). A claimant need not prevail in its claim in order to establish \nstanding-it need only assert a concrete and particularized harm that the law regards as an \ninjury-in-fact. Thus, for instance, loss of money is an injury, bodily harm is an injury, and \ntrespass on property is an injury, see, e.g., Clinton v. City ofN . Y., 524 U.S. 417, 432-33 (1998), \nregardless of whether a claimant is ultimately entitled to relief for those injuries. See generally \nSpokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1549 (2016) (\"Because the doctrine of standing derives \nfrom the case-or-controversy requirement, and because that requirement in tum is grounded in \nhistorical practice, it is instructive to consider whether an alleged intangible harm has a close \nrelationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in \nEnglish or American courts.\"). \n\nThere is no question that the denial of access to records is an injury-in-fact, one \nrecognized at common law, by acts of Congress, and under the Constitution. See, e.g., Nixon v. \nWarner Comm 'ns Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597-98 (1978) (injury supporting common-law claims); \nPub. Citizen v. Dep 't ofJ ustice, 491 U.S. 440, 449 (1989) (injury supporting statutory claims); \nPress-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court (\"Press-Enterprise IF'), 4 78 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1986) (injury \nsupporting constitutional claims). Indeed, with almost complete uniformity, the courts have \nrecognized that the denial of access to judicial documents-such as those Movants seek-is an \ninjury to a \"judicially cognizable interest\" and thus confers standing. See Movants' Br. 6- 11; see \nalso Nixon, 435 U.S. at 597-98 (\"The interest necessary to support the issuance of a writ \ncompelling access has been found, for example, in the citizen's desire to keep a watchful eye on \nthe workings of public agencies, and in a newspaper publisher's intention to publish information \nconcerning the operation of government.\" (citations omitted)); Carlson v. United States, 837 \nF.3d 753, 758-61 (7th Cir. 2016) (explaining that \"[t]he denial at the threshold of the right to \npetition for access inflicts an 'injury-in-fact'\"); Doe v. Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 264 (4th Cir. \n2014) (holding that intervenors' injury \"is formed by their inability to access judicial documents \nand materials filed in the proceedings below\"). \nFor this reason, courts have regularly adjudicated the merits of First Amendment claims \nof access even where they ultimately denied those claims on the merits. See, e.g., Pub. Citizen, \n491 U.S. at 449-50; Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817 (1974); Saxbe v. Wash. Post Co., 417 U.S. \n843 (1974); In re U.S. for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703(d), 707 F.3d 283, 290-92 \n(4th Cir. 2013); In re Search ofF  air Fin., 692 F.3d 424 (6th Cir. 2012); In re NY Times Co. to \nUnseal Wiretap & Search Warrant Materials, 577 F.3d 401, 409- 11 (2d Cir. 2009); Flynt v. \nRumsfeld, 355 F.3d 697 (D.C. Cir. 2004); NJ. Media Grp., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 308 F.3d 198 (3d \n2 \n\nCir. 2002); Baltimore Sun Co. v. Goetz, 886 F .2d 60, 64-65 (4th Cir. 1989); Times Mirror Co. v. \nUnited States, 873 F .2d 1210, 1212-18 (9th Cir. 1989); Nat 'l Broad. Co. v. DOJ, 735 F .2d 51, \n55 (2d Cir. 1984). That is true even where courts had previously denied a First Amendment right \nto access the class of judicial records sought. See, e.g., In re Documents 1, 2, 3 Search Warrant \nand Supporting Affidavits Relating to Kaczynski, MCR 96-6-H-CCL, 1996 WL 343429 (D. \nMont. Apr. 10, 1996) (news organizations had standing to seek warrant materials despite prior \nruling in Times Mirror Co. that no First Amendment right attaches to such materials). \nThe government ignores this precedent and fixates, instead, on the term \"legally protected \ninterest.\" Gov't Br. 7. That term appears occasionally in Supreme Court cases, but it does not \nmean that a plaintiff must establish a legal entitlement to relief to have standing. The Supreme \nCourt has rejected that notion many times. Rather, a \"legally protected interest\"-also known, \nmore accurately, as a \"judicially cognizable interest,\" Bennett, 520 U.S. at 167; see Judicial \nWatch, Inc. v. U.S. Senate, 432 F.3d 359, 363-64 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (Williams, J., concurring)-- \nmeans an interest recognized by courts or by law, such as injuries to common-law rights under \nproperty, contract, and tort law, see, e.g., Servicios Azucareros de Venez., CA. v. John Deere \nThibodeaux, Inc., 702 F.3d 794, 800 (5th Cir. 2012), or injuries to rights bestowed by the \nConstitution, see, e.g., Council ofI ns. Agents & Brokers v. Malasky-Arman, 522 F.3d 925, 931 \n(9th Cir. 2008). This requirement serves to distinguish injuries society recognizes as judicially \ncognizable, which give rise to a \"case or controversy,\" from those never thought fit for judicial \nresolution- such as wholly subjective, generalized, or abstract harms. See Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at \n1548-49. \nHere, the government does not dispute the fact that numerous courts, including the \nSupreme Court, have long recognized an interest in accessing judicial records. Nor does it \n3 \n\ndispute that the injury to that interest in this case is both concrete and particularized. See Gov't \nBr. 3. Accordingly, Movants have shown the type of injury necessary to satisfy standing. \nWhether their constitutional rights have been violated is another matter. \nThe three cases on which the government principally relies are not to the contrary. \nGriswold v. Driscoll did not involve a denial of access to judicial records- which courts have \nrecognized as an Article III injury for decades-or for that matter to any kind of records at all. \n616 F.3d 53 (1st Cir. 2010). Instead, the plaintiffs asserted a novel theory of harm, claiming that \nthey had been deprived of an educational curriculum reflecting diverse political viewpoints. Id. \nat 55-56. McConnell v. Federal Election Commission involved a similarly ungrounded claim of \nharm: the court held that the \"broad and diffuse\" standing theory presented by plaintiffs-\n\"curtailment of the scope of their participation in the electoral process\"- failed because the \npurported right had never been legally recognized. 540 U.S. 93, 227 (2003). The only reason \nthese cases analyzed standing and the merits together was that, in the absence of a recognized \nconcrete injury, the plaintiffs had to rely on their constitutional claim for both the substance of \ntheir claims and the basis for alleging that they had suffered injuries at all. See generally Spokeo, \n136 S. Ct. at 1549 (recognizing that some intangible harms are defined by the Constitution \nitself). By contrast, in right-of-access cases, courts have consistently found that a lack of access \nto court records and proceedings is concrete, particular, and judicially cognizable. See Movants' \nBr. 6-8.1 \n1 The government's third case-Bond v.  Utreras, 585 F.3d 1061 (7th Cir. 2009)-explicitly \nrecognized that members of the public have standing to seek access to \"judicial records,\" which \nis precisely what Movants seek here. Id. at 1073-74. To the extent that Bond suggests that courts \nmay collapse standing and the merits in right-of-access cases, Movants submit that it is at odds \nwith the Supreme Court's decisions and those of other circuit courts. \n4 \n\nII.  This Court's prior rejection of a right of access to its opinions does not affect its \njurisdiction to entertain Movants' motion. \nThe government appears to believe that the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider a claim \nthat it has previously rejected on the merits. Gov't Br. 6-7. This, too, is incorrect. The \njurisdictional rule the government posits does not exist. \nWhen presented with a right-of-access claim to the Court's own records, the FISC \npossesses subject-matter jurisdiction if the claim \"will be sustained if the Constitution and laws \nof the United States are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another.\" \nBell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 685 ( 1946). This is so even when a party fails to state a claim on \nwhich relief may be granted. Dismissal for failure to state a claim is a judgment on the merits \nthat may issue only \"after and not before [a] court has assumed jurisdiction over [a] \ncontroversy.\" Id. at 682. \nThe Supreme Court has, in rare circumstances, held jurisdiction to be lacking for truly \noutlandish claims or for claims that the Supreme Court itself has squarely foreclosed. See Oneida \nIndian Nation v. Cty. ofO  neida, 414 U.S. 661, 666-67 (1974). Ifa claim \"clearly appears to be \nimmaterial, wholly insubstantial and frivolous or otherwise so devoid of merit as not to involve a \nfederal controversy,\" it may be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Steel Co., 523 \nU.S. at 89. But here, the government does not contend that Movants' right-of-access claim is \ntruly outlandish or wholly insubstantial, and Judge Collyer did not find it to be so. The \ngovernment contends only that this Court has previously rejected similar claims on the merits. \nSee Gov't Br. 7. But the fact that a lower court has previously denied a claim on the merits has \nnever been enough to trigger this exceedingly narrow exception. \nIn order for a claim to be so completely foreclosed that the courts lack jurisdiction \naltogether, an issue must, at a minimum, have been definitively resolved by the Supreme Court. \n5 \n\nSee Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 89; Bell, 327 U.S. at 684; El-Shifa Pharm. Indus. Co. v. United States, \n607 F.3d 836, 849-50 (D.C. Cir. 2010). Even then, claims are squarely foreclosed if- and only \nif-their \"unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of [the Supreme Court] as \nto foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the questions sought to be raised \ncan be the subject of controversy.\" Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 538 (1974). \"[P]revious \ndecisions that merely render claims of doubtful or questionable merit\" do not squarely foreclose \nthem. Id. In other words, the claim must be \"essentially fictitious, wholly insubstantial, obviously \nfrivolous, and obviously without merit.\" Id. at 53 7 (internal citations omitted). In practice, this \nlimitation has applied extraordinarily infrequently-and for good reason. To read the \"squarely \nforeclosed\" limitation any more broadly would suggest that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction \nover Oliver Brown's challenge to the segregation of public schools in Topeka, Kansas, given the \nSupreme Court's earlier decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).2 \nWhile foreclosure might be appropriate in very rare instances, this is plainly not one. \nThere is no Supreme Court decision rendering Movants' claim obviously and wholly without \nmerit; to the contrary, dozens of federal courts have concluded that existing precedent permits \nfederal courts to entertain the merits of claims just like the one Movants present here. \nIndeed, the right-of-access claims in this proceeding illustrate why a prior loss on the \nmerits does not, and should not, deprive the Court of jurisdiction. Because the merits of \nMovants' claim tum in significant part on a factual analysis of the history of access to the types \nof records they seek, see Press-Enterprise JI, 4 78 U.S. at 8, 10- 11; see also Movants' Br. 14, it \nwould be incongruous to rule, categorically, that they lack standing to attempt to show what that \n2 Cf  Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), overruling Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 \n(1986), which had stated that the \"claim that a right to engage in such [homosexual] conduct is \n'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' or 'implicit in the concept of ordered \nliberty' is, at best, facetious.\" Id. at 194. \n6 \n\nhistory teaches. Future movants may make different showings, not least because the relevant \nhistory may change over time. See N. Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N. Y. City Transit Auth., 684 F.3d \n286, 299 (2d Cir. 2012) (Public-access cases \"focus not on formalistic descriptions of the \ngovernment proceeding but on the kind of work the proceeding actually does and on the First \nAmendment principles at stake .... [C]hanges in the organization of government do not exempt \nnew institutions from the purview of old rules. Rather, they lead us to ask how the new \ninstitutions fit into existing legal structures.\"). The question of whether those changing factual \npresentations alter the outcome of the case is one for the merits, not for standing. 3 \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Movants have standing to seek access to this Court's opinions. \n3 The government also argues that the Court may not consider a request to publish its opinions \nunder FISC Rule 62 because Movants lack standing. Gov't Br. 9-11. Movants did not address \nthis issue in their opening brief because it is beyond the scope of the Court's en bane briefing \norder. But the government is wrong for two reasons. First, Movants need not establish standing \nto request that the Court exercise its discretion, under Rule 62 and its inherent supervisory \npowers, to seek publication of its own opinions. As Judge Saylor observed in In re Orders oft his \nCourt Interpreting Sec. 2 I 5 oft he Patriot Act, it would make little sense to hold that the Court \ncannot so much as consider such requests for publication. No. Misc. 13-02, 2013 WL 5460064, \nat *5 (FISC Sept. 13, 2013). Second, even if Movants did have to establish Article III standing to \nsupport a request under Rule 62, the fact that Movants have been deprived of access to the \nCourt's opinions would, again, constitute a \"judicially cognizable interest\" sufficient to support \ntheir request. \n7 \n\nDated: May 1, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n/s/ Patrick Toomey \nDavid A.

Records at 1.  In fact, however, the four opinions responsive to the Movants' \nclaim have never been subject to a sealing order issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt (FISC).  Moreover, the Executive Branch has declassified those opinions in substantial \npart and each of them has been made public by the Executive Branch or the FISC. \n1 Hereinafter, this motion will be referred to as the \"Motion for the Release of Court Records\" and cited as \n\"Mot. for Release of Ct. Records.\"  The American Civil Liberties Union (\"ACLU\"), the American Civil Liberties \nUnion of the Nation's Capital (\"ACLU-NC\"), and the Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic (\"MFIAC\") \nwill be referred to collectively as \"the Movants.\"  Documents submitted by the parties and orders and opinions of \nthe Court in this matter are available on the Court's public website at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/public-filings. \n\nConsequently, what the Movants now seek is access to the redacted, non-public material within \nthose opinions, which remains classified by the Executive Branch. \nI.  Procedural Background. \nThe Movants filed the pending motion on November 7, 2013, in the wake of widely-\npublicized disclosures about the bulk collection of data by the United States government under \nFISA.  Mot. for Release of Ct. Records at 1-4.  The four opinions that address the legal basis for \nbulk collection under FISA were made public in 2013 and 2014 after classification reviews \nconducted by the Executive Branch and subject to redaction of text containing information that \nthe Executive Branch found to be classified.  The United States' Opposition to the Motion of the \nACLU for the Release of Court Records at 1-2 (\"Gov't Opp'n Br.\").  Before the filing of the \nMotion for the Release of Court Records, the FISC had published two of those opinions pursuant \nto FISC Rule of Procedure 62(a): \n•  Memorandum, In reApplication oft he Federal Bureau ofI nvestigation \nfor an Order Requiring the Production ofTangible Things From \n[Redacted}, No. BR 13-158 (Oct. 11, 2013) (McLaughlin, J.), available at \nhttp:/ /www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/BR %2013-\n158%20Memorandum-1.pdf; and \n•  Amended Memorandum Opinion, In reApplication oft he Federal Bureau \nofI nvestigation for an Order Requiring the Production of Tangible Things \nFrom [Redacted}, No. BR 13-109 (Aug. 29, 2013) (Eagan, J.), available \nat http://www.fisc. uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/BR%  2013-\n10 9%2 OOrder-1. pdf. \n!d. \nThe other two opinions were released by the Executive Branch: \n•  Opinion and Order, [Redacted], No. PRITT [Redacted] (Kollar-Kotelly, \nJ.), available at \nhttps://www.dni.gov/files/documents/1118/CLEANEDPRTT%201.pdf; \nand \n2 \n\n•  Memorandum Opinion, [Redacted], No. PRITT [Redacted] (Bates, J.), \nhttps://www.dni.gov/files/documents/1118/CLEANEDPRTT%202.pdf. \nOn January 25, 2017, ·the undersigned judge dismissed the pending motion on the ground \nthat the Movants lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to bring a claim based on a \nFirst Amendment right of public access. In re Opinions & Orders oft his Court Addressing Bulk \nCollection ofD  ata Under FISA, 2017 WL 427591 (FISA Ct. Jan. 25, 2017). The FISC, sitting \nen bane, reconsidered that dismissal sua sponte and issued an opinion on November 9, 2017, \nwhich held by a 6-5 vote that Article III's standing requirement was satisfied.  In re Opinions & \nOrders oft his Court Addressing Bulk Collection ofD  ata Under FISA, 2017 WL 5983865 (FISA \nCt. Nov. 9, 2017) (en bane).  The en bane FISC vacated the January 25,2017 opinion and \nremanded the matter to the undersigned judge for further consideration. I d.  at 9. \nOn January 5, 2018, however, the FISC certified the question ofMovants' Article III \nstanding to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISCR) pursuant to 50 U.S.C. \n§ 18030) \"because review by the FISCR would serve the interests of justice, a dispositive issue \nabout standing was involved, and the split among the FISC Judges was very close and involved a \ndifference of opinion about the law to apply, among other considerations.\"  In re Opinions & \n* \nOrders oft his Court Addressing Bulk Collection ofD  ata Under FISA, 2018 WL 396244 at  1 \n(FISA Ct. Jan. 5, 2018).  The FISCR accepted the certification on January 9, 2018, and appointed \nProfessor Laura K. Donohue to serve as amicus curiae.  In re Certification ofQ  uestions ofL aw \n2  Those opinions concerned the production of tangible things under 50 U.S.C. § 1861 or the installation \nand use of pen register/trap-and-trace (PR/TI) devices under § 1842. Congress has since amended §§ 1861 and \n1842 to require use of\"specific selection terms,\" thereby eliminating bulk collection under those provisions. See \nUSA FREEDOM Act of2015, Pub. L. 114-232 § 101(a), 129 Stat. 269-70 (codified at§ 1861(b)(2)(C)); § 101(b), \n129 Stat. 270 (codified at§ 1861(c)(2)(F)(iii)); § 103, 129 Stat. 272 (codified at§ 186l(b)(2)(A) & (c)(2)(A), (3)); § \n107, 129 Stat. 273-75 (codified at§ 1861(k)(4)); § 201, 129 Stat. 277 (codified at§§ 1841(4), 1842(c)(3)). \n3 \n\nto the FISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 at *1, 3 (FISA Ct. Rev. Jan. 9, 2018) (per curiam). On March \n16, 2018, the FISCR held that the Movants meet the requirements for standing under Article III. \n!d. at *4-7.  The FISCR did not decide whether the FISC had subject matter jurisdiction or reach \nthe merits ofMovants' claim.  !d. at *3-4. \nUpon remand, the undersigned judge entered an order scheduling briefing on whether the \nCourt has subject matter jurisdiction over the Movants' claim and appointing Professor Donohue \nto contribute to that briefing as amicus curiae.  Appointment of Amicus Curiae and Briefing \nOrder, No. Misc. 13-08 (May I, 20 18).  The Court is grateful to Professor Donohue for her able \nassistance. \nThe Court has fully considered the submissions of the parties and amicus.  For the \nreasons stated below, the Court finds that (1) it has subject matter jurisdiction over the Motion \nfor the Release of Court Records; and (2) the First Amendment does not confer a qualified right \nof public access to the material sought by the Movants, nor is there reason for the Court to \nexercise any discretion it may have to grant the relief requested.  The Motion for the Release of \nCourt Records accordingly will be denied and the motion will be dismissed. \nIT.  The Court Has Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over the Movants' Claim. \n\"Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  They possess only that power \nauthorized by Constitution and statute, which is not to be expanded by judicial decree.  It is to be \npresumed that a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction.\" Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins.  Co. \nofA  merica, 511 U.S. 375,377 (1994) (citations omitted).  The FISC is a federal court with \nspecialized jurisdiction concerning applications and certifications filed by the government and \nrelated to the collection offoreign intelligence. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1803(a)(l), 1822 (c), \n4 \n\n1842(b)(l) and (d)(l), 1861(b)(l)(A) and (c)(l), 1881a(i), 188lb(a), 1881c(a), and \n1881 d(a). \nAlthough Movants' First Amendment right of access claim falls outside the jurisdictional \nprovisions noted above, Movants assert that the FISC has subject matter jurisdiction over the \nclaim pursuant to the FISC's inherent authority over its own records and as ancillary to its \njurisdiction over the applications and proceedings which resulted in the opinions to which \nMovants seek access.  See Movants' Opening Brief in Response to the Court's Order of May 1, \n2018 at 4-12 (\"Movants' Br.\").  Amicus asserts that adjudication of the Movants' claim is \nwithin the \"essential inherent power\" conferred by Article III of the Constitution. See Brief \nof Amicus Curiae at 18-24 (\"Amicus Br.\"). The government argues that the FISC has no \njurisdiction to adjudicate Movants' claim because it falls outside its statutory grant of subject \nmatter jurisdiction and is not covered by the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction.  See United States' \nResponse Brief Regarding Subject Matter Jurisdiction at 7-11 (\"Gov't Resp. Br.\").  For the \nreasons discussed below, the Court finds that it has ancillary jurisdiction over Movants' claim. \nThe Supreme Court has recognized the authority of federal courts to exercise ancillary \njurisdiction over claims outside their statutory grant for two purposes: \"( 1) to permit disposition \nby a single court of claims that are, in varying respects and degrees, factually interdependent; \nand (2) to enable a court to function successfully, that is, to manage its proceedings, vindicate its \nauthority, and effectuate its decrees.\"  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 379-80 (reversing the district \ncourt's enforcement of a settlement agreement, which arose from a lawsuit previously before the \ncourt, as \"quite remote from what courts require in order to perform their function\") (citations \nomitted). \n5 \n\nIn Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991), the Supreme Court summarized the \nroots of the authority that came to be described in Kokkonen 's second prong: \nIt has long been understood that \"[c ] ertain implied powers must necessarily result \nto our Courts of justice from the nature of their institution,\" powers \"which cannot \nbe dispensed with in a Court, because they are necessary to the exercise of all \nothers.\" United States v.  Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34, 3 L. Ed. 259 (1812); see also \nRoadway  Express,  Inc.  v.  Piper,  447  U.S.  752,  764,  100  S.  Ct.  2455,  2463, \n65 L.Ed.2d 488  (1980) (citing Hudson).  For this reason, \"Courts of justice are \nuniversally  acknowledged  to  be  vested, by  their very  creation,  with power to \nimpose silence, respect, and decorum, in their presence, and submission to their \nlawful mandates.\" Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 227, 5 L. Ed. 242 (1821); see \nalso Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 510, 22 L. Ed. 205 (1874). These powers are \n\"governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to \nmanage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition \nof cases.\" Linkv. Wabash R.  Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630--631, 82 S. Ct. 1386, 1388-\n1389, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962). \nChambers, 501 U.S. at 43. \nAs an Article III court, see In re Certification of Questions ofL aw to FISCR, 2018 WL \n2709456 at *4, citing In reSealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 731, 732 n.l9  (FISA Ct. Rev. 2002) (per \ncuriam), the FISC possesses the same inherent authority recognized in Chambers and Kokkonen.3 \nWhether the FISC has ancillary jurisdiction to adjudicate the Movants' claim therefore depends \non whether the exercise of such jurisdiction is necessary to its successful functioning. \nThe supervisory power courts hold over their own records is well-established. See \nNixon v.  Warner Commc 'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589,598 (1978) (\"Every court has supervisory power \nover its own records and files\"); Gambale v. Deutsche BankAG, 377 F.3d 133, 141 (2d Cir. \n2004) (\"The court's supervisory power does not disappear because jurisdiction over the relevant \n3  This principle is reflected in certain provisions of the FISC's statutory mandate.  See 50 U.S.C. § \n1803(g)( 1) (\"The [FISC and FISC Court of Review] may establish such rules and procedures, and take such actions, \nas are reasonably necessary to administer their responsibilities under this [Act].\"); § 1803(h) (\"Nothing in this [Act] \nshall be construed to reduce or contravene the inherent authority of [the FISC] to determine or enforce compliance \nwith an order or rule of such court or with a procedure approved by such court.\"). \n6 \n\ncontroversy has been lost. The records and files are not in limbo.  So long as they remain under \nthe aegis of the court, they are superintended by the judges who have dominion over the court.\"). \nIn managing their proceedings and records, federal courts must observe constitutional \nrights.  See, e.g., Doe v.  Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 253 (4th Cir. 2014) (finding district court's \nsealing order violated the public's right of access under the First Amendment and remanding \nwith instructions to unseal the record); In re Providence Journal Co., 293 F .3d 1, 11-13 (1st Cir. \n2002) (exercising advisory mandamus to resolve novel issues of great public importance and \nfinding district court's practice of refusing to place legal memoranda on file in clerk's office \nviolated First Amendment); Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. F. TC., 710 F.2d 1165, 1177, \n1180-81 (6th Cir. 1983) (stating \"the First Amendment and the common law do limit judicial \ndiscretion\" and vacating district court's order sealing record of Federal Trade Commission \nproceeding for failing to state findings or conclusions justifying nondisclosure to public). \nThe manner in which the FISC manages its proceedings is also constrained by statute. \nFISA requires th~ FISC to adhere to specified security procedures: \nThe record of proceedings under this [Act], including applications made and orders \ngranted, shall  be maintained under security measures established by the  Chief \nJustice [of the United States] in consultation with the Attorney General and the \nDirector ofNational Intelligence. \n50 U.S.C. § 1803(c).  The security measures established by the Chief Justice in accord with \nSection 1803( c) provide: \nCourt Proceedings.  The court shall ensure that all court records (including notes, \ndraft  opinions,  and  related  materials)  that  contain  classified  national  security \ninformation are  maintained  according to  applicable  Executive Branch security \nstandards for storing and handling classified national security information. Records \nof the court shall not be removed from its premises except in accordance with the \nAct, applicable court rule, and these procedures. \nSecurity Procedures Established Pursuant to Public Law No. 95-511, 92. Stat. 1783, as \nAmended, By the Chief Justice of the United States for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n7 \n\nCourt and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ofReview, ~ 7 (2013) (\"FISC Security \nProcedures\"). \nTo meet this responsibility, the FISC adopted rules of procedure which regulate how it \nhandles and maintains national security information.  See, e.g., FISA Ct. R. Proc. 3 (\"In all \nmatters, the Court and its staff shall comply with the security measures established pursuant to \n50 U.S.C. §§ 1803(c), 1822(e), 1861(±)(4), and 188la(k)(l), as well as Executive Order 13526, \n'Classified National Security Information' (or its successor)\"); FISA Ct. R. Proc. 62(b) (\"Except \nwhen an order, opinion, or other decision is published or provided to a party upon issuance, the \nClerk may not release it, or other related record, without a Court order.  Such records must be \nreleased in conformance with the security measures referenced in Rule 3.\").  Ru1e 62(b) limits \npublic access to FISC opinions by prohibiting release by the Clerk of Court to anyone other \nthan the government at time of issuance unless specifically authorized by Court order.  These \nrestrictions endure unless release is ordered by the Court, regardless of the status of the \nunderlying matter. \nThe Supreme Court has recognized a First Amendment right of public access to some \njudicial proceedings.  See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Super. Ct., 478 U.S. 1 (1986) (\"Press-\nEnterprise IF'); Globe Newspaper Co. v. Super. Ct. for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596 (1982). \nWhen a claimant asserts that right of access with respect to the proceedings or documents of a \nfederal court established under Article III, it is necessary for that court to be able to adjudicate \nthe claim, lest its own actions violate the First Amendment.4  In this case, the FISC's \n4  Moreover, adjudicating such claims may involve factual issues which are best assessed by the court \nwhose proceedings or records are at issue.  See, e.g., Globe Newspaper, 457 U.S. at 606-08 (First Amendment \nchallenge to closure of a criminal trial during testimony of a minor victim of a sexual offense required trial court to \nassess factors such as victim's \"psychological maturity and understanding\" and \"the interests of parents and \nrelatives\"); United States v. Wecht, 537 F.3d 222, 239-42 (3d Cir. 2008) (First Amendment challenge to withholding \nnames of jurors from the public in a criminal trial required district court to evaluate whether risks to jurors were \n\"serious and specific\"); Oregonian Pub. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Court, 920 F.2d 1462, 1467 (9th Cir. 1990) (First \n8 \n\nstatutory obligation to maintain its records securely underscores the need for it to be able to \nadjudicate Movants' claim.  In seeking access to certain FISC opinions, Movants posit a First \nAmendment right that may conflict with the above-described security procedures, which are \nrequired by statute and effected through the FISC's rules.  The FISCR has found Movants' \nclaim to be judicially cognizable. In re Certification ofQ  uestions ofL aw to FISCR, 2018 WL \n2709456 at *7. IfMovants' claim has merit, the First Amendment may require modification to \nthe manner in which the FISC maintains its opinions. 5  It is necessary, therefore, for the FISC to \nadjudicate Movants' claim in order to ensure that its proceedings comport with a correct \nunderstanding of both the First Amendment and statutorily required security procedures. The \nFISC's ability to \"function successfully\" and \"manage its proceedings,\" Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at \n3 79-80, would be significantly compromised if it lacked authority to adjudicate First \nAmendment claims such as the one asserted by Movants. \nThe fact that Congress has conferred on the FISC subject matter jurisdiction over a \nnarrow range of matters, in comparison with the jurisdiction of federal district courts, does not \ndetract from the grounds for finding ancillary jurisdiction.  The \"doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction \n.. . recognizes federal courts' jurisdiction over some matters (otherwise beyond their \ncompetence) that are incidental to other matters properly before them.\"  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at \n3 78 (emphasis added).  Other specialized courts of law have recognized their authority to decide \nConstitution-based claims related to their own proceedings, despite not having original \nAmendment challenge to sealing of plea agreement required district court to evaluate \"evidentiary support\" for \ncontention that exposure of defendant's cooperation with law enforcement would threaten his and his family's \nsafety). \n5  It must be noted that this Court's authority to decide the instant matter does not depend on the merits. \nSee Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998) (\"It is firmly established in our cases that the \nabsence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction, i.e., the \ncourts' statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.\"). \n9 \n\njurisdiction over claims \"arising under the Constitution,\" as conferred upon federal district courts \nby 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  See In re Symington, 209 B.R. 678, 691-92 (1997) (\"This Court \nunquestionably has subject matter jurisdiction over [news companies' motion to intervene and \nstrike protective order keeping debtor records private] . . . . As long as a protective order \nremains in effect, the court that entered the order retains the power to modify it ...\" )(citations \nomitted).6  See also Dacoron v. Brown, 4 Vet. App 115, 119 (1993) (\"[N]othing in the above \nanalysis [recognizing district court jurisdiction over Constitutional claims] implies that this Court \ndoes not have power to review claims pertaining to the constitutionality of statutory and \nregulatory provisions. Such authority is inherent in the Court's status as a court of law, and is \nexpressly provided in 38 U.S.C. § 7261(a)(l) .. .\"  )(citations omitted). \nThe government suggests that the FISC lacks jurisdiction over Movants' claim \nbecause the opinions to which Movants seek access were not issued in proceedings currently \nbefore the FISC.  See Gov't Resp. Br. at 9-11 (contrasting Movants' claim seeking \n\"documents from other cases\" with claims relating to unlawful disclosure of information \"in \nongoing ... actions pending in district court\" and \"efforts to intervene in an extant case\"). \nWhile the government is correct insofar as the associated intelligence-gathering \nauthorizations granted by the FISC have expired, the FISC has a continuing obligation to \nmaintain the records of those proceedings in accord with Section 1803( c) and Rule 62(b ). \nMoreover, that obligation remains in place for those portions of the requested opinions that are \n6  Cf In reA/terra Hea/thcare Corp., 353 B.R. 66, 70 (2006) (finding newspaper's First Amendment, \nfederal common law, and statutory claims for access to several settlement agreements, which had been filed under \nseal pursuant to orders of the bankruptcy court, to be \"a core proceeding over which the Court has subject matter \njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1334(b) & 157(b)(2)(A)\"); In re Bennett Funding Group, Inc., 226 B.R. 331, \n332-33 (1998) (adjudicating newspaper's First Amendment and federal common law right of access to retainer \nagreement filed in camera pursuant to core jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1334(b) and I 57( a), (b)(l) and (2)(A))). \n10 \n\nstill classified and not available to the public, notwithstanding the release of other portions based \non Executive Branch declassification decisions. \nIn light of the above analysis and consistent with this Court's prior decisions/  the Court \nwill exercise ancillary jurisdiction pursuant to Kokkonen 's second prong and proceed to the \nmerits. \nill.  The First Amendment Does Not Provide a Qualified Right of Public Access to the \nOpinions at Issue. \nMovants and Amicus urge the Court to apply the \"experience-and-logic\" test articulated \nin Press-Enterprise 11 and find a First Amendment right of public access to FISC opinions.  Mot. \nfor Release of Ct. Records at 12; Reply Brief of Amicus Curiae (\"Amicus Reply Br. \") at 45-4 7. 8 \nUnder the First Amendment, ... the Supreme Court has applied what is referred to \nas the experience-and-logic test to determine whether there is a constitutional right \nof access  to  particular court records  or proceedings.  That  test  entails  asking \nwhether the record or proceeding in question has \"historically been open to the \npress and general public,\" and \"whether public access plays a significant positive \nrole in the functioning of the particular process in question.\" \n* \nIn re Certification of Questions ofL aw to FISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 at  3 (quoting Press-\nEnterprise II, 478 U.S. at 8).  If these questions are answered affirmatively, then the First \nAmendment confers a qualified right of public access, Press-Enterprise 11, 478 U.S. at 8, which \nentails a \"presumption of openness [which] may be overcome only by an overriding interest \n7  See In re Mot. for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 487 (FISA Ct. 2007) (\"In reMotion \nfor Release ofC  ourt Records 2007'') (recognizing authority over court records and concluding, \"it would be quite \nodd if the FISC did not have jurisdiction in the first instance to adjudicate a claim of right to the court's very own \nrecords and files\"); In reOrders of Court Interpreting Section 2 I 5 ofP atriot Act, 2013 WL 5460064 (Sept. 13, \n2013) (exercising subject matter jurisdiction over third party claim for access to FISC records); and In re Mot. for \nConsent to Disclosure of Court Records or, in the Alternative, Determination oft he Effect of Court's Rules on \nStatutory Access Rights, 2013 WL 5460051 at *2 (June 12, 20 13) (finding jurisdiction to adjudicate a dispute over \nwhether a FISC rule prohibited the government from disclosing its copies of a FISC opinion pursuant to the \nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552). \n8  Amicus also argues that the common law provides a public right of access, see Amicus Reply Br. at 34-\n45; however, Movants have asserted only a First Amendment claim. \n11 \n\nbased on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to \nserve that interest,\" Press-Enter. Co. v. Super. Ct., 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984) (\"Press-Enterprise \nf').  Although the Supreme Court has never applied the experience-and-logic test \"outside the \ncontext of criminal judicial proceedings or the transcripts of such proceedings,\" Ctr. for Nat 'I \nSec. Studies v. US. Dep 't ofJ ustice, 331 F.3d 918, 935 (D.C. Cir. 2003), the FISCR's opinion in \nIn re Certification ofQ  uestions ofL aw to FISCR indicates that it is applicable here. \nA.  The Proper Framing of the Experience-and-Logic Test \nHow broadly or narrowly to apply the experience-and-logic test has sometimes been a \nvexing question,9 but the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Press-Enterprise II provides \nguidance.  The Supreme Court observed that, \"[a]lthough many governmental processes operate \nbest under public scrutiny, it takes little imagination to recognize that there are some kinds of \ngovernment operations that would be totally frustrated if conducted openly.\"  Press-Enterprise \n11, 478 U.S. at 8-9.  This distinction makes it evident that the experience-and-logic inquiry \ndescribed in Press-Enterprise II should be directed with sufficient precision to appreciate the \nhistory and nature of the particular type of proceeding or document in question. See Times \nMirror Co. v.  United States, 873 F.2d 1210, 1213 (9th Cir. 1989) (\"the Supreme Court has \nimplicitly recognized that the public has no [First Amendment] right of access to a particular \nproceeding without first establishing that the benefits of opening the proceedings outweigh the \ncosts to the public\"). \n9 See, e.g., Dhiab v. Trump, 852 F.3d 1087, 1104 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Press-Enterprise II did not explain \n\"whether we look to broad or narrow categories\" and \"the likely categories\" in Dhiab \"may range among civil \nactions generally, habeas actions, habeas actions relating to conditions of confinement, and finally habeas actions \nrelated to Guantanamo\") (Williams, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). \n12 \n\nFISC judges have applied the experience-and-logic test with sufficient particularity to take \ninto account the distinctive characteristics of FISC proceedings.  See In re Motion for Release of \nCourt Records 2007, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 492 (FISA Ct. 2007) (applying \"experience and logic\" \ntest to electronic surveillance proceedings under 50 U.S.C. §§ 1804-1805); In re Proceedings \nRequired by§ 702(i), 2008 WL 9487946 at *3-4 (FISA Ct. Aug. 27, 2008) (applying test to \nrecords relating to FISC review of government's certification and procedures for acquisition of \nforeign intelligence information under Section 702 ofFISA, codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1881a).10 \nThe FISCR has also endorsed this approach. See In re Certification of Questions ofL aw to \nFISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 at * 1 (\"The work of the FISC is different from that of other courts in \nimportant ways that bear on the First Amendment analysis.\"). \nOne of the most distinctive characteristics of the FISC's review and disposition of FISA \napplications is that, under the framework established by Congress, such work is not open to the \npublic.  In addition to the requirement that the FISC comply with security measures adopted by \nthe Chief Justice (see supra pp. 7-8), orders directing third parties to produce tangible things in \nsupport of foreign intelligence investigations must be entered ex parte and not disclose the nature \nofthe investigation for which they are issued.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1861(c)(1), (2)(E).  Recipients of \nsuch orders are subject to nondisclosure requirements.  50 U.S. C. § 1861 ( d)(l ).  Petitions \n10  In this regard, these FISC decisions align with those of numerous other courts, which have applied the \nexperience-and-logic test to the particular type of judicial proceeding or document to which a First Amendment right \nof access has been asserted. See, e.g., Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 10 (applied to preliminary hearings ofthe \ntype conducted in California criminal proceedings); In re Morning Song Bird Food Litig., 831 F.3d 765, 777 (6th \nCir. 20 16) (applied to objections to presentence reports); In reApplication oft he United States for an Order \nPursuant to 18 U.S. C. §2703(d), 707 F.3d 283, 291-92 (4th Cir. 2013) (\"In re §2703(d) Application\") (applied to§ \n2703(d) orders and proceedings); In re Hearst Newspapers, LLC, 641 FJd 168, 177-80 (applied to sentencing \nproceedings); In reApplication oft he New York Times Co. to Unseal Wiretap & Search Warrant Materials) (\"In re \nApplication ofNew York Times\"), 577 F.3d 401,409-10 (2d Cir. 2009) (applied to Title Ill wiretap applications); \nWecht, 537 F.3d at 235-39 (applied to names of jurors and prospective jurors in criminal trials); United States v. \nCorbitt, 879 F.2d 224, 228-36 (7th Cir. 1989) (applied to presentence reports); Times Mirror Co., 873 F.2d at 1213-\n18 (applied to pre-indictment search warrant proceedings and materials). \n13 \n\nchallenging such orders \"shall be filed under seal\" and, when adjudicating such petitions, the \nFISC \"shall, upon request of the Government, review ex parte and in camera any government \nsubmission, or portions thereof, which may include classified information.\"  50 U.S.C. § \n1861(£)(5); see also 50 U.S.C. § 188la(l)(2) (equivalent provision for FISC proceedings on \npetitions to challenge or enforce directives under Section 702 ofFISA).  FISC proceedings on \napplications to approve installation and use of PRITT devices and other forms of intelligence \ncollection also must be closed to the public and any resulting orders that are served on third \nparties are protected from further disclosure.11  Finally, even the congressionally-mandated \nprocess for release of FISC opinions that involve \"a significant construction or interpretation\" of \nlaw, see 50 U.S.C. § 1872(a), does not presume openness. Rather, it involves an Executive \nBranch declassification review that results in public release of each such opinion \"to the greatest \nextent practicable,\" \"consistent with\" the results of that review, which may involve redaction of \nsensitive information or release of a summary in place of the opinion itself.  § 1872(a), (b), (c) \n(emphasis added).  See also In re Certification ofQ  uestions ofL aw to FISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 \nat* 1 (the \"legal analysis\" in FISC opinions \"often contain[s] highly sensitive information, the \nrelease of which could be damaging to national security\"). \nThe foregoing considerations instruct that the FISC should apply the experience-and-\nlogic test solely in the context of this Court's opinions relating to foreign intelligence collection. \nMovants prefer a broader perspective and argue that the Court should apply the experience-and-\n11  PRITT orders must be entered ex parte and provide that persons directed to assist in installing or \noperating a PRITT device shall do so \"in such a manner as will protect its secrecy\" and \"shall maintain, under \nsecurity procedures approved by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence, any records \nconcerning the pen register or trap and trace device or the aid furnished.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1842(d)(l), (2)(B). Similar \nprovisions apply to FISC orders approving electronic surveillance, see 50 U.S.C. § 1805(a), (c)(2)(B)-(C), physical \nsearch, see 50 U.S.C. § 1824(a), (c)(2)(B)-(C), and certain acquisitions targeting U.S. persons who are outside the \nUnited States, see 50 U.S.C. §§ 188lb(c)(l), (5)(B)-(C) and 1881c(c)(l). \n14 \n\nlogic test to judicial opinions generally, or at least to such opinions that interpret the \"meaning \nand constitutionality of public statutes.\"  Mot. for Release of Ct. Records at 13-17.12  But using \nsuch a broad platform to evaluate experience and logic would lose focus on the distinctive \ncharacteristics of FISC opinions and proceedings described above. \nMovants' reasoning behind their proposal is not persuasive.  First, Movants assert that the \nexperience inquiry '\"does not look to the particular practice of any one jurisdiction, but instead to \nthe experience in that type or kind of hearing throughout the United States.\"' !d. at 13 (quoting El \nVocero de P.R. v. Puerto Rico, 508 U.S. 147, 150 (1993) (per curiam) (emphasis in original); \naccord Amicus Reply Br. at 50.  But the FISC is not one forum among others similarly situated: \nit has singular and national jurisdiction over all FISA applications.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1803(a)(l), \n1822(c), 1842(b), 1861(b)(l), 1881a(j)(1)(A), 1881b(a)(l), 1881c(a)(l).  The FISC is the only \nforum that conducts the relevant types of proceedings and issues the relevant types of opinions. \nRelatedly, Amicus argues that '\"[t]radition is not meant .. . to be construed narrowly\"' \nand the Court should look \"'to analogous proceedings and documents of the same type or kind.\"' \nAmicus Reply Br. at 50-51 (quoting In re Boston Herald, Inc., 321 F.3d 174, 184 (1st Cir. \n2003)).  But in the decision relied upon, the First Circuit also observed that \"analogies\" to other \nprocedural contexts must be \"solid ones\" that \"serve as reasonable proxies for the 'favorable \njudgment of experience' concerning access to the actual documents in question.\"  In re Boston \nHerald, 321 F.3d at 184 (quoting Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 8).  Accordingly, the First \nCircuit dismissed as \"too broad\" a proposed analogy between access to criminal trials and access \nto documents submitted ex parte in support of a defendant's request for assistance with legal \n12  Amicus similarly argues that the inquiry should encompass how judicial opinions \"are treated based on \nthe common law right of access\" and the history of public access to documents in other courts - either other \nspecialized Article III courts, e.g., the U.S. Court for International Trade, or Article III courts generally. See Amicus \nReply Br. at 47-52. \n15 \n\nexpenses. 321 F.3d at 184.  Similarly, the Fourth Circuit in In re § 2703(d) Application rejected \nthe argument that a claimed right of public access to an order under Section 2703(d ) of Title 18 \nof the U.S. Code could be founded on the \"long history of access to judicial opinions and \norders,\" because that interpretation of the First Amendment was \"too broad, and directly \ncontrary\" to precedent \"that this right extends only to particular judicial records and \ndocuments.\"  707 F.3d at 291 n.8 (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted).  This \nCourt concludes that public access to opinions issued in civil and criminal proceedings in other \ncourts does not bear on the experience inquiry here due to the distinctive nature of the underlying \nFISC proceedings. \nMovants reason that the experience-and-logic test should be more generously analyzed \nwhen \"access to a new forum\" is at issue \"[b] ecause there will never be a tradition of public \naccess in new forums,\" Mot. for Release of Ct. Records at 14 (emphasis in original); however, \nthey do not explain why the FISC, which has continuously entertained applications for approval \nof foreign intelligence collection since 1979, should be regarded as so new that it cannot have \nestablished its own \"history\" regarding public access.13  In any case, due to the FISC's purported \nyouth, Movants urge reliance on a broader category of \"judicial opinions interpreting the \nmeaning and constitutionality of public statutes\" to gauge experience and logic.  See id., citing \nNew York Civil Liberties Union v. New York City Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286,299 (2d Cir. 2012) \n13 Cf In reApplication ofN  ew York Times, 577 F.3d at 410 (reviewing in 2009 how Title III wiretap \napplications have been handled since Title III's enactment in 1968 and concluding that such applications \"have not \nhistorically been open to the press and general public,\" notwithstanding claimant's contention that such applications \n\"are merely judicial records that, like search warrants or docket sheets, have been historically open to public \naccess\"); In reApplication of Leopold to Unseal Certain Electronic Surveillance Applications and Orders, 300 F. \nSupp. 3d 61, 87-88 (D.D.C. 2018) (describing as \"doubtful\" whether, over 31 years after enactment of§ 2703(d), \norders issued thereunder \"are of such recent vintage\" that the court should broaden the experience inquiry to \nencompass whether search warrant materials have historically been open to the public), reconsideration denied, 327 \nF. Supp. 3d I (D.D.C. 2018), appealfiled(D.C. Cir. Sept. 19, 2018). \n16 \n\n(\"NYCLU').14  But even if the FISC were \"new,\" its singular case load and statutory obligations \nrequire the experience-and-logic to be applied in a more focused and, necessarily, limited \nfashion. See In re Boston Herald, 321 F.3d at 184 (even if the type of proceeding at issue is of \n\"relatively recent vintage,\" other types of proceedings can be relevant only if they \"serve as \nreasonable proxies for the favorable judgment of experience concerning access to the actual \ndocuments in question\") (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe Second Circuit's decision in NYCLU does not indicate otherwise.  NYCLU involved \na claimed First Amendment right of public access to hearings before the Transit Adjudication \nBureau (TAB) concerning alleged violations of public transit rules of conduct.  The TAB was an \nadministrative body created to lessen the burden of adjudicating such violations in criminal \ncourt.  684 F.3d at 289-93.  In applying the experience-and-logic test, the Second Circuit \nconsidered the historical openness of such transit-rule adjudications in criminal court, as well as \nthe practices of the TAB.  !d. at 300. It did so in part because the TAB was new but more \nimportantly because the TAB and the criminal court were functionally equivalent, that is, \"[t]he \nprocess that goes on at TAB hearings is a determination ofw  hether a respondent has violated a \nTransit Authority Rule.  And that process was presumptively open . . . when such proceedings \nwere heard only\" in the criminal court.  !d. at 301-02 (emphasis in original). \n14 Movants also cite In re Copley Press, Inc., 518 F.3d 1022 (9th Cir. 2008).  Mot. for Release of Ct. \nRecords at 14. That decision did not involve an expansive application ofthe experience-and-logic test in view of a \n\"new forum.\"  Instead, it followed Ninth Circuit precedent that satisfaction of the logic prong can be sufficient to \nestablish a qualified right of public access, even if the experience prong is not satisfied.  518 F.3d at I 026-27 \n(relying on Phoenix Newspapers, Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Court, 156 F.3d 940, 948 (9th Cir. 1998) and Seattle Times Co. v. \nU.S. Dist. Court, 845 F.2d I 513, 15 I 6-I 7 (9th Cir. I 988)). Although the Tenth Circuit agreed, see United States v. \nGonzales, 150 F.3d 1246, 1258 (1Oth Cir. 1998), the weight of circuit authority requires satisfaction of both prongs, \nsee Sullo & Bobbitt, PLLC v. Milner, 765 F.3d 388, 393-94 (5th Cir. 20 14); In reApplication for §2703(d) Order, \n707 F.3d at 291; In reSearch ofF air Finance, 692 F.3d 424, 429-31 (6th Cir. 20 I 2); In reApplication ofN  ew York \nTimes, 577 F.3d at 409-1 0; North Jersey Media Group, Inc. v. Ashcroft, 308 F.3d 198, 213 (3d Cir. 2002); United \nStates v. £/-Sayegh, I 31 F.3d 158, I 61 (D.C. Cir. 1997). The Court need not address this dichotomy because it finds \nthat neither experience nor logic is satisfied in this case. See infra pp. 19-30. \n17 \n\nFinally, Movants warn that a narrow experience inquiry \"would permit Congress to \ncircumvent the constitutional right of access altogether-even as to, say, criminal trials - simply \nby providing that such trials henceforth be heard in a newly created forum.\"  Mot. for Release of \nCt. Records at 14.  Their concern is both hypothetical and probably unconstitutional.  In addition, \nit presupposes a prior right of public access which never existed.  Before Congress established \nthe FISC, there were no judicial proceedings on applications for approval of foreign intelligence \ncollection and Executive Branch documents and deliberations regarding foreign intelligence \ncollection were hardly open to the public. \nAccordingly, the Court will apply the experience-and-logic test to FISC opinions \nconcerning requests for approval of foreign intelligence collection; more specifically, opinions \nissued by the FISC in: (1) ex parte proceedings on government applications for approval of \nparticular forms of intelligence gathering, see, e.g., 50 U.S.C. §§ 1804-1805 (electronic \nsurveillance), or involving reviews of certifications and procedures respecting acquisition of \nforeign intelligence information pursuant to § 1881 a(j); (2) ex parte proceedings on government \nrequests to modify orders previously issued in such proceedings; and (3) adversarial proceedings \nbetween the government and a person directed to provide information or otherwise assist in \nforeign intelligence collection, see, e.g., § 1881 a(i)( 4) -(5) (proceedings on petitions to challenge \nor enforce directives issued under§ 1881a(i)(l)).  The following discussion refers to these types \nof proceedings as \"foreign intelligence proceedings.\" \nB.  Application ofthe Experience-and-Logic Test \nFor the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that the asserted right of public \naccess fails under both the experience inquiry and the logic inquiry. \n18 \n\n1.  Experience \nThe experience inquiry concerns \"whether the record or proceeding in question has \n'historically been open to the press and general public.\"' In reCertification of Questions ofL aw \nto FJSCR, 2018 WL 2709456 at *3 (quoting Press-Enterprise JJ, 478 U.S. at 8) (citation \nomitted). \nFor the first 30 years of the FISC's existence, there plainly was no history of openness \nrespecting FISC opinions.  Prior to 2007, just two FISC opinions had been publicly released.15 \nThe opinion in In reMotion for Release ofC  ourt Records 2007, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, which was \nthe third FISC opinion to be publicly released, concerned an adversarial proceeding initiated by a \nnon-governmental party claiming a First Amendment right of access to FISC records, much like \nthe current proceeding.  In that matter, the Court found no tradition of public access, even for \n\"cases presenting legal issues of broad significance,\" and described the FISC as \"not a court \nwhose place or process [had] historically been open to the public.\"  !d. at 493. \nIn contrast, Movants and Amicus point to the considerably larger number of FISC \nopinions and orders that have been made public since In reMotion for Release ofCourt Records \n2007.  See Movants' Br. at 17; Amicus Reply Br. at 49-50.  According to the catalog of publicly \navailable FISC and FISCR opinions compiled by Amicus, see Amicus Appendix at Tab A, In re \nCertification a/Questions ofL aw to FISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 (No. 18-01) (\"Amicus \nAppendix\"), 54 FISC opinions have been released since the issuance of that opinion, certainly a \nnotable increase. Nevertheless, the relatively recent public accessibility of a greater number of \n15  See In reMotion for Release ofCourt Records 2007, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 488 n.13 (referencing prior \nreleases of In re All Matters Submitted to FISC, 218 F. Supp. 2d 611 (FISA Ct. 2002), rev 'd sub nom. In reSealed \nCase, 31 0 F.3d 717 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2002), and In reApplication oft he United States for an Order Authorizing the \nPhysical Search of Nonresidential Premises and Personal Property (FISA Ct. June 11, 1981), reprinted in S. Rep. \n97-280 at 16-19 (1981)). \n19 \n\nFISC opinions falls far short of establishing that opinions issued by the FISC in foreign \nintelligence proceedings have '\"historically been open to the press and general public.\"' See In re \nCertification ofQ  uestions ofL aw to FISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 at *3 (quoting Press-Enterprise \nII, 478 U.S. at 8). \nFirst, six of the 54 opinions cited by Amicus are inapposite because they were issued in \nunclassified adversarial proceedings arising from third parties' claims for relief, not in foreign \nintelligence proceedings.16  The release of those six opinions is no more relevant to the \nexperience inquiry in this case than, for example, the public accessibility of federal district court \nopinions issued in civil litigation. \nThe large majority of the remaining 48 opinions was made available by the Executive \nBranch beginning in 2013, after then-President Barack Obama directed the Director of National \nIntelligence (DNI) to \"declassify and make public as much information as possible about certain \nsensitive programs while being mindful of the need to protect sensitive classified intelligence \nand national security.\"  See Press Release, Shawn Turner, Director of Public Affairs, Office of \nthe DNI, DNI Declassifies Intelligence Community Documents Regarding Collection under \nSection 702 oft he Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) (August 21, 2013), \nhttps :I /www. odni. gov/ index. php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2 0 13/item/915-dni-\ndeclassifies-intelligence-community-documents-regarding-collection-under-section-702-of-the-\nforeign-intelligence-surveillance-act-fisa.  During 2013 and 2014, the Executive Branch released \n16  Two of those opinions, In re Opinions & Orders ofC  ourt Addressing Bulk Collection ofD  ata under \nFISA, 2017 WL 5983865 (FISA Ct. Nov. 9, 2017), and In re Opinions & Orders of Court Addressing Bulk \nCollection of Data under FISA, 20 I 7 WL 427591 (FISA Ct. Jan. 25, 20 17), were issued in this very case. The other \nfour are: In re Proceedings Required by Section 702(i) of FISA Amendments Act of2008, 2008 WL 9487946 (FISA \nCt. Aug. 27, 2008); In reMotion for Consent to Disclosure ofCourt Records or, in the Alternative, a Determination \nofthe Effect ofthe Court's Rules on Statutory Access Rights, 2013 WL 5460051 (FISA Ct.

Apr. 25, 2008), in redacted form following declassification \nreview by the Executive Branch as part of its record in In re Directives [Redacted} Pursuant to Section 10 5B of \nFISA, 551 F.3d I 005 (FISA Ct.

See id., Entries 6, 8, and 10.  Since the compilation of the \nAmicus Appendix, Professor Donohue, in collaboration with the Georgetown University Edward \nBennett Williams Law Library, has made publicly available a collection of resources on foreign \nintelligence law, including publicly released FISC opinions.19  Those materials include an \nadditional nine FISC opinions from foreign intelligence proceedings that have been released by \nthe Executive Branch in redacted form, consistent with its classification determinations, since the \n° \nsubmission of the Amicus Appendix.2 Combined with those described in the Amicus Appendix \n(including two opinions released prior to 2007, see supra p. 19), that makes for 58 opinions FISC \nopinions issued in foreign intelligence proceedings that have been publicly released. \nThe circumstances of the vast majority of those releases are actually a testament to the \nFISC's history of closure with regard to such opinions.

See Amicus Appendix, Entries 6, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 26, 28, and 54.21 \nEach of those opinions was made public in a form consistent with an Executive Branch \ndeclassification review, unless the opinion did not contain any classified information in the first \ninstance. 22  The release of those few opinions in redacted form does not show a history of \nopenness, supporting a First Amendment right of access. 23 \nFinally, it weighs heavily against the asserted history of openness that of the 59 FISC \nopinions discussed above, only two were released between the Court's inception in 1979 and \nAugust 2013.  See supra pp. 19-21.  History is the past considered as a whole, not just the most \nrecent developments. Cf North Jersey Media Group, 308 F .3d at 211 (\"the tradition of open \ndeportation hearings is too recent and inconsistent to support a First Amendment right of \naccess\"). \nNotably, FISC opinions that contained classified information have been released only \nafter a review and redaction by the Executive Branch.  Movants seek access to redacted \nclassified information in opinions they have already received.  Since such classified information \nhas never been released by the FISC, in that regard there is no relevant experience. \n21  Two of the twelve opinions are responsive to Movants' claim. See Amicus Appendix, Entries 23 and 26, \nreferencing Memorandum Opinion, In reApplication of FBI for Order Requiring Prod. of Tangible Things, No. BR \n13-158 (FISA Ct. Oct. 11, 2013) and In reApplication ofF  BI for Order Requiring Prod. of Tangible Things, 2013 \nWL 5741573, respectively. \n22  On December 17, 2019, the FISC published an order which included a discussion of the government's \nduty of candor in proceedings under Title I of FISA.  See Order, In re Accuracy Concerns Regarding FBI Matters \nSubmitted to the FISC, No. Misc. 19-02 (FISA Ct. Dec. 17, 2019). That order did not require a declassification \nreview because it did not contain classified information in the first instance. \n23  Amicus also identified 113 FISC orders that have been released to the public. See Amicus Appendix at \nTab B. That number is unpersuasive in the context of the thousands of orders issued by the FISC during its history \nthat have not been publicly released. See, e.g., Report of Director of Administrative Office of U.S. Courts on \nActivities of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, \nhttps://www.uscourts.gov/statistics-reports/analysis-reports/directors-report-foreign-intelligence-surveillance-courts. \n23 \n\n2.  Logic \nThe logic inquiry concerns \"'whether public access plays a significant positive role in the \nfunctioning of the particular process in question.\"' In re Certification ofQ  uestions ofL aw to \nFISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 at *3 (quoting Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 8; citation omitted). \nIn making that determination, a court balances the benefits of public openness against any harms, \nsee, e.g., In reSearch ofF  air Finance, 692 F.3d at 431-42; In re Boston Herald, Inc., 321 F.3d at \n186-88; United States v. Gonzales, 150 F.3d at 1259-60, including, when applicable, harm to \nnational security, see North Jersey Media Group, 308 F.3d at 217. \nMovants contend that access to FISC opinions will be beneficial in two particular ways: \n(1) public knowledge of the law is necessary for democratic governance, especially with regard \nto Executive Branch conduct that implicates constitutional rights, see Mot. for Release of Ct. \nRecords at 16; and (2) access to FISC opinions specifically will promote public confidence in the \nFISC and the FISA process, enable \"more refined decisionmaking in future cases,\" contribute to \nthe decisionmaking of other courts, and \"improve democratic oversight,\" see id. at 17-20.  These \nare benefits that might plausibly accrue from public access to FISC opinions, just as they \ngenerally accrue from public access to other types of judicial opinions. But as with the \nexperience inquiry, the proper focus of the logic inquiry must be on \"'the functioning of the \nparticular process in question.\"' In re Certification of Questions ofL  aw to FISCR, 2018 WL \n2709456 at *3 (quoting Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 8; citation omitted); see supra pp. 12-18. \n\"'[T]he value of access must be measured in specifics,\"' In reSearch ofF  air Finance, 692 F.3d \nat 433 (quoting Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 589 (1980) (Brennan, J., \n24 \n\nconcurring in the judgment),24 and specific harms to the proceeding at issue outweigh generic \nassertions about the benefits of openness: \n[\"]Every judicial proceeding, indeed every governmental process, arguably benefits \nfrom public scrutiny to some degree, in that openness leads to a better-informed \ncitizenry  and  tends  to  deter government officials from  abusing  the  powers of \ngovernment.\"  Yet, \"because the integrity and independence\" of proceedings such \nas the grand jury, jury deliberations, and the internal communications of the court \n\"are threatened by public disclosures, claims of'improved self-governance' and 'the \npromotion of fairness' cannot be used as an incantation to open these proceedings \nto the public.\" \nUnited States v. Gonzales, 150 F.3d at 1260 (quoting Times Mirror Co., 873 F.2d at 1213; \ninternal citations omitted); accord In re Search ofF  air Finance, 692 F.3d at 432-33 (finding that \nthe general benefits of \"assur[ing] that established procedures are being followed,\" promoting \n\"the appearance of fairness,\" and providing \"a check on . .. magistrate judges\" were \n\"outweighed by the very particular harms\" to the \"criminal investigatory process\" that would \nresult from publication of search warrant documents). But see In reSearch Warrant for \nSecretarial Area, 855 F.2d 569, 572-74 (8th Cir. 1988) (First Amendment confers qualified right \nof public access to search warrant documents). \nIn In reMotion for Release ofCourt Records 2007, which involved an asserted First \nAmendment right of access to FISC electronic surveillance orders and related pleadings, the \nCourt found that \"the detrimental consequences of broad public access to FISC proceedings or \nrecords would greatly outweigh\" any benefits.  526 F. Supp. 2d at 494. Those detrimental \nconsequences included the identification of \"methods of surveillance,\" which \"would permit \nadversaries\" to \"conceal their activities;\" disclosures of \"confidential sources of information,\" \n24  The quoted passage from Justice Brennan's opinion continues: \"Analysis is not advanced by rhetorical \nstatements that all information bears upon public issues; what is crucial in individual cases is whether access to a \nparticular government process is important in terms of that very process.\"  Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. at 589 \n(Brennan, J., concurring in judgment). \n25 \n\nwhich \"would chill current and potential sources from providing information\" and \"might put \nsome in personal jeopardy;\" and disclosures of intelligence gathering that could harm national \nsecurity in other ways, \"such as damaging relations with foreign governments.\" !d. \nAs here, the ACLU in In re Motion for Release of Court Records 2007 sought access to \n\"only those portions of the requested materials that the Court finds are not properly classified.\" \n!d. at 495.  In that case, the Court found that the logic test would not be satisfied even if it were \napplied to \"only those parts of the requested materials that the Court, after independent review, .. \n. determined need not be withheld.\"  !d. 25  The Court noted that its review \"might err by releasing \ninformation that in fact should remain classified,\" and thereby damage the national security. 526 \nF. Supp. 2d at 495.  Moreover, \"the FISA process would be adversely affected if submitting \nsensitive information to the FISC could subject the Executive Branch's classification to a \nheightened form of judicial review\"26 because the \"greater risk of declassification and disclosure \nover Executive Branch objections would chill the government's interaction with the Court.\"  526 \nF. Supp. 2d at 496.  The Court anticipated three deleterious consequences of that chilling effect: \n( 1) it \"could damage national security interests if, for example, the government opted to forgo \nsurveillance or search of legitimate targets in order to retain control of sensitive information that \na FISA application would contain;\" (2) it might create \"an incentive for government officials to \n25  The Court also expressed doubt \"that the logic test should be so narrowly applied.\" !d. at 495 & n.29 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, it is doubtful that a decision to release discrete information within a \ndocument could shed any light on whether general public access to other documents of the same type would benefit \nthe particular process at issue. See Globe Newspaper Co., 868 F .2d at 509-10 (\"the fact that in certain cases access \nto the [requested] records may not be detrimental to the functioning\" of the process in question, \"and perhaps may \neven be beneficial to it, ... is not sufficient reason to create a presumption in favor of openness\") (emphasis \nomitted). \n26  The ACLU had argued that the FISC should review Executive Branch classification decisions in a \n\"probing manner\" that is less deferential than the review of record releases under FOIA.  526 F. Supp. 2d at 491 & \nn.l8. The ACLU and other Movants advocate for the same rigorous review by the FISC in this case. See Mot. for \nRelease of Ct. Records at 25 (\"Independent judicial review of any proposed redactions .. . is necessary because the \nstandards that justify classification do not always satisfy the strict constitutional standard and ... executive-branch \ndecisions cannot substitute for the judicial determination required by the First Amendment.\"). \n26 \n\navoid judicial review\" by conducting surveillance without FISC approval \"where the need for \nsuch approval is unclear;\" and (3) it could threaten \"the free flow of information to the FISC that \nis needed for an ex parte proceeding to result in sound decisionmaking and effective oversight.\" \n!d. \nThe same anticipated harms preclude finding that the logic test is satisfied in this case. \nFirst, the fact that Movants seek access only to FISC opinions and not applications or other \nrelated documents does not abate the harms or distinguish In reMotion for Release of Court \nRecords 2007.  Given the extent to which sensitive information about subjects such as ongoing \ncounterintelligence and counterterrorism investigations and means of technical collection \nappears in opinions issued by the FISC in foreign intelligence proceedings, the Court finds that \nthe above-described harms can be anticipated from public access to such opinions. \nMoreover, Movants have not demonstrated any error in the assessment of harms in In re \nMotion for Release ofCourt Records 2007. They have merely asserted without explanation that \n\"the Court erred in concluding that public access would 'result in a diminished flow of \ninformation, to the detriment of the process in question.\"' Mot. for Release of Ct. Records at 21 \n(quoting In reMotion for Release of Court Records 2007, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 496).  But courts \nhave found that public access to various types of proceedings and documents could impede the \nreceipt of relevant information, including search warrant documents, 27 presentence reports and \nobjections thereto,28 and transcripts and materials respecting criminal defendants' requests for \n27  See, e.g., In reSearch ofF air Finance, 692 F.3d at 432 (\"[P]ublic access to search warrant documents\" \nwould cause the government \"to be more selective in the information it disclosed in order to preserve the integrity of \nits investigations. This limitation on the flow of information to the magistrate judges could impede their ability to \naccurately determine probable cause.\"). \n28  See, e.g., in re Morning Song Bird Food Litig., 831 F.3d at 776 (disclosure \"would tend to restrict the \nsentencing court's access to relevant knowledge by discouraging the transmission of information by defendants and \ncooperating third parties\"). \n27 \n\nassistance with legal expenses.29  In addition, it is not unreasonable to be concerned that a FISC \njudge \"might err by releasing information that in fact should remain classified,\" thereby \ndamaging national security.  526 F. Supp. 2d at 495.  The FISCR has similarly recognized that \nthe FISC \"is not well equipped to make the sometimes difficult determinations as to whether \nportions of its orders may be released without posing a risk to national security or compromising \nongoing investigations.\"  In reCertification ofQuestions ofL aw to FISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 at \n* 1.  The logic inquiry requires a balancing of the benefits of openness against any concomitant \nharms, see supra p. 24, and the risk of harming national security through disclosure of sensitive \ninformation must be weighed in striking that balance. \nFinally, Movants assert that Congress' decision in 2015 to establish an Executive Branch \nprocess to declassify and release significant FISC opinions, see USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 § \n402(a)(2) (codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1872(a)), reinforces their arguments regarding the logic \ninquiry.  Movants' Br. at 18. The Court disagrees.  The key figure in the statutory process is the \nDNI who, unlike FISC judges, is particularly well situated to decide what information must be \nwithheld to protect national security and what information is safe to release.30  The DNI, in \nconsultation with the Attorney General, must \"conduct a declassification review\" of FISC \nopinions that include \"a significant construction or interpretation of any provision of law.\"  50 \nU.S.C. § 1872(a).  Congress did not prescribe standards to apply in such review.  Instead, it left \nExecutive Branch classification standards in place and required that the opinions be made public \n29  In re Boston Herald, 321 F .3d at 188 (\"specter of disclosure ... might lead defendants (or other sources \ncalled upon by the court) to withhold information\"); In re Gonzales, 150 F.3d at 1259 (without \"assurance that the \ninformation revealed .. . will not be disclosed, a defendant and his or her counsel would be discouraged\" from full \ndisclosure of information to the court). \n° \n3 Cf Central Intelligence Agency v. Sims, 4 71 U.S. 159, 180 (1985) (\"[I]t is the responsibility of the \nDirector of Central intelligence, not that of the judiciary, to weigh the variety of complex and subtle factors in \ndetermining whether disclosure of information may lead to an unacceptable risk of compromising the Agency's \nintelligence-gathering process.\"). \n28 \n\n\"to the greatest extent practicable,\" \"consistent with\" the review's results. !d. (emphasis added). \nImportant to the issues presented here, the statute specifically permits the DNI, in consultation \nwith the Attorney General, to waive the publication requirement if doing so \"is necessary to \nprotect the national security of the United States or properly classified intelligence sources or \nmethods,\" provided that an unclassified summary of the FISC's legal interpretation is prepared \nand published.  50 U.S.C. § 1872(c). \nMovants advocate for a wholly different process in which the Court would independently \napply criteria for withholding information that are more limited than those in the Executive \nBranch classification standards.  See Mot. for Release of Ct. Records at 25.  The Court's \ndeclination of that function is entirely congruent with 50 U.S.C. § 1872.  To be sure, Section \n1872 reflects a legislative judgment that public access to significant FISC opinions is desirable, \nbut only when the DNI is satisfied that sensitive national security information is sufficiently \nprotected.  In fact, the provisions of Section 1872 contradict Movants' argument that the benefits \nof open access to such opinions outweigh the harms as a general matter. See Globe Newspaper \nCo., 868 F.2d at 509 (\"The First Amendment right of access attaches only to those governmental \nprocesses that as a general matter benefit from openness.\") (emphasis in original). \nThis Court concludes that \"public access\" to FISC opinions in foreign intelligence \nproceedings does not and would not play a \"significant positive role in the functioning\" of the \nFISC, In reCertification a/Questions ofL aw to FISCR, 2018 WL 2709456 at *3, particularly \nwith regard to classified information that the Executive Branch would protect.  Logic dictates \notherwise. \n29 \n\nIV.  The Court Will Not Order Further Review as a Matter of Discretion. \nFISC Rule 62(a) states: \nThe Judge who authored an order, opinion, or other decision may sua sponte or on \nmotion by a party request that it be published. Upon such request, the Presiding \nJudge, after consulting with other Judges of the Court, may direct that an order, \nopinion or other decision  be  published.  Before  publication, the Court may,  as \nappropriate, direct the Executive Branch to  review the order, opinion, or other \ndecision and redact it as necessary to ensure that properly classified information is \nappropriately protected pursuant to Executive Order 13526 (or its successor). \nFISA Ct. R. Proc. 62(a) (emphasis in original).  Movants assert that, \"even if the Court holds that \nthe First Amendment right of access does not attach ... , it should nonetheless exercise its \ndiscretion - as it has in the past and in the public interest - to order the government to conduct a \ndeclassification review of its opinions pursuant to Rule 62.\"  Mot. for Release of Ct. Records at \n27.  In support of that assertion, Movants cite an earlier instance in which the Court, as \"an \nexercise of discretion,\" directed the government to submit proposed redactions of any opinion at \nissue so that its author, \"with the benefit of [such proposal], may decide whether to propose \npublication pursuant to Rule 62(a).\"  !d. (quoting In re Orders of Court Interpreting Section 215 \nofP  atriot Act, 2013 WL 54600644 at *8). \nThe cited case, however, presented materially different circumstances.  Here, the \nExecutive Branch has completed a declassification review of the opinions at issue. Consistent \nwith that review, the opinions have been made available to the public in redacted form31  and \nthere is no particular reason to expect that further review will yield different results.  Under the \ncircumstances presented, the Court declines to direct a second declassification review. \n31  Indeed, the FISC has previously engaged in the Rule 62(a) publication process for two of the four \nopinions at issue. See supra p. 2. \n30 \n\nV.  Conclusion. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will dismiss the pending Motion for the Release of \nCourt Records.  A separate order accompanies this Opinion. \nFebruary 11, 2020 \nJudge, United States Forei  n \nIntelligence Surveillance Court \n31 ",

A majority of Judges \nvoted in favor of en bane reconsideration on the ground that it is necessary to secure or maintain \nuniformity of the court's decisions.  See 50 U.S.C. § l 803(a)(2)(A).  Accordingly, it is \nORDERED that Movants and the United States each may submit one legal brief \naddressing the question of whether Movants established Article III standing notwithstanding that \na First Amendment qualified right of access does not apply to the judicial opinions they seek. 1 \nThe January 25, 2017 Opinion addressed ( 1) whether Movants established constitutional \nstanding and (2) whether the First Amendment provided a qualified right of access to the judicial \nopinions Movants sought.  The conclusion that a First Amendment qualified right of access did \nnot apply was consistent with prior FISC precedent and therefore does not pose a concern about \nuniformity that merits en bane reconsideration.  As indicated in the January 25, 2017 Opinion, \nthe First Amendment qualified right of access was the only ground on which Movants asserted \nstanding.

The Court's broad conclusion that it lacks jurisdiction over all ofMovants' claims \ncontradicts previous rulings of this Court, and, significantly, was reached sua sponte, without. \nproviding any opportunity for Movants, during the 33-month pendency of this litigation, to \naddress this novel ground for dismissal that no party had raised. \nFor these reasons-and because the issues raised by the Court's Opinion overlap with \nthose presently pending in another motion before the Court-Movants respectfully request that \nthe Court reconsider its judgment in this matter, join this case with the other pending matter, and \npermit Movants to address the standing questions raised by the Court as part of the currently \nscheduled briefing in the other case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e); In re Opinions and Orders oft his \nCourt Containing Novel or Significant Interpretations ofL aw, No. Misc. 16-01 (F.I.S.C. filed \nOct. 21, 2016). Consideration of the two matters together will significantly promote judicial \nefficiency because it will allow both cases to be fully briefed and addressed in this Court before \nany petition for review in the Court of Review must be filed. If, however, the Court is unwilling \nto reconsider its conclusion in this case, Movants request that the Court withdraw its judgment \nuntil the motion in No. Misc. 16-01 is also resolved, so that any petition for review in these the \ntwo matters may be heard at the same time. 1 \n1 Movants have twice contacted the government to ask whether the government consents to \nthis Motion, but have not received a response. \n2 \n\nARGUMENT \nIn the interests both of fairness and judicial efficiency, the Court should reopen its \njudgment in this matter pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) and order joint briefing in this case and \nin No. Misc. 16-01.2 \nFirst, during the entirety of this litigation, Movants never had reason to address the \nCourt's ultimate grounds for dismissal-that the Court lackedjurisdiction to consider Movants' \naccess motion because no First Amendment right of access applies. Until this Court issued its \nOpinion, it appeared to be settled that this Court had jurisdiction to consider such motions; \nindeed, neither the government nor any member of this Court had ever suggested the contrary. In \nfact, at least three other members of this Court, when faced with similar right-of-access motions, \nplainly believed that they had jurisdiction to consider Movants' claims for public access. See In \nre Orders ofth~s Court Interpreting Section 215 oft he PATRIOT Act, No. Misc. 13-02, 2013 WL \n5460064 (F.1.S.C. Sept. 13, 2013) (\"215 Public Access\") (Saylor, J.); Jn re Motion for Release of \nCourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484 (F.l.S.C. 2007) (Bates, J.); In re Proceedings Required by \n702(i) ofF ISA Amendments Act of2008, No. Misc. 08-01, 2008 WL 9487946, at *2-3 (F.1.S.C. \nAug. 27, 2008) (McLaughlin, J.). The most recent of those decisions, 215 Public Access, \nexplicitly analyzed standing-and held that Movants had established jurisdiction to litigate their \nclaims under the First Amendment and FISC Rule of Procedure 62. 3 Nothing in any of those \nearlier cases, or in this one, gave Movants cause to address the novel legal theory adopted by the \n2 Because this Court's Rules do not address motions to alter or amend judgment, the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure may apply. See FISC Rule 1. In accordance with Rule 59( e) , this \nmotion is filed within 28 days of the order in question. \n3 The Court explained its conclusion that this case is distinguishable from 215 Public Access \nbecause, here, Movants sought only redacted information contained in ')udicial documents that \nalready have been made public.\" Op. at 10. It is unclear from the Court's opinion, however, how \nthat distinction affected the jurisdictional analysis. \n3 \n\nCourt. Of course, as the Court pointed out in its Opinion, Movants did address certain other \nstanding matters in their motion here-but they did so in order to satisfy the same standing \nthreshold the FISC found Movants had satisfied when it granted relief in 215 Public Access. See \nOp. at 8; Mot. at 10. Similarly, while the government addressed standing in its response brief, its \nargument focused entirely on the question of whether Movants were \"parties\" under Rule 62 and \nthe availability of comparable relief under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"). See \nResponse at 2-4. In short, Movants had no reason to rebut a previously unexpressed theory of \nstanding, and at no time in the 33 months during the pendency of this motion did the Court invite \nMovants to address it. \nThere is good reason to afford Movants the opportunity to address the legal questions \nraised for the first time in the Court's Opinion. The decision dismissing this matter for lack of \njurisdiction is incorrect because it improperly conflates the merits of Movants' claims with their \nstanding to bring them in the first place, and it runs contrary to previous decisions of this Court \n4 \nas well as a large body of federal judicial precedent.  As the prior cases of this Court made clear, \nstanding to seek public access to court records is not the same as having a right to obtain those \nrecords. See 215 Public Access, 2013 WL 5460064, at *1, 17; In re Motion/or Release ofC  ourt \nRecords, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 487, 491 (F.l.S.C. 2007). More broadly, the Court's standing \nruling conflicts with a wealth of precedent concerning the public's standing to seekjudicial \nrecords under the First Amendment. Movants' injury here-a denial of access to court records-\nis concrete and particularized. See Globe Newspaper Co. v. Super. Ct., 457 U.S. 596 (1982); \nRichmond Newspapers Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 576 (1980); N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. \n4 Should the Court grant the Motion, Movants will elaborate on these points in more detail, \nresponding to both the Court's Opinion and any arguments concerning standing taken up by the \ngovernment in No. Misc. 16-01, in a future joint filing. \n4 \n\nN.Y.C. Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 294-95 (2d Cir. 2011); In re Wash. Post, 807 F.2d 383, 388 \nn.4 (4th Cir. 1986). And plainly, Movants are injured by the denial of public access to the \nopinions and orders sought, see Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of \nChurch & State, 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982), and that injury would be redressed by the disclosure \nrequested, see Town ofB  arnstable v. FAA, 659 F. 3d 28, 31 (D.C. Cir. 2011).5 For precisely these \nreasons, courts considering motions for public access have clearly separated standing to seek \njudicial records from the merits. See, e.g., Carlson v. United States, 837 F.3d 753, 759 (7th Cir. \n2016) (\"That his petition is not guaranteed to be granted, because a court may find a valid \njustification for denying him access, in no way destroys his standing to seek the documents .... \nTo hold otherwise would amount to denying standing to everyone who cannot prevail on the \nmerits, an outcome that fundamentally misunderstands what standing is.\"); Doe v. Public Citizen, \n749 F.3_d 246, 253, 264 (4th Cir. 2014). \nSecond, Movants should be afforded the opportunity to address one other striking aspect \nof the Court's decision: its conclusion that in the absence of a viable First Amendment claim, \nMovants also lack standing to seek relief under Rule 62 and the Court's inherent supervisory \npowers_ over its own records. As the Opinion acknowledged, two other decisions of this Court \nrecognized that Movants had standing to assert such claims regardless of any First Amendment \nclaim. See Op. at 10 (discussing 215 Public Access, 2013 WL 5460064, at *8); id. at 9 n.5 \n(discussing In re Motion for Release ofC  ourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 486-87 (citing Nixon \nv. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978))). Yet with little analysis, the Court found \n5 Likewise, in the FOIA context, the Supre~e Court has held that plaintiffs have standing to \nlitigate FOIA claims so long as they are able to show (a) \"that they sought and were denied \nspecific agency records,\" and (b) that prevailing would provide access to records, regardless of \nwhether plaintiffs are ultimately entitled to the records sought. Pub. Citizen v. U.S. Dep 't of \nJustice, 491 U.S. 440, 450-51 (1989). \n5 \n\nthat because Movants had not established a First Amendment right of access, it lacked \njurisdiction to consider other grounds for relief. See Op. at 40 n.17. Briefly, the Court's apparent \nbelief that Movants must first establish an entitlement to relief under the First Amendment in \norder to seek the discretionary relief contemplated by Rule 62 proves far too much. Such a rule \nwould render the relief afforded by Rule 62 all but illusory, because· either the First Amendment \nwould require public access-in which case discretionary relief would be unnecessary-or the \nFirst Amendment would not require access and thus, according to the Court, parties would lack \nstanding to seek discretionary relief. Such an approach is also in tension with the canon of \nconstitutional avoidance, because it would require the FISC to resolve constitutional questions \n(as it did here) before considering the non-constitutional ground for relief presented by Movants. \nSee, e.g., United States v. Nat'/ Treasury Emps. Union, 513 U.S. 454, 478 (1995) (describing the \nSupreme Court's \"policy of avoiding unnecessary adjudication of constitutional issues\"); \nAshwander v. Tenn. Valley Auth., 297 U.S.288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\"The \nCourt will not anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding \nit.\" (quotation marks omitted)). \nFinally, reopening the judgment and permitting joint briefing in this case and in Misc. \nNo. 16-01 would promote judicial economy. On January 27, 2017-two days after this Court \npublished its Opinion in this case-the Court granted Movants' motion for a briefing schedule in \nIn re Opinions and Orders oft his Court Containing Novel or Significant Interpretations ofL aw, \nNo. Misc. 16-01 (F.l.S.C. filed Oct. 21, 2016), an action also brought by Movant American Civil \nLiberties Union. Given the Court's ruling in this case and the similarity of the claims of access \nunderlying both motions, the Court's ruling here will necessarily influence the briefing and \ndecision in the other case. Because the two cases involve similar issues, Movants respectfully \n6 \n\nrequest that the Court permit Movants, in a single brief to this Court, to argue for reconsideration \nof this Court's January 21, 2017 Opinion in No. Misc. 13-08 and to reply to the government's \nforthcoming response in No. Misc. 16-01. Should the Court grant this relief, both cases would be \naligned for an ultimate decision simultaneously-allowing Movants, the government, and the \nCourt to address all of the relevant arguments together, and alleviating any burden on the Court \nof Review, which would consider any appeal in a single proceeding, rather than through \npiecemeal litigation. \nIn the alternative, even if the Court is unwilling to reconsider its conclusion here, \nMovants request that the Court withdraw its judgment until the motion in No. Misc. 16-01 is \nresolved, so that any petition for review in these the two matters may be heard together. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Movants respectfully request that this Court pennit Movants, \nin a single brief to this Court, to argue for reconsideration of this Court's January 21, 2017 \nOpinion in No. Misc. 13-08 and to reply to the government's forthcoming response in No. Misc. \n16-01. In the alternative, Movants request that the Court withdraw its judgment until the motion \nin No. Misc. 16-01 is resolved, so that any petition for review in these the two matters may be \nheard together. \n7 \n\nDated: February 17, 2016  Respectfully submitted, \nIsl Patrick Toomey \nDavid A.

Clapper, Dir. of Nat'l Intelligence, Cover Letter Announcing Document \nRelease (Aug. 21, 2013), http://I.usa.gov/lbU8Cgt.. ............................................................... 1 \nv \n\nIntroduction \nThis en bane proceeding concerns the narrow question of whether parties who requested \nbut were denied access to judicial records of this Article III court have suffered an injury in fact \nand established standing for the purpose of Article III. They have. As the Supreme Court has \nexplained many times, the test of standing and that of the merits are different. To invoke a \ncourt's jurisdiction, a party need not show that it will prevail on the merits of its case, only that it \nseeks relief from a concrete injury. Virtually every court to confront a claim of access to judicial \nrecords has either held or assumed that the denial of access to judicial records is an injury in fact. \nThis is true for the Supreme Court, and it is true even of cases in which the Supreme Court, \nhaving assumed or expressly found standing, went on to reject the claimed right of access on the \nmerits. It is also true of this Court, which on three previous occasions properly exercised \njurisdiction over right-of-access claims. In short, overwhelming authority makes clear that \nMovants have standing here, based on the fact that they requested but were denied access to \njudicial records. \nFactual and Procedural Background \nOn November 6, 2013, Movants filed a motion seeking the release of this Court's \nopinions addressing \"the bulk collection of Americans' information.\" Mot. for Release of Court \nRecords at 3. The motion followed disclosures, by government officials and in the press, that \nintelligence agencies had used the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\") to justify the \nbulk collection of Americans' internet metadata and location information, in addition to the bulk \ncollection of their call records. See, e.g., James R. Clapper, Dir. ofNat'l Intelligence, Cover \nLetter Announcing Document Release at 3 (Aug. 21, 2013), http://l.usa.gov/lbU8Cgt; Charlie \nSavage, In Test Project, NS.A. Tracked Cellphone Locations, N.Y. Times, Oct. 2, 2013, \nhttp://nyti.ms/180Alz2. The government's reliance on FISA for these purposes came as a \n\nsurprise to the public. Nothing on the face of the statute purported to grant such broad authority, \nand nothing in the legislative history of FISA or the amendments embodied in the PA TRI OT \nAct, Pub. L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272 (2001 ), suggested that Congress intended to authorize the \nbulk collection of Americans' information. Movants filed the motion now before the Court in \norder to inform the public about the scope and meaning of these laws, as interpreted by the FISC \nin response to government applications for far-reaching surveillance authority. \nIn response to Movants' motion, the government identified four opinions addressing bulk \ncollection. Two of the opinions address the bulk collection of Americans' call records under \nSection 215 of the PATRIOT Act. 50 U.S.C. § 1861 (2010). They were released with redactions, \nfollowing a government declassification review, after two members of the Court requested \npublication under FISC Rule 62. 1 The other two opinions address the bulk collection of \nAmericans' internet metadata under FISA's pen-register provision. 50 U.S.C. § 1842 (2010). \nThey were released by the government with redactions, following a declassification review, after \nMovants filed their public access motion. 2 \nThe redactions in the opinions are substantial, making it difficult for a reader to \nunderstand the Court's legal analysis. In two of the opinions, dozens of pages are almost entirely \nredacted. See Kollar-Kotelly Opinion at 8-9, 31-38, 73-79; Bates Opinion at 36-52, 57-70. In \naddition, certain key facts, definitions, and concepts have been redacted, including: \n1 Amended Memorandum Opinion, In re Application oft he FE/for an Order Requiring the \nProduction of Tangible Things.from [Redacted], No. BR 13-109 (FISC Aug. 29, 2013), \nhttp://bit.ly/lmi50JX (\"Eagan Opinion\"); Memorandum, In re Application oft he FE/for an \nOrder Requiring the Production of Tangible Things.from [Redacted], No. BR 13-158 (FISC Oct. \n11, 2013), http://bit.ly/lua6Ulc (\"McLaughlin Opinion\"). \n2 Opinion and Order, [Redacted], No. PRITT [Redacted] (FISC released Nov. 18, 2013), \nhttp://l.usa.gov/19Ct5rl (\"Kollar-Kotelly Opinion\"); Memorandum Opinion, [Redacted], No. \nPRITT [Redacted] (FISC released Nov. 18, 2013), http://l.usa.gov/19Ct7Q5 (\"Bates Opinion\"). \n2 \n\n•  The definition and description of the \"metadata\" for which bulk collection was \nauthorized; 3 \n•  The duration of the bulk collection authorized;4 \n•  The manner in which Americans' bulk internet metadata was used, in addition to \n\"contact chaining\"; and 5 \n•  The nature and duration of the government's non-compliance with the FISC's \norders. 6 \nOf these, perhaps the most troubling is the first, because by redacting the definition and \ndescriptions of metadata, the government has made it impossible for the public to understand \nwhat surveillance the government actually proposed to conduct. See, e.g., Kollar-Kotelly \nOpinion at 7-11; Bates Opinion at 2. Thus, for example, the opinions recite the Fourth \nAmendment's third-party doctrine but omit the information necessary to understand how the \nCourt applied this doctrine to increasingly pervasive technologies and unprecedented \nsurveillance activities. See Ellen Nakashima & Greg Miller, Official Releases What Appears To \nBe Original Court File Authorizing NSA To Conduct Sweeps, Wash. Post, Nov. 18, 2013, \nhttp://www.wapo.st/IGqxNK (because \"[t]hree pages [of the Kollar-Kotelly Opinion] describing \nthe categories of 'metadata' ... were redacted,\" its \"true scope\" remains \"unclear\"); see also \nBates Opinion at 57-71 (describing the Court's legal analysis distinguishing internet metadata \nfrom content as \"difficult line-drawing,\" following fifteen pages ofredacted text). \n3 See Kollar-Kotelly Opinion at 7-11, 19 (\"[Redacted] like other forms of metadata, is not \nprotected by the Fourth Amendment ....\" ); Bates Opinion at 2, 35, 71 (\"The government \nrequests authority to [redacted] categories of [sixteen pages ofredacted material].\"). \n4 See, e.g., Bates Opinion at 4. \n5 See, e.g., Kollar-Kotelly Opinion at 42-43 (\"NSA proposes to employ two analytic methods \non the body of archived meta data it seeks to collect. ... The two methods are: (1) Contact \nchaining ... [(2)] [Redacted].\"). \n6 See, e.g., Bates Opinion at 2-3 (\"[T]he government acknowledges that NSA exceeded the \nscope of authorized acquisition continuously during the more than [redacted] years of acquisition \nunder these orders.\"); id. at 105 (\"[T]he unauthorized collection included: [redacted].\"). \n3 \n\nCritically, there is no indication in the public record that the Court had any role in \nreviewing which portions of its opinions should be made available to the public. The government \nappears to have determined for itself what should be redacted, and what should not. This is \nsignificant because in response to another access motion, the Court required the government to \nexplain and justify its proposed withholdings. That review proved essential in ensuring that the \ngovernment's redactions were not overbroad. 7 \nOn January 25, 2017, the Court issued an Opinion dismissing this proceeding for lack of \njurisdiction, holding that \"the First Amendment does not afford a qualified right of access\" to the \nlegal opinions sought by Movants and that \"Movants lack standing under Article III.\" Op. at 2. \nThe Court's sua sponte determination that it lacked jurisdiction over Movants' requests for \naccess conflicted with the Court's previous rulings. See In re Orders of this Court Interpreting \nSection 215 oft he PATRIOT Act (\"Jn re Section 215 Orders\"), No. Misc. 13-02, 2013 WL \n5460064 (FISC Sept. 13, 2013) (Saylor, J.); In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. \nSupp. 2d 484 (FISC 2007) (Bates, J.); In re Proceedings Required by 702(i) of FISA \nAmendments Act of2008, No. Misc. 08-01, 2008 WL 9487946, at *2-3 (FISC Aug. 27, 2008) \n(McLaughlin, J.). After Movants sought to alter or amend the judgment and to join briefing on \n7 In In re Section 215 Orders, the government originally insisted that the FISC opinion at \nissue \"should be withheld in full\" and a public version could not be provided, but it abandoned \nthat claim when required to submit a \"detailed explanation\" justifying it. Order at 1-2, No. 13-02 \n(FISC Nov. 20, 2013), http://bit.ly/258tRH8. The government conceded that the opinion could be \nreleased in redacted form. Even then, however, the government's proposed redactions were \noverbroad. Only after a further meeting with Court staff did the government determine that \n\"certain additional information in the Opinion [w  a]s not classified\" and could be released. Gov't \nSecond Submission at 3, In re Section 215 Orders, No. 13-02 (FISC Feb. 6, 2014), \nhttp://bit.ly/l fAc4Tx. \n4 \n\nthe standing question with a similar motion in Docket No. Misc. 16-01, the Court initiated this en \nbane proceeding. 8 \nArgument \nI.  Movants have standing to seek access to this Court's opinions. \nAs a federal court established by Congress under Article III, this Court possesses inherent \npowers, including \"supervisory power over its own records and files.\" Nixon v.  Warner \nCommc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978); accord Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43 \n(1991) (\"It has long been understood that [c  ]ertain implied powers must necessarily result to our \nCourts of justice from the nature of their institution.\"). As this Court has previously determined, \nthe FISC therefore has \"jurisdiction in the first instance to adjudicate a claim of right to the \ncourt's very own records and files.\" In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d \nat 487. \nTo invoke the Court's jurisdiction and advance such a right-of-access claim, the movant \nmust establish standing under Article III. It must show: \"(1) that it has suffered an 'injury in \nfact'; (2) that the injury is caused by or fairly traceable to the challenged actions of the \ndefendant; and (3) that it is likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\" Ethyl \nCorp. v. EPA, 306 F.3d 1144, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)). \n8 In 2015, while this proceeding was pending, Congress enacted the USA FREEDOM Act, \nPub. L. No. 114-23, 129 Stat. 268 (2015), which directs the government to publicly release \nsignificant opinions of this Court to the greatest extent practicable. See 50 U.S.C. § 1872. \nHowever, the government has taken the position that its statutory disclosure obligation does not \napply to opinions that predate the Act's passage on June 2, 2015. As a result, a number of \nsignificant opinions and orders of this Court issued prior to June 2015 remain secret in their \nentirety. Those opinions are the subject of a separate access motion pending before the Court. \nSee Mot. for Release of Court Records, In re Opinions and Orders oft his Court Containing \nNovel or Significant Interpretations of Law, No. Misc. 16-01 (FISC filed Oct. 21, 2016). \n5 \n\nMovants here satisfy all three requirements. \nA.  Denying Movants access to this Court's opinions constitutes an injury in fact. \nMovants seek access to four of the FISC 's opinions, and denial of access to these judicial \nopinions constitutes an injury sufficient to satisfy Article III. The injury-in-fact requirement is \ndesigned to ensure that the party invoking the court's jurisdiction has a \"personal stake in the \noutcome of the controversy.\" Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (l 975). Thus, the asserted \ninjury must be '\"concrete and particularized' and 'actual or imminent, not conjectural or \nhypothetical.\"' Susan B. Anthony List v. Driebus, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2341 (2014) (quoting Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 560). The injury or interest alleged must also be one that is \"legally and judicially \ncognizable.\" Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819 (l 997). \nA party who asserts a constitutional right of access to court records, and is denied that \naccess, has suffered an injury that is both concrete and particular. The injury is concrete because \nthe party seeking access is in fact being deprived of information, and it is particular because the \nparty specifically sought and was denied the material. Virtually every court has agreed, either \nexplicitly or implicitly, with this basic proposition. \nFor instance, the Supreme Court's decisions uniformly presume that a party seeking to \ninspect judicial records or attend court proceedings has standing. In Press-Enterprise Co. v. \nSuperior Court (\"Press-Enterprise If'), 4 78 U.S. 1 (1986), the Supreme Court considered \nwhether it had \"jurisdiction under Article III, § 2, of the Constitution.\" Id. at 6. While its \ndiscussion focused on the issue of mootness, the Court never questioned that the media company \nasserting a right of access had suffered an injury in fact. Nor did the Court anywhere suggest that \nthe media company's standing turned on the merits of its access claim. The Supreme Court's \nearlier right-of-access decisions are in line with this approach. See Globe Newspaper Co. v. \n6 \n\nSuperior Court, 457 U.S. 596, 603 (1982); Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v.  Virginia, 448 U.S. \n555, 563-64 (1980) (plurality); Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 377-78 (1979) \n(rejecting newspaper publisher's Sixth Amendment right-of-access claim on the merits). \nThe lower courts have followed suit. Nearly every court confronted with a claim of \naccess to judicial records or proceedings has held, either explicitly or implicitly, that the party \ndenied access has suffered an Article III injury. \nThe Seventh Circuit recently analyzed the question at length in response to a suit for \naccess to grand jury transcripts. Carlson v.  United States, 837 F.3d 753, 758-61 (7th Cir. 2016). \nIt recognized that the public has \"a general right to inspect and copy public records and \ndocuments, including judicial records and documents,\" and that \"[t]he denial at the threshold of \nthe right to petition for access inflicts an 'injury-in-fact.'\" Id. at 759 (quoting Nixon, 435 U.S. at \n597). It sharply distinguished standing from the merits, emphasizing that \"Carlson has standing \nto assert his claim to the grand-jury transcripts, because they are public records to which the \npublic may seek access, even if that effort is ultimately unsuccessful (perhaps because of sealing, \nnational security concerns, or other reasons).\" Id. at 757-58; see also id. at 759. The Fourth \nCircuit has likewise held that the denial of access to judicial records is an injury-in-fact. Doe v. \nPub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 264 (4th Cir. 2014) (holding that intervenors' injury \"is fanned by \ntheir inability to access judicial documents and materials filed in the proceedings below, \ninformation that they contend they have a right to obtain and inspect under the law\"); Jn re Wash. \nPost Co., 807 F.2d 383, 388 n.4 (4th Cir. 1986) (finding that newspaper \"meets the standing \nrequirement because it has suffered an injury that is likely to be redressed by a favorable \ndecision\"). Moreover, as the Fourth Circuit made clear, when the withheld information is \ncontained in court records, the injury is shared by all who wish to inspect those records-but that \n7 \n\ndoes not render the asserted injury insufficient under Article III, so long as the party invoking the \ncourt's jurisdiction has sought and been denied access. See Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d at 253, 264; \nPub. Citizen v. Dep 't ofJ ustice, 491 U.S. 440, 449-50 (1989) (\"The fact that other citizens or \ngroups of citizens might make the same complaint after unsuccessfully demanding disclosure \nunder F ACA does not lessen appellants' asserted injury.\"); Fed. Election Comm 'n v. Akins, 524 \nU.S. 11, 24 (1998). \nJust a few weeks ago, the D.C. Circuit implicitly affirmed the same principles when it \naddressed a right-of-access claim on the merits. Though a fractured panel held that the \nintervenors in Dhiab v.  Trump, No. 16-5011, 2017 WL 1192911 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 31, 2017), had \nno First Amendment right to access the force-feeding videotapes sought, none of the panel \njudges even entertained the idea that the intervenors lacked standing to pursue their access claim. \nEven Judge Williams, who questioned whether the videos sought were \"judicial records,\" plainly \n* \nbelieved that the court of appeals had jurisdiction to reach the merits. See id. at  12 (Williams, J., \nconcurring); see also Pansy v. Borough ofS troudsburg, 23 F.3d 772, 777 (3d Cir. 1994) (\"[W]e \nneed not determine that the Newspapers will ultimately obtain access to the sought-after \nSettlement Agreement. We need only find that the Order of Confidentiality being challenged \npresents an obstacle to the Newspapers' attempt to obtain access.\"); cf California First \nAmendment Coal. v. Calderon, 150 F .3d 976, 981 n.8 (9th Cir. 1998) (\"Although we conclude \nthat Procedure 770 does not violate the Coalition's First Amendment rights to gather news, the \nCoalition asserts an interest that is at least arguably protected by the first amendment.\"). \nEven outside the domain of judicial records and proceedings, courts have broadly \nrecognized that the denial of access to information or proceedings is almost always an injury in \nfact. \n8 \n\nThe Supreme Court has consistently held that a party suffers an Article III injury when he \nor she seeks and is denied information, regardless of whether the party is ultimately entitled to \nthe information sought. See Pub. Citizen, 491 U.S. at 449-50 (fact that a party sought and was \ndenied specific agency records \"constitutes a sufficiently distinct injury to provide standing\" \nunder the Freedom oflnformation Act); see also Akins, 524 U.S. at 21-25 (holding that a group \nof voters had a concrete injury based upon their inability to receive certain donor and campaign \nrelated information from an organization); Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 373-\n74 (1982) (concluding that deprivation of information about housing availability was sufficient \nto constitute an Article III injury). Perhaps most tellingly, even when the Supreme Court has \nrejected a claimed right of access on the merits, it has held or assumed that the party deprived of \naccess had standing. See, e.g., Pub. Citizen, 491 U.S. at 449-50; Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. \n817, 834 (1974) (rejecting, on the merits, reporters' claim that the First Amendment afforded \nright of access to prisons or their inmates); Saxbe v.  Washington Post Co., 417 U.S. 843 (1974) \n(similar). \nIn a related context, the Second Circuit recently held that a plaintiff denied access to \nadministrative proceedings had suffered an injury in fact. N. Y.  Civil Liberties Union v. N. Y.C. \nTransit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 294-95 (2d Cir. 2011). The court found that the plaintiff had \nstanding to assert a First Amendment violation because it had suffered an injury to \"a cognizable \ninterest\" in being excluded from hearings. Id. at 295. Standing did not depend on whether the \nplaintiff could show a First Amendment right to attend administrative hearings in general, or on \nwhether the plaintiff ultimately established a right to attend these hearings in particular. See also \nFlynt v. Rumsfeld, 355 F.3d 697, 702 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (observing, in case where reporter was \n9 \n\ndenied access to military combat units, \"we assume the validity of appellants' allegation of \ninjury, although having crossed that threshold, we may ultimately determine it to be invalid\"). \nThe case law is consistent on the question of Article III standing in right-of-access cases \nin part because the Supreme Court and other courts routinely distinguish between the \"judicially \ncognizable interest\" necessary to support standing and the legal entitlement necessary to prevail \non the merits. Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167 (1997). Those invoking the Court's \njurisdiction need not establish the latter to demonstrate the former. See Warth, 422 U.S. at 500 \n(\"[S]tanding in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiffs contention that particular conduct \nis illegal.\"); Initiative & Referendum Inst. v.  Walker, 450 F.3d 1082, 1093 (10th Cir. 2006) \n(\"[W]here the plaintiff presents a nonfrivolous legal challenge, alleging an injury to a protected \nright such as free speech, the federal courts may not dismiss for lack of standing on the theory \nthat the underlying interest is not legally protected.\"); Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 794-95 \n(7th Cir. 2008). As the Supreme Court explained, \"[i]t is firmly established ... that the absence \nof a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction, \ni.e., the courts' statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.\" Steel Co. v. Citizens for \na Better Env 't, 523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998). Accordingly, \"[d]ismissal for lack of subject-matter \njurisdiction because of the inadequacy of the federal claim is proper only when the claim is so \ninsubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of [the Supreme] Court, or otherwise \ncompletely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.\" Id. As described above, a \nparty's ability to access judicial opinions and records has repeatedly been recognized as a \n10 \n\nprotectable interest that is sufficient to support a party's standing and the subject-matter \njurisdiction of Article III courts. 9 \nThe Court erred in its Opinion by conflating Movants' standing with their ability to \nprevail on the merits. The Court's standing decision rested principally on its finding that \nMovants had not asserted a \"legally protected\" interest, see Op. at 2, but that finding was \nincorrect for several reasons. \nMost significantly, even the Court acknowledged that \"whether a litigant's interest is \n'legally protected' does not depend on the merits of the claim,\" Op. at 17; see id. at 13 (quoting \nWarth, 422 U.S. at 500)-yet the Court nonetheless went on to conclude that Movants' interest \nwas not legally protected here because it failed on the merits. See id. at 30-39 (\"Accordingly, the \nquestion for the Court is whether the First Amendment applies.\"). 10 Movants, of course, \nstrenuously disagree with the Court's conclusion that its legal opinions are categorically exempt \nfrom the First Amendment right of access. The crucial point here, though, is that it was improper \nfor the Court to hold that it lacked jurisdiction. As the Seventh Circuit has observed: \nThat [the] petition is not guaranteed to be granted, because a court may find a \nvalid justification for denying him access, in no way destroys his standing to seek \nthe documents .... To hold otherwise would amount to denying standing to \neveryone who cannot prevail on the merits, an outcome that fundamentally \nmisunderstands what standing is. \n9 Although Movants respectfully disagree with the heightened showing required by Judge \nSaylor in In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *2, Movants satisfy that standard too. \nThe access Movants seek \"would be of concrete, particular assistance to [Movants] in their own \nactivities,\" as Judge Saylor recognized when he concluded that the ACLU and the Media \nFreedom and Information Access Clinic had standing to seek disclosure of the Court's opinions \ninterpreting Section 215. Id. at *2--4; Order and Opinion at 10-11, In re Section 215 Orders, No. \nMisc. 13-02 (FISC Aug. 7, 2014), http://bit.ly/1Ca8eFC. \n° \n1 Compare In re Motion for Release ofC  ourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 487 (observing that \nwhile certain provisions ofFISA \"may have some limited bearing on the merits of the ACLU's \nclaim, ... they do not deprive this Court of the power to entertain that motion in the first place\"). \n11 \n\nCarlson, 837 F.3d at 759; see Initiative & Referendum Inst., 450 F.3d at 1092 (\"For purposes of \nstanding, the question cannot be whether the Constitution, properly interpreted, extends \nprotection to the plaintiffs asserted right or interest. If that were the test, every losing claim \nwould be dismissed for want of standing.\"); Judicial Watch, Inc. v.  U.S. Senate, 432 F.3d 359, \n364 (D.C. Cir. 2005). \nThis principle is so widely accepted that even the lone right-of-access case that the \nOpinion cites in support of its standing theory-the Seventh Circuit's decision in Bond v. \nUtreras, 585 F.3d 1061 (7th Cir. 2009}--fails to dispute it. See id. at 1073. Because the putative \nintervenor in Bond did not raise any \"colorable\" argument that the pre-trial discovery files he \nsought were \"judicial records,\" the Seventh Circuit found that he lacked standing. Id. at 1073-74. \nBut that decision also acknowledged that \"the general right of public access to judicial records is \nenough to give members of the public standing to attack a protective order that seals this \ninformation from public inspection.\" Id. at 1074 (emphasis added); see also id. at 1073 (\"It is \nbeyond dispute that most documents filed in court are presumptively open to the public; \nmembers of the media and the public may bring third-party challenges to protective orders that \nshield court records and court proceedings from public view.\"). Indeed, the Seventh Circuit \nreturned to this point in Carlson, where it distinguished Bond and found standing to consider a \nrequest for release of grand jury transcripts, which it readily concluded are judicial records. See \nCarlson, 837 F.3d at 758-60. This case is even more straightforward. There is no question that \nthe judicial opinions sought by Movants are judicial records, and thus they plainly fall within the \nambit of the First Amendment's protection. See Union Oil Co. v. Leavall, 220 F.3d 562, 568 (7th \nCir. 2000) (\"[I]t should go without saying that the judge's opinions and orders belong in the \npublic domain.\"); United States v. Mentzos, 462 F.3d 830, 843 n.4 (8th Cir. 2006) (denying \n12 \n\nmotion to file opinion under seal \"because the decisions of the court are a matter of public \nrecord\"); see generally U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner Mall P 'ship, 513 U.S. 18, 26 (1994) \n(\"Judicial precedents are ... valuable to the legal community as a whole. They are not merely \nthe property of private litigants.\"). \nMoreover, the Court's focus on the \"perplexity in the case law\" concerning whether, as a \ngeneral matter, an interest is judicially cognizable, see Op. 13-14, was unnecessary given the \nspecific interest presented by Movants' claims. As Movants have explained, the case law \noverwhelmingly recognizes that standing may be established based on a party's interest in, and \ndenial of access to, judicial records. To be sure, determining whether a given interest is judicially \ncognizable can present a difficult question in some cases. An asserted injury can be so \nunorthodox or frivolous that it is not \"judicially cognizable\" or \"legally protectable.\" See \nInitiative & Referendum Inst., 450 F.3d at 1093 (\"[A] plaintiff whose claimed legal right is so \npreposterous as to be legally frivolous may lack standing on the ground that the right is not \n'legally protected.\"'); Allen v.  Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 752 (1984) (questioning whether an injury \nmay be \"too abstract\" to be judicially cognizable). But that is not remotely the case here. As \nshown above, Movants assert a widely recognized interest--one routinely embraced by Article \nIII courts as a proper basis for exercising their jurisdiction. \nThere are compelling legal and practical reasons for courts to carefully avoid collapsing \nstanding and the merits. First, conflating the two invites courts to resolve constitutional questions \nat the threshold, as the Court did here, prior to evaluating other available forms of relief. \nCompare In re Section 215 Orders, 2013 WL 5460064, at *7-8 (ordering declassification review \nand partial release pursuant to Rule 62); see also United States v. Nat'/ Treasury Emps. Union, \n513 U.S. 454, 478 (1995) (describing the Supreme Court's \"policy of avoiding unnecessary \n13 \n\nadjudication of constitutional issues\"). Second, in the context of First Amendment right-of \naccess claims, conflating these questions may improperly shift the burden of proof on certain \nissues from the party resisting public access to the party seeking it. Ordinarily, it is the party \nresisting access that must establish both an overriding need for non-disclosure and narrow \ntailoring. See Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court (\"Press-Enterprise I\"), 464 U.S. 501, 510 \n(1984); Globe Newspaper, 457 U.S. at 606-07. But if standing depends on the merits, that \nburden suddenly belongs to the party seeking access, who must show jurisdiction at the outset. \nThird, in many cases, conflating standing with the merits would require courts to make \npremature factual determinations in the absence of an adequate record, because federal courts \nhave an independent obligation to assess their jurisdiction. Yet a detailed factual inquiry is \nusually inappropriate at the outset, where even \"a generalized allegation of injury in fact\" \nsuffices. See Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1012 n.3 (1992). \nFinally, contrary to the Opinion's suggestion, the fact that Movants, at this stage in the \nproceeding, are being denied access to only portions of these judicial opinions does not void \nMovants' standing. Op. at 1-2, 10. Movants continue to suffer an injury in fact with respect to \nthe undisclosed portions of the opinions. See, e.g., Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d at 255-57 (standing to \nseek redacted court opinion); United States v. Park, 619 F. Supp. 2d 89, 91-93 (S.D.N. Y. 2009). \nIndeed, it would make no sense to hold that the government's partial, voluntary disclosure of a \njudicial opinion-however limited-would eliminate a party's standing to petition the Court for \ndisclosure of the remainder of those opinions under the First Amendment. \nFor all these reasons, Movants' undisputed claim that they have sought and been denied \naccess to the Court's opinions is sufficient to establish that they have suffered an injury under \nArticle III. \n14 \n\nB.  Movants also satisfy the requirements of causation and redressability. \nMovants also satisfy the requirements of causation and redressability. Because this Court \nhas ultimate \"supervisory power over its own records and files,\" Nixon, 435 U.S. at 598, it is \nultimately responsible for determining which parts of its opinions, if any, the public may see. \nThe Court, in other words, has caused and may redress the denial of access that Movants \nchallenge. As this Court has previously held, it has the same authority over its records and files \nas any other Article III court and, therefore, may \"adjudicate a claim of right to the court's very \nown records and files.\" In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 487. \nThe decision under review appears to question this Court's authority over its own \nopinions and orders. In several places, it suggests that the Executive Branch was responsible for \nthe denial of access because it classified the information the Court included within its opinions. \nAlthough the decision does not state it expressly, the upshot of its logic appears to be that the \nExecutive Branch-not the Court-has denied Movants' access to the redacted portions of the \nopinions and that only the Executive Branch may remedy that denial. 11 \nRespectfully, this is incorrect. These records were created by Article III judges engaged \nin legal analysis while ruling on surveillance applications submitted by the government. As the \nSupreme Court has held, Article III courts have ultimate authority over their records and files. \nNixon, 435 U.S. at 598. This is no less true when the records contain information that the \n11 Op. at 1-2 (\"[T]he four opinions the Movants seek were never under seal and were \ndeclassified by the Executive Branch and made public with redactions in 2014. Consequently, \nalthough characterized as a request for the release of certain of this Court's judicial opinions, \nwhat the Movants actually seek is access to the redacted material that remains classified pursuant \nto the Executive Branch's independent classification authority.\"); Op. at 28 (\"The entirety of the \ninformation sought by the Movants is classified information redacted from public FISC opinions \nthat is being withheld by the Executive Branch pursuant to its independent classification \nauthorities and remains subject to the statutory mandate that the FISC maintain its records under \nthe aforementioned security procedures.\"). \n15 \n\ngovernment deems to be classified. Indeed, there are many contexts in which courts review the \npublic's right of access to classified information. Though courts typically accord a measure of \ndeference to the government's justifications for classifying information, courts make their own \ndeterminations of whether and to what extent judicial records should be sealed or redacted. They \ndo so under the Freedom of Information Act, in the face of the government's invocation of \nExemptions l and 3, under which the government may withhold properly classified information \nor information that would expose intelligence sources and methods. See Goldberg v. Dep 't of \nState, 818 F .2d 71, 77 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (even in the national-security context, courts must not \n\"relinquish[] their independent responsibility\" to review an agency's withholdings); Ctr. for \nConst'/ Rights v. CIA, 765 F.3d 161, 167 (2d Cir. 2014). They also do so in resolving claimed \nrights of access under the First Amendment. \nFor instance, in 1986, the Fourth Circuit considered a claimed right of access to records \nin criminal proceedings containing classified information. The government argued that the court \nhad to simply accept the government's judgment of what the public may see. The Fourth Circuit \nemphatically rejected that plea for complete deference: \n(W]e are equally troubled by the notion that the judiciary should abdicate its \ndecisionmaking responsibility to the executive branch whenever national security \nconcerns are present. History teaches us how easily the spectre of a threat to \n\"national security\" may be used to justify a wide variety of repressive government \nactions. A blind acceptance by the courts of the government's insistence on the \nneed for secrecy, without notice to others, without argument, and without a \nstatement of reasons, would impermissibly compromise the independence of the \njudiciary and open the door to possible abuse. \nIn re Wash. Post Co., 807 F.2d at 391-92. \nIn a recent Espionage Act prosecution involving a \"substantial amount of classified \ninformation,\" the government again claimed that its classification decisions set the bounds of \n16 \n\npublic access to the proceedings. See United States v. Rosen, 487 F. Supp. 2d 703, 705, 716-17 \n(E.D. Va. 2007). That court also emphatically rejected the government's claim: \nWhile it is true, as an abstract proposition, that the government's interest in \nprotecting classified information can be a qualifying compelling and overriding \ninterest, it is also true that the government must make a specific showing of harm \nto national security in specific cases to carry its burden in this regard. The \ngovernment's ipse dixit that information is damaging to national security is not \nsufficient to close the courtroom doors nor to obtain the functional equivalent, \nnamely trial by code. \n/d.at716-17. \nIn both of those cases, as in others, the courts conducted an independent evaluation of \nthe government's predictions of national-security harm in determining the public's right to \naccess judicial records. See also McGehee v. Casey, 718 F.2d 1137, 1148 (D.C. Cir. 1983) \n(\"Because the present case implicates first amendment rights, however, we feel compelled to go \nbeyond the FOIA standard ofreview for cases reviewing CIA censorship pursuant to secrecy \nagreements . ... Accordingly, the courts should require that CIA explanations justify censorship \nwith reasonable specificity, demonstrating a logical connection between the deleted information \nand the reasons for classification.\"); Doe v. Gonzales, 386 F. Supp. 2d 66, 76 (D. Conn. 2005) \n(\"While the court recognizes the defendants' expertise in the area of counter-terrorism and is \ninclined to afford their judgments in that area deference, those judgments remain subject to \njudicial review.\"); United States v. Grunden, 2 M.J. 116, 122 (C.M.A. 1977) (explaining that the \ntrial judge \"must be satisfied from all the evidence and circumstances\" that classification \nwarrants the closure of proceedings). \nThe Opinion's contrary view seems to stem from a misconception of the relationship \nbetween the First Amendment right of access and the government's classification authority. \nWhere the right of access applies, the standard for denying the public access to judicial records is \na constitutional one. See, e.g., In re Wash. Post Co., 807 F.2d at 391-92. The government may \n17 \n\nnot satisfy that constitutional standard by simple reference to the classification label it has \nassigned to a document. Except in narrow circumstances where Congress has expressly \nincorporated executive classification decisions into law, see, e.g., 5 U.S.C. § 552(b )(1 ), those \ndecisions have significance solely within the Executive Branch. They signify the Executive's \nbelief that disclosure of information would cause harm. But where the First Amendment right of \naccess applies, the government must demonstrate that harm to justify closure-not simply \ninvoke its own prior determination.12 \nMoreover, contrary to the Opinion's assertion, Op. at 29, the review that the First \nAmendment requires of claims of harm is not a direct review of the government's classification \ndecisions-the government may continue to label information as classified, no matter a court's \nruling on the First Amendment right of access. But the Court's constitutional review does carry \nconsequences; specifically, it determines whether the public has a legal right to access the \nCourt's records. See In re Wash. Post Co., 807 F.2d at 391-92 (addressing access to court \nproceedings). \n12 The D.C. Circuit's recent decision in Dhiab v.  Trump, 2017 WL 1192911, does not hold to \nthe contrary. While the panel reversed the unsealing of classified court records in a Guantanamo \nhabeas proceeding, it did so only after all three judges independently concluded that the \ngovernment had demonstrated in \"multiple ways\" a compelling need to seal the records. Id. at \n*7. The court made no holding about the existence or scope of the constitutional access right. \nJudge Randolph expressed doubt that the First Amendment right of access extended to classified \ninformation, habeas proceedings, or even civil proceedings. Id. at *3--6 (Randolph, J.). But \nJudges Rogers and Williams criticized his sweeping assertions about the lack of an access right, \nwith Judge Rogers refuting, at length, the notion that the right of access does not extend to \nclassified information. See id. at * 12 (Rogers, J., concurring) (noting that the Supreme Court \n\"crafted a test where the threshold First Amendment question is whether 'the particular process \nin question' passes the experience and logic test, not whether the records submitted in that \nproceeding contain classified information. Because the test accounts for the protection of \nnational security information, the presence of such information in a judicial proceeding does not \ncrowd out the decades-old and flexible approach set forth in Press-Enterprise II.\" (citations \nomitted)). \n18 \n\nSection l 803(c) does not alter this analysis. The Opinion cited that statute for the \nproposition that Congress has ordered the Court to treat the government's classification decisions \nas conclusive. Op. at 28-29. But the statute does not say this. Here is the full text of the \nprovision: \nProceedings under this chapter shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible. \nThe record of proceedings under this chapter, including applications made and \norders granted, shall be maintained under security measures established by the \nChief Justice in consultation with the Attorney General and the Director of \nNational Intelligence. \n50 U.S.C. § 1803(c). The statute directs the Chief Justice to \"establish[]\" security measures and \nrequires only \"consultation\" with Executive Branch officials. The statute leaves ultimate \nauthority over this Court's records where the Supreme Court first found it-with the Article III \ncourts. See Nixon, 435 U.S. at 598. \nIn any event, if the statute said what the Opinion says it does, the statute would violate \nthe First Amendment. The right of access is rooted in the First Amendment and may not be \nabridged by Congress. See, e.g., In re N. Y.  Times Co., 828 F.2d 110, 115 (2d Cir. 1987) \n(statutory confidentiality requirements imposed in the Wiretap Act \"cannot override\" the \nconstitutional access right). In deciding whether to deprive the public of access, the Court must \nmake its own determination that the constitutional standards are satisfied. Of course, the statute \nmay be relevant to the merits of Movants' claims; for example, the government may argue that it \nbears upon the \"logic\" and \"experience\" test. But if the Court ultimately agrees with Movants \nthat the First Amendment right of access applies to the legal opinions Movants seek, then that \nright would supersede any contrary legislative command. \nAccordingly, this Court has ultimate control over its orders and opinions and, as a result, \nhas caused and may redress the denial of access that Movants challenge. \n19 \n\nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Movants have standing to seek access to this Court's opinions. \nDated: April 17, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \nIsl Patrick Toomey \nDavid A.

Hogan, Presiding Judge  December 4, 2015 \nUnited States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nc/o Christine Gunning \nLitigation Secwity Group \nU.S. Department of Justice \n2 Constitution Square \n145 N Street N.E., Suite 2W-115 \nWashington, DC 20530 \nRe:  Notice of Supplemental Authority \nIn re Opinions & Orders oft his Court Addressing Bulk Collection ofD  ata \nUnder the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Docket No. Misc. 13-08 \nDear Judge Hogan: \nMovants American Civil Liberties Union, American Civil Liberties Union of the Nation's \nCapital, and the Media Freedom and Information Ac.cess Clinie (collectively \"Movants\") wish to \nbring to the Court's attention Section 402 of the USA Freedom Act of2015, Pub. L. No. 11+23 \n(June 2, 2015), codified at 50 U.S. C. § 1872, which supports Movants' pending motion for the \nrelease of court opinions. A copy of the provision is enclosed. \nAs the Court is aware, on November 6, 2013, Movants filed the motion at issue in this \ncase, asserting a First Amendment right of access to this Court's opinions addressing bulk \ncollection of data under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Government responded \nthat it already had released four heavily redacted Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n(\"FISC\") opinions that are responsive to the motion. Movants replied that the redactions to those \nopinions must be independently reviewed by the Court to determine whether they meet the \nstringent standard of scrutiny required to overcome the public's right of access. Movants also \nasked the Court to order declassification and to independently review any other responsive FISC \nopinions that may exist. The parties concluded briefing on the motion on December 20, 2013, \nand Movants submitted a first Notice of Supplemental Authority on October 30, 2014. The Court \nhas taken no action on the case since that time. \nOn Jwie 2, 2015, Congress passed and the President signed into law the USA FREEDOM \nAct. Pub. Law 114-23. Section 402 of the Act is relevant to this suit. It requires the Director of \nNational Intelligence (\"DNI\"}, in consultation with the Attorney General (\"AG\"}, to conduct a \ndeclassification review of \"each decision, order, or opinion issued by the [FISC or FISCR] that \nincludes a significant construction or interpretation of any provision of law,\" and to make such \ndecisions \"publicly available to the greatest extent practicable,\" with redactions if necessary. 50 \nU.S.C. § 1872(a)-(b). The DNI and AG are permitted to waive the requirement to declassify \ndecisions if they detennine \"that a waiver of such requirement is necessary to protect the national \nr.o. BOX 208215.

Section \n402 demonstrates Congress's judgment that significant FISC opinions should be published to the \ngreatest extent possible, and that public access to FISC opinions supports the proper functioning \nof the Court. Section 402 thus further strengthens Movants' claim asserting a First Amendment \nright of access to the opinions sought. \nIn light of this development, Movants respectfully ask the Court to rule on the pending \nmotions, to determine that there is a qualified First Amendment right of access to the opinions \nMovants seek, and to permit redactions of those opinions only to the extent they meet the strict \nstandard of constitutional scrutiny that is required to overcome this right. \nAlexander Abdo  athanM.

The \nACLU's motion should be dismissed because the relevant opinions have been subjected to \nclassification review and the unclassified portions released, and there is no basis for the Court to \norder a new classification review. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The ACLU's Motion Should Be Dismissed Because Declassified Versions ofthe \nRequested Opinions Have Already Been Released. \nThe ACLU's motion should be dismissed because this Court and the Government have \nalready released declassified versions of the opinions that the Government has determined are \nresponsive to the ACLU's motion after the Government conducted a classification review with \nthe objective to release as much information in the opinions as possible consistent with national \nsecurity.  A new classification review would duplicate the result of the thorough review the \nGovernment already conducted. \nAfter a review of this Court's opinions, the Government has identified four responsive \nopinions that address the legal basis for the \"bulk collection\" of data by the United States \nGovernment under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 50 U.S.c. § 1801 et seq., including \nbut not limited to 50 U.S.c. § 1842.  After a classification review conducted by the Executive \nBranch consistent with Executive Order 13,526 (Dec. 29, 2009), two of the opinions were \nreleased by the Executive Branch and two others were published by this Court.  They are: \n\n(1) the Court's Opinion (1. Kollar-Kotelly) granting the Government's application \nseeking the collection of bulk electronic communications metadata pursuant to \nSection 402 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Pen Register and Trap \nand Trace provision.  (Released by the Executive Branch on November 18,2013), \navailable at http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/II18/CLEANEDPRTT%20I.pdf. \n(2) the Court's Opinion (1. Bates) granting the Government's application seeking to re \ninstate the National Security Agency's bulk electronic communications metadata \nprogram following the Government's suspension of the program for several months \nto address compliance issues identified by the Government and brought to the Court's \nattention.  (Released by the Executive Branch on November 18, 2013), available at \nhttp://www.dni.gov/files/documents/III8/CLEANEDPRTT%202.pdf. \n(3) the Court's Opinion (1. McLaughlin) reauthorizing the collection of bulk telephony \nmetadata under the \"business records\" provision of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act and re-affirming that the bulk telephony metadata collection is both \nlawful and constitutional.  (Published by this Court on October IS, 2013), available at \nhttp://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisclbrl3-I5S-memo-13IOIS.pdf. \n(4) the Court's Opinion (1. Eagan) reauthorizing the collection of bulk telephony \nmetadata under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and affinning that the bulk \ntelephony metadata collection is both lawful and constitutional.  (Published by this \nCourt on September 17, 2013), available at \nhttp://www .u scourts. gov luscourtsl courts/fisclbr 13 -09-primary-order. pdf. \nBecause the Government has already conducted a thorough classification review of these \nopinions, there is no basis to require the Government to review them again. \nII.  The Court Should Not Order the Government to Conduct New Classification \nReviews of the Opinions. \nA.  The ACLU does not have standing to seek declassification. \nAlthough this Court has inherent authority to require a classification review of its own \nopinions as a matter of discretion, and can order such a review sua sponte, that authority should \nbe exercised in a manner that is consistent with FISA and this Court's rules.  FISA does not \nprovide third parties with the right to seek disclosure of classified FISC records.  In re Mot. for \n2 \n\nRelease of Ct. Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484,491 (Foreign Intel. Surv. Ct. 2007).  Under United \nStates Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") Rule of Procedure 62(a) (\"FISC Rule\"), \nonly a \"party\" may move the Court for publication of an opinion.!  This Court recently \nconcluded that \"the term 'party' in Rule 62(a) refers to a party to the proceeding that resulted in \nthe 'opinion, order, or other decision' being considered for publication.\"  In re Orders oft his Ct. \nInterpreting Section 215 oft he Patriot Act, Docket No. Misc. 13-02, Opinion and Order, at 11 \n(Foreign Intel. Surv. C1. Sept. 13,2013), available at \nhttp://www .u scourts. gov /uscourts/ courts/fisc/misc-I3 -02-order-I30813. pdf.  The A CLU   is not a \nparty to any of the proceedings that generated the relevant opinions and, therefore, does not have \nstanding to move for publication of the opinions. \nFISC Rule 62(a)'s limitation on who can move for publication of an order, opinion, or \nother decision is in accord with the fact that a comprehensive statutory regime-the Freedom of \nInformation Act (\"FOIA\")-govems requests for documents classified by and in the possession \nofthe Executive Branch.  See In re Release, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 491 n.I8, 496 n.32.  As this \nCourt has recognized, although this Court has supervisory power over its own records and could \nRule 62.  Release of Court Records \n1 \n(a) Publication of Opinions.  The judge who authored an order, opinion, or \nother decision may sua sponte or on motion by a party request that it be \npublished.  Upon such request, the Presiding Judge, after consulting with \nother Judges of the Court, may direct that an order, opinion or other \ndecision be published.  Before publication, the Court may, as appropriate, \ndirect the Executive Branch to review the order, opinion, or other decision \nand redact it as necessary to ensure that properly classified information is \nappropriately protected pursuant to Executive Order 13526 (or \nits successor). \nFISC Rule of Procedure 62(a). \n3 \n\nconduct a review \"under the same standards as a district court would in FOIA litigation,\" \"there \nwould be no point in this Court's merely duplicating the judicial review that the ACLU, and \nanyone else, can obtain by submitting a FOIA request to the Department of Justice for these \nsame records.\"  Id. at 496 n.32. \nThe Court should insist that the ACLU respect, and not through its motion attempt to \ncircumvent, the FOIA process enacted by Congress.  Accordingly, the Government submits that \nthe Court should not exercise its inherent discretion to determine whether to order a \ndeclassification review in this case.  FOIA carefully prescribes a process whereby parties must \nfirst seek administrative review of FOIA requests before bringing litigation, and FOIA includes \nadditional exemptions beyond the classification exemptions that would overlap with a \ndeclassification review ordered by the FISC.  Such duplicative processes therefore raise \nadministrative concerns, and the FISC should resist invitations to serve as an alternative forum \nfor FISC-related matters that can and should be resolved through the FOIA process established \nby Congress. \nB.  This Court traditionally does not involve itself with the Executive Branch's \nclassification decisions. \nThe ACLU seeks an order giving it full access to the opinions or, in the alternative, \nrequiring the Government to justify any redactions to the Court as necessary to prevent a \nsubstantial probability of harm to a compelling interest.  The ACLU also seeks the right to \ncontest redactions.  The ACLU invokes the First Amendment, but the First Amendment does not \njustify judicial (or ACLU) involvement in Executive Branch classification decisions. \n4 \n\nPutting aside the fact that this Court has repeatedly rejected arguments that litigants such \nas the ACLU have a First Amendment right to access classified FISA court records,2 the Court \ndoes not interfere with the Government's classification process and classification decisions. \nUnder FISC Rule 62(a), the Court is empowered only to \"direct the Executive Branch to review \nthe [opinion] and redact it as necessary to ensure that properly classified information is \nappropriately protected.\"  This limitation on the Court's discretion is consistent with the \nrequirement that, \"[i]n all matters, the Court and its staff shall comply with the security measures \nestablished pursuant to [Congressional mandate], as well as Executive Order 13526.\" FISC Rule \n3; see also FISC Rule 62(b) (mandating that a release of FISC records must be conducted \"in \nconformance with the security measures referenced in Rule 3\"). Executive Order 13,526 \n\"prescribes a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security \ninformation,\" and under that system only certain designated Executive Branch officials can \nclassify or declassify national security information.  See Executive Order 13,526. \nConsistent with the Court's Rules of Procedure, the Court's decisions also make clear \nthat the Court does not involve itself with the Executive Branch's declassification decisions. \nIndeed, \"if the FISC were to assume the role of independently making declassification and \n2 See In re Mot. for Release of Ct. Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484 (Foreign Intel. Surv. Ct. 2007); \nIn re Mot. for Release of Ct. Records, Memorandum Opinion, Docket No. Misc. 07-01 (Foreign \nIntel. Surv. Ct.

Surv. Ct. July 5, 2013)).  In this Court's most recent Opinion and Order involving the \nACLU, the Court chose not to \"reach[] the merits of the [ACLU's] asserted right of public access \nunder the First Amendment.\" See In re Orders of this Ct.

No. 95-1283, pt. 1, at 25-26 (1978)).  And, while FISC judges may \nhave \"more expertise in national security matters than a typical district court judge, that expertise \n[does] not equal that of the Executive Branch, which is constitutionally entrusted with protecting \nthe national security.\"  Id.  Thus, this Court has recognized that \"there is no role for this Court \nindependently to review, and potentially override, Executive Branch classification decisions.\" \nId. at 491.3  This Court recently reiterated that \"[i]t is fundamentally the Executive Branch's \nresponsibility to safeguard sensitive national security information.\"  In re Mot. for Consent to \nDisclosure of Ct. Records, Docket No. Misc. 13-01, Opinion and Order, at 6 (Foreign Intel. Surv. \nCt. June 12,2013) (citing Department ofN  avy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527-29 (1988)), available \nat www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/misc-13-01-opinion-order.pdf.Thus.this Court should \ndeny the ACLU's First Amendment classification review request and the ACLU's request to \ncontest any redactions. \nFor these reasons, the Court should deny the ACLU's request for new classification \nreviews of the relevant opinions.  There is no need for this Court to order new classification \nreviews of the relevant opinions because the Government recently conducted thorough \nclassification reviews of these opinions and made \"public as much information as possible about \ncertain sensitive intelligence collection programs undertaken under the authority of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) while being mindful of the need to protect national \n3 This is not to say that Executive Branch classifications are never judicially reviewable.

The answer is straightforward:  movants have not \nestablished Article III standing because they cannot identify a legally protected interest given \nthat the right they claim does not apply.  Movants seek to resist this obvious conclusion by \nsuggesting that their underlying argument - that there is a First Amendment right of public \naccess to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) proceedings and records, including the \nclassified material at issue in this case - is open for debate.  But as the question before the en \nbane Court makes clear, movants' First Amendment argument, which was never colorable, is \nforeclosed.  As such, they have no legally protected interest and thus no standing. \nI.  Movants Lack an Injury to a Legally Protected Interest \nAs movants concede, see Movants' Br. 10, the Supreme Court has held that there is no \nfederal jurisdiction over a claim that is ''insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions \nof this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit.\"  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env 't, \n523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998) (quotation marks omitted).  Thus, to have standing, movants must \nestablish \"an injury to an interest that the law protects when it is wrongfully invaded.\"  Bond v. \nUtreras, 585 F .3d 1061, 1073 (7th Cir. 2009) (emphasis omitted).  Mo van ts have not established \n\nsuch a legally protected interest.  Rather, the interest they posit - a supposed First Amendment \nright of access to proceedings, records, and rulings of this Court - is implausible in light of \nbinding Supreme Court case law and is foreclosed by prior opinions of this Court.  Indeed, that \nclaim's lack of merit is part of the premise pursuant to which this Court accepted en bane review. \nMovants rely on Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1 (1986), but that \nopinion provides for a First Amendment right of access to judicial proceedings only where both \n(1) \"the place and process have historically been open to the press and general public\" (the \n\"experience\" test), and (2) \"public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of \nthe particular process in question\" (the ''logic\" test).  Id. at 8.  Any claim that there is a tradition \nof public access to \"proceedings that relate to applications made by the Executive Branch for the \nissuance of court orders approving authorities covered exclusively by\" the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act (\"FISA\"), In re Opinions & Orders oft his Court Addressing Bulk Collection of \n* \nData under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 2017 WL 427591, at  19 (FISA Ct. Jan. \n25, 2017), is both baseless and foreclosed.  And any argument that it would be logical to open up \nto the public classified proceedings or documents concerning foreign intelligence gathering is \ninsubstantial, given the prospect of harms to national security that \"are real and significant, and, \nquite frankly, beyond debate.\"  In re Motion/or Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, \n494 (FISA Ct. 2007). \nThe insubstantiality of movants' First Amendment argument has been explained by this \nCourt multiple times.  The Court first rejected this argument a decade ago when one of the \nmovants here, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), asserted it in an effort to obtain \npublic access to FISC proceedings and rulings, including rulings that '\"include legal analysis and \nlegal rulings concerning the meaning of FlSA. \"' Id. at 493 (quoting brief of ACLU).  This Court \n2 \n\nexplained that \"the ACLU's First Amendment claim runs counter to a long-established and \nvirtually unbroken practice of excluding the public from FISA applications and orders.\"  Id.  The \nCourt further explained that the public access sought by the ACLU failed the \"logic\" test because \nit could assist adversaries in avoiding surveillance, seriously harm those targeted for \nsurveillance, chill cooperation with investigators, damage relations with foreign governments, \n\"chill the government's interactions with the Court,'' and threaten \"the free flow of information \nto the FISC that is needed for an ex parte proceeding to result in sound decisionmaking and \neffective oversight.\" Id. at 494-96; accord In re Motion for Release of Court Records, Misc. 07-\n01, at 6-7 (FISA Ct. Feb. 8, 2008); In re Proceedings Required by§ 702 of the FISA \nAmendments Act of 2008, 2008 WL 9487946, at *3-4 (FISA Ct. Aug. 27, 2008). \nEven before the Presiding Judge's opinion in this case, it was clear and established that \nthe purported First Amendment right of access to FISC proceedings and records did not exist.  In \nthat opinion, the Presiding Judge explained that movant's attempt to resist the Court's earlier \nholdings was \"premised on a misreading of the Court's analysis and an overly broad framing of \nthe legal question.\"  In re Opinions & Orders, 2017 WL 427591, at *19.  The Presiding Judge \nfurther explained that the correct framing of the \"experience\" test was whether \"proceedings that \nrelate to applications made by the Executive Branch for the issuance of court orders approving \nauthorities covered exclusively by FISA'' have \"historically been open to the press and general \npublic.\" Id.  They have not; indeed, the record \"reflect[s] a tradition of no public access.\"  Id. \nRegarding the \"logic\" test the Presiding Judge noted that movants have failed \"to explain why \nthey believe [the Court's earlier] conclusion was flawed\" and failed to \"refute the Court's \nidentification of the detrimental effects that could cause a diminished flow of information as a \n3 \n\nresult of public access,\" instead offering only ·'a generalized assertion that they disagree.\"  Id. at \n*20 (citing Motion for Release, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 494-96). \nMovants' underlying First Amendment argument was insubstantial from its inception, \nand it is now foreclosed.  The question before the en bane Court is whether, given that it is \nestablished that there is no First Amendment right of access to FISC proceedings, records, and \nrulings, movants have nevertheless established \"'an invasion of a legally protected interest.\"' \nSpokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1548 (2016) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)) (emphasis added).  They have not because the interest they assert \npublic access to FISC proceedings and records - is not legally protected.  See In re Opinions & \nOrders, 2017 WL 427591, at *16-21. \nMovants cite to the D.C. Circuit's recent decision in Dhiab v. Trump,_ F.3d _, 2017 \nWL 1192911 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 31, 2017).  That case further undermines movants' First \nAmendment argument.  See id. at *5 (Op. of Randolph, S.J.) (observing that \"from the beginning \nof the republic to the present day, there is no tradition of publicizing secret national security \ninformation involved in civil cases, or for that matter, in criminal cases,\" as the \"tradition is \nexactly the opposite\").  Movants point out that in Dhiab, the request for classified material was \nrejected on the merits, not for lack of standing.  Movant's Br. 8.  True, but that is because the \nclaim in Dhiab was not clearly foreclosed by Press-Enterprise and other precedent, as the claim \nhere is.  Cf Bond, 585 F .3d at 1073 (explaining that \"the Supreme Court's standing doctrine \nrequires litigants to establish an injury to an interest that the law protects when it is wrongfully \ninvaded, and this is quite different from requiring them to establish a meritorious legal claim\") \n(quotation marks omitted). \n4 \n\nIn light of Press-Enterprise and this Court's line of cases described above, Movants' \nasserted First Amendment right of access to FISC proceedings, records, and rulings \"has no \nfoundation in law.\"  Claybrook v. Slater, 111 F .3d 904, 907 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  As such, movants \nhave \"no legally protected interest and thus no standing to sue.\"  Id. \nMovants' appeal to what they call \"compelling legal and practical reasons\" to reject their \nclaim on the merits rather than on jurisdictional grounds, see Movants' Br. 13, fares no better. \nThe canon of constitutional avoidance has no application here.  Both the question of Article III \njurisdiction and the scope of the First Amendment are constitutional questions, and both must be \naddressed.  As the government explained in its opening brief, there are no nonconstitutional \nbases for relief here.  See Gov't Br. 9-11.  Nor is the \"burden of proof' a relevant consideration. \nThe question whether movants' First Amendment claim is insubstantial or foreclosed is a purely \nlegal one on which neither party bears a burden to prove disputed facts. \nII.  Movants' Misunderstand the Constitutional Power To Classify and To Protect \nSensitive National Security Information \nMovants' contention that Executive Branch classification should have no \"significance\" \nto the judiciary, Movant's Br. 18, is dangerously misguided.  The Executive Branch has an \ninherent constitutional power \"to classify and control access to information bearing on national \nsecurity.\"  Dep 't of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  And \"[f]or 'reasons too obvious \nto call for enlarged discussion, the protection of classified information must be committed to the \nbroad discretion of the agency responsible, and this must include broad discretion to determine \nwho may have access to it.\"' Id. at 529 (quoting CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 170 (1985)) \n(alteration omitted).  Preventing access to properly classified information is a \"compelling \ninterest.\"  Id. at 527 (quotation marks omitted).  This executive branch constitutional prerogative \nis routinely and uniformly respected by the judiciary, and rightly so.  See, e.g., NCRI v. Dep 't of \n5 \n\nState, 251F.3d192, 209-10 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (determinations about access to classified \ninformation are \"within the privilege and prerogative of the executive, and we do not intend to \ncompel a breach in the security which that branch is charged to protect\").  Apart from the \ndeferential standard applied in cases such as those brought pursuant to the Freedom of \nInformation Act (\"FOIA\"), courts have long recognized that classification decisions are \ncommitted to the executive branch.  See, e.g., Egan, 484 U.S. at 529; Bismullah v. Gates, 501 \nF.3d 178, 187-88 (D.C. Cir. 2007); McGehee v. Casey, 718 F.2d 1137, 1147-50 & n.22 (D.C. \nCir. 1983) (holding that the court's role was limited to \"merely ... determin[ing] that the CIA \nproperly classified the deleted items,\" as the court \"cannot second-guess\" the executive branch's \nnational security judgments). \nThe cases relied on by movants are not to the contrary.  In In re Washington Post Co., the \ncourt imposed procedural requirements for closing a sentencing hearing and sealing documents \nin a criminal case after determining that those procedures would not \"create an unacceptable \nrisk\" of the \"inappropriate disclosure of classified information,\" an important consideration \ngiven that such \"disclosure of classified information could endanger the lives of both Americans \nand their foreign informants.\"  807 F.2d 383, 391 (4th Cir. 1986).  In United States v. Rosen, the \ncourt recognized that, \"[o  ]f course, classification decisions are for the Executive Branch,\" but \nheld that the presence of classified information in a case would not justify \"effectively clos[ing] \nportions\" of a jury trial.  487 F. Supp. 2d 703, 717, 720 (E.D. Va. 2007).  In neither case did the \ncourt overrule any classification decision or order the release of any classified information, and \nboth courts observed that classified court records and rulings could be sealed from the public. \nSee Washington Post, 807 F.2d at 391; Rosen, 487 F. Supp. 2d at 706, 720. \n6 \n\nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, those stated in the government's April 17, 2017 submission, \nand those explained in the Presiding Judge's opinion in this case, movants lack Article III \nstanding, and this action should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \nMay 1, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \nDANA J.

The FISCR answered the certified question by finding that Movants' claim \nmet all three elements of standing (causation, redressability, and injury in fact) but declined the \nUnited States' request to determine also whether this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over \nMovants' claim and, if so, to determine the merits of the Movants' claim, believing it appropriatd \n.  ! \nfor the FISC to address both issues in the first instance with the benefit of full briefing by the \nparties.  See In re: Certification ofQ  uestions ofL aw to the FISCR, FISCR Docket No. 18-01 \n(March 16, 2018), at 7-8. \nAccordingly, it is hereby: \nORDERED that Movants file a brief setting forth the basis for their assertion ofFISC \nsubject matter jurisdiction over their claim. Movants' brief should address: ( 1) any statutory \ngrant of subject matter jurisdiction over a constitutional claim for access to judicial opinions \nincluding, in particular, a discussion of whether adjudication ofMovants' claim falls within the \nscope of 50 U.S.C. § 1803(g)(l) as an action reasonably necessary to the FISC's administration \nof its responsibilities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act; and (2) any other authority \nI \n\nsupporting Movants' assertion of FISC subject matter jurisdiction over their claim including, in \nparticular, any case law addressing the inherent authority of a court of limited or specialized \njurisdiction to adjudicate claims falling outside the court's subject matter jurisdiction, as \nexplicitly granted by statute.  Movants' brief may also address the merits of their claim but only \nto the extent additional briefing relates to legal authority that has not been addressed in their \nprior submissions to the Court.  Movants' brief shall be filed no later than 3:00 p.m. on June 13 \n2018.

Amicus curiae is \ninvited to file a brief addressing the above-described issues no later than 3:00 p.m. on June 13, \n2018.  It further is \nORDERED that any response by the United States shall be filed no later than 3 :00 p.m. \non July 11, 2018.  In addition to addressing subject matter jurisdiction, the United States may  : \naddress the merits of Movants' claim, but only to the extent additional briefing relates to legal \nauthority that has not been addressed in its prior submissions to the Court or directly responds to \narguments made in Movants' brief.

Hogan, Presiding Judge \nUnited States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nc/o Christine Gunning \nLitigation Security Group \nU.S. Department of Justice \n2 Constitution Square \n145 N Street N.E., Suite 2W-l 15 \nWashington, DC 20530 \nRe:  Notice of Supplemental Authority Regarding Plaintiffs' Motion for Release \nof Court Records in In re Opinions & Orders of this Court Addressing Bulk \nCollection ofD  ata Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Docket No. \nMisc. 13-08 \nDear Judge Hogan: \nPlaintiffs American Civil Liberties Union, American Civil Liberties Union of the \nNation's Capital, and the Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic (collectively \n\"Plaintiffs\") wish to bring to the attention of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n(\"FISC\") an opinion issued this month by the District Court for the District of Columbia that \nbears on Plaintiffs' pending motion for the release of court records. \nIn Dhiab v.  Obama, No. 05-1457, 2014 WL 4954458 (D.D.C. Oct. 3, 2014), members of \nthe press moved to intervene in a Guantanamo Bay habeas corpus proceeding.  The press sought \naccess to videotape recordings that were introduced as evidence but filed under seal based on the \ngovernment's claim that they were classified and that their disclosure \"could reasonably be \nexpected to cause serious damage to national security[.]\"  Id. at *2 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  The Court applied the First Amendment right of access standard announced in Press-\nEnterprise Co. v. Superior Court ofC  alifornia (Press-Enterprise II), 478 U.S. 1 (1986), rejected \nthe Government's contentions, and ordered the videotapes unsealed.1 \nIn announcing the applicable standard, the Court reiterated that \"[t]he first amendment \nguarantees the press and public a general right of access to court proceedings and court \ndocuments unless there are compelling reasons demonstrating why it cannot be observed.\"  Id. at \n*3 (citing Washington Post v. Robinson, 935 F.2d 282, 287 (D.C. Cir. 1991)).  The Court then \napplied the two-part \"experience and logic\" test of Press-Enterprise II, finding that both prongs \nsupported disclosure of the classified evidence.  Id. at *5 (citing New York Times Co. v.  United \nStates, 403 U.S. 713, 728 (1971) (observing that in the areas of national defense and \n1 The District Court has entered an administrative stay for 30 days for briefing on a motion to stay pending appeal. \nP.O.

The Court expressed its concern in \nparticular with \"the notion that the judiciary should abdicate its decision-making responsibility to \nthe executive branch whenever national security concerns are present.\"  Id. at *6 (quoting In re \nWashington Post Co., 807 F.2d 383, 391-92 (4th Cir. 1986)).  The Court concluded: \nIn short, it is our responsibility, as judges, as part of our obligation \nunder the Constitution, to ensure that any efforts to limit our First \nAmendment protections are scrutinized with the greatest of care. \nThat responsibility can not be ignored or abdicated. \nId. at *7. \nA copy of the District Court's opinion is enclosed for the FISC's convenience. \nRespectfully submitted, \n~ \nAlexander Abdo \nPatrick Toomey  David A.

Factual  Background \nWa' el  (Jihad)  Dhiab,  a  citizen  of  Syria,  has  been  held  by \nthe  United  States  Government  in  a  detention  facility  at  the \nUnited  States  Naval  Base  in  Guantanamo  Bay,  Cuba  since  as  early \nas  2 002. 1  Dkt.

To  this  day,  he  remains \nimprisoned  there.  In  protest  of  his  indefinite  detent ion,  Mr . \nDhiab  has  been  on  a  long-term  hunger  strike.  [Dkt.  No.  175). \nPetitioner alleges  that  the  \"precise  date\"  of  his  transfer \nto  Guantanamo  Bay  is \"unknown  to  [his)  counsel,  but  known  to \nRespondents.\"  [Dkt .  No.  1  at  1  23). \n-2-\n\n.. \n'  \\  Case 1:05-cv-01457-GK  Document 349  Filed 10/03/14  Page 3 of 29 \nOn  April  9,  2013,  the  Government  notified  Mr.  Dhiab's \ncounsel  that,  in  response  to  his  on-going  hunger  strike,  it had \nbegun  to  feed  Mr.  Dhiab  nasogastrically  against  his  will.  [Dkt. \nNo.  175] .  Mr.  Dhiab  continues  to  undergo  enter al  feeding  when \nthe  Government  deems  it  necessary.  Alka  Pradhan  Deel.  at  <j[  6 \n[ D kt .  No .  2 5 6 ] • \nThe  Government  has  explained  that  when  prisoners  fail  to \nfollow  instructions,  resist  guards  (or  \"demonstrate  the  intent \nto  resist\"),  cause  a  disturbance,  or  endanger  themselves  or \nanyone  else,  they  are  removed  from  their  cells  and  taken  to  the \nmedical  facilities  where  enteral  feeding  takes  place.  Col.Bogdan \nDeel.  at  1  7  [Dkt.  No.  288].  The  military  officials  in  charge  of \nthe  Guantanamo  Bay  facility  sometimes  employ  a  method  called \nForced  Cell  Extraction  (\"FCE\")  in  order  to  accomplish  the \nfeeding.  The  FCE  procedures  practiced  at  the  Guantanamo  Bay \nfacility  are  modeled  on  those  used  by  military  corrections \nfacilities  and  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Prisons.  Col.  Bogdan  Deel. \nat  <j[<j[  4,  5. \nIn  May  of  2014,  the  Government  disclosed  that  it  possessed \nvideotapes  of  Mr.  Dhiab's  forced-feedings  and  forcible  cell \nextractions.  [ Dkt.  No.  21 7] .  Mr.  Dhiab  has  left  no  doubt  that  he \nwants  these  videotapes  to  be  made  public.  Intervenors'  Mot.  at  1 \n[Dkt.

Procedural  Background \nOn  July  22,  2005,  Mr.  Dhiab  filed  his  Petition  for  a  Writ \nof  Habeas  Corpus,  asserting  that  his  indefinite  detention  by  the \nUnited  States  Government  violated  the  U.S.  Constitution,  the \nAlien  Tort  Statute,  2 8  U.S. C.  §  1350,  and  international  law. \n[ Dkt.  No.  1] .  His  Petition  further  alleged  that  the  conditions \nof  his  confinement  violated  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United \nStates  Cons ti tut ion.  [ Dkt.  No.  1] . \nOn  July  30,  2013,  Mr.  Dhiab  and  several  other  hunger-\nstriking  detainees  submitted  a  motion  to  enjoin  the  Government \nfrom  continuing  to  enterally  feeding  them.  [ Dkt.  No.  175] .  This \nCourt  denied  the  Motion  for  a  Preliminary  Injunction  for  lack  of \nsubject matter  jurisdiction.  [Dkt.  No.  183]. \nOn  February  11,  2014,  our  Court  of  Appeals  held  that  this \nCourt  does  have  subject  matter  jurisdiction  to  hear  Guantanamo \nBay  detainees'  challenges  to  the  conditions  of  their \nconfinement.  See  Aamer  v.  Obama,  742  F.3d  1023,  1038  (D.C.  Cir. \n2014). \n-4-\n\n.. \nCase 1:05-cv-01457-GK  Document 349  Filed 10/03/14  Page 5 of 29 \nAccordingly,  on  April  18,  2014,  Mr.  Dhiab  again  filed  a \nMotion  for  a  Preliminary  Injunction,  requesting  that  the  Court \nenjoin  the  Government  from  enterally  feeding  him  and  from \nforcibly  extracting  him  from  his  cell.  [Dkt.  No.  203].  After \nPetitioner  renewed  his  Motion,  the  Government  disclosed  that  it \npossessed  videotapes  of  Mr.  Dhiab' s  forced-feedings  and  FCEs. \n[ Dkt.  No.  21 7] . \nOn  May  13,  2014,  Petitioner  filed  an  Emergency  Motion  for \nan  order  compelling  the  Government  to  preserve  videotapes  of  Mr. \nDhiab's  forced-feedings  and  forcible  cell  extractions  and  to \nproduce  those  videotapes  to  Petitioner's  counsel.  [Dkt.  No. \n21 7] .  On  May  2 3,  2014,  the  Court  granted  Petitioner's  Motion  in \npart,  and  directed  the  Government  to  produce  to  Petitioner's \ncounsel  \"all  videotapes  made  between  April  9,  2013  and  February \n19'  2014,  that  record  both  [Mr.  Dhiab's]  Forcible  Cell \nExtractions  and  subsequent  enteral  feeding.\"  [Dkt.  No.  225].  The \nGovernment  complied  with  that  Order,  and  later  provided \nadditional  videotapes  to  Petitioner's  counsel.  [ Dkt  No.  250] . \nIn  a  series  of  filings  beginning  June  14,  2014,  Petitioner \nplaced  28  videotapes  in  the  judicial  record  for  this  case.  [Dkt. \nNos.  252,  262,  267]  The  Government  produced  four  additional \nvideotapes  to  Petitioner  and  asserts  that  \"they  are \nsubstantially  the  same  as  the  [other]  28  videos.\"  Resp'ts'  Opp'n \nat  4  n.3. \n-5-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01457-GK  Document 349  Filed 10/03/14  Page 6 of 29 \nThe  videotapes  have  been  classifi ed  at  the  \"secret\"  level, \nRDML  Butler  Deel.  at  'IT  7,  based  on  the  Government's  belief  that \nthe  contents  of  these  twenty-eight  videotapes  \"could  reasonably \nbe  expected  to  cause  serious  damage  to  national  security  i f \ndisclosed[,]\"  Id.  at  'IT  5.

Members  of  the  news  media  may  properly \nintervene  for  the  purpose  of  seeking  t o  unseal  judicial  records. \nSee  In  re  Guantanamo  Bay  Detainee  Lit.,  624  F.Supp.2d  27,  31 \n(D.D.C.  2009)  (\"Detainee  Lit.

Standard  for  Unsealing  Judicial  Records \nA.

Richmond  Newspapers  Inc.  v.  Virginia, \n448  U.S.  555,  575-76  (1980).  Our  Court  of  Appeals  has  held  that \n\" [ t] he  first  amendment  guarantees  the  press  and  the  public  a \ngeneral  right  of  access  to  court  proceedings  and  court  documents \nunless  there  are  compelling  reasons  demonstrating  why  it  cannot \nbe  observed.\"  Washington  Post  v.  Robinson,  935  F. 2d  2 8 2,  287 \n(D.C.  Cir.  1991)  (emphasis  added). \nAs  Judge  Hogan  explained  in  Detainee  Lit.  I,  62 4  F. Supp. 2d \nat  35,  in  order  to  determine  whether  a  particular  proceeding  and \nrelated  judicial  records  are  subject  to  the  public's  right  of \naccess,  courts  apply  a  two-part  test,  commonly  referred  to  as \nthe  test  of  \"experience  and  logic,\"  Press-Enterprise  Co.  v. \nSuperior  Court,  478  U.S.  1,  8-9  (1986)  (\"Press-Enterprise  II\"). \nThe  first  prong  of  that  test  asks  whether  there  is  a  history  of \naccess  to  the  proceeding.  Press-Enterprise  II,  478  U.S.  at  8-9. \nThe  second  prong  considers  whether  public  access  \"plays  a \nsignificant  positive  role  in  the  functioning  of  the  particular \nprocess  in  question.\"  Id.  Failure  at  either  stage  of  the  test  is \nfatal  to  a  First  Amendment  public  access  claim.  See  United \nStates  v.  El-Sayegh,  131  F.3d  158,  161  (D.C.  Cir.  1997) .2 \n2  In  addition  to  the  First  Amendment  right  of  access  to \njudicial  records,  the  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  a  common  law \nright  \"to  inspect  and  copy  judicial  records.\"  Nixon  v.

Court  Discretion  to  Seal  Judicial  Records \nIn  a  trio  of  cases--Bismullah,  Parhat,  and  Arneziane--our \nCourt  of  Appeals  developed  the  standard  for  determining  whether \ninformation  on  the  docket  of  Guantanamo  Bay  detainee  habeas \ncases  may  be  sealed  from  public  disclosure.  In  order  to  keep \njudicial  records  under  seal,  \"the  [G]overnment  first  must \ndemonstrate  what  kind  of  information  requires  protection  and \nwhy,  and  then  must  show  exactly  what  information  in  the  case  at \nhand  it  seeks  to  protect.\"  Arneziane  v.  Obama,  699  F.3d  488,  495 \n(D.C.  Cir.  2012)  (emphasis  in  original). \nFirst,  in  Bismullah  v.  Gates,  501  F.3d  178,  187-89  vacated \n554  U.S.  913  (2008),  reinstated,  Order,  No.  06-1197  (D.C.  Cir. \nAug.  22,  2008),  petitions  dismissed  for  lack  of  jurisdiction, \n551  F.3d  1068  (D.C.  Cir.  2009)  the  Court  of  Appeals  considered \nhow  and  when  to  protect  the  sensitive  information  common  to  the \nGuantanamo  Bay  detainee  habeas  cases  and  made  clear  that  \"[i]t \nis  the  court,  not  the  Government,  that  has  discretion  to  seal  a \n-9-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01457-GK  Document 349  Filed 10/03/14  Page 10 of 29 \njudicial  record,  which  the  public  ordinarily  has  the  right  to \ninspect  and  copy.\"  (internal  citations  omitted).  Accordingly, \nthe  Court  rejected  a  Government  proposal  that  would  have  granted \nit  the  authority  to  determine  unilaterally  whether  unclassified \ninformation  is  \"protected\"  and  therefore  kept  under  seal.  Id. \nSecond,  in  Parhat  v.  Gates,  532  F.3d  834,  852-53  (D.C.  Cir. \n2008),  the  Court  of  Appeals  further  explained  that  in  order  to \nmaintain  records  under  seal,  the  Government  must  provide  an \n\"explanation  tailored  to  the  specific  information  at  issue\" \nrather  than  \"spare,  generic  assertions  of  the  need  to  protect \ninformation.\"  The  Court  rejected  the  Government's  motion  to \nprotect  from  public  disclosure  \"all  nonclassified  record \ninformation  that  it  has  labeled  law  enforcement  sensitive,  as \nwell  as  the  names  and  identifying  information  of  all  U.S. \ngovernment  personnel  mentioned  in  the  record.\"  Id.  at  235 \n(internal  quotation  marks  omitted.)  The  Court  concluded  that \n\"[b] y  resting  its  motion  on  generic  claims,  equally  applicable \nto  all  of  the  more  than  one  hundred  other  detainee  cases  now \npending  in  this  court,  the  government  effectively  'proposes \nunilaterally  to  determine  whether  information  is  protected.'\" \nId.  (citing  Bismullah,  501  F.3d  at  188). \nThird,  in  Arneziane  v.  Obama,  699  F.3d  488,  494-95  (D.C. \nCir.  2010)  (citing  Parhat,  532  F. 3d  at  8 53)  (internal  quotation \nmarks  omitted),  the  Court  set  out  a  two-part  test  to  govern  the \n-10-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01457-GK  Document 349  Filed 10/03/14  Page 11of29 \nsealing  of  judicial  records  in  detainee  cases:  the  Government \nmust  put  forth  \"at  a  minimum,  [1]  a  specific,  tailored  rationale \nfor  protecting  a  general  category  of  information,  and  [2]  a \nprecise  designation  of  each  particular  item  of  information  that \npurportedly  falls  within  the  category  described.'\"  The  Court \nobserved  that  \"the  narrower  the  category  for  which  the \ngovernment  seeks  protection,  the  more  likely  the  government's \nrationale  will  be  sufficiently  tailored[,]\"  although,  the \ngovernment  need  not  provide  \"a  specific  and  distinct  rationale \naddressed. to  each  detainee' s  situation.\"  Ameziane,  699  F. 3d  at \n495. \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA.  Whether  the  Qualified Right  of Access  to  Judicial \nRecords  Extends  to  Classified Documents \nThe  Court  is  well  aware,  as  the  Government  has  emphasized, \nthat  in  no  case  involving  Guantanamo  Bay  detainees  has  any  court \nordered  disclosure  of  classified  information  over  the \nGovernment's  opposition.  However  -- to  be  clear  -- that  does \nnot  mean  that  in  a  given  factual  situation  no  court  has  the \ndiscretion  to  do  so  if  warranted.  Quite  the  contrary.  Our  Court \nof  Appeals  has  stated  that  it  is  the  judiciary's  responsibility, \nwhen  ruling  on  an  issue  as  overwhelmingly  important  as \ndiminution  of  our  precious  First  Amendment  rights,  to  ensure \nthat  classification  of  the  items  in  question,  i.e.,  the  FCE \n-11-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01457-GK  Document 349  Filed 10/03/14  Page 12 of 29 \nvideos,  is  proper. 3  See  McGehee  v.  Casey,  718  F.2d  1137,  1148 \n(D.C.  Cir.  1983). \nFollowing  the  two-step  test  of  Press-Enterprise  II,  Judge \nHogan  in  Detainee  Lit.  I  first  determined  that  \"access  to  habeas \nproceedings  has  been  historically  available.\"  Detainee  Lit.  I, \n624  F.Supp.2d  at  35.  Recognizing  that  \"the  D.C.  Circuit  has  been \nsilent  on  the  issue,\"  Judge  Hogan  noted  that  \"other  Circuits \nhave  opined  and  uniformly  held  that  the  public  has  a  First \nAmendment  right  of  access  to  civil  proceedings  and  records,\"  Id. \nat  36,  and  concluded  that  \"[a]  petition  for  a  writ  of  habeas \ncorpus  is  a  civil  proceeding[,]\"  Id.  at  35  (citing  Fay  v.  Noia, \n372  U.S.  391,  423  (1963)). \nUnder  Press-Enterprise  II' s  second  prong,  the  Court  found \n\"that  'public  access  plays  a  significant  positive  role  in  the \nfunctioning'  of  these  habeas  proceedings.\"  Detainee  Lit.  I,  62 4 \nF.Supp.2d  at  36  (quoting  Press-Enterprise  II,  478  U.S.  at  8). \n\"Publicly  disclosing  the  factual  returns  [produced  in  the  habeas \nproceedings]  would  enlighten  the  citizenry  and  improve \n3  The  fact  the  judicial  records  sought  are  videotapes,  rather \nthan  written  documents,  does  not  affect  the  analysis.  See,  e.g., \nIn  re  ABC,  537  F.  Supp.  1168,  1170  n.4  (D.D.C.  1982)  (the  right \nof  access  \"extends  to  records  which  are  not  in  written  form,  for \nexample,  videotapes\");  cf.  United  States  v.  Graham,  257  F.3d \n143,  153-54  (2d  Cir.  2001)  (videotape  relied  upon  by  court \nsubject  to  common  law  access  right  even  though  not  admitted  into \nevidence);  Application  of  CBS,  Inc.,  828  F.2d  958  (2d  Cir.  1987) \n(common  law  access  right  applies  to  videotape  of  deposition \npresented  to  jury);  United  States  v.  Criden,  648  F.2d  814  (3d \nCir.  1981)  (same). \n-12-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01457-GK  Document 349  Filed 10/03/14  Page 13 of 29 \nperceptions  of  the  proceedings'  fairness.\"  Id.  at  37  (citing  New \nYork  Times  Co.  v.

Moreover,  \"[d]isclosing  the \nfactual  returns  to  the  public  would  also  benefit  both  parties. \nThe  government's  detention  decisions  would  gain  the \nlegitimacy  that  accompanies  transparency.\"  Detainee  Lit.  I,  62 4 \nF.Supp.2d  at  37. 4 \nRespondents  deny  that  the  qualified  right  of  access \nidentified  by  the  Court  in  Detainee  Lit.  I  extends  to  the \nvideotapes  at  issue  here.  They  contend,  first,  that  the  history \nof  access  to  habeas  corpus  proceedings  and  records  does  not \nextend  to  classified  information.  Second,  pointing  to  dicta  in \nDetainee  Lit.  I,  624  F.Supp.2d  at  37  (\"any  positive  role  would \nbe  severely  diminished  if  the  public  gains  access  to  classified \ninformation\"),  the  Government  argues  that  when  a  document  has \nbeen  deemed  classified  by  the  Executive  Branch,  that  fact  alone \nshould  bind  the  court  to  conclude  that  public  access  would  not \nplay  a  significant positive  role.  Resp'ts'  Opp'n  at  18-21. \n4  While  the  factual  returns  at  issue  in  Detainee  Lit.  I  were \nnot  classified,  the  Government  argued  that  t hey  should  have  been \ndeemed  \"protected\"  and  therefore  not  subject  to  public  access . \n624  F.Supp.2d  at  38. \n-13-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01457-GK  Document 349  Filed 10/03/14  Page 14 of 29 \nBy  applying  the  test  of  experience  and  logic  directly  to \nclassified  information,  the  Government  misreads  Press  Enterprise \n11.1  478  U.S.  at  8-9.  Courts  must  consider  the  history  and \nvirtues  of  access  to  particular  proceedings,  not  the  information \nthat  may  arise  during  those  proceedings.  See  Press-Enterprise  II \n478  U.S.  at  8-9  (comparing  the  history  and  virtues  of  open  jury \ntrials  with  the  necessary  \"secrecy  of  grand  jury  proceedings~ . \nOnce  the  right  of  access  to  a  proceeding  has  been  established, \ncourts  may  use  narrowly  tailored  measures  to  protect  compelling \ninterests,  like  the  safeguarding  of  sensitive  information.  See \nRobinson,  935  F.2d  at 290  (D.C.  Cir.  1991). \nIn  addition  to  misconstruing  Press-Enterprise  II,  the \nGovernment's  arguments,  if  accepted,  would  displace  the  Court's \npower  to  seal  its  own  record,  putting  that  authority  in  the \nGovernment's  hands  alone.  However,  the  Court  of  Appeals  in \nBusmillah,  501  F. 3d  at  188,  clearly  stated  that  \"[i] t  is  the \ncourt,  not  the  Government  that  has  discretion  to  seal  a  judicial \nrecord.\" \nThe  Fourth  Circuit,  in  In  re  Washington  Post  Co.,  807  F.2d \n3 8 3,  391-92  (4th  Cir.  1986)  concluded  that  although  the \nI \nExecutive  has  the  sole  authority  to  determine  what  information \nis  properly  classified  for  its  purposes,  only  the  judiciary  has \nthe  discretion  to  seal  or  unseal  a  judicial  record.  While  the \nCourt  adrni tted  to  being  \"troubled  by  the  risk  that \n. -14-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01457-GK  Document 349  Filed 10/03/14  Page 15 of 29 \ndisclosure  of  classified  information  could  endanger  the  lives  of \nboth  Americans  and  their  foreign  informants,  [it  was]  equally \ntroubled  by  the  notion  that  the  judiciary  should  abdicate  its \ndecision-making  responsibility  to  the  executive  branch  whenever \nnational  security  concerns  are  present.  History  teaches  us  how \neasily  the  spectre  of  a  threat  to  'national  security'  may  be \nused  to  justify  a  wide  variety  of  repressive  government  actions. \nA  blind  acceptance  by  the  courts  of  the  government's  insistence \non  the  need  for  secrecy,  without  notice  to  others,  without \nargument,  and  without  a  statement  of  reasons,  would \nimpermissibly  compromise  the  independence  of  the  judiciary  and \nopen  the  door  to  possible  abuse.\"  Id.  (emphasis  added). \nB.  Application  of  Press  Enterprise  II  and  Parhat  to  the \nTwenty-Eight Video  Tapes \nThe  Government  identifies  five  means  by  which  release  of \nthe  videotapes  would  give  rise  to  a  substantial  probability  of \nharm  to  a  compelling  interest:  ( 1)  the  videos  could  aid  the \ndevelopment  of  countermeasures  to  FCEs;  ( 2)  depictions  of  camp \ninfrastructure  in  the  videos  could  allow  detainees  or  others  to \ndisrupt  the  camp;  ( 3)  detainees  might  respond  to  release  of  the \nvideos  by  deliberately  trying  to  behave  in  such  a  way  that \nnecessitates  greater  use  of  the  FCEs;  (4)  the  videos  could \n\"inflame  Muslim  sensitivities  overseas\"  or  be  used  as \npropaganda;  (5)  release  of  the  videotapes  could  subject  Mr. \n-15-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01457-GK  Document 349  Filed 10/03/14  Page 16 of 29 \nDhiab  to  \"public  curiosity\"  and  \"could  affect  the  practice  of \nother  states  in  this  regard,  which  would  in  turn  dilute \nprotections  afforded  U.S.  service  personnel  in  ongoing  overseas \ncontingency  operations  and  future  conflicts.\"  Resp'ts'  Opp'n  at \n27. \n1.  The  Government's  Burden \nIn  order  to  seal  the  judicial  record  and  defeat  the \npublic's  qualified  right  of  access,  the  Government  carries  a \nheavy  burden.  It  must  put  forth  \"at  a  minimum,  [ 1]  a  specific, \ntailored  rationale  for  protecting  a  general  category  of \ninformation,  and  [ 2]  a  precise  designation  of  each  particular \ni tern  of  information  that  purportedly  falls  within  the  category \ndescribed.\"  Ameziane,  69 9  F. 3d  at  4 94-95  (citing  Parhat,  532 \nF. 3d  at  853)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  The  reasons  it \ngives  for  protecting  the  information  must  demonstrate  a \n\"substantial  probability  of  harm\"  to  an  \"overriding  interest.\" \nPress-Enterprise  II,  478  U.S.  at  14. \nAs  already  noted,  the  fact  that  the  Government  has \nunilaterally  deemed  information  classified  is  not  sufficient  to \ndefeat  the  public's  right.  See  Bismullah,  501  F. 3d  at  188.  Even \nwhen  the  Government's  reasons  for  classification  point  to  a \nsubstantial  probability  of  harm,  the  Court  must  assure  itself \nthat  the  justifications  given  are  \"rational  and  plausible.\"  See \nMcGehee,  718  F.2d  at  1149.  The  Government  must  provide  \"reasoned \n-16-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01457-GK  Document 349  Filed 10/03/14  Page 17 of 29 \nand  detailed  explanations\"  and  courts  \"must  satisfy \nthemselves  that  the  [~overnment]  in  fact  had  good  reason \nto  classify.\"  Id.  at  1148-49. \nIn  short,  it  is  our  responsibility,  as  judges,  as  part  of \nour  obligation  under  the  Constitution,  to  ensure  that  any \nefforts  to  limit  our  First  Amendment  protections  are  scrutinized \nwith  the  greatest  of  care.  That  responsibility  can  not  be \nignored  or  abdicated. \nTherefore,  when  the  sealed  facts  are  already  public, \nmaintaining  documents  under  seal  is  only  appropriate  when, \ndespite  what  the  public  already  knows,  the  documents'  release \nwould  still  give  rise  to  a  substantial  probability  of  harm.  See \nRobinson,  935  F.2d  at  291-92  (unsealing  a  plea  agreement  because \nGovernment's  concerns  that  \"release  of  a  plea  agreement  may \nthreaten  an  ongoing  criminal  investigation~  or  the  safety  of  the \ndefendant  and  his  family\"  were  unfounded  when  \"the  fact  that  the \nplea  agreement  was  entered  into  in  exchange  for  McWilliams' \ncooperation  was  already  within  the  public  knowledge.\");  see  also \nIn  re  The  Herald  Co.,  73.4  F.2d  93,  101  (2d  Cir.1984)  (\"Though \nthe  basis  for  apprehending  harm  to  the  defendant  is  apparent, \nthe  record  raises  a  question  as  to  whether  the  information \nsought  to  be  kept  confidential  has  already  been  given  sufficient \npublic  exposure  to  preclude  a  closure  order  on  this  account.\"). \n-17-\n\n.

Accordingly,  the \nGovernment  cannot  meet  its  burden  by  simply  asserting  that \ninformation  regarding  the  infrastructure  of  the  camp  is  critical \nto  national  security  when  it  has  already  released  the  very  same \ninformation  to  the  public.  Ameziane,  69 9  F. 3d  at  4 95  requires \nthe  Government  to  provide  \"a  specific,  tailored  rationale  for \nprotecting  a  general  category  of  information\"  and  identify  \"each \nparticular  item  of  information  that  purportedly  falls  within  the \ncategory.\"  It has  failed  to  do  so. \nc.  Use  of  the Videos  as  Propaganda \nParagraphs  18,  21,  22,  23,  and  24  all  warn  that  the  publi~ \nrelease  of  FCE  and  enteral  feeding  \"videos,\"  not  necessarily  Mr. \nDhiab' s  videos,  would  prove  useful  as  propaganda  for  Al  Qaeda \nand  its  affiliates  and  could  increase  anti-American  sentiment, \nthereby  placing  the  lives  of  United  States  service  members  at \nrisk. \nAs  we  have  seen  in  recent  years,  terrorists  of  all  stripes \nand  ideologies  have  long  been  attempting  to  create  anti-American \nsentiment  abroad  by  using  publications  as  recruiting  material \nfor  new  members. \nHowever,  courts  have  long  rejected  arguments  to  abridge  the \nFirst  Amendment  that  would  give  rise  to  a  \"heckler's  veto.\" \nBrown  v.

Detainee  Behavior  that  Would  Require  More \nFCEs \nThe  Government  also  contends  that  if  any  videotapes  of  FCEs \nwere  to  be  released,  other  prisoners  would  be  more  likely  to \nengage  in  disruptive  behavior,  endangering  themselves, \nGuantanamo  Bay  staff  and,  eventually,  national  security.

This  justification \nfor  denying  the  public's  First  Amendment  right  of  access  to \njudicial  records  fails  to  show  a  substantial  probability  of \nharm. \nParagraph  18  of  RDML  Butler's  Declaration  claims  that  \"if \nvideo  recordings  of  forced  cell  extractions\"  were  released  to \nthe  public,  detainees  would  become  aware  of  this  and  react  by \n14  Congress  subsequently  passed  legislation  that  temporarily \nexempted  the  photos  at  issue  in  ACLU  from  disclosure  under  the \nFreedom  of  Information  Act.

They  ask \nonly  to  unseal  those  tapes  that  compose  the  particular  record \nfor  this  proceeding.  Nothing  in  this  Court's  decision  would  give \nGuantanamo  Bay  detainees  the  unilateral  right  to  publicize \nvideos  of  their own  FCEs. \ne.  Public  Curiosity  and  International \nReputation \nWhat  the  Government  means  when  it worries  that  \"any  portion \nof  the  videotapes  containing  an  image  of  the  Petitioner  could \nexpose  him  to  public  curiosity\"  is  not  immediately  apparent. \nOpp'n  at  28.  Mr.  Dhiab  has  been  clear  that  he  wishes  release  of \nthe  videotapes.  It  is  hard  to  believe  that  Mr.  Dhiab  -- whose \nparticular  videos  are  the  only  ones  at  issue  would  be \noffended  or  distressed  by  knowing  that  the  public  was  able  to \nview  his  treatment  at  Guantanamo  Bay.  Given  the  extensive \npublicity  about  his  situation,  and  the  fact  that  on  any  number \nof  occasions  hi s  lawyers  ha.ve  talked  to  members  of  the  press  to \ndescribe  his  plight,  the  Government's  concern  that  he  would  be \nharmed  in  any  way  by  release  of  the  videos  is not  plausible. \n-27-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01457-GK  Document 349  Filed 10/03/14  Page 28 of 29 \nRear  Admiral  Butler  claims  in  Paragraph  20  that  release  of \n\"videos,  of  detainees  subject  to  forced  cell  extraction  or \nenteral  feeding  would  raise  serious  questions  by  United  States \nallies  and  partners  and  others  in  the  international  community  as \nto  whether  the  United  States  is  acting  in  accordance\"  with  what \nhe  states  is  our  country's  \"longstanding  policy  to  protect \ndetainees  from  public  curiosity,  consistent  with  the  Geneva \nConventions.\" \nThe  Government's  claim,  if  accepted,  would  turn  the  Third \nGeneva  Convention  on  its  head.  Rather  than  a  source  of  rights  to \nhumane  treatment,  Article  13  would  become  a  means  to  shield  from \npublic  view  treatment  that  Mr.  Dhiab  (and  undoubtedly  other \ndetainees)  believe  to  be  inhumane.

Such  protection,  however,  does  not  require \ncompl ete  sealing  of  t he  videotapes.  Adequate  protection  can  be \nprovided  by  appropriate  audio  and  visual  edits,  for  exampl e, \nscreening  names  and  voices,  blurring  fac,es  and  identifying \nportions  of  uniforms,  and  blacking-out  written  materials  on \nwalls.  The  Government's  concerns  regarding  the  possibility  of \ncovert  communications  through  the  released  videos  can  l ikewise \nbe  so  addressed.  Complete  closure  is  only  appropriate  when  there \nare  no  reasonable  alternatives.  Robinson,  935  F. 2d  at  2 90.  That \nis  not  the  case  here. \nIV.
