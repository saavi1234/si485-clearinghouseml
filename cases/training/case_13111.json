    "summary": "<p>For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA matters, see our <a href=\"../../../../search/case/?special_collection=5659&amp;ordering=-summary_approved_date\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">special collection</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On November 18, 2013, the Director of National Intelligence authorized the declassification and public release of numerous orders approving the National Security Agency's (\"NSA\") so-called \"Bulk Internet Metadata Program\" under Section 402 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (\"FISA\"), commonly referred to as the Pen Register and Trap and Trace (PR/TT) provision, or Section 214 of the USA PATRIOT Act. On August 11, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence authorized another declassification and public release of additional documents regarding the now-discontinued NSA Bulk Electronic Communications Metadata Program pursuant to Section 402 of FISA.</p>\r\n<p>Under the program, the NSA collected records from large telecommunication companies about electronic communications metadata. These records included the \"to,\" \"from,\" \"cc,\" and \"bcc\" lines of an email and the email's time and date. The program did not authorize the collection of content of any electronic communications. Once collected, the records were stored for several years and were authorized to be queried, used, and disseminated only in accordance with \"minimization rules\" proposed by the government and approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\"). The most basic aspect of the minimization rules was that the metadata records were to be queried only when there was a reasonable suspicion, based on specific and articulated facts, that the identifier used as the basis for the query was associated with specified foreign terrorist organizations.</p>\r\n<p>NSA collection of email metadata began in 2001, as part of the \"President's Surveillance Program.\" Apparently the government took the position that internet metadata could be collected lawfully without court order because the NSA did not actually \"acquire\" communications until particular items were selected for review, after they showed up via query. But after Department of Justice lawyers raised objections to this theory, and accordingly to the program's legality, the Attorney General sought judicial ratification of the internet metadata program under the FISA pen/trap provisions, and the FISA Court blessed it in an order dated July 14, 2004. Except for a brief period in 2009, the FISC reauthorized the program approximately every 90 days until the Obama administration discontinued it in 2011.</p>\r\n<p>As of April 2014, only three FISC opinions and four FISC orders related to the internet metadata collections program have been released. All the opinions and orders have been significantly redacted. They nonetheless explain a good deal about how the program worked.The volume of material collected was \"enormous\" from its beginning, as the first of these opinions explains. At the start, the government aimed \"to build a meta data archive that will be, in relative terms, richly populated with [redacted] related communications.\" As the Court reported the government's initial intentions, \"[s]ome proportion of these communications-less than half, but still a huge number in absolute terms-can be expected to be communications [redacted] who bear no relation to [redacted].\" In 2009 or 2010, however, the government \"in comparison with prior dockets, [sought] authority to acquire a much larger volume of metadata at a greatly expanded range of facilities.\" The growth in volume and scope included extending collection beyond the \"streams of data with a relatively high concentration of Foreign Power communications\" that had previously been the focus. Until the program ended, in 2011, the pen/trap bulk collection began to reach \"electronic communications, the vast majority of which, viewed individually, are not relevant to the counterterrorism purpose of the collection, and many of which involve United States persons.\"</p>\r\n<p>The FISC initially approved the internet metadata program in 2004 in an opinion by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly under <a href=\"../../../../case/13107/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">docket PR-TT [redacted]</a>. After allowing the authorization to expire in the fall 2009, the government worked on addressing the compliance issues that had plagued the program.</p>\r\n<p>The next ruling that has been publicly released was issued in July 2010 by FISC Judge John D. Bates. In the 117-page opinion and the primary order, Judge Bates granted the government's application to renew the program in part and denied it in part. Prior to this July 2010 application, the government had elected to allow the authorization for the program to expire for several months. Judge Walton had directed the government not to access or transfer the information previously obtained because of some of it had been obtained without authorization. The compliance issues were discussed in <a href=\"../../../../case/14114/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FISA Docket PR-TT ---- (Walton, J.) (February 2009)</a>, <a href=\"../../../../case/14116/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FISA Docket PR-TT ---- (Walton, J.) (May 2009)</a>, <a href=\"../../../../case/13109/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FISA Docket PR-TT ---- (Walton, J.) (June 2009),</a> and <a href=\"../../../../case/14118/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FISA Docket PR-TT ---- (Walton, J.) (October 2009)</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The compliance issues in the PR/TT program were similar to those in the bulk telephony metadata collection program, and FISC Judge Reggie Walton ordered a review of both programs in March 2009. See <a href=\"../../../../case/13073/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FISA Docket 08-13</a>. This application differed from previous applications because the government sought authorization to query and use information previously obtained by the NSA, regardless of whether the FISC had authorized its collection under prior PR/TT orders. Along with the application, the government submitted a Memorandum of Law and Fact in Support of the application. The government submitted a Declaration of General Keith B. Alexander, Director of the NSA, in support of the application.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the government submitted \"Exhibit D\" in support of the application. Exhibit D was correspondence from the government to the Court responding to certain factual and/or legal inquiries made by Judge Bates regarding the government's proposed application. Three letters in response to the Court's questions concerning the Internet Metadata Collection Program have been released. While much of the first letter has been redacted, it does discuss storing, accessing, and querying the metadata once it has been collected. All of the content of the second letter has been redacted. Finally, the third letter discusses tracking query results and the dissemination of intelligence reports. The government also addresses its request for a legal principle that would permit the government to access and use the over-collected data.</p>\r\n<p>In his opinion and order, Judge Bates noted that previous orders authorizing the internet metadata program included \"important constants\": each order limited the collection to certain categories of metadata; analysts were required to limit queries by the reasonable articulable suspicion standard; and the NSA was limited in how and to whom information was disseminated. However, this application \"acknowledges that the NSA exceeded the scope of authorized acquisition continuously during the more than [redacted] years of acquisition under these orders.\"</p>\r\n<p>Judge Bates then reviewed Judge Kollar-Kotelly's 2004 opinion initially authorizing the program and the rationale supporting her opinion, <a href=\"../../../../case/13107/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FISA Docket PR-TT ---- (Kollar-Kotelly, J) (2004)</a>. During that initial period of authorization, the government had disclosed that the NSA had exceeded the scope of what the government had requested and the FISC had approved. The unauthorized collection did not result from technical difficulties or malfunction, but from a failure of NSA officials to communicate minimization procedures and other safeguard requirements. Judge Kollar-Kotelly renewed the authority for the program, but implemented additional safeguard requirements including random spot checks by the NSA Office of General Counsel for compliance. However, as discussed previously, more compliance issues surfaced, involving (1) accessing of metadata; (2) disclosure of query results and information derived therefrom; and (3) overcollection.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Bates ultimately held that the proposed collection fell within statutory requirements, but that the government could not access data from previously-conducted unauthorized collection. Judge Bates also ordered oversight and reporting: the NSA Office of General Counsel and Office of the Director of Compliance had to ensure proper training for NSA personnel, and the NSA had to submit a report every 30 days describing any instances in which the NSA shared information derived from the PR/TT program with anyone outside the NSA.</p>\r\n<p>After Judge Bates granted authorization, the government submitted two letters to confirm their understanding of the issues relating to the authorization. Although mostly redacted, the first letter identified five initial issues that the government needed confirmation of its understanding of the authorization as it applied to the five issues. The second letter provided follow up information for issue four in the first letter. The rest of the letter has not been released. These are the last FISC documents related to the internet metadata program released, at least so far.</p>\r\n<p>The final documents in this Clearinghouse entry are memoranda from the NSA's Office of Inspector General, which show that the program was halted in winter 2011. We do not have court documents explaining the events, but it is clear that the NSA shut down its internet metadata program in the winter of 2011, after allowing its final FISC authorization to expire. We know this from two memos the NSA Office of Inspector General circulated within the NSA. In the first memo, the IG's Office announced an audit to test whether adequate controls ensured the NSA's compliance with key terms of the FISC order for PR-TT devices. In the second memo, the IG's Office suspended that audit after the government allowed the authorization for the Internet Metadata Collection Program to expire. In November 2015, the New York Times reported that the NSA ended the program because it was able to obtain the same information with less regulation. It could collect bulk data&mdash;including U.S. domestic data&mdash;in other countries, tapping into fiber optic cables abroad. (The rule against IC analysis of Americans' data collected abroad was changed in 2010). And/or it could use the authority of Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which permits warrantless surveillance that targets specific noncitizens abroad, including their new or stored emails to or from Americans. This reporting was based on FOIA-obtained documents.</p>",

For the reasons explained herein, the \ngovernment's application will be granted in part and denied in part. \nI.  History of Bulk PR/TT Acquisitions Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nFro  , NSA was authorized, under a series of FISC \norders under the PR/TT provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (PISA), 50 \nU.S.C. §§ 1841-1846, to engage in the bulk acquisition of specified categories of metadata about \nInternet communications.  Although the specific terms of authorization under those orders varied \nover time, there were important constants.  Notably, each order limited the authorized acquisition \nto  categories of metadata. 2  As detailed herein, the government acknowledges that \n2 \n\nTOP \n~ECRET,~'COI)i'll!NThlOR:CON,NOFOR~ \nNSA exceeded the scope of authorized acquisition continuously during the more than  ears \nof acquisition under these orders. \nIn addition, each order authorized NSA analysts to access the acquired metadata only \nthrough queries based on validated \"seed\" accounts, i.e., Internet accounts for which there was a \nreasonable articulable suspicion (\"RAS\") that they were associated with a targeted international \nterrorist group; for accounts used by U.S. persons, RAS could not be based solely on activities \nprotected by the First Amendment.3  The results of such queries provided analysts with \ninformation about the  of contacts and usage for a seed account, as reflected in the \ncollected metadata, which in turn could help analysts identify previously unknown accounts or \npersons affiliated with a targeted terrorist group.  See  Opinion at 41-45.  Finally, \neach bulk PR/TT order included a requirement that NSA could disseminate U.S. person \ninformation to other agencies only upon a determination by a designated NSA official that it is \nrelated to counterterrorism information and is necessary to understand the counterterrorism \ninformation or to assess its importance.4 \nTOP \n~~CRETNCOMTNT#ORCON,NOFORN \n3 \n\nTOP ~ECllE'f'liCOMINT/fORCON,NOFOR.\"f\\t \nThe current application relies on this prior framework, but also seeks to expand \nauthorization in ways that test the limits of what the applicable FISA provisions will bear.  It also \nraises issues that are closely related to serious compliance problems that have characterized the \ngovernment's implementation of prior FISC orders.  It is therefore helpful at the outset to \nsummarize both the underlying rationale of the prior authorizations and the government's \nfrequent failures to comply with their terms. \nA.  Initial Approval \nThe first application for a bulk PRITT authorization was granted by the Honorable \nColleen Kollar-Kotelly in  Judge Kollar-Kotelly authorized PRITT surveillance \nOpinion at 72-80.5  When known, the particular customers \nwere identified in the Court's order pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1842(d)(2)(A)(ii). \nOpinion at 22-23. \nThe  Opinion authorized the acquisition o- categories of metadata: \nTOP SECRETHCO~HNT/fORCON,NOFOILl\\t \n4 \n\nTOP gECRET/.fCOMJNTNORCON,NOFORN \nTOP 8ECRBT//C01\\HNTHORCON,NOFORN \n5 \n\nTOP 8ECRBTHCO~HNTHORCON,NOFORN \nJudge Kollar-Kotelly found that the proposed collection of information within Categories \ncomported with the applicable statutory definitions of \"pen register\" and \"trap \nand trace device,\"7 id. at 13-17, and with the Fourth Amendment, id. at 58-61. \nOpinion stated the Court's understanding that the application sought \nauthority to obtain onl~categories of information and specified that it authorized \"only \nId. at 11 (emphasis in \noriginal).  Each subsequent bulk PRITT order adopted as its rationale the analysis and \nconclusions set out in the  Opinion.8 \n7  See 18 U.S.C. § 3127(3), ( 4).  These definitions are more fully discussed at pages 25-\n26, infra. \n8  See~' Docket No. PRITT-Primary Order issued on  at 5; Docket \n(continued ... ) \nTOP S~CRETh'COM:INTHORCON,NOFORN \n6 \n\nTOP S~Cltt/T/iCOMINTHORCON,NOFORl\\J \nIt was anticipated that the authorized PR/TT surveillance would \"encompass \nOpinion at 39-40 (internal quotations omitted). \nPursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(2), the initial application included a certification that the \ninformation likely to be obtained was relevant to an ongoing investigation to protect against \ninternational terrorism, which was not being conducted solely upon the basis of activities \nprotected by the First Amendment.  Docket No. PR/TT  Application filed \n9  Bulk PR/TT surveillance was first a  roved in su  ort of investi  ations of_ \nand the collected \n•  • • \n• \nTOP 8ECRETHC0l'.HNTHORCON,NOFORN \n7 \n\nTOP \nSECRETHCO~HNTHORCON,NOFOR~ \nApplication\"), at 26.10  Judge Kollar-Kotelly found that the sweeping and non-\ntargeted scope of the proposed acquisition was consistent with this certification of relevance. \nOpinion at 49.  In making this finding, the Court relied on several factors, \nincluding NSA's efforts \"to build a meta data archive that will be, in relative terms, richly \npopulated with  communications,\" at least as compared with the entire universe \nof Internet communications,  Opinion at 47,11 and the presence of \"safeguards\" \nproposed by the government \"to ensure that the information collected will not be used for \nunrelated purposes,\" id. at 27, thereby protecting \"the continued validity of the certification of \nrelevance,\" id. at 70.  These safeguards importantly included both the limitation that NSA \n10  The government argued that \"FISA prohibits the Court from engaging in any \nsubstantive review ofthis certification,\" and that \"the Court's exclusive function\" was \"to verify \nthat it contains the words required\" by the statute.  Opinion at 26.  The Court did \nnot find such arguments persuasive.  Id.  However, because the government had in fact provided \na detailed explanation of the basis for the certification, the Court did not \"decide whether it \nwould be obliged to accept the applicant's certification without any explanation of its basis\" and \ninstead \"assume[ d] for purposes of this case that it may and should consider the basis\" of the \ncertification ofrelevance.  Id. at 27-28. \n8 \n\nTOP SRCRETHCOflfHNTHORCON,NOFORN \nanalysts could access the bulk metadata only on the basis of RAS-approved queries, id. at 42-43, \n56-58, and the rule governing dissemination of U.S. person information outside ofNSA, id. at \n85. \nHowever, the finding of relevance most crucially depended on the conclusion that \"the \nproposed bulk collection ... is necessary for NSA to employ ... analytic tools [that] are likely to \ngenerate useful investigative leads for ongoing efforts by the [Federal Bureau oflnvestigation \n(FBI)] (and other agencies) to identify and trac  Id. at 48. \nConsequently, \"the collection of both a huge volume and high percentage of unrelated \ncommunications ... is necessary to identify the much smaller number o \nII \nsuch that the entire mass of collected metadata is relevant to investigating \naffiliated persons.  Id. at 48-49; see also id. at 53-54 (relying on government's \nexplanation why bulk collection is \"necessary to identify and monitor \nwhose Internet communications would otherwise go undetected in the huge streams o \ncommunications\"). \nB.  First Disclosure of Overcollection \nDuring the initial period of authorization, the government disclosed that NSA's \nacquisitions had exceeded the scope of what the government had requested and the FISC had \napproved.  Insofar as it is instructive regarding the separate form of overcollection that has led \ndirectly to the current application, this prior episode is surnrnarized here. \nTOP 8RCRRTHCHMJNTHORCON,NOFO\"Ri\"'\\f \n9 \n\nTOP SECRE'f'HCOl\\HNTh'OR:COJN,JNOlfORN \nOn  the government provided written notice to the FISC that it had \nexceeded the scope of authorized collection  Docket No. PRITT  Notice \nof Compliance Incidents, filed on  On the same day, Judge Kollar-Kotelly ordered \nthe government to provide additional information about this non-compliance, including a \"full \ndescription of the scope, nature, and circumstances of any unauthorized collection' \nDocket No. PRITT  Order Regarding Disclosed Violations Involving \nOrder\"), at 6.  The government made an \nOrder in the form of a Declaration of \nfiled in Docket No. PRITT-n \n-Deel.\"), and a fuller response in the form of a Declaration o \nfiled in Docket No. PRITT.o \n(\"  Deel.\"). \nAs described by the government, the unauthorized collection resulted from failures to \nin the manner required.  Deel. at 8-11.12  By the \ngovernment's account, the lack ofrequire  id not result from technical difficulty or \nmalfunction, but rather from a failure of \"those NSA officials who understood in detail the \nrequirements of the  Opinion] ... to communicate those requirements effectively \nTOP S)i;C~T//COMIJNTH'ORCON,NOFOR\"\"f \n10 \n\nTOP S:iECRET//COit.HNTHORCON,NOFORN \nto the  ... who were directly responsible\" for implementation. \nId. at 5.  The government assessed the violations to have been caused by \"poor management, lack \nof involvement by compliance officials, and lack of internal verification procedures - not by bad \nfaith.\"  Id. at 7. \nThe Court had specifically directed the government to explain whether this unauthorized \ncollection involved the acquisition of information other than the approved Categories \nrder at 7.  In response, the Deputy Secretary of Defense stated that the \n\"Director ofNSA has informed me that at no time did NSA collect any category of information \nII \n. . .  other than the  categories of meta data\" approved in the  Opinion, but also \nnoted that the NSA's Inspector General had not completed his assessment of this issue. -\nDeel. at 21. 13  As discussed below, this assurance turned out to be untrue. \nRegarding the information obtained through unauthorized collection, the Court ordered \nthe government to describe whether it \"has been, or can be, segregated from information that \nNSA was authorized to collect,\" \"how the government proposes to dispose of' it, and \"how the \ngovernment proposes to ensure that [it] is not included ... in applications presented to this \nCourt.\"  Order at 7-8.  In response, the government stated that, while it was not \nsical \npossibility of our hav. \n-Docket Nos. \nTOP SECRETHCOMINTHORCON,NOFORN \n11 \n\nTOP 8ECRET//CO~UNT//ORCON,NOFORN \nfeasible to segregate authorized collection from unauthorized collection on an item-by-item \nbasis, NSA had eliminated access to the database that contained the entire set of metadata, and \nrepopulated the databases used by analysts to run queries so that they only contained information \nthat had not been involved in the unauthorized collection. \neel. at 25-26.  The government asserted that, after taking these actions, NSA was \n\"making queries against a database that contain[ ed] only meta data that NSA was authorized to \ncollect.\"  Id. at 26.  As to information disseminated outside ofNSA, the government reported that \nit had reviewed disseminated NSA reports and concluded that just one report was potentially \nbased on improperly collected information.  Deel. at 9-10.  NSA cancelled \nthis report and confirmed that the recipient agencies had purged it from their records.  Id.  at 11. \nThe initial bulk PRITT authorization granted by th  Opinion was set to \nexpue on  shortly after the government had disclosed this unauthorized \ncollection.  On that date, Judge Kollar-Kotelly granted an application for continued bulk PRITT \nacquisition; however, in that application, the government only requested authorization for \nacquisitio~that had not been subject to the \nDocket No. PRITT  Application filed on  pplication\"), at 9-\n15; Primary Order issued o  at 2-5.14  The government represented that the PRITT \nhad \"fully complied with the orders of the Court.\" \n14  Subsequent applications and orders followed the same approach.  See, ~o. \nPR/TT-Application filed on - at 9-13; Primary Order issued on-at \n2-5. \nTOP SECRET//COMJNT//OR:CON,~OFORN \n12 \n\nTOP SECRETHCOl\\oHNT//OR:CON,NOFORN \nDeclaration of  at 2-3 (Exhibit C to  Application).  The government \nalso described in that application new oversight mechanisms to ensure against future \novercollection.  Application at 8-9.  These included a requirement that, \"at least \ntwice during the 90-day authorized period of surveillance,\" NSA' s Office of General Counsel \n(NSA OGC) \"will conduct random spot checks  to ensure that \nfunctioning as authorized by the Court.  Such spot checks will require an examination of a \nsample of data.\"  Id. at 9.  The Court adopted this requirement in its orders granting the \napplication, as well as in subsequent orders for bulk PR/TT surveillance. 15 \nC.  Overcollection Disclosed in. \nIn December-the government reported to the FISC a separate case of unauthorized \ncollection, which it attributed to a typographical error in how a prior application and resulting \norders had described communications \nPR/T~ Verified Motion for an Amended Order filed on  at 4-6.  The \ngovernment sought a nunc pro tune correction of the typographical error in the prior orders, \nwhich would have effectively approved two months of unauthorized collection.  Id. at 7.

Id. \nThe FISC approved prospective collection  on the terms requested by the \ngovernment when it granted a renewal application  See Docket No. PRITT \n-Primary Order issued on  at 5-6.  However, the FISC withheld nunc pro \ntune relief for the previously collected information, and NSA removed from its systems all data \nSee Docket \nD.  Non-Compliance Disclosed -\nThe next relevant compliance problems surfaced inm and involved three general \nsubjects: (1) accessing of metadata; (2) disclosure of query results and information derived \ntherefrom; and (3) overcollection.  These compliance disclosures generally coincided with \nrevelations about similar problems under a separate line ofFISC orders providing for NSA's \nbulk acquisition of metadata for telephone communications pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1861.16 \n1.  Accessing Metadata \nOn January-the government disclosed that NSA had regularly accessed the bulk \ntelephone metadata using a form of automated querying based on telephone numbers that had not \nbeen approved under the RAS standard.  See Docket No. BR 08-13, Order Regarding \n16  The Section 1861 orders, like the bulk PRITT orders, permit NSA analysts to access \nthe bulk telephone met d t  1  thr  ! h I  b  d  RAS  I I  ved telephone numbers. \nSee,~, Docket No.  I , at 7-10. \nTOP ~ECRET,L/COMJNT//ORCON,NOFOR.l\\f \n14 \n\nTOP ~ECRET//COJ.\\UNT//OR:CON,NOFORN \nPreliminary Notice of Compliance Incident Dated  issued on  at 2-3. \nThe Honorable Reggie B. Walton of this Court ordered the government to verify that access to \nthe bulk PR/TT metadata complied with comparable restrictions, noting \"the similarity between \nthe querying practices and requirements employed\" in both contexts.  See Docket No. PR/TTlll \n-rder issued on  at 1. \nIn response, the government reported that it had identified, and discontinued, a non-\nautomated querying practice for PR/TT metadata that it had concluded was non-compliant with \nthe required RAS approval process.  See Docket No. PR/TT-Government's Response to \nthe Court's Order Dated  filed on  at 2-6 \nResponse\").17  The government'  Response also described additional oversight and \n17  This practice involved an analyst running a query using as a seed \"a U.S.-based e-mail \naccount\" that had been in direct contact with a properly va ·  ccount, but had not itself \nbeen properly validated under the RAS approval process.  se at 2-3.  When \nhe granted renewed authorization for bulk PR/TT surveillance on  , Judge Walton \nordered the government not to resume this  ractice without prior Court approval.  See Docket \nNo. PR/TT-Primary Order issued  at 10. \nIn its response, the government also described an automated means of querying, which it · \nregarded as consistent with the applicable PR/TT orders.

See 50 \nU.S.C. § 1842(d)(l).  Some of these requirements are plainly met: the government has submitted \nto a judge of the FISC a written application that has been approved by the Attorney General (who \nis also the applicant).  See ~pplication at 1, 20; 50 U.S.C. § 1842(a)(l), (b)(l), (c). \nThe application identifies the Federal officer seeking to use the PR/TT devices covered by it as \nGeneral Keith B. Alexander, the Director ofNSA, who has also verified the application pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1746 in lieu of an oath or affirmation.  See  plication at 5, 18; 50 \nU.S.C. § 1842(b), (c)(l). \nIn other respects, however, the Court's review of this application is not nearly so \nstraightforward.  As a crucial threshold matter, there are substantial questions about whether \nsome aspects of the proposed collection are properly regarded as involving the use of PR/TT \ndevices.  There are also noteworthy issues regarding the certification of relevance pursuant to \nSection 1842(c)(2) and the specifications that the order must include under Section \n1842( d)(2)(A), as well as post-acquisition concerns regarding the procedures for handling the \nmetadata.  The Court's resolution of these issues is set out below. \nTOP ~~CRET/./CO~UNT/./ORCON,NOFOR.1'J \n24 \n\nTOP SECR.li:T.L/COMTNTt/ORCON,NOFOR'f \nIn the remainder of this Opinion, the Court will first consider whether the proposed \ncollection involves the use of a PR/TT device within the meaning of the applicable statutory \ndefinitions, and whether the data that the government seeks to collect consists of information that \nmay properly be acquired by such a device.  Next, the Court will consider whether the \napplication satisfies the statutory relevance standard and contains all the necessary elements.  The \nCourt will then address the procedures and restrictions proposed by the government for the \nretention, use, and dissemination of the information that is collected.  Finally, the Court will \nconsider the government's request for permission to use all previously-collected data, including \ninformation falling outside the scope of the Court's prior authorizations. \nII.  The Proposed Collection, as Modified Herein, Involves the Installation and Use of PRITT \nDevices \nA.  The Applicable Statutory Definitions \nFor purposes of 50 U.S.C. §§ 1841-1846, FISA adopts the definitions of \"pen register\" \nand \"trap and trace device\" set out in 18 U.S.C. § 3127.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1841(2).  Section 3127 \nprovides the following definitions: \n(3) the term \"pen register\" means a device or process which records or decodes \ndialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument \nor facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted, \nprovided, however, that such information shall not include the contents of any \n.  .  [24] \ncommumcat10n ... ; \n24 \nThe definition excludes any device or process used by communications providers or \ncustomers for certain billing-related purposes or \"for cost accounting or other like purposes in the \nordinary course of business.\"  § 3127(3).  These exclusions are not pertinent to this case. \n\"fOf SECRE'I'HC0Pf'HNTHORCON,NOFOR..1'T \n25 \n\nTOP SECRETHCOJ\\HNTNORCON,NOFORN \n( 4) the term \"trap and trace device\" means a device or process which captures the \nincoming electronic or other impulses which identify the originating number or \nother dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information reasonably likely to \nidentify the source of a wire or electronic communication, provided, however, that \nsuch information shall not include the contents of any communication. \nThese definitions employ three other terms - \"electronic communication,\" \"wire \ncommunication,\" and \"contents\" - that are themselves governed by statutory definitions \"set \nforth for such terms in section 2510\" of title 18.  18 U.S.C. § 3127(1).  Section 2510 defines \nthese terms as follows: \n(1) \"Electronic communication\" is defined as: \nany transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any \nnature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, \nphotoelectronic or photooptical system that affects interstate or foreign commerce, \nbut does not include - (A) any wire or oral communication.[25\n] \n18 U.S.C. § 2510(12). \n(2) \"Wire communication\" is defined as: \nany aural transfer made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the \ntransmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection \nbetween the point of origin and the point of reception ... furnished or operated by \nany person engaged in providing or operating such facilities for the transmission \nof interstate or foreign communications or communications affecting interstate or \nforeign commerce. \nu.s.c. \n18  § 2510(1). \n25 The other exclusions to this definition at Section 251O(l2)(B)-(D) are not relevant to \nthis case. \nTOP SECRETHCOMJNT,~'ORCON,NOFOR.cTu.( \n26 \n\nTOP SECRETHCO~HNT/fORCON,NOFORN \n(3) \"Contents\" is defined to \"include[] any information concerning the substance, purport, \nor meaning\" of a \"wire, oral, or electronic communication.\"  18 U.S.C. § 2510(8).26 \nTogether, these definitions set bounds on the Court's authority to issue the requested \norder because the devices or processes to be employed must meet the definition of \"pen register\" \nor \"trap and trace device.\" \nAs explained by the government, the proposed collection \nDeclaration of Gen. Keith B. Alexander, \nDirector of NSA, at 23-24 (attached as Exhibit A to --pplication) ( \nAlexander Deel.\"). \n26  Different definitions of \"wire communication\" and \"contents\" are set forth at 50 \nU.S.C. § 1801(1) & (n).  The definitions in Section 1801, however, apply to terms \"[a]s used in \nthis subchapter\" -i.e., in 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1812 (PISA subchapter on electronic surveillance) \nand thus are not applicable to the terms \"wire communication\" and \"contents\" as used in the \ndefinition of \"pen register\" and \"trap and trace device\" applicable to Sections 1841-1846 (FISA \nsubchapter on pen registers and trap and trace devices). \nTOP \nSECRETt/CO~UNTt/ORCON,NOFOR~ \n27 \n\nSubject to the following discussion of what types of information may properly be \nregarded as non-content addressing, routing or signaling information, the Court concludes that \nthis  is consistent with the statutory definitions of \"pen register\" and, insofar \nas information about the source of a communication is obtained, \"trap and trace device.\"  Each \ncommunication subject to collection is either a wire communication or an electronic \n28 \n\n'f'OP SECRETHCOlVHNTHORCON,NOFOR.\"l\\l\" \ncommunication under the definitions set forth above.28  The end-result of the collection process29 \nis that only metadata authorized by the Court for collection is forwarded to NSA for retention and \nFinally, and again subject to the \ndiscussion below regarding what types of information may properly be acquired, the Court \nconcludes that the automated processes resulting in the transmission to NSA of information \n28  Many of the communications for which information will be acquired will fall within \nthe broad definition of\"electronic communication\" at 18 U.S.C. § 2510(12).  If, however, a \ncovered communication consists of an \"aural transfer,\" i.e., \"a transfer containing the human \nvoice at any point between and including the point of origin and the point of reception,\" id. § \n2510(18), then it could constitute a \"wire communication\" under the meaning of Section \n2510(1 ).  In either case, the communications subject to collection are \"wire or electronic \ncommunication[s],\" as required in Sections 3127(3) & (4). \n29  The term \"process,\" as used in the definitions of \"pen register\" and \"trap and trace \ndevice\", has its \"generally understood\" meaning of \"a series of actions or operations conducing \nto an end\" and \"covers software and hardware operations used to collect information.\"  In re \nApplication of the United States for an Order Authorizing the Installation and Use of a PR/TT \nDevice on E-Mail Account, 416 F.

The Requested Information \nThe application seeks to expand considerably the types of information authorized for \nacquisition.  Although the government provides new descriptions for the categories of \ninformation sought, see ~lexander Deel., Tab 2, they encompass all the types of \ninformation that were actually collected (to include unauthorized collection) under color of the \nprior orders.  Memorandum of Law and Fact in Support of Application for Pen Registers and \nTrap and Trace Devices for Foreign Intelligence Purposes (\"Memorandum of Law\") at 3, \nsubmitted as Exhibit B to the~pplication. \n1.  The Proper Understanding of DRAS Information and Contents \nThe government contends that all of the data requested in this application may properly \nbe collected by a PR/TT device because all of it is dialing, routing, addressing or signaling \n(\"DRAS\") information, and none constitutes contents.  Id. at 22.  In support of that contention, \nthe government advances several propositions concerning the meaning of \"dialing, routing, \naddressing, or signaling information\" and \"contents,\" as those terms are used in the definitions of \n\"pen register\" and \"trap and trace device.\"  While it is not necessary to address all of the \ngovernment's assertions, a brief discussion of the government's proposed statutory construction \nwill be useful in explaining the Court's decision to approve most, but not all, of the proposed \ncollection. \nTOP SECR:ETh'C01'.UNTllORCON,N0¥0RIS \n30 \n\nTOP \nSECRETHCOP/HNTHOR:CON,NOFOR~ \nThe government argues that DRAS information and contents are \"mutually exclusive \ncategories,\" and that Congress intended for DRAS information \"to be synonymous with 'non \ncontent.\"' Id. at 23, 51.  The Court is not persuaded that the government's proposed construction \ncan be squared with the statutory text.  The definition of pen register covers \"a device or process \nwhich records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an \ninstrument or facility ...,  provided, however, that such information shall not include the contents \nof any communication.\"  § 3127(3).  The structure of the sentence - an affirmative description of \nthe information to be recorded or decoded, followed by a proviso that \"such information shall not \ninclude the contents of any communication\" - does not suggest an intention by Congress to \ncreate two mutually exclusive categories of information.  Instead, the sentence is more naturally \nread as conveying two independent requirements - the information to be recorded or decoded \nmust be DRAS information and, whether or not it is DRAS, it must not be contents.  The same \nobservations apply to the similarly-structured definition of\"trap and trace device.\" See 18 \nU.S.C. § 3127(4) (\"a device or process which captures the incoming electronic or other impulses \nwhich identify the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling \ninformation reasonably likely to identify the source of a wire or electronic communication, \nprovided, however, that such information shall not include the contents of any communication\"). \nThe breadth of the terms used by Congress to identify the categories of information \nsubject to collection and to define \"contents\" reinforces the conclusion that DRAS and contents \nare not mutually exclusive categories.  As the government observes, see Memorandum of Law at \nTOP \nSECRET/ICO~HNT/IORCON,NOFORN \n31 \n\nTOP SECIU:TllCQ~UNT,LJORCOW,JNOFOR.~ \n37, the ordinary meanings of the terms \"dialing,\" \"routing,\" addressing,\" and \"signaling\" - which \nare not defined by the statute - are relatively broad.  Moreover, as noted above, the term \n\"contents\" is broadly defined to include \"any information concerning the substance, purport, or \nmeaning of [an electronic] communication.\"  18 U.S.C. § 2510(8) (emphasis added).  And \n\"electronic communication,\" too, is defined broadly to mean \"any transfer of signs, signals, \nwriting, images, sounds, data or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a \nwire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic, or photooptical system ....\"   18 U.S.C. § \n2510(12) (emphasis added). \nGiven the breadth of the terms used in the statute, it is not surprising that courts have \nidentified forms of information that constitute both DRAS and contents.  In the context of \nInternet communications, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)-\"an address that can lead you to \na file on any computer connected to the Internet\"31  constitutes a form of \"addressing \n-\ninformation\" under the ordinary meaning of that term.  Yet, in some circumstances a URL can \nalso include \"contents\" as defined in Section 2510(8).  In particular, if a user runs a search using \nan Internet search engine, the \"search phrase would appear in the URL after the first forward \nslash\" as part of the addressing information, but would also reveal contents, i.e., the '\"substance' \nand 'meaning' of the communication ... that the user is conducting a search for information on a \nparticular topic.\"  In re Application of the United States for an Order Authorizing the Use of a \nPen Register and Trap, 396 F. Supp.2d 45, 49 (D. Mass. 2005) (Collins, Magistrate Judge); see \n31  See Newton's Telecom Dictionary 971 (241 ed. 2008). \nh \nTOP \nSECRETHCOP.HNT/fORCON,NOFOit.~ \n32 \n\nTOP 8ECRETh'COMJNTh'OR:CON,NOFORN \nalso Inre Pharmatrak, Inc., 329 F.3d 9, 16, 18 (1st Cir. 2003) (URLs including search terms are \n\"contents\" under Section 2510(8)).32  In the context of telephone communications, the term \n\"dialing information\" can naturally be understood to encompass all digits dialed by a caller. \nHowever, some digits dialed after a call has been connected, or \"cut through,\" can constitute \n\"contents\" - for example, if the caller is inputting digits in response to prompts from an \nautomated prescription refill system, the digits may convey substantive instructions such as the \nprescription number and desired pickup time for a refill.  Courts accordingly have described post-\ncut-through digits as dialing information, some of which also constitutes contents.  See In re \nApplication of the United States for an Order (1) Authorizing the Installation and Use of a PRJTT \nDevice and (2) Authorizing Release of Subscriber and Other Information, 622 F.

As will be explained more fully in the discussion of \"communications actions\" below, the \nCourt adopts a somewhat narrower definition of \"signaling information\" than the government.  In \nsummary, the Court concludes that signaling information includes information that is utilized in \n33  To decide the issues presented by the application, the Court need not reach the \ngovernment's contention that Congress intended DRAS information to include all information \nthat is not contents, or its alternative argument that, ifthere is a third category consisting of non \nDRAS, non-content information, a PRITT device may properly collect such information.  See \nMemorandum of Law at 49-51. \n34  The government does not contend that any of the information sought constitutes only \n\"dialing information,\" which it asserts \"presumptively relates to telephones.\"  Memorandum of \nLaw at 37 n.19. \n35  See Newton's Telecom Dictionary at 89 (\"An address comprises the characters \nidentifying the recipient or originator of transmitted data.\"). \nTOP ~'ECRETh'CO~UNTh'ORCON,NOFOR\"\"f \n34 \n\n'fOP SECRETHCO~HNTHORCON,NOFOR.c\"l\\T \nor pertains to (1) logging into or out of an account or (2) processing or transmitting an e-mail or \nIM communication.

When the \ncommunication at issue is between or among end users, application of the definition of \n\"contents\" can be relatively straightforward.  For an e-mail communication, for example, the \ncontents would most obviously include the text of the message, the attachments, and the subject-\nline information.  In the context of person-to-computer communications like the interactions \nbetween a user and a web-mail service provider, however, determining what constitutes contents \ncan become \"hazy.\"  See 2 Lafave, et al. Criminal Procedure§ 4.6(b) at 476 (\"[W]hen a person \nsends a message to a machine, the meaning of 'contents' is unclear.\").  Particularly in the user-\nto-provider context, the broad statutory definition of contents includes some information beyond \nwhat might, in ordinary parlance, be considered the contents of a communication. \n2.

By placing \"signaling\" within the same list of types of communication-related \ninformation, Congress presumably intended \"signaling information\" likewise to relate to the \ntransmission of a communication. \nThe wording of a related provision lends further support to this interpretation: \nA government agency authorized to install and use a pen register or trap and trace \ndevice ... shall use technology reasonably available to it that restricts the \nrecording or decoding of electronic or other impulses to the dialing, routing, \naddressing, and signaling information utilized in the processing and transmitting \nof wire or electronic communications so as not to include the contents of any wire \nor electronic communications. \n18 U.S.C. § 312l(c) (emphasis added).  Questions of available technology aside, there is no \nreason to think Congress intended to compel an agency deploying a PRITT device to try to avoid \nacquiring data that would constitute DRAS information under the definitions of \"pen register\" \nand \"trap and trace device.\"  For this reason, Section 3121(c) strongly suggests that the intended \nscope of acquisition under a PRITT device is DRAS information utilized in the processing and \ntransmitting of a communication.48 \nTOP 8:SCRETHC01\\HNTHORCON,NOFORN \n53 \n\nTOP ~ECRET,L/COMINTHORCON,NOFORN \nThe legislative history relied on by the government, see Memorandum of Law at 52, \nactually points to a similar conclusion about the intended scope of signaling information to be \nacquired by a PR/TT device.

And of course, the definitions of \"pen \nregister\" and \"trap and trace device\" provide that the information acquired \"shall not include the \ncontents of any communication,\" Section 3127(3) & (4) (emphasis added)-unqualified language \nthat certainly seems to include electronic communications between account users and providers. \nThe combined literal effect of these provisions appears to be that PR/TT devices may not obtain \nany information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of any communication, including \nthose between account users and providers, and that communications actions that divulge any \nsuch information would be impermissible \"contents\" for purposes of a PRITT authorization. \nThe government does not directly confront the statutory text on this point.  It does argue, \nhowever, that an expansive, literal understanding of the prohibition on acquiring \"contents\" \nwould lead to an absurd and unintended restriction on what PRITT devices can do.

Even so, NSA projects the creation of \netadata records per day during the period of the requested order, \ncompared with the norm under prior orders of approximately-records per day.  Id. \nThat is roughly an 11-to 24-fold increase in volume. \nThe history of material misstatements in prior applications and non-compliance with prior \norders gives the Court pause before approving such an expanded collection.  The government's \npoor track record with bulk PR/TT acquisition, see pages 9-22, supra, presents threshold \nconcerns about whether implementation will conform with, or exceed, what the government \nrepresents and the Court may approve.  However, after reviewing the government's submissions \nand engaging in thorough discussions with knowledgeable representatives, the Court believes \nthat the government has now provided an accurate description of the functioning of the \n--nd the types of information they obtain.  In addition, the Court is approving proposed \nmodifications of the rules for NSA' s handling of acquired information only insofar as they do not \ndetract from effective implementation of protections regarding U.S. person information. \nB.

In its wording, this certification complies \nwith the statute's requirement of a certification of relevance. 57  As explained below, the Court \nalso finds that there is an adequate basis for regarding the information to be acquired as relevant \nto the terrorist-affiliated Foreign Powers that are the subject of the investigations underlying the \napplication.  See note 9, supra. 58 \nAs summarized above, the  Opinion's finding of relevance most crucially \ndepended on the conclusion that bulk collection is necessary for NSA to employ analytic tools \nthat are likely to generate useful investigative leads to help identify and track terrorist operatives. \nSee page 9, supra.  However, in finding relevance, the  Opinion also relied on \n57  Under FISA, a PR/TT application requires \na certification by the applicant that the information likely to be obtained is foreign \nintelligence information not concerning a United States person or is relevant to an \nongoing investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine \nintelligence activities, provided that such investigation of a United States person \nis not conducted solely on the basis of activities protected by the first amendment \nto the Constitution. \n50 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(2). \n58  The government again argues that the Court should conduct no substantive review of \nthe certification of relevance.  See Memorandum of Law at 29.  This opinion follows Judge \nKollar-Kotelly's~inion in assuming, without conclusively deciding, that \nsubstantive review is warranted.

In those \ncases, the FISC has found that the ongoing production by major telephone service providers of \ncall detail records for all domestic, United States-to-foreign, and foreign-to-United States calls, in \norder to facilitate comparable forms ofNSA analysis and with similar restrictions on handling \n9 \nand dissemination, is relevant to investigations of the Foreign Powers.  See,~' Docket No. \n59  As part of the relevance analysis, the  Opinion also relied on the presence \nof \"safeguards\" governing the handling and dissemination of the bulk metadata and information \nderived from it.  The safeguards proposed in the current application are discussed below, and, as \nmodified, the Court finds them to be adequate.  See Part IV, infra. \n60  The current application also seeks to expand the categories of metadata to be acquired \nfor each communication.  The Court is satisfied that the categories of metadata described in the \ncurrent application constitute directly relevant information insofar as they relate to \ncommunications of a Foreign Power.

For this reason, and because the Court is satisfied that other specifications \nin the order will adequately demarcate the scope of authorized collection, the Court will issue an \norder that does not identify persons pursuant to Section 1842(d)(2)(A)(ii).  However, once this \nsurveillance is implemented, the government's state of knowledge may well change. \nAccordingly, the Court expects the government in any future application to identify persons (as \ndescribed in Section 1842(d)(2)(A)(ii)) who are known to the government for any facility that the \ngovernment lmows will be subjected to PRITT surveillance during the period covered by the \nrequested order. \nSection 1842(d)(2)(A)(iii) requires the order to specify \"the attributes of the \ncommunications to which the order applies, such as the number or other identifier, and, if known, \nthe location of the telephone line or other facility to which the pen register or trap and trace \ndevice is to be attached or applied.\"  The order specifies the location of each facility.

This form of specification is consistent with \nthe language of Section 1842(d )(2)(A)(iii) and is sufficient to delineate the scope of authorized \nacquisition from that which is not authorized. 68 \nIV.  The Court Approves, Subject to Modifications, the Restrictions and Procedures Proposed \nby the Government For the Retention, Use, and Dissemination of the PR/TTMetadata \nUnlike other provisions ofFISA, the PR/TT provisions of the statute do not expressly \nrequire the adoption and use of minimization procedures.  Compare 50 U.S.C. §§ 1805(c)(2)(A) \n& 1824(c)(2)(A) (providing that orders authorizing electronic surveillance or physical search \nmust direct that minimization procedures be followed).  Accordingly, routine FISA PR/TT orders \ndo not require that minimization procedures be followed.  The government acknowledges, \nhowever, that the application now before the Court is not routine.  As discussed above, the \ngovernment seeks to acquire information concerning  lectronic communications, the \nvast majority of which, viewed individually, are not relevant to the counterterrorism purpose of \nthe collection, and many of which involve United States persons.  In light of the sweeping and \nnon-targeted nature of the collection for which authority is sought, the government proposes a \nTOP SECRETHCOMINT,t/ORCON,NOFORN \n81 \n\nTOP SECiu;T,L/CO~UNT,L/ORCON,NOl?ORN \nnumber of restrictions on retention, use, and dissemination, some of which the government refers \nto as \"minimization\" procedures.

The markings, which are applied to the data before it is made available \nfor analytic querying and remain attached to the information as it is stored in metadata \nrepositories, see  esponse at 15, are designed to ensure that software and other \ncontrols (such as user authentication tools) can restrict access to the PR/TT data solely to \nauthorized personnel who have received appropriate training regarding the special rules for using \nTOP SECRETHCO:MJNTHORCON,NOFORN \n83 \n\nTOP 8ECMTHCO~HNTh'ORCON,NOFOftN \nand disseminating such information.  See - Alexander Deel. at 24-25; \n.Deel. at 14 n.8.  After PRITT metadata is queried in accordance with the procedures \ndescribed below, the query results (including analytic output based on query results)7° will remain \nidentifiable as bulk PR/TT-derived information.  ~Response at 15.  Such \ntraceability enables NSA personnel to adhere to the special rules for disseminating PR/TT-\nderived information that are described below. \nB.  Access to the Metadata by Technical Personnel for Non-Analytic Purposes \nUnder the approach proposed by the government, \"[t]rained and authorized technical \npersonnel\" will be permitted to access the metadata to ensure that it is \"usable for intelligence \nanalysis.\"  Id. at 25.  For example, such personnel may access the metadata to perform processes \ndesigned to prevent the collection, processing, or analysis of metadata associated with \nto create and \nmaintain records necessary to demonstrate compliance with the terms of authority granted; or to \ndevelop and test technologies for possible use with the metadata.

Access by Analysts \nNSA analysts will query the metadata that is collected only with RAS-approved \"seed\" \nidentifiers, in accordance with the same basic framework that was approved by the Court in the \nOrder.  ~Alexander Deel. at 26-27;  rder at 7-9. \nAn identifier may be approved for use as a querying seed in one of two ways.  First, an identifier \nmay be used as a seed after a designated \"approving official\" (i.e., the Chief or Deputy Chief of \nNSA's Homeland Analysis Center, or one of 20 authorized Homeland Mission Coordinators72\n) \ndetermines that the available facts give rise to a reasonable articulable suspicion that the \nidentifier is associated with one of the targeted Foreign Powers. ~lexander Deel. at \n26-27.  Before querying can be performed using an identifier that is reasonably believed to be \nused by a United States person, NSA's Office of General Counsel (OGC) must determine that the \nidentifier is not regarded as associated with a Foreign Power solely based on activities that are \nd) \n1  .. contm•  ue \nhrough such a query, the NSA technician could share the query results-i.e., the \nidentifier and the fact that it is a - -with other NSA personnel responsible \n- -\nfor the removal of unwanted me~ositories, but would not be permitted to \nshare any other information from the query.  Id. at 25-26. \n72  The  rder identified one approving official in addition to the 22 \nrder at 8 (listing the Chief, Special FISA Oversight and \nProcessing, Oversight and Compliance, Signals Intelligence Directorate as one of the 23 \napproving officials). \nTOP ~Ji;CRET//COMINTHORCON,NOFORN \n85 \n\nTOP SECRETHCOI\\HNTHORCON,NOFORN \nprotected by the First Amendment.  Id. at 27.  Second, an identifier that is the subject of \nelectronic surveillance or physical search pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1805 or § 1824 based on this \nCourt's finding of probable cause that such identifier is used by an agent of a Foreign Power may \nbe deemed RAS-approved without review by an NSA designated approving official.  Id. \nAs was the case under the Court's  Order and prior orders in this matter, \nRAS-approved queries of the collected data will take the form of \"contact chaining.\"  Id. at 18. \nSuch queries yield data for all communications within two \"hops\" of the RAS-approved seed.  Id. \nThe first hop acquires data regarding all identifiers that have been in contact with the seed, and \nthe second hop yields data for all identifiers in contact with identifiers that were revealed by the \nfirst hop.  Id. at 18 n.12.  The government asserts, and the Court has previously accepted, that \n\"[g]oing out to the second 'hop' enhances NSA's ability to find, detect and identify the Foreign \nPowers and those affiliated with them by greatly increasing the chances that previously unknown \nForeign Power-associated identifiers may be uncovered.\" Id. at 18-19 n.12; \nOpinion and Order at 48.73 \nis not used as a means for querying the metadata, but \nS-approved contact-chaining queries.  See-\nTOP SECRETHCOI\\HNTHORCON,NOFORN \n86 \n\nTOF §ECRETJ/COMINTJ/ORCON,NOFOEL'f \nThe government's proposed RAS-approval and querying process differs in two \nnoteworthy respects from the approach previously approved by the Court.  First, unlike RAS \napprovals made pursuant to the  Order and prior orders in this matter,74 RAS \napprovals made under the approach now proposed by the government will expire after a specified \ntime.  A determination by a designated approving official for an identifier reasonably believed to \nbe used by a United States person would be effective for 180 days, while such a determination \nfor any other identifier would last for one year.  ~lexander Deel. at 27.  An \nidentifier deemed approved based on FISC-authorized electronic surveillance or physical search \nwill be subject to use as a seed for the duration of the FISC authorization.  Id.  The adoption of \nfixed durations for RAS approvals will require the government at regular intervals to renew its \nRAS assessments for identifiers that it wishes to continue to use as querying \"seeds.\"  The re-\nevaluations that will be required under the proposed approach can be expected to increase the \nlikelihood that query results are relevant to the counterterrorism purpose of the bulk metadata \ncollection and to reduce the amount of irrelevant query results (including information regarding \n74  Previously, approved identifiers remained eligible for querying until they were \naffirmatively removed from the list of approved \"seed\" accounts.  The government's practice was \nto remove identifiers from the list only \"[w]hen NSA receive[d] information that suggest[ed] that \na RAS-approved e-mail address [was] no longer associated with one of the Foreign Powers\"; \nimplicitly, the mere passage of time without new information did not obligate the government to \nrevoke a RAS approval.  See Docket No. PRITT  NSA 90-Day Report to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court filed o  at 6.  The government had informed the \nCourt on  that it was \"developing a framework within which to revalidate, and \nwhen appropriate, reverse ... RAS approvals,\" id. at 6, but it does not a  ear that the new \nframework had been implemented before the expiration of the Court's  Order on \nTOP SECRETh'COMINTJ/ORCON,NOFORN \n87 \n\nTOP §ECRETHCOM\"l·NTHORCON,NOFORN \nUnited States persons) that is yielded. \nThe second proposed change to the process involves the number ofNSA personnel \npermitted to perform RAS-approved queries.  Unlike the  Order and prior orders \nin this matter, which limited the number of analysts permitted to run such queries, the re \ninitiation proposed by the government has no such limitation.  See Id. at 26 n.18; \nOrder at 7.  The government instead proposes the use of \"technical controls\" to \"block any \nanalytic query of the metadata with a non-RAS-approved seed.\" -Alexander Deel. at \n26 n.18.  The government further notes that all analytic queries will continue to be logged, and \nthat the creation and maintenance of auditable records will \"continue to serve as a compliance \nmeasure.\"  Id.; see also ~rder at 7.  In light of the safeguards noted by the \ngovernment, and the additional fact that no identifier will be eligible for use as a querying seed \nwithout having first been approved for querying by a designated approving official (or deemed \napproved by virtue of a FISC order), the Court is satisfied that it is unnecessary to limit the \nnumber of NSA analysts eligible to conduct RAS-approved queries. \nD.  Sharing of Query Results Within NSA \nThe government's proposal for sharing query results within NSA is similar to the \napproach approved by the Court last year.  The  Order provided, subject to a \nproviso that is discussed below, that the unminimized results of RAS-approved queries could be \n\"shared with other NSA personnel, including those who are not authorized to access the PRITT \nmetadata.\"~rder at 11.  The basis for such widespread sharing of query results \nTOP 8Jl;CRETNCO\"MTNTHORCON,NOFOR..l\\t \n88 \n\nTOF \nSEC&ET,~'CO~UNThlORCON,NOFOR~ \nwithin NSA was the government's assertion that analysts throughout the agency address \ncounterterrorism issues as part of their missions and, therefore, have a need for the information. 75 \nPresumably for the same reason, the government proposes in the application now before the \nCourt that the results of RAS-approved queries be available to all NSA analysts for intelligence \npurposes, and that such analysts be allowed to apply \"the full range of SIGINT analytical \ntradecraft\" to the query results.  Alexander Deel. at 28 n.19. 76  The Court is satisfied \n75  In a declaration filed in Docket Number PRITT-late last year, the Director of \nNSA explained that: \nNSA's collective expertise in the[] Foreign Powers resides in more than \nintelligence analysts, who sit, not only in the NSA' s Counterterrorism Analytic \nEnterprise, but also in other NSA organizations or product lines.  Analysts from other \nproduct lines also address counterterrorism issues specific to their analytic missions and \nexpertise.  For example, the Int rnational  ecurity Issues  roduct line  ursues forei  n \n~mation on  including \n-The mission o  t  e  om  atmg Proliferation pro  uct  me me u  es \nidentifying connections between proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and \nterrorists, including those associated with the Foreign Powers.  The International Crime \nand Narcotics product line identifies connections between terrorism and human or nuclear \nsmuggling or other forms of international crime .... Each of the NSA's ten product lines \nhas some role in protecting the Homeland from terrorists, including the Foreign Powers. \nBecause so many analysts touch upon terrorism information, it is impossible to estimate \nhow many analysts might be served by access to the PRITT results. \nReport, Exhibit A at 5-6. \n76  The  Order did not explicitly authorize NSA analysts to apply the \"full \nrange of SIG INT tools\" to PRITT query results, but, at the same time it placed no limit on the \nanalytical tools or techniques that could be applied by the trained analysts who were entitled to \nhave access to query results.  Accordingly, the Court views the express reference to \"the full \nrange of analytic tools\" in the government's proposal as a clarification of prior practice that the \nCourt, in any event, approves. \nTor \n8ECRE'f'//C01'HNTHORCON,NOFOR..~ \n89 \n\n'fOF SECRE'f'h'COI'fHNTHORCON,NOFOR\"i\\if \nthat such internal sharing remains appropriate, subject to the training requirement that is \ndiscussed below. \nE.  Dissemination Outside NSA \nThe government's proposed rules for disseminating PR/TT-derived information outside \nofNSA are slightly different from the procedures that were previously in place.  Under the \nOrder, NSA was required to \"treat information from queries of the PR/TT \nmetadata in accordance with United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18 (USSID 18)\" -\nNSA's standard procedures for handling Signals Intelligence collection- and to \"apply USSID \n18 to minimize information concerning U.S. persons obtained from the pen registers and trap and \ntrace devices authorized herein.\"  Order at 12.  In addition, \nbefore NSA disseminate[d] any U.S. person identifying information outside ofNSA, the \nChief oflnformation Sharing Services in the Signals Intelligence Directorate, the Senior \nOperations Officer at NSA's National Security Operations Center, the Signals \nIntelligence Directorate Director, the Deputy Director ofNSA, or the Director ofNSA \n[was required to] determine that the information identifying the U.S. person [was] in fact \nrelated to counterterrorism information and that it [was] necessary to understand the \ncounterterrorism information or assess its importance. \nThe government's proposal has the same two basic elements, although they are worded \nslightly differently.  First, NSA \"will apply the minimization and dissemination procedures of \nSection 7 of [USSID 18] to any results from queries of the metadata disseminated outside of \nNSA in any form.\"  ~lexander Deel. at 28.  Second, \nprior to disseminating any U.S. person information outside NSA, one of the officials \nlisted in Section 7.3(c) ofUSSID 18 (i.e., the Director ofNSA, the Deputy Director of \nTOP SECRETHCOl\\'HNTHOR:CON,NOFORN \n90 \n\nTOP SECRETHCO:MINT/IORCON,NOFORN \nNSA, the Director of the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID), the Deputy Director of \nthe SID, the Chief of the Information Services (ISS) office, the Deputy Chief of the ISS \noffice, and the Senior Operation Officer of the National Security Operations Center) must \ndetermine that the information identifying the U.S. person is in fact related to \ncounterterrorism information and that it is necessary to understand the counterterrorism \ninformation or assess its importance. \nThe differences are not material.  Although the proposal refers specifically to \"the \nminimization and dissemination procedures of Section 7 of [US SID 18]\" rather than to US SID \n18 generally, the Court does not understand any difference in meaning to be intended; indeed, \nSection 7 is the portion of US SID 18 that specifically covers disseminations outside NSA.  See \n~pplication, Tab C (US SID 18), at 8-10.  With regard to the application of the \ncounterterrorism purpose requirement, the proposal adds two high-ranking NSA officials (the \nDeputy Director of the SID and the Deputy Chief of the ISS office) to the list of five officials \nwho were previously designated to make the required determination.  The Court is aware of no \nreason to think that the two additional officials are less suited than the other five to make the \nrequired determination, or that their designation as approving officials will undermine the \ninternal check that is provided by having high-ranking NSA officials approve disseminations that \ninclude United States person identifying information.77 \n77  Like the  Order, the government's proposal would also permit NSA to \n\"share results derive  rom mte  1gence analysis queries of the metadata, including U.S. person \nidentifying information, with Executive Branch personnel ... in order to enable them to \ndetermine whether the information contains excul  or impeachment information or is \notherwise discoverable in legal proceedings.\"  Alexander Deel. 28-29; ~ \n(continued ... ) \nTOP §ECRETHCOMIN'fHORCON,NOFOM \n91 \n\nTOP ~ECRBTh'COl'.UNT/fORCON,NOFORN \nThe government's proposal contains one additional element that was not part of the \nframework approved by the Court in th~ Order.  Specifically, the government \nproposes that \"[i]n the extraordinary event that NSA determines that there is a need to \ndisseminate information identifying a U.S. person that is related to foreign intelligence \ninformation, as defined by 50 U.S.C. § 1801(e), other than counterterrorism information and that \nis necessary to understand the foreign intelligence information or assess its importance, the \nGovernment will seek prior approval from the Court.\"  Alexander Deel. at 28 n.20. \nInsofar as the government's proposal invites the Court to review and pre-approve individual \ndisseminations of information based upon the Court's own assessments of foreign intelligence \nvalue, the Court declines the invitation.  The judiciary is ill-equipped to make such assessments, \nwhich involve matters on which the courts generally defer to the Executive Branch.78  In the \n77  continued) \n( ••• \n-Order at 12-13.  The government's current proposal also permits such sharin  with \nExecutive Branch personnel \"to facilitate their lawful oversight functions.\" \nAlexander Deel. at 29.  Although the  order did not contain \nto this effect, sharing for such purposes was plainly contemplated.  See, ~' \nOrder at 16 (providing forNSD review of RAS querying justifications). \n78  See,~' Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, -U.S.-, 2010 WL 2471055, *22 \n(June 21, 2010) (\"[W]hen it comes to collecting evidence and drawing factual inferences in [the \nnational security] area, the lack of competence on the part of the courts is marked.\") (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted); Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 \nU.S. 471, 491 (1999) (\"a court would be ill-equipped to determine [the] authenticity and utterly \nunable to assess [the] adequacy\" of the executive's security or foreign policy reasons for treating \ncertain foreign nationals as a \"special threat\"); Regan v.

Cf. Standard Minimization Procedures for FBI \nElectronic Surveillance and Physical Search§ I.D (on file with the Court in Docket No. 08-\n1833). \nF.  Retention \nUnder the  rder, the PR/TT metadata was available for querying for \nfour and one-half years, after which it had to be destroyed.  Order at 13.  The four-\nand-one-half-year retention period was originally set based upon NSA's assessment of how long \ncollected metadata is likely to have operational value.  See  Opinion at 70-71. \nPursuant to the government's proposal, the retention period would be extended to five years. \nApplication at 13.  The government asserts that the purpose of the change is to \n\"develop and maintain consistency\" with the retention period for NSA's bulk telephony metadata \ncollection, which is authorized by this Court under the FISA business records provision, 50 \nU.S.C. § 1861.  Response at 24.  The Court is satisfied that the relatively small \nextension of the retention period that is sought by the government is justified by the \nadministrative benefits that would result. \nTOP SECRET/./COM:INT#ORCON,NOFOR.~ \n93 \n\nTOP SECRET//€01\\UNT//ORCON,NOFOR.\"\"* \nG.  Oversight \nThe government proposes to employ an internal oversight regime that closely tracks the \noversight provisions adopted by the Court in th-rder, requiring, among other \nthings, that NSA OGC and NSD take various steps to ensure that the data is collected and \nhandled in accordance with the scope of the authorization.  Compare  Order at 13-\n16, with~lexander Deel. at 29-30.  There is, however, one significant difference. \nThe  Order required NSA OGC to ensure that all NSA personnel permitted to \naccess the metadata or receive query results were first \"provided the appropriate and adequate \ntraining and guidance regarding the procedures and restrictions for storage, access, and \ndissemination of the PR/TT metadata and/or PR/TT metadata-derived information, i.e., query \nresults.\"  Order at 13-14.  The analogous oversight provision in the government's \ncurrent proposal, by contrast, directs NSA OGC and the Office of the Director of Oversight and \nCompliance (ODOC) to ensure that adequate training and guidance is provided to NSA personnel \nhaving access to the metadata, but not to those receiving query results.  See \nAlexander Deel. at 29.  As discussed above, the government has proposed special rules and \nrestrictions on the handling and dissemination of query results.  Most notably, PR/TT query \nresults must remain identifiable as bulk PR/TT-derived information, see  Response \nat 15, and may not be disseminated outside NSA without the prior determination by a designated \nofficial that any United States person information relates to counterterrorism information and that \nit is necessary to understand the counterterrorism information or to assess its importance. -\n'f'OP SECRET//COI\\HNT//O&CON,N0¥0R])[ \n94 \n\nTOP SECRE'fHC01''£INTHORCON,NOFOR.\"1\" \n•  Alexander Deel. at 28.  To follow those rules, NSA personnel must know and understand \nthem. \nAs noted above, NSA' s record of compliance with these rules has been poor.  Most \nnotably, NSA generally disregarded the special rules for disseminating United States person \ninformation outside ofNSA until it was ordered to report such disseminations and certify to the \nFISC that the required approval had been obtained.  See pages 18-19, supra.  The government has \nprovided no meaningful explanation why these violations occurred, but it seems likely that \nwidespread ignorance of the rules was a contributing factor. \nAccordingly, the Court will order NSA OGC and ODOC to ensure that all NSA personnel \nwho receive PR/TT query results in any form first receive appropriate and adequate training and \nguidance regarding the procedures and restrictions for the handling and dissemination of such \ninformation. \nH.  Reporting \nThe reporting requirements proposed by the government are similar to the reporting \ngovernment will submit reports to the Court approximately every 30 days and upon requesting \nany renewal of the authority sought. ~Alexander Dec. at 31.  The 30-day reports \nwill include \"a discussion of the queries made since the last report and NSA' s application of the \nRAS standard.\"  Id.  Because NSA will not apply the requested authority to particular \n'f'OF SECIIB'f'/iCOMIN'fh'ORCON, NOFORN \n95 \n\n'f'OF SECRE'f'HCOI\\>UN'fHORCON ,NOFORN \nowever, the 30-day reports will no longer include a discussion of \"changes in the \ndescription of th  .. or in the nature of the communications carried thereon.\"  See \nOrder at 16.  rder, the government's proposal will also \nrequire it, upon seeking renewal of the requested authority, to file a report describing \"any new \nfacility proposed to be added\" and \"any changes proposed in the collection methods.\" -\n•  Alexander Deel. at 31. \nThe  Order also directed the government to submit weekly reports listing \neach instance in which \"NSA has shared, in any form, information obtained or derived from the \nPRITT metadata with anyone outside NSA,\" including a certification that the requirements for \ndisseminating United States person information (i.e., that a designated official had determined \nthat any such information related to counterterrorism information and was necessary to \nunderstand courterterrorism information or to assess its importance) had been followed.  See \nOrder at 17.  The government's proposal does not include such a requirement. \nIn light ofNSA's historical problems complying with the requirements for disseminating PR/TT \nderived information, the Court is not prepared to eliminate this reporting requirement altogether. \nAt the same time, the Court does not believe that weekly reports are still necessary to ensure \ncompliance.  Accordingly, the Court will order that the 30-day reports described in the preceding \nparagraph include a statement of the number of instances since the preceding report in which \nNSA has shared, in any form, information obtained or derived from the PR/TT metadata with \nanyone outside NSA.  For each such instance in which United States person information has been \n'fOP SECRETHCO~UNT//ORCO\"N,N0¥0B.N \n96 \n\nTOP SECRETHCOI\\'HNTHORCON,NOFORN \nshared, the report must also include NSA's attestation that one of the officials authorized to \napprove such disseminations determined, prior to dissemination, that the information was related \nto counterterrorism information and necessary to understand the counterterrorism information or \nto assess its importance. \nV.  The Government's Request for Authority to Access and Use All \nPreviously Collected Data \nThe government seeks authority to access and use all previously acquired bulk PRITT \ndata, including information not authorized for collection under the Court's prior orders, subject \nto the same restrictions and procedures that will apply to newly-acquired PRITT collection.  See \nApplication at 16.  For the following reasons, the Court will grant the government's \nrequest in part and deny it in part. \nA. \nAs discussed above, after the government disclosed the continuous and widespread \ncollection of data exceeding the scope of the Court's prior orders dating back to-it elected \nnot to seek renewal of the authority granted in the  Order.  The government was \nunable, before the expiration of that authority on  to determine the extent to \nwhich the previously-acquired information exceeded the scope of the Court's orders or to rule \nout the possibility that some of the information fell outside the scope of the pen register statute. \nOrder at 2-4.  Accordingly, as an interim measure, Judge Walton entered an \norder o -directing the government not to access the information previously \nTOP §ECRJi;THCOl:\\UNTHORCON,NOFOR:N \n97 \n\nTOP SECRET//CO!\\HNT//OR:CON,NOFORN \nobtained \"for any analytic or investigative purpose,\" except when such access is \"necessary to \nprotect against an imminent threat to human life.\"  See  Order at 4-5; see also page \n23, SU:Qra. \nThe application now before the Court includes a request to lift th  Order. \nApplication at 16.  Since  , both the Court and the \ngovernment have had the opportunity to make a thorough assessment of the scope and \ncircumstances of the overcollection and to consider the pertinent legal issues.  Based on that \nassessment, the Court believes that it is now appropriate to rescind th \nOrder, which, as noted, was intended to be an interim measure, and to refine the rules for \nhandling the prior bulk PR/TT collection. \nB.  The Court Lacks Authority to Grant the Government's Request in its Entirety \nThe Court concludes that it has only limited authority to grant the government's request \nfor permission to resume accessing and using previously-collected information.  As discussed in \nmore detail below, the Court concludes that it possesses authority to permit the government to \nquery data collected within the scope of the Court's prior orders, and that it is appropriate under \nthe circumstances to grant such approval.  But for information falling outside the scope of the \nprior orders, the Court lacks authority to approve any use or disclosure that would be prohibited \nunder 50 U.S.C. § 1809(a)(2).  Accordingly, the Court will deny the government's request with \nrespect to those portions of the unauthorized collection that are covered by Section 1809(a )(2). \nTo the extent that other portions of the unauthorized prior collection may fall outside the reach of \nTOP ~ECRETil/COP.UNT//OR:CON,NOFORN \n98 \n\nTOP \nSECRET/ICOMINT/IORCON,JNOFOR~ \nSection 1809(a)(2), the Court concludes that it has authority to grant the government's request \nand that it is appropriate under the circumstances to do so. \n1.  Information Authorized for Acquisition Under the Court's Prior Orders \nThe government argues that the FISA PRITT statute, 50 U.S.C. § 1842, empowers the \nCourt to authorize NSA to resume querying the prior collection in its entirety.  See Memorandum \nof Law at 72-73.  As discussed above, the Court continues to be satisfied that it may, pursuant to \nSection 1842 and subject to appropriate restrictions, authorize NSA to acquire, in bulk, the \nmetadata associated with Internet communications transiting the United States.  Further, although \nSection 1842 does not explicitly require the application of minimization procedures to PRITT-\nacquired information, the Court also agrees that in light of the sweeping and non-targeted nature \nof this bulk collection, it has authority to impose limitations on access to and use of the metadata \nthat NSA has accumulated. \nThe Court is satisfied that it may invoke the same authority to permit NSA to resume \nquerying the PRITT information that was collected in accordance with the Court's prior orders. \nThe Court is further persuaded that, in light of the government's assertion of national security \nneed,79 it is appropriate to exercise that authority.  Accordingly, the Court hereby orders that the \ngovernment may access, use, and disseminate bulk PR/TT information that was collected in \n79  See~lexander Deel. at 10  \"  he ability ofNSA to access the \ninformation collected under docket number PR/TT  and previous dockets is vital to NSA's \nability to carry out its counterterrorism intelligence miss10n.

Information Not Authorized for Acquisition Under the Court's Prior \nOrders \nBy contrast, the Court is not persuaded that it has authority to grant the government's \nrequest with respect to all information collected outside the scope of its prior orders.  FISA itself \nprecludes the Court from granting that request in full. \na.  50 U.S.C. § l 809(a)(2) Precludes the Court from Granting the \nGovernment's Request with Respect to Some of the Prior \nUnauthorized Collection \nThe crucial provision of PISA, 50 U.S.C. § 1809, provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \n(a)  Prohibited Activities \nA person is guilty of an offense if he intentionally-\n(2)  discloses or uses information obtained under color of law by electronic surveillance, \nknowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through electronic \nsurveillance not authorized by this chapter, chapter 119, 121, or 206 of Title 18 or any \nexpress statutory authorization that is an additional exclusive means for conducting \nelectronic surveillance under section 1812 of this title. \n50 U.S.C. § l 809(a)(2). \nSection 1809(a)(2) has three essential elements:  (1) the intentional disclosure or use of \ninformation (2) obtained under color of law through electronic surveillance (3) by a person \nknowing or having reason to lmow that the information was obtained through electronic \nsurveillance not authorized by one of the enumerated (or similar) statutory provisions.  The \nTOP \n~EGRET//COI\\UNTHORCON,NOFORN \n100 \n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT#ORCON,NOFOR.l\\f \ngovernment's request to access, use, and disseminate the fruits of the prior unauthorized \ncollection implicates all three elements of Section 1809(a)(2)'s criminal prohibition. \nApplication of the first two elements is straightforward.  Plainly, conducting contact \nchaining inquiries of stored data and sharing the query results both within and outside NSA \nwould constitute the intentional use and disclosure of information. 80  It is also clear that the data \npreviously collected by the government-which was acquired through the use of orders issued by \nthis Court pursuant to FISA-was obtained \"under color oflaw.\" See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. \n42, 49-50 (1988) (explaining that the misuse of authority possessed by virtue oflaw is action \n\"under color of law\"). 81 \nThe third element requires lengthier discussion, but, in summary, the Court concludes \nthat some of the prior bulk PR/TT collection is information that the responsible government \nofficials know or have reason to know was obtained through electronic surveillance not \nauthorized by one of the statutory provisions referred to in Section 1809(a)(2).  To begin with, \n80  Insofar as the government contends that Section 1809(a)(2) reaches only \"intentional \nviolations of the Court's orders,\" or \"willful\" as opposed to intentional conduct, see \nMemorandum of Law at 74 n. 37, the Court disagrees.  The plain language of the statute requires \nproof that the person in question \"intentionally\" disclosed or used information \"knowing or with \nreason to know\" the information was obtained in the manner described. \n81  The phrase \"a person\" in Section 1809 is certainly intended to cover government \nofficials.  In addition to requiring conduct \"under color oflaw,\" the statute provides an \naffirmative defense to prosecution for a \"law enforcement or investigative officer engaged in the \ncourse of his official duties\" in connection with electronic surveillance \"authorized by and \nconducted pursuant to a search warrant or court order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\"  See \n50 U.S.C. § 1809(b). \nTOP ~};CRET/ICOMINTNOR::CON,NOFORN \n101 \n\n'f'Of SECRE'fh'COl\\iHNT/IORCON,NOFOR.\"f \nthe language of Section 1809(a)(2) demonstrates that Congress intended at least some \nunauthorized PRITT acquisitions to be covered by the criminal prohibition.  The statute expressly \nreaches, among other things, information obtained through \"electronic surveillance not \nauthorized by this chapter, [or] chapter 119, 121, or 206 of Title 18.\"  Section 1809 is part of \nChapter 36 of Title 50 of the U.S. Code.  Chapter 36, in turn, encompasses all ofFISA, as \ncodified in Title 50, including FISA's PR/TT provisions found at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1841-1846. \nAccordingly, \"this chapter\" in Section 1809(a)(2) refers in part to the FISA PRITT provisions. \nMoreover, Chapter 206 of Title 18, which is also referenced in Section 1809(a )(2), consists \nexclusively of the PRITT provisions of the criminal code, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-3127, key portions \nof which are incorporated by reference into FISA.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1841(2) (incorporating the \ndefinitions of \"pen register\" and \"trap and trace device\" found at 18 U.S.C. § 3127).  Because \nChapter 206 of Title 18 authorizes no means of acquiring information other than through the use \nof PRITT devices, Section 1809(a)(2)'s reference to \"electronic surveillance\" must be understood \nto include at least some information acquired through the use of PRITT authority. \nThat conclusion is reinforced by examination of FISA's definition of \"electronic \nsurveillance,\" which applies to Section 1809, see 50 U.S.C. § 1801 (\"As used in this \nsubchapter: ... \"),and which is broad enough to include some (but not necessarily all) \ninformation acquired through the use of PRITT devices. 82  \"Electronic surveillance\" is defined, in \n82  See also H.R. Rep. 95-1283, pt. 1, at 51 (1978) (\"The surveillance covered by [Section \n1801(£)(2)] is not limited to the acquisition of the oral or verbal contents of a communication .. . \n(continued ... ) \nTOP SEGRETllCOMIJNTh'ORCON,NOFORN \n102 \n\nTOP §BCRETt/CO~HNTHORCON,NOFORN \npertinent part, as \"the acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device of the \ncontents of any wire communication to or from a person in the United States, without the consent \nof any party thereto, if such acquisition occurs in the United States.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1801(£)(2).83 \nFor purposes of this definition of \"electronic surveillance,\" \"contents\" is defined in Section \n1801 (n) to include, among other things, \"any information concerning the identity of the parties\" \nto a communication \"or the existence ... of that communication.\"84  \"Wire communication\" is \ndefined as \"any communication while it is being carried by a wire, cable, or other like connection \n82 continued) \n( ••• \n[and] includes any form of 'pen register' or 'touch-tone decoder' device which is used to acquire, \nfrom the contents of a voice communication, the identities or locations of the parties to the \ncommunication.\"). \n83  Section 1801(£) includes three additional definitions of \"electronic surveillance,\" only \none of which appears to have any possible application with regard to the prior bulk PR/TT \ncollection.  Subsections (f)(l) (\"the acquisition ... of any wire or radio communication sent by \nor intended to be received by a particular, known United States person who is in the United \nStates, if the contents are acquired by intentionally targeting that United States person\") and \n(f)(3) (\"the intentional acquisition ... of any radio communication\") are flatly inapplicable. \nSubsection (f)( 4) could apply to the extent the prior collection included non-wire \ncommunications acquired under \"circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation \nof privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes.\" The Court's analysis \nof Section l 809(a)(2) would, of course, apply identically to prior unauthorized collection \nconstituting \"electronic surveillance\" under any of the definitions set forth in Section 1801(£). \n84  As noted above, the definition of \"contents\" in Section 1801 (n) is different than the \ndefinition of\"contents\" in 18 U.S.C. § 2510(8)-the latter definition does not include \ninformation co~entity of the parties to or the existence of the communication.  See \npage 27, supra;-Opinion at 6 n.6.  Accordingly, information constituting \"contents\" \nas used in Section 1801 (f) can be acquired through the use of a PRITT device, provided that it \ndoes not also constitute \"contents\" under Section 2510(8) and that it otherwise satisfies the \nstatutory requirements for acquisition by PRITT collection. \n'f'OP SECR:E'fHCOMINTHORCON,NOFOR\"'f \n103 \n\nTOP ~J;CRET/ICO~HNT/fORCON,NOFOltN \nfurnished or operated by any person engaged as a common carrier in providing or operating such \nfacilities for the transmission of interstate or foreign commerce.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1801(1).  Reading \nthose definitions together, then, \"electronic surveillance\" includes, among other things; the \nacquisition (1) by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device (2) of information \nconcerning the identity of the parties to or the existence of any communication to or from a \nperson in the United States, (3) when such information is acquired in the United States (4) while \nthe communication is being carried on a wire, cable, or other like connection furnished or \noperated by a common carrier. \nThe unauthorized portion of the prior PRITT collection includes some information that \nmeets all four of these criteria.  First, there is no question that the prior collection was acquired \nthrough the use of\"electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance devices.\"  See,~'­\nDeel. at 9 (describing the use of \"NSA-controlled equipment or devices\" to \"extract \nmetadata for subsequent forwarding to NSA's repositories\"). \nSecond, the overcollection included information concerning the identity of the parties to \nand the existence of communications to or from persons in the United States.  Persons in the \nUnited States were parties to some of the communications for which data was acquired.  See, \nApplication at 5-6 (stating that the collection will include metadata pertaining \nto persons within the United States); id. at 9 (stating that the \"collection activity ... will collect \nmetadata from electronic communications that are: (1) between the United States and abroad; (2) \nbetween overseas locations; and (3) wholly within the United States\").  And, as discussed above, \n'FOP SECRETHCOMINTNORCOJN,JNOFORN \n104 \n\nthe unauthorized collection included: \nforms of information concern the existence of an associated communication, and many of them \ncould also concern the identities of the communicants. \nThird, the data previously collected, both authorized and unauthorized, was acquired in \nthe United States.  See, ~'  Application at 9 (\"All of the collection activity \ndescribed above will occur in the United States ... .'')\" \nFourth, it appears that much, and perhaps all, of the information previously collected was \nacquired while the associated communication was \"being carried by a wire, cable, or other like \nconnection furnished or operated by any person engaged as a common carrier in providing or \noperating such facilities for the transmission of interstate or foreign commerce.\"  See 50 U.S.C. § \n'fOP SECRE'fHCOl\\HNT/IORCON,NOFOR~ \n105 \n\nTOP 81£CRETMCOt\\HNT//OR:CON,NOFOR.~ \n106 \n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that at least some of the data previously \ncollected, including portions of the data that was not authorized by the Court's prior orders, \nconstitutes unauthorized \"electronic surveillance\" under Section 1809(a )(2).  But that does not \ncomplete the analysis.  Section 1809 does not prohibit all disclosures or uses of unauthorized \nelectronic surveillance; rather, it reaches disclosure or use only by \"a person knowing or having \nreason to know\" that the information was obtained through unauthorized electronic surveillance. \nThe Court concludes that the knowledge requirement is satisfied for some of the prior \nunauthorized collection constituting electronic surveillance.  The government has acknowledged \nthat particular portions of the prior collection fell outside the scope of the Court's prior \nTOP SECRETNCOI\\UNT//ORCON,NOFORN \n107 \n\nTOP ~ECRET,~'COIWINTt/ORCOJN,NOFOR.\"l\\f \nauthorizations.  See generally  Report.  Further, some of that unauthorized \ncollection is identifiable as electronic surveillance - i.e., as information concerning the identity \nof the parties to or the existence of any communication to or from a person in the United States \nthat was acquired in the United States while the communication was being carried on a wire, \ncable, or other like connection furnished or operated by a common carrier.  As demonstrated \nabove, the government's filings dating back to~emonstrate that most, if not all, of the \ninformation previously collected was acquired in the United States \nThe government's descriptions of the \novercollected information make clear that the information concerns the identity of the parties, the \nexistence of the communication, or both.  Finally, the information available to the government -\n~, e-mail identifiers--is likely to make some of the data collected identifiable \nas concerning communications to or from a person in the United States.  Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that the government officials responsible for using and making disclosures of bulk \nPR/TT-derived information know or have reason to know that portions of the prior collection \nconstitute unauthorized electronic surveillance. 86 \n86  In the law enforcement context, courts have held that there is no statutory prohibition \non the use - specifically, the evidentiary use - of the results of unlawful PRITT surveillance. \nSee,~, Forrester, supra, 512 F.3d at 512-13 (citing cases).  Those decisions, however, do not \naddress the potential application of Section l 809(a)(2), and so provide no basis for departing \nfrom the clear terms of that statutory prohibition.  Indeed, Forrester recognized that suppression \nwould be warranted if it were \"clearly contemplated by [a] relevant statute\" and stressed that the \nparty seeking suppression had failed to \"point to any statutory language requiring suppression.\" \n(continued ... ) \n'f'O'P SECRE'fHCOl\\HNThlORCON,N0¥0RbT \n108 \n\nTOP SECRETf/COPti'HNTf/ORCON,NOFORN \nb.  Section l 809(a)(2) Applies to the Prior Collection \nThe government does not contest that portions of the prior collection contain information \nthat the responsible officials know or have reason to know constitutes \"electronic surveillance\" \nthat was collected without the necessary authority.  Instead, the government offers several \nreasons why it believes Section 1809(a)(2) presents no bar to Court approval of use of the prior \ncollection.  The Court finds the government's contentions unpersuasive. \nThe government argues that the opening phrase of 50 U.S.C. § 1842(a) vests the Court \nwith authority to enter an order rendering Section 1809(a)(2) inapplicable.  See Memorandum of \nLaw at 74 n. 37.  The Court disagrees.  Section 1842(a), which is entitled \"Application for \nauthorization or approval,\" provides in pertinent part as follows: \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney General or a designated \nattorney for the government may malce an application for an order or an extension of an \norder authorizing or approving the installation or use of a pen register or trap and trace \ndevice for any investigation to obtain foreign intelligence information .... \nAs the context makes clear, the opening phrase \"[n]othwithstanding any other provision oflaw\" \nin Section 1842 relates to the circumstances in which the government may apply for an order \npermitting it to install and use a PR/TT device for foreign intelligence purposes.  It does not \nspeak to the Court's authority to grant a request for permission to use and disclose information \n86 continued) \n( .•• \nId. at 512; see also Nardone v. United States, 302 U.S. 379, 382-84 (1937) (statute prohibiting \nany person from divulging the substance of interstate wire communications precluded testimony \nby law enforcement agents about such communications). \nTOP \n§ECRET//COMJNT//ORCON,NOFOR~ \n109 \n\nTOP SECRETHCOl\\HNT/fORCON,NOFORN \nobtained in violation of prior orders authorizing the installation of PR/TT devices.  Indeed, the \nCourt finds nothing in the text of Section 1842 or the other provisions of PISA that can be read to \nconfer such authority, particularly in the face of the clear prohibition set forth in Section \n1809( a)(2). \nThe government next contends that because the Court has, in its prior orders, regulated \naccess to and use of previously accumulated metadata, it follows that the Court may now \nauthorize NSA to access and use all previously collected information, including information that \nwas acquired outside the scope of prior authorizations, so long as the information \"is within the \nscope of the [PR/TT] statute and the Constitution.\"  Memorandum of Law at 73.  But the \ngovernment overstates the precedential significance of the Court's past practice.  The fact that the \nCourt has, at the government's invitation, exercised authority to limit the use of properly \nacquired bulk PR/TT data does not support the conclusion that it also has authority to permit the \nuse of improperly-acquired PR/TT information, especially when such use is criminally prohibited \nby Section 1809(a)(2). \nThe Court has limited the access to and use of information collected in accordance with \nprior authorizations, in view of the sweeping and non-targeted nature of that collection.  The \nCourt has done so within a statutory framework that generally permits the government to make \ncomparatively liberal use, for foreign intelligence purposes, of information acquired pursuant to \nPR/TT orders, and in which the Court generally has a relatively small role beyond the acquisition \nTOP ~ECRETl+COMJNT,L,tORCON,NOFOR.\"l\\l\" \n110 \n\nTOP SECRETHCOMINTHORCON,WOFOR~ \nstage.87  Thus, the Court's prior orders in this matter are notable not because they permitted the \nuse of PRJTT-acquired data - again, the statute itself generally allows the use and dissemination \nof properly-acquired PRJTT information for foreign intelligence purposes - but because they \nimposed restrictions on such use to account for the bulk and non-targeted nature of the \ncollection. 88  The Court has never authorized the government to access and use information \ncollected outside the scope of its prior orders in this matter.  Indeed, in the prior instances in \nwhich the Court learned of overcollections, it has carefully monitored the disposition of the \nimproperly-acquired information to ensure that it was not used or disseminated by the \ngovernment.  See pages 11-12, 14, supra. \nThe government further contends that Rule 10(c ) of the Rules of this Court gives the \nCourt discretion to authorize access to and use of the overcollected information.  Memorandum \nof Law at 73.  The Court disagrees.  Rule 10(c ) requires the government, upon discovering that \n87  As discussed above, unlike the provisions for electronic surveillance and physical \nsearch, see 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1812, 1821-1829, the FISA PRJTT provisions do not require the \napplication of Court-approved minimization procedures.  In the context of Court-authorized \nelectronic surveillance and physical searches, such procedures govern not only the acquisition of \ninformation, but also its retention and dissemination.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(h), 1821(4).  Like \nthe electronic surveillance and physical search provisions, the FISA PRJTT provisions limit the \nuse and disclosure of information acquired for law enforcement and other non-foreign \nintelligence-related purposes.  Compare 50 U.S.C. § 1845 with 50 U.S.C. § 1806. \n88  Contrary to the government's assertion, the imposition of restrictions on the use and \ndissemination of the data collected is not \"uni ue\" to the bulk PRJTT.  Indeed  the Court restricts \nthe \nTOP SECRETHCOJ\\HNTHORCON,NOFORN \n111 \n\n'f'OP SECRR'f'7'/COI\\>HN'I'iiORCON ,NOFORN \n\"any authority granted by the Court has been implemented in a manner that did not comply with \nthe Court's authorization,\" to notify the Court of the incident and to explain, among other things, \n\"how the government proposes to dispose of or treat any information obtained as a result of the \nnon-compliance.\"  FISC Rule 10(c  ).  Rule 10 does not explicitly give the Court the authority to \ndo anything.  To be sure, the rule implicitly recognizes the Court's authority, subject to PISA and \nother applicable law, to ensure compliance with its orders and with applicable Court-approved \nprocedures.  It does not, however, state or suggest that the Court is free in the event of an \novercollection to dictate any disposition of the overcollected material that it wishes, without \nregard to other provisions of law, such as Section 1809(a)(2).89 \nFinally, insofar as the government suggests that the Court has inherent authority to permit \nthe use and disclosure of all unauthorized collection without regard to Section 1809, see \nMemorandum of Law at 73-74 & n.37, the Court again must disagree.  To be sure, this Court, \nlike all other Article III courts, was vested upon its creation with certain inherent powers.

It is well settled, however, that the exercise of such authority \"is invalid if it \nconflicts with constitutional or statutory provisions.\" Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 148 (1985). \nAnd defining crimes is not among the inherent powers of the federal courts; rather, federal crimes \nare defined by Congress and are solely creatures of statute.  Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. \n614, 620-21 (1998); United States v. Hudson, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32, 34 (1812).  Accordingly, \nwhen Congress has spoken clearly, a court assessing the reach of a criminal statute must heed \nCongress's intent as reflected in the statutory text.  See,~' Huddleston v. United States, 415 \nU.S. 814, 831 (1974).  The plain language of Section 1809(a)(2) makes it a crime for any person, \nacting under color of law, intentionally to use or disclose information with knowledge or reason \nto know that the information was obtained through unauthorized electronic surveillance.  The \nCourt simply lacks the power, inherent or otherwise, to authorize the government to engage in \nconduct that Congress has unambiguously prohibited.90 \n90  In its~esponse at page 4 n.1, the government added an alternative \nrequest for the Court to amend all prior bulk PRITT orders nunc pro tune to permit acquisition of \nthe overcollected information.  The Court denies that request.  Nunc pro tune relief is appropriate \nto conform the record to a court's original intent but is not a means to alter what was originally \nintended or what actually transpired.  See,~.

Portions of the Unauthorized Collection Falling Outside the Scope \nof Section 1809(a)(2) \nThere is one additional category of information to consider - overcollected information \nthat is not subject to Section 1809(a)(2).  The Court is not well positioned to attempt a \ncomprehensive description of the particular types of information that are subject (or not) to \nSection 1809(a)(2)'s prohibition, but it appears that some of the overcollected data is likely to \nfall outside its reach.  For example, NSA may have no way to determine based on the available \ninformation whether a particular piece of data relates to a communication obtained from the \nSimilarly, it may not be apparent from available \ninformation whether the communication to which a piece of data relates is to or from a person in \nthe United States, such that acquisition constituted electronic surveillance as defined at Section \n1801(£)(2). \nd) \n90  ontm.  ue \nategories.

Of course, \ngovernment officials may not avoid the strictures of Section 1809(a)(2) by cultivating a state of \ndeliberate ignorance when reasonable inquiry would likely establish that information was indeed \nobtained through unauthorized electronic surveillance.  See, M.,_, United States v. Whitehill, 532 \nF.3d 746, 751 (8th Cir.) (where \"failure to investigate is equivalent to 'burying one's head in the \nsand,\"' willful blindness may constitute knowledge), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 610 (2008). \nHowever, when it is not known, and there is genuinely no reason to know, that a piece of \ninformation was acquired through electronic surveillance that was not authorized by the Court's \nprior orders, the information is not subject to the criminal prohibition in Section 1809(a)(2). \nThe Court is satisfied that neither Section 1809(a)(2) nor any other provision oflaw \nprecludes it from authorizing the government to access and use this category of information.  The \nbigger question here is whether the Court should grant such authority.  Given NSA's \nlongstanding and pervasive violations of the prior orders in this matter, the Court believes that it \nwould be acting well within its discretion in precluding the government from accessing or using \nsuch information.  Barring any use of the information would provide a strong incentive for the \nexercise of greater care in this massive collection by the executive branch officials responsible \nfor ensuring compliance with the Court's orders and other applicable requirements.  On the other \nhand, the government has asserted that it has a strong national security interest in accessing and \nTOP SECRETHCOMJNT/fORCON,NOFORN \n115 \n\n'f'Of ~51!':CRE'fHCO!\\HNT/.fORCON,NOVOR.J)l\" \nusing the overcollected information.  The Court has no basis to question that assertion. \nFurthermore, high-level officials at the Department of Justice and NSA have personally assured \nthe Court that they will closely monitor the acquisition and use of the bulk PR/TT collection to \nensure that the law, as reflected in the Court's orders, is carefully followed by all responsible \nofficials and employees.  In light of the government's assertions of need, and in heavy reliance on \nthe assurances of the responsible officials, the Court is prepared - albeit reluctantly - to grant the \ngovernment's request with respect to information that is not subject to Section 1809(a)(2)'s \nprohibition.  Hence, the government may access, use, and disseminate such information subject \nto the restrictions and procedures described above that will apply to future collection. \nThe Court expects the responsible executive branch officials to act with care and in good \nfaith in determining which portions of the prior collection are subject to Section 1809(a)(2)'s \nprohibition.  The authorization to use overcollected information falling outside the scope of the \ncriminal prohibition should not be understood as an invitation to disregard information that, if \npursued, would create a reason to know that data was obtained by unauthorized electronic \nsurveillance within the meaning of Section 1809(a)(2).  The Court also expects the government \nto keep it reasonably apprised with regard to efforts to segregate those portions of the prior \ncollection that it intends to use from the portions it is prohibited from using.  Accordingly, the \nCourt will order that each of the 30-day reports described above include a description of those \nefforts. \nTOP ~ECRET//CO±\\UNT//ORCON,NOFORN \n116 \n\nTOP 8£CRETh'COl\\UNTh'OR:CON,NOFORl\\J \nVI.

The metadata will carry unique \nmarkings, or \"tags,\" such that software-and other·c ontrols (Including user \nauthentication services) can restrict access to it to authorized personnel who have \nreaard \nreceived appropriate and adequate training with  to the authority.  These tags \nare applied to the rnetadata during the metadata  xocessing stages, \nand remain attached to the metadata as It is stored In the metadata repository. \n(TSJ/Sl/l~IF) The pre-queiy rnetad- ·ng In NSA's PRITT repositories Is hlghly \nsensitive metadata pertaining to  f Internet communications, a substantial \nportion of which will be communications of United States persons located ln the \nUnited States who are not the subject of any FBI investigation. This mal<es tl1!s data \nset unique and extraordinary, and forms the basis for the special access and \nhandling controls NSA wl!I a  I . \nNonetheless, query resu s may stlll fnclude unminimized United States \nperson Information; for this reason, query results must be handled and disseminated \nIn accordance with NSA's legal compliance and minimization procedures (USSID \nSP0018). \ncrsusur.wq PRITT quetyresults will be handled and protected according to USSID~18 \nguidelines.  In addition, the PR/TT provenance of the query results will be preserved \nas the !nformatlon passes from one system or process to another consistent with \nNSA product sourcing requirements.  In particuf ar, NSA policy states that sourcing \ninformation Is necessary for the preparation of intelligence reports (all of which must \nInclude references to the s.ou rces of the information contained therein), and for later \ntracl<ing of any disseminated information..

What Is the reason fol' granting an unlimited number of analysts access to the data? Is \nit because of increased collection? \nNSA:  fFS!ISll/NP') Under previous Court Orders, NSA safeguarded against queries using \nnon-RAS-approved seeds by limiting the number of analysts with authority to query \ntl1e metadata and providing those analysts with special training to emphasize the \nImportance of the proper use of RAS-approved seeds. NSA monitored the \neffectiveness of these safeguards, by logging all analytic queries for auditing \npurposes. \n(T~/.l!illtll'I~) In  NSA Implemented technical controls which bloc!< any \nanalytic query of the metadata with a non-RAS-approved seed.  Accordingly, NSA \nhas not proposed to fimlt the number of analysts with query authority under its \napplication.  However, as also described below In the response to question V.A., \nNSA wlll exercise internf:ll management controls to Identify analysts who may make \nsuch queries. In addition, the logging of.analytic queries will continue to serve as a \ncompliance measure.  NSA ls also seeking expliclt authority to share query results, \nas needed, throughout NSA's analytic enterprise. (This topic is discussed more fully \nin the response to question V.A., below.) \nI \nj \n(TSl.'Sl//~1i;) Yes - contact chaining is the solef  means of query ng  y w 1c i m e 1gence \nanalysts access the raw data. The starting  oint for such queries Is a RAS-approved \n,j \nIdentifier submitted by an authorized ana!ys . The result of a query consists of a  · \nloglca!ly organized presentation of the authorized metadata contained In the PR/TT \nrepository associated wltti a RAS-ap  ler and the metadata that occurred \n·  ·  o s from the seed. \nPage 16 of27 \n·-·~  TOP S EGRETUGOMIMT.UfliOFORW \nI \n\n'.-- r  -· ---·~ - : \n1·, · \"Y'  • • :  ·  .. - •-··  ... -- -· ·· \n-\nTOP S!;;CR!il'/JCO~Ul~lrJ/NOFORN \nD. What is an \"auditable record\" of accesses? What speciffcally will the record conta n? \nDoes this apply only to use of the analytic tools, or to any access of the data? \nNSA:  (TS!fSl/l~IFJ An audltable record Is created each time the PRITT metadata Is queried \nusing an intelligence analysis (IA) query tool.  Analyst utilization of an IA query tool is \nmost typical, but technical support personnel may also utilize an fA query tool in \nsupport of their activities; auditable records are created In either case.  Currently the \nauditable record captures the date/time of the query, the analyst SID (\"Standard ID\", \na unique identifier for each NSA employee), the identifier that was used to query the \nmetadata, and the IP address of the machine used to perform the query. \n(T~/!~l//NF) Technical access to the systems that support the processing, transport, \nand storage of PR/TT metadata is logged consistent with the standards required by \nthe System Security Plans associated with those systems. While the exact format of \nthe logged rec<xds varies according to the specific system, a majority of the technical \nlog r13cords contain: (a) the user performing tl10 action, (b) information about the \nlocation of the user, and (c) a date/time stamp. \nE. What are the reasons for the different expiration dates proposed for RAS \ndeterminations? If FISC orders are used as one basis, why not 90 days for USPs? \nNSA:  (TSl/S!ONF) The proposed dates (180 days for Identifiers believed to be associated \nwith a U.S. person, 365 days for other identifiers) are identical to those approved by \nthe Court beginning In September 2009 (doclcet number BR 09-13) for Business \nRecords (BR) FISA.  In the reality of mission operations, in which analysts wor(< on a \nday-to-day basis with the query results from approved identifiers, it Is typical to revisit \nand reaffirm RAS determinations more frequently than the Court requires.  As new \nInformation becomes available for a particular RAS Identifier it ls promptly assessed. \nThis assessment may result In a decision to revalidate or Invalidate the Identifier. \nNSA seeks to maintain consistency In the expiration dates used by the two \nauthorities In order to reduce possible confusion and support the adoption of \nstandard analytic procedures. \nF. What are the qualifications and training of the 20+ people making RAS \ndeterminations? Is there formal training andfor guidance on application of the standard? \nNSA:  (rsusw~ll>) Currently there are 15 individuals at NSA (of the 23 approved rn the \n~rders) who·m  ake RAS determinations under the BR and PR/TI authorities: All of \n~ \nPage 17 of27 \nI \nj  TOP aliCR!;TJICOMJNT(INOFORN \ni \nJ \n\n-\nthese Individuals have been trained about and understand the requirements for RAS \nand the need for additional OGC review of U.S. person Identifier nomlnati.ons. \n(TS//Bll/NF) In March 2009, NSA established a process for certifying lndivlduals to \nmal<e RAS determinations.  This process consisted of two mandatory steps: a period \nof on-the-Job training provided by already~quallfled Individuals, and an oral test of \nl<nowledge of the applicable requirements jointly administered by SID Oversight & \nCompliance and the NSA's Education and Training organization. All 15 of the \nindividuals who currently make RAS determinations tool< and passed the test \nbetween March and May 2009.  The ce1tificatlon process was designed orig.inally for \nuse within the BR authority; rt is currently undergoing review and revfsion so that rt \nexplicitly applies to both the PRITT and BR authorlties. \n(TBf/OIHtff) NSA carefully selects the analysts to be tralned to mal<e RAS \ndeterminations. While there is no cast-Iron set of qualiflcatlons for this responslbllity, \naH of the 15 people who matrn RAS determinations possess substantial experience \nas \nboth as Intelligence analysts and, specifically,  Intelligence analysts working the \nCT target set.  Currently the group has an average of 8~10 years of experience. In \naddition to possessing deep experience, these Individuals usually carry addltlonal \nfunctional responsibilities as team leaders or senior analysts. \n(TSl/81/JNF) Training and guidance on the RAS standard, Its appllcatlon, and the \nevidence that Is required to meet it, is routinely provided to analysts who worl< with \n·PR/TT and BR metadata.  Senior intel!lgence analysts and NSA's OGC provide this \ntraining as needed. \n. :'  \n·\\  Page 18 of 27 \n+0¥1 S(;CRl5TtfCOMH'>ITl/r.IOF06?N \n\n\n\n\n\n·;· .. ___ ·.  .  .. ..... --.. ..; •-_,;  .. - -.~;: -:. ..._. -...;·-:·.· ·: \n-\nTOP SaCRLW/COMINTl!NOEORN \ntYi~'.QJi$~1t1initi9nI~P.9 ;11,~it~ntLQ;\"ri:-;~~:5.;;:\\·::~·~)~/:{:-!:);$1~~?'{/;:~'.:~·:,. .'.:  ~(L:;i~{-~:)irt( ~~~i~/~:;;~gr;:~;a~1f.l \nA. What is the reason for unlimited internal sharing of query results? Will those to whom \ndissemination is made receive training? \nNSA:  (TS/JalhlMI\") Internal sl1aring of que1y results will not be unlltn!ted; such sharing will be \nstrictly limited to a distinct population within NSA-those individuals who are fully \nlndoctrlnated for USSID-18 and who are also engaged in the analysis and reporting \nof counterterrorlsrn and other relevant foreign intelllgence targets- a process \ndirected and controlled by NSA leadership. No additional PR/TT-metadata-speclfic \ntraining will be required for internal sharing of query results. \n(rn/Jalt/MF) The Government believes that USSID-18-based dissemination processes \nprovide well-tested and consistent procedures for analytic sharing of query results, \nand that they appropriately balance the Government's need for foreign·i ntelligence \ninformation while protecting tl1a privacy Interests of persons under the Fourth \nAmendment.  They afford the highest protections where the privacy Interests of U.S. \nPersons are involved, whether at the point of ~ollect!on, use, or dissemination. \n(TSHOIHNF) Results of queries of PRrfT-sourced metadata are Inherently germane to \nthe analysis of counterterrorlsrn-related foreign [nteltlgence targets. This is because \n_of NSA's adherence to the RAS standard as a prerequisite for querying PR/TT \nmetadata. In order for an Internet communications address to be approved as a \n\"seed\" with which to quer.y the collected metadata, facts must be produced that give \nrise to a reasonab.le, articulable suspicfon that it·  associated with a desi nated \nciated wlth \n(Tausq. . The authority to share the resu s o  quer es  o  -18-\nlndoctrinated inte!llgence analyst population is critical to the success of the NSA's \nc~ssion. NSA's collective expertise in the Foreign Powers resides \nin---inte!!lgence analysts, who sit not only in the NSA's  · \nin \nCounterterrorism Analytic Enterprise, but also  other NSA organizations or product \nlines.  · \n(Talia!)

The overarching purpose for doing so Is to \nproduce better counterterrorlsm intelligence as a consequence of putting PR/TT-\nsourced terrorlsm~related query results into the hands of analysts W!th lrnowledge \n'!!Ill' \nand expertise in other topics or targets relevant to counterterrorlsm.  For example, in \nthe International Security  lntellige  \"' \nI  e•1  Q.

Because so many analysts work to address terrorism-related \nanalysis and reporting requirements from myriad different angles, it Is Impossible to \nestimate how many of these Individuals might b!3 served by the abflity to integrate the \nmetadata resulting from PRITT queries into their analysis. \n(nutal) In addition to requesting authority to expand the sharing of PRITT query \nresults for the reasons described above, NSA also seel<s to increase the number of \nanalysts eligible to query the raw PR/TT metadata repository using RAS-approved \nfdentlflers.  NSA will continue to employ the established, affirmative management \ncontrols and reviews currently In place to vet RAS nominations for their relevance to \ncounterterrorism-related foreign intelligence targets.  In addition, NSA will exercise \nInternal controls to identify analysts who may query the raw PMT metadata using \nRAS-approved Identifiers, and such Individuals wlll receive appropriate training. \nNSA will also apply relevant policies and procedures governing access to raw \nSIGINT databases to the PRITT queries. Technological safeguards and controls, \nsuch as vetted user Interfaces, the EAR, and auditing tools, will continue to restrict \nand log access to the raw PRITT metadata to authorized queries made by authorized \nintelllgence analysts. \n:I  1  u.  It I  I  ~  ta attach to all disseminations, particularly ff It is storecm \n: nd if the information is re-disseminated? \nNSA:  (T~l/Sll/~IF) It may be helpful to describe data marking In terms of three sequential, \nbut distinct, processing stages that PRITT metadata may undergo as it Is \ntransformed from raw collection to published lntelllgence; \n11 Stage 1 -raw, unselected colledlon; \n,. Stage 2 -query results based on a RAS-approved identifier, the sharing and \nanalysis of those results among and by NSA Intelligence analysts and analytic \ntools, and the storage of this Information in NSA databases; and. \nn Stage 3 • intelUgence disseminated to Intelligence Community. customers via \nNSA's reporting mechanisms. \nPage 22 of27 \nTOP SEGRE'FNCOMINl/INOFORN \n\n-\nTOP SFCJWTUCOM!NT//NOFORN \n(TS/JOI/INF)  In Stage 2, metadata selected by RAS queries, and subsequently shared, \nanalyzed, and stored at NSA, will be handled and protected according to USSID-18 \nguidelines. The tagging information used in Stage 1 will still be retained with the \ninitial query results, but It will no longer need to be used as a basts for lnvol~ing the \ntechnical and management controls associated with and required for raw PRITT \nmetadata. \n(TSh'SltlNF) In Stage 3, PRITT query results, and any analytic results arising from It, \nwill be properly minimized prior to their inclusion and dissemination via an \nappropriate reporting vehicle.  Per NSA policy, analysts are required to complete a \nsourcing record for every dissemination.  Sourcing records list the collectlon sources \n{including Pl~/TT metadata) of the information contained in the dissemination.  NSA \ndoes not Include source lnfom1ation, or the sourcing record, in the actual \ndissemln  ·  ·  ver source Information is retrievable by NSA If \n·red. \nC. Post-query and pre-dissemination, what safeguards are in place to ensure  a  e \nquery and its results were in compliance with the RAS determination and any other query \nrestrictions? \nNSA:  Since the Emphatic Access Restric.R) was put lnto place • \n, SID Oversight & Compliance  has conducted a complete {100 \npercent) au  1 of all PR/TI metadata queries, an  Is audit has confirmed that there \nhas been no Inappropriate access to the sensitive PR/TT metadata via lntell!gence \nanalysis tools.  Compliance audits have determined that the EAR has prevented all \nqueries on non-RAS approved identifiers from accessing the metadata. NSA intends \nto continue with full auditing capability of all queries using Intelligence analysis query \ntools.  .  · \nD. What is the govt.'s current thinking on dissemination requirements: only USSID-18, or \nsome case-specific requirements also? When do you expect to liave a final proposal on \nthis issue? \nNSA:  (TS/ISl/lNF) NSA seeks to Implement the standard USSID-18 guidelines for the \nhandling, internal NSA analytic sharing, and external dissemination of metadata \ninformation obtained or derived ·from PRITT accesses. The Government expects to \nprov.Ide a proposal to the Court by no tater than  The Government \nwould welcome the opportunity to discuss the factual and legal issues regarding \nImplementation of the proposal. \nE. Will there be, and what is the feasibility for, auditable records on dissemination and re-\ndlsseminatlon? \nNSA:  (SlfSl//REL) NSA maintains written records of Intelligence reports and other \nInformation disseminated to its lntell!gence customers; it is through review of these \nrecords that NSA has been able to provide the Court with its weekly dissemination \nreports.  Included among these records are records of the releases of United States \nperson Identifying information and the facts that supported t11ose release decisions. \nIn this respect, NSA already has auditable records on disseminated information, \nalthough not all al!ditlng capabilities are automated, \n(SNSl/fREL) Recipients of NSA's Jntelligence reports or information are provided \nguidance on any requirements or restrictions on follow-on use or handling of \nthe Information, by means of the caveats included with the information. Although \nthese caveats help to ensure that recipients are compliant with any such \nrequirements or restrictions, NSA can monitor compliance with these caveats only \nthrough the cooperative efforts of all of the other Intelligence Community agenoles. \n·-·~ \nPage 23 of27 \nTOP SEGRfiTl/COMIMTl/~JOEORN \n\n-.-\"'.\".,':/' :-\n-\nTOP !ileG!'11iiT.l/COMINTUNOFORN \nF. Why is the retention time changed to 60 months (5 years}, vs. 54 months? \nNSA: . (SffSl/fREL) Tile PRffT retention time was changed from 54 months to 60 months to \ndevelop and maintain consistency with the BR FISA Order.  As described above in \nour response to Question 4 (E), NSA seeks to achieve consistency in the \nimplementation of FISA procedures whenever possible. \n!.\\l.1.~IR,:~'pgrti/?tr~·~rjJ_f19·Htv~~·~i9ti.tf)~~;?~<~t~f.2~'.~;.~_:r;::,;.;:,~:1L:~¥.f.:2~·fiH'.~ih~;~t~-~}J~1l.~l~I \nA. Why is the dissemination report requirement dropped? \nNSA:  (TSl/SIHNF) NSA has provided the Court with the total number of disseminated \n· intelligence reports containing PRITT~derived Information as part of Its renewal \napplications,  NSA intends to continue to provide the Court this number, and stands \nready to provide the Court with additional Information at any time. \n(TS!JSl!/NF) NSA excluded from the curre~he weekly dissemination \nreport that the Court had required slnce----because ·of other changes to \nthe proposed .collectlon, notably the proposed change to USSID~18 for internal. \nsharing and dissemination.  Prior PR/TT Orders imposed unique procedures and \nrequirements for the dissemination of PR/TT-derived fnformatlon outside of NSA. \nFor example, to release United States person Identifying information derived from \nE.O. 12333 metadata In a report, NSf\\'s Chief of Information Sharing Se1vices (or \none of a few other specified NSA leaders) must determine that the identity Is \nnecessary to understand tile foreign fntelllgence in the report. To release similar \nUnited States person l<;lentlfylng i.nformation derived from PR/TT metadata, a smaller \nsubset of NSA leaders must determine that the Identity Is necessary to understand \nthe counterterrorism Information In the report.  The weekly dissemination report \nserved an important oversight function within this unique PRITT dissemination \nframework; it was in this report that NSA confirmed that the appropriate findings had \nbeen made by the proper decision mal<ers.  The current application departs from this \nhistoric framework, and proposes to apply NSA's standard, U~SID~18-deflned \ndissemination procedures to PR/TT-derived Information as these procedures form \nthe very backbone for virtually all of NSA's dissemination practices.  For this reason, \nNSA believes that a weekly dissemination report is no longer necessary. \nB. It appears that the compliance meetings and NSA OGC spot checks have been \nmodified from the previous order. . Can you detail these changes and provide the bases \nfor them? \nNSA: \n~p ca  on see<s au  or  o \n~nd no longer emphasizes  o  e \nmetadata, spot checks to confirm these characteris cs are no onger necessary. \n(Sf/sWReL) The ellmination of the OGG spot checl<s should not be construed as \nabandonment of any periodic or aperiodic monitoring of the functioning of the \ncollection.  Many of these are written into the application.  In terms of ensuring that· \nonly authorized categories or types of information are bt?ing collected, the appllcatlon \ncalls for a periodic meeting between NSA's OGC, Office of the Director of \nPage 24 of 27 \nTOP SEGReT//COMIMT\"~IOFORN \n'i \n\n-\nCompllance (ODOC), and the National Security Division of the Department of Justice \n{NSD/DoJ) to review the metadata collected.  Moreover, NSA's OGG and NSD/DoJ \nwill continue to review a sample of justifications for RAS approvals for identifiers \nused to queiy the PRffT metadata.  Flnally, NSA's OGC, as well as the ODOC and \nother oversight and compliance organizations, will continue to examine NSA's \nprocesses antj practices to ensure compliance with the Court's orders.  Nonetheless, \nNSA seeks to retain the discretion to implement any number of oversight \nmechanisms and to change those mechanisms over time rn response to changing \nconcerns. \nC. Please describe In detail ~he oversight authorities that will be exercised. \nNSA:  (Ts.'lSh'JNF) With re·spect to oversight of the authorities In the proposed collection, \nNSA (Including OGG, ODOC, and the Inspector General), DOJ, and ODNI will \nconduct oversight as outllned In the appllcatlon.  Among other oversight \nmechanisms, the application contemplates periodic meetings to assess compfiance, \nincludlng a review of the metadata collected to ensure tl1at only those categories or \ntypes of Information described In the appllcat!on are being collected, and reviews of a \nsample of the justifications for RAS approvals for identifiers used to query the \nmetadata.. \n(TS/1011/NF)  In addition to these oversight activities specific to the application, NSA is \nengaged in developing and implementing a comprehensive compliance program that \nIs applicable to this collection as well as NSA's other collections. \n1.  (U/ffffiffi) Compliance and oversight are two parts of the same coin.  Each is \nnecessary to ensure that the Court-ordered activities remain lawful.  Compliance \nIs a management function designed to deliver (not oversee) well-pfanned, \neffective, and comprehensive compliance activities.  Compliance starts wltb a set \nof rules (the Order), ensures.a shared understanding among technical, \noperational, and.legal personnel, and then puts In place managerial controls, \nawareness, training, monitoring, and technical safeguards to reach !=lnd maintain \ncompliance. Oversight Is an independent review focused on the qua!i1y and \nperformance of the compliance program.  Both are absolutely necessary, but one \ndoes not make up for the other. \n2.  (U/IRWG) The compliance and oversight efforts at NSA-and the oversight \nefforts at DO.J, ODNI, and DOD - go substantially beyond what Is written in the \nDIRNSA's declaration pr proposed Order.  Effective compliance and oversight \nare not performed simply through meetings or spot checks. Compliance and \noyerslght are continuous efforts that require contlnu,ous management within a \nstructure that promotes a shared understanding of the applicable rules and the \nrequirements necessary to implement such rules. \n3.  (T8//Sl/fNF) Accordingly, compliance and oversight activities and resources must \nbe applfed comprehensively across all NSA operations, systems, and people. \nThe PR/TT program, lil<e others at NSA, leverag~ multiple parts of the NSA \ncommunity.  · \n4.  (TS/JSll/Ni;') The Director of Compliance, In support of that continuous \nmanagement approach, has Instituted important structural and managerial \nimprovements at NSA, in particular: \na.  Th'a appointment of an Associate Director for Special Compliance Activities \nto focus on compliance wltl1 the BR and PRJTT FISA Orders. In partlcu!ar, \nthis role ensures a continuous focus on a shared understanding among \ntechnlcar, operational, policy, and regal personnel in both the drafting and \nimplementation of the Orders. \nPage 25 of 27 \nTOP SECRETNCOMIMTtJNOIOORN \n\n-\nTOP SEGRlil!ICOMIMT//bJOEDRN \nb.  The formation of a technology compliance office to ensure that system \ndevelopers are properly trained, made aware of the requirements and \nrestrictions In the Orders, and NSA prioritizes the C1Ctual implementation of \nImportant technical safeguards. \nc.  Clarifying, through written documentation and. In-person discussions with  . \nNSA Senior Leaders, specific roles and responsibilities with respect to \ncompliance efforts.  Governance is one of the keys to a successful \ncompliance program across NSA and one of the primary efforts to date !las \nbeen clarifying those roles and responsibilities. \nd.  The use of documented verlftcatlon procedures developed In conjunction \nwith DOJ and ODNI to ensure that every statement In the NSA Declarations \nis appropriately checked for accuracy and completeness and, upon receipt \nof an Order, that every requirement is assigned a clear owner and that \nthere is a shared understanding about each requirement.  Furthermore, \nODOC, working with others, monitors the imp!ementatlons of these \n/ \nrequirements using a risl<-based methodology. \ne.  Initiated meetings between NSA's Director of Compliance and OGG, DOJ, \nand ODNl on a regular periodic basis (currently weekly) to discuss \ncompliance and oversight matters. \nf.  With respect to the PRITT program, the Office of the Director of \nCompliance will monitor the configuration governing the extraction of \nspecific metadata fields to ensure robust compliance with the Order, \nrecognizing this as a high-risk area for compllance issues. \ng.  Continued focus on training for the BR and PRffT Orders.  In the latter part \nof 2009, NSA finished its online course (which was previously clelivered in~ \nperson) covering the BR-FISA program and was close to completion of the \nonllne PR/TT course (which is on hold pending a new Order).  These \ncourses allow NSA personnel to receive timely guidance In a consistent \nformat to increase a shared understanding ·of the requirements and \nrestrictions of these speclal FISA programs. \nh.  SA would continue \nto focus on the perio  c rev ew o · a represen a 1ve  pie of RAS approved \nIdentifiers accompanied by the ability to audit all queries into the PR/TT \nmetadata. \ni.  More generally, the formation of a Compliance Panel of the NSA Advisory \nBoard, to provide external advice and guidance to the compliance activities \nat NSA.  This Panel Includes representatives from the legal profession, \nIndustry privacy officers, academia, qnd Industry compliance offices. \n5.  (UHFette) Recognizing the Importance of a comprehensive approach, the NSA \nOf rector of Compliance Is prepared at the Court's convenience to discuss in \ndetail the specific items listed above or more generally the approach and plan for \ncontinuing future improvements to file compliance program. \nHas there been consideration of periodic and aperiodic monitoring to ensure \ncompliance?  ·  · \nNSA:  (TSllSl/fNF) Yes.  NSA has given substantial consideration to periodic and aperiodic \nmonitoring and is committed to Implementing and Improving these activities.  As \nODOC establishes a Comprehensive Mission Compllance Program, one of the pillars \nPaga 26 of 27 \nTOP SECRETl-/COMIM+!fll10FO~W \n\n• ''\"°'\"'  ••-,- '  r•,,._.,.,~ • ·~·•  • ,...

Analytic tools used in ongoing investigations enable the \nGovernment to sift through and identify terrorist communications. Use of such tools requires the \ncollection of and access to bulk quantities of metadata associated with Internet communications \n1 \n(not including the substance, meaning, or purport of any communications) . The pen register and \ntrap and trace provisions of Title N  of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as \namended, authorize the Government to obtain such access.2   (TSl/SI//NF) \nIn a series of authorization orders issued betwe~n July 2004 and  this Court \nauthorized bulk pen register collection under FISA.  0 \nexpired, and the Court issued an order generally barring access to stored metadata that was \ncollected during the preceding 4Y2 years. The current Application seeks authority to reinitiate \nbulk pen register collection on terms similar, but not identical, to those authorized in the prior \n· orders, and to access the previously collected metadata.  (TS//SJl/NF) \n2 For simplicity, we use the term \"pen register\" in this document to include both pen registers and trap and \ntrace device.s.  (U) \nTOP SECRETt/HCS/COMJNTi~'ORCON,NOFORN \n2 \n\nTOP 8ECRETHHC8/COMINT/IORCON,NOFORN \nThe Court's prior orders allowed NSA to conduct surveillance o \nRegisters and Trap and Trace Devices for Foreign Intelligence Purposes (\"Application\") seeks \nauthority to conduct pen register surveillance on \nhis issue is discussed in more \ndetail in Part I.C.2. of this Memorandum.  (T~~Jil/SYMF) \n2.  Metadata.  The prior authorization orders allowed NSA to acquire certain types of \nmetadata from e-mail  although as described \nP~ \nin the Report of the United States in docket number  filed on \n(\"Compliance Report\"), NSA was also collecting other types of metadata outside the scope of \nthe prior orders. The new Application seeks authority to acquire all of the metadata NSA was \npreviously acquiring, including metadata fro \nhe Application also seeks access to all previously collected \nmetadata now residing in NSA's databases, because that metadata, some of which was obtained \nin violation of the Court's prior orders, is nonetheless within the scope of the pen register \nstatutes, the Fourth Amendment, and the current proposed authorization order, and is essential to \nthe proper functioning of the pen register surveillance program.  This issue is discussed in more \ndetail in Parts I, II, and III of this Memorandum. (TSf/SI//NF) \nmP-SECRET//HC8/COMINT//ORCON,NOFOR..1'l \n3 \n\nTOP 8ECRET//HC8/COMINTUORCON,NOFORN \n3.  Minimization.  The prior authorization orders required adherence to certain \nminimization procedures, particularly with respect to the handling of query results that have been \nsimplified or eliminated in the Application.  We believe that certain of these procedures are \nunnecessary because query results represent a relatively small amount of information that is most \nrelevant to foreign intelligence needs.  In light of the requirement that analysts may query the \nbulk metadata only with an identifier3 as to which there is reasonable, articulable suspicion \n(\"RAS\") that it is used by one oft he identified targets, query results are effectively needles \ndrawn from the haystack. Accordingly, this Application proposes adherence to the standards set \nout in United States Signals Intelligence Directive No. SP0018 (1993) (\"USSID 18\") to any \nresults from queries of the metadata disseminated outside ofNSA in any form. In addition, prior \nto disseminating any U.S. person information outside NSA, certain NSA officials must \ndetermine that the information identifying the U.S. person is in fact related to counterterrorism \ninformation and is necessary to understand the counterterrorism information or assess its \nimportance. This issue is discussed in more detail in Part III.C.3. of this Memorandum. \n(TS/ISJi~W) \n*  *  * \ndiscussion~-\nThis memorandum has two main parts.  It begins with a background \n(\"Foreign Powers\") targeted in the Application, the threat they pose, their use ·of \nthe Internet, and the relevance and value to U.S. national security of metadata collection in bulk. \nThe background discussion also summarizes how the bulk data is analyzed and some of the \nTOP 8ECRET//HC8/COMINTUORCON,NOFOR.\"'J \n4 \n\nTOP 8ECRETI/HC8/COMINTi/OR:CON,NOFORN \noversight mechanisms that apply to that analysis.  The memorandum then sets out a legal \nanalysis of the bulk metadata collection proposed in the Application, including a summary of \nargument and a detailed legal argument.  The legal argument addresses, among other things, the \nscope of the applicable pen register statutes, the relevance of the data collected, the nature of the \nmetadata proposed to be collected under those statutes, the constitutionality of such collection \nunder the Fourth Amendment, and the issue of access to previously collected metadata that now \nresides in Government databases.  (TSl/SI//NF) \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Foreign Powers Threat (U) \nAs demonstrated in previous filings by the Government in matters before this Court, the \nForeign Powers targeted in the attached Application present persistent, lethal, and long-term \nthreats to the United States and its interests abroad.  A document recovered fro \nDeclaration of Michael E. Leiter, Director of the National Counterterrorism Center (''NCTC\") \n(filed at docket number- (''NCTC Declaration\"), at 6. At the same time, according to the \nU.S. Intelligence Community (IC), \n- Id.  The following summary oft he threats posed by these Foreign Powers is supported \nby the NCTC Declaration, which provides greater detail on the targeted Foreign Powers' terrorist \nactivities.

Foreign Powers' Use of the Internet \"\"(S)-\nAs explained in detail in the Declaration of General Keith B. Alexander, U.S. Army, \nDirector of the NSA (\"DIRNSA\") in support of the Application (the \"DIRNSA Declaration\"), \nterrorists use Internet communications for many of the same reasons as the average person: • \nTOP 8ECRETHllC8/COMlNT/IORCON,NOFOR~ \n8 \n\nTOP 8ECRET/IHC8fCOMINTt/Oll-CON,NOFOR1'T \nd.  Use by terrorists of the specific techniques noted \nabove and detailed in the DIRNSA Declaration demonstrates why it is necessary for NSA to \ncollect and maintain access to a repository ofb  ulk metadata associated with Internet \ncommunications in order to best protect against acts of international terrorism against the United \nStates and its interests.  (SHSI) \nWhile all Internet communications are potentially the source of valuable foreign \nintelligence information, NSA believes that metadata associated wit \nparticular importance.

Discovering the Enemy:  Metadata Analysis  (T8H8l/fNF) \nWhile the Foreign Powers' exploitation of the Internet poses a daunting challenge to the \nIC, it also presents a great opportunity.  As summarized above and described in greater detail in \nthe DIRNSA Declaration \nAnalysis of the metadata from this Internet traffic can be a powerful tool for discovering \nenemy communications.  However, Foreign Powers take affirmative and intentional steps to \nTOP 8ECRET//HC8/COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN \n10 \n\nTOP 8ECRETJ!HC8/COMINTNORCON,NOFORN \ncommunications in the billions ofb its of Internet traffic, however, is like finding a needle in a \nhaystack.  For analysts to have the best chance at finding the terrorists, they need a mechanism to \nconvert the Internet stream of communications traffic into something that can be searched in a \ntargeted way.  The mechanism for accomplishing that is the extraction of the metadata from the \nstream of Internet communications (without collecting the content of the communications) and \nstoring it in a database for later analysis.  Collecting metadata is the best avenue for solving this \nfundamental problem: although investigators do not know exactly where the terrorists' \ncommunications are hiding in the billions of bits of data flowing through the United States today, \nwe do know that they are there, and if we place the metadata in a repository now, we will be able \nto use it in a targeted way to find the terrorists tomorrow.  See id. ,ii 21-23.  (TS//Sb'fNF) \nCollecting metadata from that stream creates invaluable capabilities for analysts that are \notherwise unavailable. Most significantly, it allows for retrospective \"contact chaining.\" See id. \nBy examining metadata that has been collected over a period of time, analysts can search to find \nthe contacts associated with that \"seed\" identifier.  The ability to see who communicates with \nwhom may lead to the discovery of other terrorist operatives, or it may help to identify hubs or \ncommon contacts between targets of interest whose relationships were previously unknown. \nIndeed, NSA's systems would automatically identify not only the first tier of contacts made by \nthe seed, but also the contacts associated with the first tier identifiers.  Id. ,, 22-25, n.12.  Going \nTOP 8ECRETh'HC8/COMINTNORCON,NOFOR..~ \n11 \n\nTOP 8ECRET//IIC8/COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN \nout to the \"second hop\" enhances the ability of analysts to find additional terrorist connections. \nA seed e-mail address, for example, may be in touch with several e-mail addresses previously \nunknown to analysts. Following the contact chain out to the second hop to examine the contacts \nmade by those e-mail addresses may reveal a contact that connects back to a different terrorist \nassociated e-mail address already known to the analyst.  Id. if 24 n.12.  (TSh'SY/NF) \nThe capabilities offered by such searching of collected metadata are vastly more powerful \nthan chaining that might be performed through prospective pen registers targeted at individual e \nmail accounts.  If investi  ators find a new identifier whe \nability to trace terrorist connections by chaining two steps out from the original target.  Instead, \nto find that second tier of contacts, a new individual pen register would have to be targeted at \neach e-mail account identified in the first tier.  The time it would take to acquire the new pen \nregisters would necessarily mean losing valuable data.  And the data loss in the most critical \ncases would only be increased by terrorists' propensity for frequently changing their e-mail \naddresses. Id. if 27.  (TSh'SYMF) \nAs proposed in the Application, analysts would query the bulk data with e-mail addresses \nor other identifiers as to which there is reasonable, articulable suspicion (\"RAS\") that the \nTOP SECRET//HCS/COMINTI/ORCON,NOFORN \n12 \n\nTOP SECRETJ/HCS/COMINTt/ORCON,NOFORN \nidentifier is associated with one of the targeted Foreign Powers or individuals.  Id. ,ii 24, 31. \nSuccessful exploitation of the Internet communications of \nthe Foreign Powers requires that NSA is in a constant state of development and discovery, as the \nMetadata analysis contributes to this \ncritical target monitoring, development and discovery by providing information that an analyst \ncan use to determine various intelligence information, including but not limited to \nId. iI 25.  Thus, the collected metadata provides an invaluable capability that could \nnot be reproduced through any other mechanism because it allows analysts to bridge the gap \nbetween a known identifier and an unknown identifier, even where a terrorist has practiced strict \noperations security. (TS//SJ//NF) \nB.  Targeting the Relevant Data for Collection (S) \nPerforming the metadata analysis described above necessarily requires collecting data in \nbulk.  In other words, it entails collecting data on a significant number of communications that \nwill not ever be found to have a connection with terrorists.  The breadth of the collection, \nhowever, is necessary.  The very reason for collecting the data to preserve it for later analysis is \nTOP 8ECRET//HC8/COMINTt/ORCON,NOFOR.~ \n13 \n\nTOP 8ECRETNHC8/COMJNTllORCON,NOFORN \nEffective metadata analysis requires broad collection and archiving of \nmetadata.  See id.~~ 21-22.  (T8,l/£If/WF) \nAs discussed in more detail in Part II ohhis memorandum, that is consistent with the pen register \nstatutes, which require specification of the \"location\" ofrelevant facilities, \"if known.\" 50 \nU.S.C. § 1842(d )(2)(A)(iii).  (TSJ/8I/~W) \nUnder the Application, NSA's extraction ofmetadata would focus upon certain \ncategories of data that are present  In \nparticular, the NSA's current metadata collection efforts are focused o  es of data that fit \nategories.

Id. iii! 23-24. \n(TSHSif/NF) \nAll of the information collected by NSA's collection and retention systems would be \nsubject to validation at collection and some of it would be subjected to multi-level validation \nbefore being stored in the NSA's repositories.

Id. ii 13 n.6. Without access \nto that data, there will be a substantial gap in the information available to NSA.  Id.  (TS//Sit/WP) \nTOP 8ECRET//HC8/COMINTNORCON,NOFOR~ \n16 \n\nTOP SECRETl/HCS/COM:INTl/ORCON;NOFOR..~ \nSecond, NSA will apply the procedures to ensure appropriate dissemination of the \nmetadata. NSA will apply the minimization and dissemination requirements and procedures of \nSection 7 ofUSSID 18 to any results from queries of the metadata disseminated outside ofNSA \nin any form.  Id. 'if 32.  In addition, prior to disseminating any U.S. person information outside \nNSA, one of the officials listed in Section 7.3(c) ofUSSID 18 (i.e., the Director ofNSA, the \nDeputy Director ofNSA, the Director of the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID), the Deputy \nDirector of the SID, the Chief of the Information Sharing Services (ISS) office, the Deputy Chief \nof the ISS office, and the Senior Operation Officer of the National Security Operations Center) \n~ust determine that the information identifying the U.S. person is in fact related to \ncounterterrorism information and that it is necessary to understand the counterterrorism \ninformation or assess its importance. Id.  (TS//Sf/~W) \nThird, NSA's collection, access, and dissemination of information obtained pursuant to \nthe authority requested in the Application will be subject to rigorous internal and external \noversight.  At NSA, the Office of the Director of Compliance (ODOC), the Office of the General \nCounsel (OGC), and the Inspector General (IG) will conduct oversight of the activities described \nin the Application and Declaration; oversight will also be conducted by the National Security \nDivision (NSD) of the Department of Justice (DOJ).  In addition, the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence (ODNI) has independent responsibility over the IC and must ensure that \nNSA's intelligence activities are conducted in compliance with the law.  Accordingly, ODNI \npersonnel may participate in the oversight activities described below.  Specifically: \n(i)  NSA's OGC and Office of the Director of Compliance (ODOC) will \nensure that personnel with access to the metadata receive appropriate and adequate \ntraining and guidance regarding the procedures and restrictions for collection, storage, \nanalysis, dissemination, and retention of the metadata and the results of queries of the \nmetadata and will maintain records of such training.  OGC will provide NSD/DoJ with \nTOP SECRET//HC8/CO:MINT/-/ORCON,NOFOR..~ \n17 \n\nTOP 8ECRETHHC8/COMINT/IORCON,NOFORN \ncopies of all formal briefing and/or training materials (including all revisions thereto) \nused to brief/train NSA personnel concerning this authority. \n(ii)  NSA's ODOC will monitor the implementation and use of the software \nand other controls (including user authentication services) and the logging of auditable \ninformation referenced above. \n(iii)  NSA's OGC will consult with NSD/DoJ on all significant legal opinions \nthat relate to the interpretation, scope, and/or implementation of this authority.  When \noperationally practicable, such consultation shall occur in advance; otherwise NSD will \nbe notified as soon as practicable. \n(iv)  At least once during the authorization period, NSA's OGC, ODOC, \n. NSD/DoJ, and any other appropriate NSA representatives will meet for the purpose of \nassessing compliance with this Court's orders.  Included in this meeting will be a review \nof the metadata collected to ensure that only those categories or types of information \ndescribed in Tab 2 are being collected.  The results of this meeting will be reduced to \nwriting and submitted to the Court as part of any application to renew or reinstate the \nauthority requested herein. \n(v)  At least once during the authorization period, NSD/DoJ will meet with \nNSA 's Office of the Inspector General to discuss their respective oversight \nresponsibilities and assess NSA's compliance with the Court's orders. \n(vi)  At least once during the authorization period, NSA's OGC and NSD/DoJ \nwill review a sample of the justifications for RAS approvals for identifiers used to query \nthe metadata. \n(vii)  Prior to implementation, all proposed automated query processes will be \nreviewed and approved by NSA's OGC, NSD/DoJ, and the Court. \nDIRNSA Deel.~ 34. (T8//8I//NF) \nFinally, approximately every thirty days, NSA shall file with the Court a report that \nincludes a discussion of the queries made since the last report and NSA's application of the RAS \nstandard.  In addition, should the Government seek renewal of the requested authority, NSA shall \nalso include in its report detailed information regarding any new facility proposed to be added to \nsuch authority and a description of any changes proposed in the collection methods, to include \nfunctioning and control of the pen registers and trap and trace devices.

The pen register provisions in FISA authorize the Government to apply to the Court \n\"for an order ... authorizing or approving the installation or use of a pen register or trap and \ntrace device\" where two essential requirements are met.  50 U.S.C. § 1842(a)(l).5  (U) \nThe first requirement is that the pen register be installed or used for certain specified \ninvestigations. Id.  In particular, a pen register may be sought \"for any investigation to obtain \nforeign intelligence information not concerning a United States person or to protect against \ninternational terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, provided that such investigation of a \nUnited States person is not conducted solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first \namendment to the Constitution which is being conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nunder such guidelines as the Attorney General approves pursuant to Executive Order No. 12333, \nor a successor order.\" Id.  (V) \nIn this case, as explained in more detail in the Application, DIRNSA Declaration, and \nNCTC Declaration, the pen register order is sought for investigations to protect against \ninternational terrorism b \nas well as other unknown persons in the United States and abroad who are affiliated with them. \nThese investigations are being conducted by the FBI pursuant to guidelines approved by the \nAttorney General pursuant to Executive Order 12333, as amended, and to the extent the subjects \nof investigation are United States persons, the investigations are not being conducted solely on \nthe basis of activities protected by the First Amendment. See 50 U.S.C. § 1842(a)(l). Thus, the \n5 The argument Section contains a more complete discussion of all requirements for issuance of a pen \nregister order. This summary focuses only on the most significant requirements. (U) \nTOP SECRETNHCS/COMINTil/ORCON,NOFORN \n19 \n\nTOP 8EC:RET//HC8/COM:INT//ORCON,NOFORN \nfirst requirement in the statute is met.  In this respect, the current Application is no different from \nApplications previously granted by this Court.  (TSHSI/J}.ff) \nThe second requirement is that the pen register Application include a \"certification by the \napplicant that the information likely to be obtained is foreign intelligence information not \nconcerning a United States person or is relevant to an ongoing investigation to protect against \ninternational terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(2). In this \ncase, as explained in more detail in the DIRNSA Declaration and elsewhere in the Application, \nthe information sought by the pen register is \"foreign intelligence information\" which is relevant \nto ongoing investigations to protect against international terrorism that are not being conducted \nsolely upon the basis of activities protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. Thus, \nthe second requirement is met. The essential theory of relevance advanced in the current \nApplication remains what it was in prior Applications granted by the Court - i.e., that data \ncollected in bulk is relevant to the ongoing investigations because of the analysis that bulk \ncollection permits, even if the vast majority of the collected metadata does not in fact pertain to \nany terrorist.  (TS//SIHNF) \nWhere the requirements are met, the statute provides that a judge of this Court \"shall \nenter an ex parte order as requested, or as modified, approving the installation and use of a pen \nregister or trap and trace device.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1842(d)(l). The Court's order itself must satisfy \nthree main requirements that are set forth in the statute.  (U) \nFirst, the order \"shall specify\" the \"identity, if known, of the person who is the subject of \nthe investigation.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1842(d)(2)(A)(i).  In this case, as discussed above and in the \nDIRNSA Declaration and elsewhere, the \"persons\" who are the subjects of the investigations are \nthe Foreign Powers and unknown persons in the United States and abroad who are affiliated with \nTOP SECRET.l/llCS/COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN \n20 \n\nTOP 8ECRETHIIC8/COl\\flNTHOR:CON,NOFOR\"\"l \nthem.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(a), (m), 1841(1) (definition of \"person\" includes foreign powers, \nsuch as international terrorist groups and foreign governments). Again, in this respect the current \nApplication is no different than other Applications previously granted by the Court. \n(TS/fSf//NF) \nSecond, the Court's order must also specify \"the identity, if known, of the person to \nwhom is leased or in whose name is hsted the telephone line or other facility to which the pen \nregister or trap and trace device is to be attached or applied.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1842(d )(2)(a)(ii).  In \nthis case, as discussed in the DIRNSA Declaration, those persons are certain providers of \ntelecommunications and related services,  ee 50 U.S.C. §§ 180l(m), 1841(1) \n(definition of \"person\" includes corporations).  Prior Applications likewise applied to \ntelecommunications providers.  (TSHSW) \nThird and finally, the Court's order must specify the \"attributes of the communications to \nwhich the order applies, such as the number or other identifier, and, if known, the location of the \ntelephone line or other facility to which the pen register or trap and trace device is to be attached \nor applied and, in the case of a trap and trace device, the geographic limits of the trap and trace \norder.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1842(d)(2)(a)(iii). The current AppHcationproposes a different approach to \nthis third and final element of the Court's order.  (TS//Sf//NF) \na.  At the outset, the current Application would expand the list of\"attributes\" of \ncommunications that may be collected.  Prior orders authorized collection o.categories of \nmetadata from e-mail  ommunications, and the current Application refers to \nTOP SECRETllHCS/COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN \n21 \n\nTOP SECRET/./HCS/COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN \nexplained in Tab 2 to the DIRNSA Declaration, NSA will not collect any \nwithout the Court's prior approval.  (TSHS!m\"W) \nAs explained in Part LC. of this Memorandum, all of the metadata to be collected under \nthe current Application - including metadata types not previously authorized for collection- are \nwithin the scope of the pen register statutes, because all are \"dialing, routing, addressing, and \nsignaling information\" and none is \"contents.\"6  Congress did not define the terms \"dialing, \nrouting, addressing, or signaling information,\" and these terms should be read in accordance with \ntheir broad ordinary meaning.  Even if some of the metadata that is the subject of the Application \nis not \"dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling\" information, it may still be collected under the \npen register statutes, because the statutes may be read to permit a pen register to acquire all \ncommunications information other than the \"contents\" of communications. That interpretation \nfollows from the text of the statute and the legislative history of the USA PATRIOT Act.  Pub. \nL. No. 107-56, § 206, 115 Stat. 272, 282 (2001).  (TSf/SIJINF) \n6 As the Court is aware, the terms \"pen register\" and \"trap and trace device\" as used in FISA are defined in \n18 U.S.C. § 3127, part of the U.S. Code chapter governing pen register surveillance in criminal cases.  50 U.S.C. § \n1841(2). Under Section 3127(3), a \"pen register\" is a device or process which \"records or decodes dialing, routing, \naddressing, or signaling information transmitted by. an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic \ncommunication is transmitted, provided, however, that such infonnation shall not include the contents of any \ncommunication.\" Similarly, a trap and trace device is a device or process which \"captures the incoming electronic \nor other impulses which identify the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling \ninformation reasonably likely to identify the source of a wire or electronic communication, provided, however, that \nsuch information shall not include the contents of any communication.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3127(4). (T~l/:!iY,lNF) \nIt is difficult to provide a one-to-one comparison between what was collected in the past pen register \nprogram and in the current Application because the types of data have been re-organized in this Application to \nprovide a better organizational framework. That said, the general description of data that is sou ht under this \nA  Ii cation that was not the sub· ect of any of the previous orders are metadat \nSee DIRNSA Deel. Tab 2. The Compliance Report filed in docket PR/ \nrovides an exhaustive account of the specific types ofmetadata that were collected outside the authority of the \nprevious pen register Orders. The authority sought in this Application includes the authority to collect that \nmetadata, which the Government submits may be lawfully collected under the authority of the pen register statute. \n(TS//Sf//~~F) \nTOP SECRET//HCS/COMINT//ORCON,NOFOR~ \n22 \n\nTOP SECRET/IHCS/COMINTNORCON,NOFORN \nCongress intended the USA PATRIOT Act's amendments to \"reinforce the statutorily \nprescribed line between a communication's contents and non-content information\" - a line that it \ncharacterized as \"identical to the constitutional distinction drawn by tbe U.S. Supreme Court in \nSmith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 741-43 (1979).\" H.R. Rep. No. 107-236, at 53 (2001).  In \nother words, \"dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information\" and \"contents\" may be \nread as mutually exclusive categories that together define the universe of information that might \nbe acquired (with the appropriate authorization) from a wire or electronic communication. \nAccordingly, a pen register may collect all non-content information from the communications \npassing through the transmission facility to which it is attached or applied, where \"content\" is \ndefined as \"any information concerning the substance, pmport, or meaning of' a wire or \nelectronic communication.  18 U.S.C. §§ 2510(8), 3127(1).7  (TS,L/Sil/NF) \n7 Even ifthe Court were to disagree with this conclusion, and identify some intermediate data that are \nneither \"contents\" nor \"dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information,\" a pen register may collect that \nintermediate data. To qualify as a pen register, a device or process must capture, record or decode dialing, routing, \naddressing, and signaling information, but nothing in the statutory definition forbids the additional acquisition of \nother information transmitted by a wire or electronic communications facility, as long as that other information is \nnot content or billing information.

The statute defines a pen \nregister as a device or process that records or decodes addressing information \"transmitted by an \ninstrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted,\" as long as \nthe information is not \"contents,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3127(3). As proposed in the Application, NSA's \npen registers will record and decode metadata ·only from Internet communications that are \ntransmitted on the facilities identified in Tab 1 to the DIRNSA Declaration, includin \nb.

(TS//S11/NF) \n2.  The collection and use of the bulk metadata sought in the Application is consistent \nwith the Fourth Amendment.  See Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979). In Smith, the Court \nheld that \"the installation and use of a pen register\" was not a \"search\" under the Fourth \nAmendment.  Id. at 736. Like the pen register in Smith, the pen register in this matter will \nacquire only the non-content attributes of communications indistinguishable from addressing \ninformation voluntarily conveyed to third parties.  It therefore does not implicate the Fourth \nAmendment.  (TS//Sl//NF) \nEven if the Fourth Amendment protected some of the collected informatio \ncollection of that information would be reasonable, and therefore \nconstitutional, in light of the unique protections governing the pen register bulk collection \nprogram, and under the \"special needs\" doctrine recognized by the Supreme Court and the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review.  See, e.g., Griffin v.  Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, \n~ ifthe Court disagreed with that assertion, and concluded that there ar \n---itw ould not affect the analysis, because FISA does not require specification of individual facilities \nfor pen register surveillance, but only the \"location of the telephone line or other facility to which the pen register or \ntrap and trace device is to be attached or applied,\" and even then only if the location \"is known.\"  50 U.S.C. § \n1842(d )(2)(A)(iii) (emphasis added). In this respect, FISA's pen register provisions (Title IV) differ significantly \nfrom its provisions governing full-content collection (Title I), which require the Court to find probable cause that a \nforeign power or agent of a foreign power is using or about to use each of the facilities at which the surveillance will \nbe directed, and the Court's orders to specify the nature as well as the location of each such facility. 50 U.S.C. § \n1805(a)(2)(B), (c)(l)(B).

In addition to granting the Application for prospective collection, the Court should \ngrant commensurate and continuing authority to query metadata previously collected.  That is the \ncase ~ven though, as discussed in the Compliance Report, the prior pen register collection in \ncertain ways exceeded the scope of the Court's orders.  As detailed in the DIRNSA Declaration, \nwithout access to the previously collected information, the value of the pen register will be \ndramatically reduced. See DIRNSA Deel.~ 13 n.6. (TS/fSI//Nf') \nFrom the beginning, this Court has asserted a continuing jurisdiction over the bulk pen \nregister program that is both prospective and retroactive, regulating in each authorization order \nthe collection and querying of all data collected under all prior orders.  The Government \nsupported that assertion of jurisdiction in 2004, and continues to do so today in light of the \nunique nature of the bulk pen register program.  That expansive jurisdiction, however, gives the \nCourt authority to grant access to the stored metadata even though some of it exceeded the scope \nof the Court's prior orders.  Indeed, the Court's rules give it discretion in this area, see FISC R. \nlO(c)(iv), and the Court should exercise that discretion to permit retention and querying of data \nthat, although collected in violation of the Court's prior orders, is within the scope of the statute, \nConstitution, and the current proposed order, and is critical to the proper functioning of the bulk \npen register surveillance program.

This Court has previously found that bulk collection of \nmetadata from e-mail~et the requirements of Section 1842, and should do so again here. \nA.  Scope of Review (U) \nSection 1842(d) of FISA expressly limits the Court's discretion to consider an \nApplication for a pen register.  It states \n[u]pon an application made pursuant to this Section, the judge shall enter an ex parte \norder as requested, or as modified, approving the installation and use of a pen register or \ntrap and trace device if the judge finds that the application satisfies the requirements of \nthis Section.

The Government \ncontinues to believe that the language of the Certification should be determinative of this issue \nand incorporates those previously advanced arguments as if set forth more fully herein. \nHowever, acknowledging the Court's Opinion and Order in docket number PRJTT  this \nMemorandum of Law and Fact also discusses the relevance of the information sought to these \nongoing investigations to protect against international terrorism.  (TSh'SOOW) \nB.  The Information Sought Through the Application is Relevant to an Ongoing \nInvestigation to Protect Against International Terrorism. -(8) \nThe metadata sought through the Application is unquestionably relevant to an ongoing \ninvestigation to protect against international terrorism because it seeks to obtain non-content \ninformation relating to the Foreign Powers and those unknown individuals associated with them \nwho may be plotting terrorist attacks and discover  as to how, and with whom, \nthese Foreign Powers communicate while engaged in these terrorist conspiracies.  The nature and \nvolume of worldwide Internet communications provides a ready-made realm within which \n11 Section 1842(d )(l) directs that an order \"shall\" be entered by the judge if the Court finds that the \nApplication satisfies Section 1842's requirements, one of which is that the Application contain a certification about \nthe information likely to be obtained. 50 U.S.C. § 1842(c )(2). Like the criminal pen register provision upon which \nit is modeled (18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-27), FISA's pen register provisions limit judicial review to ensuring that the \nstatutory requirements for an Application have been satisfied- e.g., that the Application contains the required \ncertification. See United States v. Hallmark, 911F.2d399 (10th Cir. 1990); In re Application for an Order \nAuthorizing Installation and Use ofa  Pen Register and Trap and Trace Device, 846 F. Supp. 1555 (MD.

That the majority of metadata collected previously, and that is \nproposed to be collected now, through this program will not be terrorist-related does not lessen \nthe relevance of the information to these ongoing international terrorism investigations.  Rather, \nwhen viewed in the context of the time span over which these terrorist groups conceptualize, \nplan, and carry out their terrorist attacks, the fact that the metadata relating to terrorist \ncommunications hides within the vast stream of otherwise legitimate Internet metadata only \nheightens the relevance of and necessity to collect the metadata sought in the Application. \nDIRNSA Deel. ifif 14, 21-23. -(81-\nRelevance here is not properly measured through scientific metrics or the number of \nreports issued over the course of a year and it does not require a statistical \"tight fit\" between the \nvolume ofp roposed collection and the much smaller proportion of information that will be \ndirectly \"relevant\" to investigations of the Foreign Po.wers to protect against international \nterrorism.  See Opinion and Order, docket number PRITT., at 49-50. Rather, relevance \nhere properly is measured in packets of metadata that, over an extended period of time, can help \nto fill in information that provides a more complete picture of the communications practices of \nthese Foreign Powers and their agents.  (TS//~!W/NF) \nThe metadata that has been and would be acquired through this collection is pertinent to \nthe FBI's investigations into the Foreign Powers because, when collected and analyzed, the \nmetadata provides assistance to investigators in putting together the complete picture of how \nof \nthese Foreign Powers and their agents communicate over extended periods  time.

(TS//Sif/NF) \nHere, a substantial portion of the metadata that has been and will be collected does not \nrelate to these Foreign Powers and their agents.  That does not weigh against a determination that \nthe infom1ation sought is relevant to an ongoing investigation to protect against international \nterrorism.  To the contrary, as explained in the DIRNSA Declaration, this intelligence tool-one \nof many used by the Government in its efforts to counter the threat posed by these Foreign \nPowers - inherently requires collecting and storing large volumes of the metadata to enable later \nanalysis -- analysis that may continue for years for it to be truly effective.

That level of \nspecificity is ample for the type of collection conducted with a pen register.  Use of a pen register \ndoes not constitute a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

Newton's \nTelecom Dictionary describes an \"address\" as follows:  \"An address comprises the characters \nidentifying the recipient or originator of transmitted data.\"  Newton's Telecom Diet. 87. \nWebster's Collegiate Dictionary provides a similar definition of \"address\": \"to identify (as a \nperipheral or memory location) by an address or a name for information transfer.\"  Webster's \nCollegiate Diet. 13. Thus, \"addressing information\" may be understood to be information that \nidentifies recipients of communications or participants in a communication. Moreover, \naddressing information may refer to people and/or devices.  (U) \nLastly, \"signaling information\" also potentially has a broad meaning.  \"Signaling\" \ninformation is generally understood to represent information transmitted by telephone systems to \ncommence or terminate calls and to register the presence of a cell phone.  Newton's Telecom \nDiet. 823.  However, the meaning of that term should not be cabine.d to telephony and should be \n19  \"Dialing\" is much less ambiguous than the other terms. It presumptively relates to telephones, since the \noriginal version of the pen register provisions used that term since it was originally enacted to cover telephony. \nAccordingly, the Government does not believe that most of the data that would be collected could properly be \nconsidered \"dialing information.\"-ffsr-\nTOP 8ECRETNHC8/COMINT//ORCON,NOFOR~ \n37 \n\nTOP SECRET//HCS/COMINT//OR-CON,NOFORN \ngiven broader application, because Congress intended each of these terms to apply to all forms of \ncommunications.  H.R. Rep. No. 107-236 at 53 (terms were meant to apply \"across the board to \nall communications, media, and to actual connections as well as attempted connections\"). The \nless technical meaning of \"signal\" is \"something that incites to action\" or \"conveys notice or· \nwarning.\"  Webster's Collegiate Diet. at 1091.  Thus, signaling information should be \nunderstood to include transmissions between communications devices (e.g., the user's computer \nand an ISP's web server) that prompt certain actions or responses associated with a \ncommunication or register the presence of a device.20  (TSNSI//NF) \nThe legislative history suggests that Congress intended these undefined terms to be given \nbroad effect, even beyond their coi:iventional technical meanings.  For example, the House \nReport states that \"non-conte,nt information contained in the 'options field' of a network packet \nheader constitutes 'signaling' information and is properly obtained by an authorized pen register \nor trap and trace device.\" H.R. Rep. No. 107-236 at 53 n. l. The options field of Internet packet \nheader information does not conduct \"signaling\" in the conventional sense.  Rather, it carries \ndata used in the transmission of the packet such as time stamp, security, and routing information. \nYet Congress made clear its intent in the legislative history that options field information is \nsubject to collection as part of a pen register order.  Accordingly, the Government submits that \nthis Court should not rely on a narrow reading of these statutory terms and that all.fthe \nattributes or data types specified in the DIRNSA Declaration are one or more of\"routing,\" \n\"addressing,\" or \"signaling\" information.

When Congress added Section \n1842 to FISA, it incorporated Title 18 's definition of \"contents\" into FISA' s pen register \nprovision (Title N) by expressly incorporating the Title 18 defmitions of \"pen register\" and \n\"trap and trace device,\" see 50 U.S.C. § 1841(2), which in turn rely on the definitions of \n\"contents\" in Title 18, see 18 U.S.C. § 3127. See also 50 U.S.C. 1801 (specifying the meanings \nof certain words, including \"contents,\" \"[a] s used in this title\" - i.e., title I of FISA). \n(TS//Sl//NF) \n.  Section 2510(8) defines content to \"include[] any information concerning the substance, \nmeaning, or purport of the communication.\" The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of \n1986 (ECPA), Pub. L. No. 99-508 (1986), amended the definition of content under 18 U.S.C. § \n2510(8) resulting in a narrower defmition of content than under Title I of FISA.  The FISA \ndefmition of content \"includes any information concerning the identity of the parties to such \ncommunication or the existence, substance, purport, or meaning of that communication.\" 50 \nU.S.C. § 1801(n).  Section 2510(8)'s amended definition omits any reference to \"the identity of \nTOP 8ECRETNHC8/COMINTh'ORCON,NOFORN \n44 \n\nTOP SECRET//BCS/COHINT//OR-CON,NOFORN \nthe parties\" or \"the existence\" of the communication. Thus, Section 2510(8)'s definition of \ncontent focuses only on information that reveals the meaning of a particular communication and \nspecifically does not include information that identifies the parties to that communication.  See \nJessup-Morgan v. Am. Online, Inc., 20 F. Supp. 2d 1105, 1108 (E.D.

Supp. 2d 1194 (S.D. \nIowa 2000) (billing/invoice information and names, addresses and phone numbers of persons she \ncalled are not \"contents\" under Section 2510(8)).  Further, Congress did not intend for \ntransactional records to be considered content.  S. Rep.

For instance, in Brown v. Waddell, 50 F.3d 285 (4th Cir: 1995), the Court of Appeals \nfound that a clone pager that collected phone numbers pursuant to the criminal pen register \nprovision (18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-27) was not a \"pen register device\" because it intercepted \nalphanumeric characters that could constitute content. The court's concern was that such pagers \ncould be used to capture sequences of numbers that went beyond the length of ordinary phone \nnumbers and therefore were more likely to have a coded substantive meaning. See, e.g., id. at \n293 (\"[T]he numbers capable of being so re-transmitted surely would have to be limited to raw \ntelephone numbers to retain pen register status.\").

(TSHSfh'NF) \nCases discussing the distinction between metadata and the content of communications are \nscarce. 26  Yet, the Court of Appeals' discussion of content in the Fourth Amendment context in \nUnited States v. Forrester is instructive on the issue of content for Internet communications. The \nCourt of Appeals made an analogy between Internet communications and letters: \n[W]hen the government obtains the to/from addresses of a person's emails or the IP \naddresses of websites visited, it does not find out the contents of the messages or know \nthe particular pages on the websites the person viewed.  At best, the government may \nmake educated guesses about what was said in the messages or viewed on the websites \nbased on its knowledge of the email to/from addresses and IP addresses-but this is no \ndifferent from speculation about the contents of a phone conversation on the basis of the \nidentity of the person or entity that was dialed. Like IP addresses, certain phone numbers \nmay strongly indicate the underlying contents of the communication; for example, the \ngovernment would know that a person who dialed the phone number of a chemicals \ncompany or a gun shop was likely seeking information about chemicals or firearms. \nFurther, when an individual dials a pre-recorded information or subject-specific line, such \nas sports scores, lottery results or phone sex lines, the phone number may even show that \nthe caller had access to specific content information. Nonetheless, the Court in [Smith v. \nMaryland] and [Katz v. United States] drew a clear line between unprotected addressing \ninformation and protected content information that the government did not cross here. \n812 F.3d at 503, citing 495 F.3d 1041, 1049 (9th Cir. 2007).

(TSHSI//NF) \n5.  Pen Registers May Collect Any Non-Content Data Associated With The \nTransmission of Electronic Communications, Regardless of Whether It \nIs Dialing, Routing, Addressing, and Signaling Information.  (U) \nEven if certain types of data that the Government proposes to collect under this \nApplication are not dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information, they still may lawfully \nTOP SECRET//llCS/COMINT.l/ORCON,NOFOR.~ \n49 \n\nTOP SECRET//HCS/COMINTh'ORCON,NOFOR~ \nbe collected by a pen register authorized under FISA because they are not \"content.\" The text \nand legislative history of the pen register statute may be interpreted to permit a pen register to \ncollect any non-content data, so long as the device or process used to collect it also records or \ndecodes \"dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information and does not collect the content \nof any communications.\" In other words, to the extent that some communications data are \nneither dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information nor \"contents,\" a pen register can \nobtain them if it also records, decodes, or captures dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling \ninformation.  (TS//SI-f/NF) \nThe text of Sections 3127(3) and (4) do not limit pen register collection to dialing, \nrouting, addressing, and signaling information.27  Rather, Sections 3127(3) states that a pen \nregister is a \"device or process which records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or \nsignaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic \ncommunications is transmitted, provided however, that such information shall not include the \ncontents of any communication.\" The definition of a trap and trace device in Section 3127(  4) is \nsimilar.  While a pen register must perform those functions to qualify as a pen register, neither \nthe definitions of a pen register or trap and trace device in 18 U.S.C. § 3127, nor Section 1842 of \nFISA, limits the information they may collect to dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling \ninformation.  The only express limitation imposed on the type of information these devices may \n28 \ncollect is the prohibition on the collection of the content of communications. (TS,l/SI.L/NF) \n27  This conclusion is not foreclosed by any other statute that might limit the Government's ability to \ncollect information.  Section 1842 ofFISA provides that pen register may be obtained \"[n]otwithstanding any other \nprovision oflaw.\" Such language evidences Congress' intent to override any law that impeded that authority to \nobtain such a pen register. See Liberty Maritime Co1p. v. United States, 928 F.2d 413, 416-17 and n.4 (D.C. Cir. \n1991). (U) \n28  Section 3127(3) ofTitlc 18 is also d-te that devices or processes used for billing or recording \nas an incident to billing are not \"pen registers.\"  evices will not serve those purposes, so that provision is \nnot germane to this analysis.~ \nTOP SECRET//BCS/COMINT//ORCON,NOFOR~ \n50 \n\nTOP SECRET/fHCS/COMINT//ORCON;NOFOR..l\\l \nThe legislative history to the USA PAT  RIO  T Act amendments to the pen register \ndefinition offers some support for this interpretation.  As discussed above, in 2001, Congress \namended the pen register statute to provide that a pen register is a \"device or process which \nrecords or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an \ninstrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted, provided, \nhowever, that such information shall not include the contents of any communication. See Pub. L. \nNo. 107-56, § 216(c) (2001) (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3127(3)). The definition of\"pen register\" \npreviously had provided that a \"pen register\" is \"a device which records or decodes electronic or \nother impulses which identify the numbers dialed or otherwise transmitted on the telephone line \nto which such device is attached.\"  18 U.S.C. § 3127(3) (2000).29  One significant purpose of \nthose amendments was to make the statute expressly applicable to computers and cell phone \ncommunications, as well as standard public switch telephone networks.30  Id. at 47. In doing so, \nCongress broadened not only the nature of the device that may qualify as a pen register, but also \nthe categories of information collected by a \"pen register.\"  (U) \nThe USA PAT  RIO  T Act amendments used the term \"dialing, routing, addressing, and \nsignaling information\" to cabin the information that a pen register must decode or record.  While \nCongress used this term rather than \"non-content,\" the legislative history suggests that Congress \nintended for \"dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information\" to be synonymous with \n\"non-content.\" The House Report states \n29  The USA PATRIOT Act similarly amended the definition ofa trap and trace device to refer to \"dialing, \nrouting, addressing, and signaling information.\" Pub. L. No. 107-56, § 216(c). (U) \n30  The USA PAT RIO  T Act modified the definition of pen registers to explicitly apply to non-telephonic \ntechnology.  Whereas the definition of a pen register device under Section 3127(3) previously only referred to \n\"numbers dialed or otherwise transmitted through a telephone line,\" amended Section 3127(3) referred to \"dialing, \nrouting, addressing, and signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility.\" Likewise, the definition of \na trap and trace device was amended to refer to \"dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information.\" 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3127(4). (U) \nTOP SECRET//BCS/COMINT//OR:CON,NOFORN \n51 \n\nTOP SECRET/lllCS/COMINTh'OR-CON,NOFORN \n[T]he section clarifies that orders for the installation of pen register and trap and trace \ndevices may obtain any non-content information -\"dialing, routing, addressing, and \nsignaling information\" - utilized in the processing or transmitting of wire and electronic \ncommunications. Just as today, such an order could not be used to intercept the contents \nof communications protected by the wiretap statute.  The amendments reinforce the \nstatutorily prescribed line between a communication's contents and non-content \ninformation, a line identical to the constitutional distinction drawn by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 741-43 (1979).  Thus, for example, an order \nunder the statute could not authorize the collection of email subject lines, which are \nclearly content.  Further, an order under the statute could not be used to collect \ninformation other than 'dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling' information, such as \nthe portion of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) specifying Web search terms or the \nname of a requested file or article.  This concept, that the information properly obtained \nby using a pen register or trap and trace device is non-content information, applies across \nthe board to all communications media. 31 \nH.R. Rep. No. 107-236, at 53 (emphasis added).  (U) \nHere, regardless of whether the modified pen register provision was intended to permit \nthe collection of all non-content - as the plain text of the statute appears to permit and the \nlegislative history arguably supports - or only\" a subset of non-content that is dialing, routing, \naddressing, and signaling information, the Government submits that the non-content data \nidentified in Tab 2 of the DIRNSA Declaration may be lawfully collected in either case under the \nauthority of a pen register.  All of the information to be collected is \"dialing, routing, addressing, \nand signaling information\" and, even if it is not, it may be collected because none of it is \n\"content.\" (TSh'S!/fNF) \n31  We acknowledge the existence of certain counter-arguments concerning the legislative history. The \nHouse Report quoted above, for instance, might arguably demonstrate that the reference in Sections 3127(3) and \n3127(4 ) to \"dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information\" was intended to specify the types of non-content \ninformation the collection of which had been approved iri Smith v. Maryland. Similarly, the reference to particular \ntypes of content information - e-mail subject lines and URLs - might simply reflect Congress's attempt to \nunderscore that pen registers may not collect content information.

(U) \nAs argued above, all data that would be collected by the NSA's devices are non-content \ninformation constituting dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information.  It is well-\nestablished that information traditionally understood to be \"dialing, routing, signaling, and \naddressing information\" is not subject to the Fourth Amendment's protection.  This was \nessentially the holding of Smith v. Maryland and the underpinning of the current pen register \nprovisions, as modified by the USA PATRIOT Act:  there is no legitimate expectation of privacy \nfor such information.  (TS/,lSI//NF) \nThe information proposed to be collected under this Application falls within the phrase \n\"dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information,\" and in any event is non-content \ninformation voluntarily shared with a third party.  Therefore, the information is not subject to a \nreasonable expectation of privacy.  Moreover, even if certain categories of data are subject to a \nreasonable expectation of privacy, the collection program as a whole - particularly in light of the \nstrict access and use limitations on the data once collected - would be reasonable under the \nFourth Amendment in light of the \"special needs\" doctrine.  (TS.l/~W/NE) \nA.  The Proposed Collection Devices Would Be Consistent with Smith v. Maryland. \n(U) \nSmith v. Maryland, the seminal case on the Fourth Amendment's application to use of \npen registers for telephones, found that such devices could be operated without violating the \nFourth Amendment to obtain non-content information that was given to a provider for purposes \nof completing a telephone call.  In Smith, the Court rejected the argument that an individual can \nhave a Fourth Amendment-protected \"legitimate expectation of privacy regarding the numbers \nhe dialed on his phone.\" 442 U.S. at 742 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court \nTOP SECRET//IICS/COMINTh10RCON,NOFOR1\\J \n53 \n\nTOP SECRETJ/llCS/COMINTIIORCON,NOFO.RN \nconcluded that telephone subscribers know that they must convey the numbers they wish to call \nto the telephone company (because such conveyance is necessary for the company to complete \ntheir calls). Thus, the Court concluded, they cannot claim \"any general expectation that the \nnumbers they dial will remain secret.\" Id. at 743.  Even if a subscriber could somehow claim a \nsubjective intention to keep the numbers he dialed secret, the Court found that this was not an \nexpectation that society would recognize as reasonable.  To the contrary, the situation fell \nsquarely into the line of cases in which the Court had ruled that \"a person has no legitimate \nexpectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties.\" Id. at 743-44. \nThe Supreme Court has not addressed the use of pen registers in the context of computer \nnetworks, but lower courts have reached the same conclusion about non-content information \nvoluntarily provided for use in transmission of communications.  See, e.g., Forrester, 512 F.3d at \n509.  Indeed, this Court also arrived at that conclusion when it approved the Application for the \nprevious bulk pen register collection in docket PR!fT  . This Court ruled, \"[T]here is no \nreasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment in the metadata to be collected \n....\"   Opinion and Order, docket number PR/TT  , at 59.  (TS//SI//NF) \nThe core of Smith and its progeny is the principle that non-content information that is \nvoluntarily and knowingly provided to third parties is not protected by the Fourth Amendment. \nUsers of communications systems understand that they are voluntarily exposing that information \nto third parties when they engage in communications requiring such ~sclosure. Therefore, that \ninformation is no longer subject to a legitimate expectation of privacy.  Smith at 743-44, citing \nUnited States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 442-44 (1976); United States v.  White, 401 U.S. 745, 752 \n(1971).  That is the case, moreover, regardless of whether the third party (e.g., an ISP) records \nTOP SECRET//HCS/COMINT/./ORCON,NOFORN \n54 \n\nTOP SECRETHHCS/COMINTHORCON,NOFOR..~ \nthe information. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 745 (\"The fortuity of whether or not the phone company \nin fact elects to make a quasi-permanent record of a particular number dialed does not in our \nview, make any constitutional difference\").  (U) \nAs argued supra, 44-49, all of the data that would be collected by the proposed devices \nare not the content of communications. They are information about and related to the \ntransmission of communications. Consistent with this fact, the data would be collected from the \nportions of communications in which non-content information is generally found.  DIRNSA \nDeel.~~ 17-19.  The e-mail validation scheme that ensures tha \nalso prevents the unintended collection of content as \nanalogous to PCTDD information. Moreover, the \n- essentially, all of the \ndialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information - are data that fall under Smith and are not \nprotected by the Fourth Amendment.

Nevertheless, the Government submits that under the circumstances \nrelevant to this collection, such information is not subject to a legitimate expectation of privacy. \nIt is non-content information knowingly exposed to the provider and collected in a manner \nconsistent with addressing information.  (TSH'SWNF) \nSmith rests on the notion that a legitimate expectation of privacy is lost when one \nvoluntarily exposes transmission (non-content) information to the third party communication \nprovider; it should not be understood to be limited to information that is surrendered be used for \npurposes of actually transmitting the data. Instead, it merely requires that the information be \nsurrendered knowing that the information is transmitted to the ISP. Furthermore, the non \ncontent information that would be collected from \nCase law governing the use of mail covers is instructive on the issue of an expectation of \nprivacy for such information. It is well established that the Fourth Amendment is not implicated \nby \"mail covers,\" through which postal officials monitor and report for regular letter mail the \nsame type of information contained in e-mail meta data- i.e., information on the face of the \nenvelope, including the name of the addressee, the postmark, the name and address of the sender \n(if it appears), and the class of mail. See, e.g., United States v. Choate, 576 F.2d 165, 174-77 \n(9th Cir. 1978); cf. United States v. Charbonneau, 979 F. Supp. 1177, 1184 (S.D.

Use of the Proposed Collection for the Devices to Protect Against Terrorist and \nForeign Intelligence Threats Would Not Violate the Fourth Amendment Because \nTheir Use Is Reasonable Under the \"Special Needs\" Doctrine.32  (U) \nThe overarching Government effort to collect non-content information, for which there is \nno reasonable expectation of privacy, in support of vital national security objectives, does not \nimplicate the Fourth Amendment.

Neither the Fourth Amendment nor Title \nIV of FISA expressly imposes any requirement to tailor collection precisely to obtain solely \ncommunications that are strictly relevant to the investigation.  While it is true that the \noverwhelming majority of communications from which metadata have been and will be collected \nwill not be associated with these Foreign Powers, this does not present any infirmity under the \nFourth Amendment or Section 1842. The collection program here is and has been appropriately \ntailored to balance the overwhelming national security interest at stake here and the minimal \nintrusion into privacy interests that will be implicated by collecting metadata, much of which \nwill never be seen by a human being unless a connection to a terrorist-associated identifier is \nfound.  It is, therefore, reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  (TS.~1SWNF) \nTOP SECRETJ/IICS/COMINTJ/OR:CON,NOFORN \n61 \n\nTOP SECRET/-/HCS/COMINTllORCON,NOFORN \n1.

The only statutory requirement is that \"the information likely to be obtained\" be \n\"relevant to an investigation to protect against international terrorism.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1842(c). \nThat standard does not require that all of the information likely to be obtained by a pen or trap be \ndirectly connected with the underlying investigation.  The Government could never make such \nan absolute certification.  Even in FISA pen register cases targeting individuals, many \ncommunication events are recorded that do not directly bear upon the investigation at issue. 33 \nThe Government cannot identify precisely which communications from the stream of \nbillions are carrying the messages of these Foreign Powers, a challenge that may remain \nrelatively constant given the worldwide nature of Internet communications.  The Government \ntherefore seeks to collect solely the e-mail metadata from these Internet communications - not \ntheir contents - so that it can use the metadata over an extended period of time to trace or \ndetermine connections between known terrorist identifiers and other identifiers (such as e-mails \n- ·  (TS//SV/NF) \n33 The same is true in cases where greater privacy interests are at stake and where the terms of the statute \nreflect a concern for tailoring the collection.

Thus, the collection clearly is appropriate and meets any \nexamination that the Court would conduct by balancing Government's interests in conducting the \ncollection against the potential intrusion into individual privacy interests. The collection \ntherefore is consistent with one of the principal objectives of the entire statutory scheme under \nFISA - to achieve the appropriate balance between those interests.  See, e.g., H.R. Rep.

The reasons underlying Judge Kollar-Kotelly's discussion in her Opinion and Order have \nnot changed in the past five years, for there is no Fourth Amendment-protected interest in the \nmetadata at issue here. See supra at 53-57.  As a result, the standards applied under Fourth \nAmendment balancing are far more rigorous than any that the Court should read into the \nstatutory requirement that collection under Section 1842 be likely to obtain \"relevant\" \ninformation.  Nevertheless, the balancing methodology applied under the Fourth Amendment -\nTOP SECRET/.LHCS/COMlNT//OR.CON,NOliORN \n63 \n\nTOP SECRET//HCS/COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN \nbalancing the Government's interest against the privacy interest at stake - demonstrates the \nreasonableness of the collection.

Earls, 536 U.S. \nat 829.  Even where constitutionally protected interests are at stake (and they are not at stake \nhere), the Fourth Amendment does not require the \"least intrusive\" or most \"narrowly tailored\" \nmeans for obtaining information.  See, e.g., id. at 837 (\"[T]his Court has repeatedly stated that \nreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment does not require employing the least intrusive \nmeans, because the logic of such elaborate less-restrictive-alternative arguments could raise \nins.uperable barriers to the exercise of virtually all search-and-seizure powers.\") (internal citation \nand quotation marks omitted); Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J  v. Acton, 515 U.S. at 663 (\"We have \nrepeatedly refused to declare that only the 'least intrusive' search practicable can be reasonable \nunder the Fourth Amendment.\").

(U) \nEven under the more exacting standards imposed by the Fourth Amendment, if the \nGovernment's interest is great and the intrusion into privacy is relatively minimal, the measure \nof efficacy required to make a search \"reasonable\" is not a numerically demanding success rate \nfor the search.  For example, in considering the use of warrantless and suspicionless roadblocks \nto temporarily seize automobiles and screen for drunken drivers, the Supreme Court found that \nan arrest rate of only 1.6 percent of drivers passing through drunk driving roadblocks established \nsufficient \"efficacy'' to sustain the constitutionality of the practice.

Similarly, the Court has approved the use of \nsuspicionless roadblocks near the border to find illegal aliens even when the roadblocks \nsuccessfully detected illegal immigrants in only 0.12 percent of the vehicles passing through the \ncheckpoint.  See United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 554 (1976).

As the Supreme Court has recognized, \n\"[i]t is obvious and unarguable that no governmental interest is more compelling than the \nsecurity of the Nation.\" Haig, 453 U.S. at 307 (citations and internal quotati9n marks omitted). \nTracking down agents of these Foreign Powers remains essential to safeguarding the Nation \nfrom the grave threat of further terrorist attacks that these Foreign Powers continue to plan and \nmake efforts to carry out.  Acquiring bulk metadata is an important step among several in the · \nprocess of locating terrorists.  Archiving the metadata has and will continue to enable historical \nchainin  of Internet communications. Those methods of analysis (among \nothers) are invaluable tools in efforts to identify the broad scope of the terrorist activities of these \nForeign Powers and their agents.  The Government cannot rely solely on targeted metadata \ncollection because it cannot kno \nwhich communications will show the connections among terrorists.  Cf Martinez-Fuerte, 428 \nU.S. at 557 (upholding suspicionless roadblocks to search for illegal aliens in part because a \n\"requirement that stops on major routes inland always be based on reasonable suspicion would \nbe impractical because the flow of traffic tends to be too heavy to allow the particularized study \nTOP SECRET/lllCS/COMINTNORCON,NOFORN \n65 \n\nTOP SECRETNHCS/COMlNT//ORCON,NOFOR..\"l\\J \nof a given car that would enable it to be identified as a possible carrier of illegal aliens\"). \n(T8//SY/NF) \nBalanced against this extraordinarily strong governmental interest is the minor intrusion \ninto the privacy interests of innocent Internet users in the metadata associated with theii: \nelectronic communications.  There is, of course, no constitutionally protected privacy interest in \nsuch metadata.  Rather, it is analogous to the dialed-number information for telephone calls \nconsidered by the Supreme Court in Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979) (discussed above). \nIn Smith, the Court squarely rejected the view that an individual can have a Fourth Amendment \nprotected \"legitimate expectation of privacy regarding the numbers he dialed on his phone.\" \nSmith, 442 U.S. at 742 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Just as telephone users who \n\"voluntarily convey[]\" information to the phone company \"in the ordinary course\" of making a \ncall \"assum[e ] the risk\" that this information will be passed on to the government or others, \nSmith, 442 U.S. at 744 (internal quotation marks omitted), so too do e-mail  users assume \nthe risk that the addressing information on their communications may be shared. ~ \n2.  The Application of the RAS Standard Has and Will Function to \nSignificantly Limit the Actual Amount of Metadata that is Viewed by the \nNSA.  (TSt/SllJNF) \nIn weighing the intrusion into privacy that the proposed collection would involve, it is \nalso significant that, while the Government will collect a large volume ofmetadata, only a tiny \nfraction of that information has been and will ever be seen by any human being, and then only on \nthe basis of a targeted inquiry.  As described herein, the Government will search the metadata \nonly in prescribed ways designed to uncover communications identifiers associated with these \nForeign Powers.  Metadata concerning an individual's communications that is collected will be \nut the information pertaining to that individual's \nTOP SECRET//HCS/COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN \n66 \n\nTOP SECRETJlllCS/COMDIT//ORCON,NOFORN \ncommunications will never be presented to a human being unless the computer program \nidentifies a terrorist connection in the form of contact with a terrorist-associated identifier that \nhas been determined to satisfy the RAS standard.  The fact that no person will ever view the \noverwhelming majority of the information collected here reduces even further the weight to be \naccorded any intrusion into privacy.  (TS/fS'WNF) \nHere, as in the predecessor collections to the attached Application that this Court has \ngranted, the actual amount of raw metadata that will ever be seen by an NSA analyst is \nsubstantially less than the total amount ofmetadata collected.  That is because any search or \nanalysis of the collected data will occur only after the Government has identified a particular \nInternet'communications identifier (e.g., an address that is associated with these Foreign Powers \nor their or affiliated terrorist organizations).  In identifying such identifiers, the Government will \nconsider an identifier to be terrorist-associated only when \"based on the factual and practical \nconsiderations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent persons act, there are facts \ngiving rise to a reasonable, articulable suspicion\" that the identifier is associated with agents of-\nthe standard applied in the criminal law context for a \"Terry'' stop.

In sum, the application of this standard further reinforces the reasonableness of the \ncollection as it, in effect, significantly reduces the total amount of metadata that will ever be \nanalyzed by NSA.  (TSh'S~ff) \nWhen the Government's need for the metadata collection at issue is balanced against the \nminimal intrusion on the privacy interests of those innocent users of the Internet whose metadata \nwould be collected, the balance tips overwhelmingly in favor of the Government.  If, as the \nSupreme Court concluded in Martinez-Fuerte, the Government's interest in stemming the flow \nof illegal immigration is sufficient to sustain suspicionless seizures of motorists as \nconstitutionally reasonable even when the seizures yield a success rate of only 0.12 percent in \nfinding illegal aliens, then the Government's interest in finding a terrorist plotting the deaths of \nthousands should easily sustain a collection program that implicates no constitutionally protected \ninterests even if its success rate in identifying terrorists is substantially lower than that.  The \nstatutory standard of relevance certainly cannot be construed to impose a more demanding \ntailoring requirement than the Fourth Amendment.34 iS1-\nTOP SECRET//BCS/COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN \n68 \n\nTOP 8ECRET//HCS/COMJNTHORCON,NOFOR~ \nThe exploitation of the metadata information described in the attached Application is \nappropriate under these circumstances.  It involves solely information in which there is no \nconstitutionally protected privacy interest (as opposed to the contents of communications), and \napplication of the reasonably articulable suspicion standard will substantially limit the amount of \nmetadata that actually is seen by one of only a limited number of NSA analysts.  There is no \nattempt to censor the communications from which metadata will be acquired. 35  Thus, the \ncollection the Government proposes here -collection that will take place under the FISA statute \nand with judicial oversight - does not strike any more aggressive balance between the \nGovernment's interest in intelligence and individual privacy than the overall balance that \nCongress itself struck in the statute with respect to non-content metadata that is appropriately \ncollected through a pen register.

Further, the Government has certified that the investigations are not being \nconducted solely upon the basis of activities protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution, and the proposed \nPrimary Order further directs, as to any seed identifiers reasonably believed to be used by or associated with a \nUnited States person, that NSA 's Office of General Counsel (OGC) shall first determine that any identifier so \nbelieved is not regarded as associated with a Foreign Power solely on the basis ofa ctivities that are protected by \nthe First Amendment to the Constitution.

(TSHSif/NF) \nWhen such a communication is identified, as outlined above, the NSA may perform \nseveral types of analysis with the metadata it has collected.  For example, it may perform \ncontact-chaining - that is, it may search the metadata to determine what other identifiers the \ntarget identifier has been in contact with.  In addition, the results of such a query may be \nsubjected to other forms of SIGI NT analysis.  DIRNSA Deel. if 25. It bears emphasis that, given \nthe types of analysis the NSA will perform, no information about an identifier will ever be \naccessed by or presented in an intelligible form to any person unless that identifier has been in \ndirect contact (within two hops) of an identifier for which NSA has satisfied the RAS standard. \n(TS//SIJ/NF) \nSecond, the Government will follow strict procedures ensuring the limited use of the \nmetadata and protecting U.S. person information. These procedures will include ensuring \nadherence to the requirements that access to the data generate auditable records;  analytic queries \nof the data are limited to RAS-approved seed identifiers; and that the underlying metadata is \ndestroyed within five years of collection.

In addition, and in accord with that request, the \nCourt also should grant commensurate and continuing authority to query metadata previously \ncollected.  That is the case even though, as discussed in the Compliance Report, the prior pen \nregister collection in certain ways exceeded the scope of the Court's orders.

(TSHSt//NF) \nBeginning in its first order in July 2004, the Court has recognized the unique nature of \nbulk pen register and has regulated it at two critical stages:  a collection stage, in which metadata \nis extracted from the Internet and stored in NSA databases; and at the querying stage, in which \nthe metadata is extracted from the databases if responsive to a identifier as to which there is \nreasonable articulable suspicion that it is used by one of the Foreign Powers specified in the \nCourt's o~ders. This regulatory framework differentiates the bulk pen.register orders from \ntraditional FISA pen register orders in two important ways.  (TSHSif/NF) \nFirst, the bulk orders l:J.ave regulated both collection and use, where a traditional pen \nregister order regulates collection only.  Cf 50 U.S.C. § 1845(a)(2) (requiring that pen register \ninformation be used lawfully).  Second, each bulk pen register order has regulated not only \nquerying of the information acquired during the 90 days following entry of the order, but also the \ninformation acquired pursuant to all of its predecessor orders. 36  In that sense, the Court has \nasserted a continuing jurisdiction over the bulk pen register program that is both prospective and \nretroactive.  The Government supported that assertion of jurisdiction in 2004, and continues to \ndo so today in light of the unique nature of the bulk pen register program.  (TS,l/SI/fNf') \n36 In a way, this difference in the bulk pen register orders is similar to the Government's obligations \npursuant to minimization procedures that the Government is ordered to follow where this Court authorizes electronic \nsurveillance of Foreign Powers or their agents pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1812. See also note 34, supra \n(discussing how tailoring of this collection through the regulation of queries minimizes the already minimal \npotential intrusion to privacy interests). In those cases, the Government affirmatively pleads and is ordered to \nfollow those minimization procedures \"as to all information acquired through the authorities\" requested in those \nApplications - a limitation on how the Government deals with that information even well after the effective period \nof surveillance ends. Here, even though the pen register statute does not require minimization procedures for pen \nregisters, in this Application and in the prior Applications and orders in the bulk pen register collection, similar \ncontrols on the Government's querying of the information are imposed. ffSl/81/.tWI'j \nTO:P SECRETJ/HCS/COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN \n72 \n\nTOP SECRETJ/llCS/COMINTl/ORCON,NOFORN \nThe Court's continuing jurisdiction under Section 1842 justifies an order granting access \nto the stored metadata, even though some of that metadata exceeded the scope of the Court's \nprior orders. In effect, the Court has treated the \"installation and use\" of the bulk pen register as \nembracing not only current collection but also querying and related actions, whether the data \nbeing queried are newly collected or old. See generally In the Matter ofA pplication oft he \nUnited States, 416 F. Supp. 2d 13, 16 & n.5 (D.D.C. 2006). As such, it is within the Court's \nSection 1842 authority to permit querying of all accumulated metadata, as long as that metadata \nis within the scope of the statute and the Constitution, as it is for reasons discussed above.  And \nas noted above, the value of the bulk pen register would be dramatically reduced without access \nto the years of accumulated data that resides in the NSA's databases pursuant to the prior orders. \n__gg,l,lS:Ei'fNF) \nThere is no independent limitation that would prohibit the Court's authorization of access \nto the stored metadata under Section 1842. The Court's rules give it discretion to enter this \nrequested order lifting the current embargo on the NSA's ability to query this data, see FISC R. \nlO(c)(iv), and there is precedent for similar actions, although in light of the unique nature of the \nbulk pen register it should not be surprising that there are no cases directly on point.  See, e.g., In \ndocket numbers  (seeking authority to index and \nlog a communication that was previously indexed and logged in violation of the known or \nextended absence provision of the FBI's Standard Electronic Surveillance Minimization \nProcedures); In r  docket number  (authorizing retention of \ninformation previously obtained from pen register surveillance of a location not specified in the \nCourt's authorization order because of the government's \"good-faith implementation\" of the pen \nTOP 8ECRETl/HC8/COMINT//ORCON,NOFOR..~ \n73 \n\nTOP SECRET//HCS/COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN \nregister order concerning the correct telephone numbers used by the correct target).37  For these \nreasons, we believe the Court may affirmatively authorize access to and use of the stored \nmetadata under Section 1842. (TS//Sl//Nfi') \n-- Remainder of page intentionally left blank ---\n37 Section 1809 of Title 50, the criminal provision ofFISA, is not to the contrary. Section 1809 is a \nprovision that penalizes certain intentional violations of the Court's orders. That is consistent with Section l 809's \nrequirement of an intentional violation of a known legal duty and its inclusion of an affirmative defense for officers \nwho act. in any manner authorized by court order. Here, of course, we are seeking an order expressly authorizing \nac9ess to the previously collected data. If indeed the Court enjoys authority to issue such an order, as we argue it \ndoes, then Section 1809 should not be read to restrict that authority, given that FISA's pen register provisions apply \n\"(n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,\" including Section 1809. 50 U.S.C. § 1842(a)(l). In light of that \nproviso and the requirement that the ·conduct be willful, the existence of the order would of course preclude any \ncriminal penalty for conduct in conformity with it.

(TSffSI//HP) Previous surveillance authorities granted by the Court, \ninitially in July 2004 and most recently in  enabled NSA to support the \nefforts of the United States Government to detect and prevent terrorist acts against \nUnited States interests by collecting specific categories of metadata from e-mail \n· communications, and then conducting analysis of a subset of this metadata associated \nwith e-mail  associated with the Foreign Powers.6  As described in \nTab 2, NSA is seeking to again collect metadata associated with e-maiF-\ncommunications. \n(TSAA!il/fMP~ O~when \n6  the Order in docket number PR/nllmlapsed, the Court \nentered a Supplemental Order in docket number PRJTT~nd previous dockets, directing that the \nGovernment \"shall not access the information obtained pursuant to the FISC's orders in this matter for \nany analytic or investigative purpose,\" uitless the access is necessa~rotect against an imminent \nthreat to human life. Supplemental Order, Docket Number P~ at 4-5. \n(TSHSINHP) The ability of NSA to access the information collected under docket number PRJTTllm! \nand previous dockets is vital to NSA's ability to carry out its counterterrorism intelligence mission. If \nNSA is not able to combine information it collects prospectively with the information it collected \nunder docket number PRIITmliand previous dockets, there will be a substantial gap in the \ninformation available to NSA. This gap would result in a degradation of NSA's ability to glean \n· counterterrorism-related intelligence from information collected under docket number P~ \nand previous dockets. Accordingly, the Government is seeking authority to access the information \ncollected under docket number PR/TT-nd previous dockets and treat it in accordance with these \nprocedures. \n7 (TS//SI/~JP) For pUiposes of this Declaration, \"e-mail communications\" includes (1) all e-mail messages \nsent between e-mail users, \nTOP SECRETHCOM:INTllNOFORN \n10 \n\nTOP SECRETJ/COi\\4JNTt/NOFORN \n14.  -f5/lfif) Intelligence Community investigation and analysis has shown that \nindividuals associated with the Foreign Powers have come to rely heavily on Internet \ncommunications as a way to convey closely held activities, to include operational \nplanning.

(TStiSI/iNF) Use by terrorists of the specific techniques noted above \ndemonstrates why it is necessary for NSA to collect bulk metadata associated with \nInternet communications at the Facilities to be able to identify and track the \ncommunications of the Foreign Powers. \n~ METADATA NSA SEEKS TO ACCESS \nAND NSA'S COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF THE METADATA \n16.

(TS//SI//NPj To better ensure success in its counterterrorism. intelligence \nmission, NSA needs to have access to the accumulated pool of metadata described in \nthe Application and this Declaration. It is not possible to target collection solely to \nkno\"\\ATll terrorist Internet communications accounts and at the same time use the \nadvantages of metadata analysis to discover the enemy. This is because the Foreign \nPowers take affirmative and intentional steps to disguise and obscure their Internet \ncommunications and their identities. They do this using a variety of tactics \nThe most effective means by which NSA analysts are able to \ncontinuously keep track of the Foreign Powers making use of sucl1 tactics is to obtain. \nand maintain access to metadata repositories that will permit these tactics to be \nuncovered. \n22.  (-5/f&f) Because it is impossible to determine in advance what metadata \nwill tum out to be valuable in tracking, identifying, characterizing and exploiting a \nterrorist, collecting metadata in the manner set out above is vital for success. Likewise, \nTOP SECRETHCOMINT//NOFOR.~ \n17 \n\nTOP SECRETNCOMINT//NOFORN \nit is impossible to have a complete prospective awareness of all terrorist threats at any \ngiven time. For these reasons, obtaining the fullest intelligence benefit from terrorist-\nrelated Internet communications requires that metadata be collected in bulk and also be \nkept available for retrospective, or historical, analysis for a reasonable period of time. \nAnalysts know that the terrorists' Internet communications are located.s omewhere in \nthe billions of data bits traversing the Facilities; what they cannot know ahead of time is \nexactly where. If rnetadata is not collected by the Government at the time that Internet \ncommunications are transmitted, that data disappears and is lost forever. \n23.  (TS//SI//D>W) The ability to accumulate the rnetadata in repositories and set \nit aside for carefully controlled searches and analysis will substantially increase \nNSA' s ability to detect and identify the Foreign Powers and those individuals affiliated \nwith them. The NSA will conduct contact chaining queries of the metadata repositories \nto determine the contacts and/or connections of particular terrorist-associated \nidentifiers. \n24.  (TSHSI//NF} Contact chaining queries of the metadata will begin with a \nRAS-approved seed, and will return only that rnetadata within two \"hops\" of the seed.12 \n12 (TSl./'3I~l'i) The first \"hop': from a seed returns results including all identifiers (and their associated \nmetadata) with a contact and/or co1mection with the seed. The second \"hop\" returns results that include \nall identifiers (and their associated metadata) wiU1 a contact and/or c01mection with an identifier revealed \nby the first \"hop.\" Going out to the second \"hop\" enhances NSA's ability to find, detect and identify the \nForeign Powers and those affiliated with them by greatly increasing the chances that previously \nTOP SECRET/.ICOMINTt/NOFORN \n18 \n\nTOP SECRETHCOMINT//:NOFORN \nMetadata associated with a seed and these contacts or connections will be integrated \nwith metadata acquired under other authorities for further analysis. As appropriate, \nthe results of such queries will be shared within NSA for further SIGINT analysis, and \nultimately disseminated to support the efforts of the United States, and in particular of \nthe FBI, to detect and prevent terrorist acts against United States interests. \n25.  (TSHSI/&JF) Once NSA conducts a query of a RAS-approved seed, NSA is \nthen able to apply other analytic methods and techniques to the query results. \nMetadata analysis of query results is an essential aspect of SIGINT analysis that allows \nNSA to exploit the communications of a mobile, global target set that commonly uses \nfree, widely available Internet communications. Successful exploitation of the Internet \ncommunications of the Foreign Powers requires that NSA is in constant state of \netadata analysis contributes to this critical target monitoring, \ndevelopment and discovery by providing information that an analyst can use to \ndetermine various intelligence information, including but not limited to \nunknown Foreign Power-associated identifiers may be uncovered. A \"seed\" e-mail address, for example, \nmay be in contact with a previously unknown e-mail address. Chaining out to the second hop to examine \nthe contacts made by that e-mail address may reveal a contact with other e-mail address already known \nto be associated with a Foreign Power, thus establishing that the previously-unknown e-mail address is \nitself likely associated with a Foreign Power. \nTOP SECRET//COMINTttl'!tlOFORN \n19 \n\nTOP SECRETJ/COMINT.l/NOFORN \nese kinds of analysis are equally applicable in the ongoing \ndevelopment of known targets as well as in the discovery of new targets. In particular, \nthe use of a RAS-approved seed to query NSA' s repository of historical Internet \ncommunications metadata can help the Government discover previously unknown \ncontacts between the seed identifier an \nTOP 8ECRET//COl:\\4JNT,l/NOFORN \n20 \n\nTOI> ~ECRET//COMINTllNQFORN \n26.  (TSl/SI//NF) The ability to collect metadata in bulk is also necessary for the \npurpose of retrospective (historical) analysis. Retrospective analysis not only allows for \nNSA analysts to pursue newly found leads, it also facilitates NSA's ability to maintain \nmoTe complete coverage of a known target and triage major events. To the extent that \nhistorical connections are important to understanding a newly-identified target, \nTOP 8ECRETJ/COMINT//NOFORN \n21 \n\nTOP SECRETJ/COMINT.l/NOFOR.N \n· collected inetadata may contain unique links, pointing to potential targets and/or \nidentifiers that otherwise would be missed. Historical metadata analysis (using \nmultiple sources available to NSA analysts) is a necessary and lucrative resource for \ndiscovering and understanding the communications \na terrorist suspect before a potential threat materializes into an actual threat.13 \nAdditionally, the intelligence gleaned from the metadata may be used to inform further \nproviding the substance of NSA end-product intelligence reporting to \nthe FBI and other members of the United States Intelligence Community, and providing \nnew leads for tasking/targeting. Furthermore, metadata analysis helps to refine and \n27.  tsff&f-) Were NSA to use pen registers and trap and trace devices targeted \nindividually at specific terrorist-associated  to collect \nmetadata associated with the identifiers in contact with \ncommunications identifiers in contact with the first-tier of identifiers, i.e., going \"two \n· TOP 8ECRETf/COMINT/.INOFORN \n22 \n\nTOP 8ECRET,l/COMINT//NOFORN \nhops out\" -that process would potentially entail the submission of thousands of pen \nregister and trap and trace device applications per year. As explained above, acquiring \nmetadata using individually-targeted pen registers and trap and trace devices would \nnot permit NSA to accumulate a metadata repository that could broadly discover \nrelevant historical information about newly-found identifiers associated with suspected \nterrorists. Using such an individually-targeted approach would deprive NSA of the \nvastly more powerful analytic potential offered by a historic repository of metadata. \nFor example, if investigators find a new identifier \ny revealing the contacts that were made by the-now-disused account in the \npast- contacts that may in turn reveal other terrorist accounts that continue to be active. \n{\"f~//5I//NF) DESCRIPTION OF NSA's COLLECTION, STORAGE, ANALYSIS, \nDISSEMINATION AND RETENTION OF THE METADATA \n28.

(TS//SIJ/Nf) Procedures for Conducting Queries and Other Analysis. \n(a)  NSA analysts18 may conduct contact chaining queries of the metadata for the \npurpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information using identifiers approved as \n\"seeds\" pursuant to the RAS approval process described below. NSA will ensure, \nthrough adequate and appropriate technical and management controls, that no queries \nof the metadata will be conducted for intelligence analysis purposes using an identifier \nthat has not been RAS-approved. \n(i)  (TS//SJ/./DTF) Identifiers to be used as \"seeds\" with which to query the \nmetadata may be approved by any of the following designated approving \nofficials: the Chief or Deputy Chief, Homeland Security Analysis Center; or one \nof the twenty specially-authorized Homeland Mission Coordinators in the \nAnalysis and Production Directorate of the Signals Intelligence Directorate. Such \napproval will be given only after the designated approving official has \n18 (Ta,l,lal/,C.HP) Under previous Court Orders, NSA safeguarded against queries using non-RAS-approved \nseeds by limiting the number of analysts with authority to query the metadata and providing those \nanalysts special training to emphasize the importance of the proper use of RAS-approved Seeds. NSA . \nmonitored the effectiveness of these safeguards, by logging all analytic queries for auditing purposes. In \nNSA implemented technical controls, which block any analytic query of the metadata \nwith a non-RAS-approved seed. In the accompanying Application, NSA is also seeking authority to \nshare query results, as needed, throughout NSA's analytic enterprise. Because of the new technical \ncontrols that protect against improper queries, and because NSA is seeking authority for broader sharing \nof query results among NSA analysts, the limitation on the number of analysts with query authority \nwould no longer serve a meaningful compliance purpose.

For a variety of reasons, NSA \nmight find it necessary to revise or recall a serialized SIGINT report containing PRITT~ \nderived information. The NSA revision/recall process requires the repoit's originator to \nissue the recall and nominally consists ofb  oth formal and informal processes. \nInformally, an analyst will typically contact the analyst's Intelligence Coxnmunity \ncounte11mrts immediately so that the previously reported information is properly \nunderstood and interpreted.  In parallel with this info1111a.l contact, tho analyst also would \ntake prompt action to follow the formal revision and recall procedures. NSA's revision \nand recall procedures are in compliance with Intelligence Community-wide standards \nadopted in August 2005 by the Director of National Intelligence.  We can provide a copy \noft hose standards upon request.  (TS//SJ//MP) \nPRITT q_uery reEmlts are traceabl •  I  SA uses \nfor PR/TT information.

However, beca~Lse analysis is a highly \nTO:P ~ECRET//COMllNTN.NOFORJ:\"l \n- 2 -\n\n..  ..... \n~-··~ \nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN \ncollaborative hlUnan process, PRJTI' query reslllts may be shared internally withh1 NSA \nin many forms, to include information provided orally, in writing, (e.g., email) or ll1 \nsummary fonn.  Therefore, it is impossible to provide absolute assurance that NSA will \nsuccessfully isolate and delete every shred of internally~shared metadata in every \ninstance.  That said, the policies, training, culture, ethos, and professionalism at all levels \nof the NSA workforce provide a very high level of assurance that such an incident would \nbe remediated with the utmost promptness and tl1orougbness.  In addition, before NSA \npersormel may dissemimite any SIGINT reporting outside NSA, all such reports must be \nsource checked.  This should ensure that no PR/TT reports will rely on query results that \nmay have been subject to a purge reql,l.irement.  This practice also ensures NSA will apply \nthe con·ect dissemi11ation standard to any PR/TT query results that may contain U ..S . \nperson information.  (TSHSI//NP)  · \nRegarding the Court's questions concerning the application ofUSSID 18 as a \n\"minimization procedure\":~ \nThe draft PRJTT applicatfo11 pi·ovided to the Court requested tl1at NSA be allowed \nto apply its standm:d USS ID 18 procedures to the dissemination of PRJTT query results. \nIn light of the Co1irt's concerns with the application ofUSSID 18 to the dissemination of \nPR/TT query results, the Government now proposes to substitute a more limited \n· dissemination detennination for the determinations set forth in Section 7.2 of US SID 18. \nSpecifically, before NSA disseminates any U.S. person identifying information; an NSA \napproving offioial (described furthel' below) will detennine, first, that the U.S. person \nidentifying information is related to counterterrodsm information (as opposed to the more \ngeneral foreign intelligence information of USS ID 18) and, second, that it is necessary to \nunderstand the counterterrorism information or assess its importance (as opposed to \nUS SID 18 requiring either that the information is necessary to understand the foreign \nintelligence infom1ation or assess its importance). Excepted from the determination \nrequirement will be disseminations for purposes oflawful oversight and use or discovery \nin U.S. criminal proceedings,  In the event NSA assesses a ne~d to disseminate U.S. \nperson information that is related to foreign intelligence information under 50 \nU.S.C. § 180l(e) other than counterterro1ism information and is necessary \nto understand the foreign intelligence information or assess its impmtance, the \nGove1runent 'vill seek prior approval from the Comt.  (TS//SJ//NF) \nIn other respects, the Government will aiJply Section 7 ofUSSID 18 to the \ndissemination of qnery results. In particular, the NSA approving officials who may make \nthe dissemination determination will be the same officials who may make a dissemination \ndetermination under Section 7.3(c) ofUSSID 18.  Seven high-rnnldng NSA officials \ncurrently are authorized under USSID 18 to approve disseminations outside NSA: the \nDirector and the Deputy Director ofNSA; the Director and the Deputy Director of the \nSID; the Chief and the Deputy Chief of the ISS office; _and the SOO of the National \nSeclll'ity Operations Center. The Govenm1ent proposes that these seven officials approve \ndisselninations of PR/'IT query results containing U.S. person identifying infori:nation. \n(TSllSlft.l>IF) \n!J:'ffil SECIIBTHCOJ:\\fINT//NOFORN \n\n• • ·~. •\". \".•• ·' :  -\":II•:'·-~.~ .• \nTOP .SECRET//CO:MJNT/INOFORN \nRegarding the Court's request for a legal principle that would bound the \nGovernment's request for an order permitting access to and use of overcollected \ndata:i'fST \nIn addition to seeking authority to re-initiate collection of new PR/IT infom1ation, \nas described in the draft ap.plication presented on  ·he Goverrunent is \nseeking an order that (1) autho i \"e  prospective use and disclosure of the data collected \nunder docket n  d previous dockets, and (2) lifts the Supple111e11tal \nOrder issued on  prohibiting use of the previously acquired PR/TT \ndata. 1 Tlle authority sought with respect to the use and disclosure of the previously \ncollected data is no broader than the authority now sought going forward, and is-in our \nview-within the scope of the applicable statutned st .e Fomih Amendment, but is \nbeyond the scope of the orders entered in PR/TT  and previous dockets. The Court \nhas e:xpwssed concern about issuing an order tha · au 10riZes the use and disclosure of \ndata that was in fact collected outside tho scope of an existing order but that la.wfo11y \ncould have been acquired consistent with the PR/TI statute and the Foiuth Amendment. \nThe Cou1t asked whether there was any limiting principle to bound the application of \nsuch fill order.  To illustrate its point, the Court suggested that the Government might \nseek similar relief if it conducted full-content electronic surveillance without first \nobtaining a court order tmder circumstances that would in fact have satisfied the \nrequirements of Title I of PISA. (TSHSJHNF) \nThe Goveimnent understands the Court's concern; however, we submit that the \nextraordinary circumstances undel' which the Government now seeks the proposed order \nwould provide the Court with ample basis for distinguishing between the relief sought \nhere and the appropri-dy in future cases. The facts and procedural history of \ndocket mm1ber PRITT  and previous dockets that atithorized the Government to \nconduct bulk collection of pen register and trap and trace data and to que1y the resulting \ndata were sui generis.  Consequently, the relief that the Govenunent seeks here is \nunlikely fo be available in virtually filly other case.  (TS//SIH.NF) \nee Memoran um o  aw at  8-7 .

The Court typically lacks jurisdiction over the tise and disclosure of \ninfo1mation obtained pursuant to a conventional pen register and trap and trace order. \nUnder Section 1842(d )(l ), the Court only has jurisdiction to enter orders concerning \nprospective collection activities and does not possess jurisdiction over the Government's \nuse or disClosurn of acquired information (e.g., the querying of resulting data).  Thus, the \nGovernment would usually have no cause to seek comparable relief in a routine PR/TT \ncase and even ifi t did, the Court would lack jurisdiction to furnish it (TS//SY!NF) \n1 \nFmthennore, the problem of overcollectio11.is unlikely to arise in most PR/TT \nmatter~ke typical orders issued unde1' 50 U.S.C. § 1842(d)(1), in docket number \nPR/T~ and previous dockets the Government requested and the Cotµ:t authorized \nthe collection of ollly specified categories of PR/TT data.  While stich a limitation. on a \nPR/TT device is within the authority granted by FISA to the Government to apply for and \nthe Court to approve, 50 U.S.C. § 1842(a)(l) and (d)(l), it created a gap that does not \nusually exist between what an authorized P:R!TT device could collect statutorily and what \nit was permitted to collect. As a result, it created the.unusual occurrence of \novercollection by a court-authorized PR/TT device, which highlights yet another means \nof differentiating between the facts here and in other cases.  (TS//Sfh'NF) \nWhile the data the Government seeks to access here was collected beyond the \nscope of the Court's orders, they were nonetheless collected by devices authorized by the \nComt. Thus, the case at hand is disth1guishablel from instances in which acquisition \noccurs without any grant of authority whatsoever, such as in. the Court>s Title I example. \nFurthermore, the full-content collection referenced in the Cou1t's example could only \nresult fi:om electronic surveillance, and an order amending a prior order to authorize that \ncollection nunc.pro tune would require new findings reqt~ir~~itle I. See, e.g., 50 \nU.S.C. § 1805(a)(2). In contrast, an order amending PR/~nd previous dockets \nnune pro tune would not require any new judicial fi11dings to satisfy the PRITT statute. \nSee 50 U.S.C. § 1842(d)(1) & (2).  (TS//SJ//NF) \nIt is also noteworthy that the data at issue here is non-content information that is \nnot protected bythe.Fol.ll'th Amendment. Accordingly, the Government submits that \nwhile it would be appropriate for the Court to permit the requested relief for this class of \ni11fonnati.on in the limited circumstances 01.itlined above, it may not be for \nconstitutionally-protected classes of infonnation in other contexts.  It would be \nparticularly appropriate where the overcollection occmred without bad faith or criminal \nintent under 50 U.S. C. § 1809 and in the context of a highly~technical collection program. \nffS//Sil/NF) . \nTOP SECRET//COMINT//-NOFOR..1'{ \n-5 -\n\nTOP S'.GCR:ET.~'COMINTNNOFORN \nRegai·ding tlie Court's request for other instances or case law involving a PRJTT. \ncollection that would bear on its consideration of specific aspects of the \nGovernment's proposed collection:~ \nAddition~l/clarifying information regarding what is meant by \"application \nc01m11ands» in In re Application for an Order Authorizing the Use ofa Pen \nRegister and Trcip on [xxxl Internet Service Account/User Name \n[xxxxxxx@xxx.com7, 396 F.
