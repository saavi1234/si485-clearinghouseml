This is a civil rights action to vindicate the rights of law-abiding New York City \nresidents to be free from unconstitutional and unlawful stops, searches and arrests \nby members of the New York City Police Department.  While walking from his \ncar to his Bron)[ home in November 2007, Plaintiff Leonardo Blair, a black New \nYork City resident who works as a crime reporter for the New York Post, was \nstopped and frisked by New York City police officers.  After aggressively \nstopping him and though he had committed no crime, the officers handcuffed Mr. \nth \nBlair and took him to the 49 Precinct, where they placed him in a cell.  In the \ncell Mr. Blair listened as the arresting officers reacted incredulously that, though \nhe was black, he was not from \"the projects.\"  Shortly after learning that he was a \nPost reporter and had a Master's degree from Columbia University, the officers \nreleased Mr. Blair, though not before issuing him two summonses.  A Bron)[ \nCriminal Court judge dismissed both summonses. \n1 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 2 of 16\n2.  In the last two years alone, NYPD officers stopped and questioned New Yorkers \nnearly one million times, part of a dramatic increase in the Department's use of \nstop-and-frisk tactics since 2002.  Of the nearly one million people stopped in \n2006 and 2007, nearly 90% were engaged in entirely lawful activity, as they were \nneither arrested nor issued a summons.  Members of minority communities are \nbearing the brunt of these NYPD practices, with blacks and Latinos being the \ntarget of nearly 90% ofNYPD stops. \n3.  TheNYPD is using its sweeping stop-and-frisk operation to build a massive \ndatabase of law-abiding, minority New York City residents.  After conducting \nstops and frisks, police officers complete forms that, among other things, include \nthe name and address of the person stopped, and that information is then entered \ninto a centralized NYPD database.  As a result of this practice and the surge of \nstops and frisks over the last several years, the NYPD now has a database of \nhundreds of thousands if not more than one million law-abiding New Yorkers \nwho, like Mr. Blair, now are at risk of becoming the subject of criminal \ninvestigations by virtue of being in the database. \n4.  As a consequence of his arrest, Mr. Blair has a permanent scar on his clean \nrecord.  An unwarranted arrest is particularly troublesome for Mr. Blair because \nhe is an immigrant; any arrest, even an unfounded one, must be reported on \nimmigration and visa applications and may raise concerns with the immigration \nauthorities. \n5.  As a result of their actions, the defendants have violated Mr. Blair's rights under \nthe United States Constitution and under the Constitution and laws of the State of \n2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 3 of 16\nNew York.  The plaintiff seeks a declaration that the defendants' actions have \nbeen unlawful, injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys' fees. \nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff LEONARDO BLAIR is a twenty-eight-year-old resident of New York \nCity. \n7.  Defendant THE CITY OF NEW YORK is a municipal corporation within the \nState of New York. \n8.  Defendant RAYMOND KELLY is the Commissioner of the New York City \nPolice Department, which is an agency of the City of New York.  He is sued in \nhis official capacity. \n9.  Defendant OFFICER WILLIAM CASTILLO is a police officer employed by the \nNYPD who arrested Mr. Blair.  He is sued in his official and personal capacities. \n10.  Defendant OFFICER ERIC REYNOLDS is a police officer employed by the \nNYPD who arrested Mr. Blair.  He is sued in his official and personal capacities. \nFACTS \nLeonardo Blair \n11.  Leonardo Blair is a black man who was born in Jamaica and immigrated to the \nUnited States in 2006.  After receiving a full-tuition scholarship, he graduated \nfrom the Columbia University Graduate School of Joumalism in May 2007.  He \nhas since worked as a journalist for the New York Post, where he works at the \nCity Desk.  He reports on a variety of issues in New York City, including crime. \n3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 4 of 16\nAs such, he talks with police officers on a  regular basis and has strong and \nrespectful professional relationships with them. \n12.  Mr. Blair is married and lives with his wife in Manhattan.  She is also from \nJamaica and works for the United Nations. \n13.  Mr. Blair remains close with members of his extended family who live in the \nBronx.  At the time of the incident, Mr. Blair lived in the Bronx with his aunt and \nuncle. \n14.  After arriving in New York City in 2006, Mr. Blair had an excellent relationship \nwith NYPD officers. \n15.  Before November 28,2007, Mr. Blair had never been arrested. \n16.  Mr. Blair is currently in the United States on an Optional Practical Training visa, \nwhich permits a year of employment after completing an academic program.  He \nis currently preparing to change his immigration status - a process fraught with \nuncertainty where any blemish in his record can be of importance. \n17.  Due to his arrest on November 28,2007, Mr. Blair was forced to complete \nadditional paperwork and obtain legal advice on how to treat the arrest. \nUnsurprisingly, this has become a source of stress and anxiety for Mr. Blair. \nSuspicionless Stop and Frisk of Leonardo Blair \n18.  Shortly after 8:00 PM on November 28, 2007, Mr. Blair was returning home from \nvisiting his then-fiancee and current wife and parked his car on Arnow Avenue \nnear the comer of Arnow and Pearsall Avenues in the Bronx.  He grabbed his \ngym bag, got out of his car and began walking towards his family's home.  After \n4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 5 of 16\nchecking that he had locked his car door, he proceeded down Arnow Avenue \ntoward Tenbroeck Avenue. \n19.  As soon as he turned onto Tenbroeck Avenue he heard a car screech to a stop. \nTenbroeck Avenue was dark and quiet and, walking alone, the sound frightened \nMr. Blair. \n20.  Given his working relationship with the NYPD, Mr. Blair was relieved to see that \nthe car was an NYPD patrol car.  He continued walking and the patrol car \nfollowed. \n21.  An NYPD officer rolled down his window and threateningly asked Mr. Blair what \nhe was doing coming from the car.  The aggressive tone of the question perplexed \nMr. Blair. \n22.  Without any reasonable grounds to think that Mr. Blair had committed or was \nabout to commit a crime, an officer, who Mr. Blair later learned to be Officer \nWilliam Castillo, jumped out of the car and positioned himself so physically close \nto Mr. Blair's face that Mr. Blair had to take a step back. \n23.  Officer Castillo physically blocked Mr. Blair from proceeding along the sidewalk \ntowards his home.  Mr. Blair was caught off-guard by Officer Castillo's \naggressive approach. \n24.  Officer Castillo angrily demanded of Mr. Blair whether he spoke English.  Mr. \nBlair, surprised by Officer Castillo's mocking tone, replied under his breath in \nSpanish that he did not. \n5 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 6 of 16\n25.  Officer Castillo continued to question what Mr. Blair was doing coming from his \ncar.  Mr. Blair answered, this time in English, that the car he was coming from \nwas his own. \n26.  Officer Castillo ordered Mr. Blair to put his hands in the air, and Mr. Blair \ncooperated. \n27.  By this time, Officer Castillo's partner, who Mr. Blair later learned was Officer \nEric Reynolds, had exited the patrol car. \n28.  Mr. Blair was not engaging in any illegal or improper activity, and nothing in his \nbehavior or conduct would provide the basis for reasonable suspicion that he was \nengaging in any wrongdoing. \n29.  Officer Castillo then frisked Mr. Blair. \n30.  Officer Reynolds searched through Mr. Blair's gym bag. \n31.  The officers found nothing illegal. \nArrest, Imprisonment and Prosecution of Mr. Blair without Probable Cause \n32.  When the frisk and search were completed, Mr. Blair put his hands down.  Officer \nCastillo yelled that he did not say that Mr. Blair could put his hands down. \n33.  Though Mr. Blair had not done anything unlawful, Officer Castillo put Mr. \nBlair's hands behind his back and placed him in handcuffs. \n34.  Mr. Blair asked Officer Castillo what he had done wrong.  Officer Castillo replied \nthat he had disobeyed a lawful order. \n6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 7 of 16\n35.  Mr. Blair explained that his family lived nearby and asked to call them.  Instead, \nOfficers Castillo and Reynolds pulled Mr. Blair to the police car and pushed him \ninto the backseat. \n36.  Both officers refused to explain to Mr. Blair why they had arrested him. \n37.  When they arrived at the 49th precinct, Mr. Blair again asked why he was being \narrested.  Officer Castillo said that he was not being arrested but was receiving a \nsummons. \n38.  Believing he was being mistreated, Mr. Blair asked the officers what had \nhappened to \"courtesy, professionalism and respect.\"  He was told to \"shut up.\" \nOne of the officers told him that he should be quiet if he knew what was good for \nhim. \n39.  The officers placed Mr. Blair in a cell in the holding area. \n40.  While Mr. Blair remained in the cell, Officer Castillo and Officer Reynolds \nemptied Mr. Blair's bag and pulled out his driver's license. \n41.  Reading the address from Mr. Blair's identification, Officer Castillo showed it to \nOfficer Reynolds and incredulously remarked words to the effect, \"Look at this, \nhe's not even from the projects.\" \n42.  Mr. Blair replied that Officer Castillo should not assume him to be from the \nprojects simply because he was black.  He also said that this comment revealed \nracial profiling and that the officers knew as much. \n43.  Mr. Blair asked again why he was being incarcerated.  Officer Reynolds replied \nthat he was not incarcerated and asked Mr. Blair ifhe knew what the word \nincarceration meant. \n7 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 8 of 16\n44.  Because of the degrading nature of the question, Mr. Blair responded that he had a \nmaster's degree from Columbia University and was a reporter for the New York \nPost. \n45.  Officer Castillo froze, and his face flushed. \n46.  Both officers left the holding area and retumed a few minutes later. \n47.  Mr. Blair was then told that he was free to go.  He asked again what he had done \nwrong, and the officers told him that he would see it on his summonses. \n48.  Officer Castillo issued two summonses, one alleging that Mr. Blair disobeyed a \nlawful order and another alleging that Mr. Blair had made \"unreasonable noise.\" \n49.  Officer Castillo issued the summonses even though he had no basis for believing \nthat Mr. Blair had done anything unlawful.  These summonses were issued \nmaliciously and without probable cause. \n50.  Mr. Blair got the officers' names, took his belongings and left the precinct at \napproximately 9:10 PM. \n51.  Mr. Blair's summonses required him to appear in Bronx Criminal Court on \nFebruary 8, 2008.  Mr. Blair appeared in court that day, causing him to miss a day \nof work. \n52.  When Mr. Blair appeared at Bronx Criminal Court un February 8, 2008, the \nsummonses had not been withdrawn, which forced Mr. Blair to appear before a \nCriminal Court judge.  He was represented by an NYCLU attorney, who \nrequested that the summonses be dismissed because they were legally insufficient \non their face.  The judge reviewed both summonses and dismissed them. \n8 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 9 of 16\n53.  Mr. Blair filed a Notice of Claim with the Comptroller's office of the City of New \nYork on February 21, 2008. \n54.  Because of his arrest and detention, Mr. Blair could hardly sleep for a number of \ndays, and to date, his heart races when he encounters police officers when he is \nnot working.  Furthermore, Mr. Blair now experiences anxiety and apprehension \nwhenever he interviews local residents for his job. \n55.  Even though the summonses were dismissed, the mere fact that Mr. Blair was \narrested  poses problems for him given his current immigration status.  To apply \nfor a new visa, Mr. Blair must acknowledge to the United States Citizenship and \nImmigration Services that he was arrested. \n56.  Based on both officers' comments and actions during the arrest and at the \nprecinct, Mr. Blair believes he was singled out for a stop, frisk and arrest because \nof his race. \n57.  At all times, Defendants' actions were taken under color oflaw. \nMr. Blair's Personal Information Remains in the NYPD's Stop-and-Frisk Database \n58.  According to the NYPD Patrol Guide, every time an NYPD officer stops and \nfrisks someone on the street, he or she must complete a \"Stop, Question and \nFrisk\" worksheet, also known as a UF-250, recording information about the \nencounter, including the name and home address of the person stopped. \nFurthermore, the NYPD Patrol Guide stipulates that a UF-2S0 must be completed \nwhenever an officer believes that he has reasonable suspicion to stop an \nindividual, even if the stop results in an arrest or summons. \n9 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 10 of 16\n59.  In March 2006 the NYPD issued an Operations Order requiring that the \ninfonnation from all UF-250s be compiled in a computerized database (\"Stop-\nand-Frisk Database\"). \n60.  Upon infonnation and belief, Mr. Blair's personal identifying infonnation was \nentered into and remains in the Stop-and-Frisk Database. \n61.  g_nXe~ruary 5, 2007, the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) wrote to \nNYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly to notify him of tbe privacy concerns \nimplicated by the NYPD's collection and maintenance of a centralized database \nof hundreds of thousands of law-abiding New Yorkers and to request that the \nNYPD remove from its database identifying information about law-abiding \npersons who were stopped.  The NYCLU also noted that New York Criminal \nProcedure Law requires that the Department seal the database records of any \nperson who had been arrested and whose case ended favorably for tbe person. \nAccordingly, the letter asked that the NYPD take steps to assure that the stop-and-\nfrisk records of these individuals be sealed in accordance with the sealing statute. \nAs of the filing of this lawsuit, the NYCLU has received no response to its letter. \n62.  On July 25, 2007, the NYCLU requested that the NYPD produce its Stop-and-\nFrisk Database pursuant to the New York State Freedom ofInfonnation Law \n(FOIL).  The NYPD denied that request, including amongst its reasons an \nassertion that the database was subject to the sealing provision of the Criminal \nProcedure Law.  After the NYCLU filed suit in November 2007 challenging this \ndenial, the Assistant Corporation Counsel representing the NYPD initially \nasserted to the NYCLU that one defense available to the NYPD was a claim that \n10 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 11 of 16\nthe database was subject to the sealing statute.  The NYCLU responded that the \nattorney should check with the NYPD to see if it fact was sealing the database. \nSeveral weeks later, the City filed a motion to dismiss the NYCLU's lawsuit \n(which is pending).  Conspicuously absent from that motion was any claim that \nthe Stop-and-Frisk Database could not be disclosed because the NYPD was \nsealing it under the Criminal Procedure Law. \n63.  In 2006 and 2007 the NYPD arrested nearly 50,000 people in conjunction with \nstops and frisks.  Upon information and belief, a substantial number of those \narrests, like the arrest of Mr. Blair, resulted in favorable dispositions for the \ndefendants such that the sealing provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law would \napply to all records associated with those arrests, including those in the Stop-and-\nFrisk Database. \n64.  Upon information and belief, New York City and the NYPD have a policy, \npractice, or custom of failing to seal records in the Stop-and-Frisk Database of \npeople who are arrested in conjunction with a stop and frisk and whose cases \nsubsequently are dismissed or otherwise end favorably. \n65.  Upon information and belief, the NYPD, pursuant to the policy, practice, or \ncustom alleged above, has not sealed information contained in its Stop-and-Frisk \nDatabase concerning Mr. Blair. \nNYPD Pattern and Practice of Unconstitutional Stops and Frisks \n66.  Between 2004 and 2007, the NYPD reported stopping and questioning \napproximately 1,700,000 people.  Though police officers are legally allowed to \n11 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 12 of 16\nstop and question a person only if they have reasonable grounds for suspecting the \nperson has engaged in or is engaging in unlawful activity, those 1,700,000 stops \nresulted in only approximately 195,000 arrests or summonses, leaving nearly \n1,500,000 people who were stopped but who were engaged in entirely lawful \nactivity.  That nearly 90% of people stopped and questioned by police officers \nwere law-abiding (and that there 1,500,000 of them) points to a widespread \npattern and practice of unlawful stops. \n67.  Perhaps explaining the large number of stops of law-abiding New Yorkers, NYPD \nreports indicate that its officers are stopping persons for reasons that are \nimpermissible.  For instance, the single most common factor identified with stops \nin 2006 and 2007 was that the person was in a high crime area, with that factor \nbeing recorded in about 53% of the nearly 1,000,000 stops during those two years. \nBeing in a high crime area -- which describes many New York City \nneighborhoods -- is not a lawful basis for a stop, and every stop that was based \nonly on this factor or that was based on that and other impermissible factors \nwould be unlawful. \n68.  The NYPD's refusal to disclose the Stop-and-Frisk Database has made it \nimpossible at this point to further determine the extent of the Department's use of \nimproper reasons for stopping and frisking persons. \n69.  The NYPD has been on notice for many years that its officers may be stopping \nlarge numbers of people without legal justification.  In the aftermath of the \nFebruary 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo, the New York State Attorney General \nissued a detailed report examining NYPD stop-and-frisk practices.  Among other \n12 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 13 of 16\nthings, that report concluded, based on an examination of the forms competed by \nofficers when making stops, that no lawful basis for the stop had been provided \nby officers in nearly 40% of stops. \n70.  In 2001 the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), an independent New \nYork City agency responsible for investigating reports of police misconduct, \nissued a report about complaints it had received about NYPD stops and frisks \nbetween January I, 1997 and March 31, 1999.  The agency reported that, \ncompared to with all other types of complaints about police-civilian encounters \nclosed during this period of study, it was more likely to conclude that police \nofficers had engaged in misconduct during stops and frisks. \n71.  According to the CCRB' s 2001 report, NYPD officers \"testified to using physical \nforce to effect stops for 48% of the whites who filed complaints but 74% of the \nAfrican-Americans and 76% of the Latinos.\"  The report found that these \ndifferences in the use of force were statistically significant and thus were not due \nto chance.  In addition, NYPD officers used guns to stop a greater percentage of \nblacks and Hispanics than whites.  The report also found that these differences \nwere statistically significant and not due to chance. \n72.  Since 2001 the number of complaints filed each year with the CCRB concerning \nstop and frisks more than tripled, going from about 1500 in 2002 to over 5000 in \n2006.  At the same time the proportion of complaints filed with the CCRB \nconcerning stop and frisks has substantially increased. \n73.  According to NYPD reports, of the stops made between 2004 and 2007, 51.5% \nwere of blacks, while whites comprised only 10.4% of those stopped.  By \n13 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 14 of 16\ncontrast, the most recent Census figures report that blacks make up only about \n25% of the city population and whites 45%.  These disparities cannot be \nexplained by the race of suspects about whom the police receive reports, as such \nreports account for only a small percentage of all stops and frisks.  Rather, the \nvast majority of stops and frisks are initiated by officers based on their own \nobservations. \n74.  Despite being on notice for many years about unlawful stop-and-frisk practices \nand despite there being a particularly vigorous public controversy about those \npractices over the last year following the release of reports showing a huge \nincrease in stop-and-frisk activity, the NYPD, upon information and belief, has \ntaken no meaningful actions to monitor, supervise, or train its officers so as to \nreduce or eliminate the unlawful stops and frisks being conducted by members of \nthe Department. \n75.  Upon information and belief, the NYPD and New York City have a policy, \npattern and practice, or custom of stopping, frisking and questioning individuals \nwithout legal justification. \n76.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Blair was stopped, frisked, and arrested as a \nresult of the NYPD and New York City'S policy, pattern and practice, or custom \nof stopping individuals without legal justification. \nJURY DEMAND \n77.  Plaintiff demands a trial by jury in this action on each and every one of his claims. \n14 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-04303-SAS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/08   Page 15 of 16\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n78.
