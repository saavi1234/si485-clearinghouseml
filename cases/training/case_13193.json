Specifically, the plaintiff claims that an employee of defendant sexually harassed female employees, created a hostile work environment, propositioned female employees for sex, and that defendant failed to respond to complaints, ultimately firing an employee who complained.</p><p>On November 22, 2013, a consent decree was entered. Defendant did not acknowledge any wrongdoing but agreed to pay $325,000 to settle the claim. The amount paid to each employee was to be determined by the EEOC. The consent agreement also required defendant to implement policies to avoid future harassment, including by including of non-harassment criteria on employee evaluations, creating an anonymous complaint system, training employees on sexual harassment and their rights, and creating a reporting system that will track claims of such harassment. Defendant was required to notify its employees of the requirement placed upon it within sixty days and to report all complaints of sexual harassment to the EEOC every 180 days for 30 months. </p><p>Parties were to bear their own costs.</p><p>An objection to the consent decree was filed December 30, 2013.</p>",

At all relevant times, Defendant Employer has continuously been an employer engaged in \nan industry affecting commerce within the meaning of Sections 701(b), (g) and (h) of Title VII, \n42 U.S.C. ยงยง 2000e(b), (g) and (h). \nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS \n6.  More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, Hodge filed a charge with the \nCommission alleging violations of Title VII by Defendant Employer.  All conditions precedent \nto the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled.   \n \n2\n\nCase 3:11-cv-00596-WHB-RHW   Document 8   Filed 12/08/11   Page 3 of 8\n7.  Since approximately 2005, Defendant Em ployer has engaged in unlaw ful employment \npractices at its Mississippi stores in violation of Section 703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-\n2(a)(1) and 2000e-2(a). Specifically, Defendant  subjected Hodge and other fe male employees \nwho worked at Defendantโs Mississippi sto res to unwelcome, degrading and offe nsive sexual \nconduct, often culminating in adverse employment actions, based on their sex (female) \n8.  Examples of this conduct include: \na.  Jeff Stewart (โStewartโ), Defendantโs  Operations Manager, propositioned Hodge \nand other female employees for sex, including  offering them money, higher salaries, and other \nbenefits in exchange for sex; \n  b.  Stewart  graphically desc ribed  lewd  sexual acts to Hodge and other fem ale \nemployees and suggested that they engage in them; \nc.  Stewart made graphic and lewd sexual  comments to Hodge and the other fe male \nemployees such as โhis penis belongs in an employeeโs vagina; โhe wanted to fโkโ a fem ale \nemployee โreal badโ; and he wanted to see an employee naked; \nd.  Stewart  commented about fem ale  employeesโ  โbuttsโ and breasts, invited a \nfemale employee to hold his penis while he urinat ed, told a female employee that his penis was \nbigger than her boyfriendโs, invited a female employee into the bathroom for a sexual encounter, \ncornered a female employee in an office for  a sexual encounter, and asked another fem ale \nemployee whether she liked โcream fillingโ or sex with females; \ne.  Stewart sexually groped female employees and touched them in their p rivate \nareas, including sticking his hands down their pants; \nf.  Stewart took sexual phot ographs and videos of fe male employeesโ bodies and \nthen displayed them in the workplace; \n \n3\n\nCase 3:11-cv-00596-WHB-RHW   Document 8   Filed 12/08/11   Page 4 of 8\ng.  Stewart  engaged in sexually graphic de monstrations  and gestures, including \ngrabbing or pointing to his penis, pointing to female employeeโs private parts, and stuffing food \nin his groin area to simulate a sexual organ;  \nh.  Stewartโs  conduct was open and notor ious  and Defe ndant,  including its \nsupervisors, and managers, was aware of it; \ni.  Women who objected to or rejected Stewartโs sexual advances and comments, or \nrefused to engage in them, were threatened  by Stewart with termination, reduction in pay, and \nother tangible changes in their conditions of employment; \nj.  Many female employees were afraid to complain about Stewartโs conduct because \nStewart  was intim idating  and had a reputati on  for penalizing empl oyees  who resisted, \ncomplained about, or challenged him; \nk.  Some female employees complained to Defendant, including its supervisors and \nmanagers, about Stewartโs conduct, but nothing was done to stop it; \nl.  Many  female  employees,  aware that nothing had been done about Stewartโs \nconduct and complaints to Defendant about it, did not believe Defendant would stop the conduct \neven if they complained;  \nm.  Defendant failed to take  prompt or effective preventive, corrective or rem edial \naction; \nn.  Employee protests directly to Stewart did not stop Stewartโs unlawful conduct; \no.  Stewart either took or thr eatened to take adverse act ions against employees who \nrefused to acquiesce to his sexual demands, conduct and comments; and \np.  Stewartโs conduct was unwanted, severe  and pervasive, and fe male employeesโ \nwere offended by it. \n \n4\n\nCase 3:11-cv-00596-WHB-RHW   Document 8   Filed 12/08/11   Page 5 of 8\n9.  On  or about August 2009, Defe ndant  Employer  engaged in unlawful e mployment \npractices at its Mississippi stores by retaliating against Hodge in viola tion of Section 704(a) of \nTitle VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-3(a).   \na.  The Commission incorporates by reference paragraph nine (9) of this Complaint.    \nb.  Hodge complained to Defendantโs Store Manager, Sam Whitehead (โWhitehead), \nabout Stewartโs sexually harassing conduct.  \nc.  Shorty after Hodge reported the harassm ent to Whitehead, Defendant terminated \nHodge allegedly because of a m inor verbal dispute she had with a co-worker.  In contrast, no  \naction was taken against the co-worker although she instigated the dispute. \nd.  Defendantโs  decision to term inate  Hodge  was  in retaliation for her having \nengaged in activity. \ne.  Whitehead later told Hodge that the incident was not her fault.   Nevertheless, she \nwas not reinstated. \n10.  Since at least June, 2011, Defendant Save-A-Lot has failed, in violation of Section 711(a) \nand (b) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-10(a) and (b), to post and keep posted notices which have \nbeen prepared or approved by the Commission setting forth excerpts from or summaries of the \npertinent provisions of Title VII and information pertinent to the filing of a charge or complaint.   \n  a.   During an onsite investigation at Defendantโs premises on June 2, 2011, an EEOC \ninvestigator saw that Defendant did not have  posted in conspicuous places where notices to  \nemployees and applicants for employment are customarily posted, the required notices.  \n11.  The effect of the practices com plained of in paragraph(s) six (6) through ten (10) above \nhas been to deprive Hodge and/or a class of  female employees who worked at Defendantโs \nMississippi stores of equal employment opportunities and, otherwise, adversely affect their status \n \n5\n\nCase 3:11-cv-00596-WHB-RHW   Document 8   Filed 12/08/11   Page 6 of 8\nas employees because of their sex (female) and/or in retaliation for o pposition to acts made \nunlawful by Title VII.  \n12.  The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraphs six (6) through ten (10) \nabove were intentional.   \n13.      The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraphs six (6) through ten (10) \nabove were done with m alice or with reckless indifference to the fe derally protected rights of   \nHodge and other female employees. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court: \nA.  Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant Save-A-Lot, its officers, agents, \nservants, employees, attorneys, and all persons in active concert or participation with \nthem,  from engaging in sexual harassm ent,  and any other em ployment  practices \nwhich  discriminate  on the basis of se x,  and from   engaging  in retaliation for \nopposition to employment practices which discriminate on the basis of sex.     \nB.  Order  Defendant  Save-A-Lot  to institu te  and  carry ou t  policies,  practices,  and \nprograms which provide equal employment opportunities for women and for persons \nwho oppose conduct prohibited by Title VII, a nd which eradicate the effects of its \npast and present unlawful employment practices.   \nC.  Order  Defendant Save-A-Lot to m ake  whole  Hodge, and the class of fe male \nemployees,  by providing, as appropriate,   appropriate backpay with prejudgm ent \ninterest, in amounts to be determined at trial, and other affirmative relief necessary to \neradicate the effects of its unlawful employment practices including, but not limited \nto, front pay.  \n \n6\n\nCase 3:11-cv-00596-WHB-RHW   Document 8   Filed 12/08/11   Page 7 of 8\nD.  Order Defendant Save-A-Lot to make whole Hodge and class of female employees by \nproviding,  as appropriate, com pensation  for  past and future nonpecuniary losses \nresulting from the unlawful practices com plained of in paragraphs six (6) through \nnine (9) above, including emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, loss of enjoyment \nof life, and humiliation, in amounts to be determined at trial.   \nE.  Order Defendant Save-A-Lot to pay to Hodge and the class of fe male employees \npunitive damages for its malicious and reckless conduct described in paragraphs six \n(6) through ten (10) above, in amounts to be determined at trial.   \nF.  Order Defendant Save-A-Lot to post and keep posted notices in accordance with the \nprovisions  of Section 711(a) of Title V II,  42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-10(a) and ass ess \nappropriate civil fines against the D efendant pursuant to Section 711(b) of Title VII \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-10(b).  \nG.  Grant such further relief as the Court  deems necessary and proper in the public \ninterest.   \nH.  Award the Commission its costs of this action. \nJURY TRIAL DEMAND \nThe Commission requests a jury trial on all questions of fact raised by its complaint. \n \n  Date:  December 8, 2011 \n       \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, \n \n \nP.
