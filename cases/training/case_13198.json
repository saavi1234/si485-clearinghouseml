    "summary": "<p>On May 23, 2013, prisoners and recently released prisoners from Monterey County Jail filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs sued the County of Monterey and the California Forensic Medical Group (CFMG) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Northern California, the ACLU National Prison Project, the Monterey Public Defender, and private attorneys, asked for declaratory and injunctive relief.  Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the conditions in the Monterey County Jail (the \"Jail\") violated federal and state law due to failures to protect prisoners from violence, provide adequate medical and mental health care, and provide reasonable accommodations to prisoners with disabilities. </p><p>On April 25, 2015, the County and Sheriff's Office filed a motion to dismiss, and the CFMG filed a motion to dismiss on May 2, 2014. The District Court (Magistrate Judge Paul Singh Grewal) denied both motions on September 29, 2014. 2014 WL 4843945 (N.D. Cal. 2014). First, the Court found that the plaintiffs had standing even if they were no longer incarcerated, due to the short average length of stay of prisoners in the putative class and the slow speed of legal action. Second, the Court addressed the issue of whether a private provider of jail medical facilities are \"services\" that can face scrutiny under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Court found that the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded that CFMG was subject to Title III of the ADA because it operates a \"professional office of a health care provider, hospital, or other service establishment\" within the jail.  The Court further explained that, although the \"place\" of a jail fell under Title II of the ADA as a public entity, courts had consistently found that Title III applied to \"places of public accommodation\" within places that normally don't fit under Title III either because they are owned by or operated for other purposes by a public entity.</p><p>On April 29, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking certification of a prisoner class consisting of all current and future prisoners in the jail, and a subclass of prisoners with disabilities, consisting of all current and future prisoners who have a qualifying disability.  Then, on August 26, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, requesting that the Court order defendants to fix six of the conditions at the Jail that placed the plaintiffs and class members at risk of serious injury and death. </p><p>On January 29, 2015, Magistrate Judge Grewal certified the class. 2015 WL 399975 (N.D. Cal. 2015). Then on April 14, 2015, Magistrate Judge Grewal also granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. </p><p>On May 11, 2015, the parties settled the case. The jail agreed to set new standards for the medical and mental health care provided to inmates and to expand accessibility for prisoners with disabilities. The parties agreed to retain experts as neutral monitors for a limited term of oversight. The parties planned for the jail to come into compliance with the Settlement Agreement within five years, unless they moved for an extension. The court was to retain jurisdiction over the settlement for this five year period.</p><p>On August 18, 2015, Magistrate Judge Grewal approved the settlement. Litigation continued over attorneys' fees as the settlement agreement only set upper limits for attorneys' fees of $4.8 million. On November 6, the parties stipulated to an agreement of how they would address the issue of interest on attorneys' fees.</p><p>The parties then litigated the implementation plan. After briefing and hearings, the court approved an implementation plan on May 27, 2016. </p><p>On June 6, 2016, the case was reassigned to Judge Beth Labson Freeman.</p><p>In 2017 and 2018, there was some litigation over compliance issues. On March 19, 2018, the plaintiffs proposed an order regarding the use of telepsychiatry by the defendants, as per the settlement agreement. The court had instructed the parties that the defendants needed to have standards for when they could deviate from the typical in-person encounter and instead use “telemedicine or telepsychiatry.” After counsel met and decided on these issues, plaintiffs’ proposed order was signed and ordered by the judge on March 22, 2018. (ECF 632). Over the following months, parties handled various settlement agreement enforcement issues, such as attorneys fees and costs, the production of medical records, and neutral monitors. The docket remains active with these issues as of March 6, 2020. </p><p></p>",

See Order \n5  Granting Pls’ Mot. to Enforce Settlement Agr. & Wellpath Implementation Plan \n6  (“Enforcement Order”) Dkt. No. 838 at ECF p. 26.  The Court enjoined CFMG/Wellpath \n7  to come into immediate and sustained compliance with the forty-three requirements, and \n8  imposed a conditional coercive civil contempt fine on CFMG/Wellpath in the amount of \n9  $25,000 per each of the forty-three requirements.  Id.  The Court granted CFMG/Wellpath \n10  six months to purge the contempt by coming into substantial compliance with each and \n11  every one of requirements 1-13 and 15-44.  Id.  This Court further ordered the neutral \n12  monitors to provide reports regarding CFMG/Wellpath’s compliance with requirements 1-\n13  13 and 15-44 at the end of the six-month purge period, after which CFMG/Wellpath would \n14  be required to show cause in writing why it should not be required to pay civil contempt \n15  fines in the amount of $25,000 per requirement.  Id. at ECF p. 27. \n16  Pursuant to the Parties’ stipulation, on January 9, 2024, the Court ordered that the \n17  medical care site audit be conducted by neutral monitor Dr. Bruce Barnett on March 25-26, \n18  2024; the dental care site audit be conducted by neutral monitor Dr. Viviane Winthrop on \n19  April 1-2, 2024; and the mental health care site audit be conducted by neutral monitor Dr. \n20  James Vess on April 15-16, 2024.  See Order Approving Joint Status Report Regarding \n21  Schedule of Neutral Monitor Audits and Filing of Final Reports (“Evidentiary Hearing \n22  Scheduling Order”), Dkt.

The resulting final neutral monitors reports were filed with the \n26  Court as Dkt. Nos. 882, 895-1 and 902-1 through 902-4.  Thereafter, the Court ordered \n27  CFMG/Wellpath to file a Show Cause Response re Imposition of Contempt Sanctions by \n28  August 16, 2024, ordered Plaintiffs to submit an expedited discovery plan, and scheduled \n  [4595032.3]   2  Case No. 5:13-cv-02354-BLF \nSTIPULATION AND [PROPOSED] ORDER RE CIVIL CONTEMPT \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 945   Filed 10/29/24   Page 3 of 7\n \n1  an evidentiary hearing for December 16-17, 2024.  See Order Setting Evidentiary Hearing \n2  and Related Deadlines, Dkt. No. 900. \n3  CFMG/Wellpath filed its Show Cause Response Regarding Imposition of Contempt \n4  Sanctions on August 16, 2024, supported by expert declarations from Dr. Alexander \n5  Meagher (medical care), Dr. Brian Waxler (mental health care), Dr. Morton Rosenberg \n6  (dental care), and Joshua Rafinski (audit methodology) opining on CFMG/Wellpath’s \n7  compliance with the forty-three requirements in the Court’s Enforcement Order.   See Dkt. \n8  Nos. 905, 905-1, 905-2, 905-3, and 905-4. \n9  Pursuant to the Court’s Evidentiary Hearing Scheduling Order, the Parties \n10  conducted expedited discovery in preparation for the December 16-17, 2024 evidentiary \n11  hearing.  Following discovery, the Parties engaged in settlement discussions including \n12  participation in two settlement conferences presided over by the Hon. Judge Nathanael \n13  Cousins on October 17 and 24, 2024. \n14  Following successful settlement discussions, THE PARTIES NOW STIPULATE \n15  AND AGREE to the below thirteen points which comprise their Stipulation re Civil \n16  Contempt, which the parties jointly request that the Court enter through the below Order: \n17  1.  The Parties agree to resolve all the issues set for evidentiary hearing before \n18  Judge Freeman on December 16-17, 2024, through this framework agreement. \n19  2.  The Parties agree to an immediate stay of discovery. \n20  3.  The Parties agree to ask Judge Freeman to vacate the evidentiary hearing. \n21  4.  Judge Cousins is assigned to mediate any disputes under this agreement. \n22  5.  CFMG/Wellpath will pay the full civil contempt fine ordered by Judge \n23  Freeman as to the medical monitoring issues, except as to requirement 10 (pharmaceutical \n24  practices).  Payment mechanics, including the recipient of these funds, will be determined \n25  by further agreement.  To the extent payment mechanics cannot be agreed between the \n26  Parties, each Party will submit a letter brief not to exceed five pages regarding the Parties’ \n27  dispute, and Judge Cousins will resolve this dispute. \n28  6.  As to the mental health and dental civil contempt fines, the Parties agree to \n  [4595032.3]   3  Case No. 5:13-cv-02354-BLF \nSTIPULATION AND [PROPOSED] ORDER RE CIVIL CONTEMPT \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 945   Filed 10/29/24   Page 4 of 7\n \n1  be bound by the determinations made in the next monitoring reports (contemplated to be \n2  finalized after scheduled visits in October and November 2024).  The monitors, Dr. Vess \n3  and Dr. Winthrop, will determine “non-compliance,” “substantial compliance,” or “partial \n4  compliance.”  The Parties agree the civil contempt fine for any issue determined to be in \n5  “non-compliance” will be $25,000.  For “partial compliance” the civil contempt fine will \n6  be $5,000.  The Parties agree not to challenge the monitors’ final report findings in \n7  connection with applying the civil contempt fines per this Stipulation, and will not appeal \n8  the Court’s Order approving and adopting the Stipulation regarding Civil Contempt.  \n9  Payment mechanics, including the recipient of these funds, will be determined by further \n10  agreement.  To the extent payment mechanics cannot be agreed between the Parties, each \n11  Party will submit a letter brief not to exceed five pages regarding the Parties’ dispute, and \n12  Judge Cousins will resolve this dispute. \n13  7.  The Parties agree to ask the neutral monitors to include in their monitoring \n14  reports going forward in this case a separate section of the report describing the \n15  information considered and the scoring methodology used. \n16  8.  No party waives its rights as to any future enforcement motion. \n17  9.  This agreement does not otherwise modify the Settlement Agreement or \n18  Implementation Plans in this case.  \n19  10.  CFMG/Wellpath admits that it cannot meet its burden of proof to establish \n20  that it was in substantial compliance nor that it purged the contempt by March 25, 2024.  \n21  11.  CFMG/Wellpath agrees that Defendants’ compliance with the Settlement \n22  Agreement and Implementation Plan shall be governed by paragraph 10 of the Settlement \n23  Agreement, Dkt. No. 494.  \n24  12.  Nothing in this agreement shall limit Plaintiffs’ ability to seek fees for their \n25  work, including under paragraphs 63-65 of the Settlement Agreement, Dkt.

The Court \n6  finds that the Parties’ Stipulation re Civil Contempt satisfies the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \n7  § 3626(a)(1)(A) in that it is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct \n8  the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the \n9  violation of the Federal right of the Plaintiffs.  Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED \n10  THAT: \n11  1.  The Parties’ Stipulation re Civil Contempt, incorporated herein by reference \n12  in its entirety, is approved and entered as an order of the Court.  \n13  2.  All discovery provided for in the Court’s Evidentiary Hearing Scheduling \n14  Order is immediately and permanently stayed. \n15  3.  The December 16-17, 2024 evidentiary hearing is vacated. \n16  4.  Judge Cousins will mediate any disputes under the Parties’ Stipulation re \n17  Civil Contempt.  Judge Cousins will rule on any dispute that the parties are unable to \n18  resolve regarding payment mechanics, including the recipient of the money due by \n19  CFMG/Wellpath under the Parties’ Stipulation re Civil Contempt. \n20  5.  CFMG/Wellpath will pay $250,000 for failing to purge the contempt by \n21  coming into substantial compliance with each and every one of the medical requirements \n22  1-11 in the Court’s Enforcement Order, except for requirement 10 (pharmaceutical \n23  services).  \n24  6.  CFMG/Wellpath will pay $25,000 for each determination of non-compliance \n25  made by Dr. Vess and Dr. Winthrop in their next final monitoring report as to each of the \n26  mental health and dental requirements 12-13, and 15-44 in the Court’s Enforcement Order.  \n27  CFMG/Wellpath will pay $5,000 for each determination of partial compliance made by Dr. \n28  Vess and Dr. Winthrop in their next final monitoring report as to each of the mental health \n  [4595032.3]   6  Case No. 5:13-cv-02354-BLF \nSTIPULATION AND [PROPOSED] ORDER RE CIVIL CONTEMPT \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 945   Filed 10/29/24   Page 7 of 7\n \n1  and dental requirements 12-13, and 15-44 in the Court’s Enforcement Order.

The Parties shall ask the neutral monitors to include in their monitoring \n7  reports a separate section of the report describing the information considered and the \n8  scoring methodology used. \n9  8.  No party has waived its rights as to any future enforcement motion. \n10  9.  The Stipulation re Civil Contempt does not modify the Settlement \n11  Agreement or Implementation Plans in this case.  \n12  10.

INTRODUCTION\n2 During the course of this litigation CFMG has worked with Plaintiffs’ counsel to\n3 develop a comprehensive Implementation Plan designed to ensure that inmates at the\n4 Monterey County Jail (MCJ) receive medical, mental health and dental services that meet\n5 or exceed community and constitutional standards.  In reality, Plaintiffs’ counsel and\n6 CFMG share a common goal. They each want to see a medical, mental health and dental\n7 care delivery system at MCJ which provides constitutionally adequate treatment for all\n8 inmates. Unfortunately, the Parties are not in complete agreement on how to reach that\n9 goal.  \n10 CFMG’s Implementation Plan has been revised on numerous occasions in response\n11 to various recommendations and objections which have been raised by Plaintiffs’ counsel. \n12 Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a copy of the Implementation Plan most recently proposed\n13 by CFMG.  CFMG requests that the Court approve this Implementation Plan in its entirety\n14 and allow them 45 days to train their staff regarding the provisions of the Plan before\n15 requiring its implementation.\n16 In a Joint Letter Re: Implementation Plan Status filed with this Court on March 18,\n17 2016, (Dkt. 527) the parties set forth two lists: (1) Issue on which the parties continued to\n18 negotiate and which may need to be briefed and (2) Disputed issues which were fairly\n19 certain to require briefing.  CFMG and Plaintiffs’ counsel have been able to resolve many\n20 of the issues on which they continued to negotiate since March 18, 2016.  However,\n21 CFMG and Plaintiffs’ counsel have not been able to resolve any of the disputed issues. \n22 Plaintiffs’ counsel continues to raise a number of specific objections to CFMG’s\n23 Implementation  Plan.  CFMG  contends  these  objections  are  unfounded  and  include\n24 requirements that were never contemplated nor negotiated as part of the Settlement\n25 Agreement approved by the Honorable Paul Grewal on August 18, 2015.  In addition,\n26 many of Plaintiffs’ objections require CFMG to exceed community standards or guidelines\n27 published by the Institute of Medical Quality (IMQ) or National Commission on\n28 ///\n1 5:13cv2354 PSG\nDEFENDANT CFMG'S MOTION FOR APPROVAL \nOF IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 532   Filed 04/01/16   Page 3 of 140\n1 Correctional Health Care (NCCHC). This is not what CFMG bargained for when entering\n2 into the Settlement Agreement. \n3 II.  PLAINTIFFS’ SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS TO \n4 CFMG’S IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n5 A.  Restraint Chairs and Other Physical Means of Restraint\n6 Plaintiffs contend that placement in a restraint chair “should be considered an\n7 emergency–with evaluation by a Qualified Mental Health Provider (QMHP) as soon as\n8 possible and no later than one hour after placement, and hourly thereafter.” (DKT 515 at\n9 page 11, lines 20-22.)  After consultation with Plaintiffs’ counsel regarding this issue\n10 CFMG amended their Implementation Plan to include the following language:\n11 Physical restraint devices shall only be utilized on inmates who\ndisplay bizarre behavior which results in the destruction of\n12 property or reveals an intent to cause physical harm to others.\nPhysical restraints should only be used when it appears less\n13 restrictive alternatives would be ineffective in controlling the\ndisordered behavior. \n14\nAny  inmate  placed  in  a  restraint  chair  will  be  seen  and\n15 evaluated by a medical provider no later than one hour from\nthe  time  of  placement.    The  medical  evaluation  may  be\n16 performed by trained nursing staff, physician assistant, nurse\npractitioner or physician.  If the medical provider believes the\n17 inmate is experiencing a mental health crises  the medical\nprovider    will  promptly  contact  a  qualified  mental  health\n18 provider who will see and evaluate the inmate within one hour\nof  being  contacted  by  the  medical  provider.  (CFMG\n19 Implementation Plan at page 40.)\n20 B. Pharmacy.\n21 Plaintiffs contend CFMG seeks “to maintain the status quo in which Licensed\nVocational Nurses dispense medications from stock bottles into individual doses – despite\n22\nthe fact that California law and a minimal respect for patient safety reserves dispensing for\n23\nlicensed pharmacists.”\n24\nPlaintiffs mistakenly believe that CFMG uses Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs)\n25\nto dispense medication. The parties do not dispute that LVNs are authorized to administer\n26\nand deliver medications to inmates because this is clearly within the scope of an LVN’s\n27\npractice.\n28 ///\n2 5:13cv2354 PSG\nDEFENDANT CFMG'S MOTION FOR APPROVAL \nOF IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 532   Filed 04/01/16   Page 4 of 140\n1 California Code of Regulation, Title 15, §1006 provides definitions for the terms\n2 “administering,” “dispensing,” and “delivering” medications. These regulations state:\n3\n“Administering Medication,” as it relates to managing legally\n4\nobtained  drugs,  means  the  act  by  which  a  single  dose  of\nmedication is given to a patient. The single dose of medication\n5\nmay be taken either from stock (undispensed), or dispensed\nsupplies.” (Italics added.)\n6\n“Dispensing,” as it relates to managing legally obtained drugs,\n7\nmeans  the  interpretation  of  the  prescription  order,  the\npreparation, repackaging, and labeling of the drug based upon\n8\na prescription from the physician, dentist or other prescriber\nauthorized by law.\n9\n“Delivering  Medication,”  as  it  relates  to  managing  legally\n10\nobtained drugs, means the act of writing one or more doses of a\nprescribed and dispensed medication to a patient. (CCR, Title\n11\n15, §1006.)\n12\nDelivery  of  medication  may  be  done  by  either  licensed  or\nnonlicensed personnel, e.g., custody staff, acting on the order of\n13\na prescriber. (CCR Title 15, § 1216(b)(7)).\n14\nAs more fully set forth in the Declaration of Kathy Wild, R.N., attached hereto as\n15\nExhibit B, the LVN’s at the MCJ do not dispense medications.  Instead, Diamond\n16\nPharmacy dispenses the medications used at the MCJ and they are then administered by\n17\nthe LVNs.  \n18\nDiamond Pharmacy dispenses many of their medications to the MCJ in bulk or stock\n19\nsupply.  The LVNs at CFMG are trained to take a single dose of medication from the\n20\nproperly labeled stock supply and them administer the medication to the inmate.  This\n21\nmethod of administering medications is within the scope of an LVN’s practice and does\n22\nnot violate Title 15, state, or federal laws.  This method is also consistent with the Institute\n23\nof  Medical  Quality  (IMQ)  and  National  Commission  on  Correctional  Health  Care\n24\nStandards (NCCHC).\n25\nC. Plans for Treatment in Addition to Medication.\n26\nPlaintiffs claim the MCJ “has no regular program of mental health treatment other\n27\nthan medication.”  This is inaccurate. CFMG provides on-site mental health services by\n28\nqualified mental health providers seven days a week. An on-call qualified mental health\n3 5:13cv2354 PSG\nDEFENDANT CFMG'S MOTION FOR APPROVAL \nOF IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 532   Filed 04/01/16   Page 5 of 140\n1 provider is available 24/7.\n2 The on-site mental health team at MCJ is comprised of a psychiatrist, psychologist,\n3 marriage family therapist, licensed clinical social worker and psychiatric Registered Nurse.\n4 (CFMG  Plan  at  page  32.)  Mental  health  services  provided  on  site  include  crisis\n5 intervention, socialization programs, group therapy, medication management, psychiatric\n6 evaluations and individual therapy. (CFMG Plan at page 32.)  CFMG and custody staff\n7 also conduct monthly meetings to discuss the treatment and care of inmates with serious\n8 mental health conditions. \n9 The  mental  health  services  as  set  forth  in  the  CFMG  Plan  comply  with  the\n10 provisions of the Settlement Agreement approved by this Court on August 18, 2015. There\n11 is no need to expand CFMG’s Proposed Implementation Plan beyond what was intended\n12 and contemplated by the Settlement Agreement which was agreed upon by the parties after\n13 substantial negotiations and input from the Honorable Nathanael Cousins.\n14 D. Telepsychiatry.\n15 Plaintiffs are attempting to limit CFMG’s use of telepsychiatry. They recognize it\n16 may be appropriate for followup but not for patients beginning mental health treatment or\n17 in a mental health crisis. Plaintiffs believe CFMG’s telepsychiatry program should be\n18 revised to provide that telepsychiatry referrals be made by a psychiatrist or psychiatric\n19 nurse after an inmate has first received face-to-face care to start treatment and limit the use\n20 of telepsychiatry during a mental health crisis. \n21 Plaintiffs are attempting to impose conditions which were never contemplated by\n22 CFMG during settlement negotiations. Instead, CFMG argued that the definition of\n23 “face-to-face interview” did not preclude the use of telemedicine and/or telepsychiatry\n24 services. (Settlement Agreement at page 4, lines 19-21). CFMG does not believe the use\n25 of telepsychiatry should be limited to followup psychiatric encounters. It is appropriate to\n26 use the services whenever an inmate is in need of psychiatric services, unless specifically\n27 precluded in CFMG’s Plan.\n28\n4 5:13cv2354 PSG\nDEFENDANT CFMG'S MOTION FOR APPROVAL \nOF IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 532   Filed 04/01/16   Page 6 of 140\n1 E. Safety Cells.\n2 The use of safety cells in the correctional setting has been approved by the Ninth\n3 Circuit in the case of Henderson v. County of Kern, 45 F.3d 1310 (9th Cir. 1995).  Their\n4 use has been regulated per CCR Title 15, §1055, as follows:\n5 An inmate shall be placed in a safety cell only with the approval\nof the facility manager, the facility watch commander, or the\n6 designated physician; continued retention shall be reviewed a\nminimum of every eight hours. A medical assessment shall be\n7 completed within a maximum of 12 hours of placement in the\nsafety cell or at the next daily sick call, whichever is earliest.\n8 The inmate shall be medically cleared for continued retention\nevery 24 hours thereafter. A mental health opinion on placement\n9 and retention shall be secured within 24 hours of placement.\nDirect visual observation shall be conducted at least twice every\n10 thirty minutes. Such observation shall be documented. (Italics\nadded).\n11\nCFMG and the County have agreed to limit the use of safety cells and no inmate will\n12\nremain in a safety cell for greater than 24 continuous hours.  In addition, CFMG has agreed\n13\nto perform a Suicide Risk Assessment, including use of the Suicide Risk Assessment Tool\n14\nrecommended by Dr. Hayward, “after placement in or release from a safety cell.  Plaintiffs\n15\nbelieve the Suicide Risk Assessment should be performed by a qualified mental health\n16\nprovider within 15 minutes of placement. This is an unrealistic requirement which is not\n17\nsupported by any national or state standards. Title 15 requires that the mental health\n18\nevaluation should be performed within 24 hours. However, CFMG’s Implementation Plan\n19\nrequires that the evaluation occur within four hours of an inmate’s placement in the safety\n20\ncell. (CFMG’s Amended Plan at p. 33).\n21\nF.      Dental\n22\nCFMG has submitted a Dental Service Plan with staffing provisions which are\n23\ngreater than existed when Plaintiffs’ dental expert toured MCJ.  The adequacy of these\n24\nstaffing levels will be determined by the neutral monitors and adjusted as needed.\n25\nCFMG’s Dental Service Plan reflects a two-tiered system of services which are\n26\nprovided to inmates who are (1) incarcerated less than one year and services to inmates\n27\nwho are (2) incarcerated more than one year. (CFMG’s Implementation Plan at pages 98\n28\nto 112).\n5 5:13cv2354 PSG\nDEFENDANT CFMG'S MOTION FOR APPROVAL \nOF IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 532   Filed 04/01/16   Page 7 of 140\n1 CFMG’s Dental Service Plan includes  the Settlement Agreement requirement that\n2 dental services are provided in a “safe and sanitary” facility.  (CFMG’s Implementation\n3 Plan at page 96). In addition, the Plan requires that Dental Intake Screening will be\n4 performed by a qualified health care professional who has been trained by the dentist.\n5 (CFMG’s Implementation Plan at page 98).\n6 XI.     CONCLUSION\n7 The Implementation  Plan  submitted  by CFMG complies with  or exceeds  the\n8 requirements of the Final Settlement Agreement approved on August 18, 2015.  CFMG\n9 requests that this Court approve its Amended Implementation Plan and allow for a 45-day\n10 training period before actual implementation is required.\n11 DATED:  April 1, 2016 BERTLING & CLAUSEN, L.L.P.\n12\n13 By:      /s/Peter G.

Options for placement include: an in-patient mental \nhealth facility; the Outpatient Housing Unit; a receiving cell located in the \nbooking unit; or dorm A.  \n \nWhen CFMG determines that an inmate is no longer suicidal, and clears the \ninmate  from  suicide  precautions  or  suicide  watch,  CFMG  shall  make  a \nmedical recommendation regarding transitioning the inmate from suicide \nprecautions or suicide watch.  CFMG shall work with custody to place the \ninmate in the most appropriate setting.  Options for placement include: an \nin-patient mental health facility; the Outpatient Housing Unit; Transition \nCells in Administrative Segregation; receiving cells in the booking unit; dorm \nA or general population.  CFMG Mental Health Clinicians will provide these \ninmates with supportive contact and will follow-up with them until such \ntime the clinician determines the inmate's step-down plan is discontinued.   \n \nFor any inmate who has been housed in a safety cell for 24 consecutive \nhours or for more than 36 cumulative hours in any 3-day period, custody \nshall  promptly  begin  processing  the  inmate  for  transfer  to  either  an \nappropriate  in-patient  mental  health  facility  or  the  Natividad  Medical \nCenter emergency room for assessment.  It is recognized that on occasion \n63 \nCFMG’s Implementation Plan \nExhibit A \n 72\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 532   Filed 04/01/16   Page 74 of 140\nthere may be exigent circumstances which prevent compliance with these \nrequirements.  If  such  circumstances  occur,  a  memo  detailing  the \ncircumstances  shall  be  written  and  directed  to  the  Custody  Operations \nCommander. \n \nShould there be a disagreement regarding where an inmate should be placed \nfollowing release from a safety cell; the on duty sergeant will be contacted in \nan attempt to reach an agreement.  If a dispute still exists as to the placement \nof  an  inmate,  an  on-call  commander  will  be  contacted.    The  on-call \ncommander  will  have  final  decision-making  authority  as  to  placement.  \nHowever, any time there is a disagreement between medical and custody \nstaff as to placement of an inmate following release from a safety cell, a \nreport outlining the reasons for disagreement will be generated by the on-call \nsergeant.    These  reports  will  be  reviewed  on  a  monthly  basis  by  the \nOperations  Commander,  who  will  meet  with  the  medical  director  when \nnecessary to identify any systemic disagreements or issues.

TUBERCULOSIS IDENTIFICATION, CONTROL AND TREATMENT PROGRAM \n \n \n \nA.  Tuberculosis screening of all inmates will be performed at the time of intake by \na registered nurse using the Standardized Monterey County Jail Intake Health \nScreening Form. During the initial intake screening the registered nurse will ask \neach  inmate  whether  they  have  a  history  of  TB  disease,  or  if  they  have \npreviously been treated for LTBI or TB Disease.  If possible, documentation of \nany such history should be obtained from an inmate's prior medical records. \n \n \nB.  All incoming inmates will immediately be screened for symptoms of pulmonary \nTB by being asked if they have had a cough lasting greater than three weeks, \nbloody sputum, chest pain, fever, chills, night sweats, easy fatigability, loss of \nappetite  and  weight  loss.  Inmates  will  be  interviewed  systematically  to \ndetermine whether thy have experienced symptoms in recent weeks. Inmates \nwill be observed for the presence of cough or evidence of significant weight loss. \n \n \nC.  Any inmate with positive TB screening findings at the time of intake will be \nfollowed-up  by  a  registered  nurse  in  accordance  with  the  CDC \nrecommendations. A TB screening will be considered positive when an inmate \nanswers yes to any of the following questions: prolonged cough for greater than \n3 weeks, bloody sputum, weight loss/poor appetite, fever/chills, night sweats, \nunexplained chest pain or unusual fatigue. \n \n \nD.  Inmates who have symptoms suggestive of TB disease at the time of intake or \na history of inadequate treatment for TB disease, will immediately be placed in \n \nan Airborne Infection Isolation Room until they have undergone a thorough \nmedical  evaluation  by  a  medical  provider  which  including  a  TST,  chest \nradiograph, and, if indicated, sputum examinations. If deemed infectious, these \ninmates  will   remain   in   isolation   until   treatment   has   rendered   them \nnoninfectious. \n \n \nE.  Inmates who are placed in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room because they \nare suspected to have Infectious TB can be discontinued when infectious TB is \nconsidered unlikely and either another diagnosis is made that explains the \n68 \nCFMG’s Implementation Plan \nExhibit A \n 77\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 532   Filed 04/01/16   Page 79 of 140\n \nclinical syndrome or the patient had three negative acid-fast bacilli sputum-\nsmear results.  Patient for whom the suspicion of TB disease remains after the \ncollection of three negative AFB sputum-smear results should not be released \nfrom  airborne  precautions  until  that  are  on  standard  multidrug  anti-TB \ntreatment and are clinically improving. However, these inmates should not be \nhoused  in  an  area  in  which  other  patients  with  immune-compromising \nconditions are housed. \n \n \nF.  All inmates with confirmed TB disease should remain in an Airborne Infection \nIsolation Room until they have had three consecutive AFB sputum-smear results \ncollected 8 hours apart, with at least one being an early morning specimen; \nhaving received standard multidrug anti-TB treatment; and have demonstrated \nclinical improvement. \n \n \nG.  The  Airborne  Infection  Isolation  Rooms  will  be  monitored,  inspected  and \nmaintained in accordance with the CFMG ATD Procedure, a copy of which is \nattached as Exhibit H. \n \n \nH.  Tuberculosis signs and symptoms screening and skin testing (when indicated) \nshall be initiated within 7 days of admission to the facility; as part of the kitchen \nworkers' clearance examinations; as a component of the six-month physical \nexam; and annually thereafter, for the duration of incarceration. \n \n \nI.

If inmate is determined to be likely to have active TB disease, County \nTB Control shall be notified within 24 hours. \n \n \nM.   Latent TB Infection (LTBI):  LTBI continues to be a major public health problem \nin the United States. Infected persons usually have a positive tuberculin skin test \n(TST) reaction or positive Immune-Globulin Release Assay (IGRA), a normal chest \nx-ray (any abnormal chest x-ray needs referral to your provider for sputum \ntesting and additional imaging) and have no symptoms related to the infection \nand are not infectious: \n \n \n1.  Candidates for Preventive Therapy: All persons with suspected LTBI and \nnormal chest x-ray should be considered for therapy and the following list \nare those considered to be at highest risk for developing an active infection: \na.  Persons known to have HIV infection (TST result of 5mm or greater). \nb.  Person at risk for HIV infection (including persons who inject drugs) but \nwhose HIV status is unknown (5mm or greater). \n \n \nc.  Close contact of a person with infectious TB (5 mm or greater). \n \n \nd.

Persons whose TST reaction or IGRA result converted from negative to \npositive within the past 2 years (10 mm or greater increase if younger \nthan 35 years of age). \n \n \n2.  Tracking of all TST results, chest x-ray results, and treatment must be done \non all patients regardless of their expected length of stay.  Tracking will \noccur in each patient's chart as well as in the TB tracking log which is kept \nin the medical department. \n \n \n3.  Treatment Recommendations and Medication Regimens: All persons with \na positive TST or IGRA will get a chest x-ray and will be referred to the jail \nmedical provider to  discuss treatment options. An important point to \nremember is that starting therapy that cannot be completed is worse than \nnot starting treatment due to the development of drug resistant strains of \nTB. The following categories of inmates will help guide whether therapy \nshould be started and which therapy is preferred. \n \n \na.  Pregnant women: Generally preventive therapy should not be given to \npregnant  women  who  are  found  to  be  TST  or  IGRA  positive  on \nscreening with the following exceptions noted below. Isoniazid (INH) \ntherapy should be considered for pregnant women who were \n \n \n(1)  likely to have been recently infected with TB; or \n \n \n(2)  who have high-risk medical conditions, especially HIV infection \n \n \n(3)  Pregnant minors with positive TST or IGRA will be referred to the \nresponsible medical provider for evaluation and consultation with \nOB/GYN specialist for the decision of whether Isoniazid (INH) \ntherapy is to be initiated. \n \n \nb.  Persons who are confirmed to be incarcerated for greater than 6 \nmonths should receive 6 months of INH therapy or, if HIV infected, 9 \nmonths of INH therapy. \n \n \n   \n75 \nCFMG’s Implementation Plan \nExhibit A \n 84\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 532   Filed 04/01/16   Page 86 of 140\nc.  Persons who are confirmed to be incarcerated for greater than 3 \nmonths, but less than 6 months should receive 11 doses or 12 weeks \nof INH with Rifapentine (INH-RPT) weekly. Per the CDC, this must be \nDirectly Observed Therapy (DOT). \n \n \nd.  If an inmate is unexpectedly released early, every effort should be \nmade  to  arrange  for  completion  of  treatment  on  the  outside, \nparticularly if treatment was nearly complete. \n \n \ne.  Persons for whom INH therapy is contraindicated (such as past drug \nreaction, etc.), should be considered for Rifampin therapy. \n \n \n4.  For all persons who have no contraindications to begin therapy: \n \n \na.  Obtain a signed CFMG Consent for TB Therapy Form from patient, \nparents or guardian; counsel patient, parents or guardian regarding the \nside effects and toxicity problems associated with Isoniazid (INH) or \nother drug therapies noted above and the need to complete the full \ncourse of therapy. Verify a normal chest x-ray and instruct patient to \nreport any symptoms to health services staff. \n \n \nb.  Isoniazid (INH) 900 mg. PO bi-weekly; or, 300 mg PO daily, directly \nobserved therapy (DOT) for 6 or 9 months, depending on immune \nstatus.

Rifampin 600mg daily (max dose and based on body weight) for 4 \nmonths.  \n \nf.  Schedule for medical provider sick call every month for evaluation for \nsigns and symptoms of medication toxicity (i.e., loss of appetite, weight \nchanges, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dark urine, jaundice and/or rash. \n \n \ng.  Patients exhibiting any signs or symptoms of toxicity: refer to medical \nprovider sick call as soon as possible. \n \n \nh.  Individuals who are released from custody prior to completion of the \nfull course of treatment: need referral to own medical provider, health \nplan, or county public health agency.

PHARMACEUTICAL ADMINISTRATION \n \n \nThe procurement of pharmaceuticals is done under the supervision of a licensed \npharmacist in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws. Prescription \nmedications  will  be  administered  to  inmates  by  licensed  nursing  staff  in \naccordance  with  CFMG’s  Implementation  Plan  regarding  pharmacy \nadministration. A consulting pharmacist will be used for documented inspections \nand consultation on a regular basis, not less than quarterly. \n \nAdministering  medication,  as  it  relates  to  managing  legally  obtained  drugs, \nmeans the act by which a single dose of medication is given to the patient. The \nsingle  dose  of  medication  may  be  taken  either  from  stock  (undispensed),  or \ndispensed supply. \n \nDispensing,  as  it  relates  to  managing  legally  obtained  drugs,  means  the \ninterpretation  of  the  prescription  order,  the  preparation,  repackaging,  and \nlabeling of the drug based upon a prescription from a physician, dentist, or other \nprescriber authorized by law. \n \nDelivering medication as it relates to managing legally obtained drugs, means the \nact of providing one or more doses of a prescribed and dispensed medication to a \npatient. Delivering of medication may be done by either licensed or non-licensed \npersonnel, e.g., custody staff, acting on the order of a prescriber. \n \nA.  Administration of Medication \n \n \nTo assure safe, accurate methods of administering medication, the following \nprocedures will be strictly adhered to: \n \n \n1.  As a general policy, prescribed and over-the-counter medications will be \nadministered twice daily at intervals approximately 12 hours apart. Inmates \nrequiring  more  frequent  medications  will  receive  such  as  medically \nindicated. \n \n \n2.  All patients must be identified by the medication nurse by checking inmate's \narmband and/or I.D. badges.   Verify last names, first name and middle \nwhere applicable. If the inmate is not wearing an armband/I.D. badge, the \n78 \nCFMG’s Implementation Plan \nExhibit A \n 87\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 532   Filed 04/01/16   Page 89 of 140\nmedication will be held until the inmate is identified by correctional staff \nand armband/I.D. badge is obtained. \n \n \n3.  The medication nurse is responsible for and will verify: \n \n \na.  Appropriate medication, as ordered \nb.  Proper dose \nc.  Given to correct inmate \nd.  Given at correct time \ne.  Given by correct route (po, r, sq, etc.). \nf.  Vital signs taken where indicated. \n \n \n4.

Watching the inmate take the medication. \n \nb.  Checking for \"cheeking\" or \"palming\" to assure that medication has \nbeen ingested. \n \nc.  Having the inmate speak after taking the medication and/or drinks \nwater. \n \n \n5.  The medication nurse will keep the medication envelopes well out of the \nreach of inmates at all times. \n \n \n6.  The medication nurse will never: \n \n \na.  Reach into a cell. \n \nb.  Put face near a door opening. \n \n \n7.  When a prescribed substance is administered it will be recorded on the \ninmate's medication administration record (MAR). \n \n \n8.  If a prescribed substance is refused or withheld, a notation will be made on \nthe medication administration record (MAR) and the prescribing medical \nprovider shall be notified after three consecutive refusals. \n \n79 \nCFMG’s Implementation Plan \nExhibit A \n 88\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 532   Filed 04/01/16   Page 90 of 140\nB.  Prescription Medications \n \n \nMedications,  except  those  specifically  listed  on  the  policy  regarding \nnon-prescription drugs, will be given only on the order of the Physician. \nLong-term use of minor tranquilizers is discouraged. Psychotropic medications \nare prescribed only when clinically indicated and are not given for disciplinary \nreasons.  \n \nAll  nurses  administering  medications  will  be  trained  to  recognize  the \ncommon side effects associated with the use of psychotropic medications.  If \na nurse observes that an inmate is experiencing any of these side effects they \nwill document their  observations  in  the  medical  record and  schedule  the \npatient to see a medical provider at the next available sick call.  \n \n1.  Medication  will  be  ordered  in  writing  on  the  patient's  chart  by  the \nPhysician or FNP/PA, or written as a verbal order by the nurse. Verbal \norders must be co-signed by a physician within 7 days. \n \n \n2.  Medication orders will be transferred to the inmate's medication record \nand envelope.  Orders will be signed off in red ink when completed with \ndate, time and signature of the individual transcribing orders. \n \n \n \n3.

No \ncorrection fluid will be used on any permanent record. \n \n \n4.    D/C dates will be marked clearly in red. \n \n \n5.  Every health care provider who gives medication will sign the medication \nrecord. \n \n \n6.  If a prescribed substance is refused or withheld, a notation will be made on \nthe  medication  record,  and  the  provider  will  be  notified  after  three \nconsecutive refusals. \n \n   \n80 \nCFMG’s Implementation Plan \nExhibit A \n 89\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 532   Filed 04/01/16   Page 91 of 140\n \n7.    Medication may only be administered according to the direct order of the \nPhysician or P.A./F.N.P. \n \n \n8.  Each nurse will set up and give his/her own medication.  \nC.  Non-Prescription Medications \nInmates are encouraged to purchase non-prescription medications through the \ncommissary for self-care. Indigent inmates and those requiring over the counter \nmedications when commissary is not available may request such medications \nfrom  health  care  staff  through  the  sick  call  process.  The  responsible \nphysician/health authority along with custody administration will determine \nwhat medications will be sold over-the-counter at the commissary. \n \n \n1.  The  responsible  physician/health  care  authority  along  with  custody \nadministration has determined which medications and medical supplies will \nbe sold over-the-counter through commissary. \n \n \n2.  There is a limit on the amount of medications that can be purchased and \nheld by inmates. \n \n \n3.  Medications are provided to the inmate with their weekly commissary \npurchases in unit dose, sealed, labeled packaging. The commissary vendor \nconfirms that each inmate may only obtain maximum allowed each week, \nwhen filling the commissary order. \n \n \n4.  Inmates found to have more than the weekly allowed amount in their cell \nare subject to confiscation of the medication and disciplinary proceedings \nby custody staff. \n \n \n5.

Standards for Use of Tele‐Psychiatry \nCFMG provides 40 hours of on‐site psychiatric services at the Monterey County \nJail.  However, there are circumstances when a psychiatrist is unavailable to \nprovide on‐site services and inmates will then have access to a tele‐psychiatrist. \nThe circumstances when a psychiatrist is unavailable to provide services include, \nbut are not limited to: \n(1)

Diamond Pharmacy license: the Diamond Pharmacy pharmacist that dispenses medications \n7  to the Monterey County Jail in bulk or stock supply shall hold a California pharmacist license.   \n8  3.

Suicide Risk Assessment Tool: Plaintiffs object that Dr. Hayward’s Suicide Risk Assessment \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Tool lacks guidance on how to use the assessment results and request that the court order \nS de nre 17  Defendants to develop instructions for using the risk assessment tool.9  At oral argument, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Plaintiffs stated that Hayward was available to train CFMG and the County on the tool’s use.  \n19  This objection is resolved as follows: Hayward shall offer Defendants training on how to use \n20 \n21                                                   \n5 See Docket Nos. 531, 538. \n22 \n6 See Docket No. 531 at 4. \n23 \n7 See id. at 5-6. \n24 \n8 See Docket No. 532 at 3.  \n25 \n9 See Docket No. 531 at 8-9. \n26 \n27  2 \nCase No. 5:13-cv-02354-PSG \n28  ORDER GRANTING-IN-PART DEFENDANTS' MOTIONS FOR APPROVAL OF \nIMPLEMENTATION PLANS AND DENYING AS MOOT CFMG'S FIRST MOTION FOR \nAPPROVAL OF IMPLEMENTATION PLAN \n\n \n1  the suicide risk assessment tool.

While standing and \n19 \nmootness disputes in cases such as this are hardly new, the question of whether a private provider \n20 \nof jail medical facilities are services can face scrutiny under Title III of the Americans with \n21 \nDisabilities Act does appear to be novel.1  \n22 \n23 \n                                                           \n24  1 “Defendants also specifically raise and preserve the affirmative defense that all Plaintiffs’ have \nfailed to exhaust administrative procedures under the Prison Litigation Reform Act.

Defendants also \n26 \nreserve their right to assert the defense of statute of limitations.”  Docket No. 44 at 2.  Defendants \n27  made no further arguments on these points, however, so the court has not considered the Prison \nLitigation Reform Act or the statute of limitations here. \n28 \n1 \nCase No. 5:13-cv-02354-PSG \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO DISMISS \n\n \nThe first motion before the court is a motion to dismiss filed by Defendants County of \n1 \nMonterey and Monterey County Sheriff’s Office.2  The second motion to dismiss was filed by \n2 \n3  Defendant California Forensic Medical Group, Incorporated.3  Plaintiffs oppose,4 and the parties \n4  appeared for a hearing.5  Having considered the arguments, the court denies both motions. \n5 \nI.  BACKGROUND \n6 \nA. Factual  Background6 \n7 \nPlaintiffs are inmates or recently released inmates from the Monterey County jail.7  Each \n8 \nplaintiff has been jailed multiple times.8  The jail frequently houses more than 1,100 inmates per \n9 \nday,9 and inmates stay in the jail on average for 30-40 days.10  The vast majority of the jail’s \n10 \n \na\ni\nn 11  population constitutes pretrial detainees with unpredictable, but brief, lengths of stay.  The \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  complaint alleges a litany of substandard conditions at the jail, including: violence due to \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  understaffing, overcrowding, inadequate training, policies, procedures, facilities, and prisoner \nstri\nit 14 \nDs\n Di classification; inadequate medical and mental health care screening, attention, distribution, and \ns\ne \ntn 15 \nar\nte\nSh\nd ort 16 \neN\nt\nUnihe  17                                                             \nt\nor  2 See Docket No. 44 (amended by Docket No. 75).   \nF 18 \n3 See Docket No. 58.

See id. at 3. \n20 \n4 See Docket Nos. 77 and 83.  \n21 \n5 See Docket No. 100.   \n22 \n6 For the purposes of Defendants’ motions, unless otherwise noted, the court draws the following \n23 \nfacts from Plaintiffs’ second amended complaint, accepted as true.  See Docket No. 41. \n24 \n7 See Docket No. 77 at 1-2. \n25 \n8 See id. at 1.  \n26 \n9 See Docket No. 41 at ¶ 40. \n27 \n10 See Docket No. 77 at 1.   \n28 \n2 \nCase No. 5:13-cv-02354-PSG \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO DISMISS \n\n \nresources; and lack of policies and practices for identifying, tracking, responding, communicating, \n1 \nand providing accessibility for accommodations for prisoners with disabilities.11   \n2 \n3  The County provides inmates access to health care and services under a contract with \n4  CFMG, a private company that administers all jail health care facilities and services.12  The \n5 \ncontract took effect on April 1, 2012.13  The contract provides that CFMG “shall be responsible for \n6 \nthe medical care, dental care, and mental health care of an inmate commencing with [] booking.”14  \n7 \nCFMG is further responsible for “administering medications to inmates,” providing required \n8 \n“medical supplies, and medical record supplies,” and for “the cost of all pharmaceuticals \n9 \nadministered.”15  Under the contract, CFMG “shall determine the method, details and means of \n10 \n \na\ni\nn 11  performing services,” and CFMG’s Medical Director is “responsible to assure the quality of health \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  care provided.”16  CFMG employs over fifty staff members.17  \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  B. Procedural  Background \nstri\nit 14 \nDs\n Di Five plaintiffs filed an initial complaint.18  In eight causes of action seeking declaratory and \ns\ne \ntn 15 \nar\nte\nSh injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class, the complaint alleges the conditions in the jail violate \nd ort 16 \neN\nt\nUnihe  17  the Eights and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, Article I, Sections 7 and \nt\n \nr\nFo 18  17 of the California Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and \n19 \n                                                           \n11 See Docket No. 41 at ¶¶ 2-5, 7. \n20 \n21  12 See id. at ¶ 84. \n22  13 See Docket No. 41 at ¶ 41. \n23  14 See Docket No. 83 at 2 (App’x A at 18).  \n24  15 Id. at 21-23. \n25 \n16 Id.  \n26 \n17 See Docket No. 34 at ¶ 84. \n27 \n18 See Docket No. 1.  \n28   \n3 \nCase No. 5:13-cv-02354-PSG \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO DISMISS \n\n \nCal. Gov’t Code Section 11135.19  In a first amended complaint, eight named plaintiffs were \n1 \nadded.20  In a second amended complaint, nine new plaintiffs were added and one plaintiff was \n2 \n3  dismissed, resulting in the current total of 21 named plaintiffs.21   \n4  The County and Sheriff’s Office filed an initial motion to dismiss challenging the standing \n5 \nof one plaintiff not in custody when his claim was filed and the mootness of the claims of nine \n6 \nothers who were no longer in custody.22  In the meantime, Plaintiffs filed a motion for class \n7 \ncertification.23  Plaintiffs seek certification of a prisoner class, consisting of all current and future \n8 \nprisoners in the jail, and a prisoners with disabilities subclass, consisting of all current and future \n9 \nprisoners who have a qualifying disability.24   \n10 \n \na\ni\nn 11  CFMG also filed a motion to dismiss of its own, joining the County and Sheriff’s Office’s \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  motion based on standing as well as challenging Plaintiffs’ sixth cause of action against CFMG \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  under Title III of the ADA.25  Defendants then amended their motion to dismiss by dropping one \nstri\nit 14 \nDs\n Di plaintiff based on his re-incarceration and adding two others because they had been released from \ns\ne \ntn 15 \nar\nte\nSh\nd ort 16 \neN\nt\nUnihe  17 \nt\n \nr\no\nF 18 \n19 \n20                                                             \n19 See Docket Nos. 1, 16, and 41. \n21 \n \n20 See Docket No. 16. \n22 \n \n21 See Docket No. 41 at ¶¶ 11-31.  \n23 \n \n24  22 See Docket No. 44.    \n \n25  23 See Docket Nos. 48-56.   \n \n26 \n24 See Docket No. 56 at 20-21. \n27 \n25 See Docket No. 59.  \n28   \n4 \nCase No. 5:13-cv-02354-PSG \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO DISMISS \n\n \ncustody.26  In their reply brief, Defendants further dropped from their motion yet another plaintiff \n1 \nbecause he, too, returned to custody.27   \n2 \n3  II. LEGAL STANDARDS \n4  A.  12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss \n5 \nA complaint must contain “a short plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \n6 \nentitled to relief.”28  If a plaintiff fails to proffer “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is \n7 \nplausible on its face,” the complaint may be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief \n8 \nmay be granted.29  A claim is facially plausible “when the pleaded factual content allows the court \n9 \nto draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”30  But \n10 \n \na\nni 11  courts “are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”31  Under \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), “dismissal can be based on the lack of a cognizable legal theory or the \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.”32  A court may dismiss a claim \nstri\nit 14 \nDs\ni\ns D                                                            \ne \natrn 15  26 See Docket No. 75.   \nte\nSh  \ned Nort 16  27 See Docket No. 90 at 1, n.1.  Plaintiffs filed a sur-reply indicating that still another of those \nt\nUnihe  17  challenged is currently incarcerated in the jail and that another continues to reside in Monterey \n t County.  See Docket No. 98 at 3-4.  Plaintiffs have since introduced further evidence that another \nr\no\nF 18  plaintiff has been re-incarcerated, see Docket Nos. 114, 116, one of the released plaintiffs has been \nre-incarcerated, and that yet another was re-incarcerated and then released again.  See Docket No. \n19 \n125-1.  Defendants object to the evidence Plaintiffs present on this issue and its exhibits on the \ngrounds that the documents are not authenticated, the testimony in the supporting declaration is \n20 \nimproper expert testimony, and the declarant lacks personal knowledge.  Docket No. 90 at 7.  \nThese objections are improper and therefore overruled because they do not specifically identify \n21 \nwhich statements or exhibits are objectionable on which grounds. See Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(1)(B) \n22  (requiring that a party “state[] the specific ground” of an objection).   \n \n23  28 Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). \n24 \n29 Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). \n25 \n30 Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009). \n26 \n31 Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. \n27 \n32 Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep’t, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990).  \n28 \n5 \nCase No. 5:13-cv-02354-PSG \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO DISMISS \n\n \n“only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved \n1 \nconsistent with the allegations.”33   \n2 \n3  B.  Standing \n4  To demonstrate standing to seek equitable relief, Article III of the U.S. Constitution \n5 \nrequires that (1) a plaintiff has suffered an actual or threatened injury as a result of the defendant’s \n6 \nalleged illegal conduct; (2) the injury is “fairly traceable” to the defendant’s action; and (3) the \n7 \ninjury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.34  A plaintiff must establish standing as of \n8 \nthe filing of the complaint.35  Where multiple plaintiffs present the same class claims in multiple \n9 \ncomplaints, each plaintiff must establish standing as of the date of the filing in which the plaintiff \n10 \n \na\nni 11  first appears.36  Where a plaintiff seeks prospective injunctive relief, he also must demonstrate “that \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  he is realistically threatened by a repetition of [the violation].”37  “Where a named plaintiff is a \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  member of a plaintiff class, and ‘members of the class have repeatedly suffered personal injuries in \nstri\nit 14 \nDs\n Di the past that can fairly be traced to the [defendants’] standard . . . practices,’ the defendant’s \ns\ne \ntn 15 \nar\nte\nSh treatment of the class as a whole must be considered to determine whether the individual plaintiff \nd ort 16 \neN\nUnithe  17  ‘ha[s] been and will continue to be aggrieved by the defendants’ [illegal] pattern of conduct.”38 Put \nt\n \nr\nFo 18  another way, “[w]hen a named plaintiff asserts injuries that have been inflicted upon a class of \n                                                           \n19  33 Swierkiewicz v.

United Parcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d \n21 \n977, 985 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding under the first prong that the plaintiff must have suffered an \n22  injury in fact, i.e. one that is sufficiently “concrete and particularized” and “actual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical”); Lujan v. Defenders Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)). \n23   \n35 See County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 51-52 (1991); Monaco v.

Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 860-61 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).    \n27 \n38 Id. at 864 (quoting LaDuke v. Nelson, 762 F.2d, 1318, 1326 (9th Cir. 1985)).  \n28 \n6 \nCase No. 5:13-cv-02354-PSG \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO DISMISS \n\n \nplaintiffs, we may consider those injuries in the context of the harm asserted by the class as a \n1 \nwhole, to determine whether a credible threat that the named plaintiff’s injury will recur has been \n2 \n3  established.”39  \n4  An exception to the general rules regarding standing pertains to past inmates under \n5 \nsupervision.40  When a past inmate remains supervised by law enforcement and subject to unlawful \n6 \nconditions without engaging in illegal activity, that plaintiff maintains standing with regard to the \n7 \nunlawful policies or conditions he or she may confront.41  The question is whether plaintiffs have \n8 \n“demonstrate[d] a concrete injury and a realistic likelihood that the injury will be repeated.”42  In \n9 \nArmstrong v. Davis, the Ninth Circuit held California parolees with disabilities could challenge \n10 \n \na\ni\nn 11  policies and practices in state parole revocation proceedings that violated the ADA and the \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  Rehabilitation Act.43  The parolees could not be subjected to the discriminatory parole revocation \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  proceedings unless they were arrested and charged with violating the terms and conditions of their \nstri\nit 14 \nDs\n Di parole.  Because they could be arrested without a warrant and for violating parole terms that \ns\ne \ntn 15 \nar\nSthe prohibited otherwise legal conduct,44  parolees did not need to “engage in unlawful conduct to \nd ort 16 \neN\nUnithe  17  become subject to the unlawful practices they s[ought] to enjoin.”45  \nt\n \nr\no\nF 18                                                             \n39 Id. at 861.  \n19 \n40 Id. at 866. \n20 \n41 See id. at 860-6.   \n21 \n42 Taylor v.

Arrest for violating the terms and conditions of parole “led inexorably to the injury” of \n27 \nbeing subjected to the unlawful parole revocation procedures.  Id. at 866 n.25. \n28   \n7 \nCase No. 5:13-cv-02354-PSG \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO DISMISS \n\n \nC.  Mootness \n1 \n    Mootness is “the doctrine of standing set in a time frame: The requisite personal interest \n2 \n3  that must exist at the commencement of litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence \n4  (mootness).”46  In general, a case is moot if there is no longer any personal stake in the outcome47 \n5 \nor “‘present controversy as to which effective relief can be granted,’”48 even if the plaintiff had \n6 \nstanding at the time the complaint was filed.49  In L.A. v. Lyons,50 the Supreme Court held that \n7 \nwhere the plaintiff could only be “expos[ed] to the challenged course of conduct” by breaking the \n8 \nlaw, his claim was moot because the threat of future harm was too attenuated.   \n9 \nAn exception to the mootness doctrine applies in class actions “where it is ‘certain that \n10 \n \na\ni\nn 11  other persons similarly situated’ will continue to be subject to the challenged conduct and the \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  claims raised are ‘so inherently transitory that the trial court will not have even enough time to rule \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  on a motion for class certification before the proposed representative’s individual interest \nstri\nit 14 \nDs\n Di expires.’”51  In determining whether prisoners’ claims are inherently transitory, the court must \ns\ne \ntn 15 \nar\nte\nSh\nd ort 16 \neN                                                            \nt\nUnihe  17  46 U.S. Parole Comm’n v.

Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 (1983) (holding that neither the existence of past injury nor \nconjecture over the prospect of some future injury creates the case or controversy required for \n23 \njurisdiction.  The assumption is that a plaintiff “will conduct [his or her] activities within the law \n24  and so avoid prosecution and conviction” and subsequent incarceration (citing O’Shae v. Littleton, \n414 U.S. 488, 495-97 (1974)). \n25 \n51 Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, 133 S.

The reasoning for this flows from the principle established in Lyons.”79 \n5 \nPlaintiffs emphasize that because this is a class action for injunctive relief, the claims of the \n6 \nputative class and subclass members must be considered when evaluating standing and mootness, \n7 \nnot just those of the named plaintiffs who seek to represent the class.80  Plaintiffs argue they qualify \n8 \nfor the transitory exception, under which a named plaintiff need only have standing at the time they \n9 \nenter the dispute,81 considering that the population of the jail is “transitory, fluid, and constantly \n10 \n \na\ni\nn 11  changing and evolving.

Even those who can expect to remain in the jail for two \n4  years or more will likely move on before the resolution of this litigation, which in its second year \n5 \nhas yet to reach even the class certification stage.   \n6 \nSecond, the average length of incarceration for this largely pretrial detainee population is \n7 \nuncertain and short—only approximately 34 days.91  This is too short a period for the court to \n8 \nresolve a motion for class certification.   \n9 \nThird, because all inmates in the jail are alleged to be at risk simply by virtue of being \n10 \n \na\ni\nn 11  detained, it is “certain that other persons similarly situated will continue to be subject to the \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  challenged conduct.”92  Under these circumstances, the mooting of Plaintiffs’ individual claims, \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  even if before the filing of a motion for class certification, does not impact their standing as long as \nstri\nit 14 \nDs\n Di each plaintiff had standing when they entered the case.93   \ns\ne \ntn 15 \nar\nte\nSh\nd ort 16 \neN\nt\nUnihe  17                                                             \n t 89 See Docket No. 49-13, Ex.

Under Armstrong v.

While the general public is not \n5 \npermitted inside a jail at any given time, the government has the power to compel members \nof the public to a jail under certain circumstances. … [A] jail is more like schools and \n6 \nhospitals contemplated under the ADA, which also restrict public access in certain times \n7  and circumstances but are nonetheless designed and intended to provide services, goods, \nprivileges, and advantages to members of the public.118 \n8 \n \nThis same reasoning makes just as much sense when considering whether to understand whether \n9 \n“place of public accommodation” under Title III also covers private operations within jails.  \n10 \n \na\ni\nn 11  Although inartful in identifying CFMG as the accommodation itself, Plaintiffs have sufficiently \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  alleged that CFMG “operates” a professional office in the actual physical “place” of the jail to \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  provide the “public accommodation” of all required medical care.119 CFMG’s motion to dismiss \nstri\nit 14 \nDs\n Di must be denied. \ns\ne \ntn 15 \nar\nte\nSh IV.

The Court has certified this case as a class action.  The class is defined as \n7  \"all adult men and women who are now, or will be in the future, incarcerated in the \n8  Montere)'_ _C  ounty JaiL\"  The Court has also certified a sub-class of \"all qualified \n9  individuals with a disability, as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § \n10  705(9)(B), and California Government Code§ 129260) and (m), and who are now, or will \n11  be in the future, incarcerated in the Monterey County Jail.\" \n12  4.  The Court on April14, 2015, entered a Preliminary Injunction. \n13  5.  The purpose of this Settlement Agreement is to settle the above-captioned \n14  case.  The parties believe this agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to protect the \n15  interests of all parties. \n16  6.  Defendants deny every allegation in each of the Complaints filed in this case. \n17  This Settlement Agreement does not constitute, and shall not be construed, as an admission \n18  of or evidence of any act of deliberate indifference to any inmate's constitutional rights, \n19  violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, violation ofthe ADA, violation ofthe U.S. Constitution, or \n20  any other wrongdoing or liability by any party.  The Defendants expressly deny any \n21  liability.  Defendants deny that any of their policies, procedures and/or practices subject \n22  inmates to a risk of harm or result in any deliberate indifference to inmates' safety, \n23  medical, mental health, dental, or accessibility needs  in violation of their state or federal \n24  constitutional rights, state or federal law, or the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. The parties \n25  agree that nothing in this Settlement Agreement shall be used against any Defendant in any \n26  other litigation that has been or may be filed against any Defendant. \n27  7.  The Defendants state that prior to and since the initiation of this litigation, \n28  the County of Monterey and Monterey County Sheriffs Office (\"Monterey Defendants\") \n[2695914-1]  13-2354 PSG \nSettlement Agreement-Execution Copy \n\n1  and California Forensic Medical Group (\"CFMG\") had commenced significant initiatives \n2  to enhance the delivery of mental health services and medical care, improve the safety of \n3  the MCJ and improve jail and program accessibility, and the process has been ongoing \n4  throughout the course of the litigation. \n5  8.  The parties will jointly file this Settlement Agreement with the Court, and \n6  ask that the Court issue an order directing notice to the class, setting an objection period, \n7  and a fairness hearing (\"Preliminary Approval\"), and that the Court approve it as final after \n8  the fairness hearing (\"Final Approval\").  Final Approval is a condition precedent to the \n9  Agreement's effectiveness, except as to the specific steps that the parties herein agree to \n10  perform after Preliminary Approval. \n11  II.  PRELIMINARY AND FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSETTLEMENT \n12 \n9.

The parties recognize that pre-trial release, diversion, \n10  split sentencing, the use of home and GPS monitoring are also available and beneficial, \n11  and should be tracked, but are dependent on the discretion of the Monterey County \n12  Superior Court and District Attorney. \n13  1.  Prisoners with Disabilities \n14  1.  Defendants shall develop and implement an ADA \n15  Implementation Plan to improve accessibility to inmate programs and services.

Defendants shall furnish qualified sign language interpreters to \n4  any inmates for whom sign language is their only or primary method of communication, in \n5  all circumstances where a qualified sign language interpreter is necessary to ensure an \n6  inmate has an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, programs, \n7  services and activities offered by Defendants. The interactions for which Defendants must \n8  furnish qualified sign language interpreters include but are not limited to the intake \n9  process, at classification hearings, disciplinary hearings, all medical, mental health and \n10  dental treatment, religious services, educational classes such as Choices and Pride classes \n11  or the equivalent, Narcotics and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings or the equivalent, and \n12  any other interactions with staff that implicate an inmates' due process rights.  Defendants \n13  may employ alternatives to a live sign language interpreter such as video remote \n14  interpreting providing that Defendants demonstrate to the ADA monitor the efficacy of the \n15  alternatives employed.  Defendants need not maintain a full-time staff sign language \n16  interpreter, but may use on-call services. \n17  v.  Defendants shall implement a system to document that \n18  Defendants have provided qualified sign language interpreters or reasonable alternatives to \n19  inmates who need them and that the inmates have understood the information conveyed by \n20  the qualified sign language interpreter or alternative form of communication as outlined in \n21  Paragraph iv above. \n22  Vl.

If any monitor \n14  exceeds the budget for fees or costs without prior approval, he or she may be removed and \n15  replaced through the process described in Paragraph 36 above.  If the parties do not agree \n16  on removal, either party may refer the matter to the mediator, and if necessary to the Court \n17  to determine whether the monitor should be retained or removed. \n18  39.  The designated monitors shall have access to all jail facilities upon \n19  reasonable notice, to assess substantial compliance with this Settlement Agreement, and \n20  the incorporated Implementation Plans.  All site visits shall take place on consecutive days. \n21  There shall be no more than two (2) site visits in each year, per monitor, that the \n22  Settlement Agreement is in effect.  These visits may take up to two (2) days each. \n23  40.  The designated monitors shall have access to meet and interview personnel \n24  whose duties pertain to the provision of services and/or who work with inmates in the area \n25  of the expert's expertise. \n26  a.  The designated monitors shall have a reasonable opportunity to \n27  conduct confidential interviews of inmates to assess whether Defendants are in compliance \n28  with the terms of the Settlement Agreement and Implementation Plans. \n[2695914-1]  14  13-2354 PSG \nSettlement Agreement-Execution Copy \n\n1  b.  The designated monitors may request to review County or CFMG \n2  documents, except those documents protected by attorney-client or work product \n3  privileges, or by state or federal law, to monitor Defendants' compliance with the terms of \n4  this Settlement Agreement and all Implementation Plans.  If these documents are requested \n5  in conjunction with a site visit, Defendants will provide these documents to the extent \n6  feasible within ten (1 0) days prior to the visit. \n7  c.  During the site visits, the designated  medical, mental health and \n8  dental me>_11ito]_'S shall ha~~_re('I,SQnable _'!_ccess tq current inmate health records, induding \n9  mental health records, consistent with Defendants' obligations under  Federal and State \n10  law, as those obligations have been modified by Court order. \n11  d.  Monitors shall be provided with and agree to be bound by any \n12  protective or Court orders entered in this case to protect the confidentiality of prisoner \n13  records and security sensitive information. \n14  e.  The designated monitor will prepare a draft written report on the \n15  Defendants' efforts to meet the terms of this Settlement Agreement and all Implementation \n16  Plans at least twice a year and within 30 days of the later of the monitor's site inspection \n17  and the monitor's receipt of all requested documents and information, and in no case later \n18  than 45 days after the inspection.  Each report shall contain a determination of whether \n19  Defendants are \"substantially complying\" with the applicable Implementation Plan. The \n20  draft report will be delivered to all parties to this Agreement.  If the designated monitor \n21  concludes that Defendants have not substantially complied with the terms of any provision \n22  or provisions of the Settlement Agreement and Implementation plans, the designated \n23  monitor shall make recommendations as to actions they believe to be necessary to \n24  substantially comply with the terms of the provision or provisions.  The parties will have \n25  30 days to provide written comments, objections or to cure issues and 7 days to reply.  The \n26  monitor may re-inspect before issuing a final report.  Final reports shall be due 20 days \n27  after the later of the monitor's receipt of any comments, objections or replies, or any re-\n28  inspection. \n[2695914-1]  15  13-2354 PSG \nSettlement Agreement-Execution Copy \n\n1  41.  Plaintiffs are entitled to conduct reasonable monitoring of Defendants' \n2  compliance with this Agreement, including the right to inspect the jail, interview staff and \n3  inmates, review relevant records and observe practices related to Defendants' compliance \n4  with the provisions of this Agreement.  Plaintiffs' routine monitoring will not exceed four \n5  ( 4) inspections of not more than one day per inspection of Jail operations per year, limited \n6  to no more than one attorney and one expert per inspection.  Defense counsel reserves the \n7  right to be present for any inspections and/or staff interviews.  The parties shall develop a \n8  monthly report for the purposes of monitoring and tracking performance under the \n9  Implementation Plans.  Plaintiffs shall use the Office of the Public Defender for \n10  monitoring as appropriate.  The parties shall meet and confer regarding any disputes \n11  regarding the scope and extent of inspections or access to information, and if necessary, \n12  shall seek the involvement of the mediator. \n13  42.  Defendants will notify Plaintiffs at least 30 days in advance of any scheduled \n14  training sessions related to substantial compliance with this Settlement Agreement and/or \n15  the Implementation Plans, and shall provide Plaintiffs with all training materials at least 10 \n16  days in advance of the training. \n17  43.  The parties shall agree on a mechanism for promptly addressing concerns \n18  raised by Plaintiffs' counsel regarding individual class members and emergencies.  Before \n19  contacting Defendants, Plaintiffs' counsel will make every effort to verify that the \n20  concerns of individual class members are accurate, substantive and not frivolous, such as \n21  having the Office of the Public Defender meet with the individual class members. The \n22  parties agree that Defendants may appeal to the Court for modification of this paragraph \n23  should a significant number of concerns raised by Plaintiffs' counsel be found to be \n24  inaccurate, lacking substantive, or frivolous. \n25 \n26  VI.  RESERVATION OF JURISDICTION AND ENFORCEMENT \n27  44.  The parties consent to the reservation and exercise of jurisdiction by the \n28  District Court over all disputes between and among the parties arising out of this \n[2695914-1]  16  13-2354 PSG \nSettlement Agreement-Execution Copy \n\n1  Settlement Agreement.  The parties agree this Settlement Agreement shall not be construed \n2  as a consent decree. \n3  45.  For the purposes of jurisdiction and enforcement of this Settlement \n4  Agreement only, the parties jointly request the Court find that this Settlement Agreement \n5  satisfies the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A) in that it is narrowly drawn, \n6  extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the \n7  least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of the Plaintiffs. \n8  In the even_t th~ Court fin!l~tbat:l)~encia11!S have not substantially complied with the \n9  Agreement, it shall in the first instance require Defendants to submit a plan for approval by \n10  the Court to remedy the deficiencies identified by the Court. In the event the Court \n11  subsequently determines that the Defendants' plan did not remedy the deficiencies, the \n12  Court shall retain the power to enforce this Agreement through all remedies provided by \n13  law, excluding the imposition of a consent decree. \n14  46.  The Court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Settlement \n15  Agreement and, once they are approved, the Implementation Plans for a period of five \n16  years, unless Plaintiffs' counsel can demonstrate to the Court through noticed motion that \n17  jurisdiction should be retained for a longer period.  The Court shall have the power to \n18  enforce the terms of this Settlement Agreement through specific performance and all other \n19  remedies permitted by law or equity, excluding the imposition of a Consent Decree. \n20  47.  The Court shall be the sole forum for the enforcement of this Settlement \n21  Agreement.  Any order to achieve substantial compliance with the provisions of this \n22  Settlement Agreement shall be subject to the applicable provisions of the Prison Litigation \n23  Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 3626. \n24  48.  If Plaintiffs' counsel believes that Defendants are not substantially \n25  complying with any of the acts required by this Settlement Agreement or the \n26  Implementation Plans, they shall notify Defendants in writing of the facts supporting their \n27  belief.  Defendants shall investigate the allegations and respond in writing within 30 days. \n28  If Plaintiffs' counsel are not satisfied with Defendants' response, the parties shall conduct \n[2695914-1]  17  13-2354 PSG \nSettlement Agreement-Execution Copy \n\n1  negotiations to resolve the issue(s).  If the parties are unable to resolve the issue(s) \n2  satisfactorily, the parties agree to present the issue(s) to the agreed upon mediator.  If the \n3  parties are still unable to resolve the issue(s), either party may move the Court for any \n4  relief permitted by law or equity.  In cases of particular urgency that are central to the \n5  purpose of the Settlement Agreement, a party may opt to bring disputes directly to the \n6  District Court, or both parties may consent to bypass the use of the mediator if the parties \n7  agree the issue should be briefed to the Court with prior notice to the mediator. \n8  49.  This Settlement Agreement may be enforced only by the parties hereto. \n9  Nothing contained in this Settlement Agreement is intended or shall be construed to \n10  evidence of an intention to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the \n11  parties hereto. \n12  VII.  TERMINATION \n13  50.  The parties or any party may agree or request a finding that Defendants are \n14  in substantial compliance with a particular Implementation Plan or any material part \n15  thereof and have maintained substantial compliance for a period of twelve months.  [See \n16  definitions and monitoring sections.]  Such a finding will result in a reduction or \n17  suspension of monitoring of that issue.  If Plaintiffs present evidence that Defendants are \n18  no longer in substantial compliance with requirements previously found in substantial \n19  compliance, the Court may order additional relief including but not limited to reinstating \n20  full monitoring. \n21  51.  If at any time, the Court finds that Defendants are in substantial compliance \n22  with all requirements of this Settlement Agreement and all Implementation Plans, \n23  Defendants may move the Court for an order terminating the Settlement Agreement. \n24  52.  The parties intend to work in good faith to achieve substantial compliance \n25  with all requirements of this Settlement Agreement and all Implementation Plans within \n26  five (5) years from Court approval of the Settlement Agreement and Implementation Plans. \n27  If Plaintiffs believe that the Defendants are not in substantial compliance at the end of five \n28  ( 5) years from Court approval of the Implementation Plans, Plaintiffs may move for an \n[2695914-1)  18  13-2354 PSG \nSettlement Agreement-Execution Copy \n\n1  order extending jurisdiction over the Settlement Agreement.  In order to extend \n2  jurisdiction, the Plaintiffs must establish and the Court must determine that Defendants are \n3  not in substantial compliance.  Unless jurisdiction is extended by the Court, the Settlement \n4  Agreement shall terminate five (5) years from Court approval of the Settlement Agreement \n5  and Implementation Plans.  Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the parties' rights to \n6  challenge or appeal any finding as to whether Defendants are not in substantial compliance \n7  with the Settlement Agreement and all Implementation Plans, or consequent order entered \n8  by the Court_._ _____________ _ \n9  VIII.  AMENDMENTS \n10  53.  By mutual agreement, the parties may change the terms of this Settlement \n11  Agreement, including, but not limited to, the timetables for taking specific actions, \n12  provided that such mutual agreement is memorialized in writing, signed by the parties and \n13  approved by the Court. \n14  54.  Defendants shall not make any changes to any policy provision \n15  implementing the provisions of this Settlement Agreement and Implementation Plans \n16  without providing Plaintiffs a written draft of such policy or policies, for their review and \n17  comment. \n18  55.  Without prior agreement of the parties, Defendants may not amend any \n19  policy provision to conflict with the terms of this Settlement Agreement while the \n20  Settlement Agreement remains in effect. \n21  56.  Defendants shall not approve any changes to a policy maintained by its \n22  health care provider that conflicts with the terms of this Settlement Agreement and \n23  Implementation Plans. \n24  IX.  FUNDING \n25  57.  The parties acknowledge that implementation of this Settlement Agreement \n26  and the Implementation Plans are subject to the availability and receipt of appropriated \n27  funds. \n28 \n[2695914-1]  19  13-2354 PSG \nSettlement Agreement-Execution Copy \n\n1  58.  The parties further acknowledge that the lack of funding does not preclude \n2  the Court from entering any order to achieve compliance with this Settlement Agreement \n3  that comports with the applicable provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 \n4  U.S.C. Section 3626 and with other applicable law, provided that Defendants reserve the \n5  right to assert that the lack of funding should be taken into account in any remedial order. \n6  59.  Defendants agree to make all possible good faith efforts to seek all necessary \n7  funding to implement this Settlement Agreement and all Implementation Plans. In the \n8  event that the parties are unable to agree as to whether there is sufficient funding to \n9  implement fully this Settlement Agreement and Implementation Plans, the parties shall \n10  meet and confer, and if necessary, consult the Court.  In the event that the parties continue \n11  to be unable to agree, either Defendants or Plaintiffs may seek the assistance of the Court \n12  and if necessary consult the mediator. \n13  X.  ATTORNEY'S FEES AND EXPENSES \n14  60.  Attorney's fees and expenses shall be addressed as follows. \n15  61.  Plaintiffs shall provide the Court and Defendants with a fees application \n16  including the supporting materials provided by Civil L.R. 54-5. \n17  62.  Fees and expenses through Final Approval of Settlement Agreement, \n18  including approval of all Implementation Plans:  Plaintiffs agree not to seek fees and \n19  expenses from the Court in an amount above $4.8 million, for fees and expenses incurred \n20  through Final Approval of the Settlement Agreement, including approval of all \n21  Implementation Plans. Defendants agree not to object to plaintiffs' petition for fees and \n22  expenses up that amount.  The parties acknowledge that Court approval of the fees and \n23  expenses is required. \n24  63.  Fees and expenses after Final Approval of Settlement Agreement: \n25  Plaintiffs may petition the Court for an award of no more than $250,000 per year in fees \n26  and expenses arising from monitoring work, inspections, negotiations, meet and confer \n27  processes, mediation, review of documents, and correspondence with class members, until \n28  termination of Court enforcement.  The parties contemplate that Plaintiffs will use the \n[2695914-1]  20  13-2354 PSG \nSettlement Agreement-Execution Copy \n\n1  services of the Public Defender as part of this post-settlement monitoring and enforcement. \n2  In any petition to the Court for fees and expenses, the Court should consider the efficiency \n3  of the services rendered, including how Plaintiffs' counsel allocated services among the \n4  different private counsel and the Public Defender.  The $250,000 annual cap does not \n5  apply to (1) Plaintiffs' motions to enforce the Settlement Agreement and Implementation \n6  Plans; and (2) Plaintiffs' opposition to any motions filed by defendant(s) arising out of the \n7  Settlement Agreement and Implementation Plans.  The standard for Plaintiffs' eligibility \n8  for fees and expense~arisi11g frol!l ~!aintifft__m  otions to the Court shall be that no fees and \n9  expenses shall be awarded unless the Court finds (1) that the motion or opposition was \n10  necessary to enforce substantial rights of the class under the Eighth Amendment and \n11  Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I,  Sections 7 and 17 of \n12  California Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Rehabilitation Act, or \n13  California Government Code§ 11135; and, (2) that Plaintiffs attempted to resolve the \n14  matter and/or narrow the issues as much as possible by meeting and conferring with \n15  Defendants, taking full opportunity of recourse to the mediator before presenting the issues \n16  to the Court.  Defendants shall be eligible for an award of fees and costs from plaintiffs' \n17  private counsel, and Plaintiffs shall receive none, in the event that the Court finds that \n18  Plaintiffs' motion was frivolous, unreasonable or groundless, or that Plaintiffs continued to \n19  litigate it after it clearly became so.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs agree that they may not seek \n20  more than $150,000 each year in fees and expenses on motions to enforce the Settlement \n21  Agreement. \n22  64.  If the Court determines that any enforcement motion is filed or opposed in \n23  bad faith, it may award sanctions in the form of attorneys' fees and expenses, among other \n24  remedies. The caps in Paragraph 63 do not apply to enforcement motions opposed in bad \n25  faith by Defendants. \n26  65.  The parties commit to work together in good faith to resolve any future \n27  disputes over fees and expenses.  They agree to confer, and mediate, before presenting a \n28  fee dispute motion to the Court. \n[2695914-1]  21  13-2354 PSG \nSettlement Agreement-Execution Copy \n\n1 \n2  XI.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS \n3  66.  Plaintiffs agree that if the Court does not grant Final Approval of this \n4  Settlement Agreement, then Defendants reserve their right to appeal the preliminary \n5  injunction entered in this case. \n6  67.  The parties agree to issue a joint press release announcing the settlement. \n7  68.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties as to all \n8  claims raised by Plaintiffs in this action, and supersedes all prior agreements, \n9  representations, statements, promises, and understandings, whether oral or written, express \n10  or implied, with respect to this Agreement. Each Party represents, warranties and \n11  covenants that it has the full legal authority necessary to enter into this Agreement and to \n12  perform the duties and obligations arising under this Agreement.  The County Defendant \n13  shall be the last signatory to this agreement.  This agreement may be signed in counterparts \n14  and a copy shall be as good as an original and may be introduced as evidence. \n15  69.  This is an integrated agreement and may not be altered or modified, except \n16  by a writing signed by all representatives of all parties at the time of modification. \n17  70.  This Agreement shall be binding on all successors, assignees, employees, \n18  agents, and all others working for or on behalf of Defendants and Plaintiffs. \n19 \n20  DATED:  ROSEN BIEN GALVAN & GRUNFELD LLP \n21 \nBy: \nMichael W.

The Monterey County Jail in Salinas, California, is broken in nearly every \n3 way.  Defendants County of Monterey (“Monterey County” or the “County”), Monterey \n4 County Sheriff’s Office (“Sheriff’s Office”), and California Forensic Medical Group \n5 (“CFMG” and collectively “Defendants”) knowingly provide inadequate security, medical \n6 care, and mental health care to prisoners in the Monterey County Jail (the “Jail”), exposing \n7 prisoners to substantial, unreasonable, and life-threatening risks of harm.  Defendants also \n8 routinely discriminate against and fail to accommodate prisoners with disabilities, \n9 excluding them from programs, services, and activities offered in the Jail. \n10 2.  This civil rights class action lawsuit seeks to remedy the dangerous, \n11 overcrowded, discriminatory, and unconstitutional conditions in the Jail.  The twenty-one \n12 individual Plaintiffs in the Jail bring this action against the Defendants on behalf of \n13 themselves and those similarly situated. \n14 3.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief under the United States and \n15 California constitutions against Defendants for their deliberate indifference to the \n16 exceedingly high levels of prisoner violence in the Jail.  The causes of the violence—\n17 understaffing, overcrowded housing units, lack of training and adequate policies and \n18 procedures, antiquated and poorly designed Jail facilities, and an inadequate prisoner \n19 classification system—are well-known to and tolerated by Defendants.  Violent incidents \n20 between prisoners occur with alarming frequency and in nearly every area of the Jail.  \n21 According to the Sheriff’s Office’s own incident reports from January 2011 through early-\n22 September 2012, there were more than 150 separate incidents of violence between \n23 prisoners.  In more than 100 of these incidents, at least one prisoner required medical \n24 treatment.  Violent incidents were reported in 26 out of 29 housing units.  Violence at the \n25 Jail is not an anomaly; it is a way of life.  Forcing prisoners to live under ongoing threats \n26 of serious bodily injury is cruel and inhumane, especially when Defendants have the ability \n27 to prevent and reduce such violence. \n28 4.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief under the United States and \n[1144098-2]    1 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page4 of 137\n \n1 California constitutions against Defendants for their deliberate indifference to their failure \n2 to provide prisoners with minimally adequate medical care.  Monterey County outsources \n3 the provision of medical care to prisoners in the Jail to CFMG, a private corporation, \n4 which provides deficient medical care in nearly every respect.  Prisoners at the Jail, most \n5 of whom are pretrial detainees or charged with violations of parole or probation, are not \n6 adequately screened for serious medical problems upon arrival at the Jail, and Defendants \n7 lack an effective system for prisoners to request medical or dental care.  When prisoners do \n8 receive care, it is often after a delay of weeks or even months.  The medical care staff \n9 employed by CFMG are insufficient in number to care for the more than 900 prisoners in \n10 the severely overcrowded Jail.  Both prisoners who arrive at the Jail with existing medical \n11 care needs and those who develop conditions in the Jail fail to receive timely or \n12 appropriate treatment, resulting in unnecessary and prolonged pain, suffering, worsening \n13 of their conditions, and sometimes even death.  As a result of Defendants’ failure to \n14 provide minimally adequate medical care, Defendants are deliberately indifferent to the \n15 substantial risk of harm faced by all prisoners. \n16 5.  Plaintiffs also seek declaratory and injunctive relief under the United States \n17 and California constitutions against Defendants’ deliberate indifference to their failure to \n18 provide prisoners with minimally adequate mental health care.  Monterey County also \n19 outsources the provision of mental health care to prisoners in the Jail to CFMG, which \n20 provides deficient mental health care in nearly every respect.  Prisoners are not adequately \n21 screened for serious mental health problems upon arrival at the Jail.  Defendants lack an \n22 effective system for prisoners to request care.  When prisoners do receive mental health \n23 care, it is often after a delay of weeks or even months, and may not include appropriate and \n24 necessary housing, medication, therapy, psychosocial intervention, and other mental health \n25 treatment.  Both prisoners who arrive at the Jail with existing mental health concerns and \n26 those who develop conditions in the Jail fail to receive appropriate treatment.  Defendants’ \n27 approach to prisoners with serious mental health problems (including suicidality) relies too \n28 heavily on placing such prisoners in “rubber rooms”—filthy rooms with no features other \n[1144098-2]    2 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page5 of 137\n \n1 than a slot in the door for food and a grate in the floor for a toilet—which only exacerbates \n2 and prolongs their already dire mental health crises.  In the last four years alone, there have \n3 been three completed and more than a dozen attempted suicides at the Jail.  As a result of \n4 Defendants’ failure to provide minimally adequate mental health care, Defendants are \n5 deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of harm faced by all prisoners. \n6 6.  Defendants’ failure to protect prisoners from violence and failure to provide \n7 minimally adequate medical and mental health care are particularly egregious given that \n8 Defendants have been aware of these problems and their causes for years, yet have failed \n9 to take the necessary actions to ameliorate the unconstitutional and illegal conditions.  In \n10 2007, the County commissioned a third-party evaluation of the Jail, which resulted in a \n11 report, dated June 19, 2007, entitled “County of Monterey, Office of the Sheriff, Needs \n12 Assessment” (hereinafter “2007 Needs Assessment” or “2007 Assessment”), which is \n13 attached hereto as Exhibit A.  The 2007 report concluded that “[t]he current combination \n14 of insufficient beds, an inadequate detention facility and understaffing has resulted in an \n15 almost untenable situation.”  2007 Assessment at Ex. 1-2.  In 2011, the County asked the \n16 third-party consultant to update the 2007 report to reflect amendments to state law and \n17 changes within the Sheriff’s Office and the Jail population.  This updated report, dated \n18 December 30, 2011, reached the exact same, word-for-word conclusion:  “The current \n19 combination of insufficient beds, an inadequate detention facility and understaffing has \n20 resulted in an almost untenable situation.”  County of Monterey, Office of the Sheriff, Jail \n21 Needs Assessment, December 30, 2011 (hereinafter “2011 Jail Needs Assessment” or \n22 “2011 Assessment”), attached hereto as Exhibit B, at Ex. 2.  Defendants’ deliberate \n23 indifference to prisoners’ safety and medical and mental health is unconscionable, and \n24 must be stopped to prevent additional unnecessary loss of life, pain, and suffering. \n25 7.  Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), Section 504 of the \n26 Rehabilitation Act (“Rehabilitation Act”), and California Government Code § 11135, \n27 Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants as a remedy for their \n28 systemic and willful discrimination against, and failure to provide reasonable \n[1144098-2]    3 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page6 of 137\n \n1 accommodations in programs, services, and activities to, prisoners in the Jail who have \n2 disabilities.  Defendants lack adequate policies and practices for identifying and tracking \n3 prisoners with disabilities and the accommodations those prisoners require.  Defendants \n4 have no adequate administrative grievance process available to prisoners to request \n5 reasonable accommodations.  Defendants do not provide effective communication or basic \n6 and reasonable accommodations, such as sign language interpreting services and hearing \n7 aids, to prisoners with hearing, speech, and other communication impairments, even for \n8 critical interactions with Jail staff, including for intake and classification, disciplinary \n9 hearings, and medical and mental health appointments.  Many areas of the Jail are \n10 physically inaccessible to prisoners with disabilities, both because Defendants refuse to \n11 permit prisoners to possess needed assistive devices and fail to house prisoners with \n12 disabilities in accessible parts of the Jail.  Defendants’ systemic failure to accommodate \n13 prisoners with disabilities results in the widespread exclusion of prisoners with disabilities \n14 from many of the programs, services, and activities offered by Defendants, including \n15 health care services, exercise, religious services, sleeping, and educational and vocational \n16 programs.  Moreover, Defendants’ lack of adequate policies and procedures makes \n17 prisoners with disabilities vulnerable to exploitation and violence by other prisoners and \n18 increases their risk of serious injury or death. \n19 8.  As a remedy for the statutory and constitutional violations described herein, \n20 Plaintiffs seek a declaration that Defendants are violating federal and state law and an \n21 injunction compelling Defendants to provide prisoners with adequate protection from \n22 violence from other prisoners, to provide prisoners with adequate medical and mental \n23 health care, and to provide reasonable accommodations to and cease discriminating against \n24 prisoners with disabilities. \n25 JURISDICTION \n26 9.  This Court has jurisdiction over the claims brought under federal law \n27 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.  This Court has jurisdiction over the claims \n28 brought under California law pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and \n[1144098-2]    4 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page7 of 137\n \n1 injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 2201, and 2202, 29 U.S.C. § 794a, 42 U.S.C. \n2 §§ 1983 and 12117(a), California Government Code § 11135, and Article I, Sections 7 and \n3 17 of the California Constitution. \n4 VENUE \n5 10.  Venue is properly in this Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1), in that \n6 Plaintiffs’ claims for relief arose in this District and one or all of the Defendants reside in \n7 this District. \n8 PARTIES \n9 11.  PLAINTIFF CAIN AGUILAR was most recently detained at Monterey \n10 County Jail on July 6, 2013.  During a prior term in the Jail, Plaintiff AGUILAR suffered a \n11 fractured cheekbone, other facial injuries, slurred speech, and loss of vision after being \n12 attacked by another inmate on February 10, 2013.  The injury caused him severe pain, left \n13 him unable to open his mouth, and has resulted in ongoing pain, headaches, and blurred \n14 vision.  Plaintiff AGUILAR did not receive adequate care from Defendants immediately \n15 following the incident.  He also received inadequate pain management for his pain both \n16 before and after surgery to fix his fractured cheek bone.  Defendants failed to provide \n17 Plaintiff AGUILAR timely access to a proper soft diet, which resulted in him not being \n18 able to eat for nearly two weeks after his surgery, and in significant weight loss, dizziness, \n19 and a more difficult recovery.  Plaintiff AGUILAR continues to experience blurred vision \n20 in his right eye.  An outside medical specialist recommended he see a specialist for his \n21 vision problems, but despite numerous requests to medical staff through sick slips and \n22 requests to custody staff through a grievance, he has yet to see such a specialist.  Plaintiff \n23 AGUILAR has also had problems getting timely responses to his sick call slips concerning \n24 painful rashes and boils on his head and neck and has not received a response to his sick \n25 slip request to see the Jail therapist concerning his ongoing depression and anxiety.  \n26 Plaintiff AGUILAR is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 \n27 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) and (m). \n28 12.  PLAINTIFF HA (TRAN) COBB was most recently detained at Monterey \n[1144098-2]    5 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page8 of 137\n \n1 County Jail on April 4, 2013.  Following her arrival at the Jail, Defendants provided \n2 untimely and inadequate care for Plaintiff COBB’s severe kidney stones, including failing \n3 to timely diagnose her condition, failing to provide appropriate pain management, failing \n4 to provide appropriate and timely post-operative care after Plaintiff COBB had a surgical \n5 drain inserted into her kidney, failing to timely schedule necessary surgery for the removal \n6 of Plaintiff COBB’s kidney stones, and failing to provide appropriate and timely post-\n7 operative care.  As a result of Defendants’ inadequate medical care, Plaintiff COBB has \n8 suffered severe and unnecessary pain and was placed at risk of permanent loss of kidney \n9 function.  Plaintiff COBB still has a number of kidney stones for which she will continue \n10 to require treatment.  Plaintiff COBB is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. \n11 § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(m). \n12 13.  PLAINTIFF SUSAN DILLEY was detained at Monterey County Jail on \n13 June 28, 2013.  She has been housed in the Women’s Section of the Jail since that date \n14 with the exception of one week in August, when she was temporarily released for the Jail.  \n15 Plaintiff DILLEY has preliminarily been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (“MS”).  For \n16 the entire time she has been in the Jail she has suffered from physical and neurological \n17 problems, including numbness in her legs, problems maintaining her balance, substantial \n18 nerve-related pain, cognitive issues, and memory loss.  It is extremely difficult and causes \n19 her severe pain any time she has to walk long distances or up more than one or two stairs.  \n20 During her time in the Jail, she has requested or been prescribed by outside medical \n21 doctors numerous accommodations for her impairments, including a cane, an extra \n22 mattress, a shower chair, and special shoes.  She experienced substantial delays and other \n23 problems obtaining each of these accommodations.  For example, the shower chair \n24 Defendants provided her is too large for both her and the chair to safely fit in the shower at \n25 the same time.  Even with the accommodations, Plaintiff DILLEY encounters numerous \n26 obstacles in the Jail that prevent her from accessing Jail activities, programs, and services.  \n27 She has not been able to access a number of programs, including the exercise yard, \n28 religious services, and educational programs, because they are only offered to her up a \n[1144098-2]    6 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page9 of 137\n \n1 long flight of stairs that she can only climb with great difficulty and pain.  Plaintiff \n2 DILLEY is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. \n3 § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) and (m). \n4 14.  PLAINTIFF CONNIE DOBBS has been detained at the Jail since September \n5 15, 2012.  While in custody in November 2012, Plaintiff DOBBS sustained a fractured \n6 nose, a permanent post-traumatic tremor in her right hand from mild traumatic brain \n7 injury, and nerve damage, pain, and numbness in her left leg, knee, and ankle when she fell \n8 at the courthouse while shackled at the ankles, waist, and wrists.  Defendants failed to \n9 provide Plaintiff DOBBS with timely and appropriate medical care, including, but not \n10 limited to, failing to receive timely diagnostic tests, proper pain medication, or follow-up \n11 tests after her serious injury.  For example, Defendants did not diagnose the nasal fracture \n12 for nearly two weeks.  As result of her fall and other chronic, pre-existing injuries, Plaintiff \n13 DOBBS has chronic pain, particularly in her left leg, hip, knee, and lower back.  \n14 Defendants did not provide her proper pain management for over four months after her \n15 fall.  Though she currently is prescribed Gabapentin and ibuprofen for her pain, she has \n16 experienced interruptions in these medication when her prescriptions are set to expire; she \n17 has been required to put in sick call slips and grievances to restart her medications.  Even \n18 with the medication, Plaintiff DOBBS has impaired mobility and cannot access all of the \n19 programs and services of the Jail, such as religious services, because it is difficult for her \n20 to climb the stairs to get there.  Plaintiff DOBBS also suffers from Right Carpal Tunnel \n21 syndrome which may have been exacerbated by her fall.  Despite the recommendation by \n22 her outside neurologist for a hard wrist splint over a year ago, and despite Jail medical staff \n23 ordering her such wrist splint seven months ago, she has still yet to receive the splint.  \n24 Without the splint Plaintiff DOBBS continues to experience pain, numbness, and tingling \n25 in her right wrist and hand which keeps her up at night.  Plaintiff DOBBS is a person with \n26 a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California \n27 Government Code § 12926(m). \n28 15.  PLAINTIFF SEAN ESQUIVEL was detained at Monterey County Jail on \n[1144098-2]    7 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page10 of 137\n \n1 March 3, 2014.  Plaintiff ESQUIVEL is a full-time wheelchair user.  He has been a \n2 prisoner in the Jail many times over the past 20 years, including three times in the past \n3 year.  During previous terms in the Jail, Defendants have failed to accommodate Plaintiff \n4 ESQUIVEL’s disability by, among other things, denying Plaintiff ESQUIVEL access to \n5 functioning wheelchairs and placing him in housing units where he could not access the \n6 shower, toilet, or the exercise yard.  Plaintiff ESQUIVEL also has a large tumor on his leg \n7 that causes him considerable pain and requires consistent medical attention, including \n8 repeated surgeries and follow up care.  Defendants have repeatedly failed to provide \n9 Plaintiff ESQUIVEL with appropriate medical care for his tumor, including failing to \n10 follow post-operative orders in ways that placed him at risk for infection and other \n11 complications and caused him pain.  Plaintiff ESQUIVEL also has sleep apnea and \n12 requires the use of a CPAP machine to sleep safely.  Defendants have failed to provide him \n13 with a CPAP machine in a timely manner during his last two stays at the Jail.  Moreover, \n14 Defendants only permit Plaintiff ESQUIVEL to use the CPAP machine in the infirmary, \n15 meaning he cannot not sleep until custody staff are available to bring him from his housing \n16 unit to the infirmary—sometimes as late as 1 am—and has to wake up to return to his \n17 dorm when custody staff are available—sometimes as early as 4 am.  Plaintiff ESQUIVEL \n18 also suffers from a number of chronic medical conditions, including diabetes, asthma, and \n19 hypertension.  Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiff ESQUIVEL with the insulin, \n20 inhalers, medication, and treatment he needs to manage these conditions in a safe and \n21 consistent manner.  Finally, Plaintiff ESQUIVEL has serious mental health conditions \n22 including depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), and anxiety, for \n23 which he is currently receiving no treatment at the Jail.  Plaintiff ESQUIVEL is a person \n24 with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California \n25 Government Code § 12926(j) and (m). \n26 16.  PLAINTIFF RAMONA GIST has been a prisoner in the Jail approximately \n27 ten times over the past fifteen years, including three times over the past two years.  \n28 Plaintiff GIST was most recently detained at Monterey County Jail on December 20, 2013.  \n[1144098-2]    8 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page11 of 137\n \n1 Plaintiff GIST has a history of mental health conditions and suffers from schizophrenia, \n2 bipolar disorder, anxiety, and insomnia.  These conditions make it difficult for Plaintiff \n3 GIST to effectively communicate with Jail staff, to understand the rules and processes of \n4 the Jail, and to access Jail programs and services without accommodations.  Defendants \n5 have repeatedly failed to provide Plaintiff GIST with appropriate and timely mental health \n6 care, including, but not limited to, denying her access to psychiatric medications \n7 prescribed by her outside physician.  For example, Defendants previously denied \n8 prescribed psychiatric medications to Plaintiff GIST for up to 90 days upon her booking \n9 into the Jail.  When Defendants deny Plaintiff GIST her medications, her mental health \n10 deteriorates and she suffers unnecessarily.  Plaintiff GIST additionally has developmental \n11 disabilities, including fetal alcohol syndrome and mild Down syndrome.  Plaintiff GIST \n12 encounters obstacles to participating in the Jail’s educational programs due to these \n13 disabilities.  Upon information and belief, she is unable participate in the Jail’s GED \n14 program because she has difficulty understanding the classes.  If there were special \n15 education opportunities she would participate.  Plaintiff GIST also has a number of \n16 physical medical conditions, including scoliosis and congenital hip problems, from which \n17 she experiences chronic pain.  Despite numerous requests, Defendants have failed to \n18 provide Plaintiff GIST with appropriate medical care for these conditions, including, but \n19 not limited to, failing to provide the muscle relaxant she is prescribed by her outside \n20 physician.  Plaintiff GIST’s conditions affect her balance, causing her to fall often and \n21 making it painful to walk for long periods or upstairs.  Plaintiff GIST encounters numerous \n22 obstacles in the Jail that prevent her from accessing Jail activities, programs, and services, \n23 including the exercise yard, religious services, and Alcohol and Narcotics Anonymous \n24 classes, because of her cognitive impairments, mental illness, and physical disabilities.  \n25 Plaintiff GIST is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. \n26 § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) and (m). \n27 17.  PLAINTIFF MARTHA GOMEZ has been detained at the Jail since \n28 January 13, 2014.  She has previously been detained in the Jail on a number of other \n[1144098-2]    9 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page12 of 137\n \n1 occasions.  Plaintiff GOMEZ experiences chronic pain due to injuries and degenerative \n2 conditions including back pain, numbness and stiffness in her legs, pain in her right side \n3 from pinched nerves, pain from arthritis in her knee and hands, and pain from when a \n4 disease destroyed much of her muscle in her left shoulder.  Plaintiff GOMEZ also suffers \n5 from chronic hypertension, migraines and dementia.  Plaintiff GOMEZ frequently falls and \n6 injures herself, which happens often due to her pain and degenerative conditions.  Plaintiff \n7 GOMEZ uses a walker to ambulate.  Defendants deprived Plaintiff GOMEZ of a walker \n8 for two weeks, despite her repeated requests, which caused her serious problems \n9 ambulating in the Jail and accessing Jail programs, services, and activities, including the \n10 bathroom.  Plaintiff GOMEZ has had and still is having problems receiving appropriate \n11 and timely pain medication for her chronic conditions.  Plaintiff GOMEZ also has mental \n12 health problems which cause her anxiety, cause her to hear voices, and make it difficult for \n13 her to sleep and cope with her various problems.  Defendants have failed to provide \n14 Plaintiff GOMEZ with timely and appropriate mental health care, including psychiatric \n15 medications and other treatment.  Plaintiff GOMEZ is a person with a disability as defined \n16 in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) \n17 and (m). \n18 18.  PLAINTIFF GEORGE GREIM was detained most recently at Monterey \n19 County Jail in September 2012.  Plaintiff GREIM has a long history of severe mental \n20 illness, and experiences severe anxiety, insomnia, and depression.  Defendants are aware \n21 of Plaintiff GREIM’s psychiatric conditions, but have repeatedly failed to provide him \n22 with adequate care, treatment, or medication.  In late-July 2013, Plaintiff GREIM was \n23 transferred to the Alameda County Jail pursuant to a contract between Monterey County \n24 and Alameda County, described in Paragraph 178, infra.  Plaintiff GREIM was transferred \n25 back to the Monterey County Jail on or about September 6, 2013.  When Plaintiff GREIM \n26 returned to the Jail from Alameda County Jail, Defendants discontinued the psychiatric \n27 medication he had been provided in Alameda County.  Due to Defendants’ failure to \n28 timely and adequately determine and treat Plaintiff GREIM’s serious mental illness, he \n[1144098-2]    10 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page13 of 137\n \n1 experienced significant mental health decompensation, with increasing anxiety, racing \n2 thoughts, depression, and insomnia.  As a result, Plaintiff GREIM had difficulty \n3 communicating effectively with Jail staff, understanding the rules and processes of the Jail, \n4 and accessing Jail programs and services without accommodations.  Plaintiff GREIM was \n5 also a victim of violence at the Jail in which custody staff did not intervene, due to \n6 Defendants’ serious understaffing and lack of appropriate supervision of prisoners at the \n7 Jail.  Additionally, Plaintiff GREIM has an injured right knee, which has caused him \n8 serious pain throughout his time in the Jail.  Defendants have failed to provide adequate \n9 care for his knee.  Plaintiff GREIM is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. \n10 § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) and (m). \n11 19.  PLAINTIFF DENNIS GUYOT was detained at Monterey County Jail on \n12 March 3, 2013.  On March 15, 2013, Plaintiff GUYOT was assaulted by a group of other \n13 prisoners at the Jail, outside of the visual and audio supervision of any staff.  Defendants \n14 unreasonably failed to protect Plaintiff GUYOT and failed to timely intervene in the \n15 attack.  As a result of the assault, Plaintiff GUYOT experienced serious dental trauma for \n16 which he had to undergo invasive oral surgery.  Plaintiff GUYOT also suffered a \n17 concussion, and continues to suffer from blurred vision, sensitivity to light, and serious \n18 migraines.  Defendants failed to provide adequate medical care for his post-concussion \n19 medical needs, including, but not limited to, egregiously delaying in referring him for \n20 necessary specialist evaluations.  Plaintiff GUYOT is a person with a disability as defined \n21 in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code \n22 § 12926(m). \n23 20.  PLAINTIFF JESSE HERNANDEZ was detained at Monterey County Jail on \n24 April 28, 2012.  He remained in the Jail until September 27, 2013, when he was released \n25 from the Jail to participate in a supervised home confinement program in lieu of serving \n26 the remainder of his Jail term.  From September 27, 2013 until February 19, 2014, he lived \n27 in Salinas, California, and was supervised by the Monterey County Probation Department.  \n28 On February 19, 2014, he was arrested related to his home confinement and incarcerated in \n[1144098-2]    11 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page14 of 137\n \n1 the Jail.  He has been in the Jail since February 19, 2014.  Prior to his initial incarceration, \n2 Plaintiff HERNANDEZ underwent an ileostomy as treatment for serious gunshot wounds.  \n3 Defendants provided untimely and inadequate medical care, including, but not limited to, \n4 repeated failures to reverse, and delays in reversing, the ileostomy.  Even after Plaintiff \n5 HERNANDEZ finally received the ileostomy reversal surgery in December 2012, \n6 Defendants failed to provide adequate medical care, including, but not limited to, proper \n7 post-operative follow-up care.  As a result of Defendants’ delayed and inadequate medical \n8 care, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ has suffered from unnecessary and avoidable pain and \n9 symptoms, including, but not limited to, intestinal swelling, bleeding, severe stomach pain, \n10 fevers, cold sweats, and an obstructed bowel.  On two occasions in December 2012 and \n11 January 2013, delays by Defendants to respond to emergencies related to Plaintiff \n12 HERNANDEZ’s post-operative care caused Plaintiff HERNANDEZ serious pain, resulted \n13 in hospitalizations of one week and seven weeks respectively, and placed Plaintiff \n14 HERNANDEZ’s life at grave risk.  When Plaintiff HERNANDEZ was arrested on \n15 February 19, 2014, he was scheduled for abdominal surgery the following day.  \n16 Defendants refused to permit him to move forward with the scheduled surgery and have \n17 not rescheduled him for the surgery.  In the past and currently, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ has \n18 been denied appropriate pain medications for his serious and painful abdomen and \n19 shoulder injuries.  Plaintiff Hernandez still suffers serious pain and requires medical \n20 attention for his abdomen and shoulder injuries.  Plaintiff HERNANDEZ is a person with a \n21 disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California \n22 Government Code § 12926(m). \n23 21.  PLAINTIFF JASON HOBBS was detained at Monterey County Jail on \n24 November 12, 2013.  Plaintiff HOBBS suffers from a number of serious medical and \n25 psychiatric conditions.  He has been diagnosed with asthma, Hepatitis C, and degenerative \n26 disc disease.  Plaintiff HOBBS also suffers from depression and anxiety, which make it \n27 difficult for him to communicate effectively with Jail staff.  Around 2006, Plaintiff \n28 HOBBS had major back surgery to fuse part of his spine at L4-S1.  Plaintiff HOBBS’s \n[1144098-2]    12 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page15 of 137\n \n1 back problems, which cause him constant pain, were severely aggravated when another \n2 prisoner in the Jail attacked him, without provocation, on November 17, 2013.  The \n3 damage he sustained in the attack has caused him serious problems with walking and \n4 balance, and significant pain.  After the attack, Defendants failed to provide Plaintiff \n5 HOBBS with adequate medical treatment, including, but not limited to, adequate pain \n6 medication, rehabilitative services, and access to outside medical specialists.  In addition, \n7 Defendants did not timely provide him with a cane which he needed and requested to \n8 ensure his balance when walking.  Moreover, because of the lack of a safe and adequate \n9 shower chair in his housing unit, on December 22, 2013, Plaintiff HOBBS fell while \n10 showering and further aggravated his back condition.  Finally, in July 2013 during a prior \n11 term in the Jail, despite Plaintiff HOBBS’s requests, Defendants refused to provide him \n12 with a lower bunk housing assignment; that same month, forced to sleep in the middle \n13 bunk of a triple bunk, Plaintiff HOBBS fell and injured his back attempting to climb down \n14 from his bed.  Plaintiff HOBBS is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. \n15 § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) and (m). \n16 22.  PLAINTIFF GLENDA HUNTER was detained at Monterey County Jail on \n17 March 16, 2013.  Plaintiff HUNTER has been released from custody at the present time; \n18 however, she is on probation under the supervision of Monterey County Probation \n19 Department until September 2014.  As such, she may be incarcerated in the Jail at any time \n20 without establishing a violation of any law and with little to no judicial process, subjecting \n21 her to the violations of her constitutional and statutory rights described herein.  Plaintiff \n22 HUNTER has been diagnosed with numerous medical conditions, including diabetes, \n23 fibromyalgia, high blood pressure, chronic back pain, bone cancer, and seizures, and she \n24 has been prescribed and requires various medications to treat her illnesses and alleviate her \n25 symptoms.  Despite repeated requests, Defendants failed to provide timely and appropriate \n26 medical care, including, but not limited to, failing to provide Plaintiff HUNTER with \n27 necessary prescription medications and treatment.  Plaintiff HUNTER has also been \n28 diagnosed with mental illness, including manic depression, dementia, anxiety, and panic \n[1144098-2]    13 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page16 of 137\n \n1 attacks, all of which make it difficult for Plaintiff HUNTER to communicate effectively \n2 with Jail staff.  Plaintiff HUNTER requires mental health treatment and other \n3 accommodations to alleviate her symptoms and to function in the Jail.  Defendants failed \n4 to provide timely and appropriate mental health care to Plaintiff HUNTER, including, but \n5 not limited to, appropriate medications (which Plaintiff HUNTER brought with her to the \n6 Jail but which were taken from her by Defendants), and timely and adequate mental health \n7 assessments, treatment, and interventions.  As a result of Defendants’ inadequate medical \n8 and mental health care, Plaintiff HUNTER experienced unnecessary and avoidable pain \n9 and symptoms during her incarceration, including, but not limited to pain, nightmares, \n10 anxiety, panic attacks, and auditory hallucinations.  Plaintiff HUNTER is a person with a \n11 disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California \n12 Government Code § 12926(j) and (m). \n13 23.  PLAINTIFF ALBERT KEY was detained at Monterey County Jail on \n14 March 17, 2013.  Plaintiff KEY is a Vietnam War veteran with a long history of post-\n15 traumatic stress syndrome and bipolar disorder, and has received psychiatric care and \n16 medications from various providers including doctors employed by Defendants and by the \n17 California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (“CDCR”) for over a decade.  \n18 Nevertheless, on multiple occasions when he has arrived at Monterey County Jail, \n19 Defendants have subjected him to their inhumane and medically unjustified \n20 “detoxification” process, during which he is denied prescribed psychiatric medication for \n21 90 days.  During each incarceration, Plaintiff KEY has experienced extreme delays in \n22 obtaining correct and appropriate psychiatric medications, and other necessary mental \n23 health interventions and care, and as a result suffers auditory hallucinations, racing \n24 thoughts, severe depression, nightmares, and periods of suicidal ideation.  Plaintiff KEY \n25 also has a recurrent tumor on his neck for which Defendants have failed to provide \n26 appropriate medical care.  As a result of Defendants’ inadequate medical and mental health \n27 care, Plaintiff KEY has experienced unnecessary and avoidable pain and symptoms during \n28 his incarceration.  Plaintiff KEY is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. \n[1144098-2]    14 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page17 of 137\n \n1 § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) and (m). \n2 24.  PLAINTIFF BRANDON MEFFORD was detained at Monterey County Jail \n3 on December 3, 2013.  Plaintiff MEFFORD has severe and chronic mental illness, \n4 including borderline personality disorder, severe depression and anxiety, and ADHD, all of \n5 which make it difficult for Plaintiff MEFFORD to communicate effectively with Jail staff, \n6 understand Jail rules and processes, and access Jail programs and services.  In prison, \n7 CDCR officials considered Plaintiff MEFFORD eligible for inpatient and enhanced \n8 outpatient levels of care.  Plaintiff MEFFORD has previously attempted suicide on \n9 multiple occasions and has a strong tendency to self-mutilate when anxious.  While at the \n10 Jail, Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiff MEFFORD with timely and appropriate \n11 mental health care.  Plaintiff MEFFORD has been placed in the Jail’s punitive and \n12 unsanitary rubber rooms for periods as long as three days without receiving appropriate \n13 care from mental health care staff and without being adequately observed by Jail custody \n14 staff.  Defendants have also housed Plaintiff MEFFORD by himself in an administrative \n15 segregation unit; Plaintiff MEFFORD is only permitted outside of his cell for a maximum \n16 of one hour per day.  These isolating conditions negatively affect his mental health, cause \n17 him significant anxiety, and occasionally lead him to engage in acts of self-harm.  In \n18 addition, he has been provided with inadequate and inconsistent psychotropic medications \n19 to manage his conditions and has not been provided with adequate therapy.  Plaintiff \n20 MEFFORD also suffers from chronic medical conditions, including asthma and \n21 hypertension.  Defendants have failed to provide adequate treatment of his hypertension \n22 and have, at various times, refused to provide him with an inhaler.  Plaintiff MEFFORD \n23 was also attacked by another prisoner while in the presence of custody staff, who failed to \n24 intervene in a timely manner.  Plaintiff MEFFORD is a person with a disability as defined \n25 in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) \n26 (m). \n27 25.  PLAINTIFF WESLEY MILLER was detained at Monterey County Jail on \n28 January 8, 2013.  Plaintiff MILLER has severe Type 1 diabetes.  As of October 31, 2013, \n[1144098-2]    15 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page18 of 137\n \n1 Defendants had not provided Plaintiff MILLER with consistent and appropriate treatment \n2 for his diabetes, resulting in multiple serious diabetic episodes, seizures, and periods of \n3 unconsciousness.  On February 11, 2013, an employee of Defendant CFMG improperly \n4 administered insulin to Plaintiff MILLER, resulting in his emergency transport to \n5 Natividad Medical Center in an unconscious state and his near death.  Plaintiff MILLER is \n6 losing his vision as a result of his diabetes, and Defendants, as of October 31, 2013, failed \n7 to ensure appropriate and necessary care for his vision loss, including failing to ensure \n8 timely visits to necessary specialists.  As of October 31, 2013, Defendants also failed to \n9 provide effective communication and otherwise to accommodate Plaintiff MILLER’s \n10 vision impairment to ensure he could participate in programs, services, and activities at the \n11 Jail.  As a result of Defendants’ inadequate medical care and failures to accommodate \n12 Plaintiff MILLER’s disability, he has suffered unnecessary and avoidable pain, diabetic \n13 complications, and permanent loss of vision.  Plaintiff MILLER is a person with a \n14 disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California \n15 Government Code § 12926(m). \n16 26.  PLAINTIFF RICHARD MURPHY was detained at Monterey County Jail on \n17 January 18, 2013.  Plaintiff MURPHY has a mobility impairment and requires a cane or \n18 walker to ambulate without significant pain.  Despite repeated requests made by Plaintiff \n19 MURPHY, Defendants failed to provide him with reasonable accommodations to allow \n20 him to walk without pain, and to access the programs and services offered by Defendants.  \n21 Plaintiff MURPHY also has nerve damage in his back, and requires pain medication as \n22 well as cortisone shots.  Despite his repeated requests, Defendants failed to provide \n23 Plaintiff MURPHY with timely or adequate medical care, including, but not limited to, \n24 necessary medications at the Jail.  Plaintiff MURPHY has been diagnosed with mental \n25 illness and has been prescribed and requires various prescription psychiatric medications to \n26 treat his illness and alleviate his symptoms.  Despite repeated requests, Defendants failed \n27 to provide timely and appropriate mental health care, including, but not limited to, the \n28 failure to provide correct dosages of the medications Plaintiff MURPHY requires, the \n[1144098-2]    16 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page19 of 137\n \n1 failure to adequately monitor the administration of medications, and the failure to provide \n2 adequate psychotherapy and other treatments and interventions.  As a result, Plaintiff \n3 MURPHY experienced unnecessary and avoidable pain and symptoms, including, but not \n4 limited to, hearing voices, seeing shadows, depression and suicidality, and inability to \n5 sleep more than a few hours per night.  Defendants placed Plaintiff MURPHY in a rubber \n6 room on at least five occasions.  Plaintiff MURPHY is a person with a disability as defined \n7 in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) \n8 and (m). \n9 27.  PLAINTIFF JAMES JEFFREY NICHOLS was detained at Monterey \n10 County Jail on June 20, 2013.  Plaintiff NICHOLS has a permanent mobility impairment \n11 arising from a motor vehicle accident many years ago.  Although he normally uses a cane \n12 to ambulate, when he arrived at the Jail he neither had nor was provided with any assistive \n13 devices.  On June 21, 2013, the staff at the Jail provided him with a wheelchair after he \n14 presented to medical staff with complaints of falling on his head three times.  After \n15 entering the Jail, Plaintiff NICHOLS was assigned to a middle bunk which was difficult \n16 and painful for him to access.  Defendants then moved him to the Jail’s “Rotunda” area \n17 where, although the bed assigned to him was accessible, he was not able to access the \n18 recreational yard because of structural barriers.  Because Defendants provided Plaintiff \n19 NICHOLS with a wheelchair rather than his accustomed cane, he was less physically \n20 active at the Jail than he is able and would like to be, suffered deterioration of his overall \n21 physical condition, and was denied equal access to programs, services, and activities \n22 offered by Defendants.  Plaintiff NICHOLS also has brain injuries from the same car \n23 accident that resulted in his mobility impairment.  The brain injuries impair both his \n24 cognitive function and his left arm, of which he only has partial use.  Plaintiff NICHOLS is \n25 a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and \n26 California Government Code § 12926(j) and (m). \n27 28.  PLAINTIFF ANGEL PEREZ was detained at Monterey County Jail on \n28 December 30, 2012.  Plaintiff PEREZ has a potentially cancerous tumor on his right foot.  \n[1144098-2]    17 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page20 of 137\n \n1 During his time in the Jail, Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiff PEREZ with timely \n2 and appropriate medical care, including, but not limited, failing to provide diagnostic \n3 services and treatment for his tumor.  Despite the fact that multiple doctors at Natividad \n4 Medical Center have ordered that Plaintiff PEREZ see an expert in orthopedic oncology at \n5 a tertiary facility to examine his tumor, Defendants have failed over the course of six \n6 months to send Plaintiff to such an expert.  Plaintiff PEREZ has been told that if he does \n7 not receive treatment or evaluation from such an expert, he is at risk of having his foot \n8 amputated.  Despite Plaintiff PEREZ’s use of the sick slip and grievance process, he has \n9 not been able to receive timely and adequate treatment for the severe pain he experiences \n10 from the tumor, nor has he been able to receive adequate information about when he will \n11 be treated for the tumor and what kind of treatment he should expect to receive.  The tumor \n12 on his foot also cause Plaintiff PEREZ tremendous pain and impairs his ability to walk.  \n13 Defendants have failed, at various times, to provide Plaintiff PEREZ with appropriate and \n14 timely pain medications.  Plaintiff PEREZ is a person with a disability as defined in 42 \n15 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(m). \n16 29.  PLAINTIFF SARAB SARABI was detained at Monterey County Jail on \n17 February 2, 2013.  Plaintiff SARABI had a mobility impairment for many months as a \n18 result of a serious injury he sustained to his right leg when he was attacked by another \n19 prisoner at the Jail.  Plaintiff SARABI did not receive timely or adequate medical care \n20 from Defendants for his injury.  Plaintiff SARABI was released from Monterey County \n21 Jail to a three-year term of supervision by Monterey County Probation Department.  As \n22 such, he may be incarcerated in the Jail at any time without establishing a violation of any \n23 law and with little to no judicial process, subjecting him to the violations of his \n24 constitutional and statutory rights described herein.  Plaintiff SARABI is a person with a \n25 disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California \n26 Government Code § 12926(m). \n27 30.  PLAINTIFF CLYDE WHITFIELD was detained at Monterey County Jail on \n28 November 30, 2013.  Plaintiff WHITFIELD has severe narcolepsy with cataplexic attacks.  \n[1144098-2]    18 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page21 of 137\n \n1 Narcoleptics may fall asleep at any time, and, without treatment, may sleep for upwards of \n2 20 hours a day.  Cataplexy is a sudden loss of muscle control that may occur anywhere \n3 without warning, causing Plaintiff WHITFIELD to collapse and risk serious injury.  When \n4 not in the Jail, Plaintiff WHITFIELD controls these conditions with a combination of \n5 medications, Provigil and Xyrem, prescribed for him by a doctor.  Defendants have failed \n6 to provide Plaintiff WHITFIELD with appropriate and timely treatment for his narcolepsy.  \n7 Defendants have not provided Plaintiff WHITFIELD with Xyrem, which controls \n8 cataplexy.  As a result, Plaintiff WHITFIELD has experienced four cataplexic attacks since \n9 being detained on November 30, 2013.  Normally, Plaintiff WHITFIELD experiences one \n10 such attack approximately every six months.  Defendants also did not provide Plaintiff \n11 WHITFIELD with Provigil for approximately two months after his arrest, despite knowing \n12 he was prescribed the medication prior to incarceration.  During that time, Plaintiff \n13 WHITFIELD was unable to leave his bed most hours of the day and spent 20 hours a day \n14 asleep.  As a result, Plaintiff WHITFIELD experienced serious depression and anxiety and \n15 was put at increased risk for violence and theft from other prisoners.  Plaintiff \n16 WHITFIELD also has sleep apnea.  Plaintiff WHITFIELD is a person with a disability as \n17 defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code \n18 § 12926(j) and (m). \n19 31.  PLAINTIFF ROBERT YANCEY was detained at Monterey County Jail on \n20 December 2, 2012.  He has a hearing impairment and has been completely deaf since birth.  \n21 Plaintiff YANCEY also has a speech impairment that makes it impossible for him to be \n22 understood when speaking.  His primary method of communication is American Sign \n23 Language.  Plaintiff YANCEY ordinarily is able to communicate in a limited manner using \n24 written notes; however, for much of his time in the Jail, his right hand was in a cast, \n25 making it difficult and painful for him to write legibly.  Despite multiple requests, Plaintiff \n26 YANCEY did not receive reasonable accommodations from Defendants to allow him to \n27 access the programs and services offered by Defendants.  Defendants never provided \n28 Plaintiff YANCEY with a sign language interpreter at any time during his time in the Jail.  \n[1144098-2]    19 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page22 of 137\n \n1 Plaintiff YANCEY is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. \n2 § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) and (m). \n3 32.  DEFENDANT COUNTY OF MONTEREY (the “COUNTY” or \n4 “MONTEREY COUNTY”) is a public entity, duly organized and existing under the laws \n5 of the State of California.  Under its authority, Defendant COUNTY operates and manages \n6 the Jail and is, and was at all relevant times mentioned herein, responsible for the actions \n7 and/or inactions and the policies, procedures, practices, and customs of the MONTEREY \n8 COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE and its respective employees and/or agents.  The Board of \n9 Supervisors for the COUNTY authorized and approved the contract between Defendant \n10 MONTEREY COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE and Defendant CALIFORNIA FORENSIC \n11 MEDICAL GROUP INCORPORATED for CFMG to provide medical and mental health \n12 care to prisoners in the Jail.  The COUNTY by law retains the ultimate authority over and \n13 responsibility for the health care, treatment, and safekeeping of Plaintiffs and the class they \n14 seek to represent.

DEFENDANT CALIFORNIA FORENSIC MEDICAL GROUP \n25 INCORPORATED (“CFMG”) is a for-profit corporation organized under the laws of the \n26 State of California.  Pursuant to a contract with the SHERIFF’S OFFICE that was \n27 approved by the Board of Supervisors for the COUNTY, CFMG provides all health care \n28 services to prisoners in the Jail, including medical and mental health care.  The current \n[1144098-2]    20 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page23 of 137\n \n1 contract extends from April 1, 2012 through June 30, 2015.  At all times when CFMG and \n2 its employees provide medical and mental health care to prisoners in the Jail, CFMG and \n3 its employees have acted and continue to act under color of state law.

DEFENDANTS FAIL TO PROTECT PRISONERS FROM INJURY OR \nVIOLENCE FROM OTHER PRISONERS \n17  \n18 37.  Defendants MONTEREY COUNTY, the MONTEREY COUNTY \n19 SHERIFF’S OFFICE, and CFMG (“Defendants”) have created and maintain a jail \n20 environment in which prisoners in all areas of the Jail face a substantial risk of being \n21 harmed by violence from other prisoners.  Defendants have been aware of these risks since \n22 at least 2007, when the SHERIFF’S OFFICE and the Monterey County Board of \n23 Supervisors contracted with TRG Consulting to produce a needs assessment for the Jail.  \n24 TRG Consulting completed its report, attached hereto as Exhibit A, and entitled “County \n25 of Monterey, Office of the Sheriff, Needs Assessment” (hereinafter, “2007 Needs \n26 Assessment” or “2007 Assessment”), on June 19, 2007.  The Monterey County Board of \n27 Supervisors explicitly accepted the report that same day by unanimous vote.  In the report, \n28 TRG acknowledged that “this needs assessment would not have been possible without the \n[1144098-2]    21 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page24 of 137\n \n1 assistance of a number of professionals from Monterey County,” and specifically \n2 recognized a number of people “who helped make this planning effort a success.”  2007 \n3 Assessment at 1.  Among the people listed are two current members of the Monterey \n4 County Board of Supervisors, as well as former Sheriff-Coroner-Marshall Mike Kanalakis, \n5 former Undersheriff Nancy Cuffney, and former Custody Bureau Chief, Bert Liebersbach.  \n6 Id. \n7 38.  Upon information and belief, in 2011, Sheriff Scott Miller requested that \n8 TRG Consulting update the 2007 Needs Assessment.  As a result, TRG Consulting \n9 produced a new report, attached hereto as Exhibit B, entitled “County of Monterey, Office \n10 of the Sheriff, Jail Needs Assessment” (hereinafter “2011  Needs Assessment” or “2007 \n11 Assessment”), dated December 30, 2011.  Upon information and belief, the 2011 Jail \n12 Needs Assessment was transmitted to Sheriff Miller and other officials in Monterey \n13 County on or around December 30, 2011.  In the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment, TRG \n14 Consulting recognized by name “the primary contributors who helped make this planning \n15 effort a success.”  2011 Assessment at 1.  The list includes all five members of the \n16 Monterey County Board of Supervisors, all of whom remain in their elected positions as of \n17 the filing of this first amended complaint.  Id.  The list also includes Sheriff Miller and \n18 former Custody Bureau Chief Jeffrey J. Budd.  Id. \n19 39.  Both the 2007 Needs Assessment and the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment \n20 concluded that, “[t]he current combination of insufficient beds, an inadequate detention \n21 facility and understaffing has resulted in an almost untenable situation.”  2007 Assessment \n22 at Ex. 1-2; 2011 Assessment at Ex. 2.  Both reports find that the conditions in the Jail and \n23 policies and practices of the SHERIFF’S OFFICE create an unreasonable risk of violence \n24 between prisoners.  Because Defendants are aware of the unreasonable risk of violence and \n25 have not acted to reduce the risk, they are deliberately indifferent to the danger of assault \n26 faced by all prisoners. \n27\n28\n[1144098-2]    22 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page25 of 137\n \n1 A.  Defendants’ Understaffing of the Jail Creates an Environment in Which \nViolence Flourishes \n2  \n3 40.  Defendants staff the Jail in a manner that creates an unreasonable risk of \n4 prisoners being assaulted by other prisoners.  For the past few years the Jail has routinely \n5 housed more than 1,100 prisoners.  Defendants generally staff the Jail with as few as 24 \n6 and no more than 26 officers.  A significant number of officers are required to staff areas \n7 of the Jail other than the housing units, like the booking area, visitor processing areas, and \n8 kitchen.  Thus, usually no more than a handful of officers are responsible for directly \n9 supervising the prisoners in the jail.  In 2011, outside consultants (TRG) notified \n10 Defendants that the current authorized staffing for the Jail was “woefully inadequate.”  \n11 2011 Assessment at Ex. 7. \n12 41.  The minimum staffing plan utilized by the SHERIFF’S OFFICE does not \n13 provide for a sufficient number of officers to safely operate the Jail.  As the 2011 Jail \n14 Needs Assessment explained, “[i]t appears that the staffing provided by the County salary \n15 ordinance is based on the rated capacity of [the Jail], not on how many inmates are actually \n16 in custody.”  2011 Assessment at Ex. 6.  Currently, the population in the Jail is more than \n17 15% above the facility’s rated capacity. \n18 42.  Though the staffing plan being used by Defendants is not sufficient on its \n19 face, Defendants have not even hired staff to fill all of the authorized positions.  As the \n20 2011 Jail Needs Assessment stated, “[v]acancies, extended periods of leave, and normal \n21 staff attrition have resulted in a significant amount of vacant … positions.  The jail has an \n22 increased reliance on overtime to meet minimum staffing.”  2011 Assessment at Ex. 7.  \n23 Upon information and belief, these staffing shortfalls identified at the end of 2011 continue \n24 to exist today. \n25 43.  The 2011 Jail Needs Assessment noted that “[b]aseline staffing should be \n26 above minimum staffing,” but “[d]ue to vacancies and other factors, the Monterey County \n27 Jail constantly is using overtime to staff up to their self-imposed minimum staffing.  This \n28 level is not adequate to provide basic safety and security for staff and inmates.”  2011 \n[1144098-2]    23 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page26 of 137\n \n1 Assessment at Ex. 7 (bolded emphasis added, italics emphasis in original). \n2 44.  Typically, custody officers work 12-hour shifts.  Because of the insufficient \n3 staff employed by Defendants, Defendants often utilize a system of mandatory overtime, \n4 whereby staff are required to work an additional four hours before or after their 12-hour \n5 shifts to cover a vacancy preceding or following their shift.  This dangerous practice may \n6 result in staff being exhausted, unfocused, and unable to properly handle the duties \n7 required of them.  Moreover, even when mandatory overtime is used, the extra four hours \n8 of coverage on either end of the preceding or following 12-hour shift leaves a four-hour \n9 gap uncovered in the middle of the shift.  As the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment explained, \n10 “[u]nderstaffing has resulted in insufficient staff coverage.…  At times the middle of a \n11 shift may be as many as three or four officers short.  This has been exacerbated by recent \n12 staff reductions.  As a result there are not enough officers present in the jail to respond to a \n13 major crisis or natural disaster.…  There are insufficient staff on some shifts to make the \n14 required safety checks.”  2011 Assessment at Ex. 3-4.  The staffing at the Jail is not \n15 adequate to keep prisoners safe. \n16 45.  The staffing shortages are particularly acute in the housing units and for \n17 escort officers.  As described in the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment, “[a] review of the current \n18 staffing pattern as practiced by the Monterey County Jail and the best practices staffing \n19 plan included in the 2006 Staffing Analysis indicates that the critical needs are for the extra \n20 staffing in the housing units and for facility-wide escort deputies.  These positions will \n21 ensure required safety checks are made, there is some level of supervision in the kitchen, \n22 laundry and medical areas and adequate staffing is available to respond to emergencies and \n23 unusual situations.  Recent cuts in staffing have made this situation much worse ….”  2011 \n24 Assessment at Ex. 7.  Upon information and belief, these staffing problems identified at \n25 the end of 2011 continue to exist today. \n26 46.  Assaults experienced by prisoners where staff failed to intervene \n27 demonstrate the risks posed by Defendants’ understaffing of the Jail.  Plaintiff GUYOT \n28 was assaulted by a group of other prisoners 12 days after his arrival at the Jail, while \n[1144098-2]    24 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page27 of 137\n \n1 housed in C-Dorm.  No deputies intervened in the assault and no deputies either saw or \n2 heard the incident while it was occurring.  Plaintiff GUYOT’s severe injuries only came to \n3 the attention of custody staff when he “came up to the front of C-wing with all of his \n4 belon[g]ings” at some time after the assault concluded.  Similarly, Plaintiff GREIM was \n5 attacked by other prisoners in A-Dorm, and received a black eye and other facial injuries \n6 as a result of the attack.  Custody staff were apparently unaware of the attack until Plaintiff \n7 GREIM appeared at the door of A-Dorm and asked to be moved to another housing unit. \n8 47.  Plaintiff AGUILAR was brutally attacked by another inmate when deputies \n9 cleared the approximately 65 inmates from D-Dorm to conduct a search.  All of the \n10 inmates were placed into the small isolation day room during the search where they were \n11 crowded together shoulder-to-shoulder.  There were no guards present in the day room at \n12 the time and the only observation was from the guard tower.  The inmates had been \n13 crowded into the day room for approximately half an hour at which point a large fight \n14 broke out during which Plaintiff AGUILAR was attacked.  Plaintiff AGUILAR suffered a \n15 fractured cheekbone, other facial injuries, slurred speech and loss of vision due the attack.  \n16 He had to undergo surgery to fix the fractured cheekbone and to this day experiences pain, \n17 headaches, and blurred vision as a result of the injury. \n18 48.  When Plaintiff SARABI was attacked by another prisoner, the other prisoner \n19 hit Plaintiff SARABI 10-15 times on his head and legs, knocking him unconscious.  The \n20 two guards who were supposed to be monitoring the dorm did not intervene or otherwise \n21 attempt to stop the attack.  Plaintiff SARABI’s only recollection of guard involvement was \n22 when he awoke from his unconscious state as he was being dragged by a guard to a \n23 holding room, well after the attack had finished. \n24 49.  The severe understaffing creates a high risk of violence any time prisoners \n25 are escorted out of their housing units and in the presence of prisoners from incompatible \n26 classifications.  For example, according to an incident report dated April 1, 2012, and \n27 prepared by employees of the SHERIFF’S OFFICE, visiting is a particular “time of \n28 disorder” with a single deputy expected to maintain order “with as many as 9-18 inmates \n[1144098-2]    25 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page28 of 137\n \n1 filing into three rooms,” even though “differing and often conflicting classifications [are] \n2 present at the same time.”  According to the same incident report, in the visiting area, lock-\n3 down inmates are moved as a group and are unsecured.  The April 1, 2012 incident report \n4 also describes a serious incident in which three or four prisoners classified as \n5 Administrative Segregation-Sophisticated Sureño forced their way into an unlocked room \n6 in which Administrative Segregation-Sensitive Needs prisoners were located.  The \n7 Sophisticated Sureño prisoners were leaving the visiting area as the Sensitive Needs \n8 prisoners were arriving.  One deputy failed to lock the visiting room door to secure the \n9 Sensitive Needs prisoners, because it would have forced him to lose visual contact with \n10 another deputy who was responsible for escorting the seven Administrative Segregation-\n11 Sophisticated Sureño prisoners out of the visiting area.  Three or four of the Sureño \n12 prisoners rushed past the deputies and into the unlocked room.  Then, one prisoner blocked \n13 the visiting room door while the others assaulted a prisoner inside the room and outside of \n14 the deputies’ sight.  The deputies let the assault continue until back-up arrived.  In \n15 addition, according to another incident report prepared by employees of the SHERIFF’S \n16 OFFICE, in February 2012, two Norteño gang members assaulted a prisoner while being \n17 escorted through the Rehabilitation Infirmary. \n18 50.  Defendants have frequently acknowledged the understaffing of the Jail.  For \n19 example, in a June 2, 2013 article in The Salinas California, Sheriff Miller was quoted as \n20 saying that with a population of about 1,100 prisoners, “[w]e are getting to the level we’re \n21 becoming uncomfortable with the ratio of inmates.” \n22 B.  The Jail Is Severely Overcrowded, Which Increases the Risk of \nPrisoner-on-Prisoner Violence, but Defendants Have Not Utilized \n23 Available Solutions to Ameliorate the Problem \n24 51.  The Jail is severely overcrowded.  The Jail has a rated capacity for 825 \n25 prisoners, but has in the recent past housed as many as 1,200 prisoners, nearly 150 percent \n26 of capacity.  From January 1 to March 11, 2014, the Jail’s population was above 900 all \n27 but one day and was as high as 975 prisoners.  Some areas of the Jail are considerably \n28 more overcrowded than the Jail as a whole, especially the women’s section. \n[1144098-2]    26 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page29 of 137\n \n1 52.  The Jail has been so overcrowded that, for many years now, Defendant \n2 SHERIFF’S OFFICE applies on a monthly basis to the Superior Court for the County of \n3 Monterey for an order to release prisoners on an accelerated basis pursuant to California \n4 Penal Code § 4024.1.  To support the application, the former Chief Deputy Sheriff for the \n5 County and, upon information and belief, the current Chief Deputy Sheriff, swore on \n6 multiple occasions that unless the SHERIFF’S OFFICE is able to release some prisoners, \n7 the overcrowding in the Jail would “compromise[] the inmate classification plan as well as \n8 the safety and security of the detention facilities.”  Defendants’ failure to implement an \n9 effective classification system, which is exacerbated by overcrowding, places prisoners at \n10 a serious risk of harm, as described more fully in Section I.D, below.  In addition, in \n11 support of the application, Dr. Taylor Fithian (Director of Defendant CFMG) “advised that \n12 the excessive number of inmates housed in the Jail compromises the health of the inmates \n13 and the staff working at the facility.” \n14 53.  The severe overcrowding was also identified as a problem in the 2011 Jail \n15 Needs Assessment.  Specifically, the Assessment found that \n16 [t]here are not enough beds to meet the current adult detention needs, let \nalone the needs in the near future.…  The jail is so overcrowded that no \n17 allowance can be made for peaking and classification or the routine or \nemergency maintenance required in inmate housing areas.  Severe \n18 overcrowding has resulted in inmates being held in the intake area for up to \nforty-eight hours.  This is not permitted by the California Code of \n19 Regulations.  Severe overcrowding has forced the Sheriff to use areas for \nhousing that were not designed or intended for that use (e.g., the rotunda \n20 area).  This makes these areas much more difficult for officers to manage and \ncontrol.  Overcrowding has forced the Sheriff to operate the jail as an \n21 indirect supervision facility, while the jail was designed for direct \nsupervision.  This creates significant command, control and management \n22 problems. \n23 2011 Assessment at Ex. 2. \n24 54.  The 2011 Jail Needs Assessment further noted that “[o]vercrowding creates a \n25 number of issues that affect staff and inmates, and put the County at risk.  Overcrowding \n26 causes stress on both inmates and staff.  Inmate vs. inmate assaults typically occur more \n27 frequently, as do other disciplinary infractions.”  2011 Assessment at Ex. 9 (emphasis \n28 added). \n[1144098-2]    27 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page30 of 137\n \n1 55.  Defendants have also admitted to the dangerously overcrowded conditions in \n2 public statements regarding potential new jail construction.  In an October 5, 2012 press \n3 release, Sheriff Miller stated that “[o]vercrowding has been a serious problem at the jail for \n4 many years, creating a dangerous situation for inmates, jail staff and the community.”  \n5 Sheriff Miller recently commented on the “overcrowded nature of the current facility.”  \n6 See Sunita Vijayan, Jail Funds Welcome, More Money Sought, The Salinas Californian, \n7 Dec. 10, 2012.  More recently, on May 28, 2013, he was quoted in the Monterey Herald as \n8 saying that “we realized the jail was overcrowded, that overcrowding can create \n9 problems.”  In addition, a document on the SHERIFF’S OFFICE’s website entitled “Jail \n10 Housing Addition Fact Sheet” states that “[t]he Monterey County Jail has been \n11 significantly overcrowded for many years.  The jail has a design bed capacity of 825 but \n12 currently houses a total of 1150 detainees.  Such overcrowding puts officers, staff, inmates \n13 and the public at risk.”  The Fact Sheet also states that the Jail has “[i]nsufficient beds for \n14 existing inmate population.” \n15 56.  Despite the profound and persistent overcrowding, Defendants have not \n16 availed themselves of numerous available opportunities to safely relieve the population \n17 pressures in the Jail.  For example, Defendants have failed to undertake adequate measures \n18 to address their high pretrial population, including by failing to ensure that the maximum \n19 number of people possible are evaluated with the County’s risk assessment tool.  Such \n20 evaluation could result in lower risk persons being released from potentially unnecessary \n21 detention prior to their case disposition.  Defendants have also failed to ensure that county \n22 departments are adequately staffed and that there is appropriate inter-agency coordination \n23 to ensure the pretrial services program is assessing and serving the greatest number of \n24 people possible.  Increased capacity and coordination could also result in an increase of \n25 appropriate pretrial persons being safely managed in the community rather than housed in \n26 Jail prior to case disposition.  Defendants have also failed to undertake adequate measures \n27 to expand capacity for their existing work release program for sentenced individuals, and \n28 have failed to investigate opportunities for collaboration between agencies and to expand \n[1144098-2]    28 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page31 of 137\n \n1 their capacity to supervise individuals on mandatory supervision as part of a split sentence.  \n2 Defendants have also failed to adequately implement alternatives to incarceration found \n3 safe and effective in other jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, diversion and use of \n4 home and GPS monitoring. \n5 57.  According to the Monterey County Community Corrections Partnership \n6 AB109 Statistical Report for Fiscal Year 2013/2014, Second Quarter: October 2013-\n7 December 2013, since the inception of the County’s pretrial release program in October \n8 2012, there have been more than 17,000 prisoners booked into the Jail.  The County has \n9 only interviewed and assessed 491 prisoners for eligibility for pretrial release and has \n10 actually released only 209 individuals.  At the same time, the population of pretrial \n11 defendants in the Jail rose to approximately 77 percent during the last quarter of 2013, up \n12 from 71 percent during the last quarter of 2012. \n13 58.  The County has also failed to utilize split sentences to reduce the Jail \n14 population.  During the last quarter of 2013, an average of only nine individuals per month \n15 were given split sentences.  As of December 2013, there had been a total of 85 individuals \n16 who had received a split sentence out of the total of 665 individuals sentenced under \n17 California Penal Code § 1170(h) in the County since October 2011.  As of the end of \n18 September 2013 the rate of split sentencing in Monterey County—at that time 11 \n19 percent—was the tenth lowest rate of split sentencing in the state and far below the \n20 statewide average of 28 percent, according to data collected by the Chief Probation \n21 Officers of California. \n22 C.  The Jail’s Physical Structure Is Inadequate, Which Makes It More \nDifficult for Staff to Safely Monitor Prisoners and Increases the Risk of \n23 Prisoner Violence \n24 59.  The Jail, which consists of two primary buildings—the Rehabilitation Center \n25 and the Main Jail Building—constructed over the past 42 years, is a patchwork of \n26 makeshift spaces, thrown together to keep up with Monterey’s fast-growing Jail \n27 population.  Throughout the housing units and other spaces, there are numerous blind spots \n28 where staff cannot safely monitor prisoners.  As found in the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment, \n[1144098-2]    29 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page32 of 137\n \n1 “[t]he design of the jail and the manner in which additions have been constructed results in \n2 a physical plant that is difficult to manage and control and unnecessarily expensive to \n3 operate.…  There is poor observation from most deputy stations.  Officers cannot observe \n4 inmates areas in Pods A through J.  The wing walls in the dormitories are approximately \n5 four feet high and provide a number of areas where inmates cannot be observed.  The \n6 manner in which additions have been constructed has resulted in a facility that lacks any \n7 real central control or command post that would be used in the event of a major \n8 disturbance or disaster.”  2011 Assessment at Ex. 2. \n9 60.  The 2011 Jail Needs Assessment further noted that “visual supervision is \n10 problematic in the existing jail,” and “[a]t best there is intermittent observation of the \n11 inmates.  In the Rehabilitation Facility, a Deputy Sheriff must walk into the inmate \n12 housing area to see the entire living and shower area.  It appears there is an attempt to \n13 remedy the problem with the use of cameras.  Unfortunately, this is not working.”  2011 \n14 Assessment at Ex. 8.  Upon information and belief, despite being made aware of these \n15 problems in 2011, Defendants have not remedied the problems.  These physical \n16 limitations, especially when combined with the severe understaffing and overcrowding in \n17 the Jail, create an unreasonable threat of harm to the safety and security of staff, visitors, \n18 volunteers, and prisoners. \n19 61.  Upon information and belief, on or around April 29, 2013, the Jail was under \n20 lockdown due to several attacks in the K-Pod.  These beatings took place behind a pillar in \n21 the K-Pod that blocks the view of Jail staff (both from camera and window perspectives).  \n22 Upon information and belief, one prisoner was injured so badly in these beatings that he \n23 was airlifted out of the Jail and taken to a hospital in San Jose where he received treatment \n24 for a fractured skull. \n25 62.  According to incident reports prepared by employees of the SHERIFF’S \n26 OFFICE, cell doors in many pods throughout the Jail can be easily popped open by \n27 prisoners, allowing prisoners to leave their cells without authorization at any time.  This \n28 includes cell doors in lockdown units that house active gang members.  Numerous incident \n[1144098-2]    30 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page33 of 137\n \n1 reports recount assaults on prisoners who are on their authorized out-of-cell time or are in \n2 a unit for kitchen work, times when all other prisoners should be locked in their cells.  In \n3 one example, a prisoner on his out-of-cell hour in a lockdown unit told a nearby deputy \n4 who was passing out medication with a nurse that particular prisoners in his unit were \n5 planning to “pop” their doors to fight him.  Before the deputy could get back-up or enter \n6 the unit himself, two cell doors were “popped,” and two prisoners chased the first prisoner \n7 into a cell on the top tier to assault him, just as he had predicted. \n8 63.  As another example from an incident report dated April 1, 2013, and \n9 prepared by an employee of the SHERIFF’S OFFICE, a prisoner housed in G-Pod was \n10 assaulted by another prisoner in the pod.  G-Pod is a celled housing unit, meaning all \n11 prisoners are housed in cells with doors.  Prior to the assault, the prisoner had informed the \n12 classification unit that the assailant had been threatening him, had demonstrated to the \n13 prisoner that the assailant could open his cell door at will, and had shown the prisoner a \n14 large jail-made shank that he possessed.  The prisoner requested that the assailant be \n15 moved to a different pod, but Jail staff took no action to move the assailant to another \n16 housing unit.  The following day the prisoner was alone in the common area of G-Pod for \n17 his hour of daily recreation; all of the other prisoners in G-Pod were in their cells with their \n18 doors closed and purportedly locked.  The prisoner then saw the assailant use the shank to \n19 attempt to open his cell door.  To protect himself, the prisoner ran to the assailant’s door \n20 and used his body to keep the door from opening; he was forced to remain in that position \n21 for the remainder of his hour outside of his cell.  The assailant was, however, able to cut \n22 the prisoner multiple times in his upper stomach area by wielding the shank through the \n23 food tray slot, which was also not secured and which the assailant was able to open. \n24 64.  On December 15, 2013, Plaintiff MEFFORD and other prisoners housed in \n25 G-Pod, an administrative segregation lockdown unit, were able to “pop” their tray slots—\n26 that is, open them from the inside.  The tray slots are metal are cut-outs in the cell door that \n27 can be shut with a metal flap and locked closed from the outside.  That prisoners are able \n28 to open their own tray slots runs contrary to the entire design of the lockdown unit, which \n[1144098-2]    31 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page34 of 137\n \n1 is supposed to prevent prisoners from any access to the outside from inside their cells. \n2 65.  Poor jail design also exacerbates the dangers of understaffing.  According to \n3 another incident report prepared by an employee of the SHERIFF’S OFFICE, in \n4 September 2011, one deputy opened a secure door to a Norteño unit to escort a single \n5 prisoner to different part of the jail while six prisoner workers and three other employees \n6 were in the area.  Three prisoners classified as Norteños pushed past the deputy when he \n7 opened the door and all four prisoners proceeded to assault a single prisoner worker.  \n8 Another deputy from the control tower heard the fighting but could not see what was \n9 happening.  He opened a secure door to allow back-up to arrive, but in doing so, he \n10 revealed another deputy who was escorting three prisoners classified as Norteños to the \n11 infirmary.  All three attempted to join the fight when the door opened, because of their \n12 gang allegiances.  Two were able to enter the area where the fight was continuing and the \n13 deputies had to repeatedly deploy their Tasers to get control of the situation until back-up \n14 could arrive. \n15 66.  Defendants have repeatedly acknowledged the dangers posed by the Jail’s \n16 structure.  In an October 24, 2013 article in the Monterey County Weekly entitled \n17 “Monterey County Closer to Jail Expansion, Amid Criticism,” Sheriff Miller stated that \n18 “right now we lack adequate housing by any standards.”  (Emphasis added.)  In an \n19 April 4, 2013 article in the Monterey Herald, Sheriff Miller called the Jail “antiquated” and \n20 referred to the Jail as the “Winchester Mystery House of jails.”  The “Jail Housing \n21 Addition Fact Sheet” posted on the SHERIFF’S OFFICE’s website states that the “[t]he \n22 labyrinth-like manner of jail additions has created security and evacuation issues.”  A 2006 \n23 article on the Monterey County Jail in the Monterey County Weekly was titled “Hell Hole: \n24 The Monterey County Jail is an overcrowded pit of violence and despair.  There is no plan \n25 to fix it.”  The article discussed how “[t]he jail was designed with little practical \n26 knowledge and almost no foresight.  It’s made up of 27 separate housing units, each tacked \n27 to the next in partially-funded bursts of administrative desperation....”  The then-Chief \n28 Deputy of the Jail, Burt Liebersbach, was quoted extensively throughout the article and \n[1144098-2]    32 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page35 of 137\n \n1 provided the author access to the Jail.  After describing the deficiencies in the Jail’s design \n2 and an increase in prisoner-on-prisoner violence, Chief Deputy Liebersbach was quoted as \n3 saying that “[i]f things continue this way, the possibility for a riot exists.” \n4 D.  Defendants Routinely Fail to Adequately Classify and Assign Prisoners \nto Housing Locations Where Prisoners Will Be Safe from Violence and \n5 Injury \n6 67.  Defendants fail to adequately classify and assign prisoners to housing \n7 locations in the Jail where they will be safe from injury and violence.  Before prisoners are \n8 assigned to certain housing locations in the Jail, they are “classified” based on a number of \n9 factors including their criminal charges, gang affiliation, race, and history of violence.  \n10 These classification procedures are inappropriate and ineffective, however, and prisoners \n11 who are incompatible for various reasons, including rival gang memberships and/or \n12 histories of assaultive behaviors, are housed together in the Jail.  Moreover, the severe \n13 overcrowding at the Jail makes proper and accurate classifications next to impossible.  As \n14 the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment found, “[a]dequate separation and segregation resulting \n15 from classification of inmates cannot occur because of the severe overcrowding and lack \n16 of a sufficient number of single and double cells.  Thus, while the staff has the ability to \n17 classify, they do not have the ability to physically segregate those inmates who should be \n18 separated because of their classification.  This creates an environment that is unsafe for \n19 officers, inmates and visitors.”  2011 Assessment at Ex. 2. \n20 68.  The 2011 Jail Needs Assessment further noted that, “[i]t is obvious that the \n21 system is dangerously out of balance in terms of the types of beds available and the \n22 classification of inmates held.…  In Monterey County there is the possibility of \n23 misclassifying inmates based on space rather than security level.  Overcrowding reduces \n24 the ability to classify.  This is further compounded by the dormitory design.  Normally, \n25 10%-15% of the beds should be empty and available for classification spikes and \n26 maintenance.…  Proper separation and segregation of inmates as envisioned in the \n27 Sheriff’s classification plan is very difficult because of insufficient staff, an inadequate \n28 physical plant layout and … severe overcrowding ….”  2011 Assessment at Ex. 4-5. \n[1144098-2]    33 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page36 of 137\n \n1 69.  For example, Plaintiff SARABI was attacked by a fellow prisoner on or \n2 around March 6, 2013, in the B-Dorm of the Jail.  After the attack, Plaintiff SARABI was \n3 moved to C-Dorm, so he would not be in the same housing areas as the prisoner who \n4 attacked him.  However, on or around April 11, 2013, the Jail moved his attacker into \n5 Plaintiff SARABI’s C-Dorm, so the person who attacked  him just five weeks prior would \n6 be sleeping just five beds away from him.  The Jail did not remove Plaintiff SARABI’s \n7 attacker until the attacker himself was assaulted by other prisoners in the dorm a few hours \n8 later. \n9 70.  Upon information and belief, on August 22, 2013, a gang-related stabbing \n10 occurred in one of the housing units at the Jail.  Upon information and belief, a prisoner \n11 was airlifted to San Jose for treatment as a result of the stabbing. \n12 71.  In an October 10, 2013 article in the Salinas Californian, Sheriff Miller was \n13 quoted as saying that an entire portion of the Jail, the Rehabilitation Facility, was not \n14 useful for housing prisoners because it was designed for prisoners with lower risk than the \n15 prisoners actually detained in the Jail: “[T]he Rehabilitation Facility” he said, “has about \n16 outlived its usefulness....  Everyone low risk who comes in is generally released early so \n17 the people we have locked up are more hardcore.  It makes them more difficult to deal \n18 with.”  The “Jail Housing Addition Fact Sheet” posted on the SHERIFF’S OFFICE’s \n19 website states that in the Jail, Defendants have “[i]neffective separation of potentially \n20 dangerous inmates, such as rival gang members.” \n21 E.  Defendants Fail to Adequately Train Staff How to Prevent and Respond \nto Violence Between Prisoners in the Jail \n22  \n23 72.  Upon information and belief, Defendants do not adequately train custody \n24 staff in how to prevent and appropriately respond to prisoner violence.  The lack of \n25 training is evident from the incidents and security lapses described above, which endanger \n26 prisoner safety.  As a result of a lack of adequate training, staff do not timely respond to \n27 violent incidents at the jail, do not recognize apparent dangers that can result in prisoner-\n28 on-prisoner assaults, do not timely carry out their responsibilities to adequately monitor \n[1144098-2]    34 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page37 of 137\n \n1 prisoner activity in the housing units and elsewhere where prisoner assaults occur, do not \n2 adequately classify and assign prisoners to housing locations in the Jail where prisoners \n3 will be safe from injury and violence, allow security lapses that endanger prisoners, and \n4 fail to appropriately intervene when prisoner assaults and security breaches occur.  Such \n5 training is of even greater import given the chronic understaffing and overcrowding at, and \n6 structural inadequacy of, the Jail. \n7 F.  Defendants Are Deliberately Indifferent to the Constitutionally \nUnacceptable Risk of Violence Faced by Prisoners \n8  \n9 73.  Violent incidents between prisoners occur regularly.  According the \n10 SHERIFF’S OFFICE’s own incident reports from 2011 and from January to early-\n11 September 2012, there were more than 150 separate incidents of violence between \n12 prisoners.  Some of the incident reports were incomplete and lack important pieces of \n13 information.  Upon information and belief, there are many more incidents of violence that \n14 were not captured in incident reports. \n15 74.   Most instances of prisoner-on-prisoner violence involve injury to at least \n16 one participant that requires medical attention at the Jail or even at the local hospital.  In \n17 more than 100 of the reported incidents from 2011 and from January through early-\n18 September 2012, at least one prisoner involved in the altercation required some medical \n19 treatment.  In 13 of the incidents, the injuries suffered by at least one of the participants \n20 were so severe that they had to be taken to an outside medical facility for treatment.  \n21 Plaintiff HOBBS, who had existing serious back problems prior to his incarceration, \n22 required medical attention for his back after he was attacked by another prisoner.  To this \n23 day, Plaintiff HOBBS experiences serious back pain and problems with mobility as a result \n24 of the attack. \n25 75.  Violent incidents between prisoners occur in nearly every area of the Jail.  \n26 Violent incidents were reported in 26 of the 29 housing units in the Jail from 2011 and \n27 from January through early-September 2012.  There were multiple reports of violent \n28 incidents in 21 of the 29 housing units.  In the A-Dorm of the Main Jail alone, there were \n[1144098-2]    35 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page38 of 137\n \n1 19 incidents, while in the C-Wing of the Rehabilitation Center, there were 15 incidents.  \n2 Violent incidents also occurred in the booking area, the kitchen where prisoners work, the \n3 infirmary, and the visiting area. \n4 76.  Violent incidents occur at approximately equivalent per prisoner rates in the \n5 portions of the Jail that house men and women.  21 of the more than 150 incidents \n6 involved female prisoners, while another 137 incidents involved male prisoners. \n7 77.  Prisoners with disabilities are at increased risk of being the victims of \n8 violence because of their perceived or actual inability to defend themselves.  For example, \n9 in many of the incidents described in incident reports, prisoners with mental health \n10 problems were attacked by or attacked other prisoners because of behavior attributable to \n11 their mental illness. \n12 78.  In more than 35 of the incidents with full reports, custody staff at the Jail \n13 were not able to identify the assailant.  Though the SHERIFF’S OFFICE has installed \n14 cameras in the Jail, upon information and belief, only two cameras monitoring two units \n15 that house few prisoners have recording capabilities.  The understaffing of the Jail means \n16 that officers are rarely in a position to identify the attackers visually.  Moreover, because \n17 the conditions in the Jail are so unsafe, the victims of attacks frequently refuse to volunteer \n18 the name of their assailants for fear of retaliatory attacks.  As a result of Defendants’ \n19 deliberate indifference to prisoner safety, they have failed to sufficiently staff the Jail and \n20 to put in place other policies and practices that would (1) result in the staff identification of \n21 assailants in a far greater number of attacks, and (2) create an environment in which \n22 victims feel sufficiently safe such that they identify their attackers. \n23 79.  Weapons are readily available inside the Jail, greatly increasing the danger to \n24 prisoners and staff.  In addition to the incident discussed above involving a shank, prisoner \n25 assaults have also involved the use of a “Tomahawk” made from a razor and a 13 to 19-\n26 inch long copper pipe. \n27 80.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody \n28 staff in how to timely and appropriately intervene to stop violent incidents, and how to \n[1144098-2]    36 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page39 of 137\n \n1 identify and confiscate weapons before they are used in an altercation. \n2 81.  Upon information and belief, Defendants lack any policy or practice for \n3 regularly reviewing incident reports in order to identify systemic problems regarding the \n4 manner in which Defendants keep prisoners safe from violence from other prisoners. \n5 82.  Defendants have known of these conditions and the violence they create for \n6 years, including through their own incident reports and the 2007 and 2011 Jail Needs \n7 Assessments. \n8 II.  DEFENDANTS FAIL TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE MEDICAL CARE TO \nPRISONERS \n9  \n10 83.  Defendants MONTEREY COUNTY, MONTEREY COUNTY SHERIFF’S \n11 OFFICE, and CFMG have a policy and practice of failing to provide adequate medical \n12 care to prisoners in the Jail, and are deliberately indifferent to the fact that their failure to \n13 do so subjects prisoners to a substantial risk of unnecessary suffering, serious injury, \n14 clinical deterioration, or death. \n15 84.  CFMG is a for-profit corporation.  CFMG provides medical, mental health, \n16 and dental services to prisoners in the Jail pursuant to its contract with Defendants \n17 MONTEREY COUNTY and the SHERIFF’S OFFICE.  The term of the agreement is from \n18 April 1, 2012, through June 30, 2015.  The COUNTY and the SHERIFF’S OFFICE \n19 compensate CFMG for providing health care to prisoners with a flat fee payment made \n20 annually for the term of the contract.  In the first year of the contract, CFMG was paid \n21 $4,826,195.  In the second and third years of the contract, the amount paid to CFMG is \n22 supposed to be increased according to the Medical Consumer Price Index for San \n23 Francisco/Oakland.  In addition, CFMG receives an additional $4.02 each day for each \n24 prisoner housed in the Jail in excess of a population of 1,065.  The COUNTY has the right \n25 to terminate the agreement if CFMG violates any of the material terms of the agreement.  \n26 The material terms of the agreement include that CFMG “shall perform all work in a safe \n27 and skillful manner and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” \n28 85.  Defendants fully control all medical, mental health, and dental care available \n[1144098-2]    37 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page40 of 137\n \n1 to prisoners in the Jail.  Defendants prohibit prisoners from obtaining any medications, \n2 including over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and Tylenol and prescription \n3 medication for which prisoners possess valid prescriptions, without approval from \n4 Defendants.  Prisoners at the Jail cannot be seen by any medical professionals, inside or \n5 outside of the Jail, without approval from Defendants.  Prisoners cannot receive laboratory \n6 or other diagnostic testing without approval from Defendants.  Put simply, Defendants \n7 control every aspect of provision of medical care to prisoners in the Jail. \n8 A.  Defendants Routinely and Systematically Fail to Maintain Sufficient \nNumbers of Health Care Professionals \n9  \n10 86.  Defendants maintain insufficient numbers of health care professionals to \n11 provide minimally adequate care to the more than 900 prisoners in the Jail.  There are not \n12 sufficient health care staff to timely respond to prisoners’ requests for medical evaluations \n13 and treatment, to adequately screen, monitor, and provide follow-up care to prisoners who \n14 are suffering from serious and chronic illnesses, or to treat prisoners on an emergency \n15 basis. \n16 87.  For example, when Plaintiff SARABI was attacked by another prisoner the \n17 night of March 6, 2013, he was seen by a nurse who placed an ACE bandage on his right \n18 foot and ankle and gave him a wheelchair.  Plaintiff SARABI complained for the next \n19 several hours about the serious pain in his foot and a possible concussion, but his repeated \n20 requests for help and medical care were ignored.  When a nurse finally brought him back \n21 to the infirmary at approximately 3:00 a.m., she informed Plaintiff SARABI that there was \n22 no qualified medical staff present at that hour to evaluate and help him, so he would have \n23 to wait until 6:00 a.m. to receive his needed pain medications.  Plaintiff SARABI was not \n24 transported to a local hospital for treatment. \n25 88.  The insufficient number of custody staff, discussed in Section I.A, supra, \n26 makes it even more difficult for Defendants to provide minimally adequate health care.  \n27 Within the Jail, any time that a prisoner must be transferred to or from a housing unit to \n28 another area of the Jail for health care services, at least one custody officer must \n[1144098-2]    38 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page41 of 137\n \n1 accompany and transport the prisoner.  Similarly, anytime that a prisoner requires transport \n2 to an outside medical facility for treatment, at least one custody officer must accompany \n3 the prisoner and remain present for the duration of time that the prisoner is at the outside \n4 medical facility.  To timely transport all prisoners to and from all health care services \n5 would require Defendants to hire and staff the jail with additional custody officers.  \n6 Defendants have been aware of the insufficiency of the number of custody staff for some \n7 time, including as a result of the 2007 and 2011 Jail Needs Assessments.  Defendants, \n8 however, refuse to adequately staff the Jail. \n9 89.  Prisoners are routinely unable to see medical or dental staff because of a lack \n10 of available custody staff for escorting prisoners to and from medical appointments.  For \n11 example, a doctor requested to see Plaintiff HOBBS on or around December 19, 2013, but \n12 the appointment could not take place because custody staff were unavailable to escort \n13 Plaintiff HOBBS from his housing unit to the appointment.  Many other plaintiffs \n14 experienced similar problems where appointments with medical staff or ordered treatment \n15 (such as the taking of vital sign or the changing of dressings) did not take place as ordered \n16 because of a lack of custody staff to escort the plaintiffs to the infirmary. \n17 B.  Defendants Routinely and Systematically Fail to Supervise the Conduct \nof Health Care and Custody Staff \n18  \n19 90.  Upon information and belief, the small number of health care staff that \n20 Defendants do employ are not sufficiently trained or supervised to provide the care they \n21 provide.  At the Jail, much of the health care is provided by the one Physician’s Assistant \n22 (“PA”) employed by CFMG.  The PA, who has prescribing authority but must be \n23 supervised by a physician, is not adequately supervised by the physicians at the Jail.  As a \n24 result, the PA has, at least in part because of lack of supervision, provided inappropriate \n25 and untimely care to prisoners and caused many lapses in care. \n26 91.  In addition, Licensed Vocational Nurses (“LVNs”) and Licensed Psychiatric \n27 Technicians (“LPTs”) are entry-level health care providers who must only practice under \n28 the direct supervision of physicians, psychologists, registered nurses, social workers, or \n[1144098-2]    39 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page42 of 137\n \n1 other qualified professionals, and are not qualified to do their own patient evaluations or \n2 assessments.  Yet, upon information and belief, Defendants improperly allow untrained \n3 entry-level providers such as LVNs and LPTs to practice outside of the scope of their \n4 licensure and perform medical gatekeeping functions, including independently assessing \n5 and responding to prisoners’ medical and dental care requests and correctional officers’ \n6 referrals for health care. \n7 92.  For example, Plaintiff SARABI suffered a serious leg injury when he was \n8 attacked by another prisoner on March 6, 2013.  Plaintiff SARABI was initially seen and \n9 treated by nurses only for the first two weeks following the injury.  The nurses wrapped his \n10 injured foot and ankle in an ACE bandage immediately after the attack, then approximately \n11 a week later placed a splint on his right foot and ankle.  The splint was placed too low, \n12 resulting in discomfort and continued pain for Plaintiff SARABI.  When Plaintiff SARABI \n13 finally saw a doctor for the first time (nearly two weeks after his date of injury), the doctor \n14 informed him that he likely had a peroneal nerve injury that required specific nerve \n15 medication and would take at least a month if not longer to heal.  When Plaintiff SARABI \n16 asked why it took medical staff so long to diagnose the nerve injury, the doctor replied that \n17 it was a “staff problem” because the staff erroneously diagnosed Plaintiff SARABI’s nerve \n18 damage as a sprain. \n19 93.  Plaintiff MILLER received an improper insulin injection from a CFMG \n20 nurse-employee on February 11, 2013.  As a result, he suffered a severe diabetic episode \n21 and was transported to Natividad Medical Center by ambulance in an unconscious state.  \n22 The pain, distress, and permanent physical impairment that Plaintiff MILLER has suffered, \n23 and continues to suffer, as a result of this episode are directly attributable to Defendants’ \n24 failure to adequately train and properly supervise health care staff. \n25 94.  Physicians at the Jail ordered that lower-level medical staff change dressings \n26 on wounds for Plaintiffs HERNANDEZ and COBB at regular intervals.  Lower-level staff, \n27 on numerous occasions, failed to change the dressings as ordered.  During periods of time \n28 when lower-level medical staff failed to change Plaintiff HERNANDEZ’s dressing as \n[1144098-2]    40 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page43 of 137\n \n1 ordered, he experienced unnecessary pain and developed numerous abscesses in his \n2 abdomen that required multiple hospitalizations, including a seven-week hospitalization in \n3 January and February 2013. \n4 95.  Defendants also fail to maintain medical accreditations.  Specifically, the \n5 Institute for Medical Quality (“IMQ”) offers voluntary accreditation to correctional and \n6 detention facilities throughout California based upon meeting standards developed by the \n7 IMQ.  According to a certificate prominently placed on the wall of the lobby for the \n8 visiting area of the Jail, Monterey County Jail’s IMQ accreditation expired on \n9 November 17, 2011.  On information and belief, Defendant CFMG contacted IMQ in or \n10 around May 2013 to request a reaccreditation survey.  To date, Defendants have not \n11 received an updated accreditation from IMQ. \n12 C.  Defendants Lack Sufficient Facilities to Provide Adequate Medical Care \n13 96.  The physical spaces in the Jail used to deliver medical care are not sufficient \n14 for the population of prisoners.  As the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment found, \n15 “Medical/mental health treatment spaces are not adequate for the rated beds, let alone the \n16 actual number of inmates held.”  2011 Assessment at Ex. 3.  The Assessment further noted \n17 the direct impact of overcrowding on prisoners’ overall health:  “Overcrowding affects \n18 inmates’ mental and physical health by increasing the level of uncertainty with which they \n19 regularly cope.”  2011 Assessment at Ex. 9.  The lack of sufficient treatment space places \n20 prisoners at an unreasonable risk of harm from inadequate medical care, compromises the \n21 delivery of medical care, and fails to ensure confidentiality and safety during the delivery \n22 of such care. \n23 97.  Upon information and belief, medical screening procedures and \n24 appointments are routinely conducted in non-confidential treatment space and hallways.  \n25 For example, Plaintiff COBB was seen by a member of CFMG’s medical staff in a non-\n26 confidential hallway setting for a treatment discussion that included, among other things, a \n27 discussion of the staff member’s view that Plaintiff COBB’s poor personal hygiene was a \n28 contributing factor to her recurrent alleged urinary tract infections.  Plaintiff COBB in fact \n[1144098-2]    41 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page44 of 137\n \n1 had severe kidney stones that the Jail medical staff had failed to diagnose. \n2 D.  Defendants’ Inadequate Screening and Intake Process Fails to Identify \nand Treat Medical Care Problems of Newly Arriving Prisoners \n3  \n4 98.  Defendants fail to adequately identify and treat the medical problems of \n5 newly arriving prisoners during the screening and intake process.  Defendants’ policies and \n6 practices for medical screening are inadequate.  Defendants fail to adequately train custody \n7 and medical staff in how to timely and appropriately identify medical problems during the \n8 screening and intake process.  When a prisoner is newly booked into the Jail, medical staff \n9 may not even play a role in screening the prisoner.  Custody staff (who are not sufficiently \n10 trained to identify medical needs) complete a brief one-page health screening form during \n11 a cursory interview with the prisoner in a non-confidential space.  Medical staff only \n12 evaluate prisoners at intake if the custody staff note a problem on the screening form.  The \n13 screening form used by custody fails to capture critical and basic information necessary to \n14 identify prisoners in need of medical attention.  Upon information and belief, Defendants \n15 fail to take every prisoner’s vital signs (including blood pressure and temperature), and \n16 only take them for prisoners whom custody staff refer to medical staff for assessment.  \n17 Upon information and belief, comprehensive intake evaluations by medical staff, when \n18 they occur at all, frequently do not take place until days or weeks after a prisoner is booked \n19 into the jail. \n20 99.  Because the screening process is inadequate to identify prisoners with \n21 serious or chronic health care problems, prisoners are at a significant risk of serious harm.  \n22 For example, prior to being booked into the Jail, Plaintiff MURPHY had permanent nerve \n23 damage that was caused by a bulge in his L4 and L5 vertebrae.  When he went through the \n24 screening process, Plaintiff MURPHY was experiencing significant pain from the nerve \n25 damage because he had not taken his pain medication and did not have a cane to assist him \n26 in walking.  The screening form for Plaintiff MURPHY does not indicate that he had any \n27 potential or existing nerve damage or back problems.  Similarly, although Plaintiff COBB \n28 reported during her intake screening that she had recently been seen by an outside medical \n[1144098-2]    42 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page45 of 137\n \n1 provider and referred to a urologist for cloudy and discolored urine, her intake screening \n2 form does not indicate any urology concerns. \n3 100.  During the intake process Defendants also under-identify prisoners with \n4 chronic illness, including hypertension, asthma, and diabetes. \n5 E.  Defendants Fail to Provide Prisoners with a Reliable and Timely Way to \nAlert Health Care Staff of Their Medical Needs \n6  \n7 101.  Defendants fail to provide a reliable way for prisoners to alert health care \n8 staff of their need for evaluation of medical or dental problems, and are deliberately \n9 indifferent to the harm and risk of harm to prisoners that their failure creates.  Defendants’ \n10 policies and practices for providing prisoners with a means for alerting health care staff of \n11 medical or dental needs are inadequate.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to \n12 adequately train custody and medical staff in how to properly process and timely respond \n13 to prisoners’ requests for medical or dental evaluation. \n14 102.  To request medical care, prisoners are supposed to submit a “sick call slip” \n15 to medical staff when medical staff comes through a housing unit to distribute medications.  \n16 Prisoners may also submit sick call slips in boxes in some housing units that are designed \n17 for submission of grievances.  These boxes are not sufficiently confidential, as custody \n18 staff are the only staff who have keys to the boxes, and thus have access to prisoners’ \n19 confidential sick call slips.  Once a sick call slip is received by medical staff, the prisoner \n20 is supposed to be seen by medical staff on the next available sick call day. \n21 103.  Though prisoners report little difficulty submitting sick call slips to medical \n22 staff, they frequently receive no response to their requests for medical care.  Other times, \n23 when prisoners do receive a response to a sick call slip, it is not until many days after the \n24 sick call slip was submitted. \n25 104.  The failure to timely respond to sick call slips is caused, at least in part, by \n26 Defendants’ failure to create an effective tracking and scheduling system for health care \n27 appointments. \n28 105.  Upon information and belief, Defendants do not adequately train health care \n[1144098-2]    43 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page46 of 137\n \n1 staff in how to review, process, and respond to sick call slips submitted by prisoners. \n2 106.  Though Defendants have a policy that all prisoners are supposed to be seen \n3 by medical staff on the next available sick call day after submitting a sick call slip, in \n4 practice, Defendants use Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs) to screen the sick call slips \n5 and determine whether the prisoner should actually be seen by medical or mental health \n6 care staff.  No standardized protocols exist to guide LVNs’ exercise of discretion in \n7 determining when prisoners should receive a face-to-face appointment with a nurse or \n8 other medical or mental health care clinician.  Consequently, LVNs arbitrarily determine \n9 whether the content of a sick call slip, often written by a prisoner who can barely read or \n10 write, warrants an appointment with a nurse or physician. \n11 107.  These failures to respond and delays in response from medical staff place \n12 prisoners in danger.  For example, during Plaintiff HERNANDEZ’s term of incarceration \n13 from April 28, 2012 to September 27, 2013, he required significant medical attention for \n14 his ileostomy and, after the ileostomy was removed, for his post-surgical care.  On many \n15 occasions, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ submitted sick call slips complaining of abdominal \n16 pain or other related symptoms.  He frequently experienced significant delays before he \n17 was seen by medical staff.  As one example, he submitted a sick call slip on October 2, \n18 2012, complaining of not receiving certain medications for his stomach and was \n19 experiencing strong cramping pains; he was not fully evaluated by appropriate medical \n20 staff until October 26, 2012—24 days later.  As another example, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ \n21 submitted sick call slips related to pain in his abdomen on November 18, 25, and \n22 December 2, 2012.  He was not evaluated by an appropriate provider prior to being \n23 transferred to the hospital on or around December 11, 2013 for his ileostomy reversal \n24 surgery, a period of 23 days. \n25 108.  Prisoners can file grievances through the Jail’s grievance procedure if they \n26 do not receive the care they need after filing a sick call slip.  However, Defendants \n27 routinely fail to respond or to provide an adequate response to submitted grievances.  For \n28 example, Plaintiff DOBBS attempted to use the grievance process to request Gabapentin \n[1144098-2]    44 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page47 of 137\n \n1 and ibuprofen that Defendants had prescribed for her after Defendants failed to provide \n2 them to her.  Defendants did not provide appropriate or timely responses to the grievances, \n3 and failed to provide the prescribed medications for more than 20 days.   \n4 109.  As another example, Plaintiff WHITFIELD had to submit five sick call slips \n5 and two grievances before he was able to obtain the emergency dental care he needed to \n6 extract an infected wisdom tooth.  Plaintiff WHITFIELD was not given an appointment \n7 with a dentist until after he had first seen two different nurses to complain of his serious \n8 pain.  At the same time, it took weeks for Plaintiff WHITFIELD to get the ibuprofen he \n9 requested.  Even after he did obtain an order for the pain medication, it was given to him \n10 intermittently and inconsistently.  Plaintiff WHITFIELD’s dental pain ceased as soon as \n11 the dentist extracted his tooth—over a month after Plaintiff WHITFIELD first alerted the \n12 Jail to his emergency dental need. \n13 110.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have failed to implement \n14 appropriate triage procedures to ensure that non-emergency medical needs are attended to \n15 before they develop into emergencies.  For example, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus \n16 aureus (“MRSA”, commonly known as “staph”) infections are frequently reported at the \n17 Jail.  Many prisoners report filing multiple sick call slips for emerging and beginning \n18 staph-related wounds, but are not seen until their wounds develop into serious and \n19 emergency conditions requiring intense treatment.  For example, one prisoner was not seen \n20 for a staph-infection-caused wound until it developed into cellulitis and a necrotizing soft \n21 tissue infection, requiring intensive and invasive treatment.  Another prisoner had a staph-\n22 infection-caused abscess that required the insertion of a surgical drain into the wound, \n23 which Defendants then failed to properly monitor and cleanse following the procedure. \n24 111.  Even when the sick call process operates as set forth in Defendants’ written \n25 policies, the sick call process places prisoners at an unreasonable risk of harm.  For \n26 example, on July 28, 2012, a prisoner was booked into the Jail whose colon had begun to \n27 rupture shortly before or after his arrest.  Once the prisoner was placed in a housing unit in \n28 the Jail, his symptoms from his condition began to worsen.  During the night he was \n[1144098-2]    45 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page48 of 137\n \n1 booked into the Jail, he filed a sick call slip stating that he had been experiencing severe \n2 abdominal pains for the previous eight hours.  The sick call slip was not reviewed by any \n3 staff at the Jail until 5 p.m. on July 29, 2012.  Moreover, the prisoner was not seen by \n4 medical staff until 12 p.m. on July 30, 2012, at which time his temperature was 102 \n5 degrees.  The prisoner was rushed to the Emergency Department at Natividad Medical \n6 Center, where he was diagnosed with a perforated bowel and had an emergency colostomy \n7 procedure that same day.  According to the medical records maintained by CFMG, at least \n8 36 hours passed between when the prisoner requested and received medical attention from \n9 staff at the Jail.  The delay in response caused the prisoner considerable and unnecessary \n10 pain, and placed him at a significant risk of death. \n11 112.  Upon information and belief, custody staff do not adequately respond to \n12 requests from prisoners for medical care.  When Plaintiff SARABI complained about \n13 intense pain in his right foot/ankle, and voiced concern about a broken ankle and a possible \n14 concussion one hour after he was attacked by another prisoner, one of the guards outside \n15 his room said, “You’re a tough guy, suck it up, if you had broken your ankle you would be \n16 in more pain.”  Delays in treating Plaintiff SARABI and other prisoners have created \n17 unnecessary suffering and worsened health outcomes.  Upon information and belief, \n18 Defendants do not adequately train custody staff in how to respond to prisoners’ requests \n19 for emergency medical attention. \n20 F.  Defendants Routinely and Systematically Fail to Provide Adequate \nMedical Care \n21  \n22 113.  Defendants fail to provide timely access to medical and dental care.  \n23 Defendants’ policies and practices for providing timely access to medical and dental care \n24 are inadequate.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody \n25 and medical staff in how to provide timely access to medical and dental care.  If prisoners \n26 are seen by health care providers at all, they often experience substantial delays in \n27 receiving those appointments.  Prisoners also experience long delays before they are seen \n28 and treated by outside specialists, before they receive surgery at outside facilities, or before \n[1144098-2]    46 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page49 of 137\n \n1 they receive dental care.  The Jail has also failed to institute adequate policies and practices \n2 to treat prisoners with chronic conditions.  Prisoners commonly wait several weeks, \n3 sometimes several months, before they are evaluated by clinicians for medical symptoms.  \n4 As a result of these deficiencies, prisoners with serious and life-threatening conditions \n5 unnecessarily suffer and are put at risk of harm. \n6 114.  For example, in October, November, and December 2013, Plaintiff PEREZ \n7 was seen by three specialists at outside medical facilities regarding the tumor on his foot.  \n8 Each of these specialists instructed that Plaintiff PEREZ needed to be seen by an expert in \n9 orthopedic oncology at a tertiary facility such as Stanford or UCSF for evaluation and \n10 treatment of the possibly cancerous tumor.  Upon information and belief, to date, more \n11 than six months after the original referral, Plaintiff PEREZ still has not been seen by an \n12 orthopedic oncologist.  Plaintiff PEREZ was informed by at least one of the three doctors \n13 whom he saw that if he did not receive proper attention for his tumor, he was at risk of \n14 having his foot amputated. \n15 115.  Plaintiff HERNANDEZ was supposed to have his colostomy reversed in \n16 June 2012.  However, CFMG medical staff repeatedly refused to perform the colostomy \n17 reversal surgery, at first claiming that it was improper for Jail doctors to do so when an \n18 outside doctor had performed the original colostomy, and then claiming that the procedure \n19 was “non-emergency” so could not be done at the Jail.  The Jail also refused to transfer \n20 Plaintiff HERNANDEZ to a facility where he could receive the reversal surgery, and in \n21 August 2012 denied Plaintiff HERNANDEZ the day pass necessary to go to Santa Clara \n22 County for the surgery.  In total, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ had to wait eight months to have \n23 his colostomy surgery after he arrived at the Jail, during which time he suffered from \n24 intestinal swelling, bleeding, and pain. \n25 116.  Plaintiff COBB disclosed during her intake screening on April 4, 2013, that \n26 she had seen an outside provider and been referred to a urologist for complaints of cloudy \n27 and discolored urine.  Over the next eight weeks, Defendants repeatedly failed to diagnose \n28 Plaintiff COBB’s severe kidney stones, at times treating her for a urinary tract infection \n[1144098-2]    47 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page50 of 137\n \n1 and at times offering no treatment at all.  On June 1, 2013 she was taken to Natividad \n2 Medical Center in an ambulance due to a high fever and severe pain.  At Natividad, she \n3 was finally diagnosed as having large kidney stones.  Doctors at Natividad instructed that \n4 she be seen by a urologist immediately.  She was not seen by a urologist until June 19, \n5 2013, at which time the urologist was concerned about whether Plaintiff COBB had lost so \n6 much kidney function that her kidney would have to be removed.  On June 25, 2013, \n7 Plaintiff COBB had a surgical drain inserted into her kidney, and shortly thereafter it was \n8 determined that her affected kidney only had approximately 31% remaining function.  She \n9 did not receive any surgery to remove any kidney stones until September 13, 2013.  She \n10 has suffered severe and unnecessary pain and risk of permanent loss of kidney function \n11 due to Defendants’ failure to timely diagnose and appropriately treat her medical \n12 condition. \n13 117.  Other prisoners have repeatedly been denied necessary medical treatments or \n14 experienced significant delays in receiving what they needed or had been prescribed prior \n15 to arriving at the Jail, resulting in significant physical pain and discomfort, as well as \n16 increased anxiety and panic.  For example, one prisoner repeatedly requested colostomy \n17 reversal surgery for three months, but was informed by Defendants that he could not \n18 receive the surgery because it was an “elective,” as opposed to emergency, procedure.  \n19 During these three months, this prisoner suffered from infections, bloody discharge, \n20 fainting, and vomiting.  Another prisoner was not timely provided with appropriate \n21 colostomy supplies, and when he appeared in court, he was leaking feces over his body.  \n22 The judge ordered him to be sent immediately to the hospital in an ambulance. \n23 118.  Plaintiff HOBBS suffers from asthma and has been prescribed an Albuterol \n24 inhaler during his current and past terms in the Jail.  In late-February 2014, his Albuterol \n25 inhaler ran out.  Despite numerous sick call slips and other requests to medical staff, was \n26 not refilled for more than a month.  Without his inhaler, he suffered asthma attacks on a \n27 near-nightly basis.  Defendants also failed to provide Plaintiffs ESQUIVEL and \n28 MEFFORD with the inhalers they require to treat their asthma.  Plaintiff ESQUIVEL \n[1144098-2]    48 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page51 of 137\n \n1 requires two inhalers—Albuterol and Flovent.  During a previous stay in the Jail from \n2 January to February 2014, he was allowed to bring in his own inhalers, which were almost \n3 empty.  When they ran out after a couple of weeks, he was not given replacements, despite \n4 orally requesting new inhalers from the staff.  During his current stay in the Jail, Plaintiff \n5 ESQUIVEL is only receiving Flovent, not Albuterol.  As a result, he is wheezing at night \n6 and experiencing increased fatigue.  Plaintiff MEFFORD was provided with an inhaler \n7 during his initial days in the Jail in early December 2013.  However, the Jail staff failed to \n8 mark the inhaler as his property.  Custody staff thus confiscated it during a search as \n9 suspected contraband.  Plaintiff MEFFORD requested a replacement inhaler from a nurse \n10 in January 2014.  However, the nurse failed to find the doctor’s order from December 2013 \n11 prescribing an inhaler for Plaintiff MEFFORD in his medical records.  Thus, the nurse \n12 denied Plaintiff MEFFORD a new inhaler.  Plaintiff MEFFORD had to again request to \n13 see the medical staff before a different staff member was able to find the order for an \n14 inhaler in his file and gave it to him.  Without his inhaler, Plaintiff MEFFORD suffered \n15 increased chest pain and tightness and struggled to breathe normally. \n16 119.  Upon information and belief, CFMG medical staff inform prisoners that they \n17 will not receive medically necessary treatments, procedures, or medications while in the \n18 Jail because their release from the Jail or transfer to state prison or another institution is \n19 allegedly imminent.  For example, notes in Plaintiff PEREZ’s medical file made by a \n20 doctor employed by CFMG indicate that Defendants may have been attempting to delay \n21 his referral to an orthopedic oncologist at UCSF or Stanford in an attempt to avoid the \n22 expense involved in transporting Plaintiff PEREZ to the specialist.  In addition, in response \n23 to Plaintiff PEREZ’s inquiries to nurses at the Jail for information regarding when he \n24 might see an appropriate specialist, Plaintiff PEREZ has been asked by the nurses when he \n25 will getting out of custody. \n26 120.  Defendants have demonstrated that they are incapable of properly managing \n27 and treating severe chronic conditions suffered by many prisoners.  For example, Plaintiff \n28 MILLER has severe type 1 diabetes.  Staff of Defendants MONTEREY COUNTY and the \n[1144098-2]    49 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page52 of 137\n \n1 SHERIFF’S OFFICE wrote on an Intake Health Screening form dated January 8, 2013, \n2 that Plaintiff MILLER had diabetes; staff of Defendant CFMG noted on an Intake Triage \n3 Assessment form completed on that same date that Plaintiff MILLER took two different \n4 types of insulin.  In nine months of incarceration Defendants have been unable to develop \n5 and implement a treatment plan to appropriately manage Plaintiff MILLER’s diabetes.  He \n6 suffers serious diabetic episodes resulting in periods of unconsciousness, and is \n7 experiencing diabetes-related vision loss and other serious and permanent side effects of \n8 his uncontrolled diabetes. \n9 121.  Plaintiff ESQUIVEL also has diabetes.  In January 2014, Plaintiff \n10 ESQUIVEL entered the jail with a high blood sugar level over 280 mg/dl.  After his intake \n11 forms noted his diabetic condition, it was ordered that he receive daily insulin.  After \n12 initially providing one dose of insulin, the Jail failed to provide him with any insulin for 48 \n13 hours, after which time Plaintiff ESQUIVEL’s blood sugar spiked above 330 mg/dl. \n14 122.  Another prisoner suffered a miscarriage immediately before being booked \n15 into the Jail, and experienced heavy vaginal bleeding for at least seven weeks afterward.  \n16 Despite repeated requests, this prisoner did not see a women’s health specialist for seven \n17 weeks.  After seven weeks of bleeding and the filing of multiple grievances (most of which \n18 went unanswered), this prisoner was finally taken to Natividad Medical Center for an \n19 evaluation by a women’s health specialist.  This prisoner did not receive timely and \n20 appropriate care for her condition. \n21 123.  In interactions with medical staff, Defendants fail to ensure that hearing and \n22 speech impaired prisoners who use American Sign Language as their primary method of \n23 communication are provided with sign language interpreters to ensure effective \n24 communication.  Without sign language, such prisoners are not able to explain to medical \n25 care providers the symptoms they are experiencing, and medical staff are not able to \n26 explain the benefits and risks of treatments, medications, and procedures such that \n27 prisoners can provide their informed consent.  The lack of sign language interpretation \n28 services results in Defendants making medical treatment decisions without all of the \n[1144098-2]    50 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page53 of 137\n \n1 necessary and pertinent information they need, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis \n2 and mistreatment for the prisoner. \n3 124.  For example, Plaintiff YANCEY was examined by a Physician’s Assistant \n4 (“PA”) at the Jail on December 4, 2012, two days after he was discharged from the \n5 hospital with a fractured right arm and fractured left tibia.  Defendants did not provide \n6 Plaintiff YANCEY with a sign language interpreter for the examination.  Though Plaintiff \n7 YANCEY presented with multiple, complex trauma issues, the PA’s Progress Note admits \n8 that the “[e]xam [was] limited due to decreased verbal communication ....”  Because of \n9 Defendants’ failure to provide Plaintiff YANCEY with a sign language interpreter, he was \n10 unable to explain the extent of his pain and other symptoms.  As a result, he suffered from \n11 needless and unnecessary pain.  Defendants also failed to provide sign language \n12 interpreters at other medical appointments for Plaintiff YANCEY.  The lack of a sign \n13 language interpreter at other medical appointments similarly resulted in Plaintiff \n14 YANCEY’s inability to communicate his symptoms to medical staff and to understand \n15 medical staff.  Through their failure to provide sign language interpreters for medical \n16 appointments, Defendants are deliberately indifferent to the medical needs of prisoners \n17 who require assistance to communicate. \n18 125.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to ensure effective \n19 communication of critical medical information to prisoners with vision loss, such as \n20 Plaintiff MILLER.  Defendants do not have a policy or protocol of implementing, tracking, \n21 or recording effective communication.  Defendants provide written materials to vision-\n22 impaired prisoners without documenting that such materials were read aloud or otherwise \n23 communicated to the prisoners, and fail to ensure that vision-impaired prisoners are \n24 adequately informed of, among other things, the medications that are being administered.  \n25 As a result of Defendants’ failure to ensure effective communication in the provision of \n26 medical care, vision-impaired prisoners are subject to risk of serious medical harms, as \n27 was the case when Plaintiff MILLER was provided with an improper insulin injection and \n28 lapsed into unconsciousness. \n[1144098-2]    51 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page54 of 137\n \n1 126.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to provide foreign language \n2 interpretation services to prisoners whose primary language is not English during medical \n3 clinical evaluations.  This is particularly true for prisoners who cannot speak either English \n4 or Spanish.  Without foreign language interpretation, such prisoners are not able to explain \n5 to doctors the symptoms they are experiencing, and medical staff are not able to explain \n6 the benefits and risks of treatments, medications, and procedures such that prisoners can \n7 provide their informed consent.  The lack of foreign language interpretation services \n8 results in Defendants making medical treatment decisions without all of the necessary and \n9 pertinent information they need, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis and mistreatment \n10 for the prisoner.  Through their failure to provide foreign language interpreters for medical \n11 appointments, Defendants are deliberately indifferent to the medical needs of prisoners \n12 who require assistance to communicate. \n13 G.  Defendants Fail to Continue Medically Necessary Treatments for \nPrisoners Upon Their Arrival at the Jail \n14  \n15 127.  Defendants fail to continue medically necessary treatments for prisoners who \n16 were in the process of undergoing care for chronic, serious, or other conditions \n17 immediately prior to being booked into the Jail, putting those prisoners at risk of harm.  \n18 Defendants’ policies and practices for continuing medically necessary treatments for \n19 prisoners who arrive at the Jail are inadequate.  Upon information and belief, Defendants \n20 do not adequately train medical staff in how to evaluate and treat prisoners who were \n21 undergoing care for chronic or serious conditions immediately prior to being booked into \n22 the Jail. \n23 128.  Defendants routinely refuse to provide medications that prisoners have been \n24 using to treat conditions outside of the Jail, even when the prisoners themselves, doctors, \n25 family members, or other entities bring their medications and/or valid prescriptions to the \n26 Jail. \n27 129.  For example, one prisoner re-entered the Jail on June 15, 2013 following a \n28 period on which she had been released by the SHERIFF’S OFFICE to home confinement \n[1144098-2]    52 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page55 of 137\n \n1 in order for her to have necessary back surgery.  On information and belief, this prisoner, \n2 who is an insulin-dependent diabetic, brought her insulin with her to the Jail on June 15, \n3 2013.  In the Diabetes section on this prisoner’s Intake Triage Assessment form dated June \n4 15, 2013, the Registered Nurse who completed the form wrote that the prisoner took seven \n5 units of Lantus twice a day.  Although Defendants were aware of her diabetic condition \n6 and need for insulin, the “Diabetic Chart” in this prisoner’s medical file indicates that she \n7 did not receive any insulin from June 15, 2013 through at least June 27, 2013.  On \n8 information and belief, this prisoner did not begin to regularly receive insulin until on or \n9 after July 24, 2013. \n10 130.  Plaintiff GIST was prescribed the muscle relaxant Flexeril by her physician \n11 prior to entering the Jail in order to help manage the chronic back pain she experiences due \n12 to her scoliosis and congenital hip dislocation.  The Jail is aware of her condition and has \n13 confirmed her prescription.  Despite numerous requests, Plaintiff GIST has not received \n14 this pain medication while in the Jail, which has exacerbated the pain and swelling in her \n15 back.  Due to her back pain Plaintiff GIST has difficulty walking, sitting, standing, and \n16 lying down in one position for a long time and has difficulty walking up stairs.  Plaintiff \n17 GIST’s condition also makes it difficult for her to balance and causes her to fall often.  She \n18 has difficulty accessing programs and services, which are up a long flight of stairs, due to \n19 the pain. \n20 131.  Plaintiff WHITFIELD suffers from narcolepsy and cataplexy, two conditions \n21 that can be adequately controlled through the provision of two medications: Provigil and \n22 Xyrem.  Plaintiff WHITFIELD was prescribed such medications by his outside specialist \n23 physician.  Plaintiff WHITFIELD requested both drugs upon entering the Jail in November \n24 2013.  Plaintiff WHITFIELD saw a physician at the Jail on December 5, 2013, who then \n25 called Plaintiff WHITFIELD’s outside specialist on December 6, 2013, to verify Plaintiff \n26 WHITFIELD’s condition and medication regime.  Immediately after this telephone call, \n27 the Jail physician ordered Provigil for Plaintiff WHITFIELD.  However, Defendants did \n28 not provide Plaintiff WHITFIELD with Provigil for nearly two months, during which time \n[1144098-2]    53 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page56 of 137\n \n1 he was at risk for falling asleep at any time, without warning.  He spent upwards of 20 \n2 hours a day in bed in an attempt to minimize his risk of falling and hurting himself.  \n3 Plaintiff WHITFIELD eventually was forced to submit two grievances before Defendants \n4 finally provided him with Provigil on or around February 1, 2014.  Defendants still refuse \n5 to provide him with Xyrem, which controls cataplexy.  As a result, Plaintiff WHITFIELD \n6 has had four cataplexic episodes in the Jail since November 30, 2013—which is a far more \n7 frequent rate of attacks than he normally experiences. \n8 132.  Defendants place many prisoners who arrive at the Jail and who are \n9 prescribed pain and other medications on what Defendants call a “detoxification \n10 treatment.”  The detoxification treatment involves taking prisoners off of their prescribed \n11 medications “cold turkey” without any tapering, and refusing, for up to 90 days, to provide \n12 prisoners with the pain and other medications they were taking pursuant to prescription \n13 before they were booked into the Jail.  This practice of removing prisoners from prescribed \n14 medications is dangerous, inhumane, and does not meet the standard of care.  Prisoners \n15 placed on the detoxification treatment and removed from prescribed pain medications \n16 suffer extreme pain, withdrawal symptoms, and degeneration of conditions the medication \n17 was designed to treat. \n18 133.  For example, one prisoner was placed on a detoxification treatment when she \n19 re-entered the Jail on June 15, 2013, following significant spinal surgery on June 3, 2013.  \n20 As treatment for the pain associated with the surgery, her treating physician outside of the \n21 Jail had prescribed for her various pain medications, including hydrocodone and diazepam.  \n22 On June 15, 2013, Defendants refused to provide this prisoner any of her prescribed pain \n23 medications and gave her only ibuprofen and anti-anxiety medications until she was seen \n24 by a physician at the Jail almost two weeks later.  Staff of Defendant CFMG placed this \n25 prisoner on detoxification treatment solely because she was taking prescribed pain \n26 medications and not because she was taking other substances, such as alcohol or illegal or \n27 non-prescribed drugs.  As a result, the prisoner experienced extreme pain and physical and \n28 emotional distress, as well as significant mobility impairment as a result of her pain and \n[1144098-2]    54 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page57 of 137\n \n1 back injuries. \n2 134.  Another prisoner was taking significant dosages of prescription pain \n3 medications for injuries stemming from gunshot wounds, including a Fentanyl patch, \n4 Oxycontin, and Oxycodone.  However, when he arrived at the Jail in August 2012, \n5 Defendants refused to provide him with any of his prescribed pain medications and \n6 subjected him to the detoxification treatment.  As a result of the detoxification treatment, \n7 this prisoner suffered through an extremely painful withdrawal.  Yet another prisoner was \n8 subjected to the formulaic detoxification treatment in March 2013, even though her intake \n9 form clearly indicates that she was receiving methadone under the supervision of a \n10 physician at Natividad Medical Center for treatment of her heroin dependency. \n11 135.  Prior to her incarceration, Plaintiff HUNTER was taking various prescription \n12 medications to treat her diabetes, fibromyalgia, high blood pressure, chronic back pain, \n13 bone cancer, seizures, bipolar disorder, manic depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.  \n14 Plaintiff HUNTER had many of these medications with her upon her arrival at the Jail, but \n15 they were confiscated during the booking process.  Defendants refused to provide her with \n16 all of her necessary medications for two weeks. \n17 136.  Prior to his incarceration, Plaintiff MURPHY was taking various prescribed \n18 pain medications at least four times a day as treatment for the nerve damage in his back.  \n19 However, despite his repeated requests, Plaintiff MURPHY has not received the necessary \n20 medications at the appropriate times, and he is in constant pain. \n21 H.  Defendants Fail to Provide Adequate Care in Emergency Situations \n22 137.  Defendants fail to provide adequate medical care when confronted with \n23 prisoners who require emergency medical attention.  Defendants’ policies and practices for \n24 providing emergency treatment to prisoners are inadequate.  Upon information and belief, \n25 Defendants do not adequately train custody or medical staff regarding how to respond to \n26 emergency medical situations and requests for emergency medical treatment from \n27 prisoners. \n28 138.  Plaintiff HERNANDEZ experienced two serious emergencies while in the \n[1144098-2]    55 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page58 of 137\n \n1 Jail in the month following his ileostomy reversal surgery in December 13, 2012.  In both \n2 instances, Defendants’ emergency response placed Plaintiff HERNANDEZ’s life in \n3 jeopardy.  The discharge instructions from his surgery indicated that he should either call \n4 the hospital or be taken to the emergency department if he had pain uncontrolled by pain \n5 medication, bleeding, inability to urinate, a fever, vomiting, or if his wounds became red or \n6 drained fluid.  On December 22, 2012, his first day back in the Jail, he saw a nurse in the \n7 early afternoon and complained of extreme pain in his abdomen near the site of his \n8 surgery.  Instead of immediately returning him to the hospital, the nurse called a PA, who \n9 ordered Tylenol, Milk of Magnesium, and Colace, and instructed that she should be called \n10 if his condition worsened.  By 2:15 P.M., his condition had worsened.  The nurse paged \n11 the PA, but did not send Plaintiff HERNANDEZ to the emergency department.  When the \n12 PA did not respond, the nurse paged her again at 3:15 P.M.; still, the nurse did not send \n13 Plaintiff HERNANDEZ to the emergency department, even though his symptoms persisted \n14 and had possibly worsened.  Finally, at 3:50 P.M., one of the Jail doctors called and \n15 ordered that he should be sent to the hospital.  Ultimately,  Plaintiff HERNANDEZ was \n16 transported to Natividad, where he remained for eight days to treat a bowel obstruction.  \n17 The December 30, 2012 discharge note from the hospital stated that he should be returned \n18 to the emergency room if he had a fever, increased pain, vomiting, inability to have a \n19 bowel movement, or for any other problem. \n20 139.  On January 7, 2013, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ complained early in the \n21 morning to a nurse that he had a fever, that he woke up in a sweat, that he had diarrhea, \n22 that he was experiencing nausea, and that he had vomited one time.  Rather than sending \n23 Plaintiff HERNANDEZ to the emergency department, the nurse ordered that he be \n24 provided Imodium and Phenergan and be evaluated by the PA later that day.  Plaintiff \n25 HERNANDEZ was never seen by the PA that day.  When he saw a nurse at 6:00 P.M. to \n26 change his dressing, he told her that he felt like he had a fever.  She measured his \n27 temperature, which was 101.0 degrees.  The nurse did not contact a doctor or the PA or \n28 send Plaintiff HERNANDEZ to the emergency department.  Instead, she entered an order \n[1144098-2]    56 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page59 of 137\n \n1 to provide him with Tylenol, have his temperature checked regularly for a day, and set him \n2 up to be seen by the PA the next day. \n3 140.  That night, at about 1 A.M., Plaintiff HERNANDEZ started experiencing \n4 unbearable pain in his abdomen, which he describes as the worst pain of his life.  At the \n5 time, he was single-celled in J-Pod.  He collapsed on his bunk and could not move.  He \n6 pleaded with another prisoner to get the attention of staff, but there was no custody staff \n7 around for the prisoner to notify for about 15 minutes.  Staff finally made their rounds of \n8 the pods and the prisoner spoke with the staff.  Without entering the pod or looking at \n9 Plaintiff HERNANDEZ, the officer stated that medical staff wouldn’t be able to come for \n10 30 minutes.  The other prisoner said “But he’s already been down for 15 minutes.”  The \n11 officer said, “I’ll see what I can do.”  About a half hour passed and the same officer passed \n12 by J-Pod to conduct a regular check.  The same prisoner banged on his door to get the \n13 guard’s attention.  The prisoner said that Plaintiff HERNANDEZ still hadn’t been seen by \n14 medical staff.  The guard then entered the pod for the first time and observed Plaintiff \n15 HERNANDEZ.  He said “I’ll be right back, let me get a hold of my Sergeant.”  He then \n16 left the pod.  Another 10-15 minutes passed and still no medical staff came to see Plaintiff \n17 HERNANDEZ.  Other prisoners started banging on their doors and yelling “Man down!” \n18 to try to get staff attention.  Finally, medical staff finally arrived at around 2:50 A.M. on \n19 January 8, 2013.  Plaintiff HERNANDEZ was transported to Natividad at 3:00 A.M., and \n20 remained in the hospital for treatment of multiple abscesses until February 27, 2013. \n21 141.  Plaintiff DOBBS sustained a fractured nose, a permanent post-traumatic \n22 tremor in her right hand from mild traumatic brain injury, and nerve damage, pain, and \n23 numbness in her left leg, knee, and ankle when she fell at the courthouse while shackled at \n24 the ankles, waist, and wrist.  In addition to the permanent damage, she also suffered two \n25 black eyes and bruises on her elbows, knees, and ankles.  Plaintiff DOBBS did not receive \n26 timely medical attention, proper pain medication, or proper follow-up tests after the \n27 incident despite the serious nature of the fall.  For example, although she was given an ice \n28 pack and one dose of pain medication immediately after the incident, she did not see a \n[1144098-2]    57 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page60 of 137\n \n1 nurse until later that night despite being in severe pain.  When Plaintiff DOBBS did see the \n2 nurse, the nurse simply gave her an ibuprofen prescription and recommended she go to \n3 sick call three days later with the PA.  In fact, Plaintiff DOBBS had fractured her nose.  \n4 The injury was not diagnosed for more than a week.  She also experienced the onset of a \n5 tremor in her right hand, but was not taken to see a specialist for more than a month.  This \n6 specialist concluded she had a post-traumatic tremor from a mild traumatic brain injury \n7 sustained from her fall.  Medical staff should have, but did not, recognize the seriousness \n8 of her injuries when they occurred and provided more timely and appropriate treatment. \n9 142.  In emergency situations, prisoners sometimes request health care from \n10 custody staff when medical staff are not available.  Rather than immediately contact health \n11 care staff to determine whether emergency care is required, custody staff often dismiss the \n12 prisoner’s request and instruct prisoners to fill out a sick call slip.  Plaintiff \n13 HERNANDEZ’s experience, discussed above, in which it took approximately 60 minutes \n14 for custody staff to summon emergency medical care, is one example of this problem. \n15 143.  Upon information and belief, another prisoner in the Jail suffered a \n16 miscarriage due to the Jail’s failure to timely respond to her emergency medical situation.  \n17 While pregnant, this prisoner began to experience uterine cramping and bleeding, but was \n18 informed by medical staff to go on bed rest.  The Jail staff did not transport her to a \n19 hospital until at least two days later, and by that time she had lost her baby.  Between \n20 2012-2013, at least two women in the Jail suffered from miscarriages. \n21 144.  Often there is neither custody nor medical staff around.  Prisoners are thus \n22 forced to provide needed care to each other.  For example, Plaintiff ESQUIVEL started \n23 bleeding profusely from his leg wound in October 2013.  As there were no custody staff \n24 nor medical staff in the area, other prisoners had to actively seek a guard’s attention before \n25 any custody staff recognized the existence of an emergency.  This delayed care for \n26 Plaintiff ESQUIVEL’s leg considerably.  As another example, Plaintiff WHITFIELD has \n27 collapsed in a cataplexic episode four times thus far during his incarceration.  Twice, no \n28 one woke him up and he woke up on the floor by himself.  The third time, other prisoners \n[1144098-2]    58 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page61 of 137\n \n1 saw him collapse and banged on their doors to alert the guards.  The fourth time, he was \n2 awoken on the floor by medical staff coming by to bring him his medication.  These staff \n3 members did nothing to respond to him being on the floor but merely asked if he was \n4 ready to take his medication. \n5 I.  Defendants Fail to Provide Adequate Diagnostic Care to Prisoners, \nIncluding Failing to Appropriately Refer Prisoners to Outside \n6 Specialists When Necessary \n7 145.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to order diagnostic testing \n8 when medically necessary, creating an unreasonable risk of harm to prisoners.  \n9 Defendants’ policies and practices for ordering diagnostic testing are inadequate.  Upon \n10 information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train medical staff in when it is \n11 appropriate to order diagnostic testing. \n12 146.  When Plaintiff COBB reported unusually cloudy and discolored urine and \n13 increasing pain over a period of nearly six weeks, CFMG personnel evidently performed \n14 no diagnostic tests other than taking urine samples, which yielded inconsistent results and \n15 failed to lead to a diagnosis of Plaintiff COBB’s large kidney stones.  No ultrasound was \n16 performed until Plaintiff COBB was taken by ambulance to Natividad Medical Center on \n17 June 1, 2013. \n18 147.  In September 2013, an outside neurologist treating Plaintiff DILLEY for her \n19 likely diagnosis of MS ordered that Plaintiff DILLEY receive a full neuropsychiatric \n20 assessment to evaluate her cognitive function.  To date, Defendants have not provided \n21 Plaintiff DILLEY with a full neuropsychiatric assessment. \n22 148.  When Plaintiff KEY reported to a PA at the Jail that he had previously been \n23 treated for a salivary gland tumor and was experiencing a recurrence of that tumor, no \n24 appropriate diagnostic tests were performed.  Rather, the PA told him, on the basis of no \n25 testing, that it was a fatty tumor and did not require further treatment.  Plaintiff KEY was \n26 only seen by a doctor for proper evaluation of his complaint after he filed a grievance. \n27 149.  When Plaintiff SARABI sustained an injury to his right ankle/foot after he \n28 was attacked by another prisoner, he did not timely receive tests to determine the extent of \n[1144098-2]    59 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page62 of 137\n \n1 the muscle and nerve damage.  Other prisoners do not receive medically indicated \n2 diagnostic tests such as colonoscopies or ultrasounds in a timely manner. \n3 150.  Defendants also fail to refer prisoners to medical specialists or to an outside \n4 medical center when medically necessary.  Defendants’ policies and practices for referring \n5 prisoners to specialists or outside providers are inadequate.  Upon information and belief, \n6 Defendants fail to adequately train medical staff regarding when it is appropriate to refer \n7 prisoners to medical specialists or outside medical centers. \n8 151.  For example, Plaintiff GUYOT suffered a concussion when he was attacked \n9 by a group of other prisoners on March 15, 2013.  On March 31, 2013, he filed the first of \n10 approximately 26 sick call slips in which he has complained of blurred vision, severe \n11 migraines, dizziness, and/or sensitivity to light.  He was not sent for a CT scan until \n12 May 16, 2013 (by which time he had filed approximately seven sick call slips with similar \n13 complaints of post-concussion trauma), and was not seen by a neurologist until June 7, \n14 2013.  Since June 7, 2013, he has filed approximately 17 sick call slips continuing to report \n15 serious vision and neurologic issues, but on information and belief, he has not been seen \n16 by any other specialists. \n17 152.  Plaintiff COBB suffered a delay of more than two weeks between her \n18 diagnosis, at Natividad Medical Center, of severe kidney stones and her first follow up \n19 visit with an outside medical provider.  This delay was in part due to the Defendant’s \n20 failure to promptly ensure that the first provider to whom Plaintiff COBB was referred \n21 would accept prisoner patients, which resulted in the belated cancellation of an \n22 appointment and a delayed effort to find a willing provider.  After Plaintiff COBB had a \n23 surgical drain inserted into her kidney, she then went more than six weeks without again \n24 seeing a specialist or having surgery to remove her kidney stones. \n25 153.  As is discussed above in Paragraph 114, in October 2013, outside medical \n26 specialists first instructed that Plaintiff PEREZ be seen by an expert in orthopedic \n27 oncology at a tertiary facility to evaluate a possibly-cancerous tumor on his foot.  Upon \n28 information and belief, he still has not been seen by an orthopedic oncologist. \n[1144098-2]    60 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page63 of 137\n \n1 154.  Plaintiff MILLER began to complain of extremely painful involuntary hand \n2 contractions in mid-April 2013.  Defendants did not arrange for a necessary hand operation \n3 to occur until July 27, 2013, leaving Plaintiff MILLER in excruciating pain and with \n4 limited use of his hand for more than two months.  Plaintiff MILLER also began to \n5 complain of blurred vision by February 27, 2013.  Although vision loss is a common and \n6 well-known complication of diabetes, Plaintiff MILLER did not see an ophthalmologist \n7 until April 17, 2013, did not have a follow-up appointment until May 11, 2013, and did not \n8 have a final ophthalmology appointment until July 24, 2013.  Despite the long delays \n9 between specialist visits, Jail medical staff deferred eye examinations during Plaintiff \n10 MILLER’s check-ups on the grounds that he was under an ophthalmologist’s care. \n11 155.  Upon information and belief, another prisoner in the Jail suffered a \n12 miscarriage due to the Jail’s failure to timely take her to a hospital after this prisoner \n13 reports uterine cramping and bleeding.  Defendants did not order any diagnostic testing or \n14 take her to see a specialist.  Two days later she was transferred to the hospital, and by that \n15 time she had lost her baby. \n16 J.  Defendants Fail to Provide Adequate Post-Operative and Other \nMedically Necessary Follow-Up Care to Prisoners \n17  \n18 156.  Defendants fail to adequately treat prisoners discharged from the hospital or \n19 Jail infirmary.  Defendants’ policies and practices for treating prisoners discharged from \n20 the hospital or infirmary are inadequate.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to \n21 adequately train employees regarding how to appropriately and effectively treat prisoners \n22 discharged from the hospital or infirmary. \n23 157.  For example, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ received colostomy reversal surgery in \n24 December 2012, and had to return to the hospital one day after surgery due to post-\n25 operative complications.  Since his discharge from Natividad Medical Center, Plaintiff \n26 HERNANDEZ has received inadequate care from CFMG medical staff.  Specifically, \n27 Plaintiff HERNANDEZ’s gauze at the surgery site was not changed every 24 hours as is \n28 ordered, he did not receive his prescribed narcotics, and, when he experienced fever and \n[1144098-2]    61 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page64 of 137\n \n1 severe pain, Jail staff failed to contact staff at the Natividad Medical Center (as they had \n2 been instructed to do in the discharge summary). \n3 158.  Another prisoner suffered a ruptured colon and had to undergo colostomy \n4 surgery in August 2012.  After he was discharged from the Jail infirmary following the \n5 surgery, Defendants failed to timely provide him with supplies to change his colostomy \n6 bag, and when such supplies were provided, they were often improper (e.g., the wrong size \n7 colostomy bag).  In November 2012, because of the improper post-operative treatment and \n8 maintenance of the colostomy and Defendants’ refusal to authorize a colostomy reversal \n9 procedure, an infection developed around his stoma from the colostomy surgery and the \n10 prisoner suffered from bloody discharge from his colon. \n11 159.  Plaintiff DOBBS suffers from Right Carpal Tunnel syndrome which may \n12 have been exacerbated by her fall at the courthouse in November 2012.  Although her \n13 outside neurologist recommended a hard wrist splint over a year ago, and Jail medical staff \n14 orders her such a wrist splint seven months ago, she has still yet to receive the splint.  \n15 Without the splint Plaintiff DOBBS continues to experience pain, numbness, and tingling \n16 in her right wrist and hand which keeps her up at night.  In lieu of the wrist splint, Plaintiff \n17 DOBBS has been given an ACE bandage wrap, which is not effective.  Plaintiff DOBBS \n18 has also had the ACE wrap taken twice in raids on her pod after which time it has taken \n19 her two weeks to a month to get the bandage back. \n20 160.  Plaintiff COBB was diagnosed with large kidney stones at Natividad \n21 Medical Center on June 1, 2013, and had a surgical drain inserted into her kidney on \n22 June 26, 2013.  In the four weeks between her diagnosis and the insertion of the drain, \n23 Defendants failed to consistently provide her with the pain medications that she had been \n24 prescribed at Natividad.  When she returned to the Jail after her June 26, 2013 surgery, she \n25 experienced several weeks of increasing pain, nightly fevers, and distress due to \n26 Defendants’ failure to consistently provide her with prescribed post-operative pain \n27 medications. \n28 161.  Another prisoner had major spinal surgery shortly before she re-entered the \n[1144098-2]    62 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page65 of 137\n \n1 Jail on June 15, 2013.  CFMG medical personnel made no arrangements to ensure \n2 continuity of post-operative care either within the Jail or by this prisoner’s outside treating \n3 physicians.  Although a CFMG physician noted on June 28, 2013, that post-operation \n4 appointments with her treating physician would be approved, the prisoner was required to \n5 submit multiple requests for temporary release in order to attend scheduled appointments \n6 with her treating physicians, none of which were approved by Jail staff until July 26, 2013, \n7 nearly six weeks after she returned to the Jail. \n8 162.  Plaintiff MILLER had surgery on his hand for diabetes-related complications \n9 on June 27, 2013.  Following the surgery, Defendants failed to consistently provide \n10 Plaintiff MILLER with timely and appropriate pain medications.  As a result, he has \n11 suffered severe and unnecessary pain and has had limited use of his hand. \n12 163.  Plaintiff AGUILAR had to receive surgery while in custody to fix the \n13 fractured cheekbone he suffered after he was attacked by another inmate.  He was returned \n14 to the Jail the same morning as his surgery.  Once back in the Jail, he did not receive \n15 adequate follow-up care.  Despite orders from both the outside doctor and Jail medical \n16 staff that Plaintiff AGUILAR was to be on a soft diet, he did not receive the proper diet.  \n17 Despite filing numerous sick call slips and two grievances about the diet, Plaintiff \n18 AGUILAR went nearly two weeks without medically appropriate food to eat.  During this \n19 time Plaintiff AGUILAR lost significant weight, constantly felt dizzy, could not \n20 concentrate, and often lacked the energy to do anything other than lay on his bed. \n21 164.  In addition, Plaintiff AGUILAR experienced problems receiving prescribed \n22 pain medication after his surgery.  Despite orders from Jail medical staff that he was to \n23 receive Norco for 10 days, the medication stopped after the first five days, requiring him to \n24 fill out a sick call slip and a grievance in order to be seen by a doctor and get back on the \n25 medication.  During the time Plaintiff AGUILAR was without Norco, his pain spiked to \n26 nine out of 10 and it was back to nearly the same amount of pain as right after the injury \n27 had occurred.  He had stitches on both the inside of his and the outside of his face, which \n28 gave him sharp stabs of pain in addition to the throbbing pain where the fracture had \n[1144098-2]    63 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page66 of 137\n \n1 occurred. \n2 165.  Upon information and belief, Defendants routinely release prisoners with \n3 serious medical conditions from the Jail without providing them with services to ensure \n4 that their medical care is not disrupted.  Defendants’ policies and practices for the \n5 provision of continuing medical care services upon a prisoner’s release are inadequate.  \n6 Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody and medical staff \n7 regarding how to appropriately release prisoners with serious medical concerns so that \n8 such prisoners can continue their medical care.  Upon information and belief, for those \n9 prisoners who are prescribed medications in the Jail, they are released without either a \n10 supply of or a prescription for them to fill those medications at a community pharmacy.  \n11 Defendants do not schedule follow-up appointments in the community, nor are prisoners \n12 provided with sufficient referrals or information about where they may receive medical \n13 care services or medications. \n14 K.  Defendants Fail to Maintain Adequate, Accurate, and Complete Medical \nCare Records \n15  \n16 166.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to maintain adequate, accurate, \n17 and complete medical care records.  Defendants’ policies and practices for maintaining \n18 adequate accurate and complete medical care records are inadequate.  Upon information \n19 and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train medical staff in how to maintain adequate \n20 medical care records. \n21 167.  For example, physicians change prisoners’ medications without documenting \n22 a rationale. \n23 168.  Many of the medical files for Plaintiffs are incomplete.  For example, some \n24 are missing progress notes that were dictated but never placed in the medical file. \n25 169.  As a result of Defendants’ failure to maintain adequate medical care records, \n26 prisoners suffer from a substantial risk of misdiagnosis, dangerous mistakes, and \n27 unnecessary delays in care. \n28 170.  For example, Plaintiff MEFFORD was denied his prescribed inhaler for a \n[1144098-2]    64 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page67 of 137\n \n1 few days because a nurse did not find the order prescribing it in his records.  Another nurse \n2 was able to find the order a few days later. \n3 171.  Defendants do not appear to have any policy, procedure, or practice for \n4 tracking, recording, or storing sick call slips in prisoners’ medical files.  Rather, the sick \n5 call slips appear to be stored in a loose and disorganized stack of slips of paper. \n6 172.  On information and belief, prisoners’ medical files do not contain any log of \n7 sick call slips submitted, what complaints were raised in the sick call slips, and whether or \n8 when the prisoner was seen with regard to the complaint raised.  As a result, prisoners’ \n9 medical records do not contain a complete record of the condition of the prisoner or the \n10 care he or she has been provided, which compromises the adequacy of care that prisoners \n11 receives. \n12 173.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to obtain medical files from \n13 outside providers for significant periods of time after the prisoner’s arrival at the Jail (if at \n14 all).  When prisoners who arrive at the Jail inform CFMG employees that they suffer from \n15 a condition or take certain prescription medications, medical providers often indicate in \n16 progress notes that they will not provide the prisoner with the requested care until they can \n17 confirm the condition or prescription medication through outside medical or pharmacy \n18 records.  Defendants routinely fail to request and obtain outside records in a timely manner \n19 or at all.  Nonetheless, Defendants use their lack of possession of outside medical records \n20 as a justification for denying prisoners the care they were receiving outside of the Jail and \n21 are requesting inside the Jail.  Defendants’ repeated failures to timely obtain medical \n22 records from outside providers or pharmacies reduce the quality of medical care, as \n23 medical staff treat prisoners without reviewing pertinent medication background \n24 information and history, and significantly increase the risk of misdiagnosis, mistreatment, \n25 and harm. \n26 174.  Plaintiff HERNANDEZ’s medical file does not include any progress notes or \n27 discharge summaries for either his December 13, 2012 surgery to reverse his ileostomy or \n28 for his seven-week hospitalization for abscesses in his abdomen. \n[1144098-2]    65 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page68 of 137\n \n1 175.  Plaintiff AGUILAR was prescribed Vicodin by an outside doctor to help \n2 manage his pain prior to surgery for his fractured cheek bone.  He was placed back in \n3 custody prior to the surgery.  Although he informed medical staff of his pain medication, \n4 medical staff said they would not give it to him because they had to verify his prescription.  \n5 Defendants never provided him with the medication. \n6 176.  Plaintiff AGUILAR’s file is missing complete outside medical records from \n7 the doctor’s office who performed surgery to repair the fracture in his cheek.  The Jail \n8 medical file does not contain progress notes of Plaintiff AGUILAR’s February 13 and 15, \n9 2013 appointments in which he was initially examined, given post-operative instructions, \n10 and scheduled for surgery. \n11 177.  Defendants also fail to provide complete and accurate medical records \n12 regarding treatment within the Jail to outside providers to whom prisoners are sent for \n13 specialty care.  For example, one prisoner was sent to an orthopedic specialist for follow-\n14 up care for his severe dog bite.  That specialist noted:  “It is unclear at this point if he is on \n15 any medications.  I do not have any records from the jail.”  Defendants’ failure to ensure \n16 that outside providers have access to jail medical records subjects prisoners to \n17 unreasonable risks of harm, including, but not limited to, risks of fatal drug interactions. \n18 178.  MONTEREY COUNTY has contracted with the County of Alameda to \n19 house certain Monterey County Jail prisoners in Alameda County’s Santa Rita Jail \n20 Facility.  According to the terms of the contract between the counties, prisoners remain in \n21 the legal custody of MONTEREY COUNTY and may be returned to Monterey County Jail \n22 at any time.  In addition, the agreement may be cancelled upon 30 days’ notice of either \n23 party, which would result in the return of all prisoners to the Monterey County Jail.  Under \n24 the contract between the counties, MONTEREY COUNTY retains the right to pre-approve \n25 outside medical care for prisoners it sends to Alameda County, and has contractual \n26 obligations to provide the medical records of Monterey County Jail prisoners to Alameda \n27 County.  Dozens of Monterey County Jail prisoners have been sent to Alameda County \n28 pursuant to the contract between the counties, including Plaintiff GREIM.  As described \n[1144098-2]    66 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page69 of 137\n \n1 above, however, they are subject to return to the Jail and its unconstitutional conditions at \n2 any time. \n3 179.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have not ensured that the medical \n4 and medication records of prisoners who are sent to Alameda County accompany those \n5 prisoners to Alameda County or follow in a timely manner.  As a result, Monterey County \n6 prisoners, including Plaintiff GREIM, have experienced interruptions in care and delays in \n7 receiving necessary medications when transferred to the physical custody of Alameda \n8 County. \n9 L.  Defendants Fail to Adequately Train Staff to Provide Appropriate and \nTimely Medical Care \n10  \n11 180.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody and \n12 medical staff in how to provide appropriate and timely medical care.  The lack of training \n13 is evident from the numerous incidents in which prisoners’ health and lives were placed at \n14 risk as a result of the deficient medical care provided in the Jail.  As a result of a lack of \n15 adequate training, custody and health care staff do not, among other failings: timely and \n16 appropriately identify medical and dental problems during the screening and intake \n17 process, properly process and timely respond to prisoners’ requests for medical evaluation, \n18 evaluate and treat prisoners who were undergoing care for chronic or serious conditions \n19 prior to being booked into the Jail, appropriately respond to emergency medical situations \n20 and requests for emergency medical treatment from prisoners, timely order appropriate \n21 diagnostic testing, timely refer prisoners to appropriate medical specialists or outside \n22 medical centers, appropriately and effectively treat prisoners discharged from the hospital \n23 or infirmary, appropriately release prisoners with serious medical concerns so that such \n24 prisoners can continue their medical care, and maintain adequate medical care records. \n25 III.  DEFENDANTS FAIL TO PROVIDE MINIMALLY ADEQUATE MENTAL \nHEALTH CARE TO PRISONERS \n26  \n27 181.  Defendants MONTEREY COUNTY, MONTEREY COUNTY SHERIFF’S \n28 OFFICE, and CFMG are not meeting their constitutional obligation to provide adequate \n[1144098-2]    67 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page70 of 137\n \n1 mental health care to prisoners in the Jail.  The mental health care provided by Defendants \n2 to prisoners in the Jail is woefully inadequate and falls far short of all of the minimum \n3 elements of a constitutional mental health system.  Defendants are deliberately indifferent \n4 to the fact that their failure to provide adequate mental health care subjects prisoners to a \n5 substantial risk of deteriorating psychiatric conditions, extreme and unnecessary anguish \n6 and suffering, and, in some cases, even death. \n7 182.  All mental health care in the Jail, like medical care, is provided by Defendant \n8 CFMG and its employees.  CFMG provides these services pursuant to its contract with \n9 Defendants MONTEREY COUNTY and the SHERIFF’S OFFICE.  CFMG is a for-profit \n10 corporation. \n11 183.  Prisoners are entirely dependent on Defendants for all mental health care.  \n12 Defendants provide and control all mental health care services.  Accordingly, prisoners \n13 cannot receive any mental health care services—including psychotropic medication, group \n14 and individual therapy, and suicide intervention—unless Defendants provide them.  \n15 Defendants control prisoners’ access to mental health care professionals, inside or outside \n16 of the Jail, as well as their access to laboratory or other diagnostic testing. \n17 A.  Defendants Fail to Identify and Track Prisoners in Need of Mental \nHealth Care \n18  \n19 184.  Defendants fail to adequately identify, track, and treat the mental health \n20 problems of newly arriving prisoners during the screening and intake process.  Defendants’ \n21 policies and practices for mental health screening and tracking are inadequate.  Upon \n22 information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody staff regarding how to \n23 timely and appropriately identify prisoners with mental health problems during the \n24 screening and intake process.  The first step of the intake process involves custody staff \n25 completing a brief one-page general health screening form, called an Intake Health \n26 Screening form, through a cursory interview conducted with the prisoner in a non-\n27 confidential area of the Jail.  The form itself fails to capture basic and essential data \n28 necessary to identify prisoners in need of mental health care, including those at risk of self-\n[1144098-2]    68 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page71 of 137\n \n1 harm.  When a prisoner is newly booked into the Jail, mental health staff play no role in \n2 the initial screening of the prisoner.  As a result, prisoners in need of mental health care at \n3 admission are either denied that care, or their care is delayed, causing them unnecessary \n4 suffering. \n5 185.  After the custody staff complete the Intake Health Screening form, newly \n6 booked prisoners are typically interviewed by a member of the medical staff employed by \n7 CFMG.  The medical staff member, typically a Licensed Vocational Nurse (“LVN”) or \n8 other medical staff not trained in mental health and without ability to order treatments or \n9 prescribe medications, complete a two-sided Intake Triage Assessment form.  Mental \n10 health staff play no role in this process.  Mental health staff only evaluate prisoners at \n11 intake if the medical care staff who complete the Intake Triage Assessment form refer the \n12 prisoner to mental health care staff.  Upon information and belief, intake evaluations by \n13 mental health staff, when they occur at all, frequently do not take place until days or weeks \n14 after a prisoner is booked into the Jail. \n15 186.  Defendants also fail to provide adequate treatment to prisoners who arrive at \n16 the Jail and have been prescribed psychotropic medications.  Defendants’ policies and \n17 practices for prisoners who have been taking prescribed psychotropic medications are \n18 inadequate.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental health \n19 staff regarding how to evaluate and treat prisoners who arrive at the Jail and have been \n20 taking prescribed psychotropic medications.  Defendants sometimes place prisoners who \n21 arrive at the Jail and who are prescribed psychotropic medications on what Defendants call \n22 a detoxification treatment.  The detoxification treatment involves refusing, for up to 90 \n23 days, to provide prisoners with the psychotropic medications they were taking before they \n24 were booked into the Jail.  This practice of removing prisoners from prescribed \n25 medications is dangerous, inhumane, and does not meet the standard of care.  Prisoners \n26 placed on the detoxification treatment and removed from psychotropic medications \n27 experience unnecessary pain and increases in psychiatric symptoms including paranoia, \n28 hallucinations, and suicidality.  Such individuals are at increased risk of attempting to \n[1144098-2]    69 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page72 of 137\n \n1 commit suicide.  They are also at heightened risk of failing to respond to medications once \n2 they are restarted. \n3 187.  Defendants fail to identify and initiate adequate mental health treatment via \n4 the Jail’s intake process.  As a result, prisoners arriving at the Jail with mental health needs \n5 are at a significant risk of serious harm.  For example, Plaintiff MURPHY was booked into \n6 the Jail on January 18, 2013.  Both his Intake Health Screening Form (completed by \n7 custody staff) and his Intake Triage Assessment form (completed by medical staff of \n8 CFMG) indicated that he self-reported mental health problems.  Moreover, medical \n9 records in CFMG’s possession from a prior term that Plaintiff MURPHY had spent in the \n10 Jail indicated the Plaintiff MURPHY suffered from mental illness and had received \n11 psychiatric medications.  Despite this information, no mental health care staff met with \n12 Plaintiff MURPHY until January 21, 2013, at which point he had an appointment with a \n13 Licensed Psychiatric Technician who lacked authority to prescribe treatment or \n14 medication.  On January 21 and 22, Plaintiff MURPHY submitted sick call slips stating, \n15 among other things, “need psych meds – seeing and hearing things” and “need psych meds \n16 or psych hospital, Attn: head psych please.”  On January 24, 2013, he submitted another \n17 sick call slip, this one addressed to Dr. Fithian, stating “I take varies physch medication ... \n18 for hearing voices and seeing demons coming out of the walls driving me crazy, can’t \n19 sleep or eat right at all.  Ive been trying to see a physch doctor, PLEASE help if possible.”  \n20 (Typographical errors and misspellings in original). \n21 188.  On another day on or around January 24, 2013, Plaintiff MURPHY \n22 submitted another sick call slip stating that the staff were “placing my life in serious \n23 danger and possible death after many attempts to receive my medications during and after \n24 intake.  I’m a disabled vet who served my country with honorable discharge and should not \n25 be treated like trash over a officers attitude.”  Despite these pleas for help, Plaintiff \n26 MURPHY was not seen by mental health care staff with authority to prescribe treatment \n27 until January 29, 2013.  Plaintiff MURPHY was only seen by a psychiatrist on that day \n28 because on January 28, 2013 he informed staff that he was hearing demonic voices that \n[1144098-2]    70 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page73 of 137\n \n1 were telling him to kill himself.  Consequently, Defendants placed Plaintiff MURPHY in a \n2 rubber room, from which he was not released until January 30, 2013.  Between the time \n3 that Plaintiff MURPHY was booked in the Jail and January 29, 2013, when a psychiatrist \n4 finally saw him and prescribed psychiatric medication, Plaintiff MURPHY was exposed to \n5 an extraordinary risk of harm and suffered extreme, unnecessary pain and mental anguish. \n6 189.  Plaintiff HUNTER arrived at the Jail on March 16, 2013, with psychiatric \n7 medications to treat her bipolar disorder, manic depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.  \n8 Plaintiff HUNTER also brought with her a hard copy of her medical history, which \n9 documents the medications she requires.  However, during the booking process, Plaintiff \n10 HUNTER’s psychiatric medications were confiscated, and she did not receive any of her \n11 needed psychiatric medications for at least three weeks, despite repeated requests and \n12 grievances asking for the medications.  She did not see any mental health care staff until \n13 March 19, 2013, and did not see any staff with the authority to prescribe psychiatric \n14 medications until March 21, 2013.  As a result of not receiving appropriate attention from \n15 mental health care staff, Plaintiff HUNTER ultimately did not begin to receive her \n16 prescribed medications until three weeks after being booked into the Jail; during that \n17 period, she suffered from unnecessary and avoidable pain and symptoms, including, but \n18 not limited to, nightmares, anxiety, panic attacks, and hallucinations for this three-week \n19 period. \n20 190.  Plaintiff GREIM was booked into the Jail on September 13, 2012.  He \n21 reported to custody staff that he had psychiatric problems, was bipolar, and took Remeron; \n22 the custody officer recorded this information on Plaintiff GREIM’s Intake Health \n23 Screening form.  The following day, September 14, 2012, Plaintiff GREIM reported to \n24 medical staff that he was bipolar and had been prescribed Remeron.  Plaintiff GREIM was \n25 not seen by any mental health care staff until September 17, 2012, even though during a \n26 previous term in the Jail in August 2012 he had been placed in a rubber room because he \n27 expressed suicidal thoughts to Jail staff.  Even after seeing this staff member, he was not \n28 provided with any medication for his serious mental health conditions.  As a result of the \n[1144098-2]    71 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page74 of 137\n \n1 lack of attention from mental health care staff during his booking into the Jail, Plaintiff \n2 GREIM was placed at an unreasonable risk of deterioration in his mental health. \n3 191.  Plaintiff GIST has been subjected to the detoxification treatment at least \n4 twice.  Plaintiff GIST was booked into the Jail on March 15, 2012.  She informed medical \n5 and custody staff that she was taking a number of psychotropic medications, including \n6 Risperidone, Fluoxetine, Benztropine, and Trazodone.  Four days later, on March 19, \n7 2012, her relatives brought those psychotropic medications to the Jail for her.  That same \n8 day, the Jail obtained pharmacy records that confirmed that she was prescribed the same \n9 medications.  On March 20, 2012, a psychologist at the Jail consulted with Dr. Fithian \n10 about whether Plaintiff GIST should be provided with her prescription medication.  \n11 Dr. Fithian instructed that “due to history of alcoholism, … we should hold off medicating \n12 her for now to allow her to detox from alcohol while in custody.”  On March 27, Plaintiff \n13 GIST was again seen by the psychologist.  In a progress note, the psychologist wrote that \n14 “[p]rior to seeing inmate, writer conferred with Dr. Fithian.  It was agreed that she is to \n15 remain medication free and clean and sober for 90 days.”  Similarly, when Plaintiff GIST \n16 was booked in the Jail in November 2012, despite Defendants’ knowledge of her mental \n17 health conditions and medications, medical staff again denied her the prescribed \n18 medications for 90 days.  Upon information and belief, there was no clinical justification \n19 for denying Plaintiff GIST psychotropic medications for 90 days because of a history of \n20 alcohol abuse.  Without her medications, Plaintiff GIST began experiencing auditory \n21 hallucinations, talking to herself, feeling increased depression, and having trouble \n22 organizing her thoughts, expressing herself, and focusing. \n23 192.  Plaintiff KEY has been subjected to the detoxification treatment on multiple \n24 occasions, even though Defendants themselves have an extensive medical record \n25 documenting his history of receiving psychotropic medications.  Defendants appear unable \n26 to review even their own files to determine whether psychiatric medications are indicated, \n27 as one progress note for a psychiatric consult states in the same note that “Mr. Key … has \n28 been seen in the past by Dr. Fithian [director of Defendant CFMG] and placed on \n[1144098-2]    72 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page75 of 137\n \n1 trazodone” and also states that Plaintiff KEY “has no history of any psychiatric \n2 medications.” \n3 193.  By custom and policy, there is poor coordination of care for prisoners with \n4 mental health needs.  Upon information and belief, neither medical nor corrections staff \n5 appropriately refer to mental health staff prisoners who exhibit symptoms of mental illness \n6 during encounters with medical and corrections staff.  As a result, prisoners who exhibit \n7 symptoms of mental illness are not timely treated.  Upon information and belief, by custom \n8 and policy, neither medical nor corrections staff is adequately trained to recognize signs \n9 and symptoms of mental illness, and to refer to mental health staff prisoners exhibiting \n10 such signs and symptoms.  Upon information and belief, medical and mental health care \n11 staff do not adequately coordinate their care of prisoners with co-existing medical and \n12 mental health conditions. \n13 194.  Upon information and belief, Defendants do not maintain any central list, \n14 electronic or otherwise, of prisoners with mental illness and the treatment they require.  \n15 Defendants do not maintain adequate information about prisoners’ mental health needs in \n16 the prisoners’ custody and/or medical files.  Moreover, upon information and belief, to the \n17 extent that Defendants maintain information about a prisoner’s mental health needs in any \n18 form, custody, medical, and clerical staff are not provided with access to the information in \n19 a manner that would timely and effectively inform them of a prisoner’s mental health \n20 concerns and treatment needs. \n21 195.  For example, one prisoner was noted to have “pressured speech” and a \n22 “paranoid” presentation when he was booked into the Jail on July 17, 2013.  During his \n23 incarceration, this prisoner filed several grievances that demonstrated paranoid and \n24 possibly delusional thinking, which received only cursory responses from custody staff.  \n25 This prisoner also had to be removed from at least one medical appointment due to \n26 aggressive and abusive behavior.  Nevertheless, a psychiatric consult note in the prisoner’s \n27 filed dated August 9, 2013, states that he was on no psychiatric medications and that his \n28 “mental status is perfectly clear.”  This note does not appear to take into account any \n[1144098-2]    73 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page76 of 137\n \n1 information about this prisoner’s mental state that is present elsewhere in his medical and \n2 custody records. \n3 196.  One prisoner waited nearly three months after entering the Jail for an \n4 appointment with the Jail’s psychiatrist even though she had a significant history of mental \n5 health crises, including episodes of self-harm and suicidal ideation, during prior \n6 incarcerations at the Jail.  Although this prisoner had asked for medication at her first \n7 screening appointment on the day after her arrival, Dr. Fithian denied her medication when \n8 he saw her three months after her arrival because she was pregnant and without evident \n9 regard for the severity of this prisoner’s mental health symptoms.  Upon information and \n10 belief, no effort was made to consult with this prisoner’s obstetrician to determine whether \n11 any appropriate psychotropic medications could be prescribed. \n12 197.  Plaintiff WHITFIELD, who was forced to spend almost all of his time in bed \n13 for the first two months of his incarceration after the Jail failed to provide him with \n14 Provigil to treat his narcolepsy, requested treatment for depression and anxiety via sick call \n15 slips submitted on January 26 and 27, 2014.  Plaintiff WHITFIELD has previously been \n16 treated—both inside and outside the Jail—for depression and has attempted suicide in the \n17 past.  Spending upwards of 20 hours a day in bed had a deleterious effect on Plaintiff \n18 WHITFIELD’s mental health, but upon information and belief, medical and mental health \n19 care staff failed to coordinate their care of Plaintiff WHITFIELD to ensure that his co-\n20 existing medical and mental health conditions were adequately treated.  A psychiatrist \n21 came to see him, but only to inform him that the Jail would do nothing to treat his \n22 depression or anxiety. \n23 198.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental \n24 health staff in how to track and monitor prisoners with mental illness and the treatment \n25 they require. \n26 B.  Defendants Fail to Ensure That Prisoners Raising Mental Health \nComplaints Are Timely Seen and Adequately Treated \n27  \n28 199.  As discussed in Section II.E, the sick call process does not provide prisoners \n[1144098-2]    74 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page77 of 137\n \n1 with a timely and effective means for requesting medical care.  Prisoners must use the \n2 same inadequate sick call process to request mental health care services, and are thus \n3 placed at risk of harm.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to ensure that \n4 requests for mental health care reach mental health care staff in a timely manner, if at all.  \n5 Upon information and belief, there is no policy in place to ensure that requests for mental \n6 health care are forwarded to mental health care staff.  As a result, prisoners with serious \n7 mental health complaints are not timely seen or adequately treated. \n8 C.  Defendants Fail to Timely Identify, Adequately Treat, or Effectively \nTrack and Supervise Prisoners at Risk for Suicide \n9  \n10 200.  Defendants fail to identify, treat, track, and supervise prisoners who are at \n11 risk for suicide.  Defendants’ policies and practices for screening, supervising, and treating \n12 prisoners at risk for suicide are inadequate.  These shortcomings in the suicide prevention \n13 and treatment program have had tragic consequences.  Over the past four years, there have \n14 been three completed and more than a dozen attempted suicides.  The rate of completed \n15 suicides at the Jail is nearly twice the national average for jail facilities. \n16 201.  The very design of the Jail itself presents a risk to suicidal prisoners.  As \n17 noted in the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment, “The older design of the cells and dormitories \n18 constructed prior to 1993 does not meet today’s minimum standards for detention \n19 facilities.  Examples include:  Suicide hazard elimination is not as stringent as it should be \n20 to prevent self-harm and the attendant liability.”  2011 Assessment at Ex. 3. \n21 202.  Upon information and belief, Defendants do not adequately train custody \n22 staff to identify prisoners who are at risk of suicide and respond adequately to prisoners \n23 who are exhibiting suicidal tendencies.  This is especially problematic because custody \n24 staff, both during the intake process and for the duration of a prisoner’s time in the Jail, \n25 have the primary responsibility for alerting mental health staff when a prisoner is suicidal. \n26 203.  Defendants routinely fail to identify and track prisoners who are at risk for \n27 suicide.  For example, a prisoner named Joshua Claypole was suicidal when he arrived at \n28 the Jail on May 1, 2013, and his attorney asked Jail staff to place Mr. Claypole on suicide \n[1144098-2]    75 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page78 of 137\n \n1 watch on the day of his arrest.  Mr. Claypole was initially placed on suicide watch, but was \n2 soon taken off and cleared to go into the Jail’s general population.  He was then housed in \n3 a single cell, and, upon information and belief, did not receive any increased monitoring or \n4 effective treatment.  On May 4, 2013, Mr. Claypole attempted suicide by hanging in his \n5 cell, and was air-lifted to a San Jose hospital where he was placed on life support.  Five \n6 days later, he was taken off life support and died. \n7 204.  A prisoner named Daniel Lariviere committed suicide on July 8, 2011.  Upon \n8 his arrest, he was initially placed in a rubber room, but after a few hours he was released to \n9 a booking cell without having been evaluated by any mental health care staff.  \n10 Mr. Lariviere informed custody and medical staff during the intake process that he had \n11 serious mental health issues, was having auditory hallucinations, and had been released \n12 from a psychiatric hospital just four days earlier.  Despite these numerous indicia of \n13 suicide risk, Defendants decided to house Mr. Lariviere in an administrative segregation \n14 unit.  The conditions in this segregation unit place prisoners at increased risk of suicide.  \n15 Defendants also did not schedule Mr. Lariviere to see any mental health care staff at the \n16 Jail until three days after his booking.  On the morning of the day he was supposed to be \n17 seen by mental health care staff, Mr. Lariviere committed suicide by hanging in his cell. \n18 205.  Another prisoner had attempted suicide at least twice before his incarceration \n19 and spent 6-8 months at Atascadero State Hospital, a state inpatient psychiatric hospital, \n20 before coming to the Jail.  Despite this prisoner’s attempted suicide and mental health \n21 history, about which Defendants were well aware, the Jail failed to identify him as at risk \n22 for suicide and failed to take steps to safely house, track, and treat him to reduce the risk of \n23 suicide.  This prisoner attempted suicide by jumping off the second floor of the housing \n24 pod, and had to be airlifted to Santa Clara Hospital, where he was treated for trauma to his \n25 head and broken ribs. \n26 206.  Defendants routinely house suicidal and seriously mentally ill prisoners in \n27 conditions that result in further deterioration of their mental health, that violate notions of \n28 minimally adequate mental health care and basic human dignity, and that are incompatible \n[1144098-2]    76 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page79 of 137\n \n1 with civilized standards of humanity and decency.  Defendants’ policies and practices for \n2 housing suicidal prisoners are inadequate.  Rather than individually determining the most \n3 integrated environment in which a suicidal prisoner can be safely housed, Defendants have \n4 a policy and practice of placing prisoners with serious mental health concerns in the \n5 “rubber rooms.”  The rubber rooms are single cells with no furnishings, toilets, or (in most \n6 cases) windows for outside light.  The only features of the cell are the door, which has a \n7 slot through which food can be delivered, and a grate in the floor that serves as the toilet \n8 for feces and urine.  When housing a prisoner in a rubber room, Defendants routinely \n9 remove all of the prisoner’s clothing, leaving the prisoner naked in the room.  In some \n10 instances, Defendants permit a prisoner to have a tear-proof smock for clothing and \n11 nothing else.  There is no mattress or pad, let alone a bed, in any of the rubber rooms for \n12 prisoners to sit or sleep on.  Prisoners are thus forced to sit, sleep, and eat on the same \n13 cold, dirty floor in which the grate for the toilet is located.  Upon information and belief, \n14 when prisoners act out in rubber rooms, Jail staff place them in restraints, including in \n15 restraint chairs.  However, upon information and belief, Defendants fail to properly use \n16 restraints on mentally ill prisoners or adequately monitor restrained prisoners.  Defendants’ \n17 improper use of restraints and seclusion places seriously mentally ill prisoners at an \n18 unreasonable risk of harm. \n19 207.  For example, in May 2012, a prisoner was placed in a rubber room because \n20 he had been kicking his cell door, yelling and screaming.  While serving the afternoon \n21 meal, a deputy noticed the prisoner was bleeding from the head in his safety cell.  While \n22 removing the prisoner from the safety cell, the prisoner was placed in a safety chair which \n23 was inoperative.  As deputies moved him to an operative safety chair, the prisoner was \n24 able to throw himself to the ground head first, and had to be transported to the emergency \n25 room. \n26 208.  The rubber rooms are rarely cleaned when a prisoner is being housed in one \n27 of the cells and are not cleaned sufficiently once a prisoner is released from the cell.  The \n28 walls and floor of the rubber rooms are soiled by feces because of the inadequate toilet and \n[1144098-2]    77 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page80 of 137\n \n1 non-existent sink.  These conditions are traumatic for all prisoners, but especially for those \n2 who are already experiencing mental health symptoms.  Voluminous psychiatric literature \n3 spanning nearly two hundred years has documented the adverse mental health effects of \n4 isolation, particularly on the mentally ill, and Monterey County Jail prisoners are no \n5 exception.  Moreover, suicidal prisoners may perceive the rubber rooms as a method of \n6 punishment (as opposed to treatment), which may dissuade them from self-identifying as \n7 suicidal. \n8 209.  Plaintiff MEFFORD has been placed on suicide watch and put in a rubber \n9 room at least five separate times since entering the Jail after engaging in self-harming \n10 behavior.  Plaintiff MEFFORD was able to continue engaging in self-harming behavior \n11 inside the rubber room, by banging his head repeatedly against the door until he was \n12 bleeding.  Custody staff’s only response to these episodes of self-mutilation has been to \n13 place Plaintiff MEFFORD in a restraint chair.  Plaintiff MEFFORD was able to free \n14 himself from the restraint chair at least once, and began again hurting himself.  Each time, \n15 he has been placed in a rubber room for varying lengths of time.  Custody staff has \n16 routinely failed to conduct safety checks twice every thirty minutes as required by the \n17 Jail’s own policies.  The Jail has also failed to provide him with adequate food and water \n18 during these periods of time. \n19 210.  Plaintiff MEFFORD has informed the Jail medical and custody staff \n20 repeatedly that sensory deprivation and particularly a lack of light make his anxiety and \n21 other psychiatric conditions much worse.  He has also stated a reluctance to express his \n22 true level of suicidality to staff because of fear of being placed in a rubber room.  Despite \n23 this, custody staff continues to place him in rubber rooms. \n24 211.  Defendants placed Plaintiff MURPHY in a rubber room at least five times \n25 between January 2013 and October 31, 2013.  When Plaintiff MURPHY was placed in a \n26 rubber room, the conditions were horrific, with feces on the walls and floor of the room.  \n27 Defendants stripped Plaintiff MURPHY naked, provided him only with a safety smock, \n28 and forced him to eat and sleep on the same floor where the toilet grate is located.  In \n[1144098-2]    78 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page81 of 137\n \n1 January 2013, during the more than 38 hours for which he was in the rubber room, \n2 Defendants’ own documents show that they did not provide Plaintiff MURPHY a single \n3 meal and only offered him water on three occasions. \n4 212.  Defendants exacerbate the psychological trauma experienced by seriously \n5 mentally ill prisoners who are housed in rubber rooms by failing to provide them with \n6 necessary mental health care.  These prisoners do not receive sufficient contact with \n7 mental health providers (if they receive mental health care at all).  And, the harsh \n8 conditions of their confinement render less effective the minimal treatment they do \n9 receive.  As a result, there is an unreasonable risk that their symptoms, including \n10 suicidality, will escalate and Defendants may force them to stay in the rubber rooms even \n11 longer. \n12 213.  For example, in January 2012, one prisoner woke up screaming from a \n13 nightmare, and was sent to the rubber room.  She was given a filthy blanket, and forced to \n14 use a bathroom consisting of a grate in the floor as she was simultaneously vomiting green \n15 bile.  During her time in the rubber room, the mental health staff did not visit this prisoner \n16 or provide her with any mental health treatment, aside from asking her if she was suicidal.  \n17 Upon information and belief, during the time she was in the rubber room, all of the \n18 prisoner’s interactions with mental health care staff took place at the cell front door; none \n19 of the interactions were face to face without barriers.  While Defendants may consider \n20 rubber rooms “safe” for suicidal and seriously mentally ill prisoners, in fact the rubber \n21 rooms lack any therapeutic value, and certainly do not replace the need for psychiatric \n22 hospitalization and treatment. \n23 214.  Defendants fail to sufficiently observe prisoners who have been identified as \n24 being at risk of suicide, including prisoners who have been placed in rubber rooms.  \n25 Specifically, Defendants lack any policy or procedure for, and therefore fail to provide, \n26 constant observation of prisoners who are actively suicidal, either threatening to or \n27 engaging in the act of suicide. \n28 215.  Defendants fail to ensure by policy and practice that mental health care staff \n[1144098-2]    79 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page82 of 137\n \n1 are consulted prior to placing a prisoner in a rubber room and before a prisoner is released \n2 from a rubber room.  Upon information and belief, by not adequately involving mental \n3 health care staff in the decision to put prisoners in a rubber room, Defendants overuse the \n4 rubber rooms and place prisoners who do not require exposure to the punitive conditions of \n5 the rubber rooms to those conditions.  Upon information and belief, by not adequately \n6 involving mental health care staff in the decision to release prisoners from rubber rooms, \n7 Defendants increase the risk that a prisoner who still requires enhanced monitoring will be \n8 placed back into housing conditions where they are not monitored as closely and are more \n9 able to engage in self-harm. \n10 216.  Defendants fail to adequately follow up with, monitor, and treat prisoners \n11 who have been released from the rubber room.  For example, Plaintiff MURPHY was \n12 placed in a rubber room on February 11, 2013, at approximately 4 p.m. and was released at \n13 5 a.m. the following day.  No health care staff conducted any evaluation of Plaintiff \n14 MURPHY’s physical or mental status until February 18, 2013.  In fact, the psychiatric \n15 progress note for his February 18, 2013 appointment with Dr. Fithian does not even \n16 acknowledge that Plaintiff MURPHY had been placed in a rubber room.  Another prisoner \n17 was kept in the rubber room for five full days, and described feeling as though the walls \n18 were closing in on him the entire time.  After he was released from the rubber room, this \n19 prisoner did not receive adequate follow-up to evaluate his mental health state and risk of \n20 suicidality. \n21 217.  Defendants have knowledge of the substantial risk of harm caused by \n22 inadequate suicide prevention and treatment policies and practices in the Jail, but have \n23 failed to take steps to prevent, or even to diminish, the harmful effects of these unlawful \n24 policies and practices.  Defendants are thus deliberately indifferent to the risk of harm to \n25 prisoners created by their failure to operate a constitutionally adequate suicide prevention \n26 and treatment program. \n27\n28\n[1144098-2]    80 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page83 of 137\n \n1 D.  Defendants Lack Sufficient Facilities to Provide Adequate Mental \nHealth Care \n2  \n3 218.  The outdated facility and overcrowding at the Jail only exacerbate the \n4 inadequate mental health conditions and treatment at the Jail.  As the 2011 Jail Needs \n5 Assessment found, “Medical/mental health treatment spaces are not adequate for the rated \n6 beds, let alone the actual number of inmates held….  Overcrowding forces the entire \n7 facility to operate as an indirect supervision facility.  Mental health issues are considerably \n8 more difficult to recognize, manage and treat in an indirect supervision facility.”  2011 \n9 Assessment at Ex. 3.  The Assessment further noted the direct impact of overcrowding on \n10 prisoners’ mental health conditions:  “Overcrowding affects inmates’ mental and physical \n11 health by increasing the level of uncertainty with which they regularly cope.”  2011 \n12 Assessment at Ex. 9.  The lack of sufficient treatment space places prisoners at an \n13 unreasonable risk of harm from inadequate mental health care.  Inadequate mental health \n14 offices and treatment spaces compromise the delivery of mental health care, and fail to \n15 address the confidentiality and safety concerns that arise in delivery of such care.  \n16 Defendants have not sufficiently eliminated suicide hazards through the Jail. \n17 219.  Plaintiff MEFFORD, who has serious mental health conditions that require \n18 significant and sustained psychiatric care, was seen by a psychiatrist at his cell in G-Pod.  \n19 Plaintiff MEFFORD was forced to share private and personal information about himself \n20 and his condition publically through the tray slot in his cell door, while the psychiatrist \n21 stayed in the public hallway, allowing any prisoner or custody staff member who might \n22 have been close by to overhear their conversation. \n23 220.  Plaintiff AGUILAR suffers from depression and anxiety and has trouble \n24 sleeping.  In the Jail, he saw a psychiatrist who referred him to a therapist.  The therapist \n25 came to speak with Plaintiff AGUILAR, but in the presence of a custody officer and not in \n26 a confidential treatment space.  The therapist told Plaintiff AGUILAR to put in a sick call \n27 slip to see her another time so they could talk alone.  He put in a sick call slip to do so, but \n28 was not seen in response to the sick call slip. \n[1144098-2]    81 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page84 of 137\n \n1 E.  Defendants’ Mental Health Treatment Program Involves Little More \nthan Segregation and Supervision \n2  \n3 221.  Defendants provide little to no individual or group treatment to prisoners \n4 with mental health problems, even for prisoners who are acutely or chronically mentally \n5 ill.  Therapy in an individual or group setting is almost never offered or provided to \n6 prisoners, regardless of whether prisoners were receiving therapy as a part of their \n7 treatment for mental illness outside of the Jail. \n8 222.  For acutely and chronically mentally ill prisoners, the standard of care \n9 includes, and they should be provided with, psychosocial rehabilitation services, which \n10 include structured out-of-cell programming that addresses their symptoms of mental \n11 illness, reduces their isolation, and promotes compliance with treatment and medications.  \n12 Without this care, seriously mentally ill prisoners are at an unreasonable risk of \n13 decompensating and of not responding fully to the treatment they do receive.  This \n14 deterioration can take many damaging forms, including increased symptoms and non-\n15 adherence to treatment.  Defendants fail to provide adequate psychosocial rehabilitation \n16 services to seriously mentally ill prisoners in need of this care. \n17 223.  Defendants house prisoners with some of the most serious mental health \n18 problems in A and B Pods for men and in R and S pods for women.  A, B, R, and S Pods \n19 are administrative segregation units.  Defendants offer group therapy to prisoners in these \n20 pods once every other week for one hour.  That amount of structured out of cell time falls \n21 far below the standard of care, and thus places prisoners at substantial risk of serious harm. \n22 224.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to train staff regarding when \n23 and how to provide therapy to prisoners with mental illness as a component of mental \n24 health care. \n25 225.  Plaintiff MURPHY had been seeing an outside psychiatrist who provided \n26 him with therapy, but the Jail failed to transport him to his April 2013 appointment with \n27 his outside psychiatrist.  On information and belief, he repeatedly missed appointments \n28 with his outside psychiatrist due to errors on the part of Jail staff.  Defendants informed \n[1144098-2]    82 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page85 of 137\n \n1 Plaintiff MURPHY that the provider will no longer see him, but appear to have made no \n2 attempt to provide Plaintiff MURPHY with therapy or to arrange that a different outside \n3 psychiatrist provide Plaintiff MURPHY with therapy.  As a result of the total lack of \n4 therapy, at least as of October 31, 2013, Plaintiff MURPHY was not receiving adequate \n5 mental health care. \n6 226.  Plaintiff HUNTER suffered from anxiety and panic attacks that were \n7 exacerbated when she was in the overcrowded Jail environment, but she was denied \n8 therapy sessions during her time at the Jail.  Another prisoner, who had attempted suicide \n9 twice prior to his arrival at the Jail and once while at the Jail in December 2012, did not \n10 receive one-on-one therapy sessions, but rather only medications (provided by nurses to \n11 the prisoner in his isolation cell). \n12 F.  Defendants Do Not Adequately Prescribe, Monitor, and Evaluate the \nProvision of Psychotropic Medications \n13  \n14 227.  Defendants routinely fail to provide medically necessary psychotropic \n15 medications to prisoners with psychiatric illnesses.  Defendants’ policies and practices for \n16 providing psychotropic medications to prisoners are inadequate.  Upon information and \n17 belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental health staff in the proper administration \n18 of psychotropic medications.  Defendants fail to provide psychotropic medications even \n19 when provided with valid prescriptions from the California Department of Mental Health, \n20 community providers, or family members.  Especially during the first 90 days of \n21 incarceration, prisoners are at risk of being labeled by medical staff as drug seekers and \n22 malingerers, and those labels are then used to deny needed medications. \n23 228.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to evaluate prisoners before \n24 making treatment decisions, including whether to prescribe psychotropic medications.  \n25 Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental health staff \n26 regarding how to appropriately evaluate prisoners before making mental health treatment \n27 decisions. \n28 229.  As is discussed in Paragraph 187, supra, Plaintiff GIST has been denied \n[1144098-2]    83 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page86 of 137\n \n1 access to her prescribed antipsychotics, antidepressants, and sleep aids for up to 90 days \n2 when booked into the Jail.  During these prolonged periods without her medication, \n3 Plaintiff GIST’s mental health deteriorates.  She hears voices, talks constantly to herself, \n4 has trouble organizing her thoughts and expressing herself, gets easily distracted and \n5 experiences depression.  The back and forth of being on her medications on the outside and \n6 then abruptly off them for a long period in custody is further damaging to her long-term \n7 mental health and well-being. \n8 230.  Plaintiff KEY has experienced many different incarcerations at the Jail.  He \n9 has repeatedly been subjected to Defendants’ detoxification treatment during which he is \n10 denied all medications for 90 days.  One psychiatric progress note in Plaintiff KEY’s file \n11 offers this rationale for denying Plaintiff KEY psychiatric medications upon which he has \n12 depended for many years:  “I was not going to put him on medication until he had been \n13 clean and sober for a while.”  After that initial 3-month period of denial, which each time \n14 causes Plaintiff KEY to suffer auditory hallucinations, severe depression, and other serious \n15 mental health problems, Defendants have repeatedly failed to provide Plaintiff KEY with \n16 appropriate psychiatric medications—even with the same psychiatric medications that they \n17 have previously provided him. \n18 231.  One pregnant prisoner was denied psychotropic medication because of her \n19 pregnancy, with the notation made that she could discuss the issue with her obstetrician at \n20 an appointment scheduled for a month after Defendants denied her medication. \n21 232.  As a result of Defendants’ failure to provide medically necessary \n22 psychotropic medications, prisoners with mental illness suffer from the following:  \n23 (1) withdrawal symptoms when the medications they were prescribed before admission to \n24 the Jail are abruptly terminated; (2) recurrence of debilitating symptoms such as \n25 hallucinations and suicidality; and (3) in some cases, decompensation to the point of being \n26 found incompetent to stand trial and/or being sent to the state hospital until they are stable \n27 enough to return to the Jail.  In addition, pursuant to what is known as the “kindling \n28 phenomenon,” interruptions in prisoners’ psychotropic medications can cause a prisoners’ \n[1144098-2]    84 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page87 of 137\n \n1 underlying mental illness to worsen.  This not only worsens the underlying condition, but \n2 makes it more difficult to treat the underlying condition. \n3 233.  Upon information and belief, Defendants lack adequate policies and \n4 practices for monitoring and treating the side effects or efficacy of psychotropic \n5 medications and their effect upon prisoners with mental health issues.  Upon information \n6 and belief, Defendants also fail to order diagnostic tests necessary to measure the efficacy \n7 of medications, as well as potential side and adverse effects, and fail to prescribe \n8 medications to address potential side and adverse effects of psychotropic medications.  \n9 These adverse effects include extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which are involuntary and \n10 often painful movements of the limbs and muscles, including tardive dyskinesia, a \n11 potentially permanent disabling condition.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to \n12 track, monitor, and treat prisoners prescribed psychotropic medications for dangerous and \n13 potentially fatal drug interactions. \n14 234.  For example, Plaintiff MURPHY is taking a number of psychiatric \n15 medications to address his auditory and visual hallucinations.  However, during his time in \n16 the Jail, he has not received the correct dosages of the medications, and has continued to \n17 see shadows and hear voices.  The hallucinations have been so frequent and intense that he \n18 was unable to sleep more than a few hours at night.  Despite his repeated requests, mental \n19 health staff did not adjust his dosages or otherwise follow up with him to evaluate the \n20 efficacy of the medications. \n21 235.  Defendants have, without adequate justification, refused to provide Plaintiff \n22 GIST with the same psychotropic medication regimen she was taking pursuant to \n23 prescription immediately prior to her arrest.  Plaintiff GIST’s medication regimen \n24 consisted of four drugs.  During her current term in the Jail, Defendants have only \n25 provided her with two of the four drugs at any given time.  As a result, she has experienced \n26 auditory hallucinations, significant trouble sleeping, and mood instability. \n27 236.  Plaintiff MEFFORD has received a variety of medication during his \n28 incarceration without effective follow up or measurement of its efficacy.  Instead, mental \n[1144098-2]    85 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page88 of 137\n \n1 health care staff have changed his prescriptions without seeing him and/or without \n2 providing adequate clinical explanations for the change.  Plaintiff MEFFORD has suffered, \n3 and continues to suffer, from serious psychiatric conditions that remain undertreated and \n4 under-evaluated. \n5 237.  Plaintiff MEFFORD has also at least twice complained about serious side \n6 effects from his psychotropic medication.  On February 24, 2014, Plaintiff MEFFORD \n7 complained to a psychiatrist at the Jail that valporic acid—a drug prescribed for Plaintiff \n8 MEFFORD in lieu of Depakote, which Plaintiff MEFFORD received in prison—was \n9 upsetting his stomach sufficiently that he wished to try an alternative treatment.  The \n10 psychiatrist began providing Plaintiff MEFFORD with Tegretol.  Tegretol caused Plaintiff \n11 MEFFORD to experience blurred vision, confusion, headaches, as well as an upset \n12 stomach.  In response to Plaintiff MEFFORD’s report of these side effects, the psychiatrist \n13 merely switched his medication back to valporic acid, instead of the better tolerated \n14 Depakote. \n15 238.  Defendants also lack adequate policies and practices for ensuring the \n16 continuity of administration of psychotropic medications for prisoners transferred to \n17 Alameda County pursuant to the contract between MONTEREY COUNTY and Alameda \n18 County, discussed in Paragraph 178, supra.  After late-July 2013 when Plaintiff GREIM \n19 was transferred to the physical custody of Alameda County, doctors there prescribed two \n20 psychiatric medications to Plaintiff GREIM, which he received and took until he was \n21 returned to Monterey County Jail on or around September 6, 2013.  Plaintiff GREIM \n22 received these two medications for the first three nights after he was returned to Monterey \n23 County Jail.  On or around September 9, 2013, he was seen by a female staff member of \n24 Defendant CFMG who discontinued both of the medications.  The staff member informed \n25 Plaintiff GREIM that he would not receive any psychiatric medications because he had not \n26 received medication when he was at Monterey County Jail before being transferred to \n27 Alameda County.  Plaintiff GREIM experienced increased depression, anxiety, anger, and \n28 racing thoughts as a result of being removed from the medications he had been taking in \n[1144098-2]    86 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page89 of 137\n \n1 Alameda County. \n2 239.  Upon information and belief, Defendants routinely release prisoners with \n3 serious mental health conditions from the Jail without providing them with any services to \n4 ensure that their mental health care is not disrupted.  Defendants’ policies and practices for \n5 the provision of continuing mental health care services upon a prisoner’s release are \n6 inadequate.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody and \n7 mental health staff in how to appropriately release prisoners with serious mental health \n8 concerns so that such prisoners can continue their mental health care.  Upon information \n9 and belief, for those prisoners who are prescribed psychiatric medications in the Jail, they \n10 are released without either a supply of, or a prescription for them to fill, those medications \n11 at a community pharmacy.  Defendants do not schedule follow-up appointments in the \n12 community, nor are prisoners provided with sufficient referrals or information about where \n13 they may receive mental health care services or medications. \n14 240.  Upon information and belief, Defendants lack any comprehensive system for \n15 monitoring the prescription, distribution, efficacy, and side effects of psychotropic \n16 medication and for ensuring continuity of care for prisoners with mental illness before, \n17 during, and after their incarceration at the Jail. \n18 G.  Defendants Fail to Transfer Prisoners to Facilities That Provide Higher \nLevels of Mental Health Care When Necessary \n19  \n20 241.  Upon information and belief, Defendants routinely fail, when necessary, to \n21 transfer prisoners who require inpatient care to outside facilities that provide such care.  \n22 Defendants’ policies and practices transferring prisoners to outside facilities that provide \n23 inpatient care are inadequate.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately \n24 train custody and mental health staff regarding how to, when necessary, transfer prisoners \n25 to facilities that provide inpatient mental health care. \n26 242.   Prisoners in the Jail may require care at an inpatient facility in a variety of \n27 circumstances, including, but not limited to, when they are in acute mental health crisis or \n28 if they have been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.  Upon information and belief, \n[1144098-2]    87 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page90 of 137\n \n1 Monterey County Jail is not a facility licensed to provide inpatient mental health care \n2 treatment to any individuals, and the Jail does not provide an inpatient level of care. \n3 243.  Upon information and belief, Defendants lack adequate policies and \n4 procedures regarding when to transfer prisoners who require inpatient care to outside \n5 medical facilities that provide higher levels of care. \n6 244.  Upon information and belief, when Defendants identify or are ordered by the \n7 Superior Court to transfer prisoners to outside facilities that provide inpatient level of care, \n8 there are frequently delays in transferring these prisoners from Monterey County Jail.  The \n9 delays result in prisoners being denied needed inpatient care, which could result in further \n10 deterioration in their mental health, and creates a risk to the long-term prognosis of these \n11 patients: the longer the inpatient care is denied to the patients in need of that level of care, \n12 the less likely they are to respond to appropriate treatment once it is initiated. \n13 245.  For example, in April 2013, Dr. Fithian recommended that a pretrial detainee \n14 in the Jail be found incompetent to stand trial because of her mental health status.  The \n15 Superior Court judge ordered her to be placed in a competency program in the state \n16 hospital to receive inpatient care.  Until at least October 11, 2013, the prisoner had not \n17 been transferred to the state hospital and remained at the Jail. \n18 H.  Defendants Place Prisoners with Mental Illness at Risk by Housing \nThem in Restrictive Administrative Segregation Units Without \n19 Adequate Supervision \n20 246.  Defendants house prisoners with mental illness in administrative segregation \n21 units in the Jail in ways that place such prisoners at substantial risk of serious harm.  In the \n22 Jail, A through D Pods, G through J Pod, and R and S Pods are administrative segregation \n23 units.  All of the beds in these units are located in locked cells.  Collectively, \n24 approximately 200 prisoners are housed in administrative segregation units at any given \n25 time. \n26 247.  The conditions in the administrative segregation units are extremely punitive, \n27 isolating, and restrictive.  Upon information and belief, Defendants permit prisoners in \n28 administrative segregation to have only one hour of out-of-cell time per day.  During that \n[1144098-2]    88 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page91 of 137\n \n1 hour, prisoners are expected to shower, exercise, and use the telephone.  Prisoners are \n2 generally released from their cells individually, meaning they are outside of their cells by \n3 themselves.  As a result, there are very few opportunities for human interaction. \n4 248.  These conditions significantly increase the risk that prisoners with mental \n5 illness will have their condition decompensate when placed in administrative segregation.  \n6 A significantly disproportionate percentage of suicides occur in administrative segregation \n7 units.  Because of the risks posed by administrative segregation to prisoners with mental \n8 illness, a consensus has been reached in mental health correctional communities that \n9 prisoners with mental illness should only be placed in administrative segregation if \n10 absolutely necessary.  In addition, if prisoners with mental illness are placed in \n11 administrative segregation, there must be limits on the amount of time they remain in such \n12 units, they must be monitored closely, and they must be provided with significant \n13 structured and unstructured out-of-cell time. \n14 249.  Upon information and belief, Defendants do not have adequate safeguards in \n15 place to ensure that prisoners with mental illness are only placed in administrative \n16 segregation when absolutely necessary.  In fact, upon information and belief, Defendants \n17 have a policy and practice of placing prisoners with the most serious mental illness in A \n18 and B Pods for men and R and S Pods for women.  As a result, rather than only placing \n19 prisoners with mental illness in administrative segregation when absolutely necessary, \n20 Defendants have a policy and practice of placing mentally ill prisoners there because of \n21 their mental illness.  Upon information and belief, Defendants also lack policies and \n22 practices to reevaluate whether prisoners with mental illness placed in administrative \n23 segregation should remain in administrative segregation.  The amount of unstructured out-\n24 of-cell time that Defendants provide to prisoners in administrative segregation—a \n25 maximum of seven hours per week—falls far below the standard of care.  The amount of \n26 structured out-of-cell time provided to prisoners in administrative segregation—at most \n27 one hour every other week—falls even farther below the standard of care. \n28 250.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have a policy of conducting safety \n[1144098-2]    89 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page92 of 137\n \n1 checks once every hour in administrative segregation units.  Upon information and belief, \n2 Defendants do not conduct safety checks at intermittent and unpredictable times.  \n3 Defendants’ policy for conducting safety checks is inadequate to ensure the safety of \n4 prisoners with serious mental illness in administrative segregation.  Upon information and \n5 belief, Defendants sometimes even fail to conduct safety checks in administrative \n6 segregation units once per hour according to their inadequate policy.  As a result, \n7 Defendants’ policy and practice for conducting safety checks of prisoners in administrative \n8 segregation place prisoners at a substantial risk of serious harm. \n9 251.  Plaintiff MEFFORD has been housed in administrative segregation or in a \n10 safety cell since arriving at the Jail.  He has repeatedly informed custody and medical staff, \n11 both orally and through a formal grievance, that the sensory deprivation caused by this \n12 housing assignment is making his psychiatric conditions much worse and causing him \n13 considerable anxiety.  The Jail has not responded to his repeated requests for \n14 accommodation or alternative housing. \n15 252.  Defendants placed Plaintiff MURPHY in an isolation cell at least one time \n16 for a period of 10 days in April 2013.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiff MURPHY’s \n17 mental health decompensated during his time in isolation, at least in part because of his \n18 inability to talk with anyone else. \n19 253.  Jessie Crow and Daniel Lariviere committed suicide by hanging in \n20 administrative segregation in 2010 and 2011 respectively.  Defendants’ inadequate policies \n21 and procedures for monitoring prisoners with mental illness in administrative segregation \n22 units placed both Mr. Crow and Mr. Lariviere at risk prior to their suicides and may have \n23 contributed to their suicides.  For example, if Defendants had conducted safety checks \n24 every half hour at intermittent and unpredictable times, they may have been able to prevent \n25 Mr. Crow or Mr. Lariviere from committing suicide. \n26 I.  Defendants Discriminate Against and Unfairly Punish Prisoners with \nMental Illness \n27  \n28 254.  Defendants discriminate against prisoners with serious mental illness by \n[1144098-2]    90 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page93 of 137\n \n1 isolating them from and denying them privileges granted to other prisoners.  Defendants’ \n2 policies and practices for housing prisoners with serious mental illness are inadequate.  \n3 Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental health staff in how \n4 to appropriately house prisoners with serious mental illness.  Prisoners with serious mental \n5 illness are frequently housed by Defendants in administrative segregation units, as opposed \n6 to in dorm housing units.  When housed in a cell, as opposed to dorm, prisoners have far \n7 less freedom to move around and to interact with other prisoners.  See Section III.H.  In \n8 contrast, prisoners in dorm housing units are free to access most areas of the dorm unit, \n9 including the common area, showers, telephones, and exercise yard during most of the day.  \n10 Prisoners with severe mental health concerns may also be housed by Defendants in \n11 isolation cells.  When housed in an isolation cell, prisoners have even less freedom to \n12 move around and interact with other prisoners, and they have extremely limited access to \n13 programs and services at the Jail.  Accordingly, prisoners with serious mental illnesses are \n14 denied access to programs and services because Defendants place prisoners with serious \n15 mental illness in lockdown units or isolation cells. \n16 255.  Upon information and belief, prisoners with serious mental health conditions \n17 may be placed in rubber rooms as punishment for an inability to follow Jail rules.  Many of \n18 these prisoners may not have violated Jail rules had they been receiving adequate mental \n19 health treatment. \n20 256.  Upon information and belief, Defendants place prisoners in a rubber room \n21 when they request mental health care from Defendants.  For example, in late-Spring or \n22 early-Summer 2012, one prisoner was suffering from mental health symptoms because he \n23 had not been provided with prescribed medications for preexisting medical conditions.  \n24 Rather than attempt to treat his psychiatric distress, Defendants placed him naked in the \n25 rubber room without even a blanket for the first few hours.  A female prisoner who entered \n26 the Jail in a manic state was placed in a rubber room for a period of days without clothing, \n27 and was forced to tear her blanket to minimally cover herself. \n28 257.  Upon information and belief, Defendants exacerbate the psychological \n[1144098-2]    91 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page94 of 137\n \n1 trauma experienced by prisoners with serious mental health conditions who are housed in \n2 rubber rooms by failing to provide them with necessary mental health care.  These \n3 prisoners do not receive sufficient contact with mental health providers.  As a result, their \n4 nonconforming behaviors may escalate and they are forced to stay in the rubber room even \n5 longer. \n6 258.  Upon information and belief, Defendants’ disciplinary process fails to take \n7 into account behavior which results from inadequate mental health care.  Upon information \n8 and belief, as a result of Defendants’ failure to provide adequate mental health care, \n9 prisoners with serious mental conditions may be unable to conform to Jail rules or be \n10 safely housed in cells with other prisoners.  In response, rather than provide them with the \n11 medications or treatment they need, Defendants selectively house these prisoners in \n12 isolation in the rubber rooms. \n13 259.  When mental illness is inhibiting a prisoner’s ability to follow directions or \n14 interact with others, many incident reports show no effort by staff to involve mental health \n15 professionals who might be able to calm the prisoner down and address the underlying \n16 psychiatric issue without resorting to use of physical force.  Upon information and belief, \n17 staff who do not have adequate training regarding how to treat mental health issues attempt \n18 to interact with the prisoner on their own, and end up resorting to use of physical force, \n19 improper use of restraints, and/or violence to control the prisoners.  Sometimes, the use of \n20 force results in larger prisoner-on-prisoner fights in the unit. \n21 260.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to provide adequate training to \n22 custody staff regarding how to respond to mentally ill prisoners whose non-conforming \n23 behaviors are a product of their mental illness. \n24 261.  For example, Plaintiff MEFFORD received a Disciplinary Action Report on \n25 December 15, 2013, for yelling at a guard.  As punishment, Plaintiff MEFFORD lost four \n26 weeks of commissary, yard, and visiting privileges.  Plaintiff MEFFORD was then brought \n27 to a safety cell where he remained overnight on suicide watch.  After being released from \n28 the safety cell, Plaintiff MEFFORD appealed this Disciplinary Action Report on the \n[1144098-2]    92 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page95 of 137\n \n1 grounds that four weeks of punishment was too severe because his conduct had been \n2 caused by his mental illness.  Plaintiff MEFFORD noted that these punishments would \n3 “lead to me being very depressed and or suicidal and self harmful.”  Defendants denied \n4 Plaintiff MEFFORD’s appeal on January 2, 2014, because “in this facility we take serious \n5 [sic]” “threats against an officer…regardless of an inmate’s medical condition.” \n6 262.  Defendants fail to provide sign language interpretation services to prisoners \n7 whose primary language is American Sign Language during mental health clinical \n8 evaluations.  Without sign language interpretation, such prisoners are not able to explain to \n9 mental health staff the symptoms they are experiencing, and mental health staff are not \n10 able to explain the benefits and risks of treatments and medications such that prisoners can \n11 provide their informed consent.  The lack of sign language interpretation services results in \n12 Defendants making mental health treatment decisions without all of the necessary and \n13 pertinent information they need, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis and mistreatment \n14 for the prisoner. \n15 263.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to provide foreign language \n16 interpretation services to prisoners whose primary language is not English during mental \n17 health clinical evaluations.  This is particularly true for prisoners who cannot speak either \n18 English or Spanish.  Without foreign language interpretation, such prisoners are not able to \n19 explain to mental health staff the symptoms they are experiencing, and mental health staff \n20 are not able to explain the benefits and risks of treatments and medications such that \n21 prisoners can provide their informed consent.  The lack of foreign language interpretation \n22 services results in Defendants making mental health treatment decisions without all of the \n23 necessary and pertinent information they need, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis \n24 and mistreatment for the prisoner. \n25 J.  Defendants Fail to Employ a Sufficient Number of Properly Trained \nMental Health Professionals \n26  \n27 264.  Defendants fail to maintain sufficient numbers of mental health care \n28 professionals to provide minimally adequate care to the more than 900 prisoners in the Jail. \n[1144098-2]    93 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page96 of 137\n \n1 265.  The Jail’s low staffing levels result in mental health care staff being unable \n2 to timely respond to prisoners’ requests for psychiatric evaluations and treatment, to \n3 adequately screen, track, monitor, and provide follow-up care to prisoners who are \n4 suffering from serious mental illnesses, and to provide adequate group and individual \n5 therapy.  Upon information and belief, there are no mental health care staff on site at the \n6 Jail on the weekends or holidays.  Prisoners who experience serious mental health \n7 problems over a weekend or holiday, including prisoners newly booked into the Jail, are \n8 not seen by mental health care staff until the next business day.  Over certain holiday \n9 weekends, prisoners in need of acute mental health care treatment may not be seen for \n10 more than 72 hours.  Upon information and belief, Defendants often place such prisoners \n11 in rubber rooms until mental health care staff are available to see them. \n12 266.  For example, Plaintiff MEFFORD experienced an acute psychiatric incident \n13 in January 2014 on a Friday afternoon when he began engaging in acts of self-harm.  \n14 Plaintiff MEFFORD was housed in rubber rooms (sometimes while being placed in a \n15 restraint chair) and booking cells until Monday, when he was seen by mental health care \n16 staff.  The psychiatrist at the Jail explicitly ordered that Plaintiff MEFFORD be kept in a \n17 rubber room or booking cell over the weekend until the doctor could evaluate Plaintiff \n18 MEFFORD on Monday.  Because of his placement in rubber rooms and booking cells over \n19 the weekend without any evaluation by mental health care staff, Plaintiff MEFFORD’s \n20 mental health deteriorated and he engaged in additional acts of self-harm. \n21 267.  As another example, during an attorney interview, one prisoner was \n22 incapable of conversation, had feces in his hair, ranted obscene comments, and frequently \n23 exposed his genitals.  When alerted to this prisoner’s deteriorated mental health state by \n24 the attorney, Jail staff informed the attorney that the prisoner would be seen the next day \n25 because mental health staff had gone for the day. \n26 268.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental \n27 health staff to timely respond to prisoners’ requests for psychiatric evaluations and \n28 treatment, and to adequately screen, track, monitor, and provide follow-up care to \n[1144098-2]    94 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page97 of 137\n \n1 prisoners who are suffering from serious mental illness. \n2 K.  Defendants Fail to Maintain Accurate, Complete, and Confidential \nMental Health Treatment Records \n3  \n4 269.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to maintain adequate, accurate, \n5 and confidential mental health care records.  For example, upon information and belief, \n6 psychiatrists often change prisoners’ medications without documenting a clinical rationale.  \n7 Upon information and belief, psychiatrists also fail to document their justification and \n8 reasoning for changing the diagnoses and treatment plans for prisoners returning to the Jail \n9 from psychiatric hospitals.  As a result of Defendants’ failure to maintain adequate mental \n10 health care records, prisoners suffer from a substantial risk of misdiagnosis, dangerous \n11 mistakes, and unnecessary delays in care. \n12 270.  Plaintiff MEFFORD’s psychiatric medications have been changed multiple \n13 times since he arrived at the Jail in the beginning of December 2013.  Some of these shifts \n14 are documented by progress notes with a few words justifying the shift, but many are not.  \n15 Plaintiff MEFFORD is a former CDCR prisoner.  While in a CDCR prison, Plaintiff \n16 MEFFORD consistently received a set of psychiatric medications to treat his mental \n17 illness.  Soon after Plaintiff MEFFORD arrived at the Jail, a psychiatrist at the Jail \n18 changed his medication regime by substituting one medication for a cheaper version and \n19 adding an additional medication.  On information and belief, the psychiatrist failed to \n20 document any clinical explanation for this medication shift.  Plaintiff MEFFORD has \n21 suffered a number of psychotic episodes since entering the Jail and has struggled with \n22 continuing anxiety, depression, and episodes of self-harm. \n23 271.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to obtain medical files from \n24 outside providers for lengthy periods of time after the prisoner’s arrival at the Jail (if at \n25 all).  This lack of information results in inadequate and delayed mental health care which \n26 places prisoners at an unreasonable risk of harm.  For example, Plaintiff MURPHY was \n27 arrested and booked into the Jail on January 18, 2013.  During an intake triage assessment \n28 that same day, Jail staff was informed that Plaintiff MURPHY’s psychiatric medications \n[1144098-2]    95 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page98 of 137\n \n1 were prescribed by a physician at the Monterey County Veteran’s Administration clinic.  \n2 Plaintiff MURPHY was not seen by any mental health staff until January 21, 2013, when \n3 he had an appointment with a Licensed Psychiatric Technician, who could not and did not \n4 prescribe him medications.  Upon information and belief, the Licensed Psychiatric \n5 Technician made only one request for Plaintiff MURPHY’s medical records from the \n6 Monterey County Veteran’s Affairs office (“VA”) on January 21, 2013, and made no \n7 effort to follow up after that date.  On January 28, 2013, at least in part because he was not \n8 provided with any psychiatric medications, Plaintiff MURPHY was placed in a rubber \n9 room where he remained until January 30, 2013.  As of at least April 19, 2013, Defendants \n10 had not obtained Plaintiff MURPHY’s psychiatric records from the VA. \n11 272.  Plaintiff GREIM arrived at the Jail in September 2012.  He reported during \n12 an intake screening that he had received mental health care and psychiatric medications \n13 while incarcerated in a CDCR prison as recently as the spring of 2012.  Defendants did not \n14 request his records until March 2013.  These records confirmed that Plaintiff GREIM \n15 suffers from a mood disorder and was prescribed Remeron while in prison and on parole in \n16 2012 immediately prior to his booking in Monterey County Jail.  Plaintiff GREIM had \n17 received care at the enhanced outpatient level while in prison.  Even after receiving these \n18 records, Defendants failed to provide Plaintiff GREIM with any treatment for his serious \n19 mental illness.  And when Plaintiff GREIM again requested psychiatric medication in July \n20 2013, Defendants noted in his file that they “would get” his prison records—records they \n21 had received months before.  Plaintiff GREIM did not begin to regularly receive any \n22 psychiatric medications while in Monterey County Jail until on or around October 3, 2013. \n23 273.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental \n24 health staff regarding how to maintain accurate mental health records, including the timely \n25 request of prisoners’ prior mental health records. \n26 274.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have not ensured that the \n27 psychiatric care records of prisoners who are sent to Alameda County pursuant to the \n28 contract described in Paragraph 178, supra, either accompany those prisoners to Alameda \n[1144098-2]    96 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page99 of 137\n \n1 County or follow in a timely manner.  As a result, Monterey County prisoners including \n2 Plaintiff GREIM, have experienced interruptions in care and delays in receiving necessary \n3 medications when transferred to the physical custody of Alameda County.  As a result, \n4 Plaintiff GREIM experienced severe anxiety and mental health distress upon his arrival at \n5 Alameda County Jail, and staff there lacked the necessary information to provide him with \n6 appropriate care. \n7 275.  Upon information and belief, Defendants also fail to prepare adequate \n8 discharge summaries and to take steps to ensure continuity of care for prisoners with \n9 mental health impairments who are released from the Jail or transferred to other \n10 institutions.  These failures result in unnecessary decompensation and inability to receive \n11 appropriate medications for prisoners with mental health issues housed at the Jail. \n12 L.  Defendants Fail to Adequately Train Staff to Provide Appropriate and \nTimely Mental Health Care \n13  \n14 276.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody and \n15 health care staff in how to provide appropriate and timely mental health care.  The lack of \n16 training is evident from the numerous incidents in which prisoners’ health and lives were \n17 placed at risk as a result of the deficient mental health care provided in the Jail.  As a result \n18 of a lack of adequate training, custody and health care staff do not, among other failings: \n19 timely and appropriately identify mental health problems during the screening and intake \n20 process, properly evaluate and treat prisoners who arrive at the Jail and have been taking \n21 prescribed psychotropic medications, recognize signs and symptoms of mental illness and \n22 refer prisoners exhibiting such signs and symptoms to mental health care staff, track and \n23 monitor prisoners with mental illness and the treatment they require, identify prisoners \n24 who are at risk of suicide and respond adequately to prisoners who are exhibiting suicidal \n25 tendencies, provide therapy to prisoners with mental illness as a component of mental \n26 health care, properly administer psychotropic medications, appropriately evaluate prisoners \n27 before making mental health treatment decisions, appropriately release prisoners with \n28 serious mental health concerns so that such prisoners can continue their mental health care, \n[1144098-2]    97 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page100 of 137\n \n1 appropriately house prisoners with serious mental illness, ensure that prisoners with mental \n2 illness are only housed in administrative segregation when absolutely necessary and are \n3 adequately monitored and treated when placed in such punitive and isolating units, \n4 appropriately respond to mentally ill prisoners whose non-conforming behaviors are a \n5 product of their mental illness, respond to prisoners’ requests for psychiatric evaluations \n6 and treatment, provide follow-up care to prisoners who are suffering from serious mental \n7 illness, and maintain accurate mental health records, including the timely request of \n8 prisoners’ prior mental health records. \n9 IV.  DEFENDANTS DISCRIMINATE AGAINST, FAIL TO ACCOMMODATE, \nAND VIOLATE THE RIGHTS OF PRISONERS WITH DISABILITIES \n10  \n11 277.  Defendants MONTEREY COUNTY and MONTEREY COUNTY \n12 SHERIFF’S OFFICE currently incarcerate in Monterey County Jail significant numbers of \n13 individuals with disabilities, as that term is defined in the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, \n14 and California disability rights law.  Together with Defendant CFMG, these Defendants \n15 fail to provide prisoners with disabilities with basic reasonable accommodations to ensure \n16 equivalent access to all of the programs, activities, and services offered at the Jail.  \n17 Defendants’ failure to accommodate prisoners with disabilities not only denies them access \n18 to prison programs and services, but also substantially increases the risk that they are \n19 injured in an emergency or are the victim of violence or abuse from other prisoners.  \n20 Moreover, Defendants’ refusal to accommodate prisoners with disabilities results in the \n21 provision of inadequate medical and mental health care and the trampling of prisoners’ due \n22 process rights in Jail disciplinary proceedings. \n23 A.  Defendants Lack Adequate Policies and Practices to Identify and Track \nPrisoners with Disabilities and Provide Them with Needed \n24 Accommodations \n25 278.  Under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and California disability rights law, \n26 Defendants must create and maintain a system to identify and track individuals with \n27 disabilities and the accommodations they require.  Defendants, however, lack adequate \n28 policies and practices for identifying individuals with disabilities and the reasonable \n[1144098-2]    98 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page101 of 137\n \n1 accommodations they require. \n2 279.  Defendants fail to identify prisoners with disabilities.  During the intake \n3 process, custody officers collect various pieces of information about new prisoners.  \n4 Custody staff use the information to make a number of determinations, including how to \n5 classify a prisoner.  A prisoner’s classification determines with which other prisoners the \n6 new prisoner can share space and in what parts of the prison the new prisoner can be \n7 housed. \n8 280.  Upon information and belief, the custody officers who are responsible for \n9 conducting the intake process are not adequately trained by Defendants regarding how to \n10 identify and track individuals with disabilities, and therefore frequently fail to identify \n11 prisoners with disabilities or the accommodations they need to access Jail programs and \n12 services.  Upon information and belief, the forms and system that the custody staff use to \n13 capture the information gathered during the intake process lack adequate fields and space \n14 to document if a prisoner has a disability and requires accommodations. \n15 281.  Defendants’ failures to accurately identify new prisoners’ disabilities and \n16 needed accommodations during the intake process result in the denial of accommodations \n17 mandated by the ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and California disability rights law, placing \n18 prisoners at risk of discrimination, injury, and/or exploitation.  For example, during \n19 booking into the Jail in August 2012 and again in December 2012, custody staff completed \n20 Monterey County Sheriff’s Office Intake Health Screening forms for Plaintiff YANCEY.  \n21 Despite Plaintiff YANCEY’s complete hearing impairment, staff did not indicate on the \n22 forms that he had a hearing disability.  Accordingly, staff throughout the Jail were unable \n23 to identify Plaintiff YANCEY as hearing impaired, resulting in a lack of accommodations \n24 for his disability. \n25 282.  Plaintiff ESQUIVEL is a full-time wheelchair user.  He is unable to get \n26 around at all without a wheelchair.  Despite this, when Plaintiff ESQUIVEL entered the \n27 Jail in October 2013, on neither his Intake Health Screening form nor his Intake Triage \n28 Assessment did any custody or medical staff member note that he requires a wheelchair. \n[1144098-2]    99 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page102 of 137\n \n1 283.  Plaintiff MURPHY was booked into the Jail in January 2013 with a \n2 permanent back injury that requires him to use a walker or cane to ambulate without pain.  \n3 During the intake process, the Jail failed to identify him as having a mobility impairment \n4 requiring an accommodation, and he was not provided with a walker or a cane.  Plaintiff \n5 MURPHY was eventually provided with a cane after many months’ delay, during which \n6 he frequently was unable to leave his bed due to his inability to walk unassisted. \n7 284.  Plaintiff NICHOLS was detained at the Jail on June 20, 2013.  Plaintiff \n8 NICHOLS has a permanent mobility impairment arising from a motor vehicle accident \n9 many years ago.  Although he normally uses a cane to ambulate and visibly has trouble \n10 walking, when he arrived at the Jail he neither had nor was provided with any assistive \n11 devices.  Because he did not receive any assistive device, Plaintiff NICHOLS presented to \n12 medical staff with complaints of falling on his head three times, after which he received a \n13 wheelchair. \n14 285.  Another prisoner who was booked into the Jail in January 2012 with a \n15 mobility impairment required a cane to help him safely ambulate and access his housing \n16 unit and also required a lower bunk housing assignment to safely access a bed.  During the \n17 intake process, the Jail failed to identify him as having a mobility impairment requiring \n18 those accommodations; he was not provided with a cane and the only available bed in his \n19 housing unit was on the upper bunk of a triple bunk.  Without a cane, the prisoner fell and \n20 injured himself on a number of occasions.  He slept on the floor because it was too difficult \n21 for him to access his bunk. \n22 286.  Defendants do not maintain any central list, electronic or otherwise, of \n23 prisoners with disabilities and the accommodations they require.  Defendants do not \n24 maintain adequate information about prisoners’ disabilities and related accommodations in \n25 the prisoners’ custody and/or medical files.  Upon information and belief, to the extent that \n26 Defendants maintain information about a prisoner’s disabilities in any form, custody, \n27 medical, and clerical staff are not provided with access to the information in a manner that \n28 would timely and effectively inform them of a prisoner’s disabilities and required \n[1144098-2]    100 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page103 of 137\n \n1 accommodations.  Upon information and belief, Defendants do not adequately train staff to \n2 maintain records or information about prisoners’ disabilities and related accommodations. \n3 287.  The lack of an adequate disability and accommodation tracking system \n4 results in substantial injuries to prisoners with disabilities, and results in their being denied \n5 the benefits of programs, services, and activities at the Jail.  Without an adequate tracking \n6 system, medical and custody staff have no easily accessible means to determine whether a \n7 prisoner has a disability, and what, if any, accommodations that prisoner requires.  \n8 Consequently, Defendants fail to provide prisoners with accommodations or withdraw \n9 accommodations that have already been provided without justification. \n10 288.  For example, Plaintiff YANCEY is deaf, cannot hear, and uses American \n11 Sign Language as his primary form of communication.  Plaintiff YANCEY was not \n12 provided with a sign language interpreter for his communications with Jail staff, including \n13 at medical appointments, at a disciplinary hearing, and during the booking and \n14 classification process. \n15 289.  Plaintiff SARABI was provided with crutches after he sustained an injury to \n16 his right leg when he was attacked by another prisoner on or around March 6, 2013.  \n17 However, on or around April 8, 2013, Plaintiff SARABI was called in for an unsolicited \n18 medical exam at which his crutches were taken away from him with no explanation, \n19 despite the fact that he still required the crutches in order to ambulate.  Plaintiff SARABI \n20 could not use the restroom or shower without his crutches, and had to crawl around or hop \n21 on one foot to get around the Jail until his attorney contacted the Jail to request that the \n22 crutches be provided. \n23 290.  Plaintiff MILLER suffers from vision loss as a complication of his severe \n24 Type 1 diabetes.  He began complaining of blurred vision shortly after his arrival at the \n25 Jail; his vision limitations were confirmed by an ophthalmologist to which he was sent by \n26 Defendants.  His custody file, however, contains no documentation of his vision limitation.  \n27 Nor does the Jail provide any kind of vest or other visible means by which custody staff \n28 may identify Plaintiff MILLER as vision-impaired in event of an emergency. \n[1144098-2]    101 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page104 of 137\n \n1 291.  Plaintiff ESQUIVEL had his wheelchair taken away from him for at least 14 \n2 hours in August 2012.  As a result of being denied the needed assistive device, he was \n3 rendered immobile, was unable to access the showers and restrooms, was forced to rely \n4 upon other prisoners for assistance, and was therefore placed at increased risk of being \n5 manipulated or attacked by other prisoners. \n6 B.  Defendants Lack an Effective Grievance Procedure for Prisoners to \nRequest Reasonable Disability Accommodations \n7  \n8 292.  Defendants do not provide an effective or functional grievance system for \n9 prisoners with disabilities as required by the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. \n10 293.  Defendants do not provide prisoners with adequate notice of how to request \n11 reasonable accommodations for their disabilities.  Upon information and belief, the only \n12 formal notice prisoners receive regarding any Jail grievance procedure comes from the \n13 “Monterey County Adult Detention Facility Inmate Information Booklet” (hereinafter \n14 “Inmate Information Booklet”), which is provided to each prisoner when booked into the \n15 Jail.  Yet the Inmate Information Booklet does not discuss disabilities or the process for \n16 requesting disability accommodations.  As a result, prisoners are not informed of any \n17 specific process for complaining about disability discrimination or requesting disability \n18 accommodations. \n19 294.  Defendants routinely deny prisoners access to grievance forms.  Each \n20 prisoner is provided with only one grievance form which is attached to the Inmate \n21 Information Booklet provided during booking.  Upon information and belief, grievance \n22 forms are not freely available in the housing units. \n23 295.  Even when prisoners are able to submit grievances, Defendants frequently do \n24 not provide any response.  One prisoner submitted multiple grievances following her re-\n25 entry to the Jail on June 15, 2013, but received no responses.  A housing deputy told her \n26 that one of her grievances had been “lost” and would not be returned to her.  This prisoner \n27 then filed a grievance with regards to this purportedly lost grievance, which also did not \n28 receive a response.  Plaintiff HERNANDEZ submitted at least four grievances to which he \n[1144098-2]    102 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page105 of 137\n \n1 never received responses.  Plaintiff MURPHY submitted a grievance on April 4, 2013, \n2 requesting a cane or walker as an accommodation for his mobility impairment; he did not \n3 receive a response to the grievance either.  Plaintiff SARABI submitted a grievance on \n4 April 4, 2013, requesting to see a doctor for the intense pain he was experiencing in his \n5 foot (the source of his mobility impairment), but he also did not receive a response to the \n6 grievance.  Plaintiff WHITFIELD submitted multiple grievances to which he received no \n7 response or was told that the issue was resolved, even when it was not.  These include at \n8 least two grievances informing the Jail that he was still not receiving his needed and \n9 prescribed Provigil.  On both of these grievances, Jail staff members wrote that the issue \n10 was resolved, but he had not yet received his medication.  Plaintiff YANCEY submitted a \n11 grievance on December 20, 2012, requesting a number of accommodations relating to his \n12 serious hearing impairment, but he did not receive a response to the grievance. \n13 296.  Even when prisoners are able to submit a grievance and Defendants provide \n14 a response, the responses are not adequate or comprehensive, and may be arbitrary and \n15 counterproductive.  One prisoner filed three successive grievances concerning the Jail’s \n16 failure to provide her with necessary medications, none of which provided a satisfactory \n17 response or resulted in her receiving medication.  The Jail’s response to the first grievance \n18 was that she should have received her medication; to the second, that her issue had been \n19 addressed (it had not); and the third, that she should file a sick call slip for a refill of a \n20 medication the Jail had never given her.  As another example, a prisoner filed a grievance \n21 requesting a walking cane to assist him in moving around the dorm, shower, and going to \n22 court.  The response stated only that “you did not have a ‘cane’ when you came in to the \n23 facility.  If you are having problems go on sick call.” \n24 297.  Defendants lack adequate policies and procedures instructing health care or \n25 correctional officers how to respond if prisoners request accommodations through means \n26 other than the grievance process. \n27 298.  Defendants do not adequately train staff in how to provide, appropriately \n28 process, and timely respond to grievance forms. \n[1144098-2]    103 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page106 of 137\n \n1 299.  Defendants do not make available to prisoners in the Jail information \n2 regarding their rights and the protections against discrimination under the American with \n3 Disabilities Act. \n4 C.  Defendants Fail to Accommodate Prisoners with Disabilities That Affect \nCommunication \n5  \n6 300.  Prisoners with hearing, speech, developmental disabilities, mental illness, \n7 and other communication impairments have problems effectively communicating with Jail \n8 staff.  Prisoners with disabilities that impair communication require accommodations to \n9 ensure effective communication with prison staff and equal access to programs and \n10 services offered by Defendants.  Defendants fail to provide such accommodations.  As a \n11 result, prisoners with communication disabilities are denied the benefits of programs, \n12 services, and activities at the Jail.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to \n13 adequately train staff in how and when to provide such accommodations. \n14 301.  Defendants fail to provide prisoners with hearing and speech impairments \n15 with sign language interpreters, hearing aids, or other auxiliary aids.  Plaintiff YANCEY \n16 has been booked into the Jail numerous times over the past three to five years.  Plaintiff \n17 YANCEY is completely deaf, and also has a speech impairment that makes it difficult or \n18 impossible for him to communicate through spoken words.  He uses American Sign \n19 Language (ASL) as his primary form of communication, but was not provided with a sign \n20 language interpreter by Defendants during his incarcerations in the Jail. \n21 302.  Defendants do not provide prisoners with hearing, speech, and other \n22 communication impairments with sign language interpreters, hearing aids, staff assistants, \n23 or other auxiliary aids during the booking and intake process, which harms these prisoners \n24 by preventing them from communicating specific concerns, including emergency medical \n25 issues, and understanding Jail policies and practices. \n26 303.  For example, Defendants never provided Plaintiff YANCEY with a sign \n27 language interpreter during the booking process.  When he was booked into the Jail for his \n28 most recent term, Plaintiff YANCEY’s right arm was in a cast, making it impossible for \n[1144098-2]    104 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page107 of 137\n \n1 him to communicate through written notes.  Accordingly, he essentially lacked any means \n2 of communicating with the custody officers conducting the intake process. \n3 304.  Defendants fail to provide equal access to telephone services to prisoners \n4 who require the use of a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf/Teletype (“TDD/TTY”).  \n5 Non-TDD/TTY telephones are located in the housing units.  Upon information and belief, \n6 prisoners without disabilities have access to non-TDD/TTY telephones any time the \n7 prisoner is permitted in the common area of his or her housing unit.  Upon information and \n8 belief, telephone calls are limited to 30 minutes in length, though there is no limit to the \n9 number of telephone calls a prisoner may make so long as he or she does not abuse or \n10 monopolize the telephone. \n11 305.  In contrast, there is one TDD/TTY for the entire Jail.  Prisoners who require \n12 the use of the TDD/TTY must ask a custody officer to transport them to the office where \n13 the TDD/TTY is located.  Officers frequently refused to transport Plaintiff YANCEY to \n14 the TDD/TTY, claiming that they were too busy to do so.  Even when allowed to use the \n15 TDD/TTY, Plaintiff YANCEY was denied sufficient time to conduct a conversation, since \n16 using a TDD/TTY takes longer than using a telephone. \n17 306.  Defendants’ policies and practices for equal access to telephone services are \n18 inadequate.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train staff in how \n19 to provide equal access to telephone services. \n20 307.  Defendants fail to provide prisoners with hearing, speech, or other \n21 communication impairments with sign language interpreters, hearing aids, staff assistants, \n22 or other auxiliary aids to permit participation in other Jail programs and services, including \n23 religious services and educational and vocational classes.  For example, Plaintiff \n24 YANCEY was not provided with a sign language interpreter when attending religious \n25 services at the Jail.  As a result, he was not able to understand what was being said by the \n26 chaplain and other participants, and could not participate in the services himself. \n27 308.  Defendants do not provide equal access to television to prisoners who are \n28 hearing impaired.  Upon information and belief, most non-disciplinary housing units have \n[1144098-2]    105 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page108 of 137\n \n1 televisions installed for prisoners to watch, but Defendants have either not installed \n2 televisions with the capability to display closed captioning or they fail to alter the settings \n3 to the televisions to display closed captioning. \n4 309.  Defendants fail to provide sign language interpreters, hearing aids, staff \n5 assistants, and other auxiliary aids at disciplinary hearings even though prisoners risk a \n6 loss of credits and privileges if they are found guilty of disciplinary infractions.  For \n7 example, Plaintiff YANCEY was charged with a rule violation on December 16, 2012.  At \n8 the disciplinary hearing, he was found guilty of the violation and punished with two weeks \n9 without visitation, canteen, or yard privileges.  Plaintiff YANCEY was not provided with a \n10 sign language interpreter at the disciplinary hearing, and therefore was not able to defend \n11 himself or explain his version of the events.  Without an interpreter, Plaintiff YANCEY \n12 also had difficulty understanding what the hearing officer and other Jail staff were saying. \n13 310.  By failing to provide Plaintiff YANCEY and other hearing impaired \n14 prisoners with sign language interpreters, hearing aids, or other auxiliary aids at \n15 disciplinary hearings, Defendants deny such prisoners the same opportunity to participate \n16 in the hearing regarding their guilt or innocence of the disciplinary charge and to present \n17 their views to the hearing officer that prisoners without disabilities have. \n18 311.  Similarly, as is discussed in Paragraph 261, supra, Plaintiff MEFFORD \n19 received a Disciplinary Action Report on December 15, 2013, for yelling at a guard.  \n20 Despite knowing of his serious mental illness, Defendants did not provide and did not even \n21 consider whether they should provide Plaintiff MEFFORD with a staff assistant to help \n22 him understand the disciplinary proceedings.  As punishment, Plaintiff MEFFORD lost \n23 four weeks of commissary, yard, and visiting privileges.  Plaintiff MEFFORD appealed \n24 this Disciplinary Action Report on the grounds that four weeks of punishment was too \n25 severe because his conduct had been caused by his mental illness.  Plaintiff MEFFORD \n26 noted that these punishments would “lead to me being very depressed and or suicidal and \n27 self harmful.”  Defendants denied Plaintiff MEFFORD’s appeal on January 2, 2014, \n28 because “in this facility we take serious [sic]” “threats against an officer…regardless of an \n[1144098-2]    106 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page109 of 137\n \n1 inmate’s medical condition.”  Defendants failed to ensure that they effectively \n2 communicated their response to Plaintiff MEFFORD’s grievance. \n3 312.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to communicate effectively \n4 with prisoners with disabilities that affect cognitive functions, including prisoners with \n5 learning disabilities, developmental disabilities, mental illness, and brain injuries.  Plaintiff \n6 NICHOLS has a brain injury that affects his cognitive function.  Defendants noted his \n7 brain injury multiple times in his medical file.  Nonetheless, neither his custody nor his \n8 medical files have any indication that any staff at the Jail ever used any method of \n9 effective communication to ensure that Plaintiff NICHOLS understood any of his \n10 interactions with staff, including during medical appointments and the booking process. \n11 D.  Defendants Routinely Fail to Provide Prisoners with Disabilities with \nNeeded Assistive Devices \n12  \n13 313.  Defendants lack policies and practices to ensure that prisoners with \n14 disabilities who require assistive devices, including, but not limited to, wheelchairs, \n15 walkers, crutches, canes, braces, tapping canes, hearing aids, and pocket talkers, as \n16 accommodations are provided with and are allowed to retain those devices.  Upon \n17 information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train staff in how to timely and \n18 appropriately provide assistive devices to prisoners with disabilities. \n19 314.  Because of Defendants’ deficient disability screening procedure and \n20 inadequate grievance process, prisoners who require assistive devices to access Jail \n21 programs are frequently not identified.  As a result, those prisoners do not receive needed \n22 assistive devices and cannot access the programs and services offered at the Jail. \n23 315.  Upon information and belief, Defendants deny prisoners certain assistive \n24 devices, claiming that such items are not permitted in the Jail.  For example, Plaintiff \n25 MURPHY, who uses a cane to ambulate and required a lower bunk housing assignment \n26 while at CDCR facilities, requested during the booking process that he be provided with a \n27 cane or walker.  He was informed by Jail staff that canes and walkers were not allowed in \n28 the Jail.  Despite this initial assertion, Plaintiff MURPHY has now been provided with a \n[1144098-2]    107 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page110 of 137\n \n1 cane.  Other prisoners’ files indicate that canes are sometimes allowed if approved by \n2 custody staff, rather than if deemed medically necessary as accommodations for \n3 documented disabilities. \n4 316.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have refused to provide some \n5 prisoners with assistive devices as an accommodation for a disability, even after \n6 Defendants have identified the person as a qualified individual with a disability and as \n7 needing a particular assistive device.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have \n8 informed such prisoners that they are permitted to possess certain assistive devices, but \n9 only if someone from outside of the Jail, like a family member, friend, or community \n10 organization provides the assistive device.  Unless the assistive device is provided by a \n11 third party, such prisoners may be denied reasonable accommodations necessary for them \n12 to access programs and services offered by Defendants. \n13 317.  Even when the Jail provides a prisoner with an assistive device, Defendants \n14 unjustifiably remove these devices from prisoners, as alleged in Paragraphs 289-291, \n15 supra. \n16 318.  Defendants fail to consider prisoners’ specific needs and abilities in \n17 assigning assistive devices, to the detriment of those prisoners’ overall health and safety.  \n18 For example, Plaintiff NICHOLS normally uses a cane to ambulate, but was provided with \n19 a wheelchair by Defendants because he did not have a cane with him at time of arrest.  \n20 Because Defendants have provided Plaintiff NICHOLS with a wheelchair rather than his \n21 accustomed cane, he is less physically active at the Jail than he is able to be and would like \n22 to be, and has suffered deterioration of his overall physical condition.  He is also denied \n23 equal access to Jail programs, services, and activities as a result of his confinement to a \n24 wheelchair. \n25 319.  Defendants also fail to provide properly operational assistive devices to \n26 prisoners.  Plaintiff ESQUIVEL received a wheelchair in October 2013 with a broken right \n27 wheel and a missing foot bed.  Plaintiff ESQUIVEL was thus only able to get around by \n28 performing a “wheelie” to lift up the broken wheel and move himself forward.  Even after \n[1144098-2]    108 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page111 of 137\n \n1 he complained about this wheelchair to medical staff, he was not provided with an \n2 operational wheelchair.  It was only after he complained to the CFMG Program Manager \n3 that he was provided with a functioning wheelchair. \n4 E.  Defendants Fail to Provide Prisoners with Disabilities with Equal Access \nto Programs and Services, Including Safe and Accessible Housing \n5  \n6 320.  Defendants fail to ensure that prisoners with disabilities have equal access to \n7 all programs and services offered at the Jail. \n8 321.  Defendants fail to ensure that prisoners with disabilities are assigned to and \n9 are actually housed in housing units and bed assignments that are accessible and safe.  \n10 Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train staff in how to house \n11 prisoners with disabilities in accessible and safe housing. \n12 322.  The Jail consists of five main housing areas—the Rehabilitation Center, the \n13 Men’s Section, K-Pod, the Dorm Section, and the Women’s Section—located in two \n14 buildings. \n15 323.  Each housing area is separated into a number of smaller housing units.  The \n16 housing units differ in their design, and importantly, in their accessibility to prisoners with \n17 disabilities.  Some of the housing units are dorm housing units, where many beds, \n18 including triple bunks, are placed in an open area that is shared by the prisoners.  Other \n19 housing units consist of celled housing, where the unit is divided into a number of cells \n20 with doors in which one or two prisoners are housed.  Cells that house two prisoners \n21 typically have bunk beds in them. \n22 324.  Some of the housing units in the Jail are located up flights of stairs, while \n23 others are on the ground floor. \n24 325.  Defendants control housing unit assignments.  In housing units with celled \n25 housing, Defendants also assign prisoners to a particular cell. \n26 326.  Upon information and belief, Defendants make decisions regarding where to \n27 house a particular prisoner without taking into account the prisoner’s disability-related \n28 limitations.  Because of Defendants’ general failure to identify and track prisoners with \n[1144098-2]    109 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page112 of 137\n \n1 disabilities, Defendants decide where to house a prisoner without sufficient information \n2 regarding the prisoner’s limitations; this practice significantly increases the risk that a \n3 prisoner will be assigned to a housing unit that is not accessible to him or her, because, for \n4 example, it lacks adequate toilets or grab bars in the shower, is up a flight of stairs, lacks \n5 space for a wheelchair. \n6 327.  One prisoner who was housed in the Jail for a significant period of time was \n7 a full-time wheelchair user.  Defendants generally permitted this prisoner to retain his \n8 wheelchair in the Jail, meaning that Defendants were aware of his mobility impairment.  \n9 Nonetheless, Defendants housed this prisoner in the C-Dorm and D-Dorm within the Dorm \n10 Section.  The C-Dorm and D-Dorm were not then wheelchair accessible in that they did \n11 not have toilets and showers with grab bars, did not have shower chairs, and had structural \n12 lips between the housing areas and the showers.  Upon information and belief, C-Dorm \n13 and D-Dorm still do not have shower grab bars and lack adequate shower chairs.  This \n14 prisoner fell four times while housed in those dorms when attempting to access the toilets \n15 and showers, injuring himself each time he fell.  He also was frequently forced to rely on \n16 other prisoners for assistance to access the toilets and showers. \n17 328.  Plaintiff ESQUIVEL has previously been housed in both C-Dorm and D-\n18 Dorm.  While there, he was unable to use the shower or toilet without assistance from \n19 other prisoners or serious concern for his own safety. \n20 329.  Another prisoner who was a full-time wheelchair user was permitted to \n21 retain his wheelchair, indicating that Defendants were aware of his mobility impairment.  \n22 Nevertheless, Defendants housed this prisoner in the B-Dorm for 30-45 days.  This \n23 prisoner had difficulty accessing almost every feature of B-Dorm, including the bathroom.  \n24 Specifically, this prisoner was forced to shower while sitting in his wheelchair due to the \n25 lack of a shower chair, and had to rely on other prisoners to press the shower button for \n26 him because he could not reach it.  This prisoner also had to rely on other prisoners to lift \n27 him onto the toilet. \n28 330.  One prisoner was known to have a mobility impairment and provided with \n[1144098-2]    110 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page113 of 137\n \n1 crutches to use within the Jail.  Nevertheless, he was housed in J-Pod, which has a shower \n2 without any minimal accessibility features such as a grab bar or shower chair.  As a result, \n3 he suffered several serious falls while attempting to use a shower that was not accessible to \n4 him, but was the only shower available to him. \n5 331.  Upon information and belief, Defendants lack policies and practices for \n6 ensuring the prisoners who require lower bunk bed assignments actually receive lower \n7 bunk bed assignments.  Upon information and belief, in many housing units, Defendants \n8 have essentially no system for assigning particular prisoners to specific beds.  Instead, \n9 especially in dorm housing units, Defendants typically abdicate the assignment and \n10 selection of beds in the housing unit to the prisoners themselves, who will be assigned to \n11 the newly-vacated bed.  In some dorm housing units, bed assignments and selection are \n12 determined by who has been in the unit for the longest period of time.  In units that include \n13 a significant number of gang members, bed assignments may be determined by the leaders \n14 of the gang within the unit. \n15 332.  Plaintiff WHITFIELD, who is at serious risk for falling off of his bunk due \n16 to his narcolepsy and cataplexy, was inappropriately housed on an upper-level bunk of a \n17 triple bunk in C-Wing upon first entering the Jail in November 2013.  Jail staff did not \n18 assign him to a lower bunk and thus he was forced to accept the empty bed offered to him \n19 by the other prisoners.  It took repeated requests to medical and custody staff for him to be \n20 moved to the Rotunda, where he was finally provided with a single bed. \n21 333.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have no means for ensuring that \n22 prisoners who require lower bunk bed assignments are actually able to sleep in lower \n23 bunks, and have no mechanism for guaranteeing that prisoners who should not be housed \n24 in triple bunks avoid such bed placements.  As a result, prisoners who require lower bunk \n25 and non-triple bunk bed assignments as accommodations for their disabilities may be \n26 forced to sleep on upper bunks and in triple bunks rather than experience the pain and \n27 danger of sleeping in an inaccessible bed.  For example, Plaintiff NICHOLS was housed \n28 for many weeks in a dorm where he was required to sleep in a middle bunk, although that \n[1144098-2]    111 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page114 of 137\n \n1 bunk was difficult and painful for him to access. \n2 334.  A prisoner booked into the jail in January 2012 with a mobility impairment \n3 required a lower bunk housing assignment to safely access a bed.  During the intake \n4 process, Defendants failed to identify him as having a mobility impairment requiring that \n5 accommodation.  In the housing unit to which he was assigned, the only available bed was \n6 on the upper bunk of a triple bunk.  No prisoner in the unit would agree to switch bed \n7 assignments with him.  Rather than sleep on the upper bunk, he slept on the floor because \n8 it was too difficult and dangerous for him to access the available bed. \n9 335.  On information and belief, Defendants’ general practice is to house prisoners \n10 with disabilities, mobility impairments, and/or significant medical needs in the Rotunda of \n11 the Jail, a space designed for use as a programmatic area and not as a housing unit.  One \n12 prisoner who uses a wheelchair and was housed in the Rotunda in July 2013 fell and was \n13 injured while attempting to use the Rotunda shower, which is not properly equipped for \n14 use by prisoners with disabilities. \n15 336.  The recreation yards for the Men’s Section (including the Rotunda), the \n16 Women’s Section, and K-Pod are located on the roof of the Jail.  In order to access the \n17 yards, prisoners must walk up one long flight of stairs and then down a smaller flight of \n18 stairs.  The stairways are the only means of reaching the yard.  Because the yard is located \n19 on the roof, prisoners who are housed in the Men’s Section, Women’s Section, or K-Pod \n20 and who have mobility or vision impairments that make walking up or down stairs \n21 difficult, painful, impossible, or dangerous are denied access to the recreation yard. \n22 337.  One such prisoner, due to her use of a walker, was thus denied access to the \n23 rooftop recreation yard used by female prisoners.  Mobility-impaired prisoners housed in \n24 the Rotunda, such as Plaintiff NICHOLS, are also unable to access the recreational yard.  \n25 Because of his mobility impairment, Plaintiff MURPHY has rarely accessed the yard since \n26 he arrived at the Jail on January 18, 2013.  If the yard for their housing units was not up a \n27 flight of stairs, all three prisoners would have gone to the yard most times that it was \n28 offered to them. \n[1144098-2]    112 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page115 of 137\n \n1 338.  Plaintiff DILLEY can only climb the stairs to access the exercise yard if she \n2 is willing to endure great pain in her legs.  As a result, she has not been able to access the \n3 exercise yard for the entire duration of her time in the Jail.  While incarcerated, Plaintiff \n4 DILLEY has not been outside except when she has been escorted to medical appointments \n5 at outside medical specialists and to go to court.  She had not been outside at all between \n6 mid-December 2013 and late-March 2014. \n7 339.  Plaintiff GIST would like to attend the religious services and substance \n8 abuse treatment classes, Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous, but in order to \n9 access the programs and services she must climb the same long staircase that provides the \n10 Women’s Section with access to the exercise yard.  There is no alternative means of \n11 accessing these programs and services.  Plaintiff GIST does not attend these programs due \n12 to the pain caused by climbing the stairs.  Plaintiff GIST could likely access the class if \n13 Defendants offered the class in an area of the Jail that could be reached without having to \n14 climb stairs. \n15 340.  As a permanent wheelchair user, Plaintiff ESQUIVEL was not able to access \n16 the exercise yard while he was housed in the Rotunda \n17 341.  Another prisoner who has a mobility impairment that makes walking up \n18 stairs extremely difficult and painful was assigned to F-Pod.  This prisoner declined to go \n19 to yard every time that it was offered because the pain and difficulty of climbing the stairs \n20 was too great.  On at least one occasion, despite this prisoner’s mobility impairments, \n21 Defendants forced him to climb the stairs to the yard when Defendants were conducting \n22 searches of cells in F-Pod.  The prisoner specifically requested that he be excused from the \n23 need to go to the yard; Defendants denied his request.  When he had to walk up to the yard, \n24 it caused him great pain and placed him at serious risk of falling and further injuring \n25 himself. \n26 342.  Defendants offer an educational program to some prisoners called Choices \n27 and Pride.  Prisoners who complete the more than 20 sessions of Choices and Pride, \n28 conducted over a period of weeks, receive a five-day reduction of their sentence.  Choices \n[1144098-2]    113 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page116 of 137\n \n1 and Pride is only offered to women in the Jail in a room that is located up the same long \n2 staircase that provides the Women’s Section with access to the exercise yard.  There is no \n3 alternative means of accessing the classroom.  Plaintiff DILLEY desires to complete the \n4 class to receive a reduction in her sentence.  She was able to access the classroom for the \n5 first session of the class, but did so by suffering through the extraordinary pain caused by \n6 climbing up and down the stairs.  By forcing Plaintiff DILLEY to climb the stairs to access \n7 the class, and suffer significant, unnecessary pain, Defendants discriminate against \n8 Plaintiff DILLEY.  Plaintiff DILLEY could access the class without any unnecessary pain \n9 if Defendants offered the class in an area of the Jail that could be reached without having \n10 to climb stairs. \n11 343.  Plaintiff GIST would like to participate in the Jail’s educational programs \n12 but cannot because of her developmental and physical disabilities, which prevent her both \n13 from accessing the classroom space (which is located up a long flight of stairs that she \n14 cannot access without difficulty and pain) and understanding the classes.  If there were \n15 special education opportunities offered in a more accessible area, she would participate. \n16 344.  Defendants use segregated isolation units to house prisoners with disabilities \n17 whom they are unable to properly accommodate.  One prisoner, who is mobility impaired \n18 due to permanent spinal injuries and uses a walker, was housed in the general population \n19 for approximately one month after she returned to the Jail following surgery.  On July 12, \n20 2013, she had a dispute with a deputy because that deputy would not allow her to leave her \n21 cell to pick up her dinner tray, “as she uses a walker and [it] would be hard for her to walk \n22 up and down the stairs with trays and her walker.”  She received a Disciplinary Action \n23 Report as a result of this conflict.  Rather than accommodating this prisoner to ensure that \n24 she could remain in the least restrictive possible housing environment and have equal \n25 access to dining services, Defendants moved her to the “holding” area of the women’s \n26 facility, a segregated and isolated single-cell unit.  Defendants moved this prisoner to the \n27 holding area at least in part because of her disability.  On a July 13, 2013 \n28 Lockdown/Inmate Movement form Defendants wrote that they “moved [this prisoner] to \n[1144098-2]    114 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page117 of 137\n \n1 holding so this incident [not being able to safely navigate the stairs with a tray] does not \n2 occur again.”  In the holding area, this prisoner slept on a mattress on the floor and had \n3 limited access to toilet facilities and running water.  On information and belief, this \n4 prisoner was housed in the holding area for approximately six weeks. \n5 345.  Defendants routinely discriminate against prisoners with serious mental \n6 illness by isolating them from and denying them privileges granted to other prisoners, as \n7 described in Paragraphs 254-256, supra.  When housed in lockdown units, isolation cells, \n8 or rubber rooms, prisoners with serious mental illnesses are denied access to programs and \n9 services. \n10 346.  Plaintiff MEFFORD has only been housed in lockdown, isolation, and safety \n11 cells while at the Jail.  In addition, he has repeatedly lost yard privileges due to disciplinary \n12 actions where the custody staff failed to consider the effect of his mental illness.  As such, \n13 he has been essentially denied access to the even limited recreational and therapeutic \n14 opportunities offered to prisoners housed in these cells. \n15 347.  Defendants have placed Plaintiff MURPHY in an isolation cell at least one \n16 time for a period of 10 days in April 2013.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiff \n17 MURPHY’s was denied access to programs, services, and activities at the Jail during his \n18 time in isolation. \n19 F.  Defendants Subject Prisoners with Disabilities to Dangerous Conditions \nin the Jail \n20  \n21 348.  Defendants fail to accommodate prisoners with disabilities that affect \n22 communication for interactions with medical and mental health care staff, despite the \n23 grave importance of the interactions.  Specifically, Defendants fail to provide sign \n24 language interpreters, hearing aids, staff assistants, and other auxiliary aids, or use other \n25 methods of effective communication, for prisoners with disabilities that affect \n26 communication.  Defendants fail to provide these accommodations despite knowledge that \n27 such prisoners cannot effectively communicate with staff without the accommodations and \n28 that the failure to communicate effectively places such prisoners at an increased risk that \n[1144098-2]    115 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page118 of 137\n \n1 medical or mental health issues will not be not be diagnosed or will be misdiagnosed. \n2 349.  For example, during his most recent booking in the Jail, Plaintiff YANCEY \n3 had at least six medical appointments.  He was not provided with a sign language \n4 interpreter at any of his appointments.  Because there was no sign language interpreter to \n5 help him communicate with the medical staff, Plaintiff YANCEY was not able to explain \n6 that the pain medication he was being provided was insufficient to treat his pain.  \n7 Accordingly, his pain symptoms were not adequately treated. \n8 350.  Plaintiff NICHOLS had at least eight interactions with medical staff during \n9 his time in the Jail.  None of the notes from those interactions indicate that medical staff \n10 used any method of effective communication to ensure that Plaintiff NICHOLS understood \n11 the information conveyed to him. \n12 351.  Defendants endanger prisoners with hearing impairments by failing to \n13 institute any system for visually identifying prisoners with hearing impairments (e.g., \n14 vests).  If a fight breaks out in a housing unit, Jail staff may order all prisoners to get down \n15 on the ground or to line up against a wall.  For any number of reasons, Jail staff may also \n16 order a specific prisoner to cease or engage in certain behavior.  Upon information and \n17 belief, Jail staff are authorized to initiate disciplinary proceedings and/or use force against \n18 prisoners who fail to comply with orders.  Upon information and belief, the use of force for \n19 failure to comply with an order can include the use of Tasers, non-lethal firearms (like \n20 “flash bang” grenades) and lethal firearms. \n21 352.  Prisoners with communication impairments like Plaintiff YANCEY, Plaintiff \n22 NICHOLS, or Plaintiff MEFFORD are not capable of understanding and therefore are less \n23 likely to comply with alarms and oral orders from jail staff.  Without a visual identification \n24 system by which staff can identify prisoners with communication impairments (e.g., vests), \n25 there is an increased risk that staff will not recognize that a prisoner has an impairment and \n26 will interpret such prisoner’s actions as a failure to comply with an order, rather than as a \n27 failure to hear and/or understand the order.  As a result, prisoners with hearing and other \n28 communication impairments are at increased risk that staff will initiate disciplinary \n[1144098-2]    116 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page119 of 137\n \n1 proceedings and/or use force for failure to comply with an order that they have not heard \n2 or understood. \n3 353.  Defendants lack any policy, practice, or system for notifying prisoners with \n4 disabilities of emergencies, including alarms, fires, and earthquakes.  Upon information \n5 and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train staff in how to notify prisoners with \n6 disabilities of emergencies.  Upon information and belief, the Jail does not have a visual or \n7 tactile alarm system installed to alert prisoners with disabilities.  Because Defendants lack \n8 a system for identifying prisoners with disabilities, including those with hearing and \n9 communication impairments, or notifying prisoners with disabilities of an emergency, \n10 these prisoners may not be aware of an emergency, or may need assistance during the \n11 emergency, and are therefore at increased risk of injury or death should one occur. \n12 354.  Defendants lack any policies or practices to ensure that prisoners with \n13 difficulty walking, including prisoners in wheelchairs, are safely evacuated from the Jail in \n14 the event of an emergency.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately \n15 train staff in how to ensure that prisoners with mobility impairments are safely evacuated \n16 from the Jail in an emergency.  Upon information and belief, the emergency exits in the \n17 Jail, to the extent they exist, are not accessible to prisoners in wheelchairs.  As a result, \n18 prisoners with difficulty ambulating are at increased risk of injury or death if an \n19 emergency, like a fire or earthquake, were to occur. \n20 355.  Defendants endanger prisoners with mobility impairments by failing to \n21 institute any system for staff to visually identify prisoners with mobility impairments.  \n22 Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train staff in how to visually \n23 identify prisoners with mobility impairments.  Upon information and belief, in response to \n24 alarms or other incidents in the Jail, custody staff frequently order prisoners to “prone out,” \n25 i.e., lay down on the ground, face down.  Upon information and belief, Jail staff are \n26 authorized to initiate disciplinary proceedings and/or use force against prisoners who fail \n27 to prone out when ordered to do so.  Upon information and belief, the use of force for \n28 failure to comply with an order to prone out can include the use of Tasers, non-lethal \n[1144098-2]    117 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page120 of 137\n \n1 firearms (like “flash bang” grenades) and lethal firearms. \n2 356.  Some prisoners with mobility impairments are incapable of complying with \n3 an order to prone out because of their mobility impairments.  Without a visual \n4 identification system by which staff can identify prisoners with such mobility impairments \n5 (e.g., a vest or certain color of clothing), there is an increased risk that custody staff will \n6 not recognize that a prisoner has a mobility impairment and will interpret such a prisoner’s \n7 failure to prone out as a failure to comply with an order, rather than an inability to comply \n8 with the order.  As a result, prisoners with mobility impairments are at increased risk that \n9 staff will initiate disciplinary proceedings and/or use force for failure to comply with an \n10 order to prone out with which they cannot comply because of their disability. \n11 357.  Prisoners with disabilities that are not accommodated are susceptible to \n12 exploitation by other prisoners.  For example, in exchange for help getting to the toilet, \n13 shower, or meals, or communicating with prison staff, prisoners with disabilities may be \n14 required to pay other prisoners, potentially leading to increased risk of violence or even \n15 rape. \n16 G.  Defendants Fail to Adequately Train Staff to Accommodate Prisoners \nwith Disabilities \n17  \n18 358.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody and \n19 health care staff in how to provide appropriate and timely accommodations to prisoners \n20 with disabilities.  The lack of training is evident from the numerous failures to \n21 accommodate prisoners with disabilities, and exclusion of prisoners with disabilities from \n22 equal access to programs, services, and activities offered by Defendants, and placement of \n23 prisoners with disabilities at risk of injury and exploitation.  As a result of a lack of \n24 adequate training, custody and health care staff do not, among other failings: identify and \n25 track individuals with disabilities and the accommodations they require, maintain records \n26 or information about prisoners’ disabilities and related accommodations, appropriately \n27 process and timely respond to grievance forms, provide accommodations necessary for \n28 effective communication, including sign language interpreters, hearing aids, staff \n[1144098-2]    118 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page121 of 137\n \n1 assistants, and other auxiliary aids, provide equal access to telephone services for prisoners \n2 with communication disabilities, notify prisoners with disabilities of emergencies, ensure \n3 that prisoners with mobility impairments are safely evacuated from the Jail in an \n4 emergency, and provide equal access to Jail services and programs. \n5 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n6 Prisoner Class \n7 359.  All Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and, pursuant to Rule \n8 23(a), (b)(1), and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of a class of all \n9 adult men and women who are now, or will be in the future, incarcerated in Monterey \n10 County Jail (“Prisoner Class”).  All prisoners incarcerated in the Jail are at substantial risk \n11 of serious harm due to the policies and practices of Defendants MONTEREY COUNTY, \n12 MONTEREY COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE, and CFMG (“Defendants”), including: \n13 a.  Denial of protection from injury and violence from other prisoners, \n14 b.  Denial of minimally adequate medical care, and \n15 c.  Denial of minimally adequate mental health care. \n16 Numerosity:  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n17 360.  The proposed class as defined is sufficiently numerous that joinder of all \n18 members of the class is impracticable and unfeasible.  Currently, there are more than 900 \n19 prisoners in the Jail, as well as thousands of individuals either in CDCR custody or in the \n20 community on probation, mandatory supervision, home confinement, and Post-Release \n21 Community Supervision (“PRCS”), all of whom are subject to being returned to the Jail at \n22 any time on an alleged violation or revocation of their supervision or to participate in civil \n23 or criminal court proceedings.  Due to Defendants’ policies and practices, all prisoners in \n24 Monterey County Jail are at risk of being harmed by violence from other prisoners.  Due to \n25 Defendants’ policies and practices, all prisoners at Monterey County Jail receive or are at \n26 substantial risk of receiving inadequate medical, dental, and mental health care. \n27 361.  The plaintiff class members are identifiable using records maintained in the \n28 ordinary course of business by Defendants. \n[1144098-2]    119 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page122 of 137\n \n1 Commonality:  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n2 362.  There are questions of law and fact common to the Prisoner Class, including, \n3 but not limited to: \n4 a.  Whether Defendants’ failure to protect prisoners from violence from \n5 other prisoners violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the \n6 Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the of the Eighth Amendment to the United \n7 States Constitution, and Article I, Sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution; \n8 b.  Whether Defendants’ failure to provide minimally adequate medical \n9 care to prisoners violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the \n10 Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States \n11 Constitution, and Article I, Sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution; and \n12 c.  Whether Defendants’ failure to provide minimally adequate mental \n13 health care to prisoners violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and \n14 the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States \n15 Constitution, and Article I, Sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution. \n16 363.  Defendants are expected to raise common defenses to these claims, including \n17 denying that their actions violate the law. \n18 Typicality:  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n19 364.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the members \n20 of the proposed class.  Plaintiffs and all other members of the class have sustained similar \n21 injuries arising out of and caused by Defendants’ common course of conduct and policies \n22 in violation of the law as alleged herein. \n23 Adequacy:  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n24 365.  Plaintiffs are members of the class and will fairly and adequately represent \n25 and protect the interests of the putative class members because they have no disabling \n26 conflict(s) of interest that would be antagonistic to those of the other class members.  \n27 Plaintiffs, as well as plaintiff class members, seek to enjoin the unlawful acts and \n28 omissions of Defendants.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel who are competent and \n[1144098-2]    120 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page123 of 137\n \n1 experienced in complex class action litigation and prisoner’s rights litigation. \n2 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A) and (B) \n3 366.  Since the number of class members is more than 900, separate actions by \n4 individuals could result in inconsistent and varying decisions, which in turn would result in \n5 conflicting and incompatible standards of conduct for Defendants. \n6 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \n7 367.  This action is also maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of \n8 Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) because Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds that \n9 apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory \n10 relief is appropriate respecting the class and will apply to all members of the class. \n11 Prisoners with Disabilities Subclass \n12 368.  All Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and, pursuant to Rule \n13 23(a), (b)(1), and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of a subclass of \n14 all qualified individuals with a disability, as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 \n15 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) and (m), and who are \n16 now, or will be in the future, incarcerated in Monterey County Jail (“Prisoners with \n17 Disabilities Subclass”).  All prisoners with disabilities who are incarcerated in the Jail are \n18 at risk of being discriminated against or denied access to programs, services and activities \n19 offered at the Jail as a result of the policies and practices of Defendants MONTEREY \n20 COUNTY, MONTEREY COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE, and CFMG (“Defendants”). \n21 Numerosity:  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n22 369.  The proposed subclass as defined is sufficiently numerous that joinder of all \n23 members of the subclass is impracticable and unfeasible.  The exact number of members of \n24 the Prisoners with Disabilities Subclass is unknown.  According to data regarding the \n25 incidence of disabilities among the general population, at least 30% of the prisoners in the \n26 Jail are qualified individuals with disabilities as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, \n27 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) and (m). \n28 370.

R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n3 371.  There are questions of law and fact common to the Prisoners with \n4 Disabilities Subclass, including, but not limited to:  Whether Defendants’ failure to \n5 reasonably accommodate prisoners with disabilities violates the Americans with \n6 Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and California Government Code \n7 § 11135. \n8 372.  Defendants are expected to raise common defenses to these claims, including \n9 denying that their actions violate the law. \n10 Typicality:  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n11 373.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the members \n12 of the proposed subclass.  Plaintiffs and all other members of the subclass have sustained \n13 similar injuries arising out of and caused by Defendants’ common course of conduct and \n14 policies in violation of the law as alleged herein. \n15 Adequacy:  Fed.

Plaintiffs are members of the subclass and will fairly and adequately \n17 represent and protect the interests of the putative subclass members because they have no \n18 disabling conflict(s) of interest that would be antagonistic to those of the other subclass \n19 members.

Plaintiffs have retained counsel \n21 who are competent and experienced in complex class action litigation and prisoner’s rights \n22 litigation. \n23 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A) and (B) \n24 375.  Since the subclass consists of more than 30% of the prisoner population in \n25 the Jail, separate actions by individuals could result in inconsistent and varying decisions, \n26 which in turn would result in conflicting and incompatible standards of conduct for \n27 Defendants. \n28\n[1144098-2]    122 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page125 of 137\n \n1 Fed.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations \n14 previously made in paragraphs 1 through 388, above. \n15 390.  The ADA prohibits public entities, including the COUNTY and the \n16 SHERIFF’S OFFICE from denying “a qualified individual with a disability … the benefits \n17 of the services, programs, or activities of [the] public entity” because of the individual’s \n18 disability.  42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n19 391.  Defendants MONTEREY COUNTY and SHERIFF’S OFFICE are legally \n20 responsible for all violations of the ADA committed by CFMG in the course of performing \n21 its duties under its contractual arrangement with the SHERIFF’S OFFICE to provide \n22 medical and mental health care services to prisoners in the Jail.  See 28 C.F.R. \n23 § 35.130(b)(1). \n24 392.  The ADA defines “a qualified individual with a disability” as a person who \n25 suffers from a “physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major \n26 life activities,” including, but not limited to, “caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, \n27 seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, \n28 learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.”  42 U.S.C. \n[1144098-2]    126 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page129 of 137\n \n1 § 12102(1)(A), (2)(A).  All Plaintiffs are qualified individuals with disabilities as defined \n2 in the ADA, as they have impairments that substantially limit one or more major life \n3 activities. \n4 393.  The programs, services, and activities that Defendants MONTEREY \n5 COUNTY and SHERIFF’S OFFICE provide to prisoners include, but are not limited to, \n6 sleeping, eating, showering, toileting, communicating with those outside the Jail by mail \n7 and telephone, exercising, entertainment, safety and security, the Jail’s administrative, \n8 disciplinary, and classification proceedings, medical, mental health, and dental services, \n9 the library, educational, vocational, substance abuse, and anger management classes, and \n10 discharge services.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations \n13 previously made in paragraphs 1 through 396, above. \n14 398.  Defendant CFMG is a public accommodation that owns, leases, leases to, or \n15 operates a professional office of a health care provider, hospital, or other service \n16 establishment within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(F), and Title III of the ADA’s \n17 implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 36.104. \n18 399.  Plaintiffs are all individuals with a disability and covered by Title III of the \n19 ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12102(1), 12182(b); 28 C.F.R. § 36.104. \n20 400.  By its policies and practices described above, Defendant CFMG violates \n21 Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181-12189, by discriminating against individuals \n22 with disabilities on the basis of disability, in the full and equal enjoyment of Defendant \n23 CFMG’s goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations.  42 U.S.C. \n24 § 12182(a); 28 C.F.R., Part 36. \n25 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the Prisoners with Disabilities Subclass they \n26 represent request relief as outlined below. \n27\n28\n[1144098-2]    129 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page132 of 137\n \n1 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \n2 (Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794) \n \n3 By Plaintiffs HERNANDEZ, AGUILAR, COBB, DILLEY, DOBBS, ESQUIVEL, \nGIST, GOMEZ, GREIM, GUYOT, HOBBS, HUNTER, KEY, MEFFORD, \n4 MILLER, MURPHY, NICHOLS, PEREZ, SARABI, WHITFIELD, and YANCEY \nand the Prisoners with Disabilities Subclass Against Defendants MONTEREY \n5 COUNTY and MONTEREY COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE \n6 401.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations \n7 previously made in paragraphs 1 through 400, above. \n8 402.  At all times relevant to this action, Defendants MONTEREY COUNTY and \n9 SHERIFF’S OFFICE were recipients of federal funding within the meaning of the \n10 Rehabilitation Act.  As recipients of federal funds, they are required to reasonably \n11 accommodate prisoners with disabilities in their facilities, program activities, and services, \n12 and to provide a grievance procedure. \n13 403.  Plaintiffs and the Prisoners with Disabilities Subclass they represent are \n14 qualified individuals with disabilities as defined in the Rehabilitation Act. \n15 404.  By their policy and practice of discriminating against and failing to \n16 reasonably accommodate prisoners with disabilities, Defendants MONTEREY COUNTY \n17 and SHERIFF’S OFFICE violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794. \n18 405.  As a result of Defendants MONTEREY COUNTY and SHERIFF’S \n19 OFFICE’s discriminating against and failing to provide a grievance procedure and \n20 reasonable accommodations, Plaintiffs and the Prisoners with Disabilities Subclass they \n21 represent do not have equal access to Jail activities, programs, and services for which they \n22 are otherwise qualified. \n23 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the Prisoners with Disabilities Subclass they \n24 represent request relief as outlined below. \n25\n26\n27\n28\n[1144098-2]    130 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page133 of 137\n \n1 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \n2 (Cal.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations \n8 previously made in paragraphs 1 through 405, above. \n9 407.  Defendants receive financial assistance from the State of California as part of \n10 Realignment Legislation, California Government Code §§ 30025, 30026, and 30029, and \n11 through other statutes and funding mechanisms.  Plaintiffs and the Prisoner with \n12 Disabilities Subclass they represent are all persons with disabilities within the meaning of \n13 California Government Code § 11135. \n14 408.  As described in this Complaint, Defendants deny Plaintiffs full access to the \n15 benefits of the Jail’s programs and activities which receive financial assistance from the \n16 State of California and unlawfully subject Plaintiffs and the Prisoners with Disabilities \n17 Subclass they represent to discrimination within the meaning of California Government \n18 Code § 11135(a) on the basis of their disabilities. \n19 409.  From February 2012 through October 2013, through their counsel and \n20 through grievances submitted to the Jail, Plaintiffs and the Prisoners with Disabilities \n21 Subclass they represent demanded that Defendants stop their unlawful discriminatory \n22 conduct described above, but Defendants refused and still refuse to refrain from that \n23 conduct. \n24 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the Prisoners with Disabilities Subclass they \n25 represent request relief as outlined below. \n26 PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n27 Plaintiffs and the class and subclass they represent have no adequate remedy at law \n28 to redress the wrongs suffered as set forth in this Second Amended Complaint.  Plaintiffs \n[1144098-2]    131 \nSECOND AMENDED CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document41   Filed04/11/14   Page134 of 137\n \n1 have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury as a result of the unlawful acts, \n2 omissions, policies, and practices of the Defendants as alleged herein, unless Plaintiffs are \n3 granted the relief they request.  Plaintiffs and Defendants have an actual controversy and \n4 opposing legal positions as to Defendants’ violations of the constitutions and laws of the \n5 United States and the State of California.  The need for relief is critical because the rights \n6 at issue are paramount under the constitutions and laws of the United States and the State \n7 of California. \n8 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs AGUILAR, COBB, DILLEY, DOBBS, ESQUIVEL, \n9 GIST, GOMEZ, GREIM, GUYOT, HERNANDEZ, HOBBS, HUNTER, KEY, \n10 MEFFORD, MILLER, MURPHY, NICHOLS, PEREZ, SARABI, WHITFIELD, and \n11 YANCEY, on behalf of themselves, the proposed class and subclass, and all others \n12 similarly situated, pray for judgment and the following specific relief against Defendants \n13 MONTEREY COUNTY, MONTEREY COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE, CALIFORNIA \n14 FORENSIC MEDICAL GROUP, and DOES 1 through 20 as follows: \n15 410.

The Court finds that the proposed settlement falls within the range of \n2 possible approval and is sufficiently fair to warrant the dissemination of notice to the class \n3 members apprising them of the settlement. \n4 2.  The proposed settlement is the product of arm’s-length, serious, informed \n5 and non-collusive negotiations between experienced and knowledgeable counsel who have \n6 actively prosecuted and defended this litigation. \n7 3.  The Settlement Agreement is granted preliminary approval and incorporated \n8 herein by this reference, and has the full force and effect of an order of the Court. \n9 4.  A hearing is appropriate to consider whether this Court should grant final \n10 approval to this settlement, and to allow adequate time for members of the class, or their \n11 counsel, to support or oppose this settlement. \n12 GOOD CAUSE APPEARING THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \n13 5.  This action is determined to be properly maintained as a class action \n14 pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The Court has already \n15 certified a class defined as “all adult men and women who are now, or will be in the future, \n16 incarcerated in the Monterey County Jail.”  The Court also certified a sub-class of “all \n17 qualified individuals with a disability, as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 \n18 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) and (m), and who are \n19 now, or will be in the future, incarcerated in the Monterey County Jail.”     \n20 6.  Within 7 days after this Order granting Preliminary Approval, the written \n21 notice of settlement (the “Notice”) shall be disseminated to the Class, substantially in the \n22 form attached as Exhibit B to the Declaration of Ernest Galvan accompanying the \n23 Stipulated Motion by the following means:  (1) For the benefit of all class and sub-class \n24 members, written Notices shall be posted throughout the Monterey County Jail, in the \n25 same locations within the Jail that the Parties agreed class certification notices were to be \n26 placed.  (2) Copies of the Settlement Agreement shall be available in the Jail library and \n27 made available to Jail inmates upon request.  (3) Inmates under the custody of the \n28 Monterey County Sheriff’s Office who reside at other locations (such as Natividad \n[2705980-1]    1\n[PROPOSED] ORDER  \n \n\nCCaassee55:1:133-c-cvv-0-022335544-P-PSSGG     D Dooccuummeennt4t48835-4     F Fileiledd0055/1/154/1/155     P Paaggee33 o of f5 5\n \n1 Medical Center or the jail in Alameda County) shall be sent the Notice by first class mail \n2 to their last known address, or shall be provided with the notice in person by custodial \n3 staff.  (4) The Notice and the Settlement Agreement shall be posted on the website of the \n4 Monterey County Sheriff’s Office and made available for public review and downloading.  \n5 The notice informs class members that there is no right to opt-out of the class.  The Court \n6 certified a Rule 23(b)(2) class in which the class seeks “‘uniform relief from a practice \n7 applicable to all of them,’” rather than “damages or relief for any specific Plaintiff.”  (Dkt. \n8 No. 431 at 48.)

The Monterey County Jail complex in Salinas, California (the \"Jail\") is\n3 broken in every way. Severe overcrowding, outdated facilities, and chronic understaffing\n4 have created dangerous conditions in the Jail, placing prisoners and staff at serious risk of\n5 injury and death. Violent incidents between prisoners occur regularly, often resulting in\n6 grave injuries that require medical treatment and even hospitalization. Prisoners in the\n7 Jail, many of whom are pre-trial detainees or charged with violations of parole or\n8 probation, receive woefully inadequate medical care, including significant delays in\n9'. evaluation and treatment, failure to provide necessary procedures, discontinuation of\n10 needed medications, and poor post-operative follow up care. Mental health care at the Jail\n11 is similarly deficient and lacking in sufficient use of therapy and provision of psycho-\n12 tropic medications. When such medications are prescribed, they are provided to prisoners\n13 ~ in an inconsistent and ineffective manner. Defendants lack adequate policies to identify\n14 and supervise prisoners who are at risk for suicide, relying instead on the disturbing\n15 practice of placing such prisoners in isolation rooms called \"rubber rooms.\" These \"rubber\n16 rooms\" lack any furniture or features save for a grate in the floor which serves as a toilet.\n17 In the last three years alone, there have been three completed and more than a dozen\n18 attempted suicides at the Jail. Defendants also fail to provide reasonable accommoda-\n19 tions to prisoners with disabilities, including the denial of sign language interpreters to\n20 prisoners with hearing impairments, failure to provide canes and walkers to prisoners with\n21 mobility impairments, and placement in inaccessible and dangerous housing units and\n22 bathrooms.\n23 2.  Defendants' failures to protect prisoners from violence, to provide minimally\n24 adequate medical and mental health care, and to accommodate prisoners with disabilities\n25 are particularly egregious given that Defendants have been aware of these problems and\n26 their causes for years and yet failed to take the necessary actions to ameliorate the\n27 unconstitutional conditions. In 2007, the County commissioned athird-party evaluation of\n28 the Jail, which resulted in a report, dated June 19, 2007, entitled \"County of Monterey,\n[716216-20]\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page4 of 74\n1 Office of the Sheriff, Needs Assessment.\" The 2007 report concluded that \"[t]he current\n2 combination of insufficient beds, an inadequate detention facility and understaffing has\n3 resulted in an almost untenable situation.\" In 2011, the County asked the third-party\n4 consultant to update the 2007 report to reflect amendments to state law and changes within\n5 the Sheriff's Office and the Jail population. This updated report, dated December 30,\n6 2011, reached the exact same, word-for-word conclusion: \"The current combination of\n7 insufficient beds, an inadequate detention facility and understaffing has resulted in an\n8 almost untenable situation.\" County of Monterey, Office of the Sheriff, Jail Needs\n9 Assessment, December 30, 2011 (hereinafter, \"2011 Jail Needs Assessment\" or\n10 \"Assessment\"), at Ex. 2. The situation that was deemed \"untenable\" in December 2011\n11 appears only to have worsened in the last year and half, despite Defendants' knowledge of\n12 the risks this situation poses. Defendants' deliberate indifference to prisoners' safety,\n13 medical and mental health, and disability needs is unconscionable, and must be stopped to\n14 prevent additional unnecessary loss of life, pain, and suffering.\n15 3.  This civil rights class action lawsuit seeks to remedy the profoundly\n16 dangerous, wasteful, overcrowded, discriminatory, and unconstitutional conditions in the\n17 Jail. The Plaintiffs—five prisoners detained in the Jail—bring this action against the\n18 Defendants—the County of Monterey, the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, and the\n19 California Forensic Medical Groupon behalf of themselves and those similarly situated.\n20 4.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief under the United States and\n21 California Constitutions against Defendants' deliberate indifference to the exceedingly\n22 high levels of inmate violence in the Jail. The causes of the violence—understaffing,\n23 overcrowded housing units, antiquated and poorly designed Jail facilities, and an\n24 inadequate prisoner classification system—are well-known to and tolerated by Defendants.\n25 Violent incidents between prisoners occur with alarming frequency and in nearly every\n26 area of the Jail. According to Defendants' own incident reports from 2011 and January to\n27 ~~ early-September 2012, there were more than 150 separate incidents of violence between\n28 prisoners. In more than 100 of these incidents, at least one prisoner required some medical\n[716216-20]\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page5 of 74\n1 treatment. Violent incidents were reported in 26 out of 29 housing units. Violence at the\n2 Jail is not an anomaly; it is a way of life. Forcing prisoners to live under ongoing threats\n3 of serious bodily injury is cruel and inhumane, especially when Defendants have the ability\n4 to prevent and reduce such violence.\n5 5.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief under the United States and\n6 ~ California Constitutions against Defendants' deliberate indifference to their failure to\n7 ~ provide prisoners with minimally adequate medical care. Monterey County outsources the\n8 ~ provision of medical care to prisoners in the Jail to California Forensic Medical Group\n9 (~  \"CFMG\"), a private corporation, which provides deficient medical care in nearly every\n10 respect. Prisoners are not adequately screened for serious medical problems upon arrival\n11 at the Jail, and Defendants lack an effective system for requesting care. When prisoners do\n12 receive care, it is often after a delay of weeks or even months. The medical care staff\n13 employed by CFMG are insufficient in number to care for the more than 1,100 prisoners in\n14, the severely overcrowded Jail. Both prisoners who arrive at the Jail with existing medical\n15 care needs and those who develop conditions in the Jail fail to receive timely or\n16 appropriate treatment, resulting in unnecessary and prolonged pain, suffering, and\n17 worsening of their conditions. As a result of Defendants' failure to provide minimally\n18 adequate medical care, Defendants are deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of\n19 harm faced by all prisoners.\n20 6.  Plaintiffs also seek declaratory and injunctive relief under the United States\n21 ~ and California Constitutions against Defendants' deliberate indifference to their failure to\n22 provide prisoners with minimally adequate mental health care. Monterey County also\n23 outsources the provision of mental health care to prisoners in the Jail to CFMG, which\n24 provides deficient mental health care in nearly every respect. Prisoners are not adequately\n25 screened for serious mental health problems upon arrival at the Jail. Defendants lack an\n26 effective system for prisoners to request care. When prisoners do receive mental health\n27 care, it is often after a delay of weeks or even months, and may not include therapy. Both\n28 prisoners who arrive at the Jail with existing mental health concerns and those who\n~r,s2,s-zoo  I  3\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page6 of 74\n1 develop conditions in the Jail rarely receive appropriate treatment. Defendants' approach\n2 to prisoners with serious mental health problems (including suicidality) involves placing\n3 such prisoners in unsanitary rubber rooms, which only exacerbates and prolongs their\n4 already dire mental health crises. As a result of Defendants' failure to provide minimally\n5 adequate mental health care, Defendants are deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk\n6 of harm faced by all prisoners.\n~I 7.  Under the Americans with Disabilities Act( \"ADA\"), Section 504 of the\n8 ~ Rehabilitation Act( \"Rehabilitation Act\"), California Government Code Section 11135,\n9 and the United States and California Constitutions, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and\n10 injunctive relief against Monterey County, the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, and\n11 CFMG as a remedy for Defendants' systemic and willful discrimination against and failure\n12 to provide reasonable accommodations to prisoners in the Jail who have disabilities.\n13 8.  Defendants lack adequate policies and practices for accurately identifying\n14 and tracking prisoners with disabilities and the accommodations those prisoners require.\n15 Defendants have no adequate administrative grievance process available to prisoners to\n16 request reasonable accommodations. Defendants do not provide effective communication\n17 or basic and reasonable accommodations, such as sign language interpreting services and\n18 hearing aids, to prisoners with hearing, speech and other communication impairments,\n19 even for critical interactions with Jail staff, including for disciplinary hearings and medical\n20 and mental health appointments. Many areas of the Jail are physically inaccessible to\n21 prisoners with disabilities, both because Defendants refuse to permit prisoners to possess\n22 needed assistive devices and fail to house prisoners with disabilities in accessible parts of\n23 the Jail. Defendants' systemic failure to accommodate prisoners with disabilities results in\n24 ~~ the widespread exclusion of prisoners with disabilities from many of the programs,\n25 services and activities offered by the Jail, including health care services, exercise, religious\n26 services, sleeping, and educational and vocational programs. Moreover, Defendants' lack\n27 of adequate policies and procedures makes prisoners with disabilities vulnerable to\n28 exploitation and violence by other prisoners and increases their risk of serious injury or\np,sz,s-zoo  I  4\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page7 of 74\n1 death.\n2 9.  As a remedy for the statutory and constitutional violations described herein,\n3 ~ Plaintiffs seek a declaration that Defendants are violating federal and state law and an\n4 injunction compelling Defendants to provide prisoners with adequate protection from\n5 violence and assault from other prisoners, to provide prisoners with adequate medical and\n6 mental health care, and to provide reasonable accommodations to and cease discriminating\n7 against prisoners with disabilities.\n8, JURISDICTION\n9 10.  This Court has jurisdiction over the claims brought under federal law\n10 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. This Court has jurisdiction over the claims\n11 brought under California law pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and\n12 injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 2201, and 2202, 29 U.S.C. § 794a, 42 U.S.C.\n13 §§ 1983 and 12117(a), California Government Code § 11135, and Article 1, §§ 7 and 17 of\n14 the California Constitution.\n15 VENUE\n16 11.  Venue is properly in this Court, pursuant to Title 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1), in\n17 that Plaintiffs' claims for relief arose in this District and one or all of the Defendants reside\n18 in this District.\n19 PARTIES\n20 12.  PLAINTIFF JESSE HERNANDEZ was detained at Monterey County Jail on\n21 April 28, 2012. Prior to his incarceration, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ underwent a colostomy.\n22 Despite his repeated requests over an eight-month period for colostomy reversal surgery,\n23 Defendants provided untimely and inadequate medical care, including, but not limited to\n24 repeated failures to remove the colostomy bag and failures to transfer Plaintiff\n25 HERNANDEZ to a medical facility that would perform the surgery. Even after Plaintiff\n26 HERNANDEZ finally received the colostomy reversal surgery in December 2012,\n27 Defendants failed to provide adequate medical care, including, but not limited to proper\n28 post-operative follow-up care. As a result of Defendants' delayed and inadequate medical\n~is2is-2o~  5\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page8 of 74\n1 care, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ has suffered from unnecessary and avoidable pain and\n2 symptoms, including, but not limited to intestinal swelling, bleeding, severe stomach pain,\n3 fevers, cold sweats, and obstructed bowels. Plaintiff HERNANDEZ is a person with a\n4 disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California\n5 Government Code § 12926(1).\n6 13.

His primary method of communication is American Sign\n10' Language Plaintiff YANCEY ordinarily is somewhat able to communicate in a limited\n11 manner using written notes; however, for much of his time in the Jail, his right hand was in\n12 a cast, making it difficult and painful for him to write legibly. Despite multiple requests,\n13 Plaintiff YANCEY did not receive reasonable accommodations from Defendants to allow\n14 him to access the programs and services offered by the Jail. Defendants never provided\n15 Plaintiff YANCEY with a sign language interpreter at any time during his time in the Jail.\n16 Plaintiff YANCEY is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C.\n17 § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(1).\n18 14.  PLAINTIFF RICHARD MURPHY was detained at Monterey County Jail on\n19 ~ ~ January 18, 2013. Plaintiff MURPHY has a mobility impairment and requires a cane or\n20 walker to ambulate without significant pain. Despite repeated requests, Plaintiff\n21 MURPHY has not received reasonable accommodations from Defendants to allow him to\n22 walk without pain, and to access the programs and services offered by the Jail. Plaintiff\n23 MURPHY also has nerve damage in his back, and requires pain medication as well as\n24 cortisone shots. Despite his repeated requests, Plaintiff MURPHY has not received timely\n25 or adequate medical care, including but not limited to, necessary medications at the Jail.\n26 Plaintiff MURPHY has been diagnosed with mental illness and has been prescribed and\n27 requires various prescription psychiatric medications to treat his illness and alleviate his\n28 symptoms. Despite repeated requests, Defendants have failed to provide timely and\np,sz,s-zoo  I  ~\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page9 of 74\n1 ~ appropriate mental health care, including, but not limited to, the failure to provide correct\n2 dosages of the medications Plaintiff MURPHY requires and the failure to adequately\n3 monitor the administration of medications. As a result, Plaintiff MURPHY is experiencing\n4 ~ unnecessary and avoidable pain and symptoms, including, but not limited to, hearing\n5 ~ voices, seeing shadows, depression and suicidality, and inability to sleep more than a few\n6 ~ hours per night. Plaintiff MURPHY is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C.\n7 ~ § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(j) and (1).\n8 15.  PLAINTIFF SARAB SARABI was detained at Monterey County Jail on\n9, February 2, 2013. Plaintiff SARABI has a mobility impairment as a result of a serious\n10 injury he sustained to his right leg when he was attacked by another inmate at the Jail.\n11 Plaintiff SARABI did not receive timely or adequate medical care for his injury. Plaintiff\n12 SARABI has sustained nerve damage, and must use crutches to walk. Despite Plaintiff\n13 ~ SARABI's requests, Defendants have not provided Plaintiff SARABI with reasonable or\n14 appropriate accommodations to allow him to walk without falling, or to access the\n15 programs and services offered by the Jail. Plaintiff SARABI is a person with a disability\n16 as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code\n17 § 12926(1).\n18 16.  PLAINTIFF GLENDA HUNTER was detained at Monterey County Jail on\n19 March 16, 2013. Plaintiff HUNTER has been diagnosed with numerous medical\n20 conditions, including diabetes, fibromyalgia, high blood pressure, chronic back pain, bone\n21 cancer, and seizures, and she has been prescribed and requires various medications to treat\n22 her illnesses and alleviate her symptoms. Despite repeated requests, Defendants have\n23 failed to provide timely and appropriate medical care, including, but not limited to, failing\n24 to provide.P laintiff HiTNTER with necessary prescription medications. Plaintiff WINTER\n25 has also been diagnosed with mental illness, including manic depression, dementia, anxiety\n26 and panic attacks.

The SHERIFF'S  OFFICE is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the\n24 ~~ Jail facilities, including promulgating policies and procedures for the operation of the\n25 facilities. The SHERIFF'S  OFFICE has contracted with CFMG to provide all health care\n26 ~~ services in the Jail, but by law retains the ultimate authority over and any responsibility for\n27 the health care, treatment, and safekeeping of Plaintiffs and the class they seek to\n28 represent. The SHERIFF'S  OFFICE employs 50 or more persons.\np,s ~,s -2o~\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page11 of 74\n1 19.  DEFENDANT CFMG is a corporation organized under the laws of the State\n2 of California and operating under a contract with the SHERIFF'S  OFFICE to provide\n3 health care services to prisoners in the Jail, including medical and mental health care. The\n4 current contract extends from April 1, 2012 through June 30, 2015. At all times when\n5 CFMG and its employees provide medical and mental health care to prisoners in the Jail,\n6 CFMG and its employees have acted and continue to act under color of state law. CFMG\n7 employs 50 or more persons.\n8 20.  Plaintiffs are ignorant of the true names and capacities of defendants sued in\n9 this complaint as DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore sue these defendants by\n10 such fictitious names. Plaintiffs will amend this complaint to allege their true names and\n11 capacities when ascertained. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that\n12 each of the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the\n13 occurrences, and the discrimination against Plaintiffs, alleged in this complaint.\n14 21.  At all times mentioned in this complaint, each Defendant was the agent of\n15 the others, was acting within the course and scope of this agency, and all acts alleged to\n16 have been committed by any one of them was committed on behalf of every other\n17 Defendant.\n18 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n19 Plaintiff Prisoner Class\n20 22.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and, pursuant to Rule 23(a),\n21 (b)(1), and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of all others similarly\n22 situated. Plaintiffs bring the claims articulated herein on behalf of all adult men and\n23 women who are now, or will be in the future, incarcerated in Monterey County Jail\n24 (\"Prisoner Class\"). All prisoners are at risk of substantial harm due to the following\n25 policies and practices:\n26 a.  Denial of protection from injury and violence from other prisoners,\n27 b.  Denial of minimally adequate medical care,\n28 c.  Denial of minimally adequate mental health care,\n[716216-20]  II  (~\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page12 of 74\n1 d.  Denial of reasonable accommodations and equal access to programs\n2 and services.\n3 23.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class, including:\n4 a.  Whether Defendants' failure to protect prisoners from violence from\n5 other prisoners violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the\n6 Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the of the Eighth Amendment to the United\n7 States Constitution, and Article 1, Sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution;\n8 b.  Whether Defendants' failure to provide minimally adequate medical\n9 care to prisoners violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the\n10 Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States\n11 Constitution, and Article 1, Sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution; and\n12 c.  Whether Defendants' failure to provide minimally adequate mental\n13 health care to prisoners violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and\n14 the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States\n15 Constitution, and Article 1, Sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution;\n16 d.  Whether Defendants' failure to ensure that prisoners are able to\n17 communicate effectively with medical and mental health care staff violates the Due\n18 ~ Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n19 Clause of the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Sections\n20 7 and 17 of the California Constitution;\n21 e.  Whether Defendants' failure to ensure that prisoners are able to access\n22 all programs and services at the Jail and communicate effectively during classification,\n23 disciplinary hearings, and all programs and services, including chapel, law library,\n24 education and visiting, violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the\n25 Rehabilitation Act, and Government Code Section 11135; and\n26 £  Whether Defendants' failure to reasonably accommodate prisoners\n27 with disabilities violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the\n28 Rehabilitation Act, and Government Code Section 11135.\n[716216-20)\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page13 of 74\n1 24.  The proposed class as defined is sufficiently numerous that joinder of all\n2 members of the class is impracticable and unfeasible. There are currently more than 1,150\n3 prisoners in the Jail. All prisoners at the Jail are at risk of injury and violence from other\n4 prisoners as a result of Defendants' deliberate indifference toward violence in the Jail. All\n5 prisoners are at risk of developing serious medical or mental health conditions or\n6 disabilities while in the Jail, and while the exact number is unknown, Plaintiffs believe\n7 there are hundreds of prisoners at any given time who already have serious medical and/or\n8 mental health conditions and/or disabilities.\n9 25.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the members\n10 of the proposed class. Plaintiffs and all other members of the class have sustained similar\n11 injuries arising out of and caused by Defendants' common course of conduct in violation\n12 ~ of the law as alleged herein.\n13 26.  Plaintiffs are members of the class and will fairly and adequately represent\n14 and protect the interests of the putative class members because they have no disabling\n15 ~ conflict(s) of interest that would be antagonistic to those of the other class members.\n16 ~ Plaintiffs have retained counsel who are competent and experienced in complex class\n17 action litigation.\n18 27.  Since the number of class members is more than 1,000, separate actions by\n19 ~I ~ individuals would in all likelihood result in inconsistent and varying decisions, which in\n20 turn would result in conflicting and incompatible standards of conduct for the Defendants.\n21 28.  Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds that apply generally to\n22~~ the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate\n23 respecting the class.\n24 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n25III DEFENDANTS FAIL TO PROTECT PRISONERS FROM INJURY OR\nVIOLENCE FROM OTHER PRISONERS\n26\n27 29.  Defendants have created a jail environment in which prisoners in all areas of\n28~~ the Jail face a substantial risk of being injured and intimidated by violence from other\n[116216-20]\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page14 of 74\n1 prisoners. Defendants have been aware of these risks since at least 2007, when the\n2 SHERIFF'S OFFICE and the Monterey County Board of Supervisors contracted with TRG\n3 Consulting to produce a needs assessment for the Jail. TRG Consulting completed its\n4 report, entitled County of Monterey, Office of the Sheriff, Needs Assessment (hereinafter,\n5 \"2007 Needs Assessment\"), on June 19, 2007. The Monterey County Board of\n6 Supervisors explicitly accepted the report that same day by unanimous vote. In the report,\n7 TRG acknowledged that \"this needs assessment would not have been possible without the\n8 assistance of a number of professionals from Monterey County,\" and specifically\n9 recognized a number of people \"who helped make this planning effort a success.\" Among\n10 the people listed are two current members Monterey County Board of Supervisors, former\n11 Sheriff-Coroner-Marshall Mike Kanalakis, former Undersheriff Nancy Cuffney, and\n12' former Custody Bureau Chief, Bert Liebersbach.\n13 30.  Upon information and belief, in 2011, Sheriff Scott Miller requested that\n14 TRG Consulting update the 2007 Needs Assessment. As a result, TRG Consulting\n15 produced the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment, dated December 30, 2011. Upon information\n16 and belief, the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment was transmitted to Sheriff Miller and other\n17 officials in Monterey County on or around December 30, 2011. In the 2011 Jail Needs\n18 Assessment, TRG Consulting recognized by name \"the primary contributors who helped\n19 make this planning effort a success.\" Assessment at 1. The list includes all five members\n20 of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, all of whom remain in their elected\n21 positions as of the filing of this complaint. The list also includes Sheriff Miller and former\n22 Custody Bureau Chief Jeffrey J. Budd.\n23 31.  Both the 2007 Needs Assessment and the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment\n24 ~~ concluded that, \"[t]he current combination of insufficient beds, an inadequate detention\n25 facility and understaffing has resulted in an almost untenable situation.\" Assessment at\n26 Ex. 2. Both reports find that the conditions in the Jail and policies and practices of the\n27 SHERIFF'S  OFFICE create an unreasonable risk of violence between prisoners. The\n28 situation that was untenable in December 2011 appears to have only worsened in the last\np16216-20]  I I  ~ 2\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page15 of 74\n1 ~ year and a half. Because Defendants are aware of the unreasonable risk of violence and\n2 ~ have not acted to reduce the risk, Defendants are deliberately indifferent to the danger of\n3 ~ assault faced by all prisoners.\n4 A.  Defendants' Deliberate Understaffing of the Jail Creates an\nEnvironment in Which Violence Flourishes\n5\n6' 32.  Defendants staff the Jail in a manner that makes it impossible for Defendants\n7 ~ to keep prisoners safe from assault from other prisoners. For the past few years the Jail has\n8 routinely housed more than 1,100 prisoners. Defendants generally staff the Jail with as\n9 few as 24 and no more than 26 officers. A significant number of officers are required to\n10 staff other areas of the Jail, like the booking area, visitor processing areas, and kitchen.\n11 Thus, usually no more than a handful of officers are responsible for directly supervising\n12 most of the more than 1,10'0 prisoners in the jail. The current authorized staffing for the\n13 Jail has been described as \"woefully inadequate.\" Assessment at Ex. 7.\n14 33.  The minimum staffing plan utilized by the SHERIFF'S OFFICE does not\n15 ~ provide for a sufficient number of officers to safely operate the Jail. As the 2011 Jail\n16 Needs Assessment explained, \"[i]t appears that the staffing provided by the County salary\n17 ordinance is based on the rated capacity of[ the Jail], not on how many inmates are actually\n18 in custody.\" Assessment at Ex. 6. Currently, the population in the Jail is 33% above the\n19 facility's rated capacity.\n20 34.  Though the staffing plan being used by Defendants is not sufficient on its\n21 ~~ face, Defendants have not even hired staff to fill all of the authorized positions. As the\n22 2011 Jail Needs Assessment stated, \"[v]acancies, extended periods of leave, and normal\n23 staff attrition have resulted in a significant amount of vacant ... positions. The jail has an\n24 increased reliance on overtime to meet minimum staffing.\" Assessment at Ex. 7.\n25 35.  The 2011 Jail Needs Assessment noted that \"[b]aseline staffing should be\n26~~ above minimum staffing,\" but \"[d]ue to vacancies and other factors, the Monterey County\n27 Jail constantly is using overtime to staff up to their self-imposed minimum staffing. This\n28 level is not adequate to provide basic safety and security for staff and inmates.\"\n[116216-20]\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page16 of 74\n1 Assessment at Ex. 7( bolded emphasis added).\n2 36.  Typically, staff in the Jail work 12-hour shifts. Because of the insufficient\n3 staff employed by the Jail, Defendants often utilize a system of mandatory overtime, where\n4 staff are required to work an additional four hours before or after their 12-hour shifts to\n5 cover a vacancy during another shift. This dangerous practice may result in staff being\n6 e~austed, unfocused, and unable to properly handle the duties required of them.\n7 Moreover, even when mandatory overtime is used, the extra 4 hours of coverage on either\n8 end of a 12-hour shift leaves a 4-hour gap uncovered in the middle of the shift. As the\n9 2011 Jail Needs Assessment explained, \"[u]nderstaffing has resulted in insufficient staff\n10 coverage.... At times the middle of a shift may be as many as three or four officers short.\n11 This has been exacerbated by recent staff reductions. As a result there are not enough\n12 officers present in the jail to respond to a major crisis or natural disaster.... There are\n13 insufficient staff on some shifts to make the required safety checks.\" Assessment at Ex. 3.\n14 Clearly, the staffing at the Jail is not adequate to keep prisoners safe.\n15 37.  The staff shortages are particularly acute in the housing units and for escort\n16 officers. As described in the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment,\" [a] review of the current\n17 staffing pattern as practiced by the Monterey County Jail and the best practices staffing\n18 plan included in the 2006 Staffing Analysis indicates that the critical needs are for the extra\n19 staffing in the housing units and for facility-wide escort deputies. These positions will\n20 ensure required safety checks are made, there is some level of supervision in the kitchen,\n21 laundry and medical areas and adequate staffing is available to respond to emergencies and\n22 unusual situations. Recent cuts in staffing have made this situation much worse ....\"\n23 Assessment at Ex. 7.\n24 38.  For example, when Plaintiff SARABI was attacked by another prisoner, the\n25 other prisoner hit him 10-15 times with a fist in Plaintiff SARABI's head and legs,\n26 knocking him unconscious. The two guards who were supposed to be monitoring the\n27 dorm did not intervene or otherwise attempt to stop the attack. Plaintiff SARABI's only\n28 recollection of guard involvement was when he awoke from his unconscious state as he\np~s2,s-2o~\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page17 of 74\n1 was being dragged by a guard to a holding room, well after the attack had finished.\n2 39.  The severe understaffing creates a high risk of violence any time inmates are\n3 escorted out of their housing units and in the presence of inmates from incompatible\n4 classifications. In an incident report, a deputy described visiting as a \"time of disorder\"\n5 with the deputy expected to maintain order \"with as many as 9-18 inmates filing into three\n6 rooms,\" even though \"differing and often conflicting classifications [are] present at the\n7 same time.\" In the visiting area, lock-down inmates are moved as a group and are\n8 unsecured. On April 1, 2012, according to an incident report prepared by employees of the\n9 SHERIFF'S OFFICE, three or four prisoners classified as Administrative Segregation-\n10 Sophisticated Sureno forced their way into an unlocked room of Administrative\n11 Segregation-Sensitive Needs prisoners. The Sophisticated Sureno prisoners were leaving\n12 the visiting area as the Sensitive Needs prisoners were arriving. One deputy failed to lock\n13 the visiting room door to secure the Sensitive Needs prisoners, because it would have\n14 forced him to lose visual contact with another deputy who was responsible for escorting\n15 the seven Administrative Segregation-Sophisticated Sureno prisoners out of the visiting\n16 area. Three or four of the Sureno prisoners rushed past the deputies and into the unlocked\n17 room. Then, one prisoner blocked the visiting room door while the others assaulted a\n18 prisoner inside the room and outside of the deputies' sight. The deputies let the assault\n19 continue until back-up arrived. In addition, according to another incident report prepared\n20 by employees of the SHERIFF'S  OFFICE, in February 2012, two Norteno gang members\n21 assaulted an inmate while being escorted through the Rehabilitation Infirmary.\n22 40.  Upon information and belief, Defendants do not adequately train custody\n23 ~ ~ staff in how to prevent and appropriately respond to prisoner violence. Such training is of\n24 even greater import given the chronic understaffing at the Jail.\n25 B.  The Jail Is Severely Overcrowded, But Defendants Have Not Utilized\nAvailable Solutions to Ameliorate the Problem\n26\n27 41.  The Jail is severely overcrowded. The Jail has a rated capacity for 829\n28 ~~ prisoners, but has in the recent past housed as many as 1,200 prisoners, nearly 150 percent\n[716216-20]\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page18 of 74\n1 of capacity. The Jail population has not dropped below 1,000 prisoners in many years.\n2 ~ Some areas of the Jail are considerably more overcrowded than the Jail as a whole,\n3 especially the women's section.\n4 42.  The Jail has been so overcrowded that for many years now, Monterey\n5 County applies on a monthly basis to the Superior Court for the County of Monterey for an\n6 order to release prisoners on an accelerated basis pursuant to California Penal Code section\n7 4024.1. To support the application, the former Chief Deputy Sheriff for the County swore\n8 on multiple occasions that unless the Jail is able to release some inmates, the overcrowding\n9 in the Jail would \"compromise[] the inmate classification plan as well as the safety and\n10 security of the detention facilities.\" In addition, in support of the application, Dr. Taylor\n11 Fithian (Director of Defendant CFMG)\" advised that the excessive number of inmates\n12 housed in the Jail compromises the health of the inmates and the staff working at the\n13 facility.\"\n14 43.  Defendants also admitted to the dangerously overcrowded conditions in\n15 public statements regarding potential new jail construction. As recently as October 5,\n16 2012, in a press release, Monterey County Sheriff Miller stated that \"[o]vercrowding has\n17 been a serious problem at the jail for many years, creating a dangerous situation for\n18 inmates, jail staff and the community.\"\n19 44.  The severe overcrowding was also identified in the 2011 Jail Needs\n20 Assessment. Specifically, the Assessment found that \"[t]here are not enough beds to meet\n21 ~~ the current adult detention needs, let alone the needs in the near future....The jail is so\n22 overcrowded that no allowance can be made for peaking and classification or the routine or\n23 emergency maintenance required in inmate housing areas. Severe overcrowding has\n24 resulted in inmates being held in the intake area for up to forty-eight hours. This is not\n25 permitted by the California Code of Regulations. Severe overcrowding has forced the\n26 Sheriff to use areas for housing that were not designed or intended for that use (e.g., the\n27 rotunda area). This makes these areas much more difficult for officers to manage and\n28 control. Overcrowding has forced the Sheriff to operate the jail as an indirect supervision\n~,sz,s-zoo  II \n1 h\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page19 of 74\n1 ~ facility, while the jail was designed for direct supervision. This creates significant\n2 ~ command, control and management problems.\" Assessment at Ex. 2.\n3 45.  The 2011 Jail Needs Assessment further noted that \"[o]vercrowding creates a\n4 number of issues that affect staff and inmates, and put the County at risk. Overcrowding\n5 ~ causes stress on both inmates and staff. Inmate vs. inmate assaults typically occur more\n6 frequently, as do other disciplinary infractions.\" Assessment at Ex. 9.\n7 46.  Despite the profound and persistent overcrowding, Defendants have not\n8 availed themselves of numerous available opportunities to safely relieve the population\n9 pressures in the Jail. For example, Defendants have failed to utilize any form of pre-trial\n10 risk assessment for all but a handful of detained defendants, have refused to expand\n11 capacity for their existing work release program for sentenced individuals, and have failed\n12 to investigate opportunities for collaboration between agencies and to expand their\n13 capacity to supervise individuals on mandatory community supervision as part of a split\n14 sentence. Defendants have also failed to implement alternatives to incarceration found\n15 safe and effective in other jurisdictions, including but not limited to diversion and use of\n16 home and GPS monitoring.\n17 C.  The Jail's Physical Structure is Inadequate, Makes It More Difficult for\nStaff to Safely Monitor Prisoners, and Increases the Risk of Inmate\n18 Violence\n19 47.  The Jail, which consists of two primary buildings—the Rehabilitation Center\n20 ~ ~ and the Main Jail Building—constructed over the past 42 years, is a patchwork of\n21 makeshift spaces, thrown together to keep up with Monterey's fast-growing Jail\n22 population. Throughout the housing units and other spaces, there are numerous blind spots\n23 ~~ where staff cannot safely monitor prisoners. As found in the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment,\n24 \"[t]he design of the jail and the manner in which additions have been constructed results in\n25 aphysical plant that is difficult to manage and control and unnecessarily expensive to\n26 operate.... There is poor observation from most deputy stations. Officers cannot observe\n27 ~~ inmates areas in Pods A through J. The wing walls in the dormitories are approximately\n28 four feet high and provide a number of areas where inmates cannot be observed. The\n~,s 2,s -~o~\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page20 of 74\nl~~ manner in which additions have been constructed has resulted in a facility that lacks any\n2 real central control or command post that would be used in the event of a major\n3 disturbance or disaster.\" Assessment at Ex. 2.\n4 48.  The 2011 Jail Needs Assessment further noted that \"visual supervision is\n5 problematic in the existing jail,\" and \"[a]t best there is intermittent observation of the\n6 inmates. In the Rehabilitation Facility, a Deputy Sheriff must walk into the inmate\n7 housing area to see the entire living and shower area. It appears there is an attempt to\n8 remedy the problem with the use of cameras. Unfortunately, this is not working.\"\n9 Assessment at Ex. 8. These physical limitations, especially when combined with the\n10 severe understaffing and overcrowding in the Jail, compromise the safety and security of\n11 staff, visitors, volunteers and inmates.\n12 49.  Upon information and belief, on or around April 29, 2013, the Jail was under\n13 lockdown due to several beatings in the K-Pod. These beatings took place behind a pillar\n14 in the K-Pod that blocks the view of Jail staff( both from camera and window\n15 perspectives). Upon information and belief, one prisoner was injured so badly in these\n16 beatings that he was airlifted out of the Jail and taken to a hospital in San Jose where he\n17 received treatment for a cracked skull.\n18 50.  According to incident reports prepared by employees of the SHERIFF'S \n19 OFFICE, cell doors in many pods throughout the jail can be easily popped open by\n20 prisoners, allowing prisoners to leave their cells without authorization at any time. This\n21 includes cell doors in lockdown units that house active gang members. Numerous incident\n22 reports recount assaults on prisoners who are on their authorized out-of-cell time or are in\n23 a unit for kitchen work, times when all other prisoners should be locked in their cells. In\n24 one example, an inmate on his out-of-cell hour in a lockdown unit told a nearby deputy\n25 who was passing out medication with a nurse that particular inmates in his unit were\n26 planning to \"pop\" their doors to fight him. Before the deputy could get back-up or enter\n27 the unit himself, two cell doors were \"popped,\" and two inmates chased the first inmate\n28 into a cell on the top tier to assault him,j ust as he had predicted.\n[716216-20~\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page21 of 74\n1 51.  As another example from an incident report prepared by an employee of the\n2 SHERIFF'S  OFFICE, a prisoner housed in G-Pod was recently assaulted by another\n3 prisoner in the pod. G-Pod is a celled housing unit, meaning all prisoners are housed in\n4 ~ cells with doors. Prior to the assault, the prisoner had informed the classification unit that\n5 the assailant had been threatening him, had demonstrated to the prisoner that the assailant\n6 could open his cell door at will, and had shown the prisoner a large jail-made shank that he\n7 possessed. The prisoner requested that the assailant be moved to a different pod, but\n8 ~ Defendants took no action to move the assailant to another housing unit. The following\n9 day the prisoner was alone in the common area of G-Pod for his hour of daily recreation;\n10 all of the other prisoners in G-Pod were in their cells with their doors closed and\n11 purportedly locked. The prisoner then saw the assailant use the shank to attempt to open\n12 the door to his cell. To protect himself, the prisoner ran to the assailant's door and used his\n13 body to keep the door from opening; he was forced to remain in that position for the\n14 ~ remainder of his hour outside of his cell. The assailant was, however, able to cut the\n15 ,prisoner multiple times in his upper stomach area with the shank.\n16 52.  Poor jail design also exacerbates the dangers of understaffing. According to\n17 another incident report prepared by an employee of the SHERIFF'S  OFFICE, in\n18 September 2011, one deputy opened a secure door to a Norteno unit to escort a single\n19 prisoner to different part of the jail while six prisoner workers and three other employees\n20 were in the area. Three prisoners classified as Nortenos pushed past the deputy when he\n21 ~~ opened the door and all four prisoners proceeded to assault a single inmate worker.\n22 Another deputy from the control tower heard the fighting but could not see what was\n23 happening. He opened the secured K-1 door to allow back-up to arrive, but in doing so, he\n24~~ revealed another deputy who was escorting three prisoners classified as Nortenos to the\n25 infirmary. All three attempted to join the fight when the door opened, because of their\n26 gang allegiances. Two were able to enter the area where the fight was continuing and the\n27 deputies had to repeatedly deploy their Tasers to get control of the situation until back-up\n28 could arrive.\npiszis-zoo  I \n19\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page22 of 74\n1 53.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody\n2 ~ staff in how to prevent and appropriately respond to prisoner violence. Such training is of\n3 ~ even greater import given the inadequate physical structure of the Jail.\n4 D.  Defendants Routinely Fail to Adequately Classify and Assign Prisoners\nto Housing Locations Where Prisoners Will Be Safe From Violence and\n5 Injury\n6 54.  Defendants fail to adequately classify and assign prisoners to housing\n7 ~ locations in the Jail where they will be safe from injury and violence. Before prisoners are\n8 assigned to certain housing locations in the Jail, they are \"classified\" based on a number of\n9 factors including their criminal charges, gang affiliation, race, and history of violence.\n10 These classification procedures are inappropriate and ineffective, however, and prisoners\n11 who are incompatible for various reasons, including rival gang memberships and/or\n12 histories of assaultive behaviors, are housed together in the Jail. Moreover, the severe\n13 overcrowding at the Jail makes proper and accurate classifications next to impossible. As\n14 the 2011 Jail. Needs Assessment found, \"[a]dequate separation and segregation resulting\n15 from classification of inmates cannot occur because of the severe overcrowding and lack\n16 of a sufficient number of single and double cells. Thus, while the staff has the ability to\n17 classify, they do not have the ability to physically segregate those inmates who should be\n18 separated because of their classification. This creates an environment that is unsafe for\n19 officers, inmates and visitors.\" Assessment at Ex. 2.\n20 55.  The 2011 Jail Needs Assessment further noted that, \"[i]t is obvious that the\n21 ~~ system is dangerously out of balance in terms of the types of beds available and the\n22 classification of inmates held.... In Monterey County there is the possibility of\n23 misclassifying inmates based on space rather than security level. Overcrowding reduces\n24 the ability to classify. This is further compounded by the dormitory design. Normally,\n25 10%-15% of the beds should be empty and available for classification spikes and\n26 maintenance.... Proper separation and segregation of inmates as envisioned in the Sheriff's\n27 classification plan is very difficult because of insufficient staff, an inadequate physical\n28 plant layout and ... severe overcrowding ....\" Assessment at Ex. 4-5.\np,sz,s-2o~  I \n20\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page23 of 74\n1 56.  For example, Plaintiff SARABI was attacked by a fellow prisoner on or\n2 around March 6, 2013 in the B-Dorm of the Jail. After the attack, Plaintiff SARABI was\n3 moved to C-Dorm so he would not be in the same housing areas as the prisoner who\n4 attacked him. However, on or around April 11, 2013, the Jail moved his attacker into\n5 Plaintiff SARABI's C-Dorm, so the person who attacked him just 5 weeks prior would be\n6 sleeping just 5 beds away from him. The Jail did not remove Plaintiff SARABI's attacker\n7 until the attacker himself was assaulted by other prisoners in the dorm a few hours later.\n8 57.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody\n9 staff in how to adequately classify and assign prisoners to housing locations in the Jail\n10 where prisoners will be safe from injury and violence. Such training is of even greater\n11 import given the chronic understaffing and overcrowding at the Jail.\n12 E.  Defendants Are Deliberately Indifferent to the Constitutionally\nUnacceptable Risk of Violence Prisoners Face\n13\n14 58.  Violent incidents between prisoners occur regularly, most of which involve\n15 ~ injury to at least one participant that requires medical attention at the Jail or even at the\n16 local hospital. In more than 100 of the reported incidents from 2011 and January through\n17 early-September 2012, at least one prisoner involved in the altercation required some\n18 medical treatment. In 13 of the incidents, the injuries suffered by at least one of the\n19 participants were so severe that they had to be taken to an outside medical facility for\n20 treatment.\n21 59.  Violent incidents between prisoners occur in nearly every area of the Jail.\n22 ~ ~ Violent incidents were reported in 26 of the 29 housing units in the Jail from 2011 and\n23 January through early-September 2012. There were multiple reports of violent incidents in\n24 21 of the 29 housing units. In the A-Dorm of the Main Jail alone, there were 19 incidents,\n25 while in the C-Wing of the Rehabilitation Center, there were 15 incidents. Violent\n26 incidents also occurred in the booking area, the kitchen where prisoners work, the\n27 infirmary, and the visiting area.\n28 60.  Violent incidents occur at _approximately equivalent per prisoner rates in the\n[716216-20]\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page24 of 74\n1~ portions of the Jail that house men and women. Twenty-one of the more than 150\n2 incidents involved female prisoners, while another 137 incidents involved male prisoners.\n3 61.  Prisoners with disabilities are at increased risk of being the victims of\n4 violence because of their perceived or actual inability to defend themselves. For example,\n5 in many of the incidents described in incident reports, prisoners with mental health\n6 problems were attacked by other prisoners because of behavior attributable to their mental\n7 illness.\n8 62.  Defendants have known of these conditions and the violence they create for\n9 some time, including through their own incident reports and 2007 and 2011 Jail Needs\n10 Assessments.\n11 63.  According to Defendants' own incident reports from 2011 and January to\n12 early September 2012, there were more than more than 150 separate incidents of violence\n13 between prisoners. Some of the incident reports were incomplete and lack important\n14' pieces of information. Upon information and belief, there are many more incidents of\n15 violence that were not captured in Defendants' incident reports.\n16 64.  In more than 65 of the incidents for which there was a full report, upon\n17 information and belief, jail staff failed to intervene to stop the incident before it was\n18 completed. If Defendants were not deliberately indifferent of the risk of prisoner violence,\n19 Defendants would be able to stop more violent incidents before they run their course,\n20 preventing further injury to the victims. For example, when Plaintiff SARABI was\n21 attacked on March 6, 2013 by another prisoner, no guards intervened or otherwise\n22 attempted to stop the attack.\n23 65.  In more than 35 of the incidents with full reports, Defendants were not able\n24 to identify the assailant. Though Defendants have installed cameras in the Jail, upon\n25 information and belief, only two cameras monitoring two units that house few prisoners\n26 have recording capabilities. The understaffing of the Jail means that officers are rarely in a\n27 position to identify the attackers visually. Moreover, because the conditions in the Jail are\n28 so unsafe, the victims of attacks frequently refuse to volunteer the name of their assailants\n[716216-20]  II \n22\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page25 of 74\n1 for fear of retaliatory attacks. If Defendants were not deliberately indifferent in their\n2 monitoring of prisoner safety, they would sufficiently staff the Jail and have other policies\n3 in place that would (1) result in the staff identification of assailants in a far greater number\n4 of attacks, and.( 2) create an environment in which victims feel sufficiently safe such that\n5 they identify their attackers.\n6 66.  Weapons are readily available inside the Jail, greatly increasing the danger to\n7 ~ inmates and staff. In addition to the incident discussed above involving a shank, inmate\n8 ~ assaults have also involved the use of a \"Tomahawk\" made from a razor and a 13 to 19-\n9 ~ inch long copper pipe.\n10 67.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody\n11 staff in how to timely and appropriately intervene to stop violent incidents, and how to\n12 ~ identify and confiscate weapons before they are used in an altercation.\n13 II.  DEFENDANTS FAIL TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE MEDICAL CARE TO\nPRISONERS\n14\n15 68.  Defendants are not meeting their constitutional obligation to provide\n16 adequate medical care to prisoners in the Jail. Prisoners are entirely dependent on\n17 Defendants for all medical care. The medical care provided by Defendants in the Jail is\n18 woefully inadequate and subjects prisoners to a substantial risk of serious injury or death.\n19 A.  Defendants Routinely and Systematically Fail to Maintain Sufficient\nNumbers of Health Care Professionals\n20\n21 69.  All health care in the Jail, including medical and mental health care, is\n22 provided by Defendant CFMG and its employees. CFMG provides these services pursuant\n23 to its contract with Monterey County. CFMG is afor-profit corporation.\n24 70.  Upon information and belief, Defendants maintain insufficient numbers of\n25 ~~ health care professionals to provide minimally adequate care to the more than 1,000\n26 prisoners in the Jail. There are not sufficient health care staff to timely respond to\n27 prisoners' requests for medical evaluations and treatment, or to adequately screen, monitor,\n28 and provide follow-up care to prisoners who are suffering from serious and chronic\n[/16216-20]\nCIVIL CLASS ACT10N COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page26 of 74\nillnesses.\n2 71.  For example, when Plaintiff SARABI was attacked by another prisoner the\n3 night of March 6, 2013, he was seen by a nurse who placed an ACE bandage on his right\n4 foot and ankle and gave him a wheelchair. Plaintiff SARABI complained for the next\n5 several hours about the serious pain in his foot and a possible concussion, but his repeated\n6 requests for help and medical care were ignored. When a nurse finally brought him back\n7 to the infirmary at approximately 3:00 a.m., she informed Plaintiff SARABI that there was\n8 no qualified medical staff present at that hour to evaluate and help him, so he would have\n9 to wait unti16:00 a.m. to receive his needed pain medications.\n10 72.  The insufficient number of custody staff makes it even more difficult for\n11 Defendants to provide minimally adequate health care. Within the Jail, any time that a\n12 prisoner must be transferred to or from a housing unit to another area of the Jail for health\n13 care services, at least one custody officer must accompany and transport the prisoner.\n14 Similarly, anytime that a prisoner requires transport to an outside medical facility for\n15 treatment, at least one custody officer must accompany the prisoner and remain present for\n16 the duration of time that the prisoner is at the outside medical facility. To timely transport\n17 all prisoners to and from all health care services would require Defendants to hire and staff\n18 the jail with additional custody officers, something Defendants refuse to do.\n19 B.  Defendants Routinely and Systematically Fail to Properly Train and\nSupervise the Conduct of Health Care Staff\n20\n21 73.  Upon information and belief, the small number of health care staff that\n22 Defendants do employ are not sufficiently trained to provide the care required of them.\n23 Licensed Vocational Nurses( \"LVNs\") and Licensed Psychiatric Technicians( \"LPTs\") are\n24 entry level health care providers who must only practice under the direct supervision of\n25 physicians, psychologists, registered nurses, social workers, or other qualified\n26 professionals, and are not qualified to do their own patient evaluations or assessments.\n27 Yet, upon information and belief, Defendants improperly allow untrained entry-level\n28 providers such as LVNs and LPTs to practice outside of the scope of their licensure and\nx/16216-20~  I \n24\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page27 of 74\n1 ~ perform medical gatekeeping functions, including independently assessing and responding\n2 ~ to prisoners' health care requests and correctional officers' referrals for health care.\n3 74.  For example, Plaintiff SARABI suffered a serious leg injury when he was\n4 attacked by another prisoner on March 6, 2013. Plaintiff SARABI was initially seen and\n5 ~ treated by nurses only for the first two weeks following the injury. The nurses wrapped his\n6 ~ injured foot and ankle in an ACE bandage immediately after the attack, then approximately\n7 ~ a week later placed a splint on his right foot and ankle. The splint was placed too low,\n8 ~ resulting in discomfort and continued pain for Plaintiff SARABI. When Plaintiff SARABI\n9 ~ finally saw a doctor for the first time (nearly two weeks after his date of injury), the doctor\n10 ~ informed him that he likely had a peroneal nerve injury that required specific nerve\n11,~ medication and would take at least a month if not longer to heal. When Plaintiff SARABI\n12 asked why it took medical staff so long to diagnose the nerve injury, the doctor replied that\n13 it was a \"staff problem\" because the staff erroneously diagnosed Plaintiff SARABI's nerve\n14 damage as a sprain.\n15 75.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train their\n16 ~ medical staff in how to properly follow the Jail's medical policies and procedures.\n17 76.  Defendants also fail to maintain medical accreditations. Specifically, the\n18 ~ Institute for Medical Quality( \"IMQ\") offers voluntary accreditation to correctional and\n19 detention facilities throughout California based upon meeting standards developed by the\n20 IMQ. Monterey County Jail's IMQ accreditation expired on November 17, 2011.\n21 C.  Defendants Lack Sufficient Facilities to Provide Adequate Medical Care\n22 77.  The physical spaces in the Jail used to deliver medical care are not sufficient\n23 for the population of prisoners. As the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment found,\n24 \"Medical/mental health treatment spaces are not adequate for the rated beds, let alone the\n25 actual number of inmates held.\" Assessment at Ex. 3. The Assessment further noted the\n26 direct impact of overcrowding on prisoners' overall health: \"Overcrowding affects\n27 inmates' mental and physical health by increasing the level of uncertainty with which they\n28 regularly cope.\" Assessment at Ex. 9. The lack of sufficient treatment space places\n[/16216-20]\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page28 of 74\n1 prisoners at an unreasonable risk of harm from inadequate medical care, compromises the\n2 delivery of medical care, and fails to ensure confidentiality and safety during the delivery\n3 of such care.\n4 D.  Defendants' Inadequate Screening and Intake Process Fails to Identify\nand Treat Medical Care Problems of Newly Arriving Prisoners\n5\n6 78.  Defendants fail to adequately identify and treat the medical problems of\n7 newly arriving prisoners during the screening and intake process. Defendants' policies and\n8 practices for medical screening are inadequate. Upon information and belief, Defendants\n9 fail to adequately train custody staff in how to timely and appropriately identify medical\n10 problems during the screening and intake process. When a prisoner is newly booked into\n11 the Jail, medical staff may not even play a role in screening the prisoner. Upon\n12 information and belief, custody staff( who are not sufficiently trained to identify medical\n13 needs) complete a brief one-page health screening form during a cursory interview with\n14 the prisoner in anon-confidential space. Medical staff only evaluate prisoners at intake if\n15 the custody staff note a problem on the screening form. Upon information and belief,\n16 Defendants fail to take every prisoner's vital signs (including blood pressure and\n17 temperature), and only take them for prisoners whom custody staff refer to medical staff\n18 for assessment. Upon information and belief, comprehensive intake evaluations by\n19 medical staff, when they occur at all, frequently do not take place until days or weeks after\n20 a prisoner is booked into the jail.\n21 79.  Because the screening process is inadequate to identify prisoners with\n22 serious or chronic health care problems, prisoners are at a significant risk of serious harm.\n_ __\n23 For example, prior to being booked into the Jail, Plaintiff MURPHY had permanent nerve\n24 damage that was caused by a bulge in his L4 and LS vertebrae. When he went through the\n25 screening process, Plaintiff MURPHY was experiencing significant pain from the nerve\n26 damage because he had not taken his pain medication and did not have a cane to assist him\n27 in walking. The screening form for Plaintiff MURPHY does not indicate that he had any\n28 potential or existing nerve damage or back problems.\n[716216-20]  II  2~\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page29 of 74\n1 80.  Another example is a prisoner whose colon had begun to rupture prior to his\n2 being booked into the Jail. When he went through the screening process, this prisoner was\n3 already experiencing symptoms from his condition, including a fever and significant\n4 abdominal pain. The screening form for this prisoner does not indicate that he had any\nSIIpotential health problems.\nE.  Defendants Fail to Provide Prisoners with a Reliable and Timely Way to\nAlert Health Care Staff of Their Medical Needs\n7\n8 81.  Defendants fail to provide a reliable way for prisoners to alert health care\n9 staff of their need for evaluation of medical problems. Defendants' policies and practices\n10 for providing prisoners with a means for alerting health care staff of medical needs are\n11 inadequate. Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train medical staff\n12 in how to properly process and timely respond to prisoners' requests for medical\n13 evaluation.\n14 82.  To request medical care, prisoners are supposed to submit a \"sick call slip\"\n15 to medical staff when medical staff come through a housing unit to distribute medications.\n16 Once a sick call slip is received by medical staff, the prisoner is supposed to be seen by\n17 medical staff on the next available sick call day. Though prisoners report little difficulty\n18 submitting sick call slips to medical staff, they frequently receive no response to their\n19 requests for medical care.\n20 83.  Other times, when prisoners do receive a response to a sick call slip, it is not\n21 until many days after the sick call slip was submitted. These delays in response from\n22 medical staff place prisoners in danger. For example, one prisoner submitted a sick call\n_  _  _  __-\n23 slip to seek medical attention after falling in the yard. He was not seen by anyone from the\n24 medical department for 6-7 days after he submitted the sick call slip.\n25 84.  Upon information and belief, the failure to timely respond to sick call slips is\n26 caused, at least in part, by Defendants' failure to create an effective tracking and\n27 scheduling system for health care appointments. Upon information and belief, another\n28 contributing factor is that there are no standardized protocols dictating when prisoners\nX716216-20]  II  7'~\nCIVIL CLASS ACT10N COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page30 of 74\n1 should receive aface-to-face appointment with a nurse or other medical or mental health\n2 care clinician. Consequently, health care providers arbitrarily determine whether the\n3 content of a sick call slip, often written by a prisoner who can barely read or write,\n4. warrants an examination. Upon information and belief, Defendants do not adequately train\n5 'I health care providers in how to review, process, and respond to sick call slips submitted by\n6 ~ prisoners.\n7 85.  In emergency situations, prisoners sometimes request health care from\n8 custody staff when medical staff are not immediately available. Rather than immediately\n9 contact health care staff to determine whether emergency care is required, custody staff\n10 often dismiss the prisoner's request and instruct prisoners to fill out a sick call slip. For\n11 example, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ was experiencing significant pain, cold sweats, and a\n12 fever after his colostomy reversal surgery. Although other prisoners in his pod began\n13 yelling \"Man down!\" to alert the Jail staff that Plaintiff HERNANDEZ was in serious\n14 distress and incapable of ambulating, at least 30-60 minutes passed between when the\n15 guard was first alerted to Plaintiff HERNANDEZ's \"man down\" status and when Plaintiff\n16 HERNANDEZ actually began receiving any medical assistance.\n17 86.  When Plaintiff SARABI was complaining about intense pain in his right\n18 ~ foot/ankle, and his concern about a broken ankle and a possible concussion one hour after\n19 he was attacked by another prisoner, one of the guards outside his room said, \"You're a\n20 tough guy, suck it up, if you had broken your ankle you would be in more pain.\" Delays in\n21 treating Plaintiff SARABI and other prisoners have created unnecessary suffering and\n22 worsened health outcomes.\n23 87.  Upon information and belief, Defendants do not adequately train custody\n24 staff in how to respond to prisoners' requests for emergency medical attention.\n25 F.  Defendants Routinely and Systematically Fail to Provide Adequate\nMedical Care\n26\n27 88.  Defendants fail to provide timely access to medical care. Defendants'\n28~~ policies and practices for providing timely access to medical care are inadequate. Upon\n~~sz,s-zoo  I  2~\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page31 of 74\ninformation and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train medical staff in how to provide\n2 timely access to medical care. If prisoners are seen by medical care providers at all, they\n3 often experience substantial delays in receiving those appointments. Prisoners commonly\n4 wait several weeks, sometimes several months, before they are evaluated by clinicians for\n5 medical symptoms. For example, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ was supposed to have his\n6 colostomy reversed in June 2012. However, Jail medical staff repeatedly refused to\n7 perform the colostomy reversal surgery, at first claiming that it was improper for Jail\n8 doctors to do so when an outside doctor had performed the original colostomy, and then\n9 claiming that the procedure was \"non-emergency\" so could not be done at the Jail. The\n10 Jail also refused to transfer Plaintiff HERNANDEZ to a facility where he could receive the\n11 reversal surgery, and in August 2012 denied Plaintiff HERNANDEZ the day pass\n12 necessary to go to Natividad Medical Center for the surgery. In total, Plaintiff\n13 HERNANDEZ had to wait eight months to have his colostomy surgery after he arrived at\n14 the Jail, during which time he suffered from intestinal swelling, bleeding, and pain.\n15 89.  Other prisoners have repeatedly been denied necessary medical treatments or\n16 experienced significant delays in receiving what they needed, or had been prescribed prior\n17 to arriving at the Jail, resulting in significant physical pain and discomfort, as well as\n18 increased anxiety and panic. For example, another prisoner repeatedly requested\n19 colostomy reversal surgery for three months, but was informed by the Jail that he could not\n20 receive the surgery because it was an \"elective,\" as opposed to emergency, procedure.\n21 During these three months, this prisoner suffered from infections, bloody discharge,\n22 fainting, and vomiting. Another prisoner was not timely provided with appropriate\n-- ___-\n23 colostomy supplies, and when he appeared in court, he was leaking feces over his body.\n24 The judge ordered him to be sent immediately to the hospital in an ambulance.\n25 90.  Another prisoner suffered a miscarriage immediately before being booked\n26 into the Jail, and experienced heavy vaginal bleeding for at least 7 weeks afterward.\n27 Despite repeated requests, this prisoner did not see a women's health specialist for 7\n28 weeks. After 7 weeks of bleeding and the filing of multiple grievances (most of which\nX71621 G20]\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page32 of 74\n1 went unanswered), this prisoner was finally taken to Natividad Medical Center for an\n2 evaluation by a women's health specialist. This prisoner did not receive timely and\n3 appropriate care for her condition.\n4 91.  Upon information and belief, CFMG medical staff inform prisoners that they\n5 will not receive medically necessary treatments, procedures, or medications while in the\n6 Jail because their release from the Jail or transfer to state prison or another institution is\n7 imminent. For example, when a prisoner's colostomy repeatedly became infected, he was\n8 told that reversal surgery would not be provided while he was in the Jail because of the\n9 expense, and that he would need to obtain the surgery once he was released.\n10 92.  In interactions with medical staff, Defendants fail to ensure that hearing and\n11 speech impaired prisoners who use American Sign Language as their primary method of\n12 communication are provided with sign language interpreters to ensure effective\n13 communication. Without sign language, such prisoners are not able to explain to medical\n14 care providers the symptoms they are experiencing, and medical staff are not able to\n15 explain the benefits and risks of treatments, medications, and procedures such. that\n16 prisoners can provide their informed consent. The lack of sign language interpretation\n17 services results in Defendants making medical treatment decisions without all of the\n18 necessary and pertinent information. they need, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis\n19 and mistreatment for the prisoner.\n20 93.  For example, Plaintiff YANCEY was examined by a Physician's Assistant\n21 (\"PA\") on December 4, 2012, two days after he was discharged from the hospital with a\n22 fractured right arm and fractured left tibia. Defendants did not provide Plaintiff YANCEY\n23 with a sign language interpreter for the examination.  Though Plaintiff YANCEY pre-\n24 sented with multiple, complex trauma issues, the PA's Progress Note admits that the\n25 \"[e]xam [was] limited due to decreased verbal communication ....\"  Because of Defend-\n26 ants' failure to provide Plaintiff YANCEY with a sign language interpreter, he was unable\n27 to explain the extent of his pain and other symptoms.  As a result, he suffered from\n28 needless and unnecessary pain. Defendants also failed to provide Plaintiff YANCEY with\nI \np,sz,s-zoo  30\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page33 of 74\n1 sign language interpreters at other medical appointments.  The lack of a sign language\n2 interpreter at other medical appointments similarly resulted in Plaintiff YANCEY's\n3 inability to communicate his symptoms to medical staff and to understand medical staff.\n4 Through their failure to provide sign language interpreters, Defendants are deliberately\n5 indifferent to the medical needs of prisoners who require assistance to communicate.\n6 94.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to provide foreign language\n7 interpretation services to prisoners whose primary language is not English during medical\n8 clinical evaluations. This is particularly true for prisoners who cannot speak either English\n9 or Spanish. Without foreign language interpretation, such prisoners are not able to explain\n10 to doctors the symptoms they are experiencing, and medical staff are not able to explain\n11 the benefits and risks of treatments, medications, and procedures such that prisoners can\n12 provide their informed consent. The lack of foreign language interpretation services\n13 results in Defendants making medical treatment decisions without all of the necessary and\n14 pertinent information they need, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis and mistreatment\n15 for the prisoner. Through their failure to provide foreign language interpreters, Defendants\n16 are deliberately indifferent to the medical needs of prisoners who require assistance to\n17 communicate.\n18 G.  Defendants Fail to Continue Medically Necessary Treatments for\nPrisoners Upon Their Arrival at the Jail\n19\n20 95.  Defendants fail to continue medically necessary treatments for prisoners who\n21 ~ ~ were in the process of undergoing care for chronic or serious conditions immediately prior\n22 to being booked into the Jail. Defendants' policies and practices for continuing medically\n23 necessary treatments for prisoners who arrive at the Jail are inadequate. Upon information\n24 and belief, Defendants do not adequately train medical staff in how to evaluate and treat\n25 prisoners who were undergoing care for chronic or serious conditions immediately prior to\n26 being booked into the Jail.\n27 96.  Defendants routinely refuse to provide medications that prisoners have been\n28 ~~ using to treat conditions outside of the Jail, even when the prisoners themselves, doctors,\np,sz,s-2o~  I \n31\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page34 of 74\n1 family members, or other entities bring their medications and/or valid prescriptions to the\n2 ~~ Jail.\n3 97.  For example, prior to his incarceration, Plaintiff MURPHY was taking\n4 various pain medications at least four times a day as treatment for the nerve damage in his\n5 back. However, despite his repeated requests, Plaintiff Mi_IRPHY has not received the\n6 necessary medications at the appropriate times, and he is in constant pain every day while\n7 at the Jail.\n8 98.  Prior to her incarceration, Plaintiff HUNTER was taking various medications\n9 to treat her diabetes, fibromyalgia, high blood pressure, chronic back pain, bone cancer,\n10 seizures, bipolar disorder, manic depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. Plaintiff\n11 HUNTER had many of these medications with her upon her arrival at the Jail, but they\n12 were confiscated during the booking process. Plaintiff HUNTER was not provided with\n13 all of her necessary medications for two weeks, even though she brought them to the Jail.\n14 Upon information and belief, Plaintiff HUNTER still has not been provided with all of the\n15 medications that she requires.\n16 99.  Defendants place prisoners who arrive at the Jail and who are prescribed pain\n17 ~ medications on what Defendants calla \"detoxification treatment.\" This \"detoxification\n18 treatment\" involves refusing, for up to 90 days, to provide prisoners with the pain and\n19 other medications they were taking before they were booked into the Jail. This practice of\n20 removing prisoners from prescribed medications is dangerous, inhumane, and does not\n21 meet the standard of care. Prisoners placed on the \"detoxification treatment\" and removed\n22 from pain medications suffer extreme pain, withdrawal symptoms, and degeneration of\n23 conditions the medication was designed to treat. For example, one prisoner was taking\n24 significant dosages of pain medications for injuries stemming from gunshot wounds,\n25 including a Fentanyl patch, Oxycontin, and Oxycodone. However, when he arrived at the\n26 Jail, he was taken off all his pain medications and immediately subjected to the\n27 detoxification treatment. As a result of the detoxification treatment, this prisoner suffered\n28 through an extremely painful withdrawal.\n[/16216-20)\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page35 of 74\n1 H.  Defendants Fail to Maintain Adequate, Accurate, and Complete Medical\nCare Records\n2\n3 100.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to maintain adequate, accurate,\n4 and complete medical care records. Defendants' policies and practices for maintaining\n5 adequate medical care records are inadequate. Upon information and belief, Defendants\n6 fail to adequately train medical staff in how to maintain adequate medical care records.\n7 For example, physicians change prisoners' medications without documenting explanations.\n8 As a result of Defendants' failure to maintain adequate medical care records, prisoners\n9 suffer from a substantial risk of misdiagnosis, dangerous mistakes, and unnecessary delays\n10 in care. For example, certain Progress Notes from November 28, 2012 and January 29,\n11 2013, are missing from Plaintiff YANCEY's medical file, placing him at increased risk of\n12 misdiagnosis and mistreatment.\n13 101.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to obtain medical files from\n14 outside providers for significant periods of time after the prisoner's arrival at the Jail (if at\n15 all). This lack of information reduces the quality of medical care, as medical staff treat\n16 prisoners without reviewing pertinent medication background information and history,\n17 which increases the risk of misdiagnosis and mistreatment.\n18 I.  Defendants Fail to Provide Adequate Medical Care and Follow Up\nTreatment to Prisoners\n19\n20 102.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to order diagnostic testing\n21 when medically necessary. Defendants' policies and practices for ordering diagnostic\n22 testing are inadequate. Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train\n23 medical staff in when it is appropriate to order diagnostic testing. For example, when\n24 Plaintiff SARABI sustained an injury to his right ankle/foot after he was attacked by\n25 another prisoner, he did not timely receive tests to determine the extent of the muscle and\n26 nerve damage. Other prisoners do not receive medically indicated diagnostic tests such as\n27 a colonoscopy or an ultrasound in a timely manner.\n28 103.  Defendants also fail to refer prisoners to medical specialists or to an outside\np,s2~~~o~  I \n33\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page36 of 74\n1 medical center when medically necessary. Defendants' policies and practices for referring\n2 prisoner to specialist or outside providers are inadequate. Upon information and belief,\n3 Defendants fail to adequately train medical staff in when it is appropriate to refer prisoners\n4 to medical specialists or outside medical centers. For example, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ\n5 required colostomy reversal surgery, but Defendants refused for eight months to perform\n6 or provide the surgery.\n7 104.  Upon information and belief, another prisoner in the Jail recently suffered a\n8 miscarriage due to the Jail's failure to timely take her to a hospital. While pregnant, this\n9 prisoner began to experience uterine cramping and bleeding, but was informed by Jail\n10 medical staff to go on bed rest. The Jail staff did not transport her to a hospital until at\n11 least two days later, and by that time she had lost her baby. Between 2012-2013, at least\n12' three women in the Jail suffered from miscarriages.\n13 105.  Defendants fail to adequately monitor prisoners discharged from the hospital\n14 or Jail infirmary. Defendants' policies and practices for monitoring prisoners discharged\n15 from the hospital or infirmary are inadequate. Upon information and belief, Defendants\n16 fail to adequately train medical staff in how to appropriately and effectively monitor\n17 prisoners discharged from the hospital or infirmary. For example, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ\n18 received colostomy reversal surgery in December 2012, and had to return to the hospital\n19 one day after surgery due to post-operative complications. Since his discharge from\n20 Natividad Medical Center, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ has received inadequate care from Jail\n21 medical staff. Specifically, Plaintiff HERNANDEZ's gauze at the surgery site was not\n22 changed every 24 hours as is required, he did not receive the antibiotics that had been\n23 prescribed for him, and when he experienced fever and severe pain, Jail staff failed to\n24 contact staff at the Natividad Medical Center (as they had been instructed to do). When\n25 Plaintiff HERNANDEZ went \"man down\" due to the worst pain of his life, a fever, and\n26 cold sweats, he did not receive medical assistance for 30-60 minutes, despite his recent\n27 discharge from the hospital. Plaintiff HERNANDEZ was most recently discharged from\n28 Natividad Medical Center on or around February 28, 2013, and since then has only been\nII \n[116216-20]  34\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page37 of 74\n1~ seen rarely by a doctor or even by nurses. Plaintiff HERNANDEZ was promised physical\n2~ therapy for his stomach and periodic checkups for his various medical conditions, none of\n3 which have occurred. Plaintiff HERNANDEZ continues to suffer from bowel obstructions\n4 ~ and stomach pain.\n5 106.  Another prisoner suffered a ruptured colon and had to undergo colostomy\n6 surgery in August 2012. After he was discharged from the Jail infirmary following the\n7 surgery, the Jail failed to timely provide him with supplies to change his colostomy bag,\n8 and when such supplies were provided, they were often improper (e.g., the wrong size\n9 colostomy bag). In November 2012, an infection developed around his suture from the\n10 colostomy surgery and the prisoner suffered from bloody discharge from his colon, but Jail\n11 staff refused to perform the overdue colostomy reversal (which was originally scheduled\n12 for October 2012). Despite his dire health complications after the colostomy surgery and\n13 his need for the reversal, this prisoner was not seen by a doctor for over three weeks in\n14 January 2013.\n15 107.  Upon information and belief, Defendants routinely release prisoners with\n16 ~ serious medical conditions from the Jail without providing them with services to ensure\n17 that their medical care is not disrupted. Defendants' policies and practices for the\n18 provision of continuing medical care services upon a prisoner's release are inadequate.\n19 Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody and medical staff\n20 in how to appropriately release prisoners with serious medical concerns so that such\n21 prisoners can continue their medical care. Upon information and belief, for those prisoners\n22 who are prescribed medications in the Jail, they are released without either a supply of or a\n23 prescription for them to fill those medications at a community pharmacy. Defendants do\n24 not schedule follow-up appointments in the community, nor are prisoners provided with\n25 sufficient referrals or information about where they may receive medical care services or\n26 medications.\n27\n28\n[/16216-20]  I \n35 \nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page38 of 74\n1 III.  DEFENDANTS FAIL TO PROVIDE MINIMALLY ADEQUATE MENTAL\nHEALTH CARE TO PRISONERS\n2\n3 108.  Defendants are not meeting their constitutional obligation to provide\n4 adequate mental health care to prisoners in the Jail. Prisoners are entirely dependent on\n5 Defendants for all mental health care. The mental health care provided by Defendants in\n6 the Jail is woefully inadequate and subjects prisoners to a substantial risk of deteriorating\n7 psychiatric conditions, extreme anguish and suffering, and in some cases, even death.\n8 Defendants' mental health care system falls far short of all of the minimum elements of a\n9 constitutional mental health system.\n10 A.  Defendants Fail to Identify and Track Prisoners in Need of Mental\nHealth Care\n11\n12 109.  Defendants fail to adequately identify, track and treat the mental health\n13' problems of newly arriving prisoners during the screening and intake process. Defendants'\n14 policies and practices for mental health screening and tracking are inadequate. Upon\n15 information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody staff in how to timely\n16 and appropriately identify mental health problems during the screening and intake process.\n17 When a prisoner is newly booked into the Jail, mental health staff play no role in the initial\n18 j  screening of the prisoner. Upon information and belief, custody staff( who are not\n19 sufficiently trained to identify mental health concerns) complete a brief one-page general\n20 health screening form through a cursory interview conducted with the prisoner in a non-\n21 confidential area of the Jail. Mental health staff only evaluate prisoners at intake if the\n22 custody staff refer the prisoner to mental health care staff. Upon information and belief,\n23 comprehensive intake evaluations by mental health staff, when they occur at all, frequently\n24 do not take place until days or weeks after a prisoner is booked into the Jail.\n25 110.  Because the screening process is inadequate to identify prisoners with\n26 serious mental health care problems, prisoners are at a significant risk of serious harm. For\n27 example, Plaintiff HUNTER arrived at the Jail on March 16, 2013 with psychiatric\n28 medications to treat her bipolar disorder, manic depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.\np,sz,s-2o~  II  36\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page39 of 74\n1 Plaintiff HUNTER also brought with her a hard copy of her medical history, which\n2 documents the medications she requires. However, during the booking process, Plaintiff\n3 HUNTER's psychiatric medications were confiscated, and she did not receive any of her\n4 needed psychiatric medications for at least 2 weeks, despite repeated requests and\n5 grievances asking for the medications. As a result of not receiving her psychiatric\n6 medications, Plaintiff HUNTER suffered from unnecessary and avoidable pain and\n7 symptoms, including, but not limited to, nightmares, anxiety, panic attacks, and\n8 hallucinations for this two week period.\n9 111.  Defendants fail to provide adequate treatment to prisoners who arrive at the\n10 Jail and have been prescribed psychotropic medications. Defendants' policies and\n11 practices for prisoners who have been taking prescribed psychotropic medications are\n12 inadequate. Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental health\n13 staff in how to evaluate and treat prisoners who arrive at the Jail and have been taking\n14 prescribed psychotropic medications. Defendants sometimes place prisoners who arrive at\n15 the Jail and who are prescribed psychotropic medications on what Defendants call a\n16 \"detoxification treatment.\" This \"detoxification treatment\" involves refusing, for up to 90\n17 days, to provide prisoners with the psychotropic medications they were taking before they\n18 were booked into the Jail. This practice of removing prisoners from prescribed\n19 ~ medications is dangerous, inhumane, and does not meet the standard of care. Prisoners\n20 placed on the \"detoxification treatment\" and removed from psychotropic medications\n21 experience unnecessary pain and increases in psychiatric symptoms including paranoia,\n22 hallucinations, and suicidality. Such individuals are at increased risk of attempting to\n23 commit suicide.\n24 112.  Upon information and belief, Defendants do not maintain any central list,\n25 ~~ electronic or otherwise, of prisoners with mental illness and the treatment they require.\n26 Defendants do not maintain adequate information about prisoners' mental health needs in\n27 the prisoners' custody and/or medical files. Moreover, upon information and belief, to the\n28 extent that Defendants maintain information about a prisoner's mental health needs in any\nX71621 G20]\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page40 of 74\n1 form, custody, medical, and clerical staff are not provided with access to the information in\n2 a manner that would timely and effectively inform them of a prisoner's mental health\n3 concerns and treatment needs.\n4 113.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental\n5 health staff in how to track and monitor prisoners with mental illness and the treatment\n6 they require.\n7 B.  Defendants Lack Adequate Policies and Procedures to Identify, Treat,\nTrack and Supervise Prisoners at Risk for Suicide\n8\n9 114.  Defendants fail to identify, treat, track and supervise prisoners who are at\n10 I' risk for suicide. Defendants' policies and practices for screening, supervising, and treating\n11 prisoners at risk for suicide are inadequate. These shortcomings in the Jail's suicide\n12 prevention and treatment program have had tragic consequences. Over the past three\n13 years, there have been three completed and more than a dozen attempted suicides. The\n14 rate of completed suicides at the Jail significantly exceeds the national average for local\n15 jails.\n16 115.  The very design of the Jail itself presents a risk to suicidal prisoners. As\n17~ noted in the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment,\" The older design of the cells and dormitories\n18 constructed prior to 1993 does not meet today's minimum standards for detention\n19 facilities. Examples include: Suicide hazard elimination is not as stringent as it should be\n20 to prevent self-harm and the attendant liability.\" Assessment at Ex. 3.\n21 116.  Upon information and belief, Defendants do not adequately train custody\n22 staff to identify prisoners who are at risk of suicide and respond adequately to prisoners\n23 who are e~ibiting suicidal tendencies. This is especially problematic because custody\n24 staff, both during the intake process and for the duration of a prisoner's time in the Jail,\n25 have the primary responsibility for alerting mental health staff when a prisoner is suicidal.\n26 117.  Defendants routinely fail to identify and track prisoners who are at risk for\n27 suicide. For example, a prisoner named Joshua Claypole. who recently arrived at the Jail\n28 ~ was suicidal, and his attorney asked Jail staff to place this prisoner on suicide watch on the\n[/16216-20]\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page41 of 74\n1 day of his arrest. Mr. Claypole was apparently initially placed on suicide watch, but was\n2 soon taken off and cleared to go into the jail's general population. He was then housed in\n3 a single cell, but upon information and belief did not receive any increased monitoring or\n4 medication. Mr. Claypole attempted suicide by hanging in his cell, and was air-lifted to a\n5 San Jose hospital where he was placed on life support. Five days later, he was taken off\n6 life support and died. Another prisoner had attempted suicide at least twice before his\n7 incarceration and spent 6-8 months at Atascadero State Hospital before coming to the Jail.\n8 Despite this prisoner's suicidal history, the Jail failed to identify him as at risk for suicide\n9 and failed to take steps to safely house, track, and treat him to reduce the risk of suicide.\n10 This prisoner attempted suicide by jumping off the second floor of the housing pod, and\n11 had to be airlifted to Santa Clara Hospital, where he was treated for trauma to his head and\n12 broken ribs.\n13 118.  There are many examples of attempted suicides where deputies did not\n14 identify warning signs or did not appropriately track the inmate to protect him once the\n15 risk was apparent. For example, in May 2012, an inmate was placed in a safety cell\n16 because he had been kicking his cell door, yelling and screaming. While serving the\n17 afternoon meal, a deputy noticed the inmate was bleeding from-the head in his safety cell.\n18 While removing the inmate from the safety cell, he was placed in a safety chair which was\n19 inoperative. As deputies moved him to operative safety chair, the inmate was able to throw\n20 himself to the ground head first, and had to be transported to the ER.\n21 119.  Defendants routinely house suicidal prisoners in conditions that result in\n22 further deterioration of their mental health. Defendants' policies and practices for housing\n23 suicidal prisoners are inadequate. Rather than individually determine the most integrated\n24 environment in which a suicidal prisoner can be safely housed, Defendants have a policy\n25 and practice of placing prisoners with serious mental health concerns in the \"rubber\n26 rooms.\" The rubber rooms are single cells with no furnishings, toilets, or (in most cases)\n27 windows for outside light. The only features of the cell are the door, which has a slot\n28 ~  through which food can be delivered, and a grate in the floor that serves as the toilet for\n~r,sz,s-2o~  I \n39\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page42 of 74\n1 feces and urine. When housing a prisoner in a rubber room, Defendants routinely remove\n2 all of the prisoner's clothing, leaving them naked in the room. In some instances,\n3 Defendants permit a prisoner to have atear-proof smock for clothing and nothing else.\n4 There is no mattress or pad, let alone a bed, in any of the rubber rooms for prisoners to sit\n5 or sleep on. Prisoners are thus forced to sit and sleep on the same cold, dirty floor in\n6 which the grate for the toilet is located.\n7 120.  Upon information and belief, the rubber rooms are rarely cleaned when a\n8 prisoner is being housed in one of the cells and are not cleaned sufficiently once a prisoner\n9 is released from the cell. The walls and floor of the rubber rooms are soiled by feces\n10 because of the inadequate toilet and non-existent sink. These conditions are traumatic for\n11 all prisoners, but especially for those who are already experiencing mental health\n12 symptoms. Suicidal prisoners may perceive the rubber rooms as a method of punishment\n13 (as opposed to treatment), which may dissuade them from self-identifying as suicidal.\n14 121.  Defendants exacerbate the psychological trauma experienced by suicidal\n15 prisoners who are housed in rubber rooms by failing to provide them with necessary\n16 mental health care. These prisoners do not receive sufficient contact with mental health\n17 providers (if they receive mental health care at all). As a result, their suicidality may\n18. escalate and they are forced to stay in the rubber room even longer. For example, one\n19 prisoner woke up screaming from a nightmare, and was sent to the rubber room. She was\n20 given a filthy blanket, and forced to use a bathroom consisting of a grate in the floor as she\n21 was simultaneously vomiting green bile. During her time in the rubber room, the mental\n22 health staff did not visit this prisoner or provide her with any mental health treatment,\n23 aside from asking her if she was suicidal. Another prisoner was kept in the rubber room\n24 for five full days, and described feeling as though the walls were closing in on him the\n25 entire time. After he was released from the rubber room, this prisoner did not receive\n26 adequate follow-up to evaluate his mental health state and risk of suicidality. While\n27 Defendants may consider rubber rooms \"safe\" for suicidal prisoners, in fact the rubber\n28 rooms lack any therapeutic value, and certainly do not replace the need for psychiatric\n~,sz,s-zoo  II \n40\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page43 of 74\n1 j hospitalization and treatment.\n2 122.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to sufficiently observe\n3 prisoners who have been identified as being at risk of suicide, including prisoners who\n4 have been placed in rubber rooms. Specifically, Defendants lack any policy or procedure\n5 for, and therefore fail to provide, uninterrupted, constant, one-on-one observation of\n6 prisoners who are actively suicidal, either threatening to or engaging in the act of suicide.\n7 123.  Defendants have knowledge of the substantial risk of harm caused by\n8 inadequate suicide prevention and treatment policies and practices in the Jail, but have\n9 failed to take steps to prevent, or even to diminish, the harmful effects of these unlawful\n10 policies and practices. Defendants are thus deliberately indifferent to the risk of harm to\n11 prisoners created by their failure to operate a constitutionally adequate suicide prevention\n12 and treatment program.\n13 C.  Defendants Lack Sufficient Facilities to Provide Adequate Mental\nHealth Care\n14\n15~ 124.  The outdated facility and overcrowding at the Jail only exacerbate the\n16 inadequate mental health conditions and treatment at the Jail. As the 2011 Jail Needs\n17 Assessment found,\" Medical/mental health treatment spaces are not adequate for the rated\n18 beds, let alone the actual number of inmates held.... Overcrowding forces the entire\n19 facility to operate as an indirect supervision facility. Mental health issues are considerably\n20 more difficult to recognize, manage and treat in an indirect supervision facility.\"\n21 Assessment at Ex. 3. The Assessment further noted the direct impact of overcrowding on\n22 prisoners' mental health conditions: \"Overcrowding affects inmate' mental and physical\n23 health by increasing the level of uncertainty with which they regularly cope.\" Assessment\n24 at Ex. 9. The lack of sufficient treatment space places prisoners at an unreasonable risk of\n25 harm from inadequate mental health care. Inadequate mental health offices and treatment\n26 spaces compromise the delivery of mental health care, and fail to address the\n27 confidentiality and safety concerns that arise in delivery of such care. Defendants have not\n28 sufficiently eliminated suicide hazards through the Jail.\n~,sz,s-2o~\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page44 of 74\n1 D.  Defendants' Mental Health Treatment Program Involves Little More\nthan Segregation and Supervision\n2\n3 125.  Defendants routinely discriminate against prisoners with serious mental\n4 illness by isolating them from and denying them privileges granted to other prisoners.\n5 Defendants' policies and practices for housing prisoners with serious mental illness are\n6 inadequate. Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental health\n7 staff in how to appropriate house prisoners with serious mental illness. Prisoners with\n8 serious mental illness are generally housed by Defendants in celled housing units (in the A\n9 and B Pods), as opposed to in dorm housing units. When housed in a cell, as opposed to\n10 dorm, prisoners have far less freedom to move around and to interact with other prisoners.\n11 Defendants refer to celled housing units as \"lockdown\" units. Prisoners housed in\n12 lockdown units generally only are permitted outside of their cells for one hour per day.\n13' During that one hour per day, prisoners are expected to shower, exercise, and use the\n14 telephone. In contrast, prisoners in dorm housing units are free to access most areas of the\n15 dorm unit, including the common area, showers, telephones, and yard, as they please\n16 during most of the day. Prisoners with severe mental health concerns may also be housed\n17 by Defendants in isolation cells. When housed in an isolation cell, prisoners have limited\n18 freedom to move around and interact with other prisoners, and they have extremely limited\n19 access to programs and services at the Jail. Accordingly, prisoners with serious mental\n20 illnesses are denied access to programs and services because Defendants place prisoners\n21 with serious mental illness in lockdown units or isolation cells.\n22 126.  Defendants routinely fail to provide medically necessary psychotropic\n23 ~~ medications to prisoners with psychiatric illnesses. Defendants' policies and practices for\n24 providing psychotropic medications to prisoners are inadequate. Upon information and\n25 belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental health staff in the proper administration\n26 of psychotropic medications. Defendants fail to provide psychotropic medications even\n27 when provided with valid. prescriptions from the California Department of Mental Health,\n28 community providers, or family members. Especially during the first 90 days of\n~,sz~s-2o~  II  —  42  _\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTNE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page45 of 74\n1 incarceration, prisoners may be labeled by medical staff as drug seekers and malingerers,\n2 ~ and use those labels to deny needed medications.\n3 127.  As a result of Defendants' failure to provide medically necessary\n4 psychotropic medications, prisoners with mental illness suffer from the following:\n5 (1) withdrawal symptoms when the medications they were prescribed before admission to\n6 the Jail are abruptly terminated;( 2) recurrence of debilitating symptoms such as\n7 hallucinations and suicidality; and (3)i n some cases, decompensation to the point of being\n8 found incompetent to stand trial and/or being sent to the State Hospital until they are stable\n9 enough to return to the Jail.\n10 128.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to provide sign language\n11 interpretation services to prisoners whose primary language is American Sign Language\n12 during mental health clinical evaluations. Without sign language interpretation, such\n13 prisoners are not able to explain to mental health staff the symptoms they are experiencing,\n14 and mental health staff are not able to explain the benefits and risks of treatments and\n15 medications such that prisoners can provide their informed consent. The lack of sign\n16 language interpretation services results in Defendants making mental health treatment\n17 decisions without all of the necessary and pertinent information they need, which increases\n18 the risk of misdiagnosis and mistreatment for the prisoner.\n19 129.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to provide foreign language\n20 interpretation services to prisoners whose primary language is not English during mental\n21 health clinical evaluations. This is particularly true for prisoners who cannot speak either\n22 English or Spanish. Without foreign language interpretation, such prisoners are not able to\n23 explain to mental health staff the symptoms they are experiencing, and mental health staff\n24 are not able to explain the benefits and risks of treatments and medications such that\n25 prisoners can provide their informed consent. The lack of foreign language interpretation\n26 services results in Defendants making mental health treatment decisions without all of the\n27 necessary and pertinent information they need, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis\n28 and mistreatment for the prisoner.\np,sz,s-zoo  I \n43\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page46 of 74\n1 130.  Defendants provide little to no individual or group treatment to prisoners\n2 with mental health problems, even for prisoners with the most severe issues. For example,\n3 Plaintiff HLJNTER's anxiety and panic attacks are exacerbated when she is in the\n4 overcrowded Jail environment, but she been denied therapy sessions since her arrival at the\n5 Jail. Another prisoner, who had attempted suicide twice prior to his arrival at the Jail and\n6 once while at the Jail in December 2012, did not receive one-on-one therapy sessions, but\n7 rather only medications (provided by nurses to the prisoner in his isolation cell). Plaintiff\n8 MURPHY had been seeing an outside psychiatrist who provided him with therapy, but the\n9 Jail failed to transport him to his April appointment with his outside psychiatrist. As a\n10 result, Plaintiff MURPHY is not receiving adequate mental health care.\n11 131. .Upon information and belief, Defendants' disciplinary process fails to take\n12 into account behavior which results from inadequate mental health care. For example, as a\n13 result of Defendants' denial of medically necessary psychotropic medications and little or\n14 no individual or group treatment, prisoners with serious mental conditions may be unable\n15 to conform to Jail rules or be safely housed in cells with other prisoners. In response,\n16 rather than provide them with the medications or treatment they need, Defendants\n17 selectively house these prisoners in isolation in the \"rubber rooms.\"\n18 132.  Upon information and belief, prisoners with serious mental health conditions\n19 may be placed in rubber rooms as punishment for an inability to follow Jail rules. But\n20 many of these prisoners would not have violated Jail rules had they been receiving\n21 adequate mental health treatment.\n22 133.  When mental illness is inhibiting an inmate's ability to follow directions or\n23 interact with others, many incident reports show no effort by staff to involve mental health\n24 professionals who might be able to calm the inmate down and address the underlying\n25 psychiatric issue without resorting to use of physical force. Instead, staff who do not have\n26 adequate training regarding how to treat mental health issues, attempt to interact with the\n27 prisoner on their own, and end up resorting to use of physical force and/or violence to\n28 control the prisoners. Sometimes, the use of force results in larger prisoner-on-prisoner\npts2ts-2o~\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page47 of 74\n1 fights in the unit.\n2 134.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to provide adequate training to\n3 custody staff regarding how to respond to mentally ill prisoners whose non-conforming\n4 behaviors are a product of their mental illness.\n5 135.  Upon information and belief, Defendants place prisoners in the rubber room\n6 when they request mental health care from Defendants. For example, one prisoner was\n7 suffering from mental health symptoms because he had not been provided with prescribed\n8 medications for preexisting medical conditions. Rather than attempt to treat his psychiatric\n9 distress, Defendants placed him naked in the rubber room without even a blanket for the\n10 first few hours.\n11 136.  Upon information and belief, Defendants exacerbate the psychological\n12 trauma experienced by prisoners with serious mental health conditions who are housed in\n13 rubber rooms by failing to provide them with necessary mental health care. These\n14 prisoners do not receive sufficient contact with mental health providers. As a result, their\n15 nonconforming behaviors may escalate and they are forced to stay in the rubber room even\n16 ~ longer.\n17 E.  Defendants Fail to Employ a Sufficient Number of Properly Trained\nMental Health Professionals\n18\n19 137.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to maintain sufficient numbers\n20 of mental health care professionals to provide minimally adequate care to the more than\n21 1,100 prisoners in the Jail. Defendants' policies and practices for mental health care\n22 staffing are inadequate.\n23 138.  The Jail's low staffing levels result in a mental health care staff being unable\n24 to timely respond to prisoners' requests for psychiatric evaluations and treatment, or to\n25 adequately screen, track, monitor, and provide follow-up care to prisoners who are\n26 suffering from serious mental illnesses. For example, during an attorney interview, one\n27 prisoner was incapable of conversation, had feces in his hair, ranted obscene comments,\n28 and frequently exposed his genitals. When alerted to this prisoner's deteriorated mental\np,s2,s-zoo  II  45\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page48 of 74\n1 ~ health state by the attorney, Jail staff informed the attorney that the prisoner would be seen\n2 the next day because mental health staff had gone for the day.\n3 139.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental\n4 health staff to timely respond to prisoners' requests for psychiatric evaluations and\n5 ~ treatment, and to adequately screen, track, monitor, and provide follow-up care to\n6 ~ prisoners who are suffering from serious mental illness.\n7 F.  Defendants Fail to Maintain Accurate, Complete and Confidential\nMental Health Treatment Records\n8\n9' 140.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to maintain adequate, accurate,\n10 and confidential mental health care records. For example, upon information and belief,\n11 psychiatrists often change prisoners' medications without documenting explanations.\n12 Upon information and belief, psychiatrists also fail to document their justification and\n13 reasoning for changing the diagnoses and treatment plans for prisoners returning to the Jail\n14 from psychiatric hospitals. As a result of Defendants' failure to maintain adequate mental\n15 health care records, prisoners suffer from a substantial risk of misdiagnosis, dangerous\n16 mistakes, and unnecessary delays in care.\n17 141.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to obtain medical files from\n18 outside providers for lengthy periods of time after the prisoner's arrival at the Jail (if at\n19 all). This lack of information reduces the quality of mental health care. For example,\n20II Plaintiff MURPHY was arrested and booked into the Jail on January 18, 2013. During an\n21 intake triage assessment that same day, Jail staff was informed that Plaintiff MURPHY's\n22 psychiatric medications were prescribed by a physician at the Monterey County Veteran's\n23 Administration clinic. Plaintiff MURPHY was not seen by any mental health staff until\n24 ~~ January 21, 2013, when he had an appointment with a licensed psychiatric technician, who\n25 did not prescribe him medications. Upon information and belief, the licensed psychiatric\n26 technician made only one request for Plaintiff MURPHY'S  medical records from the\n27 Monterey County Veteran's Affairs office( \"VA\") on January 21, 2013, and made no\n28 effort to follow up after that date. On January 28, 2013, at least in part because he was not\np,s2~s-zoo  I \n4h\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page49 of 74\n1 ~ provided with any psychiatric medications, Plaintiff MURPHY was placed in a \"rubber\n2 room\" where he remained for at least 18 hours. As of at least April 19, 2013, Defendants\n3 still had not obtained Plaintiff MURPHY'S psychiatric records from the VA.\n4 142.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental\n5 ~ health staff in how to maintain accurate mental health records, including the timely request\n6 ~ of prisoners' prior mental health records.\n7 G.  Defendants Administer Psychotropic Medications Without Appropriate\nSupervision and Periodic Evaluation\n8\n9 143.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to evaluate prisoners before\n10 making treatment decisions, including whether to prescribe psychotropic medications.\n11 Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train mental health staff in how\n12 to appropriately evaluate prisoners before making mental health treatment decisions.\n13 144.  When Defendants do administer psychotropic medications to prisoners in the\n14 Jail, they routinely fail to monitor or follow up with these prisoners after such medications\n15 are prescribed. For example, Plaintiff MURPHY is taking a number of psychiatric\n16 medications to address his aural and visual hallucinations. However, he is not receiving\n17 the correct dosages of the medications, and continues to see shadows and hear voices. The\n18 hallucinations are so frequent and intense that he can only sleep for a few hours at night.\n19 Despite his repeated requests, mental health staff have not adjusted his dosages or\n20 otherwise followed up with him to evaluate the efficacy of the medications.\n21 145.  Upon information and belief, Defendants routinely release prisoners with\n22~ ~ serious mental health conditions from the Jail without providing them with any services to\n23 ensure that their mental health care is not disrupted. Defendants' policies and practices for\n24 the provision of continuing mental health care services upon a prisoner's release are\n25 inadequate. Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train custody and\n26 ~ ~ mental health staff in how to appropriately release prisoners with serious mental health\n27 concerns so that such prisoners can continue their mental health care. Upon information\n28 and belief, for those prisoners who are prescribed psychiatric medications in the Jail, they\n~r,sz,s-zoo  II \n47\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page50 of 74\n1 are released without either a supply of or a prescription for them to fill those medications\n2 at a community pharmacy. Defendants do not schedule follow-up appointments in the\n3 community, nor are prisoners provided with sufficient referrals or information about where\n4 they may receive mental health care services or medications.\n5 IV.  DEFENDANTS DISCRIMINATE AGAINST,F AIL TO ACCOMMODATE,\nAND VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS OF\n6 PRISONERS WITH DISABILITIES\n7 146.  Defendants currently incarcerate in Monterey County Jail significant\n8 numbers of individuals with disabilities, as that term is defined in the ADA,t he\n9 Rehabilitation Act, and California disability rights law. Defendants routinely fail to\n10 provide these prisoners with basic reasonable accommodations to ensure equivalent access\n11 to all of the programs and services offered by the Jail. Defendants' failure to\n12 accommodate prisoners with disabilities not only denies them access to prison programs\n13 and services, but also substantially increases the risk that they are injured in an emergency\n14 and are the victim of violence or abuse from other prisoners. Moreover, Defendants'\n15 refusal to accommodate prisoners with disabilities results in the provision of inadequate\n16 medical and mental health care and the trampling of prisoners' due process rights in Jail\n17 disciplinary proceedings.\n18 A.  Defendants Lack Adequate Policies and Practices to Identify and Track\nPrisoners with Disabilities\n19\n20 147.  Under the ADA,t he Rehabilitation Act, and California disability rights law,\n21 Defendants must create and maintain a system to identify and track individuals with\n22 disabilities and the accommodations they require. Defendants, however, lack adequate\n23 policies and practices for identifying individuals with disabilities and the reasonable\n24 accommodations they require.\n25 148.  Defendants routinely fail to identify prisoners with disabilities. During\n26 ~~ Defendants' intake process, custody officers collect various pieces of information about\n27 new prisoners. Defendants use the information to make a number of determinations,\n28 including how to classify a prisoner. A prisoner's classification determines with which\np,s2~~zo~  II  48\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page51 of 74\n1 other prisoners the new prisoner can share space and in what parts of the prison the new\n2 prisoner can be housed.\n3 149.  Upon information and belief, the officers who are responsible for conducting\n4 the intake process are not adequately trained by Defendants regarding how to identify and\n5 track individuals with disabilities, and therefore frequently fail to identify prisoners with\n6 disabilities or the accommodations they need to access Jail programs and services. Upon\n7 information and belief, the forms and system that Defendants use to capture the\n8 information gathered during the intake process lack adequate fields and space to document\n9 if a prisoner has a disability and requires accommodations.\n10 150.  Defendants' failures to accurately identify new prisoners' disabilities and\n11 needed accommodations during the intake process result in the denial of accommodations\n12, mandated by the ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and California disability rights law, placing\n13 prisoners at risk of discrimination, injury, and/or exploitation. For example, during\n14 booking into the Jail in August 2012 and again in December 2012, staff completed\n15 Monterey County Sheriff's Office Intake Health Screening forms for Plaintiff YANCEY.\n16 Despite Plaintiff YANCEY's complete hearing impairment, staff did not indicate on the\n17 forms that Plaintiff YANCEY had a hearing disability. Accordingly, staff throughout the\n18 Jail were unable to identify Plaintiff YANCEY as hearing impaired, resulting in a lack of\n19 accommodations for his disability.\n20 151.  Plaintiff MURPHY was booked into the Jail in January 2013 with a\n21 permanent back injury that requires him to use a walker or cane to ambulate without pain.\n22 During the intake process, the Jail failed to identify him as having a mobility impairment\n23 requiring an accommodation, and he was not provided with a walker or a cane. Without a\n24 walker or cane, Plaintiff MURPHY avoids leaving his bed in order to reduce the pain that\n25 accompanies any attempt to walk.\n26 152.  Another prisoner who was booked into the Jail in January 2012 with a\n27 mobility impairment required a cane to help him safely ambulate and access his housing\n28 unit and also required a lower bunk housing assignment to safely access a bed. During the\n~~sz,s-zoo  II \n49\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page52 of 74\n1 intake process, the Jail failed to identify him as having a mobility impairment requiring\n2 those accommodations; he was not provided with a cane and the only available bed in his\n3 housing unit was on the upper bunk of a triple bunk. Without a cane, the prisoner fell and\n4 injured himself on a number of occasions. He has slept on the floor because it was too\n5 difficult for him to access his bunk.\n6 153.  Upon information and belief, Defendants do not maintain any central list,\n7 electronic or otherwise, of prisoners with disabilities and the accommodations they require.\n8 Defendants do not maintain adequate information about prisoners' disabilities and related\n9 accommodations in the prisoners' custody and/or medical files. Upon information and\n10 belief, to the extent that Defendants maintain information about a prisoner's disabilities in\n11 any form, custody, medical, and clerical staff are not provided with access to the\n12 information in a manner that would timely and effectively inform them of a prisoner's\n13 disabilities and required accommodations. Upon information and belief, Defendants do\n14 not adequately train staff to maintain records or information about prisoners' disabilities\n15 and related accommodations.\n16 154.  The lack of an adequate disability and accommodation tracking system\n17 results in substantial injuries to prisoners with disabilities. Without an adequate tracking\n18 system, medical and custody staff have no easily accessible means to determine whether a\n19 prisoner has a disability, and what, if any, accommodations that prisoner requires.\n20 Consequently, Defendants fail to provide prisoners with accommodations or withdraw\n21 accommodations that have already been provided without justification.\n22 155.  For example, Plaintiff YANCEY is deaf, cannot hear, and uses American\n23 Sign Language as his primary form of communication. Plaintiff YANCEY was not\n24 provided with a sign language interpreter for his communications with Jail staff, including\n25 at medical appointments, at a disciplinary hearing, and during the. booking and\n26 classification process.\n156.  Plaintiff SARABI was provided with crutches after he sustained an injury to\n28 his right leg when he was attacked by another prisoner on or around March 6, 2013.\np~s2is-2a~  II  SU\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page53 of 74\n1 However, on or around April 8, 2013, Plaintiff SARABI was called in for an unsolicited\n2 medical exam at which his crutches were prematurely taken away from him with no\n3 explanation, despite the fact that his right leg was not healed. Plaintiff SARABI could not\n4 use the restroom or shower without his crutches, and had to crawl around or hop on one\n5 foot to get around the Jail until his attorney contacted the Jail to request that the crutches\n6 be provided.\n7 157.  As another example, one prisoner whom the Jail identified as being a full-\n8 time wheelchair user had his wheelchair taken away from him for at least 14 hours. As a\n9 result of being denied the needed assistive device, he was rendered immobile, was unable\n10 to access the showers and restrooms, was forced to rely upon other prisoners for assistance,\n11 and was therefore placed at increased risk of being manipulated or attacked by other\n12 prisoners.\n13 B.  Defendants Lack an Effective Grievance Procedure for Prisoners to\nRequest Reasonable Disability Accommodations\n14\n15 158.  Defendants do not provide an effective or functional grievance system for\n16 prisoners with disabilities as required by the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.\n17 159.  Defendants do not provide prisoners with adequate notice of how to request\n18 ~~ reasonable accommodations for their disabilities. Upon information and belief, the only\n19 formal notice prisoners receive regarding any Jail grievance procedure comes from the\n20 \"Monterey County Adult Detention Facility Inmate Information Booklet\"( hereinafter\n21 \"Inmate Information Booklet\"), which is provided to each prisoner when booked into the\n22 Jail. Yet the Inmate Information Booklet does not discuss disabilities or the process for\n23 requesting disability accommodations. As a result, prisoners are not informed of any\n24 specific process for complaining about disability discrimination or requesting disability\n25 accommodations.\n26 160.  Defendants routinely deny prisoners access to grievance forms. Each\n27 prisoner is provided with only one grievance form which is attached to the Inmate\n28 Information Booklet provided during booking. Upon information and belief, grievance\np,sz,s-2o~  I \n51\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page54 of 74\n1 ~ forms are not freely available in the housing units.\n2 161.  Even when prisoners are able to submit grievances, Defendants frequently do\n3 not provide any response. For example, Plaintiff YANCEY submitted a grievance on\n4 ~ December 20, 2012, requesting a number of accommodations relating to his serious\n5 ~ hearing impairment, but he did not receive a response to the grievance. Plaintiff SARABI\n6 ~ submitted a grievance on April 4, 2013, requesting to see a doctor for the intense pain he\n7 ~ was experiencing in his foot (the source of his mobility impairment), but he also did not\n8 receive a response to the grievance. Plaintiff MURPHY submitted a grievance on Apri14,\n9 2013, requesting a cane or walker as an accommodation for his mobility impairment; he\n10 did not receive a response to the grievance either. Plaintiff HERNANDEZ has submitted\n11 at least four grievances regarding inadequate medical care since February 28, 2013, but did\n12 not receive responses.\n13 162.  Even when prisoners are able to submit a grievance and Defendants provide\n14 a response, Defendants' responses are not adequate or comprehensive, and may be\n15 arbitrary and counterproductive. For example, a prisoner filed a grievance requesting a\n16 walking cane to assist her in moving around the dorm, shower, and going to court. The\n17 response stated only that \"you did not have a `cane' when you came in to the facility. If\n18 you are having problems go on sick call.\"\n19 163.  Upon information and belief, Defendants lack adequate policies and\n20 procedures instructing health care or correctional officers how to respond if prisoners\n21 request accommodations through means other than the grievance process.\n22 164.  Upon information and belief, Defendants do not adequately train staff in how\n23 ~ ~ to provide, appropriately process, and timely respond to grievance forms.\n24 C.  Defendants Fail to Accommodate Prisoners with Hearing and Speech\nImpairments\n25\n26 165.  Prisoners with hearing, speech, and other communication impairments have\n27 problems effectively communicating with Jail staff. Prisoners with disabilities that impair\n28 communication require accommodations to ensure effective communication with prison\nX716216-20~  I I \n52 \nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page55 of 74\n1 staff and equal access to programs and services offered by the Jail. Defendants fail to\n2 provide such accommodations. Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to\n3 adequately train staff in how and when to provide such accommodations.\n4 166.  Defendants fail to provide prisoners with hearing and speech impairments\n5 with sign language interpreters, hearing aids, or other auxiliary aids. Plaintiff YANCEY\n6 has been booked into the Jail numerous times over the past three to five years. Plaintiff\n7 YANCEY is completely deaf, and also has a speech impairment that makes it difficult or\n8 impossible for him to communicate through spoken words. Plaintiff YANCEY uses\n9 American Sign Language( ASL) as his primary form of communication. Plaintiff\n10 YANCEY was not provided with a sign language interpreter by the Jail during his\n11 incarcerations in the Jail.\n12 167.  Defendants do not provide prisoners with hearing and speech impairments\n13 with sign language interpreters, hearing aids, or other auxiliary aids during the booking\n14 and intake process, which harms these prisoners by preventing them from communicating\n15 specific concerns, including emergency medical issues, and understanding Jail policies and\n16 practices.\n17 168.  For example, Defendants never provided Plaintiff YANCEY with a sign\n18 language interpreter during the booking process. When he was booked into the Jail for his\n19 most recent term, Plaintiff YANCEY's right arm was in a cast, making it impossible for\n20 Plaintiff YANCEY to communicate through written notes. Accordingly, he essentially\n21 lacked any means of communicating with the custody officers conducting the intake\n22 process.\n23 169.  Defendants fail to provide equal access to telephone services to prisoners\n24 who require the use of a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf/Teletype( \"TDD/TTY\").\n25 Non-TDD/TTY telephones are located in the housing units. Upon information and belief,\n26 prisoners without disabilities have access to non-TDD/TTY telephones any time the\n27 prisoner is permitted in the common area of his or her housing unit. Upon information and\n28 belief, telephone calls are limited to 30 minutes in length, though there is no limit to the\n~,s2,s-zoo  II \n53\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page56 of 74\n1~ number of telephone calls a prisoner may make so long as he or she does not abuse or\n2 ~ monopolize the telephone.\n3 170.  In contrast, there is one TDD/TTY for the entire Jail. Prisoners who require\n4 the use of the TDD/TTY must ask an officer to transport them to the office where the\n5 TDD/TTY is located. Officers frequently refused to transport Plaintiff YANCEY to the\n6 TDD/TTY, claiming that they were too busy to do so. Even when allowed to use the\n7 TDD/TTY, Plaintiff YANCEY was denied sufficient time to conduct a conversation, since\n8 using a TDD/TTY takes longer than using a telephone.\n9 171.  Defendants' policies and practices for equal access to telephone services are\n10 inadequate. Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train staff in how\n11 to provide equal access to telephone services.\n12 172.  Defendants fail to provide prisoners with hearing or speech impairments with\n13 sign language interpreters, hearing aids, or other auxiliary aids to permit participation in\n14 other Jail programs and services, including religious services and educational and\n15 vocational classes. For example, Plaintiff YANCEY was not provided with a sign\n16 language interpreter when attending religious services on a weekly basis at the Jail. As a\n17 result, he was not able to understand what was being said by the chaplain and other\n18 participants, and could not participate in the services himself.\n19 173.  Defendants do not provide equal access to television to prisoners who are\n20 hearing impaired. Upon information. and belief, most non-disciplinary housing units have\n21 televisions installed for prisoners to watch, but Plaintiff YANCEY was not able to\n22 understand what was being said on the television. Either Defendants have not installed\n23 televisions with the capability to display closed captioning or they refuse to alter the\n24 settings to the televisions to display closed captioning.\n25 174.  Defendants fail to provide sign language interpreters, hearing aids, and other\n26 auxiliary aids at disciplinary hearings even though prisoners risk a loss of credits and\n27 privileges if they are found guilty of disciplinary infractions. For example, Plaintiff\n28 YANCEY was charged with a rule violation on December 16, 2012. At the disciplinary\nI \n[716216-20]  54\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page57 of 74\n1 hearing, Plaintiff YANCEY was found guilty of the violation and punished with two\n2 weeks without visitation, canteen, or yard privileges. Plaintiff YANCEY was not provided\n3 with a sign language interpreter at the disciplinary hearing, and therefore was not able to\n4 defend himself or explain his version of the events. Without an interpreter, Plaintiff\n5 YANCEY also had difficulty understanding what the hearing officer and other Jail staff\n6 were saying.\n7 175.  By failing to provide Plaintiff YANCEY and other hearing impaired\n8 prisoners with sign language interpreters, hearing aids, or other auxiliary aids at\n9 disciplinary hearings, Defendants deny such prisoners the same opportunity to participate\n10 in the hearing regarding their guilt or innocence of the disciplinary charge and to present\n11 their views to the hearing officer that prisoners without disabilities have.\n12 D.  Defendants Knowingly Subject Prisoners with Disabilities to Dangerous\nConditions in the Jail\n13\n14 176.  Defendants fail to provide prisoners with hearing and speech impairments\nl5 with sign language interpreters, hearing aids, or other auxiliary aids for interactions with\n16 Jail medical and mental health care staff, despite the grave importance of the interactions.\n17 Defendants fail to provide these accommodations despite knowledge that such prisoners\n18 ~ cannot effectively communicate with staff without the accommodations and that the failure\n19 to communicate effectively places such prisoners at an increased risk that medical or\n20 mental health issues will not be not be diagnosed or will be misdiagnosed.\n21 177.  For example, during his most recent booking in the Jail, Plaintiff YANCEY\n22 had at least six medical appointments. Plaintiff YANCEY was not provided with a sign\n23 language interpreter at any of his appointments. Because there was no sign language\n24 interpreter to help him communicate with the medical staff, Plaintiff YANCEY was not\n25 able to explain that the pain medication he was being provided was insufficient to treat his\n26 pain. Accordingly, Plaintiff YANCEY's pain symptoms were not adequately treated.\n27 178.  Defendants endanger prisoners with hearing impairments by failing to\n28 ~ ~ institute any system for visually identifying prisoners with hearing impairments. If a fight\np~s~,s-zoo  I \n55\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page58 of 74\n1 breaks out in a housing unit, prison staff may order all prisoners to get down on the ground\n2 ~ or to line up against a wall. For any number of reasons, prison staff may also order a\n3 specific prisoner to cease or engage in certain behavior. Upon information and belief, Jail\n4 staff are authorized to initiate disciplinary proceedings and/or use force against prisoners\n5 who fail to comply with orders. Upon information and belief, the use of force for failure to\n6 comply with an order can include the use of Triers, non-lethal firearms (like \"flash bang\"\n7 grenades) and lethal firearms.\n8 179.  Prisoners with communication impairments, like Plaintiff YANCEY, are not\n9 capable of understanding and therefore are less likely to comply with alarms and oral\n10 orders from jail staff. Without a visual identification system by which staff can identify\n111 prisoners with communication impairments (e.g., vests), there is an increased risk that staff\n12 will not recognize that a prisoner has a hearing impairment and will interpret such\n13 prisoner's actions as a failure to comply with an order, rather than as a failure to hear\n14 and/or understand the order. As a result, prisoners with hearing impairments are at\n15 increased risk that staff will initiate disciplinary proceedings and/or use force for failure to\n16 comply with an order that they have not heard.\n17 180.  Upon information and belief, Defendants lack any policy, practice, or system\n18 for notifying prisoners with disabilities of emergencies, including alarms, fires, and\n19 earthquakes. Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train staff in how\n20 to notify prisoners with disabilities of emergencies. Upon information and belief, the Jail\n21 does not have a visual or tactile alarm system installed to alert prisoners with disabilities.\n22 Because Defendants lack a system for identifying prisoners with disabilities, including\n23 those with hearing impairments, or notifying prisoners with disabilities of an emergency,\n24 these prisoners may not be aware of an emergency, or may need assistance during the\n25 emergency, and are therefore at increased risk of injury or death should one occur.\n26 181:  Upon information and belief, Defendants lack any policies or practices to\n27 ensure that prisoners with difficulty walking, including prisoners in wheelchairs, are safely\n28 evacuated from the Jail in the event of an emergency. Upon information and belief,\np16216-20]  II  5\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTNE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page59 of 74\n1 Defendants fail to adequately train staff in how to ensure that prisoners with mobility\n2 impairments are safely evacuated from the Jail in an emergency. Upon. information and\n3 belief, the emergency exits in the Jail, to the extent they exist, are not accessible to\n4 prisoners in wheelchairs. As a result, prisoners with difficulty ambulating are at increased\n5 risk of injury or death if an emergency, like a fire or earthquake, were to occur.\n6 182.  Defendants endanger prisoners with mobility impairments by failing to\n7 institute any system for staff to visually identify prisoners with mobility impairments.\n8 Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train staff in how to visually\n9 identify prisoners with mobility impairments. Upon information and belief, in response to\n10 alarms or other incidents in the Jail, custody staff frequently order prisoners to \"prone out,\"\n11 i.e., lay down on the ground, face down. Upon information and belief,j ail staff are\n12 authorized to initiate disciplinary proceedings and/or use force against prisoners who fail\n13 to prone out when ordered to do so. Upon information and belief, the use of force for\n14 failure to comply with an order to prone out can include the use of Tasers, non-lethal\n15 firearms (like \"flash bang\" grenades) and lethal firearms.\n16 183.  Some prisoners with mobility impairments, like Plaintiff SARABI, are\n17 incapable of complying with an order to prone out because of their mobility impairments.\n18 Without a visual identification system by which staff can identify prisoners with such\n19 mobility impairments (e.g., a vest or certain color of clothing), there is an increased risk\n20 that custody staff will not recognize that a prisoner has a mobility impairment and will\n21 interpret such a prisoner's failure to prone out as a failure to comply with an order, rather\n22 than an inability to comply with the order. As a result, prisoners with mobility\n23 impairments are at increased risk that staff will initiate disciplinary proceedings and/or use\n24 force for failure to comply with an order to prone out with which they cannot comply\n25 because of their disability.\n26 E.  Defendants Routinely Fail to Provide Prisoners with Disabilities with\nNeeded Assistive Devices\n27\n28 184.  Defendants lack policies and practices to ensure that prisoners with\n~,s~~s-2o~  II  57\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page60 of 74\n1 disabilities who require assistive devices, including, but not limited to, wheelchairs,\n2 walkers, crutches, canes, braces, tapping canes, hearing aids, and pocket talkers, as\n3 accommodations are provided with and are allowed to retain those devices. Upon\n4 information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train staff in how to timely and\n5 appropriately provide assistive devices to prisoners with disabilities.\n6 185.  Because of Defendants' deficient disability screening procedure and\n7 inadequate grievance process, prisoners who require assistive devices to access Jail\n8 programs are frequently not identified. As a result, those prisoners do not receive needed\n9 assistive devices and cannot access the programs and services offered by the Jail.\n10 186.  Upon information and belief, Defendants deny prisoners certain assistive\n11 devices, claiming that such items are not permitted in the Jail. For example, Plaintiff\n12 MURPHY, who uses a cane to ambulate and required a lower bunk housing assignment\n13 while at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, requested during the\n14 booking process that he be provided with a cane or walker. He was informed by Jail staff\n15 that canes and walkers were not allowed in the Jail.\n16 187.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have refused to provide some\n17 ~~ prisoners with assistive devices as an accommodation for a disability, even after\n18 Defendants have identified the person as a qualified individual with a disability and as\n19 needing a particular assistive device. Upon information and belief, Defendants have\n20 informed such prisoners that they are permitted to possess certain assistive devices, but\n21 only if someone from outside of the Jail, like a family member, friend, or community\n22 organization provides the assistive device. Unless the assistive device is provided by a\n23 third party, such prisoners may be denied reasonable accommodations necessary for them\n24 to access programs and services offered by the Jail.\n25 188.  Even when the Jail provides a prisoner with an assistive device, Defendants\n26 unjustifiably remove these devices from prisoners, as alleged in paragraph 156, supra.\n27\n28\n[716216-20]  I I  5\nCNIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page61 of 74\n1 F.  Defendants Fail to Provide Prisoners with Disabilities with Safe and\nAccessible Housing\n2\n3 189.  Defendants fail to ensure that prisoners with disabilities are assigned to and\n4 are actually housed in housing units and bed assignments. that are accessible and safe.\n~yl Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train staff in how to house\nprisoners with disabilities in accessible and safe housing.\n0~\n190.  The Jail consists of five main housing areas—the Rehabilitation Center, the\nMen's Section, K-Pod, the Dorm Section, and the Women's Section.\n9 191.  Each housing area is separated into a number of smaller housing units. The\n10 housing units differ in their design, and importantly, in their accessibility to prisoners with\n11 disabilities. Some of the housing units are dorm housing units, where many beds,\n12 including triple bunks, are placed in an open area together that is shared by the prisoners.\n13 Other housing units consist of celled housing, where the unit is divided into a number of\n14 cells with doors in which one or two prisoners are housed. Cells that house two prisoners\n15 typically have bunk beds in them.\n16 192.  Some of the housing units in the Jail are located up flights of stairs, while\n17 others are on the ground floor.\n18 193.  Defendants control housing unit assignments. In housing units with celled\n19 housing, Defendants also assign prisoners to a particular cell.\n20 194.  Upon information and belief, Defendants make decisions regarding where to\n21 house a particular prisoner without taking into account the prisoner's disability-related\n22 limitations. Because of Defendants' general failure to identify and track prisoners with\n23 disabilities, Defendants decide where to house a prisoner without sufficient information\n24 regarding the prisoner's limitations; this practice significantly increases the risk that a\n2S prisoner will be assigned to a housing unit that is not accessible to him or her, because it\n26 lacks adequate toilets or grab bars in the shower, or because it is up a flight of stairs or\n27 lacks space for a wheelchair, or other reasons.\n28 195.  One prisoner who was housed in the Jail for a significant period of time was\np,sz,szo~  I  59  _\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page62 of 74\n1~a full-time wheelchair user. Defendants generally permitted this prisoner to retain his .\n2 wheelchair in the Jail, meaning that Defendants were aware of his mobility impairment.\n3 Nonetheless, Defendants housed this prisoner in the C-Dorm and D-Dorm within the Dorm\n4 Section. The C-Dorm and D-Dorm are not wheelchair accessible, do not have toilets and\n5 showers with grab bars, do not have shower chairs, and have lips between the housing\n6 areas and the showers. This prisoner fell four times while housed in those dories when\n7 attempting to access the toilets and showers, injuring himself each time he fell. He also\n8 was frequently forced to rely on other prisoner's for assistance to access the toilets and\n9 showers.\n10 196.  Another prisoner who was afull-time wheelchair user was permitted to\n11 retain his wheelchair, indicating that Defendants were aware of his mobility impairment.\n12 Nevertheless, Defendants housed this prisoner in the B-Dorm for 30-45 days. This\n13 prisoner had difficulty accessing almost every feature of B-Dorm, including the bathroom.\n14 Specifically, this prisoner was forced to shower while sitting in his wheelchair due to the\n15 lack of a shower chair, and had to rely on other inmates to press the shower button for him\n16 because he could not reach it. This prisoner also had to rely on other prisoners to lift him\n17 onto the toilet.\n18 197.  Defendants house many of the prisoners with disabilities in the Rotunda\n19~~ housing unit within the Men's Section. The recreation yards for the Men's Section\n20 (including the Rotunda), the Women's Section, and K-Pod are located on the roof of the\n21 Jail. In order to access the yards, prisoners must walk up one long flight of stairs and then\n22 down a smaller flight of stairs. The stairways are the only means of reaching the yard.\n23 Because the yard is located on the roof, prisoners who are housed in the Men's Section,\n24 Women's Section, or K-Pod and who have mobility or vision impairments that make\n25 walking up or down stairs difficult, painful, impossible, or dangerous are denied access to\n26 the recreation yard.\n27 198.  For example, because of the severe pain Plaintiff MURPHY experiences\n28 when walking without a cane, Plaintiff MURPHY has rarely accessed the yard since he\n[716216-20]  II  (~O\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page63 of 74\n1 ;arrived at the Jail on January 18, 2013. If the yard for the Men's Section was not up a\n2 flight of stairs, and if he had a cane to ambulate, Plaintiff MURPHY would have gone to\n3 the yard most times that it was offered to him.\n4 199.  Another prisoner who has a mobility impairment that makes walking up\n5 stairs extremely difficult and painful was assigned to F-Pod. This prisoner declined to go\n6 to yard every time that it was offered because the pain and difficulty of climbing the stairs\n7 was too great. On at least one occasion, despite this prisoner's mobility impairments,\n8 Defendants forced him to climb the stairs to the yard when Defendants were conducting\n9 searches of cells in F-Pod. The prisoner specifically requested that he be excused from the\n10 need to go to the yard; Defendants denied his request. When he had to walk up to the yard,\n11 it caused him great pain and placed him at serious risk of falling and further injuring\n12 himself.\n13 200.  Upon information and belief, Defendants lack policies and practices for\n14 ensuring the prisoners who require lower bunk bed assignments actually receive lower\n15 bunk bed assignments. Upon information and belief, in many housing units, Defendants\n16 have essentially no system for assigning particular prisoners to specific beds. Instead,\n17 especially in dorm housing units, Defendants typically abdicate the assignment and\n18 selection of beds in the housing unit to the prisoners themselves, who will be assigned to\n19 the newly-vacated bed. In some dorm housing units, bed assignments and selection are\n20 determined by who has been in the unit for the longest period of time. In units that include\n21 a significant number of gang members, bed assignments may be determined by the leaders\n22 of the gang within the unit.\n23 201.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have no means for ensuring that\n24 prisoners who require lower bunk bed assignments are actually able to sleep in lower\n25 bunks, and have no mechanism for guaranteeing that prisoners who should not be housed\n26 in triple bunks avoid such bed placements. As a result, prisoners who require lower bunk\nand non-triple bunk bed assignments as accommodations for their disabilities may be\nforced to sleep on upper bunks and in triple bunks rather than experience the pain and\n[716216-20~  II  6\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page64 of 74\n1 danger of sleeping in an inaccessible bed.\n2 202.  A prisoner booked into the jail in January 2012 with a mobility impairment\n3 required a lower bunk housing assignment to safely access a bed. During the intake\n4 process, the Jail failed to identify him as having a mobility impairment requiring that\n5 accommodation. In the housing unit to which he was assigned, the only available bed was\n6 on the upper bunk of a triple bunk. No prisoner in the unit would agree to switch bed\n7 assignments with him. Rather than sleep on the upper bunk, he slept on the floor because\n8 it was too difficult and dangerous for him to access the available bed.\n9 G.  Defendants Fail to Provide Prisoners with Disabilities with Equal Access\nto Programs and Services Offered by the Jail\n10\n203.  Defendants house prisoners with serious mental illness in lockdown units,\n11\nisolation cells, and/or rubber rooms. Prisoners who are housed in \"lockdown\" units have\n12\nfar less freedom to move around and to interact with other prisoners, and generally only\n13\nare permitted outside of their cells for one hour per day. During that one hour per day,\n14\nprisoners are expected to shower, exercise, and use the telephone. This leaves little to no\n15\ntime for program participation. Prisoners who are housed in isolation cells lack freedom to\n16\nmove around and interact with other prisoners, and have extremely limited (if any) access\n17\nto programs and services at the Jail'. Prisoners who are housed in rubber rooms do not\n18\nleave the room, do not interact with other prisoners, do not receive mental health\n19\ntreatment, and do not access any programs or services for the duration of their time in the\n20\nrubber room. Accordingly, prisoners with serious mental health illnesses are denied equal\n21\naccess to programs and services offered by the Jail through Defendants' discriminatory\n22\nhousing practices.\n23\n204.  Defendants' failure to provide prisoners with medically necessary treatment\n24\n(including mental health care and all medications) not only exposes prisoners to an\n25\nunreasonable risk of harm, but it also denies these prisoners equal access to programs and\n26\nservices offered by the Jail. For example, prisoners who have not received adequate\n27\nmedical care may be not be physically capable of accessing services offered by the Jail\n28\n[716216-20]\nCIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document1   Filed05/23/13   Page65 of 74\n1 precisely because their medical needs have not been adequately addressed. Prisoners who\n2 have not received adequate mental health care may not be psychologically capable of\n3 participating in programs offered by the Jail because their mental health needs have not\n4 been appropriately treated. By failing to provide prisoners with adequate medical and\n5 mental health care, Defendants deny equal access to Jail programs and services.\n6 205.  Upon information and belief, Defendants fail to adequately train staff in how\n7 to provide equal access to Jail services and programs.\n8 H.  By Failing to Provide Disability Accommodations, Defendants Place\nPrisoners with Disabilities at Increased Risk of Exploitation and Harm\n9\n10 206.  Prisoners with disabilities that are not accommodated are susceptible to\n11 exploitation by other prisoners. For example, in exchange for help getting to the toilet,\n12' shower, or meals, or communicating with prison staff, prisoners with disabilities may be\n13 required to pay other prisoners, potentially leading to increased risk of violence or even\n14 rape.\n15 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983)\n16 By the Prisoner Class Against Defendants Monterey County, Monterey County\nSheriff  Office, and California Forensic Medical Group\ns \n17\n18 207.

The ADA prohibits public entities, including the COUNTY and the\n3 SHERIFF'S  OFFICE from denying \"a qualified individual with a disability ... the benefits\n4 of the services, programs, or activities of[ the] public entity\" because of the individual's\n5 ~ disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n6 221.  The COUNTY and SHERIFF'S OFFICE are legally responsible for all\n7 violations of the ADA committed by CFMG in the course of performing its duties under its\n8 contractual arrangement with the SHERIFF'S OFFICE to provide medical and mental\n9 health care services to prisoners in the Jail. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1).\n10 222.  The ADA defines \"a qualified individual with a disability\" as a person who\n11 suffers from a \"physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major\n12 life activities,\" including, but not limited to, \"caring for oneself, performing manual tasks,\n13 seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing,\n14 learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.\" 42 U.S.C.\n15 § 12102(1)(A),( 2)(A). All Plaintiffs are qualified individuals with disabilities as defined\n16 in the ADA, as they have impairments that substantially limit one or more major life\n17 activities.\n18 223.  The programs, services, and activities that Defendants provide to prisoners\n19 include, but are not limited to, sleeping, eating, showering, toileting, communicating with\n20 those outside the Jail by mail and telephone, exercising, entertainment, safety and security,\n21 the Jail's administrative, disciplinary, and classification proceedings, medical, mental\n22 health, and dental services, the library, educational, vocational, substance abuse, and anger\n23 management classes, and discharge services. Defendants' programs, services and\n24 activities are covered by the ADA.\n25 224.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations\n5 previously made in paragraphs 1 through 235, above.\n6 237.  Defendants receive financial assistance from the State of California as part of\n7 Realignment Legislation, Government Code §§ 30025, 30026, and 30029, and through\n8 other statutes and funding mechanisms. Plaintiffs and the Prisoner Class they represent are\n9 all persons with disabilities within the meaning of Government Code § 11135.\n10 238.  As described in this Complaint, Defendants deny all Plaintiffs full access to\n11 the benefits of the Jail's programs and activities which receive financial assistance from\n12 the State of California and unlawfully subject Plaintiffs and the Prisoner Class they\n13 represent to discrimination within the meaning of Government Code § 11135(a) on the\n14 basis of their disabilities.\n15 239.  From February 2012 through May 2013, through their counsel and through\n16 grievances submitted to the Jail, Plaintiffs and the Prisoner Class they represent demanded\n17 that Defendants stop their unlawful discriminatory conduct described above, but\n18 Defendants refused and still refuse to refrain from that conduct.\n19 240.  Defendants' unlawful and discriminatory conduct, described above, unless\n20 and until enjoined and restrained by order of this Court, will cause great and irreparable\n21 injury to all Plaintiffs and the Prisoner Class they represent in that Plaintiffs and the\n22 Prisoner Class are repeatedly subjected to discrimination, risk of injury, and denial of full\n23 and equal access to the beneft s, programs and services provided by the Jail.\n24 241.

The inmates \n1 \nseek declaratory and injunctive relief from the alleged constitutional violations.  \n2 \n3  After reviewing the substantial record compiled by the parties, which includes four neutral \n4  expert reports, two outside expert reports commissioned at the County’s request, declarations from \n5 \ntwo experts retained by Plaintiffs and various inmates, the court finds that Plaintiffs meet the \n6 \nstandard for class certification set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and as construed by \n7 \nthe Ninth Circuit.  It therefore certifies a class of inmates challenging jail safety and health care \n8 \npolicies and practices, and a subclass of inmates challenging jail disability policies and practices.2 \n9 \n10                                                             \n2 The court may take judicial notice of a “fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it is \n \na\ni 11  generally known” or “can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy \nn\nt or cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Fed. R. Evid. 201(b).  If the fact is not in dispute and may be \nrf\nuli 12  verified by resort to the public record, see id., the court takes judicial notice as requested.   \noa\nCC\nrict ct of  13  Sheriff’Ps lOaifnftiicfefs t ofi rtshte r Meqounetset rtehya tS tuhpee crioourr Ct toaukret  jiund ainci aatlt nemotpicte t oo fr e5l5ie avpep olivceartcioronws dminadge,  abnyd t he \nisttri 14  subsequent orders.  See Docket No. 49-11, Ex. Z; Docket No. 54 at 1.  The court takes judicial \nDs\ni notice of these applications and orders because they were filed in state court.  Second, Plaintiffs ask \n D\ns\nten  15  the court to take judicial notice of County charts documenting the jail’s average daily population.  \nar\nte See Docket No. 49-13, Ex. AA and BB; Docket No. 54 at 2.  As the daily inmate population is \nSh\nd ort 16  verifiable and not in dispute, the court takes judicial notice.  Third, Plaintiffs seek judicial notice of \neN\nnite  17  minutes of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors in which the Board approved legislation to \nUh “accept the Jail Facility Needs Assessment Report.”  See Docket No. 49-16, Ex. FF; Docket No. 54 \nt\n \nor 18  at 3.  The court takes judicial notice of this legislative enactment.  Fourth, Plaintiffs request judicial \nF\nnotice of the Monterey County Correction Facility Information Manual and certain sections of the \n19  Custody Operations Bureau’s Policies and Procedures.  See Docket Nos. 49-1, Ex. E; Docket No. \n49-2; Ex. F; Docket No. 54 at 3-4.  The court takes judicial notice of these agency manuals, rules \n20 \nand policies not subject to a reasonable dispute.  Fifth, Plaintiffs ask for judicial notice of the \nUnited States Census Bureau Report on Americans with Disabilities.  See Docket No. 49-17; Ex. \n21 \nII; Docket No. 54 at 4.  The accuracy of these facts are verifiable and certain, and so the court again \n22  takes judicial notice.  \nThe County first seeks judicial notice of Monterey County Board Orders:  approving \n23  Amendment #1 to Agreement A-1083, see Docket No. 140-1, Ex. A; Docket No. 133-1 at 2; \ndesignating the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office as the authorized representative on Medi-Cal \n24 \napplications, see id., Ex. B; Docket No. 133-1 at 2; authorizing $4,032,778 in County funds to be \nused for the County of Monterey Jail Housing Addition, see id., Ex. C; Docket No. 133-1 at 2; \n25 \nauthorizing an additional $4,867,222 in County funds to be used for the Jail Housing Addition \n26  Project, see id., Ex. D; Docket No. 133-1 at 2; and authorizing Sheriff Scott Miller to submit an \napplication for a local adult detention facility construction grant and expenditure of $200,000.  See \n27  id., Ex. E; Docket No. 133-1 at 2.  The court takes judicial notice that these board orders occurred.  \nSecond, the County seeks judicial notice of affidavits and minute orders of conflict as to Glenda \n28 \nHunter, Angel Perez, Ha Ngoc Tran, Dennis Guyot, Albert Key and Brandon Mefford.  See id., Ex. \n2 \nCase No.: 5:13-cv-2354-PSG \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASS AND DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE \n\n \nI. \n1 \nThe United States and California Constitutions require California’s counties to provide for \n2 \n3  the safety and well-being of inmates housed in county jails.3  To meet these obligations, as well as \n4  those imposed by federal and state statutes,4 Monterey County has promulgated extensive policies \n5 \ngoverning health care and conditions of confinement.  These policies apply to all of the inmates in \n6 \nits custody and all of its staff throughout its main jail in Salinas. \n7 \nSince 1984, Monterey County has contracted with CFMG, a private health care provider, to \n8 \nprovide medical, dental and mental-health care services to inmates.  Under the terms of its contract, \n9 \nCFMG agreed to follow all County policies and to work with the County to implement additional \n10 \n \na\nni 11  policies governing such matters as health care staffing, access to prescriptions, emergency care, \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  and mental health services.  Monterey County regularly monitors CFMG’s compliance with these \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  policies. \nisttri 14 \nDs\ni Twenty-one current or former inmates brought this suit.  Plaintiffs allege a variety of jail \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe policies and practices “fail to keep [inmates] safe from violence, to deliver adequate medical and \nd ort 16 \nnitee N 17  mental health care or to provide required assistance to [inmates] with disabilities.”5  Plaintiffs \nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18  support these general allegations with detailed references to dozens of specific jail policies and \nF\n19  practices, including inadequate staffing, training, space, inmate classification, intake health \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n20 \nH-N; Docket No. 133-1 at 3.  The court takes judicial notice of the Public Defenders’ declarations \n21  of conflict. \nCFMG requests the court take judicial notice of a judicial order at Exhibit G to the Bertling \n22  Declaration.  See Docket Nos. 243, 184-2, Ex. G.   The court does not do so because Exhibit G to \nthe Bertling Declaration is actually a deposition. \n23   \n3 See U.S. CONST. amend. VIII; U.S. CONST. amend. XIV; CA Const. art. I, § 7; CA Const. art. I, § \n24 \n17. \n \n25 \n4 See, e.g. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; Rehabilitation Act \n26  of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 701; Cal. Gov’t Code § 11135.  \n \n27  5 Docket No. 56 at 1.  While Plaintiffs refer to jail residents as “prisoners,” the court will adhere to \nthe alternative reference of “inmates.” \n28 \n \n3 \nCase No.: 5:13-cv-2354-PSG \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASS AND DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE \n\n \nscreening, care scheduling, medication, infection control, emergency response and suicidal inmate \n1 \nsegregation. \n2 \n3  Plaintiffs also claim that inmates are routinely denied reasonable accommodation for their \n4  disabilities.  They allege, for example, that inmates who cannot climb stairs spend months without \n5 \ngoing outside because the exercise yard can only be accessed up a flight of stairs.  Inmates who use \n6 \nsign language to communicate are not provided interpreters for the intake process, doctor’s \n7 \nappointments and disciplinary hearings.  Defendants are further alleged not to maintain any central \n8 \nlist, electronic or otherwise, of inmates with disabilities and the accommodations they require.  The \n9 \nresult, say Plaintiffs, is that “because Defendants completely lack policies and practices for \n10 \n \na\nni 11  evacuating and communicating with [inmates] with disabilities in case of emergencies, including \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  natural disasters and security incidents, [inmates] with disabilities are at increased risk of injury in \nCC\nrict ct of  13  such circumstances.”6 \nisttri 14 \nDs\ni With respect to all these claims, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants are aware of these \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe constitutionally defective conditions and tolerate the resulting risk to which inmates are exposed.  \nd ort 16 \neN\nnite  17  For example, Plaintiffs allege that in 2007, the County commissioned a third-party evaluation of \nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18  the jail, which resulted in a June 19, 2007 report called “County of Monterey, Office of the Sheriff, \nF\n19  Needs Assessment.”  The 2007 report concluded that “[t]he current combination of insufficient \n20 \nbeds, an inadequate detention facility and understaffing has resulted in an almost untenable \n21 \nsituation.  In 2011, the County asked the third-party consultant to update the 2007 report to reflect \n22 \namendments to state law and changes within the Sheriff’s Office and the jail population.  This \n23 \nupdated report, dated December 30, 2011, reached the exact same, word-for-word conclusion:  \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n                                                           \n6 Id. at 19.  \n28 \n \n4 \nCase No.: 5:13-cv-2354-PSG \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASS AND DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE \n\n \n“The current combination of insufficient beds, an inadequate detention facility and understaffing \n1 \nhas resulted in an almost untenable situation.”7 \n2 \n3  Plaintiffs seek a declaration that Defendants are violating federal and state law and an \n4  injunction compelling Defendants to provide inmates with adequate protection from violence from \n5 \nother inmates, to provide inmates with adequate medical and mental health care, and to provide \n6 \nreasonable accommodations to and cease discriminating against inmates with disabilities.8 \n7 \nII. \n8 \nShortly after filing their second amended complaint,9 Plaintiffs moved for class \n9 \ncertification.  In addition to the detailed allegations of their complaint, Plaintiffs cite thousands of \n10 \n \na\nni 11  pages of documents that they secured by investigation and from public records requests, expert \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  reports by four neutral specialists in prison medical care and conditions of confinement retained by \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  mutual agreement of the parties, two reports on conditions at the jail commissioned by the County \nisttri 14 \nDs\ni in 2007 and 2011, two declarations from experts they retained and their own declarations.  The \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe investigation and records requests produced (1) more than one hundred interviews of former and \nd ort 16 \neN\nnite  17  current inmates in the jail; (2) tens of thousands of pages of medical and custody records for \nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18  current and former inmates in the jail; (3) documents produced by the County in response to three \nF\n19  requests for information pursuant to the California Public Records Act and (4) hundreds of \n20 \nSheriff’s Office reports of incidents that occurred in the jail. \n21 \nIn their responses, Defendants submit declarations from attorneys, jail staff and medical \n22 \nexperts, news articles, depositions, declarations, grievance and medical records of Plaintiffs, board \n23 \norders for improvements and a letter from Monterey County Public Defender James Egar praising \n24 \n                                                           \n7 See Docket No. 41 at 3:9-22. \n25 \n \n26  8 See id. at 132-35. \n \n27  9 On September 29, 2014, the court denied Defendants’ motions to dismiss the second amended \ncomplaint.  See Docket No. 128. \n28 \n \n5 \nCase No.: 5:13-cv-2354-PSG \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASS AND DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE \n\n \nCFMG’s work.10  They claim conditions have improved, despite difficulties due to inmate \n1 \nrealignment resulting from the enactment of Assembly Bill 109.11  \n2 \n3  A. \n4    The 135-page second amended complaint in this case sets out detailed factual allegations \n5 \nconcerning the existence of jail policies and practices impacting the safety, health and disability \n6 \naccommodations of all inmates.  According to Plaintiffs, these policies and practices expose all jail \n7 \ninmates to a substantial risk of harm.  \n8 \n  Regarding their safety claims, Plaintiffs allege the following policies and practices:  (1) \n9 \ninsufficient custody staffing;  (2) inadequate inmate classification system; (3) dangerous and \n10 \n \na\nni 11  inadequate jail facilities that are difficult to safely monitor; (4) housing more inmates in the jail \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  than the jail’s rated capacity and (5) inadequate training of custody staff.   \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict    Regarding their medical care claims, Plaintiffs allege the following policies and practices:  \nisttri 14 \nDs\ni (1) failure to provide timely access to health care; (2) insufficient custody staffing to ensure \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe inmates receive necessary health care; (3) insufficient health care staff to ensure the timely and \nd ort 16 \neN\nnite  17  appropriate treatment of inmates’ serious medical needs; (4) failure to adequately supervise health \nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18  care staff; (5) failure to provide adequate, clean and confidential clinical spaces;(6) inadequate or \nF\n19  non-existent written policies for intake health screening, health care requests, emergency response, \n20 \ncontinuity of medications, care for inmates with chronic illness, housing of inmates in segregation, \n21 \ncare for developmentally disabled inmates, care for patients on dialysis, care for elderly patients, \n22 \ncare for patients with dementia, care for patients requiring wheelchairs, care for inmates who have \n23 \nphysical disabilities, housing for pregnant women, persons with communicable diseases, the \n24 \nmentally ill and the terminally ill; (7) failure to adequately identify inmates in need of health care, \n25 \n26                                                             \n10 See Docket Nos. 133-179; 299, 369, 368. \n27   \n11 See, e.g., Docket No. 169 at 17, 19, 29;

(8) use of \n1 \ninadequately trained custody staff to conduct intake health screening; (9) failure to provide \n2 \n3  adequate treatment to inmates with chronic diseases; (10) failure to provide adequate treatment to \n4  inmates with infectious diseases; (11) failure to provide timely and appropriately treatment by \n5 \noutside medical providers and specialists when necessary; (12) failure to provide timely and \n6 \nadequate treatment for inmates experiencing withdrawal;

(2) failure to provide inmates access to \nF\n19  timely and appropriate inpatient mental health care; (3) inadequate suicide prevention policies and \n20 \npractices; (4) failure to provide suicidal and self-harming inmates adequate mental health care; (5) \n21 \nhousing inmates with mental illness in administrative segregation because they have mental \n22 \nillnesses; (6) failure to provide a clean, safe and therapeutic location for the housing of inmates at \n23 \nrisk for suicide; (7) inappropriate use of safety cells, restraints and restraint chairs; (8) failure to \n24 \nadequately monitor inmates at risk of suicide and (9) failure to eliminate suicide hazards in \n25 \n26  administrative segregation. \n27 \n28 \n7 \nCase No.: 5:13-cv-2354-PSG \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASS AND DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE \n\n \n  Regarding their disability accommodation claims, Plaintiffs allege the following policies \n1 \nand practices:  (1) failure to identify and track inmates with disabilities; (2) failure to identify and \n2 \n3  track the accommodations that inmates with disabilities require; (3) failure to ensure that inmates \n4  with disabilities receive and retain needed assistive devices and auxiliary aids; (4) failure to ensure \n5 \nthat inmates with disabilities that require accommodations in housing receive and retain \n6 \nappropriate housing assignments; (5) housing inmates with disabilities in administrative \n7 \nsegregation, where inmates have less access to programs, services, activities and privileges; (6) \n8 \nfailure to provide sufficient housing for inmates in wheelchairs; (7) failure to ensure that each \n9 \nprogram, service or activity offered to inmates in the jail, when viewed in its entirety, is readily \n10 \n \na\nni 11  accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; (8) failure to ensure that each part of the \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  facilities at the jail altered after January 26, 1992, in a manner that affects or could affect the \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  usability of all or part of the jail, complies with relevant accessibility standards, including the \nisttri 14 \nDs\ni Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards, the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe Guidelines and the 2010 Americans with Disability Act Standard for Accessible Design;

For example, regarding \n25 \n26  Defendants’ alleged safety policies and practices, Plaintiffs allege roughly 150 separate instances \n27  of violence were reported from (presumably January) 2011 to September 2012, occurring in nearly \n28 \n8 \nCase No.: 5:13-cv-2354-PSG \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASS AND DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE \n\n \nevery area of the jail, and most requiring medical attention at the jail or the local hospital.  \n1 \nWeapons such as shanks and Tomahawks are “readily available” in the jail.12  Surveillance is \n2 \n3  inadequate, as many assailants remain unidentified, most cameras do not have recording \n4  capabilities, and the jail’s understaffing means officers are rarely positioned to visually identify the \n5 \nattackers.  Reporting is inadequate for fear of retaliation given the lax conditions.  Undertraining of \n6 \nstaff means inadequate intervention and confiscation of weapons.  Plaintiffs say that despite \n7 \nincident reports and the 2007 and 2011 Jail Needs Assessments, Defendants lack policies and \n8 \npractices for regularly reviewing incident reports to identify systemic problems.13 \n9 \n  As another example, regarding the alleged medical care policies and practices, Plaintiffs \n10 \n \na\nni 11  claim that “[t]hough Defendants have a policy that all [inmates] are supposed to be seen by medical \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  staff on the next available sick call day after submitting a sick call slip, in practice, Defendants use \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs) to screen the sick call slips and determine whether the \nisttri 14 \nDs\ni [inmate] should actually be seen by medical or mental health care staff.

Many inmates report filing multiple sick call slips for emerging and \n6 \nbeginning staph-related wounds, but are not seen until their wounds develop into serious and \n7 \nemergency conditions requiring intense treatment.16  The complaint explains that “one [inmate] \n8 \nwas not seen for a staph-infection-caused wound until it developed into cellulitis and a necrotizing \n9 \nsoft tissue infection, requiring intensive and invasive treatment.  Another [inmate] had a staph \n10 \n \na\nni 11  infection-caused abscess that required the insertion of a surgical drain into the wound, which \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  Defendants then failed to properly monitor and cleanse following the procedure.”17 \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict    Yet another example of Plaintiffs’ medical care claims concern Defendants’ alleged \nisttri 14 \nDs\ni policies and practices for medical screening.  Plaintiffs allege “Defendants fail to adequately train \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe custody and medical staff in how to timely and appropriately identify medical problems during the \nd ort 16 \neN\nnite  17  screening and intake process.

As one example, he submitted \n20 \na sick call slip on October 2, 2012, complaining of not receiving certain medications for his \nstomach and was experiencing strong cramping pains; he was not fully evaluated by appropriate \n21 \nmedical staff until October 26, 2012—24 days later.”   Id. at 44:12-24.  As another example, \n22  Plaintiff Hernandez submitted sick call slips related to pain in his abdomen on November 18, 25, \nand December 2, 2012. He was not evaluated by an appropriate provider prior to being transferred \n23  to the hospital on or around December 11, 2013 for his ileostomy reversal surgery, a period of 23 \ndays.”  Plaintiffs similarly allege that “[w]hen Plaintiff Sarabi complained about intense pain in his \n24 \nright foot/ankle, and voiced concern about a broken ankle and a possible concussion one hour after \nhe was attacked by another inmate, one of the guards outside his room said, “You’re a tough guy, \n25 \nsuck it up, if you had broken your ankle you would be in more pain.”  Id. at 46:12-17. \n26   \n16 See id. at 45. \n27   \n17 See id. \n28 \n \n10 \nCase No.: 5:13-cv-2354-PSG \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASS AND DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE \n\n \nnot even play a role in screening the [inmate].”18  Plaintiffs further allege that “[c]ustody staff (who \n1 \nare not sufficiently trained to identify medical needs) complete a brief one-page health screening \n2 \n3  form during a cursory interview with the [inmate] in a non-confidential space.  Medical staff only \n4  evaluate [inmates] at intake if the custody staff note a problem on the screening form.  The \n5 \nscreening form used by custody fails to capture critical and basic information necessary to identify \n6 \n[inmates] in need of medical attention.”19 \n7 \n  Regarding Defendants’ alleged mental health policies and practices, in addition to intake \n8 \nand tracking problems, Plaintiffs allege that “Defendants sometimes place [inmates] who arrive at \n9 \nthe jail and who are prescribed psychotropic medications on what Defendants call a detoxification \n10 \n \na\nni 11  treatment. The detoxification treatment involves refusing, for up to 90 days, to provide [inmates] \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  with the psychotropic medications they were taking before they were booked into the Jail. . . . \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  [Inmates] placed on the detoxification treatment and removed from psychotropic medications \nisttri 14 \nDs\ni experience unnecessary pain and increases in psychiatric symptoms including paranoia, \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe hallucinations, and suicidality. . . . They are also at heightened risk of failing to respond to \nd ort 16 \nnitee N 17  medications once they are restarted.”20  As one example, Plaintiff Murphy’s January 18, 2013 \nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18  Intake Health Screening Form (completed by custody staff) and his Intake Triage Assessment form \nF\n19  (completed by medical staff of CFMG) indicated self-reported mental health problems.  Further, \n20 \nmedical records in CFMG’s possession from a prior term Murphy had spent in the jail indicated he \n21 \nsuffered from mental illness and had received psychiatric medications.  Only four days after intake \n22 \ndid Murphy have an appointment with a Licensed Psychiatric Technician who lacked authority to \n23 \nprescribe treatment or medication.  Murphy submitted several sick slips from that day on, stating:  \n24 \n                                                           \n25 \n18 See Docket No. 41 at 42. \n26   \n19 Id. at 42:6-14. \n27   \n20 Docket No. 41 at 69-70. \n28 \n \n11 \nCase No.: 5:13-cv-2354-PSG \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASS AND DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE \n\n \n“need psych meds – seeing and hearing things”; “need psych meds or psych hospital, Attn: head \n1 \npsych please”;  “I take varies physch medication . . . for hearing voices and seeing demons coming \n2 \n3  out of the walls driving me crazy, can’t sleep or eat right at all. Ive been trying to see a physch \n4  doctor, PLEASE help if possible”; “placing my life in serious danger and possible death after many \n5 \nattempts to receive my medications during and after intake.  I’m a disabled vet who served my \n6 \ncountry with honorable discharge and should not be treated like trash over a officers attitude.”  On \n7 \nJanuary 28, 2013 he informed staff that he was hearing demonic voices that were telling him to kill \n8 \nhimself.  Consequently, Defendants placed Murphy in a rubber room, from which he was not \n9 \nreleased until three days later.  Murphy was not seen by mental health care staff with authority to \n10 \n \na\nni 11  prescribe treatment until January 29, 2013.   \nt or\nrf\nouali 12    As another example, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants house inmates with mental illness in \nCC\nrict ct of  13  administrative segregation units in such a way that inmates suffer substantial risk of serious harm.21  \nisttri 14 \nDs\ni Plaintiffs describe how “Jessie Crow and Daniel Lariviere committed suicide by hanging in \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe administrative segregation in 2010 and 2011 respectively. . . . [I]f Defendants had conducted safety \nd ort 16 \neN\nnite  17  checks every half hour at intermittent and unpredictable times, they may have been able to prevent \nUh\nt\n \nor 18  Mr. Crow or Mr. Lariviere from committing suicide.”22 \nF\n19    Plaintiffs allege inmates with mental illnesses are punished and discriminated against.  For \n20 \nexample, after engaging in self-harming behavior, Plaintiff Mefford has been placed on suicide \n21 \nwatch and put in an “unsanitary” rubber room at least five separate times for varying lengths of \n22 \ntime since entering the jail.  Mefford “was able to continue engaging in self-harming behavior \n23 \ninside the rubber room, by banging his head repeatedly against the door until he was bleeding.”23  \n24 \n                                                           \n25 \n21 See id. at 88. \n26   \n22 See id. at 90. \n27   \n23 See id. at 78. \n28 \n \n12 \nCase No.: 5:13-cv-2354-PSG \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASS AND DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE \n\n \nCustody staff responded by placing Mefford in a restraint chair.  Mefford freed himself from the \n1 \nrestraint chair at least once, and began again hurting himself.  “Custody staff has routinely failed to \n2 \n3  conduct safety checks twice every thirty minutes as required by the Jail’s own policies. The Jail has \n4  also failed to provide him with adequate food and water during these periods of time.  Plaintiff \n5 \nMEFFORD has informed the Jail medical and custody staff repeatedly that sensory deprivation and \n6 \nparticularly a lack of light make his anxiety and other psychiatric conditions much worse.  He has \n7 \nalso stated a reluctance to express his true level of suicidality to staff because of fear of being \n8 \nplaced in a rubber room.  Despite this, custody staff continues to place him in rubber rooms.”24  \n9 \nThese experiences show inadequate training, identification, tracking, treatment, suicide-watch, \n10 \n \na\nni 11  facilities, housing, prescription, monitoring, evaluation, records, as well as apparent discrimination \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  and punishment of inmates with mental illnesses.25 \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  Regarding Defendants’ alleged disabilities accommodation policies and practices, Plaintiffs \nisttri 14 \nDs\ni claim Defendants’ failures to accurately identify new inmates’ disabilities and needed \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe accommodations during the intake process result in the denial of accommodations mandated by the \nd ort 16 \neN\nnite  17  ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and California disability rights law, placing inmates at risk of \nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18  discrimination, injury, and exploitation.  For example, during booking into the jail in August 2012 \nF\n19  and again in December 2012, custody staff completed Monterey County Sheriff’s Office Intake \n20 \nHealth Screening forms for Plaintiff Yancey.  Despite Yancey’s complete hearing impairment, staff \n21 \ndid not indicate on the forms that he had a hearing disability.  Accordingly, staff throughout the jail \n22 \nwere unable to identify Yancey as hearing impaired, and he received no accommodations for his \n23 \ndisability.26  Yancey was not provided with a sign language interpreter for his communications \n24 \n                                                           \n25 \n24 See id.  \n26   \n25 See id. at 67-88. \n27   \n26 See Docket No. 41 at 99.  \n28 \n \n13 \nCase No.: 5:13-cv-2354-PSG \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASS AND DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE \n\n \nwith jail staff, including at medical appointments, at a disciplinary hearing, during the booking and \n1 \nclassification process27 or for church services.28   Yancey submitted a grievance, requesting \n2 \n3  accommodations relating to his hearing impairment, but he received no response.29 \n4  Another inmate who was booked into the jail in January 2012 with a mobility impairment \n5 \nrequired a cane to help him safely ambulate and access his housing unit and required safe access to \n6 \na bed.  During the intake process, the jail failed to identify him as having a mobility impairment \n7 \nrequiring those accommodations; he was not provided with a cane and he was placed in the only \n8 \navailable bed in his housing unit on the upper bunk of a triple bunk.  Without a cane, the inmate \n9 \nfell and injured himself on a number of occasions.  He slept on the floor because it was too difficult \n10 \n \na\nni 11  to access his bunk.30   \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  The sum total of all this is that Plaintiffs allege a variety of jail policies and practices \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  applying to all inmates and staff dealing with safety, health care and disabilities, and that these \nisttri 14 \nDs\ni policies and practices expose all members of the proposed class and subclass to a substantial risk of \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe harm.  \nd ort 16 \neN\nnite  17  B. \nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18    Plaintiffs also support their motion for class certification with documents obtained by \nF\n19  investigation and various requests pursuant to California’s Public Records Act.

He concluded that \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  Defendants operate the jail in a dangerous manner, placing all inmates at serious risk of harm. \nCC\nrict ct of  13    The parties jointly retained Dr. Michael Puisis, D.O. as a neutral expert to evaluate \nisttri 14 \nDis “whether Defendants’ system for providing medical care at the jail is adequate.”44  Puisis wrote \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe that the jail’s medical staffing is 40-70% less than it should be at all levels, leading to inadequate \nd ort 16 \neN\nnite  17  intake, evaluation, care, management and surveillance.  Puisis also found the spaces of care \nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18  delivery were unhygienic, inadequate and small, discouraging proper examinations.

Plaintiffs did not submit these declarations in support of individual constitutional \nisttri 14 \nDs\ni and statutory claims, which they do not bring, but instead offer these declarations as evidence of \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe the defendants’ unlawful policies and practices, and as examples of the serious harm to which all \nd ort 16 \neN\nnite  17  inmates in jail custody are allegedly exposed.  For example, Plaintiff Dilley, who suffers from \nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18  multiple sclerosis, describes how she cannot walk up the stairs to access the exercise yard without \nF\n19  experiencing excruciating pain.61  Since she was booked into the jail in June 2013, she has only \n20 \nbeen outside to go to court or medical appointments at outside facilities—she has not been outside \n21 \nat all since mid-December 2013.62  Plaintiff Miller has vision loss, and Defendants fail to ensure \n22 \nthat vision-impaired inmates are adequately informed of, among other things, administered \n23 \n                                                           \n24  59 See Docket No. 52 at ¶¶ 6-7, 69, 72, 76. \n \n25 \n60 See Docket No. 355 at 11. \n26   \n61 Docket No. 52-7 at ¶ 4. \n27   \n62 Id. ¶ 12-13. \n28 \n \n19 \nCase No.: 5:13-cv-2354-PSG \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASS AND DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE \n\n \nmedications.

Plaintiffs rely on system-wide deficiencies in the provision of medical and mental \nisttri 14  health care that, taken as a whole, subject sick and mentally ill [inmates] in California to \nDs\ni “substantial risk of serious harm” and cause the delivery of care in the prisons to fall below \n D\ns\nten  15  the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.150 \nar\nSthe  \nd ort 16 \neN\nt\nnie  17                                                             \nUh 146 Id. at 33, 34, 113 S.

The constitutional and \n2 \n3  statutory claims in this case are of the same basic kind as the claims in Helling, Farmer, Plata, \n4  Graves, Wallis, and Parsons.  In those cases, courts have asked only whether the plaintiffs were \n5 \nexposed to a substantial risk of harm to which prison officials were deliberately indifferent—and \n6 \nhave recognized that many inmates can simultaneously be endangered by a single policy.152 \n7 \nHere, all members of the putative class and subclass have in common their alleged exposure \n8 \nto a substantial risk of serious future harm to which Defendants are allegedly deliberately \n9 \nindifferent, as a result of policies and practices that govern the overall conditions of health care \n10 \n \na\nni 11  services and confinement.153  While results of exposure may vary, ranging from no harm to death, \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  each inmate suffers the same constitutional or statutory injury when exposed to a policy or practice \nCC\nrict ct of  13  that creates a substantial risk of serious harm.154  For example, inadequate health care in a prison \nisttri 14 \nDs\ni system endangers every inmate:  “[e]ven [inmates] with no present physical or mental illness may \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe become afflicted, and all [inmates] in California are at risk so long as the State continues to provide \nd ort 16 \neN\nnite  17  inadequate care. . . .

With regard to claims, the \n2 \n3  honesty and credibility of a class representative is a relevant consideration into adequacy, because \n4  an untrustworthy plaintiff could reduce the likelihood of prevailing on the class action188 and may \n5 \nbe considered to have interests antagonistic to the class.189  But a plaintiff is inadequate only “when \n6 \nattacks on the [plaintiff’s] credibility . . . are so sharp as to jeopardize the interests of absent class \n7 \nmembers” and “where the representative’s credibility is questioned on issues directly relevant to \n8 \nthe litigation.”190   \n9 \nThe County argues that the named Plaintiffs are inadequate because, among other things, \n10 \n \na\nni 11  they request conflicting relief.  For example, some Plaintiffs wish to see mentally ill inmates \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  segregated from the rest of the inmates, and others admonish Defendants for failure to “ensure that \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  inmates or detainees with disabilities are housed in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \nisttri 14 \nDis needs of the individuals.”191  Citing certain deposition testimony and counsel’s role in preparing \n D\ns\nten  15 \nar\nSthe defendants, CFMG contends the named Plaintiffs are not adequate representatives because they are \nd ort 16 \neN\nnite  17  not credible and because they can establish neither the requisite case or controversy nor personal \nUh\nt\n \nor 18  injury from being subjected to the alleged risks.192  As to this latter point, CFMG disputes that any \nF\n19  named Plaintiffs were exposed to the inadequate conditions they challenge relating to  in screening, \n                                                           \n20  187 Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020. \n \n21 \n188 See Harris v.

Rather than \n6 \npersonal relief, Plaintiffs ask for relief from Defendants’ problematic system-wide policies and \n7 \npractices.  For example, while opinions may differ about housing inmates with mental illness in \n8 \ngeneral population or in special housing units, all plaintiffs agree inmates with mental illnesses \n9 \nshould not be housed in administrative segregation, and this is part of the relief they request.195  \n10 \n \na\nni 11  And “[i]nconsistent deposition testimony in and of itself will not serve as a ground for denial of \nt or\nrf\nouali 12  class certification.”196  While lack of credibility is an issue for Plaintiffs to consider in constructing \nCC\nct of  13 \nrict  their case, the court does not consider the named Plaintiffs inadequate.

INTRODUCTION\n26 Plaintiffs’ Second Am ended Complaint contains eight separate causes of action\n27 concerning the care and treatm ent of various  inmates in the Monterey County Jail. \n28 Essentially, plaintiffs’ allege defendants were and are deliberately indifferent to plaintiffs’\n1 5:13cv2354 PSG\nDEFENDANT CALIFORNIA FORENSIC MEDICAL GROUP, INC.’S MEMORANDUM OF\nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS’\nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL\nPROCEDURE RULE 12(b)(6)\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document59   Filed05/02/14   Page2 of 7\n1 mental and physical healthcare, physical secu rity and safety.  In addition, the Second\n2 Amended Complaint asserts CFMG, the entityw  hich has “contract[ed] with the [Monterey\n3 County] Sheriff’s Office that . . . provides all health care services to prisoners in the Jail,\n4 including medical and mental health care” has violated Title III of the Am ericans with\n5 Disabilities Act in the context of their Six th Cause of Action.  See Plaintiffs’ Second\n6 Amended Complaint at ¶34.\n7 Defendant CFMG now moves in joinder with defendants County of Monterey and\n8 Monterey County Sheriff’s Office to dism iss plaintiffs Robert Yancy, Richard Murphy,\n9 Dennis Guyot, Glenda Hunter, Martha Gom ez, Wesley Miller, Jeffrey Nichols, Sarab\n10 Sarabi and Albert Keys’ claims in their entireyt because said plaintiffs either lack standing\n11 to bring this injunctive and declaratory action,o r in the alternative their claims are mooted\n12 by virtue of their release from the Monterey County Jail.  Defendant CFMG now further\n13 moves  to dismiss plaintiffs’ Sixth Cause of Action against it on the basis that plaintiffs\n14 have failed to state a claim pursuant to Rule1 2(b)(6) insofar as CFMG does not own, lease\n15 or operate a place of “public accommodation” pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §12181(7)(F).\n16 II.  ENABLING AUTHORITY\n17 Federal Rule of Civil Proceduer Rule 12 permits a party to assert defenses by motion,\n18 including the defense of plaintiff’s failure tos tate a claim upon which relief can be granted. \n19 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6 ).  Rule 12(b)(6) affords a defendant an\n20 opportunity to test whether, as m atter of law, plaintiff is entitled to legal relief even if\n21 everything alleged in complaint is true. Mueller v. Gallina, (2004) 311 F.Supp. 2d 606.  A\n22 Complaint cannot survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss merely by setting forth all of\n23 elements of causes of action pled, since Rule1 2(b)(6) was also designed to screen out cases\n24 where a complaint stated a claim based on a wrong for which there was clearly no remedy\n25 and for which no relief could possibly be granted. Port Auth. v. Arcadian Corp., (1999,\n26 CA3 N.J.) 189 F.3d 305.  Dismissal of a Complaint is appropriate when the Complainant\n27 fails to allege a cognizablel egal theory or sufficient facts to support such theoryB.  alistreri\n28 v. Pacifica Police Dept., (9th Cir. 1988) 901 F.2d 696, 699.  \n2 5:13cv2354 PSG\nDEFENDANT CALIFORNIA FORENSIC MEDICAL GROUP, INC.’S MEMORANDUM OF\nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS’\nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL\nPROCEDURE RULE 12(b)(6)\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document59   Filed05/02/14   Page3 of 7\n1 Additionally, Courts are not “bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as\n2 a factual allegation.”   Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Two mbly, (2007) 550 U.S. 544, 550.  Rule\n3 12(b)(6)  allows a defendant to test whether,a s matter of law, a plaintiff is entitled to legal\n4 relief even if everything alleged in complaint is true.D  oe v. Detroit Bd. of Educ(. 2004) 310\n5 F.Supp.2d 871.  A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is properly granted where,\n6 as here, it is clear that no relief c ould be granted under any set of facts .  M cCray v.\n7 Veneman (2002) 298 F.Supp.2d 13.  Further, and specific to plaintiffs’ claims herein, Rule\n8 12(b)(6) motions are appropriate to examine the legality of a plaintiff’s claims under Title\n9 III of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  See, e.g. Norkunas v. Park Rd. Shopping Ctr.,\n10 Inc. (2011) 777 F.Supp.2d 998.\n11 Plaintiffs’ Second Am ended Complaint fails to state a cognizab le claim against\n12 CFMG pursuant to Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Additionally, since\n13 certain plaintiffs lack standing to sue, and/or their claims are moot, granting defendant’s\n14 Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss is proper.\n15 III.  ARGUMENT\n16 A. CFMG Joins and Incorporates Defendants County of Monterey and\n17 Monterey County Sheriff’s Office’s Motoin to Dismiss Certain Plaintiffs’\n18 Claims on the Bases of Lack of Standing and/or Mootness.\n19 Defendant CFMG moves firstly in joinder to defendants County of Monterey and\n20 Monterey County Sheriff’s Office’s Motion to Dismiss filed on April 25, 2014 and set for\n21 hearing on June 3, 2014.  Defendnat CFMG specifically moves herein that plaintiffs Robert\n22 Yancy, Richard Murphy, Dennis Guyot, Glenda Hunter, Martha Gomez, Wesley Miller,\n23 Jeffrey Nichols, Sarab Sarabi and Albert Key, by virtue of their release from the Monterey\n24 County Jail, lack standing to assert causes of  action for injunctive and declaratory relief\n25 related to conditions in the Monterey County Jai lo, r in the alternative, their claims are now\n26 moot.\n27 Defendant CFMG specifically incorporates herein by reference defendants County\n28 of Monterey and Monterey County Sher iff’s Office’s m emorandum of points and\n3 5:13cv2354 PSG\nDEFENDANT CALIFORNIA FORENSIC MEDICAL GROUP, INC.’S MEMORANDUM OF\nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS’\nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL\nPROCEDURE RULE 12(b)(6)\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document59   Filed05/02/14   Page4 of 7\n1 authorities in support of their Motion to Dism iss in addition to all requests for judicial\n2 notice, declarations and exhibits thereto filed in support of the motion.\n3 Defendant CFMG requests the entirety of  the claims of plaintiffs Robert Yancy,\n4 Richard Murphy, Dennis Guyot, Glenda Hunter, Martha Gomez, Wesley Miller, Jeffrey\n5 Nichols, Sarab Sarabi and Albert Key be dismissed.\n6 B. Plaintiffs’ Sixth Cause of Action for ADA Violations Pursuant to Title III\n7 Should Be Dismissed Because Title III Does Not Apply to CFMG at the\n8 Monterey County Jail.\n9 Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act provides in part that “no individual\n10 shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of\n11 the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of\n12 public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place\n13 of public accommodation.” ADA § 302(a), 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). Essentially, Title III of\n14 the ADA requires a plaintiff plead and prove  the following elements: 1) a plaintiff was\n15 disabled within the meaning of the Act; 2) the plaintiff was discriminated against on the\n16 basis of that disability; and 3)t he defendant owns, leases or leases to or operates a place of\n17 public accommodation.  For the purposes of this motion alone, CFMG assumes plaintiffs\n18 have sufficiently plead the first and second eelments in their Second Amended Complaint. \n19 CFMG moves to dismiss plaintiffs’ Sixth Cause of Action on the bassi that it does not own,\n20 lease or operate a “place of public accom modation.”  As a m atter of law, Title II I is\n21 therefore inapplicable to CFMG, and defe ndant’s motion to dism iss pursuant to Rule\n22 12(b)(6) should be granted.\n23 Title III’s general anti-discrimination provision refers tod  iscrimination on the basis\n24 of disability by the owner, lessor, l essee or operator of any “place of public\n25 accommodation.” 4 2 U.S.C. §12182(a). A pl ace of public accom modation has been\n26 intentionally defined by 42 U.S.C. §12181(7) at subparts (7)(A) through (7)(L).  Specific\n27 to this action, section 12181(7)(F) provides: “t[]he following private entities are considered\n28 public accommodations for purposes of this subchapter, if the operations of such entities\n4 5:13cv2354 PSG\nDEFENDANT CALIFORNIA FORENSIC MEDICAL GROUP, INC.’S MEMORANDUM OF\nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS’\nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL\nPROCEDURE RULE 12(b)(6)\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document59   Filed05/02/14   Page5 of 7\n1 affect commerce—. . . (F). . .a professional o ffice of a health care provider, hospital, or\n2 other service establishment.”\n3 In the context of this Second Amended Complaint at the Sixth Cause of Action\n4 against CFMG, plaintiffs assert, without ba sis, that CFMG itself is a “place of public\n5 accommodation” in that it “owns, leases, leases to, or operates a professional office of a\n6 health care provider, hospital, or other servcie establishment.”  Plaintiffs’ Second Amended\n7 Complaint at ¶398.  This language is lifted precisely from 42 U.S.C §12181(7)(F) and it is\n8 on this basis alone that plaintiffs claim CFMG is subject to suit under Title III of the ADA.\n9 CFMG is not an owner, lessor/lessee or operator of a place of public accommodation. \n10 As a matter of law, Title III is therefore inapplicable to CFMG and plaintiffs’ Sixth Cause\n11 of Action should be dismissed.\n12 The purpose of Title III of the ADA was toa pply to equal access for the disabled to\n13 physical services of a defined place of public accom modation.  See Pappas v. Bethesda\n14 Hosp. Ass'n, (1994) 861 F.Supp.616, 620.  The only physical place described in plaintiffs’\n15 Second Amended Complaint is the Monterey County Jail.   A jail is undisputedly  not a\n16 place of public accommodation.  It not neither enumerated within the statutory definition\n17 of 42 U.S.C. §12181, and is not a place  “open to the public.”  See e.g.  Disabled Rights\n18 Action Comm. v. Las Vegas Events, Inc. , (2003) 375 F.3d 861, 873;  Debord v Board of\n19 Educ. (1997) 126 F.3d 1102, cert. denied (1998) 523 U.S. 1073. Title III does not apply to\n20 jails, or to any part thereof.  See, e.g.  Baaske v. City of Rolling Meadows  (2002) 191\n21 F.Supp.2d 1009 (Title III of ADA does not apply to public entities.)\n22 By way of converse illustration, interpreting case law as well as the plain language\n23 of the statute have clearly defined a physician’s office, a dentist’s office, a medical clinic\n24 and a hospital, in addition to hotels, inns, bars, arenas, etc. as p laces of public\n25 accommodation to satisfy Title III of the ADA.  See, e.g.  Mayberry v. Von Valtier (1994)\n26 843 F.Supp.1160 [physician’s office] ;   D.B. v Bloom  (1995) 896 F. Supp.166 [dentist\n27 office]; Sharrow v Bailey (1995) 910 F.Supp.187 [medical clinic]. CFMG, as defined by\n28 plaintiffs in their Second Am ended Com plaint, is none of these types of “public\n5 5:13cv2354 PSG\nDEFENDANT CALIFORNIA FORENSIC MEDICAL GROUP, INC.’S MEMORANDUM OF\nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS’\nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL\nPROCEDURE RULE 12(b)(6)\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document59   Filed05/02/14   Page6 of 7\n1 accommodations.”  Public accom modations are precisely that: open and usable by the\n2 public.  The Monterey County Jail could be no further from this legal definition.\n3 Further, in addition to CFMG and/or  Monterey County Jail not  being a place of\n4 public accommodation in accord with Title III, it is undisputed that CFMG is neither an\n5 owner, lessor/lessee or operator of the alleged “place of public accommodation,” i.e. the\n6 jail, or any part thereof.  CFMG therefore negates an additional second prong of Title III’s\n7 public accommodation regulation.  Since CFMG  is neither the owner, lessor/lessee or\n8 operator of the Monterey County Jail, even i fthe jail could somehow be deemed a place of\n9 public accommodation, as a matter of law, CFMG is not the responsible entity for the jail\n10 under Title III.\n11 In their Second Amended Complaint, plaintiffs claim CFMG is the “entity [which]\n12 has “contract[ed] with the [Monterey County] Sheriff’s Office that . . . provides all health\n13 care services to prisoners in the Jail, includingm  edical and mental health care.”  Plaintiffs’\n14 Second Amended Complaint at ¶34.  While CFMG is alleged to be the sole provider of\n15 such medical services to plaintiffs, there are no fa cts alleged in the Second A mended\n16 Complaint that CFMG “owns” the Monterey County Jail or anyp art thereof.  There are no\n17 facts alleged in the Second Amended Complaint which describe CFMG as a lessor or lessee\n18 of the Monterey County Jail, and indeed no  description or provision of a valid lease\n19 subjecting CFMG to liability under Title III has  been provided by plaintiffs.  Sim ilarly,\n20 there are no facts alleged within the SecondA  mended Complaint to support CFMG as the\n21 “operator” of the Monterey County Jail.  Indeed, by plaintiffs’ own allegations, CFMG is\n22 an independent contractor w ith the County of Monterey.  Plaintiffs’ Second Am ended\n23 Complaint at ¶34.  The Northern District  Court ha s previously held an independent\n24 contractor could not be liable under the ADA without some nexus establishing he was an\n25 “operator.”   Aikins v. St. Helena Hosp. (1994) 843 F.Supp 1329. Rather than set forth such\n26 a nexus, plaintiffs have prima facie refuted it, stating that the Monterey County Sheriff’s\n27 office is responsible for the day-to-day  operations of the Jail facilities, including\n28 promulgating policies and procedures for the operation of the facilities and that “by law it\n6 5:13cv2354 PSG\nDEFENDANT CALIFORNIA FORENSIC MEDICAL GROUP, INC.’S MEMORANDUM OF\nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS’\nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL\nPROCEDURE RULE 12(b)(6)\n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document59   Filed05/02/14   Page7 of 7\n1 retains the ultimate authority over and any responsibility for the health care, treatment, and\n2 safekeeping of prisoners in the Jail.”  Plaitniffs’ Second Amended Complaint at ¶33.  Since\n3 there is no rational basis to conclude CFMG is the operator of Monterey County Jail, and\n4 since plaintiffs own claim s circum vent su ch a finding, plaintiffs’ Title III claim  is\n5 inapplicable to defendant and defendant’s motion to dismiss should be granted.\n6 In sum, for plaintiffs’ Title III claim to survive defendant’s instant motion, this Court\n7 must find both  that the Monterey County Jail is indeed a place of public accommodation,\n8 and CFMG is the owner, lessor/lessee or opertaor of that public place specifically under 42\n9 U.S.C.§12181(7)(F).  Neither of these propositions are supportable, and neither have been\n10 properly alleged in plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint.  Undisputedly, plaintiffs seek\n11 a remedy for alleged violations of the ADA.   However, that remedy does not li e with\n12 TitleIII, and does not lie with California Forensic Medical Group. Defendants’ Motion to\n13 Dismiss based on plaintiffs’ failure to state a claim in their Sixth Cause of Action should\n14 be granted.\n15 IV.  CONCLUSION.\n16 For the foregoing reasons, defendant Caliofrnia Forensic Medical Group respectfully\n17 requests plaintiffs Robert Yancy, Richard Murphy, Dennis Guyot, Glenda Hunter, Martha\n18 Gomez, Wesley Miller, Jeffrey Nichols, Sarab Sarabi and Albert Key be dismissed from\n19 this action in their entirety , and further respectfully requests plaintiffs’ Sixth Cause of\n20 Action against CFMG for violations of Title III of the ADA be dismissed.\n21 Respectfully submitted,\n22 DATED:  May 2, 2014.

Case  No.  CV 13-2354 PSG \nCounty Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to FRCP Rule 12(b)(6) \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document44   Filed04/25/14   Page5 of 12\n \n1   TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD: \n2   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on June 3, 2014 at 10:00 a.m., or as soon thereafter as this \n3 matter may be heard, in Courtroom 5, 4th Floor of the above-entitled Court, Defendants, \n4 COUNTY OF MONTEREY and MONTEREY COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE1, will and \n5 hereby do move this Court, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for \n6 an order dismissing all claims of Plaintiffs, Robert Yancey, Richard Murphy, Dennis Guyot, \n7 Glenda Hunter, Martha Gomez, Wesley Miller, Jeffrey Nichols, Sarab Sarabi, and Albert Key.  \n8 These named Plaintiffs are no longer incarcerated in the Monterey County jail.  As such, they \n9 lack the standing to assert causes of action for injunctive and declaratory relief related to \n10 conditions at the jail; or, in the alternative, their claims are now moot. \n11   This motion is based upon this Notice; the Memorandum of Points and Authorities \n12 attached hereto; the concurrently filed Declaration of Cmdr. James H. Bass; the concurrently \n13 filed Request for Judicial Notice; the papers and records filed herein; and such other evidence \n14 and argument the Court may entertain at the hearing of this matter. \n15  \n16 MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES \n17 I.  INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF FACTS \n18   Although Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint is a lengthy homily of allegations \n19 concerning the Monterey County jail, the claims can be distilled into four main assertions: 1) \n20 Defendants are deliberately indifferent in the provision of certain Plaintiffs’ medical care; 2) \n21 Defendants are deliberately indifferent in the provision of certain Plaintiffs’ mental health care; \n22 3) Defendants are deliberately indifferent in the provision of certain Plaintiffs’ security and \n23 safety needs; and 4) Defendants are deliberately indifferent in caring for certain Plaintiffs who \n24 allegedly need accommodations pursuant to the ADA. \n25   Plaintiffs’ initial complaint was filed on May 23, 2013.  Plaintiffs did not file their \n26 Second Amended Complaint until April 11, 2014.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has indicated they will be \n                                                           \n27\n1 Monterey County Office of the Sheriff is not a separate legal entity from the County of Monterey. \n28\n1 \nHernandez, et al. v. County of Monterey, et al. Case  No.  CV 13-2354 PSG \nCounty Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to FRCP Rule 12(b)(6) \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document44   Filed04/25/14   Page6 of 12\n \n1 filing a motion for class certification shortly.  However, at the filing of this motion to dismiss, \n2 they have not yet filed a motion for class certification.  Defendants anticipate that they will \n3 oppose such a motion on a number of grounds, including the fact that the individual Plaintiffs are \n4 unquestionably unique in the various claims they are making.  For instance, the care and \n5 treatment of an inmate with a colostomy bag or a rare foot tumor is in no way representative of \n6 the normal population of the Monterey County jail. \n7   Defendants also specifically raise and preserve the affirmative defense that all Plaintiffs’ \n8 have failed to exhaust administrative procedures under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. \n9 To the extent Defendants are required to raise the defense of failure to exhaust administrative \n10 procedures at their initial responsive pleadings, they do so now for each and every Plaintiff. (See \n11 Albino v. Baca, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 6153 (9th Cir. Cal. Apr. 3, 2014).  Defendants also \n12 reserve their right to assert the defense of statute of limitations. \n13   Plaintiffs, Robert Yancey, Richard Murphy, Dennis Guyot, Glenda Hunter, Martha \n14 Gomez, Wesley Miller, Jeffrey Nichols, Sarab Sarabi, and Albert Key are not incarcerated in the \n15 Monterey County jail.  (Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice).  Plaintiffs’ Second Amended \n16 Complaint does not plead that these Plaintiffs are currently incarcerated.  As such, Plaintiffs fail \n17 to have the standing required to assert claims for declaratory and injunctive relief; or, assuming \n18 that Plaintiffs originally had standing, their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are now \n19 moot.2 \n20 II.  LEGAL ARGUMENT \n21 A.  RULE 12(b)(6) \n22   To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \n23 accepted as true, to state a claim that is plausible on its face. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n24 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. \n25 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)) (quotation marks omitted).    “Conclusory \n26 allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a \n                                                           \n27\n2 Robert Yancey was released before the filing of the original complaint. \n28\n2 \nHernandez, et al. v. County of Monterey, et al. Case  No.  CV 13-2354 PSG \nCounty Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to FRCP Rule 12(b)(6) \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document44   Filed04/25/14   Page7 of 12\n \n1 motion to dismiss.”  2-12 Moore’s Federal Practice – Civil § 12.34 (citing in part Anderson v. \n2 Clow, 89 F.3d 1399, 1403 (9th Cir. 1996) (conclusory allegations of law and unwarranted \n3 inferences are insufficient to defeat motion to dismiss for failure to state claim)); Epstein v. \n4 Washington Energy Co. (9th Cir. 1996) 83 F.3d 1136, 1140.  “While facts must be accepted as \n5 alleged, this does not automatically extend to bald assertions, subjective characterizations, or \n6 legal conclusions.”  2-12 Moore’s Federal Practice – Civil § 12.34  (citations omitted.) .  See, \n7 Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (Courts “are not bound to accept as true a legal \n8 conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”). \n9   The purpose of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6) is to permit trial courts to \n10 terminate lawsuits that are fatally flawed in their legal premises and destined to fail, and thus to \n11 spare litigants the burdens of unnecessary pretrial and trial activity.  Neitzke v. Williams, 490 \n12 U.S. 319, 326-27 (1989).  A claim may be dismissed either because it asserts a legal theory that \n13 is not cognizable as a matter of law or because it fails to allege sufficient facts to support a \n14 cognizable legal claim.  SmileCare Dental Group v. Delta Dental Plan of Cal., Inc., 88 F.3d 780, \n15 783 (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1028 (1996) (citations omitted).   \n16 B.  PLAINTIFFS LACK STANDING OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE THEIR \nCLAIMS ARE MOOT \n17  \n \n18   In general, Plaintiffs who are no longer incarcerated cannot seek injunctive relief for the \n19 conditions of their incarceration, but, instead, may proceed with a claim for damages.  See \n20 Wiggins v. Rushen, 760 F.2d 1009 (9th Cir.1985).  To demonstrate standing, when a claimant \n21 seeks equitable relief, Article III of the U.S. Constitution requires: 1) the plaintiff has suffered \n22 some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant; 2) \n23 the injury can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant; and 3) the injury is “likely to \n24 be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for \n25 Separation of Church and State, 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982). \n26   The general rule for 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims for deprivation of rights in a detention \n27 setting is that the plaintiff must be incarcerated at the time of filing and throughout the pendency \n28 of the matter.  See generally, Ferreira v. Dubois, 963 F. Supp. 1244 (D. Mass. 1996).  The \n3 \nHernandez, et al. v. County of Monterey, et al. Case  No.  CV 13-2354 PSG \nCounty Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to FRCP Rule 12(b)(6) \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document44   Filed04/25/14   Page8 of 12\n \n1 reasoning for this flows from the principle established in L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983) \n2 which holds that threat of future harm that is so attenuated is insufficient to maintain standing to \n3 maintain a law suit and renders the matter moot. L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983) (neither the \n4 existence of past injury nor conjecture over the prospect of some future injury creates the case or \n5 controversy required for jurisdiction).  It has to be assumed that the released inmate “will \n6 conduct [his or her] activities within the law and so avoid prosecution and conviction” and \n7 subsequent incarceration.  L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 103, citing O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. \n8 488, 495-97 (1974).  It is also highly unlikely and, in fact, conjectural that, once reincarcerated, a \n9 plaintiff will be subjected to the same deprivations faced in his individualized claim. \n10   “The cases articulating the case or controversy requirement conceive of mootness as ‘the \n11 doctrine of standing set in a time frame: The requisite personal interest that must exist at the \n12 commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue through its existence (mootness).’” \n13 Ferreira v. Dubois, 963 F. Supp. 1244, 1261-1262 (D. Mass. 1996), quoting Rosetti v. Shalala, \n14 12 F.3d 1216, at 1224 n. 19 (3d Cir. 1993); and citing United States Parole Commission v. \n15 Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397, 100 S.Ct. 1202, 63 L. Ed. 2d 479 (1980) (dicta noting same). \n16   Mootness examines whether a party has lost standing due to a change in facts over the \n17 course of the suit. Clarke v. Lane, 267 F.R.D. 180, 189 (E.D. Pa. 2010) (citations omitted).  \"In \n18 general, a case is moot if there is no longer any 'present controversy as to which effective relief \n19 can be granted.'\" Johnson v. Rancho Santiago Cmty. College Dist., 623 F.3d 1011, 1018 (9th Cir. \n20 2010).  Even if a plaintiff has standing with respect  to a claim for relief at the time the complaint \n21 is filed, mootness considerations \"require courts to look to changing circumstances that arise \n22 after the complaint is filed,\" and \"[i]f a live controversy no longer exists, the claim is moot.\"  \n23 ACLU v. Lomax, 471 F.3d 1010, 1016 (9th Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted). \"The case-or-\n24 controversy requirement demands that, through all stages of federal judicial proceedings, the \n25 parties continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.\" Carty v. Nelson, 426 \n26 F.3d 1064, 1071 (9th Cir. 2005). \n27   \"An action becomes moot when '(1) there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged \n28 events will recur . . . and (2) interim relief or events have completely eradicated the effects of the \n4 \nHernandez, et al. v. County of Monterey, et al. Case  No.  CV 13-2354 PSG \nCounty Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to FRCP Rule 12(b)(6) \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document44   Filed04/25/14   Page9 of 12\n \n1 violation.'\"). Further, federal courts' jurisdiction is limited for mootness \"when the issues \n2 presented are no longer 'live' or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome\" (the \n3 personal stake requirement). Clarke v. Lane, 267 F.R.D. 180, 189 (E.D. Pa. 2010), quoting \n4 Bowers v. City of Philadelphia, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64651 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 8, 2006) (citing \n5 United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 396, 100 S. Ct. 1202, 63 L. Ed. 2d 479 \n6 (1980) (internal citation omitted)).  Both standing and mootness must be satisfied in order to \n7 satisfy the “case and controversy” requirement under Article III.  See, Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. \n8 393, 402 (1975).  “The Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to review of ‘actual cases or \n9 controversies’ in which the plaintiff has a ‘personal stake’ in the litigation.”  See U.S. Const. Art. \n10 III, § 2; United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 396-97 (U.S. 1980). \n11   As to former, current, or future prisoners, to have a continuing case or controversy that is \n12 live at all stages of the proceedings a former prisoner must be subject to the alleged violations he \n13 intends to challenge; otherwise a prisoner lacks standing to seek injunctive relief.  Preiser v. \n14 Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401 (1975) (a federal court has neither the power to render advisory \n15 opinions nor to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them); \n16 Weaver v. Wilcox, 650 F.2d 22, 27 (3d Cir. 1981).  Here, Plaintiffs Robert Yancey, Richard \n17 Murphy, Dennis Guyot, Glenda Hunter, Martha Gomez, Wesley Miller, Jeffrey Nichols, Sarab \n18 Sarabi, and Albert Key have been released from the County of Monterey jail.  As such, they do \n19 not have standing to seek injunctive relief as they are no longer subject to the alleged conditions \n20 they are attempting to challenge.  Weaver, 650 F.2d at 27.  Their claims are moot. \n21   Plaintiffs also cannot satisfy the last element of standing as to redressability.  “[T]he \n22 redressability factor focuses on the connection between the plaintiff’s injury and the judicial \n23 relief sought.”  Clarke v. Lane, 267 F.R.D. 180 (E.D. Pa. 2010) (citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. \n24 v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167 (2000) (petitioners' citizen suit for civil \n25 penalties under Clean Water Act was moot when respondent came into compliance).  Plaintiffs \n26 cannot demonstrate that equitable relief will redress their injuries to establish standing as they are \n27 no longer incarcerated at the Monterey County jail and subject to the conditions they wish to \n28 abate.  See Citizens for Health v. Leavitt, 428 F.3d 167, 176 n. 9 (3d Cir. 2005) (“An injury is \n5 \nHernandez, et al. v. County of Monterey, et al. Case  No.  CV 13-2354 PSG \nCounty Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to FRCP Rule 12(b)(6) \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document44   Filed04/25/14   Page10 of 12\n \n1 redressable for justiciability purposes where the plaintiff can show that it is likely, as opposed to \n2 merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”).  It has to be \n3 assumed that the released inmate “will conduct [his] activities within the law and so avoid \n4 prosecution and conviction” and subsequent incarceration. L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 103, citing \n5 O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-97 (1974).   \n6   It should be noted that even if Plaintiffs’ claims are dismissed for lack of standing or \n7 based on mootness, they may still pursue a claim for damages.  Weaver v. Wilcox, 650 F.2d 22, \n8 27 (3d Cir. Pa. 1981); see also Holland v. Purdy, 457 F.2d 802, 803 (5th Cir. 1972) (per curiam) \n9 (plaintiff's case considered to be \"moot\" because he was no longer subject to the complained of \n10 condition at the time he instituted his litigation). Plaintiffs, Robert Yancey, Richard Murphy, \n11 Dennis Guyot, Glenda Hunter, Martha Gomez, Wesley Miller, Jeffrey Nichols, Sarab Sarabi, and \n12 Albert Key are not currently incarcerated at the Monterey County jail.  Accordingly, there is no \n13 evidence that Plaintiffs will be incarcerated at the time Plaintiffs file a motion for class \n14 certification.  Plaintiffs’ claims are moot and they lack standing to proceed.   \n15   Admittedly, there are some exceptions to the mootness doctrine.  However, none of them \n16 are applicable to the instant Plaintiffs.  Defendants anticipate Plaintiffs will argue that Plaintiffs’ \n17 claims are “capable of repetition, yet evading review”; that Plaintiffs meet the Sosna exception; \n18 or that Plaintiffs meet the transitory claim exception.  See generally, Clarke v. Lane, 267 F.R.D. \n19 180, 191 (E.D. Pa. 2010). \n20  In  Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393 (1975), the named plaintiff’s, who had been designated \n21 lead plaintiff, claim became moot while the case was on appeal.  The Sosna court held that it \n22 retained jurisdiction because the controversy the suit involved remained very much alive for the \n23 class of persons [the named plaintiff] had been certified to represent, even though the named \n24 plaintiff’s claims had expired.  Sosna, 419 U.S. at 401.  Accordingly, “the mooting of a named \n25 plaintiff’s claim does not eliminate federal jurisdiction over a class action provided a class has \n26 already been certified.”  Rosetti v. Shalala, 12 F.3d 1216, 1225 (3d Cir. 1993) (when claims of \n27 the named plaintiffs become moot before class certification, dismissal of the action is required).  \n28 In this case, unlike in Sosna, a class has not been certified and therefore, Sosna is inapplicable. \n6 \nHernandez, et al. v. County of Monterey, et al. Case  No.  CV 13-2354 PSG \nCounty Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to FRCP Rule 12(b)(6) \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document44   Filed04/25/14   Page11 of 12\n \n1   Defendants anticipate that Plaintiffs will argue that due to the “inherently transitory” \n2 nature of Plaintiffs as inmates, the alleged constitutional violations are “capable of repetition, yet \n3 evading review.”  To qualify for the “capable of repetition, yet evading review”, Plaintiffs must \n4 demonstrate two elements: “(1) the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully \n5 litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there was a reasonable expectation that the \n6 same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.”  Murphy v. Hunt, 455 \n7 U.S. 478, 482 (1982) (internal citations omitted).  “The capable-of-repetition doctrine applies \n8 only in exceptional situations, and generally only where the named plaintiff can make a \n9 reasonable showing that he will again be subjected to the alleged illegality.”  L.A. v. Lyons, 461 \n10 U.S. 95, 109 (1983).     \n11   Plaintiffs fail to satisfy the second prong of the test that requires the Plaintiffs to be \n12 subjected to the same action again.  Murphy, 455 U.S. at 482.  The “likelihood” of Plaintiffs \n13 returning to the Monterey County jail because of future criminal conduct is too speculative and \n14 not the “likelihood of future injury” that is required.  Clarke v. Lane, 267 F.R.D. 180, 192 (E.D. \n15 Pa. 2010).   Plaintiffs have not shown they are capable of suffering from the illegality again and \n16 as such have not satisfied their burden.  See Roe v. Operation Rescue, 919 F.3d 857, 864 (3d Cir. \n17 1990) (holding that where “injunctive relief is sought, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he is \n18 likely to suffer future injury from the defendant’s threatened conduct); see also Abdul-Akbar v. \n19 Watson, 4 F.3d 195, 207 (3d Cir. 1993) (“conjecture as to the likelihood of repetition has no \n20 place in the application of this exception and narrow grant of judicial power . . . speculative \n21 hypothesis” regarding whether plaintiff is likely to be incarcerated again is not appropriate in this \n22 analysis.”).  It has to be assumed that the released inmate “will conduct [his] activities within the \n23 law and so avoid prosecution and conviction” and subsequent incarceration.  L.A. v. Lyons, 461 \n24 U.S. at 103 (citing O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488 (1974)). \n25   Defendants also anticipate that Plaintiffs will argue that the circumstances in the instant \n26 case warrant the transitory claim exception as an exception to the mootness doctrine.  See \n27 Garaghty, 445 U.S. at 404.  However, the law is very clear that Garaghty does not apply where it \n28 is undisputed that Plaintiffs’ claims are mooted prior to the filing or granting of class \n7 \nHernandez, et al. v. County of Monterey, et al. Case  No.  CV 13-2354 PSG \nCounty Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to FRCP Rule 12(b)(6) \n\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document44   Filed04/25/14   Page12 of 12\n \n1 certification.  Clarke v. Lane, 267 F.R.D. at 192-193.  When claims of the named plaintiffs \n2 become moot before class certification, dismissal of the action is required.  Lusardi v. Xerox \n3 Corp., 975 F.2d 964, 974-75 (3d Cir. 1992) (“In such a situation, there is no plaintiff (either \n4 named or unnamed) who can assert a justiciable claim against any defendant and consequently \n5 there is no longer a ‘case or controversy’ within the meaning of Article III of the Constitution.”).  \n6 III.  CONCLUSION \n7   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request Plaintiffs, Robert Yancey, \n8 Richard Murphy, Dennis Guyot, Glenda Hunter, Martha Gomez, Wesley Miller, Jeffrey Nichols, \n9 Sarab Sarabi, and Albert Key, be dismissed. \n10   \n11 Dated:  April 25, 2014 \n12 CHARLES J.

I am an attorney duly admitted to practice before this Court.  I am an \n3 associate in the law firm of Rosen Bien Galvan & Grunfeld LLP (“RBGG”), counsel of \n4 record for Plaintiffs.  I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth herein, and if called \n5 as a witness, I could competently so testify.  I make this declaration in support of \n6 Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement Regarding Psychiatric Staffing and \n7 Telepsychiatry. \n8 2.  On May 27, 2016, the Court approved Defendants’ Implementation Plans, \n9 including the Clinical Staffing Implementation Plan requiring a 40-hour-per-week \n10 psychiatrist as well as an on-call “24/7” psychiatrist to work at the Monterey County Jail \n11 (the “Jail”).  See Dkt. 549 at 2; see also Dkt. 532, Ex. A at ECF 116 and 139-140.  On \n12 August 25, 2016, Peter Bertling, counsel for Defendant California Forensic Medical \n13 Group, Inc. (“CFMG”), sent me an email stating that:  “The[] psychiatric services at MCJ \n14 [Monterey County Jail] are currently being provided by a tele‐psychiatrist. Currently, there \n15 is no full time psychiatrist on site at MCJ.”  A true and correct copy of Mr. Bertling’s \n16 August 25, 2016 email is attached hereto as Exhibit A. \n17 3.  On November 10, 2016, I met and conferred by phone with Mr. Bertling \n18 regarding Plaintiffs’ concerns relating to the adequacy of psychiatric staffing at the Jail and \n19 Defendants’ use of telepsychiatry.  On the call, Mr. Bertling informed me that that there \n20 was no full-time psychiatrist presently working at the Jail, and that CFMG had hired \n21 Dr. Cristina Breiner as a full-time psychiatrist, to begin working at the Jail on January 3, \n22 2017 but for only half of the year.  Mr. Bertling explained that she would cease working at \n23 the Jail in early summer.  The following day, I sent an email to Mr. Bertling memorializing \n24 my understanding of our discussions.  Mr. Bertling responded the same day, stating that \n25 my memorialization of the call accurately reflected the substance of our conversation.  A \n26 true and correct copy of the November 11, 2016 email chain containing my email to \n27 Mr. Bertling and Mr. Bertling’s response is attached hereto as Exhibit B. \n28\n  2  Case No. CV 13 2354 BLF\nDECLARATION OF VAN SWEARINGEN IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO ENFORCE \n[3140422.2]   SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REGARDING PSYCHIATRIC STAFFING AND TELEPSYCHIATRY \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 3 of 163\n \n1 4.  On January 18 and 19, 2017, the Court-appointed neutral monitor on mental \n2 health, psychiatrist Kerry Hughes, M.D., toured the Monterey County Jail.  On May 12, \n3 2017, Dr. Hughes submitted to the parties his final report evaluating this tour.  A true and \n4 correct copy of Dr. Hughes’ May 12, 2017 final report is attached hereto as Exhibit C.  In \n5 the report, Dr. Hughes states on page 10: \n6 The monitor observed a telepsychiatry session during the monitoring visit. \nThis means of provision of psychiatric services appeared to be an acceptable \n7 and effective means of psychiatric care; however, it should not be the \nprimary mechanism for providing psychiatric care. All attempts should be \n8 made to ensure onsite coverage whenever possible. As this was the \npsychiatrist’s last day of providing telepsychiatry services, ongoing review \n9 of telepsychiatry is indicated. Additionally, with anticipated changes in the \nuse of the telepsychiatrists at the facility, this issue should be monitored in \n10 subsequent visits to ensure adequate psychiatric coverage at the facility in \nthe future. \n11\n12 5.  Mr. Bertling provided me with proposed revisions to CFMG’s \n13 Telepsychiatry Policy on August 25, 2016, March 23, 2017, and May 11, 2017.  These \n14 revisions did not include standards for when CFMG may deviate from a typical in-person \n15 psychiatric encounter and instead use telepsychiatry. \n16 6.  I spoke to Mr. Bertling by phone on June 5, 2017.  On that call, we discussed \n17 CFMG’s position on telepsychiatry and psychiatric staffing.  Mr. Bertling told me that \n18 Dr. Breiner is no longer working at the Jail, and it is unclear whether she will return to \n19 work at the Jail.  Mr. Bertling told me that he understood that CFMG psychiatrist \n20 Dr. Taylor Fithian and Dr. McKaye (first name unknown) would provide full-time \n21 psychiatric services at the Jail.  I asked Mr. Bertling to confirm their schedules with me, \n22 and he responded that he would.  I also asked Mr. Bertling to provide me with \n23 Dr. McKaye’s licensure information, and he responded that he would.  Shortly following \n24 the call, I sent Mr. Bertling an email asking him to confirm and send me certain \n25 information, including the staffing pattern schedules (days and times) for Drs. Fithian and \n26 McKaye, as well as the staffing pattern schedule for telepsychiatry.  The next day, on June \n27 6, 2017, Mr. Bertling provided me with CFMG’s most recent revisions to Defendants’ \n28 Telepsychiatry Policy and responded to my email requesting certain information by stating \n  3  Case No. CV 13 2354 BLF\nDECLARATION OF VAN SWEARINGEN IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO ENFORCE \n[3140422.2]   SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REGARDING PSYCHIATRIC STAFFING AND TELEPSYCHIATRY \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 4 of 163\n \n1 that he would provide me with that information “asap.”  I emailed Mr. Bertling on June 9, \n2 2017, requesting an update as to when Mr. Bertling would provide the information that I \n3 requested.  To date, Mr. Bertling has neither responded to my email nor provided me with \n4 the requested information.  A true and correct copy of the email string containing the \n5 above-described emails is attached hereto as Exhibit D.  A true and correct copy of \n6 CFMG’s June 6, 2016 proposed revisions to its Telepsychiatry Policy (“Defendants’ \n7 Proposal”), as attached to Mr. Bertling’s June 6, 2017 email is attached hereto as \n8 Exhibit E. \n9 7.  Plaintiffs deposed CFMG’s expert psychiatric witness Jason Roof, M.D., on \n10 October 3, 2014.  During that deposition, Dr. Roof testified regarding CFMG’s plans to \n11 add a full time on-site psychiatrist at the Jail.  Dr. Roof testified that this anticipated \n12 addition of a full-time (40 hours/week) on-site psychiatrist would lead to “an overall \n13 increase of accessibility.  The opinion of the full-time psychiatrist plus another psychiatrist \n14 is always going to be a better thing.  Barring some professional issues with the psychiatrist \n15 and what have you, but any time you’re going to have additional coverage to assist in \n16 medical care is usually going to be a very good thing for the patients.”  TR 206:13-23.  A \n17 true and correct copy of the transcript of that portion of the October 3, 2014 deposition of \n18 Dr. Roof is attached hereto as Exhibit F. \n19 8.  On June 20, 2017, I downloaded a copy of the American Psychological \n20 Association’s Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology from the website \n21 https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/amp-a0035001.pdf.  A true and correct copy , \n22 is attached hereto as Exhibit G.  On page 792 of the Guidelines, the term “in-person” is \n23 defined in the section titled “Definition of Telepsychology”:  “The term in-person, which \n24 is used in combination with the provision of services, refers to interactions in which the \n25 psychologist and the client/patient are in the same physical space and does not include \n26 interactions that may occur through the use of technologies.”  On page 795, the Guidelines \n27 state that:  “before psychologists engage in providing telepsychology services, they are \n28\n  4  Case No. CV 13 2354 BLF\nDECLARATION OF VAN SWEARINGEN IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO ENFORCE \n[3140422.2]   SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REGARDING PSYCHIATRIC STAFFING AND TELEPSYCHIATRY \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 5 of 163\n \n1 urged to conduct an initial assessment to determine the appropriateness of the \n2 telepsychology service to be provided for the client/patient.” \n3 9.  The Court held a hearing on April 28, 2016 regarding Defendants’ motions \n4 for approval of their Implementation Plans.  The hearing included a discussion of CFMG’s \n5 proposed use of telepsychiatry at the Jail.  A true and correct copy of the transcript of the \n6 portion of the April 28, 2016 hearing discussing telepsychiatry is attached hereto as \n7 Exhibit H. \n8 10.

Metzner, M.D.  The Textbook includes a \n11 Chapter by Li-Wen Lee, M.D. (of the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University \n12 College of Physicians and Surgeons) titled “Interviewing in correctional settings.”    \n13 Dr. Lee’s chapter includes a section on correctional telepsychiatry on page 65, which \n14 states: “While some mental health services can be delivered effectively by video, \n15 telepsychiatry is not a substitute for on-site staff, particularly in responding to emergencies \n16 or to deliver other modalities of assessment and treatment.”  A true and correct copy of  \n17 this chapter from the Oxford Textbook of Correctional Psychiatry is attached hereto as \n18 Exhibit I. \n19 11.  RBGG is counsel of record for Plaintiffs in Coleman v. Brown, Case No. 2-\n20 90-0520, in the Eastern District of California.  On February 6, 2017, Matthew A. Lopes, \n21 Jr., Esq., Special Master in Coleman v. Brown, submitted the Special Master’s Report on \n22 the Status of Mental Health Staffing and the Implementation of Defendants’ Staffing Plan \n23 as Dkt. No. 5564.  A true and correct copy of this report is attached hereto as Exhibit J.  \n24 Reporting on the mental health staffing of California’s prisons, the Special Master in \n25 Coleman v. Brown concluded that: \n26 Telepsychiatry is not clinically desirable as a frontline approach to providing \npsychiatric services for inmates with the most intensive or emergent needs.  \n27 The higher the acuity of mental illness, the less telepsychiatry should be \nrelied on as a permissible method of treatment….  For inmates at the MHCB \n28 [Mental Health Crisis Bed] level of care, telepsychiatry is not an appropriate \n  5  Case No. CV 13 2354 BLF\nDECLARATION OF VAN SWEARINGEN IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO ENFORCE \n[3140422.2]   SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REGARDING PSYCHIATRIC STAFFING AND TELEPSYCHIATRY \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 6 of 163\n \n1 method of treatment to be used on a regular basis….  The ease of \nmultidisciplinary interaction on-site is especially important in regards to \n2 emergency consultation, which is essential at the higher levels of care and \nmuch better accomplished with on-site psychiatrists. \n3  \n4 Dkt. 5564 at ECF 16-17.  In the Report, the Special Master also describes how on-site \n5 providers are better positioned to diagnose, treat, and coordinate care for patients behind \n6 bars: \n7 On-site psychiatrists are able to more positively impact the therapeutic \nmilieu by regularly interacting with correctional, nursing and other mental \n8 health staff.  This is just not possible with telepsychiatrists.  In addition, on-\nsite psychiatrists are better able to discern nonverbal behavior demonstrated \n9 by inmates which often has an important impact on diagnoses and treatment \nplanning. \n10  \n11 Dkt. 5564 at ECF 17. \n12 12.  On June 21, 2017, I downloaded a copy of a PDF document issued by the \n13 Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Disability Rights Section titled “Effective \n14 Communication,” from the website https://www.ada.gov/effective-comm.pdf.  At pages 2 \n15 through 4 of the document, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) describes how people who \n16 have vision, hearing, or speech disabilities use different ways to communicate, including:  \n17 computer screen-reading programs, computer-assisted real-time transcription (CART), \n18 telecommunications devices and/or relay service (TRS), and/or video remote interpreting \n19 (VRI).  A true and correct copy of the “DOJ” document titled “Effective Communication” \n20 is attached hereto as Exhibit K. \n21 13.  I conferred with Mr. Bertling about telepsychiatrist access to patient records \n22 during Dr. Pablo Stewart’s tour of the Jail on August 29, 2016, as well as by phone \n23 subsequent to that tour.  Mr. Bertling informed me that the telepsychiatrists affiliated with \n24 CFMG do not have access to the full patient medical history records kept at the Jail, and \n25 that complete patient files are not sent by CFMG staff to telepsychiatrists prior to patient \n26 evaluation.  In order for a remote telepsychiatrist to obtain patient records, CFMG staff can \n27 electronically process and send individual pages of a patient’s record from the Jail to the \n28 telepsychiatrist.  Mr. Bertling told me that CFMG-affiliated telepsychiatrists may be able  \n  6  Case No. CV 13 2354 BLF\nDECLARATION OF VAN SWEARINGEN IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO ENFORCE \n[3140422.2]   SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REGARDING PSYCHIATRIC STAFFING AND TELEPSYCHIATRY \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 7 of 163\n \n1 to access the entire patient record once CFMG implements an Electronic Medical Record \n2 system.

19, 2017 \nOverview \nThe Monterey County Jail was visited for the first mental health monitoring tour on \nJanuary 18 and January 19, 2017. The following report is based upon interviews with \ninstitutional staff and detainees, medical records reviews, as well as review of documentation \nand information provided by the institution and County.  This report will specifically address the \ninstitution's status and progress toward compliance with the United States District Court \nNorthern District of California Settlement Agreement and the Implementation Plans between \nPlaintiffs Jesse Hernandez et al., and Defendants, County of Monterey; Monterey County \nSheriff's Office; California Forensic Medical Group, INCORPORATED (CFMG) et al. \nCompliance with Settlement Agreement and Implementation Plan \n1.  Intake Screening \na.  Defendants will develop and implement an Intake Screening Implementation Plan \nthat specifies standards and timelines to ensure that arriving prisoners are \npromptly screened for urgent medical, mental health and dental needs, with \nprompt follow-up and disability accommodations. \nUpon arrival, an Initial Health Assessment will be performed by the intake \n1. \nnurse to determine whether the inmate should be excluded from the \nfacility on medical or mental health grounds. Upon acceptance into the \njail, all inmates will be screened by the intake nurse for urgent medical, \nmental health and dental needs. The intake nurse will have access to an \n1 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 16 of 163\ninmate's medical records if the inmate has been previously incarcerated in \nthe Monterey County jail. \nA mental health assessment tool will be used at intake to determine which \n11. \nprisoners need Psychological or Psychiatric evaluation and on what time \nframe. \nm.  The Intake Screening Implementation Plan shall also provide for the use \nof a suicide risk assessment tool, with psychological evaluation for those \nwith positive findings on the suicide assessment. \nFindings: Deferred \nObservations during the tour as well as review of provided documents and medical \nrecords indicated that an initial health assessment was routinely performed by an intake nurse at \nthe time of arrival to the jail, and inmates were referred to mental health as clinically indicated. \nThere appeared to be a process in place for acute as well as routine mental health referral and \nevaluation.  One area of recommendation was the need for greater confidentiality during the \nintake assessment performed by the nurse.  Observations of the intake assessment revealed that \nofficers were present just outside the intake assessment room, allowing for possible non \nconfidentiality as the intake assessment was performed by the nurse in the intake booking area. \nThe close proximity of the officers might prevent some inmates from providing necessary \nmedical and mental health information. \nA mental health assessment and suicide risk tools were routinely utilized at the time of intake \nfor appropriate mental health assessment, triage and treatment. \n2 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 17 of 163\nThe next monitoring tour will examine the availability of an inmate's medical records at the \ntime of intake as well as acceptance and clearance of individuals at the time ofj ail intake \nassessment. \n2.  Mental Health Screening \na.  Defendants shall develop and implement a Mental Health Care Implementation \nPlan to more thoroughly ensure timely access to necessary treatment by Qualified \nMental Health Professionals for prisoners with mental illness, including \nappropriate screening...  The Implementation Plan provides that all inmates will \nhave an initial mental health screening performed by a qualified mental health \nprofessional on the mental health staff. \nb.  Defendants shall develop and implement a Mental Health Care Implementation \nPlan to more thoroughly ensure timely access to necessary treatment by Qualified \nMental Health Professionals for prisoners with mental illness, including ... \nmedication practices \nFindings: Deferred \nThese issues will be reviewed at the next monitoring visit. \nc.  Defendants shall develop and implement a Health Care Implementation Plan to \nexpand the provision of care for inmates with serious medical and/or mental \nhealth needs and to ensure they receive timely treatment appropriate to the acuity \nof their conditions.  The Implementation plan outlines the process by which \ninmates provide mental health sick call requests and healthcare staff respond to \nsuch requests. \n3 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 18 of 163\nd.  Nursing staff shall conduct daily mental health rounds in segregation. \nFindings: Deferred \nThese issues will be reviewed at the next monitoring visit. \n3.  Safety Cells \na.  The Health Care and Mental Health Implementation Plans shall provide for \nnecessary coordination between medical staff and custody regarding placement of \nprisoners in a safety cell, addressing the prisoner's medical and mental health \nneeds, custody's overall responsibility for safety and security of prisoners, prompt \nreviews by medical of all placements, and a process of resolving disagreements \nbetween medical and custody. \nFindings: Deferred \nInterviews with custody and mental health staff indicated that inmates were placed into \nthe safety or sobering cells by custody, medical or mental health staff; and mental health was \nthen informed regarding that placement or noted such placements during their daily rounds. \nThere appeared to be a system in place for prompt evaluation of inmates who were placed into \nthese cells.  The facility also had developed a system to resolve disagreements that arose from \nsuch placements, and provided documents were reviewed that confirmed this observation. It was \nunclear at the time of the visit, whether timely suicide risk assessment, vital signs monitoring and \nmedical checks occurred.  This issue will be evaluated further at the next monitoring visit. \nb.  Placement of an inmate in a safety or sobering cell, whether it be from housing or \nupon intake, should be in concert with medical staff.  A qualified medical \n4 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 19 of 163\nprofessional will see an inmate within one hour of placement in a sobering cell. \nInmates will be released from a sobering cell upon clearance by medical staff. \nFindings: Deferred \nThere was an on-call system in place for mental health staff which provided for clinician \navailability regarding assessment of inmates who were placed into the safety cells after hours. \nInmates were generally seen timely by a mental health clinician during work hours after such \nplacements; however, a review of the logs indicated that there were occasions in which inmates \nwere not always seen within one hour of placement. Removal from the safety cells occurred after \nmental health evaluation and clearance. \nc.  A safety check for inmates in safety and sobering cells, consisting of direct visual \nobservation that is sufficient to assess the inmate's well-being and behavior, shall \noccur twice every 30 minutes. Each time a deputy or sergeant conducts a welfare \ncheck it shall be documented in the welfare check log.  A sergeant shall verify \nwhether deputies are completing their checks, at least one time per shift.  The \nsergeants will initial the welfare check logs to indicate that they have reviewed \nthe welfare check log, at least one time per shift.  Spot checks for compliance will \nbe conducted by the Compliance Sergeant at least once per week.  Once a month, \nthe Compliance Sergeant will track his findings through a report which will be \nsent to the Jail Operations Commander.  Any deputy or sergeant who \ndemonstrates consistent difficulty in adhering to welfare check log requirements \nwill be subject to additional training and/or disciplinary action at the discretion of \ntheir supervisor. \n5 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 20 of 163\nFindings: Deferred \nThere was a system in place for the logging of custody welfare checks and observations \nof inmates placed in the safety and sobering cells.  Although there was documentation that \nwelfare checks occurred twice every 30 minutes, there was documentation that there were some \nlapses. A review of the logs and accompanying documentation indicated that the facility did have \na system in place for the auditing of these checks, as well as feedback to the supervisory staff \nregarding problem areas. \nd.  Unless contraindicated by security and safety needs, inmates who are in a safety \ncell for more than 14 hours will receive a mattress or safety sleeping bag between \nthe hours of 11 :00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.  The Operations Commander will ensure \nthat a sufficient number of safety sleeping bags for use are available. \nFindings: Noncompliance \nLogs indicated that there was a lack of documentation regarding whether mattresses and \nsleeping bags were always offered to inmates placed into the safety and sobering cells.  Although \nthis was an area of concern, there was a system in place for tracking compliance in this area.  It \nwas unclear at the time of this visit if any corrective action was implemented to address this \nissue. \ne.  Inmates in sobering cells may have access to mattresses at the discretion of \ncustody staff.  Mattresses have been and will continue to be available in the intake \nand receiving area for this use. The Operations Commander will ensure that a \nsufficient number of mattresses for use are available. \nFindings: Noncompliance \n6 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 21 of 163\nSee above. \nf.  Safety cells shall be cleaned whenever there is a change in the inmate housed in \nthe cell in addition to the regular cleaning schedule.  Sobering cells shall be \ncleaned on a regular cleaning schedule.  Custody staffing will be maintained to \nallow medical staff to enter the sobering cells to make vital checks. \nFindings: Substantial Compliance \nObservations during the monitoring tour indicated that the safety and sobering cells were \nclean and not in use at the time of the visit.  Interviews with some inmates indicated that there \nwere some problems with consistent cleaning of the cells.  Supervisory staff reported that the \ncells were cleaned after each use. \ng.  For any inmate who has been housed in a safety cell for 24 consecutive hours, \ncustody shall promptly begin processing the inmate for transfer to either an \nappropriate in-patient mental health facility or the Natividad Medical Center \nemergency room for assessment. \nFindings: Deferred \nThere was a process in place at the jail by which inmates who had been housed in a safety \ncell for 24 consecutive hours were evaluated and processed for transfer to inpatient treatment. \nAlthough this system was in place, access to inpatient mental health treatment was poor and \ndifficult to obtain for all inmates referred for inpatient care. Inmates were frequently returned to \nthe jail after assessment and prior to stabilization. Access to inpatient mental health services \nremained problematic. This issue will be examined in greater detail during the next mental health \nmonitoring tour. \n7 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 22 of 163\n4.  Medication Continuity \na.  All inmates newly booked into the jail, who at the time of booking are prescribed \nmedications in the community, shall be timely continued on those medications, or \nprescribed comparable appropriate medication, unless a medical provider makes \nan appropriate clinical determination that medications are not necessary for \ntreatment. \nFindings: Defe rred \nA review of medical records and observations during the visit indicated that the intake \nnurses obtained information regarding prescribed mental health medications in the \ncommunity and began the process for verifying such treatment.  For those cases in which the \nmedication treatment was unverified or unclear, those individuals were scheduled to see a \nmental health provider for assessment. Due to the noted delay in medication continuity noted \nbelow, a finding of compliance is deferred until the next visit, when additional information \nwill be obtained. \nb.  Inmates who, at the time of booking, report to Defendants that they are taking \ncommunity-prescribed medications, but whose medications cannot be verified by \nDefendants, shall be timely assessed by a medical provider and timely prescribed \nmedications necessary to treat their health needs. \nFindings: Deferred \nSee above.  One healthcare record was reviewed (Inmate 4) that showed a delay in \nprescribing necessary psychotropic medications, despite recent treatment at the facility. This \n8 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 23 of 163\ncase appeared to be an exception to otherwise timely provision of medications. This issue \nwill receive additional review at the next monitoring visit. \nc.  Provision of psychotropic medications upon discharge from the jail.  The \nImplementation Plan provides that a 30-day supply of medications be given to \ninmates upon discharge from the jail. \nFindings: Deferred \nThis issue will be reviewed at the next mental health monitoring visit. \n5.  Clinical Staffing \na.  Defendants will maintain Qualified Medical Professional and Qualified Mental \nHealth Professional staffing at the Jail to ensure adequate staffing to provide all \nnecessary medical and mental health care.  The plan will identify all needed \npositions based on current and projected Jail population, and the number and \nqualifications of medical and mental health care staff to cover each position, with \nshift relief. \nFindings: Deferred \nAt the time of the visit, the mental health staffing was as follows: \n0.8 FTE Psychiatrist (onsite)- 32 hours per week \n0.9 FTE Psychiatrist (telepsychiatry)-36 hours per week \nI FTE Psychiatric Registered Nurse/Psychologist - 40 hours per week \n1.4 FTE Licensed Clinical Social Worker - 56 hours per week \n1 FTE Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist- 40 hours per week \n9 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 24 of 163\nAlthough the plaintiffs noted that no staffing analysis was conducted as set forth in the \nSettlement Agreement; the current mental health staffing at the jail appeared to be adequate \nfor the population and services required.  Psychiatric on-call services were primarily \nprovided by Dr. Fithian, and all of the clinicians provided on-call services on a rotating basis. \nThe monitor observed a telepsychiatry session during the monitoring visit.  This means of \nprovision of psychiatric services appeared to be an acceptable and effective means of \npsychiatric care; however, it should not be the primary mechanism for providing psychiatric \ncare.  All attempts should be made to ensure onsite coverage whenever possible. \nAs this was the psychiatrist's last day of providing telepsychiatry services, ongoing review of \ntelepsychiatry is indicated. Additionally, with anticipated changes in the use of the \ntelepsychiatrists at the facility, this issue should be monitored in subsequent visits to ensure \nadequate psychiatric coverage at the facility in the future. \n6.  Mental Health Care \na.  Training \nAll correctional staff will receive training through staff briefings on any \n1. \nnew requirements or procedures imposed by the Implementation plans. \nAll new correctional staff will receive training on the requirements \nimposed by the Implementation plans. \nFindings: Substantial Compliance \n10 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 25 of 163\nDocumentation provided indicated that correctional staff had received training regarding \nthe Implementation Plan; however, this training had not yet been incorporated into the new \nhire training. \n11.  In coordination with CFMG, all new deputies within one month of being \nstationed at the Monterey County jail will participate in an orientation \ntraining session with CFMG staff on how to recognize individuals who are \nin mental distress and/or suicidal. \nFindings: Substantial Compliance \nThis training was in place for new correctional officers. \n111.  All deputies, sergeants, and commanders will receive 24 hours of \nStandards and Training for Corrections (\"STC\") certified training per year. \nEvery two years, all deputies, sergeants and commanders will receive \neight hours of training regarding medical issues central to inmates, which \nwill include identifying risk factors specific to inmates, identifying \nwarning signs specific to inmates, and how to recognize individuals who \nare in mental distress and/or suicidal. \nFindings: Substantial Compliance \nThis training was in place. \n11 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 26 of 163\niv.  Yearly custody staff will conduct a situational training such as a mock \nsuicide attempt or a medical emergency.  CFMG staff will also participate \nin the annual situational training. \nFindings: Noncompliance \nAlthough plans were in place for yearly emergency drills, including mock suicide drills; \nverification of this training was not received. \nb.  Restraint Chairs \n1.  Use of a restraint chair will be documented in an observation log which \nwill be reviewed and signed by a supervisor.  Inmates shall not be placed \nin a restraint chair for longer than six consecutive hours. \nFindings: Substantial Compliance \nThere was no documented use of the restraint chairs during the monitoring period. The \nImplementation Plan did include guidelines for the use of the restraint chair, duration of \nplacement, monitoring after placement and criteria for removal. This issue will continue to be \nmonitored on subsequent visits to evaluate use of the restraint chairs when and if it occurs. \n11.  Deputies shall attempt to remove restraints at least once an hour to allow \ninmates to exercise their arms and hands in a range of motion exercise (to \nprevent circulatory problems). A shift supervisor and medical staff shall . \noversee the exercise. If unsuccessful in allowing inmates to exercise their \narms and hands in a range of motion exercise, safety staff shall explain on \n12 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 27 of 163\nthe observation log why extremities could not be exercised and a shift \nsupervisor shall be notified. \nFindings: Substantial Compliance \nThere was no documented use of the restraint chairs during the monitoring period. This \nissue will continue to be monitored on subsequent visits to evaluate use of the restraint chairs \nwhen and if it occurs. \n111.  On a monthly basis, the compliance sergeant will audit one incident of use \nof a restraint chair, if any existed in that month, to determine if proper \ndocumentation has been maintained. \nFindings: Substantial Compliance \nThere was no documented use of the restraint chairs during the monitoring period.  This \nissue will continue to be monitored on subsequent visits to evaluate use of the restraint chairs \nwhen and if it occurs. \n1v.  Medical and mental health staff shall be consulted before any planned use \nof force on an inmate.  Custody staff in concert with medical staff will \ndevelop the most effective and appropriate means of imposing compliance \nwith rules and regulation, including attempts at de-escalation.  It is \nunderstood that it is the goal of custody staff to use the least amount of \nforce necessary to ensure compliance with rules and regulations.  Planned \nuse of force will only be used after verbal attempts to obtain compliance. \nAny use of force will be documented on a use of force form. \nFindings: Noncompliance \n13 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 28 of 163\nAlthough there was no documented use of the restraint chairs during the \nmonitoring period, interviews with staff indicated that there was not consistent and \ndocumented consultation between custody and mental health regarding planned uses of force. \nc.  Mental Health Grants \n1.  Monterey County Office of the Sheriff will in good faith continue to \npursue state funding for mental health and programming space at the jail. \nThe Monterey County Public Defender will cooperate in those efforts. \nFindings: Noncompliance \nNo information was obtained during the visit to verify that such funding had been \npursued. \nd.  Inmates Who Have Been Declared Incompetent to Stand Trial \n1.  The County and Plaintiffs recognize that there is often a waiting period \nfrom the time a Court has found an inmate to be incompetent to stand trial \nand when a State facility is able to receive the transfer of such inmate. \nThe parties recognize that inmates can be particularly vulnerable during \nthis time period.  As such, within 24 hours of a Court determining that an \ninmate is mentally incompetent to stand trial, the inmate will be placed in \nan administrative segregation transition cell unless contraindicated by \nmedical staff.  Inmates in transition cells shall be seen by medical staff on \na daily basis, who are trained in suicide risk assessment.  The Monterey \nCounty Office of the Public Defender shall take all appropriate measures \n(including filing requests to the Monterey County Superior Court for \n14 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 29 of 163\norders to show cause to be directed the State of California) to expedite the \ntransfer of inmates who have been determined to be incompetent to stand \ntrial to an appropriate State facility. \nFindings: Noncompliance \nInmates were not routinely placed into transition cells or administrative segregation and \nseen by medical staff daily upon a Court finding the inmate to be incompetent to stand trial. \nThese inmates were generally housed in a general population cell. Despite this, the staff \nappeared to work hard to timely transfer those individuals to a forensic unit. \ne.  Treatment Plans \n1.  CFMG will develop individual treatment plans for the treatment of \ninmates who are suffering from mental illnesses. \nFindings: Deferred \nA review of medical records indicated the presence of individual treatment plans for \nmentally ill inmates. Prior to a finding of substantial compliance, additional treatment plans \nwill be reviewed at the next monitoring visit. \nf.  Consideration of Mental Illness in Inmate Discipline \n1.  Mental illness will be considered in administering any disciplinary \nmeasures against an inmate.  Custody staff are encouraged to contact the \nappropriate qualified mental health care staff when evaluating the level of \ndiscipline for an inmate with mental illness. \nFindings: Noncompliance \n15 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 30 of 163\nA review of the Disciplinary Action Reports (DAR) indicated that there was no place on \nthe form to note that mental health was contacted prior to November 2016; this was later \ncorrected.  It did not appear that corrections officers were aware if inmates were receiving \nmental health services and therefore did not contact mental health when disciplinary \ninfractions occurred. \ng.  Space Issues \nDefendants shall develop and implement a Mental Health Care \n1. \nImplementation Plan to more thoroughly ensure timely access to necessary \ntreatment by Qualified Mental Health Professionals for prisoners with \nmental illness, including ... adequate clinical and administrative treatment \nspace .... \nFindings: Deferred \nAlthough treatment space was available for clinicians to evaluate and treat patients in a \nconfidential setting, specific housing for mentally ill individuals housed at the facility was not \nprovided, and it was unclear at the time oft he visit whether mental health staff had dedicated office \nspace.  This issue will be reviewed in greater detail at the next mental health monitoring visit. \nh.  Administrative Segregation \nThe Mental Health Implementation Plan shall require classification to \n1. \nassess a totality of factors when assigning prisoners to administrative \nsegregation units.  It is understood that the goal of Defendants is to limit \n16 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 31 of 163\nthe use of administrative segregation for prisoners with serious mental \nillness. \nFindings: Deferred \nThis monitoring tour noted that mentally ill prisoners were routinely housed in the \nadministrative segregation units, and that the placement of such individuals on these units \nwas not limited. Although measures were instituted to mitigate against the effects of \nadministrative segregation placement, such as group therapy and daily checks, these units \nremained occupied with mentally ill individuals.  This issue will be reviewed further at the \nnext monitoring visit. \n11.  The Mental Health Implementation Plan shall require placement \nscreening of all prisoners for mental illness and suicidality before or \npromptly after they are housed in administrative segregation ... \n111.  The Mental Health Implementation Plan shall address suicide watch and \nsuicide precautions procedures to ensure that prisoners in crisis are not \nplaced in punitive and/or unsanitary conditions. \nFindings: Deferred \nThese issues will be reviewed further at the next monitoring visit. \n7.  Suicide Prevention \n17 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 32 of 163\na.  Defendants shall remove hanging points and other hazards in jail administrative \nsegregation cells that pose an unreasonable risk of being used by inmates to harm \nthemselves or attempt suicide. \nFindings: Substantial Compliance \nAll of the cells in administrative segregation units (A, B, Rand S) were modified to \nremove potential tie-off opportunities.  In addition, fencing was installed on the upper level \nand stairway to prevent jumping and self-harm. \nb.  Welfare checks will consist of direct visual observation that is sufficient to assess \nthe inmate's well-being and behavior, Custody staff will conduct hourly checks \nsupplemented with random additional checks which when added together should \nachieve the every 30 minute goal. \n1.  Deputies shall continue to conduct hourly welfare checks, but will add an \nadditional three checks per shift at random intervals, during the day and \nnight shifts and an additional six checks per shift at random intervals \nduring the midnight shift.  Welfare checks shall include a visual \nobservation of each inmate in the unit with verbal interaction if necessary. \n11.  All welfare checks shall be documented on a welfare check log. The logs \nwill be reviewed and initialed by the on-duty sergeants at least one time \nper shift to insure compliance.  Monthly spot checks for compliance will \nbe conducted by the Compliance Sergeant at least weekly with monthly \naudits. \nFindings: Deferred \n18 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 33 of 163\nThere was documentation that the custody welfare checks were conducted appropriately, \nwith some few exceptions.  Audits were performed by custody supervisory staff based upon \nadministrative segregation welfare door entry.  Welfare checks were documented on a log, \nand there was also documentation of audits that were conducted by custody supervisory staff. \nThe only exception was in the male administrative segregation units A and B where there \nwere problems with the door that prevented adequate auditing.  Supervisory staff reported \nthat the facility was in the process of replacing the doors later this year. A findings of \ncompliance will be deferred until full auditing is completed. \nc.  Increase in Time Outside of Cell and/or Increasing Programs \n1.  Unless exigent circumstances or safety and security concerns exist, each \ninmate in administrative segregation pods A, B, R, and S will be \nguaranteed the following weekly times out of their cell: \n1.  3 hours a week for exercise and socialization (e xercise time will \ninclude exercise with one or more other inmates) \n2.  14 hours a week of \"socialization time\" where at least one other \ninmate is in the common area at the same time \n3.  2 hours a week of programming will be offered to each inmate (it \nis understood that inmates may refuse to participate in programs \noffered at the County jail) \nii.  Unless exigent circumstances or safety and security concerns exist, each \ninmate in isolation cells and single holding cells outside of the booking \n19 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 34 of 163\nand receiving area will be guaranteed the following weekly times out of \ntheir cell: \n1.  3 hours of week for exercise \n2.  14 hours a week in the common area \n3.  2 hours a week of programming will be offered to each inmate (it \nis understood that inmates may refuse to participate in programs \noffered at the County jail \nm.  inmates in administrative segregation will have access to the normal group \nprograms provided at the County jail such as NA/A  A, religious services, \nFindings: Substantial Compliance \nReview of logs and audits indicated that inmates housed in the administrative segregation \nunits as well as in the isolation and single holding cells outside of the booking and receiving \nareas were afforded the required out of cell time as outlined by the Settlement Agreement \nand Implementation Plans with some few exceptions.  Additionally, inmates in \nadministrative segregation were afforded access to group therapy weekly which was \nprovided by the mental health staff as well as other groups and activities such as NA/A  A, \nreligious activities, parenting groups and other self-help activities. \n20 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 35 of 163\nSummary and Recommendations \nI want to thank all of the parties and the Monterey County Jail staff for helping to facilitate this \nmonitoring visit.  The staff was extremely cooperative and responsive to my requests, providing \nnecessary access to jail activities, staff, inmates and requested documents. \nThe following are recommendations to address the Settlement Agreement/Implementation Plan \nissues of concern. \n1.  The County should continue to work to improve access to timely inpatient psychiatric \ncare for all jail inmates in need of such services. \n2.  There was the need for greater confidentiality during the intake assessment performed by \nthe nurse. Observations of the intake assessment revealed that officers were present just \noutside the intake assessment room, allowing for possible non-confidential intake \nassessments.  The close proximity of the officers might prevent some inmates from \nproviding necessary medical and mental health information. \n3.  The facility should ensure that inmates are offered a mattress or safety sleeping bag when \nindicated while housed in the safety and sobering cells with appropriate documentation. \nCorrective action should also be documented when staff fail to address this concern. \n4.  The facility should conduct a yearly situational training such as a mock suicide attempt or \na medical emergency, with the involvement of CFMG.  The facility should provide \nverification of such training for all staff. \n5.  Medical and mental health staff shall be consulted before any planned use of force on an \ninmate. \n21 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 36 of 163\n6.  Mental illness should be considered in administering any disciplinary measures against \nan inmate, and greater consultation is needed between custody and mental health staff to \nensure that mental illness is taken into consideration.  Although the DAR forms were \nmodified to include documentation of this contact, it did not appear that the necessary \nconsultation occurred routinely. \n7.  The County should provide documentation to verify that the Office of the Sheriff in \ncooperation with The Monterey County Public Defender has pursued state funding for \nmental health and programming space at the jail. \n8.  In lieu of placement of inmates who were declared incompetent to stand trial into \ntransition cells in administrative segregation, mental health staff should ensure that these \ninmates are immediately identified and placed onto a priority list for daily follow-up and \nmonitoring. The County should continue to work to expedite the transfer of these \ninmates to an appropriate State inpatient facility. \n9.  The County should work to decrease the use of administrative segregation as housing for \nmentally ill individuals.  In lieu of alternative placement, mitigating factors such as \nclinical contacts, rounding and out of cell activities should continue as outlined in the \nSettlement Agreement and Implementation Plans. \n22 \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 37 of 163\nPlease contact me should you have any questions regarding this report. \nRespectfully submitted, \nMental Health Mo ito \nKerry C.

On what date?\n2 Q.      About.\n3 A.      I don't -- I don't have a recollection of that.\n4 I'm not sure.  I am aware of the result that there were\n5 some addition of coverage, but I can't recall what day I\n6 reviewed it.\n7 Q.      Do you know who Daniel Hustedt is?\n8 A.      A consultant of some regard.  More than that,\n9 I'm not sure.\n10 Q.      Okay.\n11         (Reporter clarification.)\n12 Q.      BY MR. FISCHER:  And do you have any idea the\n13 basis for the information that you -- that Mr. Hustedt\n14 provided in his declaration?\n15 A.      I'm not at this time, no.\n16 Q.      Okay.  Now, you say you're aware that CFMG had\n17 added 20 hours of psychiatric LCSW coverage to its\n18 program?\n19 A.      Yes.\n20 Q.      Based on your expertise and your review, do you\n21 think that addition of staff is necessary in order to\n22 provide adequate mental health care at the facility?\n23 A.      I don't think it's necessary.  But it is great.\n24 It's great that additional hours were added.  I think it\n25 will be a better result.  I don't think that it was\nPage 205\nTHORSNES LITIGATION SERVICES, LLC  |  877.771.3312  |  www.thorsnes.com\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 53 of 163\nJason Roof, MD October 3, 2014\n1 necessary that it be done, but any time there's\n2 additional coverage is always a very good sign.\n3 Q.      And with respect to the second part of the\n4 sentence, are you aware that TMG is currently in the\n5 process of recruiting a full-time psychiatrist position.\n6 Do you have any opinion as to the addition of a\n7 full-time psychiatrist is necessary in order to provide\n8 adequate patient care at Monterey County Jail?\n9 A.      Again, I don't think it was necessary, but I\n10 think it's going to be very beneficial.  More coverage\n11 is typically going to mean better outcome for the\n12 patients.\n13 Q.      What do you mean by that?  What do you think a\n14 full-time psychiatrist will provide that's not being\n15 provided now, if anything?\n16 A.      I think it's going to be an overall increase of\n17 accessibility.  The opinion of the full-time\n18 psychiatrist plus another psychiatrist is always going\n19 to be a better thing.  Barring some professional issues\n20 with the psychiatrist and what have you, but any time\n21 you're going to have additional coverage to assist in\n22 medical care is usually going to be a very good thing\n23 for the patients.\n24 Q.      Did you do any review to determine whether the\n25 addition of a full-time psychiatrist might be excessive\nPage 206\nTHORSNES LITIGATION SERVICES, LLC  |  877.771.3312  |  www.thorsnes.com\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 54 of 163\nJason Roof, MD October 3, 2014\n1 given the need at the jail?\n2 A.      No.  I did not do a study.\n3 Q.      Okay.  Same thing for the additional 20 hours of\n4 the psychiatric RN social worker, did you do any review\n5 to determine whether that would be an excessive amount\n6 of coverage?\n7 A.      No, I did not.\n8 Q.      Is there -- so your opinion is whittled down to\n9 more is better?\n10 A.      Yes.\n11 Q.      Okay.  I want to turn to paragraph 40 of your\n12 declaration.  It's at the bottom of page 21.  The title\n13 \"CFMG is not responsible for jail facilities.\"  Were you\n14 not asked to opine as to the adequacy of jail facilities\n15 as part of your evaluation?\n16 A.      I was not.\n17 Q.      Okay.  As a treating psychiatrist, do you think\n18 that when you're -- if you're in a situation -- I'm\n19 speaking hypothetically now.  If you were in a situation\n20 where you're unable to treat patients in a setting that\n21 you deem appropriate, do you feel like -- do you feel\n22 responsibility to take steps in order to provide care in\n23 an appropriate setting?\n24 A.

But really this is where I get suspicious, is that we\n8 had been working to get specific implementation plans but we\n9 have a roadmap of what needs to be done and this is very\n10 amorphous.\n11 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.\n12 On the issue of telepsychiatry, let me just ask.\n13 Mr. Galvan, what is the plaintiffs' specific objection?\n14 Just the potential that this may become the norm rather than\n15 the exception?\n16 MR. GALVAN: Well, the specific document that CFMG\n17 attached to their plan, which is their telepsychiatry policy,\n18 basically it's the same policy that they've had all along.\n19 And so one of our concerns about the way that the\n20 defendants are approaching their implementation of this\n21 settlement agreement is that there are no changes from the\n22 practices before we filed the case.\n23 And so if there's one thing that we -- we believe is\n24 required by the settlement agreement is change.\n25 And they recite that they are starting change, that they\nKelly Polvi, CSR, RDR, FCRR - 503.779.7406 - kpolvi@comcast.net\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 70 of 163\n55\n1 had started change before they settled.\n2 But more specifically, the problem is that that\n3 particular policy allows for telepsychiatry in the very first\n4 visit with a person with serious mental illness and in any kind\n5 of emergency.\n6 And what our experts have seen about that that's\n7 troubling is that telepsychiatry needs to be prescribed based\n8 on some qualified clinical knowledge about the patient.\n9 So in other words, someone who actually has established a\n10 bench-line exam of that patient, either psychiatric or medical,\n11 then you could say, \"Okay, this condition we're going to follow\n12 with telepsychiatry.\"\n13 THE COURT: Are you saying that you can't establish or\n14 measure that bench-line using telepsychiatry in the first\n15 instance? Is that what your expert is suggesting?\n16 MR. GALVAN: That's what -- I mean, that is what the\n17 experts are suggesting. That's what -- and he also attached\n18 the American Psychiatric Association guidelines, which are also\n19 saying that as well.\n20 And then also for some patients it's not appropriate. If\n21 you have patients whose symptoms prevent them from\n22 understanding even what is that person on the screen, then\n23 you're not going to use -- should not be using telepsychiatry\n24 for that.\n25 And this is -- and also an example I think where we're --\nKelly Polvi, CSR, RDR, FCRR - 503.779.7406 - kpolvi@comcast.net\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 71 of 163\n56\n1 it's just a clear breach of contract. Because the settlement\n2 agreement says a face-to-face clinical encounter -- or clinical\n3 encounter shall typically be face to face. And what we get\n4 instead is we could make it on telephone all the time whenever\n5 we want.\n6 THE COURT: Well, the agreement does say that the\n7 encounter must be typically in person. I see that. But it\n8 also says explicit that this term does not preclude the use;\n9 right?\n10 MR. GALVAN: Correct. And we are adhering to that\n11 faithfully. We're not asking them to preclude the use. We're\n12 asking them just to provide the clinicians with some basic\n13 guidelines as to when it's appropriate and when it's not\n14 appropriate.\n15 THE COURT: Okay. I think I have it.\n16 MR. GALVAN: Thank you.\n17 THE COURT: Mr. Bertling.\n18 MR. BERTLING: Your Honor, we spent a considerable amount\n19 of time making certain that language was in there, that\n20 face-to-face included the use of telepsychiatry. Because in\n21 some circumstances, for example, an emergency circumstance,\n22 that may be the quickest route to get one of our patients to\n23 have an evaluation by a psychiatrist.\n24 We use high-tech equipment so we're not using outdated\n25 equipment, it's an effective method of conducting an interview\nKelly Polvi, CSR, RDR, FCRR - 503.779.7406 - kpolvi@comcast.net\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 72 of 163\n57\n1 with a client, evaluating them, it's a situation where the\n2 nurses there, as well, provide additional information of\n3 necessary.\n4 And on the rest of that note, just (indiscernible.)\n5 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.\n6 All right. That takes us, I believe, to a raft of issues\n7 regarding dental care. And I will say candidly, for as long as\n8 we've all been working on this case, I have not focused as much\n9 on the dental-care issues as some of these others that you've\n10 raised. So I have spent some time digging into some of the\n11 details in your briefs on dental care disputes that I have not\n12 with some of the others I was more familiar with.\n13 That's a long way of me saying I think I understand your\n14 respective positions on each of these issues, but I have just a\n15 couple of questions. And of course I'll invite you to\n16 supplement your papers as you see fit.\n17 One question I had regarding dental care was with respect\n18 to the oral pathologies. And in particular, what direction, if\n19 any, is given for when oral pathologies are going to be\n20 required, if at all.\n21 So Mr. Bertling, if you could just perhaps elaborate on\n22 what you've presented in your papers?\n23 MR. BERTLING: Certainly, Your Honor.\n24 I think typically it starts out as a nurse or somebody\n25 observing a lesion in the patient's oral cavity.

ECF No. 5439 at 12.  As previously reported, \nmental health staffing deficiencies within the California prisons were addressed in the Coleman \nCourt’s 1995 remedial order, when the Court ruled that the prisons were “significantly and \nchronically understaffed in the area of mental health care services.”  Coleman v. Wilson, 912 F. \nSupp. 1282, 1307 (E.D. Cal. 1995).  In early 1996, the Special Master began an assessment of \ndefendants’ staffing ratios, filing his first report regarding their adequacy in November 1998.  \nECF No. 993.  The Special Master filed his first report addressing defendants’ staffing vacancies \nin May 1999.  ECF No. 1032.  Since 1998, the Special Master has consistently reported on \ndefendants’ mental health staffing issues, to include 18 reports that directly or indirectly \naddressed staffing deficiencies1, in addition to addressing staffing vacancies in all 26 of his \nmonitoring reports.  \n                                                           \n1 Special Master’s Recommendations for Staffing Ratios, (filed 11/20/1998, ECF No.994); Supplementary \nRecommendations of the Special Master on Staffing Ratios and Administrative Segregation, (filed 5/19/1999, ECF \nNo.1033); Special Master’s Report on Staffing Vacancies, (filed 5/19/1999, ECF No.1032); Special Master’s \nRecommendations on Defendants’ Request for Extension of Time to Staff Administrative Segregation and Expedite \nTransfers, (filed 2/8/2000, ECF No.1131); Special Master’s Recommendation on the Development of a Retention \nPlan for Psychiatrists, (filed 4/24/2000, ECF No.1149); Special Master’s Report and Recommendations on \nPsychiatrist and Psychiatric Social Worker Vacancies, (filed 12/20/2000, ECF No.1227); Special Master’s Report on \nDefendants’ Compliance with Staffing Enhancements for Administrative Segregation, (filed 9/25/2000, ECF No. \n1206); Special Master’s First Quarterly Report on Defendants’ Efforts to Reduce Staffing Vacancies, (filed \n9/26/2001, ECF No.1304); Special Master’s Report on the Defendants’ Compliance with October 26, 2001 and \nDecember 20, 2001 Court Orders, (filed 2/22/2002, ECF No.1350); Special Master’s Second Quarterly Report on \nDefendants’ Efforts to Reduce Staffing Vacancies, (filed 2/26/2002, ECF No.1351); Special Master’s Third \nQuarterly Report on Defendants’ Efforts to Reduce Staffing Vacancies, (filed 7/10/2002, ECF No.1392); Special \nMaster’s Report on Defendants’ Schedule of Differential Pay for Mental Health Clinicians in Specific California \nDepartment of Corrections Institutions, (filed 5/6/2005, ECF No.1661); Special Master’s Report on the Impact of \nDefendants’ Increases in Differential Pay for Mental Health Clinicians in California State Prison, Corcoran, (filed \n2/15/2006, ECF No.1762); Special Master’s Report on the Status and Sufficiency of the Defendants’ Budget \nRequests for Staffing to Implement the Revised Program Guide, (filed 6/21/2006, ECF No.1851); Special Master’s \nSupplemental Report on the Status and Sufficiency of the Departments’ Budget Requests for Staffing to Implement \nthe Revised Program Guide, (filed 7/28/2006, ECF No.1921); Special Master’s Report on Plaintiffs’ Response to the \nSixteenth Report on Compliance Seeking Salary Enhancements for Department of Mental Health Clinicians, (filed \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 87 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 3 of 71\n \nA June 13, 2002 Coleman Court order directed defendants to maintain the vacancy rate \namong psychiatrists and case managers2 at a maximum of ten percent, including the use of \ncontractors.  ECF No. 1383 at 4.  At around the same time, defendants commenced a field study \nto determine the necessary staffing levels required to implement recent Program Guide revisions.  \nHowever, defendants repeatedly failed to fund the full complement of the staffing allocations \nrecommended by the field study.  As a result, the Court ordered defendants to prepare and \npresent a proposal for no less than 530.65 permanent positions and 21.2 limited-term positions to \na special session of the California Legislature in August 2006.  ECF No. 1929 at 3.  The \nlegislature made appropriations for far less positions than proposed and requested that defendants \nconduct a workload study to determine the necessary level of staffing.   \nDefendants engaged outside consultants and the workload study was conducted over the \ncourse of six months in 2007.  The completed study, which recommended 404 positions, was \npresented to defendants in June 2007.  However, defendants did not submit a request to the \nlegislature for those positions until April 2008.  The legislature declined to fund additional \nstaffing allocations until all vacant positions had already been filled.   \nAfter his review of the workload study in July 2008, the Special Master determined that \nalthough the concept and model were appropriate, the data used to calculate the number of \nallocations was faulty.  Soon thereafter the workload study lost its momentum and was \nultimately abandoned.         \n                                                           \n1/30/2007, ECF No.2121); Special Master’s Response to Court’s May 17, 2007 Request for Information, (filed \n5/31/2007, ECF No.2253); Twenty-Sixth Round Monitoring Report of the Special Master on the Defendants’ \nCompliance with Provisionally Approved Plans, Policies, and Protocols, (filed 5/6/16, ECF 5439).       \n \n2 “Case managers” refers collectively to psychologists and social workers, which are now referred to as “primary \nclinicians”. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 88 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 4 of 71\n \nOn June 18, 2009, the Coleman Court ordered defendants to develop another staffing \nplan.  ECF No. 3613 at 2.  As directed by the Court, the Special Master provided guidance and \nassistance in developing a workable plan.  Defendants filed their staffing plan on September 30, \n2009.  ECF No. 3693.  The Special Master endorsed the staffing plan on March 4, 2010.  (See, \nExhibit A attached hereto.) \nIn the April 5, 2013 order denying defendants’ motion to terminate Coleman federal court \noversight, the Court found that, “[c]hronic understaffing continues to hamper the delivery of \nconstitutionally adequate medical care and is a central part of the ongoing constitutional \nviolation in this action.”  ECF No. 4539 at 62.  On March 18, 2014, in an order relating to \nactivation of mental health units at California Health Care Facility, defendants were ordered to \nreview whether the current salary schedule for prison psychiatrists was competitive within \nCalifornia and nationally.  ECF No. 5116 at 12.  In response to that order, defendants reported \nthat their prison psychiatrist salaries were within the range of comparable salaries within \nCalifornia and nationally.  ECF No. 5123 at 3.  Defendants further reported that they had the \nauthority to offer newly-hired psychiatrists salaries in excess of the minimum starting salary.  Id. \nOn June 19, 2014, defendants were ordered to review the 2009 staffing plan, revising it as \nappropriate, in order to achieve compliance with the June 13, 2002 order.  ECF No. 5171 at 4.  \nThe Special Master was to provide guidance and expertise where necessary and ensure that \nplaintiffs were provided notice and an opportunity for input as appropriate.  Id. at 3.  Defendants \nwere ordered to report on the results of their review by September 12, 2014.  Id.   \nAfter receiving an extension of time, defendants filed their “Report on Review of Mental \nHealth Staffing” on February 2, 2015, in which they conceded that the vacancy rate among \npsychiatry positions, including the use of contract staff, was nearly 20 percent.  ECF No. 5269 at \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 89 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 5 of 71\n \n6.  As a remedy for staffing deficits for both psychiatrists and psychologists, defendants \nproposed a four-pronged approach, which included:  \n1.  The creation of a psychiatric medical assistant classification to perform clerical tasks \ncurrently performed by psychiatry staff. \n \n2.  The expansion of their psychologist internship program and reactivation of a fellowship \nprogram for psychiatrists. \n \n3.  Offering differential pay for civil service psychiatrists and increasing contract rates for \ncontract psychiatrists to work in hard to recruit locations. \n \n4.  Continuing the recently expanded telepsychiatry program. \n \nId. at 6-10. \n  On May 18, 2015, defendants were ordered to proceed with the proposals in their report \nand they were required to seek the approval of the Special Master and leave of Court before \nmaking any changes in their existing mental health staffing ratios.  ECF No. 5307 at 6.  The \nSpecial Master was ordered to report to the Court on the status of the implementation of \ndefendants’ proposals within 180 days of the order.  Id.  On November 12, 2015, at his own \nrequest, the Special Master was ordered to include his staffing report and recommendations in \nhis Twenty-Sixth Round Monitoring Report, in lieu of filing a separate report.  ECF No. 5377. \n  Defendants submitted their “CDCR Status Update to Report on Court-Ordered Staffing \nReview,” the first status update to their February 2, 2015 staffing plan proposals, on November \n2, 2015.  Defendants submitted a second status update on February 1, 2016, at which time they \nindicated that additional staffing positions for psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers had \nbeen allocated, but gave no indication as to how many had been hired since their staffing plan \nwas proposed on February 2, 2015. \n  The Special Master filed his Twenty-Sixth Round Monitoring Report on May 6, 2016,  \nfinding that defendants had “demonstrated no sense of the required urgency for a meaningful \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 90 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 6 of 71\n \nimplementation” of the February 2, 2015 revised staffing plan, resulting in little to no change in \nmental health staffing throughout the department.  ECF 5439 at 21.   As a result, he put forth a \nnumber of recommendations, the goal being to facilitate defendants’ timely implementation of \ntheir staffing plan.  Id. at 131.   \nThe Twenty-Sixth Round Monitoring Report included the following table comparing \nstaffing vacancies in 1998 to staffing vacancies in 2015 – a 17-year time span.  Id at 27.  The \ntable further illustrates defendants’ ongoing staffing problems, demonstrating how static the \nvacancy rates for psychiatrists and psychologists have remained over time.    \nPosition  Vacancy Rate 1998*  Vacancy Rate 2015* \nPsychiatrists  35%  32% \nPsychologists  14.8%  15% \nSocial Workers  26%  10% \nRecreational Therapists  12.5%  30% \nPsych Techs  15%  21% \nClerical  11.4%  14% \n* Does not include contract staff. \nOn August 9, 2016, the Court issued an order adopting the Special Master’s Twenty-\nSixth Round Monitoring Report recommendations and including the following orders related \nspecifically to staffing: \n1.  Defendants shall provide the Special Master with monthly updates on their \nimplementation of their staffing plan, which implementation shall be tracked and \nmonitored by the Special Master.  Defendants and the Special Master shall meet and \nconfer monthly to discuss and consider strategies and initiatives, including but not limited \nto potential clustering of higher-acuity mentally ill inmates at those institutions where it \nhas been shown that mental health staff can be more readily attracted and retained, all to \nresolve the continuing problem of mental health staffing in CDCR prisons in a thorough \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 91 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 7 of 71\n \nand lasting way.  The Special Master shall include plaintiffs in these meetings as \nappropriate. \n \n2.  Within one hundred twenty days (120) from the date of this order the Special Master \nshall issue a stand-alone report on the status of mental health staffing and implementation \nof defendants’ staffing plan. \n \nECF No. 5477 at 8-9. \nIn keeping with the recommendations contained in his Twenty-Sixth Round Monitoring \nReport, ECF No. 5439 at 131, and a desire to address outstanding issues from the Twenty-Sixth \nMonitoring Round in a more focused manner than the regular quarterly policy meetings, in June \n2016, the Special Master initiated the meet and confer process, convening the first of a series of \nall-parties workgroup meetings.  In addition to the Special Master and his staff, workgroup \nmeeting participants included, among others, plaintiffs’ counsel, representatives of CDCR \ndefendants and defendants’ counsel.  \n  In meetings held over a period of seven months, the workgroup discussed the status of \nimplementation of the four proposals in defendants’ February 2, 2015 plan.  The workgroup also \ndiscussed a multitude of other proposals, including, cash for on-call compensation for all \nclinicians, dual appointments, psychiatric nurse practitioners, utilization management, \nestablishing a mental health academy for new mental health staff, salary increases for \npsychiatrists and clustering.   \n  During the course of the meet and confer process, it was determined that certain staffing \nproposals were complex and thus required additional time to plan and bring into fruition.  This \nled to a delay in defendants’ submission of their final staffing plan.  As a result, on November \n23, 2016, the Special Master requested a 60-day extension of time to file his report on staffing.  \nECF No. 5523.  On December 9, 2016 the Court granted the Special Master’s request, ordering \nthat his report on staffing be filed on or before February 6, 2017.  ECF No. 5530. \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 92 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 8 of 71\n \nDefendants submitted their updated staffing plan to the Special Master on January 10, \n2017.  (See, Defendants’ January 10, 2017 Updated Staffing Plan, attached hereto as Exhibit B.) \nOn January 25, 2017, plaintiffs submitted their objections to the plan to the Special Master.  \n(See, Plaintiffs’ Objections to Defendants’ January 10, 2017 Staffing Plan, attached hereto as \nExhibit C.) \nWhat follows is the Special Master’s report on the status of mental health staffing and \nimplementation of defendants’ staffing plan. \nDefendants’ January 10, 2017 Updated Staffing Plan  \nDefendants’ January 10, 2017 updated staffing plan contained the four original proposals \nfrom their February 2, 2015 staffing plan, in addition to a number of new proposals that were \nintroduced during the meet and confer process, resulting in a final staffing plan that included the \nfollowing remedial measures:   \n  Use of medical assistants to assist psychiatrists  \n  Internship and Fellowship programs \n  Increased pay rates for contract psychiatrists \n  Telepsychiatry \n  Cash for on-call compensation for all clinicians \n  Dual appointments at additional institutions \n  Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners \n  Utilization Management \n  Proposition 57 \n  Establishment of a Mental Health Academy \n  Salary increases for psychiatrists \n  Bed planning (clustering) \n     \nGenerally, defendants’ staffing plan is promising.  For the reasons set forth below, however, the \nSpecial Master recommends that the defendants’ staffing plan be adopted by the Court in part \nand rejected in part. \nI.  Status of Implementation of February 2, 2015 Staffing Plan Proposals \nA.  Medical Assistants \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 93 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 9 of 71\n \nIn an effort to positively impact psychiatrist recruitment and retention, the use of medical \nassistants was proposed as part of defendants’ four-pronged approach to remedy staffing deficits \nin their February 2, 2015 staffing plan.  Medical assistants perform numerous administrative \ntasks in the support of psychiatrists, including scheduling appointments, sending out physician \norders for labs or medication, reminding inmates of appointments, making referrals to therapists \nand other physicians and meeting with the inmate prior to the appointment and collecting \nrelevant data, among others.    \nDefendants continued to make sufficient progress on their proposal related to the use of \nmedical assistants.3  At the time of defendants’ February 1, 2016, second status update, they \nemployed 37 registry medical assistants at nine institutions.  In their January 10, 2017 updated \nstaffing plan, defendants reported an increase in the number of employed registry medical \nassistants to approximately 70 working at 18 institutions.   \nSince the filing of the Twenty-Sixth Round Monitoring Report, defendants have received \napproval to hire full-time medical assistants.  Defendants reported that the California State \nPersonnel Board approved the establishment of the civil service medical assistant classification \nin August 2016; the civil service exam was under development.  All CDCR institutions will be \nallowed to hire registry medical assistants while the list of eligible candidates is being developed.      \nPlaintiffs granted that the use of medical assistants was a positive approach that over time \nmay lead to an increase in the retention of psychiatrists.4  However, plaintiffs expressed certain \nconcerns about the proposal, including defendants’ failure to provide the results of studies \n                                                           \n3 All references to defendants’ January 10, 2017 Updated Staffing Plan, unless otherwise indicated, are the writer’s \nsummary of what is contained in Exhibit B. \n \n4 All references to plaintiffs’ Objections to Defendants’ January 10, 2017 Staffing Plan, unless otherwise indicated, \nare the writer’s summary of what is contained in Exhibit C. \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 94 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 10 of 71\n \nconducted regarding the position’s efficacy.  Indeed, during the meet and confer process \ndefendants committed to providing the workgroup with written results of psychiatrist surveys \nregarding their experiences with medical assistants.  As of the time of this writing, that \ninformation had not been produced.             \n  The Special Master agrees that the use of medical assistants to work with psychiatrists \nhas the potential to positively impact the recruitment and retention of psychiatrists.  However, \nthe proposal has been in development for almost two years and must be implemented without \nfurther delay.   \nThe Special Master recommends that defendants be directed to continue with the \nimplementation of this proposal and report to the Special Master regarding statewide \nimplementation of the use of civil service medical assistants on a quarterly basis.  The Special \nMaster also recommends that defendants be directed to provide detailed, written results of the \neffect medical assistants have had at the institutions where they are used, including whether \npsychiatrist retention and productivity has improved.   \nDuring the recent meet and confer process, defendants admitted that, at times, medical \nassistants were being pulled away from their psychiatry assignments to work elsewhere.  The \nSpecial Master strongly urges defendants to develop a mechanism to ensure that this practice \ndoes not continue.  The issue will be monitored during the course of his regular monitoring \nvisits.                    \nB.  Internship and Fellowship Programs \nIn an attempt to increase the candidate pool for full-time psychiatrists and psychologists, \ndefendants proposed psychiatrist fellowship and psychology internship programs at several \nCDCR institutions as part of their February 2, 2015 staffing plan.  The fellowship program, \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 95 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 11 of 71\n \nwhich had been re-activated in 2015, employed licensed post-graduate forensic residents to treat \ninmates.  The psychology internship program provided a source of trained clinicians to work for \nCDCR upon completion of their internship.      \nDefendants’ reported that both programs had been effective in recruiting new clinicians. \nHowever, considerably more progress was made with the psychology internship program.  At the \ntime of defendants’ February 1, 2016, second status update, there were two psychiatry fellows at \nSan Quentin State Prison and 21 psychology interns at five institutions.  In their January 10, \n2017 updated staffing plan, defendants reported there were two psychiatry fellows at San \nQuentin State Prison and 31 psychology interns at 11 institutions.  Defendants reported that in \nthe fall of 2016, psychology interns were hired into permanent positions at four institutions, \nhowever, they did not report how many. \nIn their January 10, 2017 updated staffing plan, defendants also reported that they were \nworking to expand the fellowship program as a psychiatry recruitment strategy and had \ncontacted several schools in California and surrounding states that had fellowship programs.  \nAlthough they indicated that some schools had expressed interest in developing a fellowship \nprogram with CDCR, defendants’ report was vague; it did not identify the names or the number \nof schools that were contacted, indicate the status of any negotiations, or provide further \nspecificity.    \nPlaintiffs expressed that both programs were positive, noting however, that the fellowship \nprogram was small, had much less of an impact than the internship program, and that there were \nnot yet any firm plans for its expansion.  As reported above, the fellowship program had not \nexpanded since the February 1, 2016, second status update and remained at two fellows. \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 96 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 12 of 71\n \nThe Special Master agrees that the internship and fellowship programs may continue to \nincrease the candidate pool for full-time psychiatrists and psychologists, and recommends that \ndefendants be directed to proceed with both programs, undertaking efforts to significantly \nincrease the number of psychiatry fellows.  The Special Master also recommends that defendants \nbe directed to maintain and report to the Special Master on a quarterly basis, the number of \nfellows and interns who are hired as civil service employees and track the length of their \nemployment. \nC.  Increased Rates for Contract Psychiatrists \n  Increased rates for contract psychiatrists and differential pay for civil service \npsychiatrists in hard-to-recruit institutions was one of the original four proposals in defendants \nFebruary 2, 2015 staffing plan.  However, as discussed in more detail below, despite consistently \nproviding past status updates regarding their efforts around pursuing differential pay for civil \nservice psychiatrists, defendants left out any specific mention of it in their January 10, 2017 \nupdated staffing plan.  As a result, this section will primarily cover the surviving part of the \nproposal, increased rates for contract psychiatrists.    \nAlthough defendants reported to the Court in 2014 that their psychiatrist salaries were \ncompetitive within California and nationally, (ECF No. 5123 at 3) in their February 2, 2015 \nstaffing plan they nonetheless proposed to increase contract rates for psychiatrists working in \nhard-to-recruit institutions.  In their January 10, 2017 updated staffing plan, defendants reported \nthat during the past 1.5 years they had increased rates for contract psychiatrists at 15 such \ninstitutions.5  At the time of the writing of the Twenty-Sixth Round Monitoring Report, \n                                                           \n5 High Desert State Prison, Pelican Bay State Prison, Avenal State Prison, California State Prison, Corcoran, \nPleasant Valley State Prison, the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility, Kern Valley State Prison, Wasco \nState Prison, North Kern State Prison, Central California Women’s Facility, Valley State Prison, Salinas Valley \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 97 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 13 of 71\n \ndefendants reported increased registry hours for psychiatrists at most institutions due to increased \nregistry pay rates.  ECF No. 5439 at 19.  However, as plaintiffs pointed out in their objections to \ndefendants’ staffing plan, the most recent data available showed a significant fluctuation in \noverall psychiatry registry usage during the six-month time period between June 2016 and \nNovember 2016.6  In view of this and other factors, plaintiffs asserted that a dramatic pay raise \nwas needed to boost recruitment and retention for both registry and staff psychiatrists. \n  The Special Master recommends that defendants be required to provide detailed \ninformation about the timing and the amount of the increase in contractor rates.  The Special \nMaster further recommends that defendants be required to monitor the effect of salary rate \nincreases on the usage of registry hours in order to determine whether further rate increases are \nnecessary to assist in the recruitment and retention of psychiatry registry staff and report to the \nSpecial Master on a quarterly basis.   \n  As stated above, defendants February 2, 2015 staffing plan also contained a proposal for \ndifferential pay for civil service psychiatrists working in hard-to-recruit locations.  In their \nNovember 2, 2015 staffing plan update, defendants reported that the proposal was being \nreviewed “as part of a statewide, multi-departmental initiative” and requested to provide the \nSpecial Master with a further update on January 31, 2016.  At the time of their February 1, 2016 \nsecond status update, defendants reported that they were working on providing pay differentials \nto psychiatrists hired at High Desert State Prison, Pelican Bay State Prison, Pleasant Valley State \nPrison, Avenal State Prison, California State Prison, Corcoran and the California Substance \n                                                           \nState Prison, California Treatment Facility [sic], California Correctional Institute [sic] and California State Prison, \nLancaster [sic] \n \n6 Source:  CDCR Secure Website for Monthly Reports, covering the period of November 2016.   \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 98 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 14 of 71\n \nAbuse Treatment Facility.  Defendants further reported that, “if the pay differential proposal is \napproved, it will be part of the 2016/2017 California State budget for legislative approval.” \n  By the time the meet and confer process began in June 2016, defendants’ position had \nchanged.  In a June 1, 2016 third status update submitted to the workgroup for discussion, \ndefendants reported that the pay differential would be handled through the collective bargaining \nprocess and provided no further details.  As stated above, the January 10, 2017 updated staffing \nplan dropped any specific mention of pursuing pay differentials.  The proposal was not included \nin a discussion of the original four Court-approved proposals from the February 2, 2015 staffing \nplan as it had been in all previous staffing plan updates.  Instead, defendants included a section in \nthe plan titled, “Salary Increases for Psychiatrists” and reported on the issue in the vaguest of \nterms, a complete reversal from their prior positions and commitments to the Court regarding the \npursuit of pay differentials for psychiatrists.  This detour from their previous Court-approved \napproach rendered defendants’ proposal incomplete, in addition to proving terribly confusing.  \nThe “Salary Increases for Psychiatrists” section is covered below under item II G.    \nD.  Telepsychiatry \nThe inability to hire and retain on-site psychiatrists has plagued CDCR for the last 19 \nyears and defendants have been unable to remedy this chronic problem.  Unless and until \ndefendants can increase the rate of recruitment and retention of on-site psychiatrists and reduce \nthe vacancy rate to ten percent or less, all options must be explored without sacrificing the ability \nto provide adequate psychiatric treatment to inmates participating in the MHSDS. \nThe use of telepsychiatry was first proposed nearly two decades ago as a method of \nproviding mental health treatment to CDCR inmates and was already in use in 12 facilities by \nOctober 1999.  ECF No. 974 at 3.   \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 99 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 15 of 71\n \nThe Statewide Telepsychiatry Program was one of the four original prongs in defendants’ \napproach to reduce staffing vacancies, and employed 28 staff psychiatrists working out of three \noffices at the time of defendants’ submission of their “Report on Review of Mental Health \nStaffing” on February 2, 2015.  By January 2017, the telepsychiatry staff had grown to 48 \nproviding services to 18 institutions with an intended expansion to 100 working in three \nlocations, Elk Grove, San Quentin and Rancho Cucamonga.  However, in order to accommodate \nthis expanding program, additional office space is required which will not be fully completed \nuntil 2018. \nPlaintiffs disagree with the apparent proposed use of telepsychiatry at all levels of care \nwith no limitations or parameters.  Plaintiffs also object to anything but a temporary use of \ntelepsychiatry in an MHCB setting, and a limited use of it for EOP level of care inmates.  They \nassert that it should be used as a supplemental measure in addition to on-site psychiatrists, as \nplaintiffs fear that psychiatrists are merely moving from institutions to call centers, further \ndepleting the existing shortage of on-site psychiatrists.  Finally, plaintiffs believe that this \nremedy will take too long to implement at a time when relief is needed immediately.  \n    Defendants indicated that their preference was to use on-site psychiatrists whenever \npossible rather than telepsychiatrists – a view shared by the Special Master’s experts.  Although \nthe Special Master’s experts have determined that telepsychiatry is a viable method for the \ndelivery of mental health services, this does not come without admonitions and parameters.  \n  Telepsychiatry should serve as a supplement for on-site psychiatry, not as a substitute and \nshould only be utilized when institutions are unable to recruit psychiatrists to work on-site.  In no \ncircumstances should this method of delivering mental health treatment relieve CDCR of their \nobligation to continue their efforts of recruiting full-time psychiatrists to work on-site at the \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 100 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 16 of 71\n \nfacilities.  The convenience of telepsychiatry should also not serve as a reason to allow on-site \npsychiatrists to migrate to the comfort of remote off-site offices.  It cannot be emphasized \nenough that telepsychiatry should not replace on-site psychiatry, a concern shared by plaintiffs’ \ncounsel.  An example of such a problem would be to allow the use of telepsychiatry at the \nCalifornia Institution for Women and the California Institution for Men by psychiatrists working \nout of the Rancho Cucamonga offices.  The proximity of those two facilities to the Rancho \nCucamonga offices voids any reason for not providing on-site psychiatrists and would undermine \nthe very purpose of the telepsychiatry program.  Similar arguments can be made regarding the \nuse of telepsychiatry at Mule Creek State Prison and the California Health Care Facility given \ntheir proximity to Elk Grove, a point plaintiffs raised in their objections to defendants’ January \n10, 2017 updated staffing plan.    \n  Telepsychiatry is not clinically desirable as a frontline approach to providing psychiatric \nservices for inmates with the most intensive or emergent needs.  The higher the acuity of mental \nillness, the less telepsychiatry should be relied on as a permissible method of treatment.  For \n3CMS level of care inmates, it is an appropriate option with the requirement that the \ntelepsychiatrist work on-site at least twice per year at the designated institutions and more \nfrequently if feasible.  Although the efficacy of telepsychiatry for EOP inmates is not clear or \nrecommended as a permanent solution at this time, it would be recommended that a psychiatrist \nbe on-site at least quarterly to treat EOP inmates, given the frequency of psychiatric contacts \nrequired by the Program Guide.  The Special Master’s experts observed EOP inmates receiving \ntreatment using telepsychiatry and it appeared to function properly, but additional data would \nneed to be examined before further expansion for EOP inmates could be endorsed.   The use of \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 101 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 17 of 71\n \ntelepsychiatry for inmates at the EOP level of care will be monitored by the Special Master \nduring his regular monitoring visits, or more frequently if necessary.   \n  For inmates at the MHCB level of care, telepsychiatry is not an appropriate method of \ntreatment to be used on a regular basis.  Telepsychiatry for these higher acuity inmates should \nonly be used as a last resort or in emergency situations when an on-site psychiatrist is not \navailable.  On-site psychiatrists are able to more positively impact the therapeutic milieu by \nregularly interacting with correctional, nursing and other mental health staff.  This is just not \npossible with telepsychiatrists.  In addition, on-site psychiatrists are better able to discern \nnonverbal behavior demonstrated by inmates which often has an important impact on diagnoses \nand treatment planning.  The ease of multidisciplinary interaction on-site is especially important \nin regards to emergency consultation, which is essential at the higher levels of care and much \nbetter accomplished with on-site psychiatrists.     \n  The Special Master recommends the continued expansion of the telepsychiatry program \nwith the caveats expressed above.  The Special Master further recommends that defendants be \nrequired to report their progress to the Special Master on a quarterly basis. \nII.  Defendants’ New Staffing Plan Proposals  \nA.  Cash for On-Call Compensation for all Clinicians \nCDCR has modified the method of compensation for those clinicians who remain “on-\ncall,” including psychiatrists.  Clinicians were previously compensated for on-call time with \nleave credit, or additional time off.  Defendants now compensate on-call clinicians with cash \npayments which should serve as a more attractive incentive for psychiatrists to work additional \non-call times with the expectation of improving retention.  This change was made as a result of \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 102 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 18 of 71\n \nstaff feedback.  Plaintiffs had no objection to this proposal, but did not believe that it would have \nmuch of an impact.   \nTime will tell if plaintiffs are correct, but defendants are nevertheless encouraged to \ncontinue with this element of their plan, and report their progress to the Special Master on a \nquarterly basis. \nB.  Dual Appointments at Additional Institutions \nCDCR had a policy in place at three institutions allowing staff psychiatrists to accept a \nsecond position at a different institution on a quarter time (.25) basis, on weekends or their \nregular day off.  As a measure to increase psychiatry fill rates, defendants expanded the use of \nthese dual appointments statewide.  Plaintiffs expressed concerns that working additional days \nwould cause full-time psychiatrists to be less efficient and possibly less effective as clinicians.   \nAs dual appointments were limited to a quarter time (.25) basis, at this stage it is unclear \nwhether there is cause for concern regarding a potential for decline in clinical efficiency and \neffectiveness.   \nThe Special Master recommends that defendants be encouraged to continue forward with \nthis proposal, reporting to the Special Master on a quarterly basis regarding its effectiveness in \ndecreasing vacancy rates and its impact on staff retention.             \nC.  Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners \nDefendants proposed to recruit psychiatric or mental health nurse practitioners to provide \npsychotropic medication management to 3CMS inmates in place of psychiatrists.  A civil service \nnurse practitioner classification already existed.  In their January 10, 2017 updated staffing plan, \ndefendants reported that they were currently developing a recruitment plan with the goal of \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 103 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 19 of 71\n \nbeginning nurse practitioner hiring in early 2017.  Nurse practitioners would be supervised by \nthe institution’s chief psychiatrist or senior psychiatrist supervisor.    \n  Plaintiffs agreed that the use of psychiatric nurse practitioners was potentially very \nhelpful.  However, plaintiffs expressed concern that discussions during the meet and confer \nprocess revealed that there were a limited number of trained and licensed psychiatric nurse \npractitioners in California.   \nThe Special Master agrees that the use of psychiatric nurse practitioners could positively \nimpact mental health treatment.  The Special Master recommends that defendants be directed to \ncontinue with their proposal to recruit and hire psychiatric nurse practitioners and report their \nprogress to the Special Master on a quarterly basis. \nD.  Utilization Management \nDuring the recent meet and confer process, defendants admitted that utilization \nmanagement was not something they had done well.  CDCR’s proposed implementation of \nutilization management to address staffing shortages is designed to reduce the mental health \npopulation and in turn reduce caseloads for clinicians so they can service those inmates who \nmeet criteria for inclusion in the MHSDS. \nIn a workgroup meeting, the Special Master and plaintiffs raised the concept of reducing \nthe 3CMS population through criteria currently existing in the Program Guide which could \npossibly result in reduced staffing ratios.  Defendants were reminded that objective standards \nwere contained in the Program Guide allowing them to identify a subset of 3CMS inmates to be \nreviewed for possible discharge from the 3CMS program.  Specifically, the Program Guide states \nthat inmates may be clinically discharged from the 3CMS program if they have been in \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 104 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 20 of 71\n \ncontinuous remission and are functioning adequately in the mainline program without treatment, \nincluding medication, for six months.  MHSDS Program Guide, 2009 Revision, pg. 12-3-13.   \nFollowing those discussions, on November 15, 2016, defendants issued a statewide \nmemo to the chiefs of mental health directing them to review inmates at the 3CMS level of care \nto determine if discharge from the 3CMS program was warranted.  This memo was reviewed by \nthe Special Master, his team of experts and plaintiffs and there were no objections to its adoption \nand implementation.     \nDefendants have identified approximately 5,000 inmates statewide at the 3CMS level of \ncare who meet objective criteria for possible discharge from the program.  Although a 3CMS \ninmate may meet objective criteria for review for possible discharge, a clinician may still \ndetermine that the inmate should be retained in the mental health program based on a clinical \nreview and the need for ongoing therapy.  As previously stated, the desired outcome of this \nprocess is to remove inmates from the program who no longer meet the standards for inclusion in \nthe 3CMS program, thereby reducing the 3CMS population with a concomitant reduction in \ncaseloads for clinicians.  Defendants will be conducting these reviews quarterly.   \nIt is unclear how much of an impact this measure will have on staffing resources.  \nHowever, the Special Master recommends that defendants be encouraged to continue in their \nefforts and report any results to the Special Master and plaintiffs on a quarterly basis.   \nDefendants have recently proposed a similar approach in regards to the EOP population.  \nHowever, the manner in which the preliminary concept is presented in defendants’ January 10, \n2017 updated staffing plan gives the impression that it has been endorsed by the workgroup.  In \nactuality, during the recent meet and confer process defendants provided the workgroup with a \nmemo for review and comment.  During a discussion of the memo, a myriad of concerns were \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 105 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 21 of 71\n \nraised by plaintiffs and the Special Master’s experts, which are codified in plaintiffs’ objections, \ndiscussed below.  Central to those concerns was that the memo would lead to a wholesale \nremoval of inmates from the EOP program, as the underlying implication of the memo seemed to \nbe that clinicians should seek to remove EOP inmates from their caseloads.     \nUnlike with the 3CMS level of care, there are no objective criteria codified in the \nProgram Guide to trigger an automatic review of EOP inmates for potential discharge from the \nEOP program.  Since there is no objectively defined subset of the EOP population that can be \nidentified as warranting a review for possible discharge from the EOP program, this leaves \nclinicians with no alternative but to review every EOP inmate.  The concern then, turns to how to \ndeliver the message to clinicians in order to avoid any interpretation of the memo as a mandate to \nreduce the EOP population.  Defendants have previously stated that an informal review yielded \nno results of inmates being inappropriately placed at the EOP level of care.  It would be more \nproductive for defendants to select an institution with a high EOP population to determine if this \ntype of review produces any measurable results or select another methodology to review a \nsample of the EOP population.   \nIn their objections to defendants’ January 10, 2017 updated staffing plan, plaintiffs state \nthat there is no evidence that defendants are currently providing unnecessary treatment to \ninmates at the EOP level of care.  Plaintiffs provide examples of various targeted methods to \ndetermine if EOP inmates are clinically appropriate to remain at the EOP level of care without \nthe necessity of evaluating every EOP inmate system-wide.   \nThe Special Master shares in plaintiffs’ concerns and believes that different \nmethodologies are available to evaluate the proper or improper retention of inmates at the EOP \nlevel of care.  Until such time as more information has been provided and the parties have had \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 106 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 22 of 71\n \nthe opportunity to thoroughly vet the memo, it is the recommendation of the Special Master that \nthis provision of defendants’ plan be rejected at this time and that the parties be ordered to meet \nand confer to fully explore all options to ensure that all EOP inmates are being treated at the \nappropriate level of care. \nE.  Proposition 57 \nThe Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016, or Proposition 57, was passed by the \nCalifornia voters on November 8, 2016 and created certain parole and earned credit changes for \nCDCR inmates.  In their January 10, 2017 updated staffing plan, defendants advanced \nProposition 57 as a remedial measure which they anticipated would reduce the prison population \noverall, thereby reducing the MHSDS population and resulting in a parallel reduction in staff.  \nWhile the regulations for the measure are not expected to be implemented until October 1, 2017, \ndefendants have reported that they expect a reduction of the total inmate population by 1,959 in \n2017-18.  They did not, however, offer any projection for a reduction in the MHSDS population.     \nCurrently, in addition to the staffing crisis, CDCR is in the midst of a population crisis.  \nThe MHSDS population ballooned at the same time that the overall total prison population has \ndramatically decreased.  To illustrate, in June 2008, at the height of CDCR’s population crisis, \nthe total MHSDS population was 34,035.7  As of November 2016, the total MHSDS population \nwas 36,645, an increase of almost eight percent.8  Simultaneously, in June 2008, the overall total \ninmate population was 159,488.9  As of November 2016, the population had decreased to \n117,306, or 26 percent.10  As these figures demonstrate, the MHSDS census numbers continue to \n                                                           \n7 Source:  CDCR Secure Website for Monthly Reports, covering the period of June 2008. \n8 Source:  CDCR Secure Website for Monthly Reports, covering the period of November 2016. \n9 Source:  CDCR Website, Population Reports, Weekly Archives as of midnight June 18, 2008.  This number only \nincludes inmates housed in the institutions and camps. \n10 Source:  CDCR Website, Population Reports, Weekly Archives as of midnight, November 2, 2016.  This number \nonly includes inmates housed in the institutions and camps. \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 107 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 23 of 71\n \nrise and unless the population drops precipitously this trend will have a distinct impact on \nstaffing, exacerbating yet another crisis. \nWhile defendants should be applauded for their efforts in this regard, it is much too soon \nto know what the effects of Proposition 57 will be, if any, on reducing the MHSDS population \nand leading to decreased staffing needs.  Considering this, and that the implementation of \nProposition 57 is so far in the future, any reliance on future projections at this stage, would be \npremature.   \nF.  Mental Health Academy \nIn an effort to impact staff retention, defendants proposed to develop a Mental Health \nAcademy orientation program for new mental health staff.  Defendants reported that the \nprogram’s objective was to provide “a uniform approach on policies, procedures and \nexpectations when staff is first hired.”  Defendants indicated that they anticipated the program \nwould have a positive impact on staff retention, but provided few additional details regarding the \nproposal.  The program was reported to be in the early stages of development, with no date set \nfor implementation.  Plaintiffs offered no objections to this proposal.  \nAny program that could potentially result in mental health staff retention should be \nencouraged.  At this level of crisis in staffing, all positive efforts advanced by defendants to aid \nin solving the chronic problem of staffing vacancies should be encouraged.   \nGranted, the proposal is in the very early stages of development, making it too soon to \nconsider its potential outcome.  Nonetheless, the Special Master recommends that defendants be \ndirected to move forward, updating the Special Master as to their progress on this proposal on a \nquarterly basis. \nG. Salary Increases for Psychiatrists \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 108 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 24 of 71\n \nAs reported above, although in 2014 defendants represented to the Court that CDCR \npsychiatrist salaries were competitive within California and nationally, they still subsequently \nproposed and then undertook efforts to increase both registry and civil service psychiatrist \nsalaries at hard-to-recruit institutions.  In doing so, defendants effectively admitted through their \nactions that psychiatrist salaries were actually not competitive enough to impact the recruitment \nof psychiatrists to work at CDCR institutions.  Offering differential pay for civil service \npsychiatrists (and increasing contract rates for contract psychiatrists) to work in hard-to-recruit \nlocations was one of the original four proposals from defendants’ February 2, 2015 staffing plan.       \nThroughout the recent meet and confer process, defendants repeatedly asserted that the \nissue of salary increases was being addressed through the collective bargaining process and they \ncould provide no further information on the subject.  Through this repeated assertion, defendants \nimplied that the mere act of engaging in the collective bargaining process satisfied their Court-\nordered directive to consider salary increases as a measure to recruit and retain psychiatry staff.  \nIndeed, the section on this issue in defendants’ January 10, 2017 updated staffing plan read: \nThis Court has also directed that CDCR consider increasing the salaries of the \npsychiatry staff to make the work in its institutions more attractive.  CDCR agrees \nthat it should examine salaries and its fulfilling this directive by engaging in the \ncollective bargaining process with the union representing the psychiatrists.  The \nnegotiations between the union representing psychiatrists and the state of California \nare ongoing.  As bargaining processes are fluid and confidential,11 CDCR cannot \nprovide an estimated end date or disclose the substance of the negotiations, but is \noptimistic about a positive bargaining outcome with psychiatrists.  See, Exhibit B \nat 5.   \n                                                           \n11 A footnote to defendants’ plan read:  “Before contract negotiations begin between the state and a union, a formal \nunderstanding about the bargaining process is reached. This includes a provision to not speak publicly about \nproposals at the bargaining table, including those involving salary increases. A violation of this agreement could \nresult in unfair practices charges brought before the Public Employees Relations Board. The Legislature has \nrecognized the confidentiality of the bargaining process by exempting it from the Public Records Act. (See Cal. \nGov. Code, § 6254(p).) CDCR also is mindful that if one party violates the terms of confidentiality, it will chill the \nbargaining process.”  See, Exhibit B at 5.    \n \nBecause the details of the ongoing collective bargaining negotiations are confidential, it is impossible for the Special \nMaster to know if the outcome would have a positive effect on the staffing crisis. \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 109 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 25 of 71\n \n \nThis portion of defendants’ staffing plan is unacceptable.  It does not provide any \nadditional details and does not fulfill the Court’s stated directive that defendants present more \nthan a “mere plan” and “demonstrate clear action in accordance with planned steps and a \nmeasurable timeline by which those steps will be completed.”  ECF No. 5477 at 6.  Further, the \ncollective bargaining process may not keep pace with salary increases that could occur in the \nregion in years to come.  It may be necessary to put a consistent benchmark in place that would \nlead to regular salary increases. \nAlternatively, it may be time for defendants to offer a salary survey for the Court to adopt \nas they did in 2006.  In 2006, CDCR provided the Special Master with a proposed schedule of \npay for CDCR mental health clinicians.  ECF No. 2081-11 at 11-14.  In essence, the proposed \nschedule of pay was a salary survey, which was adopted by the Court on December 14, 2006.  \nECF No. 2083.  It may be time for CDCR to develop another salary survey that the Court can \nconsider for adoption. \n  Taking into account defendants’ longstanding elevated psychiatry vacancy rates, as well \nas their past self-reported and subsequently Court-ordered efforts to increase psychiatry salaries, \nit is not reasonable that they would take their current position and decline to provide any \ninformation during the meet and confer process, or in their January 10, 2017 updated staffing \nplan regarding possible plans to increase salaries.   \nIn their objections to defendants’ January 10, 2017 updated staffing plan, plaintiffs \nindicated that defendants’ failure to raise psychiatrist salaries in any significant way was \nresponsible for their inability to recruit psychiatry staff.  To illustrate the urgency required in \naddressing the issue, plaintiffs offered that in the two-year time period between November 2014 \nand November 2016, the EOP population grew 23 percent, while the number of psychiatrists \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 110 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 26 of 71\n \nworking for CDCR grew less than three percent.  This resulted in an increase in the number of \nEOP inmates per psychiatrist from 29.6 to 42.2 during this time period.  Plaintiffs expressed \nstrong objections to defendants’ position that they could not provide any information regarding \nplans to increase salaries or studies about pay because the issue was part of the collective \nbargaining process. \nFor the aforementioned reasons, defendants’ preliminary report regarding salary increases \nfor psychiatrists is woefully incomplete.  The Special Master recommends that within 90 days, \ndefendants be directed to inform the Special Master “of the results of final collective bargaining \nagreements with all categories of mental health and medical staff that impact the delivery of \nmental health services, with a focus on any changes in existing terms of collective bargaining \nagreements that may enhance or impede future recruitments in each category,” as required by the \nColeman Court’s June 13, 2002 order.  ECF No. 1383 at 4.  If the collective bargaining process \nremains ongoing, defendants should be required to develop a benchmark that can be adopted by \nthe Court, or in the alternative, develop a salary survey for the Court to consider.   \nH. Bed Planning (Clustering) \nIn its August 9, 2016 order, the Court directed defendants to meet and confer with the \nSpecial Master regarding, among other things, clustering higher-acuity mentally ill inmates at \ninstitutions that are more readily able to recruit and retain mental health staff as a part of a plan \nto resolve the longstanding staffing issues facing CDCR.  ECF No. 5477 at 8-9.   \n  In response to the Court’s order, defendants submitted a plan that has expanded or will \nexpand the number of EOP beds at existing institutions with EOP programs except one, Pelican \nBay State Prison, which was closed to EOP inmates because it was at a hard to recruit location.  \n  Defendants’ interconnected rationale for its clustering plan as presented are: (1) \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 111 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 27 of 71\n \n“overfilling an institution with the most acute patients can have a negative impact on the staff \nand mental health delivery program” and (2) there is a serious risk of staff fatigue posed by “an \noverload of difficult cases” at institutions due to “over clustering.” Defendants described their \nbed plan as a “careful compromise between absolute clustering and decentralized services.”  See, \nExhibit B at 7.   \n  Plaintiffs objected to the clustering plan characterizing it as “far too limited in scope and \nthe clustering is at the wrong locations.”  See, Exhibit C at 7.  Plaintiffs pointed out that while \nclosing a small EOP program at Pelican Bay State Prison, defendants’ bed expansion plan \neffectively creates large clustering of EOP beds at several institutions that are already difficult to \nstaff, and the plan will only result in worsening the current staffing problems.  \n  The Special Master agrees that the EOP bed expansion plan as currently designed does \nnot address the core of the Court’s order regarding clustering, which is to consider placing \n“higher-acuity mentally ill inmates at those institutions where it has been shown that mental \nhealth staff can be more readily attracted and retained.”  ECF No. 5477 at 8.  True clustering, for \nexample, would be closing a hard-to-recruit institution such as High Desert State Prison to \nintake, and placing those MHSDS inmates in an institution that has the ability to recruit and \nretain mental health staff.  At its core, all defendants’ plan does is dramatically expand EOP beds \nat a number of institutions that defendants themselves described as hard-to-recruit institutions in \ntheir February 2, 2015 staffing plan, particularly in psychiatry, which was discussed earlier.  For \nexample, the vacancy rates in November 2016 for both on-site and telepsychiatry for Kern \nValley State Prison, California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility, California State Prison/Los \nAngeles County, and California State Prison, Corcoran were 54 percent, 46 percent, 47 percent, \n27 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 112 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 28 of 71\n \nand 33 percent respectively.12  The EOP clustering plan offered by defendants is inadequate; it \ndoes not resolve the issue of recruiting and retaining staff in its current iteration. \n  The Special Master recommends that defendants be directed to develop a true clustering \nplan within 90 days that expressly demonstrates how defendants propose to recruit and retain \nmental health staff at each designated cluster institution in order to resolve the long-standing \nstaffing problems in CDCR.  The plan should be developed under the guidance and assistance of \nthe Special Master with input from the plaintiffs as appropriate.    \nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n  As it applies to staffing, CDCR has historically undertaken a piecemeal approach.  As a \nresult, their efforts are never sufficient or long-lasting.  The Court was clear in articulating what \nwas expected of defendants in terms of their staffing plan.  While the Special Master believes \nthat defendants have put forth a strong effort, as stated above, there are certain elements of \ndefendants’ updated staffing plan that are lacking in details or otherwise deficient, and thus \ncannot be adopted.  However, that does not preclude the adoption of the remaining elements of \nthe plan.   \n  In view of all the foregoing, the Special Master recommends: \n  That the Court enter an order directing defendants to proceed with the implementation of \ntheir staffing plan proposals related to medical assistants, internship and fellowship \nprograms, increased rates for contract psychiatrists, telepsychiatry, cash for on-call \ncompensation, dual appointments, psychiatric nurse practitioners, utilization management \nrelating to 3CMS inmates, Proposition 57, and the Mental Health Academy, which \nincludes the above recommendations; \n \n  That the Court reject defendants’ staffing plan proposals on utilization management \nrelated to EOP inmates, salary increases for psychiatrists, and clustering, and that the \nCourt enter an order that defendants be required to develop a supplemental plan to \naddress those areas, which includes the above recommendations; \n \n                                                           \n12 Source:  CDCR Secure Website for Monthly Reports, covering the period of November 2016. \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 113 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 29 of 71\n \n  That the Court enter an order directing the defendants and the Special Master to meet and \nconfer every 90 days until the staffing plan is fully implemented, including plaintiffs as \nappropriate, to discuss the status of defendants’ implementation of the adopted staffing \nplan proposals as outlined in the recommendations above. \n \n \nRespectfully Submitted \n                /s/ \n                       \n              Matthew A.

With respect to \nstaffing, the Court stated it “can no longer sanction the continued pursuit of remedial strategies \nthat have not worked in the past.”  (8/9/16 Order at 6.)  It urged the parties to “devise a \nmeaningful strategy that will, finally, mean mentally ill inmates are located in institutions that \nare adequately staffed with mental health staff competent to meet their treatment needs.”  (Id.)  \nConsistent with the Court’s order, CDCR met internally, with the Special Master team, and with \nthe plaintiffs to discuss and develop a revised staffing plan.   \n \nThe following plan is the product of those discussions, and builds on the prior court-approved \nstaffing proposal submitted in February 2015.  The revised staffing plan incorporates all of the \nefforts outlined in the February 2015 plan including: establishing and fully utilizing the Medical \nAssistant classification (approved August 11, 2016) to aid psychiatrists, enhancing an internship \nprogram for psychologists and fellowship program for psychiatrists at several CDCR institutions \nto increase the pool of candidates for full time employment, increasing salary rates in hard to \nrecruit  locations  to  attract  registry  psychiatrists,  and  expanding  the  use  of  the  statewide \ntelepsychiatry program.  CDCR’s current plan includes negotiated proposals to modify the “on-\ncall” compensation package for clinicians, increase the use of dual appointments, hire psychiatric \nnurse practitioners to provide psychiatric services, improve utilization management, and develop \na mental health academy for new employees.  CDCR continues to explore all viable options that \nwill help the Department deliver the best mental healthcare possible to its patient population. The \nDepartment looks forward to ongoing discussions surrounding staffing.    \nCurrent Staffing Level: \n \nSince 2016, CDCR’s fill rate for psychologists and social workers meets and, in most cases, \nexceeds  90%.    The  rates  for  filled  positions,  including  registry,  are  as  follows:    92%  for \npsychologists  (approximately  5%  filled  by  registry);  73%  for  psychiatrists,  including \ntelepsychiatrists  (approximately  14%  filled  by  registry);  and  99%  for  social  workers \n(approximately 6% filled by registry).   \nStatus of Court Approved Initiatives in CDCR’s 2015 Plan: \n1.  Medical Assistants \n \nCDCR currently employs approximately 70 registry medical assistants at 18 institutions to assist \npsychiatrists  and  telepsychiatrists.    In  August  2016,  the  California  State  Personnel  Board \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 124 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 40 of 71\napproved the establishment of the medical assistant civil service classification, and the State is \ndeveloping the civil service exam.  While the list of eligible candidates is being developed, \nCDCR will allow all institutions to hire registry medical assistants.   \nHiring  medical  assistants  to  work  with  psychiatrists  will  positively  impact  recruitment  and \nretention of psychiatrists.  Medical assistants provide myriad services, including clerical tasks, \nnow handled by psychiatrists within CDCR.  Medical assistants remind patients of appointments, \nsend out physician orders for labs or medication, schedule new appointments, make referrals to \ntherapists and other physicians, meet with the patient prior to the appointment, collect relevant \ndata, and take blood pressures and measure weights.  In addition, medical assistants help find \ntreatment rooms to meet patients and schedule with correctional staff to bring a patient to the \npsychiatrist.  CDCR hopes that the addition of this resource will improve a psychiatrist’s work \nenvironment, free up clinical time that can be divided between spending more time with each \npatient and seeing more patients in a day, and create a clinic-like environment that is more \nfamiliar to medical staff in the community.  Once this proposal is implemented, it may be \nnecessary to review and, if appropriate, modify the ratios in the 2009 staffing plan.   \n  2. Internship and Fellowship Programs \n \nAmong the initiatives that CDCR uses to help recruit and retain clinicians are the psychologist \ninternship and psychiatrist fellowship programs.  Both programs have been effective at recruiting \nnew clinicians to work within the correctional setting.   \nCDCR expanded its internship program for the 2016/2017 school year and currently employs 31 \ninterns at 11 institutions – four at the California Institution for Men, two at California State \nPrison, Sacramento, seven at R.J. Donovan, four at San Quentin State Prison, three at Valley \nState Prison, two at Central California Women’s Facility, two at California Healthcare Facility, \ntwo  at  California  Men’s  Colony,  two  at  California  State  Prison,  Solano,  one  at  California \nMedical Facility, and two at California Institution for Women.   \nInterns in the program are given an opportunity to work in a variety of clinical and custodial \nsettings in order to become familiar with the unique characteristics of working in a correctional \nsetting.  The program also allows interns to develop both general clinical skills and a distinct set \nof  assessment  and intervention skills tailored to a correctional environment.  The program \nprovides a steady source of well-trained, competent clinicians who, following completion of their \ninternship, continue to work in locations that experience chronic difficulties hiring psychologists.  \nFor instance, in the fall of 2016, CDCR hired interns into permanent positions at California State \nPrison, Los Angeles, Wasco State Prison, California State Prison, Sacramento, and Valley State \nPrison.    The  program  also  enhances  CDCR’s  reputation  among  potential  clinicians  in  the \ncommunity and provides professional enrichment for licensed clinicians who train and supervise \nthe interns, which should improve CDCR’s retention of psychologists.   \nIn 2015, CDCR re-activated its fellowship program for psychiatry and currently has two fellows \nat  San  Quentin  State  Prison.    CDCR’s  fellowship  program  employs  licensed  post-graduate \nforensic residents to treat inmates while also learning the concepts and practices of forensic \npsychiatry within a prison setting.  CDCR is now working to expand the fellowship program as a \nrecruitment strategy for psychiatry.  To that end, CDCR has contacted a number of schools in \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 125 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 41 of 71\nCalifornia and surrounding states, listed by the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical \nEducation, that have fellowship programs.  Some of these schools have expressed interest in \ndeveloping a formal fellowship program with CDCR. CDCR is following with those schools that \nhave shown interest.   \n  3. Increased Rates for Contract Psychiatrists \nOver  the  past  year  and  a  half,  CDCR  has  amended  its  registry  contract  to  increase  the \npsychiatrist-contractor rate at the following institutions:  High Desert State Prison, Pelican Bay \nState  Prison,  Avenal  State  Prison,  California  State  Prison,  Corcoran,  Pleasant  Valley  State \nPrison, the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility, Kern Valley State Prison, Wasco \nState Prison,  North Kern State Prison, Central California Women’s Facility, Valley State Prison, \nSalinas Valley State Prison, California Treatment Facility, California Correctional Institute, and \nCalifornia State Prison, Lancaster.  \nIn addition to increasing the rates at hard to recruit locations, leadership in headquarters are now \nproviding more direct oversight of the contractor recruitment and hiring.  CDCR will continue to \nmonitor this recruitment effort.  \n4.  Telepsychiatry \n \nTelepsychiatry is a proven method for delivering services to the mentally ill.  Consistent with \nprior  agreements  with  the  Coleman  Special  Master  team  and  Coleman  plaintiffs’  counsel, \ntelepsychiatrists receive the same training as staff psychiatrists, visit their assigned institution at \nleast twice per year, participate in mental health team meetings, and participate in patients’ \ntreatment team meetings.  Telepsychiatry services are provided to inmates in a confidential, out \nof cell setting.  Telepsychiatrists currently serve 18 institutions, and CDCR intends to expand the \nuse of telepsychiatry throughout the system.   \n \nThe program has been helpful to respond to vacancies in hard to recruit areas.  Telepsychiatry \nhas also proven to be a useful way to retain staff psychiatrists.  Taken altogether, these benefits \nsupport the expansion and further reliance on telepsychiatry.  To that end, CDCR intends to \nexpand  its  telepsychiatry  team  to  at  least  100  telepsychiatrists.    Currently,  CDCR  has \ntelepsychiatry offices in Elk Grove, San Quentin, and Rancho Cucamonga, California to provide \nservices to the institutions. As of January 9, 2017, CDCR employ 48 telepsychiatry staff which \nincludes 45 staff telepsychiatrists, two Senior Psychiatrist Supervisors, and a chief psychiatrist.  \nFive additional telepsychiatrists have tentative start dates within the next six months and several \nothers are in different stages of the hiring process.   \n \nIn order to facilitate the expansion of the telepsychiatry team, CDCR plans to add telepsychiatry \nspace in Rancho Cucamonga in Spring 2017 and at San Quentin State Prison in late 2018.  \nBecause  of  the  number  of  telepsychiatry  applicants,  CDCR  is  working  toward  acquiring \nadditional space in easy to recruit areas.  As with other prison systems across the country, \nCDCR’s telepsychiatry program is a critical and successful component of its staffing plan.   \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 126 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 42 of 71\nAdditional Proposals to Augment Already Approved 2015 Initiatives: \n \n1.  On-Call Compensation for all Clinicians \n \nIn response to feedback from staff, and to retain clinicians, CDCR has modified its compensation \npackage for clinicians who remain “on-call.”  CDCR previously compensated on-call clinicians \nwith leave credit.  CDCR has revised its policy and now compensates clinicians with cash, a \nmodification CDCR believes will help retain psychiatry staff.  \n \n2. Additional Appointments \nTo increase psychiatry position fill rates, CDCR has authorized staff psychiatrists to accept a \nsecond psychiatric staff position at a different institution on a quarter time basis.  This will allow \npsychiatrists to earn more and help fill vacant positions.  Though this program was in place at \nthree institutions, a statewide advertisement was recently released.  CDCR will monitor whether \nthis is effective in decreasing vacancy rates and/or has an impact on staff retention.   \n \n3.  Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners \n \nIn  recognition  of  the  national  shortage  of  psychiatrists,  CDCR  will  begin  to  recruit  Nurse \nPractitioners (Psychiatric or Mental Health) to provide psychotropic medication management in \nlieu  of  psychiatrists  for  the  Clinical  Correctional  Case  Management  System  (CCCMS) \npopulation.  Their work will be supervised by the institution’s senior psychiatrist supervisor or \nchief psychiatrist. The civil service classification for Nurse Practitioners already exists.  CDCR \nis currently developing the recruitment and hiring plan and hopes to begin hiring applicants that \nspecialize in psychiatry in early 2017. \n \n4.  Utilization Management \n \nCDCR strives to ensure that only appropriate patients receive services in its Mental Health \nServices Delivery System.  To ensure that CDCR is placing the right patient in the right bed at \nthe right time, CDCR has renewed efforts to comply with the Coleman Program Guide discharge \ncriteria established in 2009.  On November 15, 2016, CDCR directed the Chiefs of Mental \nHealth  at  each  institution  to  review  CCCMS  patients  who  have  been  stable  and  free  of \npsychiatric medication for at least six months to determine whether they have been in continuous \nremission and are functioning adequately in the mainline without treatment.  This type of review \nwill occur quarterly on an ongoing basis.  The purpose is to ensure the limited staff resources are \nservicing the patients meeting criteria for inclusion in the Mental Health Services Delivery \nSystem. \n \nCDCR is in the early stages of designing a similar review for the Enhanced Outpatient Program \npopulation in order to ensure that the right patients are placed and retained at the EOP level of \ncare.  CDCR recognizes that this effort should be implemented with care and consideration for \nthe safety and wellbeing of the patients. To that end, CDCR is committed to working with the \nSpecial Master and his team of experts to ensure that the review is implemented appropriately.     \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 127 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 43 of 71\n \n5.  Proposition 57 \n \nOn November 8, 2016, the voters passed Proposition 57, the Public Safety and Rehabilitation \nAct of 2016.  Proposition 57 reforms the adult criminal justice system in California by creating a \nparole consideration process for non-violent offenders who have served the full term for their \nprimary criminal offense in state prison, and authorizes CDCR to award credits earned for good \nbehavior  and  approved  rehabilitative  or  educational  achievements.  \n(See http://www.ebudget.ca.gov /for a more detailed discussion.)    Proposition 57 allows the \nstate to implement durable solutions to maintain compliance with the court-ordered population \ncap, and gives the state regulatory authority to eliminate the need for court-ordered population \nreduction measures. \nCDCR is drafting regulations now to implement the proposed parole and credit changes, which \nwill be subject to a certification by the Secretary that they protect and enhance public safety.  \nThe Budget assumes that regulations will be implemented on October 1, 2017.  Proposition 57 is \nexpected to reduce the average daily adult inmate population by 1,959 in 2017-18.  In addition to \nthe staffing proposals included in this plan, CDCR anticipates that Proposition 57 will reduce the \nnumber of patients participating in the Mental Health Services Delivery System, and CDCR will \nachieve a parallel reduction in staff. \n6.  Mental Health Academy \n \nCDCR understands that its system is only as strong as the staff who implement its requirements.  \nIn an effort to further invest in the training and development of staff, CDCR will establish a \nMental Health Academy onboarding program for new mental health staff which will provide a \nbroader perspective of the entire system and a uniform approach on policies, procedures and \nexpectations when staff is first hired.  CDCR anticipates this will have a positive impact on \nretention of staff.  Because CDCR is in the early stages of development of this program and is \ncollaborating  with  its  partners  at  CCHCS  in  its  development,  no  specific  date  is  set  for \nimplementation at this time. \n \nOther Issues:  \n \n1.  Salary Increases for Psychiatrists \n \nThis Court has also directed that CDCR consider increasing the salaries of the psychiatry staff to \nmake the work in its institutions more attractive.  CDCR agrees that it should examine salaries \nand is fulfilling this directive by engaging in the collective bargaining process with the union \nrepresenting the psychiatrists.  The negotiations between the union representing psychiatrists and \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 128 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 44 of 71\nthe state of California are ongoing.  As bargaining processes are fluid and confidential,1 CDCR \ncannot  provide  an  estimated  end  date  or  disclose  the  substance  of  the  negotiations,  but  is \noptimistic about a positive bargaining outcome with psychiatrists.   \n   \n2.  Bed Planning \n \nIn its August 9, 2016 order, this Court directed CDCR to consider whether patients in it mental \nhealth system can be further clustered in areas where it can more easily recruit and retain staff.  \nAttached as Exhibit A is CDCR’s current bed plan for the mental health population, which \nproposes additional dedicated mental health beds throughout the system.  This proposal has been \ndeveloped in consultation with the Special Master and his team of experts as well as plaintiffs’ \ncounsel during multiple working group sessions.  In an effort to implement the Court’s vision, \nCDCR has worked to add EOP beds at institutions that have existing programs while it has \nshuttered beds at one hard to staff location.  The plan indicates bed expansions at California State \nPrison, Corcoran (214), California State Prison, Los Angeles County (150), Kern Valley State \nPrison (96), R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility (264), California Substance Abuse Treatment \nFacility (220), California Men’s Colony (197), and San Quentin State Prison (233).   Between \nJune 2016 and March 2017, CDCR will add a net 1,820 EOP beds, including 300 at California \nState Prison, Los Angeles County, activated between June and October 2016, 150 at CSP-COR \nactivated  in  October  2016,  and  62  and  Central  California  Women’s  Facility  activated  in \nDecember 2016.   CDCR also closed all 90 EOP and Psychiatric Services Unit beds at Pelican \nBay State Prison.   \n \nInstitution  Level  # of Beds  Date (Estimate) \nLAC  IV  300  June - October 2016 \nCOR  IV  150  October 2016 \nRJD  II  264  December 2016 \nSATF  II  220  January - March 2017 \nKVSP  IV  96  February 2017 \nCOR  IV  214  March 2017 \n                                                           \nBefore contract negotiations begin between the state and a union, a formal understanding about \nthe bargaining process is reached.  This includes a provision to not speak publicly about \n1\np roposals at the bargaining table, including those involving salary increases.  A violation of this \nagreement could result in unfair practices charges brought before the Public Employees \nRelations Board.  The Legislature has recognized the confidentiality of the bargaining process by \nexempting it from the Public Records Act.  (See Cal. Gov. Code, § 6254(p).)  CDCR also is \nmindful that if one party violates the terms of confidentiality, it will chill the bargaining process.\n6 \n \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 129 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 45 of 71\nSQ  II or III  233  March 2017 \nLAC  III  150  TBD \nCCWF  Female  62  TBD \nCMC  III  197  TBD \n \nFurther  clustering  would  require  CDCR  to  close  some  institutions  to  the  mental  health \npopulation and concentrate the same population in fewer locations.  While CDCR has increased \nthe size of existing EOP programs throughout the system, CDCR and the Plata Receiver are \ncognizant that overfilling an institution with the most acute patients can have a negative impact \non the staff and mental health delivery program.  CDCR must be careful not to cluster too great a \npopulation of hard to treat patients in any one place or risk alienating the very staff it seeks to \nattract and retain.  Even in urban areas where it is easier to hire staff, creating an environment in \nwhich the program offers staff only the most difficult and acute types of patients presents a \nchallenge to hiring and retaining staff.  Staff fatigue from an overload of difficult cases is a \nserious risk posed by over clustering.  CDCR must be careful to strike a reasonable balance \nbetween clustering existing mental health programs while also ensuring that the environment \nremains an attractive place for employees to work.   \n \nCDCR’s bed plan represents a careful compromise between absolute clustering and decentralized \nservices.  It is ideal for patients to have both continuity of care and location.  By creating \ninstitutions that offer as many levels of care and housing programs as possible, it increases the \nchance that the patient will thrive in his or her environment.  Likewise, staff in that location will \nbe able to treat a variety of patients with different acuities, reducing the likelihood of staff \nfatigue and increasing workplace satisfaction.  CDCR’s current bed plan balances both staff and \npatient satisfaction with the ability to continue to attract and retain competent clinical staff.    \n \nConclusion: \nCDCR’s mental health staff provides quality care to all participants within its Mental Health \nServices Delivery System.  CDCR is committed to regularly reviewing and adjusting the court-\nordered 2009 staffing plan and these current plans to meet the needs of the patient population.  \nThrough  that  process,  Defendants  will  continue  to  explore  alternatives  to  the  way  care  is \ndelivered to patients in CDCR’s mental health delivery system.  CDCR will continue to work \nwith the Special Master and his team to assess the proposals laid out in this staffing plan.  CDCR \nwill also monitor the staffing plans and the system’s need through the Continuous Quality \nImprovement Tool with the ultimate goal of ending court oversight as soon  as reasonably \npracticable.   \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 130 of 163\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DBD i v iDsioon couf Hmeaelthn Ct a5re5 S6e4rv i c eFsiled 02/06/17   Page 46 of 71\nMental Health Program\nMALE BED PLAN\nCALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FACILITIES -

Brown \nPlaintiffs’ Objections to Defendants’ January 10, 2017 Staffing Plan.  \nOur File No. 0489-03 \n \nDear Special Master Lopes: \nAfter more than 18 months of meetings between the parties and the Special Master \non staffing issues, and several hearings before the Court, Defendants have presented their \nFinal Staffing Plan to the Plaintiffs and the Special Master.  See January 10, 2017 \nUpdated Staffing Plan (hereinafter, “Final Staffing Plan.”)   \n While we appreciate the efforts Defendants have made, their Final Staffing Plan \npresents an inadequate remedy to the severe current staffing problems -- particularly in \nthe key category of psychiatry staff.  Indeed, Defendants’ efforts fall far short of the \nCourt’s clear mandate in 2009 to “take all steps necessary” to address the “ongoing \nproblem of mental health staffing shortages and come into compliance with” the existing \nCourt-ordered staffing plan.  See June 18, 2009 Order, Docket 3613, at 2; June 16, 2014 \nOrder, Docket 5171, at 4 (referencing June 13, 2002 Order, Docket 1383).  Likewise, \nDefendants’ plan falls short of the Court’s more recent mandate in its May 18, 2015 \nOrder, which noted that “inadequate mental health staffing levels have plagued the \nremedial phase of this litigation since its inception” and which forcefully asserted that \n“after almost twenty years of effort this problem must be finally and fully remedied.”  See \nMay 18, 2015 Order, Docket 5307, at 5:18-20.  While Defendants have made some \n \n[3094548-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 134 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 50 of 71\n \nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS \nColeman Special Master Matthew A. Lopes Jr. \nJanuary 25, 2017 \nPage 2 \n \nprogress and have set forth some productive ideas, we do not agree that their current plan \nwill lead to a “final and full” remedy for this problem, without further salary increases for \npsychiatrists and additional steps.   \nAlso, while the main focus of our objections is on the critical psychiatrist category \nwhere the shortfalls are most severe, Defendants’ staffing still persistently falls short in \nthe area of Recreational Therapists, and the overall progress Defendants have made in the \nareas of Psychologist and Social Worker staffing masks some persistent staffing \nshortfalls in those categories at individual institutions.  See Section D below. \nDefendants’ Final Staffing Plan is deficient for many reasons: \n•  Defendants have failed to make any attempt to address their severe, chronic \npsychiatry vacancy rates with appropriate, measured salary increases designed to \nattract and retain more candidates.   \n•  Defendants rely excessively on tele-psychiatrists without appropriate limitations \non their use.  \n•  The psychiatrist shortage in the CDCR is getting worse, and the telepsychiatry \nprogram appears in part to be merely moving psychiatrists already working for the \nCDCR from institutions to remote tele-psychiatry call centers.    \n•  The planned expansions of the telepsychiatry programs in Rancho Cucamonga and \nat San Quentin require construction, so that many of the positions cannot even be \nfilled until 2018 at the earliest, making this approach too slow to bring relief that is \nneeded now. \n•  The proposed “lift and shift” of inpatient programs from DSH to CDCR is certain \nto make the psychiatrist staffing problems worse, particularly at SVPP and CHCF, \nwhere the DSH staffing levels for psychiatrists and other mental health \nprofessionals are much higher than the corresponding rates in the parallel CDCR \nprograms. \n•  Defendants’ clustering plan is far too limited in scope and the clustering is at the \nwrong locations.  Defendants are shutting down only one small remote EOP \nprogram, and they are adding large “clusters” of EOP beds at a number of very \ndifficult to staff institutions.  \n•  The dramatic ongoing current expansion of EOP beds and other mental health \nbeds will make the current staffing problems worse. \n \n[3094548-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 135 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 51 of 71\n \nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS \nColeman Special Master Matthew A. Lopes Jr. \nJanuary 25, 2017 \nPage 3 \n \n•  Defendants’ utilization management efforts are unlikely to yield significant \nresults.  Defendants reported during the work group meetings last year that they \nalready reviewed EOPs and found they overwhelmingly need EOP care.    \n•  Defendants’ other remedial measures are too small to affect the overall \npsychiatrist vacancy rate and any other potential vacancy problems in other \nclinical categories that – given the Department’s past record in this area – must be \nviewed as likely to re-occur in the future. \nWe discuss each of these significant staffing-related problems in turn below: \nA.  Defendants Should Be Required to Dramatically Boost Pay for \nPsychiatrists and Possibly for Other Clinical Categories. \nThe CDCR’s staffing problems are well-established and have persisted throughout \nthe life of this case.  The original order requiring Defendants to reduce clinical staffing \nvacancies to 10% or less in each category of clinical staff is now more than 14 years old.  \nSee June 13, 2002 Order, Docket 1383.  Defendants have never achieved that benchmark.     \n  As explained in the 26th Monitoring Report, Defendants’ vacancy levels for \npsychiatrists and psychologists in 2015 were essentially unchanged from when \nmonitoring in this case began in 1998.  And, “without adequate staff, even the best of \nplans for mental health care are at risk of remaining merely an abstraction.”  See 26th \nReport, Docket 5439, at 16.1   \n  Despite this lack of progress, Defendants have failed to increase psychiatrist pay \nin any significant way in recent years.  As a result, in the last two years, since November \nof 2014, the total number of psychiatrists (including tele-psychiatrists and registry \npsychiatrists) working in the CDCR has remained essentially unchanged, growing by \nonly 7 from 251 to 258 between November of 2014 and November of 2016.  See Exhibit \nA hereto.  During that same period of time, the number of EOP patients in the CDCR \ngrew by 23%, from 5938 to 7318.2  Id.  As a result, the number of EOP patients per \n                                              \n1 All references for the 26th Round Report and DSH Report are to the docket \npagination. \n2 To their credit, during this same period of time the CDCR Defendants were able \nto significantly increase the headcount of social workers (from 339 to 380), psychologists \n(from 622 to 675), and Recreational Therapists (from 166.5 to 211). \n \n[3094548-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 136 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 52 of 71\n \nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS \nColeman Special Master Matthew A. Lopes Jr. \nJanuary 25, 2017 \nPage 4 \n \npsychiatrist in the CDCR has increased during this period from 29.6 to 42.2.  See Exhibit \nB hereto.  \n  Moreover, having failed to increase the psychiatrist staffing numbers at the same \ntime that the mental health population has been steadily growing, the overall percentage \nvacancy rate for CDCR psychiatrists has now been steadily growing for two years.  The \nfollowing chart includes use of registry psychiatrists but does not include telepsychiatrist \nuse because of insufficient data for the period in question: \nEOP Population versus Psychiatric Staffing Rate,  \nNovember 2013 - November 2016 \n7500 88.0%\n85.5% \n84.3% \n7318 \n7000 7195  84.0%\n81.4% \n6971 \n79.5% \n6500 6375  6705  80.0%\n78.4% \n77.3%  6501 \n6000 6184  74.5%  76.0%\n73.3%  6050 \n5671 \n5937 \n5797 \n5500 72.0%\n72.3% \n5464  68.9% \nPsychiatric Staffing Rate 67.8% \n67.4% \n5000 5167  68.0%\nEOP Population\n5011  67.0% \n63.4% \n4500 64.0%\n4000 60.0%\n \nNote: the Psychiatric Staffing Rate is taken as the number of Staff Psychiatrists over the number of established Staff Psychiatrist \npositions, including Registry Psychiatrists.  \n   Given the CDCR’s inability to expand the total number of psychiatrists using other \nmeans, Defendants must now be required to dramatically increase pay for both Registry \nand Staff Psychiatrists.  Including Registry and Staff Psychiatrists, but not including tele-\npsychiatrists, the total number of CDCR psychiatrists has actually declined steadily since \nNovember of 2014, falling by 35 from 251 to 216 in the two-year period between \nNovember of 2014 and November of 2016.  See Exhibit A hereto.   \n  Moreover, monthly statistical data for the last six months on registry use from the \nmost recent November data package shows that usage rates have been falling slowly and \nsteadily in the last six months for registry clinicians statewide, including individually for \n \n[3094548-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 137 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 53 of 71\n \nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS \nColeman Special Master Matthew A.

Indeed, overall, the data \nshows a marked reduction in registry usage in just the last six months since June 2016, \nwith the overall number of position equivalents used falling from 127.15 in June to 96.52 \nin October, and then rising to 114.75 in November.  Id. \n  A dramatic pay raise is needed to boost psychiatry recruitment and retention for \nboth Staff and Registry psychiatrists – everything else has failed. \n  We also strongly object to the position of Defendants throughout the Court-\nordered workgroup discussions on staffing issues in the last six months that they cannot \nshare any information about possible plans to increase psychiatrist salaries, or studies \nabout psychiatrist pay, because the issue is currently in the process of collective \nbargaining negotiations.   The Court’s power to remedy the ongoing violations of its \nstaffing orders with pay increases is not in any way inhibited by the collective bargaining \nprocess.  By withholding information about possible pay increases, Defendants have \nsimply forced the Special Master and the Court to make a blunt estimate of the pay \nincrease needed to attract more psychiatrists to California’s prisons. \nB.  Defendants’ Telepsychiatry Policy Does Not Include All Appropriate \nSafeguards and Will Not Be An Adequate or Timely Remedy for The \nChronic Psychiatry Staffing Problem.  \n  Defendants rely excessively on telepsychiatrists in their Final Staffing Plan, \nwithout appropriate limitations on their use.  Defendants should be required to affirm \ntheir prior statements that they will not use telepsychiatrists in inpatient programs and \nwill only allow their use in MHCB units in urgent off hours circumstances.  Defendants \nshould also be required to limit the percentage of psychiatrists at any given institution \nwho can be telepsychiatrists. \n As we noted in our letter on this issue last summer, we agree with the Coleman \nCourt’s observation in its May 18, 2015 Order that the unrestricted use of telepsychiatry \n“is troubling, particularly because there may be class members not susceptible to this \nmethod of care.”  See May 18, 2015 Order, Docket 5307, at 5:13-14.  Despite the Court’s \ncautionary statement, Defendants’ Telepsychiatry Policy from late 2015 broadly \nauthorizes the use of this treatment method indicating that “IPs shall not be excluded \nfrom participation in [the] Telepsychiatry Program based solely on their level of care or \ntheir diagnosis.”  See Defendants’ November 1, 2015 Staffing Update, Ex 2 (2015 \nTelepsychiatry Policy), at 12-12-6.   \n \n[3094548-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 138 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 54 of 71\n \nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS \nColeman Special Master Matthew A. Lopes Jr. \nJanuary 25, 2017 \nPage 6 \n \nWe disagree with Defendants’ sweeping characterization of the appropriate use \nand scope of telepsychiatry.  We object to this policy as not imposing basic, clearly \nestablished limitations on the use of telepsychiatry that have been set forth by the Special \nMaster and/or in professional standards. \nFirst, Defendants’ policy should incorporate the Special Master’s finding in the \n26th Progress Report that telepsychiatry “is primarily an option for treatment of inmates at \nthe 3CMS level of care, and a less desirable option for higher levels of care.”  See 26th \nReport, Docket 5439, at 30 (emphasis removed).  Defendants did not object to this \nfinding.  Although the CDCR policy does specify that “[o]nsite providers shall remain the \npreferred method of psychiatric care in inpatient settings,” it expressly permits the use of \ntelepsychiatry in MHCBs when no on site providers are available, and the policy clearly \nenvisions the routine use of telepsychiatry with EOPs.  See Defendants’ 2015 \nTelepsychiatry Policy at 12-12-1.  We object to anything other than temporary, \nemergency use of telepsychiatrists in MHCBs or ever in any other inpatient units.  \nLimited use of telepsychiatry in EOP programs could be negotiated, with appropriate \nlimitations.  \nSecond, each mental health program must have a stable, onsite contingent of live \npsychiatrists which is supplemented by telepsychiatry.  New monthly staffing reports \nincluding telepsychiatry that the parties developed in the workgroup meetings (and that \nhave been made available only since August) provide numbers of on-site staff \npsychiatrists as well as telepsychiatrists at individual institutions.  For example, the \nNovember 2016 telepsychiatry data shows that SVSP has only 1.3 on site psychiatrists \nand 5.3 tele-psychiatrists.  SVSP has a 10-bed MHCB unit, where the use of \ntelepsychiatrists should be limited.  See Exhibit D hereto (Monthly telepsychiatry data \nincluding staff psychiatrist staffing for same institutions, November 2016).  Another \nexample is HDSP, which also has a 10-bed MHCB and which has no psychiatrists on site \nand 4.0 telepsychiatrists.  Id.  How can the institution appropriately care for crisis patients \nwith no on-site psychiatrists?  What happens if all the telephone lines go down in a storm, \nsuch as the severe rains that eliminated 58 beds at SVPP in the past months? \nIn addition, with the lack of progress in recent years in hiring psychiatrists, and the \nsteady erosion in the number of staff psychiatrists working in the CDCR, we are \nconcerned that the telepsychiatry program is merely moving psychiatrists already \nworking for the CDCR from institutions to telepsychiatry call centers.  Since November \nof 2014, the number of mission-critical, on-the-ground staff psychiatrists working in \nCDCR institutions has fallen by 27 from 200 to 173.  See Exhibit E hereto. Thus, the 48 \nadditional tele-psychiatrists hired to date have actually only resulted in an additional 20 \nclinicians.  This is consistent with our observation when the parties visited the \n \n[3094548-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 139 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 55 of 71\n \nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS \nColeman Special Master Matthew A. Lopes Jr. \nJanuary 25, 2017 \nPage 7 \n \ntelepsychiatry offices in Elk Grove last year that two of the three telepsychiatrists we \nobserved had previously worked at CDCR institutions – MCSP and CHCF – located \nwithin an hour from Elk Grove.   \nFinally, the telepsychiatry remedy is too slow and relief is needed now.  The \nplanned expansions of the telepsychiatry programs in Rancho Cucamonga and at San \nQuentin require construction, so that many of the positions cannot even be filled until \n2018, making this approach too slow to bring relief that is needed now. \nC.  Defendants’ Clustering Plan Is Inadequate and the Cluster Locations \nare Poorly Selected \n  Defendants’ clustering plan is far too limited in scope and the clustering is at the \nwrong locations.  Defendants are shutting down only one small remote EOP program \n(PBSP with 90 EOP and PSU beds combined), and they are adding significant “clusters” \nof EOP beds at a number of very difficult to staff institutions.  See Final Staffing Plan at \n6.  Defendants are adding the following EOP beds at “cluster” institutions with extremely \nlow psychiatrist staffing rates: \n  Defendants are adding 300 EOP beds at LAC, which has 4.0 out of 16.0 \nallocated psychiatrist positions filled and on site, and which has a 47% \nvacancy rate including tele-psychiatrists and registry coverage.  See \nExhibit D hereto (Defendants’ November 2016 Allocated and Filled Tele-\npsychiatry Positions Chart, from December 2016 Monthly Statistics).3  \n  Defendants are adding 220 EOP beds at SATF, which has only 1.0 out of \n16 allocated psychiatrist positions filled and on site, and which has a 46% \nvacancy rate including tele-psychiatrists and registry coverage.  Id.    \n  Defendants are adding 96 EOP beds at KVSP, which has zero on site \nallocated psychiatrist positions filled out of 9.0 positions, which is using a \nsingle tele-psychiatrist, and which, including registry usage, has a 54% \nvacancy rate – one of the very worst in the state.  Id. \n  Defendants are adding 364 EOP beds (in two stages) at CSP-Corcoran, \nwhich has a slightly better total vacancy rate overall, including \n                                              \n3  This chart is the only monthly source of staffing levels including tele-\npsychiatrists in the totals for their institutions. \n \n[3094548-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 140 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 56 of 71\n \nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS \nColeman Special Master Matthew A. Lopes Jr. \nJanuary 25, 2017 \nPage 8 \n \ntelepsychiatrists and registry, of 33%, but which only has 2.5 out of 14.5 \nallocated psychiatrist positions filled with staff psychiatrists on the ground.  \nId. \n  These examples establish that Defendants’ approach to clustering has been too \nlimited and has included clusters at institutions certain to be very difficult to staff. \n  Plaintiffs also object to Defendants’ failure to relocate its mental health programs \nfrom the troubled HDSP to a location where it can hire clinical staff more easily.  HDSP \ndoes not have a single Staff Psychiatrist on site, despite a 10-bed MHCB, and has not for \na very long time.  See Exhibit D hereto. \nD.  Defendants’ Progress State-Wide in Hiring Psychologists and Social \nWorkers Masks Persistent Problems at Individual Institutions, and \nDefendants Fall Short of the 10% Benchmark for Recreational \nTherapists Statewide. \n  Defendants are correct that they have made significant progress towards the \nmeeting Court-ordered 10% staffing vacancy threshold for psychologists and social \nworkers state-wide.  See June 13, 2002 Order, Docket 1383.  However, that overall \nprogress masks persistent shortages in these categories at a number of critical institutions \nfor mental health care.  The charts below for the five institutions with the most persistent \nhiring trouble outside the staff psychiatrist category  highlights staffing levels below 80% \nfor clinical psychologists, social workers, and recreational therapists in May of 2016 and \nagain in November of 2016: \nExcluding Registry  COR  KVSP  MCSP  SATF  SVSP \nClinical Psychologists           \nMay 2016  91%  70%  77%  71%  67% \nNovember 2016  97%  74%  73%  86%  63% \nSocial Workers           \nMay 2016  95%  100%  100%  93%  88% \nNovember 2016  94%  92%  93%  95%  74% \nRec Therapists           \nMay 2016  27%  80%  89%  23%  74% \nNovember 2016  34%  60%  88%  31%  74% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[3094548-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 141 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 57 of 71\n \nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS \nColeman Special Master Matthew A.

Defendants’ Proposed Lift and Shift Transfer of the Inpatient \nHospitals at CMF, SVSP and CHCF Will Make Overall Staffing \nProblems Worse. \n  The proposed “lift and shift” transfer of inpatient programs from DSH to CDCR is \ncertain to make the current psychiatrist staffing problems worse, particularly at SVPP and \nCHCF, where the DSH staffing levels for psychiatrists (and in other categories) are much \nhigher than the corresponding rates for CDCR clinical staff.  This transfer proposal has \nbeen made several times in the past, and has never been implemented.  See, e.g., 10/17/07 \nOrder, Docket 2461.  One of the key reasons for the failure of this idea to progress may \nbe that a significant number of clinicians who are willing to work for a State Hospital \nProgram are not willing to work for the CDCR.  We have heard this anecdotally from \nDSH clinicians over the years, and current staffing data for the two departments bears out \nthis concern. \n  Currently at the Salinas Valley State Prison, the staffing rates for the CDCR \nprogram and the DSH program show dramatic differences, based on the most recent \nstaffing data in the monthly reports, which is for November of 2016: \n \n[3094548-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 142 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 58 of 71\n \nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS \nColeman Special Master Matthew A.

They do not waive other objections to \nthe proposal but so doing.  In particular, Plaintiffs await a promised “rollout” plan, which \npresumably will include a plan for hiring of sufficient numbers of hospital administrators \nto handle an additional approximately 1,000 high-acuity patients, as contemplated by the \nCourt’s 2007 order.  See 10/17/07 Order at 2, Docket 2461.  \n \n[3094548-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 143 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 59 of 71\n \nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS \nColeman Special Master Matthew A. Lopes Jr. \nJanuary 25, 2017 \nPage 11 \n \n \nF.  Defendants’ Utilization Management Proposals Are Vague and \nUnlikely to Result in Significant Reductions in Demand for Mental \nHealth Care. \n  Defendants have been reviewing CCCMS patients who are not on medications to \nsee if they need to stay on the caseload.  They are also “in the early stages” of designing a \nsimilar review process for EOPs.  Defendants’ clinical leadership previously reported to \nplaintiffs and the Special Master in an all parties meeting last summer that they \ninformally reviewed EOP class members to see if they were appropriately at that level of \ncare and found that they were indeed appropriately EOPs.  \n  We will be providing detailed comments and objections in a separate letter to the \ndraft plan to review EOPs for removal from the program, many of which were already \ndiscussed in previous workgroup sessions.  However, for the purposes of this letter, \nPlaintiffs note that there is no evidence that CDCR is currently providing excessive or \nunnecessary mental health services to any class members.   \nG.  Defendants’ Remaining Remedial Measures are Too Small and Timid \nto Impact the Overall Vacancy Problems Facing the Department. \n  Defendants’ other remedial measures are too small to impact the overall \npsychiatrist vacancy rate.   \n  (a) The Internship and Fellowship Program:  While positive, the Psychiatry \nFellowship program only has two psychiatry residents and there are no firm plans yet for \nexpansions of this program to other schools or prisons.  In this regard, the Fellowship \nprogram is much smaller and has had much less of an impact than the internship program \nfor psychologists, which currently employs 31 individuals at 11 institutions.  See Final \nStaffing Plan at 2.  Defendants should not be given much credit for a program that only \ninvolves two residents at a time.  \n  (b) Medical Assistants:  The use of Medical Assistants is also positive and may \nover time lead to an increase in psychiatry staff retention.  See Final Staffing Plan at 1-2. \nHowever, Defendants have not shown that these positions will reduce the need for \npsychiatrists.  Defendants have promised multiple times to provide details on studies they \nplanned to conduct on the efficacy of the position, but have not.  Indeed, informal reports \nat workgroup meetings indicate that the rollout of the position has been spotty. Right \nnow, based on plaintiffs’ counsel’s observations of telepsychiatry meetings with a \nmedical assistant present, the medical assistants mostly seem to be working as assistants \n \n[3094548-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 144 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 60 of 71\n \nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS \nColeman Special Master Matthew A. Lopes Jr. \nJanuary 25, 2017 \nPage 12 \n \nfor tele-psychiatrists.  In that role, they facilitate the tele-psychiatry process itself by \nhelping with scheduling, documenting the meeting and providing a physical staff \npresence in the room with the patient during meetings with the telepsychiatrists, but their \nrole does not appear likely to speed up clinical contacts or reduce paperwork for the \npsychiatrists.  For example, the psychiatrist still has to write his or her own progress \nnotes and medication orders. \n  (c) Increasing Contract Rates for Registry Workers:  The increased rates for \ncontract psychiatrists do not appear to have helped increase the use of registry contractors \nduring the last two years.  Indeed, as explained above, in just the last six months the use \nof registry psychiatrists has fallen from 44.9 to 42.9 position equivalents per month.  See \nExhibit C hereto.  Contract usage has also fallen for other clinical categories during the \nsame period.  Id.   Moreover, Defendants have provided no detailed information about the \ntiming or the amount of the increase in contractor rates.  The lack of an increase in \nregistry usage in recent years suggests the rate increases have been too modest. \n  (d) On Call Compensation and Double Positions:   The change in compensation \nfor on call hours from leave credit to cash is positive but unlikely to have much impact.  \nThe use of double positions is concerning. Full-time workers will inevitably be less \nefficient working additional days, and possibly less effective as clinicians. \n  (e) Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners:  This is a potentially very helpful measure, \nbut the workgroup discussions on this issue made clear that there are not many \nindividuals in this category currently trained and licensed in California.  There was \ndiscussion about working with Fresno State and other schools starting programs for \nPsychiatric Nurse Practitioners, but that will take time to develop and to have a \nmeaningful impact on CDCR staffing. \nConclusion \nDefendants are not treating ongoing staffing inadequacies with the required sense \nof urgency.  As we stated in our staffing letter to Defendants last July, this is a severe \nstaffing crisis that is putting patients’ lives at risk.  As found in the 26th Report, although \n“Defendants’ latest court-ordered staffing plan was submitted over a year ago, they have \ndemonstrated no sense of the required urgency for a meaningful implementation of the \nplan.”  See 26th Report, Docket 5439, at 31.  At the same time that Defendants face the \ncurrent staffing crisis, the system’s mental health population of 38,356 prisoners as of \nOctober 17, 2016 is now significantly larger than it was in July 2008, at the peak of \n \n[3094548-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 587-3   Filed 06/23/17   Page 145 of 163\nCase 2:90-cv-00520-KJM-DB   Document 5564   Filed 02/06/17   Page 61 of 71\n \nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS \nColeman Special Master Matthew A.

I am an attorney admitted to practice law in California, a member of the bar \n3  of this Court, and an associate at the law firm of Rosen Bien Galvan & Grunfeld LLP, \n4  counsel of record for Plaintiffs.  I have personal knowledge of the matters set forth herein, \n5  and if called as a witness I could competently so testify.  I make this declaration in support \n6  of Plaintiffs’ Response to Defendants’ Motion for Approval of the Implementation Plans. \n7  2.  The purpose of this Declaration is to provide an offer of proof regarding \n8  what the evidence will show if the Court receives briefing on the adequacy of the dental \n9  implementation plan.   \n10  3.  Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of Plaintiffs’ October \n11  16, 2015 letter providing Plaintiffs’ initial comments on Defendants’ first draft dental \n12  implementation plan.  Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of Plaintiffs’ \n13  November 19, 2015 letter providing Defendants with additional information regarding \n14  Plaintiffs’ dental expert’s findings and recommendations.   \n15  4.  Plaintiffs have retained Dr. Donald Sauter as their dental expert.  I drafted \n16  the letters attached hereto as Exhibit A and B based on Dr. Sauter’s findings and expert \n17  opinions, which are based on his intensive review of conditions at the Monterey County \n18  Jail (“the Jail”), including an on-site visit on March 23, 2015, his review of class member \n19  records, and his review of the draft dental implementation plans.  \n20  5.  Defendants provided a revised draft dental plan to Plaintiffs on January 4, \n21  2016 that was substantially similar to the dental provisions of the Implementation Plan \n22  submitted to the Court by Defendant California Forensic Medical Group (“CFMG”) on \n23  January 12, 2016 (hereinafter, “CFMG Plan”).  I spoke at length with Dr. Sauter on \n24  January 7, January 9, and January 12, 2016 regarding his review of the revised draft plan \n25  and the remaining deficiencies that he identifies as necessary to meet the Settlement \n26  Agreement’s requirements regarding the provision of dental care at the Jail.  The following \n27  are the primary concerns that Dr. Sauter has identified with respect to Defendants’ \n28  Implementation Plans for dental care.   \n[2938546-3]      1  CV 13 2354 PSG \nDECLARATION OF KRISTA STONE-MANISTA ISO PLS’ RESP TO DEFS’ MOTION FOR APPROVAL \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 3 of 91\n \n1  Dental Staffing Is Inadequate \n2  6.  Evidence shows that Defendants’ current contractual provision with the \n3  County as to dental staffing is inadequate, and is likely not being met. \n4  7.  On September 30, 2014, Defendants filed a copy of an amendment to the \n5  County’s contract with CFMG, dated September 26, 2014, in connection with their \n6  Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification.  See Dkt. No. 140-1 at Ex. A-1.  \n7  The “Minimal County Staffing Pattern Upgrade” attached thereto provided for a Dentist \n8  and Dental Assistant, each to be scheduled for “16 Hours To Be Determined.”  See id. at \n9  PDF pg. 8.   \n10  8.  Attached as Exhibit C is a true and correct copy of the April 8, 2015 \n11  Transcript of Plaintiffs’ Deposition of Dr. Kevin Coolidge.  Dr. Coolidge, the Jail’s only \n12  dentist, testified during his deposition on April 8, 2015 that he worked one 12-hour shift at \n13  the Jail each week, with no plans at that time to change his work schedule.  (See Exhibit C, \n14  at 15:16-16:4, 22:8-16.)  Dr. Coolidge did not specify the schedule worked by the dental \n15  assistant, but testified that he worked closely with one assistant during his one-day-per-\n16  week shift, and did not work with any other assistants.  (See id. at 20:1-24.)  There is no \n17  evidence that the 16 hours of dentist and dental assistant services provided for in the \n18  September 26, 2014 amendment were ever actually achieved.   \n19  9.  The staffing plan submitted by CFMG as Exhibit I to its implementation plan \n20  provides for identical levels of dentist and dental assistant staffing as in the aspirational \n21  September 26, 2014 amendment—a 16 hour per week dentist and dental assistant—and for \n22  8 hours of hygienist services every two weeks.  (CFMG Plan at 94.)  However, the plan \n23  also states that “professional dental hygiene services are currently not provided,” CFMG \n24  Plan at 92, so it is unclear whether there is a real commitment to providing dental hygienist \n25  services.  Even as stated on Plan page 94, however, these staffing levels are inadequate. As \n26  of March 20, 2015 (a few days before Dr. Sauter’s visit to the Jail), the Jail population was \n27  913, of which 103 had been at MCJ for greater than twelve months.  For a population of \n28  913 jail inmates, accepted standards dictate staffing by at least one full-time equivalent \n[2938546-3]      2  CV 13 2354 PSG \nDECLARATION OF KRISTA STONE-MANISTA ISO PLS’ RESP TO DEFS’ MOTION FOR APPROVAL \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 4 of 91\n \n1  dentist as well as one dental assistant.  See, e.g., Makrides, N.S. et al. (2006) Corr. Dental \n2  Servs., in M. Puisis (ed.), Clinical Practice in Corr. Med. (2d ed., pp. 556-563).   \n3  10.  CFMG has not provided any staffing analysis justifying its dental staffing \n4  levels.  In fact, CFMG’s internal documents, provided in discovery, demonstrate that the \n5  Jail’s own dentist:  1) identified the need for a full-time dentist, and 2) acknowledged his \n6  inability to meet the dental care needs of the Jail population.  (See Exhibit B at Exs. A-C.)   \n7  Unjustifiable Limitations on Care \n8  11.  Defendants agreed to an Implementation Plan that would guarantee “access \n9  to care other than extractions” and “periodic dental care for long-term prisoners,” with no \n10  distinction between sentenced and unsentenced inmates.  (Settlement Agreement ¶ 31(j).)  \n11  However, Defendants’ Implementation Plan refers to “services for inmates with jail terms \n12  less than one year” and to “services for inmates with jail terms of greater than one year.”  \n13  (See CFMG Plan at 92.)  The plan also contains various provisions limiting the availability \n14  of certain types of care to only those prisoners with a “verifiable sentence” of 12 months or \n15  longer.  (See CFMG Plan at 95, 96, 97, 99, 101, 103. ) In other provisions, the plan refers \n16  to a requirement that a patient have 6 or 12 months of “verifiable, continuous incarceration \n17  remaining” without reference to sentencing status.  (See CFMG Plan at 98.)  The \n18  Settlement Agreement does not allow Defendants to limit necessary care to only those \n19  class members serving sentences at the Jail and there is no legal or factual basis for \n20  limiting care to only sentenced prisoners.   \n21  12.  CFMG’s internal documents demonstrate their acknowledgement that a \n22  prisoner’s length of time in custody, not his or her legal status, is what must govern access \n23  to care.  CFMG’s May 29, 2014 Quality Assurance meeting minutes state: “Dr. Fithian \n24  noted that a dental committee including Dr. Coolidge has gathered and provided \n25  recommendations for inmate care for those in custody longer than twelve months.  He said \n26  that CFMG staff are currently reviewing those recommendations and will have those out \n27  soon.”  (See Exhibit B at Ex. E.)   \n28 \n[2938546-3]      3  CV 13 2354 PSG \nDECLARATION OF KRISTA STONE-MANISTA ISO PLS’ RESP TO DEFS’ MOTION FOR APPROVAL \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 5 of 91\n \n1  Dental Clinic Deficiencies \n2  13.  With respect to the Settlement Agreement’s requirement of a “safe and \n3  sanitary” dental care facility, Dr. Sauter’s inspection revealed numerous safety and \n4  sanitation hazards, which are not addressed at all in Defendants’ Implementation Plan.  \n5  (See Exhibit A ¶ 5; Exhibit B ¶ 23.)  These hazards include the inappropriate placement of \n6  equipment for sterilization of instruments, numerous deficiencies in the sterilization set up \n7  and protocols in the dental clinic, and lack of adequate backup sterilization equipment.  \n8  (See id.)  The implementation plan contains no provisions to remediate these deficiencies.  \n9  The plan also does not remedy deficiencies in the availability of necessary materials and \n10  equipment in the dental clinic.  (See Ex. B ¶¶ 22, 23(c).) \n11  Dental Intake Issues \n12  14.  The Settlement Agreement requires assessment of dental needs during the \n13  initial health screening and initial health assessment.  (Settlement Agreement ¶¶ 31(a), \n14  31(j).)  The implementation plan provides that the intake health screening, to be conducted \n15  by a nurse, will include initial assessment of dental needs, but does not require that the \n16  dentist provide training or supervision to intake nurses to ensure that such screenings are \n17  adequate.  (See CFMG Plan at 91.)   \n18  15.  With respect to the initial health screening (see CFMG Plan at 92), the plan \n19  lacks adequate provisions to remedy the systemic failures to adequately assess dental needs \n20  at Jail intake that Dr. Sauter identified during his review.  (See Ex. A ¶ 1; Ex. B ¶¶ 6-8.)  \n21  Among other critical deficiencies, a medical professional other than a dentist may conduct \n22  such initial dental screenings, but must be adequately trained and their findings regularly \n23  reviewed by the dentist.  National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) \n24  Standard J-E-06 requires that oral screening be conducted by the dentist or “qualified \n25  health care professionals trained by the dentist.”  The implementation plan does not \n26  provide for such training, and evidence obtained during discovery and reviewed by our \n27  dental expert demonstrates the inadequacy of the Jail’s present dental training system.  \n28  (See Ex. B ¶¶ 9-12.) \n[2938546-3]      4  CV 13 2354 PSG \nDECLARATION OF KRISTA STONE-MANISTA ISO PLS’ RESP TO DEFS’ MOTION FOR APPROVAL \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 6 of 91\n \n1  16.  Defendants’ Implementation Plan lacks necessary provisions to remedy \n2  critical and systemic deficiencies in dental record-keeping identified during Dr. Sauter’s \n3  review.  For example, Jail medical files had little to no evidence of the completion of \n4  dental radiographs, which must be a part of any comprehensive dental examination and \n5  completed before any extraction.  (See Ex. B ¶ 18.)  All radiographs must be filed in the \n6  dental record or a place they can easily be retrieved for review.   \n7  17.  Defendants’ Implementation Plan has several critical deficiencies that must \n8  be remedied to ensure compliance with the Settlement Agreement’s requirements of \n9  “access to care other than extractions” and “periodic dental care for long-term prisoners,”  \n10  Settlement Agreement ¶ 31(j).   \n11  a.  Defendants’ Implementation Plan lacks adequate provisions for access \n12  to specialty dental care services.  For example, it has no provision regarding oral pathology \n13  services. \n14  b.  Defendants’ Implementation Plan lacks adequate protocols for \n15  management of the dental needs of  chronic disease patients.  For example, diabetic and \n16  HIV-positive patients may require dental cleanings and other prophylactic care, regardless \n17  of length of stay in the jail.   \n18  c.  Defendants’ Implementation Plan does not adequately provide for \n19  repair of full dentures needed to masticate food if necessary to restore dental function and \n20  mitigate substantial risks of serious harm to class members who use dentures.  The plan \n21  also does not contain adequate provisions for providing dentures and/or prostheses to \n22  inmates whose teeth are extracted at the Jail.   \n23  d.  Defendants’ Implementation Plan limits access to dental prosthesis \n24  care by applying a “medically necessary” standard that is legally inappropriate and at odds \n25  with community correctional standards.  (See CFMG Plan at 97.)   \n26  e.  Defendants’ Implementation Plan provides for palliative endodontic \n27  therapy, CFMG Plan at 101, but has no provision for completing root canal therapy if the \n28  patient remains at the Jail following the palliative care.  The plan also limits endodontic \n[2938546-3]      5  CV 13 2354 PSG \nDECLARATION OF KRISTA STONE-MANISTA ISO PLS’ RESP TO DEFS’ MOTION FOR APPROVAL \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 7 of 91\n \n1  care when a tooth can “easily be replaced by an addition to an existing or proposed \n2  prosthesis in the same arch,” CFMG Plan at 101, while simultaneously severely restricting \n3  access to prosthetic services.  Finally, the plan does not contain adequate provisions for \n4  root canal therapy for front teeth.  These limitations and omissions are at odds with \n5  community standards of practice.   \n6  f.  Defendants’ Implementation Plan imposes an oral hygiene standard \n7  that a patient have a 20% plaque index score as a criteria for root canal therapy, CFMG \n8  Plan at 102, but there is no basis for denying acute care services based on this criterion.   \n9  I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States and the State \n10  of California that the foregoing is true and correct, and that this declaration is executed at \n11  San Francisco, California this 26th day of January, 2016. \n12 \n13    /s/ Krista Stone-Manista \n  Krista Stone-Manista \n14 \n \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n[2938546-3]      6  CV 13 2354 PSG \nDECLARATION OF KRISTA STONE-MANISTA ISO PLS’ RESP TO DEFS’ MOTION FOR APPROVAL \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 8 of 91\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExhibit A \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 9 of 91\n \n50 Fremont Street, 19th Floor \nSan Francisco, California 94105‐2235 \nT: (415) 433‐6830  ▪  F: (415) 433‐7104 \n \n \nwww.rbgg.com \n \nKrista Stone‐Manista \nEmail:  kstone‐manista@rbgg.com \nOctober 16, 2015 \nVIA ELECTRONIC MAIL \n \nSusan K.

County of Monterey, et al. \nU.S. District Court (N.D. Cal.) No. C 13-02354 PSG \nOur File No. 1187-6 \n \nDear Counsel: \nWe write to provide our comments on Defendants’ implementation plan pertaining \nto dental care (“the Plan”).  The Settlement Agreement contains several requirements \nregarding dental care: \nParagraph 27:  “Initial Health Screening” is a face-to-face interview \nconducted by nursing staff with the arriving individual that identifies \nimmediate medical, mental health and/or dental needs and provides for \nmedication continuity. \nParagraph 28:  “Initial Health Assessment” is a medical, mental health, \ndental and communicable diseases screening which includes a history and \nphysical examination by appropriate clinical staff. \nParagraph 31(a):  The [Intake Screening] Implementation Plan shall also \ninclude standards and timelines for Dental Evaluation. \nParagraph 31(j):  Defendants shall develop and implement a Dental Care \nImplementation Plan to ensure timely access to necessary treatment for \ndental and oral health conditions, including but not limited to Intake \nScreening, access to care other than extractions, a safe and sanitary on or \n \n[2860254-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 10 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nOctober 16, 2015 \nPage 2 \n \n \noff-site facility for necessary dental care, periodic dental care for long-term \nprisoners, and access to dental hygiene supplies. \nPlaintiffs provide the following comments, based on the review and evaluation of \nour dental expert, in order to facilitate a productive meet and confer on these topics, \ntentatively scheduled for October 29, 2015.  These comments do not waive any of \nPlaintiffs’ objections to the draft dental remedial plan. \nDental Staffing \nThe Plan does not include any analysis of dental staffing needs, but simply \nassumes that present staffing is adequate.  Dental staffing is not adequate for the Jail’s \npopulation.  Our dental expert’s review showed that functionally MCJ operates with \ndentist hours equivalent to between 0.23 and 0.27 FTE, and a similar FTE level for dental \nassistant hours.  This works out to a staffing ratio of 1 dentist to approximately 3,800 \ninmates.  This ratio is understated because of the high number of people flowing through \nthe jail.  There were over 11,700 dental intakes in 2014.  Current dental staffing is clearly \ninadequate.  The jail needs at least one FTE dentist and one FTE dental assistant.  If you \nhave any staffing analysis to show otherwise, please share it. \nDental Screening \nThe Plan currently lacks but must include specific provisions related to the \nassessment of dental needs at intake.  The Plan must provide for full implementation of a \nsystem for assessment and prioritization of dental needs at the time of intake (e.g., \nemergency, urgent, interceptive, routine).  As an example, CDCR’s “dental priority \nclassification” system, which Dr. Coolidge testified he uses, is available at \nhttp://www.cdcr.ca.gov/DHCS/docs/2010-August-PP.pdf at 96. \nThe plan must also provide for the following: \n1.  Initial Health Screening- Dental Issues by RN \na.  The screening form must be amended in connection with the classification \nsystem, and must ask at a minimum whether a person presently has serious \ndental pain or signs of infection, is currently undergoing a dental procedure \nor receiving dental treatment, incurred any recent mouth trauma, has any \nmouth lesions or abscesses, or has difficulty chewing or swallowing. \n \n[2860254-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 11 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nOctober 16, 2015 \nPage 3 \n \n \nb.  Training for the Booking RN on the assessment of dental needs in \naccordance with the classification policy. \nc.  Urgent dental needs found at Initial Health Screening shall be referred to \nand evaluated by a dentist within one (1) business day. \nd.  The Initial Health Screening must require a full RN assessment of basic \ndental needs, including documentation of any fillings, broken teeth, \nevidence of periodontal disease, or appearance of potential oral cancer.  \nAny findings of infection or functional impairment should be immediately \nreferred to a dentist. \ne.  The RN performing the Initial Health Screening must properly complete an \nodontogram to document all findings.   The dentist must regularly review \ncompleted odontograms and provide training to RNs where deficiencies are \nfound. \nf.  When individuals report current use of psychotropic medication at Initial \nHealth Screening, the Booking RN must check for xerostomia, or dry \nmouth, and document the findings. \ng.  When individuals self-report chronic illness, or medical records of prior \nstays show chronic illness, the Booking RN must document if this chronic \nillness is accompanied by evidence of serious dental conditions. \n2.  Initial Health Assessment by Dentist \nIn addition to the RN-conducted Initial Health Screening, all prisoners must have a \nface-to-face dental evaluation conducted by a dentist within 14 days. \nThe evaluation should include the following: \na.  A complete extraoral head and neck examination, charting of teeth on an \nodontogram, appropriate diagnostic radiographs to detect caries and bony \nabnormalities, a periodontal examination, and the examination of the hard \nand soft tissues of the oral cavity with a mouth mirror and explorer using \nadequate illumination. \nb.  An oral cancer screening, involving the evaluation of the hard and soft \ntissues of the oral cavity and head and neck. \n \n[2860254-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 12 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nOctober 16, 2015 \nPage 4 \n \n \nc.  A review of the dental priority classification code assigned to the prisoner, \nadequate and timely follow up for these needs as indicated by the \nclassification system. \nd.  Periodontal screening in accordance with the Settlement Agreement’s \nrequirement of access to care (and the recommendations of the CFMG \nDental Task Force Group, Chapter 2.4, to implement a Periodontal Disease \nProgram) must be provided at the time of the dentist’s initial 14-day \nevaluation.   Treatment should be based on periodontal disease \nclassification, dental priority classification code, and special medical needs \n(i.e. pregnancy, diabetes, or HIV/AIDS). \n3.  Care Other than Extractions \nThe Plan lacks adequate provision to ensure compliance with the Settlement \nAgreement’s requirement that prisoners at the Jail have “access to care other than \nextractions.”  The Plan must provide for the following: \na.  In order to ensure that extractions are only performed for teeth that cannot \nbe restored, temporary restorative services must be made available to all \nprisoners.  The Plan must require a radiogram of any damaged tooth before \nmaking the decision whether it is restorable or not and must require \ndocumentation of the radiogram and restoration assessment. \nb.  The Plan must provide for timely extractions of teeth deemed non-\nrestorable.  Our expert recommends that the dentist extract any tooth \ndeemed non-restorable at the time of the evaluation.  If the dentist deems \nthat an oral surgeon’s services are necessary to perform an extraction, a \nreferral must be made in a timely manner and not exceed two weeks. \nc.  Permanent restorative services must be made available at the Jail for \nprisoners with verifiable sentences longer than three months.  The Jail must \nensure that the dental clinic has sufficient materials and supplies to allow \nfor permanent restorations. \nd.  Prisoners with verifiable sentences of longer than three months must \nreceive dental prostheses if it is determined by a dentist that such prostheses \nare medically necessary to alleviate pain, allow for proper mastication, or \nprevent significant illness or disability.  The dental priority classification \nsystem must establish timeframes for such prostheses. \n \n[2860254-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 13 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nOctober 16, 2015 \nPage 5 \n \n \ne.  The Plan must ensure regular audits of dental records to ensure that \nprisoners are treated in timeframes matching their priority classification \ncodes, and must provide for a systemic review of obstacles to care if they \nare not. \n4.  Access to Dental Care \nThe Plan lacks adequate specificity as to the evaluation and triage of requests for \ndental care.  The following provisions must be included: \na.  Any prisoner submitting a request for dental care must be evaluated by a \nQualified Medical Professional with specific training and qualifications in \ndental and oral health diagnosis within 24 hours of the date of the \nprisoner’s complaint. \nb.  Patients must be referred to see a dentist within one calendar day for urgent \nneeds (therefore, weekly Dental Sick call is inadequate) and within seven \ndays for all other needs. \nc.  The Plan must include a timeframe for referrals to the oral surgeon for \n“complicated dental problems,” e.g., root canals.  The Plan must provide a \nsystem for ensuring timely follow-up on such referrals. \n5.  Dental Treatment Space Issues \nThe plan includes no provision for correcting deficiencies in the available dental \nspace and equipment, including deficiencies preventing adequate sterilization and \nsanitization practices.  Our dental expert’s inspection revealed the following safety and \nsanitation hazards, which are not addressed at all in the plan: \na.  The autoclave and the space around it for removal of sterilized instruments \nis just inches from the head of the dental chair when it is reclined.  The area \naround the head of the dental chair is an active operating field, in which \nlarge particle spatter and aerosols of blood and bodily fluids are dispersed \nduring dental procedures1.  It is not safe to put the autoclave and the \n                                              \n1 http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/faq/aerosols.htm \n \n[2860254-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 14 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nOctober 16, 2015 \nPage 6 \n \n \nautoclave work area inside this operating field.  This inevitably leads to \ncontamination of instruments. \nb.  The entire sterilization set up is dangerous for several reasons.  First, \ninstruments are hand-scrubbed, without the use of the types of gloves \nrecommended by the CDC for hand-scrubbing.  This hazard can be \nremediated by switching to ultrasonic pre-cleaning.  Second, the entire area \nlacks biohazard labelling where needed.  Third, and worst of all, the clinic \nis set up so that clean instruction and work area around the autoclave is set \nup such that clean instruments—which must be near the chair so the \nassistant can hand them to the dentist—must be passed across the path \nwhere dirty instruments are transported.  This is contrary to the standard of \ncare and risks cross-contamination, placing the patient at increased risk of \ninfection. \nc.  The dentist relies on an ADEC PAC 1 handpiece delivery system that is \nsuitable for temporary use in a mobile clinic, but is not suitable for long-\nterm use.  (It appears to have been in use at the jail since 2007.)  Dr. \nCoolidge testified that the system cannot maintain enough air pressure to \nrun drilling tools consistently.  This machine must be  replaced.  The \nexisting unit cannot be used for providing care beyond extractions. \nd.  The backup autoclave system—a machine in Dr. Coolidge’s trunk for \nwhich there are no sterilization monitoring records—is not consistent with \nminimal infection control practices. \n6.  Access to Dental Hygiene Supplies \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the Plan to address “access to dental hygiene \nsupplies” but the Plan as drafted does not provide for any improvements in prisoners’ \naccess to supplies.  While we acknowledge that there are security reasons for limiting the \navailability of floss, the following provisions would improve access to dental hygiene \nsupplies without security risks: \na.  The Jail must lower the price of floss loops, toothbrushes, and toothpaste in \ncommissary to be the same as the cost of the product. \nb.  The Jail must adopt a policy to ensure that oral hygiene products are \navailable to indigent prisoners. \n \n[2860254-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 15 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nOctober 16, 2015 \nPage 7 \n \n \nc.  The Jail must ensure that the toothpaste provided at commissary and at \nintake contains fluoride. \n7.  Peer Review and Audit of Dental Staff \nThe plan lacks any provision for peer review and audit of dental staff, and must \nprovide for the following: \na.  The Jail must implement a dental peer review system using the “CFMG \nExternal Peer Review Dental Chart Audit Tool,” and must document the \nexternal peer review of at least ten dental charts per quarter. \nb.  The Jail medical staff and dental staff shall work together to correct \ndocumented failures discovered in these audits. \nc.  These audits must be used to compile annual data regarding the quality of \nthe dental care at the Jail. \nd.  The plan must include specific audit criteria for measuring whether health \ninventories for dental problems are correctly completed.  The plan must set \nforth a time frame for follow up for concerns noted at intake and at the time \nof the health inventory, based on the dental priority classification system \ndiscussed above. \nSincerely, \n \nROSEN BIEN \nGALVAN & GRUNFELD LLP \n \n/s/ Krista Stone-Manista \n \nBy: Krista Stone-Manista \nKSM:cg \n \n[2860254-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 16 of 91\n \n \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConfidential - Subject to Protective Order \n \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 17 of 91\n \n \n50 Fremont Street, 19th Floor \nSan Francisco, California 94105-2235 \nT: (415) 433-6830  ▪  F: (415) 433-7104 \n \n \nwww.rbgg.com \n \nKrista Stone-Manista \nEmail:  kstone-manista@rbgg.com \n \n \nNovember 19, 2015 \n \nSusan K.

County of Monterey, et al.   \n  U.S. District Court (N.D. Cal.) No. C 13-02354 PSG \nOur File No. 1187-6 \n \n  This letter is to provide additional information regarding our dental expert’s \nfindings and recommendations as to necessary elements of the dental remedial plan.  This \nletter supplements and incorporates our October 16, 2015 letter regarding specific aspects \nof the dental remedial plan that must be revised, and sets forth additional evidence \nregarding the necessity of those recommendations.   \n \nDental Staffing \n \n1.  Dental staffing is not adequate for the Jail’s population. Specifically, at the \ntime of our expert’s review, the MCJ population was 913 on March 20, 2015, of which \n103 had been at MCJ for greater than 12 months.  For a population of 913 jail inmates, \naccepted standards dictate staffing by at least one full-time equivalent dentist as well as \none dental assistant.1  This may in fact underestimate the need for dental services at the \nJail given that there were 11,743 intakes to MCJ in 2014. \n2.  CFMG’s own documents acknowledge the need for more dental staffing \nthan the Jail presently has.  As far back as the minutes of the April 21, 2011 Quality \n                                              \n1 Makrides, N.S. et al. (2006) Corr. Dental Servs., in M. Puisis (ed.), Clinical \nPractice in Corr. Med. (2d ed., pp. 556-563). \n \n[2891284-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 18 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nNovember 19, 2015 \nPage 2 \n \n \nAssurance meeting minutes, Dr. Coolidge has informed CFMG and Monterey County \npersonnel “that there are enough dental needs among the adult population to require a full \ntime dentist.  Apparently there is no end to the dental needs for this population.”  Exhibit \nA.  This need is borne out by comments made by Dr. Coolidge and other CFMG \npersonnel in other Quality Assurance meetings.  On August 30, 2012, for example, the \nminutes state, “There are approximately 40 plus on his [Dr. Coolidge’s] list every week; \nof that he is able to see 25 inmates in his single day a week practice here at Monterey \nCounty Jail.  Of those 25, he is noting seven are AB 109 patients.”  Exhibit B.  On \nSeptember 18, 2014, “Dr. Coolidge stated that there are a typical number of 40 patients \non his weekly list, and currently he is able to see about 20 of them,” which are \napproximately the same numbers he gave in 2012.  Exhibit C.  CFMG has yet to provide \nany staffing analysis indicating that Dr. Coolidge is wrong about his recommendation for \na full time dentist. \nDental Screening \n \n3.  CFMG’s policies lack a clear and detailed dental priority classification \nsystem that would enable its providers at all levels to correctly prioritize and schedule \npatients requiring dental care.  CFMG’s two-priority system lacks adequate specificity for \ntimelines and does not set prioritization levels for long-term, non-urgent dental needs.  \n(See CFMG Standardized Nursing Procedure at 33-34.)  Nor is the nursing prioritization \nsystem consistent with the more detailed system used by Dr. Coolidge, who testified that \nhe uses the Dental Priority Classification (“DPC”) system used by the California \nDepartment of Corrections and Rehabilitation (“CDCR”) to categorize the patients’ needs \nand to set a deadline by which patients should be treated.  (Coolidge Depo Trans. 99:14-\n100:17.)   \n4.  The DPC system lays out treatment deadlines for dental patients based on \nthe nature of their dental need.  Title 15 § 3354(f) provides additional detail regarding the \nDPC system:  \nInmates requesting dental treatment shall be evaluated and scheduled into \none of the following categories: \n(1) Emergency care category: A dental emergency, as determined by health \ncare staff, includes any medical or dental condition for which evaluation \nand treatment are necessary to prevent death, severe or permanent \ndisability, or to alleviate disabling pain. Immediate treatment shall be \n \n[2891284-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 19 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nNovember 19, 2015 \nPage 3 \n \n \nprovided and will be available to such inmates 24 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek. \n(2) Urgent care category: Treatment of a dental condition of sudden onset \nor severe pain which prevents the inmate from carrying out essential \nactivities of daily living; or sub-acute or unusual hard or soft tissue \ncondition or pathology requiring early intervention. This category includes: \n(A) DPC 1A: Such inmates shall receive treatment within one calendar day \nof diagnosis. \n(B) DPC 1B: Such inmates shall receive treatment within 30 calendar days \nof diagnosis. \n(C) DPC 1C: Such inmates shall receive treatment within 60 calendar days \nof diagnosis. \n(3) DPC 2 Interceptive care category: Treatment of advanced caries, \nmoderate or advanced periodontal pathology, or the provision of dentures. \nThis category requires that inmates have over 6 months remaining to serve \non their sentence within the department at the time DPC 2 care is initiated, \nand provides eligibility for DPC 2 care regardless of oral hygiene status. \nSuch inmates shall receive treatment within 120 calendar days of diagnosis. \n(4) DPC 3 Routine Rehabilitative care category: Treatment of caries not \nlikely to become advanced within one year, mild periodontal pathology, or \nthe provision of removable partial dentures. This category requires that \ninmates have over 12 months remaining to serve on their sentence within \nthe department at the time DPC 3 care is initiated, and meet oral hygiene \nrequirements. Such inmates shall receive treatment within one year of \ndiagnosis. \n(5) DPC 4 No dental care needed: Inmates not appropriate for inclusion in \nDPC 1, 2, 3 or 5. \n(6) DPC 5 Special needs care: Inmates with special needs. These include \ninmates requiring dental care that is a deviation from treatment policy as \nwell as treatments that may require a contract specialist or that cannot be \naccomplished at the institution. \n \n[2891284-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 20 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nNovember 19, 2015 \nPage 4 \n \n \n5.  While the Dental Plan need not incorporate the CDCR DPC system word-\nfor-word, it must establish a consistent DPC system that will be used by all CFMG \npersonnel who screen and provide dental care at the Jail. \n  Initial Screening \n \n6.  The initial screening form should incorporate the DPC system, and ensure \nthat booking nurses accurately categorize patients according to standardized dental \npriorities for follow-up by the dentist.  The implementation plan must provide for a \nsystem by which to track and monitor compliance with follow-up timeframes. \n7.  The screening form also lacks adequate detail to ensure a full RN \nassessment of basic dental needs.  Presently, the Medical Intake Questionnaire fails to ask \nany questions to identify immediate and/or urgent dental needs. The only dental-related \nquestion is whether the person has dentures.  The Medical Intake Questionnaire should \nalso ask at a minimum whether a person presently has serious dental pain or signs of \ninfection, is currently undergoing a dental procedure or receiving dental treatment, \nincurred any recent mouth trauma, has any mouth lesions or abscesses, or has difficulty \nchewing or swallowing. \n8.  The booking RN will need additional training in how to assess basic dental \nneeds in order to correctly apply the DPC system and to identify immediate and/or urgent \ndental needs. \nInitial Dental Health Assessment  \n9.  Our October 16 letter at pages 3-4 described various aspects of an initial \ndental screening to be completed for all prisoners by a dentist within 14 days.  In light of \nfeedback from CFMG and after consulting further with our expert, we would agree to an \ninitial dental screening that complies with NCCHC standard J-E-06: “Oral screening by \nthe dentist or qualified health care professionals trained by the dentist is performed within \n14 days of admission.”  The oral screening must include “visual observations of the teeth \nand gums, and notation of any obvious gross abnormalities requiring immediate referral \nto the dentist.”  See id.  Such screenings are necessary to identify patients that may suffer \n \n[2891284-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 21 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nNovember 19, 2015 \nPage 5 \n \n \nharm by delaying dental care.2  The initial health inventory must be amended to \nspecifically require a complete oral screening and to align with the established DPC code. \n10.  In order for a non-dentist provider to adequately conduct this screening in \nlieu of the dentist, he or she must be thoroughly trained by the dentist and the dentist \nmust review and supervise the results of these screenings on an ongoing basis.  During \nhis deposition, Dr. Coolidge testified that aside from a PowerPoint presentation in 2010 \nor 2011, he has conducted no formal training of CFMG staff.  (Coolidge Depo Transcript, \np. 25).  Lola Bayer, the Director of Nursing for the Jail, also testified that nursing staff \nreceive no specialized training in recognizing and triaging dental complaints from \nCFMG.  (Bayer Depo Trans. 72:4-20.).  If CFMG is not willing to agree to an oral \nscreening by a dentist for all prisoners, it must agree to adequately train those providers \nwho will be completing the initial health inventory to comply with NCCHC standards. \n11.  The dentist must also adequately supervise and conduct regular reviews of \ncompleted Health Inventory forms to ensure that mid-level providers are conducting \nappropriate and adequate oral screenings.  The implementation plan must include a \nrequirement for regular chart audits and review.   \n12.  Our dental expert identified systemic deficiencies in completion of the \nhealth inventory forms, which support the need for further training and closer review if \nnon-dentists who are to perform oral screenings.  Few of the records had anything noted \non this odontogram and none had adequate notations describing the patient’s oral health \nor diseases such as decay or soft tissue lesions or reasons for referral to the dentist.  Of \nthose with notations, the notations were often incorrect.  For example, Patient No. \n1402397 was eventually seen by the dentist for pain in tooth numbers 3 and 14.  But his \nRe-Admission Health Appraisal Form, dated 3/24/14, has tooth numbers 2 and 15 marked \nas “cracked.”  It is likely that the screener did not correctly chart the number of the \n“cracked” tooth because he or she lacked adequate dental training.  Furthermore, there \nwas no indication in this patient’s record that this finding, erroneous though it may be, \nled to any follow-up care—Patient No. 1402397 was not seen by a dentist until four \nmonths later, after the patient complained of dental pain through the sick call process (see \nabove discussion). \n// \n                                              \n2 Stefanac, S.J., Nesbit, S.P. Treatment Planning in Dentistry, St.Louis, \n2001,Mosby pp: 41-55. \n \n[2891284-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 22 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nNovember 19, 2015 \nPage 6 \n \n \nAccess to Dental Care \n13.  Per our expert’s review, responses to sick call slips presenting dental needs \nwere untimely and inadequate.  Of the dental records reviewed, eight out of seventeen \npatients (47%) were not assessed by a nurse within 24 hours of the submitting a sick slip \ncomplaining of pain falling below published standards of care.3  Ten (58%) apparently \ndid not have their pain managed or stabilized adequately with the medications prescribed \nby the medical staff, as they later filed additional sick call slips.  Nine (52%) waited more \nthan one week from the submission of a sick slip to be evaluated by the dentist, causing \nunnecessary suffering, risk of infection, and deterioration of their health due to a \ndecreased ability to chew food due to inability to put pressure on the painful tooth.    \n14.  Twelve out of the fifteen patients who accepted care (or 80%) did not have \ntheir problem resolved during the first visit with the dentist.  These repeated delays in the \nmanagement of urgent care patients complaining of dental pain and/or infection places \nthe patients at risk for serious harm as urgent problems remain unaddressed. \n15.  As discussed above, CFMG must fully implement a dental classification \npriority code (DPC) system.  Dr. Coolidge testified that he is familiar with the system \nused for this purpose by the CDCR.  However, Dr. Coolidge testified that he does not \naudit the dental records to make sure that patients are treated within the timeframe \ncreated by the DPC system, but that he does maintains a calendar of dental patients to \ncreate a list of patients who need to be seen by a certain date based on their DPC code.  \n(Coolidge Depo 106:16-107:4.).   \n16.  In practice, however, CFMG lacks the dental resources to meet the \nstandards set forth by the DPC system.  The following are examples of egregious delays \nin accessing care found by our dental expert. \n  Patient No. 1402397 submitted a sick slip on 7/2/14 requesting to have “3 broken \nmolars removed.”   \n  There was a nurse note in the progress notes dated 7/3/14 that this patient \nrequested treatment for “3 broken molars” with pain rated at “7/10.”  This \npatient was assigned as Priority 2 under the CFMG Standardized Nursing \n                                              \n3 Shulman J.D., Sauter D.T.

Bertling \nNovember 19, 2015 \nPage 7 \n \n \nProcedures (SNP), which specifies the patients should be seen within two to \nthree weeks.  An assignment of Priority 2 is inconsistent with CFMG’s \nSNP for this level of pain.  Priority 1 would be more appropriate, as it \nincludes “Patient complains of constant severe pain” as a criteria for “next \ndental line.”  The nurse prescribed Tylenol 325 mg two tablets twice per \nday for 10 days.  This prescription had to be renewed on 7/16/14 because \nthe patient was still waiting to see the dentist.   \n  The patient was finally evaluated by the dentist on 7/17/14, or 15 days after \nfiling his initial complaint.  The dentist’s note stated that tooth “#s 3, 14 are \nfractured to the gum line, gross decay present.”  The dentist further \nindicated that these teeth were non-restorable and noted “NV: Exts” (next \nvisit: extractions).   \n  The patient again submitted a sick slip to be seen for a complaint of dental \npain on 11/17/14 and was evaluated by an MLP on 11/18/14.  The MLP \nprescribed ibuprofen for his pain complaint.  The patient was seen and \nevaluated by the dentist on 11/20/14.  The dentist once again determined \nthat tooth #3 and #14 needed to be extracted but did not perform the \nextraction that day.  Instead, the dentist opted to refer the patient to an oral \nsurgeon, a referral which the dentist did not deem necessary back in July.   \n  The patient continued to have pain and requested ibuprofen multiple times \nbefore the oral surgeon finally extracted the tooth on 12/14/14, 27 days \nfollowing the complaint on 11/17/14, and 165 days after the patient’s initial \ncomplaint of pain.  This patient was forced to endure pain and potential \nserious harm from a dental infection for over 5 months due to an \nunnecessary delay in receiving dental treatment.4 \n  Patient No. 1411990 was examined by Dr. Coolidge on January 5, 2015 and given \nthe DPC code “1B.”  A patient with a DPC code of “1B” is supposed to be seen \nwithin 30 calendar days.  Dr. Coolidge’s calendar has this patient scheduled for a \nfollow up by February 6, or 32 days after his triage appointment.   \n                                              \n4 Shulman J.D., Sauter D.T.

Bertling \nNovember 19, 2015 \nPage 8 \n \n \n  However, the dental progress notes indicate that Patient No. 1411990 was \nnot seen again until March 5, or 59 days after his original triage \nappointment.  At this next visit, Dr. Coolidge did not perform the \nextraction, but instead reexamined the patient, taking an x-ray this time, and \ndetermined that he should be sent to an oral surgeon.  The “Treatment Plan” \nfor this March 5 visit states “NV [Next Visit]: Refer to OS [oral surgeon]” \nwith the DPC code “1C,” which requires follow up within 60 calendar days.   \n  In other words, Patient No. 1411990 was seen in January, determined to \nhave a dental need that required treatment by February, not seen again until \nMarch, and then had his dental issue pushed off yet again.  It appears that \nPatient No. 1411990 was treated by the oral surgeon on March 19, 2015, or \n73 days after his January 5 triage appointment. \n  Patient No. 1409993 submitted a request to be seen for a complaint of dental pain \non 10/20/14.  A nursing note indicated on 10/20/14: “no show for sick call per \ndeputy”.  The patient submitted subsequent sick slips complaining of dental pain \non 11/19/14, 11/23/14, and 12/3/14.   \n  The patient’s record shows that he was not seen until 11/21/14, or more \nthan a month after submitting his first sick call slip.  When he was finally \nseen the nurse noted “severe pain,” “without [symbol] significant \nswelling.”  His vital signs indicated no fever.  There was also no note \ndiscussing examination for lymphadenopathy, another marker for dental \ninfection.  Despite the insufficient documentation in the record to support \nthe prescription of antibiotics, the patient was prescribed Pen V K 1Gram \ntwice per day for 7 days, Flagyl 500 mg twice per day for 3 days, and \nibuprofen 600 mg twice per day for 14 days.   \n  The medications obviously failed to stabilize the patient’s dental pain, as he \nsubmitted an additional sick slip complaint on 12/3/14, twelve days after \nreceiving the medications.  On 12/4/14, he was prescribed Augmentin \n875mg twice per day for 10 days, Flagyl 500 mg twice per day for 10 days, \nibuprofen 800 mg twice per day for 14 days to follow with ibuprofen 600 \nmg twice per day for 7 days, and Prilosec 20 mg once per day for 21 days.   \n  The dentist saw this patient again on 11/26/14, 37 days after the patient’s \ninitial complaint.  The dentist determined tooth #14 needed extraction.  He \n \n[2891284-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 25 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nNovember 19, 2015 \nPage 9 \n \n \nalso stated that #18 and #30 were grossly decayed and drew a line through \nthe teeth on the odontogram indicating they too needed to be extracted.   \n  Tooth #14 was finally extracted on 12/30/14, or fully 71 days following the \ninitial complaint.  There is no record that tooth #s 18 or 30 were extracted \nbefore our expert reviewed the record on March 23, 2015, despite the \ndentist’s finding that they were non-restorable.   \nCare Other than Extractions \n   \n17.  Our October 16 letter at pages 4-5 described specific standards for the \nprovision of dental care other than extractions.  In particular, the NCCHC requires an oral \nexamination by a dentist within 12 months of admission.  See NCCHC Standaard J-E-06.  \nHowever, of the records reviewed none of the patients who had been at MCJ twelve or \nmore months had a full dental/oral examination.   \n18.  The following findings from our dental expert’s survey support of our \ndetailed comments in the October 16 letter and our position that the Jail lacks adequate \nprocedures to ensure that it complies with constitutional and correctional standards \nrequiring the provision of routine care other than extractions.  The implementation plan \nmust address these issues. \n  Patient No. 1304572 exemplifies the lack of necessary routine care for \nlong-term inmates at MCJ.  The following are the findings of our dental \nexpert’s review of this patient:  \n  This patient’s most recent intake screening form was completed on \n5/23/13.  No notation of dental problems exists on the intake \nassessments.  Yet within five days of entering the Jail, or on 5/28/13, \nthe patient submitted a sick slip complaining of dental pain.  This \ncomplaint went unaddressed, and the patient was forced to submit \nsubsequent sick slips on 5/31/13 and 6/7/13.   \n  The patient was finally evaluated by the PA 6/11/13 and referred as \n“dental level 1.”  CFMG’s Standardized Nursing Procedures dictate \nthat a Dental Level 1 referral should be seen at the next dental sick \nline.  Yet, the patient was not offered a dental appointment until \n7/11/13, or one month later.  In the meantime, the patient submitted \ntwo additional sick slips, on 6/28/13 and 7/3/13 (written on notebook \n \n[2891284-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 26 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nNovember 19, 2015 \nPage 10 \n \n \npaper), complaining of dental pain.  The patient refused the 7/11/13 \ndental visit, because, according to the record, the patient was on the \nphone to his mother at the time he was called by the custody staff to \nsee the dentist.  The patient then filed another sick slip on 7/17/13.   \n  He was seen by the dentist on 7/25/13 and complained of pain in \nteeth #s 2, 3 and 4.  The progress note from this visit noted “no \ndecay,” but no radiographs were taken to confirm the diagnosis.  No \ndefinitive treatment was provided.  The patient was not scheduled \nfor any follow-up visit.   \n  The patient once again submitted a sick slip on 8/29/13 and 9/12/13 \ncomplaining of dental pain.  Again, there is no indication in the \nrecord why the patient was not seen after the 8/29/13 sick slip.  The \ndentist saw him on 9/19/13.  The progress notes from this visit are \nextremely difficult to read.  On 9/26/13, the dentist’s progress notes \nindicated that he placed “temporary fillings” in tooth #3 MO, #4 DO, \n#5 DO.  The letters next to the numbers indicate the surfaces of the \nteeth restored.   \n  On 5/16/14, or almost a year after his first sick slip, the patient again \nsubmitted a sick slip complaining of dental pain.  He was seen by the \ndentist on 5/22/14, who recorded in the progress notes that the \npatient complained, “My gums are bleeding and sensitive.”   \n  The patient was seen on 7/31/14 and the dentist scaled the upper \nteeth to remove plaque.  Since he did not scale the lower teeth or \npolish the teeth this does not qualify as a dental prophylaxis, which \nis a multi-step process.  No exam with radiographs was performed \neven though the patient had been in custody over 12 months at this \ntime.  The NCCHC requires an oral examination by a dentist within \n12 months of admission.  See NCCHC Standaard J-E-06.   \n  The patent submitted a sick slip on 12/24/14 complaining his teeth \nhurt.  He was seen on 1/5/15 and the dentist noted that the temporary \nfilling placed in 2013 was loose.  He scheduled the patient to return \non 1/29/15 and replaced the temporary filling with another \ntemporary filling.  The dentist performed no exam nor did he \nindicate that any radiographs were taken at this visit. \n \n[2891284-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 27 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nNovember 19, 2015 \nPage 11 \n \n \n  This patient was in custody for 22 months at the time of our expert’s \nreview.  As of that day, he had yet to receive a full dental exam, \nappropriate full mouth diagnostic radiographs, a full dental \nprophylaxis, or any fillings other than temporary ones—which failed \nto last him through his detention at MCJ.  This patient’s record noted \nno oral cancer screening or PSR.  The recent progress notes had no \ndiscussion about the patient’s dental hygiene or the status of the \nperiodontitis diagnosed in 2014.   \n  The dental treatment received by Patient No. 1308830 illustrates many of the \ninadequacies of MCJ’s extraction policy.   \n  This patient’s chart contained a blue sick slip dated 10/4/13 and drafted by \na MLP referring the patient to see the dentist for “Dental #1.”  The dentist \nsaw Patient No. 1308830 on 10/10/13 and again 11/1/13 to evaluate his \nbroken teeth.  Lines were drawn on the odontogram through tooth #s 1, 29, \n30, and 31, indicating the need to extract all four teeth.  However, the \nrecord contains no radiographs that could verify whether the teeth were \nnon-restorable.   \n  On 11/1/13, the dentist extracted tooth #s 1 and 31, per the patient’s \nrequest.  On 11/14/13, or 41 days after the blue sick slip was created, the \npatient returned to the dental clinic complaining, according to the dentist’s \nprogress notes, that “it still doesn’t feel like it’s gotten better.”  The dentist \nnoted that the “ext(raction) site #31 was red, bossy and had purulent \nexudate coming from the socket when palpated.”  This suggests an \ninfection.  The dentist prescribed antibiotics.  Once again, there were no \nradiographs in the patient’s record and no notation of any taken.  The \nstandard of dental care dictates that a radiograph should be taken if these \nsorts of symptoms appear after an extraction.  A radiograph can determine \nif a root tip or other abnormality had developed, which can indicate \nconditions requiring further treatment. \n  The patient received no follow up dental care for this post-operative \ninfection or for the two teeth that had been identified as needing extraction \nbut that remained. \n  The patient did not see the dentist again until 10/23/14.  The patient again \ncomplained about tooth #s 29 and 30, which had been identified as \n \n[2891284-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 28 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nNovember 19, 2015 \nPage 12 \n \n \nproblematic a year previously.  One month later, or on 11/20/14, the \ndentist’s progress notes documented that tooth #s 12 and 14 now needed \nextraction in addition to #s 29 and 30.  No decay was charted for these teeth \non the odontogram from 2013; a year later they were deemed non-\nrestorable.   \n  The patient chart indicated that the dentist referred the patient to an oral \nsurgeon on 11/20/14 for the extractions, more than a year after the initial \nreferral.  The patient saw the oral surgeon on 12/9/14.  The oral surgeon \nprescribed amoxicillin (500 mg three times a day for seven days), ibuprofen \n(600 mg three times a day for five days), and Norco 5/325 (once a day for \nthree days).  According to the patient’s medication administration records \nthat the Jail failed to provide the Norco 5/325, despite the oral surgeon’s \nprescription.   \n  Patient No. 1400306 provides another example of MCJ’s deficient long-term care.   \n  This patient entered the Jail on 1/10/14.  His intake forms recorded \nthat he had 8 teeth removed just prior to intake at MCJ.  Yet the \nodontogram completed on 1/16/14 does not indicate this.  There are \ncircles around teeth #s 17-21 and 28-32—but the diagnostic code \nbelow the odontogram in the patient’s record does not indicate what \na “circle” is supposed to mean.  A missing tooth is supposed to be \nindicated by an “x.”  A subsequent Jail Re-Admission Health \nAppraisal form is dated 1/23/14 and has “N/A” written in the dental \nsection, with no other notations in the dental portion.    \n  This patient had several dental sick slips in his record.  He was seen \nand evaluated by the dentist on 1/16/14, 3/13/14, 3/27/14, 4/10/14 \nand 9/25/14.  Extractions were offered of tooth #s 25 and 27 and a \nradiograph was present in the record.  The dentist considered the \nteeth non-restorable.  The patient refused the extraction of lower \nfront teeth #25 and #27 on 4/17/14.  The patient was offered \nextraction of upper front tooth #7 on 9/25/14.  No radiograph was \npresent of this tooth.  The patient refused the extraction.  \n  There is no evidence that patient was offered replacement of lost \nteeth once he had served over 12 months.  Although the patient \nrefused episodic care in the form of extraction of teeth it cannot be \n \n[2891284-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 29 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nNovember 19, 2015 \nPage 13 \n \n \nassumed that the patient would not have wanted more \ncomprehensive care to include the restoration of salvageable teeth \nalong with the replacement of those that are needed to chew and \nspeak. This patient’s records had no documentation of a full dental \nexamination, full dental diagnostic radiographs, oral cancer \nscreening, PSR, dental prophylaxis, restorative care in the form of \npermanent fillings and replacement of teeth needed to eat and speak. \n19.  Dr. Coolidge testified that he performs oral cancer screenings and \nperiodontal screenings.  (Coolidge Depo Transcript, p. 128.)  However, none of the \nrecords that our expert reviewed contained any evidence that MCJ had actually \nperformed these screenings for any patient.  \n20.  CFMG’s own documents reveal that it has long been aware of the unmet \nneed for dental care in its facilities. Other dentists from other CFMG facilities have \nexpressed grave concern over the working conditions created by CFMG’s dental policies \nand procedures.  An April 4, 2014 email from CFMG dentist William M. Reuss DDS to \nTaylor Fithian MD stated: \nRonni, Kevin [Coolidge], and I are in full agreement that it is urgent to \ninitiate tangible progress in updating our policies and procedures for the \ndelivery of dental care in all CFMG facilities.  Inmates with sentences \ngreater than six months need dental care beyond the scope of our \ncurrent policy/procedures.  Each week I see urgent needs that beg \nattention but go untreated because of current policy.  This fact \nheightens our professional/corporate risk exposure.  Our \nrecommendation is to immediately initiate three pilot programs to \ndevelop/test/document updated dental policy/procedures.  At Shasta that \nwould include dental screening by RDA. \nI am feeling the pressure of professional liability risks due to escalating \nnumbers of dental visits each week.  In all my professional dental career \n(42 years), I have never worked harder.  Melinda my RDA feels the \nsame.  We need more hours to provide timely care to urgent dental \nneeds.   \nExhibit D. \n \n[2891284-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 30 of 91\n \nSusan K. Blitch \nPeter G. Bertling \nNovember 19, 2015 \nPage 14 \n \n \n21.  Drs. Coolidge and Reuss were members of a CFMG Dental Task Force, \nwhich was formed sometime in 2013.  After significant delays, the group submitted \nstrong recommendations to improve the access and levels of dental care provided at \nCFMG staffed facilities to include MCJ.  During the May 29, 2014 quality assurance \nmeeting, “Dr. Fithian noted that a dental committee including Dr. Coolidge has gathered \nand provided recommendations for inmate care for those in custody longer than twelve \nmonths.  He said that CFMG staff are currently reviewing those recommendations and \nwill have those out soon.”  Exhibit E.  Despite Dr. Fithian’s promise that these \nrecommendations will be “out soon,” no documents were produced in discovery \nreflecting any change to dental policy has occurred at MCJ in the year since the Dental \nTask Force submitted their recommendations.  Nor does the draft dental implementation \nplan address these concerns. \nFacilities and Material Issues \n22.  During our dental expert’s tour, there were no materials present in the \nDental Clinic would allow for permanent restoration of the chewing surfaces of the teeth \nsuch as composite or amalgam.  There also was not a curing light in the dental room, \nwhich is necessary to cure composite fillings when they are placed.  The Dental \nInventory List did not include a curing light or permanent filling materials.  The clinic did \nhave glass ionomer and IRM (“Intermediate Restorative Material” made up of zinc oxide \nand eugenol) materials.  These are sufficient for temporary fillings of chewing surfaces—\nbut not for permanent fillings, due to their lack of compressive strength and wear \nresistance.5  Temporary fillings may be adequate to respond to urgent needs of short-term \ninmates who will be released within a few days or weeks.  But longer-term inmates will \nhave recurring problems, which will simply not be solved by the IRM or glass ionomer \nfilling materials present in the dental area. \n23.  As detailed in our letter of October 16, our dental expert’s review identified \nseveral urgent deficiencies in the available dental treatment space and equipment.  The \nimplementation plan remains silent on these issues. \n                                              \n5 Anusavice, K.J., Shen, C., Rawls, H.R.

The autoclave and the space around it for removal of sterilized \ninstruments are just inches from the head of the dental chair when it is reclined.  The area \naround the head of the dental chair is an active operating field, in which large particle \nspatter and aerosols of blood and bodily fluids are dispersed during dental procedures6.  It \nis not safe to put the autoclave and the autoclave work area inside this operating field.  \nThis inevitably leads to contamination of instruments. \nb.  The entire sterilization set up is dangerous for several reasons.  First, \ninstruments are hand-scrubbed, without the use of the types of gloves recommended by \nthe CDC for hand-scrubbing.  This hazard can be remediated by switching to ultrasonic \npre-cleaning.  Second, the entire area lacks biohazard labelling where needed.  Third, and \nworst of all, the clinic is set up so that clean instruction and work area around the \nautoclave is set up such that clean instruments—which must be near the chair so the \nassistant can hand them to the dentist—must be passed across the path where dirty \ninstruments are transported.  This is contrary to the standard of care and risks cross-\ncontamination, placing the patient at increased risk of infection. \nc.  The dentist relies on an ADEC PAC 1 handpiece delivery system \nthat is suitable for temporary use in a mobile clinic, but is not suitable for long-term use.  \n(It appears to have been in use at the jail since 2007.)  Dr. Coolidge testified that the \nsystem cannot maintain enough air pressure to run drilling tools consistently.  This \nmachine must be  replaced.  The existing unit cannot be used for providing care beyond \nextractions. \nd.  The backup autoclave system—a machine in Dr. Coolidge’s trunk \nfor which there are no sterilization monitoring records—is not consistent with minimal \ninfection control practices. \n24.  The plan still does not address adequate access to dental hygiene supplies.  \nTo more specifically explain our position on access to supplies: Floss Loops are on the \nJail’s commissary list, with a pack of 30 loops listed at $7.29.  Our expert consulted the \nmanufacturer of Floss Loops and determined that MCJ can purchase them for $1.78 per \npackage of 30 delivered, or $5.51 less than the cost to prisoners.  Inmates need access to \nbasic oral hygiene products like Floss Loops in order to clean in between their teeth and \naround and under the gums.  The MCJ price for Floss Loops seems excessive and \nprovides a strong disincentive for inmates to exercise proper preventive dental self-care.   \n                                              \n6 http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/faq/aerosols.htm \n \n[2891284-1] \n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 32 of 91\n \nSusan K.

Dr. Fithian discussed a recent \ndeath that occurred at another contract site involving an individual who probably had \nmethamphetamine toxicity, which resulted  in excited  delirium and  sudden in-custody \ndeath. \nStatistical Review \nProgram Manager Dave Harness reviewed the statistics for the past quarter.  Handouts \nwere disseminated for the adult facility, juvenile hall and youth center.  The statistics are \nattached to the minutes. \nCFMG 002535\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 35 of 91\nMental Health Services \nDr.  Fithian  gave  an  overview  of mental  health  services  over  the  past  qum1er.  The \nsocialization  program  is  up  and  mnning  and  meeting  the  needs  of the  chronically \nmentally  ill who  are  in  isolation.  The  program  has proven  to  be  very effective in \ndecreasing management problems and addressing socialization needs for the chronically \nmentally ill. \nDr.  Fithian  expressed  continued  support  and  appreciation  for  the  relationship  \\vith \nMonterey County Behavioral Health and the Natividad Medical Center Mental Health \nUnit.  Access  to  care  and  continuity of care is  facilitated  by  that cooperation  and \nlongstanding partnership. \nDr. Fithian also reviewed two patients who returned from Atascadero State Hospital as \ntrial competent under p.e. 1370.  TI10se patients remain compliant on treatment. \nThere was one 5150 that was referred offsite during the past quarter, and one individual \nwho was transferred offsite under P.C. 40] 1.6. \nAt all times a number of inmates remain in custody who are pending transfer either to the \nstate hospital system under P.e. 1368 or to the Natividad Medical Center Behavioral \nHealth Unit under p.e. 1370. \nPublic Health \nMary  Gustus  noted  that  there  is  an  increase  in  contact  investigations  involving \ntuberculosis. \nSandra Gonzales talked about an increased prevalence of measles.  She also stated ihat a \nTdap clinic would be instituted. \nMonica  Sweeney  stated  that  minors  are  given  Tdap  at  the  time  of their  96-hour \nassessment.  The vaccines are received from Public Health once a week and those that are \nnot utilized are returned to Public Health. \nDr. Fithian discussed a case that he is involved with as an expert regarding tuberculosis. \nDr. Fithian emphasized the importance of dating and timing the application of TB skin \ntests and when they are read.  A minimum of 48 hours between application and reading \nof tests is mandatory. \nPharmacy \nDave Harness reported that the annual phannaceutical inspection occurred in February at \nall three facilities, the jail, juvenile ball, and youth center.  The report has been provided \nto Probation and will be given to Chief Budd. \nCFMG 002536\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 36 of 91\nSherifPs Department \nSheriff Miller stated that from his standpoint things are going well.  He reported that the \nsuit that was pending regarding an in-custody death involving Mr.  as gone to a \nclaim against the county. \nChief Budd also noted that things are going well and he is not aware of any significant \nissues at this time. \nProbation: \nDental: \nDr. Kevin Coolidge had no issues to repmi.  He stated that there are enough dental needs \namong the adult population to require a full time dentist.  Apparently there is no end to the \ndental needs for this population.  Those needs that are urgent and emergent are addressed. \nProtocols are utilized to treat those individuals who complain of dental pain until the \ndentist can see them. \nDr. Coolidge briefly discussed what he called a \"dental crisis\" throughout California in \naddressing the dental needs of youth. \nGrievances \nDave Harness discussed the grievances for the past quarter.  There were a total of 70 \ngrievances for the past three months.  Two of those were sustained.

Update - CMA IMQ Accreditation \nBarbara Cotton is here today, doing her pre-survey evaluation.  The findings  will  be \naddressed after their receipt. \n2.  Fulltime Psychiatric RN \nrVlonterey Q_t._ Meeting Minutes 08.30.2012  Paged \nCFMG 002583\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 46 of 91\nA candidate has been selected for the fulltime psychiatric RN position.  It was noted that \nthe candidate has experience in the correctional mental health setting, and is currently just \npending a background check. \nToday's Agenda \nIn-Custody Deaths: \nThere were no in-custody deaths during the past quarter. \nHospitalized Patients: \nThe case of (  , who is currently an in-patient at Natividad Medical Center \nwith a polydrug ingestion and overdose, was reviewed.  His case brought up the point \nfrom Mr. Harness that an investigation regarding his medications is being looked into, \nand that a need to enhance both medical and custody staff assistance in checking that \npatients are ingesting their medications was stated. \nStatistical Review \nHandouts were disseminated for the facilities and they are attached in the minutes.  Of \nnote  were  a  couple  of statistics  that  stood  out,  including  the  doubling  of reported \nectoparasites/scabies for the month of July, and this was discussed. \nMental Health Services \nElaine Finnberg remarked about the busy nature of our services requests.  She noted that \na particular problem was inmates coming to jail on psychiatric meds after usually single \ndoctor visits on the outside, and that often these meds require detox treatment.  She noted \nthat most of the inmates she sees were felt to have an adjustment problem more than a \npsychiatric  disorder.  Kim  Spano  supported those  thoughts,  noting  the  difficulty  of \npatients feeling entitled to non-necessary medications. \nPublic Health I Infectious Disease \nMary Gustus reported that Jacqueline Sedgwick, MD, has taken over in the position of \nthe recently retired Dr. Tezak.  She noted that other staffing is unchanged.  Mary also \nnoted that her TB department is following eleven active cases with several contacts each. \nSandra Gonzales noted that her STD/Cornmunicable Disease department has seen an \nincrease in active syphilis cases, particularly in males having sex with males popUlation. \nDr. Garcia reviewed the newly released treatment guidelines from the CDC on gonorrhea. \nIn particular those guidelines state that for uncomplicated genital, rectal, and pharyngeal \ngonorrhea, the CDC recommends a combination therapy with Ceftriaxone 250 mg. as a \nsingle 1M dose, plus Azithromycin one gram orally in a single dose.  It is noted that \nCefixime 400 mg orally can be used in place of Ceftriaxone if not available, but because \nof increased resistance with Cefixime, Ceftriaxone is preferred, and that Doxycycline 100 \nMonterey QA Meetin\"g Minutes 08.30.2012  Page 2 \nCFMG 002584\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 47 of 91\nmg. twice a day for seven days can be used in place of the Azithromycin one gram orally \nas a single dose, but again the Azithromycin is preferred.  In the case where an allergy \nexists to cephalosporins, the CDC recommends a single two-gram dose of Azithromycin \norally.  Also in the guidelines is a new suggested requirement testing for cure one week \nafter  treatment.  This  can  be  done  with  standard  urine  testing  for  asymptomatic \nindividuals, but in symptomatic individuals' pre-treatment, a culture should be obtained \none week after treatment to again test for cure. \nPharmacy: \nNew pharmaceutical services from  the Diamond Corporation of Pennsylvania will  be \nstarting September 1,  2012.  The change was made because of an  improved pricing \nstructure.  The challenges that may exist would be a need to improve our ordering as the \nnext day receipt of medications that we have been used to with ANB Pharmacy will not \nbe as likely with this new service. \nSheriff's Department \nCaptain Jeff Budd presented several issues.  The number of AB 109 inmates has reached \n185.  Of those, most are 1170H inmates long-term at half time sentences, the so-called \nnon non nons; however, there are currently several 3056 (parole violators), 47 of them \nunsentenced, 55 doing 90 days.  The other class of AB 109, the 3454 and 3455 so-called \nflash incarcerations has not been a problem as there are very few. \nCaptain Budd noted that there are three long-term sentenced inmates serving 7 Y:z  year \nsentences here at Monterey County Jail, and he will hopefully be transferring those to \nDelano when an agreement has been worked out. \nCaptain Budd also noted a newly passed assembly bill that allows for an early release \nkick of ten percent up to a maximum of 30 days for those inmates sentenced for a year or \nmore.  He anticipates going through the rolls and taking those inmates out of custody as \nsoon as possible. \nIn a review of the grievance process, Captain Budd stated that he feels the EEOC is being \nused as an extension of the grievance process without any other benefit, and will look \ninto whether its use will be further continued. \nCaptain Budd stated that forty million dollars in funding has been secured for a new 288-\nbed medium to maximum security wing here at Monterey County Jail.  It is expected to \nbe two tiers with double cells.  A medical treatment room will be in the wing and he \nexpects that it will be built in approximately four years. \nAn ending note from Captain Budd was that he will be retiring on December 28, 2012 \nand is looking forward to that. \nProbation: \nMonterey QA Meeting Minutes 08.30.2012  Page 3 . \nCFMG 002585\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 48 of 91\nDental Services: \nDr. Kevin Coolidge commented on his own statistics.  There are approximately 40 plus \non his list every week; of that he is able to see about 25 inmates in his single day a week \npractice here at Monterey County Jail.  Of those 25, he  is noting seven are AB  109 \npatients.  Also  of note  is  that  Dave  Harness  and  Dr.  Coolidge  have  changed  the \nstandardized procedure for  treatment of dental abscesses  to  include a bid versus  qid \ndosing  schedule  for  penicillin,  and  again  those  will  be  instituted  in  the  nursing \nstandardized procedure manual. \nGrievances \nThe month of July saw a doubling up to 42 grievances.  Most of those were felt to be \nnon-sustainable grievances that relate to issues already discussed.  The possibility of a \nspecial  session  to  address  particularly  difficult  inmates  and  grievances  is  being \ninvestigated by Dr. Garcia with Mr. Harness and other members of the medical staff to \nhopefully include custody commander staff as well. \nCQI \nAs mentioned earlier, Barbara Cotton is here on August 30, 2012 doing her pre-survey \nIMQ evaluation.  Also of note is that monthly audits continue to be done by Dr. Garcia \nfor medical, Dr.  Fithian for psychiatric, and Maureen jointly with custody staff.  Ida \nParker also does general chart audits on a monthly basis as well.  Dr. Castellanos, who \ndoes peer review, is being scheduled for this next quarter. \nOther: \nRobert Jackson from Behavioral Health was in attendance and gave a follow-up report of \na prior inmate patient of ours,.  _  who again currently is at Patton State \nl \nHospital with two to one staffing, maintained in chains, and placed to sleep in five-point \nrestraints.  Despite this and what is considered maximum dosing of medications, he has \nassaulted 28 staff members and is being transferred to a different facility as they feel they \nare unable to care for him there. \nMr. Jackson also noted that two grants have been received, one to establish a physical \nmedical practitioner at  the  behavioral  health clinic,  and  the  second to  start an  early \nintervention program with acronym PREP for first break psychiatric patients in the 15 to \nMonterey QA Meeting Minutes 08.30.2012  Page.4. \nCFMG 002586\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 49 of 91\n27-year-old age group to initiate early treatment.  He also noted that in response to AB \n109  there  has  been  increased  staffing at  the  probation  department  clinic  where  they \noperate psych services. \nDr. Garcia announced that CFMG had been awarded the contract in Santa Cruz County \nfor medical services, and that that was due to start on September 14, 2012, which makes \n26 counties where CFMG is the provider. \nAlso noted was that Stanislaus County, which had been a long-tenn 20-year contact with \nCFMG that had been changed with the advent of a new sheriff four years ago, is currently \nup for bid and CFMG has been invited to enter that process. \nThe third item noted was that STC training has started, two sessions, July 23 and August \n6, 2012 have been completed, with four remaining sessions on September 25, October 8 \nand 9, 2012, and a final January 7, 2013. \nThere being no further business the meeting was adjourned. \nEliud Garcia, M.D. \nAttachments: \nStatistics \nMonterey QA Meeting Minutes 08.30.2012  p ag.e  ~ \n.J.  oJ\" \nCFMG 002587\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 50 of 91\n_=--,C.....,FMt.\",,;;;,G_  _ \nCalifornia Forensic Medical Group \nINCOIPOII:\"TfD \nAGENDA \nQUALITY ASSURANCEIPEER REVIEW COMMITTEE MEETING \nMONTEREY COUNTY JAIL AND JUVENILE HALL SERVICES \nAugust 16, 2012 \n12:00 noon \nA.

He indicated he had not sought further legal investigation as the patient had \nbeen released.  In general it was felt that future similar situations would support use of \nCounty Counsel for legal support and directing care. \nCommander  Bass  noted  that  the  two  civilian  positions;  an  ombudsman,  and  a  re \nintegration facilitator, mentioned at the last meeting had been filled.  Many of us have \nmet both individuals and look forward to having them attend future QA Meetings. \nMonterey Co. QA Meeting Minutes 9-30-2014  Page 1 \nCFMG 002663\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 55 of 91\nIn-custody Deaths: \nThere were no irunate deaths during the past quarter. \nHospitalized Patients: \nTwo cases were briefly reviewed.  One involved a female currently in the obstetrics unit \nat Natividad Medical Center, who had had a c-section and was due for release back to jail \non September 19.  The other is a patient scheduled for an eighteen-week therapeutic AB \nscheduled at Stanford. \nCommander Bass noted that he and the jail chief had a recent meeting with Monterey \nCounty Social Services members hoping to facilitate imnate enrollment to Medi-Cal for \nthose  hospitalized  irunate  patients.  This  could  likely  result  in  significant  revenue \nremuneration for the sheriffs office.  Additionally, future efforts for irunates' Medi Cal \nenrollment upon release from custody would be a program that would hope to gamer \nsupport. \nStatistics: \nDave Harness provided workload statistics and offsite usage numbers for the past quarter. \nNotable was a sharp rise in EMT referrals related to facial trauma and due to fights and \nassaults. \nStatistical review showed average range of patients seen to be: \n65 to 100 patients per workday for medical department's three providers \n30 to 40 patients per workday for psychiatric services three to four providers \nAverage of 45 patients per workday for nursing procedures \nThe above numbers are done with the custody assistance of one daytime medical deputy \nand  about a three-hour psych dedicated deputy  in  the morning.  Unfortunately those \ndeputies are sometimes called away.  Commander Bass provided welcome news in light \nof the  obvious  need  for  further  deputy  assistance,  an  issue  that has  frequently  been \ncommented on in these QA meetings, that the Board of Supervisors on September 17th \nvoted to fund  eleven new deputy positions largely for medical  staff support.  Elaine \nHustedt  noted  that  Telepsych  and  Telemed  services  for  infectious  diseases  and \ndermatology has been approved by jail staff and will be available in the future further \nreducing the requirement for off-site transportation need. \nMental Health: \nCharlotte, Gage,  Psychiatric RN provided more  specific numbers for the past quarter \nrelated to psych services including 831  psychiatrist/psychologist contacts, 1,289 mental \nhealth worker contacts. \nMonterey Co. QA Meeting Minutes 9-30-2014  Page 2 \nCFMG 002664\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 56 of 91\nSafety cell placement and clearances of 148 suicide watch, 104 single cell, 40 combative \nbehavior, in  addition to  others.  Also noted were 21  returning patients from the state \nhospital system in the past quarter.  Of particular note is that 17% of Monterey County's \njail inmate population is receiving psychiatric medications. \nNatividad Medical Center's new policy requiring jail inmate referred patients to  their \npsychiatric inpatient service have 24-hour security and first go through the emergency \ndepartment for screening was commented on.  This has caused significant effect to the \njail, in particular custody staff and usually the medical deputy  is the person who has \nrecently been asked to provide security for Natividad's hospitalized patients.  We are \nhopeful  that  relative  to  Mr.  Jackson's  prior  comments  that  future  policy  could  be \nindividualized in that all patients certainly are not in need of such security. \nAlso commented was the fact that Dr. Fithian had stopped doing COUli evaluations as of \nJuly 1,2014.  However, he has been pressed into service twelve times since July first, as \nno other professional staff was available to assist with Court evaluations. \nPublic Health / Infectious Disease: \nNo representatives from Monterey County Public Health Department were present.  Lola \nBayer, RN, noted that she has reviewed our TB screening program and it is compliant \nwith county public health standards.  Also noted was that the May 2014 gastroenteritis \noutbreak was determined to be Noro Virus.  Lola then introduced Simone Mevs, our new \nphysician assistant, and all members welcomed her. \nDave Harness noted that seasonal flu shots have been ordered and should arrive soon. \nMonica,  RN  from juvenile hall noted  that the  public health  department provides flu \nvaccine for minors and will ask if that could be extended to adults as well. \nPharmacy \nDave Harness passed on that Diamond  Corporation, our pharmaceutical  supplier, has \ninformed him of a pending Haldol Decanoate shortage.  He also noted that there are ten \ninmates  on FEQ  medications.  Most  are  HIV  patients  or renal  failure  patients  with \nspecialized medication needs. \nSheriff's Office \nCommander Bass stated that the grievance process is changing to \"an appeal process with \nmedical and non-medical forms.\"  These have recently been provided after careful review \nby County Counsel, in particular Mr. Grant.  Responses from these forms will go to Mr. \nDa Silva who will process them further taking custody staff out of the appeal/grievance \nprocess. \nMonterey Co. QA Meeting Minutes 9-30-2014  Page 3 \nCFMG 002665\n\nCase 5:13-cv-02354-BLF   Document 515-1   Filed 02/19/16   Page 57 of 91\nCommander Bass noted that there are nine inmates pending 1368 evaluations, which will \ntax deputy staffing further. \nProbation/Juvenile Hall \nDental \nDr. Coolidge stated that there are a typical number of 40 patients on his weekly list, and \ncurrently he is able to see about 20 of them. \nHe and his wife are expecting a baby soon and we all wished them very well. \nElaine Hustedt thanked Dr. Coolidge for his work on a dental panel that reviewed and \nsuggested standards for dental services at our jails.  Currently questionnaires are out to \nthe counties for input with a hope to have dental care outlines available by December.  At \nthe present time Title 15 does not address dental services. \nGrievances \nDave Harness noted that grievances have been constant at about 30 per month during the \npast quarter, which equates to a three percent rate.  Notable was an increase in grievances \nspecifically related to timeliness and \"attributable to access and availability.\" \nCQI \nLola thanked custody for \"doing what they can\" with short staffing.  She noted that her \naudits have demonstrated good outcome numbers. \nOther \nThe Sacramento Bee article of September 8, 2014 was summarized for the group.  The \narticle related to  medical costs from AB  109 inmates, which have both increased the \nnumber of inmates in county jails and the number of inmate days in county jails with an \nassociated  increase in chronic care and complexity of problems.  The article investigators \nclaimed an average for the 58 California counties having an increased cost of medications \nof 21 %, an increased cost of off-site utilization of 32%, equating to  an average 53% \nincrease in medical costs, according to the article. \nMonterey Co.

Inmates with \nsentences greater than six months need dental care beyond the \nscope of our current policy/procedures. Each week I see urgent \nneeds that beg attention but go untreated because of current \npolicy. This fact heightens our professional/corporate risk \nexposure. Our recommendation is to immediately initiate three \npilot programs to develop/test/document updated dental \npolicy/procedures. At Shasta that would include dental screening \nby RDA. \nI am feeling the pressure of professional liability risks due to \nescalating numbers of dental visits each week. In all my \nprofessional dental career (42 years), I have never worked \nharder. Melinda my RDA feels the same.

I have offered a \nproposal (Dental Screening by RDA) that would significantly \nreduce costs and improve efficiency. This also equates to reduced \nstress, reduced liability risk, and boosted moral. This escalation in \nrequests for dental care is an established continuing pattern. I \nbelieve my colleagues would reflect like feelings. \nIt is my strong recommendation to initiate immediately three pilot \nprograms. More could be said but our recommendations await \nyour response. \nRespectfully, \nWilliam M.

Elaine Hustedt noted that there was \na misspelling on page two, number four for Dr. Puissus. \nDeaths \nExtemal peer review was done by Dr. Paul Genstler reviewing in-custody deaths of the \npast year.  Four cases were reviewed.  In general all four reviews noted that medical care \nwas appropriate; however, recommendations to include vital signs with each visit and a \ncheck of oxygen saturation for patients with pulmonary symptoms was made and agreed. \nMonterey Co.

Reports \nwere provided to members and are included in this packet.  Notable was an increase in \nadministered medications at the Youth Center that will be followed.  Two grievances at \njuvenile hall were noted and those issues were addressed. \nJose Ramirez commented on  a juvenile inmate who' \nMental Health Services \nPsychiatric  RN  Charlotte  Gage  introduced  new  therapist  Jaimey  Lee  to  the  group. \nJaimey outlined her experience in correctional mental health, and was welcomed. \nDr. Fithian expressed gratitude to the psych staff and Natividad psychiatric services in \ncaring for a very challenging patient population.  Noted were the increase in safety cell \nuse, and the 1368 transfers taking an average of 90 days.  Psychiatric services in the jail \nare getting to patients quickly, which is far better than psych patients at large receive in \nthe community. \nRobert Jackson from· Natividad psych services noted that his department has  seen an \nincrease in violent patients,  and reviewed the case of a jail referred patient who was \nmedicated  for  agitation,  slept  sixteen  hours,  and  upon  awakening  attacked  another \npatient.  The case prompted a review by the state and Natividad Medical Center to place a \npolicy that all Monterey County Jail inmate patients have 24-hour security, and that they \ngo through the emergency department for a screening evaluation before admission to the \nMonterey Co.

Mr. Jackson said he hopes that policy can be individualized, as it \nis  certainly  not  necessary  for  all  patients.  Both  Mr.  Jackson  and  Commander Bass \ncommented on how that will slow the process for patients.  It is estimated that 20 or 30 \npatients  are  refelTed  from  Monterey  County  to  Natividad  inpatient psych department \nyearly. \nCommander Bass noted the increase in violent inmates with a recent assault on a deputy \nstaff member.  Elaine Hustedt asked about using telepsychiatry to limit patient transfers. \nCommander Bass commented that the current jail chief is  not  in  favor  but  they  will \nreview and discuss with county counsel. \nPublic Health \nZonell Cantu  and  Angie Gladstone from  Monterey County  Public Health Department \nbrought up several issues. \nPertussis  in  Monterey  County  is  at  epidemic  levels  with  57  new case reports  since \nJanuary, and over 1700 cases statewide.  Most cases, approximately 89%, are in the under \n18-year-old population.  Tdap vaccine has not been  as  effective  as  expected.  Usual \neffectiveness seems to be lasting only about three years.  Current state recommendations \nare to provide Tdap vaccinations with each pregnancy. \nMeasles, 49 cases in California this year, over 200 nationally.  It appears to be a travel \nrelated communicable disease due to a large outbreak in the Philippines, however, there \nare two cases of non-immunized measles.  This is under large-scale state investigation. \nTuberculosis  The county has a new TB supervisor who is currently very busy. We wiII \ninvite her to our next QA meeting. \nSalmonella  There  is  an active and ongoing issue under investigation with  500 total \ncases, 400 in California related to Foster Farms chickens.  There have been no deaths due \nto Salmonella poisoning. \nCorona  Virus  - MRS  There  are  no  current  cases  m  Monterey  County;  however \nsurveillance continues. \nPharmacy \nDave Harness mentioned that Diamond Corporation, our phannaceutical supplier, will no \nlonger be mailing Actifed to California. This is thought to be related to tighter regulations \non  pseudoephedrine,  which  is  used  as  a  precursor  molecule  in  the  manufacture  of \nmethamphetamine.  Also Warfarin supply will be changed to a different manufacturer but \nshould not affect supply. \nMonterey Co. QA Meeting Minutes 5-29-2014  .

There will now be two deputies at each station \nand  inmate movement within the jail will occur with  inmates handcuffed  or in  belly \nchains.  The sheriff will be asking for increased staff and funding for staff due to  the \nheightened security  needs.  Commander Bass noted  that there  was a  \"change in  the \ncaliber of inmates\" with more violent acts.  He feels this is largely related to AB  109 \nincarcerants.  Commander Bass also noted in-custody depositions are ongoing regarding \nthe class action suit noted as Hernandez. \nDr. Fithian reiterated how telepsychiatry and telemedicine services would limit inmates \nbeing taken off-site and hopes that the chief will consider that aspect when reviewing \ntelemed services.  It was learned that the assaulted deputy has facial  lacerations and a \nconcussion but is doing okay and an expression to wish him well was made by medical \nstaff. \nProbation/Juvenile Hall \nDental \nDr.  Kevin  Coolidge  noted  how  inmates  with  prolonged  stays  are  requIrIng  time \nconsuming services, mostly teeth  cleaning and prophylaxis.  Dr. Fithian noted that a \ndental committee including Dr. Coolidge has gathered and provided recommendations for \ninmate care for those in custody longer than twelve months.  He said that CFMG staff are \ncurrently reviewing those recommendations and will have those out soon. \nGrievances \nDave Harness noted that there has been a decrease over the past quarter in grievances \nfiled.  He notes that most grievances reflect unhappiness on the part of the inmate with \nnot getting a particular treatment, especially a particular medication.  Commander Bass \nstated that he is currently interviewing for two civilian positions.  One is an omsbudsman \nto collect and track grievances.  The other is a community reintegration facilitator for \ncommunity programs.  There is  one candidate currently in the background checks for \nthose positions. \nMonterey Co.

Dr.  Hayward was here last week for a second look at psych services, with \nnothing new to report. \nOther \nDr. Garcia brought up the case of {  , a 19-year-old woman with a five \nmonth pregnancy who has gestational diabetes and  has been refusing all  medical care \nboth in jail and for outside appointments, lab and other fetal testing.  Dr. Garcia directed \na question to Mr. Grant of County Counsel as to whether her case should be presented to \nan administrative law judge for forced medical care in that medical case law has statute \nfor protection of the fetus.  Mr. Grant will be looking into the matter. \nIt was learned later that day that Ms.  .lad left custody that afternoon. \n1 \nDr. Garcia reviewed and brought members up to date with the case of Angel Perez who \nhas had a foot tumor for the past eight or more years and has had it recently resected at \nSanta Clara Valley Medical Center by an oncologic orthopedic surgeon.  Commander \nBass noted he is the first patient enrolled in the jail for Medi-Cal services, however, those \nwill not be effective for this recent outpatient surgery.  Mr. Jackson brought up the idea \nof \"presumptive  Medi-Cal\"  being  an  entity  that  may  be  helpful.  CFMG  staff in \nattendance will look into this further. \nThere being no further business the meeting was adjourned. \nEliud Garcia, MD \nAttachments: \nStatistics \nMonterey Co.
