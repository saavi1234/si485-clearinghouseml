It appears that the Latta decision controls the outcome of the cross-motions for summary judgment at dockets 47 and 58 in this case. Latta appears to require that the motion at docket 47 be granted, and the motion at docket 58 be denied. The court invites the parties each to submit a supplemental brief discussing how the Latta decision applies to the motions at dockets 47 and 58. The supplemental briefs should be filed not more than 7 days from the date of this order. This is a TEXT ENTRY ONLY. There is no PDF document associated with this entry. (JWS) (Entered: 10/09/2014)"

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court to declare that all Arizona laws banning same-sex marriages are unconstitutional, to compel the defendants to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, to award the plaintiffs nominal damages as well as the costs of suit and attorneys' fees. </p><p>In 1996, the state of Arizona banned same-sex marriage, and in 2008 this ban was added to the state constitution in The Marriage Protection Amendment. The plaintiffs claimed that Arizona's laws prohibiting the recognition of same-sex marriages targeted homosexuals for disfavored treatment and interfered with the flow of the plaintiffs' spousal benefits and their ability to build their families. They further allege that these laws violated their rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution.</p><p>On July 29, 2014, the District court (Judge John W. Sedwick) granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim for nominal damages, ruling that the Eleventh Amendment bars such claims from being brought against state officials. </p><p>On October 16, 2014, the District Court (Judge Sedwick) granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. The court ruled that Arizona's laws banning same sex marriage are unconstitutional in light of the Ninth Circuit's decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13141\">Latta v. Otter</a>, and entered a permanent injunction barring their enforcement. </p><p>The defendants filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on November 17, 2014. The parties stipulated that the appellate proceedings will be stayed until the Supreme Court's decision in the <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12811\">DeBoer</a> case.</p><p>The DeBoer case was decided by the outcome of <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12787\">Obergefell v. Hodges.</a> On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court held that the right to marry is fundamental, and it demeans gay and lesbian couples to deprive them of access to marriage. The 14th Amendment therefore does not allow states to ban same-sex marriage. Kennedy was joined without further writing by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor. Each of the four dissenters--Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito--wrote a dissent. </p><p>Following the decision in the Supreme Court, the parties jointly stipulated for an entry of judgement for the plaintiff's attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses. On September 29, 2015, the court entered a  judgement of $200,000 for the plaintiffs. </p>",

Defendants respond at\n18\n19 docket 59.  Plaintiffs’ reply is at docket 70.  Plaintiffs’ supplemental brief is at docket 86. \n20\nDefendants move for summary judgment at docket 58.  Plaintiffs’ respond at docket 70. \n21\nDefendants’ reply is at docket 80.  Defendants’ supplemental brief is at docket 87.  Oral\n22\nargument has not been requested by either side and, particularly in light of recent\n23\ndevelopments in the law of the Ninth Circuit, would not be of assistance to the court.\n24\nII.  BACKGROUND\n25\n26 Plaintiffs are same-sex couples who either were married in another jurisdiction\n27\nand seek to have Arizona recognize their marriages or are same-sex couples who wish\n28\n\nCase 2:14-cv-00024-JWS   Document 88   Filed 10/17/14   Page 2 of 4\n1 to wed in Arizona.  Certain provisions of Arizona law make it impossible for either group\n2\nof plaintiffs to achieve their goal.  They are Article 30, Section 1, of the Arizona\n3\nConstitution which states that only a marriage between one man and one woman is\n4\nvalid and recognizable in Arizona; A.R.S. § 25-101(C) which provides that same-sex\n5\nmarriage is prohibited in Arizona; and A.R.S. § 25-125(A) which defines marriage as\n6\n7 between a male and female person (collectively “the challenged laws”).  Plaintiffs ask\n8\nthe court to declare that the challenged laws deny them equal protection of the law and\n9\ntherefore are invalid under the United States Constitution.  They also ask the court to\n10\npermanently enjoin the enforcement of the challenged laws.  Defendants deny that the\n11\nlaws violate the United States Constitution.\n12\nIII.  DISCUSSION\n13\n14 When the pending motions were filed, their resolution would have required this\n15\ncourt to produce a lengthy and detailed opinion.  However, in the interim, the Court of\n16\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit recently ruled that substantially identical provisions of\n17\nNevada and Idaho law that prohibit same-sex marriages are invalid because they deny\n18\nsame-sex couples equal protection of the law, the right to which is guaranteed by the\n19\n20 Constitution of the United States.1  This court is bound by the precedent set by the\n21 Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.2  For that reason, the plaintiffs are entitled to a\n22\n23\n1Latta v. Otter,      F.3d     , Nos. 14-35420, 14-35421, and 12-17668, 2014 WL 4977682\n24\n(9th Cir. Oct. 7, 2014).\n25\n2See Hart v. Massanari, 266 F.3d 1155, 1171 (9th Cir. 2001) (“Circuit law . . . binds all\n26 courts within a particular circuit, including the court of appeals itself.  Thus, the first panel to\nconsider an issue sets the law not only for all the inferior courts in the circuit, but also future\n27 panels of the court of appeals.”) (citation omitted).\n28 -2-\n\nCase 2:14-cv-00024-JWS   Document 88   Filed 10/17/14   Page 3 of 4\n1 declaration that the challenged laws are unconstitutional and a permanent injunction\n2\nprohibiting their enforcement.\n3\nThe court has considered whether to stay this decision to allow defendants to\n4\nappeal.  It is clear, however, that an appeal to the Ninth Circuit would be futile.  It is also\n5\nclear—based on the Supreme Court’s denial of petitions for writs of certiorari filed in\n6\n7 connection with several circuit court decisions which held that same-sex marriage must\n8 be recognized in Indiana,3 Oklahoma,4 Utah,5 Virginia,6 and Wisconsin7—that the High\n9\nCourt will turn a deaf ear on any request for relief from the Ninth Circuit’s decision.\n10\nIV.  CONCLUSION\n11\nFor the reasons given in the preceding section of this order, plaintiffs’ motion for\n12\nsummary judgment at docket 47 is granted as follows:  this court hereby declares\n13\n14 Article 30, Section 1, of the Arizona Constitution; A.R.S § 25-101© and A.R.S. § 25-\n15\n125(A) unconstitutional by virtue of the fact that they deny same-sex couples the equal\n16\nprotection of the law.  It is further ordered that defendants are hereby ordered to \n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n3Bogan v. Baskin, No. 14-277, 2014 WL 4425162 (U.S. Oct. 6, 2014).\n22\n4Smith v.

NATURE OF THE CASE AND BACKGROUND TO CLAIMS FOR RELIEF\n2  1.  Over ten years ago, the Supreme Court of the United States recognized that \n3  the federal constitution protects the choice to have an intimate relationship with a same-\n4  Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, \n5  578 (2003).  \n6  2.  In  June  2013,  the  Supreme  Court  struck  Section  3  of  the  Defense  of \n7  Marriage Act (DOMA), which barred any federal marital benefits to same-sex couples \n8  who  were  legally  married  in  states  that  permitted  such  marriages.  United  States  v. \n9  Windsor,133 S.Ct. 2675 (2013). \n10  3.  Today, Plaintiffs ask this Court to follow the reasoning in  Windsor and \n11  -sex marriage found in Article 30, Section 1 of the Arizona \n12  Constitution (and other laws of the State of Arizona).  \n13  4.  Plaintiffs  seek  this  C\n14  Arizona  from  the  same  discriminatory  conduct  that  the  Windsor  court  declared \n15  unconstitutional.   \n16  A.  -Sex Marriage.\n17  5. \n18  forty-second  legislature  banned  same-sex  marriage.  See  Arizona  Revised  Statutes \n19  -\n20  rizona  legislature  also  prohibited  recognition  of  same-sex \n21  See A.R.S. § 25-112(A) \n22 \n23  marriages that are void and prohibited by section 25-\n24  6.  Three years later, in 1999, the Arizona legislature approved amendments to \n25  several  statutes  related  to  marriage,  including  a  statutory  definition  of  marriage  as \n26  between  a  male  and  a  female  person.  See  A.R.S.  §  25-\n27 \n28 \nAmended Complaint \nConnolly et. al. v. Roche et al.  2 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00024-JWS   Document 15   Filed 02/10/14   Page 3 of 21\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1  license has been obtained for that purpose from the clerk of the superior court in any \n2  -121(A). \n3  7. \n4  marriage. See Standhardt v. Superior Court, 77 P.3d 451 (App. 2003), review denied (May \n5  25, 2004) (accepting special action jurisdiction over a challenge to the clerk of the court's \n6  refusal to issue a marriage license to a same sex couple). \n7  8.  In 2006, Arizona voters rejected an amendment to the state constitution \n8  banning same-sex marriage. In 2008, the Arizona legislature referred and the voters of \n9  Arizona passed Proposition 102, also known as the Marriage Protection Amendment, which \n10  amended  the  Arizona  Constitution  to  define  marriage  as  between  one  man  and  one \n11  woman.  See nion of one man and one woman shall be \n12 \n13  9.  The Arizona Constitution now prevents gay men and women from entering \n14  into marriage with their same-sex partner. \n15  10.  The Arizona Constitution further prohibits the State from honoring a valid, \n16  same-sex marriage permitted by another jurisdiction.  \n17  11.  As a result, same-sex couples who desire to marry cannot do so in Arizona. \n18  Moreover, Arizona denies recognition of the marriages of those gay men and women who \n19  have entered into valid marriages elsewhere in the United States.   \n20  12.  And,  unlike  many  states,  including,  for  example,  Nevada,  the  Arizona \n21  legislature  has  never  authorized  so-\n22  Arizona cities have afforded some limited benefits to same-sex local residents. Same-sex \n23  couples therefore have no statewide guarantee of the rights let alone the status and \n24  dignity associated with marriage in the State of Arizona.  \n25  B.  -Sex Marriage Violates the Equal Protection \nand Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n26 \n27  13.  In 1996, the Supreme Court confirmed that the U.S. Constitution prohibits \n28  discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 635 36 \nAmended Complaint \nConnolly et. al. v. Roche et al.  3 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00024-JWS   Document 15   Filed 02/10/14   Page 4 of 21\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1  (1996).  \n2  14.  Nevertheless,  today,  twenty-eight  states  have  constitutional  prohibitions \n3  against  same-sex  marriage  and  another  four  states West  Virginia,  Wyoming, \n4  Pennsylvania, and Indiana prohibit same-sex marriage under state law.  \n5  15.  However, deep change has taken place elsewhere in the country. In 2004, \n6  Massachusetts allowed gay marriage. Many states followed suit. In late 2013, Hawaii \n7  became the sixteenth state to recognize same-sex marriage. \n8  16.  In December 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah and the \n9  unanimous New Mexico Supreme Court made Utah and New Mexico the seventeenth \n10  and eighteenth states to join the list of states that recognize same-sex marriage. Today, \n11  same-sex marriage is allowed in states where over forty percent of Americans live.  \n12  17.   in Windsor confirmed \n13  a profound doctrinal change in the law whose origins stretch back forty-six years to the \n14  historic decision in LLoovviinngg  vv..  VViirrggiinniiaa\n15  ted)).   \n16  18.  In  Windsor,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  definition  of  marriage  in \n17 \n18 \n19  the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. More precisely, Windsor held that the \n20  definition of marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman was unconstitutional \n21  because it denied same-\n22  wit\n23  19.  Three federal district courts, including one in the Ninth Circuit, have since \n24  followed  that  rationale  by  applying  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \n25  Amendment to the states and striking state laws that either banned same-sex marriage or \n26  recognition of such marriages.  Kitchen v. Herbert, 2013 WL 6697874 (D. Utah Dec. 20, \n27  2013); Obergefell v. Wymyslo, 2013 WL 6726688 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 23, 2013); Bishop v. \n28  United States ex rel. Holder, 2014 WL 116013 (N.D. Okla. Jan. 14, 2014).  \nAmended Complaint \nConnolly et. al. v. Roche et al.  4 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:14-cv-00024-JWS   Document 15   Filed 02/10/14   Page 5 of 21\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1  20.  In an opinion issued less than one month ago, the Ninth Circuit held that \n2  peremptory juror strikes based on a person's sexual orientation are unconstitutional under \n3  the Equal Protection Clause (using a \"heightened scrutiny\" standard to evaluate such \n4  classifications). SmithKline Beecham v. Abbott Labs, 2014 WL 211807 (9th Cir. Jan. 21, \n5  2014).  \n6  21. \n7  Loving v. \n8  Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967).  \n9  22.  This Court should reach the conclusion that flows from the decisions in \n10  Loving v. Virginia, Romer v. Evans, Lawrence v. Texas and United States v. Windsor, namely \n11  that laws prohibiting same-sex marriage violate the Constitutional requirements of equal \n12  protection and due process. Plaintiffs respectfully ask that this Court enforce their rights \n13  to equal protection and due process under the United States Constitution, and declare as \n14  unconstitutional Article 30, Section 1 of the Arizona Constitution and all similar marital \n15  statutes, including A.R.S. § 25-101(C), -112(A), and -125(A) \n16 \n17  23.  Plaintiffs request that the Court permanently enjoin the enforcement of the \n18  Marriage Discrimination Statutes and all other provisions of Arizona law that may deny \n19  Plaintiffs equal access to the benefits of marriage in the State of Arizona, including the \n20  right of same-sex couples to marry in or have their out-of-state marriages recognized by \n21  the State of Arizona. \n22  II.  JURISDICTION,PARTIES AND VENUE\n23  A.  Federal Question Jurisdiction \n24  24.  Because Plaintiffs allege violations of rights arising under the Fourteenth \n25  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, this Court has subject matter \n26  jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3). \n27  25.  Given the far-reaching doctrinal developments in the law confirmed by the \n28  decision in Windsor,  Plaintiffs raise substantial federal questions  despite the contrary \nAmended Complaint \nConnolly et. al. v.

Hicks  v.  Miranda,  422  U.S.  332,  344\n5  Supreme Court should instruct otherwise, inferior federal courts had best adhere to the \n6  view that if the Court has branded a question as unsubstantial, it remains so except when \n7  any \n8  intervening decisions from the Supreme Court in this area of the law, including Romer,\n9  Lawrence, and WWiinnddssoorr\n10 \n11  B.  The Plaintiffs  \n12  26.  Today, over 650,000 same-sex couples live in the United States. The U.S. \n13  Census Bureau estimates that the percentage of cohabiting same-sex couples living in \n14  Arizona equals the percentage living in, for example, the state of New York, the fourth \n15  most  populous  state  in  the  nation.  In  2010,  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  estimated  that \n16  roughly 21,000 same-sex couples live in Arizona. \n17  27.  Plaintiffs live across Arizona, including the three most populous counties\n18  Maricopa, Pima, and Pinal where 81 percent of all Arizonans reside. \n19  Joe and Terry \n20  28. \n21  Pinal County, Arizona.  \n22  29. \n23  moved  to  Arizona  in  1997  where  they  continue  to  live  together  in  a  committed \n24  relationship. \n25  30.  For  several  years,  Joe  and  Terry  have  lived  together  in  Pinal  County, \n26  Arizona. They own a home, have a joint bank account, and otherwise live as many other \n27  married couples do. They have been long-time, active members of a Lutheran church \n28  congregation in Maricopa County, Arizona. And, like many other Arizona couples and \nAmended Complaint \nConnolly et. al. v.

Unfortunately,  they  lived  in  Arizona  where  the  law  prohibited  their \n4  marriage.  \n5  32.  On May 15, 2008, the California Supreme Court struck down the California \n6  statutes limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples. See In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384, \n7  reted  to \n8  guarantee this basic civil right to [marry to] all individuals and couples, without regard to \n9 \n10  33.  As  a  result,  in  mid-June  2008,  county  officials  across  California  began \n11  issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.  \n12  34.  On July 4, 2008, following this change in California law, Joe and Terry \n13  married in that state. A retired pastor of the Lutheran Church in America performed their \n14  wedding ceremony under the laws and procedures of the State of California. Later, the \n15  County of Riverside, California recorded and issued them a  License and Certificate of \n16  Marriage. \n17  35.   A few months later, though, the voters of California approved Proposition \n18 \n19  between a m\n20  36.  The passage of Proposition 8 ended the issuance of marriage licenses to \n21  same-sex couples in California, but not before over 15,000 same-sex marriage licenses had \n22  been issued, including one to Joe and Terry.  \n23  37.  Although the California Supreme Court later upheld Proposition 8, Strauss \n24  v. Horton, 207 P.3d 48 (Cal. 2009), the court also held that Proposition 8 had no effect on \n25  the already-issued licenses, which remained valid under California law.      \n26  38.  Because Joe and Terry were married in California before the passage of \n27  Proposition 8, they are in a valid California marriage. See Strauss v. Horton, 207 P.3d 48, \n28  119 (Cal. 2009) (\nAmended Complaint \nConnolly et. al. v.

Nevertheless, the laws of Arizona prohibit the State from recognizing Joe \n3 \n4  to this day. \n5  40.  On January 31, 2014, Joe and Terry went to the Office of the Clerk of the \n6  Superior  Court  of  Pinal  County  Pinal  , 971  Jason  Lopez  Circle, \n7  Florence, Arizona, to apply for an Arizona marriage license. \n8  41.  The assistant clerk indicated that she was unsure about giving Joe and Terry \n9  an application. She placed a call to her superiors. \n10  42.   When she finished her call, the clerk informed Joe and Terry that she could \n11  not take their application.  \n12  43.  The clerk then told Joe and Terry that she personally wished she could \n13  issue them a marriage license, but they would have to contact Odette Apodaca, the Case \n14  Management Director for the Pinal County Clerk, to inquire about why she could not.   \n15  44.  Joe and Terry e-mailed Odette Apodaca to further inquire why they were \n16  not even permitted to fill out an application. \n17  45.  Odette Apodaca replied by referring Joe and Terry to A.R.S. § 25-101. \n18  46.  Under the Marriage Discrimination Statutes, Arizona denies to  Joe and \n19  Terry the rights, protections, benefits, and obligations associated with marriage. \n20  Suzanne and Holly \n21  47.  Plaintiffs Suzanne Cummins and Holly Mitchell reside in Maricopa County, \n22  Arizona. \n23  48.  Holly and Suzanne have been in a committed relationship since 2007. For \n24  years,  they  have  lived  together  in  the  same  household,  sharing  their  finances, \n25  responsibilities, and otherwise living together as many other married couples do.  \n26  49.  Holly  and  Suzanne  actively  volunteer  their  time  to  various  community \n27  childcare endeavors. Suzanne, for example, is a troop leader in the Purple Sage Council, a \n28  local chapter of the Girl Scouts of America, and both Holly and Suzanne serve as foster \nAmended Complaint \nConnolly et. al. v.

Like many other Arizona couples and families, they hoped to marry in their \n3  state of residence and enjoy the benefits that flow from recognition of their marriage.  \n4  51.  Unfortunately, they live in Arizona where the law prohibits their marriage. \n5  52.  Because the law of Arizona prohibits them from becoming married and \n6  affirmatively denies the validity of any marriage into which they might legally enter in \n7  another state, Holly and Suzanne cannot validate their union as a legal marriage in their \n8  home state. \n9  53.  Despite  having  been  denied  the  dignity  and  benefits  that  the  State  of \n10  Arizona affords others solely because they are a same-sex couple, Holly and Suzanne \n11  continue to live as a married couple. \n12  54.  In 2008, Holly and Suzanne began planning for the future of their family. \n13  They decided to foster and ultimately adopt children into their family. \n14  55.  In September 2009, Holly and Suzanne began attending the Partnering for \n15  Safety  and  Permanence-Model  Approach  to  Partnership  in  Parenting  (\"PS-MAPP\") \n16  classes required to become licensed foster parents in Arizona. \n17  56.  Holly and Suzanne became certified foster parents in late 2009. \n18  57.  Holly and Suzanne wished to grow their family by becoming permanent \n19  adoptive parents. \n20  58.  In November 2009, they received their first foster care children. \n21  59.  Both  children  were  quickly  approved  for  adoption.  Holly  and  Suzanne \n22  adopted the younger child in November 2010 and the older child in July 2011. \n23  60.  Suzanne is the legal adoptive parent of both children. \n24  61.  Holly and Suzanne continue to serve as foster parents; they are currently \n25  the foster parents of an 18-month-old child in addition to their two adopted children. \n26  62.  Under the Marriage Discrimination Statutes, Arizona denies to Holly and \n27  Suzanne the rights, protections, benefits, and obligations associated with marriage. \n28   \nAmended Complaint \nConnolly et. al. v.

Plaintiffs  Clark  Rowley  and  David  Chaney  are  longtime  residents  of \n3  Maricopa County, Arizona. \n4  64.  Clark and David met in Arizona and have been in a committed relationship \n5  for over five years.   \n6  65.  They live together as life partners as many other married couples do, and \n7  share household duties and responsibilities. \n8  66.  For years, they have wanted to confirm their love and lifelong commitment \n9  to each other, but they live in Arizona where same-sex marriage is prohibited and where \n10  out-of-state, legal same-sex marriages are not recognized as valid. \n11  67.  In 2010, Clark and David decided that they wanted to marry; they discussed \n12  becoming legally married in a state that allowed same-sex marriage. \n13  68.  Realizing that their out-of-state marriage would not be honored in Arizona \n14  and that they truly wished to marry in their home state, Clark and David instead decided \n15  to have a commitment ceremony because Arizona offered them no alternative to validate \n16  their union. \n17  69.  On October 9, 2010, Clark and David held a commitment ceremony before \n18  the fountains at the Scottsdale Civic Center in testimony to their love and commitment to \n19  one another in front of over 300 of their closest friends and family. \n20  70.  Thereafter, Clark and David opened a joint bank account; they have shared \n21  their finances ever since. \n22  71.  Clark and David wish to be legally married in their home state of Arizona, \n23  but they have not and cannot be legally married in Arizona. \n24  72.  Under the Marriage Discrimination Statutes, Arizona denies to Clark and \n25  David the rights, protections, benefits, and obligations associated with marriage. \n26  Mason and Chris \n27  73.

Mason and Chris met in Phoenix in 2001 and have lived together in a \n2  committed  relationship  since  2002.  They  own  a  home  together, have  a  joint  bank \n3  account, and otherwise live as many other married couples do. \n4  75.  For  years,  Mason  and  Chris  sought  the  responsibilities,  privileges  and \n5  benefits of marriage. The laws of Arizona, however, prevented their marriage to one \n6  another. So, like Joe and Terry, Mason and Chris married in California in 2008. Still \n7  today, however, their marriage remains invalid under Arizona law. See A.R.S. §25-112(A). \n8  76.  In 2011, Mason and Chris became foster parents licensed by the State of \n9  Arizona. They have cared for several foster children since then and are still licensed foster \n10  parents.  \n11  77.  On February 5, 2014, Mason and Chris went to the Office of the Clerk of \n12  the Superior Court of Maricopa County  , 601 W. Jefferson \n13  Street, Phoenix, Arizona,to apply for an Arizona marriage license. \n14  78.  In the office of the Maricopa County Clerk, they truthfully completed an \n15  application provided by an assistant clerk. \n16  79.   When Mason and Chris were called to the counter, they both presented \n17  state- a, the clerk on duty.   \n18  80. \n19  handed the application back and told them that she could not accept it or issue them a \n20  marriage license.   \n21  81.  Ramona told Mason and Chris that it would not be legal for her to issue \n22  them a marriage license in Arizona, so they left. \n23  82.

They now seek to have their marriage recognized by the State of Arizona or \n4  obtain a marriage license in Coconino County, Arizona. \n5  86.  After their marriage in the State of Washington, where Meagan grew up, \n6  the  couple  returned  to  Arizona  and  hosted  a  wedding  reception  in  Flagstaff.  Their \n7  families, friends, and colleagues attended the Flagstaff wedding reception in order to \n8  celebrate their marriage. \n9  present their union as a marriage.\n10  87.  Meagan and Natalie love one another, own a home jointly in Flagstaff, share \n11  a joint bank account, own a vehicle jointly, and raise two dogs (Lucy and Eldon) together.  \n12  After their marriage in the State of Washington, Meagan changed her surname from Pugh \n13  to Metz, in furtherance of their union. \n14  88.  Meagan and Natalie wish to enjoy the same privileges, status, dignity and \n15  contractual rights that are conferred by the State of Arizona on individuals in opposite-sex \n16  marriages. \n17  89.  Meagan  works  part-time  in  the  healthcare  industry  while  she  pursues \n18  further education at Northern Arizona University.

Under the Marriage Discrimination Statutes, Arizona denies to Meagan and \n5  Natalie the rights, protections, benefits, and obligations associated with marriage. \n6  Jeff and Peter \n7  93.  Plaintiffs Jeffrey Ferst and Peter Bramley live in Pima County, Arizona. \n8  94.  Peter, a native Tucsonan, and Jeff (born in New York) moved to Scottsdale \n9  from Canada in early 2012. They decided to marry last year.  \n10  95.   Although  they  could  not  marry  in  their  home  state  of  Arizona,  they \n11  formalized their commitment to one another and were married in Riverside County, \n12  California on October 11, 2013.  \n13  96.  They live together in Tucson where they share a home, bank account, and \n14  otherwise live as many married couples do.  \n15  97.  Peter owns a public relations company. He has been in business for over 25 \n16  years. Jeff is a well-known artist. \n17  98. \n18  marriage, or permit them to marry in Arizona, harms them by denying them the rights, \n19  protections, benefits, and obligations associated with marriage. \n20  Renee and Robin \n21  99.

Robin and Renee raise their son as equal and full co-parents.   \n7  105.  On January 24, 2014, Renee and Robin went to the office of the Clerk of the \n8  Coconino County Superior Court and applied for a marriage license. \n9  106.  Renee and Robin were received by Deborah Young, the duly elected Clerk \n10  of  the  Coconino  County  Superior  Court,  who  informed  Renee  and  Robin  that  their \n11  marriage license application was denied because Arizona law prohibits a marriage between \n12  same-sex couples. \n13  107.  Because they cannot legally marry in Arizona, Renee and Robin would incur \n14  significant expenses arranging for, and traveling to, another state to marry. \n15  108.  Arizona's  refusal  to  permit  Renee  and  Robin  to  marry  harms  them  by \n16  denying them the rights, protections, benefits, and obligations associated with marriage. \n17  C.

Defendants, and those under their supervision, interpret and enforce state \n7  laws  related  to  marriage  in  Arizona,  especially  those  constitutional  and  statutory \n8  provisions that deny same-sex couples the right to marry in the State of Arizona.  \n9  114.

Windsor, 133 S.Ct. at 2694 96. \n2  119.  The Marriage Discrimination Statutes do exactly that. For example, A.R.S. \n3  Sections 25-101(C), -112(A), and -125(A), together with article 30, section 1 of the state \n4  constitution,  restrict  access  to  marriage  to  opposite-sex  couples,  thereby  denying \n5  homosexuals the right to marry their chosen partner.  \n6  120.  These laws treat similarly situated persons differently by conferring the\n7  benefits and protections of marriage on heterosexual but not homosexual couples. Stated \n8  differently, these Arizona laws single out homosexuals for disfavored treatment.  \n9  121.  For these reasons, the Marriage Discrimination Statutes violate the Equal \n10  Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n11  122.  Defendants, under color of state law, have deprived and, absent relief from \n12  this Court, will continue to deprive Plaintiffs of their fundamental right to marry and \n13  thereby enjoy, in the words of the Supreme Court in WWiinnddssoorr\n14 \n15  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which in turn violates 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n16  123.  The Marriage Discrimination Statutes classify the Plaintiffs based on sexual \n17  orientation. In the Ninth Circuit, when considering Equal Protection claims, the district \n18  court reviews classifications based on sexual orientation using heightened scrutiny, not \n19  rational basis. See SmithKline Beecham v. Abbott Labs, 2014 WL 211807 at *6 (9th Cir.) \n20  (Jan. 21, 2014) (\"Windsor requires that heightened scrutiny be applied to equal protection \n21  claims involving sexual orientation.\").  \n22  124.

To deny this fundamental freedom . . . is surely to deprive all the \n5  Loving, 388 U.S. at 12 (citation \n6  omitted). \n7  128.  The Marriage Discrimination Statutes deprive Plaintiffs of the due process \n8  of law under the federal constitution because the State of Arizona deprives gay citizens \n9  the  opportunity  to  marry  the  person  of  their  choosing  and,  in  other  cases,  fails  to \n10  recognize as valid their out-of-state marriages.  \n11  129.  Because the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects \n12  -of-\n13  state marriages, even the voters of Arizona may not infringe this constitutional right.  \n14  130.  The Marriage Discrimination Statutes classify the Plaintiffs based on sexual \n15  orientation. In the Ninth Circuit, when considering substantive Due Process claims, the \n16  district  court  reviews  classifications  based  on  sexual  orientation  using  heightened \n17  scrutiny. Witt v.

Plaintiffs accordingly seek an order permanently enjoining the enforcement \n3  of the Marriage Discrimination Statutes.   \n4  137. \n5  law banning same-sex marriage will prevent continued harm to Plaintiffs.  \n6  138.  Plaintiffs request no relief compelling any person, church, or organization to \n7  solemnize same-sex marriages. Rather, Plaintiffs request relief against the Defendants to, \n8  for example, issue and, following the marriage ceremony or other solemnization, record \n9  the marriage licenses returned by Plaintiffs. \n10  IV.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n11  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgment on Claims One and Two as follows: \n12  139.  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request  a  declaratory  judgment  and  order  for \n13  permanent injunctive relief under (a) Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 57 and 65, (b) 28 \n14 \n15  2202. \n16  140.   Plaintiffs  request  that  the  Court  construe  art.  30,  §1  of  the  Arizona \n17  Constitution, and the other Marriage Discrimination Statutes, and enter a declaratory \n18  judgment  that  these  and  all  other  laws  of  the  State  of  Arizona  banning,  refusing  to \n19  recognize,  or  otherwise  restricting  same-sex  marriage,  violate  the  United  States \n20  Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n21  141.  Based  on  these  declarations,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  seek  entry  of  a \n22  permanent injunction (a) enjoining the Defendants, acting in their official capacities, and \n23  all others under their supervision and control, and those acting in concert with them, \n24  under color of the law of the State of Arizona, from enforcing art. 30, § 1 of the Arizona \n25  Constitution and any Arizona statute that excludes gay men and women from access to \n26  marriage  in  the  State  of  Arizona;    and,  (b)  compelling  Defendants  to  accept  the \n27  application of, issue marriage licenses to, and record the returned marriage licenses from \n28  the unmarried plaintiffs (e.g., Suzanne Cummins and Holly Mitchell, and Clark Rowley \nAmended Complaint \nConnolly et. al. v.

Plaintiffs  request  an  award  of  the  costs  and  expenses  of  this  action, \n8 \n9  see \n10  Rhodes v.

Piphus, 435 U.S. 247 (1978) (claim for violation of constitutional \n16  rights entitles plaintiff to award of nominal damages); Draper v.

MOTION PRESENTED\nAt docket 48, defendants Chad Roche, Michael K. Jeanes, and Deborah Young\n(hereinafter collectively “the Clerks”) move pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) to dismiss\nthe claim for nominal damages pled by plaintiffs Joseph Connolly, et al. (“Plaintiffs”). \nPlaintiffs’ response is at docket 61.  Clerks’ reply is at docket 76.  Oral argument was not\nrequested and would not be of assistance to the court.\nII.  BACKGROUND\nThe gay and lesbian couples who are Plaintiffs in this case sued the Clerks\nseeking a declaration that two Arizona statutes, A.R.S. §§ 25-101(C) and 25-125(A),\ntogether with Article 30, § 1 of the Arizona Constitution (collectively “the Challenged\n\nCase 2:14-cv-00024-JWS   Document 82   Filed 07/30/14   Page 2 of 7\nLaws”) are void.  Plaintiffs contend that by denying gay and lesbian couples the\nopportunity to marry the Challenged laws violate the Equal Protection and Due Process\nclauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The Clerks are\nnamed as defendants because they refused to issue marriage licenses to Plaintiffs. \nEach of the Clerks is sued in his or her official capacity as a Clerk of the Superior Court\nfor the State of Arizona in their respective counties.\nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n“After the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any\nparty may move for judgment on the pleadings.”1  Because “Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(c) are\nsubstantially identical,”2 a motion for judgment on the pleadings is assessed under the\nstandard applicable to a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief\nmay be granted under Rule 12(b)(6).3\nRule 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of a plaintiff’s claims.  In reviewing such a\nmotion, “[a]ll allegations of material fact in the complaint are taken as true and construed\nin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”4  To be assumed true, the\nallegations, “may not simply recite the elements of a cause of action, but must contain\nsufficient allegations of underlying facts to give fair notice and to enable the opposing\nparty to defend itself effectively.”5  Dismissal for failure to state a claim can be based on\n1Fed.

Miller, 120 F.3d 1075, 1077 (9th Cir. 1997).\n5Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011).\n-2-\n\nCase 2:14-cv-00024-JWS   Document 82   Filed 07/30/14   Page 3 of 7\neither “the lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient facts alleged\nunder a cognizable legal theory.”6  “Conclusory allegations of law . . . are insufficient to\ndefeat a motion to dismiss.”7  \nIV.  DISCUSSION\nIn addition to their request for a declaration of rights and a permanent injunction\nagainst enforcement of the Challenged Laws, Plaintiffs ask this court to award them\nnominal damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.8  The Clerks argue that they are\nentitled to immunity from the nominal damages claim by virtue of the Eleventh\nAmendment.  As the Ninth Circuit has explained: “The Eleventh Amendment bars suits\nfor money damages in federal court against a state, its agencies, and state officials\nacting in their official capacities.”9\nPlaintiffs raise a number of arguments in opposition to the motion.  First, they\ncontend that the counties, not the state of Arizona, are the real parties in interest.  This\nargument is not tenable.  At the heart of the lawsuit lies Plaintiffs’ contention that state\nstatutes and a provision in the state constitution are void.  There is no attack on any\ncounty action or standard that does not flow from the proposition that the Clerks are\nfollowing state law.\nPlaintiffs next assert that because any judgment awarding nominal damages\nwould be paid by the counties rather than the state the Clerks are county rather than\n6Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dept., 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990).\n7Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 679 (9th Cir. 2001).\n8Doc. 15 at 20 ¶ 144.\n9Aholelei v. Dept. of Public Safety, 488 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir. 2007).\n-3-\n\nCase 2:14-cv-00024-JWS   Document 82   Filed 07/30/14   Page 4 of 7\nstate officials.  The Clerks concede that point, but argue correctly that under Ninth\nCircuit law, who would pay a judgment is not the only consideration bearing on their\nstatus.  Although that factor is predominant,10 additional factors to consider are whether\nthe Clerks perform a state government function, whether the Clerks may sue or be sued,\nwhether the Clerks have the power to take property in their own names or only in the\nstate’s name, and the Clerks’ corporate status.11 \nThe Clerks are engaged in the operation of the Arizona trial courts in their\nrespective counties.  In that capacity they are officials in what is clearly a statewide\nsystem of civil and criminal justice.  As the Clerks’ briefing points out, Arizona’s judicial\npower is vested by its constitution in an integrated judicial system that includes the\nArizona Supreme Court and other courts, including the Arizona Superior Courts, as\nprovided by state law.12  Further evidencing the statewide nature of the system is the fact\nthat the Arizona Supreme Court is given administrative supervision of all other state\ncourts.13  It is also noteworthy that the state constitution establishes a superior court in\neach county with a number of judges to be set by law,14 and expressly states that the\nsuperior courts “constitute a single court.”15  Thus, the various superior courts are neither\nseparate courts nor are they established by the counties.\n10Beentjes v. Placer Cnty. Air Pollution Control Dist., 397 F.3d 775, 778 (9th Cir. 2005).\n11Savage v. Glendale Union High School, 343 F.3d 1036, 1040 (9th Cir. 2003).\n12Ariz. Const. Art VI, § 1.\n13Id., Art. VI, § 3.\n14Id., Art. VI, § 10.\n15Id. Art. VI, § 13.\n-4-\n\nCase 2:14-cv-00024-JWS   Document 82   Filed 07/30/14   Page 5 of 7\nThe state constitution also addresses the supervision of the superior court by\nproviding for presiding judges16 and clerks of court.17  As recounted in the Clerk’s\nbriefing, the Arizona Supreme Court held in Royalston v. Pima County18 that despite\nstatutes listing court clerks as county officers, superior court clerks are under the\nsupervision of the Arizona Supreme Court.  The Arizona legislature thereafter revised\nthe statutory scheme to remove references to the court clerks from the title covering\ncounties, Title 11, and placed statues relating to court clerks in the judiciary title,\nTitle 12.19  Given the discussion in this and the preceding paragraph, it is clear that when\nacting in their official capacities the Clerks are engaged in a state function.  \nThe third factor relating to the capacity to sue or be sued is somewhat difficult to\napply within the Arizona statutory framework.  However, the court agrees with the\ndiscussion in the Clerk’s motion papers demonstrating that the Clerks do have the\ncapacity to sue or be sued.20  It may be added that Plaintiffs must agree that the Clerks\nhave the capacity to be sued, because Plaintiffs sued the Clerks.  The third factor\nweighs in favor of treating the Clerks as state officials.\nThe fourth factor concerns whether the Clerks may take property in their own\nnames.  This factor also supports the conclusion that the Clerks are state officials, for\n16Id., Art. VI, § 11\n17Id., Art. VI, § 23.\n18475 P.2d 233, 234 (Ariz. 1970).\n191982 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 168.  See Title 12, Chapter 2, Article 8 of the Arizona\nRevised Statutes.\n20Doc. 48 at 6-7.\n-5-\n\nCase 2:14-cv-00024-JWS   Document 82   Filed 07/30/14   Page 6 of 7\nthey are not authorized to take or accept property other than for the courts themselves.\nThe final factor is the Clerk’s status as entities separate from the state.  As\nexplained in the discussion above, the Clerks’ only official status is their role in the\nstatewide court system.  Therefore, this factor also supports the proposition that the\nClerks are state officials.\nThe conclusion to which the relevant constitutional provisions, the statutory\nprovisions in Title 12, and the other factors discussed above ineluctably point is that in\ntheir official capacities the Clerks perform a state function.  However, Plaintiffs raise\nadditional objections to dismissal of their nominal damages claim.\nPlaintiffs contend that the claim for nominal damages is properly entertained even\nif the Clerks are state officials under the doctrine of Ex Parte Young.21  In this Plaintiffs\nerr.  The doctrine of Ex Parte Young permits claims against state officials in federal\ncourts for prospective relief such as a declaratory judgment or an injunction.  It does not\napply to retroactive relief such as a claim for damages.22\nPlaintiffs also contend that nominal damages should be treated differently than \ncompensatory damages for purpose of the Eleventh Amendment on the theory that\nnominal damages are the functional equivalent of declaratory relief.  Plaintiffs cite no\nauthority for that proposition, and the court is not aware of any.  Moreover, nominal\ndamages are a form of relief utilized when a plaintiff cannot prove actual damages. \nThey do not function as a stand-in for declaratory relief, but rather as a substitute for\n21209 U.S. 123 (1908).  \n22E.g., Brown v. Oregon Dept. of Corrections, 751 F.3d 983, 989 (9th Cir. 2014).\n-6-\n\nCase 2:14-cv-00024-JWS   Document 82   Filed 07/30/14   Page 7 of 7\ncompensatory damages.  In sum, Plaintiffs attempt to avoid the application of the\nEleventh Amendment to their nominal damages claim using Ex Parte Young and related\nconsiderations fails.\nThere is another reason why Plaintiffs cannot pursue a § 1983 claim against them\nfor the recovery of nominal damages.  The Supreme Court succinctly stated that reason\nin its holding in Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police: “We hold that neither a State nor\nits officials acting in their official capacities are ‘persons’ under § 1983.”23\nV.  CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed above, the motion at docket 48 to dismiss Plaintiffs’\nclaim for nominal damages is GRANTED.\nDATED this 29th day of July 2014.\n                        /S/                               \nJOHN W.

The court has read the decision of the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit in Latta, et al. v. Otter, el al., Ninth Circuit Case No.\n14−35420 filed October 7, 2014. It appears that the Latta decision controls the\noutcome of the cross−motions for summary judgment at dockets 47 and 58 in this\ncase. Latta appears to require that the motion at docket 47 be granted, and the motion\nat docket 58 be denied. The court invites the parties each to submit a supplemental\nbrief discussing how the Latta decision applies to the motions at dockets 47 and 58.\nThe supplemental briefs should be filed not more than 7 days from the date of this\norder. This is a TEXT ENTRY ONLY. There is no PDF document associated with this\nentry. (JWS) (Entered: 10/09/2014)\n10/15/2014 86  SUPPLEMENT Plaintiffs' Brief Re Application of Latta v.
