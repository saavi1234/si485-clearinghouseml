    "summary": "<p>On December 14, 2006, two female former inmates of the Correctional Treatment Facility (CTF) in Washington, D.C. filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the District of Columbia.  The plaintiffs, represented by public interest counsel, sought damages for violations of their constitutional rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth Amendments to the Constitution.  Plaintiffs claimed that they were each sexually assaulted by CTF staff and that CTF failed to protect their safety through negligent hiring practices, inadequate safety training, ineffective assault reporting mechanisms, and failure to enforce policies to minimize the risk of sexual assaults, including supervision of staff-inmate interaction and ineffective investigative and disciplinary action in response to allegations of sexual assault.</p><p>On April 9, 2002, one of the plaintiffs was being escorted back from a court hearing when she alleged she was taken by a corrections officer to a staff bathroom, where he raped and sexually assaulted her.  A few days later, the same corrections officer repeated his rape and assault.  The officer later attempted to touch the plaintiff in a sexual manner, but the plaintiff was able to fend off his advances.  Over the subsequent period, the plaintiff suffered panic attacks, but she was not provided with treatment and she had difficulty getting her complaint investigated.  The male officer was eventually terminated for an unrelated incident.  On December 25, 2003, the second plaintiff was taken by a male corrections officer to a broom closet, where he raped and sexually assaulted her.  The plaintiff called the DC Dept. of Corrections sexual misconduct hotline and an investigation was begun.  When the officer was placed on paid suspension, the allegations became common knowledge among the officers, which resulted in rumors and attempts to determine the plaintiff's identity.  The officer resigned before the investigation was completed.</p><p>The plaintiffs entered a motion on December 14, 2006 to proceed under pseudonyms, which was initially granted but eventually denied on November 16, 2007 by Judge Ellen Huvelle.  After some other discovery disputes, the parties reached a closed settlement on October 21, 2008.  </p>",

Code ยง 1-102. \nThe District of Columbia, by and through its agents, is responsible for supervising the operation \nof the District of Columbia Department of Corrections (\"DCDC\") and ensuring the health and \nsafety of all inmates incarcerated in DCDC facilities, including the contract facility, CTF.  The \nDistrict of Columbia through its agents is responsible for monitoring the facilities with which \nDCDC contracts for the care and custody of prisoners committed to its custody.  The District of \nColumbia is also responsible for and has a duty to establish policies and procedures for DC DC \n3 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 4 of 22\nand its contracting agents, and for the training, supervision, and discipline of staff.  The District \nof Columbia and DCDC are collectively referred to herein as \"the District.\" \n10.  Defendant CCA is a Tennessee corporation doing business in and with the \nDistrict.  CCA operates CTF on behalf of the District.  CCA is responsible for and has a duty to \nestablish policies and procedures for the training, supervision, and discipline of its staff and has a \nduty and responsibility to ensure the health and safety of the inmates incarcerated at CTF.  At all \ntimes relevant to this complaint, CCA was acting under color of law in all of its activities with \nrespect to the incarceration, care, custody, health, and safety of the Plaintiffs, Ms. Doe and Ms. \nRoe. \n11.  Defendant Elry McKnight is a resident of the District of Columbia.  At all times \nrelevant to this complaint, he was employed by CCA as a Correctional Officer at CTF. \nDefendant McKnight participated in the events giving rise to this Complaint.  At all times \nrelevant to this Complaint, Defendant McKnight acted under color of state law and within the \nscope of his employment. \n12.  Defendant John Gant is a resident of Maryland.  At all times relevant to this \ncomplaint, he was employed by CCA as a Correctional Officer at CTF.  Defendant Gant \nparticipated in the events giving rise to this Complaint.  At all times relevant to this Complaint, \nDefendant Gant acted under color oflaw and within the scope of his employment. \nFactual Allegations \n13.  All the facilities that make up the DCDC have long histories of employees \nengaging in sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape of inmates, and retaliation against those who \nreport such violations.  See, e.g., Women Prisoners of the District of Columbia Dep't. of \n4 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 5 of 22\nCorrections v. District of Columbia, 877 F. Supp. 634 (D.D.C. 1994), vacated in non-relevant \npart and remanded by 93 F.3d 910 (D.C. Cif. 1996); Daskalea v. District of Columbia, 227 F.3d \n433 (D.C. Cif. 2000). \n14.  Any sexual act or sexual contact between a correctional officer and an inmate in \nofficial custody is criminal rape under D.C. Code ยงยง 22-3013 and 22-3014. \n15.  CCA is responsible for the hiring, training, and day-to-day supervision of all the \nemployees who work at CTF. \n16.  On information and belief, CCA fails to use appropriate psychological screening \ntools to screen potential employees so as to prevent rape, sexual misconduct, and assault by staff. \n17.  The training provided to new employees concerning rape, sexual harassment, \nsexual contact, and assault is perfunctory, minimal, and inadequate by any measure. \n18.  On information and belief, the continuing training provided to employees \nconcerning rape, sexual harassment, sexual contact, and assault is minimal and inadequate. \n19.  On information and belief, the District's and CCA's responses to previous \nincidents of rape, sexual harassment, sexual contact, and assault at CTF were so minimal as to \ncreate an understanding among CCA employees that rape, sexual harassment, sexual contact, and \nassault were not taken seriously by CCA officials. \n20.  On information and belief, DCDC has been aware ofCCA's apathetic conduct \nin addressing and preventing rape, sexual harassment, and assault of individuals in its care, but \nDCDC has not taken any action. \nPlaintiff Doe \n21.  Ms. Doe was arrested on September 28,2001, in New York, New York. \n5 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 6 of 22\n22.  Ms. Doe was transferred to the District of Columbia to await trial, and on \nNovember 20, 2001, Ms. Doe was arraigned in the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia.  At that time, Ms. Doe was transferred to the custody of DC DC. \n23.  Upon her entry into the DCDC system, Ms. Doe was processed through intake \nat the DC Central Detention Facility. \n24.  Ms. Doe was assigned by DCDC to be housed at CTF. \n25.  CTF is operated by CCA, which, pursuant to a contract with DCDC, houses \ninmates who have been remanded to the custody of DC DC. \n26.  Because Ms. Doe was placed in the custody of DCDC, at all relevant times the \nDistrict and CCA and their officials, employees, and agents had a duty to provide for her care \nand to protect her safety. \n27.  During the period that Ms. Doe was in the custody of DC DC, Defendant \nMcKnight was employed by CCA as a Correctional Officer at CTF and assigned to duty in the \nReceiving and Discharge Unit. \n28.  On information and belief, prior to being employed by CCA, Defendant \nMcKnight had been employed by DCDC as a Correctional Officer. \n29.  On information and belief, the District and CCA knew or reasonably should \nhave known of official and unofficial complaints of serious misconduct on the part of Defendant \nMcKnight. \n30.  On information and belief, CCA did not inquire about or properly consider \nthose prior complaints when hiring Defendant McKnight to be a Correctional Officer for CCA. \n6 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 7 of 22\n31.  It was the custom, pattern, policy, and practice of DC DC and CCA to allow \nsituations in which male guards had unsupervised access to female prisoners. \n32.  During the period of his employment, Defendant McKnight had criminal sexual \nrelations with several female prisoners at CTF. \n33.  On March 28, 2002, Ms. Doe returned to CTF from a court appearance and was \nprocessed through the Receiving and Discharge unit at CTF.  Defendant McKnight escorted Ms. \nDoe back to her housing unit alone.  On the way, Defendant McKnight asked if Ms. Doe knew \nhow to keep a secret.  Defendant McKnight said he wanted to touch Ms. Doe in a sexual manner. \nMs. Doe rebuffed these sexual advances and rushed to her housing unit in order to end the \nencounter with Defendant McKnight. \n34.  On April 9,2002, Ms. Doe had another court hearing.  She returned to CTF \nafter 4:30 p.m.  Again, Defendant McKnight escorted Ms. Doe to her unit alone.  Defendant \nMcKnight told Ms. Doe that he wanted to have sex with her.  He took her to a staff bathroom and \nblocked her exit.  Defendant McKnight pulled his pants down and ordered Ms. Doe to perform \noral sex on him.  Then he ordered her to lie down on the floor and proceeded to rape her \nvaginally.  When he finished raping and sodomizing Ms. Doe, Defendant McKnight ordered her \nto get dressed and took her back to her unit. \n35.  During the assault, Defendant McKnight wore a condom, which he \nsubsequently flushed down the toilet. \n36.  The next week, a CTF staff member called Ms. Doe's housing unit and said Ms. \nDoe had a package delivered, and she needed to pick it up. \n37.  Defendant McKnight appeared alone to escort Ms. Doe to pick up her package. \n7 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 8 of 22\n38.  Defendant McKnight took Ms. Doe from her housing unit to another room and \nmade a duplicate identification badge for her.  He told her that she should tell anyone who asked \nthat the reason she was taken from her unit was to get a new ID badge. \n39.  Defendant McKnight then took Ms. Doe to the same bathroom where he raped \nher before, and again ordered her to have oral sex and vaginal intercourse with him.  Defendant \nMcKnight raped and sodomized Ms. Doe. \n40.  Again, Defendant McKnight wore a condom during the rape and flushed it \ndown the toilet afterwards. \n41.  After the rape, while Defendant McKnight was getting dressed, another officer \ncalled and asked if Defendant McKnight had taken Ms. Doe to get her package.  Defendant \nMcKnight replied that he had taken Ms. Doe to get the package, and he ordered Ms. Doe to \nremain quiet. \n42.  Defendant McKnight then escorted Ms. Doe back to her housing unit by way of \nthe medical unit. \n43.  On April 18, 2002, Ms. Doe had a court date.  She returned to CTF in the \ncompany of other inmates and CTF staff.  Once again, Defendant McKnight attempted to touch \nMs. Doe in a sexual manner, but because there were other people around, Ms. Doe was able to \nfend off another attack. \n44.  Over the subsequent several weeks, Ms. Doe began having panic attacks due to \nthe trauma of being raped and sodomized.  She experienced feelings of great fear, \nhyperventilation, shortness of breath, and chest pain.  Ms. Doe was concerned that something \nwas wrong with her heart, and she requested a medical examination. \n8 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 9 of 22\n45.  The medical evaluation did not reveal any cardiac abnormalities.  The medical \nstaff diagnosed Ms. Doe as having panic attacks and referred her to psychological services. \n46.  On or about May 23,2002, Ms. Doe saw a psychological services staff member. \nShe was not offered any therapy or any examination into the possible causes of her panic attacks, \nbut was only offered sleeping medications. \n47.  On or about May 31, 2002, Ms. Doe confided in Correctional Officer Scott, a \nwoman who was an officer on her unit, that she had been raped by a guard and that the rapes \nwere the reason she was having panic attacks. \n48.  On May 31,2002, Correctional Officer Scott filed a CCA \"Incident Statement,\" \nwhere she described her conversation with Ms. Doe.  Officer Scott reported that Ms. Doe began \nto get upset and was crying while she recounted how Defendant McKnight raped her on several \noccasions. \n49.  Correctional Officer Scott also reported that Ms. Doe stated that she feared for \nher safety ifher report about the rapes was not kept confidential. \n50.  Correctional Officer Scott immediately took Ms. Doe to see the CTF Warden, \nFred Figueroa, to report the rapes. \n51.  Ms. Doe asked the CTF staff to notify the Metropolitan Police Department \nabout the rapes. \n52.  On June 4, 2002, Defendant McKnight was suspended from CTF with pay \nduring the pendency of an intemal investigation into the rapes. \n53.  On or about June 7,2002, Ms. Doe had not been informed of any progress in the \ninvestigation of the rapes or of any plans for treatment for her. \n9 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 10 of 22\n54.  Having received no information that the police had been called to investigate \nthe rapes, Ms. Doe twice called the District's 911 system (the Emergency Telephone System) to \nattempt to report the rapes. \n55.  After several days, Ms. Doe still had not been notified of any criminal \ninvestigation into the rapes or forthcoming medical or psychological treatment.  Ms. Doe called \nthe Metropolitan Police Department and asked to speak to a supervisor about the rapes.  The \nsupervisor said that a detective would come to CTF and interview Ms. Doe, but no one came. \n56.  Ms. Doe made multiple requests for a rape exam and a sexually transmitted \ninfection evaluation. \n57.  Ms. Doe continued to seek assistance in getting an official response to her \nreport of the rapes.  On June 21, 2002, she inforn1ed her sentencing judge that she had been \nraped by a guard at CTF. \n58.  On July 3,2002, Ms. Doe was informed by CTF Warden Fred Figueroa that the \nCCA internal investigation into her rape had been closed. \n59.  A CCA internal memorandum submitted to Warden Figueroa dated July 3, \n2002, recommended that Defendant McKnight be returned to work in his previous capacity \nwithout prejudice. \n60.  On or about July 4, 2002, Ms. Doe was asked to sign a statement that she had \nattended a training class on the types of behavior that constitute sexual misconduct.  Ms. Doe \nnever attended any such class, and therefore she refused to sign the statement. \n10 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 11 of 22\n61.  A telephone number for the DCDC sexual misconduct hotline was posted in Ms. \nDoe's housing until on or about July 4,2002, approximately three months after Ms. Doe was \nfirst raped by Defendant McKnight. \n62.  Only in August 2002 was Ms. Doe given an explanation of what constitutes \nsexual misconduct and the policies against such conduct in the District of Columbia. \n63.  On information and belief, Defendant McKnight was terminated by CTF only \nwhen he was indicted for smuggling contraband to a female inmate at CTF in November 2002. \n64.  Ms. Doe was physically and emotionally traumatized by the repeated rapes, \nsodomy, and sexual assaults by the CCA Correctional Officer, and she continues to suffer the \nemotional, psychological, and physical effects of the rapes and assaults to this day. \nPlaintiff Roe \n65.  On December 25, 2003, at approximately 11 :30 a.m., Ms. Roe was in her \nhousing unit at CTF.  When Defendant Gant came in to bring the lunch trays, he asked Ms. \nRogers, the Correctional Officer on duty in the unit, to allow Ms. Roe to speak to him alone in \nthe hallway. \n66.  On information and belief, the staff at CTF are not trained to be alert to signs of \nsexual misconduct such as this, where male staff remove female inmates to unsupervised areas of \nthe facility. \n67.  Ms. Rogers, the Correctional Officer on duty, did not question this request and \nallowed Defendant Gant to take Ms. Roe into the hallway alone. \n11 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 12 of 22\n68.  When Defendant Gant and Ms. Roe were alone in the hallway, Defendant Gant \nasked Ms. Roe for her name, address, and telephone number.  Defendant Gant also told Ms. Roe \nshe had a nice body. \n69.  The conversation in the hallway lasted approximately ten minutes.  Defendant \nGant left the area when a lookout alerted him that someone was approaching the housing unit \ndoor. \n70.  When Defendant Gant returned to the unit approximately one hour later, he \nagain asked Ms. Rogers, the Correctional Officer on duty, to allow Ms. Roe into the hallway \nalone with him. \n71.  Defendant Gant used his keys to try to open various doors along the hallway \nuntil he found a lock he could open.  Defendant Gant opened the door to a small room that was \nused as a broom closet. \n72.  Defendant Gant threatened Ms. Roe by telling her that because he worked in the \nCTF records department, he had the ability to erase the records of her jail credit.  Without that \ncredit, Ms. Roe's incarceration at CTF would be extended by more than seventy (70) days. \n73.  Defendant Gant took Ms. Roe into the broom closet, pulled out his penis, and \ntold Ms. Roe to pull down her pants and shake her buttocks for him.  Defendant Gant touched \nMs. Roe's breasts and buttocks, pushed Ms. Roe to her knees, and forced her to perform oral sex \non him.  He then ejaculated on Ms. Roe and on the floor. \n74.  After the assault, Ms. Roe dressed and returned to her housing unit. \n75.  Ms. Roe reported the rape shortly after the incident.  She subsequently called \nthe DC DC sexual misconduct hotline on December 30,2003. \n12 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 13 of 22\n76.  CTF internal affairs then began an investigation. \n77.  Ms. Roe's rape and the subsequent investigation did not remain confidential and \nbecame the subject of rumors among the staff at CCA. \n78.  The only protection Ms. Roe was offered was \"protective custody,\" which is \nessentially solitary confinement where she would have been locked in her cell at least twenty \nthree (23) hours per day and denied many privileges available to inmates held in general \npopulation.  Moreover, even in protective custody, CCA staff would still have had access to her. \nMs. Roe refused these punitive conditions. \n79.  On January 3,2004, Defendant Gant was suspended from work at CTF, but \nallowed to continue receiving full pay. \n80.  On January 3,2004, several correctional officers came to Ms. Roe's unit \nlooking for the inmate who reported Defendant Gant for rape, sodomy, and sexual misconduct. \nMs. Roe was frightened and upset by the fact that the rape and assault were clearly common \nknowledge. \n81.  On January 16, 2004, Ms. Roe was released from CTF. \n82.  Four days later, Ms. Roe called to inquire about the status of the investigation \ninto her rape and assault. \n83.  During that conversation, Mr. Don Paul, Internal Affairs Investigator for CTF, \ndeliberately misinformed Ms. Roe that a third party was not pennitted to remain on the \ntelephone.  As a result, Ms. Roe's mother, whom Ms. Roe wished to be on the telephone,  was \nprevented from participating in the conversation regarding the rape, sodomy, and sexual assault. \n13 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 14 of 22\n84.  On January 23,2004, Defendant Gant chose to resign from CCA rather than \ngive a statement regarding the rape and sexual assault he perpetrated against Ms. Roe. \n85.  On March 15,2004, Warden Fred Figueroa, the warden at CTF at that time, \nissued a notice to Ms. Roe that her complaint of sexual misconduct was \"sustained,\" but since \nDefendant Gant had resigned, no further action would be taken. \n86.  On information and belief, CCA conducted no follow-up training with its \nemployees and agents to prevent future incidents of rape, sexual assault, and harassment. \n87.  On information and belief, CCA did not take reasonable steps to protect the \nconfidentiality of Ms. Roe. \n88.  On information and belief, CCA made no effort to improve the supervision of \nits staff. \n89.  Neither DCDC nor CCA made any attempt to transfer Ms. Roe to another \nfacility. \n90.  DCDC and CCA did not apologize to Ms. Roe.  DCDC and CCA did not \nrepudiate Defendant Gant's conduct. \n91.  On information and belief, DCDC was notified about Ms. Roe's rape but made \nno effort to improve the supervision of its agents or conduct any follow-up training with its \nemployees and agents to prevent future incidents of rape, sexual assault, and harassment. \n92.  Ms. Roe continues to suffer the emotional, psychological, and physical effects \nofthe rape, sodomy, and sexual assault to this day. \n14 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 15 of 22\nLEGAL CLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution as Compensable bv the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n(Against Defendants McKnight, Gant, Corrections Corporation of America, and District of \nColumbia) \n93.  Ms. Doe and Ms. Roe incorporate by reference each of the allegations stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 92 as though fully restated herein. \n94.  Defendant McKnight, in raping, sodomozing, and assaulting Ms. Doe, and \nDefendant Gant, in raping, sodomozing, and assaulting Ms. Roe, invaded Plaintiffs' rights in a \ndeliberate, willful, malicious, and outrageous manner that shocks the conscience. \n95.  Defendants McKnight and Gant acted under color of state law. \n96.  Defendants' rapes and sexual assaults of Plaintiffs constituted cruel and unusual \npunishment and intentional, unnecessary, and wanton infliction of pain in violation of the Eighth \nand Ninth Amendments of the United States Constitution. \n97.  The deprivations of Plaintiffs' rights described herein are not reasonably related \nto the furtherance of any legitimate interest in security or any other legitimate interest. \n98.  Defendants McKnight and Gant deprived Plaintiffs ofliberty without due \nprocess oflaw in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n99.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants McKnight's and Gant's unlawful \nand malicious rapes and sexual assaults, Plaintiffs were deprived of their rights to be secure in \ntheir persons against unreasonable seizure of their persons, in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution. \n15 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 16 of 22\n100.  CCA, as Defendants McKnight's and Gant's private employer, is liable for the \nwrongdoings of its employees. \n101.  The District's duty to provide constitutional treatment to people it incarcerates \nis a non-delegable duty.  The District is, therefore, liable for the constitutional wrongdoings of its \ncontractors, including CCA. \n102.  As a direct and proximate result of the actions of Defendants McKnight, Gant, \nCCA, and the District of Columbia, Plaintiffs endured humiliation, physical injury, severe \nemotional distress, psychic trauma, and other injuries. \n103.  The actions of Defendants McKnight and Gant were willful, wanton, malicious, \nand oppressive.  Their actions were motivated by an evil intent and show a callous disregard for \nthe rights of Ms. Doe and Ms. Roe, thus entitling Ms. Doe and Ms. Roe to an award of punitive \ndamages. \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution as Compensible bv the Civil Rights Act of 1871,42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n(Against Defendants District of Columbia and Corrections Corporation of America) \n104.  Ms. Doe and Ms. Roe incorporate by reference each of the allegations stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 103 as though fully restated herein. \n105.  The District and CCA each violated their respective constitutional duties to \nPlaintiffs by adopting a policy, custom, pattern, or practice of allowing male guards unsupervised \naccess to female inmates and negligently hiring, supervising, training, and monitoring employees \nand agents. \n106.  Prior to the incidents involving Ms. Doe and Ms. Roe, the District and CCA had \nlearned of several previous incidents of staff rape and sexual misconduct against female inmates \n16 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 17 of 22\nat the facilities that make up the DCDC.  The District and CCA took no reasonable actions to \ntrain, supervise, or monitor correctional officers to prevent them from repeating such incidents, \nand the District and CCA failed to alter policies, practices, and procedures at CTF to prevent \nmale staff unsupervised access to female inmates.  The District's and CCA's failures to act to \nprevent repeated incidents tacitly authorized the conduct.  If the District and CCA had taken such \nremedial action after the rapes and sexual assaults of prior inmates occurred, the rapes and sexual \nassaults Plaintiffs complain of here would not have occurred. \n107.  The conduct of the District and CCA was attributable to a final policymaker or \namounted to a policy or custom that directly and proximately caused the violations of Plaintiffs' \nconstitutional rights and caused Plaintiffs to suffer injuries. \n108.  At all times relevant to this complaint, McKnight and Gant, as correctional \nofficers at CCA, were acting under the direction and control of the District and CCA, and were \nacting pursuant to the policies, practice, and customs of the District and CCA. \n109.  Acting under color oflaw and pursuant to official policy, practice, or custom, \nthe District and CCA negligently hired McKnight and Gant and intentionally, knowingly, \nrecklessly, and negligently failed to instruct, train, and supervise McKnight and Gant on a \ncontinuing basis. \n110.  The District and CCA knew or should have known that the wrongs complained \nof were reasonably likely to be committed.  The District and CCA had the power to prevent the \ncommission of these wrongs, could have done so by reasonable diligence, and intentionally, \nknowingly, recklessly, or negligently failed to do so. \n17 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 18 of 22\nIll.  The conduct of the District and CCA amounted to deliberate indifference to the \nFourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth Amendment rights of Ms. Doe and Ms. Roe. \n112.  As a direct and proximate result of the actions of the District and CCA, Ms. Doe \nand Ms. Roe endured humiliation, physical injury, severe emotional distress, psychic trauma, and \nother injuries. \n113.  The actions and omissions of the District and CCA were undertaken with evil \nmotive, actual malice, or in willful, wanton, callous, or malicious disregard of Plaintiffs' rights \nand were outrageous or reckless, thus entitling Plaintiffs to punitive damages. \nCOUNT III \nNegligent Supervision and Hiring \n(Against Defendants District of Columbia and Corrections Corporation of America) \n114.

The District and CCA breached their duties by failing to make sufficient \ninquiries and determinations in the hiring of McKnight and Gant and by failing to train and \nsupervise properly McKnight and Gant. \n117.  As a direct and foreseeable result of the negligent hiring, training, and \nsupervision, Ms. Doe and Ms. Roe endured humiliation, physical injury, severe emotional \ndistress, psychological trauma, and other injuries. \n18 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-02203-ESH   Document 3   Filed 12/14/06   Page 19 of 22\n118.
