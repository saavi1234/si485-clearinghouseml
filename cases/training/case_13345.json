ENDORSEMENT: The application to divide the time of the non party deponents is denied. Plaintiff may depose the witnesses for the full 7 hours the Rules allow. It is clear that the defendants counsel has access to witnesses which plaintiff does not have. Plaintiff can gain access only by way of subpoena, and it would be unfair to truncate the time allowed for by the rules. The parties should work in good faith to resolve their disputes and, if possible, share the deposition time, but so it is clear plaintiff is entitled to the full time allowed for the non party witness it has subpoenaed. As to the identification of the complaining witness the parties should not publicize the name and the Court will address this matter at the next pretrial conference. SO ORDERED.

Larkin dated June 24, 2009 re: We write in response to plaintiffs letter of yesterdays date concerning their requests (1) for an open-ended, forty-five day extension of all discovery, and (2) for an order adjourning plaintiffs deposition. We advised plaintiffs counsel yesterday that we do not object to an extension of discovery to allow depositions now scheduled to proceed, but that we do object to an unrestricted discovery extension. We also advised counsel that we object to adjourning plaintiffs deposition given the late stage of discovery, and given the number of depositions that already have been pushed into July (subject to Court approval). Accordingly, we submit that plaintiffs request should be denied, and that instead, the Court should enter a discovery order as set forth below. Because plaintiffs deposition is now scheduled for this Friday, June 26, we respectfully request that Your Honor decide the instant application as soon as reasonably practicable. ENDORSEMENT: (1) The request to adjourn Ms. Feinsteins deposition for 3 months is denied. The deposition must proceed as scheduled, (2) The City must complete document discovery forthwith; (3) The deposition of plaintiff currently scheduled for June 26, 2009, may be adjourned for up to 2 weeks but must be conducted and completed by no later than Friday July 10, 2009, (4) The discovery cutoff of June 30, 2009 is extended for one month to Friday July 31, 2009 (5) The conference scheduled for July 7, 2009 is adjourned, but if there are any further disputes, either side may call chambers and a conference will be scheduled immediately. In any event a conference will be scheduled at some time during the first two weeks of August. Mr. Ovalles, my Courtroom Deputy, will be in contact with the parties. SO ORDERED.

    "summary": "<p>On October 28, 2004, an instructor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the City of New York under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983.  The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that he was denied his constitutional due process right to a fair trial and was unlawfully incarcerated for 20 months due to the practices and policies of the City of New York as implemented by the New York Police Department and the New York County District Attorney's Office.  </p><p>This case originated with a claim of sexual assault against the plaintiff, who was at that time a doctoral student at Columbia University.  The victim, an undergraduate student at Barnard College, alleged that the plaintiff assaulted her for nearly twenty hours, stating that she had been tied up, violently raped and sodomized, beaten multiple times with a club, burned with candle wax and repeatedly gagged.  A Grand Jury indicted the plaintiff on December 19, 1996 and at trial, a jury found the plaintiff guilty of kidnapping, assault and sexual assault.  He was sentenced on May 29, 1998 to fifteen years to life in prison.  </p><p>On appeal, the Appellate Division, First Department, of the New York Supreme Court vacated the conviction due to errors in the trial court regarding the judge's application of rape-shield law. See People v. Jovanovic, 700 N.Y.S.2d 156 (1st Dept 1999). This led to a reversal of the plaintiff's conviction in December, 1999 and a remand for a new trial.  On November 1, 2001 the state dismissed all charges against the plaintiff after the victim refused to testify. </p><p>On October 28, 2004, the plaintiff filed suit under 42 U.S.C ยง1983 and 42 U.S.C ยง1988, seeking $20 million dollars in damages plus attorney's fees.  Specifically, the plaintiff stated multiple claims against a New York Police Department Detective for false arrest, malicious prosecution, malicious abuse of process, and denial of a fair trial.  The plaintiff also claimed that the Assistant District Attorney (ADA) assigned to the case deprived the plaintiff of his right to a fair trial.  Lastly, the plaintiff claimed that the City of New York maintained policies and customs that gave rise to the violation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights.  </p><p>On December 21, 2009, defendants moved for summary judgment on all of the plaintiff's claims.  Critical to the plaintiff's claims against the NYPD Detective was the plaintiff's allegation that the Detective fabricated evidence regarding the presence of candles in the plaintiff's apartment and that this false information unfairly influenced the jury, depriving the plaintiff of his right to a fair trial. </p><p>The District Court found that the Detective's allegedly false testimony could not, by itself, have resulted in the deprivation of the plaintiff's liberty because it was material to only one of the eleven charges against him.  Additionally, probable cause is a complete defense to malicious prosecution and malicious abuse of process claims under New York law.  Because a Grand Jury indictment creates a presumption of probable cause that the plaintiff failed to rebut, the District Court granted summary judgment to the defendant on both these claims.  </p><p>The plaintiff also alleged that the Assistant District Attorney assigned to his criminal trial made extrajudicial statements that violated the ADA's ethical responsibilities and deprived the plaintiff of a fair trial.  Although the plaintiff demonstrated that the ADA did make statements to the press, he failed to show that any juror was prejudiced by the ensuing news coverage.  Accordingly, the District Court held that no reasonable juror could find that the plaintiff had been deprived of his right to a fair trial. </p><p>The plaintiff also sought to hold the New York District Attorney's Office and the New York Police Department liable for the allegedly unconstitutional acts of its agents.  The plaintiff claimed that these municipal entities had official policies or customs of making inflammatory statements to the press that were prejudicial against defendants, which deprived them of their constitutional right to a fair trial. While the plaintiff had examples of such improper leaks in the instant case, the District Court found that the plaintiff failed to provide evidence that would adequately prove a policy or custom of the agencies in question.  </p><p>On September 28, 2012, the District Court (Judge Paul A. Crotty) ruled in favor of the defendants, and granted their motion for summary judgment in its entirety.  The plaintiff appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which on August 28, 2012, affirmed the District Court's grant of summary judgment.</p><p></p>",

At all times hereinafter mentioned defendant LINDA FAIRSTEIN (โFAIRSTEINโ)\nwas the Chief of the Sex Crimes Unit of the New York County District Attorneyโs Office, and as\nsuch, was responsible for the policies, practices and customs of the Sex Crimes Unit, as well as the\ntraining, retention, supervision, discipline, counseling and control of the assistant district attorneys\nwho worked under her command and in this unit.\n12.

Each and all of the acts of the defendants alleged herein were done by said \ndefendants while acting in furtherance of their employment by defendant City of New York.\n FACTS\n16.  On December 5, 1996, at approximately 11:00 a.m.,  plaintiff OLIVER \nJOVANOVIC was lawfully inside of his apartment at 680  Fort Washington Avenue, in the County,\nCity and State of New York. \n17. At the aforesaid time and place, Defendant MILTON BONILLA, a detective with\nthe Special Victims Squad of the New York City Ploice Department, arrived at plaintiffโs apartment.\n-3-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 5 of 34\n18. Thereafter, defendant MILTON BONILLA ordered plaintiff to get dressed and go\nwith him to the 26th precinct for purposes of being interrogated.\n19. Defendant MILTON BONILLA refused to provide plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC\nwith any information as to the nature of this interrogation.\n20. Defendant MILTON BONILLA attempted to question plaintiff OLIVER \nJOVANOVIC without an attorney being present. \n21. When plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC requested an attorney, he was immediately\nplaced under arrest. \n22. At the time of his arrest, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was a 30- year-old doctoral\ncandidate at Columbia University who had previously earned a B.A. and M.S. from the University\nof Chicago, and an M.A. and M.Ph. from Columbia University.  He  had never before been arrested.\nThe Allegations of the Complaining Witness\n23. On November 27, 1996, the purported โvictimโ, JAMIE RZUCEK (โRZUCEKโ) a\n20-year-old Barnard College student, spoke withd efendant MILTON BONILLA  and told him  that\nshe had been sexually assaulted by plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC for 20 hours, starting on the\nnight of November 22, 1996 and continuing through the day of November 23, 1996. \n24. Specifically, RZUCEK claimed, inter alia, that plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC: (1)\nhad  raped and sodomized her; (2) had violently rammed a police baton into her anus and vagina,\nresulting in bleeding; (3) had struck her repeatedly with a club, resulting in multiple bruises to her\nthighs;  (4) had severely burned her with hot candle wax; (5) had bitten her breasts and shoulders\nuntil she bled profusely;  (6) had hogtied her against her will for nearly 20 hours; and (7) had\nrepeatedly gagged her with a variety of materials, including duct tape, packing tape, cotton and an\nace bandage.\n-4-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 6 of 34\n \nThe Medical Findings\n25. Each one of RZUCEKโs claims was contradicted by  medical evidence obtained \nwithin days of the alleged incident. \n26.  On November 27, 1996, RZUCEK was given a comprehensive anal and vaginal \nexamination by a gynecologist at Barnard Health Services, Dr. Chin Quee.  \n27. Dr. Quee found no bruises, scratches or abrasions in the vaginal area, and no \nlacerations, bruises or fissures in the anal area.\n28. Dr. Quee found no vaginal bleeding and no rectal bleeding, even though RZUCEK\ntold her she had experienced vaginal bleeding for three days. \n29.       The results of a hemoccult test โ a very sensitive test to detect traces of blood in the\nstool โ were negative. \n30. There were no bruises on RZUCEKโs thighs, no burn marks, no teeth marks and \nno scabbing, swelling, redness or tenderness in the nipple area. \nThe Forensic Findings \n31. There was also no forensic evidence to support any of RZUCEKโs claims.\n32. Testing revealed that there was no trace of plaintiffโs DNA found on RZUCEK, on\nher clothing, or on any of her undergarments worn on the night of the alleged assault.  \n33. There was no blood found on any of RZUCEKโs underclothing or on any of her \nclothes, despite her claim that she had bled profusely from her  breasts, anus and vagina.\n34. There was no candle wax found on any of RZUCEKโs garments and no burn \nmarks were discovered on her body.   \n35. There were no ligature marks found anywhere on RZUCEKโs body, despite her \nclaim that she had been hogtied for 20 hours and had thrashed violently against the ropes in an effort\n-5-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 7 of 34\nto escape.\n36. There were no abrasions, cuts or tape marks found on RZUCEKโs lips or face, \ndespite her claim that she had been repeatedly and violently gagged during the incident.\n37. The hair and fiber tests were negative, showing no signs of a violent struggle or \nsexual assault, although a pubic hair belonging to an unknown third party was found i nside of\nRZUCEKโs panties.\nThe Credibility of the Accuser \n38.   Apart from the lack of any medical or forensic evidence, there were significant \nreasons to doubt RZUCEKโs credibility.\n39. Within days of the purported incident, RZUCEK had given multiple and \ncontradictory accounts of the alleged assault, changing critical facts each time she recounted the \nevent. \n40. RZUCEK had a history of making false sexual allegations, and in fact had falsely \naccused her own father and uncle of sexual molestation.  \n41. RZUCEK  had also encouraged an acquaintance to file a false rape copmlaint against\nan NYU student only one week prior to the alleged incident.\n42. RZUCEK had waited almost four days before seeking any medical attention, despite\nher claims of experiencing profuse bleeding, severe burns and intense pain. \n43. RZUCEK did not speak with Barnard security, the police or any other law \nenforcement agency until four days after the alleged incident.  \n44. After extensively interviewing RZUCEK on November 27, 1996, defendant \nMILTON  BONILLA did not then place OLIVER JOVANOVIC under arrest, despite RZUCEKโs\nclaims of being brutally tortured, raped and sodomized.\n45.  Defendant MILTON BONILLA waited 9 days prior to arresting plaintiff OLIVER\n-6-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 8 of 34\nJOVANOVIC. \n46. During this 9-day period, from the time of the initial complaint to the time of the \narrest, defendant MILTON BONILLA conducted no further investigation into this matter.  \n47. Notwithstanding the lack of any medical or forensic evidence, on December 5, 1996,\ndefendant MILTON BONILLA arrested plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC and charged him with \ncommitting multiple offenses, including Rape, Sodomy, and Unlawful Imprisonment.\n48. Defendant MILTON BONILLA arrestedp laintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC only after\nbeing pressured to do so by third parties.\n49. Specifically, Bill O'Connor, Director of Security at Barnard College, contacted \ndefendant Bonilla on multiple occasions between November 27, 1996 and December 5, 1996.\n50. During this period, Mr. O'Connor repeatedly urged defendant MILTON BONILLA\nto place plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC under arrest. \n51. Mr. O'Connor stated to defendant MILTON BONILA that he would contact high-\nlevel officials at the NYPD if defendant MILTON BONILLA did not place plaintiff OLIVER \nJOVANOVIC under arrest.\n52. Another individual by the name of Lorraine Mohr indirectly pressured defendant \nMILTON BONILLA to place plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC under arrest. \n53. Ms. Mohr, who was general counsel for Phoenix House, had hired RZUCEK as a \nbabysitter in February 1996. \n54. On November 25, 1996, RZUCEK told Ms. Mohr about the alleged assault involving\nplaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC. \n55. Thereafter, Ms. Mohr contacted defendant MILTON BONILLA's superiors on \nmultiple occasions between November 26, 1996 and December 5, 1996 . \n56. During this period, Ms. Mohr repeatedly urged defendant MILTON BONILLA's \n-7-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 9 of 34\nsuperiors to place plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC under arrest.\n \n57. Defendant MILTON BONILLA learned that Ms. Mohr had contacted his superiors\non multiple occasions between November 26, 1996 and December 5, 1996. \n58. Defendant MILTON BONILLA learned that Ms. Mohr had repeatedly urged his \nsuperiors to place plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC under arrest. \n59. As a result of the pressure applied by both Bill O'Connor and Lorraine Mohr, \ndefendant MILTON BONILLA placed plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC under arrest on December\n5, 1996.  \n60. Defendant MILTON BONILLA placed plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC under arrest\nin order to protect his position as a detective with the New York City Police Department. \n61.   Defendant MILTON BONILLA knew that a former colleague of his, a detective in\nthe Manhattan Sex Crimes Unit, had lost his position when he refused to make an arrest in a high-\nprofile case, despite pressure from his superiors and third parties to do so.   \n62. Defendant MILTON BONILLA was fearful that he too would face demotion and/or\nreassignment if he did not place plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC under arrest at the behest of Mr.\nO'Connor and Ms. Mohr.\nThe Search of Plaintiffโs Apartment \n63. On December 5, 1996, after plaintiff was arrested, defendant MILTON BONILLA\nand several other police officers conducted a search of his premises, located at 680 Ft. Washington\nAvenue, Apartment 2F, in the City, County and State of New York.   \n64. Police were looking to find the items which had allegedly been used by plaintiff in\nthe attack against RZUCEK. \n65. Specifically, police were looking to find, inter alia, a police baton, candles, candle\n-8-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 10 of 34\nwax, a blindfold, cloth strips, duct tape, packing tape, and ace bandages.\n66. No such items were ever recovered from plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC or his \napartment. \n67. During this search, multiple photographs were taken of the interior of plaintiffโs \napartment. \n68. The photographs revealed that none of thei tems described in Paragraph โ51\", supra,\nwere inside of plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVICโs apartment. \n69. These photographs, taken by two separate investigative teams, were subsequently \nโlostโ by defendant MILTON BONILLA and/or the New York City Police Department. \nBonillaโs Post-Search Activities\n70. After the search was executed, defendant MILTON BONILLA prepared certain   \npolice reports and forwarded them to prosecutors in the New York County District Attorneyโs \nOffice. \n71. These reports contained false and misleading information regarding the arrest of \nplaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC, as well as the evidence allegedly collected from his apartment. \n72. In addition to these  reports, defendant MILTON BONILLA told prosecutors from\nthe New York County District Attorneyโs office  that he had observed certain incriminating evidence\ninside of  plaintiffโs apartment, when he knew this claim to be untrue. \n73. Defendant MILTON BONILLA also told prosecutors  from the New York County\nDistrict Attorneyโs office that plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC had conspired to obstruct the police\nat the time of the search, and had destroyed certain incriminating evidence  prior to the search, when\nhe knew these claims to be untrue.\n74. Thereafter, defendant MILTON BONILLA repeated the above false and misleading\nclaims before the grand jury, the trial judge and the petit jury. \nThe Arraignment \n-9-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 11 of 34\n75.   On December 6, 1996, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was arraigned  before \nthe Honorable Michael Gross, in the Criminal Court of the City of New York, County of New York,\nat 100 Centre Street.   \n76. Defendant LINDA FAIRSTEIN (โFAIRSTEINโ), the Chief of the Sex Crimes \nUnit of the New York County District AttorneyโsO  ffice, personally appeared at the arraignment of\nplaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC as the sole representative of that office. \nDefendant Fairsteinโs Post-Arraignment Statements to the Press\n77. In the days following plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVICโs arraignment, defendant \nFAIRSTEIN spoke to numerous news reporters and was quoted extensively in local newspaper \narticles.  \n78. In these articles, defendant FAIRSTEIN made a number of  highly inflammatory and\nprejudicial remarks about plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC, none of which was true.  \n79.  The following statements in the articles were attributed directly to defendant \nFAIRSTEIN and illustrate the type of extrajudicial remarks that defendant FAIRSTEIN made to the\npress in the days following plaintiffโs arraignment:  \nโข โHe terrorized this young woman to the point that she was too frightened to\ncall the authorities until weeks after it happenedโ;\nโข โHe tied her to a chair, undressed her,  and tortured her with sex toys and\nother objects for almost a full dayโ;\nโข โ[H]e tortured and sexually abused the woman, burning her with candle wax,\nbiting her, sexually assaulting her  and threatening to dism ember her as\nJeffrey  Dahmer, the serial killer, had done with his victimsโ;\nโข He โtied the womanโs legs to a chair and gagged her before sexually torturing\nherโ;\n-10-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 12 of 34\nโข โ[H]e was so prepared for this and carried it off so smoothlyโ;\nโข โWe believe this was not the first time he did something like thisโ; and \nโข โWe believe there are other victims.โ\n80. Defendant FAIRSTEINโs comments made the headlines of all local newspapers.  \nOne New York Post cover page, for example, screamed โProsecutor: Cyber fiend struck beforeโ and\nโHOW MANY MORE VICTIMS?โ, while featuring a full page picture of plaintiff OLIVER \nJOVANOVIC.\n81. In addition to the foregoing, defendant FAIRSTEIN repeatedly emphasized  to the\npress that this was her officeโs โfirst Internet-related sex prosecutionโ and that the case represented\na โwhole new entry in the acquaintance-rape category.โ\nThe Pre-Trial Publicity \n82. Defendant FAIRSTEIN, through her extrajudicial statements to the press,  created\na highly prejudicial and inflamed atmosphere against plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC. \n83. In local newspapers, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC  became known as the \nโCybersex Fiendโ and โCybersex Suspectโ, and his case became known as the โCyber Tortureโ case.\n84. In the first two weeks after plaintiffโs arrest, there were 76 articles in local \nnewspapers which repeated defendant FAIRSTEINโS false statements.  Plaintiffโs case became a\ncover page story.\n85. In these articles, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was repeatedly portrayed as \na serial killer and โCyberfiendโ, and was often compared with Jeffrey Dahmer. \n86. The โCybersexโ story was picked up by the Associated Press, which extensively \nquoted defendant FAIRSTEIN and her false allegations against plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC.\n-11-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 13 of 34\n87. Major television networks and radio stations soon joined the coverage, and the\nstory began to receive national and international attention.\n88.  Throughout the pre-trial proceedings, defendant FAIRSTEIN continued to provide\nhighly damaging โleaksโ to the press, including but not limited to, releasing  select  portions of the\ne-mail correspondence between plaintiff OL IVER JOVANOVIC and RZUCEK which further\ndemonized plaintiff.  \n89. Defendant FAIRSTEIN knew that the pre-trial publicity that she had generated \nwould have an impact on prospective jurors int he criminal trial of plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC.\n90. In an interview given to the Media Studie sJournal in the winter of 1998, just months\nprior to plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVICโs trial, defendant FAIRSTEIN acknowledged the damaging\nimpact that pre-trial publicity can have on prospective jurors:\nThe period of greatest impact is pretrial because that could be anywhere from three\nmonths to a year.  Depending on the coverage, people can becom e immersed in\nreading about the case.  And from this reading-and-listening public come the people\nwho sit on our juries.  After the trial has bgeun, the jurors are given a rule โ  that they\ndonโt read or listen to media accounts of the case.  Most people try hard to comply.\nBut itโs almost impossible with the highest-profile cases for it to really happen. \nWhen a case like Chambers, the jogger, the subway bomber or the World Trade \nCenter bomber is on trial in New York โ  and it is literally a page A1 headline โ our\njurors are coming to work on the subway and the bus .... I m ean you canโt sit on a\ntrain and not see whatโs there. ... And you deal with a jury pool that is just saturated\nwith that kind of information.  You hope that you get jurors  who are telling you the\ntruth, that they can set aside what theyโve heard and just listen to the evidence in the\ncourtroom. In the end, both sides use the press to great advantage before you ge t\nanywhere near the trial stage. \n(emphasis supplied)\n91. Defendant FAIRSTEIN acknowledged in the same interview that โitโs inappropriate\nfor prosecutors to be spinning the case to the mediaโ, and as a result,  โwe donโt try our cases on the\n-12-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 14 of 34\ncourtroom  steps or to the press. We try them in the courtroom.โ \n92. Notwithstanding the above-stated policy, defendant FAIRSTEIN continued to make\nextrajudicial statements to the press and/or provide damaging โleaksโ to the media throughout all\nphases of the criminal proceedings against plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC. \n93. As a  result of defendant FAIRSTEINโs conduct, the prejudicial news coverage \ncontinued up to and including the trial, and  influecned the ability of the jury pool and the jurors who\nsat on the case to be fair and impartial, and also influenced the testimony of witnesses, jury \ndeliberations, and, ultimately, the outcome of the case. \nThe Verdict, The Appeal and The Subsequent Dismissal\n94. On April 15, 1998, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was convicted of Kidnaping in\nthe First Degree, three counts of Sexual Abuse in the First Degree, Assault in the Second Degree\nand Assault in the Third Degree. \n95. Thereafter, the Honorable William A. Wetzel sentenced plaintiff OLIVER \nJOVANOVIC to 15 years to life in prison.   \n96. On December 21, 1999,  the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme \nCourt reversed plaintiffโs conviction, finding inter alia, that Justice William A. Wetzel had \nโimproperly hampered the defendantโs ability to present a defenseโ by erroneously invoking the \nrape-shield law to deny the jury access to key evidence in the case.\n97. In anticipation of a second trial, the porsecution repeatedly offered plaintiff OLIVER\nJOVANOVIC plea deals in which he would avoid any further time in prison if he would plead guilty\nto a single felony charge.  \n98. When plaintiff refused to consider any of t hese offers, the prosecution offered a plea\n-13-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 15 of 34\ndeal in which plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC would avoid any further incarceration, any felony\nrecord and any sex offender status if he would plead guilty to a single non-sexual, misdemeanor \ncharge.  \n99. Plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC refused to accept this offer โ despite facing a \nmandatory 15-year-to-life sentence on the felony Kidnapping charge โ and insisted upon going \nforward with the second trial. \n100. On the eve of re-trial on  November 1, 2001, the prosecution  moved to dismiss all\ncharges against plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC.   The motion was granted. \n101. On November 1, 2001, all charges against plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC were \ndismissed with prejudice. \nPlaintiffโs Damages\n102. As a result of his unlawful arrest and prosecution, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC\nwas incarcerated for one week at Rikers Island prior to trial, and 20 m onths in Rikers Island and\nstate prisons following his conviction. \n103. During this time, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was repeatedly threatened and \nattacked by other inmates. \n104. On one occasion while in prison, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was stabbed in the\nneck and had his throat slashed by another inmate, and came within inches of losing his life. \n105. Apart from the violence and hardships of prison life, plaintiff OLIVER  \nJOVANOVIC suffered severe damage to his career and reputation.  \n106.  At the time of his arrest on December 5, 1996, plaintiff had completed his research\nat Columbia University for a Ph.D. degree inM  icrobiology, had written his doctoral thesis, and was\n-14-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 16 of 34\nscheduled to defend his thesis to the faculty on December 20, 1996. \n107. As a direct result of his unlawful arrest and prosecution, plaintiff OLIVER \nJOVANOVIC was prevented for over five years from defending his thesis and obtaining his Ph.D.\nin Microbiology.\n108. It was not until May 7, 2002, that plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was able to \ndefend his doctorate and earn a Ph.D. with distinction from Columbia University, as well as \ndepartmental honors for outstanding and innovative work. \n109. Notwithstanding this accomplishment, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC suffered\nsubstantial economic losses as a result of his unlawful arrest and prosecution,  including but not \nlimited to, six years of lost wages as a specialist in computational biology. \n110. In addition, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was forced to incur substantial \nattorneysโ fees in connection with his defense, including but not limited to, legal fees for handling\nthe trial, the appeal, and preparation for the second trial. \n111. Apart from  deprivation of liberty and economic losses, plaintiff OLIVER \nJOVANOVIC also suffered severe emotional distress and psychological damage as a result of \ndefendantsโ unlawful actions, as well as  permanent and irreparable damage to his good name and\nreputation.\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\nFALSE ARREST UNDER 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n112.

Plaintiff repeats, reiterates and realleges each and every allegation contained in \nparagraphs โ1\" through โ141\" as if the same were more fully set forth at length herein.\n143. Defendant FAIRSTEIN made extrajudicial statements to the press regarding \nOLIVER JOVANOVIC. \n144.     Defendant FAIRSTEIN  knew that her extrajudicial statements about plaintiff \nOLIVER JOVANOVIC were false and/or misleading.\n145.       Defendant FAIRSTEIN made such extrajudicial statements in order to gain an unfair\nadvantage over plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC at trial.\n146. Defendant FAIRSTEIN made such extrajudicial statements in order to create a โhigh-\nprofileโ case that would advance her own career goals and/or generate publicity for the sale of her\ncrime novels.\n-19-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 21 of 34\n147.

As a  result of defendant FAIRSTEINโesx trajudicial statements to the press, plaintiff\nOLIVER JOVANOVIC was the subject of extensive and highly prejudicial news coverage. \n150.    This negative publicity influenced the ability of the jury pool and jurors who sat on\nthe case to be fair and impartial, and also influenced the testimony of several important witnesses\nat trial and the deliberations of the jury.\n151.     For example, one material witness, Mary Jo Parlier Chambers, testified about critical\nโfactsโ that she had actually learned from reading a newspaper article. \n152. These โfactsโ, as testified to by Ms. Chambers, were addressed by both parties \nduring summations and were the subje ct of a read-back requested by the jury during their\ndeliberations. \n153.

Plaintiff repeats, reiterates and realleges each and every allegation contained in \nparagraphs โ1\" through โ154\" as if the same were more fully set forth at length herein.\n156. Defendant GAIL HEATHERLY, in her investigative capacity, met with and \ninterviewed several potential witnesses during her pre-trial investigation. \n157. Defendant GAIL HEATHERLY, in her investigative capacity, learned that these \nwitnesses possessed material and exculpatory information which would be helpful to the defense.\n158. Defendant GAIL HEATHERLY, in her investigative capacity, specifically \ninstructed these witnesses not to speak to with members of the defense team.  \n159. Defendant GAIL HEATHERLY, in her investigative capacity, threatened to  \ndisclose embarrassing personal details about these witnesses if they agreed to cooperate with the\ndefense team.\n160. As an example of the conduct alleged in paragraphs โ141\" through โ144\", defendant\nGAIL HEATHERLY met a witness named Kenneth Krompinger  during the early phases of  her\ninvestigation into this matter.\n  161. Mr. Krompinger lived directly beneath plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC and could\neasily hear noise from plaintiffโs apartment, including people talking and walking. \n162. Mr. Krompinger told defendant GAIL HEATHERLY that he was home throughout\nthe entire period of the alleged assault and thath e never heard any screams from plaintiff OLIVER\nJOVANOVICโS apartment. \n163. Mr. Krompinger further told defendantG  AIL HEATHERLY that he recalled hearing\na quiet back-and-forth conversation upstairs on the following day.  \n-21-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 23 of 34\n164. The information provided by Mr. Krompinger was highly relevant and would have\nundercut  RZUCEKโs claim  that she had been tortured and had been scream ing on-and-off\nthroughout the  20-hour ordeal. \n165. After speaking with Mr. Krompinger, defendant GAIL HEATHERLY threatened to\nexpose Mr. Krompingerโs medical and psychiatric history if he agreed to cooperate with the defense.\n166. After meeting with defendant GAIL HEATHERLY, Mr. Krom pinger refused to\nspeak with members of the defense team.   Accordingly, neither the defense nor the jury learned of\nMr. Krompingerโs exculpatory evidence.\n165.   As a  result of defendant GAIL HEATHERLYโs unlawful actions, plaintiff  \nOLIVER JOVANOVIC was denied an opportunity to persent material and exculpatory information\nat his criminal trial.\n166. As a  result of defendant GAIL HEATHERLYโs unlawful actions,  plaintiff OLIVER\nJOVANOVIC was denied due process of law, his liberty was restricted for an extended period of\ntime, he was put in fear for his safety, he was  attacked by other inmates, he was physically and\nemotionally injured, he was repeatedly strip-searched and humiliated, and he suffered substantial\neconomic losses and permanent damage to his reputation.\nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\nMUNICIPAL LIABILITY UNDER 42 U.S.C. ยง  1983 \n167. Plaintiff repeats, reiterates and realleges each and every allegation contained in \nparagraphs โ1\" through โ166\" as if the same were more fully set forth at length herein.\n168. Defendants continued criminal proceedings against plaintiff despite a lack of  \ncredible evidence against him, and notwithstanding their knowledge that said proceedings would\njeopardize plaintiffโs liberty, well-being, safety and constitutional rights.\n-22-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 24 of 34\n169. The acts complained of were carried out by the aforementioned individual \ndefendants in their capacities as police officers, assistant district attorneys and officials pursuant\nto the customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures, and rules of the City of New York, the\nNew York City Police Department, the New York County District Attorneyโs Office  and the\nSex Crimes Unit, all under the supervision of ranking officers of said department, office and\nunit.\nI. Extrajudicial Statements By the Prosecution in High-Profile Criminal Cases\n170.    At all times herein mentioned, defendant CITY OF NEW YORK, through the  \nNew York County District Attorneyโs office  and  the Sex Crimes Unit, had a custom, practice and\npolicy of allowing assistant district attorneys to make extrajudicial statements to the press in high-\nprofile criminal cases, so as to inflame public opinion against such defendants and deprive them of\ntheir constitutional right to a fair trial. \n171. The aforesaid policy, custom and practice can be inferred in part from repeated \ninstances in which the New York County DistricAt ttorneyโs office,  through defendant FAIRSTEIN\nand/or assistant district attorneys in the Sex Crimes Unit acting under her supervision, engaged in\nthe following tactics in high-profile criminal cases: \n(a) Providing systematic โleaksโof information to the press which were \ndamaging to the accused; \n(b) Releasing to the press negative information about the accused, including his\nprior arrest history and criminal record; \n(c) Publicly discussing the m erits of the case and/or incrim inating evidence\nwhich  had been gathered against the accused; \n           (d) Expressing opinions about the accusedโs guilt or innocence prior to the      \ncommencement of trial;  \n(e) Maligning the character and reputation of the accused; \n-23-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 25 of 34\n(f) Stating that the accused had engaged in sim ilar conduct before without\nevidence to  support such statements; and\n(g) Commenting on the identity, testim ony and/or credibility of prospective\nwitnesses who would testify against the accused. \n172.    The existence of the aforesaid customs, policies and practices of defendant \nCITY OF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York County District Attorneyโs office and the\nSex Crimes Unit, is evident in the following high-profile criminal cases, among others: \n(a) The โCybersex Tortureโ Case; \n(b) The โCentral Park Joggerโ Case; \n   (c) The โPreppie Murderโ Case against Robert Chambers;\n(d) The Sexual Abuse case against Dr. Patrick Griffin; and \n(e) The Internet Sexual Assault case against Paul Krauth.\n173. In all of the above cases, prosecutors form the New York County District Attorneyโs\noffice made extrajudicial statements to the press which involved one or more of the improper tactics\nenumerated in Paragraph โ158\", supra, and which resulted in extensive negative publicity against\nthe accused.\n174.   The aforesaid policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or customs \nwere implemented by policymaking officials for the defendant City of New York, including but not\nlimited to, the District Attor ney of New York  County Robert Morgenthau and/or defendant\nFAIRSTEIN, who knew that:\n(a) to a moral certainty such policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or\ncustoms concern issues that regularly arise in the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases;\n(b) that such issues either present assistant district attorneys with difficult \nchoices of the sort that instruction, training and/o rsupervision would make less difficult, or that the\nneed for further instruction, training and/or supervision was demonstrated by a history of assistant\ndistrict attorneysโ mishandling such situations; and\n(c) despite their knowledge of said policies, procedures, regulations, practices\nand/or customs, the supervisory and policymaking officers and officials of the defendant CITY OF\nNEW YORK, as a m atter of policy, practice and custom , perpetuated or failed to take steps to\n-24-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 26 of 34\nterminate said policies, practices and/or customs, did not discipline or otherwise properly supervise\nthe employees engaged in them, did not effectively instruct, train and/or supervise such personnel\nwith regard to the proper constitutional and statutoyr requirements in the exercise of their authority,\nbut instead sanctioned the policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or custom s described\nabove, and in fact rewarded such assistant distrcit attorneys by giving them promotions and bonuses,\nthereby evincing a deliberate indifference to the effect of said policies, procedures, regul ations,\npractices and/or customs upon the constitutional rights of residents and citizens of the State of New\nYork.\n175. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the \nthe CITY OF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York County District Attorneyโs office and\nthe Sex Crimes Unit, constituted a deliberate indifference to the safety, well-being and constitutional\nrights of all defendants in high-profile criminal cases, including but not limited to, plaintiff OLIVER\nJOVANOVIC.\n176. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the \nCITY OF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York County District Attorneyโs office and the\nSex Crimes Unit City of New York, were the proximate cause of the constitutional violations\nsuffered by OLIVER JOVANOVIC as alleged herein. \n177. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the CITY\nOF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York County District Attorneyโs office and Se x\nCrimes Unit City of New York, were the moving force behind the constitutional violations suffered\nby plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC as alleged herein.\n178. As a proximate result of the foregoing practices and policies of the CITY OF NEW\nYORK, as implemented by the New York County District Attorneyโs office and the Sex Crimes\nUnit, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was denied his constitutional due process right to a fair trial\nand was incarcerated unlawfully for more than 20 months until all charges were dismissed against\nhim on November 1, 2001.\n-25-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 27 of 34\nII. โOff-the Recordโ Statements by NYPD Officials in High-Profile Criminal\nCases\n179.

The aforesaid policy, custom and practice can be inferred in part from repeated \ninstances in which the New York York Ci ty Police Department,  through its police officers,\ndetectives and/or investigators, engaged in the following tactics in high-profile criminal cases: \n(a) Providing  systematic  โleaksโof inform ation  to the press which we re\ndamaging to the accused; \n(b) Releasing to the press negative information about the accused, including his\nprior arrest history and criminal record; \n(c) Releasing to the press incrim inating evidence which  had been gathered\nagainst the accused; \n           (d) Expressing opinions about the accusedโs guilt or innocence prior to the      \ncommencement of trial;  \n(e)        Maligning the character and reputation of the accused; \n(f) Stating that the accused had engaged in sim ilar conduct before without\nevidence to  support such statements; and\n(g) Commenting on the identity, testim ony and/or credibility of pr ospective\nwitnesses who would testify against the accused.\n181.    The existence of the aforesaid customs, policies and practices of defendant \nCITY OF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York City Police Department, is evident in the\n-26-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 28 of 34\nfollowing high-profile criminal cases, among others: \n(a) The โCybersex Tortureโ Case; \n(b) The โCentral Park Joggerโ Case; \n   (c) The โPreppie Murderโ Case against Robert Chambers;\n(d) The Sexual Abuse case against Dr. Patrick Griffin; and \n(e) The Internet Sexual Assault case against Paul Krauth.\n182. In all of the above cases, law enforcement officials from the New York City Police\nDepartment, including but not limited, police officers, detectives, and/or investigators, made โoff-\nthe-recordโ statements to the press which involved one or more of the improper tactics enumerated\nin Paragraph โ167\", supra, and which resulted in extensive negative publicity against the accused\nwhich tainted the jury pool and deprived the accused of the constitutional right to a fair trial. \n  183.   The aforesaid policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or customs \nwere implemented by policymaking officials for the defendant City of New York, including but not\nlimited to, the police commissioner(s) and/or other high-ranking officials of the New York City\nPolice Department, who knew that:\n(a) to a moral certainty such policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or\ncustoms concern issues that regularly arise in the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases;\n(b)   that such issues either present police officers, detectives and/or  investigators\nwith difficult choices of the sort that instruc tion, training and/or supervi sion would make less\ndifficult, or that the need for further instruction, training and/or supervision was demonstrated by\na history of such employeesโ  mishandling such situations; and\n(c) despite their knowledge of said policies, procedures, regulations, practices\nand/or customs, the supervisory and policymaking officers and officials of the defendant CITY OF\nNEW YORK, as a m atter of policy, practice and custom, perpetuated or failed to take steps to\nterminate said policies, practices and/or customs, did not discipline or otherwise properly supervise\nthe employees engaged in them, did not effectively instruct, train and/or supervise such personnel\nwith regard to the proper constitutional and statutoyr requirements in the exercise of their authority,\nbut instead sanctioned the policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or custom s described\nabove, and in fact rewarded such em ployees by giving them promotions and bonuses, thereby\nevincing a deliberate indifference to the effect of said policies, procedures, regulations, practices\nand/or customs upon the constitutional rights of residents and citizens of the State of New York.\n-27-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 29 of 34\n184. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the \nthe CITY OF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York City Police Department, constituted\na deliberate indifference to the safety, well-being and constitutional rights of all defendants in high-\nprofile criminal cases, including but not limited to, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC.\n185. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the \nCITY OF NEW YORK, as im plemented by the New York City Polic e Department, were the\nproximate cause of the constitutional violations suffered by OLIVER JOVANOVIC as alleged\nherein.  186. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of\nthe CITY \nOF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New YorkC  ity Police Department, were the moving force\nbehind the constitutional violations suffered by plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC as alleged herein.\n187. As a proximate result of the foregoing practices and policies of the CITY OF NEW\nYORK, as implemented by the New York CityP olice Department, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC\nwas denied his constitutional due process right to a fair trial and was incarcerated unlawfully for\nmore than 20 months until all charges were dismissed against him on November 1, 2001.\nIII. Deliberate Indifference to the Training and Supervision of Assistant District\nAttorneys\n188. Apart from the foregoing practices and policies, defendant CITY OF NEW YORK\nexhibited a deliberate indifference toward the trainnig and supervision of assistant district attorneys\nin the New York County District Attorneyโs Office, in that defendant CITY OF NEW YORK:  \na) Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to properly instruct, train and/or supe rvise\nassistant district attorneys with regard to their obligations to discontinue a criminal\nprosecution when medical and/or forensic evidence is discovered which nega tes\nprobable cause and exonerates the accused; \nb) Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to properly instruct, train and/or supervi se\n-28-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 30 of 34\nassistant district attorneys with regard to their obligations to discontinue a criminal\nprosecution when it becomes apparent that the complaining witness is not credible;\nc)  Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to properly instruct, train a nd/or supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard to  their obligations to timely disclose all\nevidence  favorable  to the defense on the issues of guilt or innocence and\npunishment,  pursuant to the   due process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution, and to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S.\n83 (1963), and its progeny;\nd  ) Intentionally and/or recklessly failed t o properly instruct, train and/or supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard to their obligations to avoid threatening,\nintimidating, hiring and/or coercing potential defense witnesses and preventing them\nfrom testifying on behalf of the accused;\ne)  Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to properly instruct, train and/or  supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard to their obligations to avoid interfering with\na defendantโs constitutional right to a fa ir trial by instructing potential def ense\nwitnesses to not speak with defense counsel or investigators for the defense team;\nf) Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to properly instruct, train and/or supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard  to their obligations to avoid pressuring\npotential  defense  witnesses to give untruthful, erroneous, incom plete  and/or\nmisleading statements; \ng) Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to  properly instruct, train and/or supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard to their obligations to avoid adopting a โwin-\nat-all-costsโ approach to trial  which involves, inter alia, the following misconduct:\ncoaching and/or permitting witnesses to give inaccurate, false and/or misleading\ntestimony; tailoring witness testim ony to explain inconsistencies with physical\nevidence; altering medical and forensic expert reports to exclude information which\nis favorable to the defense; and withholdnig material facts from medical and forensic\nexperts to secure more favorable testimony from said experts; and  \n \nh)  Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to properly instruct, train and/or supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard to their obligations to avoid giving improper\nsummations which, inter alia: mistate  evidence; discuss evidence which is not part\nof the record; mischaracterize witness testimony;  personally attack the accused\nand/or defense counsel; invite speculation by the jury; inflame the passions of the\njury against the accused; and otherwise exceed the bounds of proper advocacy. \n189. The aforesaid deliberate indifference to the training and supervision of assistant \ndistrict attorneys of the New York County District Attorneyโs Office may also be inferred in part\nfrom an examination of the following criminal cases handled by said office, among others: \n-29-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 31 of 34\n(a)  The โCybersex Tortureโ Case; \n(b)   The โCentral Park Joggerโ Case; \n(c) The โPreppie Murderโ Case against Robert Chambers; and\n(d)  The Sexual Abuse case against Dr. Patrick Griffin.\n \n189. In all of the above cases, prosecutors form the New York County District Attorneyโs\noffice engaged in one or more of the improper tactics enumerated in Paragraph โ175\", supra, and\nthereby deprived the accused of the constitutional right to a fair trial.\n190.  The aforesaid deliberate indifference to the training and supervision of assistant \ndistrict attorneys by defendant CITY OF NEW YORK  may also be inferred from an analysis of\nconvictions obtained by the New York County District Attorneyโs office which have been reversed,\nmodified, or vacated based, inter alia, upon prosecutorial actions of the sort described in paragraph\n175, supra.\n191. The aforesaid deliberate indifference to the training and supervision of assistant \ndistrict attorneys was implemented as a policy, practice, and/or custom of defendant CITY OF NEW\nYORK by policymaking officials for defendant CITY OF NEW YORK including, but not limited\nto, the District Attorney of New York County Robert Morganthau and/or defendant FAIRSTEIN,\nwho knew that:\n(a) to a moral certainty that such policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or\ncustoms concern issues that regularly arise in the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases;\n \n(b) that such issues either present assistant district attorneys  with difficult choices\nof the sort that instruction, training and/or supervision will make less difficult, or that the need for\nfurther instruction, training and/or supervision was demonstrated by a history of assistant district\nattorneysโ mishandling such situations; and\nc) despite their knowledge of said policies, procedures, regulations, practices \nand/or customs, the supervisory and policymaking officers and officials of the defendant CITY OF\nNEW YORK, as a m atter of policy, practice and cu stom, perpetuated or failed to take steps t o\nterminate said policies, practices and/or customs, did not discipline or otherwise properly supervise\nthe employees engaged in them, did not effectively instruct, train and/or supervise such personnel\nwith regard to the proper constitutional and statutoyr requirements in the exercise of their authority,\n-30-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 40    Filed 09/18/06   Page 32 of 34\nbut instead sanctioned the policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or custom s described\nabove, and in fact rewarded such assistant distrcit attorneys by giving them promotions and bonuses,\nthereby evincing a deliberate indifference to the e ffect of said policies, procedures, regulations,\npractices and/or customs upon the constitutional rights of residents and citizens of the State of New\nYork.\n192. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the \nthe CITY OF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York County District Attorneyโs office and\nthe Sex Crimes Unit, constituted a deliberate indifference to the safety, well-being and constitutional\nrights of all defendants, including but not limited to, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC.\n193. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the \nCITY OF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York County District Attorneyโs office and the\nSex Crimes Unit City of New York, were the  proximate cause of the constitutional violations\nsuffered by OLIVER JOVANOVIC as alleged herein. \n194. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules o tfhe CITY\nOF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York County District Attorneyโs office and Sex\nCrimes Unit City of New York, were the moving force behind the constitutional violations suffered\nby plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC as alleged herein.\n195.

On December 5, 1996, at approximately 11:00 a.m.,  plaintiff OLIVER \nJOVANOVIC was lawfully inside of his apartment at 680  Fort Washington Avenue, in the County,\nCity and State of New York. \n17. At the aforesaid time and place, Defendant MILTON BONILLA, a detective with\nthe Special Victims Squad of theN  ew York City Police Department, arrived at plaintiffโs apartment.\n-3-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 4 of 32\n18. Thereafter, defendant MILTON BONILLA ordered plaintiff to get dressed and go\nwith him to the 26th precinct for purposes of being interrogated.\n19. Defendant MILTON BONILLA refused to provide plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC\nwith any information as to the nature of this interrogation.\n20. Defendant MILTON BONILLA attempted to question plaintiff OLIVER \nJOVANOVIC without an attorney being present. \n21. When plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC requested an attorney, he was immediately\nplaced under arrest. \n22. At the time of his arrest, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was a 30- year-old doctoral\ncandidate at Columbia University who had previously earned a B.A. and M.S. from the University\nof Chicago, and an M.A. and M.Ph. from Columbia University.  He  had never before been arrested.\nThe Allegations of the Complaining Witness\n23. On November 27, 1996, the purported โvictimโ, JAMIE RZUCEK (โRZUCEKโ) a\n20-year-old Barnard College student, spoke withd efendant MILTON BONILLA  and told him  that\nshe had been sexually assaulted by plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC for 20 hours, starting on the\nnight of November 22, 1996 and continuing through the day of November 23, 1996. \n24. Specifically, RZUCEK claimed, inter alia, that plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC: (1)\nhad  raped and sodomized her; (2) had violently rammed a police baton into her anus and vagina,\nresulting in bleeding; (3) had struck her repeatedly with a club, resulting in multiple bruises to her\nthighs;  (4) had severely burned her with hot candle wax; (5) had bitten her breasts and shoulders\nuntil she bled profusely;  (6) had hogtied her against her will for nearly 20 hours; and (7) had\nrepeatedly gagged her with a variety of materials, including duct tape, packing tape, cotton and an\nace bandage. \n-4-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 5 of 32\nThe Medical Findings\n25. Each one of RZUCEKโs claims was contradicted by  medical evidence obtained \nwithin days of the alleged incident. \n26.  On November 27, 1996, RZUCEK was given a comprehensive anal and vaginal \nexamination by a gynecologist at Barnard Health Services, Dr. Chin Quee.  \n27. Dr. Quee found no bruises, scratches or abrasions in the vaginal area, and no \nlacerations, bruises or fissures in the anal area.\n28. Dr. Quee found no vaginal bleeding and no rectal bleeding, even though RZUCEK\ntold her she had experienced vaginal bleeding for three days. \n29.       The results of a hemoccult test โ a very sensitive test to detect traces of blood in the\nstool โ were negative. \n30. There were no bruises on RZUCEKโs thighs, no burn marks, no teeth marks and \nno scabbing, swelling, redness or tenderness in the nipple area. \nThe Forensic Findings \n31. There was also no forensic evidence to support any of RZUCEKโs claims.\n32. Testing revealed that there was no trace of plaintiffโs DNA found on RZUCEK, on\nher clothing, or on any of her undergarments worn on the night of the alleged assault.  \n33. There was no blood found on any of RZUCEKโs underclothing or on any of her \nclothes, despite her claim that she had bled profusely from her  breasts, anus and vagina.\n34. There was no candle wax found on any of RZUCEKโs garments and no burn \nmarks were discovered on her body.   \n35. There were no ligature marks found anywhere on RZUCEKโs body, despite her \nclaim that she had been hogtied for 20 hours and had thrashed violently against the ropes in an effort\nto escape.\n-5-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 6 of 32\n36. There were no abrasions, cuts or tape marks found on RZUCEKโs lips or face, \ndespite her claim that she had been repeatedly and violently gagged during the incident.\n37. The hair and fiber tests were negative, showing no signs of a violent struggle or \nsexual assault, although a pubic hair belonging to an unknown third party was f ound inside of\nRZUCEKโs panties.\nThe Credibility of the Accuser \n38.   Apart from the lack of any medical or forensic evidence, there were significant \nreasons to doubt RZUCEKโs credibility.\n39. Within days of the purported incident, RZUCEK had given multiple and \ncontradictory accounts of the alleged assault, changing critical facts each time she recounted the \nevent. \n40. RZUCEK had a history of making false sexual allegations, and in fact had falsely \naccused her own father and uncle of sexual molestation.  \n41. RZUCEK  had also encouraged an acquaintance to file a false rape copmlaint against\nan NYU student only one week prior to the alleged incident.\n42. RZUCEK had waited almost four days before seeking any medical attention, despite\nher claims of experiencing profuse bleeding, severe burns and intense pain. \n43. RZUCEK did not speak with Barnard security, the police or any other law \nenforcement agency until four days after the alleged incident.  \n44. After extensively interviewing RZUCEK on November 27, 1996, defendant \nMILTON  BONILLA did not then place OLIVER JOVANOVIC under arrest, despite RZUCEKโs\nclaims of being brutally tortured, raped and sodomized.\n45.  Defendant MILTON BONILLA waited 9 days prior to arresting plaintiff OLIVER\nJOVANOVIC. \n-6-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 7 of 32\n46. During this 9-day period, from the time of the initial complaint to the time of the \narrest, defendant MILTON BONILLA conducted no further investigation into this matter.  \n47. Notwithstanding the lack of any medical or forensic evidence, on December 5, 1996,\ndefendant MILTON BONILLA arrested plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC and charged him with \ncommitting multiple offenses, including Rape, Sodomy, and Unlawful Imprisonment.\n48. Defendant MILTON BONILLA arrestedp laintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC only after\nbeing pressured to do so by third parties.\nThe Search of Plaintiffโs Apartment \n49. On December 5, 1996, after plaintiff was arrested, defendant MILTON BONILLA\nand several other police officers conducted a search of his premises, located at 680 Ft. Washington\nAvenue, Apartment 2F, in the City, County and State of New York.   \n50. Police were looking to find the items which had allegedly been used by plaintiff in\nthe attack against RZUCEK. \n51. Specifically, police were looking to find, inter alia, a police baton, candles, candle\nwax, a blindfold, cloth strips, duct tape, packing tape, and ace bandages.\n52. No such items were ever recovered from plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC or his \napartment. \n53. During this search, multiple photographs were taken of the interior of plaintiffโs \napartment. \n54. The photographs revealed that none of thei tems described in Paragraph โ51\", supra,\nwere inside of plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVICโs apartment. \n55. These photographs, taken by two separate investigative teams, were subsequently \nโlostโ by defendant MILTON BONILLA and/or the New York City Police Department. \n-7-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 8 of 32\nBonillaโs Post-Search Activities\n56. After the search was executed, defendant MILTON BONILLA prepared certain   \npolice reports and forwarded them to prosecutors in the New York County District Attorneyโs \nOffice. \n57. These reports contained false and misleading information regarding the arrest of \nplaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC, as well as the evidence allegedly collected from his apartment. \n58. In addition to these  reports, defendant MILTON BONILLA told prosecutors from\nthe New York County District Attorneyโs office  that he had obsevred certain incriminating evidence\ninside of  plaintiffโs apartment, when he knew this claim to be untrue. \n59. Defendant MILTON BONILLA also told prosecutors  from the New York County\nDistrict Attorneyโs office that plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC had conspired to obstruct the police\nat the time of the search, and had destroyed certain incriminating evidence  prior to the search, when\nhe knew these claims to be untrue.  \n60. Thereafter, defendant MILTON BONILLA repeated the above false and misleading\nclaims before the grand jury, the trial judge and the petit jury. \nThe Arraignment \n61.   On December 6, 1996, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was arraigned  before \nthe Honorable Michael Gross, in the Criminal Court of the City of New York, County of \nNew York, at 100 Centre Street.   \n62. Defendant LINDA FAIRSTEIN (โFAIRSTEINโ), the Chief of the Sex Crimes \nUnit of the New York County District AttorneyโsO  ffice, personally appeared at the arraignment of\nplaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC as the sole representative of that office. \n-8-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 9 of 32\nDefendant Fairsteinโs Post-Arraignment Statements to the Press\n63. In the days following plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVICโs arraignment, defendant \nFAIRSTEIN spoke to numerous news reporters and was quoted extensively in local newspaper\narticles.  \n64. In these articles, defendant FAIRSTEIN made a number of  highly inflammatory and\nprejudicial remarks about plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC, none of which was true.  \n65.  The following statements in the articles were attributed directly to defendant \nFAIRSTEIN and illustrate the type of extrajudicial remarks that defendant FAIRSTEIN made to the\npress in the days following plaintiffโs arraignment:  \nโข โHe terrorized this young woman to the point that she was too frightened to\ncall the authorities until weeks after it happenedโ;  \nโข โHe tied her to a chair, undressed her, and tortured her with sex toys and\nother objects for almost a full dayโ;\nโข โ[H]e tortured and sexually abused the woman, burning her with candle wax,\nbiting her, sexually assaulting her and threatening to disme mber her as\nJeffrey  Dahmer, the serial killer, had done with his victimsโ;\nโข He โtied the womanโs legs to a chair and gagged her before sexually torturing\nherโ;\nโข โ[H]e was so prepared for this and carried it off so smoothlyโ;\nโข โWe believe this was not the first time he did something like thisโ; and \nโข โWe believe there are other victims.โ\n66. Defendant FAIRSTEINโs comments made the headlines of all local newspapers.  \nOne New York Post cover page, for example, screamed โProsecutor: Cyber fiend struck beforeโ and\nโHOW MANY MORE VICTIMS? โ, while featuring a full page picture of plaintiff OLIVER\nJOVANOVIC.\n-9-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 10 of 32\n67. In addition to the foregoing, defendant FAIRSTEIN repeatedly emphasized  to the\npress that this was her officeโs โfirst Internet-related sex prosecutionโ and that the case represented\na โwhole new entry in the acquaintance-rape category.โ\nThe Pre-Trial Publicity \n68. Defendant FAIRSTEIN, through her extrajudicial statements to the press,  created\na highly prejudicial and inflamed atmosphere against plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC. \n69. In local newspapers, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC  became known as the \nโCybersex Fiendโ and โCybersex Suspectโ, and his case became known as the โCyber Tortureโ case.\n70. In the first two weeks after plaintiffโs arrest, there were 76 articles in local \nnewspapers which repeated defendant FAIRSTEINโS false statements.  Plaintiffโs case became a\ncover page story.  \n71. In these articles, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was repeatedly portrayed as \na serial killer and โCyberfiendโ, and was often compared with Jeffrey Dahmer. \n72. The โCybersexโ story was picked up by the Associated Press, which extensively \nquoted defendant FAIRSTEIN and her false allegations against plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC.\n73. Major television networks and radio stations soon joined the coverage, and the \nstory began to receive national and international attention.\n74.  Throughout the pre-trial proceedings, defendant FAIRSTEIN continued to provide\nhighly damaging โleaksโ to the press, including but not limited to, releasing  select  portions of the\ne-mail correspondence between plaintiff OL IVER JOVANOVIC and RZUCEK whic h further\ndemonized plaintiff.  \n-10-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 11 of 32\n75. Defendant FAIRSTEIN knew that the pre-trial publicity that she had generated \nwould have an impact on prospective jurors int he criminal trial of plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC.\n76. In an interview given to the Media Studie sJournal in the winter of 1998, just months\nprior to plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVICโs trial,d efendant FAIRSTEIN acknowledged the damaging\nimpact that pre-trial publicity can have on prospective jurors:\nThe period of greatest impact is pretrial because that could be anywhere from three\nmonths to a year.  Depending on t he coverage, people can becom e immersed in\nreading about the case.  And from this reading-and-listening public come the people\nwho sit on our juries.  After the trial has begun, the jurors are given a rule โ  that they\ndonโt read or listen to media accounts of the case.  Most people try hard to comply.\nBut itโs almost impossible with the highest-profile cases for it to really happen. \nWhen a case like Chambers, the jogger, the subway bomber or the World Trade \nCenter bomber is on trial in New York โ  and it is literally a page A1 headline โ our\njurors are coming to work on the subway and the bus .... I  mean you canโt sit on a\ntrain and not see whatโs there. ... And you deal with a jury pool that is just saturated\nwith that kind of information.  You hope that you get jurors  who are telling you the\ntruth, that they can set aside what theyโve heard and just listen to the evidence in the\ncourtroom. In the end, both sides use the press to great advantage before you get\nanywhere near the trial stage. \n(emphasis supplied)\n77. Defendant FAIRSTEIN acknowledged in the same interview that โitโs inappropriate\nfor prosecutors to be spinning the case to the mediaโ, and as a result,  โwe donโt try our cases on the\ncourtroom  steps or to the press. We try them in the courtroom.โ \n78. Notwithstanding the above-stated policy, defendant FAIRSTEIN continued to make\nextrajudicial statements to the press and/or provide damaging โleaksโ to the media throughout all\nphases of the criminal proceedings against plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC. \n-11-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 12 of 32\n79. As a  result of defendant FAIRSTEINโs conduct, the prejudicial news coverage \ncontinued up to and including the trial, and  influecned the ability of the jury pool and the jurors who\nsat on the case to be fair and im partial, and also influenced the testimony of witnesses, jury\ndeliberations, and, ultimately, the outcome of the case. \nThe Verdict, The Appeal and The Subsequent Dismissal\n80. On April 15, 1998, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was convicted of Kidnaping in\nthe First Degree, three counts of Sexual Abuse in the First Degree, Assault in the Second Degree\nand Assault in the Third Degree. \n81. Thereafter, the Honorable William A. Wetzel sentenced plaintiff OLIVER \nJOVANOVIC to 15 years to life in prison.   \n82. On December 21, 1999,  the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme \nCourt reversed plaintiffโs conviction, finding inter alia, that Justice William A. Wetzel had \nโimproperly hampered the defendantโs ability to present a defenseโ by erroneously invoking the\nrape-shield law to deny the jury access to key evidence in the case.  \n83. In anticipation of a second trial, the porsecution repeatedly offered plaintiff OLIVER\nJOVANOVIC plea deals in which he would avoid any further time in prison if he would plead guilty\nto a single felony charge.  \n84. When plaintiff refused to consider any of t hese offers, the prosecution offered a plea\ndeal in which plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC would avoid any further incarceration, any felony\nrecord and any sex offender status if he would plead guilty to a single non-sexual, misdemeanor\ncharge.  \n-12-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 13 of 32\n85. Plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC refused to accept this offer โ despite facing a \nmandatory 15-year-to-life sentence on the felony Kidnapping charge โ and insisted upon going\nforward with the second trial. \n86. On the eve of re-trial on  November 1, 2001, the prosecution  moved to dismiss all\ncharges against plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC.   The motion was granted. \n87. On November 1, 2001, all charges against plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC were \ndismissed with prejudice. \nPlaintiffโs Damages\n88. As a result of his unlawful arrest and prosecution, plaintiff OLIVER \nJOVANOVIC was incarcerated for one week at Rikers Island prior to trial, and 20 months in Rikers\nIsland and state prisons following his conviction. \n89. During this time, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was repeatedly threatened and \nattacked by other inmates. \n90. On one occasion while in prison, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was stabbed in the\nneck and had his throat slashed by another inmate, and came within inches of losing his life. \n91. Apart from the violence and hardships of prison life, plaintiff OLIVER  \nJOVANOVIC suffered severe damage to his career and reputation.  \n92.  At the time of his arrest on December 5, 1996, plaintiff had completed his research\nat Columbia University for a Ph.D. degree inM  icrobiology, had written his doctoral thesis, and was\nscheduled to defend his thesis to the faculty on December 20, 1996. \n93. As a direct result of his unlawful arrest and prosecution, plaintiff OLIVER \nJOVANOVIC was prevented for over five years from defending his thesis and obtaining his Ph.D.\n-13-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 14 of 32\nin Microbiology.\n94. It was not until May 7, 2002, that plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was able to \ndefend his doctorate and earn a Ph.D. with dis tinction from Columbia University, as well as\ndepartmental honors for outstanding and innovative work. \n95. Notwithstanding this accomplishment, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC suffered\nsubstantial economic losses as a result of his unlawful arrest and prosecution,  including but not \nlimited to, six years of lost wages as a specialist in computational biology. \n96. In addition, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was forced to incur substantial \nattorneysโ fees in connection with his defense, including but not limited to, legal fees for handling\nthe trial, the appeal, and preparation for the second trial. \n97.

Defendant GAIL HEATHERLY, in her investigative capacity, met with and \ninterviewed several potential witnesses during her pre-trial investigation. \n143. Defendant GAIL HEATHERLY, in her investigative capacity, learned that these \nwitnesses possessed material and exculpatory information which would be helpful to the defense.\n144. Defendant GAIL HEATHERLY, in her investigative capacity, specifically \ninstructed these witnesses not to speak to with members of the defense team.  \n145. Defendant GAIL HEATHERLY, in her investigative capacity, threatened to  \ndisclose embarrassing personal details about these witnesses if they agreed to cooperate with the\ndefense team.\n146. As an example of the conduct alleged in paragraphs โ141\" through โ144\", defendant\nGAIL HEATHERLY met a witness named Kenneth Krompinger  during the early phases of  her\ninvestigation into this matter.\n  147.

After speaking with Mr. Krompinger, defendant GAIL HEATHERLY threatened to\nexpose Mr. Krompingerโs medical and psychiatric history if he agreed to cooperate with the defense.\n152. After meeting with defendant GAIL HEATHERLY, Mr. Krom pinger refused to\nspeak with members of the defense team.   Accordingly, neither the defense nor the jury learned of\nMr. Krompingerโs exculpatory evidence.\n153.   As a  result of defendant GAIL HEATHERLYโs unlawful actions, plaintiff  \nOLIVER JOVANOVIC was denied an opportunity to persent material and exculpatory information\nat his criminal trial.\n154.

Extrajudicial Statements By the Prosecution in High-Profile Criminal Cases\n158.    At all times herein mentioned, defendant CITY OF NEW YORK, through the  \nNew York County District Attorneyโs office  and  the Sex Crimes Unit, had a custom, practice and\npolicy of allowing assistant district attorneys to make extrajudicial statements to the press in high-\nprofile criminal cases, so as to inflame public opinion against such defendants and deprive them of\ntheir constitutional right to a fair trial. \n159. The aforesaid policy, custom and practice can be inferred in part from repeated \ninstances in which the New York County DistricAt ttorneyโs office,  through defendant FAIRSTEIN\nand/or assistant district attorneys in the Sex Crimes Unit acting under her supervision, engaged in\nthe following tactics in high-profile criminal cases: \n(a) Providing systematic โleaksโof information to the press which were \ndamaging to the accused; \n(b) Releasing to the press negative information about the accused, including his\nprior arrest history and criminal record; \n(c) Publicly discussing the m erits of the case and/or incrim inating evidence\nwhich  had been gathered against the accused; \n           (d) Expressing opinions about the accusedโs guilt or innocence prior to the      \ncommencement of trial;  \n(e) Maligning the character and reputation of the accused; \n(f) Stating that the accused had enga ged in similar conduct before without\nevidence to  support such statements; and\n(g) Commenting on the identity, testimony and/or credibility of prospective\nwitnesses who would testify against the accused. \n-22-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 23 of 32\n160.    The existence of the aforesaid customs, policies and practices of defendant \nCITY OF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York County District Attorneyโs office and the\nSex Crimes Unit, is evident in the following high-profile criminal cases, among others: \n(a) The โCybersex Tortureโ Case; \n(b) The โCentral Park Joggerโ Case; \n   (c) The โPreppie Murderโ Case against Robert Chambers;\n(d) The Sexual Abuse case against Dr. Patrick Griffin; and \n(e) The Internet Sexual Assault case against Paul Krauth.\n161. In all of the above cases, prosecutors form the New York County District Attorneyโs\noffice made extrajudicial statements to the press which involved one or more of the improper tactics\nenumerated in Paragraph โ158\", supra, and which resulted in extensive negative publicity against\nthe accused.\n162.   The aforesaid policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or customs \nwere implemented by policymaking officials for the defendant City of New York, including but not\nlimited to, the District Attorney of New York  County Robert Morge nthau and/or defendant\nFAIRSTEIN, who knew that:\n(a) to a moral certainty such policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or\ncustoms concern issues that regularly arise in the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases;\n(b) that such issues either present assistant district attorneys with difficult \nchoices of the sort that instruction, training and/o rsupervision would make less difficult, or that the\nneed for further instruction, training and/or supervision was demonstrated by a history of assistant\ndistrict attorneysโ mishandling such situations; and\n-23-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 24 of 32\n(c) despite their knowledge of said policies, procedures, regulations, practices\nand/or customs, the supervisory and policymaking officers and officials of the defendant CITY OF\nNEW YORK, as a m atter of policy, practice and custom, perpetuated or failed to take steps to\nterminate said policies, practices and/or customs, did not discipline or otherwise properly supervise\nthe employees engaged in them, did not effectively instruct, train and/or supervise such personnel\nwith regard to the proper constitutional and statutoyr requirements in the exercise of their authority,\nbut instead sanctioned the policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or custom s described\nabove, and in fact rewarded such assistant distrcit attorneys by giving them promotions and bonuses,\nthereby evincing a deliberate indifference to the effect of said policies, proce dures, regulations,\npractices and/or customs upon the constitutional rights of residents and citizens of the State of New\nYork.\n163. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the \nthe CITY OF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York County District Attorneyโs office and\nthe Sex Crimes Unit, constituted a deliberate indifference to the safety, well-being and constitutional\nrights of all defendants in high-profile criminal cases, including but not limited to, plaintiff OLIVER\nJOVANOVIC.\n164. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the \nCITY OF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York County District Attorneyโs office and the\nSex Crimes Unit City of New York, were the  proximate cause of the constitutional violations\nsuffered by OLIVER JOVANOVIC as alleged herein. \n165. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the CITY\nOF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York County Di strict Attorneyโs office and Sex\nCrimes Unit City of New York, were the moving force behind the constitutional violations suffered\n-24-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 25 of 32\nby plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC as alleged herein.\n166. As a proximate result of the foregoing practices and policies of the CITY OF NEW\nYORK, as implemented by the New York County District Attorneyโs office and the Sex Crimes\nUnit, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC was denied his constitutional due process right to a fair trial\nand was incarcerated unlawfully for more than 20 months until all charges were dismissed against\nhim on November 1, 2001.\nII. โOff-the Recordโ Statements by NYPD Offciials in High-Profile Criminal Cases\n167.    At all times herein mentioned, defendant CITY OF NEW YORK, through the  \nNew York City Police Department, had a custom, practice and policy of allowing its police officers,\ndetectives and/or investigators to make โoff-the-recordโ statements to the press in high-profile\ncriminal cases, thereby disclosing highly sensitive and/or damaging information from an ongoing\ncriminal investigation, so as to inflame public opinion against defendants in such cases and deprive\nthem of their constitutional right to a fair trial. \n168. The aforesaid policy, custom and practice can be inferred in part from repeated \ninstances in which the New York York City Po lice Department,  through its police officers,\ndetectives and/or investigators, engaged in the following tactics in high-profile criminal cases: \n(a) Providing  systematic  โleaksโof inform ation  to the press whi ch  were\ndamaging to the accused; \n(b) Releasing to the press negative information about the accused, including his\nprior arrest history and criminal record; \n(c) Releasing to the press incrimi nating evidence which  had been gathered\nagainst the accused; \n           (d) Expressing opinions about the accusedโs guilt or innocence prior to the      \ncommencement of trial;  \n(e)        Maligning the character and reputation of the accused; \n-25-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 26 of 32\n(f) Stating that the accused had engaged in sim ilar conduct before without\nevidence to  support such statements; and\n(g) Commenting on the ident ity, testimony and/or credibility of prospective\nwitnesses who would testify against the accused. \n169.    The existence of the aforesaid customs, policies and practices of defendant \nCITY OF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York City Police Department, is evident in the\nfollowing high-profile criminal cases, among others: \n(a) The โCybersex Tortureโ Case; \n(b) The โCentral Park Joggerโ Case; \n   (c) The โPreppie Murderโ Case against Robert Chambers;\n(d) The Sexual Abuse case against Dr. Patrick Griffin; and \n(e) The Internet Sexual Assault case against Paul Krauth.\n170. In all of the above cases, law enforcement officials from the New York City Police\nDepartment, including but not limited, police officers, detectives, and/or investigators, made โoff-\nthe-recordโ statements to the press which involved one or more of the improper tactics enumerated\nin Paragraph โ167\", supra, and which resulted in extensive negative publicity against the accused\nwhich tainted the jury pool and deprived the accused of the constitutional right to a fair trial. \n  171.   The aforesaid policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or customs \nwere implemented by policymaking officials for the defendant City of New York, including but not\nlimited to, the police commissioner(s) and/or other high-ranking officials of the New York City\nPolice Department, who knew that:\n(a) to a moral certainty such policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or\ncustoms concern issues that regularly arise in the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases;\n-26-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 27 of 32\n(b)   that such issues either present police officers, detectives and/or  investigators\nwith difficult choices of the sort that instruc tion, training and/or supervision woul d make less\ndifficult, or that the need for further instruction, training and/or supervision was demonstrated by\na history of such employeesโ  mishandling such situations; and\n(c) despite their knowledge of said policies, procedures, regulations, practices\nand/or customs, the supervisory and policymaking officers and officials of the defendant CITY OF\nNEW YORK, as a m atter of policy, practice and cus tom, perpetuated or failed to take steps to\nterminate said policies, practices and/or customs, did not discipline or otherwise properly supervise\nthe employees engaged in them, did not effectively instruct, train and/or supervise such personnel\nwith regard to the proper constitutional and statutoyr requirements in the exercise of their authority,\nbut instead sanctioned the policies, procedures,  regulations, practices and/or customs described\nabove, and in fact rewarded such em ployees by giving them promotions and bonuses, thereby\nevincing a deliberate indifference to the effect of said policies, procedures, regulations, practices\nand/or customs upon the constitutional rights of residents and citizens of the State of New York.\n172. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the \nthe CITY OF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York City Police Department, constituted\na deliberate indifference to the safety, well-being and constitutional rights of all defendants in high-\nprofile criminal cases, including but not limited to, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC.\n173. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the \nCITY OF NEW YORK, as i mplemented by the New York City Police Departm ent, were the\nproximate cause of the consti tutional violations suffered by OLIVER JOVANOVIC as alleged\nherein. \n-27-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 28 of 32\n174. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the CITY\nOF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New YorkC  ity Police Department, were the moving force\nbehind the constitutional violations suffered by plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC as alleged herein.\n175.     As a proximate result of the foregoing practices and policies of the CITY OF NEW\nYORK, as implemented by the New York CityP olice Department, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC\nwas denied his constitutional due process right to a fair trial and was incarcerated unlawfully for\nmore than 20 months until all charges were dismissed against him on November 1, 2001.\nIII.   Deliberate Indifference to the Training and Supervision of Assistant District\nAttorneys\n176. Apart from the foregoing practices and policies, defendant CITY OF NEW YORK\nexhibited a deliberate indifference toward the trainnig and supervision of assistant district attorneys\nin the New York County District Attorneyโs Office, in that defendant CITY OF NEW YORK:  \na) Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to  properly instruct, train and/or supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard to their obligations to discontinue a criminal\nprosecution when medical and/or forensic evidence is discovered which negates\nprobable cause and exonerates the accused; \nb) Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to properly instruct, train and/or supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard to their obligations to discontinue a criminal\nprosecution when it becomes apparent that the complaining witness is not credible;\nc)  Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to properly instruct, train and/or supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard to  their obligations to tim ely disclose all\nevidence  favorable  to the defense on the issues of guilt or innocence and\npunishment,  pursuant to the due process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution, and to Brady v. Maryland 3,73 U.S.\n83 (1963), and its progeny;\nd  ) Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to properly instruct, train and/or supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard to their obligations to avoid threatening,\nintimidating, hiring and/or coercing potential defense witnesses and preventing them\nfrom testifying on behalf of the accused;\n-28-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 29 of 32\ne)  Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to properly instruct, train and/or  supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard to their obligations to avoid interfering with\na defendantโs constitutional right to a f air trial by instruct ing potential defense\nwitnesses to not speak with defense counsel or investigators for the defense team;\nf) Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to pr operly instruct, train and/or supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard  to their obligations to avoid pressuring\npotential  defense witnes ses  to  give untruthful, erroneous, incom plete  and/or\nmisleading statements; \ng) Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to prope rly instruct, train and/or supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard to their obligations to avoid adopting a โwin-\nat-all-costsโ approach to trial  which involves, inter alia, the following misconduct:\ncoaching and/or permitting witnesses to give inaccurate, false and/or m isleading\ntestimony; tailoring witness testimony to explain inconsistencies with physical\nevidence; altering medical and forensic expert reports to exclude information which\nis favorable to the defense; and withholdnig material facts from medical and forensic\nexperts to secure more favorable testimony from said experts; and  \n \nh)  Intentionally and/or recklessly failed to properly instruct, train a nd/or supervise\nassistant district attorneys with regard to their obligations to avoid giving improper\nsummations which, inter alia: mistate  evidence; discuss evidence which is not part\nof the record; mischaracterize witness testimony;  personally attack the accused\nand/or defense counsel; invite speculation by the jury; inflame the passions of the\njury against the accused; and otherwise exceed the bounds of proper advocacy. \n177. The aforesaid deliberate indifference to the training and supervision of assistant \ndistrict attorneys of the New York County District Attorneyโs Office may also be inferred in part\nfrom an examination of the following criminal cases handled by said office, among others: \n(a)  The โCybersex Tortureโ Case; \n(b)   The โCentral Park Joggerโ Case; \n(c) The โPreppie Murderโ Case against Robert Chambers; and\n(d)  The Sexual Abuse case against Dr. Patrick Griffin. \n178. In all of the above cases, prosecutors form the New York County District Attorneyโs\noffice engaged in one or more of the improper tactics enumerated in Paragraph โ175\", supra, and\nthereby deprived the accused of the constitutional right to a fair trial.\n-29-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 30 of 32\n179.  The aforesaid deliberate indifference to the training and supervision of assistant \ndistrict attorneys by defendant CITY OF NEW YORK  may also be inferred from an analysis of\nconvictions obtained by the New York County Distric tAttorneyโs office which have been reversed,\nmodified, or vacated based, inter alia, upon prosecutorial actions of the sort described in paragraph\n175, supra.\n180. The aforesaid deliberate indifference to the training and supervision of assistant \ndistrict attorneys was implemented as a policy, practice, and/or custom of defendant CITY OF NEW\nYORK by policymaking officials for defendant CITY OF NEW YORK including, but not limited\nto, the District Attorney of New York County Robert Morganthau and/or defendant FAIRSTEIN,\nwho knew that:\n(a) to a moral certainty that such policies, procedures, regulations, practices and/or\ncustoms concern issues that regularly arise in the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases;\n(b) that such issues either present assistant district attorneys  with difficult choices\nof the sort that instruction, training and/or supervision will make less difficult, or that the need for\nfurther instruction, training and/or supervision was demonstrated by a history of assistant district\nattorneysโ mishandling such situations; and\nc) despite their knowledge of said policies, procedures, regulations, practices \nand/or customs, the supervisory and policymaking officers and officials of the defendant CITY OF\nNEW YORK, as a m atter of policy, practice and custom, perpetuated or failed to take steps to\nterminate said policies, practices and/or customs, did not discipline or otherwise properly supervise\nthe employees engaged in them, did not effectively instruct, train and/or supervise such personnel\nwith regard to the proper constitutional and statutoyr requirements in the exercise of their authority,\nbut instead sanctioned the policies, procedures, regulations, practices a nd/or customs described\nabove, and in fact rewarded such assistant distrcit attorneys by giving them promotions and bonuses,\n-30-\n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 1    Filed 10/28/04   Page 31 of 32\nthereby evincing a deliberate indifference to the e ffect of said policies, procedures, regulations,\npractices and/or customs upon the constitutional rights of residents and citizens of the State of New\nYork.\n181. The foregoing customs, policies, usages, practices, procedures and rules of the \nthe CITY OF NEW YORK, as implemented by the New York County District Attorneyโs office and\nthe Sex Crimes Unit, constituted a deliberate indifference to the safety, well-being and constitutional\nrights of all defendants, including but not limited to, plaintiff OLIVER JOVANOVIC.\n182.

ENDORSEMENT: The\napplication to divide the time of the non party deponents is denied. Plaintiff may\ndepose the witnesses for the full 7 hours the Rules allow. It is clear that the\ndefendants counsel has access to witnesses which plaintiff does not have. Plaintiff\ncan gain access only by way of subpoena, and it would be unfair to truncate the\ntime allowed for by the rules. The parties should work in good faith to resolve their\ndisputes and, if possible, share the deposition time, but so it is clear plaintiff is\nentitled to the full time allowed for the non party witness it has subpoenaed. As to\nthe identification of the complaining witness the parties should not publicize the\nname and the Court will address this matter at the next pretrial conference. SO\nORDERED.

We advised\nplaintiffs counsel yesterday that we do not object to an extension of discovery to\nallow depositions now scheduled to proceed, but that we do object to an\nunrestricted discovery extension. We also advised counsel that we object to\nadjourning plaintiffs deposition given the late stage of discovery, and given the\nnumber of depositions that already have been pushed into July (subject to Court\napproval). Accordingly, we submit that plaintiffs request should be denied, and that\ninstead, the Court should enter a discovery order as set forth below. Because\nplaintiffs deposition is now scheduled for this Friday, June 26, we respectfully\nrequest that Your Honor decide the instant application as soon as reasonably\npracticable.

Cardozo,\n14 Corporation Counsel of the City\n15 of New York, New York, NY.\n16\n17 Appeal from a judgment of the United States District\n18 Court for the Southern District of New York (Crotty, J.).\n19\n20 UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED\n21 AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be\n22 AFFIRMED. \n23\n24 Plaintiff Oliver Jovanovic appeals from a judgment\n25 entered by the United States District Court for the Southern\n26 District of New York (Crotty, J.), dismissing on summary\n27 judgment his civil rights claims against a police officer, a\n28 prosecutor, and the City of New York.  We assume the\n29 partiesโ familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and\n30 issues presented on appeal. \n31\n32 In the fall of 1996, Jovanovic, a PhD candidate at\n33 Columbia University, spent the night with a 20-year-old\n34 Barnard College student, Jamie Rzucek, who later accused him\n35 of tying her up, pouring hot candle wax on parts of her\n36 body, and sodomizing her with a baton-like object. \n37 Defendant Milton Bonilla, a New York City police detective\n38 assigned to the Manhattan Special Victims Unit, led the\n39 police investigation; defendant Linda Fairstein was the\n40 assistant district attorney in charge of prosecuting the\n41 case.  \n42\n43 A grand jury indicted Jovanovic on December 13, 1996\n44 and added charges on December 19, 1996.  Only Rzucek and\n45 Bonilla testified before the grand jury.  Subsequently\n2\n\nCCasaes:e 1 10:-0443-9c8v-  0  8 D43o7c-uPmAeCn t :  D1o1c1u  m   ePnatg 1e2: 83        F  i0le8d/2 088/2/2081/21 2        P7a0g4e4 230 o  f   5  5\n1 Jovanovic was convicted of kidnapping, sexual abuse, and\n2 assault, and sentenced to fifteen years to life in prison.  \n3\n4 On December 21, 1999--after Jovanovic had spent nearly\n5 twenty months in prison--the Appellate Division, First\n6 Department, of the New York Supreme Court vacated the\n7 conviction because the trial court had excluded evidence\n8 that disabled Jovanovic from proving that he โhad reason to\n9 believe, prior to their meeting, that they both had intended\n10 to participate in consensual, non-violent sadomasochism that\n11 night.โ  People v. Jovanovic, 700 N.Y.S.2d 156, 164 (1st\n12 Depโt 1999).  The excluded evidence included emails and\n13 chats suggesting that Ruczek was seeking such an encounter.\n14 Id.\n15\n16 After the state declined to retry Jovanovic, he filed\n17 this civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983,\n18 alleging that his prosecution violated his civil rights.  He\n19 appeals the district courtโs grant of summary judgment in\n20 favor of defendants on claims that: (1) Bonilla maliciously\n21 prosecuted him; (2) Bonilla deprived him of his right to a\n22 fair trial through the use of fabricated evidence and a\n23 deeply flawed investigation; (3) Fairstein deprived him of a\n24 fair trial by making inflammatory public statements that\n25 both prejudiced the grand jury and caused witnesses to come\n26 forward and give false testimony; and (4) the City failed to\n27 properly train police regarding false rape claims. \n28\n29 Malicious Prosecution (Bonilla).  An element of any\n30 malicious prosecution claim is the absence of probable\n31 cause.  See Savino v. City of New York, 331 F.3d 63, 72 (2d\n32 Cir. 2003). The detailed account given by Rzucek--without\n33 any obvious reason for skepticism--provided sufficient\n34 probable cause.  See Curley v. Vill. of Suffern, 268 F.3d\n35 65, 70 (2d Cir. 2001) (โWhen information is received from a\n36 putative victim or an eyewitness, probable cause exists\n37 unless the circumstances raise doubt as to the personโs\n38 veracity.โ (citation omitted)).  The circumstances of this\n39 case did not require further investigation to support\n40 probable cause.  See Panetta v. Crowley, 460 F.3d 388,396\n41 (2d Cir. 2006); Ricciuti v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 124 F.3d\n42 123, 128 (2d Cir. 1997).\n43\n44 Fair Trial (Bonilla).  Jovanovic claims that he was\n45 deprived of a fair trial by Bonillaโs alleged lie that\n46 corroborative evidence had been removed from Jovanovicโs\n47 apartment between the time of his arrest and the time\n3\n\nCCasaes:e 1 10:-0443-9c8v-  0  8 D43o7c-uPmAeCn t :  D1o1c1u  m   ePnatg 1e2: 84        F  i0le8d/2 088/2/2081/21 2        P7a0g4e4 240 o  f   5  5\n1 Bonilla executed a search warrant.1  He raises the issue in\n2 only a perfunctory manner on appeal; but even if it were\n3 properly raised it would be unavailing.  A person suffers a\n4 constitutional violation if an (1) investigating official\n5 (2) fabricates evidence (3) that is likely to influence a\n6 juryโs decision, (4) forwards that information to\n7 prosecutors, and (5) the plaintiff suffers a deprivation of\n8 liberty as a result.  See Jocks v. Tavernier, 316 F.3d 128,\n9 138 (2d Cir. 2003); Ricciuti, 124 F.3d at 130.  Probable\n10 cause is not a defense.  See Ricciuti, 124 F.3d at 129-130. \n11 Jovanovic cannot show causation--i.e., that the alleged\n12 fabrication of evidence led to a deprivation of his liberty. \n13 That is because the only avenue by which the testimony could\n14 reach the jury was through Bonillaโs testimony, for which he\n15 enjoys absolute immunity under Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U.S.\n16 325, 335-336 (1983); see also Rehberg v. Paulk, 132 S. Ct.\n17 1497, 1505 (2012) (extending Briscoe to grand jury\n18 proceedings).  The cases relied upon by Jovanovic are not to\n19 the contrary. Ricciuti addressed only whether qualified\n20 immunity was available to police offers who willfully\n21 fabricated evidence.  Ricciuti, 124 F.3d at 130. \n22 Furthermore, the allegedly fabricated admissions in Ricciuti\n23 caused the plaintiffs to be charged with a more serious\n24 crime and delayed their opportunity to be freed on bail. \n25 See id. at 126.  In Jocks, the statement at issue was a\n26 written admission that was forwarded to prosecutors.  Jocks,\n27 316 F.3d at 138.\n28\n29 Fair Trial (Fairstein).  Jovanovic contends that\n30 Fairstein deprived him of his right to a fair trial by\n31 making inflammatory public statements.  In order to succeed\n32 on such a claim, a plaintiff must prove (1) the prosecutor\n33 made improper public statements or leaks (i.e., those that\n34 contravene the canons of ethics or other standards for\n35 prosecutorial conduct); (2) the improper disclosure in fact\n36 deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (3) other\n1 In a pair of footnotes, Jovanovic also argues that\nBonilla deprived him of a fair trial by creating a\nmisleading video tape in which he opened up Jovanovicโs\nfuton with a โflick of the wrist.โ  Assuming that Jovanovic\nproperly raised the argument, and assuming that Bonillaโs\nproduction of the video could be considered misleading, it\nwas not material to the juryโs decision and therefore could\nnot have caused a deprivation of liberty.\n4\n\nCCasaes:e 1 10:-0443-9c8v-  0  8 D43o7c-uPmAeCn t :  D1o1c1u  m   ePnatg 1e2: 85        F  i0le8d/2 088/2/2081/21 2        P7a0g4e4 250 o  f   5  5\n1 remedies like the use of voir dire and peremptory challenges\n2 were either unavailable or ineffective to remedy the leaked\n3 information.  See Powers v. Coe, 728 F.2d 97, 105-06 (2d\n4 Cir. 1984).  \n5\n6 As to the impact on the grand jury, summary judgment\n7 was appropriate.  A less searching scrutiny of procedural\n8 protections is warranted for grand jury proceedings than for\n9 a criminal trial.  See United States v. York, 428 F.3d 1325,\n10 1331 (11th Cir. 2005); cf. United States v. Calandra, 414\n11 U.S. 338, 349 (1974) (rejecting use of exclusionary rule in\n12 grand jury proceedings and noting that โthe grand jury does\n13 not finally adjudicate guilt or innocence, it has\n14 traditionally been allowed to pursue its investigative and\n15 accusatorial functions unimpeded by the evidentiary and\n16 procedural restrictions applicable to a criminal trialโ). \n17 Jovanovic has not sustained his burden of addressing\n18 evidence of prejudice.  And it matters that the prosecutor\n19 instructed the grand jury to disregard all media coverage\n20 and that the law required it to base its conclusion solely\n21 on the evidence presented. \n22\n23 Summary judgment was also appropriate on Jovanovicโs\n24 claim that the pretrial publicity caused a witness to come\n25 forward and perjure herself at trial.  Jovonavic must be\n26 able to prove that the injury complained of โwas not too\n27 remote a consequence of the improper leaks to the press.โ \n28 Powers, 728 F.2d at 105 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n29 The witnessโs perjury--accepting Jovanovicโs allegations--\n30 was too remote of a consequence of Fairsteinโs statements.  \n31\n32 Finally, because we found that Bonillaโs investigation\n33 was not so deficient as to render him potentially liable for\n34 malicious prosecution, Jovanovicโs municipal liability claim\n35 necessarily fails.  See Wray v. City of New York, 490 F.3d\n36 189, 196 (2d Cir. 2007); see also City of Los Angeles v.\n37 Heller, 475 U.S. 796, 799 (1986). \n38\n39 Finding no merit in Jovanovicโs remaining arguments, we\n40 hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n41\n42 FOR THE COURT:\n43 CATHERINE OโHAGAN WOLFE, CLERK\n44\n5",

CROTTY, United States District Judge: \n \n \nIn November, 1996, the Plaintiff, Dr. Oliver Jovanovic (โJovanovicโ or โPlaintiffโ), then \na doctoral student at Columbia University, was arrested and subsequently tried and convicted for \nthe rape, sodomy and kidnapping of Jamie Rzucek (โRzucekโ), then a student at Barnard \nCollege.  Local newspapers and other media outlets provided intense coverage of the high-profile \ntrial.  In April, 1998, Jovanovic was convicted, and in May, 1998, he was sentenced to a term of \n15 years to life in prison.  Upon appeal, the Appellate Division, First Department found trial \nerrors relating to the trial judgeโs application of the rape-shield law, leading to a reversal of his \nconviction in December, 1999 and a remand for a new trial.  The victim refused to testify at a \nnew trial, and subsequently the District Attorney moved to dismiss all charges.  On November 1, \n2001, the District Attorneyโs motion was granted, and all charges were dismissed with prejudice.   \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 2 of 30\nJovanovic initiated this action on October 28, 2004, alleging a number of claims against \nNew York Police Department Detective Milton Bonilla, Assistant District Attorney Linda \nFairstein, and the City of New York (collectively, the โDefendantsโ).  Prior rulings by this court \nhave left Jovanovic with claims against Bonilla for malicious prosecution, malicious abuse of \nprocess, and denial of a fair trial; a claim against Fairstein for denial of a fair trial; and claims \nunder Monell v. Depโt of Soc. Servs. of New York, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), against the City of New \nYork.  See Jovanovic v. City of New York, 04 Civ. 8437, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59165 \n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2006); Jovanovic v. City of New York, 04 CV 8437, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n8974 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2008).  Defendants now move for summary judgment on all remaining \nclaims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  For the following reasons, Defendantsโ motion for \nsummary judgment is GRANTED in its entirety.     \n \nBACKGROUND \nIn June, 1996, Jovanovic, then a 30-year-old doctoral candidate at Columbia University, \nmet a Barnard College student named Jamie Rzucek in an America Online chat room. (Jovanovic \nDep. 46-47; Amended Compl. ยถ 106.)  Over the course of several months, Jovanovic and Rzucek \ncorresponded via instant message (โIMโ) and e-mail and exchanged phone numbers. (Jovanovic \nDep. Ex. D, E.)  On the morning of Friday, November 22, 1996, Jovanovic and Rzucek spoke on \nthe phone and, during a conversation that lasted nearly five hours, agreed to go to dinner and a \nmovie that evening.  (Jovanovic Dep. 87-88.)   \nAt around 8:00 p.m. on the night of November 22, 1996, Jovanovic drove from his \napartment in Washington Heights to Rzucekโs Barnard dormitory on West 116th Street.  \n(Jovanovic Dep. 99-100.)  After Jovanovic arrived at Rzucekโs dormitory, the pair drove to a \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 3 of 30\nThai restaurant downtown for dinner. (Jovanovic Dep. 105.)  Once they finished dinner, they \nrealized that they would miss the movie, Microcosmos, that they had intended to see together \nthat night. (Jovanovic Dep. 96, 99.)  Jovanovic and Rzucek decided to drive around to several \nvideo rental stores looking for a copy of Tokyo Decadence, a film with strong sadomasochistic \nthemes which they had previously discussed. (Trial Tr. 175-78)  Unable to find a copy of the \nmovie, Jovanovic and Rzucek returned to Jovanovicโs apartment with the intent of watching a \ndifferent film. (Jovanovic Dep. 114.)  Upon arrival, Jovanovic made Rzucek tea, and Rzucek \nexamined a book of photography by Joel Peter Witkin that contained depictions of morbid \nsubjects. (Jovanovic Dep. 118, 121-24.)  Later, Jovanovic and Rzucek watched a movie entitled \nMeet the Feebles. (Jovanovic Dep.126-27.) \nAfter staying overnight at Jovanovicโs apartment, (Jovanovic Dep. 162-63), Rzucek left \nat some point during the afternoon or evening of Saturday, November 23, 1996. (Jovanovic Dep. \n180; Rzucek Grand Jury Testimony 36-37.)  Over the course of the next few days, Rzucek told \nseveral people, including a friend named Luke DuBois (โDuBoisโ), her mother, her roommate \nEmily Powers (โPowersโ), and head of Barnard security William OโConnor (โOโConnorโ), about \na forced sexual encounter with Jovanovic. (Trial Tr. 287-88, 1421; OโConnor Dep. 44, 51-52.)  \nOn November 27, 1996, Dr. Karlene Chin Quee, a board certified OB/GYN, examined Rzucek at \nBarnard Health Services. (Trial Tr., 1827, 1830-31.)  During the course of the examination, \nRzucek described the incident. (Trial Tr. 1831-32, 1844.)  Shortly after this examination, Rzucek \nhad a second conversation with OโConnor, who called his contact in the New York Police \nDepartmentโs Photo Unit, Sergeant Francis Monahan.  (OโConnor Dep. at 86, 89.)  Monahan told \nOโConnor that he would โhandle it,โ and he contacted Detective Milton Bonilla of the Special \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 4 of 30\nVictimโs squad.  Following a meeting with Bonilla later that day, OโConnor introduced Bonilla \nto Rzucek. (Bonilla Dep. 29-30.) \nIt was, therefore, not until four days after the incident that Rzucek reported to Bonilla that \nshe had been sexually assaulted and that Jovanovic was her attacker. (Larkin Dec., Ex. G.)  \nRzucek told Bonilla that Jovanovic had assaulted her for twenty hours, beginning on the night of \nNovember 22, 1996 and continuing through the day of November 23, 1996, (Larkin Dec., Ex G), \nand Rzucek provided a detailed and graphic statement of the incident, in which she alleged that \nJovanovic had tied her up, violently raped and sodomized her, struck her repeatedly with a club, \nburned her with candle wax, and repeatedly gagged her with a variety of materials. (Larkin Dec., \nEx. H.)   \nDespite the gravity of Rzucekโs allegations, Bonilla waited until nine days after his \nmeeting with Rzucek before attempting to question Jovanovic.  It is unclear whether Bonilla \nconducted any additional investigation during this nine-day period, which included the \nThanksgiving holiday.  On December 5, 1996, Bonilla and his partner, Detective Charles Cullen, \nwent to Jovanovicโs apartment. (Bonilla Dep. 118-20.)  After showing identification, Jovanovic \nallowed the detectives to enter the premises. (Bonilla Dep. 118-20.)  According to Jovanovic, \nafter he asked the detectives whether or not he needed to contact an attorney, he was \nimmediately taken to a police precinct. (Jovanovic Dep. 204-06.)  Later that day, Bonilla arrested \nJovanovic for the rape, sodomy, and unlawful imprisonment of Rzucek. (Jovanovic Dep. 206-\n10.) \nFollowing the arrest, detectives, including Bonilla, obtained a search warrant and \nreturned to Jovanovicโs apartment to search for the items allegedly used in the assault. (Bonilla \nDep. 146-47.)   Upon arrival, Plaintiffโs mother, Sabina Jovanovic, was inside the apartment with \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 5 of 30\nthe door chain locked. (S. Jovanovic Dep. 52.)  Once the detectives produced the search warrant, \nshe let them enter, (S. Jovanovic Dep. 52), and police recovered, among other things, computer \nhard drives, karate belts, and tape. (Larkin Dec., Ex. T.) \nOn December 6, 1996, Jovanovic was arraigned in New York County Criminal Court.  \n(Arraignment Tr. 1.)  Assistant District Attorney Linda Fairstein, the Chief of the Sex Crimes \nUnit of the New York County District Attorneyโs Office, appeared for the office. (Arraignment \nTr. 2.)  Following the arraignment, Fairstein allegedly made numerous extrajudicial statements to \nthe press concerning the case, including but not limited to statements regarding details of the \nalleged assault; statements vouching for the complainant; speculation about there being other \nvictims; and descriptions of evidence seized by the police. (Amended Compl. ยถ 79-81.)1   \nIn addition, Jovanovic alleges that trial witnesses were influenced by the extensive press \ncoverage of the case.  Mary Jo Chambers, a material witness according to Jovanovic, came \nforward only after hearing about the case in the newspaper and testified at the criminal trial about \nIM conversations she had allegedly had with Jovanovic in which he spoke about what he had \ndone to Rzucek. (Norinsberg Dec., Ex. 103, Chambers Trial Tr.)  Chambersโ testimony was \naddressed by both parties during summations, and became the subject of a read-back requested \nby the jury during their deliberations. (Norinsberg Dec., Ex. 92.)   \n                                                 \n1 For example, the Amended Complaint quotes Fairstein as saying: โHe terrorized this young woman to the point \nthat she was too frightened to call the authorities until weeks after it happenedโ; he โtied her to a chair, undressed \nher, and tortured her with sex toys and other objects for almost a full dayโ; he โtortured and sexually abused the \nwoman, burning her with candle wax, biting her, sexually assaulting her and threatening to dismember her as Jeffrey \nDahmer, the serial killer, had done with his victimsโ; he โtied the womanโs legs to a chair and gagged her before \nsexually torturing herโ; he โwas so prepared for this and carried it off so smoothlyโ; โ[w]e believe this was not the \nfirst time he did something like thisโ; and โ[w]e believe there are other victims.โ  (Amended Compl. ยถ 79.)  In \naddition, Fairstein emphasized to the press that this was her officeโs โfirst internet-related sex prosecutionโ and that \nthe case represented a โwhole new entry in the acquaintance-rape category.โ  (Amended Compl. ยถ 81.) \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 6 of 30\nPrior to presenting the case to the Grand Jury, Assistant District Attorney Gail Heatherly \nmet with OโConnor to discuss Rzucekโs complaint; reviewed the photographs of Rzucek taken at \nBarnard Health Services; reviewed the medical records of and spoke to Dr. Chin Quee; spoke to \nEmily Powers; spoke to Rzucekโs mother; and spoke with the detectives who investigated the \ncase. (Heatherly Dep. 87-88.)  She presented the case to the Grand Jury on December 13 and \nDecember 19, 1996 โ both Rzucek and Bonilla testified, along with other witnesses. (Larkin \nDec., Ex. GG.)  Bonilla testified that he saw a candle or multiple candles inside Jovanovicโs \napartment during his initial visit on December 5, 1996, but that the candle or candles were not \nthere when he returned to the apartment to execute the search warrant later that night. (Bonilla \nGrand Jury Testimony 51, 54.)2  The Grand Jury indicted Jovanovic on December 19, 1996. \n(Larkin Dec., Ex. HH.)   \nFifteen months later, on March 10, 1998, jury selection for the criminal trial began.  Each \njuror was asked, prior to voir dire, to complete a jury questionnaire including specific questions \nabout pre-trial press coverage of the case.  During jury selection, in which both sides used all of \ntheir preemptory challenges, Jovanovic successfully challenged one juror for cause, relating to \nissues of pretrial publicity.  At the conclusion of jury selection, defense counsel consented to the \npanel, subject to challenges under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).  During the trial, one \njuror became ill and was replaced by an alternate without objection. (Trial Tr. 1868-74.) \nOn April 15, 1998, the jury found Jovanovic guilty of Kidnapping in the First Degree, \nthree counts of Sexual Abuse in the First Degree, one count of Assault in the Second Degree, and \nAssault in the Third Degree. (Trial Tr. 3527-34.)  He was acquitted of all other charges. (Trial \n                                                 \n2 When asked in his deposition in the present matter if he had candles in his apartment at the time of the alleged \ncrime, Jovanovic said, โNo. At that time, I donโt think I had any candles in my apartment.โ (Jovanovic Dep. 163.)   \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 7 of 30\nTr. 3527-34.)  On May 29, 1998, Jovanovic was sentenced to a term of fifteen years to life in \nprison. (Larkin Dec., Ex. MM.)  On December 21, 1999, the Appellate Division, First \nDepartment reversed Jovanovicโs conviction, finding that the trial judge improperly hampered \nhis ability to present a defense by erroneously invoking the rape-shield law, thereby denying the \njury access to key evidence regarding Rzucekโs interest in sadomasochistic activity. See People \nv. Jovanovic, 700 N.Y.S.2d 156 (N.Y. App. Div. 1st Dep=t 1999).  At that point, Jovanovic had \nserved more than 20 months in prison.   \nAnticipating a second trial, the prosecution offered Jovanovic several plea deals.  First, he \nwas offered a deal in which he could avoid serving any further time in prison if he would plead \nguilty to a single felony charge.  Maintaining his innocence, Jovanovic refused.  The prosecution \nthen offered Jovanovic a deal that consisted of no further prison time if he would plead guilty to \na single, non-sexual, misdemeanor charge.  Again, Jovanovic refused, maintained his innocence, \nand insisted on a trial.  On November 1, 2001, because Rzucek refused to testify in a second trial, \nthe prosecution moved to dismiss all charges against Jovanovic. The motion was granted and all \ncharges were dismissed, with prejudice. \nThree years later, on October 28, 2004, Jovanovic instituted this action against New York \nCity Police Officer Milton Bonilla (โBonillaโ) and former Assistant District Attorney Linda \nFairstein (โFairsteinโ) under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, alleging false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nmalicious abuse of process, and denial of his right to a fair trial, seeking $20 million in damages, \nplus attorneysโ fees.  Specifically, Jovanovic alleges that Bonilla, while acting in his official \ncapacity, fabricated evidence and proffered false testimony, and that Fairstein, while acting in \nher official capacity, made damaging extrajudicial statements to the press in an effort to secure \nJovanovicโs conviction.  Jovanovic also brought claims against the City of New York under \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 8 of 30\nMonell, 436 U.S. 658 (the โMonell Claimsโ), alleging a municipal policy or custom that gave \nrise to these alleged constitutionally impermissible acts.  \nOn December 13, 2005, Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), and on August 17, 2006, the Court denied Defendantsโ motion, except with \nrespect to the claim of malicious abuse of process.  See Jovanovic v. City of New York, 2006 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 59165.  That claim was dismissed, with leave to replead, and, on September \n18, 2006, Jovanovic filed an amended complaint repleading his malicious abuse of process \nclaim.  On July 9, 2007, Defendants moved for reconsideration of the Courtโs August 17, 2006 \nopinion, arguing that the Supreme Courtโs decision in Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384 (2007), \nconcerning the correct application of the statute of limitations for a Section 1983 false arrest \nclaim, warranted reconsideration of the Courtโs denial of Defendantsโ motion to dismiss that \nclaim.  On February 7, 2008, the Court granted Defendantsโ motion for reconsideration as to \nJovanovicโs false arrest claim and denied the motion as to Jovanovicโs remaining claims.  See \nJovanovic v. City of New York, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8974.  As a result of the aforementioned \nrulings, Jovanovic was left with his claims against Bonilla for malicious prosecution, malicious \nabuse of process, and denial of a fair trial; his claim against Fairstein for denial of a fair trial; and \nhis Monell claims against the City of New York.  On December 21, 2009, Defendants moved for \nsummary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) on all of Jovanovicโs remaining claims.   \n \nDISCUSSION \nI. Summary Judgment Standard \nSummary judgment is appropriate where the record demonstrates that โthere is no \ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 9 of 30\nlaw.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).  A fact is material if it โmight affect the outcome of the suit under \nthe governing law.โ  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  The moving \nparty bears the initial burden of producing evidence on each material element of its claim or \ndefense demonstrating that it is entitled to relief.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 \n(1986).  The evidence on each material element must be sufficient to entitle the movant to relief \nas a matter of law.  See Vt. Teddy Bear Co. v. 1-800 Beargram Co., 373 F.3d 241, 244 (2d Cir. \n2004). \nOnce the moving party has made an initial showing that no genuine issue of material fact \nremains, the nonmoving party may not refute this showing solely by means of โ[c]onclusory \nallegations, conjecture, and speculation,โ Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. Jones Chem., Inc., \n315 F.3d 171, 175 (2d Cir. 2003), but must instead present specific evidence in support of its \ncontention that there is a genuine dispute as to material facts.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2).  The \nCourt resolves all ambiguities and draws all factual inferences in favor of the nonmovant, but \nโonly if there is a โgenuineโ dispute as to those facts.โ  Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007) \n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). \n \nII. Malicious Prosecution Claim Against Bonilla \nโIn order to prevail on a ยง 1983 claim against a state actor for malicious prosecution, a \nplaintiff must show a violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment, and must establish the \nelements of a malicious prosecution claim under state law.โ  Manganiello v. City of New York, \n612 F.3d 149, 160-61 (2d Cir. 2010) (citations omitted).  Because โaccusers must be allowed \nroom for benign misjudgments,โ New York law โplaces a heavy burden on malicious \nprosecution plaintiffs.โ Rothstein v. Carriere, 373 F.3d 275, 282 (2d Cir. 2004) (citing Smith-\n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 10 of 30\nHunter v. Harvey, 734 N.E.2d 750, 752 (N.Y. 2000)).  To prevail on a malicious prosecution \nclaim under New York law, a plaintiff must establish four elements: โ(1) the initiation or \ncontinuation of a criminal proceeding against plaintiff; (2) termination of the proceeding in \nplaintiffโs favor; (3) lack of probable cause for commencing the proceeding; and (4) actual \nmalice as a motivation for defendantโs actions.โ Murphy v. Lynn, 118 F.3d 938, 947 (2d Cir. \n1997).  Here, Defendants argue that Jovanovic cannot establish a genuine issue of material fact \nas to the second or third elements and that therefore a ruling of summary judgment is \nappropriate. \n \nA. The proceeding terminated favorably for Jovanovic \nIn denying Defendantโs motion to dismiss, this Court found that Jovanovic had \nadequately alleged that his criminal proceeding came to a favorable termination.  See Jovanovic \nv. City of New York, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59165, at *27-28.  Although Defendants request \nthat the Court reconsider this issue in light of โevidence adduced in discovery,โ (Def. Mem. at 4), \nsuch evidence does not change the result of the Courtโs analysis.  \nCantolino v. Danner makes clear that โany termination of a criminal prosecution, such \nthat the criminal charges may not be brought again, qualifies as a favorable termination, so long \nas the circumstances surrounding the termination are not inconsistent with the innocence of the \naccused.โ  754 N.E.2d 164, 167 (N.Y. 2001).  Further, a dismissal by the prosecution โin the \ninterest of justice,โ as occurred in this case, may properly be considered a โfavorableโ \ntermination.  Id. at 395-96.  As this Court stated previously, โ[a]fter reversal and remand, \nJovanovic was cloaked again in the constitutional presumption of innocence.โ  Jovanovic v. City \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 11 of 30\nof New York, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59165 at *28.  Thus, the subsequent dismissal in the \ninterest of justice, with prejudice, was in no way inconsistent with Jovanovicโs innocence.   \nDefendants argue that the District Attorneyโs Office never believed that Jovanovic was \ninnocent, (Hobbs Dep. at 229-32), and that the only reason that the District Attorneyโs Office \nmoved for dismissal was because Rzucekโs โpresent emotional state [would] not permit her to \nundergo the stress of a prolonged trial.โ (Def. Mem. 3.)  The subjective beliefs of the members of \nthe District Attorneyโs office, however, as well as the emotional state of the complainant are of \nno consequence when considering whether Jovanovic received a favorable termination.  Because \nthe termination of Jovanovicโs prosecution โin the interest of justice,โ was both final and โnot \ninconsistent withโ Jovanovicโs innocence, the termination of the criminal case was favorable to \nJovanovic, and no evidence or argument provided by Defendants convinces this Court of a \ndifferent result.  \nFurther, where a plaintiff that brings a malicious prosecution claim was charged with \nmultiple offenses, a court must analyze each claim separately for the purposes of determining \nwhether the proceeding terminated favorably for the plaintiff.  Posr v. Doherty, 944 F.2d 91, 100 \n(2d Cir. 1991); Janetka v. Dabe, 892 F.2d 187, 190 (2d Cir. 1989).  Putting aside the above \nanalysis of the proceeding as a whole, the jury acquitted Jovanovic of several of the charges \nlodged against him. As a result, with respect to those charges, the favorable termination \nrequirement is, as a matter of law, clearly satisfied.  \n \nB. There was probable cause for the proceeding  \nUnder New York law, probable cause is a complete defense to a malicious prosecution \nclaim.  Savino v. City of New York, 331 F.3d 63, 72 (2d Cir. 2003) (citing Colon v. City of New \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 12 of 30\nYork, 60 N.Y.2d 78, 82 (N.Y. 1983)).  Probable cause requires โknowledge or reasonably \ntrustworthy information sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that an \noffense has been committed by the person to be arrested.โ  Panetta v. Crowley, 460 F.3d 388, \n395 (2d Cir. 2006).   \n \n1. Plaintiff cannot defeat the presumption of probable cause arising from indictment \nA Grand Jury indictment creates a presumption of probable cause.  Savino, 331 F.3d at \n72.  This presumption โmay only be rebutted by evidence that the indictment was procured by \nโfraud, perjury, the suppression of evidence or other police conduct undertaken in bad faith.โโ  \nId.; see also Marshall v. Sullivan, 105 F.3d 47, 54 (2d Cir. 1996).  The presence of false \ntestimony is not enough to raise an issue of material fact; there must be a demonstration of bad \nfaith โ something more than a mere inconsistency โ to defeat the Grand Jury presumption.  \nSee McClellan v. Smith, 439 F.3d 137, 146 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing, among others, intoxication, \nconflict of interest, pressuring the prosecutor to make a deal with a putative witness, and altering \noneโs testimony as examples of bad faith); Brogdon v. City of New Rochelle, 200 F. Supp. 2d \n411, 422 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (holding that plaintiff must show bad faith or fraud concerning โa \nmatter material to the issue or point in question.โ).  Stated differently, in order to overcome the \npresumption of probable cause arising from a grand juryโs indictment, a Plaintiff, who bears the \nburden of rebutting this presumption, Savino, 331 F.3d at 73 (citing Bernard v. United States, 25 \nF.3d 98, 104 (2d Cir. 1994)), must adduce sufficient evidence to โerode the โpremise that the \nGrand Jury act[ed] judicially.โโ  Rothstein, 373 F.3d at 284.  Jovanovic has failed to carry his \nburden. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 13 of 30\nJovanovic points principally to a small portion of Bonillaโs testimony regarding whether \nhe saw candles inside Jovanovicโs apartment at two different times.3  (Pl. Mem. at 3-4.)  Bonilla \ntold the Grand Jury that, when he was in Jovanovicโs home the first time, he saw candles in the \napartment, but that the candles were missing when he was executing the search warrant later that \nday.  (Bonilla Grand Jury Tr. 51, 54.)  In addition, Rzucek told the Grand Jury that Jovanovic \nburned her with candle wax (Rzucek Grand Jury Testimony 17-19) and Jovanovic had online \nconversations with other women about using candle wax in a similar way. (Larkin Aff., Ex. DD.)  \nIn response, Jovanovic cites his deposition, in which, when asked if he remembered having \ncandles in his apartment, he said, โNo. At that time, I donโt think I had any candles in my \napartment,โ (Jovanovic Dep. 163.), and Rzucekโs dearth of lasting burn marks from candle wax.  \nFrom this, Jovanovic asks this court to conclude that Detective Bonilla โfabricatedโ his \ntestimony regarding the presence of candles in the apartment, or at least that there is a genuine \nissue of material fact as to the existence of the candles that must be weighed by a jury. \nWhile there may be a genuine dispute regarding the existence of candles in the \napartment,4 this is of little moment.  Jovanovic selectively quotes from Richardson v. City of \nNew York, No. 02 CV 3651, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69577 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2006), claiming \n                                                 \n3 Jovanovic also points to Bonillaโs testimony that he recovered โcloth stripsโ from Jovanovicโs apartment.  It is \nundisputed, however, that Jovanovicโs apartment contained karate belts, a type of cloth strip.  This is essentially a \nquibble over terminology, is not a genuine issue of material fact, and does not defeat the Grand Jury presumption of \nprobable cause.  Jovanovic further argues that, at the criminal trial, Bonilla โfabricatedโ a futon video.  Jovanovic, \nhowever, merely claims that Bonilla failed to capture his loosening of the futonโs wing nuts before shooting the \nvideo โ he does not allege that Bonilla actually โfabricatedโ anything.  Additionally, because this video was not \nshown to the Grand Jury, it does not have any relevance with respect to a determination of whether Jovanovic has \novercome the Grand Jury presumption of probable cause.  Lastly, Jovanovic discusses the alleged destruction of \npolice photographs and the loss of Bonillaโs detective file.  It is unclear, however, what effect these items would \nhave if they were a part of the record, and Jovanovic fails to cite any reliable evidence that suggests these items were \ndisposed of improperly. As a result, these issues fail to overcome the Grand Jury presumption of probable cause. \n4 Indeed, even Jovanovicโs mother said that she was unsure about whether there were candles in the apartment. \nSpecifically, in her deposition she stated, โPerhaps there were [candles], but I did not see them.โ (S. Jovanovic Dep. \n61.) \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 14 of 30\nthat it stands for the proposition that if a plaintiff can prove that a defendant police officer \nfabricated any evidence, the presumption of probable cause arising from the Grand Jury \nindictment is automatically overcome.  But the case does not support Jovanovicโs argument.  An \naccompanying footnote provides a helpful synopsis of the proper rule and demonstrates that \nJovanovic has misinterpreted the Richardson courtโs opinion:  \nTwo important limitations on such a [malicious prosecution] claim warrant \nemphasis: In order for a plaintiff to recover, the alleged fabrication must be both \nmaterial, i.e., likely to influence a jury's decision, and the legally cognizable cause \nof the post-arraignment deprivation of liberty. It is particularly critical to \ndistinguish between an alleged fabrication that โprecipitated the sequence of \nevents that resulted in the deprivation of libertyโ from other charges of fabrication \nof evidence. As vile as any fabrication of evidence is, particularly when the \noffender is a law enforcement officer, it seem[s] obvious that a defendant who \nachieves a favorable termination in a criminal case cannot properly be permitted \nto seek damages (and obtain a jury trial) simply by asserting, for example, that \none of several (equally incriminating) alleged admissions in a post-arrest \nstatement was not in fact made. The availability of a cause of action based solely \non a claim of fabrication, without the materiality and causation requirements, \nwould unduly deter prosecutorsโ exercise of discretion to dismiss or abandon \ncases for a broad array of reasons having nothing to do with the defendantโs guilt \nor the claimed fabrication. \n \nRichardson, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69577 at *21 n.4 (quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nHere, Bonillaโs testimony regarding the candles was not the only testimony concerning candles \nand, besides, the candles relate to only one out of the eleven charges returned by the Grand Jury \nagainst Jovanovic: Assault in the Second Degree. An inconsistency in testimony with regard to \nthis single item could not have materially affected the Grand Juryโs ability to come to its decision \nwith regard to the entire indictment.  In other words, although there may be a genuine dispute \nover whether there were, in fact, candles in Jovanovicโs apartment, a resolution of that question \nis not material and, even assuming arguendo that Bonilla fabricated his testimony, this \nfabrication was not the cause of any post-arraignment or post-trial deprivation of liberty.  In sum, \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 15 of 30\nthis inconsistency certainly does not โerode the โpremise that the Grand Jury act[ed] judicially.โโ \nSee Rothstein, 373 F.3d at 284. \nAdditionally, Jovanovic alleges that Detective Bonilla, in a deviation from police \npractices in connection with the investigation, did not, among other things, read the victimโs \nmedical records or the victimโs handwritten statement and that he did not properly voucher for \nevidence the futon on which the alleged assault took place.  All of these alleged omissions were \nknown at the time of the arraignment, the point at which the District Attorneyโs office assumed \nfull control of the prosecution.  Thus, the decision to continue the prosecution at that point was \nmade by the District Attorneyโs office, not Detective Bonilla. As a result, these issues are not \nrelevant with respect to Jovanovicโs attempt to defeat the presumption of probable cause created \nby the Grand Juryโs indictment.  See Williams v. City of New York, No. 02 Civ. 3693, 2003 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 19078, at *19 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2003) (โOnce a criminal defendant has been \nformally charged, the chain of causation between the officerโs conduct and the claim of \nmalicious prosecution is broken by the intervening actions of the prosecutor . . . .โ). \n \n2. The evidence clearly supports a finding of probable cause \nEven without the presumption of probable cause generated by the Grand Jury indictment, \nand even without the candle-related evidence discussed above, the evidence presented to the \nGrand Jury clearly supports a finding of probable cause.  Regardless of whether a false arrest or a \nmalicious prosecution is at issue, the relevant probable cause inquiry is always whether there is \nโprobable cause to believe the crimes charged were committed.โ  Rothstein, 373 F.3d at 283.  \nWhen information is received from a victim or eyewitness, probable cause exists โunless the \ncircumstances raise doubt as to the personโs veracity.โ  Curley v. Village of Suffern, 268 F.3d \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 16 of 30\n65, 70 (2d Cir. 2001).  Further, โthe existence of a โswearing contestโโ between witnesses, \nwithout more, is insufficient to create a question of fact as to probable cause.  Brogdon, 200 F. \nSupp. 2d at 422. \nRzucek provided Bonilla with both an oral and written account of Jovanovicโs crimes and \nseparately told several other people about the incident, including Dubois, Powers, OโConnor, and \nDr. Chin Quee.  In addition, Dr. Chin Quee examined Rzucek on November 27, 1996 and the \nresults of the examination were consistent with Rzucekโs description of what Rzucek claimed \nJovanovic did to her.  Dr. Chin Quee found Rzucek to be credible, and described several \ndifferent bruises and areas of tenderness consistent with Jovanovicโs alleged acts.  Any possible \nconcerns about Rzucekโs veracity would, in a reasonable jurorโs mind, be balanced out by this \nadditional evidence, generating the necessary โknowledge or reasonably trustworthy \ninformationโ for a finding of probable cause.  See Panetta, 460 F.3d at 395.  \nAccordingly, the Defendantโs summary judgment motion as to the malicious prosecution \nclaim against Detective Bonilla is GRANTED. \n \nIII. Malicious Abuse of Process Claim Against Bonilla \nMalicious abuse of process is actionable under Section 1983 where a plaintiff can meet \nthe elements of the claim under New York law.  Savino, 331 F.3d at 76-77.  Under New York \nlaw, to succeed on a malicious abuse of process claim, a plaintiff must establish: (1) that the \ndefendant employed a regularly issued legal process to compel performance or forbearance of \nsome act, (2) with intent to do harm without excuse or justification, and (3) in order to obtain a \ncollateral objective outside the legitimate ends of that process.  Id. at 76.  โWhile a lack of \nprobable cause is not explicitly an element of an abuse of process claim, the presence of probable \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 17 of 30\ncause negates a claim for abuse of process.โ Sforza v. City of New York, 07 Civ. 6122, 2009 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 27358, at *49-50 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2009).  Defendants claim that Jovanovic \nhas not shown the third element โ a collateral objective. \nTo establish a collateral objective, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant โaimed to \nachieve a collateral purpose beyond or in addition to his criminal prosecution.โ  Douglas v. City \nof New York, 595 F. Supp. 2d 333, 344 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)  โ[C]ollateral objectives typically \nassociated with abuse of criminal process are extortion, blackmail, or retribution; and those \nobjectives are usually characterized by personal animus.โ  Oathout v. Decker, No. 99 Civ. 5868, \n2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12001, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2000).  Plaintiff urges the Court to \nbroadly interpret โcollateral objectiveโ to include a wide variety of motives, such as protecting \noneโs reputation and the fear of losing oneโs job.  See Hernandez v. Wells, No. 01 Civ. 4376, \n2003 WL 22771982, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24, 2003); Richardson, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69577, \nat *22.  Indeed, courts have held that protecting oneโs employment could be an objective \nsufficient to establish the collateral objective element of a malicious abuse of process claim.  See \nHernandez, 2003 WL 22771982, at *9 (holding that โsav[ing] his own jobโ satisfied collateral \nobjective element where employee โhad been told that he would be fired if he violated any rules \nor regulations at any time in the futureโ).   \nJovanovic argues that Bonilla arrested him to curry favor with his superiors, particularly \nSergeant Monahan, but offers no direct evidence of this objective or any other motivation.  \nMonahan was not Bonillaโs superior; indeed, Monahan was not even in Bonillaโs unit.  (Cullen \nDep. 19-20.)  Jovanovic points to conversations between Monahan and OโConnor, the head of \nsecurity at Barnard, and notes that Bonilla waited nine days before questioning Jovanovic.  \nAccording to Jovanovic, this suggests that Bonilla only arrested Jovanovic because he wanted to \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 18 of 30\nimpress Monahan.  Standing alone, however, this delay cannot create a genuine issue of fact \nregarding the issue of whether Bonilla had a collateral objective in prosecuting Jovanovic.  Even \nif Monahan specifically called Bonilla and ordered him to arrest Jovanovic, this does not rise to \nthe level of โprotecting oneโs job,โ as there is no evidence that Bonilla believed he could lose his \njob, if he did not arrest Jovanovic.  As a result, the Court finds that Jovanovic fails to establish a \ngenuine issue of material fact with respect to the โcollateral objectiveโ necessary to support a \nmalicious abuse of process claim.  \nMoreover, because, as stated in Section II, supra, there was probable cause to believe that \nJovanovic had committed the crime alleged, the abuse of process claim must fail.  See Sforza, \n2009 U.S. Dist LEXIS 27358, at *49-50. \nAccordingly, Defendantsโ summary judgment motion as to the abuse of process claim \nagainst Detective Bonilla is GRANTED. \n \nIV. Deprivation of Plaintiffโs Right to a Fair Trial Claim Against Bonilla \n \nA plaintiff may bring a Section 1983 action for deprivation of his or her right to a fair \ntrial against โa police officer [who] creates false information likely to influence a juryโs decision \nand [who] forwards that information to prosecutors.โ  Ricciuti v. New York City Transit Auth., \n124 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 1997).  The constitutional right in question is โthe right not to be \ndeprived of liberty as a result of the fabrication of evidence by a government officer acting in an \ninvestigating capacity . . . provided that the deprivation of liberty . . . can be shown to be the \nresult of [the officerโs] fabrication of evidence.โ  Zahrey v. Coffey, 221 F.3d 342, 349 (2d Cir. \n2000).  As a result, as discussed with respect to the malicious prosecution claim in Section II, \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 19 of 30\nsupra, the alleged fabrication must be โlikely to influence a juryโs decision.โ  Ricciuti, 124 F.3d \nat 130. \nBonillaโs allegedly false testimony โ that he found candles in Jovanovicโs apartment โ\ncould not, in and of itself, have resulted in a deprivation of Jovanovicโs liberty.  Bonillaโs \ntestimony regarding the candles related only to one of the Second Degree Assault claims leveled \nagainst him and was not material to any other charge.  Jovanovic was convicted of the far more \nserious charges of Kidnapping in the First Degree and three counts of Sexual Abuse in the First \nDegree, as well as Assault in the Third Degree, and he would have likely received the same \nprison sentence โ and the same pre-trial deprivations of liberty โ regardless of whether the \ncandle evidence was introduced at trial.5 \nJovanovic does not contradict this argument, but instead counters that Defendantsโ \nconception of โdeprivation of libertyโ is incorrect. According to Jovanovic, the relevant inquiry \nis not whether the alleged fabrication of evidence was material to plaintiffโs conviction and post-\nconviction deprivation of liberty, but whether the fabrication caused any deprivation of liberty at \nall, including pre-trial detention.  This distinction is, however, irrelevant.  The allegedly \nfabricated evidence was not material to the decision to detain Jovanovic during the pre-trial time \nperiod and, therefore, there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding this matter.  \nAccordingly, Defendantโs summary judgment motion as to this claim is GRANTED. \n                                                 \n5 As discussed in Section II, supra, Plaintiff also points to Bonillaโs testimony that he recovered โcloth like type \nmaterialsโ from Jovanovicโs apartment.  Again, it is undisputed that Jovanovicโs apartment contained karate belts, a \ntype of cloth strip.  A quibble over terminology does not constitute fabricated evidence or false information, and a \nreasonable jury could not find it so.  Jovanovic further argues that Bonilla โfabricatedโ a futon video that was shown \nat the criminal trial.  Jovanovic, however, merely claims that Bonilla failed to capture his loosening of the futonโs \nwing nuts before shooting the video; he does not allege that Bonilla actually โfabricatedโ evidence.  Further, this \nvideo issue was not pursued by defense counsel at trial or in Jovanovicโs appeal to the Appellate Division, First \nDepartment.  As a result, neither of these items constitutes fabrications of evidence or false testimony that rise to the \nlevel of depriving Jovanovic of a fair trial. \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 20 of 30\n \nV. Deprivation of Plaintiffโs Right to a Fair Trial Claim Against Fairstein \n \nJovanovic alleges that Fairstein made extrajudicial statements that violated her ethical \nresponsibilities and deprived him of a fair trial.  To prevail upon a claim for denial of a fair trial \ndue to extrajudicial statements, a plaintiff must establish three elements: (1) that there were \nโimproper leaksโ under the canons of ethics; (2) that the impermissible disclosures in fact denied \nplaintiff his due process rights; and (3) that other remedies (such as voir dire, use of challenges, \nboth peremptory and for cause, and a motion for change of venue) were unavailable or \nineffective, thereby demonstrating causation. See Powers v. Coe, 728 F.2d 97, 105-06 (2d Cir. \n1984) (โPowers Iโ).    \nDefendants argue at length that the number of relevant statements made by Fairstein was \nextremely low, and that, in any event, the statements were not inappropriate. Jovanovic replies \nthat the amount of relevant statements is extremely high and that each and every one of the \nstatements was grossly improper.  There is no need to discuss the propriety of Fairsteinโs \ncomments, however, because her extrajudicial statements โ even if unwise and/or improper โ \ndid not in fact deprive Jovanovic of a fair trial.6  Jovanovic has demonstrated neither causation \nnor injury stemming from Fairsteinโs statements; and cannot show that other remedies were \nunavailable or ineffective.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6 For this reason, a discussion of Fairsteinโs claim of qualified immunity is unnecessary as well.  Indeed, assuming \nJovanovicโs accusations of prejudicial extrajudicial statements are true, Fairstein may have violated โclearly \nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known,โ  Harlow v. \nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1992), and thus she would not be entitled to qualified immunity for having made \nthem.  Since the Court need not determine whether each individual statement was, in fact, improper, the Court \ndeclines to address the qualified immunity issue.  \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 21 of 30\nA. Plaintiff cannot show causation \nPlaintiff has the burden to โshow that such deprivation was not too remote a consequence \nof the improper leaks to the press.โ  Id. (quoting Martinez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 279, 285 \n(1980)) (internal quotation omitted).  Further, a denial of fair trial claim โrequires more than \nmere speculation of damages.โ  Id. at 105.   \nThe statements at issue were made more than one year before the trial began, and there is \nno competent evidence that the jury verdict was influenced by news reports containing the \ncomments.  While Jovanovic introduces evidence of news stories that jurors may โ or may not \nโ have read, he has not demonstrated a question of fact regarding whether any juror was \nactually prejudiced by such news coverage.  Indeed, just as in Powers v. McGuigan, after \nconsenting to the jury panel, โat no time prior to or during the trial did [plaintiff] suggest that any \nparticular juror or alternate was biased.โ  769 F.2d 72, 74 (2d Cir. 1985) (โPowers IIโ).   \nJovanovic also claims that because Fairstein allegedly knew the statements would be \nprejudicial and would bias a potential jury, she cannot claim that there was a lack of causation. \nThere is absolutely no authority for this proposition. The fact that Fairstein has acknowledged, in \nher deposition and in the media, that pretrial publicity can prejudice a juror is not relevant to the \ndetermination of whether particular pre-trial publicity in fact caused such a prejudicial effect. \nFurther, Jovanovic claims that Fairsteinโs statements caused a biased Grand Jury to indict \nhim.  However, the judge presiding over the Grand Jury proceedings found that โthe instructions \nprovided by the prosecutor to the Grand Jury (including the prosecutorโs instructions to the \nGrand Jury to disregard media coverage concerning this case and to only consider the evidence \npresented) were sufficient.โ  (Pre-Trial Order of Hon. Budd Goodman 2).  As Defendants argue, \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 22 of 30\nthe chain of causation was โbroken by the intervening exercise of independent judgment.โ \nTownes v. City of New York, 176 F.3d 138, 147 (2d Cir. 1999). \nJovanovicโs claim that Fairsteinโs comments caused the allegedly false testimony of \nMary Jo Chambers, thereby depriving Jovanovic of a fair trial, also fails.  First, there is no \nevidence that Chambersโ testimony was anything but truthful โ indeed, she still maintains that \nher trial testimony was accurate.  Second, credibility determinations are a part of every trial, and \nalthough there is no voir dire of witnesses, cross-examination is generally an effective tool for \ndisplaying the credibility โ or lack thereof โ of a particular witness for the jury.  The fact that \nthe jury believed Chambersโ testimony, whether truthful or not, is the criminal juryโs function.  \nAssuming arguendo that Chambersโ testimony was manufactured from pre-trial publicity, \nFairstein could not have possibly foreseen Chambersโ false testimony as a result of her pre-trial \ncomments.  \nIn sum, Jovanovic produced no concrete evidence suggesting that any juror or witness \nwas influenced by Fairsteinโs extrajudicial statements.  As a result, no reasonable juror could \nfind that Jovanovic was deprived of his right to a fair trial, and thus there is no genuine issue of \nmaterial fact to this effect. \n \nB. Other remedies were either available or used effectively \nAt all times, Jovanovic had access to procedural remedies designed to cure potential harm \ncaused by Fairsteinโs extrajudicial statements.  Although Jovanovic failed to take advantage of \nsome of these remedial mechanisms, he employed others effectively.   \nJovanovic never moved for a change of venue.  While Jovanovic claims that the \nwidespread nature of news coverage made such a move futile, (Pl. Mem. at 26 n.21), he fails to \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 23 of 30\ndemonstrate โconcrete particulars to support his allegations of futility.โ  Powers II, 769 F.2d at \n75 (quotation marks omitted).7   \nIn addition, the trial judge took precautions to ensure the selection of a fair and impartial \njury.  These precautions included: distributing a juror questionnaire, which asked questions \nrelating to media coverage of Jovanovicโs case; holding a three-day-long voir dire session; and \nproviding repeated jury instructions as to media exposure.  Further, the trial judge admonished \nthe prospective jurors to provide truthful answers, explained that the extensive media attention \nnecessitated detailed questioning, and discussed publicity with the prospective jurors during the \nvoir dire process and highlighted the potential impact of publicity on the jurorsโ ability to resolve \nthe case in an impartial manner.  Finally, the trial judge instructed all selected and alternate \njurors to start with a clean slate and avoid media coverage of the case.8  After a lengthy voir dire, \nin which both sides used all available preemptory challenges, Jovanovicโs counsel consented to \nthe ultimate panel, subject to objections unrelated to pretrial publicity.9  In addition, Jovanovic \nsuccessfully challenged a juror for cause, relating to issues of pretrial publicity and no objection \nrelating to the pretrial publicity exposure of the jury panel was made on appeal. \n                                                 \n7 Jovanovic selectively cites to United States ex rel Rosenburg v. Mancusi, 445 F.2d 613 (2d Cir. 1971) as \nsupporting his argument that nationwide news coverage precluded the prophylactic effect of a change of venue.  \nHowever, Mancusi generally states that sufficient temporal separation of trial from news coverage negates prejudice \nto the defendant.  The court, in a footnote, states that certain crimes, because of nationwide coverage, may not be \nโnecessarily guarantee[d] isolation from prejudicial news coverage.โ  Id. at 618 n.4.  The court, however, does not \nspecify if such coverage actually affects the defendantโs right to fair trial.   \n8 While ideally all jurors would indeed have a clean slate, the Supreme Court has recognized in Irvin v. Dowd, 366 \nU.S. 717, 722 (1961), that jurors are not required to be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved in the cases \nthat they decide.  \n9 These objections pertained to Batson issues and bore no relation to media bias or exposure.  This issue was also \nraised on appeal at the Appellate Division, First Department, which did not decide the issue. \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 24 of 30\nJovanovic relies on several Supreme Court cases where prejudice was found by reason of \nprejudicial publicity. (Pl. Mem. at 24.)  These cases are distinguished easily from the present \ncase.  For example, in Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 343-45 (1966), Plaintiffโs principal \nexample, a television broadcast center was set up next door to the courtroom and jurors were \nphotographed in the jury box and individually.  In addition, the trial judge refused to take the \nsame type of precautions as the trial judge in the instant case did and, in fact, created a media \nenvironment that denied Mr. Sheppard his right to the โjudicial serenity and calm to which [he] \nwas entitled.โ  Id. at 354-55 (quoting Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 536 (1965)).  In other words, \nthere was far greater publicity during the Sheppard trial that was far more detrimental than that \ninvolved here.  Due to the large volume of publicity in Sheppard, defense counsel moved for a \ncontinuance, change of venue, and even mistrial, all of which were denied.  Id. at 348.  \nMurphy v. Florida is, however, much more analogous to the instant case.  421 U.S. 794 \n(1975).  In Murphy, jurors learned about defendantโs prior convictions and other details about \ndefendantโs robbery charge through news accounts.  In light of a comprehensive voir dire in \nwhich many jurors were excused for having prejudged the plaintiff, and given that the jury \nshowed โno hostility to [the defendant] . . . as to suggest a partiality that could not be laid aside,โ \nthe Supreme Court held that the defendant was not deprived of a fair trial.  Id. at 800.  \nSpecifically, the Court held that โ. . . juror exposure to information about a . . . defendant's prior \nconvictions or to news accounts of the crime with which he is charged alone [does not] \npresumptively deprive[] the defendant of due process.โ  Id. at 799. \nAccordingly, because curative and prophylactic remedies were either available or \neffectively used, and because of a lack of causation, a reasonable juror could not find that \nJovanovic was deprived of a fair trial due to Fairsteinโs extrajudicial statements.  Defendantsโ \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 25 of 30\nsummary judgment motion as to the deprivation of fair trial claim arising from Fairsteinโs \nextrajudicial statements is, therefore, GRANTED. \n \nVI. Monell Claims Against the City of New York \n \nIn Monell, the Supreme Court expressly held that local governments and their agencies \nmay be sued as โpersonsโ under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  436 U.S. at 701.  Municipalities, however, \nare not liable on a theory of respondeat superior for the acts of their employees.  See Walker v. \nCity of New York, 974 F.2d 293, 296 (2d Cir. 1992).10  Municipalities are liable only for their \nown misdeeds, that is, only โwhen execution of a governmentโs policy or custom, whether made \nby its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, \ninflicts the injury.โ  Monell, 436 U.S. at 694. \nโ[T]o hold a city liable under ยง 1983 for the unconstitutional actions of its \nemployees, a plaintiff is required to plead and prove three elements: (1) an official \npolicy or custom that (2) causes the plaintiff to be subjected to (3) a denial of a \nconstitutional right.โ  The failure to train or supervise city employees may \nconstitute an official policy or custom if the failure amounts to โdeliberate \nindifferenceโ to the rights of those with whom the city employees interact.  To \nestablish โdeliberate indifference,โ a plaintiff must show that: [i] a policymaker \nknows โto a moral certaintyโ that city employees will confront a particular \nsituation; [ii] the situation either presents the employee with โa difficult choice of \nthe sort that training or supervision will make less difficultโ or โthere is a history \nof employees mishandling the situation;โ and [iii] โthe wrong choice by the city \nemployee will frequently cause the deprivation of a citizenโs constitutional \nrights.โ \n \nWray v. City of New York, 490 F.3d 189, 195-96 (2d Cir. 2007) (citations omitted) \n                                                 \n10 Van de Kamp v. Goldstein provides that individual officials in the District Attorneyโs office are absolutely \nimmune from claims of failure to train and supervise regarding administrative obligations โdirectly connected with \nthe conduct of a trial.โ  --- U.S. ---, 129 S.Ct. 855, 861-65 (2009).   \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 26 of 30\nJovanovic brings three Monell claims โ two regarding the District Attorneyโs Office, \nand one regarding the New York Police Department.11  First, Jovanovic claims that the District \nAttorneyโs Office had an official policy or custom of making extrajudicial statements to the \npress, โso as to inflame public opinion against such defendants and deprive them of their \nconstitutional right to a fair trial. (Amended Compl. ยถ 170).  Second, Jovanovic claims that the \nNYPD had an official policy or custom of allowing its personnel to โmake โoff-the-recordโ \nstatements to the press in high-profile criminal cases . . . so as to inflame public opinion against \ndefendants in such cases and deprive them of their constitutional right to a fair trial.โ (Id. ยถ 179.) \nFinally, Jovanovic claims that the District Attorneyโs Office โexhibited a deliberate indifference \ntoward the training and supervision of assistant district attorneysโ with regard to several items, \nincluding the avoidance of giving improper summations. (Id. ยถ 188.) \nSince, as stated in Sections IV and V, supra, Jovanovic was not deprived of a fair trial, \nhis Monell claims fail.  See Wray, 490 F.3d at 195; City of Los Angeles v. Heller, 475 U.S. 796, \n                                                 \n11 Jovanovicโs opposition memorandum discusses an additional claim based on the NYPDโs failure to train \ndetectives regarding false rape claims.  However, as defendant argues, Jovanovic did not sufficiently plead this \nclaim. Although Jovanovic urges that this claim was sufficiently pleaded in ยถ 168-69 of the Amended Complaint, \nthese paragraphs constitute nothing more than introductory paragraphs to an entire section devoted to Jovanovicโs \nMonell claims.  In this section, there are three clearly delineated subsections, each discussing a separate claim under \nMonell.  Most importantly, Section III of this Monell section specifically discusses a โfailure to trainโ claim \nregarding the District Attorneyโs Office. Surely, if Jovanovic intended to bring a Monell claim of this sort against \nthe NYPD, he would have added a separate section to this effect or requested leave from the court to amend his \ncomplaint.  Paragraphs 168-69 of the Amended Complaint only provide general information about the Monell \nclaims that are to be expanded upon later in the section, and do not include allegations of the requisite elements of \nthe claim โ the allegations made in the paragraphs are barely even โnaked assertion[s] devoid of further factual \nenhancement.โ  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, --- U.S. ---, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bell \nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007)).  Further, although in Hogan v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., relied \nupon by Jovanovic, the court allowed a claim that was not originally discussed in the complaint, the court allowed \nthe claim only after the complaint had been conformed to the proof introduced at trial.  167 F.3d 781, 784 (2d Cir. \n1999).  Accordingly, the Court does not recognize this claim. Even if the Court were to recognize this claim, \nhowever, Defendantsโ motion for summary judgment would be granted.  In finding in Section II, supra, that there \nwas probable cause to believe that Jovanovic committed the crimes alleged, the Court found that there was no \ngenuine issue of fact as to this matter, and therefore Jovanovic cannot establish a genuine issue of material fact as to \nthe underlying constitutional violation necessary to survive a motion for summary judgment on this Monell claim.   \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 27 of 30\n799 (1986).  However, even if Jovanovic had been denied a fair trial, this Court would still grant \nDefendantsโ motion for summary judgment as to the Monell claims for the reasons that follow.  \n \nA. Monell Claims Regarding โOff-the-Recordโ and Extrajudicial Statements \n  Jovanovic alleges that the New York Police Department โhad an official policy or custom \nof โmak[ing] โoff-the-recordโ statements to the press in high-profile criminal cases . . . so as to \ninflame public opinion against defendants in such cases and deprive them of their constitutional \nright to a fair trial.โ (Amended Compl. ยถ 179.)  In addition, Jovanovic alleges that the โDistrict \nAttorneyโs Office had an official policy or custom of making extrajudicial statements to the \npressโ that would have a similar effect. (Amended Compl. ยถ 170.)  Jovanovic does not, however, \nrespond to Defendantsโ arguments in support of summary judgment on these claims and they are, \ntherefore, abandoned.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2) (nonmovantโs response must โset out specific \nfacts showing a genuine issue for trial. If the opposing party does not so respond, summary \njudgment should, if appropriate, be entered against that partyโ); see generally M.M. ex rel. J.M. \nv. New York City Depโt of Educ., No. 09 Civ. 5236, 2010 WL 2985477 (S.D.N.Y. July 27, \n2010) (holding that where plaintiff failed to respond to defendantโs arguments for dismissal, \nplaintiffโs claims were abandoned); Brandon v. City of New York, 705 F.Supp.2d 261 (S.D.N.Y. \n2010) (collecting cases). \n  But, even if Jovanovic had not abandoned these claims, the Court would grant \nDefendantโs motion for summary judgment.  As Defendants argue, โevidence of one instanceโ in \nwhich municipal employees violated a citizenโs rights is not enough to create a triable issue of \nfact as to whether an official policy or custom existed.  See Green v. City of New York, 465 F.3d \n65, 80-81 (2d Cir. 2006).  Indeed, the policy or custom โmust be so manifest as to imply the \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 28 of 30\nconstructive acquiescence of senior policy-making officials.โ See id. at 80 (quoting Sorlucco v. \nN.Y. City Police Depโt, 971 F.2d 864, 871 (2d Cir.1992)).  Here, Jovanovic has made bald \nassertions regarding policies or customs, but has only provided Defendants and the Court with \nexamples stemming from the instant case. As a result, Plaintiff has not adequately shown policies \nor customs necessary to defeat Defendantsโ motion for summary judgment on these claims. \n \nB. Monell Claim Regarding the District Attorneyโs Officeโs Alleged Failure to Train \nJovanovic claims that the District Attorneyโs Office โexhibited a deliberate indifference \ntoward the training and supervision of assistant district attorneysโ with regard to several items, \nincluding: (1) the obligation to discontinue a criminal prosecution when evidence is discovered \nthat negates probable cause, (2) the obligation to comply with obligations under Brady v. \nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and (3) the obligation to avoid giving improper summations. \n(Amended Compl. ยถ 188.)  Jovanovicโs response to Defendantsโ motion centers principally on \nAssistant District Attorney Gail Heatherlyโs improper remarks during summation.  These \nallegedly included: (1) attacking the integrity of defense counsel; (2) vouching for witnesses; (3) \nattacking Jovanovicโs expert witnesses; (4) appealing to class prejudice; (5) emphasizing \nJovanovicโs failure to testify; and (6) misleading the jury into believing that Jovanovic had \nattended medical school.  \nJovanovic has failed to submit sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude \nthat the District Attorneyโs Office had an improper policy or custom that deprived him of a fair \ntrial.  The New York County District Attorneyโs office obtained myriad convictions during the \n1990โs.  Yet, Jovanovic lists only seven Appellate Division decisions involving improper \ncomments in summation.  Moreover, Jovanovic points to only a handful of examples of improper \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 29 of 30\ntraining.  This small number of cases and instances of improper training is insufficient to \nestablish that the DAโs office was on notice of its allegedly deficient training or that these \ndeficiencies are the result of deliberate indifference.  See Wray, 490 F.3d at 196 (โWray \nsubmitted a list of New York cases in which suggestive show-up identification evidence was \nimpermissibly admitted by courts; but only one post-dates 1992 โ a telling datum when one \nconsiders the thousands of identifications conducted by each New York City Police Department \nprecinct each year.  The police training thus appears to be largely successful.โ).   \nFurthermore, during the criminal trial, the trial judge made decisions to overrule \nJovanovicโs objections to alleged prosecutorial misconduct.  These decisions constitute a \nsuperseding cause of any alleged harm to Jovanovic.  Decisions of a trial judge who was not \nmisled or coerced constitutes a superseding cause of harm, breaking the chain of causation for \nSection 1983 liability purposes.  Id. at 193-94 (police officer who conducted unduly suggestive \nshow-up identification not liable in Section 1983 action for deprivation of fair trial because trial \njudge, by admitting testimony of stationhouse show-up identification, was intervening cause of \nharm); see Townes, 176 F.3d at 147 (police officer who illegally seized inculpatory evidence not \nliable in Section 1983 action for deprivation of fair trial because, by denying plaintiffโs motion to \nsuppress, the trial judge was intervening cause of harm).  As a result, the trial judgeโs decisions \noverruling Jovanovicโs objections to prosecutorial misconduct constituted a superseding cause of \nJovanovicโs alleged harm.12 \n                                                 \n12 Defendants make two additional arguments for summary judgment as to the Monell claims.  Both of these \narguments are unpersuasive.  First, Defendants argue that Jovanovic cannot show any violation of his due process \nrights arising from prosecutorial misconduct because, in reviewing the trial courtโs decision, the Appellate Division \ndid not make a finding of misconduct, focusing on the trial courtโs misapplication of the Rape Shield Law in \nexcluding certain evidence.  The Appellate Division, however, did not address prosecutorial misconduct, so its \ndecision is not probative on that issue.  Defendants further argue that the Supreme Court decision Van de Kamp v. \nGoldstein, --- U.S. ---, 129 S.Ct. at 863, bars Jovanovicโs Monell claim.  Van de Kamp holds that, with respect to \n \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-08437-PAC   Document 124    Filed 09/28/10   Page 30 of 30\nAccordingly, Defendants' summary judgment motion as to Jovanovic's Monell claims is \nGRANTED. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants motion for summary judgment is GRANTED in its \nentirety.  The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the pending motion and enter judgment \naccordingly. \nDated:  New York, New York \nSeptember 28,2010 \nSO ORDERED \n1Li/I?rL\nPAUL A. CROTTY \nUnited States District Judge \nsupervision and training as to trial-related functions of prosecutors, members of a district attorney's office enjoy \nabsolute immunity from failure to train suits under Section 1983.  However, Van de Kamp did not address Monell \nliability; it addressed only failure to supervise liability of individual district attorneys.  See Norton v. Town oflslip. \nNo. 04-cv-3079, 2009 WL 804702, at ยฐ18-19, ยฐ25-27 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2009) (finding prosecutor immune under \nGoldstein, but holding that Suffolk County could be liable under Monell for failure to supervise prosecutors); but \nsee Thompson v. Connick, 578 F.3d 293, 293-95 (5th Crr. 2009) (Jones, C.J., concurring) (opining that Goldstein's \nrationale applies equally to Monell claims and should thus apply with equal force). \n30 ",
