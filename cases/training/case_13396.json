    "summary": "<p>On August 21, 2010, a man of Hispanic origin filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law, against the Cobb County Police Department. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, alleged that the police stopped, searched, and arrested him without reasonable suspicion and probable cause, which violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The plaintiff alleged that the police used excessive force and that he was falsely imprisoned. He requested compensatory and punitive damages.</p><p>This case was filed after the defendants' arrest charges were dismissed. The background of the arrest is as follows:</p><p>Plaintiff was riding a bicycle in Cobb County on March 26, 2010. The defendants, sitting in a marked patrol car, allegedly stopped the plaintiff because they believed he was Hispanic and not a U.S. citizen. The defendants claimed that they stopped the plaintiff because he failed to yield to traffic. The plaintiff contended that the defendants broke his nose and left eye socket during questioning and arrest.</p><p>After the arrest, the plaintiff spent over four months in the Cobb County Jail on charges of misdemeanor grade obstruction or hindering law enforcement officers. At this time, the defendants lacked authority to enforce federal immigration law, but the county jail was authorized to process immigration violations pursuant to an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. </p><p>Contesting the arrest charges, the plaintiff filed a motion to suppress evidence by arguing that the defendants' stop and detention were unconstitutional. The motion was granted by the Cobb County State Court (Judge Progers) on August 10, 2010. All criminal charges by the defendants for arresting the plaintiff were dismissed and defendants declined to further pursue the charges. However, the plaintiff faced immigration proceedings due to the improper arrest by the defendants. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed this case to recover damages incurred from the dismissed arrest charges.</p><p>On May 10, 2011, the District Court (Judge Forrester) dismissed this case with prejudice based on a settlement submitted by the parties.</p>",

This federal civil rights lawsuit arises from the unwarranted \nstop, arrest and brutal assault of an unarmed Latino bicyclist by Officers of \nthe Cobb County Police Department. \n2.  On March 26, 2010, the Defendant officers stopped Plaintiff \nAngel Francisco Castro-Torres (\"Mr. Castro\") as he rode a bicycle in Cobb \n\nCase 1:10-cv-02636-JOF   Document 1   Filed 08/23/10   Page 2 of 25\nCounty, Georgia.  Defendants observed that Mr. Castro was Hispanic before \nthey stopped his bicycle. Defendants demanded identification from Mr. \nCastro, questioned his immigration status, and arrested him.  In the course of \nthis arrest, the officers brutally assaulted Mr. Castro, breaking bones in his \nnose and left eye socket.  Upon arrest, Defendants took Mr. Castro to the \nCobb County Adult Detention Center (\"Cobb County Jail\"), where he was \nsubjected to immigration questioning.  Mr. Castro was detained at the Cobb \nCounty Jail for over four months and was subsequently transferred to the \ncustody of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for \nplacement in removal proceedings. \n3.  The Cobb County Jail is the primary jail housing persons \narrested by Officers of the Cobb County Police Department.  While Cobb \nCounty Police Department patrol officers, like the Defendants, lack the \nauthority to enforce federal immigration law, the jail is administered by the \nCobb County Sherriff.  The Cobb County Sherriff's Office is authorized, \npursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement with ICE under 8 U.S.c. § \n1357(g); INA § 287(g) (,,287(g) immigration authority\"), to interrogate and \nprocess for immigration violations any noncitizen who comes into contact \nwith designated jail staff after arrest. \n2 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-02636-JOF   Document 1   Filed 08/23/10   Page 3 of 25\n4.  Since the February 2007 effective date of the Cobb County \nJail's 287(g) immigration authority, more than 4,500 noncitizens have been \nremoved from the United States after arrest in Cobb County.  Very few of \nCobb County's noncitizen detainees contested the criminal charges against \nthem or the bases for the arrests which brought them to the 287(g) facility, \nbefore they were removed from the United States. \n5.  Upon information and belief, Defendants knew of the Cobb \nCounty Jail's 287(g) immigration authority when they stopped and arrested \nMr. Castro and took him to the Cobb County Jail. \n6.  Upon information and belief, the Defendants stopped and \narrested Mr. Castro because of his Latino race and ethnicity, from which \nthey inferred that he was a noncitizen. \n7.  On August 10,2010 the Cobb County State Court granted Mr. \nCastro's motion to suppress evidence on the grounds that Defendants acted \nunconstitutionally in stopping him without any reasonable suspicion of \ncriminal activity.  The Court dismissed all criminal charges brought against \nMr. Castro under an order of nolle prosequi. \n8.  Mr. Castro now seeks redress for the Defendants' violations of \nhis constitutional rights and for his false imprisonment. \n3 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-02636-JOF   Document 1   Filed 08/23/10   Page 4 of 25\nJURISDICTION \n9.

Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), as a substantial \npart of the events giving rise to the claims occurred in the Northern District \nof Georgia. \nPARTIES \n11.

At all times relevant to this action, Mr. Castro was a \"person\" \nfor the purposes of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n13.  Defendant Jeremiah M. Lignitz (\"Defendant Lignitz\") was, at all \ntimes relevant to this action, a law enforcement officer employed by the \nCobb County Police Department. \n4 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-02636-JOF   Document 1   Filed 08/23/10   Page 5 of 25\n14.  At all times relevant to this action, Defendant Lignitz was a \nperson acting under color of state or local law . \n15.  Defendants Lignitz is sued in his individual capacity. \n16.  Defendant Brian J. Walraven (\"Defendant Walraven) was, at all \ntimes relevant to this action, a law enforcement officer employed by the \nCobb County Police Department. \n17.  At all times relevant to this action, Defendant Walraven was a \nperson acting under color of state or local law. \n18.

On the afternoon of March 26, 2010, Plaintiff Angel Francisco \nCastro-Torres (\"Mr. Castro\") was traveling south along South Cobb Drive in \nCobb County, Georgia on a bicycle. \n20.  As Mr. Castro traveled south on South Cobb Drive, he passed \nin front of Defendants Lignitz's and Walraven's marked patrol car, which \nwas waiting at a red light in an eastbound lane of a road intersecting South \nCobb Drive. \n2!.  Defendants noted that Mr. Castro was Hispanic as he rode past \n5 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-02636-JOF   Document 1   Filed 08/23/10   Page 6 of 25\nthem. \n22.  Mr. Castro was not known to Defendants. \n23.  Defendants had no information as to any prior conduct or \nmisconduct on Mr. Castro's part. \n24.  Mr. Castro was unarmed. \n25.  At no time relevant to this action did Defendants have any \nreason to believe that Mr. Castro might have been armed, dangerous or \nabout to commit a crime. \n26.  Defendants turned to follow Mr. Castro south on South Cobb \nDrive. \n27.  Defendants motioned to Mr. Castro to stop his bicycle and \npulled their car into the intersection of South Cobb Drive and Old Concord \nRoad, where Mr. Castro stopped his bicycle, in compliance with Defendants' \ndirections. This March 26,2010 encounter, and subsequent questioning are \nreferred to hereinafter as \"the Terry stop.\" \n28.  At no time relevant to this action did Defendants activate their \nmarked patrol car's warning lights. \n29.  Defendants purport to have made the Terry stop because Mr. \nCastro failed to yield to traffic. \n6 \n\nCase 1:10-cv-02636-JOF   Document 1   Filed 08/23/10   Page 7 of 25\n30.  At no time relevant to this action did Mr. Castro fail to yield to \ntraffic. \n31.  Upon information and belief, Defendants stopped Mr. Castro \nbecause of his Latino race and ethnicity. \n32.  Upon information and belief, Defendants stopped Mr. Castro \nbecause they inferred that he was a not a U.S. citizen. \n33.
