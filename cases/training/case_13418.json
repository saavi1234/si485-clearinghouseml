    "summary": "<p>On December 10, 2013, a non-profit religious organization filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The plaintiffs alleged that the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) contraception insurance mandate violated the First Amendment, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs contended that the accommodation for non-profit religious organizations was insufficient to remedy these harms. The plaintiffs sought both a preliminary and permanent injunction that would keep the government from enforcing the contraception insurance mandate against them.</p><p>On December 10, 2013, the plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order against the defendant and for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff stated that it would be harmed as soon as the new insurance requirements became effective on January 1, 2014. Because of this impending harm, the plaintiff claimed it required an injunction, which would prevent the government from enforcing the mandate against it. The defendants opposed this motion on the grounds that the accommodation to the ACA mandate did not substantially burden the plaintiffs' religious freedom under RFRA or cause the plaintiff's irreparable harm.</p><p>On December 23, 2013, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss or summary judgment in the alternative. The defendant argued that the ACA did not substantially burden the plaintiff's exercise of religion and that, even if it did, the ACA met strict scrutiny.</p><p>On January 2, 2014, the District Court ordered that the plaintiff was entitled to a permanent injunction because the accommodation imposed a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion. Specifically, the mandate impermissibly required the head of a religious organization to sign a form that authorized a third party to provide contraception insurance coverage to the organization's employees. 10 F. Supp. 3d 725. The next day, the court ordered a final judgment and order of injunction that stated its terms and the acts restrained.</p><p>The defendants appealed on February 24, 2014. On appeal, this case was consolidated with other cases, including <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12667\"><i>East Texas Baptist University v. Sebelius</i></a>. The Fifth Circuit overturned the district court, stating that \"the acts that violated their faith are those of third parties\" and that, under RFRA, the plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the acts of those third parties. Thus, the Fifth Circuit held that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate that the ACA, with its exemption, substantially burdened the plaintiffs' religious exercise. </p><p>The plaintiffs appealed and on May 17, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a petition for writ of certiorari. The Supreme Court vacated the judgement and remanded the case, citing <i>Zubik</i>, which held that it was appropriate to vacate and remand so that the courts of appeals could address the arguments in response to the order for supplemental briefs. The supplemental briefing request asked parties to address how contraceptive coverage could be obtained by employees through insurance companies that did not require any involvement by plaintiffs beyond their decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage. 136. S. Ct. 1557.</p><p>The court of appeals then granted defendants' motion to stay the proceedings to allow the parties to negotiate a solution in accordance with the Supreme Court's order.   </p><p>On October 16, 2017, the parties filed a joint stipulation to dismiss, citing new regulations that afforded the plaintiffs an exemption. The new regulations stated that forcing the plaintiffs to choose between the contraception mandate or penalties imposed a substantial burden on religious exercise under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. On October 19, 2017, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Court granted the joint stipulation and dismissed the case.  </p><p>The case is closed. </p>",

Before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), Pub. L. No.  111-\n148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), due largely to cost, Americans used preventive services at about \nhalf the recommended rate. See INST. OF MED., CLINICAL PREVENTATIVE SERVICES FOR WOMEN: \nCLOSING THE GAPS 19-20, 109 (2011) (“IOM REP.”), AR at 317-18, 407. \n \nRESPONSE: Disputed and unsupported. To the extent Defendants refer to preventive \nservices generally, this statement is immaterial, as Plaintiffs challenge only the aspects of the \npreventive service requirements regarding “FDA-approved contraceptive methods and \ncontraceptive counseling”—a term that includes abortion-inducing products, contraception, \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 2 of 27 PageID #:  885\n \nsterilization, and related counseling and education (collectively, “contraceptive services”). To \nthe extent that Defendants are suggesting that “preventive services” include contraceptive \nservices, the pages of the IOM Report Defendants cite do not support their assertion.  \nThe only related statement in these pages is a single survey “indicat[ing] that less than \nhalf of women are up to date with recommended preventive care screenings and services \n(Robertson and Collins, 2011).” IOM REP. at 20. That survey, however, did not  consider \ncontraceptive coverage to be “preventive care.” Rather, “[t]he survey asked women  whether \nthey had received a set of recommended preventive screening tests: blood pressure, \ncholesterol, cervical cancer, colon cancer (for ages 50 to 64) and breast cancer (for ages 50 to \n64) screens.” See Robertson & Collins, Women at risk: Why increasing numbers of women are \nfailing to get the health care they need and how the Affordable Care Act will help, in Realizing \nHealth Reform’s Potential (2011), at 8-9. Similarly, the only study referenced in the  cited \nIOM pages actually relating to contraception does not discuss rates of women’s use of \ncontraceptive services; rather, it analyzes women who already use some type of contraception, \nbut decided to switch to another type. See IOM REP. at 119. \n2.  Section 1001 of the ACA requires all group health plans and health insurance \nissuers that offer non-grandfathered group or individual health coverage to provide coverage for \ncertain preventive services without cost-sharing, including, “[for] women, such additional \npreventive care and screenings . . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration [(HRSA)].” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). \n \nRESPONSE: Undisputed that the quoted text appears in Section 1001 of the ACA, but \nSection 1001 of the ACA is a provision of law, not a statement of fact. \n   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 3 of 27 PageID #:  886\n \n3.  Because there were no existing HRSA guidelines relating to preventive care and \nscreening for women, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) tasked the Institute \nof Medicine (IOM) with developing recommendations to implement the requirement to provide \ncoverage, without cost-sharing, of preventive services for women. IOM REP. at 2, AR at 300. \n \nRESPONSE: Disputed. Plaintiffs do not dispute that HHS tasked IOM with developing \nrecommendations to implement the requirement to provide coverage, without cost-sharing, of \npreventive services for women, but dispute the propriety of HHS delegating its authority for \ncreating preventive care guidelines to IOM, the impartiality of the IOM committee that was \nformulated to recommend preventive care guidelines, the methods the IOM committee employed \nto take on this task, and the recommendations the IOM offered. Specifically, HHS outsourced its \ndeliberations to the IOM, which in turn created a “Committee on Preventive Services for \nWomen” that invited presentations from several “pro-choice” groups, such as Planned \nParenthood and the Guttmacher Institute (named for a former president of Planned Parenthood), \nwithout inviting any input from groups that oppose government-mandated coverage for abortion, \ncontraception, and sterilization. See IOM REP. at 218-19. \nIn addition, “[t]he Report acknowledges” that it suffered from an “unacceptably short \ntime frame for the [ ] committee to conduct or solicit meaningful reviews of the evidence \nassociated with the preventive nature of the services considered,” IOM Rep. at 231-32. Further, \n“the committee process for evaluation of the evidence lacked transparency and  was largely \nsubject to the preferences of the committee’s composition. Troublingly, the process  tended to \nresult in a mix of objective and subjective determinations filtered through a lens of  advocacy.” \nId. at 232. Ultimately, “the committee erred [in] their zeal to  recommend something despite the \ntime constraints and a far from perfect methodology” and  “failed to demonstrate [transparency \nand strict objectivity] in the Report.” Id. at 232-33. The “evidence evaluation process [was] a \nfatal flaw of the Report.” Id. at 233. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 4 of 27 PageID #:  887\n \n4.  After conducting an extensive science-based review, IOM recommended that \nHRSA guidelines include, among other things, “the full range of [FDA]-approved contraceptive \nmethods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for women with \nreproductive capacity.” Id. at 10-12, AR at 308-10. \n \n \nRESPONSE: Undisputed that the quoted text appears in the IOM Report, but disputed \nthat the IOM’s review was “extensive” and “science-based.” See Response to Paragraph 3, \nabove. Plaintiffs incorporate herein their response to Paragraph 3, supra. \n5.  FDA-approved contraceptive methods include diaphragms, oral contraceptive \npills, emergency contraceptives (such as Plan B and Ella), and intrauterine devices (“IUDs”). See \nid. at 105, AR at 403. \n \nRESPONSE:  Undisputed, but incomplete. FDA-approved contraceptive methods also \ninclude, inter alia, sterilization. See IOM REP. at 104-05. Further, Ulipristal (trade name “Ella”) \nis a close analogue to the abortion drug RU-486, with the same biological effect—that is, it can \ninduce an abortion even after implantation.  See Comments of the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops (Mar. 20, 2013) (citing European Medicines Agency, Evaluation of Medicines for Human \nUse: CHMP Assessment for Ellaone (2009)); Comments of the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops (Aug. 31, 2011) (citing A. Tarantal, et al., “Effects of Two Antiprogestins on Early \nPregnancy in the Long-Tailed Macaque (Macaca fascicularis),” 54 Contraception 107-115 (1996), \nat 114 (“studies with mifepristone and HRP 2000 have shown both antiprogestins to have roughly \ncomparable activity in terminating pregnancy when administered during the early stages of \ngestation”); G. Bernagiano & H. von Hertzen, “Towards more effective emergency \ncontraception?”, 375 The Lancet 527-28 (Feb. 13, 2010), at 527 (“Ulipristal has similar biological \neffects to mifepristone, the antiprogestin used in medical abortion”)).   \nThere is no authoritative agency interpretation of the term “abortion” in the context of the \nWeldon Amendment, the Government cites no statutory definition, no medical definition, and no \ncase interpreting the term in that context.   Stedman’s Medical Dictionary, for example, defines \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 5 of 27 PageID #:  888\n \n“abortion” as the “[e]xpulsion from the uterus of an embryo or fetus [before] viability.”  \nSTEDMAN’S MEDICAL DICTIONARY 4 (27th ed. 2000) (emphasis added).  On this \ndefinition, some of the Mandate’s covered services clearly qualify as “abortion.” \nFurther, Defendants’ definition of pregnancy and when an abortion occurs is \ncontradictory with Roman Catholic teaching on the subject:  “Every procedure whose sole \nimmediate effect is the termination of pregnancy before viability is an abortion, which, in its \nmoral context, includes the interval between conception and implantation of the embryo.”  See \nEthical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, 5th Ed. (2009) (emphasis \nadded).    \n6.  Coverage, without cost-sharing, for these services is necessary to increase access \nto such services, and thereby reduce unintended pregnancies (and the negative health outcomes \nthat disproportionately accompany unintended pregnancies) and promote healthy birth spacing. \nSee id. at 102-03, AR at 400-01. \n \nRESPONSE: Disputed and unsupported. The pages of the IOM Report that Defendants \ncite do not support this assertion. The only related  points in these pages are references to (1) \nanother IOM report observing, without citation, that  “[p]rogress in reducing unintended \npregnancies will require not only making contraceptive  methods more available, accessible, and \nacceptable through improved services, but also the  development of new methods that meet \nadditional needs,” see Inst. of Med., Women’s Health  Research: Progress, Pitfalls, and Promise \n(2010), at 147; and (2) two studies that  observed that increased rates of contraceptive use by \nunmarried women and adolescents,  respectively, were associated with decreased rates of \nunintended pregnancies. IOM REP. at 105. Neither the referenced IOM report nor the cited \nstudies discussed coverage of  contraception without cost sharing at all, let alone that coverage \nwithout cost-sharing is necessary for increasing access to these services and thereby reducing the \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 6 of 27 PageID #:  889\n \nrate of unintended pregnancies and promoting healthy birth spacing, or that requiring religious \norganizations to  provide such coverage is a necessary means to either of those ends. \n7.  On August 1, 2011, HRSA adopted guidelines consistent with IOM’s \nrecommendations, encompassing all FDA-approved “contraceptive methods, sterilization \nprocedures, and patient education and counseling,” as prescribed by a health care provider, \nsubject to an exemption relating to certain religious employers authorized by regulations issued \nthat same day (the “2011 amended interim final regulations”). See HRSA, Women’s Preventive \nServices: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines (“HRSA Guidelines”), AR at 283-84. \n \nRESPONSE: Undisputed. \n \n8.  To qualify for the religious employer exemption contained in the 2011 amended \ninterim final regulations, an employer had to meet the following criteria: \n \n(1) The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization; \n(2) the organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of the \norganization; \n(3) the organization serves primarily persons who share the religious tenets of the \norganization; and \n(4) the organization is a nonprofit organization as described in section 6033(a)(1) and \nsection 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. \n \n76 Fed. Reg. 46,621, 46,623 (Aug. 3, 2011), AR at 2201. \n \nRESPONSE:  Undisputed, but this is a provision of law, not a statement of fact. \n \n9.  Group health plans established or maintained by religious employers (and \nassociated group health insurance coverage) are exempt from any requirement to cover \ncontraceptive services consistent with HRSA’s guidelines. See HRSA, Women’s Preventive \nServices: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines (“HRSA Guidelines”), AR at 283-84; 45 \nC.F.R. § 147.131(a). \n \nRESPONSE:  This is a disputed proposition of law, not a statement of fact. Moreover, \nunder the government’s initial interpretation of the “religious employer” exemption, if a \nnonexempt religious organization “provided health coverage for its employees through” a plan \noffered by a separate, “affiliated” organization that was “exempt from the requirement to cover \ncontraceptive services, then neither the [affiliated organization] nor the [nonexempt entity would \n                                                 \n1\n  Plaintiffs do not concede that the Administrative Record is properly before the Court.  To the extent \nDefendants rely on the Administrative Record, references herein by Plaintiffs to the Administrative Record are to \ndemonstrate that it does not support Defendants’ Statement of Facts. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 7 of 27 PageID #:  890\n \nbe] required to offer contraceptive coverage to its employees.” 77 Fed. Reg. 16,501, 16,502 \n(Mar. 21, 2012). But the Final Rules eliminated that safeguard, and now interpret the  exemption \nto require “each employer” to “independently meet the definition of eligible organization or \nreligious employer in order to take advantage of the accommodation or the religious employer \nexemption with respect to its employees and their covered dependents.” 78  Fed. Reg. 39,870, \n39,886; See also 78 Fed. Reg. 8,456, 8,467 (Feb. 6, 2013) (NPRM). Nevertheless, the language \nof 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a) explicitly exempts “group health plan[s] established or maintained by a \nreligious employer (and health insurance  coverage provided in connection with a group health \nplan established or maintained by a  religious employer)” from “any requirement to cover \ncontraceptive services” under the HRSA  guidelines. Id. By its terms, this exemption does not \nsolely exempt the religious  employer; rather, it exempts the entire “group health plan” that the \nreligious employer  “establishe[s] or maintain[s],” id., which in the case of the diocesan plaintiffs \nhere provides  coverage to affiliated religious entities.   \n10.  In February 2012, the government adopted in final regulations the definition of \n“religious employer” contained in the 2011 amended interim final regulations while also creating \na temporary enforcement safe harbor for non-grandfathered group health plans sponsored by \ncertain non-profit organizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage (and any \nassociated group health insurance coverage). See 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8726-27 (Feb. 15, 2012), \nAR at 213-14. \n \nRESPONSE:  Undisputed. \n \n11.  The government committed to undertake a new rulemaking during the safe harbor \nperiod to adopt new regulations to further accommodate non-grandfathered non-profit religious \norganizations’ religious objections to covering contraceptive services. Id. at 8728, AR at 215. \n \nRESPONSE:  Undisputed that the government undertook new rulemaking, but disputed \nthat the new rulemaking in fact accommodated non-grandfathered non-profit religious \norganizations’ religious objections to covering contraceptive services. \n   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 8 of 27 PageID #:  891\n \n12.  The regulations challenged here (the “2013 final rules”) represent the culmination \nof that process. See 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, AR at 1-31; see also 77 Fed. Reg. 16,501 (Mar. 21, \n2012) (Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM)), AR at 186-93; 78 Fed. Reg. 8456 \n(Feb. 6, 2013) (Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)), AR at 165-85. \n \nRESPONSE:  Undisputed, but Plaintiffs incorporate herein their response to Paragraph \n11, supra, with respect to what “that process” is. \n13.  Under the 2013 final rules, a “religious employer” is “an organization that is \norganized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or \n(a)(3)(A)(iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,” which refers to churches, their \nintegrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches, and the exclusively religious \nactivities of any religious order. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). \n \nRESPONSE:  This is an undisputed proposition of law, not a statement of fact. \n \n14.  The 2013 final rules establish accommodations with respect to the contraceptive \ncoverage requirement for group health plans established or maintained by “eligible organizations” \n(and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans). Id. at 39,875-80, \nAR at 7-12; 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b). \n \nRESPONSE: This is a disputed proposition of law, not a statement of material fact. \nWhile defendants purport to have established an “accommodation” regarding contraceptive \ncoverage for certain religious “eligible organizations,” that so-called “accommodation” does not \nresolve Plaintiffs’ religious objections and still requires Plaintiffs to facilitate access to products \nand services the use of which is antithetical to Plaintiffs’ mission and beliefs and the Roman \nCatholic faith. \n15.  An “eligible organization” is an organization that satisfies the following criteria: \n \n(1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any \ncontraceptive  services required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on account \nof religious  objections. \n(2) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity. \n(3) The organization holds itself out as a religious organization. \n(4) The organization self-certifies, in a form and manner specified by the Secretary, that \nit  satisfies the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, and makes such \nself-  certification available for examination upon request by the first day of the first plan \nyear  to which the accommodation in paragraph (c) of this section applies. \n \n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b); see also 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874-75, AR at 6-7. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 9 of 27 PageID #:  892\n \n \nRESPONSE:  This is an undisputed proposition of law, not a statement of material fact. \n \n16.  Under the 2013 final rules, an eligible organization is not required “to contract, \narrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage” to which it has religious objections. 78 Fed. \nReg. at 39,874, AR at 6. \n \nRESPONSE:  This is a disputed proposition of law, not a statement of material fact. \nThe Final Rules compel Plaintiffs to designate a third party administrator as plan administrator \nand claims administrator for the purpose of providing payments for contraceptive services for \nPlaintiffs’ health plan participants. The Final Rules require Plaintiffs to find a third party \nadministrator willing to provide the mandated coverage, contract with that party, and provide a \nself-certification to that party to be eligible for the accommodation. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,879 \n(providing requirements for self-certification and providing that, “[u]pon receipt of  the copy of \nthe self-certification, the third party administer may decide not to enter into, or remain in, a \ncontractual relationship with the eligible organization to provide administrative  services for the \nplan”). Upon locating a willing third party administrator, entering into a contract  with that party, \nand providing the party with the requisite self-certification, “the third party  administrator \nbecomes an ERISA section 3(16) plan administrator and claims administrator  solely for the \npurpose of providing payments for contraceptive services for participants and  beneficiaries in a \nself-insured plan.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,879. “[A] plan administer is  defined in ERISA section \n3(16)(A)(i) as ‘the person specifically so designated by the terms of  the instrument under which \nthe plan is operated.’ . . . [As such, T]he self-certification is one of  the instruments under which \nthe employer’s plan is operated under ERISA section 3(16)(A0(i).”  Id. Accordingly, the Final \nRules require the non-exempt Plaintiffs to find and designate a third  party administrator as plan \nadministrator and claims administrator for the purpose of providing  payments for contraceptive \nservices for Plaintiffs’ health plan participants and to provide the requisite self-certification to the \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 10 of 27 PageID #:  893\n \ndesignated third party administrator in order to facilitate those  payments. Moreover, Plaintiffs’ \nemployees would receive access to the mandated payments only  by virtue of their participation in \nthe health plan Plaintiffs choose to offer. See 29 C.F.R. §  2590.715-2713A(d); 45 C.F.R. § \n147.131(c)(2)(i)(B) (indicating that payments  are available only “so long as” Plaintiffs’ \nemployees remain on Plaintiffs’ insurance plan”). \n17.  To be relieved of any such obligations, the 2013 final rules require only that an \neligible organization complete a self-certification form stating that it is an eligible organization \nand provide a copy of that self-certification to its issuer or third party administrator (TPA). Id. at \n39,878-79, AR at 10-11. \n \nRESPONSE:  This paragraph is argumentative, and is a disputed proposition of law, \nnot a statement of material fact. Plaintiffs incorporate herein their response to Paragraph 16, \nsupra. \n18.  Its participants and beneficiaries, however, will still benefit from separate \npayments for contraceptive services made by the issuer or TPA, without cost sharing or other \ncharge. Id. at 39,874, AR at 6. \n \nRESPONSE:  Disputed. Plaintiffs do not dispute that the 2013 final rules anticipate \nthat health plan participants and beneficiaries will receive separate payments for contraceptive \nservices made by the issuer or TPA without cost sharing or other charge. But Plaintiffs dispute \nthat contraceptive services are a “benefit”; Plaintiffs believe they are immoral. \n19.  In the case of an organization with a self-insured group health plan—such as \nplaintiffs here—the organization’s TPA, upon receipt of the self-certification, must, among other \nthings, provide or arrange separate payments for contraceptive services for participants and \nbeneficiaries in the plan without cost-sharing, premium, fee, or other charge to plan participants \nor beneficiaries, or to the eligible organization or its plan. See id. at 39,879-80, AR at 11-12. \n \nRESPONSE:  This is an incomplete proposition of law, not a statement of material fact. \nPlaintiffs incorporate herein their responses to Paragraph 16, supra and 20, infra. The 2013 final \nrules allow third party administrators to “decide not to enter into, or remain in, a contractual \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 11 of 27 PageID #:  894\n \nrelationship with the eligible organization to provide administrative services for the plan.” 78 \nFed. Reg. at 39,879. \n20.  Any costs incurred by the TPA will be reimbursed through an adjustment to \nFederally-facilitated Exchange (FFE) user fees. See id. at 39,880, AR at 12. \n \nRESPONSE:  Undisputed that the 2013 final rules anticipate that costs incurred by the \nTPA will be reimbursed through an adjustment to the FFE user fees, but disputed that such \nmechanisms will fully compensate TPAs. These fee reductions are to be established through a \nhighly regulated and bureaucratic process for evaluating, approving, and monitoring fees paid in \ncompensation to third-party administrators. Such regulatory regimes invariably fail to fully \ncompensate the regulated entities for the costs and risks incurred. As a result, few if any third- \nparty administrators are likely to participate in this regime, and those that do are likely to  increase \nfees charged to self-insured organizations. \n21.  The government “propose[d] to make the accommodation or the religious \nemployer exemption available on an employer-by-employer basis” in the NPRM. 78 Fed. Reg. \n8456, 8467 (Feb. 6, 2013), AR at 176. \n \nRESPONSE: Undisputed. \n \n22.  The 2013 final rules generally apply to group health plans and health insurance \nissuers for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, see id. at 39,872, AR at 4, except the \namendments to the religious employer exemption apply to group health plans and group health \ninsurance issuers for plan years beginning on or after August 1, 2013, see id. at 39,871, AR at 3. \n \nRESPONSE: This is an undisputed proposition of law, not a statement of material fact. \n \n23.  The regulations specifically prohibit TPAs from charging any premium or \notherwise passing on any costs to eligible organizations with respect to the TPAs’ payments for \ncontraceptive services. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,880, AR at 12. \n \nRESPONSE:  This is an incomplete proposition of law, not a statement of material fact. \n \nThe 2013 final rules allow TPAs to “decide not to enter into, or remain in, a contractual \nrelationship with the eligible organization to provide administrative services for the plan.” 78 \nFed. Reg. at 39,879. Plaintiffs incorporate herein their response to paragraph 20,  supra. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 12 of 27 PageID #:  895\n \n24.   The primary predicted benefit of the preventive services coverage regulations is \nthat “individuals will experience improved health as a result of reduced transmission, prevention \nor delayed onset, and earlier treatment of disease.” 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726, 41,733 (July 19, 2010), \nAR at 233; see also 77 Fed. Reg. at 8728, AR at 215; 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872, 39,887, AR at 4, \n19. \n \nRESPONSE:  This not a statement of fact, but unsupported speculation. Defendants’ \nregulations are not evidence of the fact asserted, namely, that “individuals will experience \nimproved health as a result of reduced transmission, prevention or delayed onset, and earlier \ntreatment of disease.” See Williams v. City of New York, No. 06-CV-6601 (NGG), 2009 WL \n3254465, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 6, 2009) (“On a motion for summary judgment, such conclusory \nassertions [of party’s own testimony] unsupported by admissible evidence are insufficient.”). \nIn addition, contraceptive services, “unlike other mandated ‘preventive services,’ do not \n‘prevent’ disease. Instead, they disrupt the healthy functioning of the human reproductive \nsystem.” See Comments of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (Mar. 20, 2013). \n“Furthermore, various contraceptives are associated with adverse health outcomes,  including an \nincreased risk of such serious conditions as breast cancer, cardiac failure, and  stroke.” Id.  The \npublishers of the Physicians’ Desk Reference warn women of these, and other  “[s]erious, and \npossibly life-threatening, side effects.” Comments of the U.S. Conference of  Catholic Bishops at \n4 (Sept. 17, 2010) (discussing PDR Network, “Oral contraceptives,”  at PDRhealth (2009)). \n25.  “By expanding coverage and eliminating cost sharing for recommended \npreventive services, [the regulations are] expected to increase access to and utilization of these \nservices, which are not used at optimal levels today.” 75 Fed. Reg. at 41,733, AR at 233; see also \n78 Fed. Reg. at 39,873 (“Research [ ] shows that cost sharing can be a significant barrier to \naccess to contraception.” (citation omitted)), AR at 5. \n \nRESPONSE:  Undisputed that the quoted text appears in the 2013 final rules, but the \nstatement itself is disputed, unsupported, and speculative. Defendants’ regulations are not \nevidence of the fact asserted, namely, that “expanding coverage and eliminating cost sharing for \nrecommended preventive services, [will] increase access to and utilization of these services, \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 13 of 27 PageID #:  896\n \nwhich are not used at optimal levels today.” See Williams, 2009 WL 3254465, at *11 (“On a \nmotion for summary judgment, such conclusory assertions [of party’s own testimony] \nunsupported by admissible evidence are insufficient”). \nIn addition, the cited page of the Administrative Record in turn cites a study entitled “A \nComparison of Contraceptive Procurement Pre- and Post-Benefit Change,” which analyzes \nchanges in contraceptive use after the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in California changed its \ncoverage policy to include universal coverage for contraception. See Postlethwaite, D., et al, 76 \nContraception 360 (2007). But, this study provides no support for the government’s  assertion \nthat cost sharing is a barrier to contraception. In any event, the sole purpose of the  study was to \nevaluate whether eliminating cost sharing for contraceptive coverage “would lead  to a change in \nthe mix of contraceptive methods prescribed and purchased by a large health plan  and whether \nthose changes could theoretically result in averting a greater number of unintended  pregnancies.” \nId. Ultimately, the study concluded that removing cost for contraception “may”  result in \nincreased use, not of contraception generally, but of what the study deemed more  effective forms \nof contraception—that is, whether women would switch to a more expensive but  perhaps more \neffective type of contraception if cost were not a concern. Id. \nFurther, Plaintiffs’ sincerely-held Catholic religious beliefs provide that there are no \n“optimal levels” of the use of contraceptive services, as “[t]he Church teaches that . . . artificial \ninterference with life and conception is immoral.”  \n26.  Although a majority of employers cover FDA-approved contraceptives, see IOM \nREP. at 109, AR at 407, many women forgo preventive services because of cost-sharing imposed \nby their health plans, see id. at 19-20, 109, AR at 317-18, 407. \n \nRESPONSE:  Disputed, unsupported, and immaterial. The pages of the IOM Report \nthat Defendants cite do not support this assertion. The only related points in these pages are \nreferences to studies regarding preventive services other than contraceptive services. See IOM \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 14 of 27 PageID #:  897\n \nREP. at 19 (discussing women’s use of preventive care, including cancer screenings,  dental \nexaminations, mammograms, and Pap smears); Id. at 20 (referencing study \nasking women whether they had received a set of recommended preventive screening tests that \ndid not include contraceptive services: blood pressure, cholesterol, cervical cancer, colon cancer \n(for ages 50 to 64) and breast cancer (for ages 50 to 64) screens); Id. at 109 (mentioning research \non preventive and primary care services in general). The one study  mentioned that touches on \ncontraceptive services examined women who were already taking  contraception and the \nlikelihood that they would switch to another method in light of reduced or  eliminated out-of-\npocket costs.  \nIn fact, more than 89 percent of insurance plans “cover[ed] contraceptive methods in \n2002.” IOM REP. at 109. Further, 89% of women trying to avoid pregnancy are already \npracticing contraception. See The Guttmacher Institute, “Fact Sheet: Contraceptive Use  in the \nUnited States,\" (Aug. 2010), available at http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/  fb_contr_use.html. \nAmong the other 11%, lack of access is not a statistically significant  reason why they do not use \ncontraceptives. Mosher WD and Jones J, “Use of contraception in  the United States: 1982–\n2008,” Vital and Health Statistics, 2010, Series 23, No. 29, at 14 and  Table E, available at \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/NCHS/data/series/ sr_23/sr23_029.pdf. Even  among the most at-risk \npopulations, cost is not the reason those women do not use contraceptives. See R. Jones, J. \nDarroch and S.K. Henshaw “Contraceptive Use Among U.S.  Women Having Abortions,” \nPerspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health 34 (Nov/Dec  2002): 294–303 (Perspectives is a \npublication of the Guttmacher Institute); see also  CDC, “Prepregnancy Contraceptive Use \nAmong Teens with Unintended Pregnancies Resulting  in Live Births — Pregnancy Risk \nAssessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), 2004–2008,”  Morbidity and Mortality Weekly \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 15 of 27 PageID #:  898\n \nReport 61(02);25-29 (Jan. 20, 2012), available at \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6102a1.htm?s_cid=mm6102a1_e  (2012 \nCDC study showed that even among those most at risk for unintended pregnancy, only  13% cite \ncost as a reason for not using contraception). \nMoreover, Defendants have admitted that “85 percent of employer-sponsored health \ninsurance plans cover[] preventive services,” and that they do so “without [beneficiaries] having \nto meet a deductible,” 75 Fed. Reg. at 41,732—in other words, without a significant form of cost \nsharing. \n27.  Unintended pregnancies have proven in many cases to have negative health \nconsequences for women and developing fetuses. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872, AR at 4. \n \nRESPONSE:  Disputed and unsupported. Defendants’ regulations are not evidence of \nthe fact asserted. See Williams, 2009 WL 3254465, at *11 (“On a motion for summary judgment, \nsuch conclusory assertions [of party’s own testimony] unsupported by admissible  evidence are \ninsufficient. Plaintiffs incorporate herein their  response to Paragraph 24, supra. \n28.  Unintended pregnancy may delay “entry into prenatal care,” prolong “behaviors \nthat present risks for the developing fetus,” and cause “depression, anxiety, or other conditions.” \nIOM REP. at 20, 103-04, AR at 318, 401-02. \n \nRESPONSE:  Undisputed, but incomplete. Plaintiffs incorporate herein their response \nto Paragraph 24, supra. \n29.  Contraceptive coverage further helps to avoid “the increased risk of adverse \npregnancy outcomes for pregnancies that are too closely spaced.” Id. at 103, AR at 401; see also \n78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872 (“Short interpregnancy intervals in particular have been associated with \nlow birth weight, prematurity, and small-for-gestational age births.”) (citing studies), AR at 4. \n \nRESPONSE:  Disputed and unsupported. The pages of the IOM Report that \nDefendants cite do not support their assertion. Also, Defendants’ regulations are not evidence of \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 16 of 27 PageID #:  899\n \nthe fact asserted. See Williams, 2009 WL 3254465, at *11 (“On a motion for summary judgment, \nsuch conclusory assertions [of party’s own testimony] unsupported by admissible  evidence are \ninsufficient”). \nFurthermore, the quoted text does not bear on whether contraceptive coverage has any \nimpact on the incidence of the referenced negative consequences of short interpregnancy \nintervals. In addition, Plaintiffs incorporate herein their response to Paragraph 24, supra. \n30.  “Contraceptives also have medical benefits for women who are contraindicated \nfor pregnancy, and there are demonstrative preventive health benefits from contraceptives \nrelating to conditions other than pregnancy (for example, prevention of certain cancers,  menstrual \ndisorders, and acne).” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872, AR at 4; see also IOM REP. at 103-04 \n(“[P]regnancy may be contraindicated for women with serious medical conditions such as \npulmonary hypertension . . . and cyanotic heart disease, and for women with the Marfan \nSyndrome.”), AR at 401-02. \n \nRESPONSE:  Undisputed that the quoted text appears in the 2013 final rules, but the \nstatement itself is disputed, unsupported, and immaterial. Defendants’ regulations are not \nevidence of the fact asserted. See Williams, 2009 WL 3254465, at *11 (“On a motion for \nsummary judgment, such conclusory assertions [of party’s own testimony] unsupported by \nadmissible evidence are insufficient”). \nFurthermore, “contraceptive methods have both risks and benefits,” negative \nconsequences of which range from “side effects” to death. IOM REP. at 105-06.  And, “[f]or \nwomen with certain medical conditions or risk factors, some contraceptive methods  may be \ncontraindicated.” Id. at 105. Plaintiffs also incorporate herein their  response to Paragraph 24, \nsupra. \nIn addition, Plaintiffs have no objection to (and this case is not about) the use of \ncontraceptives for non-contraceptive purposes, and Plaintiffs currently cover contraceptives  when \nprescribed for such medically-necessary, non-contraceptive purposes. \n   \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 17 of 27 PageID #:  900\n \n31.  “[W]omen have different health needs than men, and these needs often generate \nadditional costs. Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care \ncosts than men.” 155 Cong. Rec. S12106-02, S12114 (daily ed. Dec. 2, 2009); 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39,887, AR at 19; IOM REP. at 19, AR at 317. \n \nRESPONSE: Undisputed that the quoted text appears in the Congressional Record, but \nthe statement itself is disputed and unsupported. Defendants’ self-serving selection of the \nlegislative history of the statute, individual Congresspersons’ statements, or Defendants’ own \nregulations do not provide evidentiary support for the underlying factual statement. See \nWilliams, 2009 WL 3254465, at *11 (“On a motion for summary judgment, such conclusory \nassertions [of party’s own testimony] unsupported by admissible evidence are insufficient”).  The \nstatement also has no bearing on the utilization of contraceptive services at all.  Likewise, \nDefendants’ citation to the IOM Report provides support only for the general  proposition that \nsome women have significant health care expenses, including paying for  prescriptions for \nthemselves and their families and paying for screening and preventive services  entirely unrelated \nto contraception. See IOM REP. at 19. \n32.  These costs result in women often forgoing preventive care and place women in \nthe workforce at a disadvantage compared to their male coworkers. See, e.g., 155 Cong. Rec. \nS12265-02, S12274 (daily ed. Dec. 3, 2009); 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887, AR at 19; IOM REP. at 20, \nAR at 318. \n \nRESPONSE:  Disputed and unsupported. Defendants’ self-serving selection of the \nlegislative history of the statute, individual Congresspersons’ statements, or Defendants’ \nregulations does not provide evidentiary support for the underlying factual statement. See \nWilliams, 2009 WL 3254465, at *11 (“On a motion for summary judgment, such conclusory \nassertions [of party’s own testimony] unsupported by admissible evidence are insufficient”).  The \nstatement also has no bearing on the utilization of contraceptive services at all.  Additionally, \nDefendants’ citation to the IOM Report provides support only for the general  proposition that \nsome women have difficulty paying medical bills and for screening and  preventive services \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 18 of 27 PageID #:  901\n \nunrelated to contraception, while also noting that women are more likely than  men to be \ndependents on a health care plan, which is irrelevant to their participation in the  workforce. See \nIOM REP. at 20. \n33.  The grandfathering of certain health plans with respect to certain provisions of the \nACA is not specifically limited to the preventive services coverage regulations. See 42 U.S.C. § \n18011; 45 C.F.R. § 147.140. \n \nRESPONSE:  This is an incomplete statement of law, not a statement of material fact. \n \nWhile the grandfathering provisions may not be specifically limited to excluding the ACA’s \npreventive services coverage requirements, Defendants themselves highlighted in the regulations \nthat grandfathered health plans are not subject to the preventive services coverage requirements. \nSpecifically, Defendants’ model disclosure to plan beneficiaries provides that “[b]eing a \ngrandfathered health plan means that your [plan or policy] may not include certain consumer \nprotections of the Affordable Care Act that apply to other plans, for example, the requirement for \nthe provision of preventive health services without any cost sharing.” 45 C.F.R. \n§147.140(a)(2)(ii). In other words, grandfathered health plans are exempt from the  preventive \nservices coverage regulations regardless of whether that is the only provision of the  ACA for \nwhich they can avoid compliance.  \n34.  The effect of grandfathering is not really a permanent “exemption,” but rather, \nover the long term, a transition in the marketplace with respect to several provisions of the ACA, \nincluding the preventive services coverage provision. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887 n.49. \n \nRESPONSE:  Disputed, unsupported, and speculative. Defendants’ regulations are not \nevidence of the fact asserted. See Williams, 2009 WL 3254465, at *11 (“On a motion for \nsummary judgment, such conclusory assertions [of party’s own testimony] unsupported by \nadmissible evidence are insufficient”). \nAt any rate, Defendants have acknowledged in their own regulations that grandfathered \nhealth plans are “exempt” from provisions of the ACA, including the preventive services \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 19 of 27 PageID #:  902\n \ncoverage provision. See, e.g., 75 Fed. Reg. 70,114, 70,117 (Nov. 15, 2010) (“Because \ngrandfathered health plans are exempt from many of [the provisions of the Affordable Care Act] \nwhile group health plans and group and individual health insurance coverage that are not \ngrandfathered health plans must comply with them, it was critical for plans and issuers to receive \nclear guidance as to whether they were so exempt as soon as possible”); 75 Fed. Reg. 34,538, \n34,545 (June 17, 2010) (“Grandfathered health plans are exempt from many of these provisions \nwhile group health plans and group and individual health insurance coverage that are  not \ngrandfathered health plans must comply with them.”); HHS, Grandfathered Plans, available  at \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/insurance/grandfather/ (“The Affordable Care Act  exempts most \nplans that existed on March 23, 2010 — the day the law was enacted — from some of the law’s \nconsumer protections.”). \nIn addition, the predicted “majority of group health plans [that] will lose their \ngrandfathered status by the end of 2013” is a bare majority, leaving 49% still possessing \ngrandfathered status. 75 Fed. Reg. at 34,553. Defendants’ data further estimates that a majority \nof “large employer” group health plans will still possess grandfathered status by the end of 2013. \nId. Because 49% of total group health plans and 55% of large employer group health plans are \npredicted to maintain grandfathered status through the end of 2013, and because twice as many \npeople are in large group health plans as are in small ones, Defendants’ data predicts that a \nmajority of total persons covered by group health plans (large and small) will be in grandfathered \nhealth plans through the end of 2013. 75 Fed. Reg. at 34,550, 34,553. And, as Defendants’ own \nestimates acknowledge, “[m]ost of the 133 million Americans with employer-sponsored health \ninsurance through large employers will maintain the coverage they have today,” i.e., will retain \ngrandfathered health coverage. HHS, U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 20 of 27 PageID #:  903\n \nand Treasury Issue Regulation on “Grandfathered” Health Plans under the Affordable Care  \nAct, available at http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/06/20100614e.html (June 14, 2010) \n(“June 14, 2010 Press Release”). \nFurther, the grandfathering exclusion has no sunset provision; a health plan has a “right” \nto keep its grandfathered status. 75 Fed. Reg. at 34,540, 34,558, 34,562, 34,566. A health plan \ncan maintain its grandfathered status indefinitely while increasing costs to employees  if it stays \nwithin the parameters of Defendants’ regulations for grandfathered plans. 75 Fed. Reg.  at \n34,538. Indeed, Defendants’ assertion contradicts the President’s promise that “if you  like your \nplan, you can keep it.” See June 14, 2010 Press Release. \n35.  A majority of group health plans will have lost their grandfather status by the end \nof 2013. See id. at 34,552; see also Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research & \nEducational Trust, Employer Health Benefits 2012 Annual Survey at 7-8, 190 (indicating that 58 \npercent of firms had at least one grandfathered health plan in 2012, down from 72 percent in \n2011, and that 48 percent of covered workers were in grandfathered health plans in 2012, down \nfrom 56 percent in 2011), AR at 663-64, 846. \n \nRESPONSE:  Disputed and unsupported. Plaintiffs incorporate herein their response to \nParagraph 34, supra. \n36.  26 U.S.C. § 4980H(c)(2) does not exempt small employers from the preventive \nservices coverage regulations. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a); 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887 n.49, AR at \n19. \n \nRESPONSE: This is a disputed proposition of law, not a statement of material fact. \n \nWhile small employers are technically required to provide coverage for recommended preventive \nservices, Defendants have permanently exempted them from some of the Mandate’s enforcement \nmechanisms. See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. §§ 4980H(a), 4980H(c)(2)(A). These small employer plans \ncover about 20 to 40 million employees and dependents. See U.S. Census Bureau, Employment \nSize of Firms, www.census.gov/econ/smallbus.html. \n   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 21 of 27 PageID #:  904\n \n37.  Instead, it excludes employers with fewer than fifty full-time equivalent \nemployees from the employer responsibility provision, meaning that, starting in 2015, such \nemployers are not subject to the possibility of assessable payments if they do not provide health \ncoverage to their full-time employees and their dependents. See 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(c)(2). \n \nRESPONSE:  This is a disputed proposition of law, not a statement of material fact.  \nPlaintiffs incorporate herein their response to Paragraph 36, supra. \n38.  Small businesses that do offer non-grandfathered health coverage to their \nemployees are required to provide coverage for recommended preventive services, including \ncontraceptive services, without cost-sharing. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887 n.49, AR at 19. \n \nRESPONSE:  This is an incomplete statement of a proposition of law, not a statement \nof material fact. While small employers are technically required to provide coverage for \nrecommended preventive services, Defendants have permanently exempted them from some of \nthe Mandate’s enforcement mechanisms. See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. §§ 4980H(a), 4980H(c)(2)(A). \nThese small employer plans cover about 20 to 40 million employees and dependents. See \nU.S. Census Bureau, Employment Size of Firms, www.census.gov/econ/smallbus.html. \n \n39.   The only exemption from the preventive services coverage regulations is the \nexemption for the group health plans of religious employers. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). \n \nRESPONSE:  This is a disputed proposition of law, not a statement of material fact. \nAs  set forth in Plaintiffs’ responses to Paragraphs 34 and 36, incorporated herein, grandfathered \nhealth plans are exempt from the preventive service coverage requirements of the ACA, and \nsmall employers are exempt from some of the Mandate’s enforcement mechanisms. \n40.  Houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive \ncoverage on religious grounds are more likely than other employers to employ people of the  same \nfaith who share the same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than other  people to \nuse contraceptive services even if such services were covered under their plan. See 78  Fed. Reg. \nat 39,874, AR at 6. \n \nRESPONSE:  Disputed and unsupported. Defendants’ regulations are not evidence of \nthe fact asserted, and this statement is pure speculation. See Williams, 2009 WL 3254465, at *11 \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 22 of 27 PageID #:  905\n \n(“On a motion for summary judgment, such conclusory assertions [of party’s own testimony] \nunsupported by admissible evidence are insufficient”). \nIn addition, HHS has acknowledged that there is no evidentiary basis for the conclusion \nthat individuals who work for entities like ArchCare and Catholic Health Services of Long Island \nare more likely not to object to the use of contraceptives and therefore are more likely to use \ncontraceptives. See Cohen Dep. at 34:9-24 (“Q. . .What was the evidentiary basis for the \nconclusion that individuals who work for entities like ArchCare and Catholic Health Services of \nLong Island are more likely not to object to the use of contraceptives and therefore are more \nlikely to use contraceptives? A. I think that conclusion was based on just logic and common  \nsense on the one hand and, secondly, on the evidence that a very large majority -- I've seen \nfigures up to 95 percent of sexually active women in the United States use contraceptives at one \npoint or another. Q. So there was no evidence particular to those types of institutions? A. No, I \ndon't believe so.”). \n41.   Congress did not adopt a single (government) payer system financed through \ntaxes and instead opted to build on the existing system of employment-based coverage. See H.R. \nRep. No. 111-443, pt. II, at 984-86 (2010). \n \nRESPONSE:  Undisputed. \n \n42.  Defendants are constrained by statute from adopting the alternative administrative \nschemes proposed by plaintiffs. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20. \n \nRESPONSE:  This is a disputed proposition of law, not a statement of material fact. \n \nDefendants’ regulations are also not evidence of the fact asserted. See Williams, 2009 WL \n3254465, at *11 (“On a motion for summary judgment, such conclusory assertions [of party’s \nown testimony] unsupported by admissible evidence are insufficient”). \n43.  Plaintiffs’ proposed alternatives are not feasible because they would impose \nconsiderable new costs and other burdens on the government and would otherwise be \nimpractical. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20. \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 23 of 27 PageID #:  906\n \nRESPONSE:  This is disputed proposition of law, not a statement of material fact. \n \nDefendants’ regulations are not evidence of the fact asserted. See Williams, 2009 WL 3254465, \nat *11 (“On a motion for summary judgment, such conclusory assertions [of party’s own \ntestimony] unsupported by admissible evidence are insufficient”). \n44.  Nor would the proposed alternatives be equally effective in advancing the \ngovernment’s compelling interests. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20. \n \nRESPONSE:  This is a disputed proposition of law, not a statement of material fact. \n \nDefendants’ regulations are also not evidence of the fact asserted. See Williams, 2009 WL \n3254465, at *11 (“On a motion for summary judgment, such conclusory assertions [of party’s \nown testimony] unsupported by admissible evidence are insufficient”). \n45.  Plaintiffs’  alternatives  would  require  establishing  entirely  new  government \nprograms  and  infrastructures  or  fundamentally  altering  an  existing  one,  and  would  require \nwomen to take burdensome steps to find out about the availability of and sign up for a new \nbenefit, thereby ensuring that fewer women would take advantage of it. See 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39,888, AR at 20. \n \nRESPONSE:  This is argumentative and a disputed proposition of law, not a statement \nof material fact. Defendants’ regulations are also not evidence of the fact asserted. See  Williams, \n2009 WL 3254465, at *11 (“On a motion for summary judgment, such conclusory assertions [of \nparty’s own testimony] unsupported by admissible evidence are insufficient”) \n46.  “Nothing in the[] final regulations prohibits an eligible organization from \nexpressing its opposition to the use of contraception.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,880 n.41, AR at 12. \n \nRESPONSE:  This is a disputed proposition of law, not a statement of material fact. \n \nDefendants’ regulations are also not evidence of the fact asserted. See Williams, 2009 WL \n3254465, at *11 (“On a motion for summary judgment, such conclusory assertions [of party’s \nown testimony] unsupported by admissible evidence are insufficient”). \nFurther, the regulations broadly prohibit religious organizations from “directly or \nindirectly, seek[ing] to influence the[ir] third party administrator’s decision” to provide or \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 24 of 27 PageID #:  907\n \nprocure contraceptive services, 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815–2713A, thus limiting the means by which \nPlaintiffs may express their opposition to the use of contraception. Moreover, Plaintiffs  express \ntheir religious opposition to the use of contraception, in part, through the manner in  which they \nhave established health care coverage for their employees, which currently prohibits  the use of \ncontraceptive services consistent with plaintiffs’ faith.  \n47.  The regulations only prohibit an employer’s improper attempt to interfere with its \nemployees’ ability to obtain contraceptive coverage from a third party by, for example, \nthreatening the TPA with a termination of its relationship with the employer because of the \nTPA’s “arrangements to provide or arrange separate payments for contraceptive services for \nparticipants or beneficiaries.” See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(b)(1)(iii); 29 C.F.R. § 2950.715- \n2713A(b)(1)(iii). \n \nRESPONSE:  This is argumentative and a disputed proposition of law, not a statement \nof material fact. Plaintiffs incorporate herein their response to Paragraph 46, infra. \n48.   The Women’s Health Amendment, which contained the requirement to provide \ncoverage for recommended preventive services for women without cost-sharing, was intended to \nfill significant gaps relating to women’s health that existed in the other preventive care \nguidelines identified in the Affordable Care Act.  See 155 Cong. Rec. S12021-02, S12025 (daily \ned. Dec. 1, 2009) (statement of Sen. Boxer); 155 Cong. Rec. S12265-02, S12271 (daily ed. Dec. \n3, 2009) (statement of Sen. Franken). \n \nRESPONSE:  This is argumentative and a disputed restatement of the law, and not a \nstatement  of material fact. Plaintiffs incorporate herein their response to Paragraph 46, infra. \n49.  The Weldon Amendment denies funds made available in the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2012 to any federal, state, or local agency, program, or government that \n“subjects any institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the basis that the \nhealth care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.” Pub. L. \nNo. 112-74, §§ 506, 507, 125 Stat. 786, 1111-12 (Dec. 23, 2011). \n \nRESPONSE:  This is an incomplete statement of a proposition of law, not a statement \nof material fact. The Weldon Amendment defines the term “health care entity” to include “a \nhealth insurance plan.” See Pub. L. No. 112-74, § 507(d)(2) (2011). \n   \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 25 of 27 PageID #:  908\n \n50.  “Abortifacient drugs are not included” in the preventive services covered by the \nregulations. HealthCare.gov, Affordable Care Act Rules on Expanding Access to Preventive \nregulations. HealthCare.gov, Affordable Care Act Rules on Expanding Access to Preventive \nServices for Women (August 1, 2011), available at \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/factsheets/2011/08/womensprevention08012011a.html (last \nvisited Sept. 23, 2013); see also IOM REP. at 22 (recognizing that abortion services are outside \nthe scope of recommendations), AR at 320. \n \nRESPONSE: Disputed as stated in Plaintiffs’ response incorporated herein, emergency \ncontraceptives (such as Plan B and Ella) can also act as  abortifacients. \n51.  The list of FDA-approved contraceptives includes emergency contraceptives such \nas Plan B. See IOM REP. at 105, AR at 403. \n \n \nRESPONSE:  Undisputed that the list of FDA-approved contraceptive includes \nemergency contraceptives such as Plan B, but, as stated in Plaintiffs’ response herein, emergency \ncontraceptives (such as Plan B and Ella) can also act as  abortifacients. \n52.  The basis for the inclusion of such drugs among safe and effective means of \ncontraception dates back to 1997, when the FDA first explained why Plan B and similar drugs  act \nas contraceptives rather than abortifacients. See Prescription Drug Products; Certain  Combined \nOral Contra for Use as Postcoital Emergency Contraception, 62 Fed. Reg. 8610, 8611  (Feb. 25, \n1997) (noting that “emergency contraceptive pills are not effective if the woman is pregnant” and \nthat there is “no evidence that [emergency contraception] will have an adverse  effect on an \nestablished pregnancy”); 45 C.F.R. § 46.202(f) (“Pregnancy encompasses the period  of time \nfrom implantation until delivery.”). \n \nRESPONSE:  Disputed and unsupported. The cited regulation does not support this \nassertion. Namely, it does not describe “[t]he basis for the inclusion of [emergency \ncontraceptives] among safe and effective means of contraception.” In addition, Defendants’ \nregulations are not evidence of the fact asserted. See Williams, 2009 WL 3254465, at *11 (“On a \nmotion for summary judgment, such conclusory assertions [of party’s own testimony] \nunsupported by admissible evidence are insufficient”).  Plaintiffs  incorporate herein their \nresponse to paragraph 5, infra. \n53.  In light of this conclusion by the FDA, HHS informed Title X grantees, which are \nrequired to offer a range of acceptable and effective family planning methods—and, except  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 22   Filed 12/29/13   Page 26 of 27 PageID #:  909\n \nunder limited circumstances, may not offer abortion—that they “should consider the availability \nof emergency contraception the same as any other method which has been established as safe  \nand effective.” Office of Population Affairs, Memorandum (Apr. 23, 1997), \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/opa/pdfs/opa-97-02.pdf (last visited [INSERT], 2013) [sic]; see also 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 300, 300a-6. \n \nRESPONSE:  Undisputed that the HHS so informed Title X grantees, but the truth of \nthe underlying assertions is disputed. Plaintiffs incorporate herein their response to paragraph 5, \ninfra. \n54.  Representative Weldon, the sponsor of the Weldon Amendment, did not consider \nthe word “abortion” in the statute to include FDA-approved emergency contraceptives. See 148 \nCong. Rec. H6566, H6580 (daily ed. Sept. 25, 2002) (“The provision of contraceptive services \nhas never been defined as abortion in Federal statute, nor has emergency contraception, what has \ncommonly been interpreted as the morning-after pill. . . . [U]nder the current FDA policy[,] that \nis considered contraception, and it is not affected at all by this statute.”). \n \nRESPONSE:  Disputed and unsupported. Defendants’ self-serving selection of the \nlegislative history of the statute or individual Congresspersons’ statements does not provide \nevidentiary support for the underlying factual statement. “What motivate[d] one legislator to \nmake a speech about a statute [in 2002] is not necessarily what motivate[d] scores of others to \nenact it” in 2012. United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 384 (1968); see also Barnhart v. \nSigmon Coal Co., Inc., 534 U.S. 438, 457 n.15 (2002) (rejecting reliance on floor statements); \nsee also Williams, 2009 WL 3254465, at *11 (“On a motion for summary judgment, such \nconclusory assertions [of party’s own testimony] unsupported by admissible evidence are \ninsufficient”).

As set forth more fully in below: (1) the \nPlaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed on the merits of its claims; (2) the Plaintiffs face a \nsubstantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not issued, (3) the threatened injury if \nthe injunction is denied outweighs any harm that will result if the injunction is granted, and (4) \ngranting the injunction will not disserve the public interest. Clark v. Prichard, 812 F.2d 991, 993 \n(5th Cir.1987); Canal Author. v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 572 (5th Cir.1974) (en banc ). \nPlaintiffs are willing to post a bond in the amount the court deems appropriate, if the \nCourt deems necessary.  \n  For the reasons described herein, Plaintiffs request that a preliminary injunction follow \nthe issuance of the temporary restraining order prohibiting Defendants, during the pendency of \nthis litigation, from enforcing the U.S. Government Mandate against the Diocese and Catholic \nCharities. \nINTRODUCTION \nThis very month, in granting an injunction for the Diocese of Pittsburg, Catholic Charities of \nPittsburg and others on virtually identical grounds asserted by Plaintiffs here, a Pennsylvania \nfederal court noted that the government’s legal strategy in these Mandate cases is to trivialize \nCatholics’ sincerely-held beliefs: \nDespite  [conceding  plaintiffs’  beliefs  are  sincerely-held],  the \nGovernment  trivializes  these  sincerely-held  beliefs  of  Plaintiffs \nthroughout its Brief in  Opposition, to wit, the “accommodation”: \n(1) “requires virtually nothing of  Plaintiffs”; (2) “certainly does \nnot require Plaintiffs to modify their behavior in  any meaningful \nway”; (3) is “no more than a de minimis burden”; (4) requires \nPlaintiffs to “do next to nothing”; and (5) Plaintiffs “need only \nfulfill  the  self-  certification  requirement  and  provide  the \ncompleted self-certification to their  issuers and TPAs.” \n \nZubik v. Sebelius, 13-CV-1459, 2013 WL 6118696, at *31 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 21, 2013), attached at \nSupp. Appx. at 63-64 (citations omitted).  \n  -2-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 3 of 47 PageID #:  56\nAs the  Pennsylvania  court noted, the government myopically focuses on the cost-free \nnature of the contraceptive services and the ease by which a form can be signed, while ignoring \n“the  incalculable cost of the loss of [Plaintiffs’] rights to freely exercise their religion.” Id.  As \nshown  in  this  combined  motion  and  brief,  the  government’s  short-sighted  rhetoric  does  a \ndisservice not only to Plaintiffs’  sincerely held beliefs, but to this country’s jurisprudence on \nreligious freedom. \nPlaintiffs, as part of the Roman Catholic Church, believe that life begins at conception \nand  that  artificial  interference  with  life  and  conception  is  immoral.  Accordingly,  Plaintiffs \nbelieve that they may not provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to abortion, sterilization, or \nartificial contraception.  The Government has promulgated regulations that coerce Plaintiffs to \nviolate this sincerely held religious belief by requiring them, under threat of punitive fines and \nother  negative  consequences,  to  facilitate  access  to  abortion-inducing  products,  artificial \ncontraception, sterilization procedures, and related counseling. See 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) \n(“Mandate”).  Despite  repeated  pleas  from  the  religious  community,  the  Mandate  narrowly \ndefines “religious employers” as “houses of worship and religious orders,” excluding Catholic \ncharitable,  health,  elder  care,  childcare,  and  other  ministries,  including  Plaintiffs  Catholic \nCharities. \nMore  specifically,  the  Mandate  divides  the  Catholic  Church  into  two  wings:  (1)  a \n“religious” wing limited to “houses of worship and religious orders” that provide religious \nservices; and (2) a “charitable” wing that provides what the Government views as secular \nservices.  But this artificial distinction ignores the reality that many entities in the Catholic \nChurch  engage  in  charity  as  an  exercise  of  religion.    By  excluding  Catholic  charitable \n  -3-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 4 of 47 PageID #:  57\norganizations  from  the  category  of  exempt  “religious  employers,”  the  Mandate  forces  a \nsubstantial wing of the Church to act in contravention of its sincerely held religious beliefs. \nThe Government claims that its recent revisions to the Mandate address the concerns of \nreligious organizations.  They most emphatically do not.  Indeed, the Government knew these \nrevisions  would  not  resolve  Plaintiffs’  concerns,  because  Plaintiffs  and  other  religious \norganizations  repeatedly  informed  the  Government  that  the  now  codified  proposals  were \ninadequate.  Like its predecessors, this iteration of the Mandate narrowly defines “religious \nemployers”  so  as  to  exclude  Catholic  charitable  and  educational  organizations,  including \nPlaintiffs Catholic Charities. \nThe Mandate’s so-called “accommodation” for “non-religious employers,” moreover, is \nillusory because it addresses fundamental religious objections through accounting gimmicks. \nAs a result, Plaintiffs remain the vehicle through which the objectionable products and services \nare  delivered  to  their  employees.  Indeed,  the  Final  Rule  is  significantly  worse  than  the \nGovernment’s original rule because it eliminates an important prior protection that allowed \n“religious employers” (i.e., the Diocese) to shield its affiliated religious  organization (i.e., \nCatholic Charities) from operation  of the Mandate by including such organizations in the \ninsurance plan of the “religious employer.”  Now, although the Diocese is exempt from the \nMandate, the ministries that share its plans—through Catholic Charities—are not exempt. The \nFinal Rule, therefore, actually increases the number of religious organizations, subject to the \nMandate. \nThis oppressive Mandate is irreconcilable with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \n(“RFRA”), the First Amendment, and other federal law.  First, under RFRA, the Government \nmay not impose a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion without showing that it is \n  -4-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 5 of 47 PageID #:  58\nthe  least  restrictive  means  to  advance  a  compelling  governmental  interest.  See  42  U.S.C.§ \n2000bb-1(a), (b).  The Government has excluded tens of millions from the Mandate through a \nseries of exemptions; thus, it cannot show a compelling interest in forcing the Mandate on the \nmuch smaller band of employers that seek an exemption on the basis of religious hardship. Nor \nis the Mandate narrowly tailored because the Government could easily advance its goals without \nusing Plaintiffs to deliver objectionable products and services to Plaintiffs’ employees. \nSecond, the Mandate violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech and Religion Clauses.  \nIt infringes on Plaintiffs’ freedom of speech by requiring them to facilitate “counseling” in favor \nof abortion, contraception, and sterilization.  It violates the Free Exercise Clause by targeting \nPlaintiffs’ religious practices, offering a multitude of exemptions to other employers for non- \nreligious reasons, but denying any exemption that would relieve Plaintiffs’ religious hardship. It \nviolates the Establishment Clause by creating a state-favored category of “religious employers” \nbased on intrusive judgments about their religious practices, beliefs, and organizational structure. \nAnd, it violates the First Amendment’s protection of internal church governance by splitting the \nCatholic Church in two and denying “religious employer” status to those entities carrying out the \nChurch’s religious mission through charitable, health care, childcare, and education ministries. \nIn  sum,  there  is  no  legal  justification  for  the  Government’s  gratuitous  intrusion  on \nPlaintiffs’ religious freedom.  Plaintiffs urgently need injunctive relief now, without which they \nwill be forced to decide between  violating their religious beliefs or violating the law—the \nepitome of irreparable harm.  By contrast, a preliminary injunction will impose no substantial \nharm on the Government, which has refrained from mandating contraceptive coverage for more \nthan  two  centuries.    Accordingly,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request  a  preliminary  injunction  to \npreserve the status quo while this Court adjudicates this vital question of religious liberty. \n  -5-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 6 of 47 PageID #:  59\nBACKGROUND \n \nI.  STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND \n \nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 \n(2010) (the “Act”) requires employer “group health plan[s]” to include insurance coverage for \nwomen’s “preventive care and screenings,” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4), which has been defined \nby the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to include “[a]ll Food and Drug \nAdministration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education \nand  counseling  for  all  women  with  reproductive  capacity.”  Women’s  Preventive  Services \nGuidelines (Ex. A).  FDA-approved contraceptives include the morning-after pill (Plan B) and \nUlipristal (HRP 2000 or Ella), which can induce an abortion. Failure to provide these services \nexposes  Plaintiffs  to  fines  of  $100/day  per  affected  beneficiary.   26   U.S.C.  § 4980D (b).  \nDropping health plans subjects Plaintiffs to substantial annual penalties of $2,000 per employee \nover 30 employees. Id. § 4980H(a), (c)(1). \nFrom its inception, the Act exempted health plans covering millions of people.  See \nWhiteHouse.Gov, “The Affordable Care Act Increases Choice and Saving Money for Small \nBusinesses” (Ex. B) at 1 (“exempt[ing] 96[%] of all firms . . . or 5.8 million out of 6 million total \nfirms”);  Id.  §§  4980D(d);  4980H(a).  Plans  that  have  not  changed  certain  benefits  or \ncontributions are “grandfathered” and exempt.  See 42 U.S.C. § 18011; 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815- \n1251T(g)(1)(v). By one estimate, the Act exempts “over 190 million health plan participants and \nbeneficiaries.” Newland v. Sebelius, 881 F. Supp. 2d 1287, 1298 (D. Colo. 2012). \nFrom the start, however, the Government refused to exempt religious entities other than \nthose satisfying its narrow definition of “religious employer”—intended to “accommodate” only \n  -6-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 7 of 47 PageID #:  60\n“the unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial positions.” \n76 Fed. Reg. 46,621, 46,623 (Aug. 3, 2011). Despite intense criticism, the Government finalized \nthe narrow definition “without change.” 77 Fed. Reg. 8,725, 8,727–28, 8,730 (Feb. 15, 2012). \nFive weeks later, under increased pressure, the Government issued an Advanced Notice \nof Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPRM”), suggesting accommodations to religious objections, yet \nreaffirming that the “religious employer” exemption would not change.  77 Fed. Reg. 16,501, \n16,501–08 (Mar. 21, 2012). Religious entities explained in detail why proposals in the ANPRM \nwould not relieve the burden on their religious freedom. See, e.g., Comments of U.S. Conf. of \nCatholic Bishops (May 15, 2012) (Ex. C) at 3 (“[The ANPRM] create[s] an appearance of \nmoderation and compromise, [but does] not actually offer any change in the Administration’s \nearlier stated positions on mandated contraceptive coverage.”).  Yet, on February 1, 2013, the \nGovernment  issued  a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  (“NPRM”)  adopting  the  ANPRM’s \nproposals.  The NPRM was opposed in over 400,000 comments, largely reiterating previous \nobjections. See, e.g., Comments of U.S. Conf. of Catholic Bishops (Mar. 20, 2013) (Ex. D) at 3 \n(noting  that  religious  entities  are  still  required  “to  fund  or  otherwise  facilitate  the  morally \nobjectionable coverage”). \nIgnoring opposition, the Final Rule adopted substantially all of the NPRM’s proposals \nwithout significant change.  See 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, 39,899 (July 2, 2013) (“Final Rule”).  \nThus, the Mandate will be in effect for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. The \nFinal Rule’s three changes to the Mandate fail to relieve the unlawful burdens imposed on \nPlaintiffs, and one change significantly increases the number of religious organizations subject to \nthe Mandate. \n  -7-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 8 of 47 PageID #:  61\nFirst,  the  Final  Rule  made  a  cosmetic  change  to  the  original  “religious  employer” \nexemption by replacing the first three prongs of the “religious employer” definition with “an \norganization that is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred to in section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.”  78 Fed. Reg. \n39,870, 39,896 (July 2, 2013) (codified at 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a)). The Government admits that \nthis change does “not expand the universe of employer plans that qualify for the exemption \nbeyond that which was intended in the 2012 final regulations,” but “restrict[s] the exemption \nprimarily to group health plans established or maintained by churches, synagogues, mosques, \nand other houses of worship, and religious orders.”  78 Fed. Reg. 8,456, 8,461 (Feb. 6, 2013). \nThus, the Final Rule mirrors the original definition’s focus on “the unique relationship \nbetween a house of worship and its employees in ministerial positions.” 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621, \n46,623  (Aug.  3,  2011).  Religious  entities  with  broader  missions  are  still  not  considered \n“religious employers.” \nSecond, the Final Rule increases the burden imposed on religious entities by expanding \nthe number that are subject to the Mandate. Under the original “religious employer” definition, \nif a nonexempt religious entity provided health coverage to its employees through a plan offered \nby a separate but affiliated entity that was exempt, “then neither the [affiliated organization] nor \nthe [nonexempt entity would be] required to offer contraceptive coverage to its employees.” 77 \nFed.  Reg.  at  16,502.  For  example,  Plaintiff  Diocese  operates  a  plan  that  covers  its  own \nemployees as well as those of Plaintiff Catholic Charities. Under the original religious employer \ndefinition, if the Diocese was an exempt “religious employer,” then Catholic Charities received \nthe benefit of that exemption.  But the Final Rule eliminates that protection, providing instead \nthat “each employer [must] independently meet the definition of religious employer . . . in order \n  -8-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 9 of 47 PageID #:  62\nto avail itself of the exemption.”  78 Fed.  Reg. at 39,886; see also 78 Fed. Reg. at 8,467 \n(NPRM). As a result, the Diocese is foregoing cost savings and premium increases to maintain \nthe grandfathered status of one of its healthcare  plans that protects its non-exempt affiliated \nentities from the Mandate.1 \nThird, the Final Rule establishes an illusory “accommodation” for nonexempt objecting \nreligious  entities  that  qualify  as  “eligible  organizations.”    To  qualify  as  an  “eligible \norganization,” a religious entity must (1) “oppose[] providing coverage for some or all of [the] \ncontraceptive services”; (2) be organized and operate[] as a non-profit entity”; (3) “hold[] itself \nout as a religious organization”; (4) self-certify that it meets the first three criteria; and (5) provide \neither to its insurance company or, if self-insured, to its third party administrator. 26 C.F.R. \n§54.9815-2713A(a), (b).    An eligible organization’s self-certification requires the insurance \nissuer or third party administrator to provide “payments for contraceptive services” for the \nobjecting  organization’s  employees.    See  78  Fed.  Reg.  at  39,895 ( codified  at  26 C .F.R.  § \n54.9815-2713A(a)-(c)).    This  “accommodation”  fails  to  relieve  the  burden  on r eligious \norganizations” religious beliefs because a non-exempt religious organization’s decision to offer a \ngroup health plan still results in the provision of coverage – now in the form of “payments” – for \nabortion-inducing products, contraception, sterilization, and related counseling.  Id.  § 54.9815-\n2713A(a)-(c).   P laintiffs’  provision  of  a  group  health  plan  triggers  the  provision  of  “free” \nobjectionable products and services to their employees in a manner contrary to their beliefs. \nIn sum, the Final Rule does not address Plaintiffs’ religious objections to facilitating \naccess to the objectionable products and services.  This should not surprise the Government, \n                                                 \n1 Other options are to (1) provide Catholic Charities employees with access to “free” objectionable products \nand services; or (2) expel Catholic Charities from the plan, subjecting them it to massive fines if it does not \ncontract with an insurer that will provide the objectionable coverage.  Decl. ¶ 27-40. \n \n  -9-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 10 of 47 PageID #:  63\nwhich was repeatedly notified well before it issued the Final Rule that its “accommodation” \nwould not relieve the burden on Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs. Despite representations that it was \nmaking a good-faith effort to address those religious objections—including before this very \nCourt in a previously filed case by some of the same Plaintiffs2—the Government issued the \nFinal Rule that it knew would do no such thing.  Plaintiffs are still coerced, under threat of \ncrippling fines and other negative consequences, into being the vehicle to deliver contraception, \nabortion-inducing products, sterilization, and related counseling to their employees, contrary to \ntheir sincerely held religious beliefs. \nI.  PLAINTIFF’S BACKGROUND \n \nPlaintiffs are part of the Catholic Church and, as such, sincerely believe that they have a \nreligious duty to provide educational, spiritual, health, and charitable services to individuals of \nall faiths. Just as sincerely, they believe that life begins at the moment of conception, and that \n“preventive”  services  covered  by  the  Mandate  that  interfere  with  life  and  conception  are \nimmoral.  See  Guillory  Decl.  ¶¶  12-14;  Fernandez  Decl.  ¶  4-5, 10-11, 13-15.  Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs believe that they may not provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to contraception, \nsterilization, abortion, or related counseling, including by contracting with a third party that will, \nas a result, provide or procure the objectionable products and services for Plaintiffs’ employees. \nSee Guillory Decl. ¶¶ 15-26; Fernandez Decl. ¶¶ 16-24. \n                                                 \n2 Catholic Diocese of Nashville v. Sebelius, No. 3-12-0934, 2012 WL 5879796, at *4 (M.D. Tenn. Nov. 21, \n2012) (dismissing action for lack of standing because “Defendants announced their intention to develop \nalternative means of providing contraceptive services free of charge to employees of non-exempt, non-\ngrandfathered organizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage” and “published their plan \nto  amend  the  Rules  to  address  the  exact  concerns  Plaintiffs  raise  in  this  action”;  noting  that  “the \nGovernment’s actions are entitled to a good faith presumption”). \n \n  -10-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 11 of 47 PageID #:  64\nIt is a cruel irony that the Mandate—promulgated under a statute that was intended, at \nleast in part, to help the poor and needy—imposes on Plaintiffs the impossible choice of either \nabandoning their religious principles or else violating the law and facing crippling penalties. For \nexample, Catholic Charities provides critical services to the most vulnerable in the community, \nmay be forced to limit these critical services if it were to incur the Mandate’s draconian fines. \nSee Guillory Decl. ¶¶ 10, 20, 28-29; Fernandez Decl. ¶¶ 5-6, 18-20. That is money that could \nhave otherwise supported those entities’ charitable programs and services. \nARGUMENT \nA court should grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction if, after \nconsidering four factors, it determines that the balance of equities favors such relief. See In re \nEagle-Picher Indus., Inc., 963 F.2d 855, 858 (6th Cir. 1992).  The four factors courts should \nconsider are: \n(1) the plaintiff’s likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether \nthe plaintiff may suffer irreparable harm absent the injunction; (3) \nwhether  granting  the  injunction  will  cause  substantial  harm  to \nothers; and (4) the impact of an injunction upon the public interest. \n \nDeja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., 274 F.3d 377, 400 (6th \nCir.  2001);  Int’l  Res.  v.  N.Y.  Life  Ins.  Co.,  950  F.2d  294, 302 ( 6th  Cir.  1991);  Planned \nParenthood of Greater Memphis Region v. Dreyzehner, 853 F. Supp. 2d 724, 732 (M.D. Tenn. \nFeb. 17, 2012).  \nThese factors do not all need to be met and instead merely “guide the discretion of the \ncourt.”  Eagle-Picher, 963 F.2d at 859; Dreyzehner, 853 F. Supp. 2d at 734.  In other words, \n“they are not meant to be rigid and unbending requirements,” because “‘[a] fixed legal standard \nis not the essence of equity jurisprudence.’” Eagle-Picher, 963 F.2d at 859 (citation omitted).  \n  -11-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 12 of 47 PageID #:  65\nHere, a preliminary injunction is warranted because Plaintiffs meet all four factors for  such \ninterim relief. \nI.  PLAINTIFFS ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS \nTo satisfy the “likelihood of success” factor, “it is ordinarily sufficient if the plaintiff has \nraised questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult, and doubtful as to make \nthem a fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.” Dreyzehner, 853 F. \nSupp. 2d at 734 (quoting Six Clinics Holding Corp., II v. Cafcomp Sys., Inc., 119 F.3d 393, 402 \n(6th Cir. 1997)). \nApplying this standard, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of all of their claims, \nincluding  that  the  Mandate:  (1)  violates  RFRA  because  it  substantially  burdens  Plaintiffs’ \nexercise of religion without being the least restrictive means to achieve a compelling government \ninterest  (Compl.  Count  I,  ¶¶  135-145);  (2)  violates  the  Free  Exercise  Clause  of  the  First \nAmendment because it is not a neutral and generally applicable law (Compl. Count II, ¶¶ 146-\n158); (3) violates the First Amendment prohibition on compelled speech because it compels \nPlaintiffs  to  support  and/or  facilitate  “counseling”  that  contradicts  their  religious  viewpoint \n(Compl. Count III, ¶¶ 159-172); (4) violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \nbecause it establishes an official category of Government-favored “religious employers,” which \nexcludes some religious groups based on intrusive judgments regarding their beliefs, practices, \nand organizational structure (Compl. Count IV, ¶¶ 173-177); and (5) violates both Religion \nClauses of the First Amendment because it interferes with Plaintiffs’ rights of internal church \ngovernance (Compl. Count V, ¶¶ 178-185). \nA.  The Mandate Violates RFRA \n \nUnder RFRA, the Federal Government is prohibited from “substantially burden[ing] a \nperson’s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,” \n  -12-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 13 of 47 PageID #:  66\nunless it “demonstrates that application of the burden to the person is (1) in furtherance of a \ncompelling  governmental  interest;  and  (2)  the  least  restrictive  means  of  furthering  that \ncompelling governmental interest.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a), (b); Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita \nBeneficente União Do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 423 (2006). Thus, once Plaintiffs demonstrate a \nsubstantial burden, the Government bears the burden of proving that application of the Mandate \nto Plaintiffs furthers “a compelling governmental interest” and is “the least restrictive means of \nfurthering that compelling governmental interest.” See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b); O Centro, 546 \nU.S. at 423, 428. Here, the Government cannot make such a showing. \nRFRA was enacted to prevent the type of regulation codified in the Mandate. Congress \npassed RFRA “to restore [and codify] the compelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v. \nVerner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972) and . . . guarantee its \napplication in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened.” 42 U.S.C. § \n2000bb; O Centro, 546 U.S. at 430-31. Nadine Strossen, then-President of the American Civil \nLiberties Union, testified in support of RFRA’s enactment to safeguard “such familiar practices \nas . . . permitting religiously sponsored hospitals to decline to provide abortion or contraception \nservices.”  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act: Hearing on S. 2969 Before the S. Comm. on \nthe Judiciary, 102d Cong. 192 (1992); see also 139 Cong. Rec. 9,685 (1993) (statement of Rep. \nS. Hoyer) (noting that, post-Smith, a “Catholic teaching hospital lost its accreditation for refusing \nto provide abortion services” and that RFRA would “correct th[is] injustice[]”); id. at 4,660 \n(statement of Rep. Green) (noting that RFRA prevents the Government from “enact[ing] laws \nthat force a person to participate in actions that violate their religious beliefs”). \nHere, the Mandate cannot possibly survive scrutiny under RFRA because:  (1) it imposes \na  “substantial  burden”  on  Plaintiffs’  free  exercise  of  religion;  (2)  the  Government  has  no \n  -13-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 14 of 47 PageID #:  67\ncompelling interest in imposing this burden; and (3) it is not the least restrictive means to achieve \nthe Government’s interest.  It is not surprising, then, that the only court to have reached the \nmerits  of  similar  RFRA  claims  brought  by  Catholic  Dioceses  and  affiliated  organizations \nconcluded that plaintiffs have a likelihood of prevailing on their RFRA claim and granted \npreliminary relief enjoining the Government from enforcing the Mandate.  See Zubik, et al. v. \nSebelius, et al., No. 2:13-cv-01459 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 21, 2013) and Persico, et al. v. Sebelius, et \nal., No. 1:13-cv-00303 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 21, 2013), Mem. Op.

The Mandate Substantially Burdens Plaintiffs’ Exercise of \nReligion. \n \nUnder  RFRA,  courts  must  first  assess  whether  the  challenged  law  imposes  a \n“substantial[] burden” on the plaintiff’s “exercise of religion.” Id. This initial inquiry requires \ncourts to (1) identify the particular exercise of religion at issue, and (2) assess whether the law \nsubstantially burdens that religious practice. See, e.g., Koger v. Bryan, 523 F.3d 789, 796 (7th \nCir. 2008) (applying this two-part test under RLUIPA, RFRA’s sister statute); see also Hobby \nLobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, 1140 (10th Cir. 2013) (en banc) (stating that the \n                                                 \n3 Courts have also issued preliminary injunctions against the Mandate in the majority of cases brought by \nfor-profit companies with religious owners. If anything, a preliminary injunction is even more appropriate \nin this case involving non-profit entities.  See Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v.

Here, the Mandate imposes a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious \nexercise by forcing them to do what their religion forbids: facilitate access to abortion-inducing \nproducts, contraception, sterilization, and related counseling. See Zubik/Persico Slip Op. at 53. \n(i)  “Exercise of Religion” \n \nRFRA defines “exercise of religion” to include “any exercise of religion, whether or not \ncompelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-2(4), 2000cc- \n5(7)(A).  Because the exercise of religion has been interpreted to include a diverse array of \nconduct, ranging from refusing to give children a formal education, see Yoder, 406 U.S. at 210- \n19, to eating only certain foods, see Nelson v. Miller, 570 F.3d 868, 878-89 (7th Cir. 2009), \nRFRA protects “not only belief and profession but the performance of (or abstention from) \nphysical acts.”  Emp’t Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 877 (1990).  Protected religious exercise \nincludes any act or practice that is “rooted in the religious beliefs of the party asserting the claim \nor defense.” United States v. Ali, 682 F.3d 705, 710 (8th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks \nand alteration omitted). \nWhether an act or practice is rooted in religious belief, and thus entitled to protection, \ndoes not “turn upon a judicial perception of the particular belief or practice in question.” Thomas \nv. Review Bd. of the Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981).  Instead, courts must accept \nplaintiffs’  description  of  their  beliefs  and  practices,  regardless  of  whether  the  court,  or \nGovernment, finds them “acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible.”  Id. at 714–15 \n(refusing to question plaintiff’s moral line); see also United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 257 \n(1982); Koger, 523 F.3d at 797 (plaintiff’s “dietary request [was] squarely within the definition \n  -15-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 16 of 47 PageID #:  69\nof religious exercise”); Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 477 (2d Cir. 1996) (rejecting efforts to \ndispute plaintiff’s representation that a medical test would violate his religion). \n“Courts,” as the Supreme Court has put it, “are not arbiters of scriptural interpretation.” \nThomas, 450 U.S. at 716.  Thus, “[r]epeatedly and in many different contexts,” the Supreme \nCourt has “warned that courts must not presume to determine the place of a particular belief in a \nreligion or the plausibility of a religious claim.”  Smith, 494 U.S. at 887.  Instead, the judicial \nrole is limited to “determining ‘whether the beliefs professed by [the plaintiff] are sincerely held \nand whether they are, in his own scheme of things, religious.’”  Patrick v. LeFevre, 745 F.2d \n153,  157 (2d Cir. 1984) (quoting United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 185 (1965)).  By \nnecessity, this is a modest inquiry that is restrained by the need to avoid excessive entanglement \nin religion. See Jolly, 76 F.3d at 476.  The purpose of the sincerity inquiry is simply to screen out \nmanipulative claims based on sham beliefs that can be readily identified as such, for example, a \nhigh-school student who suddenly proclaims a religious objection to Math.  Courts need not \naccept claims that are “so bizarre, so clearly nonreligious in motivation, as not to be entitled to \nprotection.” Thomas, 450 U.S. at 715. \n“While it is a delicate task to evaluate religious sincerity without questioning religious \nverity,  . . .   free  exercise  doctrine  is  based  upon  the  premise  that  courts  are  capable  of \ndistinguishing between these two questions.”  Jolly, 76 F.3d at 476 (emphasis omitted).  By \nscreening claims for religious sincerity, and by allowing the Government to impose burdens that \nare truly necessary to serve a compelling interest, courts can apply RFRA to grant bona fide \nreligious exemptions without “allowing every person to make his own standards on matters of \nconduct in which society as a whole has important interests.” Yoder, 406 U.S. at 216. Based on \nthis approach, the Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed “the feasibility of case-by-case \n  -16-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 17 of 47 PageID #:  70\nconsideration of religious exemptions to generally applicable rules,” which can be “‘applied in \nan appropriately balanced way’ to specific claims for exemptions as they ar[i]se.” O Centro, 546 \nU.S. at 436 (quoting Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 722 (2005)). \nHere, there can be no doubt that Plaintiffs’ refusal to comply with the Mandate is a \nprotected exercise of religion under RFRA.  It is undisputed that Plaintiffs have a sincerely held \nreligious belief that they may not provide, pay for, or facilitate access to abortion-inducing \nproducts, contraception, sterilization, or related counseling, including by contracting with an \ninsurance company or third party administrator that will, as a result, provide or procure the \nobjectionable products and services for Plaintiffs’ employees.  See Guillory Decl. ¶¶ 12-13; \nFernandez Decl. ¶¶ 16-17.  While courts are bound to accept Plaintiffs’ description of their \nbeliefs  without resort to any independent religious authority, here the sincerity of Plaintiffs’ \nbeliefs is buttressed by repeated confirmations from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. \nSee supra at 5. These authoritative statements of Catholic belief make it unmistakably clear that \nPlaintiffs’ objection to the Mandate is “not merely a matter of personal preference, but one of \ndeep religious conviction, shared by an organized group, and intimately related to daily living.” \nYoder, 406 U.S. at 216. \nNor do Plaintiffs seek to impose their religious beliefs on anyone else, or “to require the \ngovernment itself to conduct its affairs in conformance with [their] religion.” Kaemmerling v. \nLappin,  553  F.3d  669,  680  (D.C.  Cir.  2008).  On  the  contrary,  Plaintiffs  recognize  that \nnotwithstanding their religious objections, they have no legal right to prevent individuals from \nprocuring the objectionable products and services from the Government or anywhere else. \nPlaintiffs simply invoke RFRA to enforce the law that the Government may not force \nthem, in their own conduct, to take actions that violate their religious conscience.  In particular, \n  -17-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 18 of 47 PageID #:  71\nthe  Government  may  not  require  Plaintiffs  to  provide,  pay  for,  and/or  facilitate  access  to \nabortion-  inducing products, contraception, sterilization, and related counseling.  Nor can the \nGovernment force Plaintiffs to contract with a third party that will, as a result, provide or procure \nthe  objectionable  products  and  services  for  Plaintiffs’  employees.  By  imposing  these \nrequirements,  the  Mandate  is  a  straightforward  effort  that  “forces  [Plaintiffs]  to  engage  in \nconduct that their religion forbids.”  Henderson v. Kennedy, 253 F.3d 12, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2001). \nIt is no answer to claim that Plaintiffs, unlike the Hobby Lobby litigants and other for- \nprofit corporations, may be eligible for the Government’s so-called “accommodation.”  For \npurposes of the RFRA analysis, what matters is whether the Government is coercing entities to \ntake actions that violate their sincerely held religious beliefs. Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1137 \n(“Our only task is to determine whether the claimant’s belief is sincere, and if so, whether the \ngovernment has applied substantial pressure on the claimant to violate that belief.”). The fact is \nthat the “accommodation” compels Plaintiffs to contract with an insurance issuer or third party \nadministrator that will, as a result of that contract, provide or procure the objectionable products \nand services for Plaintiffs’ employees.  Indeed, the insurance issuer or third party administrator’s \nobligation exists only so long as Plaintiffs’ employees remain on Plaintiffs’ insurance plan.4 \nAs Plaintiffs have explained to the Government, they believe their involvement in this \nscheme would constitute impermissible facilitation of access to the objectionable products and \nservices. See Guillory Decl. ¶¶ 15-26; Fernandez Decl. ¶¶ 16-24.  See also Zubik/Persico Slip \nOp.  at  47-49  (“[T]he  ‘accommodation’  requires  [plaintiffs]  to  shift  the  responsibility  of \n                                                 \n4 See 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(d) (for self-insured employers, the third party  administrator “will \nprovide or arrange separate payments for contraceptive services . . . for so long as [employees] are enrolled \nin [their] group health plan”); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(i)(B) (for employers that offer insured plans, the \ninsurance issuer must “[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive services . . . for plan participants \nand beneficiaries for so long as they remain enrolled in the plan”). \n  -18-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 19 of 47 PageID #:  72\npurchasing insurance and providing  contraceptive products, services, and counseling, onto a \nsecular source.  The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have a sincerely-held belief that ‘shifting \nresponsibility’ does not absolve or  exonerate them from the moral turpitude created by the \n‘accommodation’; to the contrary, it still  substantially burdens their sincerely-held religious \nbeliefs.”). \nBecause Plaintiffs object to facilitating the objectionable products and services in the \nmanner required by the Mandate, it is irrelevant whether the Mandate also forces them to directly \nsubsidize these products and services. For example, it makes no difference that insurance issuers \nare required to “segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible organization from the \nmonies  used  to  provide  payments  for  contraceptive  services.”    26  C.F.R.  § 54.98 15- \n2713A(c)(2)(ii).  It also makes no difference whether payments for objectionable products and \nservices will be “cost neutral” to Plaintiffs. 78 Fed. Reg. at 8,463. Indeed, Plaintiffs would be \nwilling to pay increased premiums if that would allow them to avoid serving as the vehicle by \nwhich the objectionable products and services would be delivered to their employees. It is, in \nshort, the impermissible facilitation of access to objectionable products and services that violates \nPlaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs. And it is undisputed that the Mandate forces Plaintiffs \nto engage in impermissible facilitation. \nIn any event, it is also clear that, under the Mandate, Plaintiffs will almost certainly be \nrequired to subsidize the objectionable products and services, thereby further exacerbating the \nalready impermissible substantial burden.  This is so, even if the Government’s dubious cost- \nneutrality assumption is true. Take, for example, religious organizations that procure insurance \nfrom  an  insurance  company,  wherein  the  insurance  company  must  provide  or  procure  the \nobjectionable products and services for the religious organization’s employees. According to the \n  -19-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 20 of 47 PageID #:  73\nGovernment, the cost to the insurance company of doing so will be offset by, among other \nthings, “fewer  childbirths” that result from the use of contraception,  sterilization, abortion- \ninducing products, and related counseling.  78 F ed. Reg. at 8,463.   But even if the Mandate \nsucceeds  in  reducing  “childbirths”  in  high  enough  numbers  to  achieve  cost-neutrality,  the \npremiums previously going toward childbirths will now be used to provide the objectionable \nproducts and services necessary to obtain that reduction in childbirths. After all, obtaining that \nreduction is the very basis upon which the Government’s cost-neutrality assumption is premised. \nAs  noted,  however,  the  Government’s  cost-neutrality  assumption  is  implausible.  It \ndepends on the questionable assumption that the cost of contraception will be offset by “lower \ncosts from improvements in women’s health and fewer childbirths,” 78 Fed. Reg. at 8,463,  \nwhich in turn depends on the assumption that the Mandate will induce large numbers of women \nwho do not currently use contraception to begin doing so.  This, of course, demonstrates why \nPlaintiffs so vehemently object to the Mandate:  It forces them to participate in a scheme \nspecifically designed to lure women to engage in practices contrary to Plaintiffs’ sincerely held \nreligious beliefs.  More important for present purposes, the Government has adduced no evidence \nthat women will change their behavior in sufficient numbers to achieve cost-neutrality.  The \nsame  is  true  for  self-insured  organizations,  for  whom,  the  Government  asserts,  third  party \nadministrators will be permitted to recoup their costs through reductions in user fees on federally \nfacilitated  health  exchanges.  See  78  Fed.  Reg.  at  39,882.  These  fee  reductions  are  to  be \nestablished through a highly regulated and bureaucratic process for evaluating, approving, and \nmonitoring fees paid in compensation to third party administrators.  Such regulatory regimes, \nhowever, invariably fail to fully compensate regulated entities for the costs and risks incurred.  \nAs a result, few if any third party administrators are likely to participate in this regime, and those \n  -20-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 21 of 47 PageID #:  74\nthat do are likely to increase fees charged to self-insured organizations. Consequently, the costs \nof providing objectionable products and services will be passed back to religious organizations. \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs’ refusal to facilitate the objectionable products and services \nin the manner required by the Mandate is a protected exercise of religion. Accordingly, the only \nrelevant question for this Court under the “substantial burden” analysis is whether the Mandate \nputs substantial pressure on Plaintiffs to act in a manner that is contrary to this religious practice. \n(ii) “Substantial Burden” \nOnce Plaintiffs’ refusal to facilitate contraception is correctly identified as a protected \nreligious exercise, the “substantial burden” analysis is straightforward.  As the Supreme Court \nhas made clear, a federal law “substantially burdens” an exercise of religion if it compels one “to \nperform acts undeniably at odds with fundamental tenets of [one’s] religious beliefs,” Yoder, 406 \nU.S. at 218, or “put[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and violate his \nbeliefs.”  Thomas, 450 U.S. at 717-18; Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 678 (same).  In Yoder, for \nexample, the Court found a substantial burden imposed by a $5 penalty charged to the Amish \nplaintiffs for refusing to follow a compulsory secondary-education law. In Thomas, the Court \nsimilarly held that the denial of unemployment compensation substantially burdened the pacifist \nconvictions of a Jehovah’s Witness who refused to work at a factory manufacturing tank turrets. \n450 U.S. at 716-18. Thus, it is clear that even the threat of withholding unemployment benefits, \nor a $5 penalty, exerts enough pressure on a religious believer to qualify as a “substantial \nburden.” \nHere, the Mandate imposes enough pressure on Plaintiffs to constitute a “substantial \nburden.”  If Plaintiffs refuse to facilitate the objectionable products and services through their \nhealth plans, they will be subject to fatal fines of $100 a day per affected beneficiary. See 26 \n  -21-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 22 of 47 PageID #:  75\nU.S.C. § 4980D(b); see also Jennifer Staman & Jon Shimabukuro, Cong. Research Serv., RL 7- \n5700,  Enforcement  of  the  Preventive  Health  Care  Services  Requirements  of  the  Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (Feb. 24, 2012) at 7 (asserting that this fine applies to \nemployers  that  violate  the  “preventive  care”  provision  of  the  Act).  On  the  other  hand,  if \nPlaintiffs seek to exit the insurance market altogether, they could be subject to an annual fine of \n$2,000 per full-time employee after the first thirty employees. See 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(a), (c)(1). \nThese penalties, which would amount to millions of dollars and inflict significant competitive \nharms, clearly impose the type of pressure that qualifies as a substantial burden under RFRA— \nfar outweighing, for example, the $5 penalty that was a substantial burden in Yoder. There is no \ndoubt that the threat of such penalties compels Plaintiffs to facilitate access to abortion-inducing \nproducts, contraception, sterilization, and related counseling, which their religion forbids. \nThe only federal district court to address substantial burden with respect to similarly \nsituated plaintiffs has applied binding Supreme Court precedent and Korte to hold that the \nMandate “places a substantial burden on plaintiffs’ right to freely exercise their religion – \nspecifically their right to not facilitate or initiate the provision of contraceptive products, \nservices, or counseling.”  Zubik/Persico Slip op. at 53. \nFirst, the court applied the test from Korte that “[a]t a minimum, a substantial burden \nexists when the government compels a religious person to ‘perform acts undeniably at odds with \nfundamental tenets of [his] religious beliefs.  Id. at 46 (quoting Korte v. Sebelius, Nos. 12-3841, \n13-1077, 2013 WL 5960692, at *22 (7th Cir. Nov. 8, 2013)). This test analyzes the plaintiffs’ \nsincerely held religious beliefs as articulated, without questioning their scope: \n.  .  .  the  test  for  substantial  burden  does  not  ask  whether  the \nclaimant has correctly interpreted his religious obligations.  See \n(sic) Lee, 455 U.S. at 257; Thomas, 450 U.S. at 715-16.  Indeed \nthat inquiry is prohibited. “[I]n this sensitive area, it is not within \n  -22-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 23 of 47 PageID #:  76\nthe judicial function and judicial competence to inquire whether \nthe [adherent has] . . . correctly perceived the commands of [his] . . \n.  faith.   C ourts  are  not  arbiters  of  scriptural  interpretation.” \nThomas, 450 U.S. at 716.  It is enough that the claimant has an \n‘honest  conviction’  that  what  the  government  is  requiring, \nprohibiting, or pressuring him to do conflicts with his religion. \n \nId. at 48 (quoting Korte, 2013 WL 5960692, at *22).  Thus the Court must accept \nPlaintiffs’  articulation  of  their  sincerely  held  religious  beliefs,  if  unchallenged  by  the \nGovernment,  that  prohibit  them  from  signing  the  self-certification  and  participating  in  the \naccommodation process. See Guillory Decl. ¶¶ 15-26; Fernandez Decl. ¶¶ 16-24. \nSecond, the court determined that the accommodation substantially burdens plaintiffs’ \nreligious exercise because it requires them “to sign a form which thereby facilitates/initiates the \nprovision of contraceptive products, services, and counseling.” Zubik/Persico Slip op. at 48; see \nid. at 48-53.  Despite the clear legal standard, in that case the Government argued that the \naccommodation  did  not  require  plaintiffs  to  violate  their  religious  beliefs  or  modify  their \nbehavior because eligible entities “merely [had to] sign a piece of paper” and inform their third \nparty administrator (“TPA”) of the same religious objections they had prior to the issuance of the \nMandate.  Id. at 47.  The court rejected that argument, however, because plaintiffs sincerely \nbelieve that the accommodation requires action that violates their religious beliefs. See, e.g., id. \nat 49 (“The Government is asking Plaintiffs for documentation for what Plaintiffs sincerely \nbelieve is an immoral purpose, and thus, they cannot provide it.”).  Although plaintiffs may be \nengaging in the same conduct as they did before the Mandate, the effect is significantly different: \n“in the past, such actions barred the provision of contraceptive products, services or counseling. \nNow,  this  type  of  information  previously  submitted  to  an  insurer  or  TPA  will  be  used  to \nfacilitate/initiate  the  provision  of  contraceptive  products, services  or  counseling  –  in  direct \n  -23-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 24 of 47 PageID #:  77\ncontravention of their religious tenets.” Id. at 48 (emphasis added). Moreover, the participation \nof the TPA does not affect the analysis, nor “absolve” plaintiffs: \n[T]he  “accommodation”  requires  [plaintiffs]  to  shift  the \nresponsibility of purchasing insurance and providing contraceptive \nproducts,  services,  and  counseling,  onto  a  secular  source.  The \nCourt concludes that Plaintiffs have a sincerely-held belief that \n“shifting responsibility” does not absolve or exonerate them from \nthe  moral  turpitude  created  by  the  “accommodation”;  to  the \ncontrary, it still substantially burdens their sincerely-held religious \nbeliefs. \n \nId. at 49.  This is especially true because the Government acknowledged the effect of \nsigning the self-certification and conceded plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs. See Slip \nop. at 47. \nThird,  the  court  in  Zubik  and  Persico  also  rejected  the  Government’s  attempt  to \ndistinguish for-profit cases like Korte. For example, during oral argument in Zubik and Persico, \nDefendants asserted: \nunlike the for-profit cases where the regulations do actually require \nthe employers to provide contraceptive services in their employee \nplans,  here  again  it’s  a  third  party  that  provides  payment  for \ncontraceptive  services.  So  the  burden  in  these  cases,  in  these \nnonprofit cases, is accommodated, really this entity is far more \nattenuated and unsubstantial. \n \nZubik and Persico Nov. 13, 2013 Oral Arg. Tr. at 52:17-24 (excerpt attached at Ex. J). \nThe district court disagreed, however, and “found the recent decisions pertaining to secular, for-\nprofit organizations to be instructive . . . .” Zubik/Persico Slip op. at 39 (emphasis added). \nFinally, the court in Zubik and Persico found a substantial burden in the distinction \nbetween exempt and accommodated entities:  by dividing the Catholic Church into a “worship \narm” and “‘good works’ arm[]”, “the Government has created a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ \nright to freely exercise their religious beliefs.”  Id. at 53.  The court questioned:  “Why should \n  -24-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 25 of 47 PageID #:  78\nreligious employers who provide the charitable and educational services of the Catholic Church \nbe required to facilitate/initiate the provision of contraceptive products, services, and counseling, \nthrough their health insurers or TPAs, when religious employers who operate the houses of \nworship do not?” Id. at 50-51. The court found the religious employer exemption “enigmatic” \nin the manner in which it “allows the same members of the same religion to completely adhere to \ntheir religious beliefs at times (when the ‘exemption’ applies), while other times, forces them to \nviolate those beliefs (when the ‘accommodation’ applies).” Id. at 52 (emphasis in original).  The \nBishops “while wearing their ‘house-of-worship’ hats, are not in any moral peril; yet, when they \nwear their ‘head-of-the-“good works”-agencies’ hats, they must take affirmative actions which \nfacilitate/initiate the provision of contraceptive products, services, and counseling in violation of \ntheir religious tenets.”  Id. at 51-52.  Additionally, the court was “constrained to understand” \nwhy charitable, social services agencies would not be treated the same as the Church itself with \nrespect  to  the  free  exercise  of  that  religion.    If  the  contraceptive  mandate  creates  such  a \nsubstantial burden on the Dioceses’ exercise of religion so as to require the religious employer \n“exemption,” the contraceptive mandate obviously creates the same substantial burden on the \nnonprofit, religious affiliated/related organizations like Plaintiffs . . .  , which implement the \n“good works” of the Dioceses.  Id. at 52.  The same applies here. \nAs noted and relied upon by the Western District of Pennsylvania, the Seventh and Tenth \nCircuits recently addressed challenges by for-profit companies against the Mandate and found \nthat the religious exercise of for-profit entities is substantially burdened by the Mandate.  The \nSeventh Circuit in Korte held that the Government may not force  a  for-profit company to \ncontract  with  a  third  party  that  would  provide  contraceptive  coverage  to  the  company’s \nemployees over the owners’ religious objections. That holding applies with even greater force \n  -25-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 26 of 47 PageID #:  79\nhere,  where  Plaintiffs  are  non-profit  religious  organizations.  Korte  makes  clear  that  “the \nsubstantial-burden test under RFRA focuses primarily on the ‘intensity of the coercion applied  \nby the government to act contrary to religious beliefs,’ [the inquiry] evaluates the coercive effect \nof  the  governmental  pressure  on  the  adherent’s  religious  practice  and  steers  well  clear  of \ndeciding religious questions.” 2013 WL 5960692, at *23 (emphasis added). Thus, the court was \nbound to accept the plaintiffs’ sincere religious belief that complying with the Mandate “would \nmake them complicit in a grave moral wrong.”  Id.; see also id. at *5 (“As the [plaintiffs] \nunderstand their religious obligations, providing the mandated coverage would facilitate a grave \nmoral wrong.” (emphasis added)).  In light of that sincere belief, the only question for purposes \nof  the  substantial  burden  analysis  was  whether  the  Government  had  imposed  “substantial \npressure” to force plaintiffs to comply with the Mandate, id. at *22 (quoting Thomas, 450 U.S. at \n718), to which the court found it easy to answer.  By threatening such “ruinous fines,” the \nMandate  “placed  enormous  pressure  on  the  plaintiffs  to  violate  their  religious  beliefs  and \nconform to its regulatory mandate,” thus imposing a “direct and substantial” burden on plaintiffs’ \nreligious exercise. Id. at *23. The Tenth Circuit, sitting en banc, likewise recently held that a \nfor-profit religious company was likely to succeed on the merits of a RFRA claim because the \nMandate  imposed  a  substantial  burden  on  religious  exercise  by  “demand[ing],”  on  pain  of \nonerous penalties, “that [plaintiffs] enable access to contraceptives that [they] deem morally \nproblematic.” Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1141.5   The same is true here. \nIn sum, the Mandate leaves no way for Plaintiffs to continue their operations in a manner \nconsistent with their sincerely held religious beliefs.  Instead, it forces them to either abandon \n                                                 \n5 See also Gilardi v. HHS, No. 13-5069, 2013 WL 5854246 (D.C. Cir.

See Guillory Decl. ¶¶ 15-26; Fernandez Decl. ¶¶ 16-24.  Imposing this \nimpossible  dilemma  constitutes  a  substantial  burden  on P laintiffs’  religious  exercise.    This \nburden is exacerbated by the fact that the Mandate will almost certainly require Plaintiffs to \nsubsidize the objectionable products and services. \n2.  The Government Cannot Demonstrate that the Mandate \nFurthers a Compelling Government Interest. \n \nUnder RFRA, the Government must “demonstrate that the compelling interest test is \nsatisfied through application of the challenged law [to] the particular claimant whose sincere \nexercise of religion is being substantially burdened.” O Centro, 546 U.S. at 430–31 “[B]roadly \nformulated” or “sweeping” interests are inadequate. Id. at 431; Yoder, 406 U.S. at 221. Rather, \nthe Government must show with “particularity how [even] admittedly strong interest[s]” “would \nbe adversely affected by granting an exemption.” Yoder, 406 U.S. at 236; see also O Centro,  \n546 U.S. at 431. The Government, therefore, must show a specific compelling interest in forcing \n“the particular claimant[s] whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened” \ninto serving as the instruments by which its purported goals are advanced. Id. at 430-31; Tyndale \nHouse  Publishers,  Inc.  v.  Sebelius,  904 F   .Supp.  2d 106, 125 -26  (D.D.C.  2012).    The \nGovernment cannot begin to meet this standard. \nAt the most basic level, “a law cannot be regarded as protecting an interest of the highest \norder when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited.” Church \nof the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 547 (1993) (internal quotation \nmarks and alteration omitted); see also O Centro, 546 U.S. at 433; Newland, 881 F. Supp. 2d at \n1297-98. Here, the Government cannot claim an interest of the “highest order” where it exempts \nmillions of employees from the Mandate through grandfathering provisions and small-employer \n  -27-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 28 of 47 PageID #:  81\nexemptions.  The  Government  cannot  plausibly  maintain  that  Plaintiffs’  employees  must  be \ncovered by the Mandate when it already exempts millions of women receiving insurance through \ngrandfathered plans simply to fulfill the President’s promise that “Americans who like their \nhealth plan can keep it.”  HHS.gov, “U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, \nand Treasury Issue Regulation on ‘Grandfathered’ Health Plans [U]nder the Affordable Care \nAct” (June 14, 2010) (Ex. E).  An interest is hardly compelling if it can be trumped by political \nexpediency.  Such  a  broad  exemption  “completely  undermines  any  compelling  interest  in \napplying the preventive care coverage mandate.” Newland, 881 F. Supp. 2d at 1298; see also \nHobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1144; Geneva Coll. v. Sebelius, 929 F. Supp. 2d 402, 434 (W.D. Pa. \n2013), injunction granted 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85107 (W.D. Pa. June 18, 2013); Tyndale, 904 \nF. Supp. 2d at 128. \nThe  Mandate’s  narrow  “religious  employer”  exemption  further  undermines  the \nGovernment’s claim that its interests are “compelling.” In O Centro, a religious group sought an \nexemption from the Controlled Substances Act to use hoasca—a hallucinogen—for religious \npurposes. When granting the exemption, the Supreme Court refused to credit the Government’s \nalleged interest in public health and safety when the Act at issue already contained an exemption \nfor the religious use of another hallucinogen—peyote.  “Everything the Government says about \nthe DMT in hoasca,” the Court explained, “applies in equal measure to the mescaline in peyote.” \nO Centro, 546 U.S. at 433.  Because Congress permitted peyote use in the face of concerns \nregarding health and public safety, “it [wa]s difficult to see how” those same concerns could \n“preclude  any  consideration  of  a  similar  exception  for”  the  religious  use  of  hoasca.    Id.  \nLikewise, “everything the Government says” about its interests in requiring Plaintiffs to facilitate \naccess to the mandated products and services “applies in equal measure” to entities that meet the  \n  -28-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 29 of 47 PageID #:  82\nMandate’s definition of “religious employer,” as well as the numerous other entities that are \nexempt from the Mandate for non-religious reasons. \nThat  the  Government’s  own  religious  employer  exemption  undermines  its  alleged \ncompelling interest was confirmed in Zubik and Persico, where the court reasoned that the \nreligious employer exemption “is an acknowledgment of the lack of a compelling governmental \ninterest as to religious employers who hire employees for their ‘houses of worship,’” and the \nGovernment’s  claim  that  there  is  such  a  compelling  interest  as  to  “a  different  religious \naffiliated/related employer fails.” Zubik/Persico Slip op. at 55-56. Indeed, the court concluded \nthat the Government’s justification for the distinction between exempt and accommodated entities \nis “speculative and unsubstantiated by the record and, therefore, unpersuasive.” Id. at 56-57.6  \nUltimately, the court found there was no compelling interest because of the religious employer \nexemption: \nIf  there  is  no  compelling  governmental  interest  to  apply  the \ncontraceptive mandate to the religious employers who operate the \n‘houses of worship,’ then there can be no compelling governmental \ninterest to apply (even in an indirect fashion) the contraceptive \nmandate  to  the  religious  employers  of  the  nonprofit,  religious \naffiliated/related entities, like Plaintiffs in these cases. \n \nSlip op. at 56. \nFinally, the Government’s interest cannot be compelling where the Mandate would only \nfill, at best, a “modest gap” in contraceptive coverage.  Brown v. Entm’t Merchs. Ass’n, 131 S. \nCt. 2729, 2741 (2011).  The Government acknowledges that contraceptives are widely available \nat free and reduced cost and are also covered by “over 85 percent of employer-sponsored health \n                                                 \n6 The court also explained that recognizing such a compelling interest “would be to allow the Government \nto cleave the Catholic Church into two parts:  worship, and service and ‘good works,’ thereby entangling \nthe Government in deciding what comprises ‘religion.’” Zubik/Persico Slip op. at 56; see also infra at Sect. \nI.D.2. \n  -29-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 30 of 47 PageID #:  83\ninsurance plans.”  75 Fed. Reg. 41,726, 41,732 (July 19, 2010); HHS.gov, “A Statement by U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius” (Jan. 20, 2012) (Ex. F). \nThe Government, moreover, has adduced “no empirical data or other evidence . . . t hat the \nprovision of the FDA-approved emergency contraceptives . . . would result in fewer unintended \npregnancies, an increased propensity to seek prenatal care, or a lower frequency of risky behavior \nendangering  unborn  babies.”  Beckwith  v.  Sebelius,  No.  8:13-cv-0648-T-17MAP,  2013  WL \n3297498, at *17 (M.D. Fla. June 25, 2013). \nTo the contrary, recent scholarship confirms that a modest increase in coverage for \ncontraception is unlikely to significantly impact contraceptive use, “because the group of women \nwith the highest unintended pregnancy rates (the poor) are not addressed or affected by the \nMandate [because they are unemployed], and are already amply supplied with free or low-cost \ncontraception,” and “because women have a true variety of reasons for not using contraception \nthat the law cannot mitigate or satisfy simply by attempting to increase access to contraception \nby making it ‘free.’”  Helen M. Alvaré, No Compelling Interest: The “Birth Control” Mandate \nand Religious Freedom, 58 VILL. L. REV. 379, 380 (2013). As such, the Government cannot \nclaim to have “identif[ied] an actual problem in need of solving,”  Brown, 131 S. Ct. at 2738 \n(internal marks and citation omitted), much less that its proposed solution will address the \nalleged problem in any meangful way.  See Zubik/Persico Slip Op. at 57 (holding that the \nGovernment provided  no evidence  that  “women  who  receive  their  health  coverage  through \nemployers like plaintiffs would face negative health and other outcomes”).  Simply put, the \nGovernment “does not have a compelling interest in each marginal percentage point by which its \ngoals are advanced.”  Brown, 131 S. Ct. at 2741 n.9. \n   \n  -30-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 31 of 47 PageID #:  84\n3.  The Government Cannot Demonstrate that the Mandate Is \nthe Least Restrictive Means to Achieve Its Asserted \nInterests. \n \nUnder RFRA, the Government must also show that the regulation “is the least restrictive \nmeans of furthering that compelling governmental interest.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b)(2).  Under \nthat test, “[i]f there are other, reasonable ways to achieve those [interests] with a lesser burden on \nconstitutionally  protected  activity,  [the  Government]  may  not  choose  the  way  of  greater \ninterference.  If it acts at all, it must choose less drastic means.” Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. \n330, 343 (1972) (internal quotations marks omitted). “A statute or regulation is the least \nrestrictive  means  if  ‘no  alternative  forms  of  regulation  would  [accomplish  the  compelling \ninterest]  without infringing [religious exercise] rights.’”  Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 684 (quoting \nSherbert, 374 U.S. at 407).  “Nor can the government slide through the test merely because \nanother alternative would not be quite as good.”  Hodgkins v. Peterson, 355 F.3d 1048, 1060 \n(7th Cir. 2004). \nThe “least restrictive means” test “necessarily implies a comparison with other means.” \nWashington v. Klem, 497 F.3d 272, 284 (3d Cir. 2007). “Because this burden is placed on the \nGovernment,  it  must  be  the  party  to  make  this  comparison.”    Id.  The  Government  must \ndemonstrate that “it has actually considered and rejected the efficacy of less restrictive measures \nbefore adopting the challenged practice.” Warsoldier v. Woodford, 418 F.3d 989, 999 (9th Cir. \n2005); see also Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 133 S. Ct. 2411, 2420 (2013) (explaining that \nstrict scrutiny requires a “serious, good faith consideration of workable . . . alternatives” that will \nachieve the government’s stated goal) (quoting Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 339 (2003)). \nThe Western District of Pennsylvania found that in light of the Government’s failure to \nmeet its burden on compelling interest it “need not consider whether the ‘accommodation’ was \n  -31-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 32 of 47 PageID #:  85\nthe least restrictive means of meeting the stated compelling interests.” Zubik/Persico Slip op. at \n58.  “Nevertheless,” the court concluded that “the Government failed to present any credible \nevidence tending to prove that it utilized the least restrictive means of advancing those interests.” \nId. at 58, 60.  Indeed, “there is nothing in the record to establish, or even hint, that a broader \n‘religious employer’ exemption, to include Plaintiffs . . . , would have any impact at all on ‘the \nentire  statutory  scheme’”,  id.  at  60,  despite  the  Government’s  assertion  that  the \n“accommodation” was the “‘only possible means’ of furthering the two [alleged] compelling \ngovernmental interests . . . .”  Id. at 58.  In that case, all the Government could point to in support \nof its least restrictive means argument was one page of the Federal Register (78 Fed. Reg. 39,888 \n(July 2, 2013))—a page that “clearly announces that the alternatives to the current regulations— \nincluding  the  contraceptive  mandate—would  not  advance  the  Government’s  interests  ‘as \neffectively as’ the contraceptive mandate and the ‘accommodation.’”  Id. at 60 (emphasis in \noriginal).  But, as the court noted:  “Greater efficacy does not equate to the least restrictive \nmeans.” Id. at 60. \nThe Seventh Circuit in Korte has also recently held that the Government “has not come \nclose to carrying its burden of demonstrating that it cannot achieve its policy goals in ways less \ndamaging  to  religious-exercise  rights.”  Korte,  2013  WL  5960692,  at  *26.  By  asserting \nsweeping interests in “public health” and “gender equality,” the Government has “guarantee[d] \nthat the mandate” will fail strict scrutiny because it is “impossible to show that the mandate is the \nleast restrictive means of furthering” those broad interests. Id. at *25. Moreover, even assuming \nthe Government has a compelling interest in the more specific goal of “broaden[ing] access to \nfree contraception and sterilization”—an assumption that is “both contestable and contested”— \n  -32-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 33 of 47 PageID #:  86\nthe Mandate still fails strict scrutiny because “there are many ways to increase access to free \ncontraception” without forcing Plaintiffs to participate in the effort. Id. at *25-26. \nHere, the Government has myriad ways to achieve its asserted interests without forcing \nPlaintiffs to violate their religious beliefs. Plaintiffs in no way recommend these alternatives and \noppose many of them as a matter of policy, but the fact that they are available to the Government \nshows that the Mandate cannot survive RFRA’s narrow-tailoring requirement. For example, the \nGovernment could:  (i) directly provide contraceptive services to the few individuals who do not \nreceive it under their health plans; (ii) offer grants to entities that already provide contraceptive \nservices at free or subsidized rates and/or work with these entities to expand delivery of the \nservices; (iii) directly offer insurance coverage for contraceptive services; (iv) grant tax credits or \ndeductions to women who purchase contraceptive services; or (v) allow Plaintiffs to comply with \nthe Mandate by providing coverage for methods of family planning consistent with Catholic \nbeliefs (i.e., Natural Family Planning training and materials).  Indeed, the Government is already \nproviding  “free  contraception  to  women,”  including  through  the  Title  X  Family  Planning \nProgram.  Newland, 881 F. Supp. 2d at 1299. The Government’s utter failure to consider these \nalternatives is fatal, because strict scrutiny requires a “serious, good faith consideration” of \nworkable alternatives. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339; Zubik/Persico Slip Op. at 59 (holding that the \nGovernment  could  not  meet  its  burden  to  establish  that  the  “accommodation”  is  the  least \nrestrictive  means  because  it  failed  to  “offer[]  any  evidence  [in  the  administrative  record] \nconcerning: (1) the identity of all other possible ‘least restrictive means’ considered by the \nGovernment;  (2)  the  analysis  of  each  of  the  ‘means’  to  determine  which  was  the  ‘least’ \nrestrictive; (3) the identity of the person(s) involved in the identification and evaluation of the \n  -33-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 34 of 47 PageID #:  87\nalternative ‘means’; or (4) ‘evidence-based’ analysis as to why the Government believes that the \n‘accommodation’ is the ‘least restrictive means’”). \nB.  The Mandate Violates the Free Exercise Clause \nThe  Free  Exercise  Clause  of  the  First  Amendment  embodies  a  “fundamental  non-\npersecution  principle”  that  prevents  the  Government  from  “enact[ing]  laws  that  suppress \nreligious belief or practice.” Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 523. “At a minimum, the protections of the \nFree Exercise Clause pertain if the law at issue discriminates against some or all religious beliefs \nor regulates or prohibits conduct because it is undertaken for religious reasons.”  Id. at 532. \nWhile the Free Exercise Clause does not require heightened scrutiny of laws that are \n“neutral [and] generally applicable,” Smith, 494 U.S. at 881, it does require strict scrutiny of \nlaws that disfavor religion.  See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 532.  Thus, “[a] law burdening religious \npractice that is not neutral or not of general application must undergo the most rigorous of \nscrutiny.” Id. at 546. \nIn  Lukumi,  for  example,  the  Supreme  Court  invalidated  a  municipal  ordinance  that \nimposed penalties on “[w]hoever . . . unnecessarily . . . kills any animal.” Id. at 537. Although \nthe ordinance was not facially discriminatory, the Court found that its practical effect was to \ndisfavor religious practioners of Santeria because it allowed exemptions for secular but not for \nreligious reasons. Once the city began allowing exemptions, the Court held that the law was no \nlonger “generally applicable,” and the city could not “refuse to extend [such exemptions] to \ncases of ‘religious hardship’ without compelling reason.” Id. at 537 (internal citation omitted). \nLikewise, in Fraternal Order of Police Newark Lodge No. 12 v. City of Newark, 170 F.3d 359, \n365-67 (3d Cir. 1999) (Alito, J.), the Third Circuit invalidated a police department policy that \nprohibited a Sikh police officer from wearing a beard because it contained an exemption for \n  -34-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 35 of 47 PageID #:  88\nofficers who were unable to shave for medical reasons but not for religious reasons.  Relying on \nLukumi,  the  court  found  that  the  “decision  to  provide  medical  exemptions  while  refusing \nreligious  exemptions  is  sufficiently  suggestive  of  discriminatory  intent  so  as  to  trigger \nheightened scrutiny.” Id. at 365. \nThe same reasoning applies here.  The Mandate is not “generally applicable” because it is \nriddled with exemptions,  see supra at 4, and  yet there is no such exemption for religious \nemployers like Plaintiffs.  It makes no difference that the Mandate contains an exemption for a \nnarrow subset of religious groups—namely, those that meet the Government’s limited definition \nof a “religious employer.”  Because it offers so many secular exemptions, the Government must \ngive equal consideration to all claimants who seek similar exemptions on religious grounds. The \nFree Exercise Clause does not merely require equal treatment for some religious entities. Thus, \nthe Mandate fails the test of general applicability, and the Government may not “refuse to extend \n[exemptions] to cases of ‘religious hardship’ without compelling reason.” Lukumi, 508 U.S. at \n537. \nIn addition, the Mandate is not “neutral” because it is specifically targeted at Plaintiffs’ \nreligious  practice  of  refusing  to  provide  or  facilitate  access  to  contraception.    When  the \nGovernment  promulgated  the  Mandate,  it  was  acutely  aware  that  any  gap  in  coverage  for \ncontraception was due primarily to the religious beliefs and practices of employers such as the \nCatholic Church.  Indeed, the Government itself concedes that 85% of health plans already cover \ncontraception, and it asserts that adding contraception to the remaining 15% is cost-neutral.  If \nso,  then  the  only  conceivable  reason  why  the  latter  plans  would not include  contraceptive \ncoverage is a religious or moral objection. But instead of pursuing a wide variety of options for \nincreasing access to contraception without forcing religious groups like Plaintiffs to participate in \n  -35-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 36 of 47 PageID #:  89\nthe effort, the Government deliberately chose to pick a high-profile fight by forcing religious \ngroups to provide or facilitate access to contraception in violation of their core beliefs. \nThe record, moreover, establishes that the Mandate was part of a conscious political \nstrategy to marginalize and delegitimize Plaintiffs’ religious views on contraception by holding \nthem up for ridicule on the national stage.  For example, at a NARAL Pro-Choice America \nfundraiser, Defendant Sebelius stated, “Wouldn’t you think that people who want to reduce the \nnumber of abortions would champion the cause of widely affordable contraceptive services? Not \nso much.”  (Compl. ¶ 119).  Thus, the Government went out of its way to impose an unnecessary \nburden on Plaintiffs’ religious practices.  Not only the “real operation,” but also the intended \neffect, of the Mandate has always been to target and suppress Plaintiffs’ religious practices. \nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 533-35. \nFinally, the Mandate is subject to strict scrutiny because it implicates the “hybrid” rights \nof religious believers.  In Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 881-82 (1990), the \nSupreme  Court  noted  that  the  Free  Exercise  Clause  can  “reinforce[]”  other  constitutional \nprotections, such as freedom of speech and association, which are particularly important when \nreligious beliefs and practices are at stake. The present case illustrates why.  In order to carry out \ntheir religious mission, Plaintiffs must enjoy the freedom to associate in religious schools and \ncharities  without  being  forced  to  violate  their  core  beliefs.  The  Mandate  denies  them  this \nfreedom by effectively prohibiting them from forming schools and charities unless they (a) \nprovide or facilitate access to contraception, and (b) sponsor Government speech in the form of \ncontraceptive “counseling.”  Thus, not only does the Mandate violate Plaintiffs’ rights of free \nspeech and association, but the effect of these violations is to deny Plaintiffs their ability to \nengage in religious schooling, health care, and charity—essential components of their faith. \n  -36-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 37 of 47 PageID #:  90\nC.  The Mandate Violates the First Amendment Protection Against Compelled \nSpeech \n \nIt  is  “a  basic  First  Amendment  principle  that  ‘freedom  of  speech  prohibits  the \ngovernment from telling people what they must say.’”  Agency for Int’l Dev. v. Alliance for \nOpen Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 133 S.Ct. 2321, 2327 (2013) (quoting Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic \nand  Inst. Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 61 (2006)).  Thus, “[a]ny attempt by the government either \nto compel individuals to express certain views, or to subsidize speech to which they object, is \nsubject to strict scrutiny.”  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al., v. FDA, 696 F. 2d 1205, 1211   \n(D.C. Cir. 2012) (citing United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U.S. 405, 410-11 (2001)).  \nProtection against compelled speech “applies not only to expressions of value, opinion, or \nendorsement, but equally to statements of fact the speaker would rather avoid.” Hurley v. Irish- \nAm. Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Grp. of Bos., Inc., 515 U.S. 557, 573 (1995). \nThe Mandate violates the First Amendment prohibition on compelled speech in two \nways.  First, it requires Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to “counseling” \nrelated to abortion-inducing products, contraception, and sterilization for their employees. \nBecause Plaintiffs oppose abortion and contraception, they strongly object to providing \nany  support for “counseling” that encourages, promotes, or facilitates such practices.  Indeed, \nopposition to abortion and contraception is an important part of the religious message that \nPlaintiffs preach, and they routinely counsel men and women against engaging in such practices. \nConsequently, forcing Plaintiffs to support “counseling” in favor of such practices, or even to \ngive details about the availability of such practices, imposes a serious burden on their freedom of \nspeech.  In short, Plaintiffs cannot be forced to act as mouthpieces in the Government’s campaign \nto expand access to abortion and contraception. \n  -37-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 38 of 47 PageID #:  91\nSecond, to qualify for the so-called “accommodation,” the Mandate requires Plaintiffs to \nprovide a “certification” stating their objection to the provision of abortion-inducing products, \ncontraception,  sterilization,  and  related  counseling.  This  “certification”  in  turn  triggers  an \nobligation on the part of Plaintiffs’ third party administrator (or their insurance provider, if they \ndo not self-insure) to provide or procure the objectionable products and services for Plaintiffs’ \nemployees.  Plaintiffs object to this certification requirement both because it compels them to \nengage in speech that triggers provision of the objectionable products and services, and because \nit deprives them of the freedom to speak on the issue of abortion and contraception on their own \nterms, at a time and place of their own choosing, outside of the confines of the Government’s \nregulatory  scheme.  See,  e.g.,  Evergreen  Ass’n  v.  City  of  New  York,  801  F.  Supp.  2d  197 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2011) (striking down law requiring crisis pregnancy centers to issue disclaimers that \nthey did not provide abortion-related services); Tepeyac v. Montgomery Cnty., 779 F. Supp. 2d \n456, 459, 462 n.6  (D. Md. 2011), aff’d 722 F.3d 184 (4th Cir. 2013) (en banc) (enjoining \nenforcement of law requiring crisis pregnancy centers to post notice “encourag[ing] women who \nare or may be pregnant to consult with a licensed health care provider”). \nD.  The “Religious Employer” Exemption Violates the Establishment  Clause \n \nThe  “religious  employer”  exemption  violates  the  Establishment  Clause  of  the  First \nAmendment  in  two  ways.  First,  it  creates  an  artificial,  Government-favored  category  of \n“religious employers,” which favors some types of religious groups over others.  Second, it \ncreates an excessive entanglement between government and religion. \n1.  Discrimination Among Religious Groups \n \nThe  principle  of  equal  treatment  among  religious  groups  lies  at  the  core  of  the \nEstablishment  Clause.   J ust  as  the  Government  cannot  discriminate  among  sects  or \n  -38-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 39 of 47 PageID #:  92\ndenominations, so too it cannot “discriminate between ‘types of institution’ on the basis of the \nnature of the religious practice these institutions are moved to engage in.” Colo. Christian Univ. \nv. Weaver, 534 F.3d 1245, 1259 (10th Cir. 2008) (McConnell, J.).  Because religious liberty \nencompasses not only the freedom of religious belief, but also the freedom to adopt different \npractices  and  institutional  structures,  official  favoritism  for  certain  “types”  of  religious \ninstitutions is just as insidious as favoritism based on creed. \nFor example, in Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228 (1982), the Supreme Court struck down \na Minnesota law imposing special registration requirements on any religious organization that \ndid  not  “receive[]  more  than  half  of  [its]  total  contributions  from  members  or  affiliated \norganizations.”  Id. at 231-32.  The state defended the law on the ground that it was facially \nneutral and merely had a disparate impact on some religious groups.  The Court, however, \nrejected that argument, finding that the law discriminated among denominations by privileging \n“well-established churches that have achieved strong but not total financial support from their \nmembers,” while disadvantaging “churches which are new and lacking in a constituency, or \nwhich, as a matter of policy, may favor public solicitation over general reliance on financial \nsupport from members.”  Id. at 246 n.23 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The D.C. Circuit \nhas followed similar reasoning, stating that “an exemption solely for ‘pervasively sectarian’ \nschools would itself raise First Amendment concerns—discriminating between kinds of religious \nschools.”  Univ. of Great Falls v. NLRB, 278 F.3d 1335, 1342 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (emphasis \nadded). \nHere, the Mandate violates this principle of neutrality by establishing an official category \nof “religious employer” that favors some religious groups over others.  The exemption is defined \nto  include  only  “nonprofit  organization[s]  described  in  section  6033(a)(1)  and  section \n  -39-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 40 of 47 PageID #:  93\n6033(a)(3)(A)(i)  or  (iii)  of  the  [Internal  Revenue]  Code  [of  1986, a s  amended].”  As  the \nGovernment has explained, those provisions of the tax code include only “churches, synagogues, \nmosques, and other houses of worship, and religious orders.”  78 Fed. Reg. at 8,461.  This \ndefinition favors religious groups that fit into the traditional categories of “houses of worship” or \n“religious  orders,”  while  disadvantaging  groups  that  exercise  their  religious  faith  through \nalternative  means—including  religious  ministries,  like  Plaintiffs  Catholic  Charities,  which \nexpresses its faith by providing other various charitable services to the elderly, poor, and needy \nand educating young people. \n2.  Excessive Entanglement \n“It is well established . . . that courts should refrain from trolling through a person’s or \ninstitution’s religious beliefs.” Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. 793, 828 (2000). “It is not only the \nconclusions that may be reached . . . which may impinge on rights guaranteed by the Religion \nClauses, but also the very process of inquiry leading to findings and conclusions.”  NLRB v. \nCatholic  Bishop  of  Chi.,  440  U.S.  490,  502  (1979).  “Most  often,  this  principle  has  been \nexpressed  in  terms  of  a  prohibition  of  ‘excessive  entanglement’  between  religion  and \ngovernment.” Colo. Christian, 534 F.3d at 1261 (citing Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203 (1997)). \n“Properly understood, the doctrine protects religious institutions from governmental monitoring \nor second-guessing of their religious beliefs and practices, whether as a condition to receiving \nbenefits . . . or as a basis for regulation or exclusion from benefits (as here).” Colo. Christian, \n534  F.3d  at  1261  (citing  Carl  H.  Esbeck,  Establishment  Clause  Limits  on  Governmental \nInterference with Religious Organizations, 41 WASH. & LEE L. REV. 347, 397 (1984)). \nIn  determining  eligibility  for  a  religious  exemption,  the  Government  may  not  ask \nintrusive questions designed to determine whether a group is “sufficiently religious,” Univ. of \n  -40-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 41 of 47 PageID #:  94\nGreat Falls, 278 F.3d at 1343, or even whether the group has a “substantial religious character.” \nId. at 1344.  Rather, any inquiry into a group’s eligibility for a religious exemption must be \nlimited to determining whether the group is a “bona fide religious institution[].” Id. at 1343-45 \n(approving of a religious exemption that would include any non-profit group that “holds itself \nout” as religious, but reserving the question of whether groups could be required to show that \nthey are “affiliated with . . . a recognized religious organization”). \nHere, the Government’s criteria for the “religious employer” exemption go far beyond \ndetermining bona fide religious status.  By its terms, the exemption applies to groups that are \n“described in section 6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the [Internal Revenue] \nCode.”  This category includes (i) “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or \nassociations of churches,” and (iii) “the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.” \n78 Fed. Reg. at 8,458. The IRS, however, has adopted an intrusive 14-factor test to determine \nwhether a group meets these criteria. See Found. of Human Understanding v. United States, 88 \nFed. Cl. 203, 220 (Fed. Cl. 2009). The fourteen (14) criteria ask whether a religious group has: \n(1) a distinct legal existence; (2) a recognized creed and form of worship; \n(3) a definite and distinct ecclesiastical government; (4) a formal code of \ndoctrine and discipline; (5) a distinct religious history; (6) a membership \nnot associated with any church or denomination; (7) an organization of \nordained  ministers;  (8)  ordained  ministers  selected  after  completing \nprescribed studies; (9) a literature of its own; (10) established places of \nworship; (11) regular congregations; (12) regular religious services; (13) \nSunday schools for the religious instruction of the young; and (14) schools \nfor the preparation of its ministers. \n \nId. (citing Church of the Visible Intelligence v. United States, 4 Cl. Ct. 55, 64 (1983)). \n  Not only do these factors favor some religious groups over others, but they do so on the \nbasis of intrusive judgments regarding religious beliefs, practices, and organizational structure. \nFor example, probing into whether a group has “a recognized creed and form of worship” not \n  -41-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 42 of 47 PageID #:  95\nonly requires the Government to determine which belief systems will be deemed “recognized \ncreed[s],” but also demands inquiry into which practices qualify as “forms of worship.”  In \nanswering such questions, the Government cannot escape being “cast in the role of arbiter of \n[an] essentially religious dispute.” New York v. Cathedral Acad., 434 U.S. 125, 132-33 (1977). \nSimilarly, in determining whether a religious group has had “a distinct religious history,” \nthe  exemption  not  only  favors  long-established  religious  groups,  but  also  requires  the \nGovernment to probe into potentially disputed matters of religious history.  Any dispute as to \nwhether a group’s history is sufficiently “distinct” or “religious,” should not be resolved by the \nGovernment. \nIndeed, “church and state litigating in court about what does or does not have religious \nmeaning touches the very core of the constitutional guarantee against religious establishment.” \nId. at 133. \nE.  The Mandate Unconstitutionally Interferes with Plaintiffs’ Rights of \nInternal Church Governance \n \nThe Supreme Court has recognized that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment \nprohibit  the  Government  from  interfering  with  matters  of  internal  church  governance.  In \nHosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v. EEOC, 132 S.Ct. 694 (2012), the \nCourt  held  that  the  Government  may  not  apply  anti-discrimination  laws  to  interfere  with \nreligious groups in the hiring and firing of ministers because the First Amendment prohibits \n“government interference with an internal church decision that affects the faith and mission of \nthe church itself.” Id. at 707. Indeed, because “the autonomy of religious groups . . . has often \nserved  as  a  shield  against  oppressive  civil  laws,”  the  Court  has  “long  recognized  that  the \nReligion Clauses protect a private sphere within which religious bodies are free to govern \nthemselves in accordance with their own beliefs.” Id. at 712 (Alito, J., concurring). \n  -42-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 43 of 47 PageID #:  96\nHere, the Mandate violates this principle by artificially splitting the Catholic Church in \ntwo and preventing the Church from exercising supervisory authority over its constituents in a \nway that ensures compliance with Church teachings. See Guillory Decl. ¶¶ 15-26.  In particular, \nthe religious employer definition treats the Catholic Church as having two wings—a religious \none and a charitable one—and treats only the former as a religious employer, when, in fact, the \nChurch’s religious and charitable arms are one and the same: “The Church cannot neglect the \nservice of charity anymore than she can neglect the sacraments and the word.” USCCB’s Papal \nVisit Blog, “Benedict XVI’s Plea: Put the Poor at the Heart of Catholic Life” (Mar. 25, 2008) \n(Ex. H). Thus, by refusing to recognize the Church’s charitable functions as those of a single, \nintegrated “religious employer,” the Mandate directly interferes with Catholic Church structure.  \nSee also Zubik/Persico Slip Op. at 53 (holding that by dividing the Catholic Church into a \n“worship arm” and a “good works arm[]”, “[t]he Government has created a substantial burden on \nPlaintiffs’ right to freely exercise their religious beliefs”); id. at 50-52. \nThe Mandate, moreover, compounds this error by interfering with the Church hierarchy’s \nability  to  ensure  that  subordinate  institutions,  including  various  charitable  and  educational \nministries, adhere to Church teaching through participation in a single insurance plan.  Such an \narrangement is currently in place in the Beaumont Diocese, where the Diocese makes its health \nplan available to the employees of its religious affiliate, Catholic Charities.  By serving as the \ninsurance provider for this organization, the Diocese can directly ensure that this organization \noffers its employees a health plan that is in all ways consistent with Catholic beliefs as the \nPlaintiffs carry out their mission in accordance with their Catholic beliefs.  The Mandate disrupts \nthis internal arrangement by forcing the Diocese to either sponsor a plan that will provide the \nemployees of Catholic Charities with access to “free” abortion-inducing products, contraception, \n  -43-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 44 of 47 PageID #:  97\nsterilization,  and  related  counseling;  or,  expel  Catholic  Charities  from  the  Diocese’s  plan, \nthereby forcing it to enter into a different contract for the objectionable coverage. \nII.  PLAINTIFFS ARE SUFFERING ONGOING IRREPARABLE HARM \n \nPlaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief because the Mandate is causing them substantial \nirreparable harm.  “It is well settled that ‘[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.’” Tyndale, 904 F. Supp. \n2d at 129 (D.D.C. 2012) (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)) appeal dismissed, \nNo. 13-5018, 2013 WL 2395168 (D.C. Cir. May 3, 2013). “By extension, the same is true of \nrights afforded under the RFRA, which covers the same types of rights as those protected under \nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.”  Id. (citing O Centro Espirita Beneficente \nUniao Do Vegetal v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 973, 995 (10th Cir. 2004), aff’d 546 U.S. 418 (2006)) \n(“[The plaintiff] would certainly suffer an irreparable harm, assuming of course that it is likely to \nsucceed on the merits of its RFRA claim.”)); cf. Jeffreys v. My Friend’s Place, Inc., 719 F. Supp. \n639, 647-48 (M.D. Tenn. 1989) (citing EEOC v. Chrysler Corp., 733 F.2d 1183, 1186 (6th Cir. \n1984)). \nThe forced violation of Plaintiffs’ faith is the epitome of irreparable injury. See, e.g., \nMobil Oil Corp. v. Henriksen Enters., 490 F. Supp. 74, 77 ( W.D. Mich. 1980) (holding that \nirreparable harm occurs when monetary damages are inadequate).  The Mandate forces Plaintiffs \nto violate central tenets of their religious beliefs. See Guillory Decl. ¶¶ 15-26; Fernandez Decl. \n¶¶ 16-24.  Absent an injunction, the Government  can begin enforcing the Mandate against \nPlaintiffs before the final resolution of this case, while there is a serious question as to whether \nthe Mandate violates the Constitution and other  applicable law.  Thus, every moment that \npasses  without  relief  inflicts  ongoing  irreparable  harm  to  Plaintiffs’  religious  freedoms, \n  -44-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 45 of 47 PageID #:  98\nconfronting them with the impossible choice of violating their religious beliefs or violating the \nlaw. Because this is not the type of harm that can later be remedied by monetary damages, the \ninjury is irreparable.  See Mobil Oil Corp., 490 F. Supp. at 77; Roland Mach. Co. v. Dresser \nIndus., Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 386 (7th Cir. 1984) (“[Irreparable] harm . . . cannot be prevented or \nfully rectified by the final judgment after trial.”). \nIII.  THE BALANCE OF HARMS WEIGHS IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFFS \n \nAny harm that may result from granting preliminary relief to Plaintiffs necessarily “pales \nin comparison” to the serious harms to their religious freedoms that will be continued absent that \nrelief. Newland, 881 F. Supp. 2d at 1295. On the one hand, as described above, enforcement of \nthe  Mandate  will  plainly  cause  Plaintiffs  irreparable  harm by  forcing  them to  violate their \nreligious beliefs of pay oppressive fines until the merits of this suit are conclusively resolved. \nOn the other hand, preliminary relief would not cause the Government appreciable harm \nbecause it has not mandated contraceptive coverage for over two centuries, and there is no urgent \nneed to  enforce the Mandate against Catholic groups before its legality can be adjudicated. In \naddition,  given  that  the  Mandate  already  contains  exemptions  that  by  some  estimates  are \navailable  to  “over  190  million  health  plan  participants  and  beneficiaries,”  Id.  at  1298, t he \nGovernment cannot  possibly claim that it will be harmed by this Court granting a temporary \nexemption for Plaintiffs. \nIndeed, any claim of harm is fatally undermined by the Government’s acquiescence to \npreliminary injunctive relief in several other cases challenging the Mandate.  See, e.g., Sharpe \nHoldings, Inc. v. HHS, No. 2:12-cv-00092 (E.D. Mo. Mar. 11, 2013) (Dkt. 41); Sioux Chief Mfg. \nCo. v. Sebelius, No. 4:13-cv-0036 (W.D. Mo. Feb. 28, 2013) (Dkt. 9); Hall v. Sebelius, No. 13- \n0295 (D. Minn. Apr. 2, 2013) (Dkt. 11); Bick Holding, Inc. v. Sebelius, No. 4:13-cv-00462 (E.D. \n  -45-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 46 of 47 PageID #:  99\nMo. Apr. 1, 2013) (Dkt. 19).  The Government “cannot claim irreparable harm in this case while \nacquiescing to preliminary injunctive relief in several similar cases.”  Geneva Coll. v. Sebelius, \nNo. 2:12-cv-00207, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56087, at *41 (W.D. Pa. Apr. 19, 2013).  \nIn short, when balanced against the irreparable injury to Plaintiffs if the Mandate is \nenforced, any harm the Government might claim from a temporary injunction is de minimus. \nIV.  GRANTING A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION WILL SERVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST \n \nPreliminary relief also serves the public interest.  For one thing, the Sixth Circuit has \nrecognized that “it is always in the public interest to prevent violation of a party’s constitutional \nrights.”  Deja Vu, 274 F.3d at 400 (quoting G  & V Lounge, Inc.  v. Mich. Liquor Control \nComm’n, 23 F.3d 1071, 1079 (6th Cir. 1994)).  This same reasoning should also apply to the \nrights protected by RFRA, which is meant to give religious exercise even greater protection than \nthat provided under the First Amendment.  Cf., e.g., Kikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d 950, 963 \n(10th Cir. 2001). In particular, there is a “strong public interest in a citizen’s free exercise of \nreligion, a public interest clearly recognized by Congress when it enacted RFRA.”  O Centro, \n389 F.3d at 1010, aff’d 546 U.S. 418 (2006). \nHere, public interest in a preliminary injunction is especially high because enforcement \nof the Mandate will threaten or diminish the continuation of Plaintiffs’ charitable, health care, \nchildcare, and educational activities, which serve thousands of needy individuals.  See Guillory \nDecl. ¶¶ 15-26; Fernandez Decl. ¶¶ 16-24.  If the Government goes ahead with the enforcement \nof the Mandate, Plaintiffs may be forced to shut down or restructure their operations, leaving a \ngap in the network of critical social services relied on by so many in their communities.  By \ncontrast, no public harm would come from simply preserving the status quo pending further \nlitigation. Even if the public interest were served by widespread free access to abortion-inducing \n  -46-   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 47 of 47 PageID #:  100\nproducts, contraception, and  sterilization—a highly dubious assumption—these products and \nservices are widely available, and the Government has adduced no evidence that the Mandate \nwill make them more widely available in the relatively short period of time that will be required \nto adjudicate this case on the merits. \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court adjudicate this \nmotion  on a n  expedited  basis  and  grant  Plaintiffs’  request  for  a  preliminary  injunction \nexempting Plaintiffs from application of, and enforcement of, compliance with the Mandate. \n \n          By:  /s/ Randal G.

As \nBishop, I am responsible for the Diocese. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3-1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 2 of 6 PageID #:  102\n3.  I am very familiar with the Diocese’s mission, religious beliefs, and the Diocese’s \nhealth insurance policy.  The facts in this declaration are based upon my personal knowledge and \ninformation available to me, and if I were called upon to testify to them, I could and would \ncompetently do so. \n4.  The  Diocese  is  a  nonprofit  religious  organization  organized  and  existing \naccording to the Code of Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church and recognized by the State \nof Texas. \n5.  The Diocese employs over 950 people, approximately 370 of whom are currently \neligible for health plan benefits offered through the Diocese.   \n6.  The  Diocese  carries  out  a t ripartite  spiritual,  educational,  and  social  service \nmission, reflecting the several dimensions of its ministry.  This mission is rooted in and animated \nby the  Roman Catholic faith, shared by all parishioners in our parishes and schools.   \n7.  The spiritual ministry of the Diocese is conducted largely through its parishes.  \nThrough the ministry of its priests, the Diocese ensures the regular availability of the sacraments \nto all Catholics living in or visiting Beaumont and the surrounding 9 counties.   \n8.   The educational ministry of the Diocese is conducted through its schools and \nReligious Education Programs.  The Diocese includes 3 Parish schools and 2 diocesan schools \nthat serve approximately 1,088 students.  The Religious Education Programs in our 44 parishes \nand 7 missions serve over 6,304 children.  \n9.  Much of the Diocese’s social service and charitable work is performed through its \nparishes and missions, which, like the schools discussed above, are organized as part of the \nDiocese.   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3-1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 3 of 6 PageID #:  103\n10.  Furthermore,  the  Diocese  also  provides  services  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable \nthrough  an  independent  entity,  Catholic  Charities  of  Southeast  Texas  (which  is  separately \nincorporated) that is closely aligned with the Church and comports itself in accordance with \nChurch teaching.  Catholic Charities employs 18 people, 9 of whom are currently eligible for \ncoverage on the diocesan health plan.    \n11.  Consistent with Church teachings on social justice, the Diocese makes health \ninsurance benefits available to its religious personnel, seminarians, and full-time employees \nworking at least 30 hours a week through the diocesan health plan.  \n12.  The Diocese is part of the Roman Catholic Church.  The Church teaches that life \nbegins at the moment of conception, that sexual union should be reserved to committed marital \nrelationships in which the husband and wife are open to the transmission of life, and, therefore, \nthat artificial interference with life and conception are immoral.  \n13.  Offering a health insurance plan that provides coverage for or facilitates access to \nabortion-inducing products, contraceptives, sterilization, and related education and counseling is \nthus inconsistent with the core moral and religious beliefs of the Diocese.    \n14.   The Diocese provides its employees’ health plan through the Christian Brothers \nEmployee Benefit Trust, a self-funded church plan which serves employers of the Catholic \nChurch  by  providing  medical  benefits  to  health  plan  participants.    Health  plan  materials \nspecifically state that “the Trust works within the framework of the tenets of the Catholic \nChurch.”  To that end, the Trust health plan does not cover abortion or sterilization drugs or \nservices, nor does it cover contraceptives except when prescribed to treat a medical illness and \napproved by the Trust.  \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3-1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 4 of 6 PageID #:  104\n15.  The Diocese’s employee health plan does not meet the Affordable Care Act’s \ndefinition of a “grandfathered” plan.   \n16.  The plan year for the Diocese (and Catholic Charities as an adopting employer) \nbegins on March 1. \n17.  The Mandate requires employers, on pain of substantial financial penalties, to \nfacilitate  access  to  abortion-inducing  products,  artificial  contraception,  medical  sterilization \nprocedures, and related counseling through their employer health-care plans.  \n18.  Consistent with Church teachings regarding the sanctity of life, the diocesan \nhealth plan has historically excluded coverage for abortion, contraceptives (except when used for \nnon-contraceptive purposes), sterilization, and related education and counseling.    \n19.  Though the Diocese meets the Mandate’s definition of a religious employer and is \nthus  exempt  from  facilitating  access  to  the  mandated  products  and  services  for  its  own \nemployees, this exemption does not apply to the employees of non-exempt, affiliated entities \nsuch as Catholic Charities which participates in the Diocesan Employee Health Plan. \n20.  Catholic Charities is charged by the Diocese of Beaumont to defend and insure \nthe preservation of human dignity by reflecting the values and tenets of the Catholic Church, \nwhile showing no preference for any particular religion when serving those in need.  In my \ncapacity as Bishop of the Diocese, I am responsible for the adherence by Catholic Charities to \nthe teachings and beliefs of the Roman Catholic Church.  \n21.  The Mandate artificially splits the Diocese (and the Catholic Church for that \nmatter) in two:  a religious wing and a charitable wing.  The former is to be exempt from the \nMandate and the latter is not—preventing the Diocese from exercising supervisory authority over \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3-1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 5 of 6 PageID #:  105\nits constituent Catholic Charities in a way that ensures compliance with Church teachings and \nbeliefs. \n22.  The Mandate thus interferes with the Church’s ability to ensure that its various \ncharitable and educational ministries adhere to Church teaching through participation in a single \ninsurance plan.  By serving as the insurance provider for Catholic Charities, the Diocese can \ndirectly ensure that Catholic Charities offers its employees a health plan that is in all ways \nconsistent with Catholic beliefs.   \n23.  The Mandate disrupts this internal arrangement by forcing the Diocese to either (i) \nfacilitate, through its insurance plan, the provision of contraception, abortion-inducing products, \nsterilization, and related counseling to employees of Catholic Charities (a non-exempt entity) \nfrom participating in the Diocese’s plans; or (ii) expel Catholic Charities from its plans, thereby \nforcing it as a non-exempt organizations to enter into an arrangement with another insurance \nprovider or third-party administrator that will, in turn, be required to provide the objectionable \nproducts and services to their employees. \n24.  The first option forces the Diocese to act contrary to its sincerely-held religious \nbeliefs.   T he  second  option  not  only  makes  the  Diocese  complicit  in  the  provision  of \nobjectionable  coverage,  by  forcing  Catholic  Charities  out  of  its  plan  and  to  obtain  the \nobjectionable coverage through another insurance provider, but also compels the Diocese to \nsubmit to the Government’s interference with its structure and internal operations by accepting a \nconstruct that divides churches from their ministries. \n25.  Moreover, as a Catholic entity, the Diocese bears a particular responsibility to \nwitness to the Church’s teachings.  The Diocese bears witness to those teachings not only by \nword,  but  also  by  deed,  including  its  actions  regarding  the  provision  of  employee  health \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3-1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 6 of 6 PageID #:  106\ninsurance.  Were the Diocese to sponsor a plan that triggered the provision of objectionable \nproducts and services to the employees of its affiliated entities or expel those organizations from \nits plan, the Diocese would commit the further offense of giving scandal by acting in a way \ninconsistent with Church teachings. \n26.  Taking action that would trigger the provision of the objectionable products and \nservices for the employees of its affiliated entities would be contrary to the Diocese’s beliefs \neven if the Diocese does not directly fund the objectionable coverage.  Of course, any use of the \nDiocese’s  funds to  provide the mandated products and services would only exacerbate the \nviolation of the Diocese’s religious beliefs. \n27.  The Diocese provides health benefits to its employees because it follows the \nCatholic social teaching that health care is among those basic rights which flow from the sanctity \nand dignity of human life.  To drop health care benefits—in order to avoid the provision of \nobjectionable drugs and services—would  inhibit the Diocese’s ability to follow this teaching. \n28.  Potential liability for significant fines and uncertainty regarding the Diocese’s \nability to offer and provide health benefits undermines Diocese’s ability to retain and recruit \nemployees.  Were the Diocese to stop offering health benefits, it would be at a competitive \ndisadvantage to institutions to who do not have religious objections to the Mandate. \n29.  The Mandate places substantial pressure on the Diocese to violate its sincerely \nheld religious beliefs by threatening fines and other negative consequences if the Diocese refuses \nto facilitate access to the objectionable products and services.  \n30.  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nExecuted on December 10, 2013 \n            /s/ Curtis J. Guillory \n            Bishop Curtis J.

I am over the age of eighteen (18) and competent to make this statement.  I submit \nthis  declaration  in  support  of  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  Temporary  Restraining  Order  and  for \nPreliminary Injunction in the above-captioned matter. \n2.  I  am  the  President  and  CEO  of  Catholic  Charities  of  Southeast  Texas,  Inc. \n(“Catholic Charities”).  I have served in this capacity since 2009.  I began my service in the \nCatholic Charities network in 2007.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3-2   Filed 12/10/13   Page 2 of 6 PageID #:  108\n3.  Due to my responsibilities as President and CEO, I am very familiar with Catholic \nCharities’ mission, religious beliefs, and health insurance policy.  The facts set forth in this \ndeclaration are based upon my personal knowledge and information available to me, and if I \nwere called upon to testify to them, I could and would competently do so. \n4.  Catholic Charities annually provides services to approximately 6,000 people.  It \n“is a faith-driven, service-driven, and forward-driven organization committed to living out the \ncommission of Jesus Christ throughout the Diocese of Beaumont by welcoming the stranger, \ncaring for children, and strengthening families.” \n5.  To that end, it carries out the mandates of the Gospel and the social teaching of \nthe  Church  through  works  of  Christian  charity,  service,  and  social  justice  by  providing \ncompetent and caring social services, special assistance to those in great need, and programs of \ncommunity  outreach  and  advocacy  using  the  skills  and  talents  of  professional  staff  and \nvolunteers.   C atholic  Charities  pursues  these  goals  through  its  own  programs  and  through \npartnerships with parishes, community groups, and governmental agencies.   \n6.  The  seven  programs  of  Catholic  Charities  bring  child  and  family  services, \nemergency assistance, financial and homebuyer education, daily food service, immigration legal \nassistance, grief support and counseling services to the community.   \n7.  Catholic Charities has  ten full-time and seven part-time employees.   \n8.  Catholic Charities is a member-director corporation.  \n9.  I am informed that Catholic Charities does not qualify as an entity described in \nsection 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Accordingly, Catholic Charities \ndoes  not  qualify  as  a  “religious  employer”  under  the  exemption  to  the  U.S.  Government \nMandate. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3-2   Filed 12/10/13   Page 3 of 6 PageID #:  109\n10.  Catholic Charities employees are offered health insurance through the Diocese of \nBeaumont.  The plan does not cover abortion, contraceptives, or sterilization. \n11.  Due to plan changes in 2010 and 2011, the group health insurance plan offered to \nCatholic  Charities  employees  through  the  Diocese  does  not  meet  the  definition  of  a \n“grandfathered” plan within the meaning of the Affordable Care Act.  Additionally, Catholic \nCharities has not included a statement in plan materials provided to participants or beneficiaries \ninforming them that it believes its plan is a grandfathered health plan within the meaning of \nsection 1251 of the Affordable Care Act. \n12.  Catholic Charities’ plan year begins March 1. \n13.  Catholic Charities’ Catholic faith is at the heart of its charitable mission.  The \nCatholic Church teaches that life begins at the moment of conception, that sexual union should \nbe reserved to committed marital relationships in which the husband and wife are open to the \ntransmission  of  life,  and,  therefore,  that  artificial  interference  with  life  and  conception  are \nimmoral.  Accordingly, Catholic Charities will never provide the objectionable services to its \nemployees because each such service violates Catholic teachings.  \n14.  Catholic Charities is required by the Mandate  to facilitate access to abortion-\ninducing  products,  artificial  contraception,  medical  sterilization  procedures,  and  related \ncounseling through their employer health-care plan.  \n15.  The so-called “accommodation” does not resolve Catholic Charities’ religious \nobjection.  The Mandate, even in its revised form, forces Catholic Charities to take actions that \nfacilitate access to products and services antithetical to the Catholic faith.  Among other things, \nCatholic  Charities’  employees  would  only  receive  free  contraceptives,  sterilization, \nabortifacients, and related counseling by virtue of Catholic Charities’ decision to provide health \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3-2   Filed 12/10/13   Page 4 of 6 PageID #:  110\ncoverage.  Catholic Charities would also be required to self-certify its religious objection, which \nwill trigger the provision of the mandated coverage.  This mandated coverage will be made \navailable to the Catholic Charities’ employees only for so long as they remain on the Diocese of \nBeaumont’s plan.  Catholic Charities will be forced to further facilitate access to the mandated \ncoverage by, among other things, identifying its benefits-eligible employees for the insurance \ncompany.  Ultimately, under both the original and final versions of the Mandate, Catholic \nCharities is forced, in violation of its sincerely held religious beliefs, to participate in a scheme \nthat provides its employees with access to contraceptive benefits.   \n16.  Moreover, as a Catholic entity, Catholic Charities bears a particular responsibility \nto witness to the Church’s teachings.  Catholic Charities bears witness to those teachings not \nonly by word, but also by deed, including its actions regarding the provision of employee health \ninsurance.  Were Catholic Charities to comply with the Mandate, in addition to impermissibly \nfacilitating access to the objectionable products and services, Catholic Charities would commit \nthe further offense of giving scandal by acting in a way inconsistent with Church teachings. \n17.  Compliance with the Mandate would be contrary to Catholic Charities’ beliefs \neven in the event that Catholic Charities does not directly fund the objectionable products and \nservices.  Of course, any use of Catholic Charities’ funds to provide the mandated products and \nservices would only exacerbate the violation of Catholic Charities’ religious beliefs.  \n18.  There  is  no  resolution  to  the  dilemma  created  by  the  Mandate  for  Catholic \nCharities.  Even eliminating the employee group health plan in its entirety fails to resolve the \ninjuries to Catholic Charities caused by the implementation of the Mandate. If Catholic Charities \nceases  offering  employee  health  plans  or  fails  to  provide  the  required  coverage,  Catholic \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3-2   Filed 12/10/13   Page 5 of 6 PageID #:  111\nCharities will face fines of $2,000 per employee after the first thirty (30) employees per year or \n$100 per individual per day. \n19.  Potential  liability  for  significant  fines  and  uncertainty  regarding  Catholic \nCharities’ ability to offer and provide health benefits undermines Catholic Charities’ ability to \nrecruit and retain employees.  Were Catholic Charities to stop offering health benefits, it would \nbe at a competitive disadvantage to institutions who do not have religious objections to the \nMandate. \n20.  The  Mandate  places  substantial  pressure  on  Catholic  Charities  to  violate  its \nsincerely held religious beliefs by threatening fines and other negative consequences if Catholic \nCharities refuses to facilitate access to the objectionable products and services.  \n21.  Catholic Charities is further harmed by the Mandate’s attempt at creating an \nartificial separation between Catholic Charities from the Catholic Church and, in particular, the \nDiocese of Beaumont.  \n22.  Catholic Charities is the social justice arm of the church. Each year, Catholic \nCharities receives funding from the Diocese through an annual appeal. \n23.  Despite being inextricably connected to the Church and the Diocese, and being \ngoverned by the Church’s mission and beliefs, Catholic Charities falls outside the scope of the \nso-called “religious employer” exemption, leaving it without protection from the Mandate’s \nrequirements.     \n24.  The Mandate splits the Catholic Church in two, a religious wing and a charitable \nwing, the former which is exempt from the Mandate and the latter which is not—preventing the \nChurch  from  exercising  supervisory  authority  over  its  constituents  in  a  way  that  ensures \ncompliance with Church teachings.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3-2   Filed 12/10/13   Page 6 of 6 PageID #:  112\n25.

Plaintiffs allege that regulations promulgated by Defendants require Plaintiffs to provide, \nas  part of  a  company-funded health insurance  plan, to facilitate access to abortion-\ninducing  products,  artificial  contraception,  sterilization  procedures,  and  related \ncounseling. \n2.  Defendants’ Mandate is contained in 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3-3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 2 of 4 PageID #:  114\n3.  Without injunctive relief from the Court, Plaintiffs will suffer immediate and irreparable \nharm. Defendants’ Mandate will not permit Plaintiffs to continue to have an employee \nheath  benefits  plan  that  excludes  any  coverage  for  to  abortion-inducing  products, \nartificial contraception, sterilization procedures, and related counseling based on their \nreligious beliefs and moral values.   \n4.  Defendants’ Mandate permits exemptions for some classes of religious objectors, but not \norganization such as Plaintiffs, including Catholic Charities of Southeast Texas, Inc. \n5.  The  requirements  of  the  Mandate  substantially  burden  Plaintiffs’  exercise  of  their \nreligious beliefs.   \n6.  The Mandate is not justified by a compelling governmental interest. \n7.  The Mandate is not the least restrictive means to further any compelling governmental \ninterest. \n8.  Plaintiffs have demonstrated a credible argument and evidence that there is a substantial \nlikelihood that Plaintiffs will succeed on the merits of the claim. \n9.  Plaintiffs have demonstrated that Defendants will not suffer any harm or costs by this \nCourt  granting  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  temporary  restraining  order  and  preliminary \ninjunction and that the balance of equities tips in Plaintiffs’ favor. \n10. Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the public interest will be served and not harmed by the \ngranting of the requested injunctive relief. \n11. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law other than obtaining a declaratory judgment \nand injunctive relief.   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 3-3   Filed 12/10/13   Page 3 of 4 PageID #:  115\n12.

This lawsuit is about one of America’s most cherished freedoms: the freedom to \npractice one’s religion without government interference.  It is not about whether people have a \nright to abortion-inducing products, sterilization, and contraception.  Those products and services \nare widely available in the United States, and nothing prevents the Government itself from \nmaking  them  more  widely  available.   H ere,  however,  the  Government  seeks  to  require \nPlaintiffs—all of which are Catholic entities—to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs by \nproviding, paying for, and/or facilitating access to those products and services.  American history \nand  tradition,  embodied  in  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  and  the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), safeguard religious entities from such overbearing \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 2 of 47 PageID #:  2\nand oppressive governmental action.  Plaintiffs therefore seek relief in this Court to protect this \nmost fundamental of American rights. \n2.  Plaintiffs  provide  a  wide  range  of  spiritual,  educational,  and  social  services  to \nmembers of their communities, Catholic and non-Catholic alike.  Plaintiff Catholic Diocese of \nBeaumont (the “Diocese”), not only provides pastoral care and spiritual guidance for thousands of \nCatholics, but also provides education and essential social ministry to thousands of Catholics and \nnon-Catholics throughout the nine East Texas counties.  As an extension of the Diocese’s mission \nof Catholic ministry, Plaintiff Catholic Charities of Southeast Texas, Inc. (“Catholic Charities”) \noffers a host of social services to thousands in need throughout those same nine East Texas \ncounties.   \n3.  Plaintiffs’ work is in every respect guided by and consistent with Roman Catholic \nbelief, including the requirement that they serve those in need, regardless of their religion.  This is \nperhaps best captured by words attributed to St. Francis of Assisi: “Preach the Gospel at all times.  \nUse words if necessary.”  As Pope Benedict XVI has more recently put it, “[L]ove for widows \nand orphans, prisoners, and the sick and needy of every kind, is as essential to [the Catholic \nChurch] as the ministry of the sacraments and preaching of the Gospel.  The Church cannot \nneglect the service of charity any more than she can neglect the Sacraments and the Word.”  As \nPlaintiff Catholic Charities notes, “We like to say that we serve people because of our faith, not \ntheirs. Our faith calls us to serve others, regardless of their personal faith traditions.”  Thus, \nCatholic individuals and organizations consistently work to create a more just community by \nserving any and all neighbors in need. \n4.  Catholic Church teachings also uphold the firm conviction that sexual union should \nbe reserved to married couples who are open to the creation of life; thus, artificial interference \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 3 of 47 PageID #:  3\nwith the creation of life, including through abortion, sterilization, and contraceptives, is contrary \nto Catholic doctrine. \n5.  Defendants have promulgated various rules (collectively, “the U.S. Government \nMandate”) that force Plaintiffs to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.  These rules, first \nproposed on July 19, 2010, require Plaintiffs and other Catholic and religious organizations to \nprovide,  pay  for,  and/or  facilitate  access  to  abortion-inducing  products,  sterilization,  and \ncontraception, in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs.  In response to the intense \npublic criticism that the Government’s original proposal provoked, including by some of the \ncurrent Administration’s most ardent supporters, the Government proposed changes to the rules \nthat, it asserted, were intended to eliminate the substantial burden that the Mandate imposed on \nreligious beliefs.  In fact, however, these changes made that burden worse by significantly \nincreasing the number of religious organizations subject to the U.S. Government Mandate, and \nby driving a wedge between religious organizations, such as Plaintiff Diocese, and equally \nreligious charitable and educational arms of the Church, such as Plaintiff Catholic Charities.   \n6.  In its final form, the U.S. Government Mandate contains three basic components: \n7.  First,  it  requires  employer  group  health  plans  to  cover,  without  cost-sharing \nrequirements, all “FDA-approved contraceptive methods and contraceptive counseling”—a term \nthat includes abortion-inducing products, contraception, sterilization, and related counseling and \neducation.    \n8.  Second, the Mandate creates a narrow exemption for certain “religious employers,” \ndefined to include only organizations that are “organized and operate[] as a nonprofit entity and \n[are] referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \namended.”  The referenced Code section does not, nor is it intended to, address religious liberty.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 4 of 47 PageID #:  4\nInstead, it is a paperwork-reduction provision that addresses whether and when tax-exempt \nnonprofit entities must file an annual informational tax return, known as a Form 990.  As the \nGovernment has repeatedly affirmed, this exemption is intended to protect only “the unique \nrelationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial positions.” 78 Fed. \nReg.  8,456, 8,461 ( Feb.  6, 2013) ;  see  also  78 F ed.  Reg.  39,870, 39,874 ( July  2, 2013) .  \nConsequently, the only organizations that qualify for the exemption are “churches, synagogues, \nmosques, and other houses of worship, and religious orders.”  78 Fed. Reg. at 8,461.  This is the \nnarrowest “conscience exemption” ever adopted in federal law.  It grants the Government broad \ndiscretion to sit in judgment of which groups qualify as “religious employers,” thus favoring \ncertain religious organizations over others and entangling the Government in matters of religious \nfaith and practice. \n9.  Third, the U.S. Government Mandate creates a second class of religious entities that, \nin the Government’s view, are not sufficiently “religious” to qualify for the “religious employer” \nexemption.  These religious entities, deemed “eligible organizations,” are subject to a so-called \n“accommodation” that is intended to eliminate the burden that the Mandate imposes on their \nreligious beliefs.  The “accommodation,” however, is illusory:  it continues to require “eligible \norganizations”  to  participate  in  a  new  employer-based  scheme  to  provide,  pay  for,  and/or \nfacilitate access by employees to products and services that are completely contrary to the \nfundamental beliefs of the organizations.    \n10.  Catholic Charities does not qualify under the Government’s narrow definition of \n“religious employers,” even though it is quintessentially a religious organization under any \nreasonable definition of the term.  Its very existence is dependent upon upholding all of the \ntenets of the Catholic faith in the social ministries it provides on behalf of the Diocese, and as \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 5 of 47 PageID #:  5\nrequired by the Diocese.  While Catholic Charities is an “eligible organizations” subject to the \nso-called “accommodation,” the “accommodation” does nothing to change the Government’s \nrequirement that Plaintiff enter into a contract with an insurance company which, as a direct \nresult, is required to provide or procure abortion-inducing products, contraception, sterilization, \nand related counseling for this Plaintiff’s employees.  Consequently, as religious organizations, \nPlaintiffs’ actions are the trigger and but-for cause of the provision of the objectionable products \nand services.  Plaintiffs cannot avoid facilitating the provision of the objectionable products and \nservices—for example,  by  contracting  with an  insurance company that will not provide or \nprocure the objectionable products and services or even dropping their health-insurance plans \naltogether—without subjecting themselves to crippling fines and/or lawsuits by individuals and \ngovernmental entities.   \n11.  Plaintiffs, moreover, must facilitate the provision of the objectionable services in \nother ways that further exacerbate their religiously impermissible cooperation in the provision of \nthe objectionable products and services.  For example, in order to be eligible for the so-called \n“accommodation,”  Plaintiff  Catholic  Charities  must  provide  (with  the  approval  of  Plaintiff \nDiocese) a “certification” to the insurance provider setting forth its religious objections to the \nMandate.  The provision of this “certification,” in turn, automatically triggers an obligation on \nthe part of the insurance provider to provide or procure the objectionable products and services \nfor  the  employees  of  the  Plaintiff  Catholic  Charities.   A   religious  organization’s  self-\ncertification,  therefore,  is  a  trigger  and  but-for  cause  of  the  provision  of  the  objectionable \nproducts and services.   \n12.  Indeed,  notwithstanding  the  “accommodation,”  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate \n“requires  the  objecting  religious  organization  to  fund  or  otherwise  facilitate  the  morally \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 6 of 47 PageID #:  6\nobjectionable coverage.”    Comments of U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishopa, at 3 (Mar. 20, \n2013),  available  at  http://www.usccb.org/about/general-counsel/rulemaking/upload/2013-\nNPRM-Comments-3-20-final.pdf.    The  Government  asserts  that  the  provision  of  the \nobjectionable products and services will be “cost-neutral.”   This assertion, however, ignores the \nregulatory and administrative costs that will inevitably force insurance companies and third-party \nadministrators  to  increase  the  prices  they  charge  religious  employers  subject  to  the \n“accommodation.”   T he  Government’s  assertion  of  “cost  neutrality”  is  also  based  on t he \nimplausible (and morally objectionable) assumption that “lower costs [from] fewer childbirths” \nwill offset the cost of the contraceptive services.  78 Fed. Reg. at 8463.  More importantly, even \nif the Government’s assumption were correct, it simply means that premiums previously going \ntoward childbirths will be redirected to contraceptive and related services in order to achieve the \n(objectionable) goal of “fewer childbirths.”   \n13.  In  short,  the  “accommodation”  requires  non-exempt  religious  organizations, \nincluding Plaintiffs, to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to abortion-inducing products, \ncontraception, sterilization, and related counseling, contrary to their sincerely-held religious \nbeliefs. \n14.  The Diocese appears to qualify as a “religious employer,” and, as such, is eligible \nfor the “religious employer” exemption from the Mandate.  However, the Diocese operates an \ninsurance plan that encompasses not only individuals directly employed by the Diocese itself, \nbut, in addition, individuals employed by Catholic Charities.  Because Catholic Charities does \nnot itself appear to qualify as an exempt “religious employer,” the Government’s newly minted \ninterpretation of the Mandate requires that the Diocese must either (1) sponsor a plan that will \nprovide, pay for, and/or facilitate the provision of the objectionable products and services to the \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 7 of 47 PageID #:  7\nemployees of Catholic Charities, or (2) no longer extend its plan to Catholic Charities, subjecting \nit to massive fines if it does not  contract with another insurance provider that will offer the \nobjectionable coverage.     \n15.  This  reflects  a  change  from  the  Government’s  original  interpretation  of  the \nMandate.  That interpretation allowed Catholic Charities to remain on the Diocese’s plan, which, \nin turn, would have shielded it from the Mandate if the Diocese were exempt.  See 77 Fed. Reg. \n16,501, 16,502 (Mar. 21, 2012).    T he Final Rule, in contrast, removes this protection and \nthereby increases the number of religious organizations subject to the Mandate.  And in so doing, \nthe Mandate seeks to divide the Catholic Church, artificially separating its “houses of worship” \nfrom its faith in action, directly contrary to Pope Benedict’s admonition that “[t]he Church cannot \nneglect the service of charity any more than she can neglect the Sacraments and the Word.”       \n16.  The U.S. Government Mandate is irreconcilable with the First Amendment, RFRA, \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, and other laws.  The Government has not demonstrated any \ncompelling interest in forcing Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to abortion-\ninducing products, sterilization, and contraception.  Nor has the Government demonstrated that \nthe U.S. Government Mandate is the least restrictive means of advancing any interest it has in \nincreasing access to these products and services, which are already widely available and which \nthe Government could make more widely available without conscripting Plaintiffs as vehicles for \nthe dissemination of products and services to which they so strongly object.  The Government, \ntherefore, cannot justify its decision to force Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access \nto these products and services in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 8 of 47 PageID #:  8\n17.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the U.S. Government Mandate cannot \nlawfully be applied to Plaintiffs, an injunction barring its enforcement, and an order vacating the \nMandate. \nI.  PRELIMINARY MATTERS  \n18.  Plaintiff Catholic Diocese of Beaumont is a nonprofit unincorporated religious \norganization organized and existing according to the Code of Canon Law of the Roman Catholic \nChurch and recognized by the State of Texas.  The Diocese includes Roman Catholic parishes, \nschools, and organizations in East Texas.  The principal office of the Diocese is located in \nBeaumont, Texas.  It is organized exclusively for charitable, religious, and educational purposes \nwithin the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. \n19.  Plaintiff Catholic Charities is a nonprofit corporation incorporated in the State of \nTexas.  Its principal place of business is in Beaumont, Texas.  It is organized exclusively for \ncharitable, religious, and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the \nInternal Revenue Code.   \n20.  Defendant Kathleen Sebelius is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services (“HHS”).  She is sued in her official capacity.   \n21.  Defendant Thomas Perez is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor.  He is \nsued in his official capacity.  \n22.  Defendant Jacob J. Lew is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  \nHe is sued in his official capacity.     \n23.  Defendant U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is an executive agency \nof the United States within the meaning of RFRA and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).   \n24.  Defendant U.S. Department of Labor is an executive agency of the United States \nwithin the meaning of RFRA and the APA.   \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 9 of 47 PageID #:  9\n25.  Defendant U.S. Department of the Treasury is an executive agency of the United \nStates within the meaning of RFRA and the APA.   \n26.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief under 5 U.S.C. § 702, 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, and 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1. \n27.  An  actual,  justiciable  controversy  currently  exists  between  Plaintiffs  and \nDefendants.    Absent  a  declaration  resolving  this  controversy  and  the  validity  of  the  U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, Plaintiffs will be required to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to \nobjectionable products and services in contravention of their sincerely held religious beliefs, as \ndescribed below. \n28.  Plaintiffs  have  no a dequate  or  available  administrative  remedy,  or,  in  the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n29.  This  Court  has  subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  this  action  under  28  U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1343(a)(4), and 1346(a)(2). \n30.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). \nA.  The Diocese \n31.  The Diocese encompasses forty-four parishes and seven missions and serves a \nregion  that  comprises  nine  counties  (spanning  8,392  square  miles)  in  East  Texas,  with  a \npopulation of approximately 628,794, including 73,672 Roman Catholics.  The counties within \nthe Diocese are Chambers, Hardin, Jasper, Jefferson, Liberty, Newton, Orange, Polk and Tyler.  \nThis region was originally served by The Catholic Diocese of Galveston, beginning in 1847, \nwhich was re-designated the Diocese of Galveston-Houston on July 25, 1959.  On September 29, \n1966, Pope Paul VI established the Diocese of Beaumont to serve these nine counties (as well as \nfour others which were later made part of the Diocese of Tyler, formed in 1986).  The parishes \nand missions of the Diocese and its five schools are part of the Diocese.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 10 of 47 PageID #:  10\n32.  The Most Rev. Curtis J. Guillory, S.V.D., D.D. (“Bishop Guillory”) is over the \nDiocese.    \n33.  Bishop Guillory is assisted in his ministry by a staff of numerous clergypersons, \nreligious brothers and sisters, and lay people.  The Diocese employs over 950 people, over 370 \nof who are currently eligible for health plan benefits offered through the Diocese.  The Diocese \nemploys Catholic and non-Catholic persons, and it does not generally track how many of its \nemployees are Catholic, members of other religious faiths, or non-religious.  \n34.  The  Diocese  carries  out  a  tripartite  spiritual,  educational,  and  social  service \nmission, reflecting the several dimensions of its ministry.  The spiritual ministry of the Diocese \nis conducted largely through its parishes.  Through the ministry of its priests, the Diocese ensures \nthe regular availability of the sacraments to all Catholics, living or visiting, within its nine \ncounties.  It also provides numerous other opportunities for prayer, worship, and faith formation.  \nIn addition to overseeing the sacramental life of its parishes, the Diocese coordinates Catholic \ncampus ministry for the students at Lamar University, as well as other ministries throughout the \nregion.   \n35.  The Diocese conducts much of its educational mission through its schools.  The \nfirst Catholic school in Southeast Texas opened in 1895 in Beaumont (St. Anthony School).  \nWith a focus on faith formation, rigorous academics, and service to others, the Diocese’s schools \nare committed to assisting parents in preparing their children to meet the challenges of the \nmodern  world.    Students  of  diocesan  schools  are  provided  opportunities  to  develop  basic \nacademic and physical skills, to pursue knowledge, and to critically study and analyze the world \nin which they live.  The schools of the Diocese follow curriculum standards based upon national \nCatholic education standards, core curriculum standards, and the social teachings of the Catholic \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 11 of 47 PageID #:  11\nChurch.  Each of the five Catholic schools within the Diocese is fully accredited through the \nTexas Catholic Conference Accreditation Commission.  \n36.  There are five diocesan schools, which educate approximately 1532 high school \nand elementary students.  The Diocese and its parishes operate all five of these schools, which \nemploy approximately 232 teachers and other school staff.   \n37.  The schools of the Diocese offer a unique educational experience unlike any other \nin the area.  Diocesan schools have established three priorities that make them stand out from \nother educational institutions.  Students are taught faith—not just the basics of Christianity, but \nhow to have a relationship with God that will remain with them after they leave their Catholic \nschool.   S ervice,  the  giving  of  one’s  time  and  effort  to  help  others,  is  taught  as  both  a \nrequirement of faith and good citizenship.  Finally, high academic standards help each student \nreach his or her potential.  Nationally, over 99% of students in Catholic high schools graduate.   \n38.  The  Catholic  educational  system  has  demonstrated  a  particular  dedication  to \nteaching the underserved.  Indeed, diocesan schools welcome students in all financial conditions, \nfrom all backgrounds, and of any or no faith.  Twenty-nine percent of students in diocesan \nschools are from minority backgrounds, and twenty-two percent of diocesan students are not \nCatholic.  To make a Catholic education available to as many children as possible, the Diocese \nand its parishes and schools expend substantial funds in tuition assistance programs.  In addition, \nthe Diocese provides Catholic religious education in all of its 44 parishes to approximately 1,287 \npublic high school students and 5,017 elementary and middle public school children.     \n39.  Much of the social service and charitable work of the Diocese is performed \nthrough its 51 parishes and missions, which, like the six schools discussed above, are organized \nas part of the Diocese.  The parishes within the Diocese maintain their own charitable efforts, \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 12 of 47 PageID #:  12\nserving the needs of their communities with programs including food pantries for the poor, \nadopt-a-family programs at Christmas, meals served to the homeless, outreach and support for \nwomen in crisis pregnancies, health-care assistance programs, pastoral care to the sick, prisoner \nand immigrant ministry, and visits to nursing homes and hospitals.   \n40.  In  summary,  the  Diocese  of  Beaumont,  a  nonprofit  religious  organization \norganized and existing according to the Code of Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church and \nrecognized by the State of Texas, employs approximately 950 persons, over 370 of whom are \neligible for health plan benefits offered through the Diocese.  The Diocese includes five diocesan \nschools that serve approximately 1,532 students.  And through its parishes, the Diocese serves an \nindeterminate number of persons who are homeless, hungry, elderly, or otherwise in need of \nmaterial, educational, pastoral, or other assistance, without regard to religious belief.     \n41.  The Diocese qualifies as a “religious employer” under the narrow exemption from \ncompliance with the U.S. Government Mandate. \n42.  The  Diocese  provides  health  insurance  coverage  to  employees  through  the \nChristian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust, a self-funded church plan which serves employers of \nthe Catholic Church by providing medical benefits to health plan participants.  Health plan \nmaterials specifically state that “the Trust works within the framework of the tenets of the \nCatholic Church.”  To that end, the Trust health plan does not cover abortion or sterilization \ndrugs or services, nor does it cover contraceptives, except when prescribed to treat a medical \nillness and approved by the Trust.  \n43.  Moreover, the Christian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust health plan offered by \nthe Diocese does not meet the definition of a “grandfathered” plan under the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act.  Since March 2010, changes to the health plan have resulted in \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 13 of 47 PageID #:  13\nincreases to plan deductible amounts that exceed “medical inflation” as defined in 26 C.F.R. \n§ 549815-1251T.  Additionally, health plan materials provided to participants or beneficiaries \nhave not included a statement that the plan is believed to be a grandfathered plan, as required by \n26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(2)(ii).     \n44.  Plaintiff Catholic Charities offers coverage through the Diocese’s insurance plan.   \n45.  The plan year for the Diocese (and the organizations participating in its plan) \nbegins on March 1.   \nB.  Catholic Charities \n46.  Catholic Charities, one of the largest nongovernmental social service providers in \nthe region, annually provides services to over 4,962 people.  “Catholic Charities is charged by the \nDiocese of Beaumont to defend and insure the preservation of human dignity. Inspired by the \nsocial teachings of the Church, we strive to improve the lives of those individuals and families \nwho utilize our services, by recognizing and addressing the evolving needs of our society. It is \nour vision to achieve a universal community that is stronger physically, mentally, emotionally and \nspiritually, willing and empowered to care for the needs of all its members.” \n47.  To that end, it carries out the mandates of the Gospel and the social teaching of \nthe Church through works of Christian charity, service, and social justice by providing competent \nand caring social services, special assistance to those in great need, and programs of community \noutreach and advocacy using the skills and talents of professional staff and volunteers.  Catholic \nCharities pursues these goals through its own programs and through partnerships with parishes, \ncommunity groups, and governmental agencies.   \n48.  Multiple programs run by Catholic Charities provide a panoply of services to the \ncommunity.  They are available to people in need without regard to their religion.   \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 14 of 47 PageID #:  14\n49.  The following are just three examples of Catholic Charities work:  1) Immigration \nServices is the only non-profit in Southeast Texas recognized by the BIA and U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Service (USCIS), formerly known as Immigration and Naturalization Service \n(INS), to provide legal immigration services to clients.  The Immigration Services Director is \naccredited to represent clients in immigration matters before the USCIS.  2) The Hospitality \nCenter is a clean, safe and dignified environment where a hearty, daily meal is provided for the \nelderly on fixed incomes, temporarily needy, working poor, disabled and homeless persons.  Last \nyear, the Hospitality Center served approximately 40,000 meals.  3) Elijah’s Place is a program to \nprovide ongoing grief support services to children, ages 5 to 18, who have experienced the death \nof a parent or sibling.   Elijah’s Place grief support provides a setting for age specific group \nsupport sessions for the children (ages 5-6, 7-10, 11-13, and 14-18) and a support session for \nparents.  Parents and children come to Elijah’s Place two evenings each month.  Participation in \nthe program can last 12 to 18 months, or until the family decides they no longer require the \nservice.   \n50.  Catholic Charities has approximately 18 full-time employees.  Like the Diocese, \nCatholic Charities employs individuals of all faiths.   \n51.  Catholic Charities is a member-director corporation.  \n52.  Catholic  Charities  does  not  qualify  as  an  entity  described  in  section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Accordingly, Catholic Charities does not \nqualify as a “religious employer” under the exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate.   \n53.  Catholic Charities employees are offered health insurance through the Diocese’s \nhealth plan.   \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 15 of 47 PageID #:  15\nII.  STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory Background \n54.  In March 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \nPub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation \nAct, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (2010) (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or the \n“Act”).  The Affordable Care Act established many new requirements for “group health plan[s],” \nbroadly defined as “employee welfare benefit plan[s]” within the meaning of the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1), that “provide[] medical care \n. . . to employees or their dependents.”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-91(a)(1).     \n55.  As relevant here, the Act requires an employer’s group health plan to cover \ncertain women’s “preventive care.”  Specifically, it indicates that “[a] group health plan and a \nhealth  insurance  issuer  offering  group  or  individual  health  insurance  coverage  shall,  at  a \nminimum[,] provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for . . . \nwith respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings . . . as provided for in \ncomprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration for \npurposes of this paragraph.”  42 U .S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4).  Because the Act prohibits “cost \nsharing requirements,” the health plan must pay for the full costs of these “preventive care” \nservices without any deductible or co-payment. \n56.   “[T]he Affordable Care Act preserves the ability of individuals to retain coverage \nunder a group health plan or health insurance coverage in which the individual was enrolled on \nMarch 23, 2010.”  Interim Final Rules for Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers \nRelating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct, 75 Fed.

Federal law provides several mechanisms to enforce the requirements of the Act, \nincluding the U.S. Government Mandate.  For example: \n  a.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, certain employers who fail to offer \n“full-time  employees  (and  their  dependents)  the  opportunity  to  enroll  in  minimum \nessential  coverage  under  an  eligible  employer-sponsored  plan”  will  be  exposed  to \nsignificant annual fines of $2,000 per full-time employee.  See 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(a), \n(c)(1). \n  b.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, group health plans that fail to provide \ncertain  required  coverage  may  be  subject  to  a  penalty  of  $100  a  day  per  affected \nbeneficiary.  See 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b); see also Jennifer Staman & Jon Shimabukuro, \nCong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700, Enforcement of the Preventative Health Care Services \nRequirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2012) (asserting that \nthis applies to employers who violate the “preventive care” provision of the Affordable \nCare Act).   \n  c.  Under ERISA, plan participants can bring civil actions against insurers for \nunpaid benefits.  29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B); see also Cong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700.   \n  d.  Similarly, the Secretary of Labor may bring an enforcement action against \ngroup  health  plans  of  employers  that  violate  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate,  as \nincorporated by ERISA.  See 29 U.S.C. § 1132(b)(3); see also Cong. Research Serv., RL \n7-5700 (asserting that these penalties can apply to employers and insurers who violate \nthe “preventive care” provision of the Affordable Care Act).   \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 17 of 47 PageID #:  17\n58.  Several of the Act’s provisions, along with other federal statutes, reflect a clear \ncongressional intent that the executive agency charged with identifying the “preventive care” \nrequired by § 300gg-13(a)(4) should exclude all abortion-related services.   \n59.  For example, the Weldon Amendment, which has been included in every HHS \nand  Department  of  Labor  appropriations  bill  since  2004, pr ohibits  certain  agencies  from \ndiscriminating against an institution based on that institution’s refusal to provide abortion-related \nservices.  Specifically, it states that “[n]one of the funds made available in this Act [to the \nDepartment of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services] may be made available \nto a Federal agency or program . . . i f such agency, program, or government subjects any \ninstitutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the basis that the health care \nentity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.”  Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 Stat. 786, 1111 \n(2011).  The term “health care entity” is defined to include “an individual physician or other \nhealth care professional, a hospital, a provider-sponsored organization, a health maintenance \norganization, a health insurance plan, or any other kind of health care facility, organization, or \nplan.” Id. § 507(d)(2) (emphasis added). \n60.  The legislative history of the Act also demonstrates a clear congressional intent to \nprohibit  the  executive  branch  from  requiring  group  health  plans  to  provide  abortion-related \nservices.  For example, the House of Representatives originally passed a bill that included an \namendment  by  Congressman  Bart  Stupak  prohibiting  the  use  of  federal  funds  for  abortion \nservices.  See H.R. 3962, 111th Cong. § 265 (Nov. 7, 2009).  The Senate version, however, lacked \nthat restriction.  S. Amend. No. 2786 to H.R. 3590, 111th Cong. (Dec. 23, 2009).  To avoid a \nfilibuster in the Senate, congressional proponents of the Act engaged in a procedure known as \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 18 of 47 PageID #:  18\n“budget reconciliation” that required the House to adopt the Senate version of the bill largely in \nits entirety.  Congressman Stupak and other pro-life House members, however, indicated that they \nwould refuse to vote for the Senate version because it failed to adequately prohibit federal \nfunding of abortion.  In an attempt to address these concerns, President Barack Obama issued an \nexecutive  order  providing  that  no  executive  agency  would  authorize  the  federal  funding  of \nabortion services.  See Exec. Order No. 13535, 75 Fed. Reg. 15,599 (Mar. 24, 2010).   \n61.  The Act, therefore, was passed on the central premise that all agencies would \nuphold and follow “longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience” and to prohibit federal \nfunding of abortion.  Id.  That executive order was consistent with a 2009 speech that President \nObama gave at the University of Notre Dame, in which he indicated that his Administration \nwould honor the consciences of those who disagree with abortion, and draft sensible conscience \nclauses. \nB.  Regulatory Background – Defining “Preventive Care” and the Narrow \nExemption \n62.  In a span of less than two years, Defendants promulgated the U.S. Government \nMandate, subverting the Act’s clear purpose to protect the rights of conscience.  The Mandate \nimmediately prompted intense criticism and controversy, in response to which the Government \nhas undertaken various revisions.  None of these revisions, however, alleviates the burden that the \nMandate imposes on Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs.  To the contrary, these revisions have resulted in \na final rule that is significantly worse than the original one.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 19 of 47 PageID #:  19\n(1) The Original Mandate \n63.  On July 19, 2010, Defendants issued interim final rules addressing the statutory \nrequirement that group health plans provide coverage for women’s “preventive care.”  75 Fed. \nReg. 41,726 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4)).  Initially, the rules did not define “preventive \ncare,” instead noting that “[t]he Department of HHS is developing these guidelines and expects to \nissue them no later than August 1, 2011.”  Id. at 41,731. \n64.  To develop the definition of “preventive care,” HHS outsourced its deliberations \nto the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), a non-governmental “independent” organization.  The IOM \nin turn created a “Committee on Preventive Services for Women,” composed of 16 members who \nwere selected in secret without any public input.  At least eight of the Committee members had \nfounded, chaired, or worked with “pro-choice” advocacy groups (including five different Planned \nParenthood  entities)  that  have  well-known  political  and  ideological  views,  including  strong \nanimus toward Catholic teachings on abortion and contraception.   \n65.  Unsurprisingly,  the  IOM  Committee  invited  presentations  from  several  “pro-\nchoice” groups, such as Planned Parenthood and the Guttmacher Institute (named for a former \npresident  of  Planned  Parenthood),  without  inviting  any  input  from  groups  that  oppose \ngovernment-mandated coverage for abortion, contraception, and sterilization.  Instead, opponents \nwere relegated to lining up for brief open-microphone sessions at the close of each meeting. \n66.  At the close of this process, on July 19, 2011, t he IOM issued a final report \nrecommending that “preventive care” for women be defined to include “the full range of Food \nand Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient \neducation and counseling for [all] women with reproductive capacity.”  Inst. Of Med., Clinical \nPreventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps,” at 218-219 (2011). \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 20 of 47 PageID #:  20\n67.  The extreme bias of the IOM process spurred one member of the Committee, Dr. \nAnthony Lo Sasso, to dissent from the final recommendation, writing: “[T]he committee process \nfor evaluation of the evidence lacked transparency and was largely subject to the preferences of \nthe committee’s composition.  Troublingly, the process tended to result in a mix of objective and \nsubjective determinations filtered through a lens of advocacy.”  Id. at 232. \n68.  At a press briefing the next day, the chair of the IOM Committee fielded a \nquestion  from  a  representative  of  the  U.S.  Conference  of  Catholic  Bishops  regarding  the \n“coercive dynamic” of the Mandate, asking whether the Committee considered the “conscience \nrights” of those who would be forced to pay for coverage that they found objectionable on moral \nand religious grounds.  In response, the chair illustrated her cavalier attitude toward the religious-\nliberty issue, stating bluntly: “[W]e did not take into account individual personal feelings.” See \nLinda Rosenstock, Chair, Inst. Of Med. Comm. On Preventive Servs. For Women, Press Briefing \n(July 20, 2011), available at http://www.iom .edu/Reports/2011/Clinical-Preventive-Services-for-\nWomen-Closing-the-Gaps.aspx.  The chair later expressed concern to Congress about considering \nreligious objections to the Mandate because to do so would risk a “slippery slope” that could \noccur  by  “opening  up t hat  door”  to  religious  liberty.    See  Executive  Overreach:  The  HHS \nMandate Versus Religious Liberty:  Hearing Before the H. Comm. On the Judiciary, 112th Cong. \n(2012) (testimony of Linda Rosenstock, Chair, Inst. Of Med. Comm. On Preventive Servs. For \nWomen).   \n69.  Less  than  two  weeks  after  the  IOM  report,  without  pausing  for  notice  and \ncomment, HHS issued a press release on August 1, 2011, a nnouncing that it would adopt the \nIOM’s definition of “preventive care,” including all “FDA-approved contraception methods and \ncontraceptive counseling.”  See U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, “Affordable Care Act \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 21 of 47 PageID #:  21\nEnsures  Women  Receive  Preventive  Services  at  No  Additional  Cost,”  available  at \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/08/20110801b.html.  HHS ignored the religious, moral \nand ethical dimensions of the decision and the ideological bias of the IOM Committee and stated \nthat it had “relied on independent physicians, nurses, scientists, and other experts” to reach a \ndefinition that was “based on scientific evidence.”  Under the final “scientific” definition, the \ncategory  of  mandatory  “preventive  care”  extends  to  “[a]ll  Food  and  Drug  Administration \napproved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling \nfor all women with reproductive capacity.”  See “Women’s Preventive Services: Required Health \nPlan Coverage Guidelines,” http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines.  \n70.  The  Government’s  definition  of  mandatory  “preventive  care”  also  includes \nabortion-inducing products.  For example, the FDA has approved “emergency contraceptives” \nsuch as the morning-after pill (otherwise known as Plan B), which can prevent an embryo from \nimplanting in the womb, and Ulipristal (otherwise known as HRP 2000 or ella), which likewise \ncan induce abortions. \n71.  Shortly  after  announcing  its  definition  of  “preventive  care,”  the  Government \nproposed a narrow exemption from the Mandate for a small category of “religious employers” \nthat met all of the following four criteria: “(1) The inculcation of religious values is the purpose \nof the organization”; “(2) The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious \ntenets  of  the  organization”;  “(3)  The  organization  serves  primarily  persons  who  share  the \nreligious tenets of the organization”; and “(4) The organization is a nonprofit organization as \ndescribed in section 6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986, as amended.” 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621, 46,626 (Aug. 3, 2011) (codified at 45 C.F.R. \n§ 147.130(a)(iv)(B)).  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 22 of 47 PageID #:  22\n72.  As the Government itself admitted, this narrow exemption was intended to protect \nonly “the unique  relationship between  a house of worship  and its employees in ministerial \npositions.”  Id. at 46,623.  It provided no protection for religious universities, elementary and \nsecondary schools, hospitals, and charitable organizations. \n73.  The sweeping nature of the Mandate was subject to widespread and withering \ncriticism.  Religious leaders from across the country protested that they should not be punished or \nconsidered less religious simply because they chose to live out their faith by serving needy \nmembers of the community who might not share their beliefs.  For example, the University of \nDallas urged the Government to “expand the existing religious employer exemption to include \nreligious institutions . . . beyond just churches and religious orders.”  Comments of the University \nof Dallas at 2. \n74.  Despite such pleas, the Government at first refused to reconsider its position.  \nInstead,  the  Government  “finalize[d],  without  change,”  the  narrow  exemption  as  originally \nproposed.  77 Fed. Reg. at 8,729 (Feb. 15, 2012).  At the same time, the Government announced \nthat it would offer a “a one-year safe harbor from enforcement” for religious organizations that \nremained subject to the Mandate. Id. at 8,728.  As noted by then-jBishop Farrell, the promised \nsafe  harbor  effectively  gave  objecting  religious  institutions  “one  year  to  violate  their \nconsciences.”  M ost Reverend Kevin J. Farrell, D.D., The War Against Religious Freedom \nEscalates (Jan. 23, 2012), available at http://bishopkevinfarrell.org/blog/2012/01/the-war-against-\nreligious-freedom-escalates/ (last visited August 15, 2013).  \n75.  A  month  later,  under  continuing  public  pressure,  the  Government  issued  an \nAdvance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPRM”) that, it claimed, set out a solution to the \nreligious-liberty controversy created by the Mandate.  77 Fed. Reg. 16,501 (Mar. 21, 2012).  The \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 23 of 47 PageID #:  23\nANPRM did not revoke the Mandate, and in fact reaffirmed the Government’s view at the time \nthat the “religious employer” exemption would not be changed.  Id. at 16,501-08.  Instead, the \nANPRM  offered  hypothetical  “possible  approaches”  that  would,  in  the  Government’s  view, \nsomehow  solve  the  religious-liberty  problem  without  granting  an  exemption  for  objecting \nreligious  organizations.    Id.  at  16,507.   As  the  U.S.  Conference  of  Catholic  Bishops  soon \nrecognized, however, any semblance of relief offered by the ANPRM was illusory. Although it \nwas designed to “create an appearance of moderation and compromise, it [did] not actually offer \nany change in the Administration’s earlier stated positions on mandated contraceptive coverage.” \nSee Comments of U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, at 3 (May  15, 2012),  available at \nhttp://www.usccb.org/about/general-counsel/rulemaking/upload/comments-on-advance-notice-of-\nproposed-rulemaking-on-preventive-services-12-05-15.pdf.    \n(2) The Government’s Final Offer and the Empty \n“Accommodation” \n \n76.  On February 1, 2013, the Government issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n(“NPRM”), setting forth in further detail its proposal to “accommodate” the rights of Plaintiffs \nand other religious organizations.  The NPRM, like the Government’s previous proposals, was \nonce again met with strenuous opposition, including over 400,000 comments.  For example, the \nU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops stated that “the ‘accommodation’ still requires the objecting \nreligious organization to fund or otherwise facilitate the morally objectionable coverage. Such \norganizations and their employees remain deprived of their right to live and work under a health \nplan  consonant  with  their  explicit  religious  beliefs  and  commitments.”   C omments  of  U.S. \nConference  of  Catholic  Bishop,  at  3 ( Mar.  20, 2013) ,  available  at \nhttp://www.usccb.org/about/general-counsel/rulemaking/upload/2013-NPRM-Comments-3-20-\nfinal.pdf.     \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 24 of 47 PageID #:  24\n77.  Despite this opposition, on June 28, 2013, the Government issued a final rule that \nadopted substantially all of the NPRM’s proposal without significant change.  See 78 Fed. Reg. \n39870 (July 2, 2013) (“Final Rule”).  \n78.  The Final Rule makes three changes to the Mandate.  As described below, even \nthe revised Mandate places unlawful burdens on Plaintiffs and other religious organizations.  \nIndeed, one change significantly increases that burden by significantly increasing the number of \nreligious organizations subject to the Mandate.  \n79.  First,  the  Final  Rule  makes  what  the  Government  concedes  to  be  a  non-\nsubstantive, cosmetic change to the definition of “religious employer.”  In particular, it eliminates \nthe first three prongs of that definition, such that, under the new definition, an exempt “religious \nemployer” is simply “an organization that is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is \nreferred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.”   \n78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874 (codified at 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a)).  As the Government has admitted, \nthis new definition does “not expand the universe of employer plans that would qualify for the \nexemption beyond that which was intended in the 2012 final rules.”  78 Fed. Reg. at 8,461.    \nInstead, it continues to “restrict[]the exemption primarily to group health plans established or \nmaintained  by  churches,  synagogues,  mosques,  and  other  houses  of  worship,  and  religious \norders.”  Id.  In this respect, the Final Rule mirrors the intended scope of the original “religious \nemployer” exemption, which focused on “the unique relationship between a house of worship and \nits employees in ministerial positions.”  76 Fed. Reg. at 46,623.  Religious organizations that have \na broader mission are still not, in the Government’s view, “religious employers.”   \n80.  The “religious employer” exemption, moreover, creates an official, Government-\nfavored category of religious groups that are exempt from the Mandate, while denying this \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 25 of 47 PageID #:  25\nfavorable treatment to all other religious groups.  The exemption applies only to those groups that \nare referred “to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code.”  This category \nincludes  only  (i)  “churches,  their  integrated  auxiliaries,  and  conventions  or  associations  of \nchurches,” and (iii) “the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.”  The IRS has \nadopted an intrusive 14-factor test to determine whether a group meets these qualifications.  See \nFoundation of Human Understanding v. United States, 88 Fed. Cl. 203, 220 (Fed. Cl. 2009).  \nAmong these 14 factors is whether the group has “ a recognized creed and form of worship,” “a \ndefinite and distinct ecclesiastical government,” “a formal code of doctrine and discipline,” “a \ndistinct religious history,” “an organization of ordained ministers” “a literature of its own,” \n“established places of worship,” “regular congregations, “regular religious services,” “Sunday \nschools  for  the  religious  instruction  of  the  young,”  and  “schools  for  the  preparation  of  its \nministers.” Id.  Not only do these factors favor some religious groups at the expense of others, but \nthey  also  require  the  Government  to  make  intrusive  judgments  regarding  religious  beliefs, \npractices, and organizational features to determine which groups fall into the favored category. \n81.  Second,  the  Final  Rule  establishes  an  illusory  “accommodation”  for  certain \nnonexempt objecting religious entities that qualify as “eligible organizations.”  To qualify as an \n“eligible organization,” a religious entity must (1) “oppose[] providing coverage for some or all \nof [the] contraceptive services,” (2)  be “organized and operate[] as a non-profit entity”; (3) \n“hold[] itself out as a religious organization,” and (4) self-certify that it meets the first three \ncriteria, and provide a copy of the self-certification either to its insurance company or, if the \nreligious organization is self-insured, to its third-party administrator.  26 C.F.R. § 54.9816-\n2713A(a).  The provision of this self-certification then automatically requires the insurance issuer \nor third-party administrator to provide or arrange “payments for contraceptive services” for the \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 26 of 47 PageID #:  26\norganization’s  employees,  without  imposing  any  “cost-sharing  requirements  (such  as  a \ncopayment, coinsurance, or a deductible).” Id. § 54.9816-2713A(b)(2), (c)(2).  The objectionable \ncoverage, moreover, is directly tied to the organization’s health plan, lasting only as long as the \nemployee  remains  on  that  plan.    See  29  C.F.R.  § 2590.715 -2713A(d);  45 C .F.R. \n§ 147.131(c)(2)(i)(B).  In addition, self-insured organizations are prohibited from “directly or \nindirectly, seek[ing] to influence the[ir] third party administrator’s decision” to provide or procure \ncontraceptive services.  26 C.F.R. § 54.9815–2713.   \n82.  This  so-called  “accommodation”  fails  to  relieve  the  burden  on r eligious \norganizations.  Under the original version of the Mandate, a non-exempt religious organization’s \ndecision to offer a group health plan resulted in the provision of  coverage for abortion-inducing \nproducts, contraception, sterilization, and related counseling.  Under the Final Rule, a non-exempt \nreligious organization’s decision to offer a group health plan still results in the provision of \ncoverage—now  in  the  form  of  “payments”—for  abortion-inducing  products,  contraception, \nsterilization, and related counseling.  Id. § 54.9816-2713A(b)-(c).  In both scenarios, Plaintiffs’ \ndecision to provide a group health plan triggers the provision of “free” contraceptive coverage to \ntheir employees in a manner contrary to their beliefs.  The provision of the objectionable products \nand services are directly tied to Plaintiffs’ insurance policies, as the objectionable “payments” are \navailable only so long as an employee is on the organization’s health plan. See 29 C.F.R. § \n2590.715-2713A(d) (for self-insured employers, the third-party administrator “will provide or \narrange separate payments for contraceptive services . . . for so long as [employees] are enrolled \nin [their] group health plan”); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(i)(B) (for employers that offer insured \nplans, the insurance issuer must “[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive services . . . \nfor plan participants and beneficiaries for so long as they remain enrolled in the plan”).  For self-\n26 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 27 of 47 PageID #:  27\ninsured  organizations,  moreover,  the  self-certification  constitutes  the  religious  organization’s \n“designation of the third party administrator(s) as plan administrator and claims administrator for \ncontraceptive benefits.”  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,879 (emphasis added).  Thus, employer health plans \noffered by non-exempt religious organizations are the vehicle by which “free” abortion-inducing \nproducts, contraception, sterilization, and related counseling are delivered to the organizations’ \nemployees. \n83.  Needless to say, this shell game does not address Plaintiffs’ fundamental religious \nobjection  to  improperly  facilitating  access  to  the  objectionable  products  and  services.   T he \nMandate coerces Plaintiffs, through threats of crippling fines and other pressure, into facilitating \naccess to contraception, abortion-inducing products, sterilization, and related counseling for their \nemployees, contrary to their sincerely held religious beliefs.   \n84.  The so-called “accommodation,” moreover, requires Plaintiffs to cooperate in the \nprovision of objectionable coverage in other ways as well.  For example, in order to be eligible \nfor the so-called “accommodation,” Plaintiffs must provide a “certification” to their insurance \nprovider  setting  forth  their  religious  objections  to  the  Mandate.    The  provision  of  this \n“certification,” in turn, automatically triggers an obligation on the part of the insurance provider \nto provide Plaintiffs’ employees with the objectionable coverage.  A religious organization’s self-\ncertification, therefore, is a trigger and but-for cause of the objectionable coverage.   \n85.  The Mandate also requires Plaintiffs to subsidize the objectionable products and \nservices. \n86.  For organizations that procure insurance through a separate insurance provider, \nthe Government asserts that the cost of the objectionable products and services will be “cost \nneutral” and, therefore, that Plaintiffs will not actually be paying for it, notwithstanding the fact \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 28 of 47 PageID #:  28\nthat Plaintiffs’ premiums are the only source of funding that their insurance providers will receive \nfor the objectionable products and services.   \n87.  The Government’s “cost-neutral” assertion, however, is implausible.  It rests on \nthe assumption that cost “savings” from “fewer childbirths” will be at least as large as the direct \ncosts of paying for contraceptive products and services and the costs of administering individual \npolicies.  78 Fed. Reg. at 8,463.  Some employees, however, will choose not to use contraception \nnotwithstanding the Mandate.  Others would use contraception regardless of whether it is being \npaid for by an insurance company.  And yet others will shift from less expensive to more \nexpensive products once coverage is mandate and cost-sharing is prohibited.  Consequently, there \ncan be no assurance that cost “savings” from “fewer childbirths” will offset the cost of providing \ncontraceptive services. \n88.  More importantly, even if the Government’s “cost-neutral” assertion were true, it \nis irrelevant.  The so-called “accommodation” is nothing more than a shell game.  Premiums \npreviously paid by the objecting employers to cover, for example, “childbirths,” will now be \nredirected to pay for contraceptive products and services.  Thus, the objecting employer is still \nrequired to pay for the objectionable products and services. \n89.  For self-insured organizations, the Government’s “cost-neutral”  assumption is \nlikewise implausible.  The Government asserts that third-party administrators required to provide \nor procure the objectionable products and services will be compensated by reductions in user fees \nthat they otherwise would pay for participating in federally-facilitated health exchanges. See 78 \nFed. Reg. at 39,882.   S uch fee reductions are to be established through a highly regulated and \nbureaucratic process for evaluating, approving, and monitoring fees paid in compensation to \nthird-party  administrators.   S uch  regulatory  regimes,  however,  do  not  fully  compensate  the \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 29 of 47 PageID #:  29\nregulatory  entities  for  the  costs  and  risks  incurred.   A s  a  result,  few  if  any  third-party \nadministrators are likely to participate in this regime, and those that do are likely to increase fees \ncharged to the self-insured organizations.   \n90.  Either way, as with insured plans, self-insured organizations likewise will be \nrequired  to  subsidize  contraceptive  products  and  services  notwithstanding  the  so-called \n“accommodation.” \n91.  For  all of these reasons, the U.S. Government Mandate continues to  require \nPlaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to abortion-inducing products, contraception, \nsterilization, and related education and counseling, in violation of their sincerely-held religious \nbeliefs. \n92.  Third, the Final Rule actually increases the number of religious organizations that \nare subject to the Mandate.  Under the Government’s initial interpretation of the “religious \nemployer” exemption, if a nonexempt religious organization “provided health coverage for its \nemployees through” a plan offered by a separate, “affiliated” organization that was “exempt from \nthe requirement to cover contraceptive services, then neither the [affiliated organization] nor the \n[nonexempt entity would be] required to offer contraceptive coverage to its employees.”  77 Fed. \nReg. 16,501, 16,502 (Mar. 21, 2012).     \n93.  For example, the Diocese operates an insurance plan that covers not only the \nDiocese itself, but Plaintiff Catholic Charities.  Under the Government’s initial interpretation of \nthe religious employer exemption, if the Diocese was an exempt “religious employer,” then \nCatholic Charities received the benefit of that exemption, regardless of whether it independently \nqualified as a “religious employer,” since it could continue to participate in the Diocese’s exempt \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 30 of 47 PageID #:  30\nplan.  Catholic Charities, therefore, could benefit from the Diocese’s exemption even if by itself it \ncould not meet the Government’s unprecedentedly narrow definition of “religious employer.”   \n94.  The  Final  Rule  eliminates  this  safeguard.    Instead,  it  provides  that  “each \nemployer” must “independently meet the definition of eligible organization or religious employer \nin order to take advantage of the accommodation or the religious employer exemption with \nrespect to its employees and their covered dependents.”  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,886.  See also 78 Fed. \nReg. at 8,467.  Since Catholic Charities does not meet the Government’s narrow definition of a \n“religious employer,” it is now subject to the U.S. Government Mandate. \n95.  Moreover, since Catholic Charities is part of the Diocese’s insurance plan, the \nDiocese is now required by the Mandate to do one of two things:  since Catholic Charities \nparticipates in the diocesan insurance plan, the Diocese would be forced to sponsor a plan that \nwill provide Catholic Charities’ employees with access to “free” contraception, abortion-inducing \nproducts, sterilization, and related counseling.  Alternatively, the Diocese must expel Catholic \nCharities from its insurance plan and thereby subject Catholic Charities to massive fines unless it \nenters into an arrangement with another insurance provider that will, in turn, provide or procure \nthe objectionable products and services.   \n96.  In this respect, the Mandate seeks to divide the Catholic Church.  The Church’s \nfaith in action, carried out through its charitable and educational arms, is every bit as central to \nthe Church’s religious mission as is the administration of the Sacraments.  In the words of Pope \nBenedict, “[t]he Church cannot neglect the service of charity any more than she can neglect the \nSacraments and the Word.”  Yet the Mandate seeks to separate these consubstantial aspects of the \nCatholic faith, treating one as “religious” and the other as not.  The Mandate therefore deeply \nintrudes into internal Church governance.     \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 31 of 47 PageID #:  31\n97.  In sum, the revised Mandate imposes a burden on the Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs; \nit  in  fact  makes  that  burden  significantly  worse  by  increasing  the  number  of  religious \norganizations that are subject to the Mandate.  The U.S. Government Mandate, therefore, requires \nPlaintiffs to act contrary to their sincerely held religious beliefs. \nIII.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MANDATE IMPOSES A SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN  \nON PLAINTIFFS’ RELIGIOUS LIBERTY \nA.  The U.S. Government Mandate Substantially Burdens Plaintiffs’ \nReligious Beliefs \n98.  Since the founding of this country, our law and society have recognized that \nindividuals and institutions are entitled to freedom of conscience and religious practice.  Absent a \ncompelling reason, no government authority may compel any group or individual to act contrary \nto their religious beliefs.  As noted by Thomas Jefferson, “[n]o provision in our Constitution \nought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises \nof civil authority.”  \n99.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates Plaintiffs’ rights of conscience by forcing \nthem to participate in an employer-based scheme to provide access to products and services to \nwhich they strenuously object on moral and religious grounds.   \n100.  It  is  a  core  tenet  of  Plaintiffs’  religion  that  abortion,  contraception,  and \nsterilization are serious moral wrongs.   \n101.  Plaintiffs’ Catholic beliefs therefore prohibit them from providing, paying for, \nand/or facilitating access to abortion-inducing products, contraception, or sterilization.   \n102.  As  a  corollary,  Plaintiffs’  Catholic  beliefs  prohibit  them  contracting  with  an \ninsurance company or third-party administrator that will, as a result, provide or procure the \nobjectionable products and services to Plaintiffs’ employees. \n103.  Plaintiffs’ beliefs are deeply and sincerely held.   \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 32 of 47 PageID #:  32\n104.  The U.S. Government Mandate, therefore, requires Plaintiffs to do precisely what \ntheir  sincerely  held  religious  beliefs  prohibit—provide,  pay  for,  and/or  facilitate  access  to \nobjectionable products and services or else incur crippling sanctions.   \n105.  The  U.S.  Government  Mandate  therefore  imposes  a  substantial  burden  on \nplaintiffs’ religious beliefs. \n106.  The Mandate’s exemption for “religious employers” does not alleviate the burden.   \n107.  The  “religious  employers”  exemption  does  not  apply  to  Plaintiff  Catholic \nCharities. \n108.  Although the Diocese is a “religious employer,” the Mandate still forces it either \nto (1) sponsor a plan that will provide Catholic Charities with access to the objectionable products \nand services, or (2) no longer extend its plan to these organizations, subjecting them to massive \nfines if they do not contract with another insurance provider that will provide the objectionable \ncoverage.   \n109.  The first option forces the Diocese to act contrary to its sincerely-held religious \nbeliefs. The second option compels the Diocese to submit to the government’s interference with \nits structure and internal operations by accepting a construct that divides churches from their \nministries. \n110.  The  so-called  “accommodation”  does  not  alleviate  the  burden  on P laintiffs’ \nsincerely held religious beliefs.   \n111.  Notwithstanding the so-called “accommodation,” Plaintiffs are still required to \nprovide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to the objectionable products and services. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 33 of 47 PageID #:  33\n112.  Plaintiffs’ Catholic beliefs do not simply prohibit them from using or directly \npaying for the objectionable coverage. Their beliefs also prohibit them from facilitating access to \nthe objectionable products and services in the manner required by the Mandate.     \n113.  Finally,  the  Plaintiffs  cannot  avoid  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate  without \nincurring significant adverse consequences.  If they eliminate their employee health plans, they \nare subject to annual fines of $2,000 per full-time employee and would suffer a disadvantage in \nemployee recruitment and retention. If they keep their health plans but refuse to provide or \nfacilitate the objectionable coverage, they are subject to daily fines of $100 a day per affected \nbeneficiary.   These adverse consequences therefore coerce Plaintiffs into violating their religious \nbeliefs. \n114.  In short, while the President claims to have “found a solution that works for \neveryone”  and  that  ensures  that  “religious  liberty  will  be  protected,”  his  promised \n“accommodation” does neither.  Unless and until this issue is definitively resolved, the U.S. \nGovernment  Mandate  does  and  will  continue  to  impose  a  substantial  burden  on P laintiffs’ \nreligious beliefs. \nB.  The U.S. Government Mandate Is Not a Neutral Law of General \nApplicability  \n115.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability.  It \noffers multiple exemptions from its requirement that employer-based health plans include or \nfacilitate  coverage  for  abortion-inducing  products,  sterilization,  contraception,  and  related \neducation and counseling.  It was, moreover, implemented by and at the behest of individuals and \norganizations who disagree with Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception, \nand thus targets religious organizations for disfavored treatment. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 34 of 47 PageID #:  34\n116.  For  example,  the  Mandate  exempts  all  “grandfathered”  plans  from  its \nrequirements, thus excluding tens of millions of people from the mandated coverage.  As the \ngovernment has admitted, while the numbers are expected to diminish over time, “98 million \nindividuals  will  be  enrolled  in  grandfathered  group  health  plans  in  2013.”   75 F ed.  Reg. \n41726,41732 (July 19, 2010). Elsewhere, the government has put the number at 87 million. See \n“Keeping  the  Health  Plan  You  Have”  (June  14, 2010 ), \nhttp://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2010/06/keeping-the-health-plan-you-have-\ngrandfathered.html.  And according to one district court last year, “191 million Americans \nbelong[ed] to plans which may be grandfathered under the ACA.”  Newland v. Sebelius, 881 F. \nSupp. 2d 1287, 1291 (D. Colo. 2012). \n117.  Similarly, small employers (i.e., those with fewer than 50 employees) are exempt \nfrom certain enforcement mechanisms to compel compliance with the Mandate. See 26 U.S.C. § \n4980H(a) (exempting small employers from the assessable payment for failure to provide health \ncoverage).  \n118.  In addition, the Mandate exempts an arbitrary subset of religious organizations \nthat qualify for tax-reporting exemptions under Section 6033 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The \nGovernment  cannot  justify  its  protection  of  the  religious-conscience  rights  of  the  narrow \ncategory of exempt “religious employers,” but not of Plaintiffs and other religious organizations \nthat remain subject to the Mandate. \n119.  The  U.S.  Government  Mandate,  moreover,  was  promulgated  by  Government \nofficials,  and  supported  by  non-governmental  organizations,  who  strongly  oppose  certain \nCatholic teachings and beliefs.  For example, on October 5, 2011, Defendant Sebelius spoke at a \nfundraiser for NARAL Pro-Choice America.  Defendant Sebelius has long supported abortion \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 35 of 47 PageID #:  35\nrights  and  criticized  Catholic  teachings  and  beliefs  regarding  abortion  and  contraception.  \nNARAL Pro-Choice America is a pro-abortion organization that likewise opposes many Catholic \nteachings.  At that fundraiser, Defendant Sebelius criticized individuals and entities whose beliefs \ndiffered from those held by her and the other attendees of the NARAL Pro-Choice America \nfundraiser, stating: “Wouldn’t you think that people who want to reduce the number of abortions \nwould champion the cause of widely available, widely affordable contraceptive services?  Not so \nmuch.”  In addition, the Mandate was modeled on a California law that was motivated by \ndiscriminatory intent against religious groups that oppose contraception. \n120.  Consequently, Plaintiffs allege that the purpose of the U.S. Government Mandate, \nincluding the narrow exemption, is to discriminate against religious institutions and organizations \nthat oppose abortion and contraception. \nC.  The U.S. Government Mandate Is Not the Least Restrictive Means of \nFurthering a Compelling Governmental Interest \n121.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n122.  The Government has no compelling interest in forcing Plaintiffs to violate their \nsincerely held religious beliefs by requiring them to participate in a scheme for the provision of \nabortion-inducing products, sterilization, contraceptives, and related education and counseling.  \nThe  Government  itself  has  relieved  numerous  other  employers  from  this  requirement  by \nexempting grandfathered plans and plans of employers it deems to be sufficiently religious.  \nMoreover, these services are widely available in the United States.  The U.S. Supreme Court has \nheld that individuals have a constitutional right to use such services.  And nothing that Plaintiffs \ndo inhibits any individual from exercising that right.   \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 36 of 47 PageID #:  36\n123.  Even  assuming  the  interest  was  compelling,  the  Government  has  numerous \nalternative means of furthering that interest without forcing Plaintiffs to violate their religious \nbeliefs.  For example, the Government could have provided or paid for the objectionable services \nitself through other programs established by a duly enacted law.  Or, at a minimum, it could have \ncreated a broader exemption for religious employers, such as those found in numerous state laws \nthroughout the country and in other federal laws.  The Government therefore cannot possibly \ndemonstrate that requiring Plaintiffs to violate their consciences is the least restrictive means of \nfurthering its interest. \n124.  The U.S. Government Mandate, moreover, would simultaneously undermine both \nreligious freedom—a fundamental right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution—and access to the \nwide variety of social and educational services that Plaintiffs provide.  As President Obama \nacknowledged in his announcement of February 10, 2012, religious organizations like Plaintiffs \ndo “more good for a community than a government program ever could.”  The U.S. Government \nMandate, however, puts these good works in jeopardy.  \n125.  That is unconscionable.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the U.S. \nGovernment  Mandate  cannot  lawfully  be  applied  to  Plaintiffs,  an  injunction  barring  its \nenforcement, and an order vacating the Mandate. \nIV.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MANDATE THREATENS PLAINTIFFS WITH \nIMMINENT INJURY THAT SHOULD BE REMEDIED BY A COURT \n126.  The U.S. Government Mandate is causing serious, ongoing hardship to Plaintiffs \nthat merits relief now. \n127.  On June 28, 2013, Defendants finalized the U.S. Government mandate, including \nthe narrow “religious employer” exemption and the so-called “accommodation” proposed in the \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 37 of 47 PageID #:  37\nNPRM.  By the terms of the Final Rule, Plaintiffs must comply with the Mandate for their plan \nyears beginning on or after January 1, 2014.   \n128.  Defendants  have  given  no  indication  that  they  will  not  enforce  the  essential \nprovisions of the Mandate that impose a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ rights.  Consequently, \nabsent the relief sought herein, Plaintiffs will be required to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate \naccess  to  contraception,  abortion-inducing  products,  sterilization,  and  related  education  and \ncounseling, in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs. \n129.  The U.S. Government Mandate is also harming Plaintiffs in other ways.   \n130.  Health plans do not take shape overnight.  A number of analyses, negotiations, \nand decisions must occur each year before Plaintiffs can offer a health benefits package to their \nemployees.  For example, an employer using an outside insurance issuer must work with actuaries \nto evaluate its funding reserves, and then negotiate with the insurer to determine the cost of the \nproducts and services it wants to offer its employees.  An employer that is self-insured, after \nconsulting with its actuaries, must similarly negotiate with its third-party administrator (“TPA”).  \n131.   Under normal circumstances, Plaintiffs must begin the process of determining \ntheir health care package for a plan year at least several months before the plan year begins. The \nmultiple levels of uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Government Mandate make this already \nlengthy process even more complex. \n132.   In addition, if Plaintiffs do not comply with the U.S. Government Mandate, they \nmay be subject to government fines and penalties.  The hardship placed on Plaintiffs by such \nfines and penalties would be immense, given that most of their income comes from grants, \nfundraisers,  and  the  free-will  offerings  of  the  Catholic  people.   F urther,  Plaintiffs  require \nsignificant time to budget for such additional expenses.   \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 38 of 47 PageID #:  38\n133. The U.S. Government Mandate and its uncertain legality, moreover, undermine \nPlaintiffs’ ability to hire and retain employees, thus placing them at a competitive disadvantage \nin  the  labor  market  relative  to  organizations  that  do not   have  a  religious  objection  to the \nMandate. \n134.  Plaintiffs  therefore  need  judicial  relief  now  in  order  to  prevent  the  serious, \nongoing harm that the U.S. Government Mandate is already imposing on them. \nV.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nSubstantial Burden on Religious Exercise  \nin Violation of RFRA \n135.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint.  \n136.  RFRA prohibits the Government from substantially burdening an entity’s exercise \nof religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the Government \ndemonstrates  that  the  burden  furthers  a  compelling  governmental  interest  and  is  the  least \nrestrictive means of furthering that interest.  \n137.  RFRA protects organizations as well as individuals from Government-imposed \nsubstantial burdens on religious exercise. \n138.  RFRA applies to all federal law and the implementation of that law by any \nbranch, department, agency, instrumentality, or official of the United States. \n139.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or \nfacilitate  access  to  abortion-inducing  products,  contraception,  sterilization  procedures,  and \nrelated counseling, in a manner that is directly contrary to their religious beliefs.  \n140.  The  U.S.  Government  Mandate  substantially  burdens  Plaintiffs’  exercise  of \nreligion. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 39 of 47 PageID #:  39\n141.  The Government has no compelling governmental interest to require Plaintiffs to \ncomply with the U.S. Government Mandate. \n142.  Requiring Plaintiffs to comply with the U.S. Government Mandate is not the least \nrestrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.  \n143.  By enacting and threatening to enforce the U.S. Government Mandate against \nPlaintiffs, Defendants have violated RFRA.  \n144.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n145.  Defendants  are  imposing  an  immediate  and  ongoing  harm  on  Plaintiffs  that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT II \nSubstantial Burden on Religious Exercise in Violation of  \nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment \n146.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint.  \n147.  The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the Government from \nsubstantially burdening an entity’s exercise of religion. \n148.  The  Free  Exercise  Clause  protects  organizations  as  well  as  individuals  from \nGovernment-imposed burdens on religious exercise. \n149.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or \nfacilitate  access  to  abortion-inducing  products,  contraception,  sterilization  procedures,  and \nrelated counseling, in a manner that is directly contrary to their religious beliefs. \n150.  The  U.S.  Government  Mandate  substantially  burdens  Plaintiffs’  exercise  of \nreligion. \n151.  The U.S.  Government  Mandate is not  a neutral law of  general applicability, \nbecause it is riddled with exemptions for which there is not a consistent, legally defensible basis.  \nIt offers multiple exemptions from its requirement that employer-based health plans include or \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 40 of 47 PageID #:  40\nfacilitate access to abortion-inducing products, sterilization, contraception, and related education \nand counseling. \n152.    The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability \nbecause it was passed with discriminatory intent. \n153.  The U.S. Government Mandate implicates constitutional rights in addition to the \nright  to  free  exercise  of  religion,  including,  for  example,  the  rights  to  free  speech,  free \nassociation, and freedom from excessive government entanglement with religion. \n154.  The Government has no compelling governmental interest to require Plaintiffs to \ncomply with the U.S. Government Mandate. \n155.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling \ngovernmental interest.  \n156.  By  enacting  and  threatening  to  enforce  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate,  the \nGovernment has burdened Plaintiffs’ religious exercise in violation of the Free Exercise Clause of \nthe First Amendment.  \n157.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n158.  Defendants  are  imposing  an  immediate  and  ongoing  harm  on  Plaintiffs  that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT III \nCompelled Speech in Violation of  \nthe Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment \n159.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n160.  The First Amendment protects against the compelled affirmation of any religious \nor ideological proposition that the speaker finds unacceptable. \n161.  The  First  Amendment  protects  organizations  as  well  as  individuals  against \ncompelled speech. \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 41 of 47 PageID #:  41\n162.  Expenditures are a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. \n163.  The First Amendment speakers from being forced to support a viewpoint that \nconflicts with their religious beliefs. \n164.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiffs to provide health care \nplans to their employees that include or facilitate access to products and services that violate their \nreligious beliefs.   \n165.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiffs to subsidize, promote, \nand  facilitate  education  and  counseling  services  regarding  these  objectionable  products  and \nservices. \n166.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiffs to issue a certification of \nits beliefs that, in turn, would result in the provision of access to objectionable products and \nservices to Plaintiffs’ employees. \n167.  By imposing the U.S. Government Mandate, Defendants are compelling Plaintiffs \nto publicly subsidize or facilitate the activity and speech of private entities that are contrary to \ntheir religious beliefs, and compelling Plaintiffs to engage in speech that will result in the \nprovision of access to objectionable products and services to Plaintiffs’ employees. \n168.  The U.S. Government Mandate is viewpoint-discriminatory and subject to strict \nscrutiny. \n169.  The U.S. Government Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest.  \n170.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling \ngovernmental interest.  \n171.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 42 of 47 PageID #:  42\n172.  Defendants  are  imposing  an  immediate  and  ongoing  harm  on  Plaintiffs  that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT IV \nProhibition of Speech  \nin Violation of the First Amendment \n173.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n174.  The First Amendment protects the freedom of speech, including the right of \nreligious groups to speak out to persuade others to refrain from engaging in conduct that may be \nconsidered immoral. \n175.  The Mandate violates the First Amendment freedom of speech by imposing a gag \norder that prohibits Plaintiffs from speaking out in any way that might “influence,” “directly or \nindirectly,”  the  decision  of  a  third-party  administrator  to  provide  or  procure  contraceptive \nproducts and services to Plaintiffs’ employees. \n176.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n177.  Defendants  are  imposing  an  immediate  and  ongoing  harm  on  Plaintiffs  that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT V \nOfficial “Church” Favoritism and Excessive Entanglement with Religion  \nin Violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \n178.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n179.  The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the Government from \nadopting an official definition of a “religious employer” that favors some religious groups while \nexcluding others. \n180.  The  Establishment  Clause  also  prohibits  the  Government  from  becoming \nexcessively entangled in the affairs of religious groups by scrutinizing their beliefs, practices, and \norganizational features to determine whether they meet the Government’s favored definition. \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 43 of 47 PageID #:  43\n181.  The “religious employer” exemption violates the Establishment Clause in two \nways.   \n182.  First, it favors some religious groups over others by creating an official definition \nof “religious employers.”  Religious groups that meet the Government’s official definition receive \nfavorable treatment in the form of an exemption from the Mandate, while other religious groups \ndo not. \n183.  Second, even if it were permissible for the Government to favor some religious \ngroups over others, the “religious employer” exemption would still violate the Establishment \nClause because it requires the Government to determine whether groups qualify as “religious \nemployers”  based  on i ntrusive  judgments  about  their  beliefs,  practices,  and  organizational \nfeatures.  The exemption turns on an intrusive 14-factor test to determine whether a group meets \nthe  requirements  of  section  6033(a)(1)  and  section  6033(a)(3)(A)(i)  or  (iii)  of  the  Internal \nRevenue Code.  These 14 factors probe into matters such as whether a religious group has “a \ndistinct religious history” or  “a recognized creed and form of worship.”   But it is not the \nGovernment’s place to determine whether a group’s religious history is “distinct,” or whether the \ngroup’s “creed and form of worship” are “recognized.”  By directing the Government to partake \nof such inquiries, the “religious employer” exemption runs afoul of the Establishment Clause \nprohibition on excessive entanglement with religion. \n184.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n185.  Defendants are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT VI \nInterference in Matters of Internal Church Governance in Violation of  \nthe Religion Clauses of the First Amendment \n186.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 44 of 47 PageID #:  44\n187.  The Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause and the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act protect the freedom of religious organizations to decide for themselves, free from \nstate interference, matters of church government as well as those of faith and doctrine.     \n188.  Under  these  Clauses,  the  Government  may  not  interfere  with  a  religious \norganization’s internal decisions concerning the organization’s religious structure, ministers, or \ndoctrine.   \n189.  Under  these  Clauses,  the  Government  may  not  interfere  with  a  religious \norganization’s internal decision if that interference would affect the faith and mission of the \norganization itself. \n190.  Plaintiffs are religious organizations affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.   \n191.  The  Catholic  Church  views  abortion,  sterilization,  and  contraception  as \nintrinsically immoral, and prohibits Catholic organizations from condoning or facilitating those \npractices.     \n192.  Plaintiffs have abided and must continue to abide by the decision of the Catholic \nChurch on these issues.     \n193.  The Government may not interfere with or otherwise question the final decision \nof the Catholic Church that its religious organizations must abide by these views.       \n194.  Plaintiffs have therefore made the internal decision that the health plans they offer \nto their employees may not cover, subsidize, or facilitate access to abortion, sterilization, or \ncontraception. \n195.  The Diocese has further made the internal decision that Catholic Charities (as an \nadopting employer) may offer their employees health-insurance coverage through the Diocese’s \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 45 of 47 PageID #:  45\nplan, which allows the Diocese to ensure that this quintessentially Catholic organization does not \noffer access to services that are contrary to Catholic teaching.  \n196.  The  U.S.  Government  Mandate  interferes  with  Plaintiffs’  internal  decisions \nconcerning their structure and mission by requiring them to facilitate practices that directly \nconflict with Catholic beliefs. \n197.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s interference with Plaintiffs’ internal decisions \naffects their faith and mission by requiring them to facilitate practices that directly conflict with \ntheir religious beliefs.   \n198.  Because  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate  interferes  with  the  internal  decision-\nmaking  of  Plaintiffs  in  a  manner  that  affects  Plaintiffs’  faith  and  mission,  it v iolates  the \nEstablishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act. \n199.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n200.  Defendants  are  imposing  an  immediate  and  ongoing  harm  on  Plaintiffs  that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT VII \nIllegal Action in Violation of the APA \n201.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint.  \n202.  The APA requires that all Government agency action, findings, and conclusions \nbe “in accordance with law.”   \n203.  The U.S. Government Mandate, its exemption for “religious employers,” and its \nso-called “accommodation” for “eligible” religious organizations are illegal and therefore in \nviolation of the APA.   \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 46 of 47 PageID #:  46\n204.  The Weldon Amendment states that “[n]one of the funds made available in this \nAct [to the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services] may be \nmade available to a Federal agency or program . . . i f such agency, program, or government \nsubjects any institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the basis that the \nhealth  care  entity  does  not  provide,  pay  for,  provide  coverage  of,  or  refer  for  abortions.”  \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 \nStat. 786, 1111 (2011). \n205.  The Affordable Care Act contains no clear expression of an affirmative intention \nof Congress that employers with religiously motivated objections to the provision of health plans \nthat include access to abortion-inducing products, sterilization, contraception, or related education \nand counseling should be required to provide such plans. \n206.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires employer-based health plans to provide \naccess to abortion-inducing products, contraception, sterilization, and related education.  It does \nnot permit employers or issuers to determine  whether the plan covers abortion, as the  Act \nrequires.  By issuing the U.S. Government Mandate, Defendants have exceeded their authority, \nand ignored the direction of Congress. \n207.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates RFRA.  \n208.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates the First Amendment. \n209.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not in accordance with law and thus violates 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n210.  Plaintiffs  have  no  adequate  or  available  administrative  remedy,  or,  in  the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n211.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 1   Filed 12/10/13   Page 47 of 47 PageID #:  47\n212.  Defendants’ failure to act in accordance with law imposes an immediate and \nongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court:   \n1.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate  violates \nPlaintiffs’ rights under RFRA; \n2.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate  violates \nPlaintiffs’ rights under the First Amendment; \n3.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate  was \npromulgated in violation of the APA; \n4.  Enter  an  injunction  prohibiting  the  Defendants  from  enforcing  the  U.S. \nGovernment Mandate against Plaintiffs; \n5.  Enter an order vacating the U.S. Government Mandate; \n6.  Award Plaintiffs attorneys’ and expert fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \n7.  Award all other relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n \n          By:  /s/ Randal G. Cashiola     \nRandal G.

Hargan,  in  his  official \ncapacity as Acting Secretary of Health and Human Services; R. Alexander  Acosta, in \nhis official capacity as Secretary of Labor; Steven T. Mnuchin, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Treasury; the United States Department of Health and Human Services; \nthe United States Department ofLabor; and the United States Department of the Treasury \n(the \"Government\" or the \"Departments\") (collectively, the \"Parties\"). \nRECITALS \nWHEREAS,  there  is  now  pending a  series of  lawsuits  listed  in  Exhibit  B \n(collectively, the \"Litigation'\") in which Plaintiffs allege that the Government has, among \nother things,  violated  the  Religious  Freedom  Restoration  Act  (\"RFRA\"), 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000bb-I  et seq., by  promulgating and enforcing regulations  pursuant to 42  U.S.C. \n§ 300gg-13 that required Plaintiffs to take actions that facilitated the  provision, through \nor in connection with their  health  plans, of Food and Drug Administration-approved \ncontraceptive methods and abortifacients, as wel I as sterilization procedures and related \npatient education and  counseling to which Plaintiffs object on religious grounds (\"the \nObjectionable Coverage\").  The regulations were found at 26 C.F.R. § 54.98 l 5-27 I 3A \n(Sept. 14, 2015), 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713(a)(l)(iv) (July 19, 2010), 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A (Sept.  14, 2015), 29 C.F.R.  § 2590.715- 2713(a)(l)(iv) (July  19, 2010), 45  C.F.R. \nI of 10 \n\n§ 147.131  (Sept.  14,  2015),  and  45  C.F.R.  §  147.l30(a)(l)(iv)  (July  19,  2010)  (the \n·'Regulations''). \n\\\\'HEREAS,  the  Departments  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  Labor,  and \nTreasury  have  issued new regulations affording Plaintiffs an exemption.  82  Fed.

Reg.21,675 (May4, 2017); Executive \n2of10 \n\nOrder 13765, Minimizing the Economic Burden on the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act Pending Repeal 82 Fed. Reg. 8,351 (Jan. 20, 2017). \nWHEREAS, after years of litigation, the Supreme Court considered the claims \nm  these cases and, instead of resolving the legal issues, remanded the cases to allow the \nparties  to \"resolve any outstanding issues between them.\"  Zubik v.  Burwell, 136 S. Ct. \n1557, 1560(2016). \nWHEREAS, the Supreme Court's remand orders provided that \"the Government \nmay not impose taxes or penalties on [Plaintiffs] for failure to provide the ...  notice\" \nrequired by the Regulations.  Id. at 1561. \nWHEREAS, the  new regulations, the Supreme Court's remand order, and the \nPresident's Executive Orders have placed this litigation in an extraordinary posture. \nWHEREAS,  it is the desire of the  Parties to resolve finally and permanently all \ndisputes, asserted or unasserted, arising out of, or related to the matters set forth, alleged, \nembraced by, or otherwise referred to in  the Litigation. \nNOW THEREFORE,  in  consideration of the  Recitals and  mutual  promises \ncontained herein, including the discontinuation of the pending Litigation, and for other \ngood and valuable consideration hereby deemed received, the Parties agree as follows: \nTERMS OF AGREEMENT \nI.  The  Paities agree  that, under the Supreme Court's decision  in  Burwell v. \nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014), the Affordable Care Act's \"contraceptive \nmandate.\" if applied as set out in 26 C.F.R. § 54.98 l 5-27 l 3(a)(l )(iv) (July 19, 2010),  29 \nC.F.R. §2590.715- 2713(a)(l)(iv) (July 19, 2010), and 45 C.F.R.  §  147.130(a)(l)(iv) (July \n3of10 \n\n19, 2010), would .. impose(] a substantial burden on [Plaintiffs'] exercise of religion,\" id. \nat  2779, and  \"violate[]  RFRA,\" id.  at  2785. The Government therefore agrees that the \n\"contraception mandate\" as described  in  Hobby lobby cannot be  legally enforced. under \nRFRA, against Plaintiffs or their health plans. \n2.  The Government agrees, with respect to all  Plaintiffs, to abide by the terms of \nthe permanent injunction in Zubik v.  Sebelius, 13-cv-1459,  l 3-cv-303. 2013 WL  6922024 \n(W.D.  Pa. Dec.  20, 2013),  as  it  relates to the Objectionable  Coverage.  The Government \naccordingly will treat Plaintiffs and their health plans, including their insurance issuers and/or \nthird  party  administrators  in  connection  with  those  health  plans,  as  exempt  from  the \nRegulations or any materially similar regulation or agency  policy.  A materially similar \nregulation or agency policy includes any requirement that Plaintiffs, their insurance issuers, or \ntheir third-pa11y  administrators provide any of the Objectionable Coverage through or in \nconnection with Plaintiffs' health plans, which means: \na.  Plaintiffs (and their insurers and third-party administrators acting in connection \nwith  Plaintiffs'  health  plans)  may  provide  health  coverage  without  the \nObjectionable  Coverage,  and  no  procedure  for  providing  any  of  the \nObjectionable Coverage may require any action by Plaintiffs; \nb.  If the Objectionable Coverage is provided, it may not be provided as part of any \nhealth plan sponsored by Plaintiffs,  but instead must be  provided through a \nseparate and distinct health plan or other arrangement that is separate and distinct \nfrom Plaintiffs' health plan; \n4of10 \n\nc.  Plaintiffs or their health plans may not be required to pay for the provision of the \nObjectionable Coverage, either directly or indirectly (though Plaintiffs are not \nexcused from paying generally applicable taxes); \nd.  An insurance or health plan card issued in conjunction with Plaintiffs' health \nplans may not be used by any person to obtain any of the products or services \nincluded  within  the  Objectionable  Coverage,  or payment  or  reimbursement \ntherefor: \ne.  No  person  may  receive  the  Objectionable  Coverage  as  an  automatic \nconsequence of enrollment in any health plan sponsored by Plaintiffs; \nf.  If the Government seeks to provide the Objectionable Coverage to individuals \nparticipating  in  Plaintiffs' health plans,  such  provision may  only be through \nseparate enrollments by those individuals in a separate and distinct health plan \nor other separate and distinct arrangement to obtain the Objectionable Coverage; \nand \ng.  Any  communications  regarding  the  Objectionable  Coverage,  other  than \ndisclosures in plan documents required by federal  law that the Objectionable \nCoverage is not covered by the plan or notice provided for in footnote I of this \nagreement, must be separate from communications relating to Plaintiffs' health \nplans. \n3.  The Government further agrees to withdraw any  letters sent to Plaintiffs· \nissuers and/or third-party administrators. pursuant to 29 C.F.R. §2590.715-2713A and 45 \n5 of I 0 \n\nC.F.R.  § 147.131, as  they  relate to  the  provision of any of the Objectionable Coverage \nwithin 14 days of the effective date of this agreement.1 \n4.  The Government further agrees, in  light of interim relief ordered  by several \ncourts. including the Supreme Court  in  Zubik, that neither Plaintiffs that are  party to  this \nAgreement nor their health plans, insurers, or third-party administrators acting in connection \nwith Plaintiffs' health plans shall be subject to any penalties or other adverse consequences, \nsince August 2011, as a result of their non-comp Ii ance with any law or regulation requiring the \nprovision of the Objectionable Coverage that the government is prohibited from enforcing by \nthe terms of this agreement. \n5.  Notwithstanding this Agreement, the Plaintiffs retain their full  legal rights to \nchallenge any new law, regulation, or other requirement that the government may enact or \nimpose relating to the provision of Objectionable Coverage and to challenge or defend against \nsuch action on any grounds they choose (including the Constitution, federal law, and/or this \nAgreement). Nothing herein shall  be construed as an admission or indication that any law, \nregulation, or other requirement would be lawful or unobjectionable to Plaintiffs. \n6.  The Parties agree to resolve all  proceedings identified above and to file such \npapers as are necessary to terminate the Litigation.  In all cases where appeals are currently \npending, the parties will file dismissals of appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure \n1 The  effective  date  of the withdrawal  may  be contingent on proper  notice  being  given  to \nparticipants. If contraception coverage  is currently  being  offered  by  an  issuer or third-party \nadministrator. the cessation of coverage would be effective no sooner than the first day of the first \nplan year that begins thirty days after the date of this Settlement Agreement (to allow for the \nprovision of notice to plan participants in cases where contraceptive benefits will no longer be \nprovided). Alternatively, sixty-days advance notice may be given pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 300gg \nl 5(d)(4) if applicable. \n6of10 \n\n42(b). After the appeals are dismissed, the parties agree that they will jointly file stipulations of \ndismissal or motions for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41 (a), except in cases \nwhere there is a final judgment in the district court. This agreement shall not be effective until \nthe Parties file dismissals of all appeals currently pending. \n7.  The Government agrees to pay Plaintiffs $3 million in costs and fees. \n8.  The Parties agree that this Agreement constitutes a good-faith settlement of the \nLitigation for good and valuable consideration and acknowledge that it is entered into freely \nand voluntarily. \n9.  The Parties further agree that this Agreement has been fully read and understood \nby them, and that each of them has received independent legal advice from their respective \nattorney(s) as to the effect and  import of its provisions. The Parties  further agree that this \nAgreement is being entered into for the express purpose and intention of making and entering \ninco a full and final compromise, adjustment, and settlement of all claims which were or could \nhave been asserted in the Litigation, whether or not referred to therein. \nI 0.  This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement between Plaintiffs and \nthe Government. and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, and discussions between \nthe Parties with respect to the subject matter covered hereby. It is expressly understood and \nagreed that this Agreement may not be  altered, amended, waived, modified, or otherwise \nchanged except by writing, duly executed by authorized representatives of Plaintiffs and the \nGovernment, respectively. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that they will make no \nclaim at any time or place that this Agreement has been orally supplemented, modified, or \naltered. \n7of 10 \n\n11.  A II signatories represent that they have authority to enter into this Agreement on \nbehalf of their respective clients. \n12.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts. \nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement is executed as of the date and year first \nindicated above. \n8 of10 \n\nof!O \n\nON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT: \nDeputy Assistant Attorney General \nCivil Division, U.S. Department of Justice \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, District of Columbia 20530 \nCounsel.for Defendants \n10of10 \n\nEXHIBIT A \n\nEXHIBIT A \nThe term \"Plaintiffs,\" as used in the attached settlement agreement includes the following \norganizations and individuals; their subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors; and related entities \nthat offer coverage through the health plan of any signatory: \n•  The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York \n•  The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, New York \n•  Catholic Health Care System \n•  Catholic Health Services of Long Island \n•  Cardinal Spellman High School \n•  Monsignor Farrell High School \n•  Most Reverend David A.

The Catho lic  Diocese  of Beaumont (“the Diocese”) is \nentirely  exempt from   the  contraceptive cove rage  requirement.  And Catholic Charities of \nSoutheast Texas, Inc. (“Catholic Charities”)  is eligible for a regulatory accommodation that \nrelieves it from having to contract, arrange, pay or refer for contra ceptive coverage, and that in \nno way prevents it from continuing to voice its disapproval of contraception or from encouraging \nits  employees  to  refrain from   using con traception.  To  avail itself of this significant \naccommodation,  Catholic Charities need do not hing  more  than provide its third-party  \nadministrator (TPA) with a copy of a self-certification that it is eligible for the accommodation. \nCatholic Charities’ TPA has no obligation to provide contraceptive coverage, either. It is hard to \nfathom how the mere act of requiring Catholic Charities to complete this self-certification could \namount to a “substantial” burden, especially where—as here—the certification requires noting of \nCatholic Charities’ TPA or anyone else with respective to contraceptive coverage. \nNotably, both plaintiffs offer e mployees health coverage through the Diocese' s health \nplan, which, according to plaintiffs, is a sel f-insured “church plan.” Compl. ¶¶ 42, 44. While \ndefendants continue to consider potential options to fully and appropriately extend the consumer \nprotections provided by the regula tions to self-insured church  plans, they acknowledge that, \nunder current law, they lack authority to require  the TPAs of self-insured church plans to make \nthe separate payments for contraceptive services for participants and beneficiaries in such plans \nunder the accommodation. \nFor this and several other reasons, plainti ffs’ motion for a tem porary restraining order \nshould be denied and this case  should be dismissed or summary judgment should be granted in \nfavor of the government. At the outset, as the court in Archbishop of Washington v. Sebelius, No. \n1:13-cv-01441-ABJ  (D.D.C. Dec. 20, 2013), recen tly  recognized, with respect to sim ilarly \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 15 of 62 PageID #:  215\nsituated organizations that offer insurance to their employees through a self-insured church plan, \nthe plaintiffs here lack standing to assert th eir claims. As noted above, because th e Diocese’s \nplan is a self-insured church  plan, the government lacks authority to require plaintiffs’ TPA t o \nmake the separate payments for contraceptive serv ices for participants and beneficiaries in the \nplan  under the accommodation. Becau se  both  plaintiffs offer coverage to   their em ployees \nthrough  the Diocese’s plan, the  injury  of which plaintiffs  complain—that  the regulations \nsomehow require them to facilitate access to c ontraceptive services to which they object on \nreligious grounds or to contract, arrange, or pa y for such services—simply does not apply to \nplaintiffs here and, as a result, plaintiffs lack standing. See id slip op. at 46-51. \nEven  if plaintiffs had standing,   however,  their assertion   that th ese  accommodations \nthemselves  violate their rights und er  RFRA, t he  First A mendment,  and the Adm inistrative \nProcedure Act (APA) would fail. W ith respect to plaintiffs’ RFRA claim, plaintiffs cannot \nestablish a substantial burden on their religiou s exercise—as they must—because, as noted \nabove,  the governm ent  cannot requi re  plaintiffs’ TPA to provide separate paym ents  for \ncontraceptive services to the participants and  beneficiaries of the plan. Thus, the regulations \nimpose absolutely no burden on plaintiffs’ religious exercise, much less a substantial burden as \nrequired under RFRA. Furtherm ore, even if the governm ent could require plaintiffs’ TPA to \nmake the separate payments, the regulations would not require plaintiffs to change their behavior \nin  any significant way. Plaintiffs are not re quired  to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for \ncontraceptive coverage. To the contrary, plaintiffs are free to continue to refuse to do so, to voice \ntheir  disapproval of contracep tion, and to encourage their em ployees to refrain from  using \ncontraceptive services. Plaintiffs contend that the need  for Catholic Charities to self-certify in \norder  to ob tain  the ac commodation  is itself   a  burden on their religious exercise. But the \nchallenged  regulations require Ca tholic  Charities  only to   self-certify  that it has   a religious  \nobjection to providing cont raceptive coverage and otherwise m eets the criteria for an eligible \norganization, and to share that self-certification with its TPA. In other words, Catholic Charities \nis required only to convey to its TPA that it is  a non-profit religious organization that objects to \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 16 of 62 PageID #:  216\nproviding contraceptive services, which it has done or would have to do voluntarily anyway even \nabsent these regulations in order to ensure that  it is not responsible fo r contracting, arranging, \npaying, or referring for such coverage. Plaintiffs can hardly claim that it is a violation of RFRA  \nto require them to do alm ost exactly what they  would do in the ordinary course, absent the \nregulations. See Univ. of Notre Dame v. Seb elius, No. 3:13-cv-01276-PPS-CAN, slip op. at 17-\n24 (N.D. Ind. Dec. 20, 2013) (concluding that th e accommodation does not impose a substantial \nburden on the plaintiff’s  religious exercise); Priests for Life v. U.S. De p’t of Health & Human \nServs., No. 1:13-cv-1261-EGS, slip op. at 17-30 (D.D.C. Dec. 19, 2013) (same). \nFurther,  plaintiffs’  challenge rests   largely on   the theo ry  that ev en  the extrem ely \nattenuated connection between them and the  independent and wholly voluntary provision by \ntheir TPA of payments for contraceptive services to which they object on religious grounds—but \nfor which plaintiffs pay nothing—amounts to a s ubstantial burden on thei r religious exercise. \nThis  cannot be. Regardless of how plaintiffs  frame  their religious beliefs, courts m ust \nindependently consider whether a given law imposes a substantial burden on those beliefs. The \nregulations impose, at most, only the m ost de minimis burden on plaintiffs’  religious exercise, \ntoo slight and attenuated to be  “substantial” under RFRA, and little d ifferent from plaintiffs’ \npayment of salaries to their employees, which those employees can also use to buy contraceptive \nservices if they so choose. \nMoreover, even if the challenged regulations were deemed to impose a substantial burden \non  plaintiffs’ religious   exercise, the regulatio ns  would not violate RFRA because they are  \nnarrowly tailored to serve two compelling interests: improving the health of women and newborn \nchildren, and equalizing the provision of preventive care for women and men so that women can \nparticipate in the workforce, and society more generally, on an equal playing field with men. \nPlaintiffs’ First Amendment claims are equally meritless. Indeed, nearly every court to \nconsider similar First Amendment challenges to the prior version of the regulations has rejected \nthe claims, and their analysis applies here. Plaintiffs’ APA claims also fail. The regulations are in \naccordance with federal law, and defendants’ interpretation of the regulations is not erroneous.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 17 of 62 PageID #:  217\nFor these reasons, and those explained below,  defendants’ motion to dism iss or, in the \nalternative, for summary judgment should be  granted, and plaintiffs’ motion for a tem porary \nrestraining order should be denied. \nBACKGROUND \nBefore the Patient Protection and Affordab le Care Act (“ACA”), Pub. L. No. 111-148, \n124 Stat. 119 (2010), many Americans did not receive the preventive health care they needed to \nstay healthy, avoid or delay the  onset of disease, lead productive lives, and reduce health care \ncosts. Due largely to co st, Americans used preventive services at about half the recommended \nrate. See INST. OF MED., CLINICAL PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR WOMEN: CLOSING THE GAPS 19-\n20, 109 (2011) (“IOM R EP.”), AR at 317-18, 407. 1 Section 1001 of the ACA—which includes \nthe preventive services coverage provision relevant here—seeks to cure this problem by making \npreventive care accessible and affordable for many more Americans. Specifically, the provision \nrequires all group health plans and health insurance issuers that offer non-grandfathered group or \nindividual health coverage to provide coverage  for certain preventive  services without cost-\nsharing, including, “[for] women, such additional preventive care and screenings . . . as provided \nfor in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration \n[(HRSA)].” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). \nBecause  there  were n o  existing HRSA gui delines  relating to  preventive  care and \nscreening for women, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requested that the \nInstitute of Medicine (IOM) develop recommendations to implement the requirement to provide \ncoverage, without cost-sharing, of pr eventive services for women. IOM REP. at 2, AR at 300. 2 \nAfter conducting an extensive science-based re view, IOM recommended that HRSA guidelines \ninclude,  among  other things, well-wom an  visits;  breastfeeding support; dom estic  violence \nscreening; and, as relevant  here, “the full range of [FDA ]-approved contraceptive methods, \nsterilization procedures, and patient educat ion and counseling for wom en with reproductive \n                                                           \n1 Where appropriate, defendants have provided parallel citations to the Administrative Record (AR). \n2 IOM, which was established by the National Academy of Sciences in 1970, is funded by Congress to provide \nexpert advice to the federal government on matters of public health. IOM REP. at iv, AR at 289. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 18 of 62 PageID #:  218\ncapacity.” Id. at 10-12, AR at 308-10. IOM determ ined that coverage, without cost-sharing, for \nthese services is necessary to increase access to such serv ices, and thereby reduce unintended \npregnancies (and the n egative health outcomes that disproportionately accompany unintended \npregnancies) and promote healthy birth spacing. See id. at 102-03, AR at 400-01.3 \nOn August 1, 2011, HRSA adopted guidelines  consistent with IOM’s recommendations, \nsubject to an exemption relating to certain religious employers authorized by regulations issued \nthat same day (the “2011 amended interim final regulations”). See HRSA, Women’s Preventive \nServices: Required Health Plan Coverage Guid elines (“HRSA Guidelines”), AR at 283 -84.4 \nGroup health plans established or maintained by these religious employers (and associated group \nhealth insurance coverage) are ex empt from any requirement to cover contraceptive services \nconsistent with HRSA’s guidelines. See id.; 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). \nIn February 2012, the government adopted in final regulations the definition of “religious \nemployer”  contained in the 2011 a mended  interim  final regulations wh ile  also creating a  \ntemporary  enforcement  safe harbor for non-gr andfathered  group health plans sponsored by \ncertain non-profit organizations with religious  objections to contraceptive coverage (and any \nassociated group health insurance coverage). See 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8726-27 (Feb. 15, 2012), \nAR at 213-14. The government committed to undertake a new rulemaking during the safe harbor \nperiod to adopt new regulations to further accommodate non-grandfathered non-profit religious \n                                                           \n3 At least twenty-eight states have laws requiring health insurance policies that cover prescription drugs to also \nprovide coverage for FDA-approved contraceptives. See Guttmacher Institute, State Policies in Brief: Insurance \nCoverage of Contraceptives (June 2013), AR at 1023-26. \n4 To qualify for the religious employer exemption contained in the 2011 amended interim final regulations, an \nemployer had to meet the following criteria: \n \n(1)  The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization; \n \n(2)  the organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of the organization; \n  \n(3)  the organization serves primarily persons who share the religious tenets of the organization; and  \n \n(4)  the  organization  is a non profit  organization  as  described  in  section 60 33(a)(1)  and  section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. \n \n76 Fed. Reg. 46,621, 46,623 (Aug. 3, 2011), AR at 220. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 19 of 62 PageID #:  219\norganizations’ religious objections to  covering contraceptive services.  Id. at 8728, AR at 215. \nThe  regulations challenged here (the “2013 fina l  rules”) repres ent  the culm ination  of that \nprocess. See 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870 (July 2, 2013), AR at 1-31; see also 77 Fed. Reg. 16,501 (Mar. \n21, 2012) (Advance Notice of Proposed Rulem aking (ANPRM)), AR at 186-93; 78 Fed. Reg. \n8456 (Feb. 6, 2013) (Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)), AR at 165-85. \nThe 2013 final rules represent a significant  accommodation by the governm ent of the \nreligious objections of certain non-profit religious organizations while promoting two important \npolicy  goals. First, the regu lations  provide wom en  who wo rk  for non-profit religious \norganizations with access to contraceptive coverage without cost sharing, thereby advancing the \ncompelling government interests in safeguarding  public health and ensuring that w omen have \nequal access to health care. Second, the regulations advance these interests in a narrowly tailored \nfashion  that does not require non-profit religious   organizations with re ligious  objections  to \nproviding contraceptive coverage to contract, pay, arrange, or refer for that coverage. \nThe 2013 final rules simplify and clarify the religious employer exemption by eliminating \nthe first three criteria and clarifying the fourth criterion. See supra note 5. Under the 2013 final \nrules, a “religious employer” is “an organization that is organized and operates as a nonprofit \nentity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (a)(3)(A)(iii) of the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986, as amended,” which refers to churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or \nassociations of churches, and the exclusively religious activities of any religious order. 45 C.F.R. \n§ 147.131(a). The changes made to the definition of religious employer in the 2013 final rules \nare intended to ensure “that an otherwise exempt plan is not disqualified because the employer’s \npurposes extend beyond the inculcation of relig ious values or becau se the employer hires or \nserves people of different religious faiths.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874, AR at 6. \nThe 2013 final rules also estab lish accommodations with respect to the contraceptive \ncoverage  requirement  for group health plans  established  or maintained by “eligible \norganizations” (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans). Id. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 20 of 62 PageID #:  220\nat 39,875-80, AR at 7-12; 45 C.F.R. §  147.131(b). An “eligible organization” is an organization \nthat satisfies the following criteria: \n \n(1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive \nservices required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on account of religious \nobjections. \n \n(2) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity. \n \n(3) The organization holds itself out as a religious organization. \n \n(4) The organization self-certifies, in a form and manner specified by the S ecretary, \nthat it satisfies the criteria in paragra phs (b)(1) through (3)  of this section, and \nmakes such self-certification available  for examination upon request by the first \nday of the first p lan year to which  the accommodation in paragraph (c) of this  \nsection applies. \n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b); see also 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874-75, AR at 6-7. \nUnder the 2013 final rules, an eligible orga nization is not required “to contract, arrange, \npay, or refer for contraceptive coverage” to w hich it has religious objections. 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39,874, AR at 6. To be relieved of any such obligations, the 2013 final rules require only that an \neligible organization complete a self-certification form stating that it is an elig ible organization \nand provide a copy of that self-cer tification to its issuer or TPA. Id. at 39,878-79, AR at 10-11. \nIts  participants  and benef iciaries,  however, w ill  still ben efit  from  separate  payments  for \ncontraceptive services without cost sharing or other charge. Id. at 39,874, AR at 6. In the case of \nan  organization with an insured group hea lth  plan—such as Catholic Charities—the \norganization’s  health in surance  issuer, upon recei pt  of the self-certification, m ust  provide \nseparate payments to plan participants and bene ficiaries for contraceptive services without cost \nsharing, premium, fee, or other ch arge to plan participants or be neficiaries, or to the eligible \norganization or its plan. See id. at 39,875-77, AR at 7-9. And in the case of an organization with \na self-insured group health plan—such as other  plaintiffs here—the organization’s TPA, upon \nreceipt of the self-certification,  will provide or arrange separa te payments for contraceptive \nservices for participants and beneficiaries in the plan; again, without cost-sharing, premium, fee, \nor other charge to plan participants or beneficiaries, or to the eligible organization or its plan. See \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 21 of 62 PageID #:  221\nid. at 39,879-80, AR at 11-12. Any costs in curred by the TPA will be reim bursed through an \nadjustment to Federally-facilitated Exchange (FFE) user fees. See id. at 39,880, AR at 12. \nThe 2013 final rules generally apply to group h ealth plans and health insurance issuers \nfor plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014,  see id. at 39,872, AR at 4, except that the \namendments to the religious employer exemption apply to group health plans and group health \ninsurance issuers for plan years beginning on or after August 1, 2013, see id. at 39,871, AR at 3. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nDefendants move to dismiss this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) \nand  12(b)(6), respectively. Th e  party invoking federal juri sdiction  bears the burden of \nestablishing its existence, and the Court must determine whether it has subject matter jurisdiction \nbefore addressing the merits of a claim. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94-\n95, 104 (1998). Under Rule 12(b)(6), “the ten et that a court must accept as true all of th e \nallegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of \nthe elements of a cause of action, supported by  mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \nTo the extent that the Court must consider the administrative record in addition to the \nface of the complaint, defendants move, in the alternative, for summary judgment under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 56. A pa rty is entitled to summ ary judgment where the administrative \nrecord demonstrates “that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the moving \nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \nThis memorandum also responds to plaintiffs ’ motion for a tem porary restraining order \nand preliminary injunction. A temporary restraining order is an “extraordinary remedy that may \nonly be awarded upon a clear showing that th e plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. \nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008). A plaintiff “must establish that he is  \nlikely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of  \npreliminary relief, that the balance of  equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 22 of 62 PageID #:  222\npublic interest.” Id. at 20.5 \n \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  THIS  CASE SHOULD BE DISMI SSED  BECAUSE  THE COURT LACKS \nSUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION \n  Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and their \nentire  case, should be dism issed  at the outset for lack of   standing. “[T]he   irreducible \nconstitutional minimum of standing” requires that  a plaintiff (1) have suffered an injury in fact, \n(2) that is caused by the defendant’s conduct, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable \nruling. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). As to the injury prong, a \nplaintiff must demonstrate that it has “suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally \nprotected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) ac tual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical.” Id. at 560 (quotations omitted). Allegations of possible future injury \ndo not suffice; rather, “[a] threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in \nfact.” Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158 (1990) (quotation omitted). \n  The harm alleged by plaintiffs is that, to  avail themselves of the accommodations, the \nchallenged regulations require them to engage in actions that “facilitate” and/or make them the \n“trigger” for the provision of paym ents for contraceptive services by a third party.  See Pls.’ \nMem.  at 9. The Diocese’s plan, however, is a  self-insured  church plan, Com pl.  ¶ 42,  and \ndefendants lack regulatory author ity to require the TPAs of such  self-insured church plans to \nmake the separate payments for contraceptive services for participants and beneficiaries in such \nplans under the accommodation. \n  In general, under the challe nged regulations, when a TPA  receives a copy of the self-\ncertification from an eligible employer that sponsors a self-insured group health plan, that TPA \nbecomes  an ERISA Se ction  3(16), 29 U.S.C.   § 1002(16), plan adm inistrator  and claim s \n                                                           \n5 Plaintiffs’ reliance on out-of-circuit, pre-Winter case law to suggest that the relevant factors “merely ‘guide the \ndiscretion of the court,’” Pls.’ Mem. of Law in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. for TRO & Prelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ Mem.”) at 11, ECF \nNo. 3, is in significant tension with Supreme Court’s requirement that “[a] plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction \nmust establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,” Winter, 555 U.S. at 20 (emphasis added); Choice Inc. of \nTexas v. Greenstein, 691 F.3d 710, 717 n.35 (5th Cir. 2012). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 23 of 62 PageID #:  223\nadministrator for the purpose of providing the separate payments for contraceptive services. See \n29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b). Thus, the contraceptive coverage requirements can be enforced against \nsuch TPAs through defendant Department of Labor’s ERISA enforcement authority. See 78 Fed. \nReg. at 39,879-39,880, AR at 11-12. But church plans  are specifically excluded from the am bit \nof ERISA. See 29 U.S.C. § 1003(b)(2). Thus, ERISA enforcement authority is not available with \nrespect to the TPAs of self-insured church plans under the accommodation, and the government \ncannot compel such TPAs under such authority to provide contraceptive coverage to self-insured \nchurch plan participants and beneficiaries under the accom modation, including the plaintiffs’ \nemployees and their covered dependents. \n  The Diocese is entirely exempt from the regulations, and Catholic Charities remains \neligible  for the acco mmodations  under the final regu lation  promulgated  by  defendant \nDepartment  of the Treasury, 26 C.F.R.  §  54.9815-2713A, and theref ore  need not contract, \narrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage. 6 And neither plaintiffs’ plan nor their TPA is \nrequired under the regulations to  provide separate payments for contraceptive services or to \ncontract or otherwise arrange with a third party for such payments to be made. In short, under the \nchallenged regulations, there is abso lutely no connection between plaintiffs and contraceptive \ncoverage. Thus, the injury of which plaintiffs  complain—that the regulations somehow require \nthem to facilitate access to contraceptive services to which they object on religiou s grounds—\nsimply does not apply to plaintiffs here. 7 Because plaintiffs lack standing to assert their claims, \nthis case should be dism issed in its entirety.  See Archbishop of Washington , slip op. at 46-51 \n(finding that similarly situated plaintiffs lacked standing because there is no “concrete, actual or \nimminent, cognizable injury in fact”). \n \n                                                           \n6  The  same  is  true  with  respect  to  any  other  entity  that  qualifies  as an   “eligible  organization”  under  the \naccommodations, whether or not that organization is a plaintiff in this action. \n7 Nor can plaintiffs complain that their TPAs might voluntarily elect to provide contraceptive coverage \nnotwithstanding the fact that defendants do not have the authority to require them to do so, as this allegation would \nbe far too speculative for the purposes of Article III standing. See Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, \n1147 (2013). \n1 0\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 24 of 62 PageID #:  224\n \nII.  PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS LACK MERIT \n \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Religious Freedom Restoration Act Claim Is Without Merit \n \n1.  The  regulations do not substantia lly  burden plaintiffs’ exercise of \nreligion \nUnder  RFRA, Pub. L. No. 103-141, 107 St at.  1488 (1993) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000bb-1 et seq.), the federal government “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of \nreligion” unless that burden is the least restrictive means to further a compelling governm ental \ninterest. 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1. Importantly, “only substantial burdens on the exercise of religion \ntrigger the compelling interest requirement.” Henderson v. Kennedy, 253 F.3d 12, 17 (D.C. Cir. \n2001) (emphasis added). “A substantial burden exists when government action puts ‘substantial \npressure on an adherent to m odify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.’”  Kaemmerling v. \nLappin, 553 F.3d 669, 678 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing Thomas v. Review Bd. of the Ind. Emp’t Sec. \nDiv., 450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981)); see also Notre Dame, slip op. at 16-17; Priests for Life, slip op. \nat 20. “An inconsequential or de minimis burden on religious practice does not rise to this level, \nnor does a burden on activity unim portant to the adherent’s religious schem e.” Kaemmerling, \n553 F.3d at 678; see also Garner v. Kennedy, 713 F.3d 237, 241-42 (5th Cir. 2013) (“In order to \nshow a substantial burden, the plaintiff must show that the challenged action ‘truly pressures the \nadherent to significantly m odify his religious behavior and signi ficantly violate his religious \nbeliefs.’”). \n  For three reasons, plaintiffs  cannot show that the challeng ed regulations substantially \nburden their religious exercise. For three reasons,  plaintiffs cannot show that the challenged \nregulations  substantially burden  their  religious  exercise. First, as ex plained  above,  because \nplaintiffs’ plan is a self-insured church plan, the challenged regulations do not require plaintiffs’ \nTPA to provide separate payments for contraceptive services, or to contract or otherwise arrange \nwith a third party for such payments to be made with respect to the participants and beneficiaries \nof  plaintiffs’ plan. The regulations, therefore,   impose  absolutely no burden on plaintiffs’  \n1 1\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 25 of 62 PageID #:  225\nreligious exercise, let alone a substantial burden.  See supra Section I.8 Second, even assuming \nthe  regulations  do  require plaintiffs’ TPA to provide  separate  payments  for contraceptive \nservices—which the regulations do not 9—the regulations require virtually nothing of plaintiffs, \nand certainly do not require plaintiffs to modify their behavior in any meaningful way. Thus, the \nregulations cannot be deemed to impose any more than a  de minimis burden on plaintiffs—let \nalone a substantial one. Third, even if this Court finds that the regulations im pose some burden \non plaintiffs’ religious exercise, any such burden would be far too attenuated to be substantial. \n \na.  The regulations impose no more t han a de minimis burden on \nplaintiffs’  exercise of religion  because  the regulations require \nvirtually nothing of plaintiffs \nTo put this case in its simplest terms, plaintiffs challenge regulations that require them to \ndo next to nothing, except what they would have to do even in the absence of the regulations. \nThe Diocese is entirely exempt from the contraceptive co verage requirement.10 And Catholic \n                                                           \n8 Plaintiffs’ heavy reliance on out-of-circuit cases involving for-profit companies (Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. \nSebelius, 723 F.3d 1114 (10th Cir. 2013) (en banc), cert. granted, No. 13-354; Korte v. Sebelius, 735 F.3d 654 (7th \nCir. 2013); and Gilardi v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 733 F.3d 1208 (D.C. Cir. 2013)), as well as the \ndistrict court ruling in Zubik v. Sebelius, No. 2:13-cv-01459, 2013 WL 6118696 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 21, 2013), is \nmisplaced. None of those ca ses involved eligible organizations that offer health coverage through a self-insured \nchurch plan, and thus, the courts had no occasion to address the arguments defendants raise here. Furthermore, those \nout-of-circuit for-profit company cases are inapposite because for-profit corporations—unlike plaintiffs—do not \nqualify for the religious employer exemption or the accommodations for eligible organizations. See 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39,875, AR at 7. Thus, for example, the regulations require for-profit companies to contract or otherwise arrange \nand pay for contraceptive coverage for the participants and beneficiaries of their group health plans. Plaintiffs, by \ncontrast, are in a  markedly different position. As previously explained, the Diocese is exempt, and in order to be \nrelieved of the obligation to contract or otherwise arrange and pay for contraceptive coverage, Catholic Charities \nmust only fulfill the self-certification requirement. Similarly, the district court in Zubik was wrong to rely on those \nfor-profit company cases. The Zubik court’s conclusion that the regulations at issue in that case (and in this one) \nimpose a substantial burden on the plaintiffs in that case—which was rendered without citation to any legal \nauthority, id.at *24-27—is unpersuasive. \n9 Defendants will make this assumption in the remainder of their RFRA argument because plaintiffs’ claims fail \nregardless of whether the challenged regulations require anything of their third-party TPAs.  \n10 Plaintiffs state that the scope of the religious employer exemption adopted in the 2013 final rules is narrower than \nthat contemplated in the ANPRM. See, e.g., Pls.’ Mem. at 8. This contention is both false and irrelevant. Plaintiffs \ncontend that, in the ANPRM, the government suggested that non-exempt organizations that participate in the health \nplan of an exempt organization would benefit from the exemption. But defendants never advanced that interpretation \nof the exemption. Plaintiffs’ misleading quotation from the ANPRM, see id., does not indicate otherwise when read \nin full. In the ANPRM, defendants said: \n \nIn addition, we note that this exemption is available to religious employers in a variety of \narrangements.  For  example,  a C atholic  elementary  school  may  be a di stinct  common-law \nemployer from the Catholic diocese with which it is affiliated. If the school’s employees receive \nhealth coverage through a plan established or maintained by the school, and the school meets the \n1 2\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 26 of 62 PageID #:  226\nCharities, as an eligible orga nization, is not require d to contract, arrange , pay, or refer for \ncontraceptive coverage. To the contrary, Catholic Charities is free to continue to refuse to do so, \nto voice its disapproval of cont raception, and to encourage its em ployees to refrain from using \ncontraceptive services. Catholic Charities need only fulfill the self-certification requirement and \nprovide  the  completed  self-certification  to its   TPA. Ca tholic  Charities need not pay for \ncontraceptive  services  to their employees. In stead,  third parties—pl aintiffs’  TPA—provide \npayments  for contraceptive s ervices,  at no cost   to p laintiffs.  In short, with   respect  to \ncontraceptive coverage, the non-exempt plaintiff, Catholic Charities, need not do anything m ore \nthan it did prior to the promulgation of the challenged regulations—that is, to inform its TPA that \nit objects to providing contraceptive coverage in  order to ensure that it is not responsible for \ncontracting, arranging, paying,  or referring for such coverage . Thus, the regulations do not \nrequire plaintiffs “to modify [their] religious behavior in any way.”  Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at \n679. The Court’s inquiry should end here. A law  cannot be a substantial burden on religious \nexercise when “it involves no ac tion or forbearance on [ plaintiffs’] part, nor . . . otherwise \ninterfere[s] with any religious act in which [plaintiffs] engage[].” Id.; see also Notre Dame, slip \nop. at 17-24; Priests for Life, slip op. at 21-27. \nBecause  the  regulations  place no   burden  at  all  on plaintiffs, they   plainly place no \ncognizable  burden on their religio us  exercise. Plaintiffs’ contrary argum ent  rests on an \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \ndefinition of a religious employer in the final regulations, then the religious employer exemption \napplies. If, instead, the same school provides health coverage for its employees through the same \nplan under which the diocese provides coverage for its employees, and the diocese is exempt from \nthe requirement to cover contraceptive services, then neither the diocese nor the school is required \nto offer contraceptive coverage to its employees. \n \n77 Fed. Reg. at 16,502 (emphasis added), AR at 187. This passage in no way suggests that a non-exempt employer \n(i.e., one that does not meet the definition of “religious employer” in the final rules) would become exempt simply \nby providing coverage through the same plan as an exempt employer. Far from it, both hypotheticals presented in \nthe ANPRM deal with a school—the  “same” school—that itself meets the definition of an e xempt religious \nemployer. Defendants’ decision to exempt entities on an employer-by-employer basis is thus consistent with \ndefendants’  prior  statements  in  the  ANPRM. More over,  the age ncies  expressly  “propose[d]  to  make  the \naccommodation or the religious employer exemption available on an employer-by-employer basis” in the NPRM. 78 \nFed. Reg. at 8467, AR at 176. Finally, even if the scope of the exemption in the final rules were different from what \nwas originally proposed in the ANPRM—which it is not—plaintiffs have not indicated why that would be improper. \nIn fact, that is the very purpose of the rulemaking process. See, e.g., Ne. Md. Waste Disposal Auth. v. EPA, 358 F.3d \n936, 951 (D.C. Cir. 2004). \n1 3\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 27 of 62 PageID #:  227\nunprecedented and sweeping theory of what it mean s for religious exercise to be burdened. Not  \nonly  do plaintiffs wa nt  to be free from   contracting,  arranging, paying, or referring for \ncontraceptive  services for their employees—w hich,  under these regulations, they are—but \nplaintiffs would also prevent anyone else from providing such coverage to their employees, who \nmight not subscribe to plaintiffs’ religious beliefs. That this is the de facto impact of plaintiffs’ \nstated objections is made clear by their sugg estion that RFRA is violated whenever they are a  \n“but-for cause” of the provision of  the objectionable products and services. See, e.g., Compl. \n¶ 84. This theory would mean, for example, that even the government would not realistically be \nable to provide contraceptive coverage to plaintiffs’ employees (as plaintiffs elsewhere suggest), \nbecause it would be “trigger[ed],”  id.; Pls.’ Mem. at 9, by plainti ffs’ refusal to provide such \ncoverage themselves. But RFRA is a shield, not a sword,  see O’Brien v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & \nHuman Servs., 894 F. Supp. 2d 1149, 1158-60 (E.D. Mo. 2012),  appeal pending, No. 12-3357 \n(8th Cir.), and accordingly it does not prevent the government from providing alternative means \nof achieving important statutory objectives once it has provided a religious accommodation. Cf. \nBowen  v.  Roy,  476 U.S. 693, 699 (1986) (“The Free Ex ercise  Clause sim ply  cannot be \nunderstood to require the Governm ent to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that com port \nwith the religious beliefs of particular citizens.”). \nPlaintiffs’  RFRA challenge is s imilar  to the  claim  that the D.C. Circuit rejected in \nKaemmerling. There, a federal prisoner objected to the FBI’s collection of his DNA profile. 553 \nF.3d  at 678. In concluding that this collecti on  did not substantially  burden  the prisoner’s \nreligious exercise, the court concluded that “[t]he extraction and storage of DNA information are \nentirely activities of the FBI, in which Kae mmerling plays no role an d which occur af ter the \nBOP has taken his fluid or tissue sample (to which he does not object).” Id. at 679. In the court’s \nview, “[a]lthough the government’s activities with his fluid or tissue sample after the BOP takes \nit may offend Kaemmerling’s religious beliefs, they cannot be sa id to hamper his religious \nexercise because they do not pressure [him] to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.” Id. \n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The same is true here, where the provision of \n1 4\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 28 of 62 PageID #:  228\ncontraceptive services is “entirely [an] activit[y] of [a third party], in which [plaintiffs] play[] no \nrole.”  Id.  As  in  Kaemmerling,  “[a]lthough the [third party]’s   activities . . . m ay  offend \n[plaintiffs’] religious beliefs, they cannot be said to hamper [their] religious exercise.” Id. \n  Perhaps understanding the tenuous ground on whic h their RFRA claim rests, given that \nthe regulations do not require them to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive services, \nplaintiffs attempt to circumvent this problem by advancing the novel theory that the regulations \nrequire  them  to som ehow  “facilitate acce ss”  to contrac eptive  coverage,  and that it is th is \n“facilitation” that violates  plaintiffs’ religious beliefs. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 5, 9, 13, 16; Pls.’ \nMem at 21-22. But the challenged regulations do  not require the Diocese to do anything, and \nrequire  Catholic  Charities  only  to self-certify that it obj ects  to providing coverage for \ncontraceptive services and that it otherwise meets the criteria for an eligible organization, and to \nshare that self-certification with its TPA. In other words, Catholic Charities is required to inform \nits TPA that it objects to provi ding contraceptive coverage, which it has done or would have to \ndo voluntarily anyway even absent these regulations  in order to ensure that it is not responsible \nfor contracting, arranging, paying, or referring for contraceptive coverage. The sole difference is \nthat it must inform its TPA that its objection is for religious reasons—a statement it has already \nmade repeatedly in this litigation and elsewhere. \nFurthermore,  any burden im posed  by the pu rely  administrative  self-certification \nrequirement—which should take Catholic Charities a matter of minutes—is, at most, de minimis, \nand thus cannot be “substantial” under RFRA. Courts have made clear that the substantial burden \nhurdle is a high one.  Living Water Church of God  v. Charter Twp. of Meridian , 258 F. App’x \n729, 734 (6th Cir. 2007);  see also Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 678 (“A n inconsequential or  de \nminimis burden on religious practice does not rise to  this level [of a substantial burden].”);  \nWashington v. Klem, 497 F.3d 272, 279-81 (3d Cir. 2007);  McEachin v. McGuinnis, 357 F.3d \n197, 203 n.6 (2d Cir. 2004); Civil Liberties for Urban Believers, 342 F.3d at 761. Indeed, if this \nis not a  de minimis burden, it is hard to  see what would be.  In fact, plaintiffs’ alternative \nproposals only confirm that the alleged “burden” of self-certification is de minimis. They contend \n1 5\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 29 of 62 PageID #:  229\nthat, as an alternative to th e accommodations developed by th e Departments, the government \nshould somehow expand or create other public programs so as to provide contraceptive coverage \nto  the women who participate  in  their group health plans.  RFRA plainly does not require \ndefendants to expand or create governm ent programs, particularly where, as here, there is no \nstatutory  authority to do so.  See  infra  Section II.A.2.b. But, in an y  event, plaintiffs’ own \nproposals would entail the same putative “burden” as the existing accommodations, or an even \ngreater burden: One wa y or another, plaintiffs would have to certif y their eligibility for an \naccommodation, and the result would be that the wo men who participate in their plan would get \ncontraceptive coverage through  another source such as Medi caid. The government would of \ncourse, as it does with Medicaid, have to verify employment and/or dependent beneficiary status \nwith the eligible organ ization. The current accommodations are thus likely to req uire less of \nplaintiffs’ involvement than would a governm ent program to separately provide contraceptive \ncoverage for their employees and dependents. \nContrary to plaintiffs’ suggestion, the m ere fact that Catholic Charities claim s that the \nself-certification requirement imposes a substantial burden on its  religious exercise by requiring \nit to “facilitate” access to contraception does not m ake it so. See Conestoga Wood Specialties \nCorp. v. Sebelius, 917 F. Supp. 2d 394, 413 (E.D. Pa. 2013) (“[W ]e reject the notion . . . that a \nplaintiff shows a burden to be substantial simply by claiming that it is.”), aff’d, 724 F.3d 377 (3d \nCir. 2013). Under RFRA, plaintiffs are entitled to their sincere religious beliefs, but they are not \nentitled to decide what does and does not im pose a substantial burden on such beliefs. Although \n“[c]ourts are not arbiters of  scriptural interpretation,”  Thomas, 450 U.S. at 716, “RFRA still \nrequires the court to determine whether the burden a law imposes on a plaintiff’s stated religious \nbelief is ‘substantial,’” Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 413. Plaint iffs would limit the Court’s \ninquiry to two prongs: first, whether plaintiffs’ religious objections to the regulations are sincere, \nand  second, whether the regulations apply signif icant pressure to plaintiffs to comply. But  \nplaintiffs ignore a critical third criterion of the “substantial burden” test, which gives meaning to \nthe term “substantial”: whether the challenged regulations actually  require plaintiffs to modify \n1 6\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 30 of 62 PageID #:  230\ntheir behavior in a significant—or more than  de minimis—way. See Living Water Church of \nGod, 258 F. App’x at 734-36; see also, e.g., Vision Church v. Vill. of Long Grove, 468 F.3d 975, \n997 (7th Cir. 2006) (noting, in  the RLUIPA context, that “t he Supreme Court has found a \n‘substantial burden’ to exist when the governm ent puts ‘substantial pressure on an adherent to \nmodify his behavior and to violate his beliefs’” (quoting  Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals \nComm’n of Fla., 480 U.S. 136, 141 (1987))) (emphasis added); Westchester Day Sch. v. Vill. of \nMamaroneck, 504 F.3d 338, 348-49 (2d Cir. 2007); Church of Scientology of Ga., Inc. v. City of \nSandy Springs, Ga., 843 F. Supp. 2d 1328, 1353-54 (N.D. Ga. 2012). As plaintiffs them selves \nappear to recognize, a “law ‘subs tantially burdens’ an exercise of religion if it compels one “to \nperform acts undeniably at odds with fundamental tenets of [one’s] religious beliefs,” Pls.’ Mem. \nat 23 (quoting  Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 218 (1972)) (em phasis added), “or ‘put[s]  \nsubstantial pressure on an adherent to  modify his behavior and violate his beliefs.’” Id. (quoting \nThomas, 450 U.S. at 717-18) (emphasis added). This test does not require the Court to delve into \nthe theological merits of a belief, b ut instead to examine the operation of the regu lations and \ntheir impact on plaintiffs’ religious practice. See Autocam, 2012 WL 6845677 at *7-8.11 \nUnder plaintiffs’ alternative interpretation of RFRA, courts would play virtually no role \nin determining whether an alleged burden is “s ubstantial”—as long as a  plaintiff’s religious \nbelief is sincere, that would be  the end of the inquiry. Plaintiffs would thus be allowed to evade \nRFRA’s threshold by simply asserting that the burden on their religious exercise is “substantial,” \nthereby paradoxically reading the term “substantial” out of RFRA. See id. at *6 (“The Court does \n                                                           \n11 In Hobby Lobby, a bare majority of the en banc Tenth Circuit concluded that, in determining whether a burden is \nsubstantial, a court’s “only task is to determine whether the claimant's belief is sincere, and if so, whether the \ngovernment has applied substantial pressure on the claimant to violate that belief.” 723 F.3d at 1137. The \ngovernment believes that the majority’s ruling in Hobby Lobby was wrong on this and many other points. However, \neven if this Court were inclined to agree with the Tenth Circuit, the majority proceeded to rely on Abdulhaseeb v. \nCalbone, 600 F.3d 1301 (10th Cir. 2010), which makes clear that in order for a law to impose a substantial burden, it \nmust require some actual change in religious behavior—either forced participation in conduct or forced abstention \nfrom conduct. See Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1138 (citing Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1315). The Hobby Lobby \nsubstantial  burden  analysis  is also   inapposite  because  for-profit co rporations  are no t  eligible  for th e \naccommodations. For similar reasons, the Seventh Circuit’s substantial burden analysis in Korte—which followed \nHobby Lobby—is unpersuasive. See Korte, 735 F.3d at 687. \n \n1 7\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 31 of 62 PageID #:  231\nnot doubt the sincerity of Plaintiff Kennedy’s deci sion to draw the line he does, but the Court  \nstill has a duty to assess whether the claim ed burden—no matter how sincerely felt—really \namounts to a substantial burden on a person’s exer cise of religion.”). “I f every plaintiff were \npermitted to unilaterally determine that a law burdened their religious beliefs, and courts were \nrequired to assume that such burden was substantial, simply because the plaintiff claimed that it \nwas the case, then the standard expressed by Congress under the RFRA would convert to an ‘any \nburden’ standard.” Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 413-14; see also Autocam, 2012 WL 6845677, \nat *7; Mersino Mgmt. Co. v. Sebelius, No. 13-CV-11296, 2013 WL 3546702, at *16 (E.D. Mich. \nJuly 11, 2013).12 The result would be to subject every ac t of Congress to strict scrutiny every \ntime a plaintiff could articulate a sincerely held religious objection to compliance with that law. \nFinally, plaintiffs seem to suggest that the re gulations will actually require them to fund \nor subsidize access to contraceptive coverage because their issuers will find a way to pass on the \ncosts of such coverage to plaintiffs.  See, e.g., Pls.’ Mem. at 20. But the regulations specifically \nprohibit  plaintiffs’ TPA from   charging any pr emium  or otherwise pa ssing  on any costs to \nplaintiffs with respect to the issuers’ payments for contraceptive services. See 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39,880, AR at 12; see also Notre Dame, slip op. at 23-24. Any suggestion that plaintiffs’ TPA(s) \nwill violate the law is purely spe culative, and boils down to the baseless a rgument that the \nregulations  impose  a s ubstantial  burden beca use  a third party m ight  violate those sam e \nregulations. This contention has no merit. \nIn  sum,  the regulations do not impose a su bstantial  burden on plaintiffs’ religious \nexercise, and thus Count I should be dismissed or summary judgment granted to defendants. \n \n \n                                                           \n12 RFRA’s legislative history makes clear that Congress did not intend such a relaxed standard. The initial version of \nRFRA prohibited the government from imposing any “burden” on free exercise, substantial or otherwise. Congress \namended the bill to add the word “substantially,” “to make it clear that the compelling interest standards set forth in \nthe act” apply “only to Government actions [that] place a substantial burden on the exercise of” religious liberty. 139 \nCong. Rec. S14350-01, S14352 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1993) (statement of Sen. Kennedy); see also id. (text of \nAmendment No. 1082). \n1 8\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 32 of 62 PageID #:  232\nb.  Even if the regulations were found to impose some more than de \nminimis burden on plaintiffs’ exercise of religion, any such burden \nwould be far too attenuated to be “substantial” under RFRA \nAlthough the regulations do not require plainti ffs to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for \ncontraceptive coverage, plaintiffs’ complaint appears to be that the regulations require plaintiffs \nto indirectly facilitate conduct on the part of their employees that they find objectionable (i.e., the \nuse of certain contraceptives). But this complaint has no limits. An employer provides numerous \nbenefits, including a salary and ot her fringe benefits, to its em ployees and by doing so in som e \nsense facilitates whatever use its employees make of those benefits. Plaintiffs not only seek to be \nfree  from  the  requirement  to contract, arrange ,  pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage \nthemselves—which they are under these regulations—but also seek to prevent anyone else from  \nproviding such coverage to their employees. But an employer has no right to control the choices \nof its employees, who may not share its religious beliefs, and who have a legitimate interest in \naccess to the preventive services coverage made available under the challenged regulations. \nIndeed,  courts  have  held that claim s  raised b y  for-profit com panies  challenging  the \ncontraceptive coverage regulations, which—unlike here—actually require employers to contract, \narrange, pay, or refer for the relevant coverage  themselves, are too attenuated to am ount to a \nsubstantial burden under RFRA. See, e.g., Autocam, 2012 WL 6845677, at *6-7. Any burden on \nplaintiffs, which are eligible for the religious employer exemption or the accommodations, is a \nfortiori too attenuated to be substantial. For example, the district court in Conestoga reasoned \nthat the ultimate decision of whether to use contraception “rests not with [the employer], but with \n[the] employees” and that “any burden im posed by the regulations is too attenuated to be \nconsidered substantial.” 917 F. Supp. 2d at 414-15. The  Conestoga court further explained that \nthe indirect nature of any burden imposed by the regulations distinguished them from the statutes \nchallenged in Yoder, Sherbert, Thomas, and Gonzales. See Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 415; \nsee also, e.g., Autocam, 2012 WL 6845677, at *6; O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1158-60.13 \nAs these courts concluded, the preventive services coverage regulations result in only an \n                                                           \n13 See also Korte, 735 F.3d at 705-15 (Rovner, J., dissenting); Eden Foods, 2013 WL 1190001; Annex Medical, Inc. \nv.

Not only are plaintiffs separated from the use of contraception by “[a] \nseries of events” that must occur before the u se of contraceptive services to which plaintiffs \nobject would “come into play,” Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 414-15, but they are also further  \ninsulated  by  the f act  that a th ird  party—plaintiffs’  TPA—and  not  plaintiffs,  will a ctually \ncontract, arrange, pay, and refer for such services, and thus plaintiffs are in no way subsidizing—\neven indirectly—the use of prev entive services that they find objectionable. Under plaintiffs’ \ntheory, their religious exercise  is substantially burdened when one of their employees and her \nhealth care provider m ake an independent determination that the use of certain contraceptive \nservices is appropriate, and such services are paid for exclusively by plaintiffs’ issuers, with none \nof the cost being passed on to plaintiffs, and  no administration of the paym ents by plaintiffs, \nsolely  because  plaintiffs self-certified that  they  have religious ob jections  to providing \ncontraceptive coverage and so informed their issuers. \nBut a burden cannot be “substantial”  under RFRA when it is attenuated.  See Autocam, \n2012 WL 6845677, at *6-7. Cases that  find a substantial burden unifor mly involve a direct \nburden on the plaintiff rather than a burden imposed on another entity. See, e.g., Potter v. Dist. of \nColumbia, 558 F.3d 542, 546 (D.C. Cir. 2009); see also Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 413-14. A \nplaintiff cannot establish a substantial burden on his religious exercise by invoking this type of  \ntrickle-down theory; to constitute a substantial burden under RFRA, the burden must be imposed \non the plaintiff him self. See Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 411, 413;  Autocam, 2012 WL \n6845677, at *7.14 Here, of course, there is no such direct burden. In fact, given that any payment \n                                                           \n14 Thomas is not to the contrary. In Thomas, the Supreme Court recognized that “a compulsion may certainly be \nindirect and still constitute a substantial burden, such as the denial of a benefit found in Thomas.” Conestoga, 917 F. \nSupp. 2d at 415 n.15. But that is not so where the burden itself is indirect, as it is h ere. See id.. As previously \nexplained, see supra note 9, in Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d 1114, a bare majority of the en banc Tenth Circuit concluded \nthat the word “substantial” in RFRA refers to the “intensity of coercion” rather than to the directness or indirectness \nof the burden, if any, on a plaintiff’s religious exercise. Id. at 1137-40. The Tenth Circuit’s conclusion that the \nsubstantial burden requirement relates to the intensity of the coercion, however, is inconsistent with Kaemmerling, \ndiscussed above, as well as other decisions that have analyzed “substantial burden” in terms of the degree to which \nthe challenged law directly imposes a requirement or prohibition on religious practice. See 553 F.3d at 678-79; \n2 0\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 34 of 62 PageID #:  234\nfor contraceptive services is made by plaintiffs’ issuers, the regulations have even less impact on \nplaintiffs’ religious exercise than plaintiffs’ payment of salaries to their employees, which those \nemployees can use to purchase contraceptives. See O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1160; Conestoga, \n917 F. Supp. 2d at 414;  Korte, 735 F.3d at 715-16 (Rovner, J., dissenting);  Autocam, 2012 WL \n6845677, at *6. \nPlaintiffs  remain  free t o  refuse t o  contract,  arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive \ncoverage; to voice their disapproval of contra ception; and to encourage their employees t o \nrefrain from using con traceptive services. The regulations therefor e affect plaintiffs’ religious \npractice, if at all, in a most attenuated way. In short, because the prev entive services coverage \nregulations “are several degrees  removed from imposing a substantial burden on [plaintiffs],”  \nO’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1160, the Court should dism iss plaintiffs’ RFRA claim, or grant \nsummary judgment to defendants, even if it finds—contrary to the government’s argument—that \nthe challenged regulations impose some burden on plaintiffs’ religious exercise.  \n \n2.  Even if there w ere a substantial burden on religious  exercise, the \nregulations serve compelling governmental interests and are the least \nrestrictive means to achieve those interests \n \na.  The  regulations significantly  advance  compelling govern mental \ninterests in public health and gender equality \nEven  if  plaintiffs  were able to de monstrate  a substantial burden on their religious \nexercise,  they  would not prevail because th e  challenged  regulations  are justified by two \ncompelling interests, and are the le ast restrictive means to achieve th ose interests. First, the \npromotion of public health is  unquestionably a compelling interest. Mead v. Holder, 766 F. \nSupp. 2d 16, 43 (D.D.C. 2011); see also, e.g., Buchwald v. Univ. of N.M. Sch. of Med., 159 F.3d \n487, 498 (10th Cir. 1998); Dickerson v. Stuart, 877 F. Supp. 1556, 1559 (M.D. Fla. 1995). And \nthe  challenged regulations further this com pelling  interest by “expanding access to and \nutilization of recommended preventive services for women.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887, AR at 19. \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nLiving Water Church of God, 258 Fed.

And, again, the substantial burden analysis in Hobby Lobby and Korte are inapplicable to \nthis case. See supra notes 8 & 11. \n2 1\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 35 of 62 PageID #:  235\nThe primary predicted benefit of the preventi ve services coverage  regulations is that \n“individuals will experience improved health as a result of reduced transmission, prevention or \ndelayed onset, and earlier treatment of disease.” 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726, 41,733 (July 19, 2010), AR \nat 233; see also 77 Fed. Reg. at 8728, AR at 215; 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872, 39,887, AR at 4, 19.  \n“By expanding coverage and eliminating cost sharing for recommended preventive services, [the \nregulations are] expected to increas e access to and utilization of these services, which are no t \nused at optimal levels today.” 75 Fed. Reg. at 41,733, AR at 233; see also 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,873 \n(“Research [ ] shows that cost  sharing can be a significan t barrier to access to con traception.” \n(citation omitted)), AR at 5. \nIncreased access to FDA-approved contraceptive services is a key part of these predicted \nhealth outcomes, as unintended pregnancies have proven in many cases to have negative health \nconsequences for women and developing fetuses. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872, AR at 4. As IOM \nconcluded in identifying services recomm ended to “prevent conditions harm ful to women’s \nhealth and well-being,” unintende d pregnancy may delay “entry in to prenatal care,” prolong \n“behaviors that present risks for the developing  fetus,” and cause “depression, anxiety, or other \nconditions.” IOM REP. at 20, 103-04, AR at 318, 401-02. Contraceptive coverage further helps to \navoid “the increased risk of  adverse pregnancy outcomes for pregnancies that are too clo sely \nspaced.” Id. at 103, AR at 401; see also 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872 (“Short interpregnancy intervals \nin particular have been associated with low  birth weight, prematurity, and small-for-gestational \nage births.”) (citing studies), AR at 4. And “[ c]ontraceptives also have medical benefits for \nwomen who are contraindicated for pregnancy,  and there are demonstrated preventive health \nbenefits from contraceptives relating to conditions other than pregnancy (for example, prevention \nof certain cancers, menstrual disorders, and acne).” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872, AR at 4;  see also \nIOM REP. at 103-04 (“[ P]regnancy may be contraindicated for women with serious m edical \nconditions such as pulmonary hypertension . . . and cyanotic hear t disease, and for women with \nthe Marfan Syndrome.”), AR at 401-02. \n2 2\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 36 of 62 PageID #:  236\nClosely tied to this interest is a related, but separate, compelling interest that is furthered \nby the regulations: assuring that  women have equal access to hea lth care services. 78 Fed. Reg. \nat 39,872, 39,887, AR at 4, 19. As the Supreme Court explained in Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 \nU.S. 609 (1984), there is a fundam ental “importance, both to the  individual and to society, of \nremoving the barriers to econom ic advancement and political and social integration that have \nhistorically  plagued certain disa dvantaged  groups, including wom en.”  Id.  at  626. Thus, \n“[a]ssuring  women  equal access to   . . . goods, privileges, and  advantages  clearly furthers  \ncompelling state interests.” Id. By including in the ACA preventive health services for women, \nCongress made clear that the goals and benefits of effective preventive health care apply equally \nto women, who might otherwise be excluded from such benefits if their unique health care needs \nwere not taken into account in the ACA. As  explained by members of Congress, “women have \ndifferent health needs than m en, and these needs often generate additi onal costs. Women of \nchildbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men.” 155 Cong. \nRec. S12106-02, S12114 (daily ed. Dec. 2, 2009) (s tatement of Sen. Mikulski); 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39,887, AR at 19; IOM R EP. at 19, AR at 317. These costs resu lt in women often forgoing \npreventive care and place wom en in the workforce at a disadvantag e compared to their m ale \ncoworkers. See, e.g., 155 Cong. Rec. S12265-02, S12274 (daily ed. Dec. 3, 2009); 78 Fed. Reg. \nat 39,887, AR at 19; IOM REP. at 20, AR at 318. Congress’s attempt to equalize the provision of \npreventive health care services, with the resulting benefit of women being able to contribute to \nthe same degree as m en as healthy and productive  members of society, furthers a compelling \ngovernmental interest. Cf. Catholic Charities of Sacramento, Inc. v. Superior Court, 85 P.3d 67, \n92-93 (Cal. 2004).15 \n                                                           \n15 In arguing that the government’s interests are not compelling, plaintiffs suggest the government must separately \nanalyze the impact of and ne ed for the regulations as to each and every employer and employee in America. See \nPls.’ Mem. at 27. But this level of specificity would be impossible to establish and would render this regulatory \nscheme—and potentially every regulatory scheme challenged due to religious objections—completely unworkable. \nSee United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 259-60 (1982). In practice, courts have not required the government to \nanalyze the impact of a regulation on the single entity seeking an exemption, but have conducted the inquiry with \nrespect to all similarly situated individuals or organizations. See, e.g., id. at 260 (considering the impact on the tax \nsystem if all religious adherents—not just the plaintiff—could opt out); United States v. Oliver, 255 F.3d 588, 589 \n(8th Cir. 2001) (per curiam) (“Oliver has argued a one-man exemption should be made, however, there is nothing so \n2 3\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 37 of 62 PageID #:  237\nAlthough the challenged regulations further these two compelling governmental interests, \nwhile simultaneously accommodating the religious objections of eligible organizations, plaintiffs \nmaintain that the inte rests underlying the regulations cannot be considered com pelling when \nmillions of people are not protected by the regulations at the moment.

Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. \nCity of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546-47 (1993). For the most part, the “exemptions” referred to by \nplaintiffs are not exemptions from the preventive  services coverage regul ations at all, but are \ninstead provisions of the ACA that exclude  individuals and entities  from other requirements \nimposed by the ACA. Or they reflect th e government’s attempts to balance the  compelling \ninterests underlying the challenged regulations against other si gnificant interests supporting the \ncomplex administrative scheme created by the ACA.  See Lee, 455 U.S. at 259 (“The Court has \nlong recognized that balance m ust be struck be tween the values of th e comprehensive social \nsecurity system, which rests on a complex of actuarial factors, and the consequences of allowing \nreligiously based exemptions.”); Winddancer, 435 F. Supp. 2d at 695-98  (recognizing that the \nregulations  governing access to  eagle  parts “strik e  a delicat e  balance” between   competing \ninterests). And, unlike the exemption plaintiffs seek for employers that object to the regulations \non religious grounds, the existing exceptions do  not undermine the government’s interests in a \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \npeculiar or special with Oliver’s situation which warrants an exception. There are no safeguards to prevent similarly \nsituated individuals from asserting the same privilege and leading to uncontrolled eagle harvesting.”); Dole v. \nShenandoah Baptist Church, 899 F.2d 1389, 1398 (4th Cir. 1990) (“There is no principled way of exempting the \nschool without exempting all other sectarian schools and thereby the thousands of lay teachers and staff members on \ntheir payrolls.”); see also, e.g., Graham v. Comm’r, 822 F.2d 844, 853 (9th Cir. 1987), overruled in part on other \ngrounds by Navajo Nation v.

O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao Do \nVegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 435 (2006), is not to the contrary. To be sure, the Court rejected “slippery-slope” arguments \nfor refusing to accomm odate a particular claim ant. See 546 U.S. at 435-36. But it construed the scope of the \nrequested exemption as encompassing all members of the plaintiff religious sect. See id. at 433. Similarly, the \nexemption in Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, encompassed all Amish children; and the exemption in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 \nU.S. 398 (1963), encompassed all individuals who had a religious objection to working on Saturdays. See O Centro, \n546 U.S. at 431. The Court’s warning in O Centro against “slippery-slope” arguments was a rejection of arguments \nby analogy—that is, speculation that providing an exemption to one group will lead to exemptions for other non-\nsimilarly situated groups. It was not an invitation to ignore the reality that an exemption for a particular claimant \nmight necessarily lead to an exemption for an entire category of similarly situated entities. \n2 4\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 38 of 62 PageID #:  238\nsignificant way. See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 547;  S. Ridge Baptist Church v. Indus. Comm’n of \nOhio, 911 F.2d 1203, 1208-09 (6th Cir. 1990); see also 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887, AR at 19. \nFor example, the grandfathering of certain  health plans with respec t to certain ACA \nprovisions is not limited to the preventive services coverage regulations. See 42 U.S.C. § 18011; \n45 C.F.R. § 147.140. In fact, the effect of grandfathering is not really a permanent “exemption,” \nbut rather, over the long term, a transition in the marketplace with respect to several provisions \nof the ACA, including the preven tive services coverage provision.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887 \nn.49, AR at 19. The grandfathering provision reflects Congress’s attempts to balance competing \ninterests—specifically,  the inte rest  in spread ing  the benefits of the ACA, including those \nprovided by the preventive services coverage provision, and the inte rest in maintaining existing \ncoverage and easing the transition into the ne w regulatory regime established by the ACA—i n \nthe context of a complex statutory scheme. See 75 Fed. Reg. 34,538, 34,546 (June 17, 2010). \nThis incremental transition does not call into question the compelling interests furthered \nby the preventive services coverage regulations.  Even under the grandfathering provision, it is \nprojected that more group health plans will transition to the requirements under the regulations \nover time. Defendants have estimated that a majority of group heal th plans will have lost their \ngrandfather status by the end of 2013. See id. at 34,552; see also Kaiser Family Foundation and \nHealth Research & Educational Trust, Em ployer Health Benefits 2012 A nnual Survey at 7-8, \n190,  AR at 663-64, 846. Thus, any purported adve rse  effect on the com pelling  interests \nunderlying the regulations will be quickly mitigated, which is in stark contrast to the permanent \nexemption plaintiffs seek. Plaintiffs would have this Court believe that an interest cannot truly be \n“compelling” unless Congress is willing to im pose it on everyone all at once despite com peting \ninterests, but plaintiffs offer no support for that untenable proposition.16 \n                                                           \n16 Plaintiffs also allude to a “small-employer exemption[].” Pls.’ Mem. at 27-28. But 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(c)(2) does \nnot, as plaintiffs suggest, exempt small employers from the challenged regulations. Small businesses that elect to \noffer non-grandfathered health coverage to their employees are required to provide coverage for recommended \npreventive health services without cost sharing. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13. And, small employers have business \nincentives to offer health coverage to their employees; an otherwise eligible small employer would lose eligibility \nfor certain tax benefits if it did not do so. See 26 U.S.C. § 45R. \n2 5\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 39 of 62 PageID #:  239\nThe  only true exem ption  from  the preventive   services coverage regulations is the  \nexemption for the group health plans of religious employers. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). But there is \na rational distinction between this narrow exception and the expansion plaintiffs seek. Houses of \nworship  and their in tegrated  auxiliaries  that  object  to contraceptive  coverage  on religious \ngrounds  are m ore  likely than other em ployers,  including organizations eligible for the \naccommodations, to employ people of the sa me faith who share the sam e objection, and who \nwould therefore be less likely to use contracep tive services even if such services were covered  \nunder their plan.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874, 39,887, AR at 6,  19. In any event,  it would be \nperverse to hold that the governm ent’s provision of a limited religious exemption eliminates its \ncompelling interest in the regulation, thus eff ectively extending the same exemption to anyone \nelse who wants it under RFRA. Such a reading of RFRA would discourage the government from \naccommodating religion, the opposite of what Congress intended in enacting RFRA. \nGranting  plaintiffs the m uch  broader  exemption  they request w ould  undermine \ndefendants’ ability to enforce the regulations in a  rational manner. See O Centro, 546 U.S. at \n435. We are a “cosmopolitan nation made up of people of alm ost every conceivable religious \npreference,” Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 606 (1961);  see also S. Ridge Baptist Church , \n911 F.2d at 1211, and many people object to various medical services. If any organization with a \nreligious objection were able to claim an exemption from the operation of the preventive services \ncoverage regulations—even where the regulations require virtually nothing of the organization—\nit is difficult to see how defendants could administer the regulations in a m anner that would \nachieve  Congress’s goals of i mproving  the h ealth  of wom en  and  newborn  children and \nequalizing the coverage of preventive services for wom en. See United States v. Israel, 317 F.3d \n768, 772 (7th Cir. 2003) (recognizing that granti ng plaintiff’s RFRA claim  “would lead to \nsignificant administrative problems for the [government] and open the door to a . . . proliferation \nof claims”). Indeed, women who receive their health coverage through employers like plaintiffs \nwould face negative health and other outcomes because they had obtained employment with an \norganization  that objects to its em ployees’  use  of contraceptiv e  services,  even  when those  \n2 6\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 40 of 62 PageID #:  240\nservices are paid for and adm inistered by a third party.  See id. (noting consequences “for the \npublic and the government”); 77 Fed. Reg. at 8728, AR at 215; 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887, AR at 19. \n \nb.  The regulations are the least restrictive means of advancing the \ngovernment’s compelling interests \nWhen determining whether a particular regulato ry scheme is the “least res trictive,” the \nappropriate inquiry is whether the individual or organization with religious objections, and those \nsimilarly situated, can be exempted from the scheme—or whether the scheme can otherwise be \nmodified—without undermining the government’s compelling interests. See, e.g., United States \nv. Schmucker, 815 F.2d 413, 417 (6th Cir. 1987);  United States v. Wilgus, 638 F.3d 1274, 1289-\n95 (10th Cir. 2011). The governm ent is not requi red “to do the im possible—refute each and \nevery  conceivable alternative reg ulation  scheme.”  Wilgus,  638 F.3d at 1289. Instead, the \ngovernment need only “refute the alternative schemes offered by the challenger.” Id. \nInstead of explaining how plaintiffs and similarly situated eligible organizations could be \nexempted  from  the regulations without significant dam age  to the governm ent’s  compelling \ninterests, plaintiffs conjure up,  without any statutory support,  several brand new statutory and \nregulatory schemes—most of which would requi re the government to pay for contraceptive \ncoverage—that they claim would be less restrictive.  See Pls.’ Mem. at 33. Yet plaintiffs fail to \nrecognize that such alternatives would be incom patible with the fundamental statutory scheme \nset forth in the ACA, which plaintiffs do not challenge in this lawsuit. Congress did not adopt a \nsingle (government) payer system financed through taxes and instead opted to build on the \nexisting system of employment-based coverage. See H.R. Rep. No. 111-443, pt. II, at 984-86 \n(2010).  Plaintiffs point to no statutory authority   for any of their proffered less restrictive \nalternatives. Nor is there any  indication that Congress would ha ve contemplated that agency \naction  could be inv alidated  under  RFRA because th e  agency  in  discharging  its  statutorily \ndelegated authority failed to adopt an alternative scheme absent any statutory authority for doing \nso. Thus, even if defendants wanted to adopt on e of plaintiffs’ non-employer-based alternatives, \nthey would be constrained by the statute from doing so. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20. \n2 7\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 41 of 62 PageID #:  241\nFurthermore,  plaintiffs them selves  indicate  that they would “oppose m any  of”  the \nalternatives that they put forth. Pls.’ Mem. at 33. Indeed, as noted above, it is not clear why the \ngovernment’s  provision  of contraceptive cove rage  to wom en  based upon their em ployer’s \nobjection to providing it would not  be subject to exactly the same RFRA claim that plaintiffs \nadvance here. By their own admission then, plaintiffs’ proposals would do little—if anything—to \nsatisfy their religious objections , and therefore should not be cons idered viable less restrictive \nalternatives. See New Life Baptist Church Acad. v. Town of E. Longmeadow , 885 F.2d 940, 950-\n51 (1st Cir. 1989) (Breyer, J.) (considering the  limited extent to which an alternative would \nalleviate a religious burden in rejecting it as  a “less restrictive alte rnative,” even though the \nplaintiff had expressed a preference for the a lternative over the challen ged requirements). An \neligible organization’s religious objection to contraceptive coverage would still “facilitate” the \navailability of such coverage—in this case,  by the government—and the eligible organization \nwould likely be called upon to verify or certify  matters such as the  religious objection to \ncontraceptive coverage, and employment or plan beneficiary status. Plaintiffs cannot plausibly \ncontend that the regulations ar e not the least restrictive means while simultaneously asserting \nthat they would oppose their own suggested alternatives. \nFinally, even if plaintiffs w ould be satisfied by  their proposed alternative schemes, just \nbecause plaintiffs can devise an en tirely new legislative and administrative scheme does not \nmake that scheme a feasible less restrictive means,  see Wilgus, 638 F.3d at 1289;  Adams v. \nComm’r of Internal Revenue , 170 F.3d 173, 180 n.8 (3d Cir. 1999) , particularly where such \nalternatives would come at enormous administrative and financial cost to the governm ent. A \nproposed alternative scheme is not an adequate alternative—and thus not a viable less restrictive \nmeans to achieve a compelling interest—if it is not feasible. See, e.g., New Life Baptist, 885 F.2d \nat 947; Graham, 822 F.2d at 852. In determ ining whether a proposed alternative schem e is \nfeasible, courts often consider the additional administrative and fiscal costs of the scheme. See, \ne.g., S. Ridge Baptist Church, 911 F.2d at 1206; Fegans v. Norris, 537 F.3d 897, 905-06 (8th Cir. \n2008); United States v. Lafley, 656 F.3d 936, 942 (9th Cir. 2011);  New Life Baptist, 885 F.2d at \n2 8\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 42 of 62 PageID #:  242\n947. Defendants considered pl aintiffs’ alternatives and determined that they were not feasible \nbecause  the agencies lacked statu tory  authority  to im plement  them;  they would i mpose \nconsiderable new costs and other burdens on  the government; and they would otherwise be \nimpractical. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20; see also, e.g., Lafley, 656 F.3d at 942; Gooden \nv. Crain, 353 F. App’x 885, 888 (5th Cir. 2009); Adams, 170 F.3d at 180 n.8. \nNor would the proposed alternatives be equa lly effective in advancing the government’s \ncompelling interests. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20;  see also, e.g., Kaemmerling, 553 \nF.3d at 684 (finding that m eans was least restrictive where no a lternative means would achieve \ncompelling interests); Murphy v. State of Ark., 852 F.2d 1039, 1042-43 (8th Cir. 1988) (sam e). \nAs discussed above, Congress determ ined that the best way to achieve the goals of the ACA, \nincluding expanding preventive services coverage, was to build on the existing em ployer-based \nsystem. The anticipated benefits of the preventive services coverage regulations are attributable \nnot only to the fact that recommended contraceptive services will be available to women with no \ncost-sharing,  but also to the fact that these  services  will be available through the existing \nemployer-based system of health co verage through which women will face m inimal logistical \nand  administrative  obstacles  to receiving cov erage  of their care. Plaintiffs’ alternatives, b y \ncontrast,  have none of   these advantages. They   would require estab lishing  entirely new \ngovernment programs and infrastructures or f undamentally altering existing ones, and would \nalmost certainly require women to take burdensome steps to find out about the availability of and \nsign up for a new benefit, thereby ensuring that fewer women would take advantage of it. See 78 \nFed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20. Nor do plaintiffs of fer any suggestion as to how these programs \ncould be integrated with the  employer-based system or how women would obtain government-\nprovided  preventive  services in p ractice.  Thus,  plaintiffs’  proposals—in  addition  to rais ing \nmyriad administrative and logistical difficulties and being unauthorized by any statute and not \nfunded by any appropriation—are less likely to achieve the compelling interests furthered by the \nregulations, and therefore do not represent reasonable less restrictive means. Id. \n2 9\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 43 of 62 PageID #:  243\nBecause plaintiffs have failed to offer viable less restrictive alternatives, the Court should \nreject plaintiffs’ argument that the regulations fail strict scrutiny.17 \nB.  The Regulations Do Not Violate the Free Exercise Clause \n  A law that is neutral and ge nerally applicable does not run afoul of the Free Exercis e \nClause even if it prescribes conduct that an indi vidual’s religion proscribes or has the incidental \neffect of burdening a particular religious practice. Emp’t Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 879 (1990). \n“Neutrality and general applicability are interrelated.” Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 531. A law is neutral \nif it does not target religiously m otivated conduct either on its face or as applied.  Id. at 533. A \nneutral law has as its purpose something other than the disapproval of a particular religion, or of \nreligion in general. Id. at 545. A law is generall y applicable so long as  it does not selectively \nimpose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief. Id.  \n  Unlike such selective laws, the preventive se rvices coverage regulations are neutral and \ngenerally applicable. Indeed, nearly every court to have consid ered a free exercise challenge to \nthe prior version of the regulations has rejected it, concluding that the regulations are neutral and \ngenerally applicable.18 See, e.g., Notre Dame, slip op. at 25-31; Priests for Life, slip op. at 30-35; \nArchbishop  of Washington ,  slip op. at 51-60,   Autocam,  2012 WL 6845677, at *5. “The  \nregulations were passed, not with the object of interfering with religious practices, but instead to \nimprove women’s access to health care and les sen the disparity between men’s and women’s \n                                                           \n17 Plaintiffs cite extra-record evidence in support of many of their arguments. For example, they cite a law review \narticle for the proposition that the challenged regulations “are unlikely to significantly impact contraceptive use.” \nSee Pls.’ Mem. at 30. The introduction of this and other extra-record evidence is inappropriate and should not be \nconsidered by the Court. Plaintiffs are challenging agency regulations, and thus this Court’s review is limited to the \nadministrative record. See, e.g., United States v. Carlo Bianchi & Co., 373 U.S. 709, 715 (1963). \n18 See MK Chambers Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 13-11379, 2013 WL 1340719, at *5 (E.D. \nMich. Apr. 3, 2013); Eden Foods, Inc. v.

Supp. 2d at 1161; see also Notre Dame, slip op. at 29-30 (“It \nis [ ] abundantly clear that the women’s health requirements in the ACA are entirely neutral and \nnot intended to target religion.”). The regulations reflect expert medical recommendations about \nthe medical necessity of contraceptive services, without regard to any religious m otivations for \nor against such services. See, e.g., Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 410 (“It is clear from  the \nhistory of the regulations and the report published by the Institute of Medicine that the purpose \nof the [regulations] is not to  target religion, but instead to  promote public health and gender \nequality.”). \n  The regulations, moreover, do not pursue their purpose “only against conduct motivated \nby religious belief.” Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 545; see United States v. Amer, 110 F.3d 873, 879 (2d \nCir. 1997) (concluding law that “punishe[d] conduc t within its reach without regard to whether \nthe conduct was religiously m otivated” was generally applicable). The regulations apply to all \nnon-grandfathered health plans that do not qualif y for the religious employer exem ption or the \naccommodations for eligible organizations. Thus, “it is just not true . . .  that the burdens of the \n[regulations] fall on religious orga nizations ‘but almost no others.’” Am. Family Ass’n v. FCC, \n365 F.3d 1156, 1171 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 536). \nThe  existence  of express exceptions or   accommodations  for objectively defined \ncategories of entities, like grandfathered plans, religious employers, and eligible organizations, \n“does not mean that the la w does not apply generally.”  Notre Dame, slip op. at 30. “General \napplicability does not mean absolute universality.” Olsen v. Mukasey, 541 F.3d 827, 832 (8th \nCir. 2008); accord Axson-Flynn v. Johnson, 356 F.3d 1277, 1298 (10th Cir. 2004);  Am. Friends \nServ. Comm. Corp. v.

Supp. 2d at 1162. The exception \nfor grandfathered plans is available on equal terms to all employers, whether religious or secular. \nAnd  the religious em ployer  exemption  and elig ible  organization accommodations serve to \naccommodate religion, not to disfavor it. Id.; see also Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 410. Thus, \nthese categorical exceptions and accommodations do not trigger strict scrutiny. \nCarving  out an exem ption  for defined reli gious  entities also does not m ake  a law \nnonneutral as to others. Indeed, the religious employer exemption “presents a strong argument in \nfavor of neutrality” by “demonstrating that the  object of the law was not to infringe upon or \nrestrict practices because of their relig ious motivation.” O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1161 \n(quotations omitted); see Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 410 (“The f act that exemptions were \nmade for religious em ployers . . . . shows that  the government made efforts to a ccommodate \nreligious beliefs, which counsels in favor of the regulations’ neutrality.”). The regulations are not \nunlawful merely because the religious em ployer exemption does not extend as far as Plaintiffs \nwish. \nPlaintiffs’ reliance on Lukumi, 508 U.S. 520, is of no help, as  this case is a far cry from \nLukumi, where the legislature specifically targeted the religious exercise of members of a single \nchurch (Santeria) by enacting ordinances that used terms such as “sacrifice” and “ritual,” id. at \n533-34, and prohibited few, if any, animal killings other than Santeria sacrifices, id. at 535-36. \nHere, there is no indica tion that the regulations are anything other than an effort to increase \nwomen’s access to and utilization of recommended preventive services. See Notre Dame, slip op. \nat 27-28; Priests for Life, slip op. at 52-55; O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1161; Conestoga, 917 F. \nSupp. 2d at 410. Plaintiffs’ unsupported assertion th at the regulations are  “part of a conscious \npolitical strategy to marginalize and delegitimize Plaintiffs’ religious views by holding them  up \nfor ridicule on the national stage,” Pls.’ Mem . at 34, is mere rhetorical bluster. And it cannot be \ndisputed that defendants have made extensive efforts—through the religious employer exemption \nand the eligible organization accommodations—to accommodate religion in ways that will not \n3 2\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 46 of 62 PageID #:  246\nundermine  the goal of ensuring that wom en  have  access to coverage for recomm ended \npreventive services without cost sharing.19 \nPlaintiffs also posit that the regulations m ust have been designed to target plaintiffs’ \nreligious  practice of refusing to facilitate ac cess  to co ntraception  because, prior to th e \npromulgation of the regulations,  “85% of health plans already  cover[ed] contraception.” Pls.’ \nMem. at 35. As an initial matter, this 85 percent figure represents only large employers, not small \nemployers (only 62 percent of which covered cont raception prior to issuance of the regulations) \nor plans on the individual market. IOM REP. at 109, AR at 407. More importantly, many of the \nplans that covered contraceptive services imposed cost-sharing requirements that often resulted \nin women forgoing preventive care.  Id. at 19-20, 109. The regulations elim inate that cost-\nsharing. Finally, even if plaintiffs could show that the regulations have a disproportionate effect \non them (and they have not), it would not destroy the regulations’ neutrality. See O’Brien, 894 F. \nSupp. 2d at 1161 (rejecting identical argum ent). “[A] neutral and perf ectly constitutional law \nmay have a disproportionate impact upon religiously inspired behavior . . . . The  Free Exercise \nClause is not violated even though a group motivated by religious reasons may be more likely to \nengage in the proscribed conduct.” Id. (citing cases). Indeed, by plaintiffs’ logic, the government \nalso was “target[ing],” Pls.’ Me m. at 34, those with religious obj ections to vaccinations, as a \nsimilar or even greater percentage of health plans covered vaccinations prior to promulgation of \nthe challenged regulations. See 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726, 41,732 (July 19, 2010), AR at 232. \nFinally, plaintiffs maintain that the challenged regulations are subject to strict scrutiny \nunder a “hybrid rights” theory because they also infringe on plaintiffs’ freedom of speech and \nassociation.  The Suprem e  Court, however, ha s  never invoked this so -called  “hybrid rights \ntheory” to justify applying strict  scrutiny to a free exercise claim . See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 567 \n                                                           \n19 Fraternal Order of Police v. City of Newark, 170 F.3d 359 (3d Cir. 1999), an out-of-circuit case on which \nplaintiffs also rely (Pls.’ Mem. at 34), addressed a policy that created a secular exemption but refused all religious \nexemptions. The preventive services coverage regulations, in contrast, contain an exemption and accommodations \nthat specifically seek to accommodate religion. Thus, unlike in Fraternal Order, there is simply no basis here to \ninfer a discriminatory object behind the regulations. See Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 409-10. \n \n3 3\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 47 of 62 PageID #:  247\n(Souter,  J., concurring in part and concurring   in the judgm ent)  (noting  the hybrid rights \nexception would either swallow the Smith rule or be entirely unnecessa ry). And several circuits \nhave specifically rejected the theory. See Knight v. Conn. D ep’t of Pub. Health, 275 F.3d 156, \n167 (2d Cir. 2001); Kissinger v. Bd. of Trs. of Ohio State Univ., 5 F.3d 177, 180 (6th Cir. 1993). \nNevertheless, assuming arguendo that the hybrid rights theory is valid, it applies only where the \nplaintiff’s non-free-exercise claims are “independently viable.”  Mahoney v. Dist. of Columbia , \n662 F. Supp. 2d 74, 95 n.12 (D.D.C. 2009). Here, plaint iffs assert that the preventive services \ncoverage provision violates both the right to free  exercise of religion and their rights to free  \nspeech and free association. Yet, p laintiffs do not even raise a separate free association claim \nand, as explained below, their free speech claims  are meritless. “‘[A] plaintiff does not allege a \nhybrid rights claim entitled to strict scrutiny analysis merely by combining a free exercise claim \nwith an utterly m eritless claim of the violation of anothe r alleged fundamental right.’” Civil \nLiberties for Urban Believers, 342 F.3d at 765 (quoting Miller v. Reed, 176 F.3d 1202, 1207-08 \n(9th Cir. 1999)); see also Henderson, 253 F.3d at 19 (“[ T]he combination of two untenable  \nclaims” does not “equal[] a tenable one.”). Thus, ev en if the hybrid rights  theory were valid, it \nwould not trigger strict scrutiny in this case.  See Notre Dame, slip op. at 30-31 (rejecting an \nidentical “hybrid rights” claim). \nFor these reasons, plaintiffs’ free exercise claim—Count II of the Complaint—fails.20 \n  C.  The Regulations Do Not Violate the Free Speech Clause  \nPlaintiffs’ free speech claims fare no better. The right to freedom of speech “prohibits the \ngovernment from telling people what they must say.” Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Inst.  \nRights, Inc. (“FAIR”), 547 U.S. 47, 61 (2006). But the preven tive services coverage regulations \ndo not compel speech—by plaintiffs or any other person, employer, or entity—in violation of the \nFirst Amendment. Nor do they lim it what plaintiffs may say. Plaintiffs rem ain free under the \nregulations to express whatever views they may have on the use of contraceptive services (or any \n                                                           \n20 Even if the regulations were not neutral or generally applicable, plaintiffs’ free exercise challenge still would fail \nbecause the regulations satisfy strict scrutiny. See supra. \n3 4\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 48 of 62 PageID #:  248\nother health care services) as well as their views about the regulations. Plaintiffs, moreover, may \nencourage their employees not to use contraceptive services. \nPlaintiffs contend that the regulations violate their free speech rights in three ways, none \nof which has merit. First, plaintiffs are wrong to contend that the regulations require plaintiffs to \n“support ‘counseling’ in favor of” preventive services to w hich they object. Pls.’ Mem. at 37. \nThe  regulations simply  require coverage of  “education  and counseling for all wom en  with \nreproductive capacity.” HRSA Guid elines, AR at 283-84. There is  no requirement that such \neducation and counseling be “in favor of” any particular contraceptive service, or even in support \nof contraception in general. The con versations that may take place between a patient and her \ndoctor cannot be known or screened in advance  and may cover any number of options. To the \nextent that plaintiffs intend to argue that the covered education and counseling is objectionable \nbecause some of the conversations between  a doctor and one of plaintiffs’ employees might be \nsupportive of contraception, accepting this theory  would mean that the First Am endment is \nviolated by the m ere possibility of an e mployer’s disagreement with a potential subject of \ndiscussion between an employee an d her doctor, and would extend  to all such interactions, not \njust those that are th e subject of the challeng ed regulations. The First Am endment does not \nrequire such a drastic result. See, e.g., Priests for Life, slip op at 37-38; Notre Dame, slip op. at \n34-36; Conestoga, 917 F.Supp.2d at 418-19. \nSecond, plaintiffs note that, in order to avail itself of an accommodation, an organization \nmust self-certify that it meets the definition of “eligible organization.” Pls.’ Mem. at 38. But, \ncontrary to plaintiffs’ assertion, the self-certification does not in any sense “trigger” payments for \ncontraceptive services, Pls.’ Mem. at 38, as th e government cannot require the T PA of a self-\ninsured church plan to provide payments for contraceptive services. Moreover, completion of the \nsimple self-certification form is “plainly incidental to the . . . regulation of conduct,” FAIR, 547 \nU.S. at 62, not speech . Indeed, every court to review a Free Speech challenge to  the prior \ncontraceptive-coverage regulations has rejected it, in part,  because the regulations deal with \nconduct. See Autocam, 2012 WL 6845677, *8; see also MK Chambers, 2013 WL 1340719 at *6 \n3 5\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 49 of 62 PageID #:  249\n(“Like the [law at issue in  FAIR], the contraceptive requirement regulates conduct, not speech.” \n(quotations omitted)); Briscoe v. Sebelius, 927 F. Supp. 2d 1109, 1120 (D. Colo. 2013) (“The  \nplaintiffs cite no authority and I am not aw are of any authority holding that such conduct \nqualifies as speech so as to trigger First Amendment protection.”); Conestoga, 917 F.

Supp. 2d at 1165-67; see also Catholic Charities of Sacramento, 85 P.3d at \n89 (rejecting similar claim); Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Albany , 859 N.E.2d at 465 \n(same). The accommodations likewise regulate conduct by relieving an eligible organization of \nthe obligation “to con tract, arrange, pay, or refe r for contraceptive coverage” to which it ha s \nreligious objections. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874, AR at 6. 21 Plaintiffs’ suggestion that self-certifying \ntheir eligibility for an accommodation, which is incidental to the regulation of conduct, violates \ntheir speech rights lacks merit. See FAIR, 547 U.S. at 61-63. \nThe regulations also do not require plaintiffs to subsidize any conduct that is “inherently \nexpressive.” FAIR, 547 U.S. at 66; see also United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376 (1968) \n(recognizing that some forms of “symbolic speech” are protected by the First Amendment). As \nan initial matter, the regulations explicitly prohibit plaintiffs’ issuers and TPAs from imposing \nany  cost sharing, prem ium,  fee, or other charge   on plaintiffs with respect to the separate \npayments for contraceptive services m ade by the issuers or TPAs. Plaintiffs, therefore, are not \nfunding  or subsidizing a nything  pertaining to contracep tive  coverage. Moreover, even if \nplaintiffs played some role in an issuer’s  or TPA’s provision of paym ents for contraceptive \nservices (and they do not), m aking payments for health care services is  not the sort of conduct \nthe Supreme Court has recognized as inherently expressive.  See Notre Dame, slip op at 36 \n(“[B]ecause the regulations do not force [plaintiff] to say anything, nor do they prevent [plaintiff] \nfrom forthrightly expressing its  views regarding the t opic of contraception, [plaintiff’s] free  \nspeech  rights  are not being infrin ged.”);  Priests  for  Life,  slip op 39 (“[T]here is nothing \n                                                           \n21 Indeed, self-certifying eligibility for a religious accommodation is a far cry from the laws at issue in the cases \nplaintiffs cite, which mandated the posting of specific written messages throughout an organization’s building and \nadvertisements, as well as s peaking oral messages to the organization’s clients. See Pls.’ Mem. at 37 (citing \nEvergreen Ass’n v. City of New York, 801 F. Supp. 2d 197 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) and Centro Tepeyac v. Montgomery \nCnty., 779 F. Supp. 2d 456 (D.

Supp. 2d at 418;  Autocam, 2012 WL 6845677, at *8;  O’Brien, 894 F.

Defendants \nhave been clear that “[n]othing in these final regulations prohibits an eligible organization from \nexpressing its opposition to the use of contraception.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,880 n.41, AR at 12.  \nWhat the regulations prohibit is an employer’s improper attempt to interfere with its employees’ \nability to obtain contraceptive coverage from a third party by, for example, threatening the TPA \nwith a termination of its relationship with the employer because of the TPA’s “arrangem ents to \nprovide or arrange separate payments for contraceptive services for participants or beneficiaries.” \nSee 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(b)(1)(iii); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(iii). Addressing an \nanalogous argument in the context of the Nati onal Labor Relations Act, the Suprem e Court \nconcluded that an em ployer’s threatening statements to its employees regarding the effects of \nunionization fell outside the protec tion of the First Am endment because they interfered with  \nemployee rights. NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co. , 395 U.S. 575, 618 (1969). The Court explained \nthat there was no First Am endment violation because the employer was “free to  communicate \n. . . any of his general views .  . . so long  as the comm unications do not contai n a ‘threat of \nreprisal or force or promise of benefit.’” Id.; see also Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n , 436 U.S. \n447, 456 (1978) (“[I]t has never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to \nmake a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or \ncarried out by means of language, either spoken,  written, or printed.” (quotation omitted)). The \nsame is true here. Because the regulations do not prevent plaintiffs from expressing their views \n3 7\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 51 of 62 PageID #:  251\nregarding  the use of contracepti ve  services, but, rather, prot ect  employees’  right  to obtain \npayments for contraceptive services through TPAs, there is no infringement of plaintiffs’ right to \nfree speech. See Notre Dame, slip op. at 35-36 (rejecting iden tical challenge to the challenged \nregulations).22 \nAccordingly, the regulations do not violate the Free Speech Clause, and Counts III and \nIV of the Complaint should be dismissed or summary judgment granted to the government. \n  D.  The Regulations Do Not Violate the Establishment Clause \n“The clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination \ncannot  be officially preferred over another.”  Larson  v. Valente ,  456 U.S. 228, 244 (1982) \n(emphasis  added). A law that discrim inates  among  religions by “aid[ing] one r eligion”  or \n“prefer[ring] one religion over anothe r” is subject to strict scrutiny.  Id. at 246; see also Notre \nDame,  slip op. at 31-34 (reje cting  a sim ilar  Establishment  Clause claim );  Archbishop  of \nWashington, slip op. at 75-80 (same). Thus, for example, the Supreme Court has struck down on \nEstablishment Clause grounds a stat e statute that was “drafted w ith the explicit  intention” of \nrequiring  “particular religious  denominations”  to com ply  with  registration and reporting \nrequirements while excluding other religious denominations. Larson, 456 U.S. at 254;  see also \nBd. of Educ. of Kiryas Joel  Vill. Sch. Dist. v. Grumet , 512 U.S. 687, 703-07 (1994) (striking \ndown statute that created special school district for religious enclave of Satmar Hasidim because \nit “single[d] out a particular religious sect for special treatment”). The Court, on the other hand, \nhas upheld a statute th at provided an exemption from military service for persons who had a \nconscientious objection to all wars, but not those who objected to only a particular war. Gillette \nv. United States, 401 U.S. 437 (1971). The Court explained  that the statute did not discriminate \namong  religions becau se  “no particula r  sectarian  affiliation”  was required to q ualify  for \nconscientious objector status. Id. at 450-51. “[C]onscientious objector status was available on an \n                                                           \n22  Defendants  acknowledge  that  the  court  in  Archbishop of  Washington concluded  that  the non-interference \nprovision of the accommodation violated the plaintiffs’ free speech rights. See slip op. at 71-74. For the reasons \nstated above, and by the district court in Notre Dame, slip op. at 35-36, defendants respectfully submit that that \naspect of the court’s ruling was error. \n3 8\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 52 of 62 PageID #:  252\nequal basis to both the Quaker and the Roman Catholic.” Larson, 456 U.S. at 247 n.23; see also \nCutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 724 (2005) (upholding RLUIPA against Establishment Clause \nchallenge because it did not “conf er[] . . . privileged status on any particular religious sect” or \n“single[] out [any] bona fide faith for disadvantageous treatment”). \nLike  the statutes at is sue  in  Gillette  and  Cutter,  the  preventive s ervices  coverage \nregulations  do not grant any de nominational  preference or ot herwise  discriminate  among \nreligions. It is of no mom ent that the religious  employer exemption and accommodations for \neligible organizations apply to some e mployers but not others. The regulations do not “violate  \nthe Establishment Clause because [they] delineate[] the contours of a religious acco mmodation \nthat applies equally to o rganizations of every faith and [do] not favor any denom ination over \nanother.” Priests for Life, slip op. at 42-43; accord Notre Dame, slip op. at 31-34; Archbishop of \nWashington, slip op. at 78-80);  O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1163;  see also, e.g., Children’s \nHealthcare Is a Legal Duty, Inc. v. Min De Parle, 212 F.3d 1084, 1090-93 (8th Cir. 2000); Droz \nv. Comm’r of IRS, 48 F.3d 1120, 1124 (9th Cir. 1995); Diocese of Albany, 859 N.E.2d at 468-69. \nHere, the distinctions established by the regulations are not so drawn. \n“Plaintiffs’ [ ] argument—that the Establishment Clause prohibits distinctions among \ndifferent types of organizations affiliated with the same faith—finds no support in Establishment \nClause case law.” Archbishop of Washington, slip op at 78. The exemption and accommodations \nare  available on an   equal  basis  to  organizations  affiliated  with any and all religions. The  \nregulations, therefore, do not di scriminate among religions in vi olation of the Establishm ent \nClause. Indeed, every court to have considered  an Establishment Clause challenge to the prior \nversion of the regulations has rejected it. See, e.g., O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1162 (upholding \nprior version of religious employer exemption because it did “not differentiate between religions, \nbut applie[d] equally to all denom inations”); Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 416-17 (sam e); see \nalso Liberty Univ., Inc. v. Lew, 733 F.3d 72, 100-03 (4th Cir. 2013) (upholding another religious \n3 9\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 53 of 62 PageID #:  253\nexemption contained in the ACA against  an Establishment Clause challenge), cert. denied, No. \n13-306 (Dec. 2, 2013).23 \n“As the Supreme Court has frequently articu lated, there is space between the religion \nclauses, in which there is ‘room  for play in  the joints;’ government may encourage the free \nexercise of religion by granti ng religious accommodations, even if not required by the Free \nExercise Clause, without running afoul of the Establishment Clause.” O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d \nat  1163 (citations om itted).  Accommodations  of  religion  are poss ible  because  the type of \nlegislative line-drawing to which the plaintiffs object in this case is constitutionally permissible. \nId.; Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 417; see, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm’n of NY, 397 U.S. 664, 666 \n(1970); Amos, 483 U.S. at 334 (upholding Title VII’s exemption for religious organizations).24 \nPlaintiffs also claim that the regulations’ definition of re ligious employer violates the \nEstablishment Clause because, more than thirty-five years ago, the In ternal Revenue Service \n(IRS)  developed a non-exhaustive list of four teen  facts and circum stances  that m ay  be \nconsidered,  in addition to “any other fact s  and circumstances which m ay  bear  upon the  \norganization’s claim for church status,” in  assessing whether an organization is a church.  See \n                                                           \n23 Plaintiffs stretch Colorado Christian University v. Weaver, 534 F.3d 1245 (10th Cir. 2008), well beyond its facts \nin suggesting that the case stands for the proposition that the Establishment Clause prohibits the government from \ndistinguishing among different types of organizations that adhere to the same religion. Pls.’ Mem. at 38-39. Weaver \nwas limited to “laws that facially regulate religious issues,” 534 F.3d at 1257, and, particularly, those that do so in a \nway that denies certain religious institutions public benefits that are afforded to all other institutions, secular or \nreligious. The court in Weaver said nothing about the constitutionality of exemptions from generally applicable laws \nthat are designed to accommodate religion, as opposed to discriminate against religion. A requirement that any \nreligious exemption that the government creates must extend to all organizations—no matter their structure or \npurpose—would hamper the government’s ability to accommodate religion. See Corp. of Presiding Bishop of \nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 334 (1987) (“There is ample room under the \nEstablishment Clause for ‘benevolent’ neutrality which will permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship \nand without interference.”); Diocese of Albany, 859 N.E.2d at 464 (“To hold that any religious exemption that is not \nall-inclusive renders a statute non-neutral would be to discourage the enactment of any such exemptions – and thus \nto restrict, rather than promote, freedom of religion.”). And, the manner in which the law at issue in Weaver was \nadministered required the government to make intrusive inquiries into a school’s religious beliefs and practices by, \nfor example, reading syllabi to determine if a school’s theology courses were likely to convince students of religious \ntruths. See 534 F.3d at 1261-62. The religious employer exemption requires no such inquiry: Qualification for the \nexemption does not require the government to make any determination, much less an unconstitutionally intrusive \none. See also Archbishop of Washington, slip op. at 77 (explaining that Weaver does not support the plaintiffs’ \nclaims). \n24 Even if the regulations discriminate among religions (and they do not), they are valid under the Establishment \nClause, because they satisfy strict scrutiny. See supra; Larson, 456 U.S. at 251-52. \n4 0\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 54 of 62 PageID #:  254\nFound. of Human Understanding v. Comm’r of IRS , 88 T.C. 1341, 1357-58  (1987); Internal \nRevenue  Manual (IRM) 7.26.2.2.4. Although plaintiffs  do  not appear to have ever before \nchallenged the constitutionality of  this non-exhaustive list, they  now contend that it acts to \nrequire the government to make impermissible “judgments regarding beliefs, practices, and \norganizational structure.” Pls.’ Mem. at 40-41. This claim fails for numerous reasons. \nAs an initial matter, the claim is not ripe an d therefore should be  dismissed for lack of \njurisdiction. See Archbishop of Washington, slip op. at 84-85 (finding that plaintiffs lack standing \nto  argue that the IRS’s fourteen-factor test   violates the Establishm ent  Clause). The non-\nexhaustive list that plaintiffs seek to challenge  is not set out in any statute, regulation, or other \nbinding source of law. It  is instead contained in the IRM, which serves as a source of guidance \nfor the internal administration of the IRS and is not binding on the IRS or courts. United States v. \nWill, 671 F.2d 963, 967 (6th Cir. 1982);  Capital Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Comm’r of Internal \nRevenue, 96 T.C. 204, 216-17 (1991). A party can cha llenge such guidance “only if and when \nthe directive has been applied specifically to them.” Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, \n1013 (9th Cir. 1987); see also, e.g., Home Builders Ass’n of Greater Chicago v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Eng’rs, 335 F.3d 607, 619 (7th Cir. 2003) (concludi ng general statement of policy was not \nripe for review). Plaintiffs do not challenge any determination by the IRS that was based on this \nIRM provision. Because defendants ha ve not applied a similar non-exhaustive list of facts and \ncircumstances to plaintiffs, plaintiffs’ challenge is not ripe. \nIndeed,  qualification  for  the  religious  employer  exemption do es  not require the \ngovernment to make any determination, whether as a result of the  application of the non-\nexhaustive list or otherwise.  If an organization “is organized  and operates as a nonprofit entity \nand is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or  (a)(3)(A)(iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986, as amended,” it qualifies for the exem ption, without any government action whatsoever. \n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). Plaintiffs, moreover, have no difficulty determining whether they qualify \nfor the exemption. The Diocese alleges that  it qualifies for the exem ption, Compl. ¶ 14, and \nCatholic Charities allege that it does not, id. ¶ 10. Any claim —which plaintiffs do not in fact \n4 1\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 55 of 62 PageID #:  255\nmake—that the government will dispute these allegations and therefore need to undertak e any \nsort of intrusive inquiry into whether plaintiffs qualify for the exemption is entirely speculative \nand thus unripe for this reason as well.  \nFinally, even assuming plaintiffs could mount a facial challenge to a non-exhaustive list \nof facts and circumstances that the defendant agencies have never applied to plaintiffs, any such \nchallenge  would be m eritless.  Any intera ction  between  the g overnment  and religio us \norganizations that may be necessary to enforce the religious em ployer exemption is not so  \n“comprehensive,” Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 619 (1971), or “pervasive,”  Agostini v. \nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 233 (1997) (quotations o mitted), as to result in excessive entanglem ent. \nThe Supreme Court has upheld law s that require government monitoring that is more onerous \nthan any monitoring that m ay be required to  enforce the religious em ployer exemption. See \nBowen  v. Kendrick ,  487 U.S. 589, 615-617 (1988) (no ex cessive  entanglement  where the \ngovernment reviewed and monitored programs and materials); Roemer v. Bd. of Pub. Works of \nMd., 426 U.S. 736, 764–765 (1976) (no excessive en tanglement where the state conducted \nannual audits); see also United States v. Corum, 362 F.3d 489, 496 (8th Cir. 2004). And every \ncourt to address the issue upheld  the prior version of the relig ious employer exemption, which \ncontained  the sam e  requirement  that  the o rganization  be  one that is r eferred  to in   section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (a)(3)(A)(iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, against an \nentanglement challenge. See Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 417;  O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at \n1164-65; Geneva Coll., 929 F. Supp. 2d at 439-40.25  \nThus, plaintiffs’ Establishment Clause claim—Count V of the Complaint—fails. \n \n \n                                                           \n25 Even if this Court were to conclude that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate a facial challenge to the non-exhaustive \nlist of facts and circ umstances set forth in IRM 7.26.2.2.4 and that such nonbinding guidance violates the \nEstablishment Clause, the remedy would be invalidation of the list, not invalidation of the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement or the religious employer exemption. The regulations would survive, with the religious employer \nexemption being available to any organization that is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is a church, \nintegrated auxiliary of a church, convention or association of churches, or the exclusively religious activities of any \nreligious order, as those terms are specifically defined under section 6033 or commonly understood. \n4 2\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 56 of 62 PageID #:  256\nE.  The Regulations Do Not Interfere With Church Governance \nPlaintiffs  also assert th at,  by  allegedly requiring plaintiffs  to  facilitate  practices  in \nviolation of their religious beli efs, the regulations in terfere with plaintiffs’ “internal church \ngovernance” in violation of the Religion Clauses.  See Pls.’ Mem. at 42. But that is m erely a \nrestatement of plaintiffs’ substantial burden theory,26 which fails for reasons explained already. \nIndeed, the main case cited by plaintiffs on this point,  Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran \nChurch & School v. E .E.O.C., 132 S. Ct. 694 (2012), is inapposite. In  Hosanna-Tabor, the \nSupreme Court held that allowing a m inister employee to sue her church em ployer under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act—thereby inter fering with “a church’s ability to se lect its own \nministers”—violates the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses. Id. at 704, 706. But this case \nis not about the selection of clergy, nor any  other matters of church governance apart from \nplaintiffs’ religious objection to providing contraceptive coverage (which, again, is subsumed by \nplaintiffs’  substantial burden argum ent).  Nor is   this case about any  law  that regulates the  \nstructure of the church—plaintiffs m ay choose whatever organizational structure they wish. \nThus,  Count VI should be dism issed  or su mmary  judgment  granted to defendants.  See \nArchbishop of Washington, slip op. at 86-88 (entering summary judgment in favor of defendants \non plaintiffs’ claim that the regulations interfere with church governance). \n  F.  Plaintiffs’ APA Claim Fails \nIn Count VII (the only count not raised in  their temporary restraining order m otion), \nplaintiffs  contend the regulations violate th e  APA because they conflict with the W eldon \nAmendment to the Consolidated Appropriations  Act of 2012. They are incorrect. Plaintiffs  \nappear to reason that, because the preventive services coverage regulations require group health \nplans to cover em ergency contraception, such as  Plan B, they require plaintiffs to provide \ncoverage for abortions in violation of federal law. The W eldon Amendment denies funds made \navailable in the Consolidated Appropriations Act  of 2012 to any federal, state, or local agency, \n                                                           \n26 While the Zubik ruling was incorrect for reasons explained already, supra note 7, that court analyzed arguments \nabout interference with the church under RFRA’s “substantial burden” test. See 2013 WL 6118696 at *27. \n4 3\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 57 of 62 PageID #:  257\nprogram,  or governm ent  that “sub jects  any in stitutional  or  individual  health care entity to \ndiscrimination on the basis that the health care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage \nof, or refer for abortions.” Pub. L. N o. 112-74, §§ 506, 507, 125 Stat. 786, 1111-12 (Dec. 23, \n2011). The regulations, however, do not require that any health plan cover abortion at all, much \nless as a preventive service. The government has made clear that the preventive services covered \nby the regulations do not in clude abortifacient drugs.27 Although plaintiffs are certainly entitled \nto believe that em ergency contraceptives and  certain IUDs are abortifacient drugs or cause \nabortions, neither the government nor this Court is required to accept that characterization, which \nis inconsistent with the FDA’s scientific assessment and with f ederal law. While plaintiffs’ \nreligious beliefs may define abortion m ore broadly than federal law, statutory interpretation \nrequires that terms be construed as a m atter of law and not in accordance with any individual’s \npersonal views or beliefs. E.g., GEICO v. Benton, 859 F.2d 1147, 1149 (3d Cir. 1988). \nIn recommending what contraceptive services should be covered by health plans w ithout \ncost-sharing, the IOM Report identified the contraceptives that have been approved by the FDA \nas  safe and effective.  See  IOM R EP.  at 10, AR at 308. And the list of FDA-approved \ncontraceptives includes emergency contraceptives such as Plan B. See id. at 105, AR at 403. The \nbasis for the inclusion of such drugs among safe and effective means of contraception dates back \nto 1997, when the FDA first explained why Plan B and similar drugs act as contraceptives rather \nthan abortifacients. See Prescription Drug Products; Certain  Combined Oral Contraceptives for \nUse as Postcoital Emergency Contraception, 62 Fed. Reg. 8610, 8611 (Feb. 25, 1997); 45 C.F.R. \n§ 46.202(f). In light of this conclus ion by the FDA, HHS informed Title X grantees, which are \nrequired to offer a range of acceptable and e ffective family planning methods—and, except \nunder limited circumstances, may not offer abortion—that they “should consider the availability \nof emergency contraception the same as any othe r method which has been established as safe \n                                                           \n27 HealthCare.gov, Affordable Care Act Rules on Expanding Access to Preventive Services for Women (August 1, \n2011), available at http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/factsheets/2011/08/womensprevention08012011a.html (last \nvisited Dec. 11, 2013); see also IOM REP. at 22 (recognizing that abortion services are outside the scope of \nrecommendations), AR at 320. \n4 4\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 58 of 62 PageID #:  258\nand  effective.” Office of Populati on  Affairs, Mem orandum  (Apr. 23, 1997), \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/opa/pdfs/opa-97-02.pdf  (last visited D ec.  11, 2013);  see  also  42  U.S.C. \n§§ 300, 300a-6. The regulations are consis tent with over a decade of re gulatory policy and \npractice and thus cannot be deemed contrary to any law dealing with abortion. See Bhd. of R.R. \nSignalmen  v. Surface Transp. Bd. ,  638 F.3d 807, 815 (D.C. Cir.  2011)  (giving particular \ndeference to an agency’s longstanding interpretation).28 \nThus, because the challenged regulations are  not contrary to law, Count VII of the  \nComplaint should be dismissed or summary judgment granted to defendants. \n \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS  CANNOT ESTABLI SH  IRREPARABLE HARM, AND AN  \nINJUNCTION WOULD INJURE THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC \n“The  loss  of First Am endment  freedoms,  for even m inimal  periods of tim e, \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976). Even \nassuming arguendo that same rule applies to a st atutory claim under RFRA,  plaintiffs have not \nshown that the challenged regula tions violate their First Amendm ent or RFRA rights, so there \nhas been no “loss of First Am endment freedoms” for any period of tim e. Id. In this respect, the \nmerits and irreparable injury prongs of the temporary restraining  order analysis merge together, \nand plaintiffs cannot show irreparable injury without also showing a likelihood of success on the \nmerits, which they cannot do. See McNeilly v. Land, 684 F.3d 611, 621 (6th Cir. 2012). \nFurthermore, plaintiffs’ claim to irreparable harm is further underm ined by their own \ndelay in filing suit. Although the challenged regul ations were published in the Federal Register \nin early July, 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, these plaintiffs waited over five months—until December 10, \n2013—to file suit and to seek the extraordinary re medy of a temporary restraining order. Such a \nsubstantial and unexplained delay  seriously undermines these plaintiffs’ claim of irreparable \nharm.  See,  e.g.,  Autocam,  2012 WL 6845677, at *9 (noting, in  a  challenge to the prior \n                                                           \n28 Representative Weldon, the sponsor of the Weldon Amendment, himself did not consider the word “abortion” in \nthe statute to include FDA-approved emergency contraceptives. See 148 Cong. Rec. H6566, H6580 (daily ed. Sept. \n25, 2002) (“The provision of contraceptive services has never been defined as abortion in Federal statute, nor has \nemergency contraception, what has commonly been interpreted as the morning-after pill. . . . [U]nder the current \nFDA policy[,] that is considered contraception, and it is not affected at all by this statute.”). \n4 5\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 59 of 62 PageID #:  259\ncontraceptive-coverage regulations, that “the immediacy of the dilemma Plaintiffs face is in no \nsmall part of their own m aking,” because plaintiffs filed suit “less than two m onths before the \ndeadline Plaintiffs say is critical”); Fund for Animals v. Frizzell , 530 F.2d 982, 987 (D.C. Cir. \n1975) (denying preliminary injunctive relief and noting that a delay of forty-four days after final \nregulations were issued was “inexcusable”). \nTurning to the final two temporary restraining order factors—the balance of equities and \nthe  public interest—“there is i nherent  harm  to an agency in preventing it from enforcing \nregulations that Congress found it in  the public interest to direct  that agency to develop and \nenforce.” Cornish v. Dudas, 540 F. Supp. 2d 61, 65 (D.D.C. 2008); see also Connection Distrib. \nCo. v. Reno, 154 F.3d 281, 296 (6th Cir. 1998) (indicating that granting an injunction against the \nenforcement  of a likely constitutional statute would harm   the governm ent).  Enjoining the \npreventive services coverage regulations as  to plaintiffs would unde rmine the government’s \nability to achieve Congress’s goals of improving the health of women and newborn children and \nequalizing the coverage of preventive services for women and men.29 \nIt would also be contrary to the public interest to deny plaintiffs’ employees (and their \nfamilies)  the  benefits  of  the preventive se rvices  coverage  regulations.  See  Weinberger v.  \nRomero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312-13 (1982) (“[C]ourts . . . should pay particular regard for the \npublic  consequences in e mploying  the extraord inary  remedy  of injunction.”). Many of the \nplaintiffs’ employees may not sh are plaintiffs’ objections to th e challenged regulations. Those \nemployees should not be deprived of the benefits  of payments provided by a third party that is \nnot their employer for the full range of FDA-approved contraceptive services, as prescribed by a \nhealth care provider, on the basis of  their employers’ religious objection. Many wom en do not \n                                                           \n29 Plaintiffs note that defendants consented to preliminary injunctions in a few cases involving for-profit companies, \nsee Pls.’ Mem. at 45-46, but defendants’ consent in those cases was nothing more than an effort to conserve judicial \nand governmental resources. Those cases were in the Seventh, Eighth, and D.C. Circuits, and they were filed after \nmotions panels in those circuits had preliminary enjoined the regulations pending appeal in similar cases. See \nMersino, 2013 WL 3546702 at *16 (“[W]here the government has conceded to injunctive relief, it appears that it has \ngenerally done so in jurisdictions where the legal landscape has been set against them, and continuing to litigate the \nclaims in those jurisdictions would be a waste of both judicial and client resources.”). The government continues to \noppose preliminary injunctions in other circuits regarding for-profit plaintiffs, and opposes in all circuits injunctive \nrelief sought by non-profit plaintiffs like plaintiffs here.  \n4 6\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-1   Filed 12/23/13   Page 60 of 62 PageID #:  260\nuse contraceptive services because they are no t covered by their health plan or requ ire costly \ncopayments, coinsurance, or deductibles.

As a result, in m any cases, both \nwomen and developing fetuses suffer negative health consequences. See IOM REP. at 20, 102-04, \nAR at 318, 400-02; 77 Fed. Reg.  at 8728, AR at 215.  And women are put at a com petitive \ndisadvantage due to their lost productivity and the disproportionate financial burden they bear in \nregard to preventive health services. 155  Cong. Rec. S12106-02, S12114 (daily ed. Dec. 2, \n2009); see also IOM REP. at 20, AR at 318. \nEnjoining defendants from enforcing, as to pl aintiffs, the preventive services coverage \nregulations—the purpose of which is to eliminate these burdens, 75 Fed. Reg. at 41,733, AR a t \n233; see also 77 Fed. Reg. at 8728, AR at 215—would thus inflict a very real harm on the public \nand, in particular, a readily id entifiable group of individuals. See Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 \nF.3d 1109, 1139 (9th Cir. 2009) (v acating preliminary injunction entered by district court and  \nnoting that “[t]here is a general public interest in ensuring that all citizens have timely access to \nlawfully prescribed medications”). Accordingly, even assuming plaintiffs were likely to succeed \non the merits (which they are not for the reas ons explained above), any potential harm  to \nplaintiffs  resulting  from  their of fense  at a  third  party  providing p ayment  for  contraceptive \nservices at no cost to, and w ith no administration by, plaintiffs’ would be outweighed by the \nsignificant harm an injunction would cause these employees and their families. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, defenda nts respectfully ask that the Court deny plaintiffs’ \nmotion for a tem porary restraining order and prelim inary injunction,  and grant defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs’ claims. \nRespectfully submitted this 23rd day of December, 2013, \n   \n  STUART F.

Before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), Pub. L. No. 111-\n148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), due largely  to cost, Americans used preventive services at about half \nthe  recommended rate.   See  INST.  OF  MED.,  CLINICAL  PREVENTIVE  SERVICES  FOR  WOMEN: \nCLOSING THE GAPS 19-20, 109 (2011) (“IOM REP.”), AR at 317-18, 407. \n2.  Section 1001 of the ACA requires all group health plans and health insurance \nissuers that offer non-grandfathered group or individual health coverage to provide coverage for \ncertain  preventive  services  without cost-sh aring,  including,  “[for] wom en,  such additio nal \npreventive care and screenings . . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration [(HRSA)].” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). \n3.  Because there were no existing HRSA guidelines relating to preventive care and \nscreening for women, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) tasked the Institute \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-2   Filed 12/23/13   Page 2 of 10 PageID #:  264\nof Medicine (IOM) with developing recommendations to implement the requirement to provide \ncoverage, without cost-sharing, of preventive services for women. IOM REP. at 2, AR at 300. \n4.  After  conducting an extensive science- based  review, IOM recomm ended  that \nHRSA guidelines include, among other things, “the full range of [FDA]-approved contraceptive \nmethods,  sterilization procedur es,  and patient education and counseling for wom en  with \nreproductive capacity.” Id. at 10-12, AR at 308-10. \n5.  FDA-approved  contraceptive m ethods  include  diaphragms,  oral contraceptive \npills, emergency contraceptives (such as Plan B and Ella), and intrauterine devices (“IUDs”). See \nid. at 105, AR at 403. \n6.  Coverage, without cost-sharing, for these services is necessary to increase access \nto such services, and thereby reduce unintended pregnancies (and the negative health outcomes \nthat disproportionately accompany unintended pregnancies) and promote healthy birth spacing. \nSee id. at 102-03, AR at 400-01. \n7.  On  August 1, 2011, HRSA a dopted  guidelines consistent with IOM’s \nrecommendations,  encompassing  all FDA-appr oved  “contraceptive m ethods,  sterilization \nprocedures, and patient education and counseling,”  as prescribed by a health care provider, \nsubject to an exemption relating to certain religious employers authorized by regulations issued \nthat same day (the “2011 amended interim final regulations”). See HRSA, Women’s Preventive \nServices: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines (“HRSA Guidelines”), AR at 283-84. \n8.  To qualify for the religious em ployer exemption contained in the 2011 am ended \ninterim final regulations, an employer had to meet the following criteria: \n \n(1)  The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization; \n \n(2)  the organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets \nof the organization; \n \n(3)  the organization serves primarily persons who share the religious tenets of \nthe organization; and \n \n(4)  the  organization is a nonprofit orga nization  as described in section \n6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986, as amended. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-2   Filed 12/23/13   Page 3 of 10 PageID #:  265\n76 Fed. Reg. 46,621, 46,623 (Aug. 3, 2011), AR at 220. \n9.  Group  health plans established or m aintained  by religious em ployers,  and \nassociated coverage, are exempt from any requirement to cover contraceptive services consistent \nwith  HRSA’s guidelines.  See  HRSA,  Women’s  Preventive  Services:  Required  Health P lan \nCoverage Guidelines (“HRSA Guidelines”), AR at 283-84; 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). \n10.  In February 2012, the government adopted in final regulations the definition of \n“religious employer” contained in the 2011 amended interim final regulations while also creating \na temporary enforcement safe harbor for non- grandfathered group health plans sponsored by \ncertain non-profit organizations with religious  objections to contraceptive coverage (and any \nassociated group health insurance coverage). See 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8726-27 (Feb. 15, 2012), \nAR at 213-14. \n11.  The government committed to undertake a new rulemaking during the safe harbor \nperiod to adopt new regulations to further accommodate non-grandfathered non-profit religious \norganizations’ religious objections to covering contraceptive services. Id. at 8728, AR at 215. \n12.  The regulations challenged here (the “2013 final rules”) represent the culmination \nof that process. See 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, AR a t 1-31; see also 77 Fed. Reg. 16,501 (Mar. 21, \n2012) (Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM)), AR at 186-93; 78 Fed. Reg. 8456 \n(Feb. 6, 2013) (Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)), AR at 165-85. \n13.  Under the 2013 final rules, a “religious  employer” is “an organization that is \norganized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is  referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or \n(a)(3)(A)(iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,” which refers to churches, their \nintegrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches, and the exclusively religious \nactivities of any religious order. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). \n14.  The 2013 final rules establish accommodations with respect to the contraceptive \ncoverage  requirement  for group health plans  established  or maintained by “eligible \norganizations” (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans). Id. \nat 39,875-80, AR at 7-12; 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-2   Filed 12/23/13   Page 4 of 10 PageID #:  266\n15.  An “eligible organization” is an organization that satisfies the following criteria: \n \n(1)  The  organization opposes providing  coverage  for som e  or all of any \ncontraceptive services required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on \naccount of religious objections. \n \n(2)  The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity. \n \n(3)  The organization holds itself out as a religious organization. \n \n(4)  The organization self-certifies, in  a form and manner specified by the \nSecretary, that it satisfies the criteria  in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of \nthis section, and m akes such self-certification available for examination \nupon  request by the first day of the first plan year to which the \naccommodation in paragraph (c) of this section applies. \n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b); see also 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874-75, AR at 6-7. \n16.  Under the 2013 final rules, an eligible  organization is not required “to contract, \narrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage” to which it has religious objections. 78 Fed. \nReg. at 39,874, AR at 6. \n17.  To be relieved of any such obligations , the 2013 final rules require only that an \neligible organization complete a self-certification form stating that it is an elig ible organization \nand provide a copy of that self-certification to its issuer or third party administrator (TPA). Id. at \n39,878-79, AR at 10-11. \n18.  Its  participants  and  beneficiaries,  however,  will s till  benefit  from separate \npayments for contraceptive services made by the issuer or TPA,  without cost sharing or other \ncharge. Id. at 39,874, AR at 6. \n19.  In the case of an orga nization with a self-insured  group health plan—such as \nplaintiffs here—the organization’s TPA, upon receipt of the self-certification, must, among other \nthings, provide or arrange separate paym ents for contraceptive services for participants and  \nbeneficiaries in the plan without cost-sharing, premium, fee, or other charge to plan participants \nor beneficiaries, or to the eligible organization or its plan. See id. at 39,879-80, AR at 11-12. \n20.  Any costs incurred by the TPA will be re imbursed through an adjustm ent to \nFederally-facilitated Exchange (FFE) user fees. See id. at 39,880, AR at 12. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-2   Filed 12/23/13   Page 5 of 10 PageID #:  267\n21.  The  government  “propos[ed] to m ake  the accommodation or the religious \nemployer exemption available on an e mployer-by-employer basis” in the NPRM. 78 Fed. Reg. \n8456, 8467 (Feb. 6, 2013), AR at 176. \n22.  The 2013 final rules generally apply to group health plans and health insurance \nissuers for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, see id. at 39,872, AR at 4, except the \namendments to the religious employer exemption apply to group health plans and group health \ninsurance issuers for plan years beginning on or after August 1, 2013, see id. at 39,871, AR at 3. \n23.  The  regulations specifically prohib it  TPAs from   charging any prem ium  or \notherwise passing on any costs to eligible organizat ions with respect to the TPAs’ paym ents for \ncontraceptive services. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,880, AR at 12. \n24.  The primary predicted benefit of the prev entive services coverage regulations is \nthat “individuals will experience improved health as a result of reduced transmission, prevention \nor delayed onset, and earlier treatment of disease.” 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726, 41,733 (July 19, 2010), \nAR at 233; see also 77 Fed. Reg. at 8728, AR at 215; 78  Fed. Reg. at 39,872, 39,887, AR at 4, \n19. \n25.  “By  expanding coverage and elim inating  cost sharing for recommende d \npreventive services, [the regulations are] expected to increase ac cess to and utilization of these \nservices, which are not used at optimal levels today.” 75 Fed. Reg. at 41,733, AR at 233; see also \n78 Fed. Reg. at 39,873 (“Research [  ] shows that co st sharing can be a si gnificant barrier to \naccess to contraception.” (citation omitted)), AR at 5. \n26.  Although a majority of employers cover FDA-approved contraceptives, see IOM \nRep. at 109, AR at 407, many women forgo preventive services because of cost-sharing imposed \nby their health plans, see id. at 19-20, 109, AR at 317-18, 407. \n27.  Unintended  pregnancies have proven in   many  cases to have   negative health \nconsequences for women and developing fetuses. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872, AR at 4. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-2   Filed 12/23/13   Page 6 of 10 PageID #:  268\n28.  Unintended pregnancy may delay “entry into prenatal care,” prolong “behaviors \nthat present risks for the developing fetus,” and cause “depression, anxiety, or other conditions.” \nIOM REP. at 20, 103-04, AR at 318, 401-02. \n29.  Contraceptive  coverage further helps to avoid “the increased risk o f  adverse \npregnancy outcomes for pregnancies that are too closely spaced.” Id. at 103, AR at 401; see also \n78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872, AR at 4. \n30.  “Contraceptives also have m edical benefits for women who are contraindicated \nfor  pregnancy, and there are demonstrative preven tive  health  benefits  from  contraceptives \nrelating  to conditions other than pregnancy (f or  example,  prevention of certain cancers, \nmenstrual disorders, and acne).” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872, AR at 4;  see also IOM Rep. at 103-04, \nAR at 401-02. \n31.  “[W]omen have different health needs  than men, and these needs often generate \nadditional costs. Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care \ncosts than men.” 155 Cong. Rec. S12106-02, S12114 (daily ed. Dec. 2, 2009) (statement of Sen. \nFeinstein); 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887, AR at 19; IOM REP. at 19, AR at 317. \n32.  These costs result in women often forgoing preventive care and place women in \nthe workforce at a d isadvantage compared to their m ale coworkers. See, e.g., 155 Cong. Rec. \nS12265-02, S12274 (daily ed. Dec. 3, 2009) (statement of Sen. Murray); 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887, \nAR at 19; IOM REP. at 20, AR at 318. \n33.  The grandfathering of certain health plans with respect to certain provisions of the \nACA is not specifically limited to the preventive services coverage regulations. See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 18011; 45 C.F.R. § 147.140. \n34.  The effect of grandfathering is not r eally a permanent “exemption,” but rather, \nover the long term, a transition in the marketplace with respect to several provisions of the ACA, \nincluding the preventive services coverage provision. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887 n.49, AR at 19. \n35.  A majority of group health plans will have lost their grandfather status by the end \nof 2013. See 75 Fed. Reg. 34,538, 34,552 (June 17, 2010);  see also Kaiser Family Foundation \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-2   Filed 12/23/13   Page 7 of 10 PageID #:  269\nand Health Research & Educational Trust, Employer Health Benefits 2012 Annual Survey at 7-8, \n190, AR at 663-64, 846. \n36.  26 U.S.C. § 4980H(c)(2) does not exem pt small employers from the preventive \nservices coverage regulations. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a); 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887 n.49, AR at \n19. \n37.  Instead,  it excludes em ployers  with fe wer  than fifty full-tim e  equivalent \nemployees from the employer responsibility  provision, meaning that, starting in 2015, such \nemployers are not subject to the possibility of a ssessable payments if they do not provide health \ncoverage to their full-time employees and their dependents. See 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(c)(2). \n38.  Small  businesses that do offer non-gra ndfathered  health coverage to their \nemployees are required to provide coverage  for recommended preventive services, including \ncontraceptive services, without cost-sharing. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887 n.49, AR at 19. \n39.  The only exemption from the preventive  services coverage regulations is the \nexemption for the group health plans of religious employers. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). \n40.  Houses of worship and  their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive \ncoverage on religious grounds ar e more likely than other em ployers to employ people of the \nsame faith who share the sam e objection, and w ho would therefore be less likely than other \npeople to use contraceptive services even if such services were covered under their plan. See 78 \nFed. Reg. at 39,874, AR at 6. \n41.  Congress did not adopt a single (govern ment) payer system financed through \ntaxes and instead opted to build on the existing system of employment-based coverage. See H.R. \nRep. No. 111-443, pt. II, at 984-86 (2010). \n42.  Defendants are constrained by statute from adopting the alternative administrative \nschemes proposed by plaintiffs. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20. \n43.  Plaintiffs’  proposed alternatives are  not  feasible because they would im pose \nconsiderable  new costs and other burdens  on  the governm ent  and would otherwise be \nimpractical. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-2   Filed 12/23/13   Page 8 of 10 PageID #:  270\n44.  Nor  would the proposed alternatives be   equally effective in advancing the \ngovernment’s compelling interests. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20. \n45.  Plaintiffs’  alternatives  would  require establishing  entirely  new governm ent \nprograms  and infrastructures or fundam entally  altering  an  existing  one,  and would require \nwomen to take burdensom e steps to find out a bout the availability of and sign up for a new \nbenefit, thereby ensuring that fewe r women would take advantage of it.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39,888, AR at 20. \n46.  “Nothing  in the[] final regulations pr ohibits  an eligible organization from \nexpressing its opposition to the use of contraception.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,880 n.41, AR at 12. \n47.  The regulations only prohibit an employer’s improper attempt to interfere with its \nemployees’  ability to obtain co ntraceptive  coverage from   a  third  party by, for exam ple, \nthreatening the TPA with a term ination of its relationship with the e mployer because of the \nTPA’s “arrangements to provide or arrange separa te payments for con traceptive services for \nparticipants or beneficiaries.” See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(b)(1)(iii); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A(b)(1)(iii). \n48.  The Women’s Health Amendment, which contained the requirement to provide \ncoverage for recommended preventive services for women without cost-sharing, was intended to \nfill  significant  gaps re lating  to wom en’s  health tha t  existed in the   other prev entive  care \nguidelines identified in the Affordable Care Act.  See 155 Cong. Rec. S12021-02, S12025 (daily \ned. Dec. 1, 2009) (statement of Sen. Boxer); 155 Cong. Rec. S12265-02, S12271 (daily ed. Dec. \n3, 2009) (statement of Sen. Franken). \n49.  The  Weldon  Amendment  denies funds m ade  available in the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2012 to any fe deral, state, or local agenc y, program, or government that \n“subjects any institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the basis that the \nhealth care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.” Pub. L. \nNo. 112-74, §§ 506, 507, 125 Stat. 786, 1111-12 (Dec. 23, 2011). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-2   Filed 12/23/13   Page 9 of 10 PageID #:  271\n50.  “Abortifacient drugs are not included” in  the preventive services covered by the \nregulations. HealthCare.gov, Affordable Care Act Rules on Expanding Access to Preventiv e \nServices  for W omen  (August 1, 2011),  available  at \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/factsheets/2011/08/womensprevention08012011a.html  (last \nvisited Sept. 23, 2013); see also IOM REP. at 22 (recognizing that abor tion services are outside \nthe scope of recommendations), AR at 320. \n51.  The list of FDA-approved contraceptives includes emergency contraceptives such \nas Plan B. See IOM REP. at 105, AR at 403. \n52.  The basis for the inclusion of such  drugs among safe and effective m eans of \ncontraception dates back to 1997, when the FDA  first explained why Plan B and sim ilar drugs \nact  as con traceptives  rather than   abortifacients.  See  Prescription  Drug Products; Certain \nCombined Oral Contraceptives for Use as Po stcoital Emergency Contraception, 62 Fed. Reg. \n8610, 8611 (Feb. 25, 1997); 45 C.F.R. § 46.202(f). \n 53.  In light of this conclusion by the FDA, HHS informed Title X grantees, which are \nrequired to offer a range of acceptable and e ffective family planning methods—and, except \nunder limited circumstances, may not offer abortion—that they “should consider the availability \nof emergency contraception the same as any othe r method which has been established as safe \nand  effective.” Office of Populati on  Affairs, Mem orandum  (Apr. 23, 1997), \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/opa/pdfs/opa-97-02.pdf (last visited Sept. 23, 2013);  see also 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 300, 300a-6. \n54.  Representative Weldon, the sponsor of the Weldon Amendment, did not consider \nthe word “abortion” in the statute to include FDA-approved emergency contraceptives. See 148 \nCong. Rec. H6566, H6580 (daily ed . Sept. 25, 2002) (“The provision of contraceptive services \nhas never been defined as abortion in Federal statute, nor has emergency contraception, what has \ncommonly been interpreted as the morning-after pill. . . . [U]nder the current FDA policy[,] that \nis considered contraception, and it is not affected at all by this statute.”). \nRespectfully submitted this 23rd day of December, 2013, \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 11-2   Filed 12/23/13   Page 10 of 10 PageID #:  272\n   \n  STUART F.

The Catho lic  Diocese  of Beaumont (“the Diocese”) is \nentirely  exempt from   the  contraceptive cove rage  requirement.  And Catholic Charities of \nSoutheast Texas, Inc. (“Catholic Charities”)  is eligible for a regulatory accommodation that \nrelieves it from having to contract, arrange, pay or refer for contra ceptive coverage, and that in \nno way prevents it from continuing to voice its disapproval of contraception or from encouraging \nits  employees  to  refrain from   using con traception.  To  avail itself of this significant \naccommodation,  Catholic Charities need do not hing  more  than provide its third-party  \nadministrator (TPA) with a copy of a self-certification that it is eligible for the accommodation. \nCatholic Charities’ TPA has no obligation to provide contraceptive coverage, either. It is hard to \nfathom how the mere act of requiring Catholic Charities to complete this self-certification could \namount to a “substantial” burden, especially where—as here—the certification requires noting of \nCatholic Charities’ TPA or anyone else with respective to contraceptive coverage. \nNotably, both plaintiffs offer e mployees health coverage through the Diocese' s health \nplan, which, according to plaintiffs, is a sel f-insured “church plan.” Compl. ¶¶ 42, 44. While \ndefendants continue to consider potential options to fully and appropriately extend the consumer \nprotections provided by the regula tions to self-insured church  plans, they acknowledge that, \nunder current law, they lack authority to require  the TPAs of self-insured church plans to make \nthe separate payments for contraceptive services for participants and beneficiaries in such plans \nunder the accommodation. \nFor this and several other reasons, plainti ffs’ motion for a tem porary restraining order \nshould be denied and this case  should be dismissed or summary judgment should be granted in \nfavor of the government. At the outset, as the court in Archbishop of Washington v. Sebelius, No. \n1:13-cv-01441-ABJ  (D.D.C. Dec. 20, 2013), recen tly  recognized, with respect to sim ilarly \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 15 of 62 PageID #:  150\nsituated organizations that offer insurance to their employees through a self-insured church plan, \nthe plaintiffs here lack standing to assert th eir claims. As noted above, because th e Diocese’s \nplan is a self-insured church  plan, the government lacks authority to require plaintiffs’ TPA t o \nmake the separate payments for contraceptive serv ices for participants and beneficiaries in the \nplan  under the accommodation. Becau se  both  plaintiffs offer coverage to   their em ployees \nthrough  the Diocese’s plan, the  injury  of which plaintiffs  complain—that  the regulations \nsomehow require them to facilitate access to c ontraceptive services to which they object on \nreligious grounds or to contract, arrange, or pa y for such services—simply does not apply to \nplaintiffs here and, as a result, plaintiffs lack standing. See id slip op. at 46-51. \nEven  if plaintiffs had standing,   however,  their assertion   that th ese  accommodations \nthemselves  violate their rights und er  RFRA, t he  First A mendment,  and the Adm inistrative \nProcedure Act (APA) would fail. W ith respect to plaintiffs’ RFRA claim, plaintiffs cannot \nestablish a substantial burden on their religiou s exercise—as they must—because, as noted \nabove,  the governm ent  cannot requi re  plaintiffs’ TPA to provide separate paym ents  for \ncontraceptive services to the participants and  beneficiaries of the plan. Thus, the regulations \nimpose absolutely no burden on plaintiffs’ religious exercise, much less a substantial burden as \nrequired under RFRA. Furtherm ore, even if the governm ent could require plaintiffs’ TPA to \nmake the separate payments, the regulations would not require plaintiffs to change their behavior \nin  any significant way. Plaintiffs are not re quired  to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for \ncontraceptive coverage. To the contrary, plaintiffs are free to continue to refuse to do so, to voice \ntheir  disapproval of contracep tion, and to encourage their em ployees to refrain from  using \ncontraceptive services. Plaintiffs contend that the need  for Catholic Charities to self-certify in \norder  to ob tain  the ac commodation  is itself   a  burden on their religious exercise. But the \nchallenged  regulations require Ca tholic  Charities  only to   self-certify  that it has   a religious  \nobjection to providing cont raceptive coverage and otherwise m eets the criteria for an eligible \norganization, and to share that self-certification with its TPA. In other words, Catholic Charities \nis required only to convey to its TPA that it is  a non-profit religious organization that objects to \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 16 of 62 PageID #:  151\nproviding contraceptive services, which it has done or would have to do voluntarily anyway even \nabsent these regulations in order to ensure that  it is not responsible fo r contracting, arranging, \npaying, or referring for such coverage. Plaintiffs can hardly claim that it is a violation of RFRA  \nto require them to do alm ost exactly what they  would do in the ordinary course, absent the \nregulations. See Univ. of Notre Dame v. Seb elius, No. 3:13-cv-01276-PPS-CAN, slip op. at 17-\n24 (N.D. Ind. Dec. 20, 2013) (concluding that th e accommodation does not impose a substantial \nburden on the plaintiff’s  religious exercise); Priests for Life v. U.S. De p’t of Health & Human \nServs., No. 1:13-cv-1261-EGS, slip op. at 17-30 (D.D.C. Dec. 19, 2013) (same). \nFurther,  plaintiffs’  challenge rests   largely on   the theo ry  that ev en  the extrem ely \nattenuated connection between them and the  independent and wholly voluntary provision by \ntheir TPA of payments for contraceptive services to which they object on religious grounds—but \nfor which plaintiffs pay nothing—amounts to a s ubstantial burden on thei r religious exercise. \nThis  cannot be. Regardless of how plaintiffs  frame  their religious beliefs, courts m ust \nindependently consider whether a given law imposes a substantial burden on those beliefs. The \nregulations impose, at most, only the m ost de minimis burden on plaintiffs’  religious exercise, \ntoo slight and attenuated to be  “substantial” under RFRA, and little d ifferent from plaintiffs’ \npayment of salaries to their employees, which those employees can also use to buy contraceptive \nservices if they so choose. \nMoreover, even if the challenged regulations were deemed to impose a substantial burden \non  plaintiffs’ religious   exercise, the regulatio ns  would not violate RFRA because they are  \nnarrowly tailored to serve two compelling interests: improving the health of women and newborn \nchildren, and equalizing the provision of preventive care for women and men so that women can \nparticipate in the workforce, and society more generally, on an equal playing field with men. \nPlaintiffs’ First Amendment claims are equally meritless. Indeed, nearly every court to \nconsider similar First Amendment challenges to the prior version of the regulations has rejected \nthe claims, and their analysis applies here. Plaintiffs’ APA claims also fail. The regulations are in \naccordance with federal law, and defendants’ interpretation of the regulations is not erroneous.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 17 of 62 PageID #:  152\nFor these reasons, and those explained below,  defendants’ motion to dism iss or, in the \nalternative, for summary judgment should be  granted, and plaintiffs’ motion for a tem porary \nrestraining order should be denied. \nBACKGROUND \nBefore the Patient Protection and Affordab le Care Act (“ACA”), Pub. L. No. 111-148, \n124 Stat. 119 (2010), many Americans did not receive the preventive health care they needed to \nstay healthy, avoid or delay the  onset of disease, lead productive lives, and reduce health care \ncosts. Due largely to co st, Americans used preventive services at about half the recommended \nrate. See INST. OF MED., CLINICAL PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR WOMEN: CLOSING THE GAPS 19-\n20, 109 (2011) (“IOM R EP.”), AR at 317-18, 407. 1 Section 1001 of the ACA—which includes \nthe preventive services coverage provision relevant here—seeks to cure this problem by making \npreventive care accessible and affordable for many more Americans. Specifically, the provision \nrequires all group health plans and health insurance issuers that offer non-grandfathered group or \nindividual health coverage to provide coverage  for certain preventive  services without cost-\nsharing, including, “[for] women, such additional preventive care and screenings . . . as provided \nfor in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration \n[(HRSA)].” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). \nBecause  there  were n o  existing HRSA gui delines  relating to  preventive  care and \nscreening for women, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requested that the \nInstitute of Medicine (IOM) develop recommendations to implement the requirement to provide \ncoverage, without cost-sharing, of pr eventive services for women. IOM REP. at 2, AR at 300. 2 \nAfter conducting an extensive science-based re view, IOM recommended that HRSA guidelines \ninclude,  among  other things, well-wom an  visits;  breastfeeding support; dom estic  violence \nscreening; and, as relevant  here, “the full range of [FDA ]-approved contraceptive methods, \nsterilization procedures, and patient educat ion and counseling for wom en with reproductive \n                                                           \n1 Where appropriate, defendants have provided parallel citations to the Administrative Record (AR). \n2 IOM, which was established by the National Academy of Sciences in 1970, is funded by Congress to provide \nexpert advice to the federal government on matters of public health. IOM REP. at iv, AR at 289. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 18 of 62 PageID #:  153\ncapacity.” Id. at 10-12, AR at 308-10. IOM determ ined that coverage, without cost-sharing, for \nthese services is necessary to increase access to such serv ices, and thereby reduce unintended \npregnancies (and the n egative health outcomes that disproportionately accompany unintended \npregnancies) and promote healthy birth spacing. See id. at 102-03, AR at 400-01.3 \nOn August 1, 2011, HRSA adopted guidelines  consistent with IOM’s recommendations, \nsubject to an exemption relating to certain religious employers authorized by regulations issued \nthat same day (the “2011 amended interim final regulations”). See HRSA, Women’s Preventive \nServices: Required Health Plan Coverage Guid elines (“HRSA Guidelines”), AR at 283 -84.4 \nGroup health plans established or maintained by these religious employers (and associated group \nhealth insurance coverage) are ex empt from any requirement to cover contraceptive services \nconsistent with HRSA’s guidelines. See id.; 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). \nIn February 2012, the government adopted in final regulations the definition of “religious \nemployer”  contained in the 2011 a mended  interim  final regulations wh ile  also creating a  \ntemporary  enforcement  safe harbor for non-gr andfathered  group health plans sponsored by \ncertain non-profit organizations with religious  objections to contraceptive coverage (and any \nassociated group health insurance coverage). See 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8726-27 (Feb. 15, 2012), \nAR at 213-14. The government committed to undertake a new rulemaking during the safe harbor \nperiod to adopt new regulations to further accommodate non-grandfathered non-profit religious \n                                                           \n3 At least twenty-eight states have laws requiring health insurance policies that cover prescription drugs to also \nprovide coverage for FDA-approved contraceptives. See Guttmacher Institute, State Policies in Brief: Insurance \nCoverage of Contraceptives (June 2013), AR at 1023-26. \n4 To qualify for the religious employer exemption contained in the 2011 amended interim final regulations, an \nemployer had to meet the following criteria: \n \n(1)  The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization; \n \n(2)  the organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of the organization; \n  \n(3)  the organization serves primarily persons who share the religious tenets of the organization; and  \n \n(4)  the  organization  is a non profit  organization  as  described  in  section 60 33(a)(1)  and  section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. \n \n76 Fed. Reg. 46,621, 46,623 (Aug. 3, 2011), AR at 220. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 19 of 62 PageID #:  154\norganizations’ religious objections to  covering contraceptive services.  Id. at 8728, AR at 215. \nThe  regulations challenged here (the “2013 fina l  rules”) repres ent  the culm ination  of that \nprocess. See 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870 (July 2, 2013), AR at 1-31; see also 77 Fed. Reg. 16,501 (Mar. \n21, 2012) (Advance Notice of Proposed Rulem aking (ANPRM)), AR at 186-93; 78 Fed. Reg. \n8456 (Feb. 6, 2013) (Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)), AR at 165-85. \nThe 2013 final rules represent a significant  accommodation by the governm ent of the \nreligious objections of certain non-profit religious organizations while promoting two important \npolicy  goals. First, the regu lations  provide wom en  who wo rk  for non-profit religious \norganizations with access to contraceptive coverage without cost sharing, thereby advancing the \ncompelling government interests in safeguarding  public health and ensuring that w omen have \nequal access to health care. Second, the regulations advance these interests in a narrowly tailored \nfashion  that does not require non-profit religious   organizations with re ligious  objections  to \nproviding contraceptive coverage to contract, pay, arrange, or refer for that coverage. \nThe 2013 final rules simplify and clarify the religious employer exemption by eliminating \nthe first three criteria and clarifying the fourth criterion. See supra note 5. Under the 2013 final \nrules, a “religious employer” is “an organization that is organized and operates as a nonprofit \nentity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (a)(3)(A)(iii) of the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986, as amended,” which refers to churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or \nassociations of churches, and the exclusively religious activities of any religious order. 45 C.F.R. \n§ 147.131(a). The changes made to the definition of religious employer in the 2013 final rules \nare intended to ensure “that an otherwise exempt plan is not disqualified because the employer’s \npurposes extend beyond the inculcation of relig ious values or becau se the employer hires or \nserves people of different religious faiths.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874, AR at 6. \nThe 2013 final rules also estab lish accommodations with respect to the contraceptive \ncoverage  requirement  for group health plans  established  or maintained by “eligible \norganizations” (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans). Id. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 20 of 62 PageID #:  155\nat 39,875-80, AR at 7-12; 45 C.F.R. §  147.131(b). An “eligible organization” is an organization \nthat satisfies the following criteria: \n \n(1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive \nservices required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on account of religious \nobjections. \n \n(2) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity. \n \n(3) The organization holds itself out as a religious organization. \n \n(4) The organization self-certifies, in a form and manner specified by the S ecretary, \nthat it satisfies the criteria in paragra phs (b)(1) through (3)  of this section, and \nmakes such self-certification available  for examination upon request by the first \nday of the first p lan year to which  the accommodation in paragraph (c) of this  \nsection applies. \n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b); see also 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874-75, AR at 6-7. \nUnder the 2013 final rules, an eligible orga nization is not required “to contract, arrange, \npay, or refer for contraceptive coverage” to w hich it has religious objections. 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39,874, AR at 6. To be relieved of any such obligations, the 2013 final rules require only that an \neligible organization complete a self-certification form stating that it is an elig ible organization \nand provide a copy of that self-cer tification to its issuer or TPA. Id. at 39,878-79, AR at 10-11. \nIts  participants  and benef iciaries,  however, w ill  still ben efit  from  separate  payments  for \ncontraceptive services without cost sharing or other charge. Id. at 39,874, AR at 6. In the case of \nan  organization with an insured group hea lth  plan—such as Catholic Charities—the \norganization’s  health in surance  issuer, upon recei pt  of the self-certification, m ust  provide \nseparate payments to plan participants and bene ficiaries for contraceptive services without cost \nsharing, premium, fee, or other ch arge to plan participants or be neficiaries, or to the eligible \norganization or its plan. See id. at 39,875-77, AR at 7-9. And in the case of an organization with \na self-insured group health plan—such as other  plaintiffs here—the organization’s TPA, upon \nreceipt of the self-certification,  will provide or arrange separa te payments for contraceptive \nservices for participants and beneficiaries in the plan; again, without cost-sharing, premium, fee, \nor other charge to plan participants or beneficiaries, or to the eligible organization or its plan. See \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 21 of 62 PageID #:  156\nid. at 39,879-80, AR at 11-12. Any costs in curred by the TPA will be reim bursed through an \nadjustment to Federally-facilitated Exchange (FFE) user fees. See id. at 39,880, AR at 12. \nThe 2013 final rules generally apply to group h ealth plans and health insurance issuers \nfor plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014,  see id. at 39,872, AR at 4, except that the \namendments to the religious employer exemption apply to group health plans and group health \ninsurance issuers for plan years beginning on or after August 1, 2013, see id. at 39,871, AR at 3. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nDefendants move to dismiss this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) \nand  12(b)(6), respectively. Th e  party invoking federal juri sdiction  bears the burden of \nestablishing its existence, and the Court must determine whether it has subject matter jurisdiction \nbefore addressing the merits of a claim. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94-\n95, 104 (1998). Under Rule 12(b)(6), “the ten et that a court must accept as true all of th e \nallegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of \nthe elements of a cause of action, supported by  mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \nTo the extent that the Court must consider the administrative record in addition to the \nface of the complaint, defendants move, in the alternative, for summary judgment under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 56. A pa rty is entitled to summ ary judgment where the administrative \nrecord demonstrates “that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the moving \nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \nThis memorandum also responds to plaintiffs ’ motion for a tem porary restraining order \nand preliminary injunction. A temporary restraining order is an “extraordinary remedy that may \nonly be awarded upon a clear showing that th e plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. \nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008). A plaintiff “must establish that he is  \nlikely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of  \npreliminary relief, that the balance of  equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 22 of 62 PageID #:  157\npublic interest.” Id. at 20.5 \n \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  THIS  CASE SHOULD BE DISMI SSED  BECAUSE  THE COURT LACKS \nSUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION \n  Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and their \nentire  case, should be dism issed  at the outset for lack of   standing. “[T]he   irreducible \nconstitutional minimum of standing” requires that  a plaintiff (1) have suffered an injury in fact, \n(2) that is caused by the defendant’s conduct, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable \nruling. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). As to the injury prong, a \nplaintiff must demonstrate that it has “suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally \nprotected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) ac tual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical.” Id. at 560 (quotations omitted). Allegations of possible future injury \ndo not suffice; rather, “[a] threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in \nfact.” Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158 (1990) (quotation omitted). \n  The harm alleged by plaintiffs is that, to  avail themselves of the accommodations, the \nchallenged regulations require them to engage in actions that “facilitate” and/or make them the \n“trigger” for the provision of paym ents for contraceptive services by a third party.  See Pls.’ \nMem.  at 9. The Diocese’s plan, however, is a  self-insured  church plan, Com pl.  ¶ 42,  and \ndefendants lack regulatory author ity to require the TPAs of such  self-insured church plans to \nmake the separate payments for contraceptive services for participants and beneficiaries in such \nplans under the accommodation. \n  In general, under the challe nged regulations, when a TPA  receives a copy of the self-\ncertification from an eligible employer that sponsors a self-insured group health plan, that TPA \nbecomes  an ERISA Se ction  3(16), 29 U.S.C.   § 1002(16), plan adm inistrator  and claim s \n                                                           \n5 Plaintiffs’ reliance on out-of-circuit, pre-Winter case law to suggest that the relevant factors “merely ‘guide the \ndiscretion of the court,’” Pls.’ Mem. of Law in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. for TRO & Prelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ Mem.”) at 11, ECF \nNo. 3, is in significant tension with Supreme Court’s requirement that “[a] plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction \nmust establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,” Winter, 555 U.S. at 20 (emphasis added); Choice Inc. of \nTexas v. Greenstein, 691 F.3d 710, 717 n.35 (5th Cir. 2012). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 23 of 62 PageID #:  158\nadministrator for the purpose of providing the separate payments for contraceptive services. See \n29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b). Thus, the contraceptive coverage requirements can be enforced against \nsuch TPAs through defendant Department of Labor’s ERISA enforcement authority. See 78 Fed. \nReg. at 39,879-39,880, AR at 11-12. But church plans  are specifically excluded from the am bit \nof ERISA. See 29 U.S.C. § 1003(b)(2). Thus, ERISA enforcement authority is not available with \nrespect to the TPAs of self-insured church plans under the accommodation, and the government \ncannot compel such TPAs under such authority to provide contraceptive coverage to self-insured \nchurch plan participants and beneficiaries under the accom modation, including the plaintiffs’ \nemployees and their covered dependents. \n  The Diocese is entirely exempt from the regulations, and Catholic Charities remains \neligible  for the acco mmodations  under the final regu lation  promulgated  by  defendant \nDepartment  of the Treasury, 26 C.F.R.  §  54.9815-2713A, and theref ore  need not contract, \narrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage. 6 And neither plaintiffs’ plan nor their TPA is \nrequired under the regulations to  provide separate payments for contraceptive services or to \ncontract or otherwise arrange with a third party for such payments to be made. In short, under the \nchallenged regulations, there is abso lutely no connection between plaintiffs and contraceptive \ncoverage. Thus, the injury of which plaintiffs  complain—that the regulations somehow require \nthem to facilitate access to contraceptive services to which they object on religiou s grounds—\nsimply does not apply to plaintiffs here. 7 Because plaintiffs lack standing to assert their claims, \nthis case should be dism issed in its entirety.  See Archbishop of Washington , slip op. at 46-51 \n(finding that similarly situated plaintiffs lacked standing because there is no “concrete, actual or \nimminent, cognizable injury in fact”). \n \n                                                           \n6  The  same  is  true  with  respect  to  any  other  entity  that  qualifies  as an   “eligible  organization”  under  the \naccommodations, whether or not that organization is a plaintiff in this action. \n7 Nor can plaintiffs complain that their TPAs might voluntarily elect to provide contraceptive coverage \nnotwithstanding the fact that defendants do not have the authority to require them to do so, as this allegation would \nbe far too speculative for the purposes of Article III standing. See Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, \n1147 (2013). \n1 0\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 24 of 62 PageID #:  159\n \nII.  PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS LACK MERIT \n \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Religious Freedom Restoration Act Claim Is Without Merit \n \n1.  The  regulations do not substantia lly  burden plaintiffs’ exercise of \nreligion \nUnder  RFRA, Pub. L. No. 103-141, 107 St at.  1488 (1993) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000bb-1 et seq.), the federal government “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of \nreligion” unless that burden is the least restrictive means to further a compelling governm ental \ninterest. 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1. Importantly, “only substantial burdens on the exercise of religion \ntrigger the compelling interest requirement.” Henderson v. Kennedy, 253 F.3d 12, 17 (D.C. Cir. \n2001) (emphasis added). “A substantial burden exists when government action puts ‘substantial \npressure on an adherent to m odify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.’”  Kaemmerling v. \nLappin, 553 F.3d 669, 678 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing Thomas v. Review Bd. of the Ind. Emp’t Sec. \nDiv., 450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981)); see also Notre Dame, slip op. at 16-17; Priests for Life, slip op. \nat 20. “An inconsequential or de minimis burden on religious practice does not rise to this level, \nnor does a burden on activity unim portant to the adherent’s religious schem e.” Kaemmerling, \n553 F.3d at 678; see also Garner v. Kennedy, 713 F.3d 237, 241-42 (5th Cir. 2013) (“In order to \nshow a substantial burden, the plaintiff must show that the challenged action ‘truly pressures the \nadherent to significantly m odify his religious behavior and signi ficantly violate his religious \nbeliefs.’”). \n  For three reasons, plaintiffs  cannot show that the challeng ed regulations substantially \nburden their religious exercise. For three reasons,  plaintiffs cannot show that the challenged \nregulations  substantially burden  their  religious  exercise. First, as ex plained  above,  because \nplaintiffs’ plan is a self-insured church plan, the challenged regulations do not require plaintiffs’ \nTPA to provide separate payments for contraceptive services, or to contract or otherwise arrange \nwith a third party for such payments to be made with respect to the participants and beneficiaries \nof  plaintiffs’ plan. The regulations, therefore,   impose  absolutely no burden on plaintiffs’  \n1 1\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 25 of 62 PageID #:  160\nreligious exercise, let alone a substantial burden.  See supra Section I.8 Second, even assuming \nthe  regulations  do  require plaintiffs’ TPA to provide  separate  payments  for contraceptive \nservices—which the regulations do not 9—the regulations require virtually nothing of plaintiffs, \nand certainly do not require plaintiffs to modify their behavior in any meaningful way. Thus, the \nregulations cannot be deemed to impose any more than a  de minimis burden on plaintiffs—let \nalone a substantial one. Third, even if this Court finds that the regulations im pose some burden \non plaintiffs’ religious exercise, any such burden would be far too attenuated to be substantial. \n \na.  The regulations impose no more t han a de minimis burden on \nplaintiffs’  exercise of religion  because  the regulations require \nvirtually nothing of plaintiffs \nTo put this case in its simplest terms, plaintiffs challenge regulations that require them to \ndo next to nothing, except what they would have to do even in the absence of the regulations. \nThe Diocese is entirely exempt from the contraceptive co verage requirement.10 And Catholic \n                                                           \n8 Plaintiffs’ heavy reliance on out-of-circuit cases involving for-profit companies (Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. \nSebelius, 723 F.3d 1114 (10th Cir. 2013) (en banc), cert. granted, No. 13-354; Korte v. Sebelius, 735 F.3d 654 (7th \nCir. 2013); and Gilardi v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 733 F.3d 1208 (D.C. Cir. 2013)), as well as the \ndistrict court ruling in Zubik v. Sebelius, No. 2:13-cv-01459, 2013 WL 6118696 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 21, 2013), is \nmisplaced. None of those ca ses involved eligible organizations that offer health coverage through a self-insured \nchurch plan, and thus, the courts had no occasion to address the arguments defendants raise here. Furthermore, those \nout-of-circuit for-profit company cases are inapposite because for-profit corporations—unlike plaintiffs—do not \nqualify for the religious employer exemption or the accommodations for eligible organizations. See 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39,875, AR at 7. Thus, for example, the regulations require for-profit companies to contract or otherwise arrange \nand pay for contraceptive coverage for the participants and beneficiaries of their group health plans. Plaintiffs, by \ncontrast, are in a  markedly different position. As previously explained, the Diocese is exempt, and in order to be \nrelieved of the obligation to contract or otherwise arrange and pay for contraceptive coverage, Catholic Charities \nmust only fulfill the self-certification requirement. Similarly, the district court in Zubik was wrong to rely on those \nfor-profit company cases. The Zubik court’s conclusion that the regulations at issue in that case (and in this one) \nimpose a substantial burden on the plaintiffs in that case—which was rendered without citation to any legal \nauthority, id.at *24-27—is unpersuasive. \n9 Defendants will make this assumption in the remainder of their RFRA argument because plaintiffs’ claims fail \nregardless of whether the challenged regulations require anything of their third-party TPAs.  \n10 Plaintiffs state that the scope of the religious employer exemption adopted in the 2013 final rules is narrower than \nthat contemplated in the ANPRM. See, e.g., Pls.’ Mem. at 8. This contention is both false and irrelevant. Plaintiffs \ncontend that, in the ANPRM, the government suggested that non-exempt organizations that participate in the health \nplan of an exempt organization would benefit from the exemption. But defendants never advanced that interpretation \nof the exemption. Plaintiffs’ misleading quotation from the ANPRM, see id., does not indicate otherwise when read \nin full. In the ANPRM, defendants said: \n \nIn addition, we note that this exemption is available to religious employers in a variety of \narrangements.  For  example,  a C atholic  elementary  school  may  be a di stinct  common-law \nemployer from the Catholic diocese with which it is affiliated. If the school’s employees receive \nhealth coverage through a plan established or maintained by the school, and the school meets the \n1 2\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 26 of 62 PageID #:  161\nCharities, as an eligible orga nization, is not require d to contract, arrange , pay, or refer for \ncontraceptive coverage. To the contrary, Catholic Charities is free to continue to refuse to do so, \nto voice its disapproval of cont raception, and to encourage its em ployees to refrain from using \ncontraceptive services. Catholic Charities need only fulfill the self-certification requirement and \nprovide  the  completed  self-certification  to its   TPA. Ca tholic  Charities need not pay for \ncontraceptive  services  to their employees. In stead,  third parties—pl aintiffs’  TPA—provide \npayments  for contraceptive s ervices,  at no cost   to p laintiffs.  In short, with   respect  to \ncontraceptive coverage, the non-exempt plaintiff, Catholic Charities, need not do anything m ore \nthan it did prior to the promulgation of the challenged regulations—that is, to inform its TPA that \nit objects to providing contraceptive coverage in  order to ensure that it is not responsible for \ncontracting, arranging, paying,  or referring for such coverage . Thus, the regulations do not \nrequire plaintiffs “to modify [their] religious behavior in any way.”  Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at \n679. The Court’s inquiry should end here. A law  cannot be a substantial burden on religious \nexercise when “it involves no ac tion or forbearance on [ plaintiffs’] part, nor . . . otherwise \ninterfere[s] with any religious act in which [plaintiffs] engage[].” Id.; see also Notre Dame, slip \nop. at 17-24; Priests for Life, slip op. at 21-27. \nBecause  the  regulations  place no   burden  at  all  on plaintiffs, they   plainly place no \ncognizable  burden on their religio us  exercise. Plaintiffs’ contrary argum ent  rests on an \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \ndefinition of a religious employer in the final regulations, then the religious employer exemption \napplies. If, instead, the same school provides health coverage for its employees through the same \nplan under which the diocese provides coverage for its employees, and the diocese is exempt from \nthe requirement to cover contraceptive services, then neither the diocese nor the school is required \nto offer contraceptive coverage to its employees. \n \n77 Fed. Reg. at 16,502 (emphasis added), AR at 187. This passage in no way suggests that a non-exempt employer \n(i.e., one that does not meet the definition of “religious employer” in the final rules) would become exempt simply \nby providing coverage through the same plan as an exempt employer. Far from it, both hypotheticals presented in \nthe ANPRM deal with a school—the  “same” school—that itself meets the definition of an e xempt religious \nemployer. Defendants’ decision to exempt entities on an employer-by-employer basis is thus consistent with \ndefendants’  prior  statements  in  the  ANPRM. More over,  the age ncies  expressly  “propose[d]  to  make  the \naccommodation or the religious employer exemption available on an employer-by-employer basis” in the NPRM. 78 \nFed. Reg. at 8467, AR at 176. Finally, even if the scope of the exemption in the final rules were different from what \nwas originally proposed in the ANPRM—which it is not—plaintiffs have not indicated why that would be improper. \nIn fact, that is the very purpose of the rulemaking process. See, e.g., Ne. Md. Waste Disposal Auth. v. EPA, 358 F.3d \n936, 951 (D.C. Cir. 2004). \n1 3\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 27 of 62 PageID #:  162\nunprecedented and sweeping theory of what it mean s for religious exercise to be burdened. Not  \nonly  do plaintiffs wa nt  to be free from   contracting,  arranging, paying, or referring for \ncontraceptive  services for their employees—w hich,  under these regulations, they are—but \nplaintiffs would also prevent anyone else from providing such coverage to their employees, who \nmight not subscribe to plaintiffs’ religious beliefs. That this is the de facto impact of plaintiffs’ \nstated objections is made clear by their sugg estion that RFRA is violated whenever they are a  \n“but-for cause” of the provision of  the objectionable products and services. See, e.g., Compl. \n¶ 84. This theory would mean, for example, that even the government would not realistically be \nable to provide contraceptive coverage to plaintiffs’ employees (as plaintiffs elsewhere suggest), \nbecause it would be “trigger[ed],”  id.; Pls.’ Mem. at 9, by plainti ffs’ refusal to provide such \ncoverage themselves. But RFRA is a shield, not a sword,  see O’Brien v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & \nHuman Servs., 894 F. Supp. 2d 1149, 1158-60 (E.D. Mo. 2012),  appeal pending, No. 12-3357 \n(8th Cir.), and accordingly it does not prevent the government from providing alternative means \nof achieving important statutory objectives once it has provided a religious accommodation. Cf. \nBowen  v.  Roy,  476 U.S. 693, 699 (1986) (“The Free Ex ercise  Clause sim ply  cannot be \nunderstood to require the Governm ent to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that com port \nwith the religious beliefs of particular citizens.”). \nPlaintiffs’  RFRA challenge is s imilar  to the  claim  that the D.C. Circuit rejected in \nKaemmerling. There, a federal prisoner objected to the FBI’s collection of his DNA profile. 553 \nF.3d  at 678. In concluding that this collecti on  did not substantially  burden  the prisoner’s \nreligious exercise, the court concluded that “[t]he extraction and storage of DNA information are \nentirely activities of the FBI, in which Kae mmerling plays no role an d which occur af ter the \nBOP has taken his fluid or tissue sample (to which he does not object).” Id. at 679. In the court’s \nview, “[a]lthough the government’s activities with his fluid or tissue sample after the BOP takes \nit may offend Kaemmerling’s religious beliefs, they cannot be sa id to hamper his religious \nexercise because they do not pressure [him] to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.” Id. \n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The same is true here, where the provision of \n1 4\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 28 of 62 PageID #:  163\ncontraceptive services is “entirely [an] activit[y] of [a third party], in which [plaintiffs] play[] no \nrole.”  Id.  As  in  Kaemmerling,  “[a]lthough the [third party]’s   activities . . . m ay  offend \n[plaintiffs’] religious beliefs, they cannot be said to hamper [their] religious exercise.” Id. \n  Perhaps understanding the tenuous ground on whic h their RFRA claim rests, given that \nthe regulations do not require them to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive services, \nplaintiffs attempt to circumvent this problem by advancing the novel theory that the regulations \nrequire  them  to som ehow  “facilitate acce ss”  to contrac eptive  coverage,  and that it is th is \n“facilitation” that violates  plaintiffs’ religious beliefs. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 5, 9, 13, 16; Pls.’ \nMem at 21-22. But the challenged regulations do  not require the Diocese to do anything, and \nrequire  Catholic  Charities  only  to self-certify that it obj ects  to providing coverage for \ncontraceptive services and that it otherwise meets the criteria for an eligible organization, and to \nshare that self-certification with its TPA. In other words, Catholic Charities is required to inform \nits TPA that it objects to provi ding contraceptive coverage, which it has done or would have to \ndo voluntarily anyway even absent these regulations  in order to ensure that it is not responsible \nfor contracting, arranging, paying, or referring for contraceptive coverage. The sole difference is \nthat it must inform its TPA that its objection is for religious reasons—a statement it has already \nmade repeatedly in this litigation and elsewhere. \nFurthermore,  any burden im posed  by the pu rely  administrative  self-certification \nrequirement—which should take Catholic Charities a matter of minutes—is, at most, de minimis, \nand thus cannot be “substantial” under RFRA. Courts have made clear that the substantial burden \nhurdle is a high one.  Living Water Church of God  v. Charter Twp. of Meridian , 258 F. App’x \n729, 734 (6th Cir. 2007);  see also Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 678 (“A n inconsequential or  de \nminimis burden on religious practice does not rise to  this level [of a substantial burden].”);  \nWashington v. Klem, 497 F.3d 272, 279-81 (3d Cir. 2007);  McEachin v. McGuinnis, 357 F.3d \n197, 203 n.6 (2d Cir. 2004); Civil Liberties for Urban Believers, 342 F.3d at 761. Indeed, if this \nis not a  de minimis burden, it is hard to  see what would be.  In fact, plaintiffs’ alternative \nproposals only confirm that the alleged “burden” of self-certification is de minimis. They contend \n1 5\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 29 of 62 PageID #:  164\nthat, as an alternative to th e accommodations developed by th e Departments, the government \nshould somehow expand or create other public programs so as to provide contraceptive coverage \nto  the women who participate  in  their group health plans.  RFRA plainly does not require \ndefendants to expand or create governm ent programs, particularly where, as here, there is no \nstatutory  authority to do so.  See  infra  Section II.A.2.b. But, in an y  event, plaintiffs’ own \nproposals would entail the same putative “burden” as the existing accommodations, or an even \ngreater burden: One wa y or another, plaintiffs would have to certif y their eligibility for an \naccommodation, and the result would be that the wo men who participate in their plan would get \ncontraceptive coverage through  another source such as Medi caid. The government would of \ncourse, as it does with Medicaid, have to verify employment and/or dependent beneficiary status \nwith the eligible organ ization. The current accommodations are thus likely to req uire less of \nplaintiffs’ involvement than would a governm ent program to separately provide contraceptive \ncoverage for their employees and dependents. \nContrary to plaintiffs’ suggestion, the m ere fact that Catholic Charities claim s that the \nself-certification requirement imposes a substantial burden on its  religious exercise by requiring \nit to “facilitate” access to contraception does not m ake it so. See Conestoga Wood Specialties \nCorp. v. Sebelius, 917 F. Supp. 2d 394, 413 (E.D. Pa. 2013) (“[W ]e reject the notion . . . that a \nplaintiff shows a burden to be substantial simply by claiming that it is.”), aff’d, 724 F.3d 377 (3d \nCir. 2013). Under RFRA, plaintiffs are entitled to their sincere religious beliefs, but they are not \nentitled to decide what does and does not im pose a substantial burden on such beliefs. Although \n“[c]ourts are not arbiters of  scriptural interpretation,”  Thomas, 450 U.S. at 716, “RFRA still \nrequires the court to determine whether the burden a law imposes on a plaintiff’s stated religious \nbelief is ‘substantial,’” Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 413. Plaint iffs would limit the Court’s \ninquiry to two prongs: first, whether plaintiffs’ religious objections to the regulations are sincere, \nand  second, whether the regulations apply signif icant pressure to plaintiffs to comply. But  \nplaintiffs ignore a critical third criterion of the “substantial burden” test, which gives meaning to \nthe term “substantial”: whether the challenged regulations actually  require plaintiffs to modify \n1 6\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 30 of 62 PageID #:  165\ntheir behavior in a significant—or more than  de minimis—way. See Living Water Church of \nGod, 258 F. App’x at 734-36; see also, e.g., Vision Church v. Vill. of Long Grove, 468 F.3d 975, \n997 (7th Cir. 2006) (noting, in  the RLUIPA context, that “t he Supreme Court has found a \n‘substantial burden’ to exist when the governm ent puts ‘substantial pressure on an adherent to \nmodify his behavior and to violate his beliefs’” (quoting  Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals \nComm’n of Fla., 480 U.S. 136, 141 (1987))) (emphasis added); Westchester Day Sch. v. Vill. of \nMamaroneck, 504 F.3d 338, 348-49 (2d Cir. 2007); Church of Scientology of Ga., Inc. v. City of \nSandy Springs, Ga., 843 F. Supp. 2d 1328, 1353-54 (N.D. Ga. 2012). As plaintiffs them selves \nappear to recognize, a “law ‘subs tantially burdens’ an exercise of religion if it compels one “to \nperform acts undeniably at odds with fundamental tenets of [one’s] religious beliefs,” Pls.’ Mem. \nat 23 (quoting  Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 218 (1972)) (em phasis added), “or ‘put[s]  \nsubstantial pressure on an adherent to  modify his behavior and violate his beliefs.’” Id. (quoting \nThomas, 450 U.S. at 717-18) (emphasis added). This test does not require the Court to delve into \nthe theological merits of a belief, b ut instead to examine the operation of the regu lations and \ntheir impact on plaintiffs’ religious practice. See Autocam, 2012 WL 6845677 at *7-8.11 \nUnder plaintiffs’ alternative interpretation of RFRA, courts would play virtually no role \nin determining whether an alleged burden is “s ubstantial”—as long as a  plaintiff’s religious \nbelief is sincere, that would be  the end of the inquiry. Plaintiffs would thus be allowed to evade \nRFRA’s threshold by simply asserting that the burden on their religious exercise is “substantial,” \nthereby paradoxically reading the term “substantial” out of RFRA. See id. at *6 (“The Court does \n                                                           \n11 In Hobby Lobby, a bare majority of the en banc Tenth Circuit concluded that, in determining whether a burden is \nsubstantial, a court’s “only task is to determine whether the claimant's belief is sincere, and if so, whether the \ngovernment has applied substantial pressure on the claimant to violate that belief.” 723 F.3d at 1137. The \ngovernment believes that the majority’s ruling in Hobby Lobby was wrong on this and many other points. However, \neven if this Court were inclined to agree with the Tenth Circuit, the majority proceeded to rely on Abdulhaseeb v. \nCalbone, 600 F.3d 1301 (10th Cir. 2010), which makes clear that in order for a law to impose a substantial burden, it \nmust require some actual change in religious behavior—either forced participation in conduct or forced abstention \nfrom conduct. See Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1138 (citing Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1315). The Hobby Lobby \nsubstantial  burden  analysis  is also   inapposite  because  for-profit co rporations  are no t  eligible  for th e \naccommodations. For similar reasons, the Seventh Circuit’s substantial burden analysis in Korte—which followed \nHobby Lobby—is unpersuasive. See Korte, 735 F.3d at 687. \n \n1 7\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 31 of 62 PageID #:  166\nnot doubt the sincerity of Plaintiff Kennedy’s deci sion to draw the line he does, but the Court  \nstill has a duty to assess whether the claim ed burden—no matter how sincerely felt—really \namounts to a substantial burden on a person’s exer cise of religion.”). “I f every plaintiff were \npermitted to unilaterally determine that a law burdened their religious beliefs, and courts were \nrequired to assume that such burden was substantial, simply because the plaintiff claimed that it \nwas the case, then the standard expressed by Congress under the RFRA would convert to an ‘any \nburden’ standard.” Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 413-14; see also Autocam, 2012 WL 6845677, \nat *7; Mersino Mgmt. Co. v. Sebelius, No. 13-CV-11296, 2013 WL 3546702, at *16 (E.D. Mich. \nJuly 11, 2013).12 The result would be to subject every ac t of Congress to strict scrutiny every \ntime a plaintiff could articulate a sincerely held religious objection to compliance with that law. \nFinally, plaintiffs seem to suggest that the re gulations will actually require them to fund \nor subsidize access to contraceptive coverage because their issuers will find a way to pass on the \ncosts of such coverage to plaintiffs.  See, e.g., Pls.’ Mem. at 20. But the regulations specifically \nprohibit  plaintiffs’ TPA from   charging any pr emium  or otherwise pa ssing  on any costs to \nplaintiffs with respect to the issuers’ payments for contraceptive services. See 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39,880, AR at 12; see also Notre Dame, slip op. at 23-24. Any suggestion that plaintiffs’ TPA(s) \nwill violate the law is purely spe culative, and boils down to the baseless a rgument that the \nregulations  impose  a s ubstantial  burden beca use  a third party m ight  violate those sam e \nregulations. This contention has no merit. \nIn  sum,  the regulations do not impose a su bstantial  burden on plaintiffs’ religious \nexercise, and thus Count I should be dismissed or summary judgment granted to defendants. \n \n \n                                                           \n12 RFRA’s legislative history makes clear that Congress did not intend such a relaxed standard. The initial version of \nRFRA prohibited the government from imposing any “burden” on free exercise, substantial or otherwise. Congress \namended the bill to add the word “substantially,” “to make it clear that the compelling interest standards set forth in \nthe act” apply “only to Government actions [that] place a substantial burden on the exercise of” religious liberty. 139 \nCong. Rec. S14350-01, S14352 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1993) (statement of Sen. Kennedy); see also id. (text of \nAmendment No. 1082). \n1 8\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 32 of 62 PageID #:  167\nb.  Even if the regulations were found to impose some more than de \nminimis burden on plaintiffs’ exercise of religion, any such burden \nwould be far too attenuated to be “substantial” under RFRA \nAlthough the regulations do not require plainti ffs to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for \ncontraceptive coverage, plaintiffs’ complaint appears to be that the regulations require plaintiffs \nto indirectly facilitate conduct on the part of their employees that they find objectionable (i.e., the \nuse of certain contraceptives). But this complaint has no limits. An employer provides numerous \nbenefits, including a salary and ot her fringe benefits, to its em ployees and by doing so in som e \nsense facilitates whatever use its employees make of those benefits. Plaintiffs not only seek to be \nfree  from  the  requirement  to contract, arrange ,  pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage \nthemselves—which they are under these regulations—but also seek to prevent anyone else from  \nproviding such coverage to their employees. But an employer has no right to control the choices \nof its employees, who may not share its religious beliefs, and who have a legitimate interest in \naccess to the preventive services coverage made available under the challenged regulations. \nIndeed,  courts  have  held that claim s  raised b y  for-profit com panies  challenging  the \ncontraceptive coverage regulations, which—unlike here—actually require employers to contract, \narrange, pay, or refer for the relevant coverage  themselves, are too attenuated to am ount to a \nsubstantial burden under RFRA. See, e.g., Autocam, 2012 WL 6845677, at *6-7. Any burden on \nplaintiffs, which are eligible for the religious employer exemption or the accommodations, is a \nfortiori too attenuated to be substantial. For example, the district court in Conestoga reasoned \nthat the ultimate decision of whether to use contraception “rests not with [the employer], but with \n[the] employees” and that “any burden im posed by the regulations is too attenuated to be \nconsidered substantial.” 917 F. Supp. 2d at 414-15. The  Conestoga court further explained that \nthe indirect nature of any burden imposed by the regulations distinguished them from the statutes \nchallenged in Yoder, Sherbert, Thomas, and Gonzales. See Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 415; \nsee also, e.g., Autocam, 2012 WL 6845677, at *6; O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1158-60.13 \nAs these courts concluded, the preventive services coverage regulations result in only an \n                                                           \n13 See also Korte, 735 F.3d at 705-15 (Rovner, J., dissenting); Eden Foods, 2013 WL 1190001; Annex Medical, Inc. \nv.

Not only are plaintiffs separated from the use of contraception by “[a] \nseries of events” that must occur before the u se of contraceptive services to which plaintiffs \nobject would “come into play,” Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 414-15, but they are also further  \ninsulated  by  the f act  that a th ird  party—plaintiffs’  TPA—and  not  plaintiffs,  will a ctually \ncontract, arrange, pay, and refer for such services, and thus plaintiffs are in no way subsidizing—\neven indirectly—the use of prev entive services that they find objectionable. Under plaintiffs’ \ntheory, their religious exercise  is substantially burdened when one of their employees and her \nhealth care provider m ake an independent determination that the use of certain contraceptive \nservices is appropriate, and such services are paid for exclusively by plaintiffs’ issuers, with none \nof the cost being passed on to plaintiffs, and  no administration of the paym ents by plaintiffs, \nsolely  because  plaintiffs self-certified that  they  have religious ob jections  to providing \ncontraceptive coverage and so informed their issuers. \nBut a burden cannot be “substantial”  under RFRA when it is attenuated.  See Autocam, \n2012 WL 6845677, at *6-7. Cases that  find a substantial burden unifor mly involve a direct \nburden on the plaintiff rather than a burden imposed on another entity. See, e.g., Potter v. Dist. of \nColumbia, 558 F.3d 542, 546 (D.C. Cir. 2009); see also Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 413-14. A \nplaintiff cannot establish a substantial burden on his religious exercise by invoking this type of  \ntrickle-down theory; to constitute a substantial burden under RFRA, the burden must be imposed \non the plaintiff him self. See Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 411, 413;  Autocam, 2012 WL \n6845677, at *7.14 Here, of course, there is no such direct burden. In fact, given that any payment \n                                                           \n14 Thomas is not to the contrary. In Thomas, the Supreme Court recognized that “a compulsion may certainly be \nindirect and still constitute a substantial burden, such as the denial of a benefit found in Thomas.” Conestoga, 917 F. \nSupp. 2d at 415 n.15. But that is not so where the burden itself is indirect, as it is h ere. See id.. As previously \nexplained, see supra note 9, in Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d 1114, a bare majority of the en banc Tenth Circuit concluded \nthat the word “substantial” in RFRA refers to the “intensity of coercion” rather than to the directness or indirectness \nof the burden, if any, on a plaintiff’s religious exercise. Id. at 1137-40. The Tenth Circuit’s conclusion that the \nsubstantial burden requirement relates to the intensity of the coercion, however, is inconsistent with Kaemmerling, \ndiscussed above, as well as other decisions that have analyzed “substantial burden” in terms of the degree to which \nthe challenged law directly imposes a requirement or prohibition on religious practice. See 553 F.3d at 678-79; \n2 0\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 34 of 62 PageID #:  169\nfor contraceptive services is made by plaintiffs’ issuers, the regulations have even less impact on \nplaintiffs’ religious exercise than plaintiffs’ payment of salaries to their employees, which those \nemployees can use to purchase contraceptives. See O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1160; Conestoga, \n917 F. Supp. 2d at 414;  Korte, 735 F.3d at 715-16 (Rovner, J., dissenting);  Autocam, 2012 WL \n6845677, at *6. \nPlaintiffs  remain  free t o  refuse t o  contract,  arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive \ncoverage; to voice their disapproval of contra ception; and to encourage their employees t o \nrefrain from using con traceptive services. The regulations therefor e affect plaintiffs’ religious \npractice, if at all, in a most attenuated way. In short, because the prev entive services coverage \nregulations “are several degrees  removed from imposing a substantial burden on [plaintiffs],”  \nO’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1160, the Court should dism iss plaintiffs’ RFRA claim, or grant \nsummary judgment to defendants, even if it finds—contrary to the government’s argument—that \nthe challenged regulations impose some burden on plaintiffs’ religious exercise.  \n \n2.  Even if there w ere a substantial burden on religious  exercise, the \nregulations serve compelling governmental interests and are the least \nrestrictive means to achieve those interests \n \na.  The  regulations significantly  advance  compelling govern mental \ninterests in public health and gender equality \nEven  if  plaintiffs  were able to de monstrate  a substantial burden on their religious \nexercise,  they  would not prevail because th e  challenged  regulations  are justified by two \ncompelling interests, and are the le ast restrictive means to achieve th ose interests. First, the \npromotion of public health is  unquestionably a compelling interest. Mead v. Holder, 766 F. \nSupp. 2d 16, 43 (D.D.C. 2011); see also, e.g., Buchwald v. Univ. of N.M. Sch. of Med., 159 F.3d \n487, 498 (10th Cir. 1998); Dickerson v. Stuart, 877 F. Supp. 1556, 1559 (M.D. Fla. 1995). And \nthe  challenged regulations further this com pelling  interest by “expanding access to and \nutilization of recommended preventive services for women.” 78 Fed.

And, again, the substantial burden analysis in Hobby Lobby and Korte are inapplicable to \nthis case.

See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872, AR at 4. As IOM \nconcluded in identifying services recomm ended to “prevent conditions harm ful to women’s \nhealth and well-being,” unintende d pregnancy may delay “entry in to prenatal care,” prolong \n“behaviors that present risks for the developing  fetus,” and cause “depression, anxiety, or other \nconditions.” IOM REP. at 20, 103-04, AR at 318, 401-02.

U.S. Jaycees, 468 \nU.S. 609 (1984), there is a fundam ental “importance, both to the  individual and to society, of \nremoving the barriers to econom ic advancement and political and social integration that have \nhistorically  plagued certain disa dvantaged  groups, including wom en.”  Id.  at  626. Thus, \n“[a]ssuring  women  equal access to   . . . goods, privileges, and  advantages  clearly furthers  \ncompelling state interests.” Id. By including in the ACA preventive health services for women, \nCongress made clear that the goals and benefits of effective preventive health care apply equally \nto women, who might otherwise be excluded from such benefits if their unique health care needs \nwere not taken into account in the ACA. As  explained by members of Congress, “women have \ndifferent health needs than m en, and these needs often generate additi onal costs.

Congress’s attempt to equalize the provision of \npreventive health care services, with the resulting benefit of women being able to contribute to \nthe same degree as m en as healthy and productive  members of society, furthers a compelling \ngovernmental interest. Cf. Catholic Charities of Sacramento, Inc. v. Superior Court, 85 P.3d 67, \n92-93 (Cal. 2004).15 \n                                                           \n15 In arguing that the government’s interests are not compelling, plaintiffs suggest the government must separately \nanalyze the impact of and ne ed for the regulations as to each and every employer and employee in America. See \nPls.’ Mem. at 27. But this level of specificity would be impossible to establish and would render this regulatory \nscheme—and potentially every regulatory scheme challenged due to religious objections—completely unworkable. \nSee United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 259-60 (1982). In practice, courts have not required the government to \nanalyze the impact of a regulation on the single entity seeking an exemption, but have conducted the inquiry with \nrespect to all similarly situated individuals or organizations. See, e.g., id. at 260 (considering the impact on the tax \nsystem if all religious adherents—not just the plaintiff—could opt out); United States v. Oliver, 255 F.3d 588, 589 \n(8th Cir. 2001) (per curiam) (“Oliver has argued a one-man exemption should be made, however, there is nothing so \n2 3\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 37 of 62 PageID #:  172\nAlthough the challenged regulations further these two compelling governmental interests, \nwhile simultaneously accommodating the religious objections of eligible organizations, plaintiffs \nmaintain that the inte rests underlying the regulations cannot be considered com pelling when \nmillions of people are not protected by the regulations at the moment. Pls.’ Mem. at 27-28. But \nthis is not a case where underinc lusive enforcement of a law suggests that the governm ent’s \n“supposedly vital interest” is not really compelling. Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. \nCity of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546-47 (1993). For the most part, the “exemptions” referred to by \nplaintiffs are not exemptions from the preventive  services coverage regul ations at all, but are \ninstead provisions of the ACA that exclude  individuals and entities  from other requirements \nimposed by the ACA. Or they reflect th e government’s attempts to balance the  compelling \ninterests underlying the challenged regulations against other si gnificant interests supporting the \ncomplex administrative scheme created by the ACA.  See Lee, 455 U.S. at 259 (“The Court has \nlong recognized that balance m ust be struck be tween the values of th e comprehensive social \nsecurity system, which rests on a complex of actuarial factors, and the consequences of allowing \nreligiously based exemptions.”); Winddancer, 435 F. Supp. 2d at 695-98  (recognizing that the \nregulations  governing access to  eagle  parts “strik e  a delicat e  balance” between   competing \ninterests). And, unlike the exemption plaintiffs seek for employers that object to the regulations \non religious grounds, the existing exceptions do  not undermine the government’s interests in a \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \npeculiar or special with Oliver’s situation which warrants an exception. There are no safeguards to prevent similarly \nsituated individuals from asserting the same privilege and leading to uncontrolled eagle harvesting.”); Dole v. \nShenandoah Baptist Church, 899 F.2d 1389, 1398 (4th Cir. 1990) (“There is no principled way of exempting the \nschool without exempting all other sectarian schools and thereby the thousands of lay teachers and staff members on \ntheir payrolls.”); see also, e.g., Graham v. Comm’r, 822 F.2d 844, 853 (9th Cir. 1987), overruled in part on other \ngrounds by Navajo Nation v. U.S. Forest Serv., 479 F.3d 1024, 1033 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc); United States v. \nWinddancer, 435 F. Supp. 2d 687, 697 (M.D. Tenn. 2006). Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao Do \nVegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 435 (2006), is not to the contrary. To be sure, the Court rejected “slippery-slope” arguments \nfor refusing to accomm odate a particular claim ant. See 546 U.S. at 435-36. But it construed the scope of the \nrequested exemption as encompassing all members of the plaintiff religious sect. See id. at 433. Similarly, the \nexemption in Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, encompassed all Amish children; and the exemption in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 \nU.S. 398 (1963), encompassed all individuals who had a religious objection to working on Saturdays. See O Centro, \n546 U.S. at 431. The Court’s warning in O Centro against “slippery-slope” arguments was a rejection of arguments \nby analogy—that is, speculation that providing an exemption to one group will lead to exemptions for other non-\nsimilarly situated groups. It was not an invitation to ignore the reality that an exemption for a particular claimant \nmight necessarily lead to an exemption for an entire category of similarly situated entities. \n2 4\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 38 of 62 PageID #:  173\nsignificant way. See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 547;  S. Ridge Baptist Church v. Indus. Comm’n of \nOhio, 911 F.2d 1203, 1208-09 (6th Cir. 1990); see also 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887, AR at 19. \nFor example, the grandfathering of certain  health plans with respec t to certain ACA \nprovisions is not limited to the preventive services coverage regulations. See 42 U.S.C. § 18011; \n45 C.F.R. § 147.140. In fact, the effect of grandfathering is not really a permanent “exemption,” \nbut rather, over the long term, a transition in the marketplace with respect to several provisions \nof the ACA, including the preven tive services coverage provision.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887 \nn.49, AR at 19. The grandfathering provision reflects Congress’s attempts to balance competing \ninterests—specifically,  the inte rest  in spread ing  the benefits of the ACA, including those \nprovided by the preventive services coverage provision, and the inte rest in maintaining existing \ncoverage and easing the transition into the ne w regulatory regime established by the ACA—i n \nthe context of a complex statutory scheme. See 75 Fed. Reg. 34,538, 34,546 (June 17, 2010). \nThis incremental transition does not call into question the compelling interests furthered \nby the preventive services coverage regulations.  Even under the grandfathering provision, it is \nprojected that more group health plans will transition to the requirements under the regulations \nover time. Defendants have estimated that a majority of group heal th plans will have lost their \ngrandfather status by the end of 2013. See id. at 34,552; see also Kaiser Family Foundation and \nHealth Research & Educational Trust, Em ployer Health Benefits 2012 A nnual Survey at 7-8, \n190,  AR at 663-64, 846. Thus, any purported adve rse  effect on the com pelling  interests \nunderlying the regulations will be quickly mitigated, which is in stark contrast to the permanent \nexemption plaintiffs seek. Plaintiffs would have this Court believe that an interest cannot truly be \n“compelling” unless Congress is willing to im pose it on everyone all at once despite com peting \ninterests, but plaintiffs offer no support for that untenable proposition.16 \n                                                           \n16 Plaintiffs also allude to a “small-employer exemption[].” Pls.’ Mem. at 27-28. But 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(c)(2) does \nnot, as plaintiffs suggest, exempt small employers from the challenged regulations. Small businesses that elect to \noffer non-grandfathered health coverage to their employees are required to provide coverage for recommended \npreventive health services without cost sharing. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13. And, small employers have business \nincentives to offer health coverage to their employees; an otherwise eligible small employer would lose eligibility \nfor certain tax benefits if it did not do so. See 26 U.S.C. § 45R. \n2 5\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 39 of 62 PageID #:  174\nThe  only true exem ption  from  the preventive   services coverage regulations is the  \nexemption for the group health plans of religious employers. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). But there is \na rational distinction between this narrow exception and the expansion plaintiffs seek. Houses of \nworship  and their in tegrated  auxiliaries  that  object  to contraceptive  coverage  on religious \ngrounds  are m ore  likely than other em ployers,  including organizations eligible for the \naccommodations, to employ people of the sa me faith who share the sam e objection, and who \nwould therefore be less likely to use contracep tive services even if such services were covered  \nunder their plan.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874, 39,887, AR at 6,  19. In any event,  it would be \nperverse to hold that the governm ent’s provision of a limited religious exemption eliminates its \ncompelling interest in the regulation, thus eff ectively extending the same exemption to anyone \nelse who wants it under RFRA. Such a reading of RFRA would discourage the government from \naccommodating religion, the opposite of what Congress intended in enacting RFRA. \nGranting  plaintiffs the m uch  broader  exemption  they request w ould  undermine \ndefendants’ ability to enforce the regulations in a  rational manner. See O Centro, 546 U.S. at \n435. We are a “cosmopolitan nation made up of people of alm ost every conceivable religious \npreference,” Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 606 (1961);  see also S. Ridge Baptist Church , \n911 F.2d at 1211, and many people object to various medical services. If any organization with a \nreligious objection were able to claim an exemption from the operation of the preventive services \ncoverage regulations—even where the regulations require virtually nothing of the organization—\nit is difficult to see how defendants could administer the regulations in a m anner that would \nachieve  Congress’s goals of i mproving  the h ealth  of wom en  and  newborn  children and \nequalizing the coverage of preventive services for wom en. See United States v. Israel, 317 F.3d \n768, 772 (7th Cir. 2003) (recognizing that granti ng plaintiff’s RFRA claim  “would lead to \nsignificant administrative problems for the [government] and open the door to a . . . proliferation \nof claims”). Indeed, women who receive their health coverage through employers like plaintiffs \nwould face negative health and other outcomes because they had obtained employment with an \norganization  that objects to its em ployees’  use  of contraceptiv e  services,  even  when those  \n2 6\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 40 of 62 PageID #:  175\nservices are paid for and adm inistered by a third party.  See id. (noting consequences “for the \npublic and the government”); 77 Fed. Reg. at 8728, AR at 215; 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887, AR at 19. \n \nb.  The regulations are the least restrictive means of advancing the \ngovernment’s compelling interests \nWhen determining whether a particular regulato ry scheme is the “least res trictive,” the \nappropriate inquiry is whether the individual or organization with religious objections, and those \nsimilarly situated, can be exempted from the scheme—or whether the scheme can otherwise be \nmodified—without undermining the government’s compelling interests. See, e.g., United States \nv. Schmucker, 815 F.2d 413, 417 (6th Cir. 1987);  United States v. Wilgus, 638 F.3d 1274, 1289-\n95 (10th Cir. 2011). The governm ent is not requi red “to do the im possible—refute each and \nevery  conceivable alternative reg ulation  scheme.”  Wilgus,  638 F.3d at 1289. Instead, the \ngovernment need only “refute the alternative schemes offered by the challenger.” Id. \nInstead of explaining how plaintiffs and similarly situated eligible organizations could be \nexempted  from  the regulations without significant dam age  to the governm ent’s  compelling \ninterests, plaintiffs conjure up,  without any statutory support,  several brand new statutory and \nregulatory schemes—most of which would requi re the government to pay for contraceptive \ncoverage—that they claim would be less restrictive.  See Pls.’ Mem. at 33. Yet plaintiffs fail to \nrecognize that such alternatives would be incom patible with the fundamental statutory scheme \nset forth in the ACA, which plaintiffs do not challenge in this lawsuit. Congress did not adopt a \nsingle (government) payer system financed through taxes and instead opted to build on the \nexisting system of employment-based coverage. See H.R. Rep. No. 111-443, pt. II, at 984-86 \n(2010).  Plaintiffs point to no statutory authority   for any of their proffered less restrictive \nalternatives. Nor is there any  indication that Congress would ha ve contemplated that agency \naction  could be inv alidated  under  RFRA because th e  agency  in  discharging  its  statutorily \ndelegated authority failed to adopt an alternative scheme absent any statutory authority for doing \nso. Thus, even if defendants wanted to adopt on e of plaintiffs’ non-employer-based alternatives, \nthey would be constrained by the statute from doing so. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20. \n2 7\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 41 of 62 PageID #:  176\nFurthermore,  plaintiffs them selves  indicate  that they would “oppose m any  of”  the \nalternatives that they put forth. Pls.’ Mem. at 33. Indeed, as noted above, it is not clear why the \ngovernment’s  provision  of contraceptive cove rage  to wom en  based upon their em ployer’s \nobjection to providing it would not  be subject to exactly the same RFRA claim that plaintiffs \nadvance here. By their own admission then, plaintiffs’ proposals would do little—if anything—to \nsatisfy their religious objections , and therefore should not be cons idered viable less restrictive \nalternatives. See New Life Baptist Church Acad. v. Town of E. Longmeadow , 885 F.2d 940, 950-\n51 (1st Cir. 1989) (Breyer, J.) (considering the  limited extent to which an alternative would \nalleviate a religious burden in rejecting it as  a “less restrictive alte rnative,” even though the \nplaintiff had expressed a preference for the a lternative over the challen ged requirements). An \neligible organization’s religious objection to contraceptive coverage would still “facilitate” the \navailability of such coverage—in this case,  by the government—and the eligible organization \nwould likely be called upon to verify or certify  matters such as the  religious objection to \ncontraceptive coverage, and employment or plan beneficiary status. Plaintiffs cannot plausibly \ncontend that the regulations ar e not the least restrictive means while simultaneously asserting \nthat they would oppose their own suggested alternatives. \nFinally, even if plaintiffs w ould be satisfied by  their proposed alternative schemes, just \nbecause plaintiffs can devise an en tirely new legislative and administrative scheme does not \nmake that scheme a feasible less restrictive means,  see Wilgus, 638 F.3d at 1289;  Adams v. \nComm’r of Internal Revenue , 170 F.3d 173, 180 n.8 (3d Cir. 1999) , particularly where such \nalternatives would come at enormous administrative and financial cost to the governm ent. A \nproposed alternative scheme is not an adequate alternative—and thus not a viable less restrictive \nmeans to achieve a compelling interest—if it is not feasible. See, e.g., New Life Baptist, 885 F.2d \nat 947; Graham, 822 F.2d at 852. In determ ining whether a proposed alternative schem e is \nfeasible, courts often consider the additional administrative and fiscal costs of the scheme. See, \ne.g., S. Ridge Baptist Church, 911 F.2d at 1206; Fegans v. Norris, 537 F.3d 897, 905-06 (8th Cir. \n2008); United States v. Lafley, 656 F.3d 936, 942 (9th Cir. 2011);  New Life Baptist, 885 F.2d at \n2 8\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 42 of 62 PageID #:  177\n947. Defendants considered pl aintiffs’ alternatives and determined that they were not feasible \nbecause  the agencies lacked statu tory  authority  to im plement  them;  they would i mpose \nconsiderable new costs and other burdens on  the government; and they would otherwise be \nimpractical. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20; see also, e.g., Lafley, 656 F.3d at 942; Gooden \nv. Crain, 353 F. App’x 885, 888 (5th Cir. 2009); Adams, 170 F.3d at 180 n.8. \nNor would the proposed alternatives be equa lly effective in advancing the government’s \ncompelling interests. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20;  see also, e.g., Kaemmerling, 553 \nF.3d at 684 (finding that m eans was least restrictive where no a lternative means would achieve \ncompelling interests); Murphy v. State of Ark., 852 F.2d 1039, 1042-43 (8th Cir. 1988) (sam e). \nAs discussed above, Congress determ ined that the best way to achieve the goals of the ACA, \nincluding expanding preventive services coverage, was to build on the existing em ployer-based \nsystem. The anticipated benefits of the preventive services coverage regulations are attributable \nnot only to the fact that recommended contraceptive services will be available to women with no \ncost-sharing,  but also to the fact that these  services  will be available through the existing \nemployer-based system of health co verage through which women will face m inimal logistical \nand  administrative  obstacles  to receiving cov erage  of their care. Plaintiffs’ alternatives, b y \ncontrast,  have none of   these advantages. They   would require estab lishing  entirely new \ngovernment programs and infrastructures or f undamentally altering existing ones, and would \nalmost certainly require women to take burdensome steps to find out about the availability of and \nsign up for a new benefit, thereby ensuring that fewer women would take advantage of it. See 78 \nFed. Reg. at 39,888, AR at 20. Nor do plaintiffs of fer any suggestion as to how these programs \ncould be integrated with the  employer-based system or how women would obtain government-\nprovided  preventive  services in p ractice.  Thus,  plaintiffs’  proposals—in  addition  to rais ing \nmyriad administrative and logistical difficulties and being unauthorized by any statute and not \nfunded by any appropriation—are less likely to achieve the compelling interests furthered by the \nregulations, and therefore do not represent reasonable less restrictive means.

The Regulations Do Not Violate the Free Exercise Clause \n  A law that is neutral and ge nerally applicable does not run afoul of the Free Exercis e \nClause even if it prescribes conduct that an indi vidual’s religion proscribes or has the incidental \neffect of burdening a particular religious practice. Emp’t Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 879 (1990). \n“Neutrality and general applicability are interrelated.” Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 531. A law is neutral \nif it does not target religiously m otivated conduct either on its face or as applied.  Id. at 533. A \nneutral law has as its purpose something other than the disapproval of a particular religion, or of \nreligion in general. Id. at 545. A law is generall y applicable so long as  it does not selectively \nimpose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief. Id.  \n  Unlike such selective laws, the preventive se rvices coverage regulations are neutral and \ngenerally applicable. Indeed, nearly every court to have consid ered a free exercise challenge to \nthe prior version of the regulations has rejected it, concluding that the regulations are neutral and \ngenerally applicable.18 See, e.g., Notre Dame, slip op. at 25-31; Priests for Life, slip op. at 30-35; \nArchbishop  of Washington ,  slip op. at 51-60,   Autocam,  2012 WL 6845677, at *5. “The  \nregulations were passed, not with the object of interfering with religious practices, but instead to \nimprove women’s access to health care and les sen the disparity between men’s and women’s \n                                                           \n17 Plaintiffs cite extra-record evidence in support of many of their arguments. For example, they cite a law review \narticle for the proposition that the challenged regulations “are unlikely to significantly impact contraceptive use.” \nSee Pls.’ Mem. at 30. The introduction of this and other extra-record evidence is inappropriate and should not be \nconsidered by the Court. Plaintiffs are challenging agency regulations, and thus this Court’s review is limited to the \nadministrative record. See, e.g., United States v.

Supp. 2d at 1162. The exception \nfor grandfathered plans is available on equal terms to all employers, whether religious or secular. \nAnd  the religious em ployer  exemption  and elig ible  organization accommodations serve to \naccommodate religion, not to disfavor it. Id.; see also Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 410. Thus, \nthese categorical exceptions and accommodations do not trigger strict scrutiny. \nCarving  out an exem ption  for defined reli gious  entities also does not m ake  a law \nnonneutral as to others. Indeed, the religious employer exemption “presents a strong argument in \nfavor of neutrality” by “demonstrating that the  object of the law was not to infringe upon or \nrestrict practices because of their relig ious motivation.” O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1161 \n(quotations omitted); see Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 410 (“The f act that exemptions were \nmade for religious em ployers . . . . shows that  the government made efforts to a ccommodate \nreligious beliefs, which counsels in favor of the regulations’ neutrality.”). The regulations are not \nunlawful merely because the religious em ployer exemption does not extend as far as Plaintiffs \nwish. \nPlaintiffs’ reliance on Lukumi, 508 U.S. 520, is of no help, as  this case is a far cry from \nLukumi, where the legislature specifically targeted the religious exercise of members of a single \nchurch (Santeria) by enacting ordinances that used terms such as “sacrifice” and “ritual,” id. at \n533-34, and prohibited few, if any, animal killings other than Santeria sacrifices, id. at 535-36. \nHere, there is no indica tion that the regulations are anything other than an effort to increase \nwomen’s access to and utilization of recommended preventive services. See Notre Dame, slip op. \nat 27-28; Priests for Life, slip op. at 52-55; O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1161; Conestoga, 917 F. \nSupp. 2d at 410. Plaintiffs’ unsupported assertion th at the regulations are  “part of a conscious \npolitical strategy to marginalize and delegitimize Plaintiffs’ religious views by holding them  up \nfor ridicule on the national stage,” Pls.’ Mem . at 34, is mere rhetorical bluster. And it cannot be \ndisputed that defendants have made extensive efforts—through the religious employer exemption \nand the eligible organization accommodations—to accommodate religion in ways that will not \n3 2\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 46 of 62 PageID #:  181\nundermine  the goal of ensuring that wom en  have  access to coverage for recomm ended \npreventive services without cost sharing.19 \nPlaintiffs also posit that the regulations m ust have been designed to target plaintiffs’ \nreligious  practice of refusing to facilitate ac cess  to co ntraception  because, prior to th e \npromulgation of the regulations,  “85% of health plans already  cover[ed] contraception.” Pls.’ \nMem. at 35. As an initial matter, this 85 percent figure represents only large employers, not small \nemployers (only 62 percent of which covered cont raception prior to issuance of the regulations) \nor plans on the individual market. IOM REP. at 109, AR at 407. More importantly, many of the \nplans that covered contraceptive services imposed cost-sharing requirements that often resulted \nin women forgoing preventive care.  Id. at 19-20, 109. The regulations elim inate that cost-\nsharing. Finally, even if plaintiffs could show that the regulations have a disproportionate effect \non them (and they have not), it would not destroy the regulations’ neutrality. See O’Brien, 894 F. \nSupp. 2d at 1161 (rejecting identical argum ent). “[A] neutral and perf ectly constitutional law \nmay have a disproportionate impact upon religiously inspired behavior . . . . The  Free Exercise \nClause is not violated even though a group motivated by religious reasons may be more likely to \nengage in the proscribed conduct.” Id. (citing cases). Indeed, by plaintiffs’ logic, the government \nalso was “target[ing],” Pls.’ Me m. at 34, those with religious obj ections to vaccinations, as a \nsimilar or even greater percentage of health plans covered vaccinations prior to promulgation of \nthe challenged regulations. See 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726, 41,732 (July 19, 2010), AR at 232. \nFinally, plaintiffs maintain that the challenged regulations are subject to strict scrutiny \nunder a “hybrid rights” theory because they also infringe on plaintiffs’ freedom of speech and \nassociation.  The Suprem e  Court, however, ha s  never invoked this so -called  “hybrid rights \ntheory” to justify applying strict  scrutiny to a free exercise claim . See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 567 \n                                                           \n19 Fraternal Order of Police v. City of Newark, 170 F.3d 359 (3d Cir. 1999), an out-of-circuit case on which \nplaintiffs also rely (Pls.’ Mem. at 34), addressed a policy that created a secular exemption but refused all religious \nexemptions. The preventive services coverage regulations, in contrast, contain an exemption and accommodations \nthat specifically seek to accommodate religion. Thus, unlike in Fraternal Order, there is simply no basis here to \ninfer a discriminatory object behind the regulations. See Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 409-10. \n \n3 3\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 47 of 62 PageID #:  182\n(Souter,  J., concurring in part and concurring   in the judgm ent)  (noting  the hybrid rights \nexception would either swallow the Smith rule or be entirely unnecessa ry). And several circuits \nhave specifically rejected the theory. See Knight v. Conn. D ep’t of Pub. Health, 275 F.3d 156, \n167 (2d Cir. 2001); Kissinger v. Bd. of Trs. of Ohio State Univ., 5 F.3d 177, 180 (6th Cir. 1993). \nNevertheless, assuming arguendo that the hybrid rights theory is valid, it applies only where the \nplaintiff’s non-free-exercise claims are “independently viable.”  Mahoney v. Dist. of Columbia , \n662 F. Supp. 2d 74, 95 n.12 (D.D.C. 2009). Here, plaint iffs assert that the preventive services \ncoverage provision violates both the right to free  exercise of religion and their rights to free  \nspeech and free association. Yet, p laintiffs do not even raise a separate free association claim \nand, as explained below, their free speech claims  are meritless. “‘[A] plaintiff does not allege a \nhybrid rights claim entitled to strict scrutiny analysis merely by combining a free exercise claim \nwith an utterly m eritless claim of the violation of anothe r alleged fundamental right.’” Civil \nLiberties for Urban Believers, 342 F.3d at 765 (quoting Miller v. Reed, 176 F.3d 1202, 1207-08 \n(9th Cir. 1999)); see also Henderson, 253 F.3d at 19 (“[ T]he combination of two untenable  \nclaims” does not “equal[] a tenable one.”). Thus, ev en if the hybrid rights  theory were valid, it \nwould not trigger strict scrutiny in this case.  See Notre Dame, slip op. at 30-31 (rejecting an \nidentical “hybrid rights” claim). \nFor these reasons, plaintiffs’ free exercise claim—Count II of the Complaint—fails.20 \n  C.  The Regulations Do Not Violate the Free Speech Clause  \nPlaintiffs’ free speech claims fare no better. The right to freedom of speech “prohibits the \ngovernment from telling people what they must say.” Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Inst.  \nRights, Inc. (“FAIR”), 547 U.S. 47, 61 (2006). But the preven tive services coverage regulations \ndo not compel speech—by plaintiffs or any other person, employer, or entity—in violation of the \nFirst Amendment. Nor do they lim it what plaintiffs may say. Plaintiffs rem ain free under the \nregulations to express whatever views they may have on the use of contraceptive services (or any \n                                                           \n20 Even if the regulations were not neutral or generally applicable, plaintiffs’ free exercise challenge still would fail \nbecause the regulations satisfy strict scrutiny. See supra. \n3 4\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 48 of 62 PageID #:  183\nother health care services) as well as their views about the regulations. Plaintiffs, moreover, may \nencourage their employees not to use contraceptive services. \nPlaintiffs contend that the regulations violate their free speech rights in three ways, none \nof which has merit. First, plaintiffs are wrong to contend that the regulations require plaintiffs to \n“support ‘counseling’ in favor of” preventive services to w hich they object. Pls.’ Mem. at 37. \nThe  regulations simply  require coverage of  “education  and counseling for all wom en  with \nreproductive capacity.” HRSA Guid elines, AR at 283-84. There is  no requirement that such \neducation and counseling be “in favor of” any particular contraceptive service, or even in support \nof contraception in general. The con versations that may take place between a patient and her \ndoctor cannot be known or screened in advance  and may cover any number of options. To the \nextent that plaintiffs intend to argue that the covered education and counseling is objectionable \nbecause some of the conversations between  a doctor and one of plaintiffs’ employees might be \nsupportive of contraception, accepting this theory  would mean that the First Am endment is \nviolated by the m ere possibility of an e mployer’s disagreement with a potential subject of \ndiscussion between an employee an d her doctor, and would extend  to all such interactions, not \njust those that are th e subject of the challeng ed regulations. The First Am endment does not \nrequire such a drastic result. See, e.g., Priests for Life, slip op at 37-38; Notre Dame, slip op. at \n34-36; Conestoga, 917 F.Supp.2d at 418-19. \nSecond, plaintiffs note that, in order to avail itself of an accommodation, an organization \nmust self-certify that it meets the definition of “eligible organization.” Pls.’ Mem. at 38. But, \ncontrary to plaintiffs’ assertion, the self-certification does not in any sense “trigger” payments for \ncontraceptive services, Pls.’ Mem. at 38, as th e government cannot require the T PA of a self-\ninsured church plan to provide payments for contraceptive services. Moreover, completion of the \nsimple self-certification form is “plainly incidental to the . . . regulation of conduct,” FAIR, 547 \nU.S. at 62, not speech . Indeed, every court to review a Free Speech challenge to  the prior \ncontraceptive-coverage regulations has rejected it, in part,  because the regulations deal with \nconduct. See Autocam, 2012 WL 6845677, *8; see also MK Chambers, 2013 WL 1340719 at *6 \n3 5\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 49 of 62 PageID #:  184\n(“Like the [law at issue in  FAIR], the contraceptive requirement regulates conduct, not speech.” \n(quotations omitted)); Briscoe v. Sebelius, 927 F. Supp. 2d 1109, 1120 (D. Colo. 2013) (“The  \nplaintiffs cite no authority and I am not aw are of any authority holding that such conduct \nqualifies as speech so as to trigger First Amendment protection.”); Conestoga, 917 F.

The accommodations likewise regulate conduct by relieving an eligible organization of \nthe obligation “to con tract, arrange, pay, or refe r for contraceptive coverage” to which it ha s \nreligious objections. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874, AR at 6. 21 Plaintiffs’ suggestion that self-certifying \ntheir eligibility for an accommodation, which is incidental to the regulation of conduct, violates \ntheir speech rights lacks merit. See FAIR, 547 U.S. at 61-63. \nThe regulations also do not require plaintiffs to subsidize any conduct that is “inherently \nexpressive.” FAIR, 547 U.S. at 66; see also United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376 (1968) \n(recognizing that some forms of “symbolic speech” are protected by the First Amendment). As \nan initial matter, the regulations explicitly prohibit plaintiffs’ issuers and TPAs from imposing \nany  cost sharing, prem ium,  fee, or other charge   on plaintiffs with respect to the separate \npayments for contraceptive services m ade by the issuers or TPAs. Plaintiffs, therefore, are not \nfunding  or subsidizing a nything  pertaining to contracep tive  coverage. Moreover, even if \nplaintiffs played some role in an issuer’s  or TPA’s provision of paym ents for contraceptive \nservices (and they do not), m aking payments for health care services is  not the sort of conduct \nthe Supreme Court has recognized as inherently expressive.  See Notre Dame, slip op at 36 \n(“[B]ecause the regulations do not force [plaintiff] to say anything, nor do they prevent [plaintiff] \nfrom forthrightly expressing its  views regarding the t opic of contraception, [plaintiff’s] free  \nspeech  rights  are not being infrin ged.”);  Priests  for  Life,  slip op 39 (“[T]here is nothing \n                                                           \n21 Indeed, self-certifying eligibility for a religious accommodation is a far cry from the laws at issue in the cases \nplaintiffs cite, which mandated the posting of specific written messages throughout an organization’s building and \nadvertisements, as well as s peaking oral messages to the organization’s clients. See Pls.’ Mem. at 37 (citing \nEvergreen Ass’n v. City of New York, 801 F. Supp. 2d 197 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) and Centro Tepeyac v. Montgomery \nCnty., 779 F. Supp. 2d 456 (D.

Defendants \nhave been clear that “[n]othing in these final regulations prohibits an eligible organization from \nexpressing its opposition to the use of contraception.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,880 n.41, AR at 12.  \nWhat the regulations prohibit is an employer’s improper attempt to interfere with its employees’ \nability to obtain contraceptive coverage from a third party by, for example, threatening the TPA \nwith a termination of its relationship with the employer because of the TPA’s “arrangem ents to \nprovide or arrange separate payments for contraceptive services for participants or beneficiaries.” \nSee 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(b)(1)(iii); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(iii). Addressing an \nanalogous argument in the context of the Nati onal Labor Relations Act, the Suprem e Court \nconcluded that an em ployer’s threatening statements to its employees regarding the effects of \nunionization fell outside the protec tion of the First Am endment because they interfered with  \nemployee rights. NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co. , 395 U.S. 575, 618 (1969). The Court explained \nthat there was no First Am endment violation because the employer was “free to  communicate \n. . . any of his general views .  . . so long  as the comm unications do not contai n a ‘threat of \nreprisal or force or promise of benefit.’” Id.; see also Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n , 436 U.S. \n447, 456 (1978) (“[I]t has never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to \nmake a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or \ncarried out by means of language, either spoken,  written, or printed.” (quotation omitted)). The \nsame is true here. Because the regulations do not prevent plaintiffs from expressing their views \n3 7\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 51 of 62 PageID #:  186\nregarding  the use of contracepti ve  services, but, rather, prot ect  employees’  right  to obtain \npayments for contraceptive services through TPAs, there is no infringement of plaintiffs’ right to \nfree speech. See Notre Dame, slip op. at 35-36 (rejecting iden tical challenge to the challenged \nregulations).22 \nAccordingly, the regulations do not violate the Free Speech Clause, and Counts III and \nIV of the Complaint should be dismissed or summary judgment granted to the government. \n  D.  The Regulations Do Not Violate the Establishment Clause \n“The clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination \ncannot  be officially preferred over another.”  Larson  v. Valente ,  456 U.S. 228, 244 (1982) \n(emphasis  added). A law that discrim inates  among  religions by “aid[ing] one r eligion”  or \n“prefer[ring] one religion over anothe r” is subject to strict scrutiny.  Id. at 246; see also Notre \nDame,  slip op. at 31-34 (reje cting  a sim ilar  Establishment  Clause claim );  Archbishop  of \nWashington, slip op. at 75-80 (same). Thus, for example, the Supreme Court has struck down on \nEstablishment Clause grounds a stat e statute that was “drafted w ith the explicit  intention” of \nrequiring  “particular religious  denominations”  to com ply  with  registration and reporting \nrequirements while excluding other religious denominations. Larson, 456 U.S. at 254;  see also \nBd. of Educ. of Kiryas Joel  Vill. Sch. Dist. v. Grumet , 512 U.S. 687, 703-07 (1994) (striking \ndown statute that created special school district for religious enclave of Satmar Hasidim because \nit “single[d] out a particular religious sect for special treatment”). The Court, on the other hand, \nhas upheld a statute th at provided an exemption from military service for persons who had a \nconscientious objection to all wars, but not those who objected to only a particular war. Gillette \nv. United States, 401 U.S. 437 (1971). The Court explained  that the statute did not discriminate \namong  religions becau se  “no particula r  sectarian  affiliation”  was required to q ualify  for \nconscientious objector status. Id. at 450-51. “[C]onscientious objector status was available on an \n                                                           \n22  Defendants  acknowledge  that  the  court  in  Archbishop of  Washington concluded  that  the non-interference \nprovision of the accommodation violated the plaintiffs’ free speech rights. See slip op. at 71-74. For the reasons \nstated above, and by the district court in Notre Dame, slip op. at 35-36, defendants respectfully submit that that \naspect of the court’s ruling was error. \n3 8\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 52 of 62 PageID #:  187\nequal basis to both the Quaker and the Roman Catholic.” Larson, 456 U.S. at 247 n.23; see also \nCutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 724 (2005) (upholding RLUIPA against Establishment Clause \nchallenge because it did not “conf er[] . . . privileged status on any particular religious sect” or \n“single[] out [any] bona fide faith for disadvantageous treatment”). \nLike  the statutes at is sue  in  Gillette  and  Cutter,  the  preventive s ervices  coverage \nregulations  do not grant any de nominational  preference or ot herwise  discriminate  among \nreligions. It is of no mom ent that the religious  employer exemption and accommodations for \neligible organizations apply to some e mployers but not others. The regulations do not “violate  \nthe Establishment Clause because [they] delineate[] the contours of a religious acco mmodation \nthat applies equally to o rganizations of every faith and [do] not favor any denom ination over \nanother.” Priests for Life, slip op. at 42-43; accord Notre Dame, slip op. at 31-34; Archbishop of \nWashington, slip op. at 78-80);  O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1163;  see also, e.g., Children’s \nHealthcare Is a Legal Duty, Inc. v. Min De Parle, 212 F.3d 1084, 1090-93 (8th Cir. 2000); Droz \nv. Comm’r of IRS, 48 F.3d 1120, 1124 (9th Cir. 1995); Diocese of Albany, 859 N.E.2d at 468-69. \nHere, the distinctions established by the regulations are not so drawn. \n“Plaintiffs’ [ ] argument—that the Establishment Clause prohibits distinctions among \ndifferent types of organizations affiliated with the same faith—finds no support in Establishment \nClause case law.” Archbishop of Washington, slip op at 78. The exemption and accommodations \nare  available on an   equal  basis  to  organizations  affiliated  with any and all religions. The  \nregulations, therefore, do not di scriminate among religions in vi olation of the Establishm ent \nClause. Indeed, every court to have considered  an Establishment Clause challenge to the prior \nversion of the regulations has rejected it. See, e.g., O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1162 (upholding \nprior version of religious employer exemption because it did “not differentiate between religions, \nbut applie[d] equally to all denom inations”); Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 416-17 (sam e); see \nalso Liberty Univ., Inc. v.

Supp. 2d \nat  1163 (citations om itted).  Accommodations  of  religion  are poss ible  because  the type of \nlegislative line-drawing to which the plaintiffs object in this case is constitutionally permissible. \nId.; Conestoga, 917 F.

Tax Comm’n of NY, 397 U.S. 664, 666 \n(1970); Amos, 483 U.S. at 334 (upholding Title VII’s exemption for religious organizations).24 \nPlaintiffs also claim that the regulations’ definition of re ligious employer violates the \nEstablishment Clause because, more than thirty-five years ago, the In ternal Revenue Service \n(IRS)  developed a non-exhaustive list of four teen  facts and circum stances  that m ay  be \nconsidered,  in addition to “any other fact s  and circumstances which m ay  bear  upon the  \norganization’s claim for church status,” in  assessing whether an organization is a church.  See \n                                                           \n23 Plaintiffs stretch Colorado Christian University v. Weaver, 534 F.3d 1245 (10th Cir. 2008), well beyond its facts \nin suggesting that the case stands for the proposition that the Establishment Clause prohibits the government from \ndistinguishing among different types of organizations that adhere to the same religion. Pls.’ Mem. at 38-39. Weaver \nwas limited to “laws that facially regulate religious issues,” 534 F.3d at 1257, and, particularly, those that do so in a \nway that denies certain religious institutions public benefits that are afforded to all other institutions, secular or \nreligious. The court in Weaver said nothing about the constitutionality of exemptions from generally applicable laws \nthat are designed to accommodate religion, as opposed to discriminate against religion. A requirement that any \nreligious exemption that the government creates must extend to all organizations—no matter their structure or \npurpose—would hamper the government’s ability to accommodate religion. See Corp. of Presiding Bishop of \nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 334 (1987) (“There is ample room under the \nEstablishment Clause for ‘benevolent’ neutrality which will permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship \nand without interference.”); Diocese of Albany, 859 N.E.2d at 464 (“To hold that any religious exemption that is not \nall-inclusive renders a statute non-neutral would be to discourage the enactment of any such exemptions – and thus \nto restrict, rather than promote, freedom of religion.”). And, the manner in which the law at issue in Weaver was \nadministered required the government to make intrusive inquiries into a school’s religious beliefs and practices by, \nfor example, reading syllabi to determine if a school’s theology courses were likely to convince students of religious \ntruths. See 534 F.3d at 1261-62. The religious employer exemption requires no such inquiry: Qualification for the \nexemption does not require the government to make any determination, much less an unconstitutionally intrusive \none. See also Archbishop of Washington, slip op. at 77 (explaining that Weaver does not support the plaintiffs’ \nclaims). \n24 Even if the regulations discriminate among religions (and they do not), they are valid under the Establishment \nClause, because they satisfy strict scrutiny.

Comm’r of IRS , 88 T.C. 1341, 1357-58  (1987); Internal \nRevenue  Manual (IRM) 7.26.2.2.4. Although plaintiffs  do  not appear to have ever before \nchallenged the constitutionality of  this non-exhaustive list, they  now contend that it acts to \nrequire the government to make impermissible “judgments regarding beliefs, practices, and \norganizational structure.” Pls.’ Mem. at 40-41. This claim fails for numerous reasons. \nAs an initial matter, the claim is not ripe an d therefore should be  dismissed for lack of \njurisdiction. See Archbishop of Washington, slip op. at 84-85 (finding that plaintiffs lack standing \nto  argue that the IRS’s fourteen-factor test   violates the Establishm ent  Clause). The non-\nexhaustive list that plaintiffs seek to challenge  is not set out in any statute, regulation, or other \nbinding source of law. It  is instead contained in the IRM, which serves as a source of guidance \nfor the internal administration of the IRS and is not binding on the IRS or courts. United States v. \nWill, 671 F.2d 963, 967 (6th Cir. 1982);  Capital Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Comm’r of Internal \nRevenue, 96 T.C. 204, 216-17 (1991). A party can cha llenge such guidance “only if and when \nthe directive has been applied specifically to them.” Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, \n1013 (9th Cir. 1987); see also, e.g., Home Builders Ass’n of Greater Chicago v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Eng’rs, 335 F.3d 607, 619 (7th Cir. 2003) (concludi ng general statement of policy was not \nripe for review). Plaintiffs do not challenge any determination by the IRS that was based on this \nIRM provision. Because defendants ha ve not applied a similar non-exhaustive list of facts and \ncircumstances to plaintiffs, plaintiffs’ challenge is not ripe. \nIndeed,  qualification  for  the  religious  employer  exemption do es  not require the \ngovernment to make any determination, whether as a result of the  application of the non-\nexhaustive list or otherwise.  If an organization “is organized  and operates as a nonprofit entity \nand is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or  (a)(3)(A)(iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986, as amended,” it qualifies for the exem ption, without any government action whatsoever. \n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). Plaintiffs, moreover, have no difficulty determining whether they qualify \nfor the exemption. The Diocese alleges that  it qualifies for the exem ption, Compl. ¶ 14, and \nCatholic Charities allege that it does not, id. ¶ 10. Any claim —which plaintiffs do not in fact \n4 1\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 55 of 62 PageID #:  190\nmake—that the government will dispute these allegations and therefore need to undertak e any \nsort of intrusive inquiry into whether plaintiffs qualify for the exemption is entirely speculative \nand thus unripe for this reason as well.  \nFinally, even assuming plaintiffs could mount a facial challenge to a non-exhaustive list \nof facts and circumstances that the defendant agencies have never applied to plaintiffs, any such \nchallenge  would be m eritless.  Any intera ction  between  the g overnment  and religio us \norganizations that may be necessary to enforce the religious em ployer exemption is not so  \n“comprehensive,” Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 619 (1971), or “pervasive,”  Agostini v. \nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 233 (1997) (quotations o mitted), as to result in excessive entanglem ent. \nThe Supreme Court has upheld law s that require government monitoring that is more onerous \nthan any monitoring that m ay be required to  enforce the religious em ployer exemption. See \nBowen  v. Kendrick ,  487 U.S. 589, 615-617 (1988) (no ex cessive  entanglement  where the \ngovernment reviewed and monitored programs and materials); Roemer v. Bd. of Pub. Works of \nMd., 426 U.S. 736, 764–765 (1976) (no excessive en tanglement where the state conducted \nannual audits); see also United States v. Corum, 362 F.3d 489, 496 (8th Cir. 2004). And every \ncourt to address the issue upheld  the prior version of the relig ious employer exemption, which \ncontained  the sam e  requirement  that  the o rganization  be  one that is r eferred  to in   section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (a)(3)(A)(iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, against an \nentanglement challenge. See Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 417;  O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at \n1164-65; Geneva Coll., 929 F. Supp. 2d at 439-40.25  \nThus, plaintiffs’ Establishment Clause claim—Count V of the Complaint—fails. \n \n \n                                                           \n25 Even if this Court were to conclude that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate a facial challenge to the non-exhaustive \nlist of facts and circ umstances set forth in IRM 7.26.2.2.4 and that such nonbinding guidance violates the \nEstablishment Clause, the remedy would be invalidation of the list, not invalidation of the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement or the religious employer exemption. The regulations would survive, with the religious employer \nexemption being available to any organization that is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is a church, \nintegrated auxiliary of a church, convention or association of churches, or the exclusively religious activities of any \nreligious order, as those terms are specifically defined under section 6033 or commonly understood. \n4 2\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 56 of 62 PageID #:  191\nE.  The Regulations Do Not Interfere With Church Governance \nPlaintiffs  also assert th at,  by  allegedly requiring plaintiffs  to  facilitate  practices  in \nviolation of their religious beli efs, the regulations in terfere with plaintiffs’ “internal church \ngovernance” in violation of the Religion Clauses.  See Pls.’ Mem. at 42. But that is m erely a \nrestatement of plaintiffs’ substantial burden theory,26 which fails for reasons explained already. \nIndeed, the main case cited by plaintiffs on this point,  Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran \nChurch & School v. E .E.O.C., 132 S. Ct. 694 (2012), is inapposite. In  Hosanna-Tabor, the \nSupreme Court held that allowing a m inister employee to sue her church em ployer under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act—thereby inter fering with “a church’s ability to se lect its own \nministers”—violates the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses. Id. at 704, 706. But this case \nis not about the selection of clergy, nor any  other matters of church governance apart from \nplaintiffs’ religious objection to providing contraceptive coverage (which, again, is subsumed by \nplaintiffs’  substantial burden argum ent).  Nor is   this case about any  law  that regulates the  \nstructure of the church—plaintiffs m ay choose whatever organizational structure they wish. \nThus,  Count VI should be dism issed  or su mmary  judgment  granted to defendants.  See \nArchbishop of Washington, slip op. at 86-88 (entering summary judgment in favor of defendants \non plaintiffs’ claim that the regulations interfere with church governance). \n  F.  Plaintiffs’ APA Claim Fails \nIn Count VII (the only count not raised in  their temporary restraining order m otion), \nplaintiffs  contend the regulations violate th e  APA because they conflict with the W eldon \nAmendment to the Consolidated Appropriations  Act of 2012. They are incorrect. Plaintiffs  \nappear to reason that, because the preventive services coverage regulations require group health \nplans to cover em ergency contraception, such as  Plan B, they require plaintiffs to provide \ncoverage for abortions in violation of federal law. The W eldon Amendment denies funds made \navailable in the Consolidated Appropriations Act  of 2012 to any federal, state, or local agency, \n                                                           \n26 While the Zubik ruling was incorrect for reasons explained already, supra note 7, that court analyzed arguments \nabout interference with the church under RFRA’s “substantial burden” test. See 2013 WL 6118696 at *27. \n4 3\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 57 of 62 PageID #:  192\nprogram,  or governm ent  that “sub jects  any in stitutional  or  individual  health care entity to \ndiscrimination on the basis that the health care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage \nof, or refer for abortions.” Pub. L. N o. 112-74, §§ 506, 507, 125 Stat. 786, 1111-12 (Dec. 23, \n2011). The regulations, however, do not require that any health plan cover abortion at all, much \nless as a preventive service. The government has made clear that the preventive services covered \nby the regulations do not in clude abortifacient drugs.27 Although plaintiffs are certainly entitled \nto believe that em ergency contraceptives and  certain IUDs are abortifacient drugs or cause \nabortions, neither the government nor this Court is required to accept that characterization, which \nis inconsistent with the FDA’s scientific assessment and with f ederal law. While plaintiffs’ \nreligious beliefs may define abortion m ore broadly than federal law, statutory interpretation \nrequires that terms be construed as a m atter of law and not in accordance with any individual’s \npersonal views or beliefs. E.g., GEICO v. Benton, 859 F.2d 1147, 1149 (3d Cir. 1988). \nIn recommending what contraceptive services should be covered by health plans w ithout \ncost-sharing, the IOM Report identified the contraceptives that have been approved by the FDA \nas  safe and effective.  See  IOM R EP.  at 10, AR at 308. And the list of FDA-approved \ncontraceptives includes emergency contraceptives such as Plan B. See id. at 105, AR at 403. The \nbasis for the inclusion of such drugs among safe and effective means of contraception dates back \nto 1997, when the FDA first explained why Plan B and similar drugs act as contraceptives rather \nthan abortifacients. See Prescription Drug Products; Certain  Combined Oral Contraceptives for \nUse as Postcoital Emergency Contraception, 62 Fed. Reg. 8610, 8611 (Feb. 25, 1997); 45 C.F.R. \n§ 46.202(f). In light of this conclus ion by the FDA, HHS informed Title X grantees, which are \nrequired to offer a range of acceptable and e ffective family planning methods—and, except \nunder limited circumstances, may not offer abortion—that they “should consider the availability \nof emergency contraception the same as any othe r method which has been established as safe \n                                                           \n27 HealthCare.gov, Affordable Care Act Rules on Expanding Access to Preventive Services for Women (August 1, \n2011), available at http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/factsheets/2011/08/womensprevention08012011a.html (last \nvisited Dec. 11, 2013); see also IOM REP. at 22 (recognizing that abortion services are outside the scope of \nrecommendations), AR at 320. \n4 4\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 58 of 62 PageID #:  193\nand  effective.” Office of Populati on  Affairs, Mem orandum  (Apr. 23, 1997), \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/opa/pdfs/opa-97-02.pdf  (last visited D ec.  11, 2013);  see  also  42  U.S.C. \n§§ 300, 300a-6. The regulations are consis tent with over a decade of re gulatory policy and \npractice and thus cannot be deemed contrary to any law dealing with abortion. See Bhd. of R.R. \nSignalmen  v. Surface Transp. Bd. ,  638 F.3d 807, 815 (D.C. Cir.  2011)  (giving particular \ndeference to an agency’s longstanding interpretation).28 \nThus, because the challenged regulations are  not contrary to law, Count VII of the  \nComplaint should be dismissed or summary judgment granted to defendants. \n \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS  CANNOT ESTABLI SH  IRREPARABLE HARM, AND AN  \nINJUNCTION WOULD INJURE THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC \n“The  loss  of First Am endment  freedoms,  for even m inimal  periods of tim e, \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976). Even \nassuming arguendo that same rule applies to a st atutory claim under RFRA,  plaintiffs have not \nshown that the challenged regula tions violate their First Amendm ent or RFRA rights, so there \nhas been no “loss of First Am endment freedoms” for any period of tim e. Id. In this respect, the \nmerits and irreparable injury prongs of the temporary restraining  order analysis merge together, \nand plaintiffs cannot show irreparable injury without also showing a likelihood of success on the \nmerits, which they cannot do. See McNeilly v. Land, 684 F.3d 611, 621 (6th Cir. 2012). \nFurthermore, plaintiffs’ claim to irreparable harm is further underm ined by their own \ndelay in filing suit. Although the challenged regul ations were published in the Federal Register \nin early July, 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, these plaintiffs waited over five months—until December 10, \n2013—to file suit and to seek the extraordinary re medy of a temporary restraining order. Such a \nsubstantial and unexplained delay  seriously undermines these plaintiffs’ claim of irreparable \nharm.  See,  e.g.,  Autocam,  2012 WL 6845677, at *9 (noting, in  a  challenge to the prior \n                                                           \n28 Representative Weldon, the sponsor of the Weldon Amendment, himself did not consider the word “abortion” in \nthe statute to include FDA-approved emergency contraceptives. See 148 Cong. Rec. H6566, H6580 (daily ed. Sept. \n25, 2002) (“The provision of contraceptive services has never been defined as abortion in Federal statute, nor has \nemergency contraception, what has commonly been interpreted as the morning-after pill. . . . [U]nder the current \nFDA policy[,] that is considered contraception, and it is not affected at all by this statute.”). \n4 5\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 59 of 62 PageID #:  194\ncontraceptive-coverage regulations, that “the immediacy of the dilemma Plaintiffs face is in no \nsmall part of their own m aking,” because plaintiffs filed suit “less than two m onths before the \ndeadline Plaintiffs say is critical”); Fund for Animals v. Frizzell , 530 F.2d 982, 987 (D.C. Cir. \n1975) (denying preliminary injunctive relief and noting that a delay of forty-four days after final \nregulations were issued was “inexcusable”). \nTurning to the final two temporary restraining order factors—the balance of equities and \nthe  public interest—“there is i nherent  harm  to an agency in preventing it from enforcing \nregulations that Congress found it in  the public interest to direct  that agency to develop and \nenforce.” Cornish v. Dudas, 540 F. Supp. 2d 61, 65 (D.D.C. 2008); see also Connection Distrib. \nCo. v. Reno, 154 F.3d 281, 296 (6th Cir. 1998) (indicating that granting an injunction against the \nenforcement  of a likely constitutional statute would harm   the governm ent).  Enjoining the \npreventive services coverage regulations as  to plaintiffs would unde rmine the government’s \nability to achieve Congress’s goals of improving the health of women and newborn children and \nequalizing the coverage of preventive services for women and men.29 \nIt would also be contrary to the public interest to deny plaintiffs’ employees (and their \nfamilies)  the  benefits  of  the preventive se rvices  coverage  regulations.  See  Weinberger v.  \nRomero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312-13 (1982) (“[C]ourts . . . should pay particular regard for the \npublic  consequences in e mploying  the extraord inary  remedy  of injunction.”). Many of the \nplaintiffs’ employees may not sh are plaintiffs’ objections to th e challenged regulations. Those \nemployees should not be deprived of the benefits  of payments provided by a third party that is \nnot their employer for the full range of FDA-approved contraceptive services, as prescribed by a \nhealth care provider, on the basis of  their employers’ religious objection. Many wom en do not \n                                                           \n29 Plaintiffs note that defendants consented to preliminary injunctions in a few cases involving for-profit companies, \nsee Pls.’ Mem. at 45-46, but defendants’ consent in those cases was nothing more than an effort to conserve judicial \nand governmental resources. Those cases were in the Seventh, Eighth, and D.C. Circuits, and they were filed after \nmotions panels in those circuits had preliminary enjoined the regulations pending appeal in similar cases. See \nMersino, 2013 WL 3546702 at *16 (“[W]here the government has conceded to injunctive relief, it appears that it has \ngenerally done so in jurisdictions where the legal landscape has been set against them, and continuing to litigate the \nclaims in those jurisdictions would be a waste of both judicial and client resources.”). The government continues to \noppose preliminary injunctions in other circuits regarding for-profit plaintiffs, and opposes in all circuits injunctive \nrelief sought by non-profit plaintiffs like plaintiffs here.  \n4 6\n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00709-RC   Document 10   Filed 12/23/13   Page 60 of 62 PageID #:  195\nuse contraceptive services because they are no t covered by their health plan or requ ire costly \ncopayments, coinsurance, or deductibles. IOM R EP. at 19-20, 109, AR at 317-18, 407; 77 Fed. \nReg. at 8727, AR at 214; 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887, AR  at 19. As a result, in m any cases, both \nwomen and developing fetuses suffer negative health consequences. See IOM REP. at 20, 102-04, \nAR at 318, 400-02; 77 Fed. Reg.  at 8728, AR at 215.  And women are put at a com petitive \ndisadvantage due to their lost productivity and the disproportionate financial burden they bear in \nregard to preventive health services. 155  Cong. Rec. S12106-02, S12114 (daily ed. Dec. 2, \n2009); see also IOM REP. at 20, AR at 318. \nEnjoining defendants from enforcing, as to pl aintiffs, the preventive services coverage \nregulations—the purpose of which is to eliminate these burdens, 75 Fed. Reg. at 41,733, AR a t \n233; see also 77 Fed. Reg. at 8728, AR at 215—would thus inflict a very real harm on the public \nand, in particular, a readily id entifiable group of individuals. See Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 \nF.3d 1109, 1139 (9th Cir. 2009) (v acating preliminary injunction entered by district court and  \nnoting that “[t]here is a general public interest in ensuring that all citizens have timely access to \nlawfully prescribed medications”). Accordingly, even assuming plaintiffs were likely to succeed \non the merits (which they are not for the reas ons explained above), any potential harm  to \nplaintiffs  resulting  from  their of fense  at a  third  party  providing p ayment  for  contraceptive \nservices at no cost to, and w ith no administration by, plaintiffs’ would be outweighed by the \nsignificant harm an injunction would cause these employees and their families. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, defenda nts respectfully ask that the Court deny plaintiffs’ \nmotion for a tem porary restraining order and prelim inary injunction,  and grant defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs’ claims. \nRespectfully submitted this 23rd day of December, 2013, \n   \n  STUART F.

The court finds that Plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated that they have standing and have met their burden for issuance of a permanent \ninjunction. \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nSebelius, No. 13-cv- (D.D.C.

Background \nPlaintiffs filed suit on December 10, 2013.  Because of the January 1, 2014 deadline the \ncourt ordered early consultation by counsel on the issues. With input from counsel at the \nmanagement conference, the court entered an expedited briefing schedule and set a hearing for \nDecember 30, 2013.  Defendants moved for dismissal or in the alternative, for summary \njudgment.  The Government filed the administrative record, and the court has reviewed those \nportions designated by counsel in the pleadings and papers on file. The parties have also filed \n“Parties Stipulated Preliminary Findings.” [Doc. # 26].    \nAt the hearing Plaintiffs presented witnesses, live and by deposition, and the court heard \nargument of counsel. The parties agreed that the record had been fully developed and only \nquestions of law existed.  The parties also agreed at the hearing that they did not object to the \ncourt consolidating that hearing with a trial on the merits, and making a final determination as to \nmatters raised by Defendants’ motion to dismiss or alternatively for summary judgment and \nPlaintiffs’ request for an injunction based on the record before the court.  [Transcript of Hearing \non December 30, 2013 (Tr.) pp. 75-77].3  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2). \nThe court did not scour the administrative record in a search for facts that support either \nparty, but it has considered the portions that have been specifically referenced by the parties in \ntheir motions and briefing.  Doddy v. Oxy USA, Inc., 101 F.3d 448, 463 (5th Cir. 1996) (citations \nomitted). The Government argues that the court should limit its review of the facts to the \nadministrative record, and presumably the stipulated facts.  Since Plaintiffs are alleging \ninterference with important constitutional rights, the court will consider the evidence presented \n                                                 \n3 A final, certified transcript has not been prepared, so the page numbers in this Memorandum \nOrder are those of a rough transcript.  They may differ from those of any final transcript that is \nprepared.  \n3 \n \n\nby Plaintiffs. See McNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., 498 U.S. 479, 493-94, 111 S. Ct. 888, 896-97 \n(1991). \nThe facts pertinent to this case are virtually uncontroverted, and very similar to the facts \nin all of the other opinions the court has seen so far.  To save space the court will adopt the \nParties Stipulated Preliminary Findings [Doc # 26] as findings of fact of the court.  The court \nalso finds that the statements concerning the religious beliefs of Catholics (including Plaintiffs) \nthe teachings of the Catholic Church, and the role that Plaintiff Catholic Charities plays in the \nministry of Plaintiff Roman Catholic Diocese of Beaumont, set out in the “Declaration of Bishop \nCurtis J Guillory, S.V.D., D.D.” [Doc # 3-1] factually set out the sincere religious beliefs of \nPlaintiffs and their respective members.  [Bishop Guillory, Tr. p. 4].  The court sustains the \nGovernment’s objection to those statements that express Bishop Guillory’s opinions as to the \nlegal effect of, or proper legal interpretation of,  the regulations and statutes in question, at \nparagraphs 15, 17, 19, 21, and the first sentence of 22, and will not consider those as facts.         \nA.  Findings of Fact as to Plaintiffs’ Sincere Religious Beliefs \nIn summary, Plaintiffs are both entities affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. In \ntheir complaint and motion for preliminary injunction, they allege that the contraceptive mandate \nforces them to choose between violating central elements of their religious faith and paying \nsubstantial financial penalties. For nearly two thousand years the Catholic Church “has taught \nthat life is sacred from conception to death and any – whether it’s medicine or instruments that \nwould prevent life, we consider morally wrong.”  [Bishop Guillory, Tr. pp. 5-6]. \nThe Church also teaches that material cooperation with evil is also morally wrong. \n“Material cooperation with evil is like in this particular case, for instance, we for instance as co-\npayers with the insurance would be cooperating in what we think is morally wrong. In other \n4 \n \n\nwords, it's cooperating in -- into something that we consider evil, or morally evil; and we are a \npart of that. We are a participant in that action or that program. And that's what we call material \ncooperation.” [Bishop Guillory, Tr. p. 9]. Defendants do not challenge that Plaintiffs have a \nsincerely held religious belief that all forms of contraceptives and abortifacients are morally \nwrong. \nB.  Findings of Fact as to Catholic Diocese of Beaumont \nThe Catholic Diocese of Beaumont (“Diocese”) is a non-profit organization that \nencompasses forty-four parishes and seven missions located in the greater Beaumont area. The \nDiocese employs over 950 people, approximately 370 of whom are currently eligible for health \nplan benefits offered through the Diocese. The Diocese carries out a tripartite mission of \nspiritual, educational, and social service. Its spiritual ministry is carried out through its parishes. \nIts educational ministry is conducted through its schools and religious education programs. The \nDiocese operates three parish schools and two diocesan schools which serve approximately \n1,088 students.  \nConsistent with Church teachings on social justice, the Diocese provides a self-insured \nhealth plan to employees working at least thirty hours per week.  The plan is offered through the \nChristian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust. Consistent with Catholic teaching, the Trust health \nplan does not cover abortifacients, sterilization, or contraception.4  Dropping coverage for \nCatholic Charities so the Bishop would not have to sign the self-certification form would violate \nthe sincerely held religious belief that employee health care is a right, and should be provided. \n \n                                                 \n4 Though generally not covered by the Trust plan, contraceptives may be covered when provided \nfor medically necessary, non-contraceptive purposes that have been approved by the Trust.  \n5 \n \n\nC.  Findings of Fact as to Catholic Charities of Southeast Texas, Inc. \nCatholic Charities of Southeast Texas, Inc. (“Catholic Charities”) is a faith-driven non-\nprofit that provides services to approximately 6,000 individuals annually. Catholic Charities has \nten full-time and seven part-time employees who are offered health insurance through the \nDiocese.  \nCatholic Charities participates in the Catholic charitable mission of aiding those in need, \nincluding feeding the poor, helping immigrants, and providing counseling.  [Bishop Guillory, Tr. \np. 11].  Bishop Guillory has the primary responsibility for determining whether programs \nadministered by Catholic Charities comport with Catholic teachings and principles, and as such, \nit is an entity of the Catholic Diocese of Beaumont.  [Bishop Guillory, Tr. pp. 11-12].  The \nDiocese contributes almost a third of the budget of Catholic Charities.   The self-certification \nform at issue in this dispute would have to be signed either by Bishop Guillory or by another \nperson with his approval.  [Bishop Guillory, Tr. p. 22].  If the form were not prepared or \ncoverage for Catholic Charities were dropped, the resulting fines would impose a heavy financial \nburden on Plaintiffs.  [Bishop Guillory, Tr. p. 20]; [Sherlock, Tr. pp. 33-34]. \nD.  The Statutory and Regulatory History \nThe now familiar statutory and regulatory history is outlined in the “Parties Stipulated \nPreliminary Findings” and is set out in detail in E. Tex. Baptist Univ. v. Sebelius, No. 4-12-cv-\n3009, (S.D. Tex. Dec. 27, 2013), Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York v. Sebelius, No. 12-\ncv-2542, (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 16, 2013), and Zubik v. Sebelius, No. 13-cv-01459 (Pa. Nov. 21, 2013).  \nIn brief, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) as well as the \nHealth Care and Education Reconciliation Act in March 2010.  This was followed by more than \nthree years of rule making.   \n6 \n \n\nThe ACA requires that group health insurance plans cover certain preventative medical \nservices without cost-sharing, such as a copayment or a deductible. Pursuant to regulations \nsubsequently issued, the preventative services that must be covered include contraception, \nsterilization, and related counseling (the “Mandate”). There was a good deal of concern over the \nimpact of the law and regulations on the religious beliefs and practices of various faith groups \nand several proposals for some kind of religious exemption were published and amended.  Some \n600,000 comments were received during the process. \nThe Final Rules purport to accommodate religious objections to the Mandate in two \nways.  First, the Final Rules revised the definition of “religious employers,” who are entirely \nexempt from the Mandate.  The Final Rules define “religious employer” as a non-profit referred \nto in § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code, which in turn refers to churches, \ntheir integrated auxiliaries, associations of churches, and the exclusively religious activities of \nreligious orders.  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874.  The Diocese meets this definition and is thus exempt \nfrom the contraceptive mandate.  Catholic Charities is not exempt.  This is true even though \nCatholic Charities participates in the Diocese’s health plan, because non-exempt entities cannot \navail themselves of the religious employer exemption unless they “independently meet the \ndefinition of religious employer.”  Id. at 39,886.    \nThe Final Rules provide for an “accommodation” for “eligible organizations” that do not \nmeet the definition of “religious employer.”  An “eligible organization” is one that satisfies the \nfollowing criteria:   \n(1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive \nservices required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on account of religious \nobjections. \n \n(2) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity.  \n \n7 \n \n\n(3) The organization holds itself out as a religious organization.  \n \n(4) The organization self-certifies, in a form and manner specified by the Secretary, that \nit satisfies the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, and makes such \nself-certification available for examination upon request by the first day of the first \nplan year to which the accommodation in paragraph (c) of this section applies. The \nself-certification must be executed by a person authorized to make the certification on \nbehalf of the organization, and must be maintained in a manner consistent with the \nrecord retention requirements under section 107 of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974.   \n \n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b). \nThere is no dispute that Catholic Charities would qualify for this accommodation if the \nself-certification form is signed. The Final Rules state that an eligible organization is not \nrequired to “contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage” as to which it has \nreligious objections.  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874.  Instead, the eligible organization must complete a \nself-certification form stating that it is an eligible organization, and provide a copy of that form \nto its issuer or, where an eligible organization self-insures, as do all plaintiffs here, to their TPA.  \nThe TPA is then required to provide or arrange for payments for contraceptive services, a \nrequirement imposed through the Department of Labor’s ERISA enforcement authority.  See id. \nat 39,879-39,880.  The self-certification “will be treated as a designation of the third party \nadministrator(s) as plan administrator and claims administrator for contraceptive benefits \npursuant to section 3(16) of ERISA.”  Id. at 39,879.  The TPA is required to provide these \nservices “without cost sharing premium, fee, or other charge to plan participants or beneficiaries, \nor to the eligible organization or its plan.”  Id. at 39,879-80.  The TPA may seek reimbursement \nfor such payments through adjustments to its Federally-Facilitated Exchange (“FFE”) user fees.  \nId. at 39,882.   \n \n \n8 \n \n\nII.  Legal Standard for Injunctions \n“It is well-established that the party seeking a permanent injunction must demonstrate: \n‘(1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary \ndamages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of \nhardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the \npublic interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction. The decision to grant or deny \npermanent injunctive relief is an act of equitable discretion by the district court, reviewable on \nappeal for abuse of discretion.’”  Abraham v. Alpha Chi Omega, 708 F.3d 614, 626-27 (5th Cir. \n2013) (quoting eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 126 S. Ct. 1837, 1839 \n(2006)). \nIII.  Analysis \nA.  Article III Standing \nDefendants have argued that Plaintiffs lack Article III standing, asserting that the \ngovernment has no ability to enforce the contraceptive mandate because the health plan in \nquestion is a church plan not governed by ERISA.  As discussed in detail by Judges Rosenthal \nand Cogan, the injury to the religious organizations relates to the submission of the self-\ncertification form, not to whether a TPA may or may not be penalized for not providing \ncontraceptive coverage.  E. Tex. Baptist Univ. v. Sebelius, No. 4-12-cv-3009, at *23 (S.D. Tex. \nDec. 27, 2013).  Indeed, the existence of a regulatory loophole cannot obviate Plaintiffs’ \nstanding.  Id.  “This alleged spiritual complicity is independent of whether the scheme actually \nsucceeds at providing contraceptive coverage.”  Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius, No. \n1-12-cv-2542 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 16, 2013).   \n \n \n9 \n \n\nFurthermore, the federal regulations governing Defendant Department of Labor, and \nthose governing Defendant Department of the Treasury provide: \n(iii) The eligible organization must not directly or indirectly, seek to interfere with \na third party administrator’s arrangements to provide or arrange separate payments for \ncontraceptive services for participants or beneficiaries, and must not, directly or \nindirectly, seek to influence the third party administrator’s decision to make any such \narrangement. \n \nCompare 26 C.F.R. §54.9815-2713A(b)(iii), relating to Department of Treasury, Internal \nRevenue Service, and the exact same language in  29 C.F.R. §2590.715-2713A(b)(iii), relating to \nDepartment of Labor. \n  Mr. Sherlock, President of the Board of Plaintiff Catholic Charities, testified that he has \nalready contacted insurers and plan providers to determine whether any would offer coverage if \nPlaintiffs did not provide a self-certification. [Mr. Sherlock, Tr. pp. 27-29].  What stronger way \nis there to influence a provider of goods and services than shopping your requirements to \ncompetitors?  A rule that prevents plaintiffs from comparison shopping, and negotiating, for an \nacceptable policy on favorable terms is a burden. \nPlaintiffs’ injury is sufficient for the requirements of Article III standing. \nB.  First Amendment- Free Exercise of Religion \nPrior to 1990, First Amendment jurisprudence relied on a compelling-interest test.  See \nWisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S. Ct. 1526 (1972); Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 83 S. \nCt. 1790 (1963).  In 1990, the Supreme Court held that the “Free Exercise Clause of the First \nAmendment d[id] not prohibit governments from burdening religious practices through generally \napplicable laws.”  Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, \n424, 126 S. Ct. 1211, 1216 (2006) (describing Emp’t Div., Dep’t of Human Resources of Ore. v. \nSmith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S. Ct. 1595 (1990)). In Smith, the Supreme Court also held that “the \n10 \n \n\nConstitution does not require judges to engage in a case-by-case assessment of the religious \nburdens imposed by facially constitutional laws.” Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 424, 126 S. Ct. at 1216 \n(citing Smith, 494 U.S. at 883-90, 110 S. Ct. at 1602-06). \nIn response to Smith, Congress sought to restore the compelling-interest test by the \npassages of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (“RFRA”) in 1993.  42 U.S.C. § \n2000bb, et seq.  “[T]he Federal Government may not, as a statutory matter, substantially burden \na person’s exercise of religion, ‘even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability’ \nunless the government can satisfy the compelling-interest test.” O Centro, 546 U.S. at 424, 126 \nS. Ct. at 1216 (quoting § 2000bb-1(a)). \nThe threshold inquiry under RFRA is whether the Government’s regulation substantially \nburdens the exercise of a sincerely held religious belief.  See Diaz v. Collins, 114 F.3d 69, 71 \n(5th Cir. 1997).  Defendants do not dispute Plaintiffs have a sincerely held religious belief that \ncontraception and abortion is morally wrong; therefore, the only question that remains in this \ninquiry is whether the ACA substantially burdens that belief.  If the court finds a substantial \nburden, the Government must then show that the burden “is in furtherance of a compelling \ngovernmental interest” and that it “is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \ngovernmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). \n1.  Substantial Burden \nAs ably discussed at length by Judge Rosenthal, Fifth Circuit case law uses a subjective \nstandard for determining the presence of a substantial burden. So long as Plaintiffs are compelled \nor pressured by punitive fines to act or refrain from action, and that action or inaction is \nreligiously offensive to them, a substantial burden exists. See E. Tex. Baptist Univ. v. Sebelius, \nNo. 4-12-cv-3009, at *26-40 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 27, 2013). \n11 \n \n\nRFRA does not expressly define “substantial burden.”  See Hicks v. Garner, 69 F.3d 22, \n26 n. 22 (5th Cir. 1995).  The analysis of substantial burdens under RFRA is based on the pre-\nSmith cases Yoder and Sherbert.   \nIn Yoder, the plaintiffs were Old Order Amish and Conservative Amish Mennonites who \nrefused to enroll their fourteen- and fifteen-year-old children in public or private school, in \nviolation of Wisconsin’s compulsory education requirements, arguing that school attendance \nendangered the children’s salvation.  Yoder, 406 U.S. at 207-209, 92 S. Ct. at 1529-30.  The \nSupreme Court in Yoder held that the \nimpact of the compulsory-attendance law on respondents’ practice of the Amish \nreligion [wa]s not only severe, but inescapable, for the Wisconsin law \naffirmatively compels them, under threat of criminal sanction, to perform acts \nundeniably at odds with fundamental tenets of their religious beliefs. . . . [The \ncompulsory-attendance law] carries with it precisely the kind of objective danger \nto the free exercise of religion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent. \n. . . [It] carries with it a very real threat of undermining the Amish community and \nreligious practice as they exist today; they must either abandon belief and be \nassimilated into society at large, or be forced to migrate to some other and more \ntolerant region. \n \nYoder, 406 U.S. at 218, 92 S. Ct. at 1534-35. \n \n  In Sherbert, the plaintiff was a Seventh-Day Adventist who refused to work on her \nSabbath, Saturday, and was denied unemployment benefits because of that.   Sherbert, 374 U.S. \nat 399-401, 83 S. Ct. at 1791-92.  The Supreme Court held that \nnot only is it apparent that appellant’s declared ineligibility for benefits derives \nsolely from the practice of her religion, but the pressure upon her to forego that \npractice is unmistakable. The ruling forces her to choose between following the \nprecepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning \none of the precepts of her religion in order to accept work, on the other hand.  \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \n\nGovernmental imposition of such a choice puts the same kind of burden upon the \nfree exercise of religion as would a fine imposed against appellant for her \nSaturday worship. \n \nSherbert, 374 U.S. at 404, 83 S. Ct. at 1794. \n“Under RFRA, a ‘substantial burden’ is imposed only when individuals are forced to \nchoose between following the tenets of their religion and receiving a governmental benefit \n(Sherbert) or coerced to act contrary to their religious beliefs by threat of civil or criminal \nsanctions (Yoder).”  Navajo Nation v. U.S. Forest Serv., 535 F.3d 1058, 1069, 1069-70 (9th Cir. \n2008) (en banc).  The Fifth Circuit has explained government action substantially burdens a \nreligious belief when it “truly pressures the adherent to significantly modify his religious \nbehavior and significantly violate his religious beliefs,” in the RLUIPA context.  Moussazadeh v. \nTex. Dept. of Criminal Justice, 703 F.3d 781, 793 (quoting Adkins v. Kaspar, 393 F.3d 559, 570 \n(5th Cir. 2004)).  Even indirect compulsion that infringes upon free exercise can be substantial.  \nSee Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 718, 101 S. Ct. 1425, 1432 \n(1981). \nDefendants have argued that any burden the ACA places on Plaintiffs is de minimis.  \nPlaintiffs aver that it is not.  District courts are split on this matter, with authority supporting both \npositions.  Compare University of Notre Dame v.Sebelius, No. 13-cv-01276 (N.D. Ind. Dec. 20. \n2013) (holding de minimus burden) with E. Tex. Baptist Univ. v. Sebelius, No. 4-12-cv-3009 \n(S.D. Tex. Dec. 27, 2013) (finding substantial burden exists). \n  So just what is being required of the Bishop in this case?  According to the Government \nhe need  only sign EBSA Form 700, which contains a true statement of his, and the Church’s,  \nobjection to contraceptive services.  But, the regulations provide that “the self-certification will \nbe treated as a designation of the third party administrator(s) as plan administrator and claims \n13 \n \n\nadministrator for contraceptive benefits . . . .” 78 FR 39879 (emphasis added).  The rule drafters \nhave chosen to be their own lexicographers, and the Government is bound by that choice.  Like \nHumpty Dumpty, politicians may ascribe varied nuances of meaning and intent to their \nstatements.5  Judicial interpretation of federal regulations requires a more consistent, plain \nmeaning approach.  See U.S. v. Woods, ___ U.S. ___, 134 S. Ct. 557, 566-67 (2013). \nThe Government responds: “we have no power to actually compel the third party \nadministrator provide the coverage so there is no burden.”  If the IRS and the Department of \nLabor are truly helpless hothouse flowers in this dispute, then why did the Government not \naccept this court’s invitation to agree to a limited extension of Plaintiffs’ deadlines to avoid the \nnecessity of preparing for, and presenting, this case during a holiday season.  See Doc # 5, p. 2, \npar. 3.  Based on their docket sheets, there were, at the same time, cases around the country \nrequiring the immediate attention of counsel for the Government, Mr. Humphries.  See also \nArchdiocese of New York, p 11-12 (belated assertion of powerlessness argument), East Tex. \nBaptist University, p. 24, n.4 (why must form be signed now if it is meaningless?) \n  More importantly, given the history behind the adoption the First Amendment, can the \ncourt accept either the Government’s de minimus argument or its assertion of powerlessness?  \nNobody would argue today that requiring any person of faith to sign a Test Act oath would be a \nde minimus burden on the exercise of religious beliefs.6    Would the result be different if such an \n                                                 \n5 “When I use a word” said Humpty Dumpty, in rather a scornful tone “it means just what I \nchoose it to mean-neither more nor less.”  Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass, 1872. \n \n6 See An Act for Preventing Dangers Which May Happen from Popish Recusants, 1672, 25 Car. \nII, c. 2, § 7 (Eng.) (commonly referred to as the Test Act of 1673) (averment of disbelief in \ntransubstantiation); N.C. Const. of 1776, art. XXXII (“That no person, who shall deny the being \nof God or the truth of the Protestant religion, or the divine authority either of the Old or New \nTestaments, or who shall hold religious principles incompatible with the freedom and safety of \n14 \n \n\noath was worded to comport with the signer’s personal belief, but another statute or regulation \nprovided that  it would be “treated as” the opposite?  After all, once the oath is signed the \nGovernment would have no way of knowing what the person truly believed.        \n  Submitting the self-certification affidavit is not simply espousing a belief that Plaintiffs \nhold.  It is defined as an authorization for the TPA to provide coverage.  It enables the exact \nharm that Plaintiffs seek to avoid, harm that Plaintiffs find religiously forbidden.  If Plaintiffs \nchoose to follow the course they believe their faith dictates, they face fines that all parties agree \nare onerous.  The Diocese could dump Catholic Charities from its health plan, but this runs afoul \nof Church teachings on social justice and the rights of employees.    This “Hobson’s Choice” is a \nquintessential “substantial burden” on the free exercise of religious belief, prohibited by RFRA. \n2. Compelling Interest \nThe RFRA states that  “Government may substantially burden a person’s exercise of \nreligion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person . . . is the least \nrestrictive means of furthering [a] compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb–1(b). \n“RFRA requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied \nthrough application of the challenged law ‘to the person’ — the particular claimant whose \nsincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.” O Centro, 546 U.S. at 431-32.   \nDefendants propose two compelling interests: the promotion of public health and \nprovision of equal access for women to healthcare.  As stated by Judge Cogan, the Government’s \nposition that Christian Brothers could not be “required” or “mandated” to provide coverage for \ncontraceptive services “fatally undermines any claim that imposing the Mandate on these \n                                                                                                                                                             \nthe State, shall be capable of holding any office or place of trust or profit in the civil department \nwithin this State.”) \n15 \n \n\nplaintiffs serves a compelling governmental interest.  Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York \nv. Sebelius, No. 12-cv-2542, at *33 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 16, 2013).     \nOn the other hand, if the objectives are simply assumed to be compelling, Defendants \nhave failed to establish that this is the least restrictive means to achieve them.  Indeed, several \nother district court opinions have provided a myriad of less restrictive alternatives.  See E. Tex. \nBaptist Univ. v. Sebelius, No. 4-12-cv-3009, at *42-43 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 27, 2013) (discussing \nvarious less restrictive alternatives proposed by other courts).  Defendants therefore fail to meet \ntheir burden. \nC.  The APA \nPlaintiffs pled claims under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA).  Plaintiff’s \nproposed conclusions of law make no mention of the APA, and at the hearing, which Plaintiffs \nagreed could be consolidated with the trial, the issue was not raised.  The Government’s \nproposed conclusions of law included the somewhat circular analysis: “The regulations do not \nviolate the Administrative Procedure Act because the regulations are in accordance with federal \nlaw.”  Nobody has asserted that the rulemaking process, or the procedures used for adopting the \ncontested regulation violated the law, but the court has found that the regulations themselves \nviolate Plaintiff’s rights.   That conclusion does not depend on an analysis of the APA.  To make \nclear that the court is entering a final judgment, Plaintiff’s APA claim is dismissed.  \nIV.  Conclusion \nPlaintiffs are entitled to a permanent injunction.  To re- state  the Order signed on \nDecember 31, 2013 [Doc. # 32], the Government is enjoined from applying or enforcing the \nregulations that require the Plaintiffs, their health plans, TPAs, or issuers, to provide or execute \nthe self-certification forms that enable or require the TPA or issuer to provide health insurance \n16 \n \n\ncoverage for Plaintiff’s employees for FDA-approved contraceptives, emergency contraceptives, \nproducts, or services under the requirements imposed in 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4), Pub. L. 11-\n148, § 1563(e)-(f), as well as the application of the penalties found in 26 U.S.C. §§ 4980D & \n4980H, and 29 U.S.C. § 1132.” \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all currently pending motions are DENIED as MOOT.  \nA final judgment consistent with the Memorandum and Order shall be forthcoming. \n \n17 \n ",
